B00006FXB6|5.0|Another fantastic record from one of the most important bands in the world at the moment. These boys continue to cover new ground but always with an inspiring &quot;old school&quot; feel. This record is a great example of what really separates this band from their competitors - if you like - i.e. the ability to grind out crunching riffs and exhillarting rock music with an air of grace and sophistication. This is a record that will make the corner of your mouth curl up an your head nod confidently back and forth. A truly great new release.
B00005JKWJ|4.0|In short, Blade II takes what worked from the first film, and improves on it.<br />The style, fast paced action from the first is even bigger and better this time around. With improved special effects, awesome camera work and a very cool new breed of vampire, this film delivers the goods.<br />Blade returns, on a mission to save his mentor, Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), who, we find out, didn't die in the original film. But once he revives his mentor, vampire elite come to enlist Blades help against a new breed of vampire, one which feeds on vampires.<br />The stylized action is phenomenal this time around, which the camera swooping close in, far away, and all about the action. It is quite the visual feast.<br />Sure, there isn't much deep meaning in the film, but it doesn't matter. This is an action film that is chock full of action. Not just a retread of the same scenes countless other action flicks have. This creates a whole new world of action, and is pure enjoyment.<br />Don't miss this one if you liked the original. But you don't need to see the first Blade to enjoy it. Check it out.
0694003611|5.0|Our 2 year old son just loves this book.  He asks us to read it to him every night, often multiple times.  The book has a wonderful rhythm to it, and the illustrations are bright and captivating.  I look forward to the time when my little one comes running, shouting \\"moon, moon\\"!  This is a must have, and my family will cherish it forever.
B00005JKJA|5.0|David Lynch's MULHOLLAND DRIVE is a masterpiece!<br />There is nothing more that I can say, that has not already been said.<br />Though some might call it confusing and pointless, DRIVE is (when you really think about it) intelligent, effective, original, and unique! Lynch nails every part of the story down to the finest detail.<br />Great acting, too (especially by Naomi Watts and Laura Elena Harring).<br />One of the best films of the past decade.
0804115613|5.0|I love Fannie Flagg's books, and I wish she'd write faster!  I read this one in a day and just adored it.  SOOOOO much better than the film, it's funny, sad, joyful, and just plain wonderful.  Keep writing, Fannie!
B00005JKQZ|2.0|A BEAUTIFUL MIND is just a mediocre film. After seeing such brilliant films as DONNIE DARKO, MOULIN ROUGE, VANILLA SKY, LORD...RINGS, MULHOLLAND DRIVE, etc., I fail to understand why this film was nominated for anything.<br />After seeing this film for the first time, I thought: &quot;Well... that was okay. What's for dinner?&quot;. The next day, I had a discussion with my aunt about the real John Nash. The more I learned, the more I disliked the film. <br />I can't believe that Academy Award winner (?!) Akiva Goldsman has the guts to take a rather intruiging life story, butcher it, and candy-coat it to make a 'nice little movie'.<br />If only Academy Award winner (?!) Ron Howard had made this a Rated R film and included the more intimate details of Nash's life, it would have been MUCH better.<br />Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, and Ed Harris do their best with 2-dimensional characters. I'm glad that Denzel won the Oscar for his flawless performance in TRAINING DAY, for Russell Crowe's performance was too lumpy and inconsistent. And although she had a smaller part, I think that Marisa Tomei should have won the Oscar for IN THE BEDROOM. Jennifer Connelly is an outstanding actress (see REQUIEM FOR A DREAM), but she is given absolutely NOTHING to do here, except forward the plot. And finally, we have Ed Harris, who is stuck in a role that amounts to nothing.<br />The biggest problem I had was not with the film but with the Academy of Motion Pictures, Arts &amp; Sciences.  In March 2002, the Academy gave Ron Howard the Best Director Oscar statuette, when he clearly did not deserve it.  Consider the competition.   With GOSFORD PARK, Robert Altman successfully juggled 23 celebrated actors and created two equally vivid worlds: the British aristocrats and their servants.  With BLACK HAWK DOWN, Ridley Scott used his inventive genius to display the raw power of war.  With MULHOLLAND DRIVE, David Lynch made the audience feel as if they were in a sustained, surreal nightmarethat they could not wake up from. And with THE LORD...RINGS and MOULIN ROUGE, Peter Jackson and Baz Luhrmann (whom, shockingly, did not even score a nomination) transport the viewers into worlds they have only dreamed of.  But, quite frankly, Howard's direction is very bland.  It is good, but there is nothing very special about it.  This is not to say, however, that Howard is not a great director.  He is, but this was a simple misfire.
B000002URV|5.0|Hear me out on this one. Or better yet hear Enigma. This is a fantastic amalgamation of ancient religious, modern space-age, new age psyche, electronic ambience all blended into an audio aphrodisiac like you've never tasted before. There have been copycats, but there is only one Enigma. This CD was meant to be experienced, not merely heard. The sounds of this disc are haunting and emotive and will take your mind and heart to secret places if you let it...and feel free to let your body enjoy the ride as well. There are slow liquid pieces to drift away with and deep throbbing rhythms to move in time with. All of it is layered in a mixture of otherworldliness, choral voices, and soft sexy interludes of kinky French dialogue. This is more than music to hear -- it's music to eat with your heart and mind and body. Turn down the lights, slip into something a little more personal, slide this CD in, give your lover that special smile, and let erotic passion do the rest. Whether you smoke or not, after listening to this album you'll need a cigarette...
B000069AUI|4.0|Yes, Parachutes was good, but admit it. You thought they were gonna be another here today gone tomorrow band. Boy, were we all wrong. They defy all odds with this album, and say to the world that they are here to stay. Sure, Parachutes was cute as most freshman albums should be with it's catchy love song &quot;Yellow,&quot; but if you are expecting this album to be in the same tradition as Parachutes prepare yourself for an awakening. This album is much more mature. The lead singer was quoted having written hald of this album after 9/11 so it is much darker and hopeless, but it is contrasted and complemented by the songs written before 9/11 and are much happier. I think this is a strong sophormoric effort, and I look forward to their next albums.
B000067DNC|5.0|everything is better than current star trek now days.  i didn't watch this show until a couple of years ago and as soon as i started, i was addicted.  of course i hadn't seen any of the first several seasons.  i have just finished watching season 2 and it is great.  season 1 was great.  i love this show and i recommend it to anyone who feels like star trek just doesn't live up anymore.
B00006IUL7|5.0|One of the year's best films so far. Al Pacino at his best and the awesome talent of Robin Williams combined with Christopher Nolan's precision direction will keep your finger away from the pause button. MUST SEE!
B00000I07R|5.0|After way too long without a Bon Jovi release, they came out with Keep the Faith and although it was a little different than their previous releases, with the title hit Keep the Faith, it was an uplifting and real rocker!
B00005RYLE|5.0|... I'll try and keep it short.<BR>The cover is beatifull and the artwork inside is very simmilar to that of the 'real' necronomicon. The only remark I have is that the prologue page should maybe be in the back of the book or in the included booklet, because..... well It breaks the magic a bit when you over the book.<BR>The DVD is super! Very nice menu's, all is a feast for eye. The extra's are good. I highly recommend the Commentary version by Bruce Campbell, I thought it was hilarious. So just buy the ... thing. And for those who've already seen 10.000 times. It looks marvellous on coffee tables or bookshelves! I speak from experience.<BR>Join Us................. Join Us........................... ...
B00003CX5P|1.0|Let me start by saying that I, as a teen in 1977, fell completely in love with the first STAR WARS.  Everything worked and everyone loved it.  I enjoyed THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK until it stopped: it didn't end, it just stopped.<br />When I sat through RETURN OF THE JEDI in 1983, I was surrounded by little kids who ran straight out of the mall theatre to the nearby toy store to buy their own cuddly, adorable Ewoks and Yodas...then I gave up.<br />Twenty years later--which I thought would've been plenty of time to think and rethink the series--I go see THE PHANTOM MENACE.<br />As much as I disliked the toy commercial that was RETURN OF THE JEDI, at least there were interesting characters showing up once in a while.  I understand they pretty much stood around in the background while muppets fought and drooled, but they were there.  PHANTOM actually made the human characters the LEAST interesting characters in the movie.<br />The pod race, which everyone said was the highlight, came off like an expensive video game (watch the chariot race in BEN-HUR for some genuine excitement).  Jar Jar Dink or whatever his name was is easily the most annoying non-character I've ever seen in a movie (Joe Pesci in the LETHAL WEAPON sequels is in second place).  Everyone looks bored.<br />The low point: sitting in the theatre to the bitter end (my wife had walked out to shop in the mall halfway through since she couldn't stay awake), watching digital armies of robots fight digital armies of frog-things and not one human being in sight.
B00005NWM3|2.0|Being a fellow Canuck I was very happy to see a Canadian band kick into the U.S. market and sell some records. But after buying Silver Side Up, I realize that no matter how much a record sells, dull is dull, and that's what Silver Side Up is, dull.<br />Every song on this record basically sticks to the alt-rock rulebook for mainstream success. There's the anguish lyrics, then the raspy voiced singer (who all sound like Cher) and add in a nifty guitar solo and you get commercial alt-rock gold.<br />The songs seem to have been built rather then played. The band doesn't sound that tight as a four-piece and the overall repetitive style of the record just turns all the tunes into one big garble. <br />What's so sad about Nickelback is they appear to have more to offer than what Silver Side Up delivers. First of all Too Bad and How You Remind Me are quality, catchy pieces of pop rock - no matter what you think of the record there is a reason it sold millions. Also, when you look back to songs off the band's last record such as Breath and Leader Of Men, you realize these guys have talent.<br />As a longtime follower of Our Lady Peace I've marveled at how fans have called OLP sellouts with the release of Gravity. Well to any OLP fan accusing them of that, I say listen to Silver Side Up and you'll realize what a band making a run for the riches really sounds like.
B000066AXC|1.0|This is the most terrible mass-appeal ... film in quite a while. Why? Because it's pretending to be something it's not. Couldn't you have guessed that already from the pretentious title? <BR>When people are watching this it's like \\"let's marvel at the amazing ... and feel sorry for his perpetually tormented psyche.\\" yay. Whoever feels they've learned something from watching this film, or been profoundly moved, they're seeing something (substance) which is not really there. Academy Awards' best film of the year, based on the true story of a great man and mathematician, the amusing thrills of his building hallucinations and the mystery of what's real and what's not, thus sharing the confused point of view with Nash - how could it not be great?<BR>Well, I found it impossible to suspend my disbelief that this was anything more than a produced and manufactured film written at the level of a young adult fiction story which was meaningful in clothing but a stick figure underneath...or something...<BR>There's just nothing there. I don't know what else to say.<br />Yeah, you people feel sorry for Nash when you watch this. But if you met the real Nash you wouldn't be nearly so sympathetic. That really makes me mad. Leave the people you consider 'different' ... alone if all you want is entertainment and not actually be interested in learning anything (whether it be in an emotional, philosophical, artistic or informative sense) or at least be real with them.<br />This ...movie was a hit and won 4 Academy Awards. ...Beautiful Mind is misleadingly presented as if it were a deep film or something. It's quite anger-inspiring, like a high school cheerleader girl who feigns confidence but is secretly insecure.<BR>And most people don't even notice she's pretending.<br />I bet few people will find this review helpful.
B00006FXB6|4.0|I bought the new record as soon as I saw it in some guitar magazine. Who is Dave Grohl? Is this a history band? Everyone in this QOTSA has been in a great number of bands. The album has some great songs on it. There is no stairway to heaven or system of a down song which makes it much cooler. I fell in love with First It Giveth. I think No One Knows is the first song from the album that i will get my band to cover for fun. I would suggest putting this album on at night and turning it up to infinity. Guitars, Bass, Drums, Voices is what makes this album. If you want some pretty boy who lives at mom's to make you some music on his expensive computer don't come here. The record is a lot more focused than last(if that means anything). Buy Buy Buy Buy Buy this one. This music is made by people for the people.
0375707972|1.0|First of all, this is not a \\"touching love story.\\"  This is the story of a 15-year-old boy and his raging hormones who becomes sexually invovled with a 36-year-old woman.  The woman manipulates him physically and emotionally.  The boy becomes obsessed with her; this obsession lasts until her death, and beyond.  Very sick, very sad.<br />    As you most likely know from reading other reviews, it turns out that the woman, Hanna, is a Nazi war criminal.  One who left a bunch of Jewish women locked in a burning building to die.  Because if they all stampeded out in panic, how could she possibly control them?  And anyway, they were on their way to be killed, so what's the difference?  During her trial, she asks the judge, in all honesty, \\"what would you have done?\\"  She clearly has no concept of what she has done.  And you have the feeling she would do the exact same thing if she had it to do over again.<br />    In spite of all of this, the boy, now a man who has divorced his wife because she's not enough like Hanna (read: Not Hanna) soothes his former lover during her well-deserved time in prison by sending her cassettes of him, reading books to her.  Because, you see, she's illiterate.  Yes, this is the huge, shameful secret she's been hiding.  Not that she stood up to be counted with the Nazis.  Not that she helped to kill who-knows-how-many Jewish women.  She can't read or write.  Big deal.<br />     Aside from a slightly interesting bit about how the post-Third Reich generation of Germans might feel guilty (as well they might) this book reads like one long excuse for those who were \\"only following orders.\\"  Completely disgusting.
0316666343|5.0|I love to read novels and they are always written in one form, about their life. This one is written in past tense of her life and it is very refreshing. I love the persepective and it what just great! Dont listen to those other reviews they are putting it down, it a short read and its goes very fast cause you are so interseted in seeing what happens next. So go get it and ENJOY!
B000000W5L|5.0|Rock and roll is not supposed to be a perfect music; its very structure allows for and even welcomes inconsistencies and imperfections.  Its greatest moments are unplanned, unespected, unpredictable ones -- such as Elvis on the Milton Berle Show, slowial, elegiac performance on the roof of the Apple building, or Jimi Hendrix's literally incendiary performance at the Monterey Pop festival.  Yet these ragged, imperfect moments achieve a kind of perfection in and of themselves, and become classic cases of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts.<br />Add to them the Rolling Stones' \\"Exile on Main Street.\\"  It's an album that shouldn't work; it's an overloaded, underproduced, self-indulgent, and sprawling mess.  And my god, does it rock.  Something about this album, with its disparate collection of songs, its buried-in-the-mix vocals, its aura of magnificent ruin, is just so all-encompassing and cohesive that it becomes more than you expect.  The songs, so very differrent from one another, flow organically from one to the next; each seems preordained somehow, and the album gains power and momentum as it goes along, until at its end you know you've heard one of the greatest collections of music in the moder era.<br />It helps that Exile starts with the most powerful one-two punch in rock:  The crunchy, dirty \\"Rocks Off,\\" with its unbeatable riffing and horn-driven chorus, and \\"Rip This Joint,\\" without a coubt the hardest rock song the Stones ever performed, and which is criminally underplayed on the radio.  After these two songs the listener is hooked, and willing to listen to whatever wonders the band dishes up.<br />Those wonders include, in no partcular order:  \\"Sweet Virginia,\\" with its call-and-response chorus and countrified beat; \\"Torn and Frayed,\\" with its mournful tone and rushing power (even the slower songs on this album surge with energy); \\"Tumbling Dice,\\" with its unintelligible lyrics and lovely vocals; \\"Happy,\\" one of Keith Richards's best vocalperformances and hardest-rocking songs; \\"Sweet Black Angel,\\" an exquisite folk/soul ballad: \\"Ventilator Blues,\\" a dark, dramatic sweeping blast of Muddy Waters-esque crunch, which flows in an uncannily natural way into the gospel-tinged, drum-driven \\"I Just Want to See His Face\\"; the thrumming, unfortunately-named \\"Turd on the Run\\"; the heartfelt and hard-driving \\"Loving Cup\\"; the majestic and magnificent \\"Let It Loose\\"...I could go on, but I'm sure you get the point.  Exile is a bottomless treasure chest of great music, offering new sides of itself each time you listen to it, full of unexpected delights and ragged glories around every corner.<br />Most of all it is a band record, not an album by a bunch of musicians who happened to be in the same room together.  The Stones rarely functioned better as a unit than they did on Exile.  Each of them steps forward with something to contribute -- such as Jagger and Richards's beautiful harmonies on \\"Sweet Black Angel,\\" Bill Wyman's thundering bass lines on \\"Ventilator Blues\\" and \\"Soul Survivor,\\" and Charlie Watt's expertise on drums, notable on every song but best evidenced on tracks like \\"Sweet Virginia\\" and \\"I Just Want to See His Face.\\"  And then of course there's Mick Taylor, brought in to replace the late Brian Jones, and who's possibly the unsung hero of this album.  He has an intuitive understanding of the group's music, as witness his great slide-guitar work on \\"Happy\\" and \\"Sweet Virgina\\"; not a note is out of place.  Taylor's playing meshed so well with Keith Richards's, it's almost impossible to tell who's playing what.<br />Of course, part of this is due to the album's production values...or lack thereof.  Exile was recorded mostly in Keith's house in the south of France, under less-than-ideal conditions, using rented equipment and, occasionally, borrowed instruments.  The result was an album whose mix is...unusual, to say the least.  Vocals are often as not buried in the music, and hard to decipher; you can hear how well Mick is singing, but not always what.  \\"Tumbling Dice,\\" \\"Rip This Joint,\\" \\"Ventilator Blues,\\" and \\"I Just Want to See His Face\\" all suffer this fate.  Yet oddly, this doesn't detract from the songs themselves.  Though neither Jagger nor Richards intended this, mixing the vocals \\"down\\" as they did has the effect of treating them on an equal level with the other instruments on the tracks -- rather than making the music subordinate to the singer, as is so often the case today.  It also give the songs a delightful enveloping effect, by forcing you to concentrate a little harder than you normally would on what's being sung.  Before you know it you're so wrapped up in the music, you can't tear yourself away from it...though why you'd want to do so, I can't imagine.<br />As I said above, rock and roll is not supposed to be a perfect music, yet from its flaws and frazzled madness the Stones made an album that is as close to perfection as rock can come.  It is an album no other band could have made, and it is a peak in the Stones' career that they have since come close to, but never equaled.  Exile on Main Street should be in every serious rock fan's collection; without it, that collection will be forever incomplete...and imperfect.
B000002IHU|5.0|Great Ratt CD.. I like Out of the Cellar better but this is a must have CD. As for as 80's hair bands? Who cares.. It was the 80's; they'll be calling bands from the 2000's something dumb in 10 years too...GET OVER IT...<BR>Great guitar work!! ROCKS
068981528X|5.0|This is my four year old's favorite book.  It's a great twist on the classic story, with the pig as the bad guy this time.<br />The end of the story has the potential to be a sappy, sugary, group hug moment, but the author shows enough restraint to keep cynical adults from gagging.<br />The illustrations are wonderful.  Grab the book, it's a blast!

B00003CXFG|4.0|When the movie first came out in the theaters I payed it no mind.  I came upon it while surfing the channels on lazy Saturday afternoon.  I am a Sci/Fi fan but for some reason this one didn't grab me...at first.  I watched it that day, went out and bought it that evening.  I am now a Vin Diesel fan.  I do hope in the sequal that they go into more depth where Riddick is concerned.  They could go a million ways with him, and Diesel could pull it off.  Keep your eye on him, I see a gold statue that bears a resemblance to his profile.  Not bad for a poor kid from New York !...
B00005JKED|3.0|I've rarely seen a film with such a promising beginning go so terribly wrong at the end. The first half crackles with tension as the Denzel shows the ropes to the wet behind the ears new guy. <BR>The second half degenerates into typical Hollywood crap, with a formulatic ending and Denzel going over the top, as usual. If they had been able to keep the story as taught and gritty and Denzel as restrained as they were during the first half, it would have been one for the ages.
B000066I6N|5.0|Bought this album on the strength of the Youngblood's Darkness,Darkness hoping the rest would be at least as good.It is.Hendrix would appreciate the take on Hey Joe.I really enjoyed Plant and his musicians. Good stuff. Wish they had put their stamp on Procol Harum's A Salty Dog and included it here.

B00005NI5Y|5.0|When this album came out, I cried.  My 13 year old son doesn't get it, he's more 'N Sync.  But the music took me back to being a kid in the 50s, listening to Hank Williams and Buddy Holly.  I really didn't think ol' Bob had music like this in him anymore.  Listen to &quot;Summer Days&quot; or &quot;Highwater.&quot;  The fiddle/violin on &quot;Floater.&quot;  This goes way beyond that &quot;wild mercury sound&quot; he had going for him back in 1966.   This is beautiful, man.
0345446798|5.0|You know how it feels to have one of those &quot;ah-HAH!&quot; moments?  Be prepared for lots of them while you read this wonderfully entertaining book.  Dr. McConnell knows how to educate!  Keep the student interested &amp; enjoying the learning process while you deliver your message ... and she does it cover to cover.  This is truly a can't-put-it-down book, full of Truth with a capital &quot;t&quot;.  If I could recommend a &quot;must read&quot; first book for dog-owners/lovers, this one would be it.
B000060OFT|5.0|To those who say that this murders the \\"original\\" play, I would ask them to consider what Shakespeare's reaction to this would be. Would he have preferred for his plays to stay locked in a tradition which becomes less and less accesible to a modern generation, meaning effectively that his plays are no longer enjoyed by the majority? Or would he prefer for the legacy of his great works to be continued by an update that fantastically and cleverly brings everything to our own times?<br />The whole genius of this film is that the lines ARE kept intact, that this is still THE original, and yet we are still allowed to believe that this is modern. The lines are spoken as if this were how people talk to each other these days, and the clever touches such as the 'sword' guns that allow the script to be kept intact are what makes this movie such a delight.<br />Shakespeare was a pioneer in his time, and so it is only fit to give his plays a pioneering makeover. Shakespeare's scripts are deliberately left open to interpretation in that there are few stage directions, just the lines, and this is how he would have wanted it to be. This defies every expectation, challenged you to think about what the essence of Shakespeare is? Romeo and Juliet is always called timeless. It is because we may interpret it that it is so.
B00006FXB6|5.0|This cd absolutely rocks!!!!  This DVD just makes it so much sweeter so buy it now while that extra is there.  Just an all around amazing CD as a whole.  BUY IT NOW if you are sick of all of the processed garbage that is being churned out lately.  You wont be dissapointed
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge is a fantastic film. It is so ridiculous that it is brilliant. To begin with, I worried that it was simply going to be a 'let's make this silly and it'll be called good' kind of film, but it has plot, brains and emotion behind all its glitsy, loud fanfare (and let's face it, there's a lot of that). Good performances from both leads and lots of good individual characters guarenteed to raise a smile. <br />Good singing, with the hilarity of Luhrmann seemingly trying to incorporate every song he ever enjoyed into just a few sequences. Several of these songs are re-interpreted originally and hilarious way (the version of the Police's 'Roxanne' springs to mind). <br />This really is as everyone says a multimedia experience. It's a hilarious but also touching, overblown, clever film in classic Luhrmann style. Excellent.
0451627768|3.0|Darwin's &quot;Origin of Species&quot; is in fact an abstract of a 20 volume thesis containing the evidence gathered over many years which support the concept of evolution by natural selection. This way of describing the evolution of organisms on earth has by now become the standard and, in fact, one hardly ever thinks of evolution without automatically connecting it with Darwin's ideas. <br />At first, upon commencing reading this small book, I continued to ask `where is the evidence for that' but on realising that he had gathered a large volume of data to support this theory I simply continued to read on. Its not either an easy read or that complicated. Darwin looks at evolution in a very comprehensive way: first, linking the main idea with the variation of animals under domestication, something he himself had extensively studied in the case of pidgeons; second, associating this with variation under nature and the struggle for existence; he then goes on to describe in detail natural selection and the laws of variation. He follows this like any good scientist by an analysis of what may be the theory's weaknesses, such as the scarcity in the geological record and the lack of organisms in a state of gradation. He then applies the ideas to instinct, hybridism and then discusses in great depth the imperfections of the geological record. He also considers how geographical distribution can alter the results of evolution  and how the embryos of various animals have a resemblance to that of other animals and how they also appear to repeat previous evolutionary steps as they mature.<br />Its too bad the 20 volume set was never published, even the incomplete version would have been better than only the abstract. Nonetheless it is well discussed and written as a comprehensive summary of the main thesis. At times the style can be repetitive and even dull but this is compensated for by fascinating little excerpts which are present throughout. This was, remarkably enough, my first reading of &quot;The Origin of Species&quot; and I do believe that every practicing scientist should read it as part of their education rather than accepting its tenets without question as is the wont. However rather than being a description of the true origin of species, it actually takes a change which occurs (by whatever means) and then describes the process the species undergoes from then on. Darwin never actually said anything about how new variations are formed, this was left for others to consider and eventually led to the modern Darwinian thesis including the idea of mutation caused by radiation, viruses or chemical agents. Much has also come to light over the last century such as the symbiosis of organisms producing the merger of cell and mitochondria seen in every cell today and similarly the recent evidence of gene swapping going on between bacteria and now also larger organisms, see &quot;Lamarck's Signature&quot; by Ted Steele. Since Darwin did also not explain form but rather the possibility of how form came about Brian Goodwin's Form and Transformation is a good place to start.<br />It must also be remembered that in his time the thesis was new even if many others were working on similar ideas Darwin was the first, in conjunction with Wallace, to expand on natural selection and obtain strong evidence for it. An essential read for any scientist.
0316666343|3.0|This book was not chosen for our Book Group selection, however, everyone in my book group had read it and loved it, so I went off to find a copy. <br />At first, I was VERY impressed with the storyline. It wasn't your \\"run of the mill\\" murder mystery. There was a definite need to know what happened to Mr. Harvey, but I felt that somewhere during the latter 1/3 of the book, there seemed to be a bit of a diconnect in what was written and what I desperately needed to read. I felt letdown. <br />Perhaps the letdown was a result of all the hype I had heard. Maybe my expectations were too high? All in all it was a good read, but I didn't find the sense of calm that I had hoped to by story's end.
B00003ETOW|4.0|I saw this version of Jane Eyre in China when I was a teenager in early 80's.  I had read the book by then and was overwhelmed by the great performance of George Scott and Susannah York. I felt that they played Rochester and Jane just as exactly as I imagined.  The music score was great throughout and it truly expressed the spirit of the characters and the story.  I have never forgot the main theme for the past twenty some years. This is one of my all time favorite films.<BR>However, I have to say that the DVD quality is terrible.  At least two scenes are missing in the DVD version.  The pictures are too dark and blurred.  What a pity!  <BR>But, no matter what, I still love this version of Jane Eyre.
0066211697|5.0|Francoise Sagan is a brilliant French writer, who here has written an intriguing novel about a young lady's 'coming-of-age' while on holiday by the sea. What I appreciate about Sagan's works most of all is her style. She writes very subtly, almost tenderly at times, but what comes out of these impressions is incredible clarity into the inner human workings and spirit. She deals with huge and incredibly moving emotional matters and life-changing experiences with such grace. Perhaps only French writers writing in French can do this (but this English translation maintains some of the original affect). It's like the hidden waters of the subconscious are feeding Sagan's stories, and especially 'Bonjour Tristesse' with eternal messages about life, love, fear, uncertainty, and Destiny. The parvenu paramour in 'Bonjour Tristesse' finds love without becoming jaded by the experience. Yet, she leaves us with elegiac afterthoughts. This is just brilliant literature.

0767830555|4.0|It's better than the average movie, but not his best.  I would have liked to see him do a little more after he &quot;flipped out.&quot;  But a very good movie with all very good actors and actresses.
0446310786|3.0|The story \\"To Kill a Mocking Bird\\" is basically a story about the way of life in a time of suspicion, hatred, poverty, and ignorance. It's about the effect of racism has on a small town from a child's point of view. The town is called Maycomb with \\"grass that grows as tall as a person, roads of dirt, and children with none, sometimes or disgusting eating habits.\\" The main characters are Atticus, Boo Radly, Scout, Jim and Dill. I liked Boo Radly. He stayed hidden for many years.   I don't know if he really did, what the town said he did; that he stabbed his father in the leg with scissors and then pulled it out. Boo placed wax dolls and food in the hollow tree and in exchange received candy from Scout, Jem, and Dill. Atticus the father of the children heads into a major problem as a lawyer defending Tom Robinson who is accused of assault and rape on a town woman.   The children had many difficulties dealing with Ms. Doubtly's craziness from drug use. Seeing their dad being ridiculed by the town as he was trying to achieve justice for Tom Robinson also made their lives more complex.                       <BR>The characters I could relate to were Atticus, Scout, Boo Radly, and Dill. Boo Radly reminded me of events in my life when I was not wanted in places like school and church, Where Boo was stuck in a hole, I felt I was stuck somewhere as well. Just as Atticus stands up for human rights and believes in himself, I stand up for my rights as well as the rights of my friends. Dill is a character that has a wild imagination just like I find myself having a wide variety of ideas.    <BR>My favorite part of the book is when Boo Radly saved Scout and Jem from Bob Edwell. As well, I thoroughly enjoyed the part where Bob Edwell is twisted crimes were exposed and he was killed accidentally.<BR>  For the educational and symbolic idealism the book deserves a medal. The book exposes and illustrates hard reality in a time when people were racist. My least favorite part of the bookwas when Tom Robinson was killed because he was killed by hate. It was as if he was going to die anyway whether a public execution or not. From a student's point of view, I would change the use of the n word so readers don't have to see it.<BR> I would recommend this book to as an insight and perspective on history. The type of person who would like this book would be a person who enjoys reading history, a suspenseful novel, or a person who likes to read about problems in the past.
0316666343|5.0|Nothing is perfect. I enjoyed it. And, if you enjoyed Alice Seebold's creative fiction fantasy &quot;Lovely Bones&quot;, maybe it's just me, but I think you'll love Norman Thomas Remick's creative nonfiction fantasy &quot;West Point...&quot;. If you are one of those naysayers of &quot;Lovely Bones&quot; who liked the presentation idea but not the storyline, I suggest that you might appreciate Remick's book which a similar presentation idea, but a storyline that is from real nonfictional history. Nevertheless, don't just go by what I say. Get the books and see for yourself.

B000068QY7|1.0|I thought that after Oasis had stopped, that was the end, the nightmare was over. But no.<BR>NOT ONLY ARE THEY RIPPING OFF THE BEATLES, THEY ARE NOW RIPPING OFF U2.<BR>The Oasis single, &quot;Stop Crying Your Heart Out&quot; has way too many similarities with U2's &quot;Walk On&quot;. Just listen to Walk On and then listen to Stop Crying Your Heart Out. Snap. Oasis were ripping off the greatest rock&amp;pop band of all time, the Beatles, now they are ripping off one of the greatest bands of this time. Who will be used by Oasis to pay off their money debts next?<br />I would advise anybody reading this not to ever buy an Oasis album and support yobs living off other bands to become famous.
0780624890|5.0|This movie was definitely a winner. Nonstop hung jaw action. Wesley Snipes at his best. Blade, (Snipes) is a vampire bent on<br />revenge for his mothers death. He, along with his mentor and friend Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) wage a bloody and hitech war<br />against the vampire nation. This is one vampire movie that will<br />have you lusting for blood.

B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones can proudly stand with the best of the great blues and jazz favourites such as Nina Simone, Ella Fitzgerald, and Sarah Vaughn, just to name a few. But keep in mind she is definitely the new and updated version! <br />Her soft silky voice will lull you into moods of pure bliss and happiness, you can't help singing along, with maybe a bit of close dancing on the side! She truly knows how to create a feeling within you with her talents.<br />Not only is she a gifted singer, but also an accomplished pianist, which you'll hear on this CD, not to mention the composer of alot of what you'll experience on &quot;Come Away With Me&quot;.
B000002H72|5.0|This album is pretty amazing because it came out in 1989 when other bands were not even thinking of making music like this.  This band's music was an incredible influence on a countless number of bands from the nineties so it is no wonder that this sounds like it came from the early nineties.  Kurt Cobain said that they were trying to create an album that sounded like \\"Doolittle\\" when they made \\"Nevermind.\\"  He also said, \\"I wanted to write the perfect pop song, but then I realized that the Pixies had already done it.\\"  I am almost positive that he is referring to \\"Here Comes Your Man\\" in this quote.  Black Francis has one of the most original vocal styles of all time.  He screams on most of the tracks and it is somewhat jarring if you have never heard it before.  But it is brilliant because it makes the lyrics so much more powerful.  The lyrics themselves are sometimes a bit of a mystery because you feel that Francis is leaving something out.  When Francis does sing it is quite pleasant because he has a nice voice.  Kim Deal is also another singer with an instantly recognizable voice.  Whenever they sing together they provide some of the most beautiful moments on the entire album.  But this is not a beautiful album.  I would describe it more as an album that slaps you in the face and forces you to listen. I have owned this album for two days and I have found that is growing on me every time I listen to it.  It gets better with every listen.  Every track is good and some tracks are outstanding.  Some highlights and beautiful moments include: \\"Debaser\\" - no wonder Pixies fans voted this their favourite song of all time, \\"Wave of Mutilation\\" - anyone for surfing?, \\"I bleed\\" - Francis and Deal's duet is quite beautful, \\"Here comes your man\\" - see Kurt Cobain, \\"Monkey Gone to Heaven\\" - excellent song that is environment-conscious, \\"Mr. Grieves\\" an infectious beat they create on this track, \\"La La Love You\\" - a simple yet effective love song that shows how Santiago is abrilliant guitarist by his minimal yet melodic guitar licks.  This album is brilliant...I'm amazed...you have to experience it for yourself.
B00000099Y|1.0|The biggest complaint about so-called \\"art-rock\\" is that it is usually neither. Aenima fits this. It tries hard to be art, but anything trying to be a great work of art will undoubtedly fail. The finest works of any artistic merit were created to say something, to provide some sort of insight into a specific or oblique idea, as a logical step forward in exercising craft, or as pure accidents. <BR>Aenima hasn't the specifics to say anything important or provide insight into anything beyond Keenan's poetry chapbook; the lyrics are like those waves of sound from space that SETI engineers hear that they believe are messages from extraterrestrials: there seems to be a pattern, there seems like there should be a meaning, but ultimately there isn't any, they are just random-noise burst(with announcements). The words all seem to point toward a subject, a meaning, but most of them fall into confused generalities, so that we get no more than: \\"life sucks.\\" Frankly, most of the lyrics are dense and uninterpretable, while the ones that (I believe) can be interpreted (i.e. \\"Stinkfist,\\" \\"H,\\" \\"Hooker With a Penis\\") don't seem to be worth the effort. If a song doesn't speak to you, then it might as well not speak at all. And to the awesomely named juliuslazarus: believe me, I read some of the lyrics before I heard the songs, and went back to them after. I didn't find much. I'd whip out my English Literature major and apply it here, but that would bore everyone. \\"Jimmy\\" was the first song I ever read. Subjectively though I can't stand this album, I try to remain objective.<BR>In terms of craft, this WAS the next logical step, but what difference does it make? Tool are hardly the most musically adventurous band, and never were. They are good as rock musicians, but an exercise in instrumental virtuosity is typical what proves a progressive rock band, not the specific sound. They were a heavy metal band with some power chords and otherwise played farther down the guitar neck than usual, and dressing it all up with electronics was the style of the time, NIN having had huge success two years before. They are not art, and they can hardly qualify as rock either, despite the comparative simplicty of their instrumentation. Whatever your personal definiton of rock music, I believe that it has an energy which Tool perennially lacks, and an \\"earthiness\\" (define that) that the cold metallicism (not the heavy kind) and machine-like quality of Aenima and other Tool albums simply defeat. Playing in different time signatures cannot make you jazz or classical, and so you get stuck as \\"Hard Rock,\\" which is not the same as just plain old \\"rock.\\" <BR>And this was no accident. It sounds far too manufactured. Off of an assembly line in a utopian factory somewhere that also produces drill bits and Hondas.<BR>Give me life!
B000000W5B|5.0|If the songs on Goat's Head Soup had been released as sides 5 and 6 of Exile on Main Street, they would all be viewed as absolute Stones classics. &quot;100 Years Ago,&quot; &quot;Silver Train,&quot; and &quot;Hide Your Love&quot; are as good as anything on Exile (well, OK, not as good as Stop Breaking Down, but close). There is not a weak song from start to finish. The Stones &quot;winning streak&quot; did not stop at four!
B00004RF98|5.0|This is the best movie ever made!!! Gene Kelly is a genius!! He is so smooth and graceful when he dances. He makes it all look so effortless. Donald O'Connor is also a great dancer and his talent really shines through in this movie. A little movie trivia: Debbie Reynolds (Carrie Fisher's mom) was only 17 when filming began. She also was not a dancer, she had studied gymnastics. Gene Kelly taught her how to dance for this movie. Oh, to be taught by Gene Kelly!!!
0060922583|5.0|\\"The Holographic Universe\\" is a most excellent read. Mr. Talbot has explained difficult ideas in terms which are understandable, readable and fascinating. This is not religion nor is it an alternative, it provides some plausible solutions to questions our present science finds unanswerable. It was right up my alley and in my opinion worthy of five stars.
B00006AL1G|4.0|Very well made and entertaining documentary that fails only in it's representation of the true pioneers of the craft. Far too much time is spent on Bay Area DJ's (QBert, Shadow, etc.), and while those cats certainly deserved their propers, there is absolutely no mention of Philly legends like Cash Money, Jazzy Jeff or Spinbad. These guys were absolutely pivitol in elevating the art of scratching to new hights (I'd even go so far as to say it's tantamount to ommiting Louis Armstrong from a history of Jazz). My only other criticism is that I sometimes felt the filmmakers were a bit too ambitious with their subject matter. There are far too many angles to cover (the scratch dj, the beat digger, the producer, etc.) to cover each one succinctly within it's 90 or so minutes. I've heard that there were interviews with Cash Money and perhaps others that were left on the cutting room floor. Hopefully they show up on the DVD.
B00003CXAY|3.0|... and we all know what \\"sound and fury\\" signify, don't we?    The first two-thirds of Godfrey Reggio's \\"Life\\" trilogy are stunning sound-and-light shows, but anyone looking for real content should probably go elsewhere.    With respect to _Koyannisqatsi_, Philip Glass's score is the film's high point; it's a landmark of contemporary classical music.  You could watch this film with the picture off and not lose very much.  Reggio's photography is breathtaking, although the uniform beauty of his images tends to overpower any statement he intends to make with them.    Reggio's second project, _Powaqqatsi_, is in the same vein as _Koyaanisqatsi_, though it's a much slicker product overall.  The Glass score, though uneven, has moments of greatness; again, it's a milestone of American classical music, and the highlight of the film.  But the images have dated very badly.  I suspect the film is borderline racist as well; Reggio and Glass reduce residents of the Third World to ciphers in a grand argument against globalization -- which, unsurprisingly, also contains an anti-American component.
B000021YQV|4.0|Every once and a while there comes an album that is so incendiary and different that even the fickle mainstream cannot ignore it. Toxicity is one of those albums.... I was not exactly impressed by SOAD's self titled effort, but when I first laid my ears on Toxicity I knew it was something special. If so called \\"nu metal\\" had a masterpiece, an album that would define the genre for years to come, this is it. Toxicity is the Number of the Beast of modern commercial metal.<br />System of a Down very much prescribe to the school of \\"less is more\\". Daron Malakian's guitar riffs have a caveman quality to them, yet they add color to the song that senseless wanking never would. Unlike most of their contemporaries, they have a sound all their own and an original approach to song writing which includes (sometimes choppy) key changes and eastern influences. <br />This CD transcends genres, offering something for death metal, hardcore, punk, popular rock, and new wave fans alike... while remaining unique. You could file it under the progressive tag and be self assured, because it definitely marks a progression in popular music. <br />The groups Armenian background lends a hand in forging their sound, (see bridge to Deer Dance, Aerials) which often results in beautiful eastern melodies that sound perfectly at home in their frenetic blend of heavy music. To top everything off, Serj Tankian's vocals are refreshingly devoid of the Jonathan Davis or Maynard Keenan copycat complex most newer bands suffer from, furthering his status as a great frontman. <br />My favorite songs are Needles (which contains a groove even the most battle hardened hardcore kid would love), the absolutely brilliant Deer Dance, Jet Pilot, X (metal fans who doubt their heaviness, check this), Science (more greatness), Toxicity and ATWA. At first, their schitzophrenic stylings turned me off, but this CD grew on me like no other, untill it held a monopoly on my playlist for at least a solid week. Anybody who dismisses it in a similar way upon first listen, spend a little more time with it, you may end up falling in love.<br />Of course, there are a few throwout tracks, namely Psycho and Shimmy, and I find Aerials to be dull, but that's what skip buttons are made for. This CD is absolutely killer and it's staying power is proof that a good band CAN survive in today's world of redudant rapcore garbage
B00004VW0V|5.0|Cat Steven's Foreigner is a good album, albeit a bit grand and excessive (mainly due to the 18 minute title track that takes up all of Side 1 of the LP)<br />This fact is why not many consider this to be one of Cat's better albums.  <br />I beg to differ. While it is not his &quot;best&quot;, its creativity and instumentation, and different-ness make it very unique and worthy of repeated listenings.<br />Obvious highlight: the title track - with it's many tempos/moods. Other highlighs include: Hurt, and 100 I Dream.<br />Bottom line: get this after his more popular albums Tea For The Tillerman, Teaser &amp; The Firecat, Mona Bone Jakon, and Catch Bull At Four.
B000002UUX|5.0|For any fans of heavy metal in general, Rust in Peace is an essential addition to your collection. Let me explain... some albums are undeniably classic, music that will stand the test of time and continue to thrill people years and years after it's initial release. <br />Rust in Peace fits that criteria. Just about every song is a timeless metal classic, from the lightning fast intro to Holy Wars, to Polaris' closing notes. Mustaine and Friedman light up the proverbial sky with unrivalled guitar pyrotechnics, while Ellefson delivers his career performance. Come on, even the cover art rules. Along with Seventh Son, Master of Puppets, Sad Wings of Destiny, etc., RIP is one of those CDs that just NEEDS to be heard by anybody with a functioning pair of ears.<br />In 2002, Mustaine's sarcasm laced lyrics and commentary burn just as deep as they did 12 years ago, as does his seering riffage and tortured howl. Even inferior songs like Five Magics and Poison Was the Cure are great compared to most other metal releases of the time. Lucretia's 24? bar solo... Tornado of Soul's dept use of natural harmonics... Rust is a guitarists dream.<br />I don't know if I'd go as far as to say &quot;you are not metal until you own this&quot; but it's definitely a possibility! The production is a little lacking, but just turning everything up to ten and banging your head maniacally fixes that. Rust in Peace indeed.
B000058TDY|5.0|Cat's last pop oriented album, appropriately tited &quot;Back To Earth&quot; is a very good album, but a little on the light side.<br />It is a nice album to relax to, and not as keyboard drenched like its predecessor, Izitso.<br />There are many highlights including: Just Another Night, Daytime, and Never.  And there's really only one lowlight -- New York Times (the chorus sounds like a cheesy &quot;I Love New York&quot; commercial!).<br />A very good album as I said before, a nice calm way to go out as Cat Stevens!
0312117337|5.0|This is a very beautiful tarot set. For me, I use this tarot for spiritual consulting. I can't say how accurately the cards can give you the meaning. Unlike other Tarot, this card has one word, altogether 79 cards; therefore 79 words which are so uplifting and understandable. You don't even have to look at the manual to understand what is being laid out. <BR>The card gives really good advices, and points out problems which arises. Only you can know the meaning of the card itself. Its a must have for those who want spiritual consultations.
B000001EMW|4.0|If you are listening to this album, trying to hear an improvement on the Metallica originals, you won't find it.  However, if you want to really understand much of the real music, not the noise, of Metallica, this portrays it beautifully.  Coming from the other direction, if you are a classical fan, and you prefer pretty powerful classical, this is definitely for you.
B000001G8I|5.0|I have several copies of Mozart's Requiem K.626 and I have to say that this particular copy (as well as its counterpart--also by Deutsche Grammophon--that was later reprinted and sold at a budget price) is a very good performance: It doesn't have the token mark of Karajan to slow the piece down to a snail's pace and play out every note painfully...It might be my imagination but he seemed to have increased the speed of the Requiem as he grew older: listen to a copy of his '62 and compare it to any others that come after it to get the gist of what I mean.<br />If the listener is searching for a more ostentatious performance of the '626', he'd best search for one of the recordings done by Marriner (As he's still alive). Other conducters tend to fail in stressing the vocals; sometimes, in doing so, they botch up the quality of the overall performance by overpowering the strings forcing the timpani to compensate and fight for a place. As a result, everything gets too 'noisy'. Karajan gives the listener a good sample of one of his better Mozart performances here.
B00005JKQX|5.0|I made sure I had tissues with me when I saw this in the theater! The film is well done. Putting viewers into Nash's states of mind was to me an excellent use of audience manipulation in this context. Yes, there is much missing from the film-other facets of what some would call the \\"real\\" Nash. There is some triteness, such as the ending speech. But beautiful things don't have to be complicated to be authentic; the subject matter is intense on its own without dragging a lot of other issues into it. A lot is also acted, excellently, not just thrown at the viewer: Nash's contradicting feelings of superiority and inferiority, his difficulty with emotional connections to other people, his quirks, etc. Take the movie strictly on its own merits as a depiction of someone struggling with the loss of his greatest strength--his mind--to mental illness. Read the book to get more on the man. I'm reading the book now and highly recommend both the DVD and book.
B000001GPX|5.0|This recording is one of the best of symphonies 5 and 7.  It isn't too flashy, too fast, or too anything for that matter!  But it is wonderful. It doesn't matter how many recordings of these symphonies you have, this one is a necessity.
B00003CY6M|4.0|Sure, it stretches credibility some, but it's sort of supposed to.  All the talk of Fate and Destiny at work in a movie that demonstrates that there is no such thing as a coincidence. It's supposed to be far-fetched, and you're supposed to go along with it.<br />Assuming you do, you'll have a wonderful time, because this one's put together very, very well. Fine performances from Cusack and Beckinsale in the leads are nearly lost amid the excellent performance by the supporting cast: Jeremy Piven as the loquacious obituary-writer-best-man, Molly Shannon as the oddly \\"earthbound\\" new-ager, Eugene Levy as the obstinate store clerk, John Corbett as the free-spirited musician boyfriend, and even a small, uncredited cameo appearance from Buck Henry.<br />To describe the plot at all is to do this film a disservice.  Take it from me: if you like romantic comedies and you can play along with the premise (which isn't that big a stretch, really), you'll enjoy this film very much.
B00006AW2J|5.0|As you meander through this CD you will marvel at the young and fresh quality of Mick's voice.  And then it will strike you that the lyrics are so powerfully insightful.  \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" and \\"Street Fighting Man\\" are huge songs reflecting the time.  But they were huge commercial successes.  Is it chicken or egg, what came first?  Did they write this to be sell out amphitheaters or did they see and say something no one else was saying in this genre, forget the folkies.  And then we showed up.<BR>Doesn't matter.  Just listen.  There isn't any commercially viable and equivelant twenty-something boy band today getting near the incidieary nature of the topics the Boys chose here.  (What if Back Street/ Insynch wrote \\"Stray Cat Blues\\" instead of jerking around NASA.)<BR>Between the performance and the gravity of the words an amazing and timeless work of art.
B00003CXSP|3.0|Ridley Scott's sequel to the classic film Silence of the Lambs is a visually impressive but hollow follow up to Silence.<br />Anthony Hopkins (who won an Academy award for his role as Hannibal Lecter in the original) displays little of his presence that was so Oscar-worthy first time round, and Julianne Moore is no Clarice Starling. But Scott's visual style, which is what makes all his films so eminently watchable (Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator), and some expertly done sequences make up for its flaws.<br />Gary Oldman is great as the cop who's chasing the elusive cannibal and Ray Liotta has some nice scenes throughout the film.<br />But Hopkins has little to get his teeth into, and comes off as somewhat gauche. Impressive gun fights and some creepy moments with Oldman and Hopkins don't make up for the lack of suspense. A worthy, if sometimes unexciting entry into the franchise. The upcoming remake of RED DRAGON looks impressive, with Anthony Hopkins returning to the role for thr third time. Hopefully the next outing for one of cinema's greatest villian will better-written and more involving than Ridley's sequel.
B00005JKWJ|4.0|For those that liked the first Blade, this movie is for you.  It features Blade, taking on a new breed of vampire called the Reaper, which feed on humans and vampires.  The reapers are practically immune to all of blades attacks except one, and they reproduce like rodents.  This forces blade into an unlikely alliance with his most hated enemies, the vampires.  Gore and fun ensue.  I had to take off a star for the sometimes hokey CGI scenes (When Blade and Nyssa fight in front of the lights) that detracted from the movie.  The reapers mouths look like cooters, and are fittingly disgusting.
0385335482|5.0|I couldn't stop laughing because this is every girl I know rolled up into one very, very loveable character.  I didn't stop laughing much, especially at the antics that Becky goes through just to shop.  She has no shame about her love of shopping...okay, maybe a little.  When you have to remind yourself that these people do not exist, I think you've got a hit.
0151008116|5.0|I was hooked by the time I read the author's intro.  The first third of the book is about religion; the rest is about survival, courage, and redemption.  The voice is compelling.  I spent time reflecting on the messages, and haven't been able to put this book out of my mind.  I read our public library's copy, and promptly purchased a copy for my collection.
0446530573|5.0|The recipes are great, and this book is a must for any Sopranos fan. I know that I love cooking Italian food anyway before watching the show, and I keep an eye out to see what wines they're drinking. For example, in the famous scene where Janice gets rid of her finace Richie for punching her, there's a bottle of Ruffino Chianti on the table! This book makes it even easier to get into the mood.<br />A great way to enjoy delicious food and feel like you're part of the family!
0316666343|4.0|I didn't plan on reading this book because of all the hype around it, but I skimmed over the first chapter and haven't stopped.  Perhaps it's a little more compelling because the Everytown, USA Susie's story is set in is filled with the names of places I knew growing up.
B00006AW2M|4.0|I have always slammed this album, told everyone to avoid it, and only played it to remind me how bad it is.<br />BUT... that was hearing the original CD from 1986.<br />This is a good example of how bad sound can sometimes ruin the experience, even in &quot;rock n roll&quot;<br />If you are a Stones fan, buy this.  Try it again.<br />It's fun to hear them experimenting.<br />This album, regardless of song style, shows what great musicians they are.  Everything is played very well.<br />Give it anoterh spin!
B000069AUI|5.0|... simply perfect, a triumph! Just when you thought nothing could top Parachutes... standout tracks include \\"Rush..\\" \\"Politik\\" \\"Amsterdam\\" and the heartwrenching lyrics of \\"The Scientist.\\" This album must be experienced!
B000001ES9|3.0|This album should be taken for what it is, a debut of a group still in development.  Many of the songs have a &quot;live&quot; feel, like Rush had been playing them on their bar circuit before hitting the studio, and that gives this album a fresh exuberance and less clinical feel.<br />While Neal Peart may be missing, and the lyrics clearly demonstrate this, John Rutsey was a capable drummer.  Check out his work on &quot;What You're Doing&quot; and &quot;Working Man&quot;.  Of course, you can then compare it to the live tracks on &quot;All the World's a Stage.&quot;  But, this is a rock album, not a progressive concept album, although there are some cool jams.  This album was a good showcase for Alex Lifeson's guitar chops, prior to Geddy Lee developing a more melodic approach on his bass.<br />We kick off with &quot;Finding My Way&quot;, an excellent lead track with a cool guitar riff and some nice dynamics.  Two other standouts are &quot;What You're Doing&quot; with its rhythmic puzzles and &quot;In the Mood&quot; with it's line &quot;won't you come and talk with me, I'll tell you all my lies&quot;.  These are two of the first songs I learned when I picked up a bass guitar so many years ago.  The best cut is &quot;Working Man&quot;, a tune built around a good guitar riff and some great jamming that provides a view of things to come from this band.<br />The other songs are decent from an instrumental standpoint but not as memorable as the top four, although &quot;Here Again&quot; might be a sleeper.
0316666343|2.0|This book is very well written for the first few chapters. Alice Sebold does a great job of developing characters and starting a plot line.  Unfortunately this book should have been written as a short story, because after the main plot line develops in the first few chapters - nothing new happens.  This book remains very dismal until the end.  The mood about how a family deals with death is well developed in the first half of the book and regurgitated in every chapter after that.  Alice Sebold had many opportunities to liven up the book with some humor, but passed.  I would recommend reading the first half of The Lovely Bones and leave it at that.
B000062TU1|4.0|I am a HUGE fan of Harry Potter.. more like an obsessive freak and I'm 18. I found this movie so entertaining and enjoyable (gotta love Draco and Oliver Wood). But the DVD is a bit disappointing. It is meant to be for kids ONLY.<br />What I have been waiting in the DVD the most are interviews with the cast especially since Malaysia aired an interview once. And one more thing is \\"Behind the Scene\\" that should let you see the making of the movie and how the special effect was done. Additional outakes and extra deleted scene would be great. But no, they had to make all the stuff for kids apart from the 7 deleted scenes. I mean come on! I caught the snitch in less than 2 seconds, and solved the puzzle in less than 5 minutes to get to the deleted scenes.<br />There's also no commentary from the director, or the cast or from J.K Rowling, or any message from J.K Rowling.<br />I want to suggest that the second movie \\"Chamber of Secrets\\"' DVD, there should be more stuff for adults than for kids. Or better yet, make 2 seperate DVD for kids and adults so kids can have some interactive entertainment and adults could have all the interviews and stuff. Otherwise, the movie itself is awesome :-)! Should be longer though than just 2 and half hour.
B000002UUX|4.0|After hiring Marty Friedman, Mustaine wanted to show that he was talking and seriously and that Megadeth had come to stay! So, he released a &quot;virtuoso&quot; record, full of neck-breaking time-changes, rhythms and fury. As always, his vocals are utterly bad, but the music, oh, the music...! The best Megadeth has evee done!
0670880728|3.0|This was enjoyable, and an ok book to pass the time, but it isnt one of those suspensful, cant-put-down books.  It is very British..meaning if you are not familiar with british slang and geography, you are better off renting the movie.  <BR>     Everyone has a Bridget Jones in their lives.. someone who is neurotic, insecure and compulsive.  So it is easy to relate to her and you will find your self rooting for her to succeed.  It has a handful of good laughs and it is written well.  Personally I would rather read a book that makes you turn the pages and  cant wait to see how it ends.  This is not one of them.
0792843835|5.0|I recently saw this movie on the Sundance Channel on cable.  I was so taken by it I obtained the DVD.  The quality of the picture was even better.  This movie is very moving and enjoyable.  &quot;I'm calling you&quot;, the movies title song is hypnotic.  I have watched the movie countless times and enjoy it more each time I see it.  I also obtained the movie soundtrack on cd.  It has all the songs from the movie and a narrated version of the movie by Percy Adlon.  If you like quirky but thought proving films, definitely get this one!
B0000636UN|2.0|I've been a fan of Sheryl's music ever since she came out with her smash album TUSEDAY NIGHT MUSIC CLUB. She had a knack for creating some fun, catchy pop/rock treats with a quick wit and some irony attached. Sadly it seems like Sheryl threw out all of her charm for this bland C'MON, C'MON. After the toe-tapping \\"soak up the sun\\" I couldn't wait to get my hands on C'MON, C'MON but the rest of this CD really struggles. <br />After \\"soak up the sun\\" it all goes downhill. The lyrics, production.. just everything. When I first listened to this CD I was very surprised as to how watered-down Sheryl seems. Don't be fooled by the sunny photos and the sunny first single. C'MON, C'MON is Sheryl's most depressing work yet. She states in \\"steve mcqueen\\" that she wants to \\"rock & roll the party\\" but she doesn't. C'MON, C'MON is mostly loaded with depressing mid-tempo ballads. Sheryl Crow lost all of her wit and charm with this lame CD. <br />1. Steve McQueen 2/5<BR>2. Soak Up The Sun 5/5<BR>3.

0553381687|5.0|I admit that at first I wasn't sure what I was getting into when I got this book. I was looking for an epic adventure to read. This stood out on the bookshelf and my dad recommended it when I was thinking about it. He runs a bookstore. He ought to know what's what. This is a pretty good story. It's well-written and thoughtful. The characters are wholly believable and details good.
0316666343|4.0|As a sister of a surviving sexual assault victim I have to say the main theme of the story,how a family survives the rape and death of a child, is probably the truest I have read. Although the subplots are occasionally unsatisfying, the frustration, disallusionment and sorrow felt by Susie's family is very touching. As in life there is only the outside fascade of happy family life until the unexpected exposes all the fissions in its foundations.<br />Although many other reviewers do not feel empathy for the mother in the story I felt she presented a very real reaction to tragedy. The desire to \\"run away\\" or \\"escape\\" the reality of the situation even if that means abandoning everything that was good to escape the one terrible thing that has happened. This is only one plot of a many layered story. Whether you can relate to the mother, the sister, the brother, the father, the boy friend or friend every perspective is presented with integrity and empathy.<br />It is a very emotional read and in light of the recent child abductions one that feels eerily timely. I would recommended even to the younger set of 13yrs. and up as no doubt the dangers of abduction and assault are prevalent on their minds. Does however contain some graphic violence and sexually situations.
B00000JGHM|4.0|This superbly executed crime drama reinterprets in a modern style a classic tale of two men, a cop and a criminal, sharing an obsession to fulfill their linked destinies, and connected by a strange bond that ultimately brings them in a showdown that cannot be but fatal for both, even if one remains alive. Indeed, the final scene brings in mind the ending of Inagagi's Samurai III - Duel at Ganryu Island, where the character Musashi Miyamoto finally conquers his nemesis, only to lament that \\"I will never again face an enemy like him\\".<br />The relationship of the two men - superbly played by Al Pacino and Robert de Niro - reminds one of the bond between the analogous characters in Melville's Le Cercle Rouge (unfortunately unavailable as DVD). The strange affinity of the chaser and the chasee, the existential angst that drives them on, the unbearable strength of the fate that denies freedom of action or woman's love, are just a few of the characteristics shared by the two movies - characteristics shared by even older classics such as the unforgettable Grand Illusion.<br />While obviously paying homage to these great films, the director Michael Mann sets the familiar saga in a modern form, and in so doing turns some essential elements around in opposite external form. The central all-silent robbery scene of Melville - itself copied from Dassin's Rififi - now becomes a spectacular, extremely noisy shooting spree, and the wet and dark streets of Paris are now replaced by dazzling views of the lighted nightly Los Angeles.<br />The result is one of the essential movies of the 90's. It transcends the crime genre, just like its great predecessors did. Don't miss it, and don't expect to see just another action film or crime saga - Heat has much more to offer to a movie lover.
1563890119|5.0|In rereading this first volume of the Sandman stories after so long a time, it hit me both how much the character evolved, as well as, how much stayed the same. Indeed, you actually have hints and echos of the ultimate fate of Morpheus in this first book.<br /><br /> In the first part, \\"Sleep of the Just\\", you might be forgiven for thinking of Morpheus as some sort of vengeful, dream vampire- a lord of nightmare over dreams. Already in \\"Imperfect Hosts\\", you find introduced the triple goddess who will later figure so prominently in the dream king's fate many volumes later in \\"the Kindly Ones.\\" In \\"Dream a Little Dream of Me\\" we get our first hint of the depth of compassion and mercy of the character. This is followed by the revelation in \\"A Hope in Hell\\" that the king of dreams must also of necessity be the giver of hope to mankind (i.e. even Lucifer acknowledges that without the ability to dream of heaven, hell itself would have no hold on it's inmates.) Then, in \\"Passengers\\" and \\"24 Hours\\", we have, frankly, the most horrendous, sadistic, sickening, blood bath in the history of D.C. Comics. Then, all is put right by Morpheus in \\"Sound and Fury\\", as a demonstration of the difference between a wise and compassionate Lord of Dreams, and the Insanity of a true Lord of Nightmare. The character of Morpheus is now firmly and sympathetically established. Finally, in \\"The Sound of Her Wings\\", we meet the first of Dream's family- beautiful, compassionate, humorous, Death. We also get just a hint of the dissatisfaction and ennui that will ultimately guide Morpheus's fate.<br /><br /> If you have never read this series of the finest of graphic literature, then I envy you. You have nine more volumes that will rivet your attention and transport you to another world- the world of dreams.
0790729628|1.0|I hate when someone totally rips apart a movie &quot;I&quot; like but...WAKE UP EVERYONE! This movie has three things going for it:<BR>1) Harrison Ford<BR>2) Awesome &quot;visuals&quot;<BR>3) A dramatic and beautifully orchestrated ending<BR>And that's about it. I can't believe I bought this movie. I bought it based on you people's reviews. I found this movie to be no more than an excuse to use lots of cool sets and neon lights, and to make droves of incessant movie-going lemmings with derelict senses of filmmaking go write reviews of praise on the internet so sorry chumps like me would go by it too.<BR>Well, thanks.
0440234743|5.0|John Grisham does not have a reputation for being a great artist, but I thought he did well in this book in going beyond simple villainy and heroics.  There are no real bad guys in The Testament -- just people like you and I, who are overcome by their passions.  Resembling great writers in this respect at least, Grisham picks up a mirror and shows us ourselves, using the story to examine the nature of good and evil.  This is a relief from a lot of modern story-telling, which would be embarrassed to admit any such bourgeois categories, or that heroism does not need a touch of the power of the Dark Side to be truly effective.  <br />Grisham's missionary hero in this book has been criticized as too good, but I recognized real female missionaries I have met in his portrait of Rachel (see The Inn of the Seventh Happiness, To a Different Drum, or Goforth of China, for real-life examples).  Anyway, what is wrong with taking as your heroine a person who is not only strong (like Dirty Harry or Arnold Schwarzeneggar, who do not resemble anyone I have met) but also a really caring and virtuous person?  <br />But Grisham's stories are primarily driven by plot, (he hasn't turned into Dostoevsky, don't worry) and the plot here is a doozy.  I planned to read a chapter or two a night, but scrapped that idea half way through the book.  All in all, I enjoyed the book very much.  (Perretti's slightly darker, and slightly more supernatural, Visitation is good, too.)
B00006HBUA|1.0|I'm not the most moral or upright person in the world, but I have to say the garbage that Hollywood is making shouldn't be shown to anyone under the age of 16. PG movies have become riddled with so many different innuendos it's really ashame. Even if children don't understand the underlying messages, it is still wrong. Besides being a teeny-bopper movie in disguise, it was boring and badly executed anyway. If you want to take children to see this or plan on purchasing it on DVD, you should really think about what this movie is standing for.
B00005R2M3|4.0|In the beginning, Laundry Service hit me and it hit me hard. I was blown away by Shakira's amazing ability to melt right into the American pop industry, and was wowed by her unique voice and inspiring lyrics. It even inspired me to buy her sophomore album, &quot;Donde Estan Los Ladrones&quot;. But it was &quot;Donde&quot; that allowed me to see true faults in &quot;Laundry Service&quot;. While &quot;Donde&quot; had beats varying from your run-of-the-mill fun rock (as in &quot;Si Te Vas&quot;) to Arabic dance techno-pop (only in &quot;Ojos Asi&quot;!), &quot;Laundry&quot; fails to vary too much. Although I greatly enjoy songs such as &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot;, &quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot;, &quot;Objection (Tango)&quot;, and &quot;Te Dejo Madrid&quot;, the rest of the songs seem to follow the same formulas as the songs previously stated. &quot;The One&quot;, while beautiful in its own right, tends to lean towards &quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot; territory as Shakira belts out those high notes. And, although the beat of &quot;Eyes Like Yours&quot; stays true to its original rhythms, Gloria Estefan's lyrics do not capture the feeling of &quot;Ojos Asi&quot;'s, and lyrically hits a bullseye with &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot;. &quot;Objection (Tango)&quot; makes good use of the tango rhythms and, aside from &quot;Rules&quot; is the most unique song on the CD. &quot;Ready for the Good Times&quot; dives into the murky depths of disco, and, although its lyrics do not make perfect sense at all times (example: 'my world was full of seven-legged cats') still merits the repeat button sometimes. &quot;Poem to a Horse&quot; has some nice music, but the lyrics are forgettable and in a way slightly annoying if you're not in the mood. &quot;Que Me Quedes Tu&quot; feels to me as an afterthought, something thrown together at the last minute, although its change in beats is somewhat enjoyable. I believe Shakira has definitely made her mark on the US pop industry. Although she has yet to top &quot;Donde&quot; its nice to watch her delve into the mysteries of new genres. I can't wait for her next album--hopefully it'll have a chance against &quot;Donde&quot;.
B00003CXXJ|2.0|But there it is.  I hadn't seen it at the theatres and was looking forward to watching it with my son on DVD.  Imagine my dismay as I kept waiting for the movie to get better and it never did.<br />I didn't think it was funny but then again, I will own up to the fact that I don't find jokes about bodily functions to be funny and haven't since 3rd grade.  I didn't even think it was very original.  <br />IMO, Monsters Inc. did a much better job with the genre and was funnier and much more original.
1573225517|4.0|The catchy title of High Fidelity which plays on both the  musical and relationship use snagged me into reading this book. I can't actually explain why I read the entire book one night without sleeping. It is well written and does have its funny elements. I enjoyed the exploration of the male psyche which is also a rather depressing journey- the main character is your basic non-achieving, just barely surviving,  self-pitying, bitter and whinging bloke. I did care about what happened to him however and  was absorbed in his misery and rather shallow casting about for meaning.   <br />I don't know why I liked it, but I did.  Obviously the majority of readers agree with this but are more capable of expressing why.
B00005RFAI|2.0|This album is a serious let down on what i was expecting. Maybe my expectations were too high but apart from 'get the party started' this material just gives me the impression that Pink is heading for a very expensive rehab clinic very soon. No mention of Robbie Williams here but at least he did it with style. Pink goes from on track to the next with new miseries in each new track. The only praise i would give her is the touching track 'my vietnam' which reflects how her personal war relates to the one her late father fought in. Her first album was a massive hit with me but i think her change from RnB to Pop will only benefit her financial as i will think twice before buying her next material.

6303575617|4.0|With all due respect to Terri's review below, I have a question:  Were we watching the same video?<br />I consider myself to be an intermediate exerciser, having worked out on a regular basis for about 5 years.  I'd been thinking about getting a lower body only tape; I finally chose this because I also have Cory's Get Hard Arms and Shoulders (excellent) and Kardio Kick (a decent kickboxing tape for beginners or a light cardio day for intermediate/advanced exercisers), and I like her style.<br />As others have noted, Cory includes gym machines in this tape, but she concentrates (and is front and center) teaching the home version.  This is NOT a gym only workout (if it were, I wouldn't have hesitated to return it).  Since she does the reps slowly, you can use as heavy weights as you want.  (Beginners may want to learn proper form first before using this tape since she only gives a few form pointers.)  She really works the quadriceps, calves, and hamstrings well, and even throws in some abs work at the end (basic crunches).  Note that you may want to use ankle weights for some of the exercises, and the calf step ups require a step.<br />Another exercise she does is called a Good Morning.  Although I'd heard of it, I'd never done this one before; it works the lower back.  I'd caution anyone who hasn't done this before to do it the first couple of times without weights (Cory pretty much says the same thing).  The first time I did it, I felt a little tug down there, so I immediately got rid of the weights.  Anyone with back problems should probably just skip this exercise.<br />A couple of not so good things:  1. No warm up (she *does* stretch between sets) and 2. She has you putting on and taking off ankle weights instead of doing all the ankle weighted exercises together.  The warm up you can do on your own, so that was no big deal.  As for No. 2, it irritated me at first, but I've since gotten used to it.<br />All in all, a very good tape.  I give it an A-.

B000002I4S|3.0|Coltrane woodsheds for hours a day for weeks to prepare for this album of incredibly complex harmonies - some tunes at super fast tempos - and the great Tommy Flanagan on piano has to practically sight read them right out of the box on the day of the recording and barely manages to keep up. I felt bad for him for years, because he's one of my favorites. (Check him out on Art Pepper's Straight Life for some great soulful and tasteful playing.) Anyway, glad to get this off my chest! Coltrane should have given him more time to prepare for the studio session! Nevertheless, this album is where Coltrane takes the perfection his own playing to an almost impossible standard for anyone else to match. He was driven as a musician, and one can clearly hear the results and sense his excitement about finally being able to play his own music instead having to play Green Dolphin Street for the 1000th time with the Miles Davis Quintet.
B00005NB0H|5.0|I'm no audiophile so take this with a grain of salt,  but I think these discs sound great, especially considering there over 30 years old. I'll keep this short and sweet.  Solid renditions of every song and the My Generation is absolutely phenomenal!!!  It's over 15 minutes long with several teases of other songs and has a killer solo from Pete.  The only downside is the packaging, horrendous.  It doesn't list the songs on the back of the case, you have to open it up and pull out the notes.  Overall, a must have for any Who fans and also a great beginning disc(s) for newbies. Also, great stage banter.  Highly recomended.  2 cents
6305342741|2.0|After watching this one on TV recently I came away thinking I had found the source of George Lucas' inspiration for Star Wars: the stormtroopers, R2D2, and even the theme song of Star Wars appear in this hokey film. I am now astounded to see that it followed Star Wars. Made in 1979? Unbelieveable!  I thought it was dopey but attributed that to its \\"age,\\" but now realize that Disney should never have released this dog.
0425107469|5.0|This is Dean Koontz at his finest. The man is first and foremost a storyteller par excellence, and \\"Watchers\\" reels you in just-like-that---zip!  All of his favorite elements are in play: the hulking government-sponsored lab, the super dog, the pathetic monster, the burnt out protagonist and redemption.  It may be a formula, but then so is the chef's masterpiece.  When it's done right, it's a work of art.  The dialogue is Koontzian stiff (the dog has the best lines), but with such strong characterizations, it is but of small moment.<br />Travis Connell is a man in bleak despair.  He has lost everyone who meant anything to him and is convinced he is a jinx.  With great serendipity he meets an extraordinary golden retriever and one of life's misfits, Nora Devon.  The dog and Travis meet and mutually support one another in a wilderness area where something unknown is threatening them.  They in turn meet the sheltered, totally repressed Nora and save her from a sexual predator who is insinuating himself into her life.  The three are inexorably drawn to one another and each almost miraculously strengthens the others. <br />The story shifts among the trio, a workaholic NSA agent, and a particularly repellent professional hit man with a God complex.  The hit man Vince is wonderfully rendered and, unfortunately for the reader, we understand all too well his skewed logic.  Lemuel Johnson, the NSA agent, has too much personal baggage and sometimes retards the story.  The golden retriever, subsequently named Einstein, is a perfect realization of a dog that has been genetically engineered for high intelligence.  He thinks, he reasons, he communicates (no, he can't talk, thank God!), but he remains very much a dog with all the traits we human dog lovers treasure.  Somehow the author keeps him from ever being cute or a circus wonder; he has dignity and gravitas.<br />This is a great, fast read that will leave you with something to think about and makes the reader face some moralambiguities.  Mr. Koontz flawlessly pushes all our buttons in this, possibly his best, novel.
B000000WA4|5.0|After starting out with Siamese Dream, it was difficult to appreciate how good these CD's are at first I have to admit.  After several listens though, I believe this work strongly stands on it's own as one of the finest albums of the last 10 years.  Are there songs that could have been left off? Yes.  However, the effort as a whole is an impressive artistic achievement.  It's more polished than Gish and SD, yet extremly creative and well-produced.  I enjoyed getting into some of the less well-known tracks such as Galapogos, Muzzle, Pocelina, and Stumbleine as well as the heavy hitters like Jelly, Zero, and Bodies.  <br />The band's excellent combinations of heavy and light in their songs has always reminded me a lot of another favorite band - Jane's Addiction.  This album exemplifies how good of a band this was, and it seems like no matter how much critical acclaim they receive, it's never quite enough.  To me, SD and Mellon Collie will remain two of the best &quot;alternative&quot; albums not only out of the 90's, but that I've ever listened to.
0393317552|4.0|This book is the propagation of what I like to call the granola theory.  Diamond's book reads like a treatise, hand-picking facts to suit his needs, leaping to un-obvious conclusions from the simplest data and ending with grandiose pronouncements.  You won't find any mention of an opposing theory or even a trace of doubt about his own.  I would love if someone would scientifically prove the equality of \\"races\\", but this theory has too many holes in it to be considered a valid analysis.   Despite the poor science, it is still well worth reading if you are interested in pre-history and civilizations never discussed in World History class.

B00003CXTG|1.0|I had to force myself to watch this movie all the way through.  This might be the worst WWII film of all time and I'm including Ronald Regan's \\"Hellcats of the Navy\\" in the mix.  You'd think it would be hard to screw this up, but somehow they managed to do it.  I can't even begin to cover all of the glaring historical inaccuracies of this film.  Most of the historical problems are covered in detail by real history buffs on the web.  Search around on Yahoo and you'll find dozens of sites poking holes all over this movie.  If you think you're seeing the story of Pearl Harbor in this film you are badly and sadly mistaken.  I actually found myself laughing hysterically at some of them - - e.g. American P-40 fighters outmaneuvering Japanese Zeros and beating them in a dead climb - - Ben Affleck, purportedly a fighter jock, getting the nod to fly level bombers off the deck of a carrier for the Doolitle raid - - Ben Affleck joining the Brits and flying a Spitfire in the Battle of Britain a YEAR after it was over.  It was ridiculous from start to finish.  Add to that the fact that Affleck is about as good an actor as a 2x4 piece of pine and you have one crappy movie.  Want to see a pretty decent movie about Pearl Harbor?  Rent or buy Tora Tora Tora - - the graphics are not up to snuff but they're pretty good and they get the history right.  GOD did this movie stink.<br />One redeeming quality . . . this movie at least makes a token effort to tell the story of Dorri Miller (Cuba Gooding Jr.) who manned an AA battery on his own (not his job), shot down at least one Japanese plane and who was the first African American to earn the Navy Cross . . . the Navy's second highest award for valor second only to the Medal of Honor.
0803726570|5.0|What a fun book for Halloween or anytime! <br />The book offers a gentle lesson in cooperation as the animals  work together to rescue their friend. (It's a dirty job, but somebody had to do it--you'll see what I mean when you read the book.)<br />The rhymes work well for reading aloud and the vividly colored illustrations are full of details that little children will want to look at again and again.<br />For the most part the characters are smiling (except, of course, when the dragon tries to eat the witch). Even the youngest child will not feel threatened by either the characters or the plot.<br />I have a feeling this is going to be the featured story at my Halloween story hours this year.
6305807930|5.0|People often criticise this film, complaining about the lack of drama and story. These people do not truly understand what this film is. It isn't the regular teen fodder to give you laughs and cheap thrills. Like Fulci's THE BEYOND, it's an exercise in pure cinema. It's a film about the images, symbols, shifting patterns of light and music. All these elements are placed together to pose certain cryptic riddles that are seemingly never revealed. Interspersed between these enigmas are moments of cinematic lyricism. We are constantly surprised by amazing shapes, colours, patterns of light. Because the enigmas regarding the truth of the legend of the 3 mothers are indecipherable, and because the clues are foregrounded to an extent in the film style, we are constantly forced to try and work things out which cannot be answered. This futility of the film's truth takes us to a meta-cinematic truth. We find out through this why the actual film was made. The reason being that the language of cinema isn't sufficient to spell out truths, it is primal. It is ultimately beyond language, and beyond time and space. Argento's film is oneiric, and is an exercise in poetic sensation. This film evokes feelings in me that are sensational, overwhelming, feelings that cannot be explained. Maybe they mean nothing, or everything. But INFERNO shows that the mechanics of cinema evoke a purer, non-language, profound sensory expression.
B000000OQF|5.0|Art. Pure ... art. This is one of the top tree albums ever. Guns N'Roses debut was the best(and better then), since Van Halen's.<BR>Slash plays like Joe Perry. He dosen't copy Eddie VH's two-hand tap style, like every other 80's guitarist. Axl Rose sounds like an American Ozzy. This band was the best heavy metal group that the 1980's produced. This is on the level of stuff like Led Zeppelin and Aerosmith. The sound is 70's metal. They updated Aerosmith's sound, then made it so much better. If you don't own a copy of this record, your not a rock n' roll fan. Forget about Metallica, Nirvana, and all the other [junk] that became populer later. This is the last great rock band ever.
B000002OVJ|5.0|The Who were undisputedly one of the big three along with the Beatles and the Stones. In fact they had moments when they matched the Beatles for inventive songwriting, having even been their superiors in terms of musicianship, sheer volume of output and ...er...sheer volume (that's Guinness Book of Records, fact fans).  Live at Leeds is already down as one of the definitive live albums of all time. The band is in top form but the songs! The songs are in a league of their own. Which is both good and bad. Good because you and I can enjoy a crisp remastered edition (the sound is crystal clear) and bad because it makes all those Britpop bands of today sound hopelessly inept. Substitute, played here with remarkable tightness, has to be one of the best songs in pop history. Neither Blur nor Pulp nor Oasis nor Dodgy nor Travis have never written anything as good as this or most of the other songs on this record for that matter (sad but true). Happy Jack illustrates Pete Townsend's story-telling geni us, which later found full fruition in rock-opera masterpieces, Tommy and Quadrophenia. Young Man Blues, a cover version of an old blues standard, gives Led Zeppelin a run for their money for sheer electric power. Rock n roll classics Summertime Blues and Shakin' All Over are all fire and sex. And it just gets better. I won't even begin to describe the energy unleashed in My Generation or Magic Bus. It will leave you breathless.<br />With the recent demise of John Entwhistle, this is a perfect opportunity to sit back (if you can) and experience a superb recording of one of the world's greatest bands firing on all six. And then some.
B000002KLG|5.0|I really can't add to what the others have written, except to say that fellow jazz guitarist Lee Ritenour is used extensively on this album. It would be interesting to know why? Was it because GB didn't have the time to do all the guitar parts or did Rit bring something to the table that GB couldn't?<br />No matter, this is a fine pop recording by a legendary jazz guitarist.
B00005IC2H|4.0|Sigur Rós second and most recent effort, Agaetis Byrjun, is that type of album you will only listen and enjoy if you're open minded. Being not acessible and pantomimic for some, for all its drawnings at the cover art, it is recommended for those who wish to listen to something different from the conventional . Similar to The Residents experimental concepts, Sigur Rós leashes with polish lyrics and moody sounds, who turn up to be a great journey to diverse fields, flirting with depression (&quot;Viðar vel tl loftárasa&quot;) or a sense of confusion and beauty (&quot;Svefn-G-Englar&quot;). Standup tracks here includes.. all songs. But its memorable and plausible to say that &quot;Ný Batterí&quot;, which was also released as a single, might be the highlight here, going from a moody and sleepy sound to heavy drums at its closure. <br />Maybe one of 1999's most interesting (and equally unnoticed even in underground scene), Agaetis Byrjun is a good start, as the album's title disserts, to listen and understand Sigur Rós dinamism and eccentricity, and yet a considerable and masterpiece art.
0345413377|4.0|wonderful book but if you asked me that a year ago i'd probably spit on you. The book is really good but that ending...grrrr!!!<BR>really it is a must to read and you'll be lost without it but be prepared for the worst. i wouldn't suggest writting a review right after you read the book because you'll probably juge a little harshly. oh  and by the way THIS IS FICTION!! it'd be a hell of a doosy if it was preching values of the church and no i AM a christion soo there! basicly if you can't axcept a different opionon on religon then go read some prehistoric 18th century  written by a 18th century revrend .... i'm not saying you have to like it just agnolige the fact that the christion religion is only one of several thousand.
B000002JSH|4.0|As a complete hair-metal junkie, I have to say that Bad Company is one of my favorite bands, simply because of two of the songs on this album: &quot;Feel like makin' Love&quot; and &quot;Shooting Star.&quot;  The other songs aren't their best, but the album is fantastic.
B0000025DR|5.0|OK, I'm being picky here, but \\"Fire On High\\" was used on \\"CBS Sports Spectacular\\", not \\"ABC's Wide World Of Sports\\", as mentioned in another review.  Also, someone at CBS must have been an ELO fan, because there was a time in the late 70's when it seemed like ELO was their house band.  It was common to hear snippets of later ELO tunes.  Specifically, I recall hearing \\"Livin' Thing\\" and \\"Mr. Blue Sky\\" on other sports shows.  But, back to \\"Face The Music\\".  This is a great album for any new ELO fan to get introduced to what they are all about.  It pretty much covers everything.  You have your progressive rock with \\"Fire On High\\", pop-rock with \\"Evil Woman\\", soft rock with \\"Strange Magic\\", hard rock with \\"Poker\\", and country rock with \\"Down Home Town\\".  I didn't mention \\"Waterfall\\" or \\"One Summer Dream\\", but that's not to slight those tunes.  Those are some of my favorite ELO songs of all time.
B000069AUI|5.0|If you liked their first album, you'll love this one. Coldplay is recognizable by their first two hits... Yellow, and Trouble. Which had a sound that seemed different from other artists, and much more heartfelt.<br />This new CD embraces Coldplay's unique sound, with more complexity. A Rush Of Blood to the Head is a major step for the group being as they've added more texture: everything is allot deeper than it was. Such as the song Politik; it sounds so strange at first, and dosen't even seem to fit the group. Later as lyrics appear everything comes together in a Floydian way.<br />This CD contains chaos, order, and everything inbetween. The group is more experienced with their music.<br />I recommend this album to anyone who's a fan, and to newcommers who're looking for something different
B00005YXZH|3.0|As a long time Wilco fan I admire Jeff Tweedy's <BR>attempt to grow as an artist. The music is still<BR>better than 95% of the other music coming out right<BR>now. The problem I have with this album is that<BR>its artistic expansion appears to be directed at<BR>everything except the songs themselves. The lyrics<BR>often hint of unusually good poetry in spots but in<BR>most spots are overly repetitious and void of any <BR>underlying toungue in cheek humor that gave a lot<BR>of their ealier music its irony and charm. Jeff has<BR>a great voice but it comes off as emotionless on<BR>this album, as if he were half asleep or reading<BR>names out of the phone book. His monotonous tone(drone)<BR>fails to convey excitement or sadness when it seems<BR>needed. This approach only works well on the opening<BR>track(I am trying to break your heart). The only<BR>other song that stands out is the haunting Jesus, <BR>etc. where The feedback is toned down and the lyics and<BR>vocals take center stage. This song comes to life<BR>in a way the others do not.<BR>  Contrary to the sticker on front of the CD package,<BR>this is not Wilco's finest hour. Being There is <BR>light years ahead of this one musically and <BR>emotionally. Most of the songs on YHF are hardly<BR>distinguishable from one another and the artistic<BR>growth is noticable everywhere except in the songs<BR>themselves. Hopefully next time Wilco will put<BR>forth a little more enthusiasm.
B0000640VO|5.0|I am your typical movie snob; it is the rare modern cinematic feature that provokes me to say that I would ever watch it again, much less to consider to do this.  Amlie is by far and away one of my favorite movies.  Its cinematography is absolutely fantastic, and then the story itself is breathtaking.  Every time I watch this movie, it moves me to tears.  This movie is, without a doubt, a masterpiece.
B000069AUI|4.0|This album is a very obvious evolution in Coldplay's sound, as at times they seem like an altogether new band, covering new ground in an assertively confident manner. Most of the songs here are quite good, with POLITIK and AMSTERDAM being particular standouts; the brutal, passionate title track is a heartstopper.
B00005JKDR|5.0|A wonderful and delightful fun filled adventure.  My kids loved it and so did I.  Highly recommended!
0195117298|4.0|Interesting arguments, centered on a very revolutionary way of looking at space-time.  I think his arguments could have been much more efficiently laid out; it was occasionally frustrating plowing through some of the material.  Writing this book for the layman necessarily requires a good deal of redundancy in order to spiral towards some understanding.  But the ideas are worth the effort. The book would profit immensely from a few side-bars for the more mathematically inclined.<BR>For those who have had some physics:<BR>Barbour argues for a universe which evolves as a path through a configuration space, with an appropriate metric (ie, action) determining which point (ie, which NOW) comes next.  This view has no TIME, pe se.  Time (as we sense it) is merely a record of changes occuring as we move along the path.  These ideas challenge current conceptions, and hold out hope for a much simpler holistic view of the universe.  If you enjoy such topics, you should also check out books by Lee Smolin, Brian Greene, and Eric Chaisson.
0844663662|5.0|This has got to be one of the most original books ever written, and I would highly recommend it to anyone open minded enough to enjoy it.  I don't have to summerize it, as many others have done so, so I'll just skip to what I have to say.  This book is one of the only books I've read that completely lets the reader deside what this book means to him/herself.  There's also plenty of praise out there, so I'll shoot down some of the odvious misconceptions some of these other reviewers have about the book.  This book is not ment to be a character study.  It doesn't try to be, and it shouldn't be judged as one.  The characters are pawns that Mister Vonnegut uses to tell us what we need to hear.  This book is not character based.  It is theme based wholly, and the charcters are not there to give us depth, but to act out what needs to be said by the author.  This book is also not a typical novel, and people can't say they are annoyed about the random order of events, or the lack of a resolution.  This book is made to fit the reader.   I would highly reccomend this book to anyone who  I feel is open-minded and free-spirted enough to experiance something wholely different then any other book ever written
B00005JKNC|1.0|NOTE: are you the type that gets all bent out of shape when you read a review of a movie that you loved that completely slams it? I respectfully advise you to quit reading now.<br />Straight up, I rented this movie to see Bruce Campbell. I was hoping this would be an interesting Frank Darabont movie to see in the theater. Then I was warned away from it by TONS of reviewers and friends I trust. I have a friend who idolizes Campbell and will see any movie he's even rumored to have a cameo in in the theater. My friend REFUSED to see this movie (again, bad word-of-mouth, he had a friend that wouldn't touch it with a thousand foot pole). That's how bad it is.<br />So anyway, I read that the DVD special features had footage of Bruce Campbell left on the cutting room floor, so.... I could have just watched the extra footage, but I figured hey, I don't have much planned till tonight, why not watch the whole movie, even though it's 2 and a half hours long? It was directed by Darabont, wasn't it? It couldn't be that bad! Famous last words.<br />The premise is that Jim Carrey (please, Academy, just mail him some sort of honorary Oscar so he goes back to making silly movies again) plays a screenwriter in the 50's during the time of the Hollywood blacklist. You'll never guess what happens next. He ends up on the blacklist! Couldn't see that coming, huh? All he did was go to a meeting to try to impress a girl in college, but too bad--all in the space of one day, he's not going to get his contract renewed at the studio, his girlfriend dumps him off screen, no-one wants to associate with him, etc. He gets hammered at a bar with a cool name like `The Congo Bonga Room', then drives off a bridge (accidentally), hits his head, and winds up with amnesia. Here's where they lost my suspension of disbelief. He's completely hammered, almost drowns, then is washed downstream where he hits his head very hard on a large rock. OK, so he somehow floated, unconscious, but with his head sticking out of the water for about a mile so he didn't drown? Anyway, he wakes up on Plot Device Beach on the coast, with no ID (it got washed away) and no  memory of his former life, even his name. OK, now right there was when I got a bad feeling reading the plot description, but it gets worse. The townspeople think he's Luke someone-or-other, the son who went off to war and never came back, MIA. I'm not going to go into it more than that, because you've probably already fallen asleep simply from reading my plot description.<br />I knew this movie was long, but I swear to God, I would be POSITIVE they were winding it up, and it was the last dramatic scene/event, then there'd be still more. This is how dumb I am: I kept watching in case BC showed up again, even though I KNEW his part was through. That's like deliberately putting your hand back in hot water after you've just burned it, or something.<br />To give you an idea of my high sappiness tolerance,  I cried my eyes off during most of the Green Mile (which many of my friends thought was to sappy, but I went through about 19 kleenex) and in Shawshank--I still get teary when I watch them. .But this movie got so sugary and cliched and warm and fuzzy that I talked back to the screen. This is an interesting testament to how badly this movie failed: a couple months ago I went to a seminar given by a successful writer who said, quite correctly, that the two easiest ways to make a reader/audience cry are goodbye scenes and reunion scenes. The Majestic was overflowing with goodbye/welcome back scenes, but all they made me do was wince and wonder if there was any way this movie could have worked and been entertaining. Jim Carrey has now proved he's a fine dramatic actor, so ENOUGH. We get the picture, Jim. He's miscast (though Carrey doesn't think so, you can tell by watching him) but his performance just seems like he's trying too hard as a result.<br />It's clear that the moviemakers planned (but failed, thank God) to completely sweep the Academy Awards with this one; a ton of scenes might have well as \\"For Your Oscar (TM) Consideration\\" teletyped along the bottom... but it just didn't work.  The plot line is just something that never should have been greenlighted; it almost seems like a vanity production. Martin Landau, looking worse than he did in Ed Wood as Lugosi (I hope this was intentional) is great , as always; the lead actress was acceptable but forgettable, but it was instead one of the dullest and hardest movies to sit through since...uh....help me out, here....<br />Campbell fans, if you must rent this, rent the DVD. The special features include the entire 5 minute finale of \\"Sand Pirates of the Sahara\\"--which, now that I think of it, seems very out-of-date for the mid fifties, it looks more like a swashbuckling black and white flick of the 40's--a movie that Carrey's character has his first writing credit on. Do NOT sit through the whole movie like dumb me (unless it's just for a moment to see the hilarious poster with him on it). His backstory, which they should have included, was that he plays a over-the-hill matinee idol and corny actor with a serious drinking problem who is hanging onto his career by his fingernails (cough*Errol Flynn*cough) He's looked better, but is hilarious deadpanning lines like \\"You thought wrong!\\"  Diehard Bruce Campbell fans only- rent the movie, watch his part on the special features,saving you the pain I endured of having to sit through the actual movie. Recommended only for hardcore BC fans or people with insomnia or maybe for screenwriters who want to see examples of how NOT to surprise or entertain the audience. Others, RUN!<br />The only positive things I can say about the DVD are that it includes the aforementioned film and also a feature where you can read the history of the Hollywood blacklist, which more people, IMHO, should be educated about. Sorry, Mr. Darabont...there's gotta be another Stephen King-depression era-prison flick you can work on next.ly sweep the Academy Awards with this one; a ton of scenes might have well as \\"For Your Oscar (TM) Consideration\\" teletyped along the bottom... but it just didn't work.

B000067CPX|2.0|This CD makes an excellent frisbee.  I suggest using it exclusively for that purpose.
B000000WCX|3.0|There's nothing really original or inventive about this album and Reeves Gabrels's guitar playing was mixed very loudly, so much so that it nearly drowns out Bowie. It's halfway decent, though and fairly entertaining if you keep an open mind to it. This one is probably best bought used.
B00006AW2G|5.0|Mr Socher, you completely misunderstand the genesis of these remasters. The band was not involved in the process at all, in fact they don't even have any rights to this back catalogue owned by ABKCO (pre-1974 I think). The point of these remasters was to re-issue in one of the highest quality formats currently available (SACD), all of that back catalogue and make available to everyone variations in the various albums as they were released in the USA and the UK and to do it in the format as released (mono or stereo) and not try to create multi-channel mixes.    Erik Espe: SACD is not about depriving anyone of their \\"rights\\" to rip music, it is about better quality audio reproduction. In fact not many companies are releasing so-called \\"hybrid\\" SACDs (ie those with SACD and red book CD layers). Sony themselves who touted this as a benefit of the SACD format when it was first announced have not issued a single hybrid disc. The issue of CD playback is hit and miss. Some CD players and CD-ROM drives can read the CD layers on the Stones discs, others cannot. I have been able to rip the CD tracks from all the new remasters and encode them to MP3 for my iPod. So please, no conspiracy theories here -- SACD is not an anti-ripping conspiracy.
B00005JL3A|4.0|Oh-KAY!  Resident Evil got a little more hardcore and bleak than I was prepared for, but that's a good thing.  I was expecting a mediocre, derivative action movie where I'd be able to predict every single shock and plot twist, with maybe a few cool money shots or zombie gore thrown in that made it worth a rental (I'm a sucker for zombies).  If you'd told me before I saw it that I'd be giving it 4 stars afterwards, I probably would have laughed. I ain't laughing now.<br />I can't compare the game to the movie that well, since I've only played the game once or twice in the arcade and didn't last very long before I got eaten. (Check the trivia section on the IMDB if you want more info on that, though beware of many spoilers) I don't know if the game has any more of a backstory than the DVD box did: a virus is accidentally unleashed at an underground biological research facility that turns all the employees, lab animals, and experiments into flesh-eating undead. A rescue team discovers too late they are stuck in there with them; they have 3 hours to get out without getting eaten or, worse, infected  before the `Red Queen' master computer permanently shuts down all the exits.<br />On the negative side, it was a little longer than an action movie needs to be-- 10 minutes could have been trimmed, I caught myself wanting to hit forward and skip scenes in the first half hour of people wandering warily around deserted areas. I've never wanted to do that with a Romero movie. It does take a little too long to get going, but when the action kicks in, trust me, it doesn't let up, to the point where I felt kind of battered after the movie-- really unrelenting. I couldn't stand the industrial/techno soundtrack, but then I don't usually listen to bands with song titles like `Fistf*ck\\" and \\"My Plague (New Abuse Mix)\\". I guess it was appropriate for the movie;  I didn't exactly expect, say, Oingo Boingo (though that would have been kind of cool, now that I think of it) but it was grating after a while. Several shots were extremely derivative of Romero, but since I haven't watched the featurettes or commentaries, I'm not sure if the filmmakers intended them as a tribute/in-joke (like the newspaper headline blowing around a deserted street proclaiming THE DEAD WALK!  which, as far as I'm concerned, should earn a movie 3 stars right there) or just ripped them off with the plan to say they were `inspired by' the other movie if anyone pointed out the similarities.<br />The end seemed to be setting up for a sequel (according to the IMDB, one is planned but not even in pre-production), though at least not in an extremely cliched way, and it mainly irritated me because it was a cliffhanger. There's also several CGI shots where the monster looks about as realistic as the one in the actual game; I did not for a moment forget I was watching CGI, and it was VERY easy to tell where the animatronics ended and the CGI began. Oh, and terrible tagline, at least on the poster art (\\"Survive the horror\\"?  C'mon, marketing team, you can try a little harder).<br />OK, enough of what didn't work. On the plus side, Milla Jovovich has proven herself to be one of the few genuinely talented model-turned-actresses, and gives a great performance. I was kind of disappointed in Michelle Rodriguez's acting, mainly because she was so good in Girlfight, but she was acceptable and at least can really look like a badass. There's quite a few fun--and sick--shots. There were plot twists that I actually didn't see coming--sorry to say, I could see most of the jumps walking up 5th Avenue-- and the plot was a lot more brutal and downbeat than I expected (for a movie based on a video game, and for a modern zombie movie, anyway)--good for them. They did definitely outright steal some ideas from Dawn of the Dead (and, as everybody has already probably pointed out, Cube) but at least had some originality by putting a slightly new twist on them. There was a much higher body count than I thought (not counting all the zombie employees, of course, I mean among the heroes), most of which was pretty b-llsy. Characters did not die in the order I expected them to. Things got pretty cold-blooded (so to speak).<br />I'd recommend it for a rental, if you want a mindless, scary action movie with some real suspense. Big fans of the game, it's probably a good investment to purchase (though I'm sure everyone that was going to buy it did so a long time ago) . You could do a lot worse (like rent the director's Mortal Kombat, for instance) Bonus/deleted/alternate scenes, and easter eggs (yes, you can stop hunting for them now), are conspicuously absent on the DVD, which leads me to believe the talk about releasing a 2 disc set a few months down the line of an `unrated director's cut'.  I'll rent that to see that extra gore (hey, I ain't above that, and I'll gladly admit to it), and I wouldn't mind seeing the flick again, either.<br />Not bad at all for a mainstream studio movie based on a game.hought (not counting all the zombie employees, of course, I mean among the heroes), most of which was pretty b-llsy.

B000003NA3|5.0|Look, I admit it.  I am NOT a huge fan of Coltrane, but that isn't important when it comes to this set of disks.  It is a great document of Coltrane's work and his artistry.  I bought this set because he is a significant artist and pre-eminent in a genre he helped define.<br />The disks contain several different versions of INDIA and they should each be listened to carefully.  They are a wonderful means by which to become familiar with Coltrane's style and musical sensibilities (and the other musicians with which he was collaborating in creating these jazz treasures).<br />If you are a Coltrane fan you will love these disks.  If you love jazz and aren't so sure about Coltrane, these disks are still very important and will help you make up your mind.<br />If you aren't a fan of jazz or Coltrane but still have an open mind about artistry and style then these disks could still offer you some benefits of suprise and challange your current opinions and tastes.  Listen to the three different versions of India included here to get some idea of what improvisation meant to Coltrane.
0316666343|5.0|This book envokes many different emotions that a person who has never lost someone, my have never felt before. I cried, laughted and was outraged from one page to another. The story is one of a typical family that goes through the loss of a daughter and sister. <br />The book reads quite quickly and the storytelling makes you wonder if Alice Sebold is sitting next to you telling you this amazing tale. Instead of have a reader and author relationship, it seemed more like old friends. The character of Susie was well crafted and I found myself drawn to the book to find out, not what was going to happen next, but how this family was going to make it through the day.<br />I recommend this book highly. I will be waiting patiently for Alice Sebold to write another book. This book was one of the best I've read.
0375507507|5.0|I loved this book.  Alexandra Fuller's writing style is refreshing and unique.  Her vivid and sometimes horrifying experiences were totally engrossing.  It has been several years since I have become so absorbed in a book that I was bereft when it ended and desperate to find another book to fill the void.  I even immediately reread sections rather than let it go.  The racism of her parents is not disguised nor apologized for.  It is stated as a matter of history, and despite my shock at their attitudes, I appreciated the honesty with which it was recounted.  When Alexandra swore never to leave Africa after nearly dying from drinking tea water tainted with Hippo dung, I was incredulous that anyone could wish to live in such harsh conditions.  I'm sure it would be fascinating to hear her sister's side of the story, since Alexandra paints their relationship as cruely one-sided.<br />Believe every good review about this book and treat yourself to a wonderful experience by reading it today.
B000002UAX|4.0|Beatles producer George martin once said that the &quot;White Album&quot;, would've been a better album if it had maybe 6 or 7 great songs on it like &quot;Revolver&quot;. I couldn't agree more and songs such as &quot;Revolution 9&quot; and Rocky Raccoon should never have been included on the album in the 1st place. The album should've had a bluesy-rock feel to it and should have omitted acoustic and love songs. Don't get me wrong I love this album but it was convoluted and not consistent as &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; or &quot;Revolver&quot;. Here is my pick for the songs that should've been on the &quot;White album&quot;. First, start off with &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, just to blow everyone away and show the direction in which they were going. Next include the single &quot;Revolution&quot; on the album and makee it next. Next &quot;While my guitar gently weeps&quot; followed by &quot;Back in the USSR, &quot;Dear Prudence&quot;, &quot;Savoy Truffle&quot; and finally &quot;I'm so tired&quot;. I feel this would have been a much a better album this way, making it sound like the Beatles rather that 4 solo artists, which is how the &quot;White Album&quot; does sound
0140177396|5.0|This book was one that i wish i would of read when i was suppose to in 9th grade. It was once we reached the middle of the book i realized how good it was. I am one of those students who hate reading those long novels about nothing important. Even though my teacher said it was one of the shortest novels we would ever read! After only reading the middle to the end. I just had to check this book out for myself! Once you begin this book, you may think it starts off boring..but keep going becuase youll never want to put it down. It teackes you about loyalty and friendship in real life situations. This is a book i would read over and over again!.Try this book out..you'll really like it!
0345350499|5.0|I was engrossed with this book but I noticed an underlying thread to it that disturbed me. This book is supposed to be the Arthurian legend written in the women's point of view. Despite the message that religious bias is not good, the hidden message is that the men in this book seemed to be far better at judging reality than the women. The women in this book manipulate and contrive in sometimes nasty and petty ways to try to keep the \\"old Goddess religion\\" as the main religion. They refuse to see that the tide is turning and that changes have come to their land. The men characters are more realistic and practical. Marion Zimmer Bradley wrote the men as being more astute about how their world was changing and how to adapt to those changes.     In this way, I have to say this book is not feminist at all. The women seem all too petty, too willing to resort to squabbling over the men and very unwilling to be practical about the changes they are experiencing. I would guess that MZB had a subconscious dislike of women because of how childish and foolish she portrays them.     If this is truly how women really think, is it any wonder we have been maligned by men for centuries? This book has some beautiful parts, but the underlying threads of stupid unaware women, who are totally engrossed in their mean fights over the men in the story, made it unpalatable at times.     Alas, Mists is a book about a LEGEND.  Legends are NOT truth, they are stories about things that may have a small grain of truth in them, but that get embellished many times over the centuries. That means Mallory, Monmouth, Stewart, Bede, Eschenbach, all wrote STORIES, not truths. There is no primary source for the Arthurian legends, the closest we have was written in the 9th (or 11th century,) 400 (or 600) years later, by a monk named Nennius.  Even his works are not considered proof because they are not primary sources.     Mists Of Avalon is  only one more in a long line of Arthurian Myth/Cycle/Legend books with the new twist of telling the story from both the women's and some Pagans' points of view.      I couldn't put it down, and it did make me want to do research into the NeoPagan religions.  Not recommended for younger kids, there's some violence, rape, graphic sexual scenes, and some parts can seem anti-religious. Enthralling read, but keep in mind, it isn't real, there are no records of how Pagans really acted back then and the hidden messages about stupid women are in there.
B000002MUN|5.0|One of the best American rock and roll bands ever, (I have no problem saying that) and 20 years after they first formed, the boys from Gainesville made their best album.<br />Tastefully done and filled with gems, this album is a no brainer to go out and buy.<br />It is hands down one of the best album's of the decade and a top 5'er of 1994 along with the Black Crowes' &quot;Amorica&quot; and Pearl Jam's &quot;Vitalogy&quot;.<br />Enjoy it.

6301773551|5.0|These days, movies about other planets, other people and interplanetary gizmos are crowding the movie scene as kids in a candy store offering free candies. But who started it all?<br />Star Wars is a modern classic. Perhaps the greatest of the movies on extraterrestrial action, the movie created a set of stars whom we find difficult to forget.<br />The most wonderful thing about the movie is that it is hardly boring, and a thoroughly well-crafted spectacle. Also it is not all about 'I kill you, you kill him' kind of crazy action flick. For an action movie, the amount of violence is surprisingly less.<br />Of all the characters in this movie, I must say I loved Obi-Wan Kenobi, played to perfection by the late Sir Alec Guinness.<br />A great movie.

B00006CXSS|5.0|This series was such an eye opener to me as to what war is really about.  Now I understand a little better why my grandpa doesn't talk about serving in WWII.  Watching this, and thinking about the men and women who are serving our country right now, made it all seem even more real to me.  I think I shed a tear or two (or more), every episode.  Thanks HBO, I will always be grateful for what I learned and felt while watching Band of Brothers.
6302969352|5.0|Few will contest the fact that Akiro Kurosawa is among the greatest moviemakers of all time. 'The Seven Samurai' or 'Shichinin no samurai' is his magnum opus.<br />The movie is regarded by many as the first of the modern action movies, but the movie stands out because of the brilliant camera work. Sometimes I tend to think that the technical value of this movie surpasses some of the modern techno movies.<br />Kurosawa weaves a brilliant tale of valor and action in a subtle yet cutting way.
B00004XMTC|2.0|This is definitly the worst in the entire Bond series. This is only a remake of Thunderball and they did a [bad] job of it. It didn't even have that circle at the very beginning when 007 turns around and shoots and then blood comes down (you have to know what I mean if you've seen another 007 flick other than this one). Plus they didn't have a scene before the theme song. Thunderball is much better. The acting I suppose is OK, and some of the action was enjoyable.  Those are the only reasons I gave it an extra star. But this doesen't even belong in the 007 series. Don't buy this. Buy Octopussy (realeased the same year, 1983) instead.
6303168507|5.0|Schindler's List is a very disturbing masterpiece. One can easily describe it as the greatest of the Holocaust movies.<br />Steven Spielberg's wonderful direction coupled with sterling performances from Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Raplh Fiennes leaves an indelible mark on the viewer.<br />Oskar Schindler (Neeson) is an affluent German, who enjoys all the luxuries of life. But when he sees that a great war looms, he knows he can make big business out of it. He meets a Jew (Kingsley) and makes a deal with him... that he'll employ Jews in a variety of jobs. Out of nowhere the list grows to 4 figures, and Schindler knows that he has much to fight for.<br />Despite the melodrama, the movie should be rated as one of the top 10 movies of all time. A feather in Spielberg's cap, it won him the Best Director Oscar.
B000068QVN|5.0|The year was 1971. Grand Funk was on a tour of the US, and at the time, they were the biggest draw in rock. Bigger than Black Sabbath, bigger than Led Zeppelin. The band sold out New York's Shea Stadium in less time than The Beatles. Thousands of fans witnessed the sheer power of the band as they performed classic tracks like \\"Inside Looking Out,\\" Paranoid,\\" and \\"I'm Your Captain.\\" The tour also saw the debut of a song that go would down in the annals of the GFR repertoire as one of their best--\\"Footstompin' Music.\\" <br />The new CD is a chronicle of the tour, culled from a combination of four shows, including four tracks from the infamous Shea Stadium gig. Sound quality is far from perfect (which is probably why this material wasn't released in the first place), but the performances are outstanding. With Mark Farner on vocals, guitar &amp; keyboards; Don Brewer on vocals &amp; drums, and Mel Schacher laying down the killer basslines, this was truly a band to be reckoned with. <br />Live - The 1971 Tour includes all of the songs featured on the group's spring and summer tour, with the exception of \\"Mark Says Alright,\\" which will be appearing as a bonus track on one of the upcoming reissues (Capitol plans to reissue the entire back catalog). If you're a Grand Funk fan, this is a required addition to your collection.
6302799066|5.0|I never knew that Stanley Kubrick had ever made a comedy movie. So when someone recommended Dr. Strangelove, I knew I had to see it.<br />One of the greatest comedy movies ever, this film was trendsetter in many ways. Peter Sellers' acting was just out-of-the-world.<br />Watch this movie and you'll end up laughing your wits out.
0316666343|5.0|I first came across this book here in my recommendations list. I was fortunate enough to have a friend who was willing to lend it to me.<BR>I began reading during my lunch period and couldn't stop. Susie Salmon's story grabbed me and carried me along for a ride like no other. The victim of a sadistic serial killer, Susie tells us her story from heaven. We see her family try and cope with the loss. All you want to do when you read it is to reach out and help them, tell them that she's okay. For me, that was part of the appeal. The reader was in Susie's place. <BR>On the whole I felt it was a story of hope and triumph. Of course they had trials along the way, but in the end they came out okay. The final scene of her killer is a great emotional payoff. <BR>I highly recommend this book if you enjoy crime stories. I don't recommend this book for parents of young girls. Certain parts may make them angry. I know my mother didn't want to read it because of that.<BR>Give it a try and maybe you'll enjoy it as much as I did.
B00003CXZ3|5.0|The first time I saw this movie I sort of kicked myself on choosing to watch it - I just couldn't understand one single piece of it. You could try to convince yourself about a particular scene, but the next scence challenges you because the movie is presented in a way that you will understand the entire stuff if you watch it from back to front.<br />Welcome to Memento - a different kind of a thriller. A modern epic by Chris Nolan, that you will never understand if you are watching it for the first time. This is because the scenes are in the reverse order. You'll find two people speaking in a scene as if they were absolute strangers, and in the next scene you'll find that they have known each other before, because a flashback gives you more information about their previous meeting.<br />This movie is a thriller, and more than the plot, I loved the way it was presented. A true directorial masterpiece.
B00004YA66|5.0|I haven't ever liked a movie enough before to actually write a review, which in and of itself should tell you that this movie must be pretty good. I was a bit skeptical when I first rented the movie, because I had seen the commercials for it when it was in theaters, and they made it look really awful. However, I was pleasantly surprised. I suggest you buy Frequency, or at least rent it. Most movies really aren't worth the money they cost to purchase; this one is.
B00000K0DK|5.0|Citizen Kane is a beautifully crafted series of flashbacks and remembrances. It is a wonderfully engaging story of a dynamic man in a dynamic world. It is a remarkable statement for the wide range of time periods that it covers. It is a deceptively simple story centering on perhaps the most meaningful word in all of moviedom.<br />Behind all that, Citizen Kane is the American cinema. There is not a major director today who has not been influenced by the genius Orson Welles put forth in his debut masterpiece. The film centers around a group of reporters investigating the origin of the dying newspaper tycoon (loosely based on William Randolph Hearst), Charles Foster Kane's last word: Rosebud.<br />The movie begins with an unforgettable newsreel montage summarizing the man's life. From there on, the viewer is thrown into a gloriously chaotic world of flashbacks upon flashbacks, in which the viewer slowly learns just about everything about Charles Foster Kane's enthralling life. From his trying childhood to his rise to power to the pinnacle of his success to his marital difficulties to his fall from grace, the story of Charles Foster Kane is presented for the viewer in a way that few other movies can offer: magically.<br />Citizen Kane, arguably, is THE triumph of the American cinema, and one of the greatest films every created. To many, iy is THE greatest. To me, it stands next only to THE GODFATHER.
B000001FA4|5.0|When U2 released The Unforgettable Fire in 1984, they were instantly propelled to being one of my very favorite bands. I was familiar with U2's prior work and owned copies of War and October, but it was this album that truly ignited my passion for U2. I was only 14 years old at the time, and The Unforgettable Fire moved me in ways I had rarely experienced through music before. <br />I loved The Unforgettable Fire so much that I persuaded my parents to allow me to see U2 in concert during the 1985 tour promoting the album. It was the first rock and roll concert I ever attended, and there I experienced the magic of an immensely talented band playing their music before an adoring sell-out crowd in a large arena. I remember the concert well; it will remain forever engrained in my memory. <br />Although this album is not recognized by critics as U2's best, for me personally, it is the album that crowned this band with greatness. Bono, The Edge, Adam, and Larry went up on poster display in my bedroom. I listened to The Unforgettable Fire over and over and over again. I simply could not get enough of this album. The poetic, meaningful lyrics, the variable musical ambiance, and the intricacies of sound all contributed to my teenage fixation on this album.<br />Eighteen years later, The Unforgettable Fire still occupies a spot in my CD collection. I continue to cherish the album. It represents many aspects of my youth, but it's also magnificent music. Some of U2's very best work is found here. From the opening march, \\"A Sort of Homecoming\\", through the closing anthem, a powerful tribute to the late Martin Luther King Jr., the music on this album resonates closely with me. The band's first major hit single, \\"Pride (In the Name of Love)\\" is found here, as is the subtle, impeccably crafted \\"Bad\\", and the energetically charged \\"Wire\\". Amid all these wonderful tunes, the title track is the epicenter of this album: \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" is a poetic, imaginative, beautifully layered song that serves as a wellspring of musical enjoyment. Rarely can I listen to that song only once; after hearing it, I simply have to play it again. It's that good.<br />For me, The Unforgettable Fire is an unforgettable album. In fact, for reasons described above, U2's 1984 release could arguably rank #1 on my list of all-time favorite albums.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|~Set in San Diego in the early 1970s, Almost Famous subtly introduces the element of rock'n'roll music as a venue for freedom. Finding moral support in the lyrics of Simon & Garfunkel, 18-year-old Anita (Zooey Deschanel) rebels against her conservative mother Elaine (Frances McDormand). Deciding to leave home, she urges her younger brother William to let himself be influenced by the music of the era. Over the years, William (Patrick Fugit) develops an interest and befriends legendary music critic~~ Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman: Flawless, Magnolia, The Talented Mr. Ripley), who asks him to cover a Black Sabbath concert for \\"Creem\\" magazine. His article earns the mature-sounding 15-year-old an assignment from Rolling Stone magazine to join the more accessible \\"Stillwater\\" band and interview lead guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) and lead singer Jeff Bebe (Jason Lee) during their \\"Almost Famous\\" concert tour. Postponing his obligations at school and at home,~~ William develops emotional ties with the band and with the coquettish groupie Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), and discovers the contradictions of being a subjective journalist.<br />Almost Famous constructs its plot with effective time constraints which create suspense and establish the film's sense of humor. This is explored within the arena of William's responsibilities toward his editor (who thinks the writer he has hired over the phone is much older) and his mother (who wishes her boy is mature~~ enough to resist peer pressure and drugs, but young enough to obey her). Both the editor and the mother, who require that William constantly check back with them and who impose deadlines (to submit the article outline or to return home), communicate with the protagonist via the phone throughout most of the film. Still, rather than interrupt the boy's tour/trip with the band, the editor/mother interludes emphasize the main character's inability to escape from duty. The comedy rises from~~ William's efforts to be seen as a free adult --a status the band members claim to have reached-- while he struggles with his evident inexperience. Never quite reaching a dramatic point, Almost Famous maintains a comfortable level of seriousness as it explores the main character's doubts and decisions in relation to his role as \\"The Enemy\\", or the critic who \\"writes what he sees.\\" Not letting his perceptions be influenced by the illusion of friendship, nor letting them deny the validity~~ of his subjective reality, the protagonist finds freedom in those attempts that \\"almost\\" fail or \\"almost succeed\\". In this sense, Almost Famous finds a temperate --almost happy-- middle ground in its treatment of such commonly temperamental issues as sex, drugs and rock'n'roll.<br />Special Edition DVD Release: December 4th, 2001 (as Almost Famous: Untitled) Cameron Crowe spoke at length with The Hollywood Reporter about it: \\"The DVD version is a whole cut of the movie, a different,~~ fatter cut. It's about two hours and 45 minutes, something like that, and it has the full Stillwater [...] concert stuff. It has Frances McDormand's character, Elaine, listening to [Led Zeppelin's] \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" in its entirety, and you at home have to put on \\"Stairway to Heaven.\\" The DVD version of that scene will just have the longer version, because Led Zeppelin will never sell the rights to \\"Stairway to Heaven,\\" you at home get to supply it from your own music~~ collection.\\"<br />Also there are 2 hidden extra scenes where Kate Hudson and Patrick are doing the bus scene over and over again.

0316666343|3.0|I'd have to lump this book with those that ARE page-turners, but that you'd be hesitant to recommend to a friend.  The concept is creative and there are a few wonderful insights, but in the end the book suffers from characters that become less interesting and believable as the book goes on (please point me to a bunch of real-life adolescents that are as mature, confident and empathetic as this bunch) and an ending that didn't come quickly enough.  I started to dread the passages that dealt with Susie's heaven, because the way it was presented just didn't hold together for me.  It wasn't the absence of a God or singing angels, but the fact that it seemed so banal (Susie always hated the house she grew up in so in heaven she's gets a townhouse with a gazebo!).  The one thing I did appreciate in this book (and that I wished it had focused more clearly on) was the depiction of how individually people deal with the loss of a loved one.
0385335482|5.0|This book is surprisingly sharp for a novel with &quot;Shopaholic&quot; in the title.  It's fluffy brit-chick lit that won't insult your intelligence.  Unlike others of its genre, Shopaholic's not so plot-driven that you have to plow through to the end to feel satisfied.  Each of Becky's escapades is an episode to savor.
0446608955|3.0|Having read Message In a Bottle, The Notebook, and A Bend In The Road, I can honestly say this was my least favorite.  I was caught up in the story and I couldn't stop reading until I was near the end of the book.  I could feel the emotions of the characters and I responded to their achievements and to their tribulations with my own feelings.  It was an excellent story until the end.  To put it bluntly, I thought the ending was &quot;hokey.&quot;  It was anticlimatic.  Still, it is entertaining and worth a quick read.

Just look at the song titles: &quot;Love Don't Cost a Thing&quot; (a truer statement than the Beatles' &quot;All You Need is Love&quot;) (even sadder considering her own love stories). &quot;I'm Real,&quot; expressing her doubts about her manufactured Hollywood image. &quot;Play,&quot; in which she delves into the pain cause by her work pace, the work which perhaps has destroyed both her marriages--she wants to play. &quot;Ain't It Funny,&quot; a self-deprecating plea for understanding. &quot;Come Over,&quot; showing her need for close personal contact. &quot;We Gotta Talk,&quot; in which she expresses her need for real communication and a meeting of the minds. &quot;That's Not Me,&quot; another lament of her manufactured image. &quot;Dance With Me,&quot; in which she acknowledges that despite her heightened intellect she also needs a physical connection just like the unwashed masses. &quot;Secretly,&quot; a deeply confessional song about the inner J. Lo. &quot;I'm Gonna Be Alright,&quot; a statement of her courage and conviction and self-belief! I have never heard an artist expose so much of her true self on one album! Wow!
B00004TDTO|5.0|\\"Jaws\\" is one of the best 70's movies ever made! The film deals with the police chief (Roy Scheider), an oceanographer (Richard Dreyfuss), and a fisherman (Robert Shaw) who were riding on the boat to find, hunt down, and kill the giant shark that was killing people who were swimming at the beach in Amity Island. The 25th Anniversary Collector's Edition DVD is great! The picture and sound quality are outstanding. The extras are wonderful including the \\"Making Of Jaws\\", the deleted scenes, and the outtakes. If you haven't seen \\"Jaws\\", what's wrong with you? See it right away! It's excellent!

0316666343|4.0|On August 14, 2002, I attended an Alice Sebold reading. As an ex-journalist, I'm a cynic. Until that day, I had only read about five novels since 1978. Most fiction involves less research and \\"rules\\" than non-fiction.<br /><br />Yet Sebold spent five years writing \\"The Lovely Bones.\\"  She didn't intend it to be a Great American Novel (awful clich&eacute;), a handbook about managing grief.  Then astoundingly, it sold more than one million copies in less than two months. Why?<br /><br />On May 8, 1981, Alice Sebold was raped, an incident that nearly destroyed her. She wrote an explicit, shocking and almost neglected book in 1999 called \\"Lucky.\\" It was this knowledge, as a non-fiction reader, and not hype or current events, that drew me to \\"The Lovely Bones.\\" You may not have to know this about Sebold. But if you do, what she writes in \\"The Lovely Bones\\" assumes credibility, even if you're shaking your head in bewilderment, having trouble believing what's in it.<br /><br />\\"Hype\\" is a fashionably pessimistic word being used with excess to leverage what in my view are elitist comments against this book. \\"Hype\\" is a product of marketing with little relevance to quality. I agree with whomever said the following: People who give into \\"hype\\" expecting a seismic shift in their lives before turning to \\"page one,\\" are doomed to disappointment. Hype doesn't give a book \\"legs.\\" Word-of-mouth does.<br /><br />Narrating from the dead, as Susie Salmon does in \\"The Lovely Bones,\\" isn't new. In the shorthand of cinema, you can quickly point to \\"Sunset Boulevard (1950) and \\"American Beauty (1999).\\" She may seem wiser beyond her \\"years,\\" but it isn't critical to separate adolescent vs. adult narration. \\"Real time\\" exists for the living. Susie's dead.<br /><br />In \\"The Lovely Bones,\\" the only thing that matters is what remains in memory. We question what we can't see, yet invisible things like oxygen, love, hate, lust, sorrow and hope are undeniable. After people die, we hear their voices, we remember their touch and the way they look. They're in the next room, watching TV, reading, whatever. Sebold captures our obsession, our \\"presence of mind\\" about the dead. This obviously resonates with people, many without the time to read 10 books per year. To denigrate fans of this book smacks of unnecessary snobbery that promotes literary \\"class distinctions.\\" Conversely, sophisticated readers raise valid criticisms that wouldn't be as intense if they read the \\"NC-17\\" horrors of \\"Lucky.\\"<br /><br />Sebold creates an atmosphere absent of shrillness or clinically described violence. A \\"quick read\\" is not synonymous with shallowness. Expressing the intangible with sentences 10-25 words in length is near impossible. But Sebold's ability to impart abstract thoughts into simple sentences can't be dismissed. This is not a murder mystery. If it was, it'd be ordinary. This is an admittedly broad-brush story about family connections that pushes the thriller into the back seat. Splitting hairs about the plausibility of character motivations misses the big picture of \\"The Lovely Bones.\\" It's not literature aspiring for greatness, filled with big words, tortuous sentences and the type of false profundities that wins awards. It's a book that achieves something greater for most writers -- a chance to weave a collection of universal themes -- through an accessible narrative that sophisticated readers as well as the greater body of people who have zero desire to read can appreciate.<br /><br />Perhaps this is why disappointed readers keep using words like \\"overrated\\" or phrases like, \\"doesn't live up to the hype.\\" They're comfortable with authors requiring more words leading toward a revelation that feels closer to irony and \\"truth\\" than uplift. Hence what's \\"familiar\\" seems trite.<br /><br />But Sebold isn't trite. We demand logical human behavior, but there's a randomness about everything that lies ahead. Wry observations bring the ordinary to the surface without, in most cases, pretentiousness. Accusations of peddling cheap sentiment ring false because she draws upon her past to conjure up spare, abstract subtext and expressions to carry her tale. She succeeds using observational symbolism without wielding a preachy sledgehammer. Looking for religious dogma in heaven? Forget it. To Susie, \\"heaven\\" is just a shorthand for where she \\"is.\\" It could be anything.<br /><br />Sebold's idea is that the dead do more than just \\"think.\\" There are reasons why they suddenly seem near, then disappear. She told ABC News that she doesn't think too much about heaven. But she obviously thinks a lot about the dead, especially victims of violence. Some complain her characters are \\"caricatures.\\" Composites of traits we've seen in friends and ourselves makes a concept less believable? Susie's \\"voice,\\" regardless of age, represents her view, however subjectively precocious, illogical or formulaic. Only one chapter goes off the tracks, proffering a scene that comes too close to \\"Ghost.\\"<br /><br />Is this a book for the ages? Maybe not. But I'm disturbed that a \\"commercial\\" success, even unexpected (as some forget this was), can be disproportionately punished with contempt in forums, unworthy of being labeled a \\"literary success.\\" If the masses like it, hype is responsible and it must be suspect, despite glowing reviews from respected critics, many with advanced degrees in English and comparative literature.<br /><br />For me, a non-fiction reader, the restrained poignancy of Sebold's \\"The Lovely Bones\\" is a surprise in the aftermath of her uncensored and harrowing memoir, \\"Lucky.\\" In the hands of any writer bereft of real-life misfortune, concepts about death in a fictional tale, wouldn't have worked. It's impossible for me to ignore the author's history, despite her repeated statements that a huge gulf exists between \\"Lucky\\" and \\"The Lovely Bones.\\"<br /><br />Yet the success of \\"The Lovely Bones\\" proves it doesn't matter. Thirty years from now, people will still be talking about it. I'm convinced no matter how hard Sebold tries -- the legacy created by her non-fiction \\"Lucky\\" and her fictional \\"The Lovely Bones\\" -- will remain preserved AND inextricably linked.

B00000J2PH|5.0|The track listing for Carole King's &quot;Tapestry&quot; almost makes it look like a Greatest Hits package.  A collection of songs that includes singer-songwriter staples &quot;I Feel the Earth Move,&quot; &quot;It's Too Late,&quot; &quot;You've Got a Friend,&quot; and &quot;(You Make Me Feel) Like a Natural Woman&quot; would be a nice career for many artists.  King accomplished them all on one album, selling 11 million copies and winning 4 Grammy awards in the process.  Like Fleetwood Mac's similar sounding massive hit &quot;Rumours,&quot; every song on &quot;Tapestry&quot; is instantly familiar to the ears.<br />King assembled a group of musicians including James Taylor and many of the top luminaries of the early 1970's West coast studio scene to back her up.  The result is professional and polished with the trademark laid back feel from that period.  The current CD edition that is now available augments the original recording by adding two bonus tracks (one a live version of &quot;Sweetwater Jack&quot;) and recently penned liner notes from Taylor.<br />Overall, a stunning success that marked the high point of this remarkable singer-songwriter's career.
B000002572|5.0|What can we really say about BOSTON (1976) that has not already been said before--That it's a great rock 'n' roll album; in fact, one of the greatest of all time? That it transformed the music forever by totally revolutionizing electric guitar technology? That both sides of the vinyl version ARE 'perfect album sides'? That it sounds even greater on CD? That it all sounds even more incredible on the 24k Gold Remastered Edition? That, at 15 million units sold & counting, it is still the biggest-selling debut rock release of all time? That Boston, as a band, could never live up to it afterwards, despite some quality recordings over the years? It is all this, and much, much more. :)<br />Boston the band, and BOSTON the album, was Tom Scholz's brainchild. The story is all told in the CD liner notes (just as it was on the vinyl album backcover), so there's nothing more to add to this, except that his real genius was forming his hard rock/heavy metal band with such talented members: Lead singer Brad Delp, whose six-octave vocal range has rarely been matched since, even by himself and fellow lead & rhythm guitarist Barry Goudreau, whose style worked so well in tandem with Scholz. Also, bassist Fran Sheehan (any relation to Billy Sheehan of Talas & Mr. Big?) and drummer Sib Hashian provided one tight rhythm section.  This band was never better than on this one, glorious album.<br />Yes, I'm still kind of sick of \\"More Than A Feeling\\" which was a great tune that became way overplayed in the years that followed--but there's no denying that it is still a great song. \\"Peace Of Mind\\" is also such a 1976 classic, but it is the album's centerpiece, \\"Foreplay/Long Time\\" that remains the single most compelling track on the entire album.  From the heavy bassed-up 'Foreplay' intro to the smooth, high-pitched Brad Delp vocals that follow (not to mention the incredible Scholz/Goudreau guitar solos), this song still gets my blood pumping and is still one of my 100 favorites of all time.Rock & Roll Band still rocks, while very nicely summarizing Bostons rise to stardom.  Smokin does just that; one of the greatest driving songs of all time, it features the most killer opening riff, and the best Hammond organ solo this side of Deep Purple. Hitch A Ride is another classic; starting out with soft, acoustic guitars, it suddenly whips itself up into a magnetic frenzy of swirling electric guitars and keyboards at about the minute-and-a-half point, and then only gradually calms itself down to end with a masterful guitar solo.  Something About You is that Gotta have ya, have ya song that we all remember as one of the FM staples after More Than A Feeling had worn itself out of airplay.  And, of course, the unforgettable album closer Let Me Take You Home Tonight which, sadly, still does not do itself justice to this day; the sped-up final minute and a half always sounded out of place to me in contrast to the songs first three minutes.  But the first three minutes are a magical acoustic/electric mix that shows off Boston's soft side. <br />This entire album is still one of the best 37 musical minutes you're likely to spend.  BOSTON is simply one of the greatest rock'n'roll albums ever; it's one of those coveted 'desert island discs'. Buy it on CD--and just remember to turn it *up*!!!! MOST RECOMMENDED
B0000640VO|3.0|As with many foriegn films you have to leave your brain turned on.  Its not a mindless free ride like so many Hollywood movies these days.  However, this is not one of those confoundingly weird French films either. It has a story line that you can understand without having just completed film school.  The movie is actually quite humorous and very original.  Also, if you are familar with Jung's theory of synchronicity you may find some sequences in this film particularly interesting.
0316666343|5.0|This was one of the best books I've ever read.  Alice Sebold uses an incredibly imaginative way of expressing her perception of what heaven COULD be like.  This is the sort of book that draws you into the lives of the characters, makes you think, and at the same time is highly entertaining.  It's so hard to classify this book as just one genre, there's mystery, romance, even a little horror, rolled up into one story.  Reading this book will make you laugh, cry, and envoke so many other human emotions within you, but when it's all said and done you'll have this sense of peace and be just a little more comfortable with the idea of death.
B000055ZB8|4.0|This film, the first Dracula, is an intruiging and brilliantly eerie horror starring the deliciously ugly Max Schreck as Nosferatu (Count Orlock.)<BR>The DVD looks quite nice, considering the age and the fact that this was once thought lost. The surprisingly good extras include an analysis of the Phantom Carriage Ride, Liner Notes, Then and Now Photos, Picture Gallery, and an Unbelievably expert commentary by Lokke Heiss.<BR>If you're a horror fan or a silent movie fan, you could do a lot worse than buy this.
B000URDE2Y|5.0|What can I say about BRIDGE OF SIGHS? It's definitely the best album that Robin Trower ever released, bar none. Trower's guitar work is rooted in deep blues, as are the lead vocals of the late James Dewar. Some metal fans have sided with authority figures against me for saying that all good hard rock/metal guitar has some connection to the blues, but they're either ignorant of how rock & roll got started, or plain racist. Anyone who's seen A CINDERELLA STORY, where an African-American district attorney saves the girl from a life of drudgery near the end, should see the blues even in bands like Journey, Night Ranger,  Shooting Star, and Sammy Hagar,  which hopefully will take them back to this one, Foghat's 70s music, Montrose's self-titled debut, anything by any incarnation of Lynyrd Skynyrd, ZZ Top's first six albums, Molly Hatchet's late-70s/early 80s work, Ted Nugent's 70s-early 80s material,  Blackfoot's 70s-early 80s recordings, and Johnny Winter's 70s hard blues-rock stuff. At any rate, this CD outclasses anything by Yngwie Malmsteen or Steve Vai, the latter of whom has cited Trower as an influence. This is a CD that you must own in order to appreciate hard rock and metal's blues roots.
B00005YJMX|4.0|Werner Herzog's remake of FW Murnau's &quot;Nosferatu&quot; is a masterpiece in its own right. It's eery, shocking, suspensful, and it contains a truly great performance by Klaus Kinski as the tortured vampire.<BR>This special edition DVD is Anchor Bay's second release of &quot;Nosferatu the Vampyre&quot; (it had an earlier release as a flipper.) This time, it's a two disc set, and it has new menu designs...and that's about it.<BR>The DVD looks good enough, but it looks nearly identical to the first release. The earthy colours look best in daytime. When night comes, there's some heavy grain.<BR>The extras are a marvelous audio commentary by Werner Herzog, a mediocre &quot;Making Of&quot; documentary, some eery trailers, biographies, and a little booklet with some poster art.<BR>The packaging is lovely, though
B000000WA2|5.0|For their fourth outing, 1995's \\"The Great Escape,\\" Blur wonderfully combine the successes of their previous two albums, \\"Modern Life is Rubbish\\" and \\"Parklife.\\"  This last piece of their fan dubbed \\"Life Trilogy\\" is the darkest material they have explored and the most musically over the top.  Huge production, stings, horns, and electronica all mix with their trademark witty Britpop.  <br />\\"Country House,\\" Blur's first #1 single (beating out Oasis' \\"Roll With It\\" in a much hyped band war) is a startling song about the drudging, depressed life of a millionaire in his country house.  It's upbeat tempo carefully masks the dark tale that sings \\"Blow Blow me out I am so sad I don't know why.\\"  <br />The centerpiece of the album is the simply bigger than life \\"The Universal.\\"  The song is virtually a lullabye with orchestration, and Damon Albarn's gentle voice echoing over and over \\"Yes it really, really, really could happen.\\"  It's darkness shows itself after several listens with lines like \\"The future has been sold,\\" and minor key staccato violins.<br />\\"Yuko & Hiro\\" the last track of the album (aside from a brief hidden instrumental reprise of \\"Ernold Same\\") is a beautiful electronic song describing the longing between an overworked Japanese couple.  The story, perhaps inspired by Albarn's own relationship with Elastica's Justine Frischmann, is the first hint that Blur will leave Britpop, a musical genre they helped to create, but more than that is a truly fantastic song.<br />Common with Blur releases is the high quality of the album packaging.  Interesting and intruiging art and photography make for a booklet that is almost as good as the album itself.  Based on the concept of a desire to escape the overbearing suburban world that was taking hold in Britain at the time, the design team at Stylorouge did a brilliant job.<br />What makes \\"The Great Escape\\" so powerful is its subtle textures.  More listens provide greater rewards from what is perhaps Blur's densest album.  The seemingly unsinkable, almost bubbly nature of Britpop soon reveals the paranoia of invasion from a world of yuppies, CEO's and members of the country club.  With production that makes the album sound gigantic, Blur has never sounded so clear and personal.<br />This album is not so much a sequal to \\"Parklife\\" as a dark mirror of it.  The tales of Londoners found in \\"Parklife\\" have been replaced by the twisted secret lives of suburban dwellers here.  For Blur fans this album is a gem and I recommend it as highly as possible.  But for an introduction to Blur I think I would start with something else, most likely \\"Blur: the Best of\\" or \\"Parklife.\\"  A challenging album that never ceases to entertain me.<br />-Justin M. Freiberg

B000059XXZ|5.0|It was nothing less than pure genius of Tim Burton to give the cartoonish image of Batman a 180 degree transmutation. Gone are the campy elements perpetuated by the 1960's television series. Burton's film noir-like vision of the DC Comic is intensely stylish and dark, putting the Gothic into Gotham.<br />\\"Batman\\" opens with a nihilistic, almost surreal depiction of Gotham City. In a city governed by violence and corruption, the mayor is struggling to restore confidence in the denizens before Gotham's 200th anniversary celebration takes place. Meanwhile, a mysterious vigilante dressed as a bat is executing his own war on crime. When the psychotic gangster, Jack Napier, is cozened into burglarizing a chemical factory, the Caped Crusader gives him an appointment with a vat of chemicals that transforms him into the Joker, an eternally simpering clown who hatches an insidious plot against the citizens of Gotham city. Action-packed entertainment ensues.<br />Tim Burton balances the dark tone of the film with just the right amount of tongue in cheek, as evident in several bitingly witty scenes. Michael Keaton's cleverly eccentric portrayal of Batman/Bruce Wayne imbues the character with as much dimensionality as it can bare. Jack Nicholson's sardonic performance as the maniacal Joker is simply brilliant. There are also several other superb performances including Kim Basinger as Vicki Vale, Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon, and Michael Gough as Bruce Wayne's genteel butler, Alfred. Danny Elfman's supremely original and stylish score is a classic, fitting the Gothic mood of the film like a well-tailored suit. Along with an engaging story and colorful characters, \\"Batman\\" is replete with astonishing eye candy and clever tricks like the sleek-looking Batmobille, and the Baterang. \\"Where does he get those wonderful toys?\\" The Batwing is one of the most spectacular contraptions (contraption is misnomer) ever to streak across the silver screen. The action scenes are expertly choreographed and entertaining. And the climactic battle between Batman and The Joker in the Gotham City Cathedral is a satisfying finish. This is the way to make a film based on a comic book!reographed and entertaining. And the climactic battle between Batman and The Joker in the Gotham City Cathedral is a satisfying finish.

B000009O8A|3.0|Getting back to the series of reviews I did on exploitation horror films like &quot;The New York Ripper&quot; and &quot;Zombie,&quot; I now take the time to analyze the fiercely disturbing &quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot; from writer-director Meir Zarchi. I'd seen the box for this film on movie store walls since I was about ten, and had been interested in seeing it ever since, but had always ended up passing it up for something else. Was it worth the wait? Yes. Could it have waited longer? You bet. It is a good film, but it's far from being a great film. The cult appeal of it is obvious. It was made on a low budget with shoestring cinematography and almost no makeup effects whatsoever. The makeup effects we do see are bad, so it's no wonder Zarchi decided to hide that gruesome castration behind the porcelain wall of a bathtub. Such things are better left to the imagination, as John Carpenter has pointed out to us; how it will look in the audiences mind is infinitely more terrifying. Zarchi isn't of that school though, and the violence in this film is put on display wholesale for us to digest and possibly throw up. &quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot; is a merciless film.<br />The plot of the film is simple: A woman rents a cabin out in the woods, craving peace, quiet, and solitude to work on her first novel. She is quite attractive, and this is the first thing four men in town happen to notice when she stops by a gas station and later on gets a visit from the grocery boy. They decide to rape her. Very simple, and very disgusting, to think that there might actually be men in the world who think this way. And even more frightening yet to see the consequences of this way of thinking executed on screen in a series of vicious rapes and beatings that make the rape scene in &quot;The Accused&quot; look like passionate, consentual sex. Just when you think all the turmoil for this young woman is over, after she's forced to walk back home, naked, through the woods, stepping through mud and grit and trees with sharp branches, there's more to come. It seems like it never ends. Even the one man we have hope for betrays our trust, and hers. I was sick to my stomach by the time this was finally done. I know this was the reaction Zarchi was going for, but he could've done it with more style and less grit. Yes, this is disturbing, and most people might think it'd be disservicing the material to stylize it in anyway, but there really is a question of going too far here. As I've previously stated, when it's left up to our imagination, it's infinitely more terrifying. Nonetheless, the rape scenes, because they are so brutal and straightforward in their heinous nature, what ensues afterward seems justified. By the time the woman heals, we are already rooting for her, and we are one hundred percent with her when her plan to launch deadly revenge against the four men who attacked her goes into action.<br />On that level, I recommend this movie. It's hardcore, stomach-churning, and all-out girl-powered. The four guys in the movie are the reasons why some women hate men. ... The men in this movie are pigs. And we rejoice in the revenge of this young woman after she was sodomized again and again by the absolute bottom of the male gene pool. &quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot; is a dish best served cold.gh mud and grit and trees with sharp branches, there's more to come.

B00006AFUR|5.0|Much props to Jared and Shannon Leto for putting together a great album.  30STM is original, innovative, and talented.  Even if you are not a fan of the genre, you will still enjoy this music.  My picks from the album:  Capricorn, Fallen, Oblivion, Welcome to the Universe, and The Mission.  You won't be disappointed!
B000002UA5|4.0|Thank goodness this flawed masterpiece is finally available on CD! The old records were stamped on cheap vinyl that scratched easily. (I went through two.) This album was recorded during a transitional period for the band. Roger Waters hadn't quite found his \\"voice\\" as the creative leader, and David Gilmour's guitar playing was given to a lot of unpolished, unfocused noodling. If you think Dark Side of the Moon marked the REAL start of Pink Floyd's career, you'll probably find Ummagumma too vacuous and rambling. But if, like me, you lamented the band's defection to the commercial \\"dark side,\\" Ummagumma just might be your cup of tea. The live CD is scrape-the-inside-of-your-veins-with-a-rusty-rake great! The lengthy songs popular in this era gave music time to develop, growing from hushed intros to frantic credenzas. Cases in point: Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun, Astronomy Domine and the legendary Careful With That Axe, Eugene. There's a lot of pompous, churchy organ and a few ill-advised, \\"high-concept\\" songs that are short on structure and long on sound effects. Most of the studio tracks are best viewed as experimental curiosities. The highlight of the studio disk is Granchester Meadows, which is as close as most of us will ever come to an out-of-body experience. Perfect stress buster.
B00004RFFW|5.0|Is the first \\"Lethal Weapon\\" a better movie? Yes. Is the sequel more fun? Big time.<br />Blasting out of the gate with a car-chase opening (a dual pursuit, no less), \\"Lethal Weapon 2\\" never lets your attention wane. Even scenes without high-octane action are packed full of humorous punchlines, and true \\"buddy movie\\" chemistry. <br />The plot, involving ruthless South African drug dealers hiding behind diplomatic immunity, mainly serves as an excuse to shoot lots of bad guys, and knock over stilt-houses. This may sound like a criticism. Believe me, it's praise. By the way, it turns out that Riggs has a rather personal connection to this band of thugs...<br />The tone of \\"Lethal Weapon 2\\" is much lighter than the orginal's. We put aside Riggs' emotional trauma, and set him up for more good-natured insanity. He's still a lunatic, but he's no longer a morose psychopath. The bond between he and Murtaugh is captured perfectly, particularly in one scene involving a booby-trapped toilet.<br />Joe Pesci contributes some great stuff as the annoying Leo Getz, but it's Ed Murphy (played by Steve Kahan) who deserves some attention. He's introduced in the original, but this film establishes him as the cantankerous, F-bomb-dropping captain who has to put up with Riggs and Murtaugh's constant shenanigans.<br />This DVD version contains some forgettable extra footage. Doesn't detract from this movie in the least!<br />Bullets, explosions, Patsy Kensit, and a nail-gun. What's not to like?
B0000029AP|5.0|TOYS IN THE ATTIC is the album the AEROSMITH really found their groove with. This is without a doubt their moment in the sun, the musical pinnacle they have only climbed once since then with PUMP. This album just rocks and is a great slab of pure unadultrated rock n roll at its best. UNCLE SALTY takes on the subject of child abuse long before JANIE GOT A GUN. WALK THIS WAY is a true classic that unknow to the band would help to breath life back into their career alittle over 10 years later. The title track is just fast and furious the way music should be. YOU SEE MY CRYING is one of the greatest rock ballads of all time. ADAMS APPLE and SWEET EMOTION are probably my 2 favorite AEROSMITH songs from their entire history. NO MORE NO MORE, ROUND AND ROUND are sometimes overlooked for the great rock songs they are. BIG TEN INCH RECORD is a humorous tongue in cheeck tune that helps to break up the mood of the album. This album is a true masterpiece and hey everyone should have it.
B00005K3LU|5.0|Every so often, a movie comes along that creates its own \\"sub-genre.\\"<br />Bruce Willis stars as a guy (who happens to be a New York cop) stuck in a Los Angeles high-rise full of terrorists. Pretty simple formula.<br />What sets this movie apart is the sheer intelligence of the script, the rock-solid performances of the cast, and the staggering action sequences.<br />Willis proved nay-sayers wrong with his ability to carry this picture, and rightly so. His John McClane is vulnerable, tough, and funny as heck. His over-the-radio comraderie with Sgt. Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson) provides a nice amount of male-bonding.<br />Hart Bochner,  Alexander Godunov, and Paul Gleason also contribute quality performances.<br />Plus, you get an appearance by Al Leong, one of the best supporting bad guys in Hollywood, as a snack-hungry villain.<br />However, no discussion of \\"Die Hard\\" is complete without focusing on Alan Rickman. As the mastermind of this hostile takeover, Rickman portrays the most charismatic bad guy in movies. Ever. His performance is seamless--switching from smooth, sly evil to threatening charm without skipping a beat.<br />The plot is never dull, perfectly structured, and packs a wallop of a twist.<br />The only minor story flaw: the \\"surprise\\" reappearance of a fallen bad guy. This ain't \\"Friday the 13th\\" - it doesn't NEED to be.<br />That's just nit-picking. The movie as a whole overcomes this misstep. <br />This movie appears on television almost constantly. Ignore it--buy the DVD and experience the room-shaking explosions in their purest form. The DVD is fully loaded with bonus features, but it doesn't need them. The movie would be worth owning all by itself.<br />You've heard other films described as \\"'Die Hard' on a _____.\\" It's easy to see why everyone jumped on the bandwagon.
B0000029AL|5.0|The opening line of the first song on AEROSMITH debut album sums up what the future of the band would become. Long before they became the greatest American rock n roll band, they were just 5 guys from Boston jamming. The album is a great debut album from the band. Long before they were the MTV darlings, this album is just balls to the walls rock n roll. The sound is still unpolished, but at this time the band was a diamond in the rough that just needed the time to shine as they later would. MAKE IT, DREAM ON, MAMA KIN, WALKIN THE DOG, SOMEBODY in my opinion are standout tunes that rock. If you have been along time fan, then you need to add this to your collection. Newer fans might not be able to grove to this. It is more raw, bluesy, than their latest releases. This is a slab of no nonsense straight ahead rock 'n' roll to groove to. I think that the listener will really enjoy this and appreciate the disc.
B00003CXE7|5.0|You know that moment in a movie when something happens that is so cool, you involuntarily sit bolt upright and yell \\"NICE!!!\\"?<br />\\"Gladiator\\" has more than one of those.<br />Heck, Russell Crowe's double-punch smackdown on Joaquin Phoenix alone is worth the price of this DVD.<br />Obviously, any gladiator-movie worth its salt has to have plenty of combat, and Ridley Scott's film is no disappointment. The pace of the film slows down periodically -- but every twenty minutes or so, a massive fight scene breathes new life (and death) into the picture. It's not a flawless movie, but it's pretty rich in detail for an action epic.<br />The DVD comes fully loaded, so you get plenty of bonus features. It's gratifying to see such a monster action-movie get such prestige treatment.
B000069AUI|5.0|I really liked Coldplay's first album, Parachutes, and I thought that there was no way their second album could be anywhere near as good. I was wrong. A Rush of Blood to the Head is awesome--the lyrics are just as poetic, the music just as gorgeous. The amount of skill and craftsmanship put into this album really comes through. I saw them in concert recently and they were great, now I can't wait until a third album comes out.
0790729342|5.0|Most people consider \\"The Godfather, Part II\\" the best sequel of all time. They're wrong.<br />\\"The Road Warrior\\" is a stand-alone followup to \\"Mad Max,\\" which was a pretty lame movie. Taking what worked from the first movie (explosive car-chases), ditching the rest, and adding elements of classic Westerns, \\"the Road Warrior\\" blows the first film off the pavement.<br />Mel Gibson returns as Max, who has become a laconic wraith wandering a war-ravaged wasteland in search of gasoline. He must choose sides when he comes across a refinery under seige by a band of pillaging maniacs. His journey from mercenary to savior provides the haunting, inspiring subtext for the film, while the spectacular stunts keep your eyes fixed on the screen.<br />Best moment: When Max hangs out the door of a tanker-truck, blasting through the windshield of a pirate in pursuit.<br />Give this DVD a try--you'll forget you're only watching a movie.
B00006G9KW|4.0|I found this book to be a good page-turner, the kind you might rip through over a day or two on vacation. As with all Follett books the depth of research and historical accuracy are stunning. The plot and characters are bit more shallow than his other works; if you loved (as I did) &quot;Pillars of the Earth&quot; than this one may be a bit of a disappointment. Contrary to other reviewers I thought the timeline and methods the protagonist used to recover his memory were very plausible, but some of the action (especially the climactic scene, jeeesh give me a break!) depend too much on coincidence.
B00005OAIE|5.0|First, I have to say that comparing John Mayer to Dave Matthews is already tired, and terribly unfair. Yes, at first listen, John sounds a bit like Dave... but allow yourself to really enjoy \\"Room for Squares\\" and you'll quickly hear major differences between the two. Whereas, Dave Matthew's voice is elastic and twangy, John Mayer exhibits more smoothness and smokiness. But enough about that... Mayer himself has never prided himself much as a singer; it the songs that matter, and \\"Room for Squares\\" is chockful of clever, enthralling, interesting, catchy well-written songs that invite you into Mayer's introspective and entirely-human world. I don't think there's a soul out there who can't identify with \\"My Stupid Mouth\\", the light-hearted examination of saying the exact wrong thing at the exact wrong time. \\"Your Body is a Wonderland\\" is Mayer's second single (the first was the uber-hooky \\"No Such Thing\\"); it proves to be the nicest song about sex ever written. I'm a fan of \\"The Great Indoors\\" and it's mild approval of world-weary paranoia... and \\"Love Song for No One\\" is, without a doubt, the finest pop song crafted in the past 10 years. The best part about this album is its accessibility; I'm 40 years old now... and while I'm no old poop, I do find it hard to get into much of today's music (so much of it is rap... it is me, or does it all sound alike?) John Mayer's blend of folk, rock, and jazz, infused with sentiments from his own version of soul, help make this the first album I've gone really crazy for in a long time. This kid has got major talent... snag this album and hear for yourself.
B000003TA4|5.0|At the time this album was releaased, truly good rock albums were few and far between. If they were starting to grow on their debut album, then they bloomed with this one. The sound was something different and definitely fresh. To this day, it still sounds fresh. If you like classic albums, this is highly recommended. It's one for the ages.
020530902X|5.0|I was first exposed to this book in a high school senior writing class and it taught me more about writing than I ever expected to learn.  It is concise and a breath of fresh air in the face of the complicated world of grammar and writing styles.  I now work with high school students and always use it to help them as they learn to become better writers.
B00006FXB6|5.0|This album is amazing, 'no one knows', 'go with the flow' and 'millionaire' are amzing songs. Josh Homme's excellent guitar and vocals combined with Dave Grohls drumming make this and amazing listening experience. With an outstanding free DVD with 5 songs (including songs from their last album) it makes the album even more of an amzing deal.......SO BUY IT!!
630529142X|4.0|This is a good Adam Sandler movie. He plays Bobby Boucher a slow-minded waterboy who has been teased throughout his life. All of his anger builds up and he unleashes the force. Who's laughing now Big Show? Not even his mother (Kathy Bates) can stop him now. Just keep eating those crocodiles you noisy beast. Henry Winkler plays Bobby's coach and he even has a tattoo of Roy Orbison on his rear! Funny movie.
B000005J56|4.0|This is just an all out great treasure trove of songs. If you at all are interested in afro-latin jazz -- or world music -- you will get a lot of enjoyment of of this collection. <br />Check out the DVD counterpart as well to soak in the full flavor of that which is the Buena Vista Social Club. High praise.
B00000K3UU|3.0|Adam Sandler is Sonny and he has to take care of his friend's kid. The boy smells, wets his pants and watches the worst television programming anybody could watch. At least Sonny taught him a thing or two about tripping roller bladers and getting the ladies' attention. Hey, he was good for something! Sonny's friend, a delivery guy couldn't read and McDonald's should have an earlier lunch menu. Over time, Sonny and Frankenstein bonded like father and son, something Sonny never had. It was truly heart warming. Just kidding. A good Sandler movie.
B000002NHN|5.0|A friend of mine loaned me the CD for a trip back from Delaware to Florida.  I didn't start listening to it until I started out on the Skyline Drive in Front Royal, VA.  I listened to the CD over and over and over again, never once considering a change of music.  When I got to certain parts of the Skyline Drive or Blue Ridge Parkway, the combination of music and scenery brought me to tears several times.  For me, this album was a turning point in my life.  It made me forget about all of my worries and took me into a different realm as I drove through the mountains and tree covered roads.  Even now that I am back from my trip, I can listen to the music and close my eyes and relive my wonderful journey through the mountains.  If you are planning a long trip, this CD is an absolute must.
B00004Y9PP|5.0|I have no idea what &quot;Pitch Black&quot; was about, but Vin Diesel cussed a lot. All I know it was dark and these creatures came out from the hidden and started to eat people. Vin Diesel of course survived because he's pretty much immortal. Just listen to what he says, it's comedy.
0671646788|5.0|este es un libro extraordinario que todo el mundo deberia leer, incluso nios. ensea que cualquier pensamiento que el cerbro pueda concebir puede ser logrado. es un libro que deberian colocarlo en todos los colegios y universidades de todo el mundo.
0385503954|5.0|This book was a gift, and I had no idea what it was about before I starting reading it.  By the end of the book, I was blown away--I had to take a long walk and think about it all.  This a beautifully written book, and the story was amazing.
B00004TLN3|4.0|Arguably not Jane Austin's best work, the book is nevertheless worth reading and the same can be said of the movie.  It was fairly well done and well cast and sticks pretty close to the book.  Don't make this the first movie about a Jane Austin book that you read.  If you do, you may not watch another.  This book (and movie) is an acquired taste.  If you're an Austin fan, you'll like it.  If you're not, you might like it.  Don't expect another &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; or &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; because the book was nothing like them.  But it is a good story about a young girl who constantly reads what would today be called &quot;Gothic Romance&quot; mysteries.  When she gets to go out into the world, she is looking for mysteries everywhere, only to learn that the real world is not the same as the literary world.  They handled the heroine's book-influenced day-dreaming very well.  And it has a typically-Austin good ending.
0553573403|5.0|I am a long time Jordan fan who was looking for a fantasy to read until the next WOT installment is out.  What I found in Game of Thorns is more than just a fantasy to tide me over.  I found a great fantasy that is on par with the best the genre has to offer.<br />What makes the story great are the characters.  Opposed to the typical good versus evil, Martin gives us characters that fall in the grey area in between the extremes of good and evil.  The most likable and heroic characters are at times truly despicable, and the most craven and vile characters are sometimes heroic and likable.  All this adds up to an enjoyable story that is difficult to put down.
B00005JLIU|5.0|If you like silly movies, but don't really like visual humor, this is a better choice.  It's a great movie and you see more in it each time you watch.  I loved the way you get to see Julie Andrews' thoughts (as Millie) in little signs held up like the silent movie era.  Those of Chinese ancestry might not appreciate some of the humor, but you must remember this is a movie about the 1920's and the term politically correct had not been coined!  And it's so zany, there's really nothing  harmful in it.  Millie is a secretarial school graduate, determined to get a job and marry her boss.  The songs are outstanding and the casting was inspired.  Mary Tyler Moore plays a rich-girl-going-out-into-the-world to perfection and words can't describe Andrews as Millie (check out the opening song, where she buys a devise designed to make \\"full fronted\\" girls have the flat look that is in vogue.  As she buys a pack of cigarettes--we must be modern at all costs-- it comes undone and the vendor does a double take as her \\"front\\" expands quickly!)  Carol Channing is her usual crazy self as Muzzie, who has instructors teaching her everything from fighting to flying (with romance on the side!)and she does a great song about jazz.  This is a great movie!
B00003CXAY|1.0|Koyaanisqatsi - I saw this film years ago and remembering it has always been a source of amusement for me. If you enjoy listening to a 2 year old incessantly banging on a toy piano, you might really like this film. The photography is quite good and to be honest the film does achieve its purpose. I might go ahead and get the dvd just because I was so irritated the first time I saw this film. I have not seen Powaqqatsi.
038533558X|5.0|This book is exceptional and Mr. Coben is outstanding in his genre!  In the true form of good mystery, Mr. Coben captures the reader with creative wit and poignant simplicity in an intriguing tale blurring the lines of good and evil in his fascinating characters. This is a page turner!!
B000069AUI|5.0|Short and sweet: this album is as good as the first, if not better. It has that great British-guitar-rock-sometimes mellow-sometimes not-pseudo-pop sound. You can listen to this cd the whole way through without having to skip any bad songs because there are none. I love it.
B00004W221|5.0|I didn't find Rudy the most entertaining movie of all time.  However, I fully believe that people can do whatever they want, as long as they believe it themselves, they are willing to work hard for it, and they are persistant.<br />This movie brings that message together and delivers is perfectly.  I truly believe that if this idea is implemented it will change your life--it did mine.  Thanks Rudy!
B00002Z88D|5.0|I have to laugh at the stupidity of all these headbanger purists who choose to knit pick at irrelevant details in order to find a way to put this album down. Those are same people that like bands such as slayer and other death metal [noise] which contain repetative fast riffs and lack musical quality. The reason why Metallica has a broad legion of fans and admirerers is because they have one thing those bands don't which is musical talent.<BR>In my opinion, this album is brilliantly done in the way it combines metal and classical music. I especially love the way the orchestra plays the introduction to \\"Hero of the day\\" and \\" Nothing else matters\\". It seemed those songs needed that element to make it trully great.\\"For whom the bells toll\\" was done exceptionally well especially when the sypmphony subsituted one of the bass riffs in the begining which was something that gave that song a more powerfull nature. In fact this whole album has a melodic yet powerfull nature. This is a perfect example of how Heavy metal music has roots to classical music.<BR>The best way to describe the attitude of this album is to imagine your in the battle fields of ancient england with tens of thousands of knights on the warpath resulting in fierce battle.
6305265666|5.0|I have never been a big fan of Drew Barrymore before, but I must admit, she did a wonderful job in this movie. Angelica Houston is always a marvel and the reason I decided to watch the movie. This movie is now a favorite of mine and one I can watch over and over again without losing interest in the characters. This Cinderella version is more realistic to recent times in that Danielle (Barrymore) isn't a helpless, weak female that is dependent on a prince to save her life. Instead, Danielle saves him emotionally and spiritually. This love story really tugs at the heart strings and is the dream that the little girl within our hearts hopes to find one day.
6304884419|2.0|I am a huge Robert De Niro fan. I love gangster genre movies. This film was really bad in my opinion. Extremely predictable to the point of nausea and the audience is force fed the rights and wrongs of life to the point where you want to throw this movie out the window. I also saw it when it first opened in theaters and I was really let down.<br />There are a few good moments, all in all not the worst movie ever. There is no way this can be ranked with any of De Niro's really great movies though. If he was trying to use everything he learned from Scorscese he must not have learned too much.<br />Again, this is my humble opinion. What do I know? But if you are thinking of buying this, make sure you rent it first. I wouldn't want this movie in my house.
B000063S6Z|5.0|Well, it's been a couple months since 18 was released and it hasn't gone platinum, or gold (I think...), but that's because people just can't realize that Moby never makes the same record twice.  For example, people who became fans of him during his early years may have felt betrayed by Everything Is Wrong, because it was a industrial/punk/mood/ambient/techno/house/dance music mix (like the last half of the album is really anti-techno).  Then those who became fans of him with Everything is wrong might have felt betrayed by the industrial/punk Animal Rights.  Then people who became fans of him with Animal Rights might have felt betrayed of Play, his breakout album.  Now, people just can't seem to adjust to Moby circa 2002.  It seems that everyone expects the kind of music he made in 1999 should be repeated in 2002.  Well, things in this world have changed (does 9/11 ring a bell?)  Now on to the songs...  There are many songs that could be dance/techno hits, if they were remixed.  In This World for example, would be perfect if someone added techno beats and sped up the tempo.  \\"Extreme Ways\\" is a great song, that needs no remixing to make it a hit.  I also heard that Moby was seeing if Vanessa Carlton (one of the best new artists of 2002) would work on a remix of \\"Sunday (The Day...)\\" which would be really cool.  \\"Jam For The Ladies\\" is another one of those perennial dance hits I metioned earlier.  \\"Harbour\\" is another one of the best songs on the record.  Also, it's one of Moby's earliest (written about 19 years ago during one of NY's hottest summers).  Lastly, \\"Rafters\\" is a great house song and an excellent candidate for remixing.  So remember, Moby doesn't make the same record twice.  SO DON'T KEEP SAYING THIS IS BAD BECAUSE IT'S NOT ...!!!!
B00005RY7X|5.0|This album is full of good, clean party hard songs.  It is a feel good, kick ... and rock hard album.  I highly recommend this C.D.!!!!!
B0000024ZI|5.0|The album from Mott the Hoople that was considered by most fans to be the End, the Beginning and the End. Confused? Let me explain. After four critically acclaimed, but poorly selling albums, numerous sell out shows all across Europe and early forays into the United States, the group of five musicians collectively known as Mott the Hoople decided to call it a day after a particularly disastrous concert in Switzerland. \\"The End\\".<br />Upon hearing this, David Bowie a huge Mott the Hoople fan, persuaded them to keep at it, gave them the song \\"All The Young Dudes\\", offered to produce their next album, persuaded Tony Defines to take the band onto his management label Mainman, buy them out of their contract with Island, and got them re-signed on a new contract to C.B.S. The Beginning.<br />Although all this brought Mott the Hoople, and particularly Ian Hunter, international success, it also hastened the departure of keyboard player Verden Allen, never to be heard of again on the international rock scene; and guitar player/second vocalist Mick Ralphs, who went off to form \\"Bad Company\\" with Paul Rodgers and we all know what's happened to them. The End.<br />But free from the pressures of their Island contract, Mott, under Bowie's guidance, produced an absolute corker.<br />Opening with a Rockin cover of Lou Reed's \\"Sweet Jane\\", taken much faster than \\"Velvet Underground\\" would ever have dared, gave the album an eye opening start. Mott had never heard the original version before recording it just following what Bowie strummed on guitar. In fact, bass player Overend Watts thought the song was called \\"C.J.\\" until he saw the song title written down on the album cover. Nonetheless, a great song and a particular favorite of Mr. Rock 'n' Roll, the D.J. at Tahitian Queen.<br />After hard rockin' self-composed track \\"Momma's Little Jewel\\" comes the Bowie song \\"All The Young Dudes\\", released as a single proceeding the album it had been a top ten hit all over Europe and Motts first top thirty hit in the United States. Although a Bowie written song, Mott had made it their own with Mick Ralphs' guitar playing and Ian Hunter's fantastic rap outro. The album continues with three Mott rockers, all staying in their live set in one form or another until their demise three years later.<br />Then comes Verden Allen's moment of glory, his  second solo composition to be released under the Mott the Hoople banner. Unfortunately it foretold of future trouble, as the title suggests poor old Verden felt he was on \\"Soft Ground\\". It is still one of my favorite Mott the Hoople tracks and is undoubtedly one of the heaviest keyboard sounds ever laid down in a recording studio. The lyrics perhaps tell their own story.<br />\\"Too many people about,<br />Telling me what to do with myself,<br />It's hard to get around<br />Walking on soft ground\\".<br />Mick Ralphs' contributed a superb composition with \\"Ready For Love\\", essentially one song with two hook lines, which Mick later took and re-recorded for Bad Company's debut album.<br />The album closes with the emotional \\"Sea Diver\\" (which was to give its name to Mott the Hoople's fan club). For this David Bowie brought in his co-producer and lead guitarist Mick Ronson, who arranged and conducted dramatic strings and brass for this Ian Hunter composed song ironically written about the difficulty of writing a hit single.<br />The album entered the U.K. charts on 23 September and stayed for four weeks reaching number 21. The Critics acknowledged that it was a much cleaner sounding Mott the Hoople and predictably noted a Rolling Stones \\"feel\\" on many tracks. The British album release contained black and white group photos, the back of the U.S. Jacket featured colour live shots of the band members. The original album sleeve concept had comprised a photo of a young boy brandishing a cardboard cut out guitar by Bob Rock. However, for some reason better known to record company executives, it was changed to a rather bland illustration of three finely attired but slightly threatening \\"Young Dudes\\". See which album cover you think suits Mott the Hoople best. Nonetheless, a ground breaking album setting Mott the Hoople on the fast lane to Rock 'n' Roll stardom.<br />Mott The Dogf three finely attired but slightly threatening \\"Young Dudes\\".

6305014140|2.0|I decided to watch this movie after hearing about how great it is and everything from my other friends who are really into Japanese anime. Before viewing it, I was warned that it was ultra violent but even that didn't prepare me for what was to come. This is without a doubt the most violent cartoon I've ever seen, and that can either be a good thing or a bad thing. Blood sprays accompany nearly every action sequence. However, I found the action sequences to be rather well done, and they were my favorite part of the film. Besides that, there isn't really much here as much of the other material is garbage. I found myself angry for watching the movie after it was over. Simply speaking, watching this movie is like eathing junk food. You know it's terrible for you but something makes you shove it down your throat anyway.
B000002J1M|5.0|I'm mostly into the more pf the Phil Collins era works mainly because I've had little luck in getting the Peter Gabriel era LPs recently until recently when I got my hands on a copy of the album known as Foxtrot and I must say it is an amazing work of art. Unfortunately, Foxtrot is often overshadowed by it's two successors, Selling England By The Pound &amp; The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway. I haven't heard either one of them as when writing this review so I can't really comment on them at this time but as for Foxtrot I feel glad that I now got my hands on it. There is no radio-friendly material like there is on most of the 1975-1991 era albums. This music has very little polish and could be almost opposite to the squeaky clean polish of Invisible Touch which I must admit I love to pieces. The album cover art sets the general mood of the record.<br />Peter Gabriels lyrics have a lot of British humor in the songs and every song on here is absolutely creative and beautiful. This album was well ahead of it's time when it came out in 1972.<br /> Watcher of The Skies is a bizarre 7 minute track with a very bizarre orchestra like intro before it morphs into a funky upbeat track with gorgeous organs, incredible guitar playing by Steve Hackett, and the storytelling lyrics of Peter Gabriels songwriting. Time Table is difficult to explain but it's a truly great song. Get 'Em Out By Friday is a great example of a prog rock track. It showcases a lot of a jazzier and extremely creative sound that the Phil Collin era works lacks. I love how the song quiets down around the 4 and a half minute mark and how it morphs into a quiet and lovely song with very quiet guitar bass and flutes coming in giving a feel of traveling through a town on a snowy afternoon. Can-Utility &amp; The Coastliners is a more Trick Of A Tail-esque song that is somewhat similar to Squonk only not as polished and has less electric guitar and more of the 12 string guitars. Once again it's an amazing song that is one to listen to in order to know how it really is. Horizons is a gorgeous acoustic guitar instrumental that showcases Steve Hacketts guitar playing. It runs at only 1 minute &amp; 41 seconds.<br />The last track of Foxtrot is the 22 minute and 52 second epic piece Supper's Ready. This song is seven songs in one. I'm not going to bother to write this one in detail because it's truly a creative song that I refuse to give anything away about it. It's truly an amazing track though. This song needs a listen! Suppers Ready is a postively hilarious track at times.<br />Part I: Lovers Lane<br />Part II: The Guaranteed Eternal Sanctuary Man<br />Part III: Ikhnaton and Itsacon and Their Band Of Merry Men<br />Part IV: How Dare I Be So Beautiful<br />Part V: Willow Farm<br />Part VI: Apocolypse in 9/8<br />Part VII: As Sure as Eggs Is Eggs<br />Foxtrot is truly one masterpiece and is one of the most creative albums that Genesis have ever made. Fans of Invisible Touch might not easily get into Foxtrot too much because where as Invisible Touch is very polished, Foxtrot is much more raw and less polished than the Phil Collins works.<br />Peter Gabriel truly was a genius when he was with the group. He still is now as a solo artist but he threw alot of creativity into Genesis with his witty songwriting and British Humor.<br />As I'd say sometimes &quot;Invisible Touch, We Can't Dance, 1983 self-titled album, and Calling All Stations, take a back seat for now!&quot; he!he!<br />Foxtrot is a must own!

B0000047CX|5.0|Some say Focus was Stan's best, I think it is this one.  The sax is dreamy, Carlos's guitar has a great backbeat, Astrud's vocal's are superb.  A great way to get away from the daily grind.  Like a day spa for your brain.  Next to Lee Morgan's Sidewinder, my second favorite jazz album.
B000065V9Y|5.0|Six years after the 1986 commercial breakthrough SO, Gabriel returned in 1992 with the follow-up album US. This album unlike SO is brighter and has a lot more worldly sounds than SO. The theme of this album is alot like Phil Collins underrated album Both Sides which came out the following year after this one. The thing that in my opinion makes US a little better than Both Sides is that while US has very similar themes to Both Sides, US has warmth and a bit more depth where as while Both Sides is also an amazing album it sometimes is a bit cold and dreary in atmosphere.<br /> Enought about the US vs. Both Sides ranting. This 1992 album while it is generally melancholy in sound it has it's share of humor. US finds Pete embracing the colorful worldly African sounds but not forgetting his rock roots. Steam was the big hit off this CD and with a video that in my opinion surpasses it's companion video Sledgehammer by a hair mainly because of the more cutting-edge technology. Steam is alot like Sledgehammer with lots of the trumpets, humor, creativity, and sex appeal. However on the flip side there are some very melancholy tunes like the gentle Washing Of The Water and the eerie 14 Black Paintings which I consider to be the echoing effects of Passion. Overall though, this CD isn't very dark and is actually quite joyous in spite of it's moody content.  The album closes with the warmth and joyous atmosphere of the final track Secret World. Love To Be Loved is absolutely gorgeous with a very dramatic melody not all that dissimilar to Red Rain although maybe not as intense. Overall in fact, I think that US is actually brighter and less ominous than SO and while I think UP is a bit more consistent, US has some warmth, and joy that is mostly missing off that dark masterpiece. <br /> This album was very well produced but the remastering improves it and brings out more dimensional details in the music, especially on Digging In The Dirt, and Washing Of The Water. In fact, it's so well improved in the remastering that it almost feels like a new Peter Gabriel album. <br />The limited edition digipak that the remastered edition was packaged in, is inferior to the older jewelcase cover. The digipak is mostly made of some kind of cardboard paper and there is little if any difference in the liner notes between the limited digipak and the regular clear jewel case. Also what's wrong is that when the hinge in digipak breaks, there's no way to replace it like a regular CD jewelcase. I have no idea why they still release CDs with this idiotic packaging design nor do I see any appeal in the flimsy design of the digipak. <br />Sadly, there aren't any bonus tracks included on here. I would've been more than happy to hear the hidden gems that Gabriel recorded but did not put on the album. It also would've been better to hear outtake or alternate demos of the songs. In fact, I think the limited edition should've done that, have bonus material included. Geffen should've looked at Tears For Fears first three albums being re-issued with the bonus tracks and liner notes. Unfortunately, there aren't liner notes telling about the history of the albums making either. <br />A great album that was poorly handled in it's re-issue, US is nonetheless another greal album that deserves a place in every PG fans' collection. At least it didn't have the track list reshuffled like SO was. It's a pity that the re-issuing couldn't have been better than it was.
B00003CXDG|5.0|First off, let me say that I am a big fan of John Woo.  The man can direct action like no one else.  So I was excited to hear that he would be directing the sequel to Mission Impossible, a personal favorite of mine.  When I finally got to see it, I wasn't disappointed: this is the most stylish action movie I have seen.  But everyone I know, including John Woo fans, hated it.  Sure, it's no Killer or Hard Boiled, but it was very entertaining.  Here's a list of why everyone hates this movie:<BR>1. The plot.  Okay, I'll admit, the plot wasn't that great.  But you don't walk into a movie like this for fascinating plot points. You go to be entertained.<BR>2. Ethan Hunt does things that are not humanly possible.  Well, that may be true, but maybe that's why it's called Mission \\"Impossible\\". C'mon, we all know that you can't do any of those stunts in real life, but it's fun to pretend you can for at least two hours. Sometimes I go to the movies to be intellectually challenged.  But sometimes I just want to let go and have fun.  That's what this movie was made for.  And I loved every second.
B000059PPN|5.0|Anchor Bay are to be commended for releasing classics by directors like Fulci and Argento, even more so for presenting clean transfers (not counting ZOMBIE), in the fullest uncut versions, AND IN THE ORIGINAL ASPECT RATIO.<br />HOUSE's transfer really shows off Fulci's ability to create a magnificent atmosphere, and is evident of his mastery of composition in the 'scope format. <br />The film is one of Fulci's best. It isn't as volcanic as THE BEYOND, but it's probably just as brilliant. It forsakes the Surrealist logic of the former film, it doesn't jump abstractly from one seemingly unconnected moment to the next, and is far more linear in its story telling. But that is not to say that HOUSE shirks the weird nightmare qualities: it just builds up to them a little mre slowly. By the end you'll still feel as though you've been taken into another strange world. The story itself isn't anything special; it plays on certain archetypes of the haunted house flick and the zombie in the cellar set piece. But what elevates this film above such popular classics as NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, the slightly overrated LET SLEEPING CORPSES LIE and others is Fulci's total command of the formal aspects of cinema. The visuals and sounds are unlike anything else. <br />Almost every image in the film is beautiful and melancholy. At times the film has the oneiric quality of dreams and nightmares. Fulci composes his images as a painter would. The link between Fulci's cinema and painting is heightened by the motif of the ghosts in the painting, as the line between the corporeal (the physical world) and the ethereal (the world of ghosts associated with the painting)is blurred until it is obliterated in the haunting finish. Many people will find the atmosphere too depressing, but it enhances the film's power. <br />I must also comment on the music. It perfectly complemented the imagery, and is truly eerie. The acting is good, too, especially Ania Peroni as a weirdo babysitter. The close ups of her eyes are unsettling.<br />Overall, I would highly recommend this for people interested in Euro horror, because this is one of the finest examples. Also, people interested in formalism and poetic cinema combined with horror will also be impressed. It is not for all tastes. It won't satisfy gore hounds because there are only three or four scenes of pure horror. But it's still great.
6305313687|4.0|I saw this movie, and well, it disturbed me. Some scenes were incredibly graphic. I wanted to shield my eyes like a five year old watching a kissing scene in a movie. However, this movie is wonderful in many other ways. It has the whole This Is What Racism Is And It's Bad theme, Edward Norton does a wonderful job portraying a man who has killed because he was a racist and then fighting with the demons of the killing, and the filming technique is brilliant. I can't explain it all, so I will leave you to see this movie on your own. This is one of those movies that everyone should see, but not one that everyone will like. It's more of a movie to be respected.

B00003CY6M|5.0|This movie is wonderful. I went to the theater to see it and fell absolutely in love with it. The movie stars John Cusack as a hopeless romantic in the wonderful New York City. He meets a girl, Sara (Kate Beckinsale- &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;) and falls for her during a romantic night on the town. One problem- she thinks that fate doesn't want them to be together, but tells him she will write her name and number in a book, sell it to used bookstore, and if he finds it, fate wants them to be together. Years pass. He's getting married, she's engaged. Since this is a romantic comedy, it's predictable, but that doesn't matter. The actors are great, the movie is funny, Cusack is adorable, and this movie should NOT be passed up! Rent it, buy it, whatever. You must see this movie!
B000002KKK|5.0|I am a Native Houstonian so I have a certain bias for ZZ TOP.  I am 30 and have listened to them for over 20 years now, and without a doubt they are one of the best American rock bands ever.  Deguello is their best and most complete album, not to mention it is a great party album.  With ZZ Top it is simple, they sing about women, sex, cars and Drugs/alcohol, most times all in the same song.  The opening track is a very blunt sexual cover of \\"Thank You\\" followed by the rockabilly sounding \\"She Loves My Automobile\\" and the classic \\" I'm Bad I'm Nationwide\\".  Every song on the album seems to have the blussiness of their first albums and the pollish of their later radio friendly sound.  The diamond out of all the gems on the album is \\"Cheap Sunglasses\\".  It captures what ZZ Top is all about, the mood and feeling of a rocking blues guitar, bass and drums.  ZZ Top is all about mood and Deguello puts you there.  So go ahaed and get Lowdown in the Streets and party!...
B00006AW2J|5.0|A greatly improved sound even on standard CD players. I heard sounds I hadn't heard on my first 1000 listens on vinyl and previous CD releases.  Listen to the intro to Stray Cat Blues, you can hear more of Mick's voice - could it be a different mix?  The whole album sounds great.  My only complaint is that someone got the spelling of the title wrong on the cover and CD and wrote 'Beggers Banquet' (should be Beggars). Ok, an easy mistake and maybe it will be corrected and make my copy a future collectors item!
B000001FT2|5.0|THIS ALBUM TOTALLY CHANGED MY LIFE.  IT COMBINED FOUR OF MY FAVORITE GENRES OF MUSIC: NEW WAVE/FUNK/SOUL/ REGGAE AND IT'S JUST BRILLIANT FROM START TO FINISH. <br />REGARDLESS OF MS. JONES' BIZARRE APPEARANCE, NIGHTCLUBBING PROVED THAT SHE IS (MUCH) MORE THAN HER GENDER-BENDER MASCULINE STATUESQUE IMAGE.  THIS LADY CAN ACTUALLY SING AND SHE'S QUITE A REMARKABLE SONGWRITER AS WELL (NOTE: YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO THE INFECTIOUSLY FUNKY AND CLEVER \\"FEEL-UP\\" TO KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, KIDS).  <br />TWO OF THE STRONGEST TRACKS FROM THIS ALBUM ARE ACTUALLY COVERS OF PREVIOUS HITS, BILL WITHERS' \\"USE ME\\" AND THE POLICE'S \\"DEMOLITION MAN\\".  IN BOTH INSTANCES, MS. JONES TURNS BOTH SONGS, (WHICH ARE ALREADY FANTASTIC SONGS) INTO SEXY, HYPNOTIC REGGAE-INDUCED JAMS WITHOUT STRIPPING THEM OF THE ESSENCE THAT MADE THEM HITS IN THE FIRST PLACE.  <BR>IN A DAY AND AGE WHERE JUST ABOUT EVERY SONG THAT'S IN THE TOP 40  IS EITHER SAMPLE-HEAVY OR COMPLETELY MADE OVER, BOTH LEADING TO DISASTRIOUS EFFECTS, (DON'T BELIEVE ME? WELL, THEN LISTEN TO BRITNEY SPEARS' SAD RENDITION OF JOAN JETT AND THE BLACKHEARTS' \\"I LOVE ROCK AND ROLL\\".  C'MON. LET'S BE HONEST PEOPLE. THAT SORRY EXCUSE FOR A REMAKE WAS LIKE WATCHING A HARDCORE TRIPLE X PORN FILM SUDDENLY TURN INTO A CHEESY SOAP OPERA LOVE SCENE!), GRACE WAS ABLE TO MAKE THESE SONGS HERS BECAUSE SHE DID NOT SET OUT TO JUST MAKE THEM OVER, SHE WANTED TO GIVE THEM A COMPLETELY NEW IDENTITY.  THAT'S WHAT REAL ARTISTS ARE SUPPOSE TO DO. (TAKE NOTE, MISS SPEARS!)<br />THE BEST SONG ON THIS ALBUM IS IT'S TITLE TRACK. \\"NIGHTCLUBBING\\" IS HAUNTING, SEXY, AND A REMARKABLY ENERGETIC SONG, EVEN  THOUGH IT'S TEMPO IS SLOW AND THE SHORT BUT SERIOUS BASSLINES ARE SWEET AND SEDUCING.  <br />EVEN IF YOU STILL ARE NOT CONVINCED THAT GRACE JONES IS CAPABLE OF BEING MORE THAN A CROSS-DRESSING SCARY WOMAN WITH A TROUBLED HAIRCUT, I TOTALLY GUARANTEE THAT IF YOU GIVE \\"NIGHTCLUBBING\\" A CHANCE, YOU WILL AGREE THAT SHE IS A TOTALLY UNDERRATED ARTIST AND THIS MASTERPIECE NEEDS TO BE IN EVERYONE'S MUSIC COLLECTION!
0684847248|5.0|This is more of a testimonial than a review.  You can read about me on pages 131-133 of Dr. Peck's book.<br />I came to this book backwards: I began with reading \\"People of the Lie.\\"  Surprisingly, \\"Road Less Traveled,\\" and \\"People of the Lie\\" are the exact same book, but written from the opposite points of view.  I was not bored, however, with reading the same book twice, since each book has a different emphasis and each has different proscriptions.  It is just that the concepts are mirror images of each other.  \\"X\\" and \\"-X\\" are both \\"X,\\" with one minor exception!<br />This is a hopeful book.  It is a healthy book.  It deals with reality head on, the bad and bloody along with the good.  What usually puts me off with \\"Self-help\\" books is that they usually sell an attitude, or they are just a paper packaging of the author's temperament.  This book goes beyond this and comes to the startling conclusion that, yes, Virginia, pain does in fact hurt!<br />With that obvious fact accepted (if 9/11 didn't catch your attention, read \\"Job,\\" \\"Lamentations,\\" and \\"Ecclesiastes\\" in the Bible if you have any questions), Dr. Peck calls us to courage and work in developing the spiritual health of other people.  He says that the basis for sin is laziness and selfishness, something that the Mormon prophet Joseph F. Smith taught, and calls us to be men and women of righteousness.<br />This review does his book an injustice since I can't do justice to what he writes.  If you can feel any passion in these words, please buy and live this book.  It has not only changed my life, but it has improved my life immeasurably by bringing me in contact with my better self, and more importantly, God!
B000066NW0|4.0|I really liked this CD from track 1 till the end.  That is a feat not obtained by a majority of albums.<br />The album is a pop-punk style if you had to take the average of the whole. The engineering on this album was fantastic! Musically, it is surprises you just when you thought you had it figured out. Lyrically, the album rings harmonically with feelings that transcend multiple generations.<br />I would ignore any comments about _any_ music that include a description of the portrayed image. Since when had music _ever_ been about image?
B00006AFUR|5.0|this cd is realy good i sugest you buy it no matter what type of music you listen to space rock is good this is a a good cd feat&gt; the keybordsts from deadsy its a must buy album i love it and i know you will to
B00000JGHL|1.0|Not even Pacino can save this bad attempt at political drama. &quot;Boring&quot; is the only word to describe it -- from beginning to end. Actually, I can't attest to the ending. I saw this film when it came out and I walked out of the theatre about an hour into the movie because it was so dreadful.
6303416403|3.0|I remember watching this movie in the theater when I was 3 or 4. I feel asleep for entirely the whole movie! I didn't like this that much,basically because it has not plot, no foot soldiers, and no shredder! I think the first is the best.
076781214X|5.0|This is a suprisingly poignant, genuine, affecting movie and head and shoulders above the over-rated 'Back to the Future'.(Probably because the heroine was alive in the time period she returns to and this gives that time period much greater poignancy, not to mention relevance, than the reliably annoying Michael J. Fox gives to his parent's era. The latter makes mid-50's people seem like idiots because he wasn't born then and clearly knew nothing about those times. I didn't find that dissonance oddly charming or whatever it was supposed to be - just annoying as hell AND PAINFUL to watch. Alot of the characters in that movie were weird, as in unreal, not just strange, and the movie depended on this weirdness for its content, not to mention its (questionable) entertainment value. <br />Peggy Sue is a smooth-flowing exploration of the early 60's from the perspective of the mid 80's combined with teenage experiences from the perspective of a middle-aged mother. This movie has alot of fine moments, as when Kathleen Turner talks to her grandmother on the phone who was deceased in the present time. I've never seen any other time travel movie that makes you gulp like that. Kathleen Turner is great, as are all the supporting actors. Nicholas Cage over-acts and doesn't seem plausible (in real life he wasn't actually born in 1960 and had no feelings for it and actually acted like it was more like 1957 with the hair style and antics), but I guess with his uncle directing it, all that acting was unavoidable. He couldn't ruin this movie but it would have been even better with a more plausible, subtle, even more \\"square\\" guy. I really liked the nerdy genius accomplice and the beatnik boyfriend, as these people are certifiably genuine early 1960's people. The Mom, the Dad, the sister, the girlfriends - who wasn't good?<br />This movie is a straight-down-the-middle time trip for baby-boomers and it takes you out of the park. It's filled with pleasing and facile scenes. It is very well-directed and effortless in capturing its goal.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Episode I is not a bad movie.  It is a well presented opening to the story that is Star Wars.  The symbolism, imagery, and important questions are all answered in this film that we have all been waiting for since Return Of The Jedi.<br />A good story needs good actors to play the characters in the movie, and The Phantom Menace delivers.  I was most impressed with Liam Neeson, who played Obi-Wan Kenobi's master, Qui-Gon Jinn.  The character and the actor playing him held this entire movie together.  I also liked Jake Lloyd as the young prodigy, Anakin Skywalker, and Natalie Portman as Queen Amidala.  The first scene between Anakin and Padme was well written and acted, and won my vote of approval for this film.<br />I also liked the reoccurring theme that was present in the previous 3 Star Wars films that comprised the original trilogy of having characters that aren't what they appear to be.  Because of this, parts of this movie take on a different significance when seeing this movie more than once.<br />The only criticisms that I have of this film are small.  I think that George Lucas could have cut down on the CGI scenes.  CGI scenes look like CGI scenes, which are just a step above the quality of a well animated cartoon.  Jar Jar Binks, although not one of the story's more endearing characters, gets the right amount of screen time, and in my opinion was no more annoying than the teddy bear muppet Ewoks in Return Of The Jedi.  I also thought that scenes regarding Anakin's Jedi training could have used a slight change in written dialogue, but I think I understood what transpired in the movie.<br />Another aspect of this film that takes away from any suspense is that we know what happens to a large number of the main characters because this film is a prequel.  Knowing this influences how viewers may feel about many aspects of this movie.  It would be like reading the last several chapters of a book, then starting by reading the first page of the book.<br />The DVD packaging is presented in a fashion that is well suited to DVD.  What I liked most about the director's commentary of the film was that the name of the person would appear at the top of the screen when they were talking.  Most DVD packages that have director's commentary do not have this feature, and it is often confusing to know who exactly is talking.<br />The second DVD has a twelve part making of Episode I that was originally accessible only by the Internet, along with 5 featurettes that explore certain aspects of the film, and an extended documentary about the making of the film.  There are also 7 deleted scenes which can be viewed either separately, or as a whole with commentary from George Lucas and others in between each deleted scene -- keep watching at the end credits of this version, which shows a Jawa Sandcrawler in overdrive traveling faster over the Tatooine landscape than the racing pods -- I had no idea they could go that fast!  There are also 2 movie trailers, a music video, and 7 television commercials promoting the film.<br />I know that somewhere there is an Easter Egg on one of the DVD's that can be found of bloopers that didn't make the film.
B000067G3C|5.0|The scenes on the bus are a highlight, of course, because that is half the movie, but the elevator and subway scenes are just as suspensful (assuming you can forget that the heroes never die in these movies). The one thing I kept thinking during this film (besides how cute Sandra Bullock was) was that Keanu Reeves really found his niche in action films, and why doesn't he make more of them?
0446310786|5.0|Somehow I managed to avoid reading this book in high school or college.  Then, about 10 years ago I picked up a copy at one of those library sales, thinking I *should* read it at some point.<br />When I finally started, I couldn't put it down until I finished.  Some books are great, but the prose gets so dense, they can be a struggle at times (Cold Mountain, anyone?).  This one was beautifully written, but also a rocket ride of a plot.<br />It's part comedy, part mystery/thriller, part social drama exploring the themes of bigotry and racism, part kids' adventure book, and so much more, all wrapped up in a coming-of-age story.<br />Since then, I've re-read twice more over the years, and given away more than a dozen copies to friends and family members as gifts.  I've tried to watch the movie, but it's flat, boring, missing the spark of excitement that runs throughout the book.<br />I can never shake, either, that this talented woman who wrote this has never published a book since.  I would read ANYTHING published with her name on it as author...
B000067G3C|5.0|This is simply a great action movie and should definately be added to your collections. Speed 1 and 2 were both thrill packed, exciting movies with adventure, romance and of course a whole lot of &quot;What do you do Jack, what do you do!&quot;. Definately a movie worth watching multiple times, and a great one for a surround sound enviroment for many home theaters enthusiasts. I loved it and plan to purchase Speed 2 on here as well (I was going to get the two pack collection, but Speed 2 wouldn't have been widescreen if I recall correctly).
0553260111|5.0|I thought this was a really great book.  It was the first Robert Ludlum novel I read.  Since then I have read many more and I must say his books are good.  The reason I read this book was so I could see the movie.  But the movie isn't about the book at all.  This book is about a man who doesn't know who he is.  And when he is picked up he has very strange abilities for a normal man, or so he thinks.  I won't tell you how the story goes, but it keeps you on the edge of your seat, and you'll want to keep reading.
B000067G3C|5.0|Reeves made his role in this acclaimed high box office hit that rocked his career in 1994.<br />A pair of LA Explosions Squad(Reeves and Daniels) answer a call made by a puplic building where a bomb is set on a elevator full of hostages which is controlled remotely by a mad villain(superb Dennis Hopper) who wants a huge randsom for keeping the elevator with the brakes on.<br />After breaking his plan and saving the day the villian set a bomb on a LA Metrpolitan bus full of citizens which will explode after passing 50 mph and it can be lowered or else will explode also.<br />Jack gets in there and after a struggle where the bus driver is being hit Annie(Bullock) takes the wheel and starts taking the bus outside the area after jumping an high and impossible jump of 50 meters on a broke road bridge they get to Lax where they cheated the villain and saved all the hostages but after a unsuccesful trip to the villians home he wants to be paid but he escapes to the subway with one hostage.<br />It's the best action movie. Buy the Five-Star-Collection.
0316666343|5.0|It took me a while to get into the story, but once I did I couldn't put it down.  The ending was breathtaking and I couldn't get the story out of my mind.  To believe in something so much that it can come true was incredible.
B000067G3C|5.0|Starring Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock, Dennis Hopper and Jeff Daniels, Speed is one of those rare films that comes along every now and than that proves to be better than standard fare. Essentially one big extended action scene, the film's frenetic plot holes. The action never lets up, creating suspense- filled set-pieces and audience excitement. The premise of a bomb on a bus that wil explode if the speed goes below 50 makes for one far-fetched but fun thrill ridr.
B000069AUI|5.0|If you liked their last album, you'll love this one.  Don't be fooled, if you are into heavy or extremely upbeat music, Cold Play is not for you.  If you haven't heard them yet, you are missing out.
B000067G3C|5.0|What a gripping ride this movie was. A movie that made me want to watch more. I was very impressed with Jan De Bint's directional debut and he deserves more. He needs to stop making 'sell out' movies like Twister, The Haunting and the horrible Sequel to this excellent movie.
B00005B36H|4.0|I feel that this album is nothing but a stepping stone for the one Tool will release after it. Lateralus destroys whatever labels had been slapped on the band since Aenima and sees them begin to tread new, even weird territory.  I agree that Third Eye (the closing track on Aenima) may have been a bit of an insight to this album.   You hear the mysterious sounds of Reflection and you can't help but slip away into the back of your mind.   The whale-like sounds of Mantra, the inspiring lyrics of Lateralus, all these pieces come together to form quite a unique musical experience.<br /> Forget about the songs for moment and try to truly understand the meaning of this album: tool who've always emphasized the importance of growth physically and mentally invite us to to truly meet them on the other side. I have owned this album since the day it came, a little over a year ago, and have never truly appreciated it's beauty until now. I had been reading many essays on Zen, and suddenly this whole album came together for me. Tool's messages are deep. Whether they put much emphasis on being feeling connected to mother earth or preaching the destruction of the ego, Tool have grown from their cynical lyrics of past albums. The music is capable of &quot;taking you away&quot; to a place where you can reflect on your present state and really look into yourself. <br />Despite the deep meaning of the album as a whole, I feel Tool are only scraping the surface. When the next one comes out, we as fans will have grown and will be more ready and willing to ride the bold new rollercoaster that Tool have just built.  Tool needed to tread new ground, and though this may not be as far away from previous outings as some reviewers have mentioned, it give Tool the room they need to explore even further.
B000067G3C|5.0|Speed one of my favourite action movie beside Die Hard series. Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock really shine in this movie. From lift to bus to train, all scenes are exciting! Not to be miss if you like action movies. Highly recommended!
B00005B58Y|5.0|This was Miles' second album for Columbia. But because it came in right after his heralded first Columbia album, \\"Round Midnight,\\" and just before the immortal \\"Kind of Blue,\\" it tends to be overlooked in the Miles' canon. Make no mistake about it, the album contains some of the most fiery yet organized music of Miles on record. Cannonball, after all, was not on the 1st Columbia album, and \\"Kind of Blue,\\" as magical as it is, often acquires a kind of meandering, moody quality due to its quiet, introspective nature.<br />\\"Milestones\\" also represents a kind of \\"second chance\\" for the members of Miles' sextet. Due to the personal and alcohol/drug-related problems of his sidemen, Miles simply decided to disband the group for most of 1957. When he had a change of heart and resurrected the sextet for this late 1957 recording, the other five members sensed they had to prove themselves to two audiences: the public and Miles himself.<br />Cannonball not only brings his characteristic fire to each of the selections, but stands up more effectively to Coltrane's advanced harmonies on this date than on the \\"Kind of Blue\\" session, in my opinion. The trio number with Red Garland is representative of some of Red's best trio work on the Prestige label but without the Rudy Van Gelder sound (which tends to make all pianists' touches sound the same). Moreover, I can vouch from memory and personal experience that the title tune, \\"Milestones,\\" had a far greater influence on musicians' moving to modal and \\"free\\" harmonies than anything on \\"Kind of Blue\\" (perhaps because the latter album's singular beauty is beyond replication). Finally, the alternate takes appear to be first takes because Miles, if anything, sounds fresher and more inventive on these than on the master tracks. Like Sinatra, Miles had little patience with, or reason for, a second take.

0767830555|5.0|Normally, I would never take the time out to write an online review of any film, no matter how good I thought it.  However, this film is so good that it is an exception.  I list it as &quot;the other side of the American Lifestyle&quot; because Travis Bickle represents every single American who has ever felt alienated from society.  Travis sees the world very realistically...to realistically perhaps.  It's difficult to explain without watching the film, but I feel that every one of us can identify with Travis Bickle.<br />Robert DeNiro gives probably the finest performance of his career.  I don't know if there is another actor who could have given a more frighteningly realistic performance than DeNiro.  Maybe it's because Bobby D, like the rest of us, could truely identify Travis' lonely view on the outside of the world, watching other people live out their lives unhappily without knowing what they truely want.<br />On the back of the box it says &quot;One of 100 best films of all time&quot;.  This statement couldn't be more true.  Even the shallow minded academy was able to recognize this and nominated it for Best Picture.  If you have any appreciation for fine films, and have the stomach and mind to witness a very realistic take on life, do not hesitate to purchase this film!  You will be interested to say the least!
B000067G3C|5.0|There's not much I can say about it. I'm sure that literally EVERY single person in the USA has seen it in one form or the other, and that everyone liked it.
B00005JL3A|5.0|When one critiques a movie they should stick to the movie and not stereotype people that would watcch it and then also call it trash on top of that. Also people who are \\"hardcore\\" Resident Evil fans should grow up and stop complaining that the movie was nothing like the book OR the video game. What kind of movie is that? It would be entertaining but just a rehatch and nothing more. Opinions are fine but one should not have to sit through others bashing on someone elses work. Paul Anderson is great admirer of the series and he knew how to translate the video game with flare.<br />This movie however, created something new that did not steal from the video game and still kept the edge which fuels such a movie or video game. \\"the only thing I found upsetting was that too many people died too quickly in the \\"Cube\\" scene. Oh well. And for everyone who thinks the movie didn't fallow the video game the next movie sticks itself a little more to the setting we are all used to.<br />I recommend this movie to anyone: fans of the game, horror, or zombie flicks. After this movie is not suppose to be the next big take on Zombie movies.
B000067G3C|5.0|I loved this movie, Sandra Bullock is great in it, and now I want to see all of her movies. I would recommend this movie to anyone. If you like romances, there is a little one betweenSandra and Keanu, and there's plenty of action.
0767804724|5.0|From beginning to end, Air Force One is a relentlessly gripping thrill ride, cumulating suspense with one superbly taut sequence after another. You can chalk this one up as another success for superstar Harrison Ford and director Wolfgang Peterson, who's consistently been one of the better action filmmakers around.<br />Ford stars as James Marshall, the president of the United States. He and his cabinet have just recently made the crucial decision to go after a renegade general named Radek, who threatens to bring back a state of communism to Russia. The mission to capture him is a success, but not long after Marshall and his family board Air Force One on a flight back to the U.S., Russian terrorists posing as newsreporters take over the flight, complete with machine guns and heavy weaponry. Their demands: to have Radek released or else a hostage (50 total) will be executed every half-hour. You can guess where things go from there, as Marshall remains hidden in the cargo area, ready to take back the plane and save his family.<br />Despite an occasionally ridiculous story and quite a few implausibilities, Air Force One never fails to work as a nail-biting actioner. The suspense is palpable, thanks to likeable characters and hissable villains.  There's also the sense of iminent danger and gutsy unpredictability that director Peterson infuses the film with. Hostages are killed every half-hour, and perhaps even those you expect to live through the situation are killed off pretty quickly; the terrorists are not the slightest bit unflinching or unwavering, making for effective villains.<br />I've heard a lot of complaints about the seemingly never-ending conclusion, but for me, it just made the film that much more an unpredictable roller coaster ride, with one edge-of-the-seat situation after another. The action sequences are the \\"requisite\\" shootouts and fistfights, but are truly exciting, and the fact that this is all set on board the world's most famous aircraft adds frantic urgency to the proceedings. There are also a lot of fantastic stunts, the most thrilling one featuring Ford dangling in mid-air, being reeled inside an aircraft with a cable and strap. <br />Harrison Ford has one of the most commanding presences of any Hollywood actor, and Air Force One is almost entirely his show. Yeah, James Marshall may be too damn perfect for a politician, but this is a red-blooded action flick, and I want a hero that I can unabashedly cheer for from beginning to end, and Marshall is just that kind of guy. Gary Oldman's the villian, and in true Oldman style, you can expect lots of hollering in a somewhat unintelligible accent (which honestly doesn't sound particularly Russian, as it's meant to). <br />Jerry Goldsmith's score is excellent, giving the film an additional intensity, and even revving up excitement during the quieter moments. The main theme is a bit overly patriotic, but undeniably rousing.  Hard to say, but this is probably the famed composer's best score since Rudy. <br />Aside from the logical flaws in the story, the only time the film really stumbles is in the visual effects category. Don't get me wrong, most of the CGI is superb, but there's at least one scene near the end that features probably the most hilariously unconvincing (and disappointing) CGI-rendered shot I've ever seen in a big-studio production. <br />Air Force One may be a little silly and implausible, but it's irony-absent presentation is refreshing in a time when just about every other film out there is trying to be as annoyingly sarcastic as possible. In this era of Die-Hard rip-offs, Air Force One is easily one of the best, and for my money, it's more entertaining than the original Die Hard itself.<BR>**** 1/2 out of *****
B000067G3C|5.0|A lot of action movies are all about explosions, profanity, violence, blood and guts. Speed has some of that, but it is also a well-crafted film, with elements of DIE HARD, Spielberg's DUEL, and the 1974 classic THE TAKING OF PELHAM ONE-TWO-THREE to liven things up. It is a sure-fire winner.
B000058983|5.0|I saw Arthur Lee & Love live in June 2002 and can honestly say that it was the best show that I have ever seen in my life.    They played 85% of Forever Changes and, during 'Live and Let Live', Arthur was kind enough to mimic shooting me off the Theatre balcony as he sang the line about 'bluebird sitting on my fence, I think I'll get my pistol'.  Thanks Arthur - made my night!  Despite all of his past troubles, Arthur looked fit and healthy and moved like an Olympian.    Unquestionably, 'Forever Changes' is the greatest piece of work since the invention of vinyl.  This is a collection of songs about life/death, pain, sadness, depression, fun, redemption, fear/loathing, lots more pain and everything.  Those who argue the case for 'Pet Sounds' or 'Sgt Peppers' are fools (does anyone really come home after work and listen to those two snorefests?).  One might as well argue that chess is a greater game than (real) football.     The real reason that Love never went mega is simple - they never made a 3 minute, radio-friendly single (aside from Little Red Book).    The 2 standouts here are the Bryan McClean song 'ALone Again' and the final tune 'You Set the Scene' - perhaps Arthur's masterpiece. It is impossible to describe the ending of this song - it just needs to be heard!    If anyone wants to check out Love live - they have a great new lead guitarist out of L.A. called Mike Randle and they are touring USA and Europe relentlessly - do a search on google; there are many sites...

0060931736|4.0|Miss Jean Brodie seems like a teacher sent from heaven: She's witty,well traveled,and clearly interested in her young female students,so much that she chooses several to become part of her\\"set\\" which is considered a great honor-but is it? The book slowly lets you see Miss Brodie's manipulative side as she tries to eeriely control her \\"girls\\" lives and forever changes them as a result. A bit episodic at times and the play(as well as movie) had a more powerful ending. Still,it's an interesting charactor study which will make you think well after you've finished it.

B00005JL3A|1.0|Yeah this movie is terrible. This film relies completely on those slit second scare tactics. Where it's really quite one second and then there's a loud noise which usually turns out to be nothing. When there is something, such as a zombie, it's not scary. The zombies are very boring. They stumble slowly to their victims. They're so frail you'd think they could just be pushed over. Which is how it is in the 'Resident Evil' video game. Which is why this game never should have been made into a film. I do like the games but the plot just isn't strong enough for the big screen. If they want to make a scary game into a movie they should have chosen 'Silent Hill.' It's not so corny. Not all video game movies are completely stupid. 'Tomb Raider' managed to faithfully bring Lara Croft to the big screen and actually improve her image. Sorry Capcom, 'Street Fighter' failed and so did 'Resident Evil.'
B0000630BT|5.0|After scraping the bottom with the mostly dreck contained on \\"Turbo\\" and \\"Ram it Down\\" ...Priest got it together, only to have Rob depart the group.  Scott Travis' double bass assault revitalizes the Priest, and this CD contains some of their heaviest songs EVER!  If your head isn't doing some serious banging after hearing \\"Painkiller\\" and \\"All Guns Blazing,\\" check your vitals.  \\"A Touch of Evil\\" is a great midtempo song that is a classic, since they had ditched the guitar synths by this time (guitar synths and electronic drums were the two biggest music killers in the 80's).  Along with \\"Screaming\\" and \\"British Steel,\\" this is one of those most-own Priest albums that will delight you for eternity.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|I am really tired of people putting this movie down. When I read the negative reviews it's obvious to me most of these people have never even seen the movie because they have no clue as to what they are talking about. First of all, this is the only movie that is completely faithful to the video game. No, Lara isn't running through tombs throughout the entire thing flipping switches but that would be boring. Lara does go in a tomb though and solves puzzles which is what the game is about. The game is also about this strong, independent woman out to save the world. Which is what this movie faithfully brings to the screen. So what if Lara isn't wearing a green shirt and brown shorts??? She's wearing all black in the new Tomb Raider game. Give me a break! And Angelina Jolie is the perfect Lara Croft. Even the game's real life models don't look as much like Lara as Angelina does. And her acting in this movie is wonderful. She brings to the film a sense of power and control that not even the game has. When you see Angelina playing Lara you know she is always in complete control of the situation. The storyline is great. It takes Lara all over the world in great locations and the whole thing is about solving one big puzzle which is what the game is about. What more do you want people??? Tomb Raider is the perfect video game movie!
B00001OH7P|5.0|This is the album that has changed my life and I guess the lives of many others. Pure rock 'n roll by an ARTIST !
B00000J2PH|4.0|One of the greatest transformations in American Pop history is documented on TAPESTRY; after nearly a decade as a dowdy behind-the-scenes tunesmith working in near-anonimity in the Brill Building, this album (and the great cover photo) turned Carole King into an iconic Greenwich Village mother earth singer songwriter.<br />And she hits the ball out of the park on both counts: her voice is like the girl next door, if the girl next door could drop her inhibitions and had perfect pitch; the tunes are exquisite, elegant; the combination is soulful, American, and classic.<br />You've heard all the hits, and they were worthy of the charts, but don't miss her remake of the hit she wrote years earlier, &quot;Will You Love Me Tomorrow?&quot;  It's a low-key way for King to point out how mature the lyrics to the early 60's Pop tune had been--it was easy to miss in the teenbeat, uptempo version that had hit the charts--and it is the true masterpiece of this great CD.
B00006IUL7|5.0|This film has Oscar written all over it.  Al Pacino and Robin Wiliams have set new standards in the industry.  The film is flawless.  It scares you...it challenges you...it places you in another world (Alaska)...and it is \\"one of a kind\\".  If you like crime drama, compelling visual experiences, quality sound, and a complete two-hour roller coaster ride, this one's for you.  Pacino and Williams are brilliant.  There's nothing else to write.  I will own this DVD when it is released.
B00005YXZH|5.0|This is a record everyone should own; it is fun and melodic, inventive, creative, and gives you that good audio buzz you got the first time you heard the Beatles, the Replacements, U2, or XTC.<br />Not that Wilco sounds like any of those bands--well, OK, maybe more than a tad like the 'Mats--but the same kind of Pop genius is at work here. Tweedy may lean C&amp;W, but he understands Pop.  There are touches of both BLONDE ON BLONDE and DESIRE-era Dylan, the Dead, the Byrds and the Band too.  It's an amazing amalgom of styles boiled down into something original and new, purely Wilco.<br />I'd paid little attention to Wilco prior to YANKEE HOTEL FOXTROT because of what I still see as an overriding pretention in most Alt-Country.  Tweedy sets all that aside here with a dose of close to the bone lyrics, McCartneyesque melodies, breathy vocals, and off-kilter instrumentation that I find absolutely absorbing.<br />This is a classic LP that most people will never hear because--here comes my constant complaint--American radio programmers are deaf to all but boy-bands, repititious rap, and hat-band country dullerdry.<br />Buy this record and remind yourself how great Pop can be.
B00003CXUM|5.0|Most movies nowadays vie for spectacular love affairs, consummated after lots of explosions (Boy meets girl, boy blows a lot of buildings up, boy loses girl, boy crashes fifteen classic muscle cars during a fiery chase, boy gets girl back.) Moviemakers search for new ways to jade and shock us.<br />This film is different.<br />Yes, it is about UNREQUITED love. It is an eye-blindingly beautiful study of the thing we do when we truly love somebody- which is to say, what is best for our beloved, not for ourselves. The last fifteen seconds of the movie literally broke my heart. If Casablanca had been set in Shanghai and given a good dose of reality, it would have been very close to this movie. There are not many films that make me cry, but this was one of them. Not only would I buy this, but I'd make my significant other watch it with me.
B000069AUI|2.0|All Coldplay is a rip-off of Radiohead and Wilco. They're very good at ripping off Radiohead, the first time I heard of a few of their songs, I thought it was Radiohead. They're not very good at ripping off Wilco yet, though. <BR>  That being said, a great band like Modest Mouse started off as just a rip-off of the Pixies and Pink Floyd. Once Coldplay learns to create their own sound using their influences like Modest Mouse did, I bet they'll be one of the best bands around. But for now do yourself a favor and go buy Radiohead's Amnesiac, Pablo Honey, or the Bends; or Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot or Summer Teeth, instead. Your money will be much better spent.  <BR>   The biggest plus though is \\"Yellow\\" isn't on this Cd. Which was quite possibly the most annoying song ever.
B00005K9LK|3.0|Screaming for Vengeance was Priest's commercial breakthrough and by all means a decent album... but compared to future and past masterpieces it just does not hold up. Not to say that Electric Eye, the title track, Another Thing Coming and Riding on the Wind are not timeless. Those songs are definite highlights and Priest standards. But the hard rock oriented filler in between kills the experience for me.<br />Instead of the speed metal of Stained Class or Sad Wings, JP take the commercial approach of British Steel and pump it up a notch. Fever, Bloodstone and Pain and Pleasure are simply put, sub par songs. Especially when placed beside something as monumental as Hellion/Electric Eye. When I put this (sound track) in, it's usually out before the 20 minute marker hits. <br />Screaming For Vengeance deserves some recognition for being the record that broke Priest, but it's hardly their best record, and often is perpetuated by the media as just that. For those of you who have not done so get Sad Wings of Destiny immediately. Until then, SFV is good, radio friendly heavy metal that makes killer driving music.
B000069AUI|5.0|im not a fan of coldplay, but this album is amazing. its very addictive and epic.<br />coldplay are probibly one of the few good popular bands out there, and this band goes past pop music into epic sounds.<br />im not a fan of pop music but this is sheer brilliance. ... all i did was listen to this cd when i was driving the week it came out..it was all i could listen too.<br />but i had to stop myself.<br />this cd is very addictive and good and dont feel bad for liking it.
B000007489|4.0|ST's career has been an oddity. They began life as an incredible hardcore punk band (as witnessed on this disc) then dabbled in crossover, followed by full on thrash metal. After that they released Art of Rebellion and totally changed their sound once again. Now they're back doing the punk thing. Who knows what will be next ?<br />Either way, Suicidal's first album is one of, if not, their finest. Maniacal hardcore punk that is utterly honest about their hatred for reaganomics, other people, and themselves. Top it off with a sense of humour that eluded other founders of hardcore and excellent musicianship (ROCKY GEORGE), and you got one of the coolest punk discs put to print.<br />Institutionalized, I Shot the Devil, I Saw Your Mommy.. these are what we call classics, and all poor attempts at cashing in on a remake aside.. Suicidal Tendencies are are one of the better bands of the last 20 years.

The only question I have about this is why did they release a greatest hits when they knew their would be more hits to come.
B00003CXXS|5.0|Jurassic Park, it is one of the greatest sci-fi/thriller ever.  This one isn't the best of the three(it's probably the second best in my opinion.

The story isn't as complex as the others.  i would reccomend this.

B000006TRV|4.0|\\"The Wall\\" is the best and most cohesive rock concept album so far. It has some classic radio songs like \\"Another Brick In The Wall\\", some great straightahead songs like \\"Mother\\", and then several songs which tell the story more than stand up on their own. Like the other Pink Floyd albums, this has well-recorded songs, memorable solos and Dave Gilmour does most of the singing.
B00004RIUV|5.0|Superb, odd mixture of country and progressive rock, this is perhaps Gene clark's finest hour. &quot;No Other&quot; has an almost hard-rock feel, with its hard-edge chords.  &quot;Silver Raven&quot; is just about Clark's most beautiful, haunting ballad.  &quot;Strength Of Strings&quot; is almost undescribable.  A near-perfect album, well produced and and performed.
B000024D4R|3.0|This Pink Floyd disc is bookended by short acoustic songs, and then the main songs are long \\"Animal Farm\\"-type meditations. The songs are good, but they don't stand up as well over time as the other PF discs, like \\"Dark Side\\", or \\"The Wall\\". The sound is sort of pre-discoey because of the 4 on the floor beat and Roger Water's white funk bass lines. There's animal sounds effects in most of the songs, and David Gilmour's singing was recorded coldly, like through a ... microphone. It all fits the cold theme of the album, though.

0380002930|5.0|What an imaginitive mind Richard Adams posesses!  I first saw the film of this as a child and while viewing it I remember being surprised that my mother let me watch it, considering I was a HUGE animal lover and for an animated film about wild rabbits there was a good amount of gore and she wouldnt let me see Bambi or Dumbo because she knew how upset I would be over it.  But years later when I was in my teens and I read the book \\"watership down\\"  I realize she let me see it because it was true to nature, with a fictional aspect.  The animated film was so memorable to me.  The book is even more memorible.  This is one of those books that you have on a book shelf and you read it again and again over the years because it is so well written.  In the years to follow after seeing the film I have had numerous rabbits and they have all been named after the characters from Watership down.  Basically this story is what Mr. Adams would percieve the life of a wild rabbit, threated by other animals, commercial building, traffic etc.  bringing life and realism to the hares.  It is a wonderful read.
0871137380|5.0|I write this review for those who don't know much about the military. Black Hawk Down by Mark Bowden was an amazing read on so many levels. I say this even though I don't have much knowledge of military culture or it's jargon. The way Bowden reveals the events surrounding Oct 3, 1993 will capture your attention from the very beginning. He will tell you about the men (I mean, MEN) that couragously battled in Somalia, one by one. You will be so proud of the quality and caliber of MEN they call Rangers and D-boys. The book is also, for obvious reasons, action-packed and reads very fast. I am so greatful for this book but even more for every one of the MEN in the book.
B00005Q3KC|5.0|I personally think that every songs of the Corrs are the best, but hey, it's just me. I have all of their albums and I think this album is a great collection of all &quot;the best&quot;. I know that The Corrs has only been releasing 3 albums previously, but they have enough materials to put into one THE BEST CD. One disappointment is they only put one instrumental song &quot;Lough Erin Shore&quot; in this CD. They should've put more, such as &quot;Toss the Feather&quot;. All in all, this one is a should buy CD if you're a fan of The Corrs
B000005QH3|4.0|The 1972 existential road movie \\"Vanishing Point\\" succeeds on so many levels, that it is difficult to pinpoint any one reason for its enduring popularity. This rousing, if not groovy, car-chase flick has so much going for it, most notably the era in which it was produced (early 1970s, Woodstock generation).<br />....<br />\\"Vanishing Point's\\" main protagonist, a speed-popping anti-hero known as Kowalski - nicely played by Barry Newman - is an unshaven, darker version of the Steve McQueen persona perfected in the film \\"Bullit.\\" In fact, \\"Vanishing Point\\" is just a full-length movie version of that film's now-famous car chase scene. But the filmmakers (director Richard C. Sarafian, writer Guillermo Cain) got lucky. They located the car chase along the stretches of America's breathtaking western landscape. They chose a car, a growling white Challenger, that had extraordinary esthetic muscle. And they gave Kowalski an energetic, anti-establishment sidekick in radio DJ Super Soul, superbly played by the late Cleavon Little.<br />And the dream-like imagery, including a nude woman upon a motorcycle, a hippie commune performing an impromptu concert in the Nevada desert, and of course, Kowalski driving aimlessly across the desert as if lost in his own hallucination, all contribute to a film that plays like one long MTV video a full decade before that medium was created. Certainly the contemporary psychedelic/folk music (including Mountain and Kim Carnes) contributes to the overall counterculture allure of \\"Vanishing Point.\\"<br />Like an odd puzzle where the pieces never entirely fall into place (another part of the attraction to this film is it can be interpreted a number of ways), \\"Vanishing Point\\" tells the story of one Kowalski, an aimless driver who delivers cars for a living. On a bet, he decides to deliver a Challenger from Denver to San Francisco within 15 hours. He's eventually chased by policemen from three different states as they attempt to put a halt to his speedodyssey. DJ Super Soul picks up on the story on the scanner, and begins to give Kowalski secret tips on the air to elude police roadblocks. It all leads to an explosive conclusion on the California border which will stay with the viewer long after the film's final credits.<br />\\"Vanishing Point\\" moves at such a breakneck pace, one can forgive the film for its many faults. These would include the multiple out-of-place flashbacks, detailing Kowalski's troubled life; the comedic portrayal of policemen as bumbling keystone cops; and several heavy-handed scenes of symbolism portraying Kowalski as a Messiah-like figure.<br />But the filmmakers captured this counterculture era almost perfectly, and the image of Kowalski speeding across the plains of Colorado and Nevada, staring off into the sun-baked western landscape of nowhere through the dusty windshield of a roaring Challenger, is about as cool an American symbol of rebellion as one will ever see on film. And that is why \\"Vanishing Point\\" is such a terrific film. After 30 years, this groovy drive-in flick which came out of nowhere to become a cult classic, is still \\"cool.\\"
B000069AUI|5.0|Living in Indonesia DOES have its advantages *smile* When it comes to Music, we are more updated than the Americans. Indonesians are open to those new musicians from Europe, even before they make a videoclip to be shown on MTV. And that includes Coldplay. I LOVE their first album and excitingly wait for their second. When I first heard &quot;In My Place&quot; on the radio, I know that the newest album won't disappoint.<br />I was right. This album is far by one of the best albums I bought this year. Coldplay still offers the emotional gripping songs. My favorites ... like I can choose, anyway ... are probably The Scientist, Amsterdam, and In My Place.<br />If you're a fan of Brit music, you surely don't want to miss this one.<br />(now I will wait for Lifehouse's Stanley Climbfall, since I LOVE the newest single &quot;Spin&quot;)
B000068OSK|5.0|Wow is all I can say. They are my new favorite band. Jack's voice is irregular but fantastic in it's own way. His guitar skills are fab and Meg's drumming is great. Overall a great up and coming band.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Ever since I can remember, I have had a thing about film scores. I love them! I've laughed, danced and cried to some of the best scores ever written. But, when this one passed through my hands, I soon realised this was something special.<BR>In my opinion, Howard Shore's score for 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' is, quite simply, the best soundtrack ever written. It is true genius, a musical masterpiece. If you ever wondered what made you cry in the movie, here is the answer. It is a truly emotional, heart wrenching score. The highlights are tracks 17 and 18 - 'The Breaking of the Fellowhip' and 'May It Be, performed by Enya'. They are just truly beautiful!<BR>If you loved the movie, and now have the video or DVD, this is the ultimate companion. And, if you're planning on reading the book, it's perfect to listen to at the same time. Howard Shore deserved that Oscar. He has gone above and beyond the call of duty. And the great thing is, its the first of three...
6305531374|4.0|When I heard things about this film, I was thinking of water because of \\"H20\\" or a title of a Hall & Oates album.   I just thought a Halloween 7 would be just as lame as the previous four sequels.  Not knowing what to expect, I was DEAD wrong.<br />This film marks the landmark return of Jamie Lee Curtis (who hates horror movies), then newcomer Josh Hartnett, Michelle Williams (Dawsons Creek), Nancy Stephens (who was in Halloween 1 & 2), hip-hopper LL Cool J and a special appearance by Janet Leigh - Jamie Lee's, the scream queen's mother !!!<br />This film originally was to be written and directed by John Carpenter who declined due to other film commitments is written by Kevin Williamson (Scream) and directed by Steve Miner who what ?? directed Friday the 13th Part 2 & 3 !!  The film score is by a newcomer John Ottman with influental original music by John Carpenter.<br />This film, which totally disregards Halloween 3, 4, 5 & 6, which I thought was a smart move by the writer takes place 20 years after Halloween 1 & 2.   Our masked friend Mikey Myers stops off at Nurse Marion Chambers (Nancy Stephens) house then tracks down his sister Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) - a woman named Keri Tate who now has a 17 year old son, John (Josh Hartnett) and is the Head Dean of a private school in Northern California.   She has been in hiding and on the run from her killer brother for the past twenty years.  Laurie Strode is a force to be reckoned in this film.   My favourite moments are (1) when Norma (Janet Leigh) drives away in her car, which happens to be the same car she driven in the classic Psycho (bonus) and the very end and I think most know what I am talking about.<br />I thought this film did justice for the series because it disregarded all the crappy past sequels, it concentrated on Jamie Lee and Micheal and that Micheal gets it with one clean shot ... which leave it to another bunch of writers would lead to HALLOWEEN RESURRECTION, which I will review when the DVDis released.<br />This film is presented in widescreen (2.35:1) version with Digital 5.1 Surround which is fine for the film.   There was a misprint of \\"Special Feautures\\" as no commentary was included.  A Trivia Game was included and a Creed music video and I think that is about it.<br />I highly recommend this film to all who are Halloween fans, accompanied with Halloween 1 & 2, which I do have in my DVD  collection.<br />Get our copy today !!!
B00006G8G1|2.0|I bought Rock in Rio because I like Iron Maiden and I really enjoy good concert DVDs.  The concert is strong, the audio excellent, the video quality is outstanding.  So why only 2 stars?  The editing is horrific!!!  The footage is cutting to another shot every second.  At some times, it's cutting 3-4 times PER SECOND.  I found the DVD to be unwatchable, which really made me angry since it was a good concert with good audio and video quality that was ruined.  It turns out that Steve Harris edited this DVD -  Steve, stick to what you do well.  If you are a hard, hard core Iron Maiden fan, go ahead and buy the DVD - you will probably enjoy it.  However, if you hate videos where they are always doing the fast cut to another shot, skip this one.
B000069HKH|5.0|Amidst the chaos and sadness that has permeated our country since September 11, 2001, it is good to finally have a songsmith put into words what so many of us have been feeling. How do you express rage, patriotism, anger, loss, and hope all at the same time? If you listen to Bruce and the E-Street Band you realize that you are not alone in this. Bruce has had the ability to put into song the feelings of everyday people without sounding like a cliche' or trivializing what we are feeling or experiencing. We have grown up in the age of Bruce and we know that he will come through for us, showing us that our flaws and faith, as well as our tragedies and triumphs all have meaning. If you buy one album this year, get this one and listen. Over and over again.
1400031346|4.0|I bought this book on a whim, having gone into the bookstore with the intention of buying a completely different book.  I put that book back and bought No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency instead.  I'm not a detective or mystery fan at all. I visited Kenya a few years ago and I hoped this book would bring memories of Africa back.  <BR>I can't even say how much I enjoyed this book.  Particularly the opening chapters are very good.  It's very simple, powerful, very funny too.  It gives a view of Southern Africa that only someone who has lived there all his life can give.<BR>My only criticism is a kind of inexperience or clumsiness by McCall Smith towards the end of the book.  Foreshadowing which doesn't really deliver. The ending might be a little pat. But there is so much so good about this book that I plan to get the other two in the series and can't wait for the new one next spring!
B000002AGN|5.0|From reading through several Amazon lists praising this recording, I had to give David Brubeck's Time Out one a few listens. It is truly a feast for the ears loaded with many symphonic embellishments.  All seven tracks are special in their own way.  Its hard to choose a favorite.<br />This record has so many spunky rhythms and captivating melodies that the overall effect is soothing to my soul.  Its truly a pleasure to listen to each instrumentalist. What make these guys so spectacular is that its all technique and style without resorting to excessive volume.<br />Anyway, I am very impressed with this recording and would highly recommend it especially for those those new to the many styles of jazz.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I recently bought this album and can honestly say that it could be the best twenty dollars I've ever spent. It is constantly in my cd player on repeat. If you're looking for an alternative to today's poppy music, this is the perfect cd for you.
0060005424|5.0|Lirael is definitely my favorite book.  It is the story of a Clayr named Lirael who, unlike her thousands of cousins and aunts, does not have the Sight (ability to see \\"one of the many possible futures\\").  In the beginning of the book she contemplates suicide, but somehow ends up in the Library of the Clayr.  Eventually, with the help of the Disreputable Dog and the other Clayr, she manages to leave the Clayr Glacier and go out into the Old Kingdom.  Then she meets Prince Sameth, and together they discover many things about themselves and the world.<BR>I highly recommend this book, along with Sabriel and Abhorsen.  Abhorsen is not out yet, but, trust me, it will be as good or better than Lirael.
B00005JKDR|4.0|First thing, i don't know why an American movie is released on DVD september 17 when in Spain (Europe), it has been released september 4....But that's ok....My son just loves computer animated movies. It took him a couple of times to start liking the movie. It's pretty neat  (for computer-made movies i still prefer Shrek and Toy Story 2), entertaining. I am glad i was able to buy it here in Spain where we can listen to a &quot;proper&quot; castillian language (my sons are learning Spanish), but that's not the purpose of this note. I like the movie. Not as much as others, but i DON'T REGRET spending my money in this case. I would've liked a little more &quot;action&quot;. Still waiting for a &quot;computer-movie&quot; with the same action featured in the begining of Toy Story 2...
B00000F566|5.0|i am from this genration which makes me different because i like movies from the 80s.  well this is a must see.
B00005JKCF|4.0|Based on the comic book hero, Spider-Man is a superhero blockbuster. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a goofy, dweebish, brainiac student who gains superhuman strength and the spider-like ability to cling to any surface and throw webs after being bitten by a genetically-altered spider on a school fieldtrip. Peter's exploration and experimentation with his new powers is hilarious. But after witnessing a crime and becoming a victim himself, he vows to use his abilities to fight crime, finally understanding the words of his beloved Uncle Ben, \\"With great power comes great responsibility.\\" The greatest test comes in the form of the Green Goblin, who is the deadly alter ego of businessman/scientist Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe). Meanwhile, Peter also battles his love for the beautiful girl-next-door (literally), Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), who finds herself falling for Spider-man after he saves her life.<br />An excellent storyline, perfect casting, and certainly packed with action makes Spider-Man a hit. Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst both convincingly portrayed their characters. The villain, however, was cast the best with Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn/The Green Goblin. Peter's best friend, Harry Osborn, is played by James Franco (TNT's James Dean and City By The Sea). Even in a smaller supporting role, Franco still has that on-screen, James Dean intensity and you can't look away. The swinging-action scenes and special effects are really great. They play like a great video game, but, guess what . . . you're in it! Even the film's intro. is visually intense and mesmerizing. I made ever effort to see this on the big-screen because I knew it would be worth it. Boy, was I right! PS-check out the movie soundtrack. It's really great.
1551111225|5.0|This story STILL haunts me since first reading it in college, 20 years ago. It is about a man so destitute and desperate he sells his wife and baby daughter.  Unburdeoned, his pockets full, he goes off to seek his fame and fortune.  Though he becomes the wealthy and much-respected Mayor of Casterbridge, he is unable to escape the horror of what he has done. Everything he has built threatens to unravel when his dying wife shows up, almost-grown daughter in tow, seeking a guardian for her child. So well written, so cativating, it is like the making of a braid, every page woven together neatly, to a grand and shocking finale. This book turned me into a Hardy fan.
B00004Y6RO|5.0|After being blown away by the incredibly heavy \\"Iowa\\", I wanted to go to Slipknot's debut. I heard that it was better and faster. So, I picked this up. I poped it into my CD player, and listened to \\"(sic)\\". \\"Gee,\\" I thought. The vocals sounded kinda sloppy, and the guitars didn't seem as heavy as Iowa. Then I listened to \\"Eyeless\\" and kept listening to it for the next few weeks. It was amazing! Not only did it have explosive guitars, but it had the catchiest chorus I have ever heard! \\"You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes,\\" LOL. I heard that some crazy old man that was near their homes kept shouting that, so they decided to use those as lyrics...but back to the CD. I eventually listened to the whole thing (i got the digipak later) and I proclaimed it as one of my favorite CD's. The riffs (i'll get to that in a second) sounded really loud and heavy, the drummer was beyond above-average (up to standards with at least Lars Ulrich), and Corey Taylor is (still) among my favorite vocalists (Kud from Mudvayne, Maynard James Keenan, Morgan Lander, Aaron Lewis, James Hetfield etc.). He can be extremely aggressive in screaming, and be melodic (though not nearly as much as he should be). I had a hard time deciding which one of their CD's was better. I got the Digipak and liked them even more. The expletive ridden \\"Get This\\", was sooo fast! I thought it was up to standards with Slayer's speed. And the secret track \\"Eeyore\\" was a complete masterpiece. Amazing speed! Both tracks were assaults on the eardrums. It seemed perfect... <br />However, after being exposed to other heavy/nu-metal groups (older Metallica, Pantera, Mudvayne, Napalm Death, Sepultura, Soulfly, White Zombie, Kittie, etc.), I began to notice that this was not nearly as heavy as most of the bands I listened to. The guitarists didn't sound as good as they did before. I can see why The Wickerman said that this is not metal. You see, their problem is that they need to use a loud vocalist to scream at such a loud tone over sub-par guitar riffs that it makes the music sound very heavy. That is what decieved me. Compare the riffs to Mudvayne, well, I'll just leave it at that... Iowa was a big step forward. They ditched most of the rap influence that you found on \\"Spit It Out\\", \\"No Life\\", and \\"Only One\\"(Now that's not really a good thing. I enjoy some rap music (not the horrible commercial stuff from MTV), and I found the tracks above all really enjoyable.), you rarely hear the DJ, much more heavyness, just simply better. The other thing is that they took off two tracks (\\"Frail Limb Nursery\\" and \\"Purity\\"). I'm not sure, But I think it was taken off for some legal reasons. I really want to hear them. I'll eventually find the copy with these two songs, but \\"Me Inside\\" is good enough for me.<br />I think i'm sounding too negitive for 5 stars, so i'll go onto the positive. THe thing that is so good about this album is that it is fast, good sounding, and addictive. All the tracks are good. \\"Prosthetics\\" has the most unsettlingly intense middle half I have ever heard. \\"Me Inside\\" has Korn influence and an incredibly sung chorus. \\"No Life\\" is really fast in most departments (guitars, vocals, drumming) and makes for good driving music. \\"Scissors\\" is one of the most disturbing, intense songs I have ever heard. clocking at 8 minutes and 25 seconds. It's just a near perfect album. They got even better on Iowa too. So now they are one of my favorite nu-metal groups. I would definetely recommend this to those with an open mind. But if you are more into older metal (metallica) stay away. That's it. Enjoy.
B000002G7E|1.0|Granted no one wants to listen to bland music, but just because an album is 'experimental', doesn't mean it is a classic. Critics would wet their pants if the Velvets recited a shopping list on record - that's just the way it is. But, honestly, some of the 'music' on here is the worst committed to tape in rock history - Sister Ray is an absolute travesty - there is barely a hint of a song in this awful piece of noise, yet somehow some of these reviewers find it absorbing and fascinating. I find it utterly inpenetrable, and I'm sure most other listeners would agree. The Velvets made some great music over their somewhat brief career - if you want to hear them at their best, check out their self-titled album and Loaded. By all means listen to this if you want - I did - but don't expect a trancendent musical experience. This is the worst Velvets studio album by a long way - even the overrated Velvet Underground and Nico is light years ahead of this. Of course it's 'cool' to like this album, but unless you are some self-proclaimed music afficianado who uses this type of music as a masturbatory accessory, how many times are you actually going to listen to this? The answer is not many. Buy some Rolling Stones albums instead - they had great SONGS and plenty of them.
0618002251|4.0|This is one of the best noval in the whole world, and if you like fantasy, then I will highly recommand this book. If you like humors and twisting plotling,then I won't be recommanding this to you because there are hardly any humors.<br />  reading age: 15+
B000069CWE|1.0|Ok i totally loved there first album so i figured this one would be good. When i listened to the first track i thought man this album is gonna be sweet. After the second track i was like what were they thinking with that song, and after the third i just wanted to throw the thing away. I would only suggest this cd to someone who prefers the rap side of Linkin Park.
B000068TPN|4.0|This movie begins by depicting the family lives of Mel Gibson and the men he would lead into battle.  Gibson's character is depicted as a compassionate family man and an officer who vows to physically lead his men into battle.  When he arrives in Viet Nam, he and his inexperienced troops are sent on a mission which is almost doomed to failure because of the inequality of their numbers compared to the Vietnamese.  As the battle rages and men fall, scenes are shown of their wives receiving the telegrams which inform them of their husbands' deaths.  The viewer learns to care about these men and then sees many of them killed in combat.  This is a sad tribute to the heroes who died in that battle and those who survived to tell us the story.
B00005QDW1|5.0|No, this album is not like their others. It is better. Yes, hey have gotten a little more 'pop' with their sound, but its still No Doubt, and they are NOT selling out. I can put this CD in my player, and I like every single song. That is rare in a CD. I really think this one is a good one, sorry if others dont. <BR>Quick Summarization:<br />1: Intro. What can I say? It's an intro.<BR>2: Hella Good. This is a pretty good song. I think it's OK.<BR>3: Hey Baby. Average, and OK.<BR>4: Making Out. I really do like this song. It's got a diferent feel to it.<BR>5: Underneath It All. I REALLY like this song. It makes me think of the beach.<BR>6: Detective. I really like this too. It's fun to sing along with.<BR>7: Don't Let Me Down. OK. I like it the least out of all of the songs on the CD.<BR>8: Start The Fire. Ok song, but i like it. Also makes me think of the beach.<BR>9: Running. I like this song a lot, i love the harmony.<BR>10: In My Head. Tachno song, its ok.<BR>11: Platinum Blonde Life. I like it, punky song.<BR>12: Waiting Room. REALY weird techno song. I like it.<BR>13: ROCK STEADY! BEST SONG on the CD. LOVE it. =)
B000003TA4|5.0|I Just bought this cd because my friend told me it was unbelieveable, and it has opened me to the world of the music i grew up with. As i heard the riffs of Smells like Teen Spirit, it sent shrills up my spine, and memories from 1st grade came back to me. Drain you is a great alternative surprise. Polly is also a very strong acoustic soung. On a Plain, is a huge highlight, if you like it check it out on Nirvana's unplugged album. Ending the the emotional and awesome something in the way, this is cd is a must for any early 90's grunge rocker.
0440219078|5.0|As there are so many reviews that has some kind of spoiler in them,I won't be describing what the book is about. After I finish this book, the first thing that came out of is \\"WOW.\\" This book describe that a world need conflict and opinion and most of all-LOVE.I'd recommand to age 10+.
0385484518|5.0|i started reading it its really a good book . i like to read books on life and how people see it .. so far am still waiting to finish it
B00005OAIE|5.0|I bought this CD just for the song \\"Your Body Is A Wonderland\\". I had never heard any other John Mayer songs, but I was not at all disappointed after listening to the whole CD. Every song was deep, intelligent, cleverly written, and really good. I never skip a song. I firmly believe that one of the biggest signs of a true musician is when you can see a part of them in everything that they write and play. So many performers are all about show in their songs and concerts. That can be entertaining, but you're left with no idea about who the person is that you're listening to. John Mayer is not that way. If you want to know who John Mayer is, all you have to do is listen to the CD. Every song comes from the deepest part of him. Another one of the great things about this CD is that you're not getting something that has been worked on and redone so much that it sounds nothing like how the artist really sounds. I've got the CD and I've been to his concert, and what you get on the CD is his true talent. His music is perfect for every part of everyday life whether it's working, relaxing, or whatever. I've had this CD for several months and it's still one of my top favorites!
B0000026J6|5.0|What is actually incredible is not that this is a great album from Leonard Cohen. No. What is trully unreal is that this album stands out so far out infront from all his rest.<BR>    Cohen is a poet and a great poet at that, but he is a poet before he is a songwriter and this might explain it all.<BR>    In \\"I'm your man\\" everything falls together. The lyrics have the capability to grab anyone no matter what his mood or musical predisposition. The music is a perfect match and not only for the time it was written. I heard this album just this week in year 2002 (it was written in 1988) and i thought \\"hmm, if this had come out this year it would still be a huge hit\\".<BR>    Which is why this album became a big commercial success. But you see, not all commercial music is cheap. <BR>    What to mention first concerning the songs on offer here? The memorable \\"First we take Manhattan\\"? You would have to avoid not knowing this song and if you somehow have you have missed a true classic!<BR>     But songs of great stature are in abundance in \\"I'm your man\\": the eponymous song of the album is a monument of Cohen's song writting ability, a very emotional song and a love song that manages to be great without being cheesy. The \\"Tower song\\" is a bitter recollection that a lot of people will relate to regardless of age and \\"Everybody knows\\" is a doomy one that will please the conspiracy freak in you (which you SHOULD have)...<BR>    But all in all there is no song that falls below par, there is no \\"filler\\". There is no song in this album that you would want to skip.<BR>    All that combined with Cohen's at times cold and at times emphatic delivery make the whole a classic album. In fact, if i were asked what in my opinion would qualify for a perfect album then \\"I'm your man\\" would be one of the first examples that would pop in my mind.<BR>   \\"Everybody knows that the dice are loaded....\\"
B00005UKE0|5.0|With this triumph, George Harrison proved without a shadow of a doubt that he had shed the Beatles years long before the 1970 breakup. His spiritual journey had begun years earlier, yet his uncomfortable status as a Beatle prevented him from releasing these intensely personal songs on a Beatles record. Harrison makes a statement with both lyric and melody with &quot;All Things Must Pass.&quot; This collection of songs, most of which were written years earlier and kept in Harrison's hope chest, provide proof of his desire to go beyond what any artist had, or has, in discovery of the meaning of life. Here, George profoundly shed his image as simply a Beatles in grand fashion.<br />This album works because we are not hammered with a collection of spiritual songs from his unusual, yet thought provoking personal religious beliefs. There are those strange moments such as with the song &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; and its references to, in Harrison's own words, a God with many branches known as religions. This mixture of Christianity and Hinduism are odd to say the least, however songs such as &quot;If Not For You&quot; and &quot;What is Life&quot; could just as easily have been crafted for a serious earthly love affair or a spiritual relationship with God. In a way Harrison leaves us confused as to his message but we yearn for more.<br />This mystery leads Harrison to ask the listener to contemplate life; to think about life's joys and sorrows, love and disappointment. The slick Wall-of-Sound production quality, provided by Phil Spector, profoundly adds to the spirituality of this gem. Without it, the album would sound like that of an acoustic troubadour rather than a grand creator coming down to greet his creation. Harrison had come a long way since his first released song, &quot;Don't Bother Me.&quot;<br />The extra tracks on this provide evidence of Spector's wall of sound. With the exception of &quot;My Sweet Lord 2000&quot; and an instrumental version of &quot;Wah Wah&quot;, they are a glimpse into the raw acoustic versions of a Spectorless All Things Must Pass. In &quot;My Sweet Lord 2000&quot; Harrison reminds us that he is still spiritual and still growing in his beliefs. No longer is the song simply an odd Christian-Hindu mix. Other religions such as Buddhism appear on &quot;God's Tree&quot;. The production of the song takes us back to Harrison's &quot;Cloud 9&quot;. It creates a bookend in a way for Harrison's solo career. It began with &quot;My Sweet Lord 1971&quot; and unfortunately ended with &quot;My Sweet Lord 2000&quot;. Although his guitar style had changed his belief structure had changed relatively little.  <br />Originally this was a three LP set. In CD form the Apple Jam session seems somewhat out of place. It may have been simple filler in those vinyl days as Harrison had exhausted his treasure chest of stored compositions.<br />Harrison dips his toe in the spiritual waters in this collection giving his audience reason to search for more. It is one of three Harrison offerings providing a look into his personal beliefs. Unfortunately the next two would shatter the myth that Harrison's spirituality could meld with his music in harmony.<br />This album stands alone without resting on the foundation built by the Beatles. It is truly a timeless classic and an autobiography of an incredible life ended too soon.
B00005JKWJ|2.0|The acting was pretty good, some of the action scenes were well done! The parts I hated were all the gory, those were the bad parts, plus the plot wasn't strong, but that didn't matter too much to me. Just the gore! Snipes was awesome, the other actors were okay, good movie with too much gore!! That's why it's 2 stars, said too much, later!
0451169514|5.0|I hate 1000+ page books, but this rounds out my favorite three of Steven King books (the others being Pet Semetary &amp; Salems Lot). Forget a long book chapter for chapter review, here's why you should read IT...<BR> Characters. I hate when people tell you the caracters are great in a horror novel, I want to be scared. But the caracters are better in this than any other King novel. He makes you recall your childhood, makes you one of the pack, then sends you down scary missions against an unspeakable horror.<BR> Enough said? IT is wonderful, scary, and a suprisingly fast read, get IT!
B00003CX7L|5.0|My daughter wore out the original Toy Story tape and it won't play anymore.  I thought there would be no way that the second one could be better, but I was wrong.  The story is so great! Woody gets kidnapped from his yard and discovers he is an antique doll from his old TV show &quot;Woody's Round-up&quot;.  We meet his round-up gang which introduces us to new characters, Jesse and Stinky Pete.  <br />Woody's pals, Buzz, Potato Head, Slinky and Ham are trying to get to Al's Toy Barn to rescue him.  There are some great moments in the movie that only an adult would catch (the reflection of the dinosaur in the toy car mirror ripped right from &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;) which will give you a chuckle.<br />Overall, a great story, some good tunes (Sarah Mclaughlan will make you cry) and lots of fun!  Worth 5 stars.
0452282152|5.0|Although the name Vermeer was unfamiliar to me, his art certainly was not.  It just took this amazing novel to help me make the connection between this 17th century Dutch artist and his artistic masterpieces.<br />Greit, the fictional subject of GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING, is a strong-willed young lady who does not let some of the degradation she experiences as Vermeer's maid destroy her spirit.  There is so much she is forced to deal with, from a plague-induced death in her own family to a shrewish mistress, a jealous maid, a lecherous patron, and a lustful and desirable master.  Yet her identity remains strong!<br />Ms. Chevalier's imagination and ability to weave such a fascinating tale from these paintings was truly amazing!  While I was reading this novel, I came across VERMEER: THE COMPLETE WORKS (Arthur K. Wheelock, Jr., 1997) at the library and I found it to be a very helpful companion to this story.  The book displays all Vermeer's works as well as interesting biographical information.  I found it invaluable while reading Girl With a Pearl Earring, because I was able to visually identify all the painting referenced in the story.  I also found the internet itself a great source when trying to find out additional information about Vermeer and his paintings.<br />I found this book exciting in both the narrative itself and the fact that it reintroduced me to the works of this talented painter. Thank you , Ms. Chevalier!
B00003CXI1|3.0|If you have only read the first chapter of the first book you will think that this is 5 star quiality but if have read the whole book this is a terrible based feature full of phony props,stupid jokes, and some bad acting. The added footage is horrorble too.<BR>Read the book instead.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Monster's Inc. is by far the best Pixar film to date. Is is more imaginative than both the &quot;Toy Story&quot; and &quot;Bugs Life&quot; films. The thriving world of Monstropolis is a visual treat filled with interesting characters and amazing sights. The movie has one of the best endings I've ever seen and it almost brought tears to my eyes. The best scene in the whole movies involves the Abominal Snowman and a lemon flavored snowcone. Plus, before the movie, Pixar gives us their latest and best short film &quot;For the Birds.&quot; It's absolutely hillarious. Definitely get this. Your whole family will love it!
B00005QIPH|5.0|I am not usually one to make risque predictions (especially one with a band that is so new), but I honestly think that this is the album that will be credited with reviving rock music at the turn of the century, similar to (dare I say it) Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\" about ten years ago. Note how both of these albums have perfectly humble titles to prevent an image of snobiness in going against the musical grain.  The setup and timing is too perfect for everyone (especially the media) to resist.  These kind of rich stories of rebellion cannot be avoided in creating the mythology of rock: a music scene gone stale with style-over-substance fads such as oversweetened pop and meatheaded rap metal is suddenly confronted with something that sounds very real and passionate. After all, this confrontation reminds us that \\"conflict is the heart and soul of drama\\". I know this current music scene has made many fans skeptical of any new band that comes along. But honestly, a true fan of rock music should not make the mistake of passing this album up. I have listened to many a rock album from the 60's golden age to the present and after countless listens of this, I can honestly say from experience that many of the elements of a great rock album are here. \\"Is This It\\" is a rock album worth giving a damn about and that's not an award I can just hand out in this \\"modern age\\" of music. To those who want to keep waiting for what you think will be the \\"real return of rock\\", get real. You are most likely waiting for a train that will not be coming for a long time, as drastic changes in a music scene do not happen every day. Don't take the Strokes for granted and be more open-minded about them! They have said in interviews that they are for real, plan to be around for a while, and are very against letting the hype surrounding them go to their heads. Give them a break and have some fun; it's what rock and roll is all about. For those of you calling them a Velvet Underground cover band, I feel aneed to comment as I have been listening to that band for about three years. Sure Julian's vocals are somewhat Lou Reed-ish, but this singing style is so cool and the Velvets have not been around for more than thirty years! It's time for a new generation of rock fans to experience such a vocalist in their time. The jangly guitars are a little similar but more of a hint than an overt rip-off. Musically, the Strokes have a more catchy sense of melody than the Velvets ever did, though the Velvets had a more varied and scizophrenic range with their beautiful pop ditties and their extended noise jams. Each band has some different merits, so stop only focusing on their similarities!.....I'm sorry about such an in-depth review. I will admit myself that it is pretty long-winded and can be accused of being pretentious. However, I really feel the need to challenge people's views and make them think more about something when given the oppurtunity. This album is one of the best, if not the best, overall musical microcosms of the emotions and tensions of New York City I have ever heard. The peak of this emotional expression of life there lies in the triple shot of \\"Last Nite\\", \\"Hard to Explain\\", and \\"New York City Cops\\" in my opinion. At the end of the day, I think The Strokes are making great music and I feel strongly enough about that to be firm on that view no matter what.
B00005JKWJ|2.0|I rented Blade 2 with some high expectations but was let down tremendously. The special effects are sub-par and the gore was just too much. There is constant fighting in the movie and it all just starts to feel repetitive and boring. I would recomend this to die-hard Blade fans and goth's, but that's about it.
B00005JKNC|4.0|I was as surprised as anyone to see Jim Carrey doing a serious part.  What surprised me even more was that he was tolerably GOOD at it, and shows he really can act.<BR>This is a story about a screenwriter who has everything going for him.  He lives in Hollywood (he calls it &quot;his town&quot;), has an actress girlfriend, and has been successful in his craft.  But when he is falsely &quot;blacklisted&quot; as a communist, his life changes.<BR>In a drunken state of depression, he goes for a drive, and has an accident which takes his memory.  He finds himself in a small town, unsure of who he is.  He is mistaken for a young man who had been though killed in WWII, and assumes the young man's life.<BR>This is a great movie, full of patriotism and down-to-earth, small-town values.  Its story is both sad and triumphant.  It would be truly great to see Carrey assuming more roles like these.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I had mixed feelings about Harry Potter coming to the big screen, but then I saw the movie. Wow. Chris Columbus has done an excelent job of bring Harry's world to life. Everything is just how I imagined it, right down to the last hallway and giant christmas tree. Hogwarts is amazing, and the quidditch game is awesome. While some of the special effects could use some work, overall they were all right. This movie is an instant classic for kids and adults. HP fans will be spellbound!
B0000029GA|1.0|Illmatic is probably one of the best lyrical hip hop cds out there.  The beats are not as impressing as I thought that it would be.  With people ranting and raving about the best hip hop album of all time with only 10 songs?  The beats are not impressing, all that is good is rymes.  If u want a good classic rap cd, I suggest Death Row's Greatest hit.  THat is a good cd
B00005JKYS|5.0|When Platoon first came out in 1987, I was swept by the emotion and thought it deservedly won best picture. Now, I look at it and it is one big joke.  \\"We Were Soldiers\\" is the Vietnam film that everyone should remember. Of course, since it was the beginning of the war, it was more idealistic before it turned ugly in Oliver Stone's Platoon era.  Enough though of the synopsis--watch it and love our Vietnam vets for it.  On a side note, the women actors were all great.  I can't think of any other woman than Madeleine Stowe as Mel Gibson's character's wife and wasn't Keri Russell absolutely gorgeous?

0679720200|5.0|Camus's Stranger is justly ranked among the greatest materpieces ever written for its simple style fused with an earth-shattering philosophy(Existentialism). This deceives the unread/untrained from considering the multiple layers of interpretation. (Who could ever forget the ending?) Calling The Stranger another book is like calling the the Mona Lisa another painting. You simply need to research the topic and Camus to comprehend the enormity of what is being presented (God, Man, Hope, Reality, Life, Absurd, time).  Camus shows Hope and choice in Man are ineradicable, they are Forever! To quote Oedipus &quot;All is well&quot;. Other books on the &quot;Absurd&quot; worth looking into: Camus's Myth of Sisyphus kafka's metamorphosis, Beckett's &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;. Next to Virgil's Aeneid this my all time favorite book.
B0000640SA|5.0|Listen up, all detractors and naysayers:  THERE IS NO FLAW.  Look closer, please.<br />That's it.  I can't take it.  I've already reviewed this movie AND this limited edition, but apparently I need to clear the air about this, since nobody else is.  THERE IS NO FLAW.<br />The \\"flaw(s)\\" I am referring to is Leonard's remembering things like <br />     (1) his condition, <BR>     (2) Burt's name \\"You don't have to be that honest, Burt,\\" in reference to finding out he is booked in two rooms, <BR>     (3) how many facts are listed on his body without looking (last scene, writes on card the fact number # without looking and then writes the license of Teddy's car), <BR>     (4) from a sequential perspective, after Leonard finds that Teddy tricked him and is confronted with the truth, he becomes distrustful of Teddy.  Note his behavior towards Teddy BEFORE he looks at \\"Don't believe his lies.\\" Leonard goes from being very trusting of \\"Officer Gamel\\" (in the black and white sequences) to being entirely distrustful of \\"Teddy\\" (for example, in the tatoo parlor, or in the Jaguar \\"who the f--- are you?!?).<br />... If you will so much as just LISTEN to the director's commentary, he'll tell you as much!  He flat-out tells us that the POINT of the movie is the DIFFERENT WAYS we remember things, apart from just our brain! The point is that we remember with MORE than just the part of the brain that Leonard had damaged; further, we remember with more than our brains.<br />Let's think this through, shall we?  Assuming Teddy's honesty, which Nolan verifies on one of the audio tracks at the end, we can deduce several truths:<br />     (1)  What happenned to Sammy Jankis and his wife is actually Leonard's situation.  Thus,<BR>           a.  Leonard's condition was something that his wife could not cope with<BR>           b.  Leonard's wife tricked him into overdosing her on insulin; she goes into a coma and dies           <BR>           c.  Leonard is incapable of understanding her situation and is put in an institution<br />     (2)  Teddy, the police officer assigned to his case, busts him out somehow (for info on this, go to otnemem.com).<br />     (3)  Leonard at some point in this process begins to CONDITION himself to recount the facts of his life differently.  This includes:<BR>           a.  He convinces himself that his wife died during the attack.<BR>           b.  He convinces himself that his wife was not diabetic.<BR>           c.  He transposes all these facts and guilt as belonging to Sammy Jankis (listen closely to his guilt over the whole thing ...there is a level of self-involvement the Leonard of the flashbacks would never have).<br />     (4)  Leonard has CONDITIONED himself to react to his murder and beatings of others in a way that hides the truth from him.  <BR>           a.  Leonard and Teddy have been working for a year or so, going from town to town and killing the \\"John G.'s\\" that Teddy sets up for his own reasons.  <BR>           b.  Notice Leonard's instinct and automatic behavior during a physical confrontation.  Compare his actions during the murder of Jimmy Grants and his actions after beating Dodd unconscious.  He moved quickly, methodically.  <BR>           c.  After murder, he assumes the clothes and identity of the person killed in order to hide his true actions from himself.  Further, after beating someone, he automatically immobilizes them and calls Teddy.<br />     (5)  THE WHOLE POINT OF THE MOVIE IS THAT LEONARD IS HIDING THE TRUTH FROM HIMSELF, HE IS \\"USING\\" HIMSELF FAR MORE THAN ANY PERSONS HE ENCOUNTERS.  HE IS \\"USED\\" BY THEM BECAUSE ON SOME LEVEL HE WANTS TO BE.  Thus, Teddy died, not because he used Leonard, but because he was a threat to Leonard's systemized method of lies and truth-hiding.<br />There, that's it.  Have a different point of view or see a flaw in my reasoning, feel free to email me with it AFTER YOU RESEARCH THE WEBSITE *AND* LISTEN TO THE DIRECTOR'S COMMENTARY.<br />I suppose that is that.
B00005KHKX|5.0|After the massive genre of the Hammer Horror film spree that swept Britain over the sixties and seventies, this eerie tale of withcraft and lust slowly crept into unsuspecting cinemas worldwide, tossed aside as just another Pinewood churnout. At first rejected by the production team and crew itself, it wasn't soon before it was slated by critics as a neglectful mishmash of porn-like images pasted together by silly glue. Straight-faced Sgt of police, Neil Howie (Woodward) is sent from the mainland to the remote Scottish island of Summerisle to investigate the strange disappearance of a young girl named Rowan Morrison. Before long, Howie is under the spell of the landlord's daughter, Willow (Ekland) and his Christian roots have to face his deep desires as she attempts to enchant him to her room. For the last 40 minutes, your thrilled by the second as the story slowly unravels to a harrowing climax that will stay with you for nights to come. A must-see for any movie lover.
B00005JKCH|3.0|Not being a spiderman fan, i went into this movie expecting nothing more than 2 hours of entertainment -- what you expect from similar blockbusters. And yet, as I watched the movie from beginning to end, I was startled at how predictable and boring the plot was. (on a side note, what is with the Green Goblin's costume? Almost laughable!) And they could have done so much more with it! Tobey Maguire was Ok acting-wise, but certainly not great; Kirsten Dunst was equally mediocre; The Aunt and Uncle weren't too bad. Although, while watching it, it is interesting to note how many times the characters wear black gloves.  I am embarassed that the top five U.S. box office hits ever include Titanic, Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, and this movie. ... I am really surprised how much this movie has been praised - I thought (contrary to what I expected) that Episode II was more entertaining. ...<br />However, there were a few redeeming aspects.  All in all, it is an enjoyable but not *special* movie.  The most disturbing thing is that there was so much potential to create a really stunning film, and what is delivered is instead adequate entertainment in the form of a summer blockbuster seemingly only concerned with making money.  Hopefully the sequels will be better.

0792839730|5.0|As a boy, after seeing the 'making of' documentary I had to see the film. I'd always liked war films, but this came out on top. Until then, I didn't know anything about Market Garden, but afterwards it sparked a real interest in the subject, resulting in much reading and research, interviewing veterans and many trips to Arnhem.<br />It's a fast paced blockbuster of a film with a great cast and gives a fairly good all round account of the Operation. It sits high up there with 'The Great Escape', 'The Battle of Britain', 'The Longest Day' and all of the other Second World War classics. It's definitely one to own.<br />I must say however, that since the benchmark film 'Saving Private Ryan', and the advances in special effects and cinematography, a film just dedicated to the British and Polish involvement is long overdue. In light of the many books and autobiographies covering the subject, a film made in this style I believe would give the audience an idea as to how bitter the fighting actually was, the complexity of the Operation and the bravery of the Dutch people.
B0000039PW|5.0|I personally think this album is the greatest of all time. I've heard illmatic I've heard Me Against The World I've heard Paid in Full I've heard Doggystyle but this is just the best. B.I.G. is one the best lyricist/storytellers ever just listen to gimme the loot. He even has love songs in this album such as \\"me and my bitch\\" which is one of my favorite songs of all time.
B00006FXB6|5.0|Songs for the deaf kicks ... to put it simply. After Rated R I had my doubts about whether the guys could surpass its greatness with the new album but damn did they make me glad I was wrong and with Dave 'I'm in two of the best bands in the world' Grohl on drums the album could not be anything less than amazing. Queens of the Stone Age are the best band in the world right now BUY THE ALBUM!
B000002B1M|4.0|I liked this album it's got guest apperances from cormega mobb deep some really good gangsta tales. the bad part is it's a little commercialized
B00005JKWJ|5.0|Although the first Blade was simply ok, the second installment blows it out of the water. This film is never boring. It has great action sequences and a good sense of humor. Ron Perlman was great as Reinhart and Wesely Snipes was great as well as Blade. Overall, one of the best action films of the past few years.
B00000I8NC|5.0|This CD is very short, but very good. While other Godspeed You Black Emperor! albums are enjoyable to listen to from time to time, they tend to drag a bit, sounding too grandoise and epic for their own good. Not this one. Both songs are relatively short (when compared to the 20+ minute aural sagas of the two-disk set), and much more streamlined. There isn't any of the excess noise and blabbering that detracts from the quality of most GSYBE songs. The quote used in &quot;BBF3&quot;, although not as strong as the religeous fanatic one on &quot;Static&quot; is kindly edited into the background, and serves only to add power to the music, not to make the listener think seriously about politics or religion. If you're new to GSYBE, pick this one up first; it'll give you a good introduction to their general sound and musical techniques, and is worth the money you'll spend on it. If you prefer vocals with your post-rock music, check out Sigur Ros.
B00004XONN|5.0|If you don't believe me, buy the album and find out.  The album itself is actually much more melodic and accesible than everyone makes it out to be.  The melodies aren't just present, they're ingenious, turning nonsensical lyrics (&quot;Ice age coming, let me hear both sides&quot;) into something incredibly beautiful.  It's the instrumentation that is way out there, with organs, synths, effects, drum machines, clicks, pops, and feedback creating too-much-to-listen-to soundscapes.  However the rhythm section and the voice of Thome Yorke (aka God) ground the tracks and add meat to them.  Not to say that the wild instrumention misses once in the entire album, it's actually incredible.  The 'weak' track is actually the only simple guitar ballad on the album, &quot;how to disappear completely.&quot;  The weird-time-signiture-techno tracks (Idioteque, Kid A, Everything in it's right place) are the standouts.
B00005U2LM|3.0|Even in an increasingly crowded hip-hop landscape, an album by the full Wu-Tang Clan will always be an event. Mostly that's due to the continuing influence of the Long Island collective's landmark '93 debut, Enter The Wu-Tang; an outing so strong that even casual fans still hope its success can be repeated. Unsurprisingly, Iron Flag doesn't recapture that claustrophobic brilliance--but it's still better than either of the follow-ups, 1997's Wu-Tang Forever and last year's W.<br />While the RZA's production hardly touches on the disorienting murk of yesteryear, the bright horn samples and upfront beats of new tracks like \\"One Of These Days\\" and the outstanding \\"Uzi (Pinky Ring)\\" are a surprisingly good substitute. The missing ingredient throughout, of course, is jailed Clan member Ol' Dirty Bastard, whose erratic charisma is sorely missed (and poorly replaced by his spiritual godfather, Flavor Flav, on \\"Soul Power\\"). Still, having a trio of MCs as powerful as Method Man, Raekwon, and Ghostface Killah insures the rhymes will stay interesting, with the typically grungy crime story \\"Babies\\" and the neo-patriotic \\"Rules\\" the best examples.
B000069HKH|4.0|When I first bought this album I was a bit disappointed by what I heard. My initial impression was that it was just slightly better than average. But I kept listening, and the album started to grow on me. When you pay close attention to the lyrics and the images they convey, you can feel the emotion that these songs have. I think this is one of Springsteen's best albums (although with so many great songs to his name a phrase like that is ridiculously redundant) and one of the best rock albums of the last few years. <br />The album opens with the solid &quot;Lonesome Day&quot; a mid-tempo rock song that immediately sets the mood; despair and imminent redemption. From that point on Springsteen takes you on a roller coaster of emotions with a very satisfying pay-off. Other standouts include &quot;Waiting on a Sunny Day&quot; &quot;Nothing Man&quot; &quot;Further on up the road&quot; &quot;Mary's Place&quot; and &quot;Empty Sky.&quot; Because of its inclusion of middle eastern rythmns, &quot;Worlds Apart&quot; sounds almost like it was done by another artist, but the lyrics are pure Springsteen. The album closes with a powerful trio of songs. The title song is rocker that will get your adrenaline pumping. It's followed by &quot;Paradise&quot; which is the kind of ballad that Springsteen is a master of. &quot;My City of Ruins&quot; has Springsteen singing with such intensity that you will do exactly what the chorus calls for; RISE UP. <br />Everyone points to the September 11th connection that this album has, which puts it on a completely different emotional level. But what is really interesting is that there is not a single direct reference to that horrific day. Springsteen is far too clever to be that obvious. These songs could just as easily be about the everyday struggle of people to overcome the challenges and tragedies of life. <br />Overall, a fantastic album by one of the great American artists. Get it, listen to it, then listen again. You will be very glad you did.
0345448898|5.0|I am a big fan of Harry Potter, so I decided to read these books. One is actually going to be for a book club at my school on October 3. Very quickly I was sucked into the Golden Compass, and the excitement just never stoped. They were heart pounding, interesting, and very deep books. They present a picture in your mind so great, and there charm just never wears off. A must read for science-fiction fans. The pace, the charecters, the excitement is right on. The world is so descriptive, and the plot complex, yet it is easy enough to understand. <br />Please note though: These books are quite more evil, and deep then the harry potter books, and some of the things I would say should not be read by people under 11-12. It is a great read for 13+ year olds. There is also a level of violence that is much higher then that of Harry Potter also.
B000069HKH|3.0|If there was anyone perfectly suited to doing a 9/11 tribute album, it was Bruce Springsteen, the greatest spokesperson of the average working man. So it should come as no surprise that the first full album with the E Street Band is a near full album tribute to the heroes of 9/11. However despite it being the Boss it just doesn't work as well as one would hope.<br />The Rising suffers largely from the weight of overproduction. The album is dominated by strings and keyboard noises, which makes them sound more pop than intended. The lyrics suffer from being too straightforward, making them sound forced and mainstream ready. (Taking on an almost Michael Jackson songwriting style) Bruce could have been far more uplifting had he made his message more subtle. And he would sound less forced if he had made some sort of political message. (Perhaps an ode to the thousands of Afghan civilians dead because of our search for the &quot;evildoers.&quot;)<br />Above all else there is a lack of E Street Band spirit. There are few distinctive guitar or riffs, and almost no solos from the big man, Clarence Clemons. (and what's an E Street Band album is without a sax) They try to capture that spirit once with the abominably forced Mary's Place.<br />However, I am not saying there aren't great songs on this album. The best songs here are the ones that do not directly alude to the 9/11 tragedy, such as the title track and Further On Up the Road. (Both great examples the Boss's songwriting abilities.) And when the formula works it works very well. (Lonesome Day, My City of Ruins, and Countin' on a Miracle) <br />The Rising is not a complete failure. When it works it is great, and when it doesn't it is bad. Some of the best songwriters dedicate something through subtlety and the surreal, which is what The Rising lacks. Combine with the sad, dull, atmosphere, and the result is an album simply doesn't grab you and demand your attention. But with several great songs, it is worth it for the Bruce Springsteen fanatic. But for the casual fan or those who know little about the Boss and the E Street Band, your money is better spent on something else.
0380817683|4.0|Marian Keyes explores the most complex of the Walsh sisters as she tells the story of twenty-seven year old Rachel, the middle daughter of the whacky Walsh clan. While Claire's story was told more light-heartedly in WATERMELON and sister Maggie's story was the subject of ANGELS, middle sister Rachel suffers the most serious problems in the family---drug and alcohol addiction.<br />I had put off reading this one for a long time fearing it would be too depressing, but after being captivated by Marian Keyes style in LUCY SULLIVAN IS GETTING MARRIED, LAST CHANCE SALOON and others, I decided to give this one a try.  Although the same biting humor is present and the wonderfully conversational tone is used by the first-person narrator, this book tackles a much more serious problem than her others and therefore packs a grimmer punch.<br />Though Rachel considers her drug abuse just a form of socializing, her family is justifiably concerned when she ends up in a New York City hospital nearly dead from an overdose.  They whisk her home to Dublin to a rehab center.  Adamant that she is not a druggie, Rachel only consents to being admitted because she hopes to meet rock stars and other celebrities.  What Rachel does encounter is other people like herself who abuse drugs, alcohol, food, sex, whatever. There are no celebs, just dowdy men clad in brown sweaters and unhappy women deep in denial.  She feels above them and takes a long time (nearly 400 pages) before she realizes that she too is an addict.<br />I thought the best part of this book was when she leaves rehab and struggles with staying clean and sober in the real world.  All is not rosy and Rachel hits rock bottom before winding up in the hospital again.  Can she ever come to terms with her parents perceived dislike of her?  Can she overcome her feelings of being the least pretty and least bright of the five Walsh sisters?  Will she reconcile with the friends she has hurt, the siblings she is jealous of, and the boyfriend who just can't take any more?<br />Rachel's journey is not a pleasant one.  Her situation is serious and only her hang-tough humor and deep vulnerability kept me rooting for her to overcome her demons.  Marian Keyes gives a disturbingly accurate portrayal of someone whose life has spun out of control and the long and difficult journey necessary to gain self-respect.end who just can't take any more?<br />Rachel's journey is not a pleasant one.

B000069HKH|4.0|Springsteen's latest offering \\"The Rising\\" is a mixed collection of rock tunes and stripped-down ballads, the most startling and moving of which address the pain and loss in America following 9/11. \\"Nothing Man\\", \\"You're Missing\\" and \\"Empty Sky\\" are certainly about as good as it gets...and when you're referring to Springsteen that's pretty darn good! These songs, along with a few others (even the anthem-like title song) comment poignantly on that September morning like nothing else ever has and possibly ever will. Listening to these tracks fills one with countless emotions and images which one can experience without the assistance of instant video replay...just close your eyes and listen.<br />Surprisingly and disappointingly though, many of the other tracks are merely filler, not up to par even with some of Springsteen's earlier mediocre efforts. Do what I did...just create a tape or CD of the nine or ten tracks from this 15-track album which clearly rise above the rest. It is worth listening to over and over again just for these memorable compositions and always-sincere performances.
B00005ATQD|1.0|Perhaps this movie was the cause of Tom Cruise's and Nicole Kidman's marriage to break up? Perhaps Kubrick saw a screening of this film during editing, couldn't take it and keeled over and died?  Painful to watch, hard to understand, and very slow and boring. Tom Cruise's character embarks on a stroll through New York City's underground and finds a secret society of sexual misconduct. However, even before that, his wife (Kidman) goes psycho on him after smoking some grass, and a dying patient he visits (Cruise is a Physician of sorts),the patient's wife gets weird on him too. So it goes to the next level where he ends up at this country club and the whole guest list are a bunch of sexual degenerates.  Was this a Freemason's monthly meeting?  Anyway, skip trying to rent or buying this film. If you have HBO or Cinemax already, the sister cable companies have been playing EYES WIDE SHUT constantly and you will catch the film sooner or later.  Watch it over and over and get confused even more.  A sad finale from the director who gave the world DR STRANGELOVE, 2001: A SPACE ODYESSY, SPARTACUS, FULL METAL JACKET etc. etc...!!
0060934719|4.0|This is the story of a man who is searching for a fallen star so he can deliver it to his 'true love'. This is an fun tale. Gaiman has such a unique voice, I guess it is one of those things that you reckognize and become attached to--like Stephen King's works.<br />There are various adventures working their way into the plot--they are all on a collision course, creating anxiety and a buisy climax. I really enjoyed it, and if you like any other work from Mr. Gaiman or the genre then pick it up and read.
6305878323|5.0|MARY POPPINS is classic Disney fare, and one of the best and timeless movie musicals in the history of film. It's great all around, and Julie Andrews deserved her Oscar.  What this reviewer would like to reiterate is the performance of Dick Van Dyke.  A solid performance with a British cockney accent, singing, and excellent physical dance routines (i.e. dancing with animated penguins!) to rival Gene Kelly.  Not bad for someone who really isn't a trained dancer. Dick Van Dyke's starring role equaled that of Julie Andrews and probably was the highpoint of his career next to his tv show. If given a lifetime award, it would be for this performance. If someone else had the part of Bert, the film would not be the classic it is today. Kudos to Dick Van Dyke and to MARY POPPINS.
B00005JKWJ|4.0|Let's face it, the original Blade is a classic, and following-up on it was a daunting task.<br />Fortunately, Blade II seemed to capture most of the best aspects of the original. About the only thing that lacked in this movie was a meaningful plot. At the end of the film, several questions buzzed in my head, as the characters and screenplay included some inconsistencies that simply were never adequately explained. The biggest one being... Whistler was supposed to have killed himself in the original movie (they even replay the scene where he supposedly shoots himself), yet he is alive and well in the sequel. Go figure.<br />Despite the various problems with the plot, the movie was very entertaining, and Blade fans will not be disappointed. As usual, Wesley Snipes IS Blade, and several other actors put in good performances as well. The soundtrack is o.k., but it was nothing comparable to The Matrix, or something like that. The visuals and special effects were fantastic, without being so overdone as to \\"look fake\\".<br />There are some great martial arts scenes, terrific action, and tons of what made the original Blade a cult classic. The addition of the bonus disc makes Blade II a good value, and addition to your DVD collection.
B000002JKA|5.0|I bought this album a little over a year ago, and at first it didn't grab me.  But about 4 months ago I gave it another listen... Not only did it grab me... it never let go!<br />I'm not a big fan of The Trilogy, but other than that, I LOVE the CD.  From the first moments of &quot;6:00&quot; and the catchy &quot;Caught in a Web&quot; the CD gets briefly weaker with track 3.  Although I'm not a big fan of &quot;The Trilogy&quot; I will say that technically speaking, it's fantastic, it just doesn't grab me like the rest of the CD...  After &quot;The Trilogy&quot; comes the crunching and angry &quot;The Mirror&quot; with its infamous &quot;Puppies on Acid&quot; intro, &quot;Lie&quot; picking up right where &quot;The Mirror&quot; leaves off.  The Myung-penned &quot;Lifting Shadows off a Dream&quot; (excellent lyrics), the energetic and passionate &quot;Scarred&quot; and lastly, a farewell to Kevin Moore (this was his last album before going on to pursue a solo career under the name Chroma Key) with the extremely dark and personal &quot;Space Dye Vest.&quot;  <br />&quot;Love is an act of blood and I'm bleeding<BR>A pool in the shape of a heart&quot;--Wow, they don't write lyrics like these any more....<br />Brilliant lyrics!  Jordan Rudess may be a more talented keyboard player, but Moore's lyrical talent is missed on Dream Theater's later releases.
B000000XB9|5.0|No anthology can really do justice to CCR. Like The Beatles, Stones, Who or any other band from that era, CCR is best appreciated by a quartet of classic albums; Bayou Country, Green River, Willie &amp; The Poorboys and Cosmos' Factory. Still, this is a great overviw of the band's essential singles and album tracks. What's missing are some important songs (Effigy, the scorching version of Good Golly Miss Molly and It's Just a Thought among many others) but hardly essential for the novice or casual CCR fan.<br />This fine collection's flaw is the sound quality. The original mastertapes sound like they weren't used on some of these tracks. The entire CCR catalog (with the exception of Live Europe which is available as part of the boxed set)has been remastered with stunning results. The sound quality here is tinny and flat by comparison. The &quot;sound&quot; of any CCR recording is as essential as the song itself and, in that regard, this collection is definitely lacking.<br />John Fogerty's songs have stood the test of time. Born on The Bayou, Down on the Corner, Who'll Stop The Rain and many of his other songs still retain the freshness they had decades ago. Hopefully Fantasy will remaster this collection. I'd recommend purchasing the quartet of albums mentioned previously. Additionally, Fogerty's first solo album (entitled John Fogerty)and available as an import has a number of moments equal to his best CCR songs. In fact, most of Fogerty's solo recordings although not as essential as CCR, are important and strong albums (the exception is the misguided Eye of the Zombie).
B00005YU1O|3.0|The animation and style of this movie is very good, but I found the dialog over-intellectualized. There really is no significant plot. I fell asleep the two times I tried to watch this piece. Well crafted, but philosophically redundent to me.<BR>As for the animation, it is really great! I found it interesting, what I remember of it!
0375413405|5.0|My mom was insistent that we kids learn to cook, and when Julia Child came on public television in the 60's, the whole family was glued to the set. We watched with fascination as she did things with food we Americans didn't know you could do. Mom bought this cookbook then, and I still have it, cover hanging by threads and covered in all kinds of saucy stains. It's still going strong, getting more stains every time I give a dinner party.<br /><br />We learned how to make omelets, roasts, soups like Vichysoisse (surprisingly simple potato and leek soup), and how to cook the bumper crop of garden green beans in a new and very delectable manner.<br /><br />I still think that this may be one of the best cookbooks for vegetables that I have on my shelf. I prize it for the meat section, especially a veal ragout that is possibly one of the most luxurious company dishes for a dinner party. It can be made ahead, and in fact, improves if you do. There are a lot of delicious desserts, some complicated (like Creme Bavaroise) and some cakes such as Reine de Saba (Queen of Sheba), a darkly moist and modest looking little chocolate cake. This is easy to make, but so rich and delicious it should be banned by the AMA.<br /><br />What's not in here is French Bread. That's in Volume II. Just in case you were looking for that recipe, fyi.<br /><br />We made French-style green beans and the Reine de Saba cake one memorable Thanksgiving when we were very young, and even the kids (seven cousins, five of which were BOYS) sat politely glued to the table for the ENTIRE meal instead of getting up and running around halfway through the feast. The food was THAT good.<br /><br />While I don't make French food every day because I watch my weight, I do use this book for the principles of good food preparation, even if omitting cream or substituting lower fat choices. I still find that these recipes are the ones I use as the \\"gold standard\\", whether it's boeuf bourguignon or a pear recipe (pears with macaroons) that has stood me in stead as a quick but unusually good dessert for years. My copy is bedraggled and I've had it for fifty years. Still going strong.as a quick but unusually good dessert for years. My copy is bedraggled and I've had it for fifty years. Still going strong.
B000066NW0|3.0|Avril Lavigne has an annoying voice but i like some of her songs.  I don't like her style or attitude but i try to see past it. My favorite songs on the album are:<BR>Tomorrow<BR>Things I'll never say<BR>I'm With You<BR>Losing Grip<BR>Unwanted<BR>Nobody's Fool<BR>Too much to ask<BR>Anything but ordinary<br />p.s. Michelle Branch is better!
B00002Z88D|3.0|Well, S&M certainly does have it's up's and down's. Metallica not only made a live album, but made a live album, a greatest hits along with the sanfrancisco sympony. A good idea? well lets see here. Well what do you get when you mix one of the worlds most popular metal/rock bands with a symphony? in some cases a pretty good live album, and in some...well.....disaster. Ill start by commenting on the first disk, and progress from there. For a live album, this is not to shabby, not at all. Songs like the thing that should not be, are example where metallica and the symphony seem to go into seperate directions. And it kinda disjoints the musical listening experience, where it just sounds off. But songs like the ecasty of gold, the call of kutulu, master of puppets,hero of the day, no leaf clover, are example where metallica and the symphony blend vertuly perfectly, and where the timing is right and everything. Now the second disk. Further more songs like nothing else matters, untill it sleeps, for whome the bell tolls, whereever I may roam, one are also example of musical blend. Also whitch leads me to the conclution that metallica could of very well added a third disk to the set. Where as adding songs like fade to black, welcome home(sanitarium), orion, to live it to die, both of the unforgivens. There you would really have something.
B000069AUI|2.0|The hype was what it was, overkill in promoting a sophmore CD of a group who can do much better then what was produced here. I was disappointed to say the least, and although it's hard to top the efforts of &quot;Parachutes&quot;, this doesn't come close. Coldplay needs to turn a deaf ear to the suits who obviously made them &quot;rush&quot; this out for profit. Buy &quot;musicforthemorningafter&quot; from Pete Yorn, that'll give you your ear candy for awhile.
0553579908|4.0|Of all the things that annoy me in books and movies, probably the one problem that grates on me the most is the fact that main characters never die and that all the evil characters have no motive or real train of thought beyond 'Be evil'. Whereas the good characters will be painfully good. A Clash of Kings was a welcome breath of relief. Main characters die and there were no truly good characters. Most the time I didn't know who to root for though I knew who I wanted dead (Joffrey and Joffrey again).<br />About the sex and violence: Violence I've never minded unless it's exaggerated, unrealistic or pointless. The sex isn't needed but those parts are generally short and can easily be skipped over. <br />This book went somewhere, at least one king and maybe two are disposed of in its pages and I see an end for it closer than the Wheel of Time at least.
B00006F7XJ|5.0|I first heard this Camel lineup on the CD The Paris Collection. I e-mailed them and told them that this is the best version of Camel since the original band.  I have heard this new studio recording a few times, and think it is the best thing Camel has done since their glory days of the 70s.  All the tunes and playing are excellent.  Prog rock is alive and well.
B00005QK3W|1.0|Boy, this is great! Almost my favorite is the last song (performed live!) with its brilliant triplet: \\"Some people want to fill the world with silly war songs/And what's wrong with that?/I want to know\\". Then there's \\"The Great Exploiter\\". Who could forget this lyric: \\"Yes, I'm the Great Exploiter..../My greed is such/That I pander much/I'm wearing a nose that is brown\\"?<br />Hey, the guy who says every record ever made by any former Beatle into perpetuity is automatically a five-star record hit the nail right on the head! That's why I'm urging everybody to buy immediately the complete Pete Best catalog!<br />Have a Great Day!!!!!
630471193X|3.0|Great movie, a 5.  <BR>Since July of 2001 there is no reason to release a non-anamorphic (or &quot;Enhanced for 16X9 TV'S) DVD.  It does not cost any more to encode the extra video information.  You only have to click on a check-box in the software.  &quot;Anamorphic&quot; DVD's contain about 30% more video information on them.  Non-anamorphic DVD's are blurry when viewed on a 16X9 (widescreen) TV.  This will require us to buy another DVD when we upgrade...hmm, maybe there is a reason to still release non-anamorphic DVD's...
B00000JH09|5.0|this system album is amazing. the live tracks and extra bits make it the complete system experience.
0446605409|4.0|1) The reader of the audio book was OK as far as depicting when different characters were talking. But, he sounded like what I imagine John Corey sounding like which was great...especially durning the funny lines.<br />2) Yes, I did laugh out loud a few times...I enjoyed the humor very much.<br />3) The four hours of tape kept me interested because I had no preconceptions of what to expect. I didn't expect a thriller with lots of chases but simply a NY Cop uncovers a government cover-up. This wasn't the case and the simplistic plot allowed me to enjoy the characters more.<br />4) Complaint #1 - Geez, didn't know sex with strangers was that easy nowadays.<br />5) Complaint #2 - What is up with bad guys telling their plans first then shooting later? Then again how many stories have I read with the hot tempered warrior type or the serial killer who was abused as a child?!?<br />6) Enjoyable story...at one point I wished I had not listened to the audio version but had read the book instead.
B00006G8G1|5.0|Iron Maiden is easily one of, if not THE greatest band ever! Rock In Rio is one of the best live concerts I've ever heard. The sound and picture quality is amazing!! It's easy to see why Iron Maiden is still going strong. Buy this disc today...Up the Irons!!
B000068TPN|3.0|The start of the film tries way too hard and is not very interesting.  The very poor music does not help.  Cliches abound.  The movie does build well, particularly through the battle sequences.  It is, overall, simply adequate...although far better than the film disaster Patriot.
0062502182|5.0|I picked up this relatively short book one morning at a book store and started reading it in the park.  I quickly took it home and finished it before the sun had set.  Absolutely beautiful.  I had tears in my eyes and a smile on my face as the sun finally set; I know it sounds silly, but this book honestly touched me.  Paulo Coelho weaves common truths, ageless parables, a boy's wanderlust, the hidden magic of the world, and the meaning of life into one engrossing, thoroughly enjoyable tale.  Predictable, maybe, in retrospect; although I was too entranced by the rythmn and beauty of the story to make any predictions or think about anything else; I could only follow along like a kid by a campfire gazing at the flames.
B000068QY7|5.0|There is not one bad song on this disc.  Highly recommended wheather your an Oasis fan or not.  Great songwriting.
0316666343|1.0|I wanted to love this book. Sebold's characters do things that literally make no sense.  The surviving sister is shaving her legs for the first time and her dad comes into the bathroom while she's doing it and stays to talk with her.  Am I supposed to believe that took place?  This scene as written is just one that needs a re-write.  I could not believe the preposterous situations Sebold wrote her characters into.

0060090383|5.0|Rachel's Holiday is a Walsh sister novel by Marian Keyes, so I expected it to be funny with fast-paced dialogue and a contemporary feel, and it was.  I finished this story in record time because I couldn't put it down.<br />What caught and held my attention, though, wasn't the humor.  It was the realism with which Keyes portrayed Rachel's journey from denial to acceptance of her drug addiction. The novel is set partly in The Cloisters, a treatment center reputed to harbor and rehabilitate some of the world's most glamourous celebrities.  Rachel arrives with valium in her suitcase expecting massages and seaweed wraps, and her bumpy trip towards clean living makes for entertaining as well as informative reading. I don't think I've ever read such a realistic treatment story, detailing the often-humourous ins and outs of an in-patient facility.<br />The story speeds along a little too quickly after Rachel gets out of treatment, racing through the next year in the last twenty percent of the book.  But in general, I was impressed by Marian Keyes's grasp of the recovery process--and I'm already impressed with her story-telling.  Reading Rachel's Holiday was a nice mini-vacation in itself.
B00004Z459|2.0|This album tries very hard to fuse rap and metal together but I think they need to take a clue from bands like KoRn, Faith No More, and Rage Against the Machine because these bands do the rap-metal thing ALOT better than LP could ever do. I think this band is the product of sell-outs like Limp Bizkit. I think if you put some metal riffs, a rapper and DJ, and a leadsinger that sounds like Nsync this would be your final product, and it is. This is definitley the most mainstream metal can get, you ever notice how many people like this .......people like teenage girls who usually despise metal, but they enjoy this because of the frontman-Chester whatever his name is, and because he sounds like Nysnc. Any person who knows what TRUE metal is just know this is just poser ... All true metal lovers should AVOID this wannabe metal and keep going for the REAL stuff, like Godsmack, System of a Down, Metallica, Pantera, Slayer, and real METAL bands like those and forget this waste of money and time. IMHO this should not even be classified as metal.

B000002U82|5.0|ok - this is truly a piece of art.  i am a huge floyd head and this remains to be my favorite album to date to play my guitar along with.  it is just a great album, as the band was still playing together before roger waters became more dominant in the writing situation.  rick wright and dave gilmour were still putting in a good part towards the writing process.  but while gilmour and wright concentrated more on the musical aspect, waters focused solely on the lyrics, which made a terrific combination of elements.  here's a lineup - <br />breathe - a great opener, starting with the traditional dark side heartbeat - \\"ba bump, ba bump...i've been mad for ... years.\\"  continues into a very laid back song, one of my favorites.<br />on the run - a synthesizer-dominated piece about paranoia and being \\"on the run.\\"  Really picks up the tempo a bit.  great live when the airplane zooms from the back of the stadium and crashes into the stage (segue into \\"time\\")...<br />time - ...and on goes the music.  starting with the crash of the airplane left off from \\"on the run,\\" \\"time\\" is a straightforward song about how time is spent, in a nutshell.  starts out with the traditional clockwork (if it is youre first time listening to it, be prepared to jump!) and continues into nick mason's drumming and open notes from gilmour's guitar, which then goes into the up-tempo rock anthem.  it then reprises back into \\"breathe\\" to end the song, which then goes into...<br />great gig in the sky - ...a rick wright song, continuing where the \\"breathe\\" reprise left off.  starting with a simple piano piece, it is a wonderful song, featuring the likes of the scat vocals of clare torrey.  fades into...<br />money - ...ching-cha-ching - the clicking of cash registers which then goes into the classic roger waters bass riff, setting the mood for the opening lines of the rest of the band.  has a great jam, featuring the likes of saxophonist dick parry and a ripping guitar solo from gilmour.  it then fades into...<br />us and them - ...another rick wright piece with waters' vocals about WWII(and a great one at that).  this is a really great song; really slows down the tempo of the album and calms down the listener (if youre not calm already).  it then goes into...<br />any colour you like - the second instrumental in the album; very synthesized like \\"on the run\\" but also features a great gilmour solo.  it then goes into the classic...<br />brain damage - ...originally called \\"dark side of the moon\\" itself, brain damage is a terrific song, one of many that specifically details madness (as if you havent figured that out by listening to all the other songs yet) - \\"the lunatic is in my head.\\"  then goes directly into...<br />eclipse - ...the summing up of one's life in about two minutes - \\"all that you touch; and all that you see.\\"  this is another great up-tempo song, one which really ends the album on a high note - \\"but the sun is eclipsed by the moon...\\"  fade into the same \\"ba bump, ba bump\\" that started the album and into the EMI doorman's classic quote, \\"there is no dark side of the moon really...matter of fact, it's all dark.\\"<br />this is a true masterpiece, one which really brought pink floyd out of the underground and made them superstars.  i recommend it to anyone who is a fan of \\"music\\" - not just pink floyd, not just rock, any kind of music.  you have to respect this album, especially with the likes of its brilliant sound effects, considering it was made in 1973.  (oh yea, it is also one of the best selling records ever - enjoy!)

B000066AC6|5.0|Great CD, though different from Parachutes - at once darker and less romantic.

I haven't been able to get an answer as to why...
0385474547|5.0|The first time I read this book, I hated it.  Just flat hated it.  That was my junior year of high school.  Flash forward a few years to college, and it's on the reading list again.  &quot;Why, oh why?&quot; I moan.  Then I read the thing.  And you know what I discover?  It's a masterpiece.<br />Chinua Achebe describes &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; as a response to Joseph Conrad's &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, which is, comparatively, a denser, perhaps less accessible read.  The parallels are there: the ominous drumbeats Marlow describes as mingling with his heartbeat are here given a source and a context.  We, as readers, are invited into the lives of the Ibo clan in Nigeria.  We learn their customs, their beliefs, terms from their language.  Okonkwo, the main character, is the perfect anti-hero.  He is maybe Achebe's ultimate creation: flawed, angry, deeply afraid but outwardly fierce.  To have given us a perfect hero would have been to sell the story of these people drastically short.  Achebe's great achievement is in rendering them as humans, people we can identify with.  So they don't dress like Americans, or share our religious beliefs.  Who's to say which method is correct, or if there has to be a correct and incorrect way.  Achebe provokes thoughtfulness and important questions.  His narrative is easy to read structurally, but the story itself is painful and frustrating.  It is worthy of its subject.<br />&quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; provoked some of the best classroom discussions I've ever experienced.  As a reader, it has enriched my life.  My thanks to Achebe for his marvelous contribution to literature.  This book has a permanent place on my shelves.

B00000253N|5.0|Well I guess I should write a review for this album. I'm hesitant, though-since nothing I can say in words can do the album justice.<br />You won't find revolution in this album. You won't find the most witty and intelligent lyrics you've ever heard. You won't hear 60's Dylan. At all. But I guarantee this album is the most emotional and the most human album you will ever hear. Dylan does something here and does it better than anyone else: He is playing these songs as if we were listening to his soul; it's very emotional. In fact; it's almost emotionally \\"batty.\\"<br />When I first heard \\"Big Girl Now\\" I cried. When I first heard \\"Idiot Wind\\", I was waiting for every word to come dripping out, and I was stunned at the emotional strength words could hold-for the first time. When I first heard \\"Shelter From the Storm\\" I felt lucky to be alive. When I hear \\"Buckets of Rain\\" I vow to make my life peaceful enough so that I can truly capture its essence. \\"Tangled Up in Blue\\" is like the perfect ending to the greatest movie. And there are more!<br />The one song that people seem to-not often- single out in a less positive light is \\"Lily, Rosemary, & the Jack of Hearts\\"-they say it doesn't quite \\"fit\\" with the album. They think this way because of the lyrics. While the other songs are told in a first-person, personal account experience, this one is omniscient, and seems quite comfortable in being so. Melodically, however, it fits in just as effortlessly as the other songs of <Blood on the Tracks>- with a grace and beauty that only Dylan can put into folk music. (There is of course on song-\\"Meet Me in the Morning\\" which is classified as blues, not folk.)<br />People warn you not to listen to this when you are sad. I say, you should DEFINITELY listen to this when you are sad, or depressed. Feelings-no matter what they are- are meant to be experienced, and this album reminds you of that and that being human can be a beautiful thing.
B00003CXTG|2.0|This disappointing and emotionally bankrupt take on Dec. 7, 1941 pulls out every manipulative trick in the book -- the soldier who comes back from the dead, the love triangle, the hokey ending -- and yet still fails to ultimately engage the viewer.<br />The 40-minute battle scene, seen as the best part of the movie by most reviewers, is undeniably stunning. But for all of the technical prowess and craft displayed, the combat itself takes on a video game-type quality lacking in the visceral emotions that one would expect to experience in a war movie. To me, this was the Disneyfication of Pearl Harbor. One of the most brutal days in American history, and yet most of the blood is not up close and in your face, it's comfortably in the background, perhaps not to offend their apparent target 15-year-old girl Titanic audience. Even the hospital scenes have a gauzy white sheen between us and the wounded, a technique that does not work and further removes us from the action. The scenes of soldies being strafed while swimming in the water could have been far more powerful, but in this rendition the bodies look like ants on the screen. Worse yet, unlike in Titanic, where we came to know the cast and were thus interested in their various fates, the main characters here are removed from the action, until they stage an improbable (but somewhat true to history) aerial defense with two planes. To the viewers, the deaths of thousands of soldiers has about the same impact as a laser rifle striking down a Storm Trooper in Star Wars, because we don't know the soldiers in the thick of the action -- they are merely fodder for the special effects.<br />As far as the ship capsizing scenes, it was extremely Titanic-derivative.<br />The love story, which takes up an astounding 2 hours of the 3-hour epic, is neither horrible nor good; it's simply pedestrian. You don't spend $200 million on a movie for pedestrian, do you? There are plenty of hokey plot developments, oodles of laughable dialogue, and some bad accents thrown in for good measure.<br />The thing about this movie is, despite all of my complaints, I actually came out of the theater thinking that it was pretty good -- a three star flick. But over time, the visual impact of the special effects fades and you are left with disappointment in a war movie that wasn't, a $200 million mediocre piece of schlock that gets its by-the-numbers two stars, but ultimately a missed opportunity for greatness. (I would have loved to see the James Cameron version of P.H.!)<br />By the way, watching this movie on video or DVD will likely lessen the impact even more, since those special effects will be reduced and those ant-soldiers will become dust-mite soldiers. If you are going to watch P.H., at least watch it on the big screen.<br />Last week, I saw Apocalypse Now Redux, which, while it shares a three-hour-plus length, is ten times better than Pearl Harbor. If you want to see what a real war movie looks like, do yourself a favor and watch Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece.
B000002UA0|5.0|The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn..........     What can anyone say about this album? Great........... Yes..............Groundbreaking............... Definitely....... Although the later albums may have led to greater  financial success for the band, this first album points the way, the shape, that the band would later take. This album is all the brainchild of founder, Syd Barrett, and shows the \\"Genius\\" of this underrated member of the groundbreaking group. Though \\"Syd\\" may have not been the greatest guitar player, he was great at composing abstract and compelling music. This album is 35 years old and still has a fresh sound to it. It is truly 'Timeless'. Listen, for example to \\"Pow R. Toc H.\\" . What pure energy! And \\"Take Up Thy Stethoscope And Walk\\" and \\"Lucifer Sam\\".....Clasic \\"Floyd\\".......One last note........When you listen to this album, please listen to the percussion and the keyboards.......Rick Wright and Nick Mason......the two real unsung performers of \\"Floyd\\" An added note added 7/11/06..... \\"Sid, off you go to your own Astronomy Domine so Set The Controls For The Heart of Sun\\".....Thanks for the music my friend
B000002L7Y|5.0|You know the &quot;curse&quot;, right?  Once a group or singer wins &quot;best new artist&quot; of the year on any music awards show, they seem to be doomed.  At least in the USA that is what happened to a-ha.  A pity becauase there isn't a single track on this album that I didn't like.  The lyrics speak of a yearning and a searching, and if you saw any of the videos they were well matched to the lyrics.  But ultimately a-ha was very pop and the British accent very strong and the &quot;curse&quot; kicked in.  If you have only heard their sole American hit, listen to a few of these and then buy this album if you like what you hear.
0140143505|5.0|This is the story of an American writer (the author of the book) who strikes up a friendship by mail with a bookseller in England.  The entire book is a series of unedited and un-commented-on letters exchanged between Hanff and the Marks & Co. booksellers at 84 Charing Cross Road.  Her primary pen pal is a man named Frank Doel, with whom she shares a love of old books.  [Perhaps this is the point where I should say that I flatly disagree, without reservation, with the previous reviewers who believe there was a potential romantic attachment between the two of them.]<br /> The correspondence runs from 1949 until 1969, during which time Helene and the people at 84 Charing Cross Road exchange Christmas gifts and news of their families, but never meet.  At least in the early years of the correspondence, almost every year Ms. Hanff states her intention to come over to visit England, but something always comes up to prevent the trip.<br /> In 1969, one of Hanff's letters to Frank Doel is answered by another member of the firm, informing her that Frank Doel has died.<br /> This is a beautiful book, which can be read in 45 minutes.  I suppose every reader will take his or her own lessons from the book, but here is mine:  If there is something you really want to do in your life, then DO IT when the opportunity arises.  Time is finite.  If you keep saying, \\"Maybe next year,\\" there will eventually come a time when there IS no next year.  It is a painful tragedy that Helene Hanff never got to England to meet Frank Doer and the other people at Marks & Company, and that poignant sadness is what stayed with me after I had closed the book.
0446677450|3.0|There is some very good advice in this book.  Kiyosaki explains in very simple terms the difference between an asset and liability.  He also advises that the readers keep liabilities low, start building assets as early as possible, and that an academic education is not part of becoming rich.  The rest of the text is rather muddled and self-congratulatory.  Having rubbished the idea of academic qualifications, at one point he congratulates himself for having paid for college himself.  The book talks a lot about investment, but never answers what for me was a crucial question.  If you don`t have anything to invest, what do you do?  He also suggests changing jobs frequently, filling various roles in companies, to learn as much as possible.  Fine, but few companies will keep hiring employees who do that, especially with few qualifications.  Maybe the book is a little time-sensitive.  Also note that if you disagree with the author at any point, you will find the book quite insulting.<br />I gave the book 3 stars for its best parts.
B00005RHGK|4.0|Bleeping kids! Why did they have to stop in the middle of nowhere to check out a sewage pipe? After almost being run down by a crazy carney, they followed the insane clown to an abandoned church. Right next to the church was a pipe that went into the ground. The 'person' got out of its truck and had an object in sheets. After dumping the thing down the pipe and after the 'man' left the scene, the college brother and sister went to investigate it. Well, you know what happens. Hell crashes down on their heads and they're pretty much doomed. The creature follows them and has a motive. To find body parts. Ok, I'll never drive around where there are flat lands. Don't stop thinking about tomorrow. If a carney bugs you, ignore it or give him some canned food.
0553260111|4.0|Lots of action, implausible plot, paper-thin characters.  Bourne is an interesting idea overworked.  Ludlum must have started out as a sports writer who describes every punch.  The &quot;hero&quot; is so fantastic that you can hardly wait to see how he will survive his latest predicament. Not believable, but entertaining.  Would make a good comic book. Too complex to be a movie, as recently demonstrated by the recent film, which uses just a few of the situations in the book.
B00003CXGG|5.0|Her stardom was soaring high and the highly talented Aaliyah made her first screen debut. Aaliyah's debut in \\"Romeo Must Die\\" will show, not her singing ability, but acting ability. Aside from selling millions of records, this movie and \\"Queen of the Damned\\" will be remembered for her participation alone. Her screen presence is electrifying and you won't be able to take your eyes off of her. Aaliyah's energy and enthusiasm made this movie worth while. The beautiful singer/actress definitely had 'IT'.
B00004Y6O9|4.0|Van Halen is one of the best rock 'n roll bands of all time, and they came out with rapid fire with this debut album in 1978. How can a band go wrong with David Roth's powerful lead vocals and Eddie Van Halen's screeching, rugged guitar chords? Here you have two of the best collaborations there are! This is one kick... album filled with rapid, rough, rowdy, down-and-dirty rock songs like \\"I'm The One,\\" \\"On Fire,\\" and \\"Atomic Punk,\\" jamming classic rock hits like \\"Runnin' With The Devil,\\" their remake of the Kinks' \\"You Really Got Me,\\" and \\"Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love,\\" and the free-flowing, powerfully charged songs like \\"Jamie's Cryin'\\" and \\"Feel Your Love Tonight.\\" Eddie Van Halen let's us know that he is one of the best guitar magicians ever! Especially on the instumental, \\"Eruption,\\" which features some of the meanest, scorching, sizzling guitar work from him. He comes alive on every song, and gives each an edgy, pure rockin' flavor that will always be timeless. Check out \\"You Really Got Me,\\" and \\"Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love.\\" Eddie's rugged, edgy, melodic guitar chords he punches out are unforgettable, and very addictable! I love those songs. Alex Van Halen is a master of the drum set, and delivers rolling, rapid, shuffling, pounding beats that are absolutely flawless! Of course, Michael Anthony's bass guitar is so full of power! David Roth has one of the most wicked rock 'n roll voices around. His strong, hard voice totally brings each song to its' peak of perfection. \\"Runnin' With The Devil,\\" \\"I'm The One,\\" and \\"Atomic Punk,\\" shows what Roth is capable of as he yells and screeches out his rugged voice at you. Then there's \\"Ice Cream Man,\\" which starts out as kind of a bluesy number, with great bluesy singing by Roth and some perfect soft guitar strumming by Eddie. Then it explodes into a catchy beat-filled rock song. It's really a very unique song. Van Halen shows the world right away with this debut that they are here to bring us some of the best in classic rock! Grab this album and jam!!
B00005JKJA|1.0|uh... what?<BR>That's the feeling I got at the end of this movie.  I, along with many of my friends, feel we wasted both our time, and money when we rented this movie.  It's like a BAD version of Momento, only the viewer is the one in the dark, who doesn't know what is going on.  I kept waiting for a great hook in the end, to tie it all together... I kept waiting, and waiting... and waiting... you get the idea.
B000001ES9|4.0|Though Rush's later albums are a lot more progressive, this album; their debut, still has some prog-rock features. On the whole, this album is never dull or boring. For me, whenever I listen to this album, I feel so full of life. The music is fun and full of life, and you cannot help but move and rock your head from side to side. Geddy Lee's high, energetic voice keeps in perfect time and gels so nicely with the flow of Alex Lifeson's blazin' guitars and John Rutsey's rapid drums. The album gets you going right away with \\"Finding My Way,\\" a completely groovey, rockin' beat-filled tune with great bass work from Lee, and flawless guitar work. \\"Need Some Love\\" is faster paced and is just a clean fun rock song with a catchy flow of beats and guitar chords. \\"Take A Friend\\" is a song featuring a slower shuffle-like beat, and it gives you kind of layed-back feeling. \\"What You're Doing\\" and \\"In The Mood\\" gives us an earful of groovey, sizzling guitar chords and a contagious beat. \\"What You're Doing\\" also features some neat echoing effects in the lyrics from Lee. \\"Before And After\\" starts out with such a neat twist. It begins pretty slow and free-flowing with Lifeson's soft guitar strumming, Lee's smooth, quiet bass, and Rutsey's slower-paced drum beats. It then suddenly explodes into a wave of rapid, rockin' music. The last song, \\"Working Man,\\" gives us great rythem to tap your foot to. The guitars are rapid, edgy, energetic, and excellent as usual and the beat is just free, clear, and groovin'. \\"Here Again\\" is my least favorite on the album. It is much slower, a bit draggy and gets kind of boring to listen to after a while. Overall, I was very impressed with this first effort by Rush. I love this band! They are extremely talented. To those who have not heard the very early Rush that may have known the band only by albums like \\"2112\\" and \\"Moving Pictures,\\" give this album a listen! It is a bit different, but you won't be disappointed!!
0064407667|2.0|I was very excited to hear about this series because I was looking for something good to read until the next Harry Potter book came out.  However, I was glad in the end I had only purchased the first one because it scared me a great deal.  Maybe it is the new-mom syndrome, but part of the story that dealt with a perilous situation for the baby horrified and terrified me.  Plus, there seemed to be some underlying sexual undertones between some of the adults and children.  As an educator, I did like how the author explained more complex vocabulary terms, but it did get a little old to an adult reader.
B000002572|4.0|A friend of mine who likes classic rock like I do, played this album for me on her CD player, and that's when I came to like Boston's debut. I can remember going to the carnival when I was younger and hearing \\"More Than A Feeling\\" blasting away. Though this is not my favorite Boston album, it's one of those ground-breaking debuts that just keeps selling even 26 years since it became popular in 1976. Tom Scholz, Brad Delp, Barry Goudreau, Fran Sheehan, and Sib Hashian give us hard, melodic, rugged, edgy guitar riffs, thundering bass riffs, rowdy, stompin' drum beats, and some kickin' harmonies. Their classic hits \\"More Than A Feeling,\\" and \\"Rock & Roll Band,\\" and \\"Something About You\\" are my favorite songs from this album. All are pure, jamming classic rock anthems that just blow you away and are smokin' with intensity. I absolutely love the harmonies on \\"Something About You,\\" and \\"More Than A Feeling\\" has a killer bass! Two other hits; \\"Foreplay/Long Time,\\" and \\"Smokin'\\" are fun as well. \\"Foreplay/Long Time\\" features some mean, rapid drumming by Sib, and the free-flowing, drifting, melodic guitar work takes you away. The song then shifts into a different gear to start the slower catchy beat of \\"Long Time.\\" \\"Smokin'\\" is just down-and-dirty, rapid, jamming rock that is fun and danceable. \\"Hitch A Ride,\\" and \\"Let Me Take You Home Tonight,\\" are softer flowing rock tunes that have great beats. There's some nice soft guitar strumming from I think, Delp, in \\"Hitch A Ride.\\" With \\"Hitch A Ride\\" and \\"Let Me Take You Home Tonight,\\" you just want to kick back and tap your foot, and sway your head back and forth. The gang does such a great job on their first effort! Delp is such a talented classic rock vocalist who can really hit those high notes, and he puts forth such intensity and feeling into each song. What a classic lineup of talented musicians! Pick this album up and have fun with it!
0380977788|5.0|_Coraline_ continues Neil Gaiman's long running theme of placing seemingly ordinary humans in the way of forces beyond our world. These humans, that remind us so much of ourselves, find themselves in worlds that defy explanation, and yet seem so familiar, because they are the places we inhabit, the places we've grown up in, and the places we have nightmares about.<br />In _Coraline_ this world is a mirror of the flat the title character finds behind a door that normally leads to nowhere. The real world flat is inhabited by Coraline with her two loving but absent minded parents, two delightful old ladies retired from the stage, and a mysterious man training a mouse circus.  In the dark reflection Coraline finds her \\"other mother\\" waiting to love Coraline and give her all the attention she could ever want, the old ladies becoming young again and return to the stage, and the old man with his successfully performing circus.<br />How is this a \\"dark reflection?\\" you ask? A very good question, and one that makes this book so brilliant in its execution when you find out. Coraline is offered something by her other mother that your average monster would not offer: the chance to have Coraline's desires fulfilled. And yet that makes the other mother the perfect monster.<br />There is of course a price: Coraline must replace her eyes with brigth shiny black buttons and lose her own soul. Coraline politely refuses the offer and returns to her own world, only to find that the other mother has kidnaped her real parents. And so begins Coraline's quest and adventure back into the world of her other mother.<br />There are moments in this book that will haunt you for days: the other mother and other father with their black button eyes, the songs of the delightfully creepy rats, the ghostly children, trapped in the mirror, the silent cry for help from Coraline's real parents, and the creeping hand . . .<br />There are moments that will give you joy for days: tea with the drama queens, the picnic, father's recipes (a particularly autobiographical moment from Gaiman's own life), conversations with the cat, and Coraline's triumph.<br />And Coraline does triumph, for if she did not _Coraline_ would not be the fairy tale it is. For as the book reminds us in its prophetic quote from G.K. Chesterton, \\"Fairy Tales are more than true: not because they tell us dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten.\\"<br />A wonderful adventure story for children, and a story that will give adults nightmares, _Coraline_ will delight and frighten all who dare to spend some time in Gaiman's fantastical vision.the picnic, father's recipes (a particularly autobiographical moment from Gaiman's own life), conversations with the cat, and Coraline's triumph. <br />And Coraline does triumph, for if she did not _Coraline_ would not be the fairy tale it is.

1573226521|4.0|Alex Garland's novel \\"The Beach\\" is not only a great summer reading but also a work about the deeper insights of the human being. <BR>Richard, the protagonist, comes across a map of a remote island in Thailand which seems to be like a paradise. Together with a French couple, Franoise  and Etienne, he undertakes the adventurous trip to the Beach where he finds a bunch of travellers that have established their own little community with rules and regulations. Sal, the leader of the group, says \\"we're trying to make a place that won't turn into a beach resort\\" and it is thus the most important thing for the \\"beachers\\" as they call themselves, not to give the location of the Beach away to strangers. Richard loves the life on the Beach, he works in the fishing detail and finds friends. But as soon as the group faces some unexpected difficulties, the community seems to fall apart. Because there is no institutional system, the \\"beachers\\" are forced to look after themselves, which soon turns out to be a problem when they have to deal with death. And as soon as the group is forced to face new difficulties, the <BR>community falls apart and they learn that they can neither escape the influences of Western society on some remote island nor escape the corruption and selfishness of their human nature. <BR>The utopian motif of a new form of life on a remote island as we already know it from Platon's \\"Atlantis\\", Jonathan Swift's \\"Gulliver's Travells\\", Daniel Defoe's \\"Robinson Crusoe\\" or William Golding's \\"Lord of the Flies\\" is being followed in Garland's dbut. The island as an earthly paradise a garden eden that turns into hell. <BR>Golding questions the thesis that the human being is originally good and that only society is the cause of the corruption of the human soul. <BR>One aspect that I did not like about \\"The Beach\\" was the long introduction. It took me a while to get into the story, because Garland explained every detail of the setting, but once the \\"real\\" story started Icould not put it down anymore. It really hooked me and Garland's colloquial style made the reading fun for a non-native English speaker.

1587990717|4.0|Naseem has written a great book that explains the importance of chance in life. He uses humour to explain the various things in life that cant be attributed to anything but chance. The decisions that might look like a work of pure genius can actually have no rationale behind them. The stories that he tells while explaining the concepts are the heart and soul of this book. Its a must read.

B000002UWF|5.0|I, among (apparently several others), am a recent fan of Louis Prima.  It is impossible to feel bad listening to this music.  I only wish I could get the lyrics so I could sing along better.  The music is so... upbeat.  The songs taped live are especially fun.  &quot;Angelina/Zooma Zooma&quot; make you feel like you are right in the Vegas night club in a front row table. <br />I listen to this CD ALL THE TIME and heartily recommend it.<br />Chris F.F. from the Oregon coast.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I am so tired of reading reviews where critics bash bands because their records have been hyped up. Who cares about the &quot;hype&quot; or &quot;anti-hype&quot;? Listen to the damn album! Does it sound good to you or not? <br />Furthermore, questioning the merit of an album based on how many chords comprise the content of a song is absolutely ridiculous. I assume all those critics that bash The Strokes because their music is &quot;simple&quot; don't listen to music, but instead read the guitar tabs and determine which bands sound great based on the complexity of the notes. If these &quot;simple&quot; bands lack talent, then I'm sure all the critics out there can pick up a guitar, strum a few simple chords, and put together a catchy, fresh, happy sound. Please, I'm so sure...<br />The Strokes have an uplifting, happy sound to their music. I don't care how difficult it is for them to strum a chord on their guitars, they sound great. If you don't like their style, fine. However, understand that the complexity of a bands music is in no way related to whether or not their sound will be appreciated.
B000062XFG|3.0|Great stuff, but technical issues with the DVDs themselves, picture drift, digital lines at the top of the screen, led me to try the DVDs on several other players.  All yielded the same results.  Replacement copies had the same issues.
B00004Y6NV|3.0|On Every Street was the album that I waited for for a long long time, and when it came out, I listened a few times and then put it away in favor of Communique and Brothers in Arms.  I have taken it back out since, and appreciated it for what it was, but it's just a little too heavyhanded with the social commentary, and a little too light with the smoking tunes.  <br />As many others have said here, there are some real gems.  Knopfler's stellar guitar work is what makes the album even worth mentioning, and songs like How Long, Planet of NO and Calling Elvis certainly stick with you for a while, but there's just too much filler in between, and the Dire Straits fan is not used to filler.  And being the rather bombastic and preachy filler that it is, it's not even easily ignored.  At the end of the day, On Every Street is just too much work to listen to much.
B000066NW0|5.0|I'm mostly the anti new music sort of girl, but once in a while, I pick up something new.  I saw Avril's video and liked the song \\"Complicated\\" so I hesitantly picked it up.  Being 30, I still remember being into the skater punk thing 10-11 years ago and this music kind of reminds you of being 17.  So if you are that age, you will identify with that.<br />Its also refreshing to see young female singers that aren't using sexy songs and clothes to sell records.  Though this is teen pop in a way, its better than quite a bit of what's out there.  The songs are catchy, their enjoyable to listen to and definitely have appeal.  If you are open to some new music and female singers, pick it up.  Its actually quite good.
B00004Y6NX|5.0|Once one gets past the collections and Brothers in Arms, and becomes interested in being a real fan, one comes to Making Movies.  <br />The bit from High Fidelity- Top Five Side One, Track Ones- how could he have missed Tunnel of Love?  And just as one comes off the impact of that song, to get hit with Romeo and Juliet- this is what got me through High School.<br />It is perhaps a less consistent album than Brothers in Arms.  Some songs are a little sketchy, sound like maybe they should have done a few more takes.  The second half is maybe a tiny bit below Dire Straits standards.  But for the payoff of the high points, I'd pay ten times the selling price.  Some of those songs I can listen to six times in a row.
B00006AW2F|5.0|I cannot say how thrilled I was to finally be able to get this album on CD...You have the Stones doing some songs with more of a 50's doo-wop feel to them (totally unlike the Stones we know). First time listeners to this record may think that this album is awful but I urge you to listen...It is actually rather pleasant to listen to. There are also the rockers done in the true Stones form. Although there are a few clunkers (like with all albums) on a whole the album is rather good. Additionally the sound quality is phenomenal. I originally had this record on 8-track and then on cassette. I was able to find a mint condition of the vinyl version in a local mom and pop record store in the neighborhood. This was the last of the Stones albums I had yet to obtain on CD to complete my collection (on CD) and now I can honestly say that I have them all. Thanks ABKO!!!
B000051VWW|4.0|A very nice album.  Lovers Rock has some gems that are as great as anything Sade has done, like By Your Side and Lovers Rock.  It's a little different than some of Sade's other albums which is at first worrying to the Sade fan who has become accustomed to such consistent quality.  It's a little more hip-hop perhaps, but it's still the real deal.  Sade is nothing if not dependable.  I miss the great instrumentation that was always there on the earlier albums (this is a little more electronic) but the songwriting and smoky vocals are pure Sade.
B00000DFSK|5.0|U2 has always put out good stuff. They never fail to entertain and this album is no exception. This combines the best of U2 into one amazing whole. If you're a diehard fan or just a casual listener, it doesn't matter, you will enjoy this album.
B00004Y6NP|5.0|This album is one of the few that transcends its time of release.  Brothers in Arms will never be thought of as an 80's album, although released in 1985.  It has a power and depth that can't be relegated to such a narrow era.<br />Knopfler's soulful guitar is so much smoother and more sincere than the licksters of the glam-rock period, and the whole band achieves a level of genuine skill not often seen or appreciated in the new-wave syntho years of the early 80's.  Combine this with intelligent lyrics and catchy songwriting, and the result is a keeper.  Perhaps not as truly indicative of what Dire Straits was really all about as earlier albums like Making Movies or Love over Gold, but a great introduction to one of the best acts out there.
630469654X|5.0|A wonderful romance of cursed lovers.  He is cursed to roam the night as a wolf, she the day as a hawk, and the curse will only be broken if they both can appear in human form.  Add to this a thief that ends up taking care of them and you have a wonderful tale, film is exquisite detail to history.

You'll learn a little about all of the above and be entertained by a talented, exciting writer. If you're interested in Buddhism, please read something by an authentic Buddhist teacher (i.e. the Dalai Lama, Thich Nhat Hanh, etc.). Jack Kerouac's own life and the lifestyle presented in this book have little connection to the practice of Buddhism.

B000001ESJ|5.0|While it was their album 2112 that caught the public's attention, it was with 1977's A FAREWELL TO KINGS that Rush began to mature into the perfection they would show in the early 1980's. The transition from drawn-out (and often over-long) concept suites to concise, nearly radio-friendly songs started here.<br />The album's opener, which may suprise the listener with Alex Lifeson playing the acoustic guitar, an instrument never before featured so prominently for Rush. It also suprises with its excellent production. Rush and producer Terry Brown succeeded in making this a crystal-clear album with all instruments perfectly balanced.<br />In &quot;Xanadu&quot;, the second track, Rush's drummer and lyricist Neil Peart rips off the poem &quot;Kubla Khan&quot; by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Geddy Lee's vocals, in relating this tale of a man who sought immortality and became mad as a result. Over the 11 minutes of the songs, Peart's drumming is obviously more mature than on earlier albums. Why he might not be as furiously moving about the drum kit as on 2112, Peart shows a greater understanding of timing and when *not* to hit a note.<br />&quot;Closer to the Heart&quot; is probably the most popular Rush song in that it's all many people know of Rush because of its frequent play on the radio in the late 70's. The first radio-friendly song wrote, less than three minutes long, the song nonetheless goes through several movements and some incredible musicianship (Lifeson had to invent a new kind of guitar stand to move from acoustic to electric guitar so quickly). While undoubtedly there were fans who believed Rush was selling out, for them making a song short did not mean doing away with quality.<br />&quot;Cinderella Man&quot;, Lee's only lyrical contribution to the album, is the low point of the album. While only four minutes long, it seems to drag on forever because it is musically plain and lackluser. While Peart's lyrics have often been called pretentious, they are at least thought-provoking. Lee, however, is clearly a lesser songwriter.<br />In &quot;Madrigal&quot;, the album's shortest track, is a short ditty in which Peart thanks a special someone in his life. It's rather insubstantial,<br />&quot;Cygnus X-1&quot; is the standout of the album, and one of Rush's finest and most ambitious songs. Lyrically it is about an astronaut daring to enter a black hole (Cygnus X-1 was the first black hole discovered, in the late 1960's),  and musically it is a maze of shifting time signatures, some of Peart's finest drumming, and group musicianship more consistent than anything Rush has put out before. The song along is enough to recommend the album.<br />While I'm partial to Rush's output of the early 80's, A FAREWELL TO KINGS should be the first of Rush's albums from the 1970's you pick up.thought-provoking.

B0000683DH|4.0|I enjoyed this movie and until the new improved DVD version of Star Trek The Motion Picture came out I rated it as the best of the Star Trek movies. Now of course Motion Picture is far away the best with the new effects and editing but Wrath of Kahn is still second best. Two BIG problems with Wrath of Kahn which seem totally inexcusable since this movie is a sequel to the original episode Space Seed from the T.V. series. In Wrath during the Kobayashi Maru test it is said that the event takes place in the Klingon/Federation neutral zone. There is no Klingon/Federation neutral zone, it is and has always been a Romulan/Federation neutral zone, and even more dumb is Kahn remembering Chekhov when he sees him again. Hello Paramount, Kahn never met Chekhov, Chekhov was not in the episode Space Seed, he never met Kahn and Kahn could not remember someone he never met! Do you guys even watch the original series before you start writing stories that make no sense? Geez, really. Those gripes aside, Wrath is a fun movie and the director's cut restores some critical dialog and the DVD transfer is beautiful. But if your a Trek fan then please check out the new version of Motion Picture on DVD. It is a totally different movie, way better!
B00005IC2H|5.0|i started to hear an insane amount of hype about this band sometime in early 2001, and just decided to buy &quot;agaetis byrjun&quot; without ever hearing the band. its terrible to say, but at first i didnt take the time to listen to this record, and passed it off after about 5 mins. (with most of the tracks ranging between 6 and 10 mins, it can take a while for things to happen.) i would listen to it as sleeping or background music but really never gave it much thought. one day it just sort of hit me. for being a four peice band using traditional insturments, this group of icelandic men make some of the most unworldly, lush, and beautiful soundscapes ever created. jonsi's heartfelt falsetto rises above and weaves inbetween every note making it one of (if not the most) important instrument. the fact that he sings in icelandic and sometimes in his created launguage &quot;hopelandic&quot; never takes away from the effect his vocals have on you. you dont need to know what he is saying. jonsi and the band can create what theyre trying to get across by their amazing arragements. its hard to explain how incredible this record is. its theme music for any moment in life, film, or almost anything else you need it for. beautiful, happy, or sad. it fits and creates any mood. and for another great sigur ros moment, watch the end scene of Vanilla Sky where a song off their upcoming record, called (), &quot;njosnavelin&quot; is played.
B00004RETD|5.0|I don't know how I'm going to sum this up in 1,000 words, but I'll try!! First off, I have to say that for 13 years of age, I'm a little late on discovering The Who...but this is what made me love them so much!! I just saw this but a couple months ago, they're my ultimate new favorite band!!<br />\\"The Kids Are Alright\\" has wonderful footage of the performances by The Who...it shows AWESOME close-ups of Pete, Roger, Keith, and John playing in their own little worlds...seeing John play the bass is great, he was so impressive! It also catches great shots of them being the destructive devils they are =) My favorite performance was in the Smothers Brothers show, where Keith blows up the drums and John is just standing there without a care in the world! Just a *minor* distraction! =P <br />I really think that anyone who is a Who fan, or wants to be one, should buy this!! I had the pleasure of taping it on my own, but now it is gone, and the only way to get it back, is to buy the documentary! I also advise getting the album, I have it on both CD and vinyl and the songs are great to listen to! They show the best of The Who in this documentary...please buy it, it's for your own good!...

B00000JTB2|5.0|On December 6, 1983 a small independent television station in Ontario, Canada brought together Albert King and Stevie Ray Vaughan for a studio performance.  In 1999 after both of these kings of the guitar had gone to another plain of existence, this recording was released on cd.  This was truly a magic moment and some of these guitarists and bluesmen's dynamism and power has been captured forever on cd.  One feels privileged to listen to it.<br />Albert King was unique in the blues world.  A man whose class and style has been greatly emulated.  a left-handed guitarist known for playing his flying v upside down, with the bass strings at the bottom rather than switching them to the top as do most guitarist.  King was greatly appreciated in both the blues and rock world.  He often played at the Filmore West where he rubbed shoulders with such rock note worthies as Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix who he mentions on this cd.  He died of a fatal heart attack in 1992.<br />Stevie Ray Vaughan the young superstar guitarist from Texas who woke the rock world up to the blues yet again was just becoming famous when this cd was first recorded.  He had previously met Albert King and sat in with him on a few sessions.  During the recording king tells him that he had noticed him and &quot;I thought about it all the way to Illinois and though he's got the makin's of a good fiddler.&quot;<br />Songs featured include a mix of blues standards, Albert King's songs and Stevie Ray's Pride and Joy.  It starts of with one of the most unforgettable versions of Stormy Monday that I've ever had the pleasure of hearing.  Intermixed with the songs are exchanges between Albert King and Stevie Ray Vaughan that are truly a delight to hear.  Blues At Sunrise is an impressive display of both men's ability with the guitar.  Albert King mixes in stories of playing at the Filmore with Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin while performing and chuckles with pleasure over Stevie's playing and exclaims &quot;Oooh Wee!&quot;<br />Great guitar work, two true guitar kings having a great time together is reason enough to buy this cd, but it really does have some wonderful songs.  It is among my favorite in my cd collection.  I wouldn't want to be without it.e!&quot;<br />Great guitar work, two true guitar kings having a great time together is reason enough to buy this cd, but it really does have some wonderful songs.

B0000039LE|4.0|The plot is actually very simple, 6 year-old Michael Myers brutally murders his sister, Judith Myers, and is locked up in a mental hospital, until he escapes 15 years later and returns to Haddonfield (his hometown).  He proceeds to stalk his other, younger sister, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis).  Along the way, he kills a couple of dogs, and most of Laurie's friends, and almost gets her, too.  But, Michael's old psychiatrist, Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) is determined to find and stop Michael before he turns the small town of Haddonfield into a slaughter house.  This is the first movie in the popular Halloween series, and I'll admit, Michael Myers is a lot more unpredictable than Jason.  For one, he would grab his victims and hold them for a bit, keeping you wondering what he's going to do to 'em, and you'll find out, don't worry, but the Jason films actually showed most of what Jason did, half the killings in this doesn't even show what Michael did, but that's okay because it adds to the suspence and keeps you wondering...and wondering...sorry, space out.  Anyway, the Halloween Theme, composed by writer/director John Carpenter (the director of this film), was especially chilling, and pretty catchy at that.  Jamie Lee Curtis was pretty good at playing Laurie, but I'm sad to say that she got a little too cute with those two kids in one part, and I hated that they kept Myers in the shadows most of the time, and now you know why I only gave this four stars.  Plus, there isn't a whole lot of gore either, but I can do just fine without that, it doesn't matter, but sometimes, things get a little too gory for me (a.k.a. Wishmaster 3, Faust: Love of the Damned).  The sequel, Halloween II, was especially amazing, Halloween 4 (skipped over #3 for obvious reasons) was typical, 5 was a downer, 6 was really good, 7 was, again, typical.  You won't find Jamie Lee Curtis in 3, 4, 5, or 6, but she finally appears again in H20 (a.k.a. Halloween 7), and is in the beginning of Halloween: Resurrection.  If you love horror films with little blood, lots of shadows, and a chilling soundtrack, than this is the one for you, but even if you're a gore fan, the soundtrack and the overall feature will make up for the lack of blood.alloween: Resurrection.  If you love horror films with little blood, lots of shadows, and a chilling soundtrack, than this is the one for you, but even if you're a gore fan, the soundtrack and the overall feature will make up for the lack of blood.

From the first page I was hooked...I had a hard time putting it down and finished it in less than a week.

B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge is probably one of the best movies i've ever seen. It incorporates music, fantasy and love into one movie. I thought that Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman were absoutly amazing and Baz Luhrman is pure genious. However, this film is love it or hate it. You either LOVE LOVE LOVE it or walk out in the middle of it. Even if you don't like it, I would see it for the cinemotography. Its a really good film for people who like a good love story or a musical....ENJOY!!

0385335482|4.0|What a fun book! It was quite the page-turner, and I finished it 2 days. Sophie Kinsella has a nice stream-of-consciousness writing style, and I really fell in love with her character Rebecca Bloomwood. &quot;Becky&quot; has got some flaws, yes, but her heart is in the right place. Some of the passages of her going on &amp; on about what she bought &amp; how she's going to juggle things to pay for it get a bit long-winded, but that's a minor complaint. One more small complaint is the lack of physical description for the characters. I don't think we are ever told what Becky looks like. I just ended up picturing her as the author- since there is a photo of Ms. Kinsella on the back of the book. The rest of the characters' physical descriptions are scant as well &amp; I never got clear pictures in my head of them- something that I, and most other readers I would think, like to do. What I really loved about &quot;Confessions of a Shopaholic,&quot; is that it wasn't just another run of the mill &quot;day-in-the-life-of...&quot; frothy confection. It had some meat to it- Becky learns some valuable lessons, &amp; I loved the cat-and-mouse romance between her and Luke Brandon. (Very Bridget &amp; Mark-esque!) I've read almost every book about single British women looking for love that has been released since &quot;Bridget Jones' Diary.&quot; &quot;Confessions of a Shopaholic&quot; is one of the few that deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as Bridget.
B000066AXC|4.0|The title and topic alone are enough to suggest that this is a very special movie ----not one car chase, and lots of food for thought, and maybe worry.  I knew some people in the 50s and 60s who went through shock treament in dismal institutions, like John Nash did in this film<br />And his determination to use his considerable math and reasoning skills to work his way out of scizophrenia was very inspiring.  Some critics on this web site bash director Ron Howard for not getting deep enough into the characters and the story, but hey, he and the cast and crew obviously worked very hard on this film to get it this far.  And I thought his treatment kept us involved in what could have been a very lengthy, complex film which might never come together.  He also demonstrated that while Nash was able to pull himself out of the depths by the force of his will and intellect, the cure was far from complete, and the struggle would be ongoing.<br />Let's have more movies like this.  Think of all the beautiful minds out there ---contemporary and historical, and how much we could learn about everyone from Galileo to Einstein to Sagan, and many more.<br />I can't wait for the next film in this genre.
B00006FXB6|1.0|I saw the \\"No One Knows\\" video on ..last week and I thought it was clever and the tune kina catchy.  I bought the CD/DVD set and I was disgusted.  First the DVD doesn't contain the video of \\"No One Knows\\" as the cover sticker implies.  It's just a collection of bad live footage, yuck!  ... I decided to give the CD a listen.  The music overall was thin and lousy.  No punch, no dynamic range, and worst of all uninteresting.  ...

They are creative and encouraged my son to experiment with his finger painting in a new way. (After we discussed it of course.) This is an excellent introduction to colors and you can use this as a jump off for other senses- we talk about the sounds, the colors and the food the animals in this book eat. It is a lot of fun.<br />I like books that you can use as an introduction to a new idea or to reteach an old one. THis book is well worth th money because there are so many things you can teach using this little book.<br />Enjoy.

B000002KBU|5.0|I saw Diana Krall yesterday and she covered a song from the Blue album &quot;A case of you&quot;. The rendition was awesome and I had the urge to listen to this CD I haven't listen to for ages. <BR>It seemed like I haven't taken this one for such a long time. I listened to it twice and I understood why all those female singers nowadays consider Joni the godess of songwriting. <br />There is nothing to contest on this album. First the cover is stupendous. And I don't see a song of lesser quality on this remarkable collection (OK may be carey ...).<br />31 years after, it seems like yesterday.
B000002OX7|5.0|This was probably the best studio album released by this English band - one that garnered merit from solo Beatles' members and The Rolling Stones alike. Baba O'Riley, Won't Get Fooled Again and Behind Blue Eyes are among their most emotionally intense signature songs, effectly portraying youth resentment while at the same time shadowing obligations of adulthood. With all songs remastered and tracks added, this first-rate recording surpasses what average rock bands accomplish(ed) among their entire days. After listening to this disc, your stereo may soon start believing it has become your most valued asset. With Entwistle at near talented prime, this CD now also provides an appropriate tribute of/to his bass genius - something much to be missed/remembered by the Rock community...
B000002MNL|5.0|After the near-disaster that was 1991's \\"Kill Uncle,\\" Morrissey bounced back in a big way with 1992's \\"Your Arsenal\\" and this, his fourth solo non-compilation album.  Morrissey originally planned to reunite with guitarist and producer Mick Ronson for more of the glam-flavored fun of \\"Your Arsenal,\\" but, sadly, Ronson passed away.  Instead, he hooked up with Steve Lillywhite (U2), and the end result is a great pop album with more of the clever lyrics we expect from Mozzer. Only he could get away with self-pity on a song such as \\"I Am Hated For Loving,\\" in which he croons, \\"I still don't belong to anyone.\\"  Betrayal surfaces in \\"Hold on to Your Friends,\\" and he lashes back at backstabbers in \\"Why Don't You Find Out For Yourself\\" and \\"Speedway.\\"  There's also the chilling tale of a slow death in \\"Lifeguard Sleeping, Girl Drowning,\\" and he addresses his own broken relationship with his father in \\"Used to Be a Sweet Boy.\\"  Morrissey's work doesn't match his stuff from the Smiths, but then again, this isn't a Smiths record.  \\"Vauxhall and I\\" is a great slice of mope pop that comes recommended.
B000002MY3|5.0|i bought this the first time it was printed. way back when i wore JNCO jeans and had green hair. i loved it then and i appreciate it more now.<br />this is one of those rare sonic masterpieces that needs no getting used to and can be played from start to finish without having to go near the FF button. BUT what sets this apart from so many of my other albums is the way you'll keep coming back to it when youre in a certain mood...theres no word to describe that mood, but it would be what you get when you put Depressed, Jaded, Lighthearted, Heartbroken, and Whimsical in a salad.<br />anyway, im glad i grew up with alanis and in many ways i see her as the Janis Joplin of my time. <br />enjoy
B000069AUI|5.0|When it comes to marketing an artist as the Next Big Thing, nobody can do it like Britain's hype machine.  Oasis, Travis, the Stone Roses, and Radiohead have all benefited from generous UK publicity in the hopes of spawning the next international multiplatinum act.  For this reason, I was apprehensive about buying Coldplay's \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head.\\"  Sure, I knew it got gleaming reviews and it shot to No. 1 in over half a dozen countries, but is the album any good?  You better believe it is.  While American acts have been running the nu-metal/rap-rock craze to the ground, the British, once again, put us Yanks to shame by showing us how rock is DONE.  The disc is a winning mix of mellowed-out pop and edgy rock that recalls Oasis and shades of Radiohead, but the sound is certainly their own.  My fave tracks of note are \\"In My Place,\\" \\"God Put a Smile Upon Your Face,\\" and the title track.  Great hooks, impressive melodies, and smart lyrics.  And while lead member Chris Martin isn't quite the most distinguishable vocalist around, his singing nicely compliments the music on this disc.  \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" is already on my list of the best albums of the year, and in my school of music, it gets an A-.

B0000009RT|2.0|I don't understand why the fans like this album so much. I love Frank Zappa's music, but this one just never moved me, beyond a few chuckles over the mock do-wop and bubble-gum numbers, and beyond, of course, \\"Who Are the Brain Police?\\". For me, this track is THE ONE that gives a real hint of FZ's originality as a melodist. Why I found FO sounding so dated today is basically because it probably has ALWAYS sounded dated (aside from the one or two avant-garde bits, not really representative of the album as a whole) as compared with what the rest of the rock greats were exploring in '66. To the contrary of 1968's \\"We're Only in It for the Money\\" (recorded in '67), Zappa sounds with FO as a character merely out of the 50s - a decade I cannot really identify with, having been born too late in it -  instead of truly hip to what was going on around him in the pop culture (Hendrix, Doors, psych era Beatles, etc.). If this is just an illusion, I nevertheless doubt that many new listeners of today would \\"get it\\" and really appreciate those sounds and musical textures, esp. with the cornyish, commercial orchestra arrangements that back up The Mothers here. As for the appeal it apparently had among some of the rock intelligentsia of the day, my guess is that this had to do basically with the novelty factor - there was no \\"humour in rock music\\" back in 1966! - as well as some nostalgia over their OWN Fifties' based youthdom.<br />The freak-out jam (\\"Return of the Son of Monster Magnet\\", a long track) is pointless random noise, echo and screams. Since the sound quality is very dry and harsh and the musicianship of that particular line-up, including Zappa himself, far from impressive by later days standards, I would never recommend this CD to a Zappa newbie. A couple of years on, once the likes of Bunk Gardner, Don Preston and Ian Underwood have joined the ranks of the Mothers (\\"We're Only in it...\\", \\"Uncle Meat\\", etc.), then things got to be REALLY interesting!
6304618344|4.0|Easily John Woo's most acclaimed Hollywood film to date, Face/Off is often mentioned among lists of the top action films of all-time.  But I can't say I agree, I didn't even think it was the best action film of 1997; that honor belongs to Wolfgang Petersen's nail-biter, Air Force One.  What Face/Off has going for it is an ingeniously silly premise and Woo's expert hand at crafting mayhem.  Both aspects work well enough to make this a fitfully enjoyable thrill ride, but never quite as satisfying as it should have been.<br />John Travolta stars as Sean Archer, an FBI agent whose son was killed by a terrorist named Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage).  After years of exhaustive search, Archer tracks down Troy and his brother, and captures both siblings after a violent shootout.  But his brother, Pollux, reveals that a bomb is set to detonate somewhere in Los Angeles, and the FBI have little clue as to the whereabouts of the explosives and when its set to go off.  <br />So one agent comes up with a wild idea, and shares it only with Archer and his partner.  It appears there's a secret laboratory that has enhanced technology capable of removing a person's face and placing it on another \\"patient.\\"  The plan is to place Archer uncercover secretly in prison as Castor, but everything goes wrong when Troy awakens from his coma and takes Archer's face and identity, and even his family life, leaving the real Archer stuck in prison. Knowing this isn't a prison drama, you can guess what's going to happen from there.<br />John Woo is an adept action director and his work in Face/Off is superb.  The action rolls at a breakneck pace, mostly with bloody shootouts, much of them employed in balletic slow motion, adding a graceful touch that somehow feels appropriate.  There are also exciting fights and even a pulse-pounding boat chase in the finale.  <br />Human drama is actually quite effective here, with Joan Allen giving us a solid and likable character who's caught in this whole mess, wondering who to trust and how to escape this nightmarish situation.  Nicolas Cage is just as good in creating a likable character in Archer, which is all the more amazing when you consider that he begins the film as a psychotic villain.  Even the sexy Gina Gershon brings humanity in a role as a protective, but crime-prone mother. Woo also plays on the whole good vs. evil concept, and it works just fine; there are the requisite doves and, uh, face/offs.  <br />With great action and characters, what's wrong with the movie?<br />Right off the top of my head, it's John Travolta that bugs me the most.  Not only is he an overrated actor, he doesn't make a particularly convincing action star.  Overweight as he was at the time, watching him perform so many flips and death-defying stunts (obviously done by stuntmen) is too difficult to believe, perhaps even moreso than the silly premise of this film itself!  And when the transformation occurs, Travolta's performance doesn't match what Nicolas Cage gave us in the opening.  Sure, he's equally off-the-wall and insane, but he's actually just giving us another rendition of his villain from Broken Arrow.<br />The opposite can be said for Nic Cage, who actually improves upon Travolta when he becomes Archer, displaying frantic emotions with more urgency and believability.  As an action star, he's more physically cut for this kind of stuff.  Watching Cage perform balletic flips and outrageous stunts provokes an adrenaline rush, rather than an unintentional laugh.  <br />The whole concept behind the movie is highly improbable, and the film manages to make it seem even more unlikely!  As far as dramatic intentions go, the premise works, particularly in a scene where Cage as Archer tries to convince Allen that he's her husband and another scene where Archer's daughter holds a gun toward both men, not knowing who to shoot.   <br />But, man, this story is filled with plot holes.  The most noticeable right off the bat is the FBI agent whose ear is shot off in the opening gunfight.  When Travolta visits the lab, he sees the scientists and technicians rebuilding this man a new ear.  As stated before, this lab is meant to be secret to even the FBI, so how the hell would this agent explain to his co-workers how he got this new ear?  Castor (when played by Cage) is a fairly thin man.  Archer (when played by Travolta) is a fairly chubby guy.  I'd like to know how these scientists made the relatively thin Castor into a chubby guy.  Whose idea was it to keep this whole undercover plan secret to the FBI?  Sure, I see the need to keep it from leaking to the prisoners, but shouldn't at least the head of the FBI be aware of what's going on, so just in case the unthinkable happens, they'll know how to deal with it.  For that matter, how can such a laboratory, full of the latest in high-tech equipment AND holding the world's most dangerous terrorist, be left with absolutely no guards at night?  And why the heck did Nick Cassavetes kiss Gina Gershon (who plays Cassavetes' sister) full on the lips from just out of left field (okay, I realize he was a thug and was dying, but how many people do you know would give such a sleazy kiss to their sister as a farewell?).  <br />With so many infuriating plot holes, Face/Off annoys almost as often as it thrills.  Admittedly, I had a higher opinion of it before repeat viewings, but the best action films still hold up in spite of implausibilities (Indiana Jones, Speed, Air Force One, The Mummy) because they possess a certain magic that keeps them above the rest of the crop.  Face/Off has style to burn and action that gets more exciting as it moves along, but by the end, I just didn't feel that much-needed movie magic that would have attained this masterpiece status.
B000002U9Y|5.0|Just as &#34;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&#34; is easy to overrate and underappreciate on its own terms, because of the outsize talent and tragedy of Syd Barrett, Pink Floyd's second album is easy to write off as a meandering set by a band who can't see themselves getting beyond their in-house calamity - or who can't even hope to compete with both the talent and the tragedy that stole it. And that's completely unfair because, given especially the complications that surrounded its making, this is a magnificent album.  It's a little more tricksy to accept &#34;A Saucerful of Secrets&#34; on its own terms, one admits, because Barrett is still a lingering and troubling presence. Of course, he isn't entirely removed from his membership in the band, but he's limited to what little he can handle; he's no longer the prime songwriter (there's only one Barrett composition on the album), and he can offer only an occasional vocal and a few guitar turns. But he and they make it work regardless.  Barrett takes the alternate vocal lead (new guitarist David Gilmour begins establishing himself as the new prime voice of the Floyd, and just so) for the kickoff track, the shimmering &#34;Let There Be More Light,&#34; and in fact plays the surprisingly smooth guitar solo that rides out the track (surprising when you recall Barrett's earlier and trademark spiky guitar style, as though he were emulating the clean, less-is-more style Gilmour would soon make his trademark.) Barrett also sings the short bridge lines (&#34;Why can't we break today&#34;) for Rick Wright's pleasant, rumble-rhythmed &#34;Remember A Day&#34; and squirts a few spiky high-tone slide guitar lines. And if it wasn't for Roger Waters' songwriting credit, you'd swear &#34;Corporal Clegg&#34; was a &#34;Piper&#34; leftover - it's one of Barrett's two lead vocals on the album, the guitar work is unmistakeably Barrett's, and the whackiness of the song would have fit reasonably within either &#34;Piper&#34; or as a B-sideto a &#34;Piper&#34;-extracted single. In between, though, is Waters's &#34;Set The Controls For The Heart of The Sun,&#34; which would become a concert tour-de-force soon enough and deservedly so - the blues-extracted thematic riff (played on his low strings by Gilmour) is a gripper from its first measure, the lyric (practically whispered by Waters) is beguiling, and the floating improvised sound washes in the middle (notice Gilmour's subtle, spare vibraphone tones throughout) drop hints that the title track wold soon enough deliver.  For &#34;A Saucerful of Secrets&#34; (album and title track, which track was actually &#34;Saucer Full of Secrets Suite&#34;) is the Pink Floyd that the world would become accustomed soon enough - the sonorous,  pure sound block, experimentation and improvisation in  the first two of three segments (Nick Mason's hypnotic drum rhythm drives the second of the three), as Waters, Gilmour, and organist Rick Wright wring sheet after sheet of ethereal squall, drone and wash with nothing more than some well-timed, well-frictioned tweaks and applications to bass, guitar, and keyboard. (The Floyd purists have a point when they say that they didn't need synthesisers to produce dimension-jumping &#34;space rock,&#34; as they added in years to come, beginning with &#34;Obscured By Clouds&#34; - this is astonishing sound work just from ordinary electric instruments.) The &#34;Saucerful&#34; finale, of course, is a gripping pipe organ progression, joined in the final two soundings by a surging vocalising chorus; the entire 11-minute suite pretty much lays the blueprint for Pink Floyd's soon-to-be-familiar dreamscape rock that who knows how many would try to approximate and fall flat on their faces doing so.  You go from there to the prettiest composition Rick Wright ever yielded up for a Pink Floyd album, &#34;See-Saw,&#34; with a rocking waltz of phasing keyboards and acoustic guitars, David Gilmour's whispery singing, Waters laying across a gentle bass sway, and Mason drumming as sensitively as anyone in rock at the time was doing. If there's a better return to this world from the extraterrestrial extension that was &#34;Saucerful's&#34; title track than this, I would be hard pressed to identify it.  But then you conclude with &#34;Jugband Blues,&#34; the Barrett composition that ends his Pink Floyd association so jarringly. (You don't need me to tell you this is neither jugband music nor blues, do you?) It serves more to suggest what his solo career might have been (it takes great charity to call his three solo albums valuable to anyone but the most stubborn Barrett completist; with few exceptions, the dissembling incoherence of the delivery renders them unlistenable) if he hadn't gone so far beyond the edge that he left more than shards if anything of his once-formidable talent. As the one last certain emission Barrett had left to deliver, and with his soon-to-be-former Floyd bandmates giving him sympathetic support, &#34;Jugband Blues&#34; is Barrett's sad epitaph, right down to the haunting verse that closes the song, over the isolated acoustic guitar Barrett strums almost as an implied instrument: &#34;And the sea isn't green/and I love the Queen/and what exactly is a dream?/what exactly is a joke?&#34;.  What you have, in other words, is an album born of a patient's rise from its unexpected sickbed and finding something different to say with an enrapturing way to say it, mostly. On those terms, &#34;A Saucerful of Secrets&#34; remains an aesthetic success. (Considering their original foolhardy idea - the band had actually pondered retaining Barrett to compose songs but otherwise not tour or record with them, until the depth of his plunge became too much to allow even that option - the album as it is is even more impressive.) It shouldn't have to be battered over its own head with continuing comparisons to &#34;The Piper At The Gates of Dawn&#34; - there is nothing but good music on this set and enoughof it is great music in its own right. And even if Pink Floyd couldn't go very long from there without referring back to the fall of its original leader, that they did so at all considering how they lost their first fulcrum testifies to something indomitable.

In this book, he pulls  together information that the mathematics of holography is the (or at least a) basis for the organization of quantum probability fields.

0920668364|1.0|Probably the worst book for children I've ever read.<BR>I always look at a book with an open mind, but I just can't ignore the fact - this book is horrible. It is the story of a compulsive, obsessive woman in need of some serious psychiatric help. Clothed as a sappy children's story, it is about a woman who tells her child repeatedly how much she loves him, and forever, over and over again, instead of showing him with loving actions. As he grows up, she still rocks him to sleep as if he is a baby. What teenager would let his mother SNEAK into his room at night to rock him to sleep? Well, it doesn't end there, because after he moves on, and gets married and has children of his own, she sneaks into his house while everyone is asleep, crawls across the floor, and pulls him out of bed to rock him to sleep! To prove she loves him? Is this what love is? Is this what you want your children to think love is? A healthy loving mother grows with the child to build a new adult relationship with her child, as friend, mentor and parent. Her son in the end perpetuates this behavior with his own child, showing the only redeeming value of this book - demonstrating how sick behavior is passed on from one generation to the next. This story is totally inappropriate for children...as is most of Robert Munich's other books..
B0000640VO|5.0|This film merits five stars. Altruism is the vacuum which nature abhors in human relationships; the title character confronts this dilemma with imagination and great sense of humor. At first glance, it may appear that the director has approached the interior struggles of Amelie with very broad strokes, based upon the title character's overt actions. However, the director is working on many levels and with exquisite subtlty. This gem of a movie slips messages to the viewer on many levels via the vehicle of the title character's apparently outrageous reactions to her emotional environment.<br />Imagination is the ever-present unseen character of the piece. Unlike David Lynch, who tends to overwork some metaphors, this director's approach, while nonlinear, is nevertheless sublimely coherent in its depth of layers. The character of Amelie is engaged in a struggle to nourish her soul, while at the same time acknowledging the reality that altruism is the vacuum nature abhors in human interactions. This awareness presents challenges to Amelie in her dealings with others and also with herself.<br />Like the title character, the director manages this internal conflict with superb imagination and a great sense of humor. This is the story of a series of small truimphs and setbacks building to the resolution of Amelie's inerior struggle. While the journey is a wild ride that does not appeal to all tastes, the resolution is a powerful argument for life, individuality and resistance to templates imposed by society.<br />Amelie is a deeply meaningful, humorous, feel-good movie. The outlandish elements employed are artfully used to provide the resolution of Amelie's emotional pain resulting from the clash of her altruistic nature with the realities of the world crashing down around her. Any attempt to &quot;tone down&quot; these outlandish elements would have resulted in not giving Amelie's great heart and imagination the voice they deserve in proportion to the voice of the unrelenting realities of the outside world.<br />Amelie is the purr of the Cheshire Cat. See Amelie to reconnect with that &quot;inner child&quot; we hear so much about. See Amelie to give your imagination muscle a workout. Amelie is a stunning affirmation of the proactive approach in embracing life!

0780623703|5.0|This movie was by far not what i expected. It is both romantic as well as dramatic. This film clearly demonstrates the journey of discovering your inner self. When david and jennifer are trasported into pleasentville, they discover the innocence and purity of the people, these people have lead perfect lives and never experienced the world as we know it. David and Jennifer are transformed into Bud and Mary-Sue the characters from pleasentville. Throughout a series of mistakes they cause the people of pleasentville to discover what life is and how they can experience life from a hole new perspective. This is by far one of the best movies i've seen in my life, it not only teaches us more about exploring life, it makes us look twice at how genuinly wonderful experiencing life is.<BR>For those who confuse this with the film taking off 1950's life obviously didn't what the movie with the same innocence as margaret, chip, peggy-jane, mr johnson, and betty &amp; george.<BR>my advice is watch it again and don't be so critical. This movie is a classic and should be watched throughout the ages.
B00005JKED|4.0|This is a really energetic and entertaining movie with great acting on all levels, but particularly Denzel &amp; Ethan. Denzel's character is so bad he is fun to watch. You can see the wheels turning in his mind as he manipulates everybody as he moves through his life. Ethan Hawke's emotions are played across his face as he is tortured throughout his first day on the job from hell. He deftly portrays the guy who has a good heart and is trying to do what's right while surrounded by baaaaad people. The scenes at Smiley's house are awesome: INTENSE and worth the price of admission! I would give this five stars, but there are a few minor flaws. I liked the character of Jake so much I would like to see &quot;Training Day II:Back to the Valley&quot; who knows? The commentary track on the DVD is interesting to listen to after you see the film. I liked getting an inside glimpse of life on the mean streets.
0385720920|1.0|Choke is, to put it mildly, a terrible book. The subject matter, while described on the cover as \\"gritty\\" and \\"intense\\", is actually just a feeble attempt to shock and \\"push the limits\\", whatever those limits may be.<br />The novel reads like a reassembled 'Fight Club', with the main character frequenting sex addiction meetings, in order to get sex, very similar to Tyler and Marla's fondness for counselling sessions in 'Fight Club'. The style, while definitely unique and ever-present, is not particularly GOOD. The voice speaks in a staccato, hard-bolied interior monologue that simply describes events in the loosest terms possible, glossing over major plot points as though they were incidental.<br />In the most artless display of Palahniuk's inanity, he fumbles not one, but two major \\"plot twists\\". 1) The narrator's discovery that he could be Jesus is mishandled from the start, and 2) the realization that his nurse is actually a patient is apparent from her first scene. How did this thing sell!? Was it simply based on the success of the movie 'Fight Club?'<br />'Choke' is a poorly-written book without any redeeming features. No one should read it, save for English Students trying to understand truly awful novels that sell. This is not my opinion, this is a fact.

B00005QIPH|4.0|The Strokes are basically the Velvet Underground as a punk-pop band. Yes they aren't original at all, but that doesn't make their songs any less catchy. This music isn't going to change the world, or even the future of rock music. But it's fun to listen to and it's alot better than all those other garage bands with Roman Coppola videos and the White Stripes; because it's not annoyingly amateurish  like all those bands are.

B00003CX5P|5.0|Star Wars episode 1 is in my oppinion extremely underrated.  I think that this one is better than episode 4 because well, the new trilogy isn't all about action, there is more romance, drama, and the story is much better than atleast ep. 4.  Infact this was my favorite SW movie(aside from Jedi)because this has much more chracters and plot than the first one.  The story revolves around the start of the intergalactic war when Naboo gets invaded.  When the Jedis Obi Wan Kenobi and Qui Gon Jin go in to settle the conflict it nearly starts war.  After that fails they go to Naboo where battles are raging, there they meet Gungan Jar Jar binks.  From there the movie starts getting better and beter.  This movie tells about the characters of the original and how they got to what they are now.  Now you know how Anakin got to the darkside.  The originals actually make alot more sense.  i am not saying that I don't like the originals(Return of the Jedi was my favorite movie of all time actually.  The special effects are mezmorizing and just add to the fun of this amazing series.  I dissagree harshley with most of the other posters.  <br />  The DVD quality of this set is great.  it is loaded with special features, more than any other DVD.  The special features include, exclusive deleted Scenes Documentary features seven new sequences completed exclusively for this DVD including extended Podrace scenes.  All new hour long documentary film culled from over 600 hours of footage, The beggining takes you where few people have been before-inside Lucasfilm and ILM during the production of episode 1.  Multi-Angle storyboard-to-animatic-to-film segment featuring the Submarine and Podrace Lap 1 sequences.  Five Featurettes explore the phantom Menace's storyline, design, costumes, visual effects and fight scenes.  Award Winning twelve-part web documentary series that chronicles the production of Episode 1.  Duel of the Fates music video featuring John Williams.  never Before seen Production Photo Gallery with special caption feature.  Theatrical posters and print campaigns from around the wold.  Theatrical teaser and launch trailers, plus seven TV spots.  Star Wars: Star Fighter the making of a game, featurette from Lucas Arts.  DVD-ROM weblink to exclusive Star Wars content.  That is an amazing amount of special features.  A great example of what a DVD can do.<br />  This DVD also includes on the first disc: Comentary by George Lucas, Rick Mcallum, Ben Burtt, Rob Coleman, John Knoll, Denis Muren, and Scott Squires.

B0000089FS|5.0|I bought this CD for &quot;A Word in Spanish,&quot; which I really like.  I listened to the CD in the car while driving and heard about half of it and thought it was average with a couple of good songs.  Then I listened again on my computer with my Klipsch 4.1's.  Wow, some of this stuff is pretty good!  So I put it on the big system with the Klipsch towers and cranked up the bass and the volume.  Incredible!  The Shep Pettibone remix of &quot;I don't wanna go on with you like that,&quot; is worth the price of the album and more.  Everything else is &quot;added value.&quot;  &quot;Heavy Traffic&quot; is a great rock tune. Freddie Hubbard's flugelhorn in &quot;Mad Hatters&quot; is a thrill and a half!  And then there's Carl Wilson singing background on &quot;Since God Created Girls.&quot;  Outstanding!  If you only listened once, listen again!  And more closely.  This is rapidly becoming my favorite Elton John album.  And yes, there are a few songs on it I don't care for,  but that's true of most albums.  Oh, and lest I forget, Elton John is pretty good too. (Just kidding, he is awesome as usual!)
0064407667|4.0|The Bad beginning is a great book.  It is(obviously) about unlucky kids.  They are orphans because their parents get killed in a fire.  They stay with their parents friend mr. Poe until they find a family member that they can stay with, and the family member is...Count Olaf Ahhhhhh!  he ends up being he big villain of the series.  Unlike the other reviewers I think that the chracters are quite well done in these noveels.Lemony Sniket ( the pen name of Daniel Handler) does a great job as a writer in the stories, and it is written in my favorite form, third person.  So far there are eight novels in the series and another scheduled for this October.  So I would reccomend this series of books for ages 8 and over, and for children who enjoy suspense....... Grade A<br />  Goodbye<br /> ~~~~~~~~~~Dan~~~~
B000002MP2|3.0|This is a fun album full of short witty pop-punk songs. With angsty lyrics, powerhouse bass playing, and good songwriting, the album is good. My main complaint is that a thousand imitators have followed, churning out one indistinguishable pop-punk song after another. Still, you can't blame Green Day for putting out a good album.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Monsters Inc. is a great movie.  It is about two monsters who work for monsters inc.  The partners are Mike(Billy Chrystal) and Sully(John Goodman).  They live in Montropolis in the monster world.  The monsters are actually scared of kids, and the monster worlds power source is children's screams.  That's what Monsters Inc. is for.  They go into kid's bedrooms through their closet doors, and try to scare the children to get screams.  Mike and Sully ae best friends, Sully is the top monster for monsters Inc(he got the most screams.  When Mike and Sully go into a young lady's house, she follows the monsters to the monster world.  It is extremely funny and cute.  The CG animation is beautiful.  Pixar did a wonderful job in their 4th feature film.  This is the first good disney movie in two years.  The movie won't scare children, the monsters won't scare your children at all they're cute actually.  The parent will love it also.  The story is great and not hard to understaand at all.  This is a two DVD set though which means it has another disc full of goodies...
B000000OQF|5.0|GnR was the first post hair metal heavy metal band (even though Axel has good hair) because of their attitude and no-holds-barred music.  The songs are great, the guitar playing is ideal -- Slash's virtuosity (well, pentatonic virtuosity) contrasts well with Izzy's sloppy playing.  Axel's lyrics feed the fantasies of every suburban teenager, and the drumming is actually pretty sloppy too.  Excellent excellent album... must-have for hard-rock fans.
B00006690G|5.0|This CD misses the perfection of \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\", but it sure comes close.  Em, the central producer, lays down a lot of innovative, sometimes rock-based, beats and tracks.  Then, of course, are the lyrics.  They are top-notch here, covering quite a few topics.  When will he stop?  Hopefully not until he dies, because I can't get enough of him.  Here are my ratings of all the different tracks.<BR>Curtains Up 7/10 Great introduction to the concept<BR>White America 9/10 Limp Bizkit, eat your heart out-this is real rap-metal!<BR>Business 9/10 Batman (Dr. Dre) lays down a phat track<BR>Cleanin Out My Closet 10/10 Perfect portrait of raw emotion<BR>Sqaure Dance 7/10 A little silly, and mediocre for Em, but still better than 90% of rappers out there<BR>The Kiss 9/10 Hilarious and a great pot-stirrer for the dumb critics<BR>Soldier 10/10 Relentlessly Pac-influenced and raw as Hell<BR>Say Goodbye Hollywood 6/10 Probably my least fav track on CD<BR>Drips 8/10 Nasty and raw, but the way Obie rhymes that disgusting stuff is ingenious<BR>Without Me 9/10 Got a little old, but still rocks the house<BR>Paul 9/10 Classic as usual<BR>Sing For the Moment 9/10 I usually get ... when classic rock gets sampled for hip-hop, but not on this track<BR>Superman 10/10 Awesome flow, great prechorus and chorus<BR>Hailie's Song 10/10 What a melody...so what if he can't sing?<BR>Steve Berman 7/10 He finally eats it<BR>When the Music Stops 8/10 D12-Proof and Swifty are still my favs after Em<BR>Say What You Say 7/10 Not nearly as good as it could've been<BR>Til I Collapse 9/10 Nate rips it up, Em truly masters his art<BR>My Dad's Gone Crazy 10/10 Hilarious, yet touchingly haunting, and amazing production by Dre<BR>Curtain Close 7/10 Ken is back...<br />Keep droppin em, EM!
B000063DI9|5.0|Iron Maiden's 1988 concept album SEVENTH SON OF A SEVENTH SON captures the metal legends at an artistic and commercial peak.  Maiden has always had progressive elements in their music, especially on the epic tracks like \\"Hallowed Be Thy Name\\" and \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner,\\" but by the time they released 7TH SON, they had become a full-blown progressive metal band.  Certainly one of the originators of the genre, I might say (along with Rush and Queensryche).<br />Don't worry - the band's galloping musical attack is still present, but Maiden is experimenting quite a bit with their trademark sound.  The band began using synthesizers rather lightly on their 1986 release SOMEWHERE IN TIME, but on this album the synths were more noticeable and there's even a couple of keyboards on there for good measure.  I can't understand why Maiden fans said the band \\"sold out\\" with the synths.  They didn't sell out.  In fact, they enhanced their sound with the lush synth textures, which I found to be very creative.  Also, this is the first Maiden album I've heard that has acoustic guitar in it.  There's even some bluesy guitar parts courtesy of Adrian Smith which gives greater feel to the album.<br />Like many concept albums, SEVENTH SON tells a story.  And what a compelling story it is!  The plot focuses on a young man who keeps having strange prophetic visions in his dreams.  It turns out that he was born with clairvoyant powers (a mix of psychic and healing powers) and has had them all his life.  Angels and demons are having a power struggle with his soul, not knowing which route he will take.  Apparently, the townspeople have known about his powers.  That's why they are frightened of him.  When he has a vision that the town will be destroyed by dark forces, he tries to warn them but they ignore his pleas.  Alas, the town is ruined and they automatically blame him for the disaster.  Feeling shunned by the people, the man decides to let them suffer with their sins and guilt and faces an eternity in Hell.  If that isn't deep enough for you, I don't know what is.<br />Here's a song-by-song overview:<br />1. \\"Moonchild\\" - A solid energetic opener that starts out with gentle acoustic strums and Bruce Dickinson singing in a relaxed tone before the keyboard riff comes in and the band is off and running.  Lots of attitude on this track.  You gotta love Bruce's evil laugh at the end!<br />2. \\"Infinite Dreams\\"-One of Maiden's best songs, this is the first track that combines the band's melodic metal sound with progressive stylings.  Brilliant lyrics from Steve Harris, great vocals from Bruce, and soaring guitar solos.  A perfect song.<br />3. \\"Can I Play with Madness?\\" - A lot of people seem to hate this track, but I like it.  Sure, it's commercial, but it's also very complex for a 3-minute song.  Reminds me of Rush's early '80s period.<br />4. \\"The Evil That Men Do\\"-Another solid rocker with prog. stylings.  Bruce's voice soars really high on this one, and the chorus is impossibly catchy.<br />5. \\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\\"-At 10 minutes, this is the epic of the album.  Musically, this is probably Maiden's most sophisticated and versatile song.  Great lyrics, a fantastic build-up, awesome synth inflections, and a wild instrumental section to close it out.  Dave Murray and Adrian Smith show why they are the greatest guitar duo in metal.<br />6. \\"The Prophecy\\" - A remarkably slower piece that gives you time to rest after the sprawl of \\"7th Son.\\"  The blues influence really shines on this one and the tricky time changes are absorbing.  The song ends with Murray doing a lovely, Jethro Tull-like acoustic solo.  Buy this album just to hear the solo alone!<br />7. \\"The Clairvoyant\\"-A speedy bass intro by Harris opens this one and a triumphant-sounding guitar riff follows.  Haunting melodies abound in this track.  Deep and meaningful.  The most melodic song on the album.  <br />8. \\"Only the Good Die Young\\" - Along with Dream Theater's \\"Finally Free\\" andTransatlantic's \\"Stranger in Your Soul,\\" this is one of the best grand finales ever recorded.  The fastest song on here, with insane musicianship and a powerful chorus.  It ends the way it begins.<br />Armed with an intriguing tale, excellent music, plentiful melody, and that distinctive Dickinson voice, SEVENTH SON OF A SEVENTH SON is truly an unforgettable experience.
6304077955|5.0|My husband introduced me to this movie while we first started dating.  It is his favourite movie.  I have only seen it a couple of times and each time a pick up a little bit more from this astonishing movie.  It leaves you thinking about many different things and haunts you for a long time . <br />The character of Sabashian was such a frightful and scary one, that I thought of him often.  I know that there was so much symbolism in this movie , especially with the two men at the end touching hands .  A lot of it went over my head , and it is one of those movies you have to see again and again to truely appreciate , but it is well worth it .<br />A wonderful masterpiece.  A must see .
0440237688|3.0|we read this book in 7th grade. it was an ok book, kind of odd in some places. I don't know, i just didn't really like the ending. but i have read much worse.
B00003CXXP|5.0|Even though I find this film a darker and more ominous version of either E.T. or Pinnochio, I still find it the most beautiful movie I have ever seen. I don't know why it didn't do so well in the theatres but this is a film that should be remembered for years to come. Spielberg has created a dark world of the future but to those who have good eyes can see the light (David). Now if you think about it real hard you know that David doesn't precisely know the difference between love and hate but never the less Osment's perforance is very heatwarming.
B00006690G|5.0|I've always been a fan of Eminem and \\"The Eminem Show\\" just increases my loyalty to him. It's a new take on Eminem, a side I don't think a lot of people want to know. Yes, it's still angry and bitter, but a lot of people feel that way, they (like me!) don't have the guts to say it. Although I don't feel it was as great as \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\", it's definately a step up and onward! Nice job, Em!
0385503954|4.0|This is a great story that revolves around a family with very interesting characters.  McEwan does a great job of developing the characters in his stories and quickly you feel like you know them thoroughly.  I've also read Enduring Love by McEwan and plan to read his other books.
B00006B1HH|5.0|As far as film musicals are concerned, nothing comes close to \\"Grease\\" in terms of appealing to a mass audience of all ages, races, and generations.  Though set in the fifties, \\"Grease\\" remains deeply entrenched in the seventies, as it defined that freewheeling decade's carefree attitude and innocence while drawing inspiration from the Elvis era.  Still the top-grossing movie musical of all time, \\"Grease\\" works as a coming-of-age film we can all relate to - it sings (great songs from the Broadway classic plus chart-topping classics from the Bee Gees and Olivia Newton-John's longtime collaborator, John Farrar), it dances (Rydel High's Gym Dance),  zips (\\"the chicks'll cream for Greased Lightning\\") and celebrates youth and friendship.  <br />Twenty five years after its first theatrical release, the movie still feels and sounds fresh even through its nostalgia, thanks to star-making performances from Travolta, Newton-John and Stockard Channing, to its clever wordplay and its irreverent look at high school - when everything and anything is possible.  It's a movie that gets better with repeat viewings, as audiences associate seeing it with a singular moment in time.  Cameo appearances from golden greats like Frankie Avalon (\\"Beauty School Dropout\\"), Sid Ceasar and Edd Byrnes are comic gems.  <br />The now-world-famous cast is hard to beat ... Didi Conn and Stockard Channing are excellent as Frenchy (THE beauty school dud) and Rizzo (the tough girl with a soft spot), while Eve Arden (Our Miss Brooks) gets the supporting role of a lifetime.  Dody Goodman as her daffy assistant is a hoot, but the film belongs to the music and the performances of its two principles.  Olivia Newton-John is a sublime choice for Sandy.  Though requiring re-tooling from the original stage show, her character's Aussie born lass is a perfect combination of girl-next-door sweetness and (later on) I-Am-Woman-hear-me-roar guts.  Perhaps no transformation has been so effectively cut in a movie as ONJ's good girl gone wild.  Besides setting off fashion trends and the lycra industry, Sandy's evolution reminds today's teens that you can be hip AND nice.  That's a testament to the singer-actress' presence in this film and her ongoing legend.  Travolta is also sublime as Danny, a mix of cocky swagger and silly-boy charm that's never malicious...just young.  His Danny plays both sides of the teen-angst fence, whether telling his version of \\"Summer Nights\\" to the boys, or sweetly professing his love for \\"Sandy\\" at the drive-in (drive-ins are set for a comeback if this DVD finds itself into everyone's home!)  After 25 years and countless viewings, Olivia and Travolta make beautiful music together!  <br />Guaranteed a winner in any home, \\"Grease\\" gets better with repeat viewings and remains accessible, fun and genuine.  As a backdrop for baby boomers' high school years and our memories of all thats happened since...\\"Grease\\" remains the word!  Thrilled to have this out on DVD!!!
B00005O5JV|5.0|Reese Witherspoon is hilarious and perfect in her role as a stylish, sorority girl dumb blonde who makes it into Harvard Law school in an attempt to win her boyfriend back. I love the premise of the movie, and there are laughs the whole way through.

B00005JKZT|5.0|I'm delighted that so many people are excited about the upcoming release of Two Towers. Being a fan of the books for more than 20 years, I can't wait for December to roll around, and hope that the films will encourage fans of the film to read the books.<br />To answer some of the questions I've seen in other reviews of the trailer for the movie, specifically, why isn't there more of Frodo, here is some basic info:<br />The Lord of the rings is actually one big book broken into 6 segments.  Each of the three books, Fellowship, Towers and Return, contain two of the six segments, but the story is one continuing narrative from the beginning of Fellowship to the end of Return.<br />With Towers, after the breaking of the fellowship, the story follows each of the characters.  The first part of Towers (the book) follows Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas as they hunt the orcs that captured Merry and Pippin, then follows them into the beginnig of the War of the Ring.  The second half follows Frodo and Sam as they make their way towards Mordor.<br />The same is true in Return, continuing the stories of each member of the original Fellowship, as well as new characters introduced along the way.<br />There will be plenty of Frodo, and plenty of all the others as well.<br />Towers is probably the most exciting part of the series, with the most action.  Return will be action packed as well, but Towers won't have to do a wrap up of the story as Return will, and it won't have to establish the main characters as Fellowship did, so it's likely to be the most exciting of the movies.<br />Bring on December!
B000069HKH|4.0|I won't say much, given that over 300 people have \\"reviewed\\" the disc. I found it interesting and inspiring that, if you sat someone down in a room who did not know about the events of Sept. 11 and played the disc for them, they would not be able to say, \\"That's about a horrific terrorist attack on the U.S.\\" Springsteen allows us to fill in the gaps with our own memories and remembrances, which is how it should be. He's not writing history here; he's painting a picture of loss and loneliness -- and the power (almost religious in nature) to rise above that loss and loneliness -- abstract enough to allow plenty of room for interpretation. The disc could apply to any conflict, any loss, anywhere. It's not a \\"pro-U.S.\\" anthem. Springsteen is to be lauded for this.<br />I would single out four songs as stellar: \\"Lonesome Day\\", \\"Nothing Man\\", \\"Into the Fire\\", and the title cut. Placed in the context of 9/11, they capture a full range of emotion. Taken out of context, they still manage to comfort and mourn at the same time. It's almost as if Springsteen has written a book of Psalms specifically for 9/11 -- or for any contemporary loss. Skip over the weaker songs (\\"Counting on a Miracle\\", for example) and buy it solely for the four songs I've mentioned here, and you will cry and be uplifted all at once. A much-needed statement about our present times.
B000069AUI|5.0|Probably one of the most hotly-anticipated albums of 2002, Coldplay's second LP is another fantastic soundscape. The music seems richer than on Parachutes - perhaps most notably so on the first UK single, \\"In My Place\\" where the guitar and harmonies around Chris' voice really lift the sound from the more piano-driven, stripped-down tracks of Parachutes.<br />The piano still plays a crucial part in the band's music, with tracks like \\"The Scientist\\" and \\"Clocks\\" being driven by insistent keystrokes. Overall the music seems much more refined and rounded - critics have frequently used the term 'confident'. Only \\"Green Eyes\\" comes over as a rehash of an old track (compare it with \\"Spies\\" from their first full album).<br />My personal favourite here is \\"Warning Sign\\" - a superb blend of jangling guitar, strings, and wonderful lyrics: when Chris sings '... when the truth is, I miss you' you cannot help but feel the emotion there.<br />No question, this is going to be one of my long-term favourites.
6303921248|5.0|If you like any form of Austen, this is a must-see! This movie is in a class of its own. It basically uses the book as a script, and the cast is PHENOMENAL! I have seen this movie countless times, and I have never been bored during all five hours of it. It's romantic, hilarious, and beautifully made; I can't recommend it enough.
B000067IW0|1.0|This is one of my favorite films of all time, and if must own it (yes, you must own it), DON'T get this edition -- get the Image Entertainment one (the other, more expensive edition).  It's worth the extra 10 or so dollars.  And let me tell you why:<br />1. The Image edition has the original film-stock color tinting, an important creative device and a big part of what makes this such a beautiful film (especially for its time), this version does not.<br />2. The Image edition is beautifully transfered from a very nice print of the film, you can see everything as it was intended to be seen.  I'm sure this is how the film looked when it was originally released.  This edition is a terrible transfer from an already terrible print.<br />3. The Image edition has better music.<br />4. The Image edition has better intertitles.<br />5. The Image edition has an aditional audio commentary.<br />To sum it up, the Image edition isn't a piece of garbage, and it does this masterpiece justice.  Don't waste your time with this edition.  Sell your shoes if you can't afford the extra scratch, watching this DVD is painful.  Trust me.
0380973650|3.0|After discovering that this book won the Hugo this year, I picked it up.  Although the book is readable, it is not remarkable.  I found myself thinking among the overt and covert references to literary texts and authors how much better it would be to re-reading Vineland (Pynchon) or Mr. Bloodmoney (Dick).  I also found myself thinking of a statement made by one of Asimov's characters in the (early) Foundation Series about how it wasn't necessary to develop original material when you could mine the classical authors.<br />The atmosphere and motif of the story immediately reminded me of Night Watch by Sean Stewart, a much more evocative and compelling work if not quite attempting the same level of commentary.  There were obvious nods all around to other authors including Delaney and Zelazny.  I'm not going to read it again to pick up on any more.<br />This isn't really intended as an complete indictment of Mr. Gaiman or his novel - I just expect more from a Hugo winner.
0060977264|1.0|Review of River Piedra<br /> If you leave your responsibilities behind, run off to the mountains and have a series of semi-mystical experiences involving wine, fog, and charismatic religious experiences (resembling Woodstock/which provide no apparent value to anyone) then your childhood dreams will come true. The author has used a \\"cleverly\\" deceptive title to mask the inevitable happy ending. In this case Paul Coelho is a big phoney who pretends to write inspirational novels.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This is a great movie. The animation is great and the story line is well thought out and I just plain liked it.
B000002UJQ|5.0|With the release of The Bends, you'd know that Radiohead were going to release a good album, but didn't know it would sound like this probably. This album isn't as catchy or accessible, but those who appreciate full concept albums will love this one. It's only a little better than The Bends, but because The Bends is so hard to excel. That's where you can tell that Radiohead are not a usual band.<BR>I can understand where you wouldn't like it though. If you are a top-forty listener who likes what's catchy, I hope you hate it or stay away from it (unless it does change what you think). OK Computer is the type of album that is for those who will allow albums to grow on people.<br />Opener \\"Airbag\\" is over four and a half minutes, and has some of the coolest things done with it. The guitars are beautiful, the drums are interesting toward the end, and so on. The only downpoint is that the mixture of mumbly and whiny vocals makes it harder to understand, but I look in the booklet anyways.<br />\\"Paranoid Android\\" is now my personal all-time favorite song. You get over six minutes of a song that won't bore you because it won't keep the same sound as before. For instance, I love the second half a lot. Especially the way the song goes from its heavy part to a relaxed acoustic part, which is excellent for awhile, and I also like when the acoustic guitars go fast before getting heavy again at the end and the guitars being weirder at that part.<BR>\\"Subterranean Homesick Alien\\" is ALSO beautiful. I love the guitars on this one as well. I like the line \\"I'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me/they'd think that I finally lost it completely...\\" about being an alien. It's laid back and it's still solid.<BR>Oh yeah, you get to another song which will change within time. \\"Exit Music (For A Film)\\" has acoustic guitar, with Thom quietly singing, in it, then there's the part when Phil starts with the drums and the song starts changing on the guitars, when they get a lot more interesting. I love the atmosphere on this one. Maybe because the idea was from a Beatles song.<BR>\\"Let Down\\" is excellent as well. It has influenced songs I like such as Remy Zero's \\"Prophecy\\", and has a good melody, and it being laid back rather than too whiny or anything of the like is what also makes me like it. The guitars once again are epic.<BR>\\"Karma Police\\" was overrated, but it's equally good as the other five maybe. The pianos are taken from a White Album song by the Beatles. I like the ending guitars though, because they are interesting. Then you get \\"Fitter Happier\\" after that, a voice of AppleTalk for nearly two minutes. Then...<BR>You get \\"Electioneering\\" a classic Radiohead tune. The guitars are flawless on here. This is one of the more catchy tunes here, though a little weird. The falsetto is excellent.<BR>\\"Climbing Up The Walls\\" is the darkest-sounding of the songs on here. It's very interesting. I love the part after the trumpet arrangement or whatever that follows to a real cool guitar line. Then later you get to a scream which seems to be the climax, because in the next 40 seconds the song sort of rests.<BR>\\"No Surprises\\" is beautiful as well. It's the most mellow of the songs on OK Computer, and is a good chillout tune, though maybe not the best here.<BR>\\"Lucky\\" is my second favorite on this album. It's melodic, has some sort of weird guitars, and is very memorable. I think this was on a UK compilation before being on OKC, but it deserved to be here.<BR>Just after a plane crashed on the last song, you get one saying \\"slow down\\", which is ironically the final song here, \\"The Tourist\\". This song has a very interesting ending which seems to have a ding noise, and is very falsetto-laden kind of like OK Computer.<br />This album is equally good to The Bends probably, and a little better than 2000's Kid A which is better than Amnesiac. If you like music which is creative and reminds you of U2, the Alan Parsons Project, Pink Floyd, and The Beatles, youshould check out OK Computer, which is reasonably listed as an ...essential.
B00003RQNJ|5.0|Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is one of the greatest movies to ever come out in 1969. The pairing of Newman and Redford as Butch and Sundance was outstanding. It would have been great if they could have teamed together in more than just two motion pictures, but hey, we should rejoice that we have this entertainment gem to enjoy.    Along with the superb acting, the creative screenwriting made this production a masterpiece. Though it is presented in the introduction as a story that is \\"mostly true\\", Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is perhaps remembered best for its elements of sarcastic humor that really set the overall tone of the movie, such as the dialogue that occurred as one partner became exasperated by the outcome of the decisions made by the other.     For instance, Butch talks Sundance into leaving the U.S. with him and their female compadre, Etta, so that they can finally arrive to a living paradise called Bolivia, only to discover that as soon as they get off the train after reaching their destination, this so-called Garden of Eden looks more like Hell on Earth. Sundance is immediately irate and any words that Butch and Etta try to use to calm him down are responded to with insults and condemnations. Throughout the movie, it almost seems as if you have Alias Smith and Jones meets the Three Stooges.    Though they are supposedly the villains, the characters of Butch and Sundance have so many intermittent moments of hilarity that one cannot help but find them to be very likable.      So far as any other comments are concerned, the music from the soundtrack is nicely mixed in, especially the standout Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head. Kudos also to Katharine Ross for her ..., endearing portrayal of Etta.    Included in this DVD are behind the scenes footage of the making of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and separate 1994 interviews with Newman, Redford, and Ross that focused on their perspectives of the movie twenty-five years after its release.
6304082428|5.0|As a loyal Jane Austen fan, I barely decided to watch the A&amp;E-televised &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; (the novel was butchered in the Olivier/Garson movie) - but, I've now watched it over and over and can't say enough about it.  Every character, with the exception of, perhaps, Charlotte Lucas, is exactly what one should expect from such a well-done production.  Please, please - do &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot;, still my Austen favorite!
0780626966|5.0|Grimy hands, worktools, an old rag torn to shreds, a girl in a nightdress and.....a bleating lamb??? Cue an audience in 1984 going berserk. Welcome Freddy Krueger, we've been expecting you.<BR>Anyway you cut (or gut it if you prefer), A Nightmare on Elm Street is one of the most influential horror movies ever made. Wes Craven's nasty little shocker about evil personified weaves under the skin in an altogether far too realistic way, a feeling that is not entirely unpleasant. Eighties horror was basically piggy backed by the gleeful demon in the red and green sweater, look away Michael Myers and Jason Voorhees, back in the closet Chucky, stay in the shed Leatherface, sorry your trip from hell was wasted Pinhead. You guys are cool but you're simply not imaginative enough. Freddy would be ashamed of his stumbling slow witted contemporaries. Of course the original is by far and away the most impressive installment in the series, but what of the others? Freddy's Revenge suffered simply due to the fact that the film makers didn't have a clue where to take Freddy yet, lay responsibility in that Wes Craven was no longer involved, and therefore broke every rule estabilished in the previous film. It's only saving grace is the highly under rated performance by the startling Mark Patton. The Dream Warriors is quite simply stunning, the deaths are inventive, the characterisation and performances strong throughout and Freddy finally stepped from the shadows, eliciting screams and laughter in equal measure, a tradition picked up and embraced by the visually impressive Dream Master. The less said about The Dream Child the better, turning Freddy into a slapstick cartoon character, thereby destroying his menace and foreboding presence onscreen. And I swear to god, if I ever meet Rachael Talalay (director of the puerile Freddy's Dead), she'll truly understand what it's like to meet Freddy's glove. Ahem, sorry about that, just upsets me is all how someone so closely involved with the series from the get go can make such a Comedy Central impression of a Nightmare film. Craven came back to put the wrong things right in New Nightmare which he succeeded in doing with a cleverly scripted 'real life' drama, displaying once again his versatility, and rounding off the boxset in style. All in all, a wicked and (for the most part) enjoyable little jog around Elm Street is on offer for anyone wanting to check out the right way to off a teenager. One last thing of note, as Jason Vs Freddy nears production, please remember that Freddy is a disgusting and perverted child abuser and that is what makes him such a truly terrifying creation. Bring him back to something approaching his demeanor from Nightmare One rather than rehash his ill advised James Bond bad guy suave previous incarnations.<BR>Sweet dreams Miss Talalay.
B00006FXB6|3.0|There has been a lot of talk about Songs For the Deaf by QOTSA - a lot of big talk, a lot of hyperbolistic sensationalism. Many would tell you that SFTD song titles 'The Sky Is Fallin' and 'God Is In The Radio' are unintentionally prophetic and that finally, at long last, your musical revolution has arrived and that Dave Grohl is still its drummer.<br />Now before you pick up this disc expecting the second coming, Songs For the Deaf will not align the planets or even balance your checkbook. That said, it is likely to reunite you with a lost love.<br />With Songs For the Deaf, QOTSA have improved drastically from Y2K's Rated R. The same sense of vocal harmony exists with the guitars but, thanks in large part to the aforementioned Grohl, the band is much tighter. This is best exemplified by opening single, 'No One Knows'. On the track Grohl's snare jumps out the speaker and the band follows with a low end riff that make the song among the catchiest of the year. Queens of the Stone Age are a machine.<br />The songwriting is much improved as well. Josh Homme and Nick Olivari depended more on gimmickry on Rated R, but here every song succeeds being equally fresh and traditional and there is an enduring quality that reveals itself after the first several playings.<br />It is easy to understand how rock diehards might confuse this as revelutionary. It plays closely with their hopes with its compressed production values (similar to 70's radio) and tacky mock DJs ridiculing 'commercial music'. Songs For The Deaf is a very enjoyable rock record, and those have become more scarce of late. Let it reunite you with that lost love and do balance your checkbook by yourself.
B00005T5YK|5.0|Hotel California is arguably the best album of all time from the Eagles. Some might say that it is the greatest album of all time, period, though I would not go quite that far. Nevertheless, I will prize this release as my very first audio DVD, just as I have prized The Police's Ghost in the Machine as my very first CD, which I purchased back in late 1985.<br />The sound quality on the Hotel California DVD is quite superb. Through my DVD player, I played the CD version of the song Hotel California from the Eagles' second volume of greatest hits and compared it with the DVD version. It turns out that there is no comparison, whatsoever. The DVD audio is just simply a distant winner.<br />Special care was taken in the production. Included is a videotaped interview with Bill Szymczyk, who described in full detail the care that was taken in the mixing of the master tapes and how he wisely decided to call on the services of the most highly sought-after experts on both recording technology and sound quality.<br />If you ever take the time to listen, you will be delighted by the advanced resolution in the sound quality and how the vocals and instrumentations are simultaneously separated and reverberated throughout the six channels. In terms of awesome sound quality, Victim of Love never sounded so good. As a plus, if you prefer DTS 5.1 or if you opt for Dolby Digital, both options, where you can choose either one, are contained in this disc for your listening enjoyment.
B00003CXXP|5.0|As a guy came to Japan as a government scholar, the scene where the 'mom' left David, it started. I started to question myself -- What is the reason for living alone apart from my family which loves me to the possible extend -- especially my dear mom.<br />The movie went on.....<br />Tears really came over when David started to beg the blue fairy to change him into a real boy -- to be really loved.<br />I was in a flood of tears when aliens were surfing and everything where destroyed.<br />I realized our life in this universe is short and we should be making our best efforts to make ourselves happy and be a light -- making others feel their best as well.<br />The movie not only shows, but rolled down my own thinking and helped me to understand the reason for existing. Unlike David, I am already a human. David's dream day is possible without so much of pain. It is the greatest pleasure that I am loved by my mom so deeply. She will love me regardless of what ever I am or whatever I do. It does not mean that being loved and leaving my mom alone sadly is a wise idea. The real happiness is, being loved and loving in turn. I imagine myself as a star in the sky, who cannot shine without the others shine.<br />I am thankful for that movie.
B00006AW2O|5.0|12x5 is the first great Rolling Stones record. Their first two releases showed the band's potential, but they realized it on this manic collection that finds them perfecting the Chess Records, Chicago R&B sound that so heavily influenced. From the opening riff of their ripping version of Chuck Berry's \\"Around & Around\\" to their magnificent version of \\"Susie Q\\", the band is on top of their game. Their versions of \\"Time Is On My Side\\", originally done by the great Irma Thomas, and Bobby Womack's \\"It's All Over Now\\" have become Stones classics, while lesser known tracks like \\"Empty Heart\\", which has some ripping guitar riffs, \\"Confessin' The Blues\\" and \\"Good Times, Bad Times\\" stand right up next to them. The band pays tribute to Chess Records with the instrumental \\"2120 South Michigan Avenue\\". 12x5 solidified the foundation for their now almost 40 year career.
0553108034|5.0|A friend of mine suggested I pickup George RR Martin during a &quot;downtime&quot; of reading.  Boy, what a great suggestion!  The first book in the series, The Game of Thrones, was excellent.  <br />As is my wont, that tends to make me a little suspicious. After all, with such a high level having been set by the predecessor, it's very difficult to maintain the level of excellence.<br />My fears quickly abated, though, as I delved into this book.  <br />It is darker book than book1-- perhaps because, after the success of book 1, GRRM decided to expand the series?  No rousing finish here.  Instead, the book grimly, stupendously, marches onward hewing characters (*mostly* minor in this tome) as timber.  <br />In the process, &quot;major&quot; characters are fleshed out giving life and breadth and breath to their motions, intuitions and actions. Cersei becomes less wooden, Catelyn more human, Sansa less &quot;doll&quot;-like, Arya more rogue-ish (and the perspective GRRM obtains in writing as a &quot;10yr old&quot; is excellent).  Jon?  Tyrion? The best....<br />Bottom Line?  An excellent edition in an excellent series.  Wonderful.
B00005RG6M|5.0|If I am not mistaken, Paul McCartney once remarked that lavish is vulgar, and if he did, I am sure that he made a few exceptions, one of which would be this 1975 classic with its lavish production and all.<br />On audio DVD, A Night at the Opera sounds so clear, so great. It's as if you can hear the chart hits You're My Best Friend and Bohemian Rhapsody for the first time, all over again. Though the rest of the tracks are not remotely as familiar to the casual fan, such as myself, they are nicely arranged and mixed in to help compile what is regarded as Queen's greatest release.<br />Included are song lyrics displayed on the television screen as the tracks proceed from one to the next and the video of Bohemian Rhapsody, where the sound quality is not quite so stellar as the strictly DVD audio-only version. <br />A musical triumph, A Night at the Opera on audio DVD rekindles and revisits the passion and the grandeur of great musicians and vocalists who would do what it took to get to the top of their game, even if it meant occasionally going over the top.
B00004SCS1|5.0|This allbum is so ... good, its a new band that gonna break through, i recomend this cd for all music freaks!
B00006AW2M|4.0|The much maligned Their Satanic Majesties Request is The Rolling Stones obvious response to The Beatles Sgt. Pepper's album. The band dived headfirst into the psychedelic sounds of 1967's Summer of Love and the album sounds like no other in their catalog. Despite the criticism and attempt to keep pace with the Beatles (including the original 3-D cover), the album contains some excellent songs. The album opens up strong with the overture &quot;Sing This All Together&quot; with it's horns and sound effects and then slides right into the grinding guitar of &quot;The Citadel&quot;. Bill Wyman's only lead vocal on a Stone's album is &quot;In Another Land&quot; and upon listening to it you can hear why it was his first and last. He has a tremendously thin voice and he makes Ringo Starr sound like Pavarotti. &quot;2000 Man&quot; is fast-paced and along with &quot;2000 Light Years From Home&quot; are the best songs on the album. The reprise of &quot;Sing This All Together&quot; is a major misstep and is a really bad song, but they pick up again with the flowery &quot;She's A Rainbow&quot;. This album has taken an undue amount of heat, but as the years have passed, it should be looked at for what it is, a solid foray into the psychedelic arena by one of the best bands of all-time.
B00004Z459|5.0|I just recently bought this CD after a recommendation from a friend and I can't explain how incredible this album is!  It pulled me in with it's professional, yet original sound, combining rock, alternative, hip-hop, and electronic.  To any music fan out there, this album is a must-have!  I personally am not a big fan of heavy music, but LP definately has swayed my opinion with this CD.  This is an absolute masterpiece!
B00005N7Z1|3.0|&quot;Robocop&quot; is a well-produced movie with talented actors, slick special effects and an exciting story.  However, I was turned off somewhat by the extreme, and I do mean extreme violence.  I usually don't get put off by that, but &quot;Robocop&quot; made me cringe a few times.  Much of this film is bleak and gloomy, and it's definitely not for kids.
B00006AW2L|5.0|Aftermath shows a tremendous leap for the band. Mick Jagger &amp; Keith Richards were starting to bloom as songwriters and the band started to step away from the heavy R&amp;B sounds of their earlier albums. Brian Jones was the founder and spiritual leader of the band and Aftermath contains some of his finest moments with the band. &quot;Paint It Black&quot; was the band's third number one single and it sounded like nothing they had done previously with it's sitar work and eerie, apocalyptic sound and doomsday lyrics. &quot;Stupid Girl&quot; has the lowdown, dirty vibe that would permeate alot of their future records. &quot;Under My Thumb&quot; is one of the all-time best Stones songs and the samba beats and controlling lyrics. &quot;Lady Jane&quot; sounds stately with the harpsichord, &quot;High &amp; Dry&quot; moves along smoothly and the &quot;Going Home&quot; closes the album on a strong note.
B000002GJH|5.0|If you think the decline of Western civilization either will never happen or is far, far away... see the completely inane comments made by \\"Da Peace Dogg\\".
B00006AW2P|4.0|The self-titled debut album by The Rolling Stones laid the blueprint for the next several releases of their career. They had a couple of original songs and a liberal dose of the hardcore rhythm & blues that made them the evil twins of the Beatles. The first three songs \\"Not Fade Away\\", \\"Route 66\\" & \\"I Just Want To Make Love To You\\" (later made famous by Foghat) all show the raw energy of the band. \\"Tell Me\\" is a fine original composition. \\"I'm A King Bee\\" sets up the Mick Jagger persona of the sexual lothario and \\"Carol\\" starts the trend of having a Chuck Berry cover on their first few albums. The album shows off the band's potential and although it doesn't always hit, \\"Can I Get A Witness\\" and \\"Walking The Dog\\" to name two, it is a solid debut.
B00005N53P|5.0|If you are a guy all you have to do is look at the cover, and you'll want this in your music collection or hanging on the bathroom wall. But seeing as how I am not a guy I did have a reason to buy this album. \\"New York City Cops\\" was taken off of the American pressing because of the 9/11 terrorist thing. Personally I think it was a huge mistake, because it is one of the best songs on the album. This album is an import from Germany, so it has the song on there (although I am not sure why Amazon.com didn't write it on the track listing.) If you already own the American pressing, go ahead and buy this one anyway. I did, and I do not regret it. If you're afraid that your parents will find the cover just turn it inside out and have Julian's darling face showing.
B00006AW2S|5.0|Out Of Our Heads contains the strongest original material from the band's first few albums released between 1963-1965. Of course \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\" tops the list and with it's fuzz guitar riff, it is one of the most memorable songs in history. \\"Play With Fire\\" shows off a more mature edge. The covers they choose are consistently on target including the menacing \\"The Spider & The Fly\\", the powerful \\"That's How Strong My Love Is\\" and \\"Mercy, Mercy\\". Heads marks a major leap by the Jagger-Richards songwriting team and the band was really starting the gel.
B000069HKH|5.0|A very nice blend of what Bruce Springsteen does naturally. Typical Springsteen band music which rocks, such as Lonesome Day and the Rising. Sprinsteen's quieter side is presented wonderfully with The Nothing Man and Paradise.  The Boss adds international flair with World's Apart with its mix of wonderful Middle Eastern/Pakistani introduction.  Overall, a top notch album. I'm from NJ but not a big Bruce fan overall, but something made me buy this album and I'm glad I did.
B00006EXDM|5.0|Hot Rocks pulls together the classic Stones songs from the 60's and what more really needs to be said about them. The album is a virtual history lesson of the band. \\"Satisfaction\\", \\"Jumping Jack Flash\\", \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\" and all the others have become more than just songs, they have become part of music lore. Hot Rocks is a must for any fan of the band and a great place to start for those who aren't familiar with their music.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I hardly ever write reviews, but I've been reading the comments here and decided to add mine. Fans of Wilco who enjoy their early alt-country sound shouldn't pick up this record, because that's not what you get. People who liked the more pop-oriented Summerteeth may not enjoy it, either, although there are echoes of that release on this one (the tracks \\"Kamera,\\" \\"Heavy Metal Drummer,\\" and \\"Pot Kettle Black,\\" for example). Wilco has definitely expanded on their earlier work on Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, marrying catchy pop melodies with experiments in noise and distortion. Judging from the other reviews here, it may not be enough experimentation for those listeners who want something really avant garde, and it's too much for people who want radio-friendly pop songs that don't require anything from the listener. However, if you don't fall into either of those categories, you may want to give YHF a chance. Repeated listens are a must to truly appreciate the sound that Wilco has created. They also give you a chance to think about Jeff Tweedy's often poetic lyrics, like these from \\"Jesus, Etc.\\": \\"tall buildings shake/ voices escape singing sad sad songs/ tuned to chords strung down your cheeks/ bitter melodies turning your orbit around.\\" If you're not sure YHF is for you, do what I did-borrow it and give it a listen. You may be glad you did.
B00006AW2G|5.0|Let It Bleed is the bluesiest of all the Stones' records and this probably has to do with the addition of former Bluesbreakers guitarist Mick Taylor to the band. He adds some fine slide and blues guitar work to the band. This album sounds like it could have been recorded in the Mississippi Delta. In fact &quot;Love In Vain&quot; is an old blues song that the band sings in a dirge-like fashion. &quot;Midnight Rambler&quot; sounds like something that Muddy Waters could have written. &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; contains just a simple guitar and drum backing, but is a great song. &quot;You Got The Silver&quot; has Keith singing lead and it is some of his best vocal work ever. &quot;Country Honk&quot; is a country reworking of their number one hit rocker &quot;Honky Tonk Woman&quot;. There are some hard rockers on the album including the opening track &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; and the scorching &quot;Live with Me&quot;. &quot;Monkey Man&quot; is one the most underappreciated songs in the Stones catalog. Martin Scorcese used it brilliantly in the film &quot;Goodfellas&quot; and it contains some classic screeching by Jagger. Of course the most played track on the album is the last one, &quot;You Can't Always Get What You Want&quot;. It's the Stones slap of reality to the hippie's love &amp; peace movement and a foreshadowing of the violence that would pierce the country, including their own Altamont show.  Let It Bleed very well could be the band's finest work and it is one of the best albums in the history of rock.

B00006AW2E|5.0|Out Of Our Heads contains the strongest original material from the band's first few albums released between 1963-1965. The UK version does not contain the classic &quot;(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction&quot; or &quot;Play With Fire&quot;.  But this version has a harder, bluesy edge with a ripping &quot;Hitch Hike&quot; and a sultry &quot;Hearts Of Stone&quot;. Heads marks a major leap by the Jagger-Richards songwriting team and the band was really starting the gel.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|i'll admit; i'm not a five star gal.  at all.  but this film really earns it.  it's creepy, romantic, thrilling, and touching (as a family drama) all at once. <br />i don't know how to put my thoughts coherently after seeing such an inventive, amazing movie as this.  but let it be known that i had to rewatch this movie three times (yes three times!) to grasp all the little precarious details... yet i still can't get enough.!<br />richard kelly is obviously a great talent.  and i thank him and drew barrymore (who produced this) for making such a  beautiful, beautiful film.  to think this is his first movie amazes me.  and he made it at 26!  wow.<br />congratulations to jake gylenhaal, and the rest of the wonderful cast (jena malone, patrick swayze, drew barrymore, noah whyle, and especially mary mcdonnel) for potraying their characters so convincingly and honestly.  <br />also kudos to the special effects and production values that wholly deceive this movie's indie budget.  <br />i've rarely seen a film this affecting, emotionally and otherwise.  there's a tenderness and heart to this movie that makes the creepy moments all the more chilling because it's based in a form of reality... <br />still, i'm in shock by the brilliance i have just witnessed.<br />kelly and company have convincing argument for cinema as an artform.
B00006AW2J|5.0|Beggars Banquet was the last album released by the original Stones lineup, although Brian Jones is reported to have barely played on it. It was a strong comeback by the band, who in trying to compete with the Beatles and fit in with the Psychadelic scene, had released the terribly misguided Their Satantic Majesties Request. Beggars strips away all the musically gimmickry and provides the listener with bare-bones rock. \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\" has taken on a life of its own and has become the band's manifesto. \\"No Expectations\\", \\"Dear Doctor\\", \\"Prodical Son\\" & \\"Factory Girl\\" find the band exploring country music themes for the first time. With their sexual themes, \\"Parachute Woman\\" & \\"Stray Cat Blues\\" put the band in familiar territory. The album closes with their anthem for the little man, the earnest \\"Salt Of The Earth\\". Beggars Banquet closes one era of the band while opening up a new one. They say goodbye to Brian Jones and start a music path that would produce some of the greatest albums ever recorded in musical history
B00005QIPH|3.0|A decent start from a decent band- not the saviors of rock or whatever, but not as horrible as some would say. You can't control what the media machine churns out, so just focus on the music, not on the fact that MTV/Rolling Stone are crediting bands like this one (as well as Hives/Vines) as the future of rock based on the strengths of debut singles. The songs here are pretty catchy in a breezy/gritty style. Not THE catchiest band around, though, and not the most rockin' either. It's too bad that they're overshadowing true masters of the game like Guided By Voices and Spoon, but that's not their fault I guess. Like I said, good enough, but won't crack my top 10 for the year by a long stretch...
B00006EXCC|5.0|Aftermath was the first album written entirely by Mick Jagger & Keith Richards  and it shows a tremendous leap for the band. The band started to step away from the heavy R&B sounds of their earlier albums. Brian Jones was the founder and spiritual leader of the band and Aftermath contains some of his finest moments with the band. \\"Out Of Time\\" is a superb song while \\"Stupid Girl\\" has the lowdown, dirty vibe that would permeate alot of their future records. \\"Mother's Little Helper\\" was one of the first songs to address drug use and it has a hypnotic, ringing beat. \\"Under My Thumb\\" is one of the all-time best Stones songs and the samba beats and controlling lyrics. \\"Lady Jane\\" sounds stately with the harpsichord, \\"High & Dry\\" moves along smoothly and the \\"Going Home\\" closes the album on a strong note.
079284131X|4.0|Chiild's Play is a good horror movie with great special effects and some genuinely scary moments. Everyone in the cast is excellent. Gore is minimal and there is no sex or nudity, making this a tasteful horror film. The DVD only has a trailer, so hopefully there will be a special edition. The musical score will send shivers down your spine.
B00006AW2F|4.0|Metamorphosis was originally released in 1975 , but never found its way onto a compact disk.  The album finally makes its digital debut.  The genesis of the album was to thwart bootlegs of the rare and unreleashed music the band had made.  Although they are Stones songs, practically none of the songs are full band efforts.  Many of the songs like &quot;Out Of Time&quot; were set up as blueprints for other artists to follow as the Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were farming out their surplus material.  Despite this, the album is an enjoyable affair and long overdue for Stones fans.
B000065U1N|5.0|WOW! The best war movie yet! Finally a war movie with no romance! No offence to anyone but I don't like romance in these particular movies and this is coming from a girl! Awesome movie. Josh Hartnett was astonishing! Along with the whole cast and crew! I wish Blackburn(Orlnado Bloom) never got hurt***
B0000070QS|4.0|i liked this cd. I am a big fan of morten and his voice. So with out complaint, i found this cd good. It was something different, something, i think to achieve, until he went back to A-HA for the 2000 record
0451457994|5.0|Do you like thrilling expeditions to other worlds?  How about mysterious, cryptic occurences?  If so, then you'll most likely love this awe-inspiring science fiction novel!  The book starts out with an intriguing few chapters several million years ago, when apes still roamed the earth, creating a sort of background upon which many of the sometimes incomprehensible shadows of the story are thrown.  The tale suddenly changes to what when it was written {1969} would be the future: 2001, when the universe has become a prime target for research and daring astronauts.  Among these is Dr. Heywood Floyd, who embarks on a secretive mission to Earth's Moon in order to study a peculiar monolith recently dug up that is emitting strange radio waves towards Saturn.  Eighteen years later, David Bowman and Frank Poole journey into space to check out Saturn onboard the advanced craft Discovery, which is run by the talking, terrifically, and dangerously, intelligent HAL 9000 computer.  However, what the duo does not realize, which HAL guiltily does, is that the odyssey is really a quest for extraterrestrial life, hinted at by the Moon's compelling monolith, but all will not go as planned.  When a horrible tragedy occurs, brought on by HAL losing all control of his mechanical emotions, and therefore, his sanity, only David Bowman is left to strategically continue on with the odyssey alone.  Of course, his very survival lies in the hands of the universe, and he finds himself captured by an unrecognizable force which drags Dave into perhaps one of the greatest enigmas of all time...and then makes him a chilling part of it.<br />I must admit that when I finished Arthur C. Clarke's spellbinding novel, I was incredibly confused and a little shaken by the note it leaves off on, but the ingenious plot became clearer after some pondering.  The hooking suspense and power of Clarke's masterful language alone make the book a great read, besides the unforgettable adventures to beautiful wonders in the universe and extremely thought-out, interrelated plot twists.  Whether because of its astronomical appeal or undeniable brilliancy, this is one odyssey which will always remain, in my mind, an absolutely exhilarating tribute to the cosmos and the entire human race itself.  The movie may be fairly enjoyable, but the actual book is a quintessential part of anyone's and everyone's bookshelf.
B00005QIPH|3.0|The Strokes seem to have achieved this weird status with Is This It of being the saviors of rock, and the group that will pull this world out of its Britney-intensive dung heap and take us to a wonderful era of music being something more than a business and the producer becoming a thing of the past... or something. The fact is, The Strokes were hyped as the saviors of rock, and their producers decided to market them as revolutionary. I'm sorry I had to say that, but this album has gained so much hype that any review of it has to address the hype.<br />Now, there is actually music on this CD, so let's talk about that too. This album has some shockingly catchy songs on it. &quot;Someday&quot; was stuck in my head for about a week straight, and, after hearing &quot;Hard To Explain&quot;, I had to buy the album to make the song go away. Don't expect anything deep coming into this album. This are pretty much good pop songs.<br />Bottom line: It's over-hyped, fun, catchy, and just generally listenable. The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is that I hate bands that can't admit they're marketing themselves.
0694003611|5.0|As the mom of a toddler, I loved the Goodnight Moon board book. Before he was ready for paper pages, Goodnight Moon was our favorite book. The colorful pictures of everyday objects and peaceful rhyming words have made it a family favorite.
B000068CNX|1.0|What's all the fuss with this darn show? Please...average network sitcom fluff. Tired writing, cheesy gaglines, and recycled plots. And this gets acclaim?

So riveting.<BR>And please, someone explain to me: Where in the heck are the people of color on this show if they \\"live\\" in New York City????<BR>Oh, non-whites don't live in New York and drink coffee?

B00005QIPH|1.0|I've read the hype and I've listened to the CD.  It's just not very good.  Why not just listen to the Ramones who were 25 years earlier and better anyway.<br />No one will know who the strokes are 5 years from now.  I promise.
B00006AW2S|3.0|I have purchased six of the remasters so far including Out of Heads, Beggar's Banquet, Flowers, Satanic Majesties, Ya Ya's, and Aftermath. Out of Our Heads was the fifth remaster I purchased and I was completely disappointed.  I remembered very much enjoying the record as a teen.  It is a bit of a hodge podge, singles pieced together to form an album.  The performances are still good for the most part, there are some all time classics like Satisfaction and one or two lost classics like Spider and the Fly; a couple of tracks don't hit the mark at all. The sound on the remaster is not only not improved from the earlier it is worse.  I promptly returned it for Aftermath which is a joy and an enormous sonic improvement. Out of our Heads, three stars, hasn't aged well, overrated in retropect, and a lousy remastering job.  Get Beggar's Banquet. Next up NOW and Let it Bleed.
B00003CXXP|4.0|I went into this movie thinking it was to be yet another Pinocchio story, and as I am a huge Asimov fan I thought I knew exactly what to expect.<br />Luckilly I was wrong.  This is a fascinating sci-fi story without focusing on the sci-fi too much, as most revolve around the fantasy aspect of the technology that the story gets lost.  This is definitely not the case, and is obviously meant to be watched and for it to entertain.<br />Spielberg did a very good job of creating the mood and atmospher so it makes the viewer feel at home with everything and feel completely lost in all the right places.<br />All the actory, especially Jude Law and William Hurt, did tremendous jobs in helping to create the atmosphere.
B000021Y7X|5.0|This movie is amazing. The performances are superb and energy surges through every song. As for the guy who gave it one star for the commentary...Uhhh...You can turn the commentary off.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This ia great movie, and fun for all ages!  My niece, less than 2 years, loves the music and seeing the lumbering Shrek.  There is lots more to add, just wanted to stress the re-watchability(if that is even a word) of this film as she makes me and her parents watch it over...and over...and over again.
B000068TPN|1.0|Seeing this movie in the theater I walked on being so disgusted at the poor portrayal of Vietnam. Overglorified battles when actual combat in Vietnam were chaotic skirmishes... it looked like a civil war battle with all the Vietnamese charging blindly and falling by the dozens... riiiight. There is a laughable scene where Mel spins around and miraculously shoots a Vietnamese character when he comes a little too close to the group of American officers. This is one of the few movies which I have walked out on.
B00000FCBC|4.0|Garage, Inc. is a great Metallica album. All of the songs on disc 1 sound like the good songs from Load and Reload (King Nothing, Until It Sleeps, Fuel, The Memory Remains, and The Unforgiven II). However, this album will disappoint a lot of fans who like to think of Metallica as a mere thrash band. For those of us who know that Metallica outgrew speed metal years ago, however (though they've definitely been in a creative slump for a while), Garage, Inc. will stand as a great band paying tribute to its heroes.<br />The album's best tracks are \\"Sabba Cadabra\\" (Metallica putting a great spin on a little-known Black Sabbath classic); \\"Turn the Page\\" (which fits Metallica much better than a Bob Seger song should); \\"Die, Die My Darling\\" (the only good punk song is one written by Glenn Danzig, and played by a heavy metal band); \\"Loverman\\" (a downright scary tune); \\"Whiskey in the Jar\\" (probably the best-known song off the album); and the best of the best, their take on Blue Oyster Cult's \\"Astronomy.\\"
0140177396|4.0|This book was absolutely amazing.  this novella is a great choice for readers of all types and ages.  this book is basicly about friendship, prejudice, and most importantly, the American Dream.  everyone has an American Dream.  whether its to own land, to become famous, to have a family, or simply to belong somewhere~ everyone wants to be socially equal and have material wealth.  this novella teaches the lesson that although dreams give u hope and motovation to keep striving towards the future,  there is also that fear that u won't reach u'r dream and that is very true in many cases such as lennie and george's.  this story is about fate.  most of the events occured in this book based on being at the wrong place at the wrong time or in one word, fate.  this book gets its title from a very touching poem.  it simply means strong vs. the weak.  i would deffinently recommend this book because it is realistic and does not have a happy ending because that is the way life goes sometimes.  you don't always reach your goals in life.
0694013889|5.0|I am still training my daughter but this book has helped her to understand the concept.  The illustrations are simple and the plain descriptions of our body parts makes reading this book easy.<br />My oldest daughter also learned to go potty from this book (although it seemed to go faster for her...) and it is still a favorite as she helps me read it to her younger sister.<br />This book would make a great shower gift and will be a timeless classic for parents.
B000002UAC|5.0|In 1963 when I first saw this album (With the Beatles)it was not the original tital to the work - The original tital was &quot;Meet The Beatles&quot; I thought eveyone would want to know this piece of triva from a Rock &amp; Roller who lived and played music then. Jack Horner/Keyboard player/Vocalist for &quot;The Sabres&quot; (A frat house band and one of the top bands in Miami Fl. Circa 1965 to 1967.
B000056HRY|4.0|I'm sure any die-hard action fan is well aware of Steven Seagal's early death in this film, so I won't mention it again. Kurt Russell plays a CIA analyst a la the Jack Ryan films and he also knows how to fly, which comes in handy at the end, but nevermind. The plot concerns a group of terrorists hijacking an airplane to land in Washington DC and detonate a deadly bomb. Probably not the best choice of viewing after 9-11, but it's pretty exciting and has some good humor. There's plenty of suspense to keep the viewer interested.
0316666343|3.0|To be honest, I do not read a lot of fiction books.  Not that I don't like them, I just rarely have the time and there are so many to choose from....however, this is one I did buy and read after hearing so much about it.  I enjoyed the book, and thought the perspective (the dead girl, Susie) was a unique one.  Though not &quot;all enthralling&quot;, I thought the book was an &quot;easy read&quot; and it kept my interest -- learning of the changes, problems, and healing the family and others go through over the years.  On the other hand, without giving anything away, the ending was a little disappointing to me.
B00000ILE7|3.0|Now-film-great David Fincher made his directorial debut here in what should have been the last of the excellent sci-fi/horror series. The special effects here are fairly good, but the scares are lacking. What the movie succeeds in is giving us a great main character, the tortured soul of Ellen Ripley, played by Sigourney Weaver, the only female who can successfully lead an action flick. While it's not the best in the series, it is a great ending to the awesome series that started out with a crew of a commercial spaceship getting slaughtered and (sort of) ends with the last survivor of that ship finding herself stuck in one more battle with the beast that destroyed her life. Ignore the terrible fourth.
0385335482|4.0|I don't read much fiction, but needed a distraction and something funny to read, and this seemed right up my alley!  I read straight through it -- which I only do with books that truly interest or entertain me.  I couldn't wait to find out what would happen next!  Very funny tale of someone I can easily identify with -- someone who seems like such a real person.  I plan to purchase the rest of the books in this series to find out how things go with Rebecca.
0767817710|4.0|It took me many years to finally decide to watch The Quick and the Dead. It didn't look that interesting, and I thought had the potential to be a bad film. But Sam Raimi did direct it, so I knew there was potential for it to be good. And it is. Raimi is the man who directed the Evil Dead series, Spider-Man, Darkman, and The Gift, and helped to bring us Xena and Brisco County. So this western has the Raimi flair. It's a straightforward story of redemption and revenge, told with Raimi's stylistic flair. Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe give good performances, and Gene Hackman does a great job as the main baddie (no surprise there). Even Sharon Stone does a good job of portraying Ellen with the right amount of anger, fear, and uncertainty. But Stone's performance isn't quite as convincing as the other actors'. There's something missing from her performance. But it is a solid movie. The dvd contains no extras.
0553260111|3.0|A very engaging premise with a great deal of promise, but only middling success at delivering the goods.  This book would have been much better had it been tighter and more consistent.  While much of the intrigue is dated by today's standards, it still has the power to grab the reader's attention.  Unfortunately the author's inelegance makes parts of the book tedious and even onerous.  I found myself rolling my eyes at several of the situations the characters found themselves in, and was incredulous at the murders at the &quot;top secret&quot; office in New York, coupled with the totally unbelievable &quot;fingerprint on a glass&quot; bit of evidence planting.  The ending was just plain bad.<br />Ludlum did several things very well -- the basis for Bourne's existence was well thought out and plausible, as was Cain's mission (raison d'être).  I appreciated how he handled the character of Marie, making her competent and intelligent (and an economist!) rather than a typical damsel in distress.  I imagine his scenery and setting were accurate, although those details added nothing to the story as far as I was concerned.<br />I'm tempted to give Ludlum the benefit of the doubt since this book was written more than twenty years ago.  I'm not sure yet if I'll read another book in the series.
B000069HKH|5.0|I would not have described myself as a rabid Bruce fan, although I have enjoyed a lot of his music over the years.  When he announced he was going on tour this year, we decided to go see him.  He is, without a doubt, one of the hardest working musicians alive today.  I am now a rabid Bruce fan!<br />The sheer joy of watching him and the E Street Band perform together is very powerful.  I did not own &quot;The Rising&quot; until after seeing him in concert.  I would highly recommend it.  The music pours out from his very soul on his feelings regarding September 11 and the aftermath.  There are many songs to stir your soul, but &quot;The Nothing Man&quot; will give you goose bumps.  If you're thinking about buying it, but aren't quite sure, buy it.  You won't be sorry.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This Is a Great Colletion Of 27 Of The Beatles Hits Such as Help,Let it be,She Loves You,We Can Work it out and The Beatles Classic YELLOW SUBURINE. This Is NOT The Complete Beatles Colletion but It's The Next Best Thing. This IS A MUST BY FOR ANY MUSIC FAN.
0553381709|5.0|Monumental power struggles with numerous players, all with their own agendas. The people who populate the pages of Martin's books are as varied as the stones in a stream bed. Some arrogant and mean spirited, they spit, curse, ... and murder their way towards their goals, while some just try to survive after their worlds crumble. These are books where the \\"good\\" characters often make bad decisions and the \\"bad\\" characters are occasional allies. It keeps you guessing what will happen next and who will live to tell about it. It is brilliant and complex - without being tangled. <br />Bravo - George - for being a masterful storyteller who knows how to use both unexpected strengths and weaknesses to make a character \\"human\\" and most of all, for not sacrificing reality to bend to the romantics need for fluff and last minute miracles. Thank you for every character who vomits at the stench of death or ... himself as the cold draws closer. It makes the horror more palpable and the suspense of what will happen next, pure torture.
B0000028RR|5.0|If you listen to rock, this is a must have. its hard to believe its over a decade old. to me its timeless. RATM is a great political band that says what the government doesnt want your feeble ears to hear.
B00005QG9J|5.0|why are people calling them sell-outs? huh? radio friendly? i hear slipknot on the radio does that make it friendly? metal gets played on the radio all the time,no one calls those bands sell outs. incubus did a friggin good job with this cd. for one band from cali they sure have covered a lot of styles in thier ten year career and ill tell you one thing,if they ever have a greatest hits album one day....it'll be one of the most schizophrenic albums ever! (haha) thats not a bad thing either. everyone complains how soft this album is....but hey they like classic music...they like everything from PINK FLOYD to IRON MAIDAN...they like all kinds of music,so wouldnt you expect them to PLAY all kinds of music? this album to me is thier best and most diverse,although that doesnt discount the others,i am just saying from a musical stand this is the best. it may be lighter than the others but if you lived in a mansion with five dorks for a few months wouldnt you be light? anyway like i said they cover everything...i heard they have been going around under different names at clubs,playing different styles...metal.punk,funk....they might release some of that stuff one day....i think thats cool. they cover a vast varity of music already and from what ive seen....they are just getting started.
B00005JL3A|3.0|Resident Evil is yet another movie based on a video game and I must say I don't think it was that bad. Sure the Zombies are no where as scary as the ones in Romero's films, just seem more like people with rabies than the living dead, lol. What I was surprised about though was the acting, it wasn't all that bad. Think Milla Jovovich (The Fifth Element) gives her best performance yet, Michelle Rodriguez (The Fast & the Furious) is pretty good too. Getting rid of George Romero was the biggest mistake though as I was really looking forward to a come-bat. Mean the director of Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead doing Resident Evil would of been a dream come true. Sure his scrpt that was canned was much better too.<br />  Well anyway despite that let down, besides the acting I also liked the action, especially the train sequence at the end. Think there's a little too much confusing in the very end though, leaves too many loose ends. For instance there's a certain character whose fate really isn't clear and who you don't see again, guess they're planning a sequel. As long as they have a better script, scarier zombies and the sexy  Milla Jovovich returns I'll have no problem with that.
B00006AW2J|5.0|This release is up there with the best stuff the Stones have recorded. Sympathy For The Devil is unbelievable!<br />If you have this CD along with Let It Bleed, Some Girls, Get Yer YA Ya's Out, Exile on Main Street, Sticky Fingers, Aftermath, and the UK release of Between The Buttons, then you have the best of the Rolling Stones. The recent ABKCO SACD remasters breathe new life into these superb recordings.
B00003CXXP|1.0|I watched this film on the big screen with a group of new friends while taking a college summer course. We were all excited to see Spielberg's newest masterpiece. Sadly, we were all disappointed as we watched a movie with very cold characters. There was little or no love here.In addition to the coldness of the whole movie, the lack of a believable, or interesting, plot was too much to bear. The entire movie was a series of anti-climaxes. Just when you thought something interesting and exciting was about to happen, the scene was over.<br />Just not a good movie.... 1 star? No stars in my book. A thumb to the ground.
B00005JKJA|2.0|I have always been a fan of independent movies and especially of films that are thought provoking. I can then say I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. Now I'm wishing I hadn't. I did enjoy Mr Lynch's talents as a director, however I cannot say the same about his writting.<br />I have had conversations with many people about this movie... and while the most common answers are &quot;It was cool&quot; or &quot;It was weird&quot;, no one has been able to clearly explain the plot or the last half of the movie... I can say I did understand most of Lynch's symbolism but overall I feel alot of it was unrelated to the movie and added simply to leave the viewer wondering about their relevance.<br />I really consider this movie nothing more than a snowjob with some great camera work. I know many won't agree with me, but I don't think everything that cannot be understood can be called art. If this were the case I could be the next Picasso.
B00005JL3A|4.0|I'm a BIG fan of the Resident Evil games,so I was very much looking forward to seeing the film.Of course,movies are rarely as good as the original material,be it a game or a book.So I was prepared to hate the movie.I didn't.As an action movie,it's quite good (although the music was loud and annoying).It didn't have much in the way of horror in it; unlike the games,it didn't scare me all that much.So if you keep your expectations low in comparing it to the games,it's an enjoyable enough action flick.<BR>I really wanted to give it a 3 1/2 stars,as it's not really THAT good,but so be it...

0767853636|3.0|A great film, for its time, but never near what 'Annie' is meant to be.<br />Don't get me wrong, I loved this little ginger fuzz ball for years but sadly the film is inferior to both the true Broadway intention and a more recent Buena Vista / Disney re-make. The latter is much more true to Broadway grandeur and razzmatazz which, in my opinion, could well leave this little orphan waiting for a `tomorrow' which will never come.

0316666343|4.0|I camr to this book full of incredibly high hopes...hopes of a moving, beautifully realised, original and well written book. Well, it was well written, and quite original, i suppose. <br />However, this book fails to deliver on some levels. I expectd to be moved...i was looking forward to be moved, and possibly shedding a tear or two...I expected to feel heartbreak at injustice and loss of potential of a young life, and the grief that surrounds that loss. However, this book is just to...sweet, for that. The premise is great, and the writing is first class, but Sebold, with  a few exceptions, fails to move us greatly. Theres just, to be honest, not a lot to be sad about. Nothing to evoke a real tear...Sebold does not have that way with words that some writers do...the ability to place the qords in jsut the right order to make the reader feel intense heartbreak and sadness. <br />Insted, this novel is too candyish. The Heaven never really strikes true, and some of the characters are just ghosts, you can never really grasp them in your mind. <br />It doesnt even say much about grief, as i had expected it to. It turns out, basically, to be simply a feel-good (for the most part) novel with a happy ending. More raw emotion is needed...more despair... more needs to be made of the sadness. That would make the book a lot more powerful, and me more inclined to write a glowing review. <br />It's not a bad book...in fact, for the most part its quite enjoyable, but it has such potential to be so much more than it actually is...<br />First 50 pages are great, as are the last 150. The middle is slightly less inspiring.
B00005JKPF|5.0|I am as excited as all to see Gambit in X2 although I can wait for him in X3, I would rather see Beast as a main character in X-Men 2 since Rouge is still a teenagers and maybe she needs to be a little older so they can write the plot in with Gambit for X-Men 3...I was hoping actor Sam Khaleghi (8 Mile, Envy, The Ugly One) would play him although I think that was just a rumour, Brad Renfro among others have been mentioned.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Wow! That is one word that can be used the describe this movie, among a list of another synonomous adjectives. I haven't viewed the bonus material, but the movie itself is AMAZING and unlike ANYTHING you have ever seen before. After watching this movie the first time, the shock factor reached something along the lines of my first viewing of &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show.&quot; I was left thinking after each scene &quot;Wow, what just happened? That went by so fast!&quot; The soundtrack uses various songs from different movies and popular bands in a wild mix of musical fun. On top of that, Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman have very beautiful voices, and the song &quot;Come What May&quot; made chill-bumps run up and down my spine!<br />If you enjoy musicals, this is a MUST-SEE!
B000069KE0|5.0|&quot;Chicago II&quot; takes the momentum created by their first album, &quot;Chicago Transit Authority&quot; and raises their crisp, clear &quot;sound&quot; to a higher level.  The album flows naturally from one song into the next.  The listener will get a better feel for &quot;stand-alone&quot; singles like &quot;Make Me Smile&quot;, &quot;Colour My World&quot; and &quot;24 or 6 to 4&quot; when they listen to them in the sequence in which they were recorded.<br />The six song set called Ballet For a Girls in Buchannon is reason alone to get this album.  What great songwriting and orchestration!<br />Earlier reviewers panned the remastering of this album by stating that the &quot;hiss&quot; in the original recording hasn't been  improved by 21st Century technology.  Don't let a comment like that keep you from purchasing this album.  The sound quality is fine and the music far outshadows any recording shortcomings.<br />For longtime Chicago fans, the remastering of &quot;Chicago II&quot; will be like receiving an early Christmas present.  New fans will gain immediate respect for one of the 70's pioneer &quot;brass-oriented&quot; groups.  Either way, no one loses with this great album!  Enjoy!
B000063S6Z|3.0|When Play was released in 1999, it was basically dead to the charts. Moby's music, to most people, must have seemed like a strange cacophony of samples and instruments and/or repetitivie musical patterns. Nonetheless, Moby received a plethora of critical accolade for the cd--as well as his other works--and also a small, but loyal, underground following. I purchased Play before it had been given on a silver platter to numerous companies and before Gwen Stafani leant her vocals to &quot;South Side.&quot; I purchased it on the strength of songs such as &quot;Porcelain,&quot; &quot;Natural Blues,&quot; and &quot;Body Rock&quot; and I think the reason is simple: diversity. Play is probably one of the more diverse electronica albums I own and it is because of this diversity that 18 seems so lackluster.<br />I will admit that I decided to get 18 on an irrational proclivity where if I have one stellar cd from an artist then I will immediately purchase the following ones. Because of this large confirmation bias I will sometimes buy cd's that, though not bad, do not meet my expectations. 18 is an anomaly because it seems to fit better as a *prequel* to Play than a follow-up. The mechanics are relatively the same but the difference on 18 is that songs seem to form a tessellated work which gets more dull with every listen. From the boring &quot;We are All Made of Stars&quot; to the up-beat &quot;Extreme Ways,&quot; nothing really seems to project itself as unique on 18. At certain points I wonder if Moby merely used the same samples. The crucial difference is that Play fashioned itself as a stunning, diverse project since the first three singles placed different emphasis on musical structure (&quot;Body Rock&quot; sounded more trance than the ambient &quot;Porcelain&quot;). 18 comes with few distinctions (&quot;Jam for The Ladies&quot; and &quot;Extreme Ways&quot; being the only two) and failed attempts to break new musical territory (the Zero 7-inspired &quot;Fireworks&quot;).<br />This dour review, however, should not seem that way if one has never heard Play. I recommend this cd to those who want an introduction to Moby's style since 18 sounds like sort of the last artistic sputter before the engine got going on Play. It isn't a bad cd but it simply does not compare to Play in any manner.<br />If you have Play, there is no need to get 18.<br />If do not have Play, then it is a good idea to get 18.<br />This dour review, however, should not seem that way if one has never heard Play.

B000001ESN|4.0|Okay, I'm back to the Rush reviews. PERMANENT WAVES (1980) marked the beginning of Rush's 'middle period', i.e. they were still a Heavy Metal band, albeit a progressive one, but their songs began to get a bit shorter and more radio-friendly at this point. This would be a bad thing for most bands; however with Rush, it just made their sound more accessible while still packing a powerful lyrical punch, courtesy of drumming and songwriting genius Neil Peart, the band's resident Ayn Rand. It also gained Rush tremendous popularity, while not 'selling out'. The swirling guitar/keyboard music also packs a wallop in its own way; it's not as loud or heavy as it had been in the band's early days, but is no less heartfelt. Rush's signature time-changes are on full display on every song on this album, and if anything, Rush's music became even more complex-just more compact.<br />And what a compact recording PERMANENT WAVES is: containing only six songs and stretching only 35 minutes, this album is short even by Rush standards. But every song is significant, magical and has something to say. \\"Spirit of Radio\\" is the opening track and, of course, the one that people know best from this album. Although it may have eventually suffered a little from too much FM-radio overplay, one cannot deny the timelessness of its message. In fact, its thesis of corporate erosion of the integrity of modern music is perhaps even more relevant today than it was at the dawn of the 1980's, what with the increased proliferation of manufactured entertainers such as Billy Ray Cyrus, the Backstreet Boys, 'Nsync, O-Town, Eden's Crush, etc etc. \\"Freewill\\" has a strongly individualistic message to which most people can relate, as it deals with the choice of how to live one's life and the methods by which one arrives at that choice. Musically, it pulls out all the stops: It contains one of the greatest Alex Lifeson guitar solos of all time, and I love the way it incorporates Rush's earlier style by having Geddy Lee screaming the bridge, with echo and reverb aplenty. Interestingly enough, this would be the very last time we would hear Geddy's early-Rush-style scream (previously heard to great effect on RUSH, FLY BY NIGHT, CARESS OF STEEL, 2112, AND A FAREWELL TO KINGS), as his voice was already mellowing out considerably, and would mellow out even more as time went by.<br />In continuation, we get \\"Jacob's Ladder,\\" one of two long songs on the CD, and definitely one to relax to while listening. Its beautiful, poetic lyrics are spare, and its music spans the spectrum from soft to hard and then soft again. Geddy Lee's keyboard abilities are in sharp focus here, as well as Neil Peart's strangely off-kilter, syncopated drumming (which is his trademark, of course). \\"Entre Nous\\" (\\"Between Us\\") deals poetically with the concept of interpersonal relationships, \\"Different Strings\\" is the one Lee-penned track on here; an abstract love song of sorts, it shows how much he had really grown as a lyricist from his \\"Take A Friend\\" days. Finally, the closer \\"Natural Science\\" is the one multi-part suite on PERMANENT WAVES; clocking in at over nine minutes, it marks a bit of a return to the epic style displayed on 2112, A FAREWELL TO KINGS, and HEMISPHERES. Its weird space-age sound and vocal effects in fact remind me very much of AFTK's \\"Cygnus X-1.\\" Similarly, it does merit some repeated listenings in order to 'get into it'.<br />PERMANENT WAVES marked the beginning of a new direction for Rush. Indeed, with this album, the stage was set for an all-time masterpiece...which will be discussed later. All in all, this CD is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B00005S8FC|3.0|There is nothing shocking about this album. There is nothing new about tango-fusion, which exists since the 70s, if not earlier.<br />I don't know what were the intentions of the musicians who made this album and frankly I don't care. The bottom line is that this makes good background music without going much further. The danger of making trance music is monotony and unfortunately ALL the tracks on this album do fall into it. However they still manage to keep our interest for the first 2 or 3 minutes of each track. After that, we just don't really listen anymore, but at least it doesn't get annoying to the point that we have to stop the CD player.<br />I'm afraid this music will fade into oblivion because its monotony. Or maybe not. There is a market for background music after all, and this stylish CD is quite good within that category.
B00005JKEC|5.0|Denzel Washington once again proves his acting skills are pure genius! This time he's an anti-hero, king of his violent and seedy world that is about to fall apart. Hawke appropriately plays Washington's unknowing and unwilling student/pawn.<BR>There is not one bad performance in this film with Denzel at the lead. This thriller, though not for the weak at heart, is a must see.
B000001ESP|5.0|i havent heard this entire album yet as, sadly, i dont even own it...i first heard of rush when 3 guys from my school did a YYZ cover at the talent show...i was immediately downloading their stuff, and anything after their prog rock stage (and even some of their prog rock) is just amazing music!<br />this 3-piece features some of the tightest musicianship you are ever going to find in a band, with great guitar hooks like in &quot;Limelight&quot; and &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; and amazing drum playing, such as that in &quot;YYZ&quot;<br />i admit to knowing very little actually about this fantastic band, other than that i love their music, and this is what music is all about: creativity, skill, being true to yourself...rush is a band anybody can like, if guitars and drums are what youre into...their unique style of rock, w/strong guitar influence is other-worldly...you just havent heard anything like this, unless youve heard this itself...their vocalist has perhaps the strangest voice ive ever heard, and in other bands it wouldnt work, but w/rush it just fits...his voice just goes w/their odd style and energetic delivery<br />when you finally get bored of your CD collection, and you see it needs a jump-start in originality, energy, and musicianship, look to rush first...though that may even be waiting too long, so you should probably just go out and pick up their music now...why are you waiting?
B000066NW0|5.0|As an &quot;older&quot; person who grew up during the Beatles years and gotten accustomed to musicians being male dominated, it's refreshing to see young female rockers like Avril, Michelle Branch performing with musical instruments as well as signing and writing songs.  <br />I am impressed that music is done by a 17 year old girl.

0688170528|5.0|The Hartes and the Golds have been best friends for years.  They've shared everything: pregnancy, Chinese food, and a strong love for their children.  So, it comes as a surprise to no one when their son and daughter, Chris and Emily, fall in love and start dating at age 13.  <br />What does come as a surprise is being called to the hospital late one night.  Emily is dead of a gunshot wound, and Chris is badly injured. He says it was a suicide pact.  The authorities, however, aren't so sure, and soon accuse Chris of Emily's murder.<br />The tension throughout this book, as to what really happened to Emily, is palpable.  Until the very end, I found myself believing BOTH stories depending on who was telling the tale.  The prison and courtroom scenes were well-researched and compelling, and the relationship between Chris and Emily's parents make a wonderful sub-plot. <br />Most of all, this book made me think a great deal about what love can, and cannot, make us do for other people and for ourselves.  I was terribly impressed with this book by Picoult, and look forward to reading more of her work.
0316666343|4.0|I didn't expect to like this book, but I got bullied into reading it and, so, okay, it was good.  Sebold can write.  She can write well enough to make me pretty uncomfortable about how some men treat some women -- except because she's such a good writer, it was about people hurting people, and forgiving people, and coping and getting over it and moving on, not about men and women or adults and children.  That's a pretty rare gift.  And it wasn't sentimental (okay, maybe a bit, particularly in the second half), and while I didn't totally buy the heaven idea it was well thought out and consistent and didn't offend my intelligence.<br />I'm trying not to sound like I'm giving left handed compliments here, it's just that this book is not my kind of thing, only I liked it.  I thought: a book where no one goes anywhere except heaven, how much fun can that be?  But it was, in a quiet, deep sort of way.  And it felt real.  Food for thought.
0060930349|5.0|First, to almost everyone who has posted something, contray to what most high school history teachers &quot;teach&quot;, history is not about facts and dates. The study of history is about how people interpret facts to develop opinions of the past. All good historians write with the goal of developing an opinion of history and supporting it with facts. For a person to dismiss a piece of historical writing as biased or subjective merely shows that person's ignorance and closed-mindedness. Anyone desiring to expand their historical understanding should seek out as many different historical viewpoints as possible. The diffenece between a good historian and a poor historian is that the good historian's thesis is clear from the first paragraph, giving the intelligent reader an insight into the writer's &quot;bias,&quot; while a poor historian hides behind the veil of &quot;objective&quot; history displayed in texts such as high school textbooks, the most inaccurate and irresponsible historical writing one can find.<br />Paul Johnson's book is an example of the former. It is a refreshingly optimistic approach to US history, something the history profession had been lacking since the 1960s. It is very enjoyable and insightful.<br />So what if his take on American history does not fit with the standard left-wing intellectual historical interpretations that are often passed for &quot;fact.&quot;  The whole idea of &quot;left-wing&quot; and &quot;right-wing&quot; is meanless anyway. I don't always agree with Johnson (Nixon for example), though sometimes I do (FDR); but it is refreshing to read something a little different than the standard &quot;objective&quot; drivel. Differing opinions are one of the many things that made the USA a great country. And it is a great country. If it wasn't, people would not have been risking everything to come here in the 1620s! <br />Johnson looks at the United States a work in progress, still struggling to create the society dreamed of in theDeclaration of Independence. Unlike so many historians who dwell on the evils of the past, Johnson sees the past as a sign that the United States is heading in the right direction and getting better all of the time. And I agree.

0385503954|5.0|It has been several months since I finished reading Ian McEwan's ATONEMENT and several weeks since I finished re-reading it.  It actually took me this long to collect my thoughts about this astounding achievement.  ATONEMENT is quite simply one of the most moving, beautifully written contemporary novels I have ever read.  As opposed to the last McEwan novel I read, AMSTERDAM, which was a tour de force of black, comic word play, ATONEMENT is a novel of character in which true, vivid but bleak emotions are always in play.  <br />The book is divided into three distinct sections:  the first deals with a British family at their great home, much like E.M. Forster might have written; the second part which takes place several years later during World War 2 takes us to France and part three is in 1999 and we are returned to the family home at a birthday party for one of the three leading characters, a celebrated novelist, who, during her childhood committed a crime so cruel that she has spent her entire life looking for some sort of atonement.<br />The depiction of the horrors of war in the second part of this novel is the most shattering I've ever read mainly because of McEwan's varied and specific details dealing with the lives of several soldiers retreating after a major defeat.  One of these soldiers has been wrongly imprisoned for the crime in part one.  Every other character is new to the reader, but fully and beautifully developed.  Every section, every single page is so filled with life, both good and bad, romantic and villainous, nostalgic and adventure-laden that one cannot help but read and be thrilled at McEwan's control and mastery.  <br />This is absolutely a book to treasure.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B000065V41|5.0|This is an absolutely superb movie.  It balances a sincere story with absurd Muppet hilarity with incredible skill.  My only wish for it now is to have a widescreen version.  The VHS \\"full screen\\" version reduces the camera work to the point that it looks like a camera-wielding hamster could have done better.  There are always cropped Muppets lurking at the edges of the screen.  Come on Disney! Get your act together.  Two versions, double sided, whatever ... just hurry up with a widescreen version.
B000006TSC|4.0|More gorgeous easy listening from the guys. &quot;Breathless&quot; is a GORGEOUS love song, &quot;Echoes&quot; an all-time Camel Classic, &quot;Down on the Farm&quot; a kind of British answer to Joe Walsh's &quot;Life's Been Good,&quot; &amp; &quot;Summer Lightning&quot; (Dspite the outdated disco beat) has some VERY nice lyrics &amp; vocals by former Caravan bassist Richard Sinclair. Other tracks R pleasant if not stunning: &quot;Wing and a Prayer,&quot; &quot;Starlight Ride,&quot; &quot;Rainbow's End&quot; (which Cms 2 bid farewell 2 Andy Latimer &amp; Peter Bardens' songwriting partnership), &amp; &quot;The Sleeper&quot; (which includes some more &quot;progressive&quot; sounds that the band's older fans probly prefer). Nice guitar work by Latimer of course, &amp; good sax &amp; flute by former King Crimson member Mel Collins. Pleasant if not earthshaking, the Ntire 1st side flows real well. ...But I admit I can't STAND &quot;You Make Me Smile&quot; on Side 2, the album's only COMPLETELY worthless track....
B000003TA4|5.0|This is one of the best Cd's that I have ever heard.Songs such as Teen Spirit,In Bloom,Come As You Are,and Lithium make this Cd a classic.If you don't own it,you should get it today.
B000006XDX|4.0|True, Andy Latimer's the only REAL Camel guy on it, but this album is unfairly dumped-on by Camel fans. The whole 2nd side is gorgeous, especially \\"Sasquatch\\" & \\"A Heart's Desire/End Peace,\\" \\"Manic\\" is an Xtremely angry-sounding tale of schizophrenia, & \\"Camelogue\\" & \\"Today's Goodbye\\" R at least pleasant & intresting. The 1st side's more of a problem: \\"No Easy Answer\\" is OK, & \\"Heroes\\" is nice ... but the rest IS a significant drop-off in quality from previous albums. So play the 2nd side, Njoy the guest work by Peter Bardens & Anthony Phillips, & take it 4 what it is -- perhaps not as \\"progressive\\" as the band's hard-core fans would like, but still real nice. I think Latimer held-up pretty well under the commercial pressure from his record company. This is as good as the earlier BREATHLESS and I CAN SEE YOUR HOUSE FROM HERE, if not as solid as SNOW GOOSE or NUDE....

From a range of Soul to R&amp;B, this album is a good cd fo ya to chill out. <br />From the first single Video and the irresistible Brown Skin, Ms Arie had did what Stevie Wonder did to his classic albums. The standout tracks include Nature, Strength Courage Wisdom, I See God In You, Wonderful (A dedication to her WONDEFUL Stevie Wonder) and the best of all is READY FOR Love. <br />READY FOR Love is a song that stays in ya mind and get stuck to it and you can't stop listenin to it, her voice is simply addictive and soulful, a woman talkin love, offering her voice, her eyes, her soul and her mind to prove that she READY FOR Love.<br />Thinkin of this year Grammy, many people thinks that she's is being robbed of her award, she got 7 nom for her album but she went home empty handed. Most of her award went to the hand of Ms Alicia Keys. I own both their LP and both have their own talent but i think that India Arie deserve the award more than A keys.

B000065U1N|3.0|\\"Black Hawk Down\\" the movie is similar to the events - it ends with a \\"okay, but what was the POINT?\\" feeling.  The book does not much explore the political context and situation in the U.S. (which the author ackowledges, and which isn't the point of the book), but the  film ignores it completely, except for one comment about Washington turning down a request for \\"AC 130 Spectre gunships and light armor\\" (which, by the way, President Clinton was open to but, being hamstrung by a resistant Republican congress, decided against, which the author ackowledges would have increased civilian casualties, particulary the gunship). The film also gives short shrift to the few Somali stories Mark Bowden included in his book.  Seeing the Somali man who picked up his rifle and went out after Americans after seeing his brother shot down by a bullet from one of the American convoys would have added some balance.  By ignoring the political context and some of the events of the next few days, such as the dragging of American bodies through the streets and the negotiations for the captured pilot, the film does come off as jingoistic.  <br />But, since I paid a measely $ used for the disk, and it has great action sequences and matches \\"Private Ryan\\" for war realism, I know I'll watch this one more than once.<br />
B000002L7J|4.0|Although The Queen Is Dead is almost universally cited as being the best album from The Smiths, Meat Is Murder, while perhaps not as polished and refined - being a bit more raw and free-form - I find to be, in most respects, superior. On The Queen Is Dead, The Smiths, in particular with regards to their music, managed to craft finely-wrought pop songs (Cemetery Gates, The Boy With The Thorn In His Side); on this album, however, the songs are much more raw and rocking, while also exhibiting a huge jump in scope from their debut album. On that album, the music was quite simplistic and seemed to function mainly as background noise for the vocals. Meat Is Murder is quite different. As is evident from the driving intro of the very first song, The Headmaster Ritual, as well as on others (Rusholme Ruffians, How Soon Is Now), Johnny Marr constructed a dense web of guitars, with some great backing from one of rock's most criminally underrated bassists, Andy Rourke. The arrangements even veer toward the epic on such keyboard-laden tracks as the closing title song. Also, lyrically, this album is a major advance from the debut. Morrissey's lyrics here exhibited much of the teen angst that would come to define him and The Smiths for many people, particularly on The Queen Is Dead and on many of their singles. Also, whereas the first album contained some social commentary (Suffer Little Children), it is in quite full force here, as we have songs dealing with: corporal punishment and education (The Headmaster Ritual); domestic punishment and child abuse (Barbarism Begins At Home); and, in a blatantly over-the-top song that many, including myself, dub as a mistake, the title track (its name leaves little doubt as to the content.) Last but not least, one cannot write a legitimate review of this album without mentioning How Soon Is Now?, a track, with its throbbing melody and utterly hopeless lyrics, may well be the best The Smiths ever recorded. An essential disc for fans of the band.
B00005QFE5|5.0|This is an incredible moving film.  Given the limited dialogs in this film, the director managed to convey the leading character's emotions. <br />I highly recommend this DVD.  I watched it for a second time and cried just as much...
B00003CXC6|5.0|Throughout the film you will be amazed at how far ahead of it's time it's film making experience was.  The extra material on this dvd fills you in on that. It's almost as if it set the new standards of film-making and furthered the process of film-watching itself.  While the film is decidely Japanese, it allows you to experience the story from several seperate views (including the views of the camera itself)- this is classic film-making at it's zenith. The characters also play a vital role in the dynamics of the film (and audience perspectives) by representing all aspects of society itself.  It also underlines the fact of &quot;what is truth?&quot; and &quot;who is right?&quot; in modern society.  Without overstating the facts, it draws you in to understand the characters themselves.  It's ending is also a desperate attempt for truth in the individual and hope in man accepting his own confused existance.  And so the setting of a court case is most fitting and its dynamics allow you to see all of it's seperate parts (including the jury and witnesses and audience within the court room).  It's almost as if your watching a play about a play.  The camera work is also the second director in the movie.  This movie is a must for any serious film-watcher.
014118213X|5.0|I have read Howard's End two or three times and listened to it once on tape and it remains one of my favorite novels. Many people were introduced to it by the film, which, good though it was, does not begin to capture the subtle wisdom Forster put into this book. Howard's End can be seen as a quaint period piece about British culture in the early Twentieth Century. On another level, however, it's a brilliant exploration of the human soul. In the Schlegels and the Wilcoxes, Forster has created the perfect embodiment of the eternal conflict between reason and passion. These two families, destined to be united by the marriage of Margaret Schlegel to Henry Wilcox, represent two seemingly irreconcilable aspects of humanity. The Schlegels are artistic, intellectual and impractical; the Wilcoxes materialistic and unapologetically bourgeois. Margaret and Henry have their differences, but it is their relatives who display the more extreme family traits. Margaret's sister Helen is a classic bohemian; Henry's son Charles is a humorless and intolerant banker. As the novel unfolds, the two families are forced to confront each other and decide whether to ultimately part company or compromise. What is most impressive to me about the novel is the naturalness and grace with which the story unfolds. When an author uses characters to embody universal qualities, it is quite a challenge to make the people and story real and not merely symbols. Howard's End succeeds brilliantly as both a thoroughly engaging novel and a rather profound metaphysical inquiry.
B00005YU1O|1.0|While &quot;Waking Life&quot; is truly visually innovative, its animation is truly lost on the surplus of dialogue that fills the movie.  The dream-like segues between conversations are certainly the high points of the film, if the hapless movie-goer can stay awake through the proselytizing, pretentious, overly trendy and post-modern pseudo-philosophy.
B00005JKNC|5.0|Usually people that call themselves a critic are usually want-to-be actors. Need i say more about this.I'm not a big Jim Carrey fan, but it seems like an aging bottle of really fine, rare wine he continues to get better acting roles and in turn his acting continues to excell. I've read alot about the guy and have been extremely impressed with him as a person and actor.Yes, this movie might be a toss-back to the 50's but it's good, pure, clean fun. What is wrong with that. Has our acting ability being judged on sex or talent?  In this film it's being judged on talent and Jim Carrey has it.This is a delightful movie you can take you mother to see. It's funny, witty, emotional and that adds up to \\"Entertainment.\\"
B000066I6N|4.0|This album is lush.  Win My Train Fare Home is the sexiest song that I've heard in a while.  John Lee Hooker (RIP) would be jealous of the delivery of the Crawlin' Kingsnake bits.
B00003CXAE|4.0|I really do like this movie. I've seen it several times and the 5.1 stereo sound is more than wonderful. The acting is very very good and the talent from every actor is exceptional and i'm a big fan of everyone in this really great musical.But,,,,,the stage production is 100 times better.  For some reason the movie just went \\"to\\" Hollywood and it didn't have to. The Broadway version captured everything that it needed and all these extras were not really needed in the movie.  Just once i wish Hollywood would take course 101 in \\"Theatre.\\"  Maybe we could get better directors, better producers.  Again the film is great but if you have a chance to ever see the Broadway version do yourself a favor. Then write me back and tell me what you thought.   I know you'll be more than impressed.  At least Michael Douglas from \\"Chorus Line\\" isn't in this. Never-the-less this DVD is still worth the price.

B00004Y6RO|5.0|I've known about Slipknot since about when they first debuted. At the time, I was probably only 9 or 10 and I hated them. I was big into Limp Bizkit & Puff Daddy and all that (God forbid), but my brother liked them. He has the original version (the one with \\"Purity\\" and \\"Frail Limb Nursery\\" on it), but if you ask me, this version's better. His version (also a Digipak) has 19 songs, and this has 20. (Not counting the hidden tracks.) Just a few months ago, I got into Slipknot, and bought \\"Iowa\\". Awesome. Then, I bought this. My favorite. Possibly one of the greatest albums ever recorded...<br />1.03974834698365309 (Whatever it's called)-5/5-I know it's just an intro, but it's pretty cool. The people just repeat \\"The whole thing I think is sick\\" over and over, but it's a good opening.<BR>2.(Sic)-5/5-The first REAL song on the album, \\"(Sic)\\" is a hard, heavy song from beginning to end. Joey's drumming really shows off here.<BR>3.Eyeless-5/5-A great song. I like the whole thing, the lyrics, the music, especially the bridge with just th music for about 10 seconds. And, just a fun fact, the band got \\"you can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes\\" when they were in Hollywood, where some psycho guy was sitting on the street yelling it at all the people. (That's at least what I heard...)<BR>4.Wait & Bleed-4/5-If you're not a fan of Slipknot, but you've heard them, and someone said their name, \\"I've felt the hate rise up in me...\\" would probably be the first thing you'd think of. A lot of people are familar with this song. It's great, but it gets old.<BR>5.Surfacing-3/5-This is a lot of people's favorite song, but not mine. Not much really stands out about it (besides the chorus). The singing's kind of dull, and it's just overall not that great.<BR>6.Spit It Out-5/5-This is a quieter song, but it's very fast. Very catchy. Here's something I don't get...MTV banned this video because it was \\"Satanic\\", BUT they can play a video with Marilyn Manson reinacting President Kennedy's death...WEIRD.<BR>7.Tattered & Torn-2/5-I don't know what's up with this song, but it's very weird. The lyrics are the only thing that keeps me from giving it a 0, because I love them. Very haunting.<BR>8.Me Inside-5/5-This is a different song from the rest on the album. Not that much screaming in this one. It's very depressing. I always listen to it when I'm mad.<BR>9.Liberate-4/5-Another cool song. It reminds me a lot of \\"Surfacing\\" (though it dosen't sound that much like it), but it's better. <BR>10.Prosthetics-0/5-I can't pronounce the title of this song, and I always skip it. I'm not sure if it's supposed to be a real song or what, but I don't like it.<BR>11.No Life-4/5-Like \\"Surfacing\\", not much stands out about this song. The onlt thing that does is the bridge (\\"I can't remember, I don't understand this...\\") and KIND OF the chorus (\\"'Cause this is NO KIND...\\"), but it's worth listening to.<BR>12.Diluted-3/5-Another weird song. The verses are slow and eerie, and you can tell Craig had to do a thousand samples on this. The song does get boring after the first two verses.<BR>13.Only One-3/5-OK, this song is pretty strange all together. They're trying to make the verses rhyme, but they just sound like a rap song WITHOUT rhymes that was slopped together in 5 seconds. I do like the lyrics for \\"only one of us wals away\\".<BR>14.Scissors-0/5-See #10.<BR>15.Get This-4/5-This is a funny song, in which Corey screams about the things he hates. It rocks, even if it dosen't make much sense.<BR>16.Spit It Out (Hyper Version)-5/5-Better than the original. he music flat-out kicks ... on this, and you have to bounce your head. Awesome.<BR>17.Wait & Bleed (Terry Date Mix)-3/5-This is an exact replica of track #4 (music wise), but the singing is actully...singing. Which ... up the song.<BR>18.Interloper (Demo)-3/5-This is somewhat of a demo to \\"Diluted\\", and they replaced the verses and chorus (and pretty much everything) with different stuff. <BR>19.Despise-3/5-This is ademo for \\"Purity\\", which, as I said before, was on the original versions of this album. I'd give it a 4, but, compared to the real \\"Purity\\", it's a 3.<BR>20.Surfacing (Live)-4/5-The album dosen't really need a live track, but, here it is, a live version of \\"Surfacing\\", and it's better than the studio, basically because you can see what energy the put into their shows.<BR>(I won't review the hidden tracks because I don't wanna run outta room, but I will tell ya that the 1st hidden track's a 3/5 & \\"Eyeore\\" is a 2/5.)<br />If you like Mudvayne, Mushroomhead, System of a Down, Korn, or Slayer, you should check out Slipknot.
B00005YW4H|4.0|I had heard \\"Don't know Why\\" on the radio and fell in love with it, but I have a hard time making my self spend money, particularly on CDs.  I decided to check the CD out from my local library to see if I would like it, and boy did I ever!  I listen to it everytime I am home, and am dreading returning it to the library on Friday, so guess what, I'm going to go buy it, and you should to!  It's incredible, think Diana Krall mixed with Sheryl Crow! She's got such good pure quality in her voice and she matched it up with awesome musicians that bring out the very best in her.  If you buy this CD , you'll love it...I did!

I have to say that &quot;Popsicle Toes&quot; is my absolute favorite.  Actually my Dad purchased this CD and he made me a copy because he thought I would like it.  I didn't even listen to it for a year, because I had a lot going on in my life and then I moved and misplaced my CD case.  I finally found it about 6 months ago and decided to give it a chance, and I am so glad I did.  I would be very upset to lose this CD again. Anyone who buys it will be glad that they did.
630460291X|1.0|This review is purely about the DVD, not the movie. It's an old run, and hence is a two-sided disc.

0142002038|4.0|Dr. No was one of my most favorite James Bond books. I read this book on a plane ride to England of all places. I was most pleased with the return of James Bond, and dispite what others say, in From Russia with Love it is plausable for Bond to have survived. The only problem I had with the book is the inconsistent writing style of Ian Fleming. He often tosses in foreign words without explanation of what they mean. But if you like James Bond, pick up Ian Fleming's Dr. No.
B00005JLKB|5.0|I really love this series.

B000069HKH|5.0|I've always heard of Bruce and some of his earlier hits, but was never really a fan, not because he wasn't talented, but simply because my tastes never crossed his path.  That all changed when I saw him perform live in NYC on HBO after reuniting with E-Street - I went out the next day and bought the double CD set of that concert and listened to it everyday for two months straight!  Following Live in NYC, I was excited to learn that he and E-Street had done a new album, The Rising.  When I first listened to The Rising, I was somewhat disappointed because I felt the disc failed to display the diverse musical brilliance of E-Street.  However, after listening to the album a few more times it is plain to see that the simplictic lyrics and views regarding 9/11 don't need loads of melodic keyboards and wailing guitars.  Rather, the style perfectly accomadates the brilliant lyrics.  It's raw, yet perfectly crafted delivering a spectrum of emotions that we all felt regarding 9/11, from death and sorrow to rising up and moving on.  This album is a perfect way for Americans and the world to reflect and deal with the 9/11 tragedies without having the all of the sorrow and pain shoved down our throats.  Given the ground work of the album and the tragedies that inspire it, you may not listen to it everyday or even every month - but like all medicine, you'll know it's there when you need it.  And you'll gladly take it.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Drop everything and go buy Room for Squares by John Mayer. I picked it up against my better judgment. I was hesitant due to the top-forty single it spawned which is anomalous since it's neither booty-dance junk nor pappy .... I would characterize John Mayer as a band ...that, despite impending commercial success, has yet to abandon his band .. essence. If the band ... details are foggy, refer to Robert Klein - Child of the 50's - side one - for remediation. His band ... platform manifests itself in the CD title (see above) and the periodic table of the elements that comprises the artwork on the CD. Not to worry though, there is no mention of Bill Nye in the liner notes and no lyrical interpretation of the acid-salt reduction process.<br />The album is apparently directed toward survivors of the 80's replete with shameless Sting/Police references and an overall jazzy Velvet Underground/Elvis Costello feel but with a notably higher IQ. A cursory review of the lyrics exposes a mordant repartee on the average human condition (read - no Bret Easton Ellis plotlines) stopping just short of political rhetoric and just enough testosterone-ridden \\"Bring the lovin'\\" overtures. Like any other album to which I've conferred an ounce of respect, there is no over-production and it's clear that the output of this project was not intended as a series of value-meals that are easily digestible by Nielson raters in three minutes and fifty-two seconds.<br />Aside from the album, John's minimalist, live delivery is sprinkled with self deprecating humor that is founded in the endeavor of a critically-Caucasian creature pursuing a soulful life with some feeble notion of rhythm driven entirely by the female race. It's no wonder that I found the substance of his work so accessible. His wonderbread-white wit is exemplified in the ever popular, Bobby Brown, Count Chocula, oat to marshmallow ratio introduction for the live performance of Your Body is Wonderland. Bottom line, drop fifteen quid on Room for Squares, it's money well spent.n Room for Squares, it's money well spent.
B00004WGAI|3.0|It almost ruined the book for me. <br />Yes, I know it's the most complete, authentic adaptation of the story, and I appreciate that. I hate the way Hollywood versions have Jane returning to Gateshead instead of Moor House, cut Diana and Mary out the story, etc. They also tried for a set closer to the Thornfield described in the book, rather than the overdone gothic castle set used in Hollywood versions, and I liked that as well.<br />However, the problem for me was with Dalton and Zelah Clarke. Separately they each had their strong points, but together they just didn't make &quot;Jane and Rochester.&quot;<br />I think my biggest problem was Dalton. I'm not a huge fan, to begin with. And he's far too handsome for Rochester, though I could forgive that for an actor who really fit the part. <br />He got some things right: he knows how to play an English gentleman; he captured Rochester's sardonic edge and  worldliness. However, I never felt Dalton quite connected with the character. Or perhaps a multi-layered portrayal was beyond him. <br />For the record, I have never seen Rochester as a ranter and growler. (Dalton, to his credit, didn't do much of that.) Yes, he can be dangerous, but I don't see that as his usual style. He is intelligent, with a vivid, almost poetic imagination. The actor who plays him should be able to convey that. Should, in fact, be the kind of actor who knows his way around a line of Shakespeare. One of the Fiennes brothers, let's say. <br />Dalton just doesn't have that, and that ruined many of his scenes for me. It ruined the basis for his connection with Jane. Both are intense, imaginative people. Take the climactic scene where they declare their love: It should be passionate, it should be charged. In this movie, it's so low key I was almost bored. Rather than ranting, Mr.Dalton erred to the other extreme.<br />Now when I think of those scenes in the book, I hear again how they were done in the movie, almost spoiling how I have imagined it. Ugh!<br />Another problem is the matching of the handsome, charismatic Dalton with an ordinary looking Jane. This doesn't generate believable chemistry. Maybe if they had connected intellectually, it would have worked better.<br />Ms. Clarke does have the intelligence, and she has the strength Jane should have, though she didn't make a particularly memorable Jane, and Jane needs a kind of charisma, too.<br />And Rochester, of course, is not supposed to be handsome. Every time Dalton refers to himself as &quot;hideous&quot; or &quot;ugly&quot; it sounds ridiculous. If they had to cast a man with movie star looks, they could at least have cut those lines.<br />I bought the movie sight unseen because I knew it was faithful to the book, but I've since found that's not everything. My advice: rent before you buy.
B00005YU1O|1.0|...<br />The first 10 minutes of the DVD contain some good \\"rotoscope\\" style animation -- at once intriguing and engaging.  And then the seasickness kicks in.  Perhaps using the queasiness engendered by the Blair Witch Project as a model, some of the animators seemed determined to conceal their attempts at art under a panopoly of discordant visual stimuli.  Who knows whether their attempts at art was successful?  <br />It is unviewable.<br />Like the \\"computer newbie\\" who's discovered different fonts, effects, and colors in a word-processing package, and seems to have sworn out a vendetta on white space, several of the animators use the Macintosh-hosted animation application to make their own work unwatchable.  Not content with the camera movement that the hand-held digital video backdrop provides, several of the animators place 'their' segment's background on multiple layers, each of which has been configured to rock back and forth -- out-of-synch with the others.  This completely unnatural effect will give you an eyeache, at the very least.  Persevere at your own peril.  You will be probably be rewarded with a splitting headache, and no comprehension of the animator's message, if you try to bear it out (as I must ruefully admit to having tried to do).<br />The animation application itself, the subject of a very good documentary -- shot with a tripod-mounted camera -- is very rich in functionality and has been developed to be useful for a broad range of users' talent-levels.  So what ...  I can only wish several of the animators had been forced to take lessons.  The ease of use of a camera, the interface of the application used for F/X in the Jurrasic Park movies, the difficulties trapping colors in blue-screen effects, and other technical issues should be concealed from the viewer.  <br />The producers of this film forgot this critical element.<br /><<NOTE TO ASPIRING FILMMAKERS:  Just because something can be done with an application, and just because someone else hasn't done that thing in the past with an application, doesn't make everything done with an application necessarily good.>>  <br /><<COROLLARY ONE TO NOTE:  Just because something is unwatchable, doesn't make it art.>>  <br /><<COROLLARY TWO TO NOTE:  Even if your work is art, wrapping it in sloppy application window-dressing will make your art indistinguishable from garbage.>><br />Don't waste your money on this one!!<br />...Please, please, don't waste your money on this one!

6305308659|4.0|Let's start with the major flaw in this movie, just to get it over with.  Whoever had the bright idea of attempting to correlate the premise of this film with the treatment of blacks in 50's and 60's America got it wrong.  It just doesn't fit, and detracts from what is otherwise an artistic and inspired dance on an interesting idea.  Thankfully, they don't push the analogy too far, so, in the end, in only mildly spoils the film.<br />But, let's get to the good stuff.  The central idea is that life in a 50's sitcom isn't very fulfilling for the people involved--only they don't know it yet.  Indeed, the characters in Pleasantville, a television series that never was, but could have been, live in blissful ignorance.  Ignorance of what, however?  You see, to this day, there are people who actually continue to believe that blissful ignorance is as good as bliss, and that it's okay to be happily unaware of a number of things that some of us believe might actually be the key to happiness--creativity, passion, curiousity, and raw emotion.  For the characters in Pleasantville, there are no surprises.  Dinner will always be waiting at six.  The counters will always get set with forks and knives before the french fries are cooked.<br />In other words, Pleasantville presents the idealized comfort of a world where everything has a place, and where everything is always in its place.  False comfort, in other words, and one which we sometimes dream about when facing the uncertainties, rejection, alienation, and anomie that sometimes comes along with being an ordinary human being with no idea of what lies beyond the next door, or whether that cute girl or guy might actually give us the time of day --or be a drug addict with a penchant for animal cruelty. (After all, it is that kind of world we live in--but don't worry about this movie treading such uncomfortable terrain. The movie doesn't need to go that far for us to get the picture.)<br />In many respects, this is a Garden of Eden allegory.  There's even a scene where Tobey Maguire's character gets fed the veritable apple--although I didn't think it was right that he should be doing the eating.  It seemed an unnecessary bit of sloppiness, or an unnecessary juxtaposition.  If any one is the serpent here, it's Tobey and his sister, played with relish, finesse, and flair by Reece Witherspoon.  Witherspoon is one of those actresses who, no matter what you think on first glimpse, has the ability to transform into a beautiful woman.  Frankly, there simply is a lot going on under her skin, and that, I think, has much to do with it.<br />So, the movie asks, what might happen if the serenity of Pleasantville were disturbed by a little of our reality?  And, likewise, what might a shallow, slutty girl of our world learn from a bit of Pleasantville?  It answers those questions entertainingly and lightly, but still with a bit of depth that is more than one comes to expect from mainstream movies.  Certainly, this movie won't shake your world, but it may make you pause to think about what is meaningful, and what isn't, while entertaining you with cleverness and visual beauty.<br />The movie could have--and maybe should have--gotten a bit more gritty.  The color brought to Pleasantville could have brought more pain, but no matter.  It works and is, in the end, a very pleasant diversion.f Eden allegory.

B000063DGC|5.0|This is one of my favorite live albums, regardless of the artist.  Released in 1987, this is an excellent tribute to Randy Rhoads, who was definitely a great guitarist, which was extremely evident in Blizzard of Ozz and Diary of a Madman.  Since I love those two albums, I thought it would be neat to hear music from the tours of that era.  This is definitely not disappointing.  I have also heard Live &amp; Loud as well as Live at Budokan.  This is my favorite, partly because of the material.  The version of Crazy Train is one of the best.  Although I would have liked to have heard more from Diary of a Madman (mainly Over the Mountain, Little Dolls, S.A.T.O. and the title track), this is still excellent as a whole.  I can't exactly name which are my favorite tracks since they are all great.  I also like the Black Sabbath covers.  I would definitely recommend this.
0790729377|2.0|It's hard to believe that in this day and age, a DVD company can release a &quot;pan and scan&quot; version of the Director's cut of a classic vintage film. But, they did! Although the restored footage fills in many details that were left out of the original release, and is truer to the original Tennessee Williams play, I couldn't help but feel disapointed and cheated that I could not watch the original full screen version. In addition to the screen format, this DVD also lacks additional special features that could have made it superb.
B000002B7M|5.0|While I have probably said other Ozzy albums are his best, when I listened to this in whole today, I have to say this is my ultimate favorite.  Although Black Sabbath's music is excellent as well, Ozzy made a wonderful choice when he decided to go solo.  Choosing Randy Rhoads as his guitarist was also another great choice.  Together, they made this album flawless.  Every single song is great.  My favorites are: I Don't Know, Crazy Train, Suicide Solution, Mr. Crowley, No Bone Movies and Steal Away (The Night).  Definitely start here if you're a new fan.  I would recommend this to anyone.

The plot, while simple, is also touching, making it one of the best movies to watch after a bad day in the big, bad, adult world.  Everyone needs a laugh, even us grown-ups.<br />However, I'm shocked that this isn't on DVD.  Wait, no, appalled.  Here I sit, with money burning a hole in my pocket, and I love this movie.  I don't buy VHS anymore.  But, I guess I'll just have to wait until the studio exec people remember this little $100 million plus box-office grossing film needs a DVD!!
6305308659|5.0|Count me as one Christian (Episcopalian) who loved the movie. <br />I would rate this up there with the \\"Last Temptation of Christ\\" in its theological exploration. <br />...<br />The townsfolk of Pleasantville live seemingly idyllic lives that are without pain, suffering, crime or any other kind of evil. Everything happens the way it is supposed to and their is no world beyond their town. But they also are emotionally stunted, superficial and unable to think for themselves. They follow a script and have no free will or ability to think for themselves. They have not been exposed to anything beyond their myopic existences. <br />The God character (played by Don Knotts) transports Bud and and Peggy Sue (serpent figure??) into this world. They begin introducing those around them to both good, evil and knowledge (art and literature). The townspeople learn to make moral choices and learn the realities of real joy and real pain and evil.<br />As this occurs, their eyes are opened, they learn free will they and are transformed from (literally and metaphorically) black-and-white to colour. As this occurs, the physical world around them changes. The basketball players don't always make their shots. The weather isn't always perfect. Trees catch on fire. But creation becomes coloured as well. Perhaps the imperfection of creation is necessary for those within it to be truly human.<br />It's a brilliant exploration of the concepts that Genesis 1 introduces. Was the fall and free will and the potential for evil necessary for us to gain our full humanity? That is a question I've wondered for a while.<br />Those Christians who call this anti-values or anti-Christian don't seem to have the gift of subtlety. Peggy Sue doesn't turn colour until she TURNS DOWN the offer to have sex with Skip and spends the night studying and learning to think outside her particular box. Not everyone at Lover's Lane is colour, but those who have emotional connections with their spouses do.<br />...P>ButI do recommend this movie for those people of any faith who like to wrestle with theological and moral concepts. It might even be a good movie to use as a start for theological discussion for Jewish, Unitarian and Christian small groups. If you like to think and ponder, watch this.
B00005JKCH|5.0|THE PREVEIWS LOOKED COOL. BUT THE MOVIE WAS COOLER. THERE WAS SO MUCH ACTION. ANYONE WHO LOVES THE COMIC SHOULD LOVE THE MOVIE.PEOPLE WHO THINK STAR WARS WAS BETTER WAS WRONG. THIS MOVIE WAS A MASTERPIECE IN EVERY ASPECT.THE STORYLINE WAS FLAWLESS. THE SPECIAL EFECTS BLUE ME AWAY. I ADVISE YOU TO SEE THIS MOVIE.
0316666343|4.0|This is not typically the kind of book I read however I found it interesting having been written from the perspective of a 14 year old girl who had been murdered, watching down on earth from her heaven.  Her family and friends trying to pick up the pieces and the police trying to find her murderer.  Definitely a nice change of pace and one I would recommend to my friends.
B0000508U6|1.0|I cannot say that I have heard an album so soft and &quot;fluffy&quot; to be called any type of rock. This is Brit pop garbage.
B00005QZWI|5.0|There is no better recommendation I can give than that. I knew the plot before going in, yet Fellowship of the Ring kept me on the edge of my seat. Was it because of the special effects? No, though they were superb. Or the monsters, like the huge cave troll that attacks the Fellowship in Balin's tomb, or better yet, the immense balrog, a fiery monster as colossal as a small skyscraper? No. It is because of the almost hopeless and insane mission the free peoples undertake to defeat their Enemy. <br />As powerful as the elves and their human allies were, their might paled when measured against the overwhelming magic of Sauron, the Lord of the Rings. His armies were powerful and numerous beyond belief, yet Frodo, Gandalf, and the rest of the Fellowship undertook an almost hopeless task- to take the One Ring into Mordor and fling it into the fires of Mount Doom, the only way they had to destroy the ring. Why? Using the Ring themselves would only set up another Dark Lord, thus propagating the insidious evil of a blackened and brooding god. (Who? His name is Morgoth, just in case you're wondering. Read Tolkien's Silmarillion to find out more!) The Ring HAD to be destroyed, not used... and the only way to get to Mount Doom was a long and incredibly dangerous trek through dozens and dozens of miles of enemy territory. Frodo, the innocent nephew of Bilbo Baggins, was the being chosen to carry through this task. The world was against him and his fellow warriors... yet they follow through with their mission. Imagine this- the only way to defeat the armies of Hitler was for three virtually unarmed men to walk through Germany, straight into the heart of his power- and destroy the magic talisman that kept him alive and empowered his armies. Hopeless? Yes. But it had to be done.<br />Howard Shore's music captures the ebullient spirit of the hobbits, the steadfast bravery of Boromir and Aragorn, and the hideously dangerous power and malice of Sauron, the Dark Lord, creator of the One Ring, whose immense magic would enable him to rule the world. And once he regained his treasure, taken from him by Isildur, thousands of years before, Sauron would rule for thousands of years. Very likely, tens of thousands, all the while mashing freedom and justice into paste under his iron fist and implacable evil. Shore's music for Sauron is a constant thread running throughout this intense movie. It's Satanic in its evil and magnificent in its awesome power. The music demands a great deal from the listener- who or what can stand against this evil? <br />The bravery, the love, the sheer humanity of the united peoples are what stand steadfast against the Satanic power of Sauron. Howard Shore's score brings that bravery into the light again and again, thus re-affirming the hopes of the free peoples. When Boromir tries to take the Ring by force, we feel Frodo's fear of his onetime human ally... yet, Boromir redeems himself, giving his life in fierce combat with Saruman's Uruk Hai, the abominable crosses between men and orcs Saruman, the supposed ally of the free peoples, made by means of a rotten and fell magic. What power there is in this scene! And Howard Shore's music sears it into the soul. This is followed by Enya's haunting May It Be, which moves me to tears every time I listen to it. As some of the other reviewers noted, this is not a score to relax by, though it does have its lighter moments. It is, however, a score which delves deeply into the spirit of humanity, even in non-human creatures (Hobbits, Dwarves, Elves, and Ents. These last should be in The Two Towers and The Return of the King.) and the timeless evil of tyrannical monsters, like Saruman and Sauron. The sound is excellent, just in case you have been living on Mars and haven't seen the movie.
0380778556|5.0|Rebecca is one of the BEST books I have ever read.  When I read this book I got SO involved, it was like I was apart of the book in a way.  Once you start reading it you can never put the book down.  There is not one boring part in the book, it just keeps getting better and better.  After reading Rebecca I highly reccomend reading the sequal from Susan Hill &quot;Mrs. De Winter&quot;, that book was great also, it tells you how the late Mrs. De Winter and Mr. De Winter end up and what happens and also a chilling ending just like &quot;Rebecca&quot;. I guarentee you will enjoy these two books.
B00006F2TV|5.0|Spider-Man, which grossed nearly 600 million worldwide, is a fantastic roller coaster ride. The directing and fight scenes are amazing, the villains and story are gripping, and the whole thing is a classic. It is probably the year's biggest hit and it's finally coming out on DVD! Now, you can own 2002's greatest hit. A sequel for this box-office-blockuster has been set for 2004 and just in case you missed the first, now you have a chance to not only see but own a sensational, entertaining, and fantastic hit! Tobey Maguire does a fine job as Peter Parker, the dorky high-school kid who gets bitten by a genetically enhanced spider during a science expiremement. He is amazed to discover that the bites gives him spider abilities, such as web-slinging, climbing, and having a spider-sense which warns you of danger.. However, after a deadly experiment makes Peter's best friend Harry's (James Franco) father into a sick villain called the Green Goblin, Spider-Man is forced to take on his enemy. Also featured is Kirsten Dunst, who is Peter's next door neighbor Mary Jane, the only girl that he has ever loved. The movie features many great action sequences with some great special effects and a good cast featuring Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn, the man who turns into the sadistic Green Goblin. The DVD is jam packed with features such as commentary by director Sam Raimi, actress Kirsten Dunst, producer Laura Ziskin, co-producer Grant Curtis and special effects designer John Dykstra. It also has two music videos: Hero by Chad Kroeger of Nickelback featuring Josey Scott of Saliva and What We're All About by Sum 41. It has a Making of Documentary and a historical documentary called Spider Man: The Mythology of the 21st Century. It also features gags and outtakes, costume and makeup tests, and an E! Special on Spider-Mania. Get this movie on DVD because of the special features and please buy the full-screen version. I don't understand why people like widescreen. I don't like when 1/4of the top and bottom of my screen is cut off so they can only techinally watch \\"half\\" of the movie. <br />Time: 124 minutes (something like that)<BR>Rated PG-13 for some fight sequences
B000002UB3|5.0|The medley alone makes this one the greatest albums of all time.  If you're into the radio hits, it has plenty for you to enjoy.  From \\"Come Together\\", \\"Something\\", \\"Here comes the Sun\\", and \\"Oh Darling\\" to the lesser known gems like \\"Golden Slumbers/Carry that weight/The end\\", this album takes you through the first big breakup of a rock n' roll band and how the music only got better because of it.  A lot of people claim that \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" or \\"the White album\\" are their best albums and others claim that \\"Revolver\\" and \\"Rubber Soul\\" are their best albums.  But, if you're not a die-hard Beatles fan who likes obscure music you can only find on a lesser known album, then \\"Abbey Road\\" is the album for you.
B00005JKWJ|4.0|..but it does it's job of entertaining you. Not quite as emotionally involved as the first movie. This one seems to be more of the standard action comic book movie but alot better done than Batman although not quite as good as Spiderman. Picture and extras on the dvd are great. Had no problems and haven't heard of any faulty discs among my friends. Definitely watch the deleted scenes with the commentary on. It's a must for some great laughs although watch out for the little ones if you don't want them hearing some foul language.
B00000J7J7|2.0|Brad Mehldau has rejected comparisons between himself and Bill Evans, going so far as to say that he himself is not particularly fond of Evans' playing.  In listening to Mr. Mehldau, it becomes clear that this is so: the harmonic structure he employs in his chordal playing and development is rather stark and modal.  Where Evans and other pianists employ voicings and inventive use of the left hand, Mehldau is not only predictable but morose and stuck in minor scales completely absent of any interesting key modulation.  This album sounds like a mediocre new age musician trying desparately to play jazz. Another disappointing feature of this ablum is what appears to be an attempt to bring certain classical features to the mix.  At times, it seems as if he wants to sound like Chopin's Nocturnes -- endless runs in minor modes and keys that lack all warmth, reverie, or introspection.  Perhaps Mr. Mehldau ought to give Bill Evans a good listening to in order to learn something.
B00005A1PR|5.0|This is a great cd.  I love the song Promises.  It is easy to listen to and has a great message.  All the tracks are great and relaxing.  I would recommend this cd to anyone looking for some really good, soothing music.

By following Flylady's method, by starting with Babysteps, my home is now a place I look forward to coming home to!  I can even have neighbors over and not worry!

6305470464|3.0|\\"Playing by Heart\\" is a series of vignettes showing different aspects, as well as different kinds, of relationships.  The range is from 40 years of marriage to just meeting someone.  Although these are seemingly different sketches, the whole is related.  About half-way through the movie, key words will appear, which will tip you off that all is part of the one story, or topic, relationships.<br />I had not been a fan of Angelina Jolie until this movie.  With the exception of Connery and Rowland, her performance was the most believable.  Most of the other performances, especially John Stewart's and Gillian Anderson's, did not seem inspired.  It is a little disappointing, but it does not hurt the movie.  My judgment of their performance may be skewed since I have preconceived ideas of how they act.  For Anderson, I can't help thinking of Dana Scully, and for Stewart, I am reminded of his comedy.<br />Not a bad movie, but the movie tips its hand a couple of times.  I was not surprised by the ending because I knew what would happen before it got there (with the exception of Anthony Edwards' character).
B00005Y228|5.0|\\"Fever\\" is an album that isn't too taxing on the brain. The lyrics are fun and delivered well. Kylie has a way about her that just draws you in...<br />1. More More More, is a great way to start off the album with the beginning being \\"Give in, give it up, I just can't get enough...\\" describes this album and it's feel.<br />2. Love At First Sight, this isn't the version that you may have heard out there, in fact I like it better. The US single version is good but I've seen the UK video for this and I it's just so much... well better.<br />3. Can't Get You Out Of My Head, I downloaded this song a long time ago, long before it was released here in the states, and I didn't like it at first however after listening to it and seeing the video what can I say, pardon the pun I just can't get it out of my head.<br />4. Fever, the title track. I love this song, it's just so relaxed and musically simple... still very dancable though.<br />5. Give It To Me, at first it sounds like Britney's Oops I did it again, but then you get more into it and you realize that it's just so much better.<br />6. Fragile, it's the slowest song on the album, and I consider it the weakest, but it's still better then most of what is released out there now.<br />7. Come Into My World, this song is the next single in the UK but it's basically a clone of CGYOOMH, but it lacks more.<br />8. In Your Eyes, WOW, this was released as a single in the UK and should be here! It's just amazing...<br />9. Dancefloor, \\"Gonna lose it in the music\\" I love this song too, it's a fun breakup song.<br />10. Love Affair, I LOVE this song, it's very inviting and very sexy, one of the strongest tracks on the album.<br />11. Your Love, it's a more simple song, relying less on beats and more on vocals, it's very good.<br />12. Burning Up, \\"Down to the disco... I'm burning up baby\\" it starts out very slow and lazy but speeds up quickly, it's just so much fun!<br />(Bonus Tracks)13. Boy, it's a great bonus track and could evenbe a single.<br />14. Butterfly, this was first released on 2000's \\"Light Years\\" album, it's better on that album, and if you don't have that Album I suggest you check it out, it would be an import but it's very worth it.<br />Very danceable album and very catchy and very fun... great to have in any record collection!
0792835050|4.0|The Allies are preparing for the invasion of Normandy and are trying to produce false intelligence to confuse the Nazis.  A spy, living in England, has discovered the falsehood and is trying to contact Hitler to let him know.  In his attempt to escape to Germany, he becomes shipwrecked on a small island.  There, he will meet a frustrated housewife.<br />Set in WWII Britain, the movie sets a good pace for the viewer to follow.  We will follow The Needle, Donald Sutherland, as he escapes numerous traps set for him as he tries to smuggle secret photos out of England.  He will find himself on an island with a drunken lighthouse keeper, a crippled pilot (former), and the pilot's wife and son.  Both the wife and The Needle are isolated; she on the island with a less than affectionate husband, and The Needle, a lone spy in enemy territory.  They feel this connection, but must keep true to their allegiances.<br />This is a good movie, and I recommend watching it.
B00006G8G1|5.0|FINALLY!  An official dvd release of the Best. Metal. Group. Ever.  Two tracks (DTS and standard 5.1) that both will annihilate your stereo system.  I prefer the power of the DTS track myself, but both are wonderfully mixed and clear as a bell.  The beautiful thing is that you can actually pick out all 3 guitar parts individually and clearly.  The extras are fun and give a brief glimpse into the personalities of these 6.  The easter eggs are mostly entertaining, especially the shadow puppet one.<br />While I very much enjoy the cd release of this concert, its the dvd that truly brings out the passion of the band.  Another benefit to the dvd is you get to see the group's quirky and amusing personalities at work, be it goofy interaction with one another or Nicko's Riverdance during the intro of Clansman.  A must-own for any fan, and a must-see for anyone who loves live music.  But be warned...your speakers will never be the same after this.
6304082428|5.0|this movie is the all time romance-love story ever. it'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry and it'll keep you in suspence...i give it 5 stars because it deserves it 100%!
B000003TAR|5.0|'In Utero' is, and probably will always be, the saddest album I have ever listened to. To me, this CD is Kurt Cobain's suicide note. To me, it's his farewell to all Nirvana fans. From start to finish, you will listen to every song in awe. From the beginning clash of \\"Serve The Servants\\" to the sad, yet effective \\"All Apologies,\\" you won't be able to take the headphones off. Personally, I think this album is better than 'Nevermind.' Some of the best songs on this CD are \\"Heart-Shaped Box,\\" \\"Rape Me,\\" \\"Very Ape\\" (also one of my favorite songs), and \\"All Apologies.\\" Even though it's sad, 'In Utero' is a must for every music fan.
B00003CXAE|3.0|Well.... we all know the story. There have been specials on E! and VH1 as well as the original show from 1978 \\"Grease Day USA.\\" BUT, what happened on this much awaited DVD? The menus are silent and motionless and the only extras are an edited version of what VH1 showed as well as the original trailer, which by the way, show two scenes on the beach that were deleted from the movie itself. I was hoping for a commentary, behind the scenes footage, deleted scenes.... But Paramount is not a fan based company. They just deliver products to be consumed and not enjoyed or treasured. HOWEVER, that said, the transfer is okay, falling just slightly below the laserdisc that was released earlier and with the same extras. The widescreen is great to have. And the sound is.... good, although the stereo separation is weak. I'd just wish for more. This being the first of a slew of releases from ..., I'm more likely to rent rather than buy the other releases.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones has a gorgeous, smoldering voice that carries this CD with real authority. Although she obviously needs some maturation when it comes to her own songwriting (&quot;Come Away With Me&quot;, &quot;Nightingale&quot;), her interpretation of other songwriters can be stunning.  My favorites are &quot;Don't Know Why,&quot; &quot;Cold Cold Heart&quot;, &quot;Turn Me On,&quot; and &quot;The Nearness of You.&quot;  As other reviewers have noted, the CD could have used a greater variety of tempos/songs, but Jones's voice is so distinctive and heartfelt that after a few listenings, I hardly cared. My opinion went from four stars to five.<br />While this CD is categorized as jazz, there is a definite country western influence.  Normally, I would be turned off by these undertones, but somehow Jones pulls it off, proving that she is a real talent to watch. I highly recommend this CD if you love female vocalists - jazz, pop, country western - and to be introduced to a singer who will certainly make her mark on the music scene for years to come.
0060264306|5.0|\\"Once upon a time, sixty years ago, a little girl lived in the Big Woods of Wisconsin, in a little gray house made of logs.\\" So begins \\"Little House in the Big Woods,\\" by Laura Ingalls Wilder. The book tells the story of young Laura, a pioneer girl who lives with her Pa, Ma, sister Mary, baby sister Carrie, bulldog Jack, and Black Susan the cat.<br />This book is a richly detailed portrait of pioneer life. There isn't much of a plot; the book is basically a record of the day-to-day lives of this hardy pioneer family. The book goes into fascinating detail about the family's activities: butchering a hog, smoking meat, churning butter, making bullets, fiddling, harvesting maple syrup, and more. Also fascinating are the characters' encounters with the various wild animals of the big woods--some dangerous, some cute.<br />The characters are memorable. Ma is the quintessential pioneer woman: hard-working and resourceful. I really got the sense that she's the glue that holds the family together. Pa is a particularly colorful and lovable character: a hunter, trapper, and farmer who is also a musician and a master storyteller. Indeed, the oral tradition of storytelling is an important motif in the book.<br />It's fascinating to escape to a world without DVDs, movie theaters, CDs, cable television, the Internet, or the other modern things we take for granted. This book takes us back to such a world, and reveals it to be a colorful and fascinating place.
B00005YXZH|5.0|By now the tale is well known... Warner Bros. in 2001 rejected the album for not being a commercial enough follow-up to the great \\"Summer Teeth\\", leading Wilco to a long road that finally saw the release of \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" in 2002 on Nonesuch. What was Warner Bros. thinking?<br />\\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" is the best Wilco album to date, bar none (yes, even surpassing \\"Being There\\"). The album is, simply put, just flawless, and easily one of the very best albums to come out so far in 2002. From the beginning of \\"I am trying to break your heart\\", Jeff Tweedy (Wilco's principal songwriter) takes us on a journey of America, and American music at its best. \\"Kamera\\" and \\"War on War\\" stand out for their upbeat, accoustic guitar-driven sound, but the sound tweaking is what drives this album (check out the intro of \\"I am trying\\" and the outro of \\"Ashes of American Flags\\", reminiscent of Radiohead era-Kid A.... just beautiful!<br />Seven years since their debut album, Wilco seems to get better and better. Can't wait for the next album, but meanwhile enjoy YHF, alt-rock doesnt get much better than this!
B000068PQ0|5.0|The more I listen to this album, the more I like it. I'd put it right up there with Wilco for the album of the year (although that one was made last year). I can't wait to see these guys as Beck's backing band this fall. If you like this album, be sure to check out The Mobius Band's new disc, Three. Those are my top 3 albums in my CD player right now. We'll see what happens when Beck's new album comes out though :)
B00005JKCH|3.0|Organic webshooters, removed spidey like dialogue, and a weak version of the green goblin but hey, its got romance. This movie is a cookie cutter movie with all aspects of filmaking to try and make it appeal to the biggest consumer group possible. Sam Raimi did a descent job keeping it entertaining though. Besides the fact that spidey cant win a fight on purpose, they alwasy gonna die on \\"accident\\" this movie is a nice little adventure to get away from whatever. Just dont buy into the hype, its not that good.
B00005RYLE|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend's birthday because we had seen the movie and HE liked it.  After seeing an advertisement for this DVD, i thought it would be a great gift only he would enjoy...Boy, was i wrong.  The commentary and extras were quite entertaining.  I can watch the film in its entirety, now that i know all of its little secrets and glitches.  If you liked any of the Living Dead movies, i.e., Night of, and Dawn of the Living Dead, then you may want to add this to your collection.  Its a cult horror fan's gift of choice, plus its got all the extra stuff that makes up for the price of the DVD :)
B000002GF8|5.0|The police attempted to record an album that had challenging intellectual content within and at the same time appealed to the masses.  This is a daunting challenge and they proved that they could do it with \\"Synchronicity.\\"  I like to think of this album as a bunch of pieces that when separated have nothing to do with each other but when they come together they all fit together and speak about eachother.  This is perhaps near what Carl Jung's synchronicity philosophy is about, although I am not sure.  Sting's lyrical work is easily his finest out of all the police albums and perhaps the finest of his career.  The lyrics in \\"King of Pain\\" speak volumes if you really try to understand them.  \\"Every Breath You take\\" can be looked at as a love song or as a song by an obsessive ex-lover.  Either way it is one of Sting's all time best, if not the best.  Stewart Copeland contributes his best song out of all his previous contributions.  Miss Gradenko is a great song about some teacher who is having problems in class.  This school is different because everyone seems to be forced to behave like un-emotional robots.  Although some people would not say that Andy Summers \\"mother\\" is not a contribution but a proverbial smudge on an otherwise immaculate floor.  I think Mother is a pretty disturbing song but it is also very original and it took me awhile but I eventually appreciated it.  It somehow fits well into the mix.  The album warms up with the first three songs but it really gets going with \\"Synchronicity II.\\"  The best four songs on the album are tracks 6, 7, 8, and 9.  \\"Wrapped around your finger\\" is as with most of the songs brilliant lyrically.  The great part about that song is that it is about a relationship that changes or actually it switches.  It is one of the most inspiring songs I have ever heard about a love relationship.  \\"Tea in the Sahara\\" can be described as beautiful and serene.  \\"Murder by numbers\\" is a perfect way to the end the album.  It is a smart commentary on modern society and it's indifference to violence.  It is also a criticism of the governments ability to wage war and kill masses of people.  This album is described as the police's best but I actually think that it is a tie between this one and \\"Ghost in the machine\\" as their best album.  So get both, and experience some of the best music that was ever recorded.
0345423496|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, but I must agree with those who said the previous books more.  I loved the premise of Poole being revived the distant future when humanity is facing a possible threat of the monolith.  I loved the details about the world of the future.  My only complaint is that I would have liked more.  Clarke could have carried on for a thousand pages about future technology and political changes without boring me.  He did a good job making me feel Poole's disorientation in discovering a new world.<br />It was nice that the book acknowledges that language would have changed.  The idea that English will become the universal language seems quite plausible to me, although one might have said the same thing about Japanese many years ago.  Anglish is a fitting name for the fictional language of the future-- obviously owing to influence from French and other languages.<br />I found the explanation of the monolith to be satisfying.  The only thing that disappointed me was the plan they used to resist the monolith-it's seemed a bit facile for something as powerful as the monolith.<br />Judging by the changes the world has seen in the last 1000 years and the rate of change since the industrial revolution, I believe the changes in the next 1000 years will go way beyond what is in this book.  Despite Clarke's insight, he can only fall short of creating a convincing future.  This book is a great story and a starting point for thinking about humanity's distant future.
B00005JKBC|4.0|Spy Game is a great spy thriller with a real satisfying conclusion.  The film keeps you guessing at Redford's Nathan Muir &quot;plays&quot; the CIA to help out Pitt.  A quality film.
B00000099Y|3.0|... I guess Tool is just one of those bands you love or hate; with a vengance. One would imagine that the band would be quite pleased to see such a passionate variance of opinion about their work. It means they're doing their job as artists. I, personally, am not a big fan of rock music in general. I think one of the reasons some of the reviewers were disappointed is because Tool is quite often mistakenly classified as \\"Heavy Metal\\". Before you buy this you should know that this is not Metallica, Sepultra, or Korn. If you haven't or can't imagine sitting through an entire performance of a symphony, then Tool is not for you. If you want to dance, sing along, or bang your head and \\"throw goats\\", Tool is not for you. If you enjoy LISTENING to creative, well-crafted, emotionally stirring modern music, you may want to give Tool a shot. But be warned! This CD is not without flaws and you may want to have your remote handy so you can skip to the good stuff.<BR>Here's what I didn't like:<BR><BR>1. FILLER with a capital \\"F\\". Other reviewers have commented on this as well and they were right on the money on at least this point. The only bit of filler I would've kept was the 56 second \\"Intermission\\". I don't know how many noticed, but it's the first 56 seconds of the following song played on a hokey little organ. It's pretty amusing. The fact that there are only about 8 actual songs on this is what prompted me to give it 3 1/2 stars.<BR><BR>2. Most of the songs do have the same structure. ... You'll hear that they both have the same loud-timechange-soft-loud-timechange-soft formula to them. So yes, they do have a formula, but at least it's a formula that works!<BR><BR>3. Hooker with a Penis. It just doesn't have the finesse and emotion of the other tracks, but I guess even the best bands are guilty of some rock star ego posturing...<BR><BR>What I liked:<BR>Stinkfist(beautiful!!!), Eulogy, H., Forty Six and 2, Jimmy, and Aenema(Fret for your figure and Fret for your latte and Fret for your hairpiece and Fret for your lawsuit and Fret for your prozac and Fret for your pilot and Fret for your contract and Fret for your car...)These songs (especially Stinkfist and Aenema) make you feel like a ragdoll on a rollercoaster one minute and an infant sleeping on a cloud the next. Nobobdy who REALLY enjoys music can possibly deny that Tool can most definitely play. These guy's instruments are not just extensions of their penises. Danny Carey plays like a musician, not just a drummer. He knows when to hit you head on and when to tease. He is one of the few rock drummers today that really know how to use a kit to its full advantage (also see Matt Cameron and Jimmy Chamberlin). Justin Chancellor's bass is smooth and articulate, the second half of what has got to be one of the tightest rhythm sections in music today. Adam Jones is no slouch, either. True, he is not the absolute best guitarist ever, but he has a fabulous understanding of melody and mood, probably due to his early training as a violinist. His ambient and creative use of guitars is a huge part of Tool's sound. Maynard James Keenan's vocals and lyrics are...well, lets just say that if Mr. Keenan would like to call me up and sing to me sometime (ala Tori Amos), I'd definitely make myself available. Like most rock singers, he's no Placido Domingo, but he does know how to evoke an emotion and get his point across (also see Thom Yorke). Tool is most definitely an excellent band and are quite worthy of the praise they receive. They make an obvious effort to create something personal and artistic. I don't lend much creedence to the whole \\"intelligent rock\\" thing. If I want to be taught or lectured at, I'll go get indoctrinated at some university somewhere. What I do want out of my music is catharsis, which is what I think Tool provides impeccably.
B000069HKH|5.0|Fabulous album which pays a great deal of respect to September 11th, 2001.  Only the Boss can pull off such a stunning album mostly about a very difficult topic.
B000000OAN|5.0|... and in 1992, I was only 7. The first Queen song I heard was, obviously, Bohemian Rhapsody. It was around the time when Wayne's World came out (one of my favorite movies ever), and Queen's popularity was in a resurgeance, even though Freddie Mercury, sadly, succumbed to AIDS on 11/24/91. But for X-Mas I got a copy of this album. Very diverse, unabashedly campy, in your face, hard rockin, \\"[rear]-kicking\\" and influential.<BR><br />Death On two Legs - If there's one thing Queen knew how to do perfectly, it was starting up an album. From the piano arpeggios, to Brian May's sinister guitar tones, this song is very heavy and very angry as well, an emotion Queen very rarely delved into. 5/5<BR><br />Lazing On A Sunday Afternoon - Filler to most people, but I just love it! Could be in a musical. 5/5 <BR><br />I'm In Love With My Car - Roger Taylor's high-pitched vocals, and the heaviness of this song create the perfect Anthem of Machismo, and how men love their cars. 5/5.<BR><br />You're My best Friend is a simple love song and one of the biggest hits of Queen's career. 5/5 <BR><br />'39: Brian May's McCartney-like crooning and pretty stupid lyrics. Usually one I skip over. The guitar harmonies are excellent though. 3/5 <BR><br />Sweet Lady is another rocker. May's guitar really roars toweards the end of this song. 5/5 <BR><br />Seaside Rendezvous - OK, I respect Queen's campy side, and since they had the balls to do it in such a machismo-orinete industry, but this is perhaps just a bit too far. 2/5 <BR><br />Prophet's Song - Haunting, beautiful, aggressive, and one hell of a middle section with Freddie's resonant and echoing accapella. My favorite Queen song... EVER! 5/5.<BR><br />Love of My Life - Dammit, this song is a tearjerker. 5/5<BR><br />Good Company - Pass. Brian May takes his McCartney-esque solo side way too far on this album. 2/5.<br />Bohemian Rhapsody - need I say anything? 5/5<BR><br />God Save The Queen - Another example on what a genius brian May is when it comes to orchestrating guitars (see \\"Procession\\" off of Queen 2). 5/5.<BR><br />Overall, it's a very strong record with a few lows, but many highs.
B000063COX|5.0|Here is the album that introduced the world to Iron Maiden. They were a new band. A different band. One that dared to enter a world that was peppered with punk rockers and play a completely different style of music. They would later grow into one of the most sucessful bands in history. But in this album, they are captured only as a new band struggling to compete with the other bad boys. None of them knew what was to come.<BR>The album kicks of with the ever popular (and catchy) Prowler, which is an absolute masterpiece in itself. The next song, Sanctuary, was not originally released with the album, but this first attempt still charted at # 4! Iron Maiden's first singer, Paul Di'anno and, of course, Steve Harris team up to create the third tune entitled Remember Tomorrow. It starts out quiet and serene, but bursts into a wild frenzy as only Iron Maiden can do. Track 4 is possibly one of Maiden's greatest songs called Running Free. It is an incredible song that displays all of Maiden's talent. The next song is the perfect, the awesome and amazingly astounding Phantom of the Opera. No words can describe the sheer power and flowing rhythm of this one. It starts out in a rather common way, but launches into a full and ecstatic whirlwind of music. Paul Di'anno is not needed for the next song because it is Transylvania, which happens to be instrumental. It focuses purely on the musical abilities of Maiden, which are demonstrated so well in this tune. Then comes a different side of Iron Maiden. A calm and quiet song named Strange World. Light taps on the cymbals and gentle fills on the drums make for a perfect background for the painstaking guitar work. Charlotte the Harlot has a touch of uniqueness, possibly because it was written by  Guitarist Dave Murray. It, like Porwler, is quite catchy and a smashing piece of work. Then comes the anthem of the band and the title track. Iron Maiden is so simple, yet it doesn't compromise the song at all. In fact, Iron Maiden is still one of my favorite tunes. Iron Maiden can't be fought. Iron Maiden can't be sought. You have to listen to it. Do no hesitate to buy the only album that includes Iron Maiden's first guitarist. Get the album that came before Bruce and Nicko, when Paul Di'anno had the microphone and Clive Burr controlled the beats.<BR>And just when you thought it couldn't get any better, guess what? It actually gets better!! If you have the capabilities to access the CD extra, you can view exclusive footage of Iron Maiden playing live at the Rainbow in London in 1981. The two clips are of Phantom of the Opera and Iron Maiden. The video from which they are taken is called Live at the Rainbow. It is very rare (I found a copy on eBay) but this CD gives you the unique opportunity to see Iron Maiden in one of their first concerts. It's to cool not to get!!
0783240503|5.0|What really sets this video apart from other stage productions is that it was obviously directed for a video audience. So many other stage productions (Riverdance, for example) are merely filmed during an actual performance, where the cameras have limited access, the sound is generally poor and the lighting designed for the theater audience rather than the home viewer. Not so with Joseph! This production is clearly directed specifically for the home viewer - it looks and sounds wonderful.<br />Donny Osmond is a likeable Joseph and Maria Friedman, a huge talent, is absolutely perfect as the Narrator.<br />The musical, a pop opera, is brilliantly concieved by Rice and Webber. The changes in musical styles to fit the various dramatic moods will bring a smile to your lips (especially the depiction of Pharoh - I won't spoil it if you haven't seen it yet. It's almost laugh out loud funny).<br />The sets, the production numbers, the lighting, the performances, are all top notch. The video is a &quot;must see&quot; for adults and kids alike.
B000000OSE|1.0|I don't care how good the music is (and it isn't ... just asinine, dated hair metal), any band that comes out with an album like \\"Lies\\" is terrible.  That album is easily one of the most sickening and ... displays of racism and homophobia I've ever heard. Axl Rose rails against \\"...,\\" \\"...,\\" and especially immigrants, who only come to \\"his\\" country to \\"start some mini-Iran\\" or \\"spread some ... disease.\\"<br />...<br />And for all you ... who think he's only kidding, listen to his brilliant comment he made before hitting the stage one night: \\"Before we start playing I want to say I'm sick of all this publicity about our song 'One in a Million.' I'm not a ... racist....\\" He went on to state that \\"not all ... are ...,\\" but if someone is \\"acting like a ...,\\" then he'll call it as he sees it. And the same thing goes \\"for ... ....\\" Axl then said, \\"If you still want to call me a racist, you can shove it up your ...\\"<br />In conclusion, GNR's music isn't a valid expression of white male rage, like I've heard some boneheads claim ... it's just terrible music with even worse lyrics. I suppose that if you're a supreme idiot, you will probably love this CD, along with all the other [stuff] that Guns N' Racists have come out with. However, if you have a brain and like to use it, please stick with bands like Nirvana, who told Axl Rose to drop dead when he stupidly asked them to open for them on tour. Let's hope that bigoted hicks like these never get this famous again.
B00004XONN|5.0|A barrage of sounds and emotions that sit in the background and<br />sneak up on you every once in a while. If this musical piece<br />was a painting it would be at least a half mile long. The other<br />half of course is amnesiac. Tommy sums it up far better than<br />many when he croons: I'M NOT HERE, THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.
B000002V0Q|4.0|As all decent, self-respecting metalheads know, \\"Countdown to Extinction\\" was Megadeth's hugely successful follow-up to the classic \\"Rust in Peace.\\"  The long, complex epics like \\"Hangar 18\\" and \\"Tornado of Souls\\" that characterized \\"Rust in Peace\\" were gone, replaced by shorter and more accessible songs that actually had decent chances at radio airplay.  However, more commercially palatable does not mean bad, and on \\"Countdown\\" Dave & crew conducted a clinic on how to bring metal to the masses without abandoning the genre's traditional fan base.<br />\\"Countdown\\" may have seen Megadeth toning down their progressive approach and writing songs with a more traditional verse-chorus-verse-chorus approach, but fortunately songs like \\"Architecture of Agression\\" and \\"Skin o' My Teeth\\" prove that Dave could write some memorable and catchy choruses.  Dave's vocals are also somewhat improved over previous albums, as his voice here has a somewhat \\"fuller\\" sound.  He can still be menacing when he wants to, and on \\"Sweating Bullets\\" he does perhaps his best sneering ever.  And of course, the musicianship is as tight as always.  As I said above, complex guitar showcases like those on \\"Rust in Peace\\" are missing, but there are still plenty of solid riffs and sharp solos.  David Ellefson's basslines are more evident than usual, giving the songs an extra crunch, and Nick Menza's drumming is nearly surgical in its precision.<br />The lyricism on \\"Countdown\\" is also worth noting.  On the band's previous albums Dave had shown an inclination toward social and political commentary, and \\"Countdown\\" sees the culmination of that trend.  A great deal of the songs here take on issues of importance, and it's done very intelligently.  \\"Skin O' My Teeth\\" discusses Dave's drug problem,\\" the hit \\"Symphony of Destruction\\" deals with power and corruption, and the title track is an angry tell-off to those who hunt endangered species for sport.  However, in my opinion the highlight of the album lyrically is the poignant \\"Foreclosure of a Dream,\\" which tells of the troubles of those left behind in American society and the quest for money.  For many of us it can be easy to forget about those who don't get to live the American dream, but songs like this can be a good reminder of what some go through.<br />Anyway, all in all this is an excellent album, and a worthy edition to the Megadeth pantheon.  I don't think it's their best, as I feel that honor is a toss-up between \\"Peace Sells...But Who's Buying,\\" \\"Rust In Peace,\\" and \\"Youthanasia.\\"  But its still important in its own way, especially for the intelligent and meaningful lyrics.  I hope I haven't gone on too long, but hey, I guess I had a lot to say.ally is the poignant \\"Foreclosure of a Dream,\\" which tells of the troubles of those left behind in American society and the quest for money.

B0000009SI|5.0|Zappa is phenomenal on this album. Every song is better than the<br />next all the way to the end and you just have to play it again<br />and some more. Whew!

It is diverse and compli-<br />cated and it shows Frank's superb guitar playing throughout.<br />Frank makes music you have to think about. And that's a good<br />thing.
B000001ESF|4.0|On their fourth studio album, Lee, Lifeson and Peart produced one of hard/progressive rock's all time classics.  They also found a logo with the Red Star and \\"naked guy\\" icons.<br />The album begins with some (slightly dated) sci-fi atmospherics that lead into the \\"2112 Overture\\", which introduces the instrumental themes that will appear during the piece.  At the climax of \\"Overture\\" we get a calm \\"...and the meek shall inherit the earth...\\" before blasting in \\"The Temples of Syrinx\\" with the great hard rock riffing by Alex and shrieking by Geddy Lee.  \\"Presentation\\" features some great dynamics, especially with Lee's vocals, switching from the narrator to the priests.  \\"Oracle\\" also has good energy and dynamics.  This song was credited \\"to the genius of Ayn Rand\\" and is largely based on her novel \\"Anthem\\", but here the character's discovery of the light bulb is replaced by a rediscovery of the guitar, a fitting image for a rock band.  The ending of this song is less upbeat than the novel, but the chilling \\"we have assumed control\\" at the end of the 2112 suite's \\"Finale\\" brings us to a resolution.  Top-notch instrumental performance from all three players, cosmic lyrics and song great singing by Geddy Lee make this a great piece.<br />\\"Side 2\\" presents five songs that break the album from \\"concept\\" mode.  \\"A Passage to Bangkok\\" features great travelogue imagery about \\"herbs and spices\\" and a nifty guitar lick.  \\"Twilight Zone\\" doesn't quite work for me instrumentally, but features little capsules from the famous TV series.  Rod Serling might have liked Rush.  \\"Lessons\\" is a surprise from Alex Lifeson, with some upbeat lyrics and nice heavy/soft dynamics.  I love the bassline in the \\"chorus\\" section. \\"Tears\\" is Geddy Lee's ballad contribution.  \\"Something for Nothing\\" is a great rocker, that builds from a nice guitar into into to some blazing metal and great vocal perfomance from Lee.<br />The packaging includes legible lyrics, with added story depth in the 2112 piece, wisely not included as spoken word like in \\"The Necromancer\\".  Check out the hats and robes our heroes are sporting for grins.isely not included as spoken word like in \\"The Necromancer\\".  Check out the hats and robes our heroes are sporting for grins.

B000069HK2|5.0|This cd is great. And to see some guys from my hometown get this much credit is greatly awesome. These guys are so awesome, I used to see them all the time when they played at Suite 13 (which is a place where they have mini-concerts with local bands and other bands like Tsunami Bomb) and my friend and his band used to open for them. Seriously, everone who is a punk/rock fan should give these guys some credit, they deserve it. So buy this CD and be proud that you made the right choice.
B00005OCMR|5.0|While most think that this movie's computer effects are ancient, Tron was one of the few movies in the early 80's that used high-quality computer generated effects.  Disney went all out on this film, making it a legendary movie.  The 20th Anniversary Edition DVD provides you with Deleted Scene footage, concept art, and other truely interesting facts about the movie that you may or may not have know.  Definitely worth buying.
0743442539|5.0|Le Carre is an unusual writer in the spy/thriller genre in that he creates real people with real problems who also happen to be spies.  The story of Leamas, a spy for Britain during the cold war, is well discussed in the many reviews here.  So instead I will briefly focus on why this is such a great read.<br />The book works at several levels.  First, one could characterize this as a page-turner because of the subject matter of the cold war and intrigue.  But the story is also very complex and demands the reader pay attention to fully benefit.  LeCarre does not spell out everything for the reader and I found myself having to go back several times to understand what had transpired.  I actually rented the movie - a gloomy B&W portrayal with Richard Burton as Leamas - in order to sort out a few things from the book.  Secondly, one is never sure, even when finished, who the good guys are and vice versa.  This causes the reader to think and contemplate issues of right and wrong, and moral values.<br />At the end I was very sorry that the book ended but also looking forward to reading more of this authors work.  This was a great book!
B0000057C5|5.0|This cd is the best compared to other bands! IN fact, All Rammstein cds rock!..i only have 2 though, but the ones i have  are soo awesome!..I recommend anyone buy these cds, if you love heavy metal!
B000067JHW|5.0|I did. They say that you only fall in love, the real kind that you know in your soul and in every fiber of your being, once in your life. I think that may also be true with art (painting, poetry, literature, music, and movies); there is one great painting, one great poem, one book, one song, and one movie that is part of your connection to the Big Scheme of Things. For me, Amelie is that One Movie.<br />This is a movie that could never have been made in Hollywood -- actually I can't imagine anyone in the US making a film as good as this. It's not your cynical highly over-rated Robert Altman flick, or your totally stupid Shallow Hal waste if time.<br />But what is it than? It's a movie you see and feel with your heart -- go see it. Let yourself fall in love with Amelie; it will do your heart some good.

Ill Communication didn't disappoint. I love the fusion-hop-acid-trip-jazz-rock-whatever-it-is they do. <br />This is not the music to listen to while having an anxiety attack. It is a montage of rapped lyrics, world beats, rock and jazz, fusion, and trip-hop, a veritable assault on standardized categories and linear perceptions. Whatever you decide to call it (yeah, even &quot;That ain't music, it's NOISE!&quot;), the Beastie Boys have executed it well. This music is skillfully created, magically blended, and flawlessly engineered.<br />(If you'd like to discuss this CD or review in more depth, please click on the &quot;about me&quot; link above and drop me an email.

0316666343|4.0|Fourteen year-old Susie Salmon is raped and murdered on a snowy afternoon by a neighbor.  As she sits in heaven, or what she believes is heaven, Susie watches the affect that her murder has on her family and friends, and she tries to find some way to communicate with them, to let them know that she is all right.<br />Alice Sebold is a marvelously inventive writer who uses her poetry background well.  The language and the structure of this novel will delight readers who are accustomed to non-linear narratives.  Others might find it too frustrating.  The characters are well-written and believable, but there were some plot points that I thought hit a false note.<br />But what is most appealing is Sebold's reassurance, through Susie, that heaven does exist, that the dead watch the living and try to help, that being dead is just a different kind of living.

B0000028M7|4.0|This is one of the best and yet most harrowing hard rock albums out there. Starting off with two radio favorites, it isn't long before we start to get a guided tour of Layne Staley's living hell (I'm assuming he wrote the songs about drugs). Jerry Cantrell lightens the mood (that's a joke) with \\"Rooster\\", a great tribute to his father's Vietnam experience. By the end of the disc you feel emptied out inside, but you're ready to listen again.
B00005JKLZ|4.0|As a fan of the original movie and novel, I anticipated the release of this newer stylized version of \\"The Time Machine\\" with baited breath.  It only disappoints me in the stylings of the movie itself, while the enhanced story has a fascinating way of portraying a moral.<br />Unlike a majority of movie fans out there, I didn't want the new version of this classic to be like the original.  First, If I wanted the exact same movie, I would have bought the DVD of the Rod Taylor epic (which is available, by the way).  The changes that they made to the storyline, including the greater detail about the Moorloc race and invention of a motive for the main character (Emma's death), only add to the overall plot.  The fact that the traveler asks a question which we all occasionally toss out at points in our lives (\\"Why can't I change the past?\\") ties the character nicely to us.  His answer is an unfathomable allegory, which is a shcoking lesson which sci-fi fans will enjoy the most.  Anyone who claims that this movie lacks philosophical depth has not taken the time to concider the effects of the question itself.  Second, the effects are top-notch.  The time machine itself is a truly amazing prop, and the DVD version also provides a fine documentary about its creation.  The effects shown during time travel sequences are equally astounding.  The Moorlocs also show the skill involved in the all around look of the film, as the make-up is frighteningly realistic.  Kudos to Stan Winston.<br />Now that I've explained the good, there are fallbacks to this film as well.  First, those who are not well acquainted with the original story may find themselves lost.  While this movie does a wonderful job of providing explanations for many problems that could have occured (addressing the commonly glossed-over problem of a time paradox in an unusual fashion), it does a poor job structuring and organizing these explanations.  The worst fallback is when Orlando Jones gives his lack-luster explanation of the two races, which leaves most people who haven't read the novel asking the opinion of those who have.  If you wish to enjoy this movie, YOU HAVE TO READ THE NOVEL FIRST.  Second, and on a lighter note, the music in the film has a dreadful new age feel that is often over the top.  As the main character explores the world of the future, the Enya-like chorus playing at full volume as a backdrop is ridiculous to the point of hysterical distraction.  Finally, and this is my largest bone of contention with the movie-making decisions of the director, the one deleted scene is extremely important contextually.  Available on the DVD is a deleted scene that explains the main character's drives and ambitions and also introduces many philosophical questions that later are addressed seemingly out of the blue.  If you purchase this film, I recomend watching this deleted scene first to give you such a context.  You will enjoy the film a lot more.  (Also, at only 90-odd minutes, a 5-10 minute deleted scene of this importance was not a cost effective cut.)<br />In conclusion, this movie stands quite well on its own, despite the director's poor judgement on some more stylistic issues.  If you are capable of putting aside your ties to the old film and watch this new interperetation as a new film in and of itself, you may find yourself enjoying it despite your better judgement.tion of the two races, which leaves most people who haven't read the novel asking the opinion of those who have.

B00005N9CV|2.0|Yes, I can't help wondering about Diana Krall's success. To me this sounds too much like the Jazz equivalent of Celine Dion. Soulless and superficial. Then again, all music types seem to be heading towards a similar level of mediocrity aren't they? I don't think she's a very good singer; to me, she sounds like a poseur - like many others I suppose. I won't repeat what's already been said many times except that these songs have been done better by many others. Seek them out unless you're only interested in the cover.

How might one ever again get to tenderness unless through the eyes of the child victim.  Only she may grant the wish of all others to feel sweet, vulnerable and whole again.  No other perspective is possible in a pure form.  I thank the author for at least an pixel of space to choose.
B00005JKQZ|2.0|After all the hype and Oscars, I thought I'd better get around to watching \\"A Beautiful Mind\\".  While the first half of the film steers you completely and deliberately in the wrong direction... which is very clever when the secret is revealed, after this the second half of the film seems to go downhill toward a typical Hollywood-esque weepy finale.  While I really tried to like the main character, Mr Nash, I found I didn't really care! After the closing titles rolled, I felt the film was desperately trying to out-do \\"Shine\\".. but with all the film's fancy camera work and ageing make up, it didn't quite manage it. If you want to watch a film about mental illness which has great acting and real emotion... Watch \\"Shine\\"!
B00004TJTQ|3.0|I love dogs more than anything in the world,especially my own dog.That's why it's hard for me to rate movies like this.On the one hand ,they're really sweet.On the other hand they make me cry.I had tears on my face at the end of this picture,it's too much.I could never watch it again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!What makes it all the more touching is that it is a true story.You will see the boy,whatsisname,first recieve Skip as a little puppy,and go right through to the time the dog dies.Omigod,I think Im going to cry again.If you want to see just how much a dog can mean to a person,then you might like to see this film.
B000006TRV|4.0|The Wall was probably the best Pink Floyd album to date, as any Floyd fan would agree (or not, some of your tastes are just odd). It signified a descent from stardom into insanity, the story of a man who builds a psychological wall around himself, cutting himself off from the world around him and running his childhood memories back through his mind like a reel of 8mm film. It was certainly was a dark, depressing way to end what was a great band. After The Wall, Pink Floyd fell apart, what with the firing of Richard Wright, tensions between band members, and Roger Waters, who really couldn't get over the success of The Wall (his later music was along the same line, politics and \\"theatrical\\", epic-sounding music). Even though this album was pretty much the downfall of the band, it's nothing to be disheartened about. They left a magnificent parting gift. From the manic rushing of \\"In The Flesh?\\" and just plain scariness of \\"One of My Turns\\" and \\"Don't Leave Me Now\\", to the raw, quiet insanity of \\"Is There Anybody Out There?\\" and \\"In The Flesh\\" (the second one), the album sucks you into Pink's psychadelic guilt and memory trip. The song \\"Vera\\", though short, was actually really good, I thought. Also, \\"The Trial\\" was a great piece of music. It was almost like a theatrical presentation (as I mentioned earlier). I would recommend this album to most Pink Floyd fans, mostly because it's the last real Floyd album (The Final Cut doesn't really count, and neither do the Gilmour albums, which are good in their own ways), and also because it's just a great, thought-provoking album.
B000066NW0|4.0|I bought this CD, totally thinking that it was going to stink, thinking that &quot;Complicated&quot; was going to be the best song on the CD.  I was surprised to find it wasn't as bad as I thought.  The songs are catchy, and her voice isn't so bad.  I've been listening to it alot.  I like &quot;Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Anything But Ordinary&quot;, and Things I'll Never Say&quot; among others.  It is a total pop album, but I fell for it.  I'm sorry. I actually like it.
0784011176|5.0|I have watched this movie at least a half dozen times since it's release and I am not tired of it yet. I am not an art house movie fan, but this one will either grab you by the throat and mesmerize you or it will totally turn you off. It is that strong a movie that there are no neutral reactions. My husband, who normally sleeps through my movies (even Schindler's List for God's sake!) could not sleep through this one. I have force fed it to a number of friends and the reaction is either gut-wrenching identifucation with the characters, or turning away in anger or disgust. By all means see it and judge for yourself, but don't plan on on easy movie experience. It is allegorical, romantic and harsh and beautiful and lovely to listen to and Holly Hunter considers it some of her best work.  So do I.
B00000AA6C|5.0|For years I was mad at \\"The Sound of Music\\" sight unseen because it outsold \\"Gone with the Wind\\" in tickets; even as a child I disliked change. But when we went to see it in a re-release, I was very excited by it. Over the years, my opinon changes: Sometimes I think Julie is too buffoonish and old for her role, most lately I think Christopher Plummer just walked through the picture. But I recognize that these opinions are like fads--they come and go, and the picture remains, great as it is.<br />Of course, one must start with the score. Rogers and Hammerstein outdid themselves on this one, which is good since it was the last collaboration before Oscar died. How tragic if he had gone out after \\"Pipeline\\" or some other less worthy musical! Second, comes the beautful scenery of Salzburg itself. You know, whoever got the idea of that original tracking shot, where we fly over the Alps and ultimately zoom in on Julie twirling around was a genius--from that moment on, the picture was a guaranteed hit. If you ever listen to Mary Martin sing the title song on the original Broadway cast version, she does a nice quiet job of it. Well, not for these folks, no way! They went blockbuster with it, and nobody else who ever sings that song can ever attempt to do less than Julie does so well. The other shots as the children go round with their new governess through the gardens of Mirabel are just lovely.<br />I think the supporting cast is particularly good: Peggy Wood as Reverend Mother is outstanding, singing or not. Richard Haydn as Max never fails to amuse me, and even Eleanor Parker as the Baroness is like an older, blonde Ava Gardner--very smooth but if you look too closely, I think she's kind of anorexic for her age. However, her beautiful wardrobe masks that very well.<br />The children are good, though some must needs be forgettable I suppose, since there are so many of them--like the youngest boy and the girl before the youngest. But Angela Cartwright and Charmian Carr areexcellent actresses both.<br />Julie and Chris? Well, at the moment, I still find him a walk-through, detracting from most of the scenes he's in. I'm less annoyed with Julie these days. Of course, there's NO WAY I could ever fault her beautiful singing. I'd like to know why he was dubbed in, since the singer they hired to do his songs isn't so great. I guess it's funny that I can dislike the two main performances as much as I do, and still like this picture, but that's one of the mysteries of life, I guess. My only other criticism of the film is that I wish it were more colorful. Everything is somewhat white and gold and gray. Even the children's playclothes are a little washed out, color-wise. That's why I really notice that green dress Maria wears when she returns to the villa--it's the one vibrant color in the whole picture.<br />Overall, though, \\"The Sound of Music\\" is one of the supreme movie musical achievements. Very few scores can better it, just about no singer can top Ms. Andrews. If you haven't seen this yet, what ARE you waiting for, an invitation to the convent itself?
B000063NPX|5.0|Beauty and the Beast is, in my opinion, the best animated Disney movie ever made. The score is incredible, the characters are endearing, and the plot is funny and sweet.
B00006EXCC|5.0|Isn't this just the best? Along with the U.K. Between the Buttons and a choice of hits packages, Aftermath makes the cut and paste Flowers obsolete (well almost). One might wish for a few bonus cuts on some of these 30 minute albums and not so much repetition. Even a solid U.K. format and an e.p. collection or protracted singles collection. Once again , 5 STARS for Aftermath but singles hot rocks more hot rocks not in my budget.
0767802659|1.0|One of the Worst Movies that I have ever seen. The acting was some of the worst I have ever had the displeasure of witnessing.<br />Like wen the main character (forget his name) said in anger: \\"The infantry does the dying, the fleet does the flying!\\"<br />It was so fake that I almost threw something at my TV.<br />The movie had a good idea and apparently a good book behind it, but it was so poorly executed it was painful. I was really hoping that it would be a good movie but WHOA! what a stinker!
B000002LVB|4.0|Loaded is unquestionably the worst of all the Velvet Underground albums.  As almost everyone here has pointed out, it contains three great tracks--\\"Sweet Jane,\\" \\"Rock & Roll,\\" and \\"Oh, Sweet Nuthin'.\\" The rest of the album, however, is utterly destroyed by horrific production.  You can hear brilliance looming in \\"I Found a Reason,\\" a track which is wrecked by inane backing vocals and a God-awful spoken section in the middle.  Same goes for \\"Train Comes Round the Bend\\" and \\"New Age.\\"  I won't get into the inclusion of stupid novelty numbers like \\"Lonesome Cowboy Bill\\" and \\"Who Loves the Sun,\\" which are simply unforgiveable when songs like \\"Ocean\\" could have been included instead.<br />This being said, the Fully Loaded version of the album is truly necessary for any VU fan's library.  The second disc features rough but effective demos of much of the material on the original album, forming the skeleton of what could have been a brilliant record.  Especially great is the heartfelt Dylan-esque version of \\"I Found a Reason\\" and a strung-out, stripped-down take of \\"Head Held High.\\"  <br />The extras are great, too.  Both versions of \\"Ocean\\" are excellent, the one on disc one being especially creepy with Reed's echoed vocals.  There's a lot of interesting marginalia as well, maybe not up to speed with VU's best work, but cumulatively worth repeated listenings.<br />I would certainly never recommend that this be the first album a new fan listens to, but for those who need to get their fix of the greatest band of the last 40 years, this edition will more than suffice.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|Emma, played by the refreshing Gwenyth Paltrow, is a young woman in high society who tries to use her wits and position to &quot;help&quot; those she cares about.  While her intentions are pure, she often ends up being too clever for her own good.  While her plans to secure her friends' happiness go awry, she finds she's left her own life considerably lacking.<BR>This adaptation captures the essence of Jane Austen's brilliant social comedy.  It shows the intricacies of relationships (played by exceptional actors), the humor of human foibles and undue formality, and the dangers of good intentions.<BR>As with all Jane Austen works, the ending (while wonderful) is not as important as the path the story takes in getting there. The creativity of the cast and director, along with the brilliancy of the work itself, makes this version of &quot;Emma&quot; a must-see.
6304383827|5.0|Emma is a wonderful romantic comedy. The flavor is a tad different that one would get by reading the Austen book, and of course the content of the book is condensed for the movie, but overall it is still true to the book. The characters are the same extreme, memorable and lovable characters that Austen wrote into the book. The story is about Emma, an only daughter of a fairly rich nobleman, who decides to do good deeds by interfering in others lives (thinking that she knows best), and ends up making a mess of things... while on the way realizing that she is in love, herself. Nothing objectionable.
B00006AW2E|3.0|I enjoy this earlier material very much. I purposely ordered up the U.K. versions to not completely repeat stuff I already have. Lack of stereo tracks I have heard elsewhere are a disappointment.
B000068TPN|4.0|This film is the best Vietnam war movie I have ever seen and the first one I have seen on this battle, in particular.  It gives an accurate view of military life as I have seen it (I am an ex-military wife).  The battle strategies were evident and interesting to follow.  This film shows the stark realities of close combat fighting.  It made me really want to read the book to get more.  Highly recommended.
B000002G87|5.0|Wow!  I just finished reading all 65 reviews.  What a treat! This is my all-time favorite album.  Today I borrowed the 20th Anniversary Session, to compare it with my Remastered CD (I also have the double record).  It was difficult to go back and forth from CD to CD, but I did notice that on the 20th Anniversary Session there was a shout on &quot;Keep On Growin'&quot; at the end of the instrumental introduction and it gave me chills.  If I sound like a fanatic, well, I am.  As a record critic from 1965 to 1971, I remember receiving the double album in the mail.  I was crazy about the title, &quot;....assorted love songs...&quot; Cute!  Clever.  And self-deprecatory.  The back cover photo with all those dominoes and all those great photos inside the record album jacket.  And who is this Nizami?  Well, the opening bars of &quot;I Looked Away&quot;, and I was hooked for life.  I want to talk about Eric's vocals.  They are astonishing.  I'm thinkin', &quot;hmmm, maybe a little heroin...&quot;  Just kidding.  I've never had such a great cd friend as this.  It is my inspiration to play, and push myself to my musical limits on guitar as well.  I'm so happy to know this record.  Eric has said that he couldn't sing so he just, I don't remember what, something about mustering it up and screaming.  It works so incredibly.  And the guitars, the guitars, the guitars. These are the best guitar duels I have ever heard. All the players work together so beautifully.  I hope Bobby Whitlock is okay, I never hear about him.  This album is a one-of-a-kind labor of love.  I can't talk about which songs are best, they are all so damn good.  There was so much love and care put into this undertaking.  It is a total inspiration for me and the music I am wrenchingly struggling myself, to make.  The way the organ follows the acoustic opening of &quot;I Am Yours&quot;; Jim Gordon's tasty licks, Bobby Whitlock's and them singin' harmony.  Tom Dowd was a genius producer.  Thanks.
0790725657|5.0|This movie is a total classic!  Even people like me, who don't cry at movies much, cry at this one!  I think it's a movie for people of all ages, and kids and adults can watch it together and really enjoy it.
B000065U1N|5.0|\\"Black Hawk Down\\" is a gritty, uncompromising depiction of the events that took place in Mogadishu, Somalia when elements of Task Force Ranger and the Delta Force attempted to seize two members of Somali warlord Mohammed Farah Aidid's cabinet in a raid meant to least no more than 30 minutes.  The operation came close to being pulled off successfully, until the downing of one of the Black Hawk helicopters throws the entire mission into disarray.<br />The movie is based on Mark Bowden's book of the same name, though whereas Bowden does give some of the Somali point of view in his book, the film focuses squarely on the American Rangers and Deltas fighting for their very lives.  Some of the characters in the film are composites of two or more people.  For instance, Sgt. Eversmann, portrayed by Josh Hartnett, did not make it with his \\"chalk\\" to the Wolcott crash site, but instead rode with McKnight's ill fated Humvee convoy as it drove in vain throughout the streets of the \\"Mog\\" trying to get to the crash site.<br />This movie is not for the squeamish or the faint of heart, with its frequent depictions of battlefield gore.  Once the raid itself begins about 40 minutes into the film, BHD basically becomes one nonstop battle scene that some viewers may find exhausting.  The performances from the ensemble cast are mostly good, including Josh Hartnett as the aforementioned Sgt. Eversmann, Eric Bana as Delta sniper Hoot (except for one brief slip, you would never know he's Australian), Tom Sizemore as Col. McKnight, William Fichtner (who is one of the greatest character actors around) as the Delta Sanderson, and Sam Shepard as the beleaguered General Garrison struggling to save his men from being massacred.  The only performance that I found less than convincing was the actor who played the Ranger Capt. Steele.  I think the actor who plays him is also Australian, and he didn't sound authentically American to me.<br />Visually, the movie is stunning, which is a hallmark of Ridley Scott's films, and there are many images that will stay with the viewer after watching the film.  The scene where the choppers are flying over the beach of Mogadishu to drop off the Deltas and the Rangers may remind some of the helicopter attack scene in Apocalypse Now, the scrolling shot of the mosque at dawn as the call to the Muslims to pray is sung out, the strafing run by the choppers in the dark, the Somali man walking across the street with a dead child in his arms, and countless others.  The soundtrack is eclectic, switching from rock music to Middle Eastern sounds and vocals.<br />The theme of the movie itself can best be summed up by two lines uttered by Hoot, \\"Once that first bullet goes past your head, politics and all of that s--- goes out the window\\" and \\"It's all about the men next to you.\\"  BHD is not about whether our action in Somalia was right or wrong, it's about the men who fought there who find themselves forced to rely on their training and each other in order to survive in a desperate situation.<br />As for the DVD itself, it is sadly lacking in special features, though I understand a special edition is coming out next year.  But the movie itself is definitely worth seeing to understand what our soldiers went through on that day, and for its unglamorous depiction of the ugliness that is war.
B000056HE9|5.0|\\"The Bishop's Wife\\" is a very Vintage Classic from the Metro Goldwyn Mayer movie vault.  This 1948 Christmas film has all the yuletide spirit & joy for the family during the holidays.  This sleeper classic belongs among the \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" (1946) & \\"Miracle on 34th Street\\" (1947) movies also of the fabulous post World War II forties.  The nation and the world were experiencing renewed family life, church reunions and joyous faith.  Hollywood provided us with wholesome family entertainment.<br />This Black / White movie is presented with a clear digital picture and sound.  Standard size (before WideScreen), modified to fit your standard tv.  The movie is 1 hour and 49 minutes in length. (this was quite long for the 1940 double feature)  Extra Feature: an original movie trailer.  <br />Summary:  The Bishop (David Niven) & \\"The Bishop's Wife\\" (Loretta Young) are aided by a mysterious stranger (Cary Grant) during the Christmas Holidays.  The Bishop has reached a very difficult crossroad in his religious career.  Actually he becomes obsessed with building a new cathedral while abandoning all his basic roots & beliefs.  He prays for spiritual guidance and a stranger appears to assist him in his quest.  This stranger tells the Bishop he is an angel & he has answered his prayer.  While \\"The Bishop's Wife\\" has the faith & believes, the Bishop has doubt.  Will all be solved?  This is Hollywood.  Cary Grant is an Angel.  It is Christmas in the 1940's!!! What do you think?<br />The cast is perfect and the story is absolutely wonderful.<br />This movie is a wonderful holiday addition to the family Christmas DVD library!  Enjoy.
B0000025ZK|5.0|This is Gilmour's second solo effort and i think it is better than his first one. Don;t take me wrong I love then both very much. Anyways, His lyrics have done much better since his first album, the music is more powerful and his guitar is great(IT IS ALWAYS GREAT)This album will appeal to all floyd fans. Even if you are not a floyd fan you will still love it.
B00000K0T8|4.0|There was obviously a lot of expectations for Ghost's solo debut when it was released back in '96.It came out during the Wu's great period and it followed the masterpiece albums 36 Chambers, Liquid Swords and Only Built 4 Cuban Linx.While Ironman falls short of those albums it still has enough incredible moments to make it a Wu classic.<BR>Despite a [bad] intro,the album starts with a bang with one of it's best tracks \\"Iron Maiden\\".Great beat and Ghost,Rae and Cappadonna shine on that track.\\"Winter Warz\\" is the best track on the CD.It's really intense and can easily stand beside the all time great Wu Tang tracks.The intro for \\"Fish\\" sounds a lot like those heard on Rae's \\"Only Built 4 Cuban Linx\\" album and it's another great track.\\"Daytona 500\\",despite some pointless singing on it,is another highlight.Smoking beat and Rae in particular shines on that track.Another Wu classic.\\"All That I Got Is You\\" is another incredible track.Very nice beat and a very heartfelt song from Ghost.Mary J.Blige may sound a bit out of place on a Wu song but the song still works.<BR>However,despite all these amazing moments,Ironman is far from flawless and it has it's share of weak  tracks that could've gone.\\"Wild Flowerz\\" has a great beat but it's mysognistic tone mars the song and is uncharacteristic for the Wu(with the exception of Ol' Dirty Bastard,of course).\\"Black Jesus\\" has a great beat but it doesn't co-incide with the lyrics at all.\\"After the Smoke Is Clear\\" is just plain wack.It's a totally misguided song.Having The Delphonics on it doesn't work at all.<BR>Overall,despite the weak tracks Ironman is still a must-buy Wu album.Ghost's supreme emceeing talents are intact.He and GZA are the best rappers in the Clan.I didn't really like this album the first time I heard it.I unfairly tried to compare it to Liquid Swords and Cuban Linx.It took a few more listens until I realised how good it was.Ghost's 'Supreme Clientele'is even better.
B000006045|4.0|Most of the reviewers here are trip-hop fans; I'm not. <BR>I just say this not to say their opinions are not good or something, but just to let you know that regarding trip-hop music I'm a complete ignorant, among many other things I may be an ignorant too.<BR>Once said this, I'll talk about this album. Being my favourite music quite varied but mostly electronic, I had heard a lot about this band, but not a single song of them. Well, that's what I thought, 'cos when I bought this album (used, very cheap) and the first sounds of 'Angel' started to sound in my room, I realised I had listened to this a lot of times before. And the same with 'Teardrop' and 'Mezzanine'.<BR>I like this album a lot, this is good music. I have listened to just a few songs from their previous albums, but I find Mezzanine darker and more interesting. There's a lot of singers so you can never get tired of the songs. There are some songs that are just ok for me, such as 'Exchange' (both versions) and 'Man Next Door'. But the rest are really good, in my opinion. From the dark electronics of 'Angel', which is maybe overplayed but never overestimated, through the addictive trip hop of 'Risingson' , 'Inertia Creeps' and 'Mezzanine', which are simply fantastic. One thing I really love is the percussive elements of this album; they may sound soft and suddenly get rageful and breathless. 'Teardrop' is a very beautiful ballad, while 'Black Milk' and 'Dissolve' are darker. <BR>I only have another so-called trip hop album (Tricky's Maxinquaye), and I (obviously) respect this style, but Mezzanine is the only trip hop album I really love because it defies the boundaries of a genre, they mix elements from many different styles and trends (I find elements from pop, rock, dance, ambient, industrial, etc etc) <BR>By the way, if you like this album I'd recommend you to listen to RECOIL, especially to 2 albums: 'Unsound Methods' and 'Liquid'; they are very very good and share some elements in common.<BR>Buy it,it's very good music you'll probably get addicted to.
B000068FY0|5.0|The high fidelity of the remastered &quot;Crime of the Century&quot; is astounding... it sounds as if it were recorded yesterday!  Because the record has so many low slung, atmospheric and moody parts, this remastered version is really essential.  Keyboard interludes on &quot;School,&quot;  &quot;Bloody Well Right&quot;  and &quot;Crime of the Century&quot; are brought to the forefront and the intricate percussion sections seem more isolated than before (being a good thing).  This is classic material from an overachieving band, sort of (Pink) Floydian is it's celebral aspirations.  What more can be said?  Oh yeah, love the cover art!
B0000025DD|5.0|Gilmours first solo effort is a great one. Though the lyrics are alright, the music [rocks]! The GILMOUR TRADMARK GUITAR is here of course. There are many highlights in this album, Which include Mihalis, there is no way out of here, cry from the street, raise my rent, is's definetly, and i cant breath any more.
B00005NOOH|5.0|This documentary's scope is remarkable, and the presentation is powerful considering that it was created around 1968 to 1971 when there was much classified information yet to be released.<br />To me a compelling aspect is the fact that it humanizes the conflict through the interviews with participants and survivors.  I found particularly interesting how the Japanese infantryman and pilots viewed the war.  You come to realize that there are human beings on both sides of the story... people like you and me.  Stunning also are the interviews with Adolf Hitler's secretary.  She provides a fascinating insight into the daily routine surrounding one of history's most notorious men.<br />Another remarkable quality is this documentary's sound track.  The music is superb, and it evokes powerful emotions throughout the series.  Many of the pieces are haunting and well positioned during the narrative's course.  Even after thirty years the music sounds fresh, unique, and evocative.  View one of the late episodes and listen to the music as paratroopers drop into Germany.  The music and the pictures tell the story without narrative, but this combination is compelling without any language.<br />Finally, the photography provides images of the challenge, struggle, and horror that was the Second World War.  It is nothing like the sanitized pictures from the cinema and the propaganda from this era.  To this day I cringe when I see the film of the flies and the insects that plagued both sides during the North African campaigns.  How did these men and these women live in such difficult conditions?<br />If you invest the many hours needed to watch this documenary, then you will understand the War's horror, this conflict's historical aspects, and how it has shaped the world in the twenty first century.
0316666343|1.0|This book was difficult to comprehend.  The book got off to a good start, but dwindled off a third of the way through.  I wonder how it got to the best sellers list?  Probably b/c Good Morning America recommended it.  Maybe Good Morning America should write me a check for [the money] I spent on this book.
0790744295|1.0|Both feature little tales mixing horror with comedy. Both were written by famous writers and directors. Both presented good actors playing the characters. What does both don't have in common? Creepshow is bad but Tales From The Crypt don't. I feel like I was cheated by the cover, title and the [garbage] lines written in front an back of the cover. If you're looking for intelligent horror comedy, featuring different kinds of morals, look elsewhere, better yet, go watch Tales From The Crypt. Watching Creepshow you will feel really dumb because the tales don't have a meaning at all. You don't need to own it just because you're a Stephen King fan (like me), do yourself a favor and read his books instead. 0 stars!
B000001G1E|5.0|I purchased this CD because I like James Brown's style of music and I've always loved James Brown's music specifically (though I have never really heard music from his early years until this CD set).  I have some of his songs scattered on various cassette tapes but I never purchased a James Brown CD or album.  So I purchased this set because of the ratings here at Amazon[.com].<br />Here is my recommendation about this CD set.  Block a few hours when you get it because you are not going to want to stop listening to it.  This thang is \\"bad!\\"  You are going to play these CDs over and over again and please be in a place where it's OK to jump up and shout and dance because that is what these CD's will entice you to do.<br />I highly recommend this CD set to any James Brown fan and to anyone that likes soul, funk, and even Rhythm and Blues.  Get it and enjoy (and you will enjoy them).  I liked these so much that I went right out and got another set for my dad...And he loves them.  We played them on his surround sound system and it got funky in there indeed.  Buy it, you'll be glad you did.

6302787068|1.0|With the wonderful success of \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" a movie that i truly admire for being something original from Disney which is VERY rare since the death of Walt.  This movie is almost an exact same copy of \\"Beauty\\".Basically i'm talking about the music score. If you hear the music carefully you'll notice that most of the songs are the same songs as in \\"Beauty\\" but just altured enough to give it just a slight difference.This is because the talent that comes from Disney is nothing like it use to be when Walt ran the business. So this movie is pretty poor in my estimations. There is nothing original about this music score.  Save your money folks,,,it's not worth the plastic it was recorded on.
B000068TPN|5.0|We Were Soldiers is based on the factual events that happened in 1965 at the battle of Ia Drang Valley. I've heard it said that this is one of the better war movies, and one of the best Viet Nam movies. I'd have to agree. Mel Gibson puts in a stunning performance (as usual) at Col Hal Moore, the leader of the 1st battallion, 7th calvary (Custer's unit). Greg Kinnear has a great performance. Barry Pepper does a wonderful job as Joe Galloway, the reporter who was there in the fight. And it is great to see Sam Elliot again, in a role that seems tailor made for him. And many other actors put in great performances. It may have helped that Hal Moore, Joe Galloway, and Bruce Crandall (Kinnear's character) were there to help guide the filmmakers. This movie also spends time focussing on the soldier's wives at home, where Madeleine Stowe and especially Keri Russell and Simbi Khali (not much screen time for Khali, but the few minutes she was on, she was phenomenal) do a great job. You don't too often see the effect at home, but you do here. We Were Soldiers also portrays the enemy as soldiers and honorable men, instead of the stereotypical '...' shown in most Viet Nam movies. And as much as I like movies like Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, and Casualties of War, it is nice to see the soldiers portrayed as soldiers doing their job rather than the psychos, drug addicts, and the likes shown in other movies. This is what Speilberg was hoping for when he made Saving Private Ryan. Randall Wallace (writer/director) teams up again with Gibson. These guys made Braveheart together, and We Were Soldiers is almost as good. The effects are good, and William Hoy does such a great job editing, I think he deserves an Oscar. Nick Glennie-Smith scored the movie, and his work doesn't detract, nor is it swallowed up by the action. This is just an overall great movie. <br />And the dvd is a good one also. There is a commentary track by Wallace, and while it isn't the most entertaining I've watched,he does a good job (I do wish Mel Gibson had been on the track with him). There are numerous deleted scenes and a 20 minute behind the scenes documentary, \\"Getting it Right.\\" It's a good dvd.
B0000691TJ|5.0|\\"Remixed,\\" \\"remastered,\\" and \\"Ramones\\" just don't seem to fit together in the same paragraph, let alone the same sentence, so it should be a no-brainer that the main reason to buy this reissue is for the 12 bonus tracks of demos and previously unreleased material tacked on at the end.  Although many thought the band was flogging a dead horse at this point in their career, \\"Too Tough To Die\\" served notice that The Ramones weren't ready to roll over like a trained puppy just yet, veering stylistically from hardcore punk (\\"Wart Hog\\") to brash pop (\\"Chasing The Night\\" and \\"Howling At The Moon\\") to upside-down rockabilly on steroids (\\"No Go\\").  A keeper...
0767817729|5.0|What a great film. It starts off slow, but soon takes off. Costner plays his role to perfection. Quinn as the aging Mexican gangster is also magnificent.<br />Costner is a newly retired Airforce pilot. He has a cabin in the mountains of Mexico that he intends to retire to. Also in Mexico is a very close friend (Quinn). While on his way to his cabin, he decides to stop by and see his frienf.<br />The movie does not go into too much detail about how/why they are friends. It leads you to believe that Costner at some time in the past saved Quinn's life during a hunting trip.<br />Quinn is an aging Mexican gangster. Actively involved in politics (behind the scenes). He also has a wife that is half his age. She wants children, Quinn does not. She seeks refuge in the arms of Costner. As can be expected, Quinn finds out what is going on. He is ruthless in his pursuit of revenge. However, uncharacteristically, he does not kill the two. He has Costner beat nearly to death and left in the desert. The girl is slashed across the face and dropped off at a Mexican bordello where the owner is told to keep her drugged up.<br />This is where the real story starts. The introduction of the characters and the opening of the real story take about 40 minutes. It's a little slow, but the rest of the film is worth the wait.
0871137380|5.0|Mark Bowden's book is destined to be a classic. It is on the reading list of just about every US military school. It is exhaustively researched. Bowden interviewed participants on each side of the battle. And he had a wealth of official documents to draw on. He then weaves a tight story that holds you on the edge of your seat.<br />Unlike the movie, some of the political background and the strategic situation is described, so the reader can follow the events described. However, the book focuses on the gritty and grisly details of the raid gone wrong that resulted in a blood bath for both sides. As good as the book is though, it only describes a small portion of the action that fateful day. For example, the story of the \\"Lost Platoon\\" is not mentioned at all. This platoon was part of the rescue force and found itself isolated and assailed in a manner similar to what happened to the Rangers.<br />Therein lies the greatest danger of this book. By focusing on the heroic actions of the small group of Rangers and Delta force, one loses the overall perspective. Many that read this book will draw what I feel to be erroneous conclusions about urban warfare, particularly about the need for heavy armor in urban combat. <br />Read this book, see the movie, but don't stop there. Do more research and learn about the USMC and 10th Mountain Div experience especially Captain Hollis' personal accout in Infantry Magazine which is also posted on the web.
B0000070QN|5.0|The second track on this amazing melodic hard rock album, &quot;No Justice&quot; says it all.  How on earth does such an amazing album as this get overlooked??  Clearly, there is &quot;no justice in the world&quot;, to quote from that melodic monster of a song.<br />All I can say is that every track on this album is stunning.  From the searing opener &quot;Saviors Never Cry&quot; to the beautiful yet persistent &quot;Jealousy&quot; to the amazing melodies of &quot;Sentimental Blvd.&quot; to the vocals-only masterpiece &quot;Just Like I Planned&quot;, all of the tracks are winners.  I have rarely heard an album that is this good on each and every track.  It took me until this year to discover this band and album.  (This album came out during the height of grunge--1993.)  Man, was I missing out!<br />As great as bands like Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, and Night Ranger have been in the realm of melodic hard rock, this album in my mind is as worthy an entry as any of these other bands has ever submitted.  Coming from me, a huge fan of these bands, that is definitely a compliment.  All I can say to fans of melodic rock is this:  Get this album!!  It is worth the import price and is guaranteed to bring life to your CD collection.  Strongly recommended purchase.
B00006EXDM|4.0|Reviewing this compilation in the 1970s, Robert Christgau put it best: &quot;Look, here's how it works. Except for _Satanic Majesties_, which isn't represented here, all of their '60s studio albums are musts. Couldn't even tell you where to start.&quot;  Well, I can.<br />Start with the _Big Hits_ compilatons (_High Tide and Green Grass_ and _Through the Past Darkly_), which cover all the group's US hits, from &quot;Not Fade Away&quot; and &quot;Tell Me&quot; through the original &quot;Honky Tonk Women,&quot; but without too much redundancy with other albums from the period (especially if you stick with the UK versions), should you choose to move on.  If you do, go next for the Holy Quintet: _Beggar's Banquet_, _Let It Bleed_ and _Get Yer Ya-Yas Out_ (the group's only great concert album, not counting bootlegs), from the new ABKCO remasters, and _Sticky Fingers_ (which includes &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; and &quot;Wild Horses&quot;) and _Exile on Main St._ (which, some argue, is really the best Stones album ever), from the Virgin catalog.  After that, try the *UK editions* of _Out of Our Heads_, _Between the Buttons_ and _Aftermath_.  Then, if you still crave a little more, start exploring the early albums. But beware of _Got Live If You Want It_ and _Metamorphosis_.<br />Despite Capitol's still-unremastered catalog, Beatles fans have it a little easier with the _Past Masters_ CDs, which collect only the singles, EP and other uncollected tracks not on the group's original albums.  Unfortunately, even the most careful buyers of Stones product from the Sixties are forced to buy some of the same songs more than once just to obtain other material otherwise not available.  Fortunately, if you have more than a passing interest in the group, you can skip the first _Hot Rocks_ collection.
B000002GJ7|5.0|I never got into any of Extreme's other albums (&quot;Three Sides To Every Story&quot; proved to be a huge disappointment, and I was never crazy about the debut either), but this one to this day remains one of my favorites from the end of the &quot;fun hard rock era&quot; (i.e., right before grunge took over).  I bought this album expecting a typical but decent hard rock effort.  What I got was one of the more unique and fun albums of its time.<br />&quot;More Than Words&quot; and &quot;Hole Hearted&quot; are fantastic acoustic hits that I love to this day.  At tracks 5 and 13, they make up two of the only slow tracks on the album.  Most of the rest of the album is pure hard rock, such as the classic opening track &quot;Decadence Dance&quot;, the third track which actually begins with a rap &quot;When I'm President&quot;, and the title track.  &quot;It's A Monster&quot; is a fantastically heavy song at track 7.  Very charming is the soft oldie-sounding track 9, &quot;When I First Kissed You&quot;, which then gives way to one of the harder rocking tracks, the amusing &quot;Suzi (Wants Her All Day What)&quot;.  The ultimate power ballad on the album is the 12th track &quot;Song For Love&quot;--truly one of my favorites on the album.<br />What a diverse and fun album this is!  I tried so hard to give the follow-up &quot;Three Sides...&quot; a chance and couldn't believe how disappointed I was.  (Maybe now, 10 years later, I'd like it better, but who knows?)  Nonetheless, this album will always be a classic to me, as it has the best of everything fun in rock music.  To this day this one is still worth a listen--and not just for the great hits.  A fun album from beginning to end.
B000066JES|5.0|The wait was totally worth it.<br />Like thunder from the sky, Manowar comes back to fight and die for true metal.<BR>We were given the album we deserved, so all of us warriors and vikings should unite in one big scream, and praise the metal gods: Manowar!!<br />This CD contains some of the most inspired and emotive songs by the velvet wearing, 40 years old steel horsemen; who, once again, demonstrate they are, for sure, born of black wind, fire and steel.<br />Long live Manowar!!
B00006FXB6|5.0|I bought this cd the day it came out and I have yet to take it out of rotation. It's one of the best c.d.'s I've heard all year! I highly recommend that you buy this c.d. and their others. My personal all time favorite is Rated R. Keep on rocking...!!!
B000065V1V|5.0|I've had an advance copy of this album since around March 2002 or so, and that's allowed me the luxury of a lot more time with it than some Bowie fans.  Believe me, I'm grateful for that, since it means I've had over half a year for this excellent work to really sink in.<br />There are a few tiny quibbles I could make with Heathen.  The strings in &quot;Afraid&quot; are a bit much; parts of &quot;Gemini Spaceship&quot; are a little over-produced; &quot;Everyone Says Hi&quot; could be darker.  But taken as a whole, I honestly believe this album is well on par with his great works of the 1970s.<br />Heathen has real staying power, and quite honestly, I don't hear anything nearly as mature and interesting from any of db's peers any more.  When was the last time you actually thought a new Rolling Stones or Paul McCartney tune was worthy on its own?<br />Of course, I idolize the man, but sheesh has he lived up to his reputation here.  The finest album of 2002.

B00005QG9J|5.0|I am a music enthusiast. Music is basically what gets me up in the morning. This album by these &quot;nu-metal rockers&quot; (*gags*) is quite possibly one of the best I've ever heard. And here's why.<BR>Let's face it. There isn't much good in the music world today. I mean sure, there's stuff that I can listen to and say &quot;hey, not bad!&quot; but there is NO ONE that can make me say &quot;wow, how beautiful&quot;...that is...except for Incubus! This album literally gives me chills everytime I listen to it. The music, lyrics, and production are complete works of art. Brandon Boyd, Mike Einziger, Dirk Lance, Jose Pasillas II, and DJ Kilmore are geniuses, CASE CLOSED ON THAT! But what makes this album so great? The songs are incredible. The lyrics are clever, Brandon's singing is pure as gold, and the music is BEAUTIFUL. This album almost reminds me of some 1960's-70's concept album. It's truly a shame that Incubus is being abused by the mainstream music scene. Brandon Boyd, while I must admit is the most beautiful man on the planet, is being drooled over by TRL-loving teenyboppers. It's disgusting, and degrading to Incubus. They are true artists, and should be treated that way. But anyway, enough of the bashing! I'm not going to list all of the songs on this album and have a discription for them. YOU, the buyer, need to make that decision. Take it from me, someone who has little faith in music of today, every song on here is worth listening to (even the radio-hits; they're equally great as the other tracks). My parents, who are in their 50's, even think this album is great! This band has given hope to potentially SAVE rock and roll, so let's give them the credit they deserve! Kudos, and enjoy this modern-day masterpiece! ;)
0887306667|2.0|The basic principles in this book may or may not be valid. It's hard to tell, because most of the examples given are no longer valid. So much time is spent on IBM and computers in general, and we all know how much has changed in those areas in the last 8 years. The authors couldn't predict how things would go. They grossly underestimated the popularity of the PC and gave virtually no credit to Microsoft as a company that would be viable in the future. They touted Lotus 1-2-3 and were skeptical that \\"office suites\\" would ever catch on. (Microsoft Office, anyone?). I think the book is interesting from a historical perspective, but would be dangerous to apply to business today.
0375751467|4.0|This edition (Modern Library Paperback) has several distracting typos.  I had to refer to project gutenberg editions to find the correct text in several places.  Other reviewers have done justice to the content.
0316666343|4.0|The Lovely Bones was chosen for our monthly book group and it was one of the few books I've read lately that I couldn't put down.  <BR>The author's use of symbolism throughout the book was sometimes subtle, sometimes not, but always used well.  Her storytelling had a raw and dark edge to it, and at times I felt that I didn't want to read any more because I was afraid for the characters' safety; then, at the most dangerous moments in the plot, I couldn't turn the pages quickly enough.<BR>I found, while reading the last few pages of the novel, that I desired the same closure that the protagonist did, and didn't want the novel to end before that closure was recognized.  Sebold really allows her readers to feel that connection with Susie.<BR>This novel stayed with me for days after I finished it, haunting me both when awake and asleep.  I kept remembering small details from the plot that took on more meaning with time.  Very few books are able to grow after the last page is turned - this is one of them.<BR>I'd recommend this book to those who are interested in a gripping yet touching, well-written piece of literature.
B00005JL96|5.0|It's been a long time since Disney produced such a good film,worthy of its best masterpieces.Everything is as it should in a real old-times Disney:the backgrounds,the story,the animation,the characters.This comes as a relief after the rather disappointing Atlantis.In fact it is a child's dream come true, complete with good music and loopy Characters.
0385484518|5.0|I picked up this book at the local library and I read it this weekend and to my surprise it was a great book.  Morrie Schwartz was an outstanding individual whom had a great zeal for life and taught people around him how to really appreciate what is important in life which did not include money, fame or success.  However, Morrie showed his prize student Mitch that stopping to smell the roses, love, family and community were really the important things that mattered and God's true blessing. This book really moved me and I would recommend it to anyone who feels so overwhemled in their daily lives, because this book will give you the perspective of what is really important in life.
B00006AW2J|5.0|...  Everyone's eyes were now fixed upon The Rolling Stones.  The Stones had followed The Beatles into the 'Summer of Love' with the GREAT \\"We Love You/Dandelion\\" 45, ...  The Stones also came off their psychedelic high with the powerful \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash/Child of The Moon\\" 45 in 1968.  The single would have sat nicely along on this CD as a bonus cut, but that is another story altogether!  ...  Beggars Banquet shows the Stones getting back to their roots.<BR>...(nice slide on \\"No Expectations,\\" and sitar on \\"Street Fighting Man\\" (or was that an uncredited Dave Mason??????), ...<br />The new ABKCO remastered series CD's are sonically devistating in a lot of cases.  I would strongly suggest one only has to listen to the newly remastered version of \\"Street Fighting Man.\\"  I continue to hear new sounds between the multiple layers of Keith's acoustic guitars. The sitar is more audible than ever before and sounding great.  I am delighted to be reminded how great the Stones were from 1964-1976. These ABKCO remastered CD's are a VAST improvement upon the very inferior 1986 CD releases (I question if some of the 1986 releases were even from the correct or original master sources).<br />...
B00004TLN3|2.0|I guess the adaptations of Jane Austen's other novels spoiled me.  Cheesy is the word I would use to describe this movie.  I really didn't like anything about it.  I think the director wanted to make a gothic movie rather than a romance.  Plus, there were so many things in the movie that did not happen in the book.  These things make the movie terrible.  I would love for the BBC to make a film that was true to Austen's wonderful novels.  Pride &amp; Prejudice, Sense &amp; Sensibility, etc, were incredible adaptations.  Many people seeing the movies read the books as a result.  The opposite happens when people view the movie Northanger Abbey.
B00005QW5X|5.0|I've been a fan of musicals ever since I saw Dorothy go Technicolor in \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" when I was about five - but I had just about given up hope of a modern day musical. The last popular musicals were done in the seventies (Tommy, Rocky Horror, The Wiz), and they weren't really emotionally moving. Entertaining, yes - but thought provoking and touching, not exactly.<br />Hedwig has given me hope. Based on a play that became a cult hit in New York and other big cities, now it's been put on DVD with great care by its creator John Cameron Mitchell. He's done an excellent job of bringing Hedwig's energy and intimacy to the screen. I'd love to see him direct and star in more films.<br />The music is excellent and the lyrics surprisingly insightful. You have to watch this movie more than once to fully appreciate the intricate story, but the music will grab you right away. Stephan Trask is an amazingly talented writer.<br />Although not everyone may think of an East German transsexual punk rock whore as a heroin - I do. This is the story of her self-discovery, how she finds completeness within herself. She wants love and acceptance  just as we all do.
067941715X|5.0|I now want to explain myself: Jane Austen is the world's greatest author and everything she writes is wonderful.  I just think her other books deserve 10 or more stars.  NORTHANGER ABBEY compared to most books is just fabulous.  I read this book every few years and am amazed at how much more I dislike General Tilney.  Maybe I am imagining how angry I would be if he did to my daughter what he does to Catherine.  But I did enjoy reading about the terrible Thorpe siblings.  They are deliciously atrocious!  Catherine Moreland, the heroine of this delightful novel is a seventeen year old who has the marvelous good luck of accompanying a wealthy couple to Bath.  The people she meets in Bath all shape the next year of her life.  And, as in all of Austen's books, there are villains; but, as usual, the girl always gets her guy (or visa-versa) in the end!  This is why I love Austen!
0316666343|5.0|I admit. I was sceptical about this book. With all the disappearances and mayhem happening to children these days, who wants to read a book about a murdered 14-year old girl? The point is that the book is not about the crime, but the aftermath of tragedy. About the fragility of families and loved ones who have to go on with life after losing a part of it. <br />This book made me wince at times. In fact, alot of it is unpleasant. But it paints effectively a picture of a young girl taken in the prime of life and how the dead interact with the living. No one knows what heaven is like, but I felt comforted by Susie Salmon's journey into the great hearafter. Its not tinged with sympathy or religion. Its an unabashed, honest account of death, grief and recovery. I was in tears when I finished this book. It is a powerful story filled with poignancy, heart and catharsis.
B00005LC4B|4.0|Wouldn't you expect a movie that stars Gregory Peck, Robert Mitchum, Robert DeNiro, Nick Nolte, Jessica Lange, Juliette Lewis, Fred Thompson and Joe Don Baker to be outstanding.  Well you would be right in this case.  But it is DeNiro that steals the show.  He portrays yet another in depth character that keeps you riveted to the screen.  <br />Max Cady (DeNiro) was in jail for 14 years for a battery he was convicted of.  It was a rape but pleaded down by his lawyer portrayed by Nick Notle to a battery.  Nolte felt he was doing both Cady and the victim a service.  Notle rationalized that he was doing a service and Cady couldn't read anyway. <br />While in prison, Cady learns to read, and reads law books and transcipts and comes to the conclusion that his lawyer sold him up the river.  Cady has now become a smart nut case.  He knows the law and what he can and can't do. He bgins stalking and legally harrassing the entire family.  The law can do nothing, the PI's can do nothing.  It is up to the family. <br />Will they do something?  Will it escalate? Can it be stopped?  Watch this movie for the excellent story line, the superb acting, the suspense or for whatever reason you desire.  But watch it.  It is a great movie and another outstanding performance by Robert DeNiro.

0790736233|2.0|If you saw FIELD OF DREAMS, well, this is the sci-fi version of it, with a woman building a spaceship instead of a man building a baseball diamond.  Like so many movies in all genres in recent years, it is overblown and pretentious, actually fantasy with the trappings of science fiction.  It is technically excellent, of course.  Movies with multi-million dollar budgets generally are.  If you are looking for a movie that is really Serious with a capital S, don't miss this one.  It is serious, all right, but it is not much fun.
B000003S28|3.0|I love Eno's ambient works, I really do, but I don't feel that &quot;Music For Films&quot; is essential.  The pieces are so short that they don't have the opportunity to develop fully or organically the way the pieces on, say, &quot;Music For Airports&quot; do.  While some of the songs on &quot;For Films&quot; are quite beautiful in their own right, I find myself wishing they were longer -- right when I start to get into one, it ends and the next one begins.<br />Unless you're a rabid completist, I suggest you pick up &quot;Music for Airports&quot; or &quot;Apollo&quot; instead.
0812589041|4.0|I flew threw this book. I just happened to come accross this book and I am glad I did.  Unlike most books this stayts with you and has you thinking about it well after you have put it down.  There could of been better character development in some instances, but the main characters for the most part were well developed. The story is grand in scope, but stayed very personall which I liked. And the Science Fiction stayed light on the science so even those who are not big sci-fi fans can enjoy this book.
1587990717|5.0|This book explains in a way readily understood by the non-statistician a human frailty that bedevils us as investors:  Our intuition is unsuited to dealing with the kinds of uncertainty we face in securities markets.  The book shows how people are easliy fooled by phenomena that are common in markets -- sample-selection bias, events with low probability but high value (or high cost), etc.  If you haven't read the book, the foregoing may make its subject seem dry and esoteric.  In fact, the book is witty, and its subject matter lies at the center of decisions to own marketable securities of all kinds.  Few investors in marketable securities who have read this book will ever again make investment decisions the same way; I'll make bold to say that those few will be the dullest.  The melancholic reader will probably spend much less time on investment decisions after absorbing one of the books principal themes, which is that it is very often (perhaps we should say usually) impossible to distinguish investment luck from investment skill with available data.  The cynical reader will be gratifed to find his apprehensions confirmed that much &quot;track record&quot; data has been carefully selected to present luck as skill.  And the happy-go-lucky reader will be relieved to see it proven why the less often he checks his portfolio performance, the happier he will be.  Most readers will reap an improved sensitivity to the distinction between signal and noise, particularly in data concerning investment returns.
B00000DOZB|5.0|This is free-form yes at it's finest.  While not the most accessable work the've ever done, certainly some of their best.  The Gates of Delerium at over 20 minutes presents a full musical compliment of soaring highs and introspective lows.  Sound Chaser provides the type of frenetic energy only seen in the best jazz bands.  To Be Over mellows out to some of the finest melodic and steel guitar work Steve Howe has done to date.  The playing is intricate and free of the over produced self-indulgent rubbish the band was so prone to in the 80's and on.  This is the best keyboard work YES has seen by anyone (Patrick Moraz) outside of Rick Wakeman.  Alan White's drumming is also a highlight (especially on Sound Chaser).  Chris Squire, being one of the best,if not the best, in the business, is rock solid on bass.  In short if you are a YES fan this album will enthrall.  If only just getting to know them, you would be better off to start out with something like The Yes Album, or Fragile.  Enjoy your journey.
B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie is the most wonderful breath of loveliness to cross the big screen in many years. I chuckle at some of the reviewers who try to treat it as flawed art in some misunderstood tradition. . Let's get back to the basics of life, which is where art comes from. The director of this film followed his spirit, not Hollywood, thank God. This is a French movie, not an American movie; I restate the obvious because I have not seen anything emerge from Hollywood in a decade or more that is this uplifting, this entertaining, this funny, this poignant, this beautiful, and which leaves one feeling so wrapped in love. I don't know whether we Americans have lost the touch, or if we never had it. Oh... wait... Moulin Rouge comes close. I stand corrected. But Amelie reminds me of a long list of movies in the French tradition which leave me smiling and reassured that the world is not spinning off its axis and careening into the fearful abyss. Love and sweetness find their ways through any obstacles, however primitive or modern, and Amelie somehow connects the old and the new with that joi d'vivre wherein the most pathetic of human existences are all revealed to be golden at the core--all respond to the spirit of Love. <br />Amelie is entertainment that massages your spirit. Yes, I know I've used that word already; it's intentional--this movie works on the level of the human spirit! The vistas of Paris, from downtown to Montmartre, to the suburbs, will bring you wonderful memories, and if you haven't been to Paris, the movie will GIVE you memories. The trains, the stations, the streets, the cityscapes, the people... oh, and the music. Then let's not forget the charming Audrey Tautou, who delivers a character so sweet it aches in the solar plexus where you crave to know her. If you're dead to the world, you might not like Amelie, but if there is some spark in you that you remember once having but can't seem to find; I promise Amelie will find it and blow on it and set it ablaze again. If you, like me, find yourself looking at the current waves of movies to wash up on the surf from Hollywood, shaking your head and walking away empty handed and wondering if they've simply made all the good movies already and nothing worthwhile is left, this is the movie to spice up that malaise and set your mouth watering again.<br />I will spare  you another plot synopsis; one really cannot do it justice here anyway, but hear me--from my spirit to yours (oh my, there's that WORD again!) --I can't recommend this movie enough. As the original review stated, this is one of the most charming movies of all time. A classic. If you ever do one thing that ol' Shooshie recommends, do this one.<br />Shooshie
B00003CXI1|3.0|Good movie, but will be disappointing for fans of the series.  In it's defense: It does try much harder than most book-to-film adaptations to stay true to the book, although it was the little things that annoyed the hell out of me. For instance the major complaint I have is the placement of Harry's scar.  In all of the books, the lightning bolt shaped scar is located dead-center on Harry's forehead.  For some reason, in the films<br />it will be located off-center. Why? What purpose could there be to stray from this little tiny detail that I am sure all fans of the series would notice?<br />The main reason to watch this film can be summed up in two words:<br />Alan Rickman.<br />This guy kicks...! They couldn't have casted the role of Snape any better.<br />Worth seeing, but be sure to rent before buying as you could be dissapointed.
6305531412|1.0|There could have been so many extras here, and we get nothing. When the movie aired on network television, it put in entire sequences that made the cutting room floor, including the weasels painting a pig head on Eddie. Not only do they not give us the cut scenes, but I would have also liked to see some &quot;making of&quot; features or maybe some commentary. Anything! This movie deserves better.
6305014140|5.0|This is one of the greatest Japanese Animated films of all-time.  Just buy this and see.<br />The devils of Kimon have to be some of the most menacing figures in all of film history.  Brilliant story and great action leave you firmly placed on the edge of your seat for the entire picture.<br />My wife generally hates anime of all kinds(you should see her face when Dragonball Z comes on.*lol*) and she was even blown away by this masterpiece.<br />If you are looking to fill your anime collection, then this film is a must-have.  Plus, it looks truly wonderful on DVD.  Go, buy it and be happy.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Wilco's been moving into a wonderful direction with each new album, taking the best elements of pop and giving them their own sound. This culminates perfectly in &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot;, and they have truly outdone themselves.<br />Every song is a winner, whether it be the straight up catchy pop sound of &quot;Kamera&quot; or &quot;Heavy Metal Drummer&quot; to the more subdued meandering melodic &quot;Jesus, etc&quot; to the somewhere inbetween but equally wonderful &quot;I Am Trying to Break Your Heart.&quot;<br />I simply and without hyperbole love this album with everything in me.<br />I miss this album when I am away from home. My mind keeps returning to these songs, and I itch to be home and hearing them once more.
B0000214F0|5.0|\\"Caliglia\\" is, to sum it up as simply as possible, the disgusting smell after a lengthy flatulent episode. It's so over-the-top sexually pornographic, so melodramatically and excessively violent, so vile and repulsive, that it distinguishes itself from all other films. This tastless masterpiece is not only Malcom Macdowell's finest work besides \\"Clockwork Orange\\" but it's his most startling....anything in \\"Clockwork Orange\\" compared to this seems like it was taken out of an Olsen twin movie. And yes, all the major stars of the silver screen emerge here: Peter O' Toole, Helen Mirren and others, fondling and carressing, seducing and being seduced; it's repulsive, it's candid, it's beautiful. Only a film such as this could let you vomit and marvel at the art direction at the same time; only a film such as this could make you cringe in awe and disgust; only a film such as \\"Caliglia\\" could dominate the offbeatness of historical Rome, dwelling in it's own sexed-up style. Original, thought-provoking, \\"Caliglia\\" is for no one but those would wish their stomachs emptied, and their minds amazed.
6305014140|5.0|Yes this is another samurai anime like Rurouni Kenshin but this time its a feature film instead of a series and its about 10 times as violent, this movie is great for any Kenshin fan, that can handle these situations:<br />Violence: Lots of violence, probably the most violent anime I have seen even though I heard that Fist of the North Star was much more violent, the violence factor definately gets a solid R rating even though I have never seen violence like this in a real (non animated) moviel.<br />Sex: A small rape scene that isnt anything I would call \\"hentai\\" but still gets a 16+ rating which in Japan is the same thing as an R rating (yup you only gotta be 16 in Japan to watch the mature stuff, even though all \\"hentai\\" is 18+ in Japan which is the same as NC17 or 18+ rating in U.S.<br />Nudity: Not too bad, Limited to Breasts and Booty but it shows a few times where the crotch is supposed to be but for some reason it didn't show it, probably to keep this a 16+/R rating and not to take it in to the hardcore hentai rating since around 50% of the people who watch \\"samurai\\" anime like this are teens (13-18).<br />Profanity: Not too much profanity, mostly words like S--t, B-tch, and maybe the F words a few times but the profanity is around a pg-13 rating.<br />Altogether, this anime is sick, disturbing, and to some people a little perverted, so it would probably get a 16+/R rating (for adults or older teens). I hope this review will help parents decide whether to get this for their teens or for teens to hide this from their parents :-)
B000059XY5|2.0|Tim Burton returned to direct this sequel to the successful &quot;Batman,&quot; but here the premise is too dark and too grisly. Danny DeVito is just okay as the Penguin, but even worse is Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman. Michael Keaton has absolutely nothing to do with his role and this film is mostly just an excuse for Tim Burton to be scary. The plot is absurd, the characters are unconvincing, including Christopher Walken as a minor bad guy. Consequently, Burton did not return to direct the next two films.
B000001FS3|5.0|Being a U2 fan for many years, I thought the best U2 album was 'Achtung Baby' and didn't think any album by them could come close to it. <br />Well that all changed last week when I finally got around to buying 'Joshua Tree'. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it wasn't just an album to parade U2's probably three most famous songs. Talking of these three famous songs, if someone can name me an album which has a better trio of opening tracks than 'Where the Streets..', 'Still Haven't Found..' and 'With or Without You', I will truely be amazed. But as I was saying. This album isn't just about those three true great musical anthems. The first other song on the album that really struck me was 'Running to Stand Still'. A beautiful ballad about a heroin addict, it sees Bono at his song writing best. And then there is the truely amazing and unique 'Exit' - a real musical journey, building you to a musical frenzy and back again.<br />Other highlights of the album include the classic-rock styled 'Bullet the Blue Sky' and the ode to America 'In God's Country'. Most other classic albums have at least one 'album filler' track, but not with 'Joshua Tree'.<br />To conclude, all I can say is, do you think your music collection is complete? Well its certainly not complete without 'Joshua Tree' and if you don't own this album you are depriving yourself of a truely timeless epic album. <br />I certainly 'found what what I was looking for'...
B000059XXZ|4.0|Michael Keaton dons the cape and cowl in what is the best of the live-action Batman movies. No Robin in this one, as it centers around the origin of Batman and Joker. Tim Burton's directing is dark and almost scary. The sets for Gotham City were revolutionary at the time, looking gloomy and melancholy. Gotham is a dirty, ugly city and Burton portrays that perfectly. One complaint: there could have been more development of Batman. Keaton is given little to do here, but he makes a good Batman nonetheless. Most notably is Jack Nicholson's performance as the Joker. His presence in this movie is enough alone to steal the show. Nicholson is a highly talented actor and this movie confirms that statement.
0880389052|5.0|Drizzt is a dark elf and he is the best character created ever, tied with Raistlin from dragonlance. I can't say enough about this book. I have read the whole series twice. Drizzt is the baddest, fastest, intriging, character I have come across in a long time. You are immediately drawn into this book. You must get this book! Steal it! Something! Get this book!...oh...and read it, too!
B000059XY3|3.0|Val Kilmer is Batman in this third entry into the successful series. The Riddler is wreaking havoc on Gotham City and it's up to Batman to save the day. Chris O'Donnell plays Robin and joins a reluctant Batman in bringing down Riddler and Two-Face. Director Joel Schumacher makes &quot;Batman Forever&quot; a bright, stylized comic-book movie and succeeds for the most part. Tommy Lee Jones is silly as Two-Face and Jim Carrey is goofily over-the-top as the Riddler. Hold on to your bat-seats, fans. This is a good one!
B00005JKQZ|5.0|This is one of the best ever made ... it even follows the PBS documentary fairly close.
6305399212|5.0|James Cameron directed this second entry into the wonderful \\"Alien\\" saga and surpassed the creepy original. Sigourney Weaver returns as Ellen Ripley, last survivor of the doomed starship Nostromo. A colony is developing on the Aliens' planet and soon contact is lost with the colonists. Ripley must lead a group of hot-shot marines into the depths of the alien planet, confronting a huge alien queen. This is science fiction at its best. Loaded with action and still-great special effects, \\"Aliens\\" packs in an amazingly exciting 2 1/2 hours.
B000069HKH|4.0|I think it's ok, but I don't like the passage where Springsteen sings &quot;lalala&quot;, which is quite often repeated...<BR>All in all, I strongly recommend the CD, especially song 9!
0792101448|2.0|Oddballs who proclaim this the best western of all time must be easy to please.  No plot, please, or pacing, or intelligible diologue or character motivation.  Just some scenery and half a dozen excruciatingly long and slow set pieces are enough to transport their reviews. Whatever believability this wreck has at all is the work of the American actors Leone tapped.  Fonda, Bronson, Robards, Keenan Wynn, Jack Elam and Woody Strode, Lionel Stander all labor to inect some life into the proceedings under the leaden direction of a man who by all accounts couldn't speak a word of English.  As in all Leone's western work, most of the Italian players are hopeless, and poor Claudia Cardinale is the most gruesomely miscast of all.The screenwriting credits are shared among six men, but the film can hardly be said to have been written at all.  Many of the scenes look exactly as though they had been invented on the spot; inspired I suppose Leone's admirers would say.  What plot elements there are have been lifted from this western and that without any noticeable effort to put together a story. Devoid of humor, injected with a truly abominable muscial score and atrociously bad sound work (Bronson's phony harmonica bit is like a recurring toothache), and completely detached from any historical reality, Once Upon a Time in the West is pretty grim evidence of the fact that while other cultures can enjoy westerns they don't really understand and can't replicate them.
B000069CWE|3.0|First off let me start by saying i never bought Hybrid Theory, i have however heard all their singles on the radio a thousand times. In case u didnt know, this cd isn't a cd full of new linkin park songs, it is however their songs from hybrid theory remixed or \\"reanimated\\". For those ppl who dislieke this concept just dont buy the cd and wait for their new cd to come out. Let me point out i also am a big fan of techno and techno remixes of music. I think it adds a new level to the song, not necessarily better or worse but ads a new feel, and i think this cd does that quite well for the most part. Songs like Pts.Of.Athrty, By_Myself, and 1Stp Klosr really embody this kind of music well. I love and hate this cd for it though, b/c w/ the good comes the bad, and some of the remixed songs in my opinion are stripped of their beauty, such as Enth e nd (especially). I really wish they wouldnt have hired some rappers to dub over the song, b/c let me say, i dont think they had even heard the song b4. I mean come on, is the little \\"yo,yo,yo\\" intro necessary? (grits teeth). Well anyways, the cd halfway redeems itself w/ some masterful tracks. The remix of \\"crawling\\" may be the very best of them all, and ends the cd well. If your not a huge fan of rap/techno/or remixes for that matter but dont have hybrid theroy i would suggect it instead, if u already own hybrid theory pick this up only if ur open minded or just love linkin park. In short \\"a very surprising and interesting\\" release. Although a small disappointment in my mind.
B00003CXXP|5.0|I really don't know where to begin in reviewing this movie.  Kubrick has always been one of my favorite filmmakers ---- the guy's a genius.  So, upon hearing that Stanley wanted Spielberg to direct this movie, I knew that I would have to see A.I.  To say that I was blown away, or even touched by this movie, is an understatement.  I cried harder at this movie than any other movie I've ever seen in my life, and believe me, I've seen everything.  It's emotional, thought-provoking, intelligent, strange, confusing, depressing, and just plain sad.  Quite simply, it's an excellent movie.  I'm not one of those people who enjoys movies like &quot;Runaway Bride&quot;.  I enjoy films that require the viewers to think.  And believe me, A.I. does exactly that.  It's extremely deep, so it's very difficult to summarize, let alone put into less than 1000 words.  On the surface, this movie is about a robot(Haley-Joel Osment) who believes if he becomes real, his mother will love him in return.  Thus, he sets out to find the &quot;Blue Fairy&quot; who will grant his wish.  Upon deeper thinking though, A.I. seems to tackle more difficult issues, that perhaps, as humans, we're not yet ready to face in reality.  Questions about how humans tend to play God, how we view things that we deem inferior to ourselves, how we love, then discard, how we interfere with things we shouldn't; these are all topics that are repeated throughout Artificial Intelligence.  And for those of you who didn't like the ending or thought it too &quot;happy&quot; for such a depressing movie, I think have the wrong interpretation.  Yes, David is happy to be with his mother again, but ultimately, he learns what we as human beings already know: Love is not unconditional, and certainly is not eternal.  Love is not something that can be granted with the wave of a &quot;wand&quot;.  It's not something that is easily found or received.  That is why the ending is bittersweet, and why David is so much more &quot;real&quot;than any robot has been made before.  This movie makes you think.  But then again, isn't that what all great movies are supposed to do?!  This movie is certainly original, but that's no reason to dislike it.  Give it a chance.  Spielberg should make more movies like this, instead of resorting to those cliched-Hollywood blockbusters he's famous for.  This is the epitome of filmmaking.  Bravo!!
B000065U1N|5.0|Shipping was prompt. Little to no waiting. DVD in great shape to be used and the movie itself was so realistic you knew what real war was. Thanks
B00005Y228|5.0|Kylie has done it again, cranking out an amazing and (slightly) innovative album. Why she just became popular in the US recently is anyone's guess. She delivers a strong dance CD with very VERY few flaws.<br />More More More (7/10)- She opens the CD on an average song. It's really repetitive and light. It's not something that you can really dance to, because the beat is slightly lacking. It's kind of hypnotic though, with the chorus' \\"You know I want you more more more\\". Definately not a good choice for the first track.<br />Love At First Sight (8/10)-  but this song isn't all that great. I don't think it should have been a single. It's not the worst track though. It's just too happy for me. It's like a sugar coated techno song. It's kind of scary.<br />Can't Get You Out Of My Head (9/10)- This song is great, everyone has heard it. It's flat out dance, and definately very easy to get up and groove to. The only bad thing about the song is that it gets old fast. But if you stop listening to it for a while, and come back, it's just as good as it first was.<br />Fever (10/10)- One of my favorites. This song is really cool, especially the opening instrumental. The lyrics are really bizarre, it's about having a fever...it's bad lyrics, but definately one of the best songs on the entire track. It's kind of eerie.<br />Give It To Me (9/10)- VERY HIGH ENERGY! Great song. It's probably the most fun track on the CD. Sadly, it's only 2:50, and leaves you wanting more, yet it obviously doesn't deliver. The lyrics are extremely suggestive by the way...<br />Fragile (5/10)- A lot of people hate this song. I am one of them. This song is so low energy it's sad. Had it been a normal ballad, it would be a good song. But she tried to make it a techno-ballad....it's definately one you won't listen to very often.<br />Come Into My World (10/10)- One of the best tracks. It's really eerie, and reminds me of cruising the city at night. It's definately a dance track. Rumor has it that it will be the next (and last) single off of Fever. More Kylie! We want more songs like this.<br />In Your Eyes (7/10)- I used to really like this song. Just...it's too trance for me. It's not a dance track, although there is a great dance in the video. Very colorful too.<br />Dancefloor (10/10)- WOW! This is a GREAT track! It should have been a single! It's really party material, and is fun to dance to. It's probably the oddest song on the CD, but will keep you listening to it multiple times. I haven't met one person that doesn't like this song.<br />Love Affair (9/10)- This song is really fun. It's not one of my favorites, but I have to give it credit. It's extremely fun to dance to. I was at a friends party once and this song played 2 times...just goes to show ya how good it is! Very dancable.<br />Your Love (10/10)- While the song may not be the best on the CD, it's the intro that makes me give it a 10. It's really eerie and sad sounding. Then it quickly turns into a dance track. It has a guitar of some sort in the song. The chorus is kinda creepy, especially the transition into the next verse.<br />Burning Up (8/10)- This song makes you wonder why the hell it's on the CD...until the chorus. It speeds up BIG TIME! But the lack of lyrics is kind of a turn off.<br />Buy the CD if you love dance and techno! It's worth it! Especially buy it if you can find the version with the bonus tracks.
B000069AUI|5.0|Once again, these four men have proven to me that they can make the most appealing melodies go with an achingly haunting and beautiful voice. In my opinion, Chris Martin has the best male voice out there. And he proves it with their sophomore album. I've listened to ROBTTH almost every day since the day it was released. It just keeps getting better and better. Hopefully, one day they will be able to break free from the Travis and Radiohead comparisons because they are a band that deserves their own acclaim. My personal faves are God Put a Smile on Your Face and Warning Sign.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This is really the best film i have ever seen! Eventhough it normally never happens, this film made me cry..
B000068CNX|4.0|I noticed another comment posted earlier where the individual spouted his/her views on the show &quot;Friends&quot;.  May i remind him that the purpose of the comment section is to rate the DVD not the subject matter of the show.  Overall, I found this installment of Friends to be on par with the first season in overall video and sound quality.  Again, the special features are weak and I would love to see some real commentary from the cast in future seasons.  Of course considering how much the cast gets paid for each episode, I'm sure the DVD producers would lose money on the deal.  Still a must-have for friends fans.
B000002I7R|4.0|Buy this album if only for the song &quot;Like I've Never Been Gone&quot;.  The guitar solo in this song is excellent and very Page-esque - I get chills every time I hear it.<br />The rest of the album is also very good.  Check it out.
B00005A1PR|5.0|You know it's a good album when the first time that pops to mind in the morning are songs from it.  &quot;Video&quot; was stuck in my head this morning and &quot;Ready For Love&quot; made me want to cry as I listened to it on the way to work.  In the afternoon on the way home, &quot;Strength Courage and Wisedom&quot; uplifted me.  Truely, these songs are from the heart and are ment to touch it.  India Arie's lyrics are a pure joy to recite.
B00003CXTG|4.0|The problem with attempting to recreate one of the 20th century's most infamous events is that all of us know too much and are much too jaded to relate to the all-too predictable, often trite, and pot-boiling storyline linking the main three characters in this adventure-romance version of the Japanese attack on the U.S. Navy deep harbor facility in Hawaii that became the outbreak of World War Two for Americans. With movies like \\"In Harms Way\\" and \\"Tora, Tora, Tora\\" already telling the story so well, what could another film offer? While all of the actors do a credible job in delivering their performances, most of it seems like D&eacute;j&agrave; vu all over again. Once again, this seems more than anything to be due to the fact that we are all quite familiar with the string of events based both on our own educations as well as with altogether too many movies about the Japanese sneak attack.<br />Moreover, the entire attempt to give Ben Affleck's character flying experience by thrusting him into the battle Of Britain as an American \\"volunteer' is hokey and historically inaccurate. And his disappearance in a flaming wreck off the coast in a dogfight with ME-109s seems most contrived of all. Yet, in spite of all these objections, this movie is well worth watching, not only because it zooms spectacularly past the Pearl Harbor event and covers later action against the Japanese, but also because the special effects are so fabulously accomplished that this version of the actual attack, with its ingenuous interpretation of the attack and battle sequences, is destined to become the definitive interpretation of the historical event. I have watched that portion of the DVD over and over again, for it takes the viewer on a breath-taking excursion into the skies above the islands, and virtually recreates the atmosphere of the battle so vividly that it becomes an unforgettable experience.<br />Amid all the historical controversy regarding whether or not the American command structure had advanced warning and allowed the carnage to take place, the silly romance that plays out its personal history is of little consequence, and the viewer finds it hard to worry too much about the characters amid all this excitement, all these explosions, and all these attack sequences so lavishly and expertly threaded together. This DVD package has a lot of ancillary material that adds to one's understanding of what it is that happened at Pearl Harbor, and what the roles of the flyers, sailors, nurses and others were in coming to terms with what happened that day. This is an interesting and captivating movie event, although I would advise the viewer to concentrate on the visual effects and not got bogged down by the romantic aspects of the movie.

I could visualize every moment.  This was the first book by King i have ever read and if all are like this it certainly will not be the last.
0876855575|5.0|What can I say, this book is brilliant. I would recommend this as a starting point for anyone getting into Bukowski. I read Betting On The Muse first, and I couldn't quite appreciate his poetry until after I'd read this. Hank Chinaski is the embodiment of everyman's underbelly. Sometimes raunchy and inappropriate, other times excruciating and vulnerable, but always completely honest. This one should be required reading for all of mankind.

B00005JKWJ|5.0|The original Blade was regarded as the beginning of the resurgance of comic book movies, and its sequel tops it in every way possible. I just saw this last night and my head is still spinning. Vampire hunter Blade (Wesley Snipes looking totally badass) returns two years after the original movie in search of his reincarnated mentor Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), and after he finds him he is made an offer. A new breed of vampires called the Reapers are taking out normal vampires, and the vampire lord offers Blade a temporary truce so he can hunt them with his new associates the Blood Pack which is led by Reinhardt (Ron Perlman). The movie is slow in the first hour and a half, but the pace quickly builds up when secrets are revealed and Blade learns all is not what it seems, and what results are the best action scenes in a movie I've seen since The Matrix, excellent special effects (although some of the CGI could have been more polished), and the bloodiest goriest martial arts melee you'll ever see in a movie adapted from a comic book. My only complaint is that we didn't get to see martial arts great Donnie Yen (a member of the Blood Pack) for very long, it would have been great to see him and Snipes go at it in a fight scene.  All in all, Blade 2 is one of the few cases where a sequel outshines the original film, and this Platinum Series DVD is packed with extras: commentaries by director Guillermo Del Toro and Snipes himself among others, trailers, a strategy survival guide for the upcoming PS2 and XBox Blade 2 video game, and a Cypress Hill with Roni Size music video.  Sink your teeth into it as soon as you can.

B00000IREA|5.0|Batmania swept America and Hollywood stars like Shelly Winters and Tallulah Bankhead were crawling all over each other to be part of the craze.Dino De Laurentiis and/or Roger Vadim picked up the rights to the French Comic book  Barbarella for Vadim's wife, Jane Fonda and rode the wave.It worked \\"Henry's Little Girl Jane\\" as Life Magazine put it, made the cover as Barbarella.Unlike Batman , Barbarella wasn't marketed to kids.It's as much French Farce as it is a Camp Classic.Unlike Flesh Gordon it had no intentions of crossing the line to become a \\"porno\\" film with FX.All the \\"bad\\" stuff that makes it good, mentioned in other reviews, was intentional. The audience is let in on the joke from the start. The opening lyric of the title song refers to an American Comic Book heroine \\"You're a wonder Wonder Woman\\" and then proceeds to rhyme Barbarella with Psychedela in the chorus.Jane's performance clearly shows she's in on the joke.The death traps are very \\"Batman\\".Sure it's heavily influenced by the Sixties Pop Culture but, it in turn influenced  American Pop Culture  for years. The  character Vampirella,  and the band Duran Duran didn't come by those names by coincidence.It's certainly  more  fondly remembered and in demand than Vadim/Fonda's \\"The Game Is Over\\".Check out how many people even bothered to review that one.This one merits repeat viewings because it's fun.
0060977493|4.0|Arundhati Roy explores the rich traditions/values of the Indian heritage through the eyes of Estha and Rahel...brother and sister. The stories take on a few tangents here and there, but overall this book dives into sexual abuse, relational, gender,political, caste and familial issues in India. She has laid everything in color and nothing is in black and white. Whatever Ms. Roy says is sharp and blunt, yet it is truth-seeking which makes this book far more appealing to the reader. The imageries of the stories are far more robust and when reading, the reader gets a picture and a vision of the scene..which is important to understand and comprehend any book such as this! I highly recommend this book...you will probably get finished in two to three days...that's how long it took me!!! =) Happy Reading!!
0425179877|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book, especially that Mr. Kranz wrote it himself without the help of a ghost writer.  Once you get over the fact that this author clearly thinks of himself as a hero, and wants to remind the reader of his personal accomplishments once or twice a chapter, this book contains alot of very interesting information related to the early days of NASA.<br />This was clearly a dynamic time, full of technological developments born out of a need at NASA.  A time worthy of such an interesting book.<br />I was disappointed that although the cover talks about events through to the 80's there was no lengthy discussion on events after the Apollo program.  There nothing discussing the events of the Challenger disaster, a period in which NASA operations pushed a &quot;Failure Is The Only Option&quot; approach.  But this would fly in the face of the NASA Mr. Kranz believes that he helped to create.<br />All in all: a good book to read, about a remarkable time, from a man with an enormous ego.
B000001E7T|5.0|This album is completely stunning. First off, I basically bought all of PJ's albums in reverse order: \\"Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea\\"; \\"Is This Desire?\\" \\"To Bring You My Love\\", \\"Rid of Me\\", \\"Dry\\", \\"4 Track Demos\\", \\"Dancehall at Louse Point.\\" But this one has to be my ulitmate favourite. I feel so depressed when i listen to it, but that's the beauty of it: once it's over, i feel better. I love all of her albums dearly, but this one is really great. SPIN magazine even hailed it the #3 album of the 90's.<br />TO BRING YOU MY LOVE <BR>Perfect way to start off the album, what with her amazing vocals and the eerie organ in the background.<br />MEET ZE MONSTA<BR>Remniscient of a real hard-rock song, with the loud guitars, PJ's howls, and whistles. Excellent.<br />WORKING FOR THE MAN<BR>This song is a little weird, but i still love it. You can barely understand a work she says, but the song is actually about God. The only instruments found here are her voice, some drums, and some bass.<br />C'MON BILLY<BR>One of 3 highlights, this song is so full of emotion, especially towards the end.<br />TECLO<BR>I don't understand this song, but i like it anyway...kinda prepares you for \\"Long Snake Moan.\\"<br />LONG SNAKE MOAN<BR>Ahh, the second huge rocker on this album. This is a good and loud song, and i especially love the line \\"It's my voodoo working...moan!!\\"<br />DOWN BY THE WATER<BR>The album's best (and oddest) song. I was definately surprised to see this one as a successfuln single, but it IS a great song. And everytime it's on MTV2's ControlFreak, it wins :-)<br />I THINK I'M A MOTHER<BR>Good follow up to \\"Down by the Water.\\" Here again, you can barely understand what she says her, and the music's so low and full of bass. I love the lyric \\"I need you mother/more than ever.\\"<br />SEND HIS LOVE TO ME<BR>Reminds me of \\"C'mon Billy\\"...really good song, with an excellent ending.<br />THE DANCER<BR>I *love* this song!! It's such a perfect way to end the album, and i'malmost in tears by the time it's over with. This song contains the best lyrics: \\"cause i've prayed days/i've cried nights/oh Lord be near me tonight/is he near?/is he far?/bring peace to my black and empty heart.\\"<br />This album is so good, and is definately worth the money.
B00000K2SC|5.0|&quot;...more philosophical, yet interesting action packed movie ever made&quot;...The Matrix is truly a masterpiece of Hollywood, in a time when mostly watered-down comedy, drama, action garbage is spewed forth by Cali...<br />We are immediately transported into a place that is similar, yet altogether too different and strange from the world we know today...The Matrix, believe it or not has bases in metaphysics and even theology...metaphysics? you say....well when you think about it, the premise of this world not being here and it really being a farce is really metaphysical in nature as it deals w/our very existence...there are also very credible parallels between The Matrix and Christianity, as Morpheus is &quot;resurrected&quot; in the movie, and Neo has to lead his followers to ultimate triumph...in fact, he is leading his people from slavery, which directly relates to the Christian idea of Moses leading his people from slavery...<br />on a simpler level, The Matrix is a movie which is 100% enjoyable...it is filled w/action scenes, cliff-hangers, and ideas that will make you think...before Morpheus blatantly explains what the Matrix is, and shows Neo to the desert of the real, the watcher has to wonder what IS the matrix?<br />on an acting note, Keanu Reeves is admirable in this leading role, and his supporting actors (forgive me for not knowing their names, im not the biggest movie buff ever) are excellent in being believable in the people they are supposed to be...the movie also throws a curve w/one of the characters which keeps it on a very real level, keeping the ideas and characters w/i this world despite delving into great levels of sci-fi<br />The Matrix is a movie i waited too long to see...do not make the same mistake, it is a fantastic movie...please go watch it and make yourself happy
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool has yet again stunned the old school and the new school with this daring new album that cannot be taken light heartedly. The recent loads of core rock that paint faces and dress in black have totally missed the point yet tool portray themselves the same way but to them and us, it comes naturally.<br />Survival of the first few songs is near most impossible, and if you think that is a synch, closing your eyes is a totally different experience. There is a disturbing swirl of instruments and a chanting slur of heavenly disorientated voices. Although you can feel that you do not know where you are as in terms of songs and location, every now and then you are brought back into reality and swung the other way toward a calming lullaby (Parabol). Once that Maynard James Keenan feels that you have delve deeply enough into the enveloping entrapments of heaven, he then rips you out without missing a beat in a scream of temper-like abuse (Parabola).<br />The names of some of the songs (Eon Blue Apocalypse, Schism and Faaip De Oiad) paint a distorted, sickening picture of what to expect in the song although there are two sides to all of Maynard's spells in the eyes of others. Through the times Tool have brought out much of the same songs as each new album has a small trail of the other but as each new album definitely evolves from the last leaving the listener stunned and amazed. All the Tool albums are spine tingling and require more than one sitting to digest the whole amount of the overwhelming serve.<br />All the members of Tool have probably escaped from the loony bin but that doesn't stop the addiction that flows through your body at an enormous pace setting and stating the border of fear and fearless. Dany Carrey's drumming is unbelievably scary which binds together the patchwork of unbalanced time frames and a chaotic melody that literally changes the rhythm of your heat.<br />The beat of the chanting music is unmatchable as it is not stacked like the leaning towerof Pisa, not knowing when it will all crumble and fall to the ground. No, no the music is somehow very alive, it breathes and almost sucks you into it as you mind twists down a spiralling staircase.<br />Maynard is unable to loose a challenge and doesn't come close to any other artist. The music is unlike any other, the tune can never be remastered, the timing can never be pulled off again and the thought that is portrayed is indescribable. Yet nothing on the album is predictable unless you are an absolute Tool nut. This is not music, it is in it's own class of Art, it makes art. Lateralus is truly a masterpiece.
B00005T30L|5.0|I rented Ghost World because I never got to see it in the theatres.I never knew about it when it was in the theatres and one day just saw it at my local video store.One day I decided to just check it out and I was very very glad.The movie was filled with great things.The acting was great,the plot was great,the score was excellant,and just the combination of every thing put together.It all makes one great two hours of comendy and drama,and it just makes you think alot about things.Even though the movie is not a teen movie there are teens in it making it good for everybody who is a teen and above.The movie does have alot of profanity which makes it not for children but everybody eles is ok.The is definatly one of the greatest movies of all time.<br />The cast is consisted to about 5 main characters.Those main characters are Enid who is played by Thora Birch,Scarlett Johansson,Steve Buscemi,Brad Renfero,and Illiana Douglas.Steve Buscemi and Scarlett Johansson are two of my favorite actors and they shine on the screen in this movie while Thora Birch who I never saw in anything didn't have me to much.Even though she was very good in the movie I just never knew how to rate her.Illiana Douglas I only saw on an episode of Frasier where in the credits I aroused myself to one simple question.Who the heck is Brad Renfero?<br />The plot is focused around Enid(Thora Birch)and Rebbeca(Scarlett Johansson)who just graduated from hign school and are planning to skip collage and move in with each other.They are very different from other people and seem to always be in there own little world as they love to pester there friend Josh who works ay a grocery store called the Sidewinder where a trouble maker loves to hang out at and basecially cause trouble.One day they follow two Satanists and end up at a 50's theme diner.There they decide to call a man who wrote a ad in the personals asking about is some girl remembered him from a couple of days ago.They decide to call and pretend to beher and then they watch as he gets stood up by no one.Enid ends up befriending the man whose name is Seymour(Steve Buscemi)and one things leads after anthor and then by the end of the summer her whole life is turned upside down.<br />Ghost World was very different then what I thought it was going to be like.One of the greatest elements of the movie was it's score which blew me away.Ghost World is almost perfect in everyway and I am proud to own a copy of the DVD.<br />ENJOY!
B0000640VO|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  A work of art in every sense of the word.  The title character was crafty and charming, and the wide eyed Audrey Tautou shimmered in the role.  Rarely does a film come along that makes you feel so wonderful about life, especially the small things.  You may even want to take your graden knome out with you this vacation season.
B000002P5W|5.0|This really is a very excellent Cd.  Axis:Bold As Love is one of those fine albums that are perfect from the beginning to the end.  The only nit to pick is the first track \\"EXP\\", which sounds like Hendrix and his boys had too many drugs and too much spare time.  The album really gets going with the wonderful \\"Spanish Castle Magic\\" which is metal before metal existed.  From there, the album really flies off, and the listener is placed in a catochism of Hendrix guitar magic.  <BR>From \\"Spanish Castle Magic\\" to the last track \\"Bold As Love\\" not one song is really any worse than the other.  Best Cuts?<BR>\\"Spanish Castle Magic\\" gets the album rocking.  The serene \\"Little Wing,\\" an excellent example of Hendrix's masterful guitar playing.  \\"If 6 was 9\\" is kinda blues sounding and a wondeful song.  Other good ones are \\"Castles Made of Sand,\\"<BR>the funky \\"Little Miss Lover,\\" with the slap guitar, and lastly <BR>\\"Bold As Love,\\" a wonderful ending to a wonderful album.
B000002UDD|3.0|Of course, it's hardly \\"Countdown to Extinction,\\" either...having added a new guitarist and a new drummer, the lack of chemistry shows on this '88 release.<br />I don't exactly claim to know what Dave and company were trying to accomplish on \\"So Far,\\" and I'm not really sure I WANT to know.  Uncharacteristically, we have Megadeth trying to fit half a dozen rhythm changes into each five-minute song, and that just doesn't work.  Even Mercyful Fate, who was probably the best at it around this time, needed at least six or seven minutes for that many alterations in tempo.<br />For the most part, these songs just sound disjointed, as if the guys wrote the music but didn't really know what to do with it.  \\"502\\" is VERY out of place and could probably have been left on the cutting room floor.  The remake of the Sex Pistols' song \\"Anarchy in the UK\\" really doesn't belong here, either.  It just seems too...well...up.<br />To be sure, there are flashes of Megadeth's former and soon-returning brilliance, especially on \\"My Darkest Hour\\" and \\"Hook in Mouth,\\" but the entire album really just sounds TIRED.  If memory serves, this is right around the time when Dave Mustaine began to burn out.
B00006EXDM|5.0|I picked this up to see how well the new remastering sounded on the Stones remastering/reissue project. I do not have a SACD compatible player but the sound on a regular player is also much better.  It is not nearly as muddy sounding and stereo versions of some the songs were used instead of mono.  Just listen to the better clarity of Charlie Watt's drumming on cuts like \\"Get Off My Cloud\\" and \\"Honky Tonk Women\\".  Bill Wyman's bass never sounded better on \\"19th Nervous Breakdown\\".  The backing vocals on \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" and Mary Clayton's vocals on \\"Gimme Shelter\\" are much clearer.  Brian Jones sitar on \\"Paint It Black\\" sounds great.  Bobby Key's sax break on \\"Brown Sugar\\" is in your face.  The marimba on \\"Under My Thumb\\" and extra percussion on \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\" sounds much better and \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\" sounds incredible. The songs themselves are the legendary hits from the \\"greatest rock and roll band in the world.\\"  Some people have suggested that casual fans should pass on this and wait for the new \\"40 Licks\\" 2 cd set to come out.  I recommend picking this up as well.  There are many songs on this set which are not included on that set and in addition I do not know if the new remastering will be used on that set.  The only drawback is that for a 2 cd set the time is rather skimpy (around 85 minutes).  They should have added some more cuts to this set.  For example cuts like \\"Little Red Rooster\\", \\"You Better Move On\\" and were included on the British versions of \\"Big Hits\\" and \\"Through The Past Darkly\\" respectively but not on the US versions or \\"More Hot Rocks\\".  Also the single \\"I Wanna Be Your Man\\" was not included on \\"Hot Rocks\\" or \\"More Hot Rocks\\".  However, if you can only afford one Stones set this is definately the one to get. You also might want to add \\"More Hot Rocks\\" which includes many more great cuts not included on the first \\"Hot Rocks\\" set along with some rarities.  Kudos to the remastering job!
B00006AW2F|3.0|I am glad Abkco finally decided to issue this on disk.  It is a sixties era outtake collection from the Abkco years.  The collection itself is rather mediocre collection of alternate takes and rare and unissued tracks.  In addition they decided to remaster the UK version of the 1975 lp which has 2 additional tracks not found on the US version.  Among the cuts are alternate takes of \\"Out Of Time\\", \\"Heart Of Stone\\" (supposedly with a guitar break by Jimmy Page) and \\"Memo From Turner\\".  The first half of the disk is the weaker half and many of the songs do not have the full participation of the full Stones band.  Other than \\"Heart Of Stone\\" the best cut on the first half of the disk is the unissued take on Chuck Berry's \\"Don't Lie To Me\\". The second half of the disk is better with many of the outtakes coming from the \\"Beggar's Banquet\\" and \\"Let It Bleed\\" sessions.  The two best cuts are the great \\"Jiving Sister Fanny\\" with a good guitar break by Mick Taylor and \\"I'm Going Down\\".  Both of these cuts are hard rocking numbers.  Another interesting cut is a cover of \\"I Don't Know Why\\" by Stevie Wonder. It has some great slide guitar by Mick Taylor.  It also contains a rare Bill Wyman penned cut called \\"Downtown Suzie\\"  On the downside \\"Family\\" may be one of the worst songs penned by Jagger/Richards.  The sound is great but some liner notes listing session and personnel would have been helpful.  Interesting for Stones fanatics like myself but casual fans should start some where else.
B00006690G|5.0|This CD is one of the best CD's ever released it is a must buy! If you have any since at all you'll love this CD with a passion. The only song thats not all that good is \\"My Dad's gone Crazy\\" but that is the only one that is not good, and thats not too bad! Don't listen to the stupid guy talkin about its not good because with songs like \\"super man, without me, Halies Song, Square Dance, Cleanin out my Closet\\", and others. THIS CD IS A MUST BUY, YOU CAN LISTEN TO THIS \\"MONDAY THROUGH SUNDAY, YO!\\"
0316666343|5.0|Can't recommend this book highly enough.  I loved it.  The perspective of a victim following her friends and family through the aftermath of the crime was fresh; the writing crisp and witty and warm.  And the ending was superbly worked -- not the neat all-ends-tied that you expected.  You will love this work.  I did.
B000002W3R|5.0|I am sitting here tonight listing to this original album. It has been heart wrenching to say the least. ... I foud it to be so uplifting and yet I am sad to know that he died soon after this was released.<br />Little Darlin'--- He sure could hit those high notes in that song! One word for that is WOW!!!<br />If You Love Me Let Me Know and Let Me Be There WONDERFUIL re makes of Olivia Newton John's classic songs.<br />Moody Blue--- The man was in GREAT voice on this one competes right there with all the disco songs of the time.<br />...I had the orginal Blue Record but my brother trashed it... Would love to see the Original album re pressed in the blue Vynl to commerate this great album.<br />...
B00006EXCC|4.0|Can anyone help me please.  Next to being a great fan of the Stones, I am very much a &quot;tight-wad&quot;.  I want it all, but don't want to pay for CD's that constantly overlap the same songs.  Let me try to explain my delimma.  I would love to have simply the first 100 or so songs that the Stones first recorded especially the remastered versions that are now in true stereo.  I really don't care what the name of the LPs were.  I just want all the songs without buying more CDs then I have to. I would like to see maybe getting all the early British Versions on CD then a CD of the remaining songs that were not included like the Beatles did with Past Masters. Unfortunatly and logically, this is not going to happen.  So what can I do?  Like do I have to get the UK AFTERMATH CD to get Mother's Little Helper (in stereo), and still buy the US version to get Paint It Black.  Do I have to get the UK BETWEEN THE BUTTONS and the US FLOWERS CDs eventhough about half the songs are on both CDs. I just want to know how to get the biggist bang for the buck!  With the Stones catalog it will not be easy to do.  And with the new remastered versions it is even more confusing.  But I suppose if the only way to do this is to buy them all, and there is no other way, I'll do it.  I want very much to have these songs in my collection.
0399146369|3.0|This is the latest in the adventures of Kaye Scarpetta, Virginia State's chief medical examiner.  As usual, Cornwell keeps her characters off-balance by both events and the horrific nature of those events.  Much is revealed about some of the continuing characters, including Benton, who died a couple of books ago.<br />There is always a bizarreness to Scarpetta's life, but never more than in this tale.  She is stalked by a man known as Le Loup Garou (the werewolf) whose real name is Jean Baptiste Chandonne.  There are a number of murders, that may or may not be related.  And Richmond's cowardly DA arranges to have Chandonne tried in New York City, where only one of his crimes is known to have occurred.  More outrage for Scarpetta.<br />As usual the story is as much about Scarpetta as it is the criminals and victims.  The descriptions of the forensic science is detailed.  Sometimes too much so.  It's as if Cornwell wants to let us know everything she has learned about the field.  With a recorded volume, it is more difficult to just skim over the wealth of detail.  A good editor could have tightened up the exposition in many places.<br />Ms. Reading, the reader, has a gift for accents, but occasionally loses them as dialogue becomes lengthy.  <br />This is an apt continuation of the Scarpetta story and Cornwell's vast following will enjoy it.  The gruesome world of forensic science is a fascinating one for those of us who can visit for a time then move on.  In many ways Cornwell's books featuring Scarpetta have been a great addition to police procedurals and thrillers.
B000001EL7|5.0|Even though none of the Kiss albums were entirely recorded by the orginal members of Kiss, read liner notes &amp; Gene Simmon's book,  this is by far the best album in their entire catalog.  Plaster Caster is single handelely the greatest Kiss song.  For a perfect introduction to Kiss music get this album.
B00005JL1C|4.0|Sometimes a movie you saw in the past creeps up out of your psyche, and all of a sudden you can't get it out of your head. This was one of those movies for me. I saw this movie on VHS on it's original (tape) release over 10 years ago, and again when the Laserdisc was released years later. Now, on DVD, you get an excellent transfer and pristine movie theater sound quality.<br />John Hughes was made famous for capturing teen angst in a way that identified with most teenagers of the period. I think &quot;Some Kind of Wonderful&quot; Hughes is at his best with a realistic story about dealing with love, friendship, and peer popularity. There are famous faces that sneek into this character roles that are great fun to watch. But it's the romantic triangle that keeps the story moving until the end.<br />I'd definitely recommend this movie for those looking for a romantic comedy that makes you think and reminisce about your youth in the 80s. For those already in their teens, you may find this period of fashion and attitude interesting to watch and compare against the current high school scene.
B00003CY6M|5.0|I love this movie because it actually makes you feel like things happen for a reason and it lets you dream that everyone will find that one special person out there.  If you like movies that let you escape from everyday life then you'll love this one. Not to mention that John Cusak just gets better looking with age! :)
0812580346|2.0|It's an interesting concept, although Sawyer does not present the science in a way that makes it believable and his ability to draw characters is limited. But if you're not too picky and you're willing to read a book just for the unusual ideas, then give it a try.
B000069AUI|5.0|I thought they had created an amazing CD with Parachutes.  I never imagined that it could get any better than that, but it has. It's an amazing, amazing, amazing CD. The scientist is a beautiful song, and is just one of the many gorgeous songs on the CD.
630516889X|5.0|The \\"Predator\\"is the most mind blowing movie i have seen in the<BR>last 20 years.To me it is like going to a football game and having fun,letting your hair down, and suddenly understanding that you yourself are the ball and that players of both teams are bearing down upon you to have possession of you.It has had an affect on me ever since I borrowed the video by chance off my sister in 1991.<BR>I recently purchased the double disc special edition DVD and would like to road test it for you.<BR>For those of you not aquainted with the film \\"Predator\\"I will quickly elaborate it for you.<BR>Arnold Schwarzenegger,whose character in the movie is Dutch,is the leader of a crack task force which generally engage in affairs of extraordinary nature.They are not controlled by the government or any affiliated body and are like a very deadly but close knit family.Dutch and his men are given the mission to locate a terrorist stronghold in latin America and at the same time retrieve any maps or documentation about strategic targets of terrorism.They are also given the mission of finding out what happened to another team sent on that same mission only a few weeks previously.<BR>Being the crack demolition/seek and destroy squad they are,we see them easily moving into top gear and rolling over the terrorists with a minimum of fuss or opposition.<BR>It is then,upon withdrawing,after also already having solved the problem of finding the missing task force,that they are thenprivy to the fact that there is also another obstacle in their way.One which is neither assailable or comprehensible with human means.This happens to be a being which exists solely for the purpose of sport and sees the withdrawing task force as worthy competitors/trophies for his mantlepiece.This being has stealth technology and laser weaponry and is able to evade the high powered weapons of Dutch and his team.It picks off the combattants one by one and where the task force was seemingly invincible against a foe of which they understood and could calculate their every move,they are made to look weak and diminutive in comparison to a foe which knows no morals nor human emotion.It knows only victory and once a foe is vanquished it rips the skull and spinal column out,polishes it up and proudly eyes it up and down as one would a premiership cup or championship ring.<BR>The unsuspecting and completely outgunned taskforce all fallby the wayside and it is left to Dutch to finally,by chance,work out that the creatures vision allows it to see the skin of its prey.Dutch can only then overcome the creature when he is able to accidentally camouflage his body and can see the creature as it turns off its stealth mode in trying to locate Dutch's movements. <BR>Dutch does confront it in one of the most original and rivetting scenes in movie history with the predator at one stage grabbing Dutch by the throat and lifting him to his eyelevel(the Pedator is after all seven and a half feet tall).The movie ends as would a disaster movie with the survivors traumtised and wounded being picked up by helicopter and brought back to civilization.<BR> <BR>The \\"special edition\\"DVD has many special features and it incorporates an hour long special on \\"predator\\"which in fact seems to be made recently although at the same time contains footage from the actual movie shoot,along with out takes and deleted scenes and special effects footage which contain the not widely known \\"red predator\\".<BR> ...
B00003CX8I|4.0|This film is based upon the comic book series developed by Marvel Comics.  Loaded with excellent actors Hugh Jackman (Wolverine), Ian McKellen (Magneto), Halle Barry (Storm), Rebecca Romajn-Stamos (Mystic), James Marsden (Cyclops), Famke Janssen (Dr. Grey)  and Patrick Stewart (Xavier), the film delivers eye-popping visual effects as well as non-stop thrills and action throughout.  Each mutant possesses thier own unique special power.  Wolverine has razor-sharp claws that extend and retract, Storm has the ability to control the weather, Cyclops has red laseres that shoot from his eyes, Dr. Grey has telekenitic powers, while Xavier can read people's minds.<br />Xavier has nurtured the mutants through the disguise of a \\"school for gifted children\\".  However, he concentrates his efforts on helping mutants use their unique powers to help better mankind.  Wolverine, who is found by Storm and Cyclops stranded in a snowstorm after an attack by Magneto's thugs, is taken to Xavier's school.  Here, he is helped by Dr. Grey and Xavier to harness his powers.  Rogue, a young girl who was travelling with Wolverine, is also brought along.  She too possesses mutant powers.  She has the ability to absorb other mutants' powers into herself.  Magneto finds out about Rogue and devises a plan to capture her and have her absorb his powers and use them for evil.<BR>She tries to flee by leaving on a train, but Wolverine follows her and catches up with her on the train.  However, Magneto is there as well and manages to capture Rogue.  <br />The climactic battle between the X-men and Magneto takes place in the Statue of Liberty during a United Nations metting in New York City.  Magneto plans to channel his power to Rogue so she can in turn steal all of the power from the U.N. delegates.<br />The visual effects in this film are first rate and the acting is excellent.  If you are a comic book fan, or if you just like action/adventure films, then X-Men is a movie for you.
0780627024|5.0|I caught this movie quite by chance on one of the satellite superstations. I was intrigued by the gradual change from black and white to color. While watching what I was thinking of as a &quot;cute&quot; movie, the realization hit me square in the face that I was watching white America in the 1950's realize that there were &quot;those kind of people&quot; moving into their neighborhoods. What brought it home was the cardboard sign &quot;no coloreds;&quot; the line from the soda jerk that maybe if they cleaned up the mess (after a crowd trashing) that &quot;everything will be alright;&quot; and the Town Hall meeting with the &quot;whites&quot; downstairs on the main floor and the &quot;coloreds&quot; in the gallery above.<br />Extremely powerful messages in a deceptively &quot;cute&quot; movie. Highly recommeded.
B000000T01|5.0|Flat out the best rock documentary ever! Great from start to finish. Killer LIVE version of Won't Get Fooled Again closes the show with Long Live Rock playing during the closing credits. Dialog between Moon and Starr is priceless. What a great party tape, I purchased my copy in Kemmerer, Wyoming in 1982 and since then I've seen it over 60 times.
630179513X|5.0|After I watched &quot;Back to the future Trilogy&quot;, the one I enjoy the most is Part III. This movie has everything, friendship, romance, homour, action and wonderful Western scences. The Western scences make this movie look epic, the friendship between Marty and Doc is keep growing and the bond between them is so strong. The action is the best of the trilogy, just look at the duel of Marty and his nemesis and the train part. The romance for Doc and a school teacher is charm of this movie. Finally a perfect ending for this classic trilogy. The main character, Marty, also 'grown up' from last two movie, I say grown up that is because he can control his attitude when somebody called him chicken or coward even he knows he doesn't have to fight to. Hence he changes his future from nearly a car accident from Part II. Although this movie is less homour than last two, but it should be the way it is. That's why I think Part III is the best.
0783226837|5.0|You're stuck in the desert, being chased by massive, burrowing, carnivorous worms. You're five hundred feet from a boulder, with a worm right on your heels. You're not even sure the boulder will offer protection, but it's the only option you have.<br />Sounds like a freaky nightmare, doesn't it?<br />&quot;Tremors&quot; is a witty, logical monster movie - not once did I find myself yelling at the characters for being completely stupid. Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward are terrific as salt-of-the-Earth handymen, who find themselves in the<BR>situation described above. The film even has the integrity to cast a non-bimbo in the female lead.<br />The special effects are remarkably convincing - some of the best creature FX I've seen. Of course, the squeamish may want to steer clear; there's an awful lot of goopy worm innards.<br />The real highlight, though, is the screenplay. The plot is tension-filled and well-structured, and quite believable (which is strange, considering the subject matter).<br />With a nice array of bonus features, &quot;Tremors&quot; is a must-have DVD for monster-movie fans.<br />It also makes a great gift!
B00005YW4H|5.0|If you are lucky enough to come across Norah on the radio, and agree that she is a nice break from bubble-gum-sexed-out girls we hear so much of, then this album will not disappoint you.  I love Norah's mature, sultry, easy ranged voice, and on the first day I listened to the album it was raining outside and kind of a slow day- with this album playing the whole affect was quite relaxing. I was hooked.<br />The one and only fault may be that the songs all have a similair feel and some sound much alike.  With a little more listening you will  get the indivdual sound of each song a bit more.  I actually love the sound of her single so much, I liked that she stays true to her quality and sound, and this fact didn't bother me a bit. I love this album, and I can recommend it without any doubts.  It's a new, slow and jazzy yet classic feel that you will listen to over and over again. If in question, listen to the sound bites and see- she is true to herself on this one.
6300184080|5.0|Without a doubt, one of my favorites!!!  Cher was absolutely awesome!  All of the actors were perfectly cast and the soundtrack was top notch!!!<BR>Definitely worth the time.  You'll want to watch this one again & again.

B00004Y6NT|4.0|While there are no songs on this album that stand out like Dire Straits classics like Tunnel of Love, The Man's too Strong or Telegraph road, it is solid throughout without a single bad song on it.  Not the best intro to the band, but a must for every fan.
0425107469|5.0|This book is one of Dean Koontz's top 3.  It keeps you going to the end.  You never tire of the story or the characters, including Einstein.  Guarantees a good read.
B00003CX5P|5.0|The Phantom Menace was ridiculed by critics and fans everywhere, from its dialogue, the story, and some of its characters. Personally I thought George Lucas did a fine job of introducing the main characters while still having a story to go along with it and still tie it to the original trilogy. This DVD is excellent in that it is a two disc set with the movie seperating it from the extras which is what DVDs currently do. The extra scenes in the movie are magnificent in the quality that they were done. The usual theatrical trailers and the behind the scenes movies were good. Very excellent job done by the LucasFilm team. I highly recommend this to everyone!
B00003CXE7|5.0|Gladiator is an amazing film on many levels:  it is a broad, expansive, epic movie that has not been attempted in many years in Hollywood...that has an amazing center in the character of Maximus (Russell Crowe), who falls victim to the ambition of the illegitimate Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix).  On the other hand, it can be very personal and intimate at times...witness the very first scene, where we see Maximus daydream of being home, running his hand through his farmland.  Or the various scenes where we see him wrestle with his desire to avenge the death of his wife and son while attempting to rid Rome of the vile Commodus.  This is a film that is absolutely riveting from beginning to end; it is impossible to overstate the impact that Hans Zimmer's score has on the action...and the heart-wrenching emotion from Lisa Gerrard's voice harkens back to Titanic.  If you haven't seen this...I suggest you do as soon as possible!
B00006690G|5.0|After his last album, \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\", which sold millions of copies, Eminem is back with \\"The Eminem Show\\". Eminem is totally the best rapper. All the songs in this album are great. When I first heard the first single, \\"Without Me\\", I knew this was going to be another great album. Believe me, there is no bad song in this album. I have many favorite songs from this album. The songs I like the most are, \\"Say Goodbye Hollywood\\", \\"Without Me\\", \\"Sing For The Moment\\", \\"Superman\\", \\"Hailie's Song\\", \\"Say What You Say\\", and \\"My Dad's Gone Crazy\\". In \\"Hailie's Song\\" Eminem talks of the days when he feels bad or sad. When he feels like the world is on his shoulders. He's says that when his daughter Hailie comes back to his mind all the sad feelings go away. This is a very cool song. Eminem actually sings in this song. \\"Superman\\" is a very cool and danceable song. \\"Cleanin Out My Closet\\" is the second single out of this album and the lyrics are very cool too. \\"My Dad's Gone Crazy\\" is a very fun song to listen to. When I first heard it, it became one of my favorites. Another cool thing about this album is that it includes the lyrics for every song.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie is a stunning mixture of effects, acting, and music.  The story is classic with a twist of reality.  I never like Nicole Kidman until I saw this movie.  I began watching it fully prepared to hate it but, by the end, I was floored with the passion the movie projects.  The beginning was fast paced, choppy montague of the present and memories/writing of the past that can disorientate you but, in the end it all flows into a passionate masterpiece that wrenches the heart.  If you want a powerful film that shows the true meaning of love, Moulin Rouge is for you.
0440416027|5.0|I thought the book was excellent i had never heard of it before and i thought it would be very boaring.  I found the story both extraordinary and moving.  Michael and his friend Mina are just two normal children until thay find a creature hidden beneath the cobwebs and rubble in Michael's garage.  They had no idea that he would change there lives forever.  The book gives atmosphere suspence and suprise and i would deffinetely recomend it to anyone who enjoys a good novel.
B00000K19E|5.0|That was the first words my husband (then boyfriend) asked me after we walked out of the theater.  This is an exciting story that [draws] you into a whole new world and way of thinking.  It's a great date movie because it has tons of action for the guys with a sideline of romance for the ladies.  The special features on the DVD are pretty cool to.  After you've seen the movie a few times (trust me, it's so fast paced, you'll notice something new each time), I recommend watching it in \\"Follow the White Rabbit\\" mode.  This allows you to see how they made the different effects (just press enter when you see the white rabbit pop up in the corner of the screen).  Enjoy and remember anything is possible.
B00005JKGV|5.0|I recently saw Mulholland Drive and found it to be a bit too contrived from Lost Highway. This film is Lynch's best since Blue Velvet. The cinematography alone is enough to keep you watching. But the sheer weirdness of the film, the disjointed plotting and great performances make it a doubly rich treat for the mind and senses. Once again, Lynch plays with themes such as innocence, good, evil, the corruption of innocence, transformation, paranoia, dreams and nightmares. Glimpses of secret worlds that hide just behind the mundane. <br />I'll leave the finer plot points to other reviewers. Here's what stands out. The film sticks with you for days. Like any good Lynch movie we find yourself asking \\"what did that scene mean?\\" for days after you've seen the movie. You walk away with one interpretation of the film by find yourself with a different one later, after you've though about it some more. You've felt compelled to tell other about this movie. You may have even gone on the Internet to get other people's opinion of what the film is supposed to be about. You want to buy the soundtrack. Lost Highway had the best soundtrack of any of the Lynch movies. Mulholland drive didn't live up to the standard set here. Robert Blake was sincerely scary - more so than the Cowboy of Mulholland Drive - although I found him interesting too.  Noir! Nobody does is better today than Lynch! Surreal Film Noir! Lynch practically invented it!

B00004RFFS|5.0|Of all movies, novels, and lore surrounding Vampires, Anne Rice explores sides of culture that one would think unimaginable in early times. Her unrestricted work examines homosexuality, the pain of immortality, and the elegance of vampires in a way that breaks any traditional boundaries a vampire story ever had.<br />Interview with a Vampire is a clever, elegant, and deeply engaging story of myth versus realism (though, it has not been proven that vampires exist, however if they did, Anne Rice portrays them on the human scale.) The movie wavers from the book, that is to be expected, but not in the ways that doomed \\"Queen of the Damned.\\" I believe there was one review I read where the person was disappointed that there weren't stakes, garlic, and all the other things that associate us with Vampyric Legend. Well, for that, those came out of Dracula and if that's what your seeking, that is the movie you need to buy.<br />This movie is more of an erotic tale set in the most beautiful of areas with, of course, some of the vampire lore. It centers on Louis (Brad Pitt), a wealthy man who having lost his wife and child seeks death as an answer. Hence, he becomes the victim and love of the Vampire Lestat (Tom Cruise) who gives him the choice between death and eternal life. Louis rejects his fate afterward and doesn't share the passion of Lestat, the homosexual passion which is never really brought forward in the movie. Louis' love is Claudia, a young girl prey that he thought he killed, but Lestat turned to a vampire. The movie follows Louis over a few centuries and culminates in a spellbinding ending with the Vampire Armand (Antonio Banderos) and the return of a vampire that was thought to have been dead.<br />The interview is Louis' recollection of events to a reporter (Christian Slater,) which in turn creates the entire story. There is more involved in this movie than ever could be written in a review, but it is one of those movies that keeps you locked in and headed to the bookstore. Sadly, the movie wasn't followed by \\"The Vampire Lestat,\\" instead the powers that be opted for \\"Queen of the Damned.\\" Cruise, Pitt, Banderas, and Slater are nowhere to be seen in the newest movie. Perhaps that's why there are masterpieces and then there are capitalists on that masterpiece without a shred of literary decency beyond the profit game.<br />Robert Eldridge (...)the bookstore.

0743455967|5.0|Having never read a Stephen King book reading this one may seem an odd choice but some of my favorite movies were first King stories and his ability to tell a good story can hardly be questioned.  In the last couple months I've gone through several books on writing as I recently decided to try practicing the craft.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading \\"The First Five Pages\\" by Lukeman and \\"How to write a Damn Good Novel\\" by Frey because it seemed that the authors weren't just explaining things like a teacher would, instead they sounded as if they were talking to a friend.<br />King does that and more in this; I felt as if he was talking to me and that we were old friends.<br />It takes a lot of skill to be able to enchant a reader,  King has that quality in the fiction genre, and for any wondering if it that quality carried over to this work of nonfiction I respond with a loud yes.<br />I recall my favorite childhood reading and the juvenile series \\"Alfred Hitchcock's The Three Investigators\\" comes to mind.  As I grew a little older I read \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" several times and also got hooked on Robert Heinlein.  I bring this up to mention that King talks about some of his early reading and how it effected him and his writing.  I would suspect that few if any good writers didn't fall in love with fiction at an early age.  He also mentions the importance of and how much he currently reads including a long list of books that he had read in the three or four previous years in an attempt to answer the question; \\"And what do you read?\\".  Other than extreme jealously, I was also feeling a bit guilty about not reading as much as I should.  I'd kill the tv if I could, he refers to it as the \\"glass teat\\" and I concur.  I'd get rid of it but I'd have to throw the wife out too...<br />There is a lot of gold here and I give it a strong recommendation.
B00001R3GI|4.0|I recently wrote a review of this item based on the fact that I logically thought I did not receive the remastered version.  However, it was corrected and it turns out I did indeed receive the remastered version.  The store had just gotten the item right before I purchased it and immediately sold it to me so they did not list it at their site.

B000066F6H|2.0|people have latched on to this hives album as if it signifies something \\"new\\" about punk rock. garbage: they're just ripping off bands like Turbonegro and the Hellacopters who have had a massive underground punk following. since they're from sweden, chances are they've been to a number of Hellacopters concerts, and have probably caught Norway's Turbonegro touring. i can't stand bands who are built up as the next \\"new thing\\", but everything they write is just a rip off of great rockandroll pioneers.<BR>  the main reviewer said they were loud and raw, or something to that affect. listen to Guitar Wolf, Turbonegro, the Hellacopters, Electric Frankenstein, and the Nation of Ulysses instead. then you'll see what \\"loud\\" and \\"raw\\" truly are.
1563523302|4.0|I found this book fascinating. It is not a how-to-be-rich book. As the title implies, it is the combined conclusions from a number of statistical studies and focus-group interviews by authors Stanley and Danko, the purpose of which was to find out more about the spending and saving habits of the rich. For their purposes they defined \\"rich\\" as more than $1 million in net worth. The results I found pretty eye-opening. Of particular interest for me was the authors' comparison between 2 groups: the true millionaires (according to their definition) and those who fit the more popular image of millionaires - high spenders who had less than $1 million in net worth. The study includes lists and tables of occupations of millionaires, categories of businesses they own, and so on. Yes, most millionaires are owners of businesses (cf Kiyosaki's \\"Cashflow Quadrant\\"). Another section of great interest is that on the children of millionaires vs those of high-spenders. There is much implied in the book (the frugality, discipline and low-profile lifestyle of millionaires are treated with obvious sympathy and respect), but the authors did very well to stick to their brief and avoid preaching, or even advice (althought there is an excellent concluding section, in true academic style, on how one might exploit the statistical information). Finally, as a non-American, I found the wealth of analysis on cars hilarious! The table on cars' cost per pound is highly thought-provoking, though. Very well written with humour and a complete lack of pretentiousness or \\"academese\\". All in all, the results of their excellent research speak for themselves.
B00005ASOI|3.0|This one is more creepy than scary.  It's about witchcraft and the occult.  I was expecting something more scary, but this is still pretty good.
B00001PE4D|5.0|What more can be said about this movie? The sound track is great, Sarah and Ryan, Reese and Selma all fit into the film perfectly. The rather twisted story about a step brother and sister's sexual deviations just adds more flavor to an otherwise excellent movie. Ryan and Sarah interact pretty well. And who can forget Selma Blair and Sarah Michelle Gellar's smooching in Central Park. (Which won an award for best kiss of 1999)<br />If you're into twisted, modern young and filthy rich movies (The In crowd is good too) this is one to get. If you are a Sarah Michelle Gellar fan you get to see some of her best acting ever in this film (as well as her real hair color.)
B00006IUL7|4.0|This movie will make you want to stay up to see the finish as Robin Williams plays a different and unique role!  Pacino is brought in to hunt to an elusive killer (Williams) who local authorities can't pin.  The action is suspenseful and Pacino is excellent again!  Pacino is joined by a less-than veteran staff of local police trying to hunt down a killer. I enjoyed Robin Williams' role as he tries to work a potential black-mail deal with Pacino as he is suspect in his own partner's questionable death.  Pacino is plagued by Internal Affair problems from Los Angeles and Williams wants to exploit this in order to be left alone from Pacino's persistence.<br />This is a great suspenseful movie that I found quite enjoyable as it was great to see Robin Williams in such a different role for a change!  Does Williams get caught in the end?  Does Pacino avoid the trouble from his partner's death?  Buy this DVD and find out!
B000001DWG|4.0|The sludge guitar is weak, and that raw, turned out emotion is twinged with a kind of sadness, but these guys know how to jam it hard.  Boy, believe in the slamming pounding rythems and the unbelievable warnings of the lyrics from the heart.  tHE THIRD SONG, ESECIALLY, GETS ME PUMPED!  I need to feel the rock.  NOT TO PLAY FOR WIFE!  It's raunchy ad sossy, but appropriate for teens and non-drunks.  Beefy!
B00006FXB6|5.0|This album is great. If you don't already own it, buy it. The first song &quot;Millionare&quot; completely destroys anything you have heard on the radio in your life. &quot;No One Knows&quot; is amazingly catchy with a great guitar riff. Tracks like &quot;Hanging Tree&quot; that feature Mark singing have a spacy feel to them. His voice is dark and wonderfully in place with The Queens. This is the best album I have ever bought and the best I will buy for a long time.
1563896656|4.0|What happens when one of comicdom's greatest writers creates a story in an alternative Victorian-era England, with famous literary characters as super-heroes?  Alan Moore's \\"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,\\" part homage to 19th-Century literature, part unconventional superhero story, and an introduction to a new, periodical series from Moore and artist Kevin O'Neil.  In less-capable hands, such a project would be doomed to failure from the start, but Moore's writing and O'Neil's Manga-influenced comic art make \\"League\\" a triumphant piece of literature.<br />In the soot-choked London of \\"League,\\" where giant cranes construct gothic bridges and dirigibles are as commonplace as hansom cabs, Mina Murray, former wife of Jonathan Harker and object of Dracula's affection, is recruited by a Mr. Bond for an unusual mission.  Mr. Bond's supervisor, \\"M\\", wants Murray to team up with Captain Nemo and his Nautilus submarine to track down Allan Quatermain in Egypt.  Once they force his opium addiction into remission, the team recruits Mr. Edward Hyde, and his meek alter-ego Dr. Jeckyll, and a Mr. Griffin, better known as The Invisible Man, who is creating a series of \\"miraculous\\" pregnancies at a school for delinquent girls.<br />Once the team unites, \\"M\\" gives them their first mission: to investigate a Chinese gang ruled by a criminal mastermind, who has stolen a device that allows massive ships to fly.  There is concern that the gang leader will create a giant airship that will allow him to bomb and destroy any part of London he desires - which would be disastrous for the Crown.  While investigating, the League discovers that things aren't quite as they appear, which leads to a final showdown with a famous literary villain.<br />Moore's writing and O'Neil's art save what could have been a trite story and make it not only passable, but enjoyable and fun.  It lacks the literary and philosophical depth of Moore's other works, like \\"Watchmen\\" or \\"From Hell,\\" but \\"League\\" isn't really designed to offer some genre-shattering thesis.  It's just good fun, especially for those who have read some late 19th-Century literature.  Don't overanalyze it, enjoy it, and you can't go wrong with \\"League.\\"<br />Final Grade: Bn't really designed to offer some genre-shattering thesis.  It's just good fun, especially for those who have read some late 19th-Century literature.  Don't overanalyze it, enjoy it, and you can't go wrong with \\"League.\\"<br />Final Grade: B
B00006FR47|4.0|This album was suprisingly good.  This album is unique because it is was their first single LP.  It packs in a lot of music and despite the fact that it was only one disc, it still holds true to their earlier sounds.  Despite what some reviewers may write, this album does sound BETTER in the remastered version.  The old one is very quiet compared to the new one and it has little to no punch.  Stick with the remastered version, it is well worth the money.
0380977788|2.0|Clearly Gaiman has a following, but I've never been able to fathom why. Perhaps it's the cult cachet sustained from his Sandman series, and the way he consistently appeals to the narrow reading experience of contemporary goth cyberculture and the like. So, being a fan of darkly twisted children's books that appeal equally to adults (Philip Pullman, Lewis Carroll, Roald Dahl, etc), and having succumbed  to the unusually hyperbolic back-cover blurbs of this work (c'mon, a ranking above Alice in Wonderland?), I plodded my way through this short novel to its ultimately prosaic conclusion. The image of black-button eyes is novel and resonates, but the rest is tired and contrived, with thin characters whose motivations and actions aren't properly established and don't always ring true (e.g., Coraline venturing through the trap door to the basement, knowing that it's a trap). I've never found Gaiman's writing particularly impressive, and this is no exception. The illustrations, on the other hand, are worthwhile.
B00006FXB6|5.0|Simply put, its their best album, in my opinion.  Its got the groove and the crunch that we expect from QUOTSA, but the songs are more coherent, even with their odd structures.<br />I was pleasantly thrilled with the purchase.  Its the best new rock album I've heard in a long time.
B000002BQK|5.0|Every song on this album is enjoyable.  The ultimate R&amp;B jams/ballads cd.  The Roof, Breakdown, Outside, Butterfly, Butterfly Reprise are my favorites....<br />The whole thing is awsome.  There is not one disappointing song or any filler songs on the cd!  I would highly recommend it!  <br />If you really want some stellar dance music, check out the singles for the album... My All has 2 different singles that are each great, and the rest are all good as well.  This album and its singles WON'T disappoint!
0385501560|5.0|I read it once, fast, then again right away, slow. I haven't read Chuck Palahniuk's latest book, Lullaby, yet (I hear it is extremely good); but Choke is my favorite of his first three, all of which I loved.<br />Choke is so uninhibited it's freeing to read it. It's extremely funny (black humor), the story of a sex addict who \\"supports himself\\", and gets love, by tricking people into saving his life. <br />The protagonist is a nut case, and relentlessly honest throughout. <br />Lots of entertaining sex scenes, too.
B00005OAIE|5.0|The CD surprised me and surpassed all of my expectations. It will make you laugh, cry and dance. It's jazzy and folksy. Each song tells a story that I could relate to. <br />I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE &quot;No Such Thing&quot;--I see why it's a hit. The cut, &quot;Why Georgia&quot; brings tears every time I hear it. &quot;My Stupid Mouth&quot; is fun. &quot;Wonderland&quot; makes you want to snuggle with somebody. &quot;83&quot; is another smash--makes you remember the good ole days. And &quot;Love Song for No One&quot;--I feel you, John.<br />I usually by jazz. But John's voice, the instrumentation the whole thing is awesome. And he's soooo CUTE! John, marry me!

0316666343|1.0|I was so disappointed in this book, after all the publicity!  I love crime stories, but this one falls into some other category entirely. There's nothing compelling about this story, and the unusual plot device of having the dead girl narrate it wears thin early on. I gave up and never finished it.
0316666343|5.0|From the eyes of a child murdered - it is both saddening and at the same time inspiring. The story of a girl watching what happens on earth after she is murdered, it was hard to put down. With 3 kids I still HAD to finish it and did in 4 days. It is that hard to stop reading. I recomend it to anyone who has a heart but also likes the suspense of mystery also.
0694003611|5.0|Notwithstanding the story is very simple, this book deserves its reputation as a classic for toddlers. My daughter loves it and despite a wide range of other options after more than year she still takes it. The beautiful pictures and the every day life objects in it are comforting. If you don't have it, buy it. Now! A last advice: take the larger boardbook, it's impressing.
0316666343|4.0|This is the best book I've read in long time.  I could not put it down. I loved Sebold's writing. Please read this book.
B00003CXXP|1.0|Oh boy, what a boring movie!  I resisted for the first 2 hours to press the fast forward but after that I could not take it anymore.  The first half hour is not bad but after the imprint everything falls apart, the worst, falls apart v-e-r-y  s-l-o-w-l-y...  I am filing this movie in the &quot;Worst I've ever seen&quot; category.  And I've seen a lot!  Do a favour to yourself and stay away from it.  The best scene in AI is when the &quot;homeless&quot; robots dig the dumpster and get the best parts of other robots to build themselves.  Oh yeah, that's pretty much what this movie is about.  It takes the best part of other movies (Blade Runner, Mad Max, even Planet of the Apes) to make itself.  And the result looks as bad as the homeless robots...
0316666343|5.0|I could not decide if I wanted to read this book when I first heard about it because of the subject matter. I thought surely the death of a young girl was too depressing, but after hearing so many raves about it, I succumbed and picked it up. <br />I am so glad I did. Narrated from heaven by Susie Salmon, a teen who was killed on her way home from school, this book casts an interesting and comforting perspective on what might happen to loved ones when they die. <br />Although you know immediately who the murderer is, it is riveting to watch as family, friends and authority try to piece together who could have committed the crime. At the same time, the reader is drawn into the difficult journey of a family piecing together their lives while dealing with the tragedy of such a loss. <br />This book has so many facets to it, and it pulls so many emotional chords. You will laugh and cry as Susie finds her place in heaven and accepts her departure from earth. This is a unique, touching story, one that will stay with its readers for a long time.
B00003CXXP|1.0|Oh boy, what a boring movie!  I resisted for the first 2 hours to press the fast forward but after that I could not take it anymore.  The first half hour is not bad but after the imprint everything falls apart, the worst, falls apart v-e-r-y  s-l-o-w-l-y...  I am filing this movie in the &quot;Worst I've ever seen&quot; category.  And I've seen a lot!  Do a favour to yourself and stay away from it.  The best scene in AI is when the &quot;homeless&quot; robots dig the dumpster and get the best parts of other robots to build themselves.  Oh yeah, that's pretty much what this movie is about.  It takes the best part of other movies (Blade Runner, Mad Max, even Planet of the Apes) to make itself.  And the result looks as bad as the homeless robots...
0446310786|5.0|Absolutely fantastic. If you liked A Tree Grows In Brooklyn, you'll love this.
B00003W8NM|5.0|I've read some of the reviews on this page and am disturbed by everyone expostulating on the &quot;true&quot; meaning of the movie.  I agree that there is a powerful message, actually there are several.  But I also think that it is for the viewer to decide what to take from the film, not people doling out reviews.  I will break from the norm and avoid touching on what I thought the film meant.  I will say that the dialogue in this movie is fantastic, sometimes funny, sometimes scary.  The fight scenes are ultrarealistic.  The supplemental disk has some really cool features, notably the PSAs and deleted scenes.  The commentaries, from many different individuals, are good.  If you can't handle graphic hand-to-hand violence, don't buy this movie.  If you like memorable characters, smart, funny writing, plot twists, and on-screen violence, buy it now.
B00001U0DP|5.0|Originally, I started watching the film because I was in bed,  had a headache, and was feeling too sluggish to change the channel.  So many times, I was tempted to change the channel or switch the television off because the subtitles were making my headache worse, and the movie moved rather slowly at the very beginning.  But as I saw more and more, I just had to see the rest of the film.  The headache and fatigue flew out the window, and was replaced by hysterical laughter and crying.  Such is the magic of this movie, that one can feel a mass of conflicting emotions all at the same time.  I won't bother with the synopsis of the film here, as this has been dealt with by other reviewers.  But please, for your own sake, DON'T be turned off by the subtitles or the rather slow start.  It DOES get better.  In this case, patience is a humongous virtue...
B00006690G|5.0|This album rocks! i wasn't a big fan of Eminem but one night i put on this album and loved it.  His lyrics are controversial but if you can be open minded and get past that you will appreciate what he is trying to say and see that he has a good way with words and expressing himself. Eminem truly has a unique style. Tracks 8-10 are my fav's but the whole album is amazing.  I've got a lot of my friends onto this one, Enjoy!!
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay does it again! Another superb alternative rock album fr0m the brit-wonders.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril isn't a punk rocker chick! And if she lost the stupid image people might just like her album.  The album has a rock sound to it but it's as pop as it gets.  At first listen it [was bad] but now it's really grown on me. The music was written really well and sounds good.  Avril's lyrics are simple but effective.  This is a good album but Avril's been made out to be some kind of a 17 year old super human, which makes people very critical when listening to her songs.  Her album covers many subjects so it's easy to relate to.  If you like rock you wouldn't like this but if you like pop, rock and top 40 you would. It's better than michelle branch, vanessa carlton etc.  Avril's songs are catchy and lyrically better. You can put this CD on anytime and enjoy it. Personally i like it and listen to it everyday! it's a refreshing change to hear something of this style.
B000069HKH|4.0|I like this cd very much, HOWEVER, one song disappointed me immensely-the title song, \\"The Rising.\\"  Although the song itself is one of Bruce's best, the song's production was poor.  There should be a longer intro into the song from the strings, starting off faintly then building up, THEN have the vocals come in.  It is such a poignant, spirit filled song, it deserves to be 3 to 4 minutes longer-Springstein should have made much more of it.  Also, the sound quality of the track is off.  The other songs sound great, so I wonder why \\"The Rising\\" has a \\"garage\\" sound to it.  Maybe The Boss plans a future release that brings the song to a higher level.  Let's hope so!
B00005QK3W|5.0|It's not surprising that on his first album of all original material since wife Linda's death, Paul is exploring the darker side of the spectrum. \\"She's Given Up Talking\\", \\"Lonely Road\\"- many of these tunes would get airplay on alternative radio if someone else had penned them. But it's not all dark. \\"Tiny Bubble\\", \\"Your Way\\", and the title track are trademark McCartney pop masterpieces. This is the freshest album in Paul's output since 1989's \\"Flowers in the Dirt\\". All of the session musicians on the record are a good deal younger than Paul, and they give it a noticeable edge as well. A great album for Paul fans of all ages!
B000000I0G|4.0|First, for the most-detailed review of this CD, see the earlier one by a reviewer named Adrian, who pretty much nails the concept, themes, and motifs.<br />That said, I would add that I've thoroughly enjoyed Five Miles Out because Mr. Oldfield has brought some talented folks into the studio to augment his own talents. As a result, the sound is richer and fuller than his one-man-band efforts from the earlier stages of his career.<br />Maggie Reilly, who has graced many recording by Mike Oldfield as well as Jack Bruce, really shines with her soaring vocals. The trio of Morris Pert, Tim Cross, and Rick Fenn---who anchor Oldfield's recordings throughout the '80s---create a solid, seamless backdrop that keeps Mr. Oldfield tethered to the music.<br />Two long tracks, Taurus II and Orabidoo, consume most of the CD, but the title track Five Miles Out, a haunting tale of a doomed aviator, and the radio friendly Family Man, may be the two that embed themselves deepest into your auditory memory tracks.<br />If you have not really listened to Mike Oldfield's vast body of work, or perhaps too quickly banished him on the basis of his earlier efforts, than either this CD or Crisis are recommended access points.
B00004YRQA|1.0|I'm not a xbox lover or anything, but have to say I'm getting more and more frustrated/annoyed with these memory cards on the gamecube and PS2. I keep running out of space on my PS2 cards, and it ALWAYS happens while I'm playing a game and REALLY want to save - but there's no way to clear up room one one of my cards since I'd have to restart the console to do it!!!...
B000021YQV|5.0|I first heard System of a Down when the song Sugar off their first CD came out.  I was immediately hooked to the song, and purchased the CD.  I then heard the song Spiders, which completely blew my mind.  Being that this is a review for Toxicity and not their first album, I will just say that the first album was very unique and pretty good.  However, Toxicity is a modern-day rock masterpiece.<br />When Chop Suey was first released as a single a month or so before the album's release, I heard it play on the radio and couldn't get it out of my head.  It was the catchiest song I had heard in recent years, and the juxtaposition of sound was incredible.  The way they could be so harsh and then transition to melodic and harmonic was outstanding.  I knew that the day the album came out, I would purchase it, listen to it, and love it.<br />When I listened to the album the first time through, I was a bit taken back by the way it sounded.  Chop Suey sounded very different than the rest of the CD, but in a good way.  That is because each song has its own flavor, uniqueness, and originality.  The second and third times I listened to the album, I completely loved almost every song on the CD.  <br />1. Prison Song - 10/10 Hard, with a message that has been conveyed before, but is done even better here.  <BR>2. Needles - 10/10 You may think its another song dealing with drugs, but it is more than that.  It uses a completely new metaphor that adds a new shade to the subject.  Features a nice solo.<BR>3. Deer Dance - 10/10  One of my favorites, sounds different all throughout, starting with the hard intro, then the mellow verse, the funky chorus and solo, and then the second chorus which is all out heavy.  Sweet solo.<BR>4. Jet Pilot - 7/10  This song is a bit too loud to listen to on a regular basis, and I often skip it when I listen to the album because of its loudness.  But it still manages to be a very good song.<BR>5. X - 7/10  Again a song I usually skip, but I do still enjoyit.<br />6. Chop Suey! - 10/10 The song that started it all, turns out to not even be the best song, but is one of them.  The trippy, melodic chorus mixed with the crazy verse.<BR>7. Bounce - 7/10  Interesting sound, but the loud factor, OUCH.<BR>8. Forest - 10/10  <BR>9. Atwa<BR>10. Science<BR>11. Shimmy<BR>12. Toxicity<BR>13. Psycho<BR>14. Aerials
B000066C6Z|5.0|I thought this was a great movie.  There are so many funny scenes you can't possibly get them all the first time that you watch it.  I watch it everytime I need a real good laugh.
0743455967|4.0|To the casual reader, it would appear as if Stephen King had produced the lazy, indulgent book about his experiences as a writer that one would eventually expect from an author of his celebrity. However, the more alert purveyor of ON WRITING will realize that Mr. King is, not very arguably, the most celebrated and commercially successful author of the last 30 years, one who certainly knows the value of backstory, foreshadowing, characterization and plot, and that, if he's giving way to indulgences, there's an ulterior motive that eventually pays in practical dividends. <br /><BR>This book starts off with King's earliest memories, which begin when his and his brother Dave's father had just abandoned the family and his mother had to struggle through one move and menial job after another to support her two troublesome boys. Reading of King's misfortunes with cribbing a Poe story and passing it off as his own (the fact that Poe's work was obviously already in the public domain notwithstanding and irrelevant), writing for a homemade newspaper masterminded by his restless brother Dave and creating a satirical version of the high school paper makes one marvel at how writers of all levels of success have common experiences. While in junior high, I had excoriated the student body and faculty alike with a multi-page document that almost gotten me mauled by a frighteningly large gym teacher who was one of the subjects of my alleged wit but who was not frightening enough to quench my instinct for satire (King assures us that he was cured of the Petronius Arbiter Bug). Anyone who's ever wanted to hack into their job's mainframe and sabotage the company's online newsletter will understand exactly where King is coming from. When admitting that people tell every creative being, including himself, that they're wasting their talent, King is immediately sharing a bond among the community of not just writers but all artists in general. On the flip side, King is also careful to tell usof the pearls of practical and seminal wisdom that he had likewise learned from his elders, including his supportive, if sometimes bewildered, mother.<br /><BR>The book continues with Uncle Fazza's handmade toolbox, which King uses as a metaphor or synecdoche for the tools of the writer. King advises, as did his uncle who'd dragged the heavy wooden toolbox outside only to use a screwdriver to fix a screen, that it's a good habit to get into because you never know when you'll need other tools. His other advice, such as attacking the white page aggressively and with feeling, even desperation, is not as innovative as the reader would hope but there are countless other nuggets of wisdom for which workshop students would pay hundreds of dollars with perhaps half the wisdom. King even gives the reader and aspiring writer an intriguing writing exercise and invites them to tell him the results on [...] In this section, King also gives us an indication of how he can turn a mildly interesting headline into an interesting storyline into then a great storyline with a simple twist of perception or a reversal of the facts.<br /><BR>At the end of the book, King lets us look over his shoulder while he's in his \\"closed door\\", or first draft, phase. First, he presents a rough draft of a short story followed by a holograph of the revised copy, handwritten interlineations and all, giving us a keyhole glimpse into the workings of his creative mind, something for which most other authors have too much hubris. King, however, gives the reader the impression that his self-deprecation and lack of artistic seriousness and high mindedness is sincere and he lets us see him first thing in the morning, unshaven, hair mussed, still wearing his droopy socks and wrinkled underwear. <br /><BR>ON WRITING is not to be mistaken for an autobiography or as a textbook on the craft of writing. It is both and neither. King did a masterful job in inextricably entwining and perfectly balancing the relationshipbetween life and writing that makes this book, in some ways moreso than his earlier DANSE MACABRE, an invaluable document for both the novice and seasoned pro alike. It is a short, inspiring and humorous literary autobiography that generously allows us to see what the NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW and King's publicity agent does not, the failings, foulups, and foibles of who is perhaps the most lionized author of modern times. <br />
B000062TU1|4.0|<BR>I must admit, being 15 years old, I thought Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone would be rather boring and stupid.  I had never even read a book, nor had a desire to.  Yet, one day in school, we either had the choice of doing work, or watching this movie.  You can guess what I chose, correct? <BR><BR>::Enter the World Of Harry Potter::  <BR><BR>When I watch this DVD, which is now on a weekly basis, I always prefer to skip past the first 6 scenes, as they are sort of boring and dull.  But once the Hogwart's adventure begins in the movie, I enjoyed watching it!  Funny, delightful, cute, and charming all come to mind.  The movie's scenery are wonderfully thought out, and the dialog and characters are very realistic.  Aside from the ghosts, sorting hat, and all other magickal workings at Hogwarts, the school itself is very much like an old fashioned English boarding school.  <BR><BR>The movie's many aspects, also keeps one thouroughly entertained in the movie.  The main theme runs through the entire film, that of finding the Stone and the person trying to keep it, yet new little twists are constantly added, to make the adventure that much more exciting.  The Troll at Halloween, A game of Quidditch, A Dragon hatchling, and a trip to the Dark Forest, among other things.  Overall, I believe this movie is quite nice, and, although it is no Wizard of Oz, it is a wonderful family movie, for those who like these types of imaginative movies.  Only 58 days till the sequel, and I must tell you, this 'Non Harry Potter Fan' cannot wait!  I hope this review is helpful to you, and enjoy your time at the movies!
6304057709|5.0|you will buy this movie right this instant! Wow! What a great movie! Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet, Hugh Grant (gotta love Hugh), Alan Rickman (gotta love Alan too)... they all contribute magnificently to this perfect telling of an intriguing and thoroughly heart-warming tale. Did I mention really funny too? Well it is... it is even laugh-out-loud funny at times.<br />Emma Thompson, and Kate Winslet play the Dashwood sisters-- the oldest (or should I say eldest?), Elinor (Emma Thompson), reserved, sensible, practical; the younger, Marianne (Kate Winslet), impetuous, spontaneous, passionate-- who along with their mother, and younger sister Margaret, are thrust into a less than favorable situation when their father dies. As a result of his death they are left to the mercy of their spineless half-brother, and his hateful, high-minded, selfish wife, who inherit their father's estate. Not for long though, as an offer is made to them which will allow them to part ways with their tormentors- the two thorns in their flesh. But not before Elinor takes interest in a certain visitor, Edward Ferrars (Hugh Grant), finding love in the most unexpected place, only to have it seemingly snatched from her grasp (things get quite complicated)! Marianne too, soon *stumbles* into love... the kind she has always dreamed of... but her relationship seems ill-fated as well. Will the two ever find love?<br />It's very interesting to see how both react to their feelings, and in the end, to see which pays off: being sensible, or being impetuous, or, being both in balance. Oh, but the story is far deeper than that. There is much in this movie to dazzle and delight even the most critical of tastes. It is certainly one that you will never grow tired of watching... simply a wonderful, wonderful film. Emma, Kate, Hugh, Alan, Ang Lee (the director), everyone in this movie, and behind the scenes, helped to make it a true classic! I guarantee you will not regret buying it! Be sensible, and do so! :-D
0425107469|5.0|&quot;Watchers&quot; by Dean Koontz is not only the best book Dean Koontz ever wrote, but it is the best book I ever read.  You just fall in love with the characters and you can't put it down.  After I read this book, I didn't want to read another because I knew whatever book I read next wouldn't compare.  Excellent book.
0385335482|3.0|The book started off slow and by the time it got interesting...it ended really quickly. I am a shopaholic myself and to be honest the way that Rebecca squandered her money was almost unbearable to even myself. towards the end the character started to redeem herself and make up for the first 150 pages but ended soon enough to know that there had to be a sequel. overall the book was ok but at many times really dreadful.
0767812387|5.0|If you liked &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot;, you will LOVE this movie.  I bought it on VHS and I'm getting it on DVD to preserve it.  The cast is awesome, the story classic and it brings a smile just to remember it.  Buy it or rent it...just see it.

B00000FCBC|5.0|To those of us who enjoy Metallica's deep musicianship, insightful lyrical journeys and embrace the musical directions the band has explored recently, this album is a great look at a different side of the band. On the other hand, to the more closed minded of you who think that &quot;modern&quot; Metallica is nothing but a sellout mainstream band (despite being very rarely mentioned on MTV or VH1) and that their new music is no good... you will still enjoy this album. <br />Garage Inc. is a collection of cover songs. No original Metallica songs here. This album is basically a tribute album to their multitude of influences, from the Danish band Mercyful Fate, to Black Sabbath, to Motorhead, to Bob Seger and the Blue Oyster Cult. That said, the familiar songs will have your head banging all over again, and the more obscure songs will have you going to the used cd store looking for the original recordings. <br />The first disc are the new recordings. I won't go into too much detail here, others have already done so before me, but I will say that on most of these songs Metallica not only accurately captures the feel of the songs, but surpass the original recordings from the original bands in every way. Most notably here are Astronomy (originally recorded by the Blue Oyster Cult-one of my favorite songs by them. Hearing Metallica do the song makes the original Astronomy sound stupid in comparison) and Seger's Turn The Page, a radio-friendly classic rock song with much vocal depth and great musical craftsmanship. Also, we Skynyrd fans are treated to a live studio recording of &quot;Tuesday's Gone&quot; with many special guests, including Jerry Cantrell.<br />Disc two is a trip to the past for Metallica fans. Those of us longtime fans who already have Garage Days Revisited (and the hard-to-find &quot;re-revisited&quot; EP) will find both recordings intact on this disc. The quality of songs on here is second to none. All their Diamond Head covers are intact, and the Motorhead covers are simply amazing. And the incredibly funny and obscene &quot;Last Caress&quot; and &quot;Who Cares&quot; songs are a shocker to those who haven't seen a live metallica (83-92) show. <br />I recommend this disc to any Metallica fan who hasn't picked it up yet, and to those people who are becoming interested in Metallica. This diverse cd shows both sides of the band, even though the songs aren't their own original songs. A definite must-have for Metallica fans.
B00004DTLJ|5.0|Far and above their best album, and Steve Dawson's final one. Later albums don't have the same punch, although you've still got Biff belting out the tunes. This album simply rocks, with Devil Rides Out and Back On The Streets. Also shows their compasionate side with Broken Heroes, dedicated to the Vietnam Veterans. Saw these guys live in Oakland in late '85, and their live performance rivals that of anyone. This CD is a \\"must have\\" in your metal collection
B00006JI8V|5.0|You have no idea how awesome this album is. In the genre of melodic metal, these guys are up at the top, definitely. I never hit the skip button, not ONCE!! The song writing is great, vocals AMAZING, and the drumming and guitar/keys sweeping combo is right on. It's very full of energy. Get this if you like Nightwish, Rhapsody, Stratovarius, Dream Theater, and the like. You will not be disappointed. (And can you believe these guys are only in their 20s???)
0316666343|5.0|I thouroughly enjoyed this book. From Beginning to end I was captivated by the imagination in  Suzie's Heaven. I truley want to believe that heaven will be what each of us percieves it to be   ....whatever we want it to be. <BR>This novel is a good soul kind of story ....i think those suffering from grief will benefit from the insight of the here after. Very moving.
0736041850|5.0|I can honestly say that I have never seen clearer anatomical drawings in my life. Combine this with the way the muscles and bones are presented (in the context of a lift) and this book should be on every fitness enthusiasts bookshelf.<br />As if that weren't enough - the book gives detailed advice on perfoming many lifts. I am one who thinks that visualizing the working muscles is important in lifting. This book is a big help in this regard.<br />Considering the price of this book is less than a single anatomical chart - it is quite a value.

0446678430|5.0|This book is in many ways a summation of his earlier books but I liked it better than the others. This is not a &quot;how to&quot; book in the traditional sense it is a motivational book on how to &quot;be&quot;. I read Rich Dad in 1999 and since then these books have motivated me to change my life. I have gone from a low six figure income (1999) to almost a seven figure income in three years and much of it I attribute to the thought process I have learned through these books. <br />The book is easy to read but virtually impossible for most to grasp the concepts presented. I have reccomended the books to many and often those I reccomend them to rarely finish reading them. The concepts presented are just to radical for most and down right scary to others. But hey,  the world needs E's and S's too....

B00000IMCW|5.0|The 5 stars is for the film itself which one of the greastest horror films of all time. However, I like many others was a \\"late bloomer\\" to DVD and thought that I missed my opportunity to get this fine film on DVD because it is out of print. I was almost ready to get the credit card out and order it anyway for over 60 dollars when I stumbled upon this information. Anchor Bay is releasing both Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead on DVD again next year. They are both slated to come out around the summer and the Dawn of the Dead version features 3 discs! So save your money if you are even thinking about purchasing this film.<br />**Update**<BR>The three disc set of Dawn of the Dead has now been put off until 2004, no doubt to correspond to the theatrical remake of Dawn of the Dead. However, Divimax did release the Day of the Dead set and the quality was far superior to any release of the film beforehand. Keep your money and buy the new edition when it comes out, it will be of much better quality than this edition. However, if you can find this edition cheap, its not bad if you aren't a fan of special features of which it has few.
B000068OCS|2.0|First, the good news: Koyaanisqatsi is finally available commercially in DVD format.<br />Next, the bad news: The film image has been CROPPED! \\"Enhanced\\", if you will, for widescreen TVs. The disc's case says, \\"16:9 WIDESCREEN 1.85:1 -- Theatrical release format.\\" Bull ! I've seen Koyaanisqatsi in the theater and was immediately struck by the fact it was being projected in the standard 4:3 (1.33:1) aspect ratio--not widescreen ! I'm no fan of pan-and-scan hatchet-jobs on widescreen films, but neither am I a fan of this equally reprehensible practice of cutting away significant portions of a film's top and bottom just so it will fit comfortably on somebody's new [expensive]16:9 50\\" plasma wall-set. Just as P&S deprives us of frequently vital side information, here we are deprived of the beauty of Ron Fricke's *full-screen* images. And, man, do things look cramped up there. Do I dare lay the blame on MGM, rather than on the Institute for Regional Education, which owns the film ? In any event, it's a pity, a real pity ! And a shame !<br />The other bad news is that the 5.1 soundtrack on this new disc is muffled, dull and lacking in definition and depth when compared to the privately-issued disc the IRE made available some time ago. Surround effects that were so obvious in the theater are nowhere to be heard here. I don't know if the IRE is still making their offer, now that this new MGM disc is in stores; but if you're a true Koyaanisqatsi devotee, and can ante up the money for a donation, my advice to you is to give it some *serious* consideration. It's absolutely worth it !<br />I'd really hoped this new release would be a dream-come-true, but now having viewed it, the only satisfaction I take is that I still have my private copy of the IRE disc...

B00005NWM3|4.0|I've read reviews that dismiss Nickelback as formulaic alt-rock and who cannot hold a candle to Creed and Pearl Jam. <br />Whatever. <br />For me, the simple fact is, this album gets my energy level up. Why, because of the power behind Ryan Vikedal's drums and Mike Kroeger's bass. Because Ryan Peake's guitar rides the back beat and pushes me further. Because Chad Kroeger sings with power and you can actually understand the lyrics, which is not something I can say about Creed or Pearl Jam.<br />This is a good hard rock album. Pure and simple.
B0000683DH|4.0|This movie is incredible! A great addition to the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. The new Director's Cut on Disc 1 is even more dramatic than the original cut. The extras on disc two are good, but for some reason they don't seem as compelling as the features for the &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; Director's Edition DVD. But they are still worth it! A great DVD edition! Movie Grade: A+; DVD Grade: B+
6302561841|4.0|I take a media arts course at my school and I recently watched this movie in it. I love the guy and the use of the camera was so great for the time period. I guess it's true when they say no one could ever do what he did. The skating scene is great and the plot's good as well. The hearding dissolve at the beginning is a great touch. The only down side is that many people today might not conect as well to the humor, but the character is definately something to remember, and it's worth watching. If you're interested at all in him and his work, I suggest watching the biography movie they made about him. It must be sme form of genius, what he did. I know he probably put so much of himself into it, because as slapstick as it may be, there is honesty in what he did and the messages he tried to get across using a good medium-humor.
1559949902|1.0|That real Witches are deceiving? That they hate children? This book shows exactly the ignorance of society and how that ignorance breeds ignorance. If you are going to teach your children about real Witches, then why don't you find books that do instead of letting them read tales such as this. Would your child like a book about how Christians or Hindus or Buddhists or Druids are child-hating, deceiving people? I think not. Children are impressionable and it is up to you to show tolerance rather than ignorance. Educate yourself.

630018160X|4.0|I'm grateful for the comments before me which explain the enigma that is \\"Sweet Charity.\\" It takes a book of a relatively sad, downtrodden character and turns it into a musical (and not a happy-go-lucky one either, as is often the assumption). The film comes at the start of the stylized, mod 70's- and while some of Fosse's visuals over-saturate this point, the story is so smart that it doesn't matter. (It was Fosse's first film direction and it has his signature all over it.) And I'm glad that the VHS presentation  letterboxes the musical numbers, even if it standard-screens the nonmusical portions. There's no other way to view the dance hall girls sexily draped over the barre in \\"Hey, Big Spender,\\" or the film's best number- the sensational rooftop dance \\"There's Gotta Be Something Better Than This.\\" (This may be the most theatrical moment in the film as it allows pure, full-bodied dance by Shirley MacLaine, Chita Rivera, and Paula Kelly.) And those who generally dislike musicals would be surprised at the film's bittersweet ending; it's not entirely happy but it is completely triumphant, and it never ceases to bring tears (well, just one) to my eyes.

B00005OWEG|4.0|Before i knew that the redux was to be released I saw the original Apocalypse Now and regretted not seeing the redux first instead.  But after seeing the redux I was glad that I had seen the original first.  The original is long enough as it is.  The slower pace of the redux version, coupled with the longer play time, may turn hurt first time viewers opinion of the movie as it did for my friend.<br />The redux is at least a must see for Apocalypse Now fans; I own it, but it is not for the first time viewer.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This is a great CD, incorporating so many different styles.  If you like jazz-rock, even bluegrass, you'll find something here that interests you.  My favorites, in addition to the hit &quot;No Such Thing&quot; are &quot;83&quot; (a smoky jazz number with a wry tone) and &quot;3 X 5&quot;, a country-western style number that ingeniously switches back and forth from minor to major keys.  It's the most uplifting song I've heard in years.  Those who criticize Mayer's lyrics for being too trite and shallow are missing the point - his wry sense of humor comes out as he essentially pokes fun at songs (and people) that take themselves too seriously.
B00005ABX0|2.0|Beach Boys fanatics will be fanatics about this but this is a pairing of a couple of extremely weak albums with &quot;only&quot; a couple of truly great songs on it (Heroes and Villains and Good something-or-other).  Smiley Smile is a stoned-sounding mess, many of the songs are incoherently awful and even the tuneful ones have seriously dumb lyrics (&quot;I love my vegetables&quot;) or aural noise experiments (laughing, speeding-up, etc.) that make them painful as background music.  Wild Honey is more coherent but the fire that was Pet Sounds simply sounds damp now.  For fans who have to have everything only.
B00005JKWI|3.0|It's nice to see all these movie fans gushing about how great they think Blade II is, but as a mature male I must admit to a certain disappoinment at the complete lack of sexual tension between vampire hunter Blade and the leather-clad vampire babe played by Leonor Varela. One of the things that made the original Blade so entertaining was the interaction between Snipes and N'Bushe Wright. Compared to Wright, Varela's character is cold and dead. And it's not that Varela doesn't know how to be sexy. Critics raved about her steamy performance in Cleopatra. Director Guillermo Del Toro basically dropped the ball. I mean, if you are going to dress a dark-haired beauty in full-length black leather, the least you can do is to make the outfit snug. Even teenage movie fans know that sex has been an essential element of vampire culture since the very beginning. It's absence leaves a gaping hole that Del Toro tries to fill with buckets of vampire guts, but it doesn't work. When Varela's character dies at the end, I didn't feel pity or regret, because she never really came alive as a character. To sum up, let's just say that while Blade II may be a good action flick, it's not a good vampire flick.<BR>Geoff Prescott
B000069AUI|5.0|Sometimes I find it really hard to buy a whole CD that I like.  Usually it turns out that only the hot single that was released on the radio is good but this whole album is awesome.  I never get tired of listening to it.  The songs are easy to relate to, fun to sing to, and they are sort of layed back and relaxing. I'd have to say that I got my money's worth in this one.
0316666343|5.0|Susie Salmon is your typical 14 year old girl. She just receive her first kiss and is a ninth grader ready to move up to high school. But sadly Susie will never get that chance. One snow December day in '73 as Susie walked precariously home from school she was lured by curiosity into an under ground tunnel by her neighbor Mr. Harvey only to not return alive. This book is Susie's story from Heaven. It is a tale filled with hope for happiness and sorrow for those lost. It is definately one book that leaves you feeling different, almost changed when you are finished.
B0000025L0|5.0|This art form of jazz fusion was never better than this amazing album. At the height of the movement, Stanley Clarke created a collection of pieces that brought together not only great players, but excellent melodies, muscular arrangements, and a profoundly funky edge that leaves most jazz-rock/fusion eating dust.<br />Into these six tracks, Clarke packs energy, daring and taste. Supplemented by what can only be called the best players in fusion and rock (Jeff Beck, David Sancious, Billy Cobham and, oh yes, John McLaughlin) Clarke removes the bass from the hands of limited slappers and extends playing technique that despite what some may think, is still the gold standard.<br />Some may compare Stanley Clarke to his putative rival Jaco Pastorius, but while Jaco was a great player, no mistake, Clarke is a great musical mind.  The sweep of this music, the careful, but not constricted orchestration, the attention to detail all propel Stanley Clarke to the head of the class.<br />This album captures what was great about the best Jazz fusion, and indeed of the best of rock music of this time:  the sense of limitless ecstatic exploration.  In this dogmatic, cramped and idea-free era, listening to Stanley Clarke feels akin to Crimethink. Bring on the thought police, I'll confess.
B0000203YT|1.0|This movie is boring, stupid, horrible acting, gwynth acting is horrible, and COMPLETLEY missleading. The ONE thing i liked about this movie was the costumes. I had to fast forward through SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO many parts in this movie because they were boring, pointless, pathetic or a combonation of all of them.There is absolutely no point to this movie whatsoever. Don't waste your time with this boring movie.
B00005JLIU|5.0|I have this movie on VHS and it's getting pretty worn out.  This has got to be one of the best musical comedies ever made. Just take a look at the cast. You can't beat it. You have the most talented people in Hollywood in the movie and behind the scenes.I've seen the new Broadway production an it can't hold a candle to this 1967 film version. I'm a huge Broadway fan and have been in several productions myself but the Broadway version just doesn't have the same spirit as the film.I only hope that when the DVD does come out that they will keep it in it's Roadshow format. The VHS version i have has the Overture, Intermission and Exit Music but not the Entr'ce music to Act II.  It's still a pretty good version and is also in 3 channel stereo.This movie is a classic, the acting is the best, the music score is terrific, costumes are beautiful. This will be a must to everyones collection.  I just hope it is soon.
B000002KBU|5.0|I was at the same concert ... Il loved &quot;A case of you&quot;, althought Diana's voice is lower ...Did you notice that the piano intro was the theme from Joni's &quot;All I want&quot; 'also on &quot;blue&quot; ...<br />A great tribute !
0780020685|5.0|This IS a classic! Look at many W. Allen's films - it's there! Look at many other modern  films - it's THERE, TOO! Look at this film itself - it's a CLASSIC! ... What else can I say? --- That's IT! Buy IT! --- Tis IS a Classic!
B000006045|5.0|I bought this cd back in 1998, after seeing the video for teardrop on some late night \\"alternative\\" cable music show.  It was one of the most beautiful songs I'd ever heard.<br />I was thoroughly surprised and delighted to discover, on purchasing the album, that the entire thing was incredible.  No matter how many times I listen to it, the hair on the back of my neck still stands up on \\"Angel\\".  <br />I put this cd on in my car when its a rainy day, and I have a long drive.  It's ability to calm me is almost \\"zen-like\\".<br />Recently, when creating a bunch of themed playlists of my mp3's I was impressed to discover that this album was put on both my \\"sex\\" and \\"murder\\" playlists.  After listening to it, I think it is apparent as to why it is appropriate for both.<br />Even after all these years, its still one of the best cd's I've ever heard.  I highly recommend it.
B0000640VO|5.0|... Amelie is a gem you can NOT pass, it's a film you 'll watch over-and-over when your days are black - and you will always find something to live on. It's a film about an ordinary life, that can change a life of her own and other lives, too. It's a film about that &quot;I am the world&quot; - not a &quot;We are ...&quot;, and also about a fact that - life is TOO short to loose it ... :-)
B00005JKWJ|4.0|this is like buffy the vampire slayer on steroids! i mean, there are splashes of blood of course (hence the term: vampire movie), but i didnt think this movie was 'gory' at all... now the effects with the way the 'reaper' mouths opened was unexpected, but AMAZING!  i think the gore-factor is less in this movie than it was in the first blade movie...<BR>the only problem i have is only giving this movie 4-stars... i give the first blade 4-stars also, but blade two is far better than the original... <BR>the story line was pretty good, the effects were damn near great and overall this is just an excellent film... i look forward to the next one!
B000059HCI|5.0|Sara Goldfarb could be anyone's widowed mother. Harry Goldfarb and Tyrone could be anyone's sons. Marion could be the gorgeous girlfriend any mother would be thrilled to have her son bring home for dinner. Sara doesn't feel needed by anyone anymore. She's got her seating position among the women of her building who like to take in the sun in the afternoon, and she's got her television programs to which she is addicted. Her one goal is to appear on television in her red dress to make her friends and her family proud. Her son, Harry, just wants to make some money so he can live the life to which he has yet to become accustomed but knows he wants. If he and Tyrone can score that one big buy of drugs and sell them, they can be rich and live easy lives. Marion depends on the kindness of men to ease her way through life. In Harry she believes she's found her source of love, livelihood, and drugs. All four of these people want what everyone wants - to be loved, to be needed, and to be successful. Only for these four it all goes horribly wrong because, in their need, they accept addiction as part of the dream.<br />This movie is difficult to watch, but not because it isn't well done. I can't think of a movie that's done better than this one. It's just so horribly painful to watch people who have all the best intentions sink deeper and deeper into self-destruction. Louise Lasser plays Sara Goldfarb's best friend. She is the embodiment of the fact that people only see what they want to see, even when a friend, a close friend like Sara, become hopelessly troubled and essentially become someone else completely.<br />Requiem For A Dream is about drug addiction, but it is also about people leading quiet lives of desperation and the lengths to which they will go to try to grab the gold ring and realize their dreams. All of the actors in this movie are superb, and Ellen Burstyn should have won an Academy Award for the work she did in this movie. She is nothing less than outstanding. But credit should also be given to the way in which the movie was filmed. When Sara becomes paranoid, the camera helps you to feel the paranoid feelings she's experiencing. When Tyrone runs away from a shooting, the camera makes you feel his fear and his pounding heart as he flees. When Marion shows up at the door of a man who will give her drugs in return for whatever favors he requires, your skin crawls along with hers as she does whatever it takes to get her fix.  And there's another element to this film that affected me as I watched it. The music. It is an excellent addition to every scene with it's accompanying emotion.<br />I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes not only a good story well told, but also enjoys the separate elements that make a movie take hold of you and, in spite of difficult material, won't let you go until it's finished with you..

B00005UWBP|3.0|When I decided to watch this film with my kids, I thought it would be similar to another story by Michael Crichton, \\"Andromeda Strain\\" which is one of my favorite films. \\"Andromeda\\" showed the dangers of technology getting out of control, and J Park should have done the same. Unfortunately, we were very disappointed. Of course, the special effects were stupendous, and that is what makes the film tolerable, but the real technological issues raised by the film are barely discussed and compeletly ignored at the end. The climax of the film is a real \\"deus ex machina\\" and the heroes are saved by an incredible piece of luck and not really due to their own efforts. Behind the serious issues of the story is an inappropriate humorous backdrop which really gets out of hand when a man is killed while sitting on a toilet. This is incredibly infantile, but unfortunately common in modern films which have to have vomiting, bathroom scenes and foul language. I am a fan of Richard Attenborough from the movies \\"The Great Escape\\" and \\"The Flight of the Phoenix\\" but here he puts in a lifeless performance which reaches a nadir when he is enjoying eating ice cream and reminiscing about his earlier days, all the while his grandchildren are in great danger. Although I would not consider it a waste of time to watch this film, I think I will pass up the two sequels.
B00005JKG7|5.0|GREAT MOVIE TO SIT AND FEEL CREEPED WITH. WHO WASN'T AFRAID OF FOGS AFTER SEEING THIS ONE THATS WHAT I WANNA KNOW!. THE TRANSFER TO DVD WAS GRRRRRRRREAT! THE COLORS WONDERFUL, BLACKS ARE AS BLACK AS CAN BE, AND SOUND GREAT. GREAT GREAT JOB!
B00000064G|4.0|Recently, it has become fashionable for artists (particularly in the alt-country movement) to record spare, stripped-down albums featuring mostly just their own voice and and accoustic guitar.  Richard Buckner's \\"Devotion + Doubt\\" and Patty Griffin's \\"1000 Kisses\\" are two excellent recent examples of the style.  But Nick Drake's \\"Pink Moon\\" was the grandaddy of the all.  Given the sheer talent that burns on this record, it makes his subsequent overdose and death all the more unfortunate.<br />As for the songs, the title track is the signature song and thanks to Volkswagon is now Drake's most well known song.  Almost as good is the second song, \\"Place to Be.\\"  Also outstanding are \\"Which Will\\" (later covered by Lucinda Williams) and the instrumental \\"Horn.\\"  After that, the going gets a little rougher.  \\"Things Behind the Sun,\\" for example, is a bit too rambling and at a mere half hour, the album feels a tad slight.<br />Nevertheless, it is still a substantial and chilling work from an influential and tragic musical pioneer.
B000066I6N|5.0|I just had the pleasure of seeing Plant live.  He wowed the crowd, and there wasn't a doubt in anyone's mind that he still had it.  Perhaps what came through the most at the show was his sense of fun, and being comfortable in what he wants to do.  This album conveys that same sense.  It's a pity that some of reviewers here judged this album with such a closed mind, and were expecting the follow up to &quot;Coda,&quot; but maybe this album isn't for everyone.  No it isn't the next led Zep album, but it is damn good. Plant is sharing with the listener some of his favorite songs, and you can tell from the music, and if not, from interviews and concerts, that he truly loves these songs, and gets great pleasure out of playing them.  His voice has changed, but what speaks volumes about Plant's musicianship is that he's learned to change his voice as the high notes fade, and he makes the most out of what he has.  Now of course Plant isn't the only artist on the album, the Strange Sensations are a mix of seasoned veterans, all of which are top notch players and performers.  They are a really tight band, and this is the best, most comfortable ensamble Plant has been in since the mighty Zep years.  All in all, this is an excellent CD, and if Plant is ever anywhere near your town, I suggest you go and see him, he puts on an amazing  show!
B00004STPT|5.0|When Gladiator was released in 2000, it repidly became one of the first great scores of the new millenium.  Hans Zimmer along with Lisa Gerrard created a masterful a-typical adventure score.  Zimmer captures the action of the epic's great battle scenes, the intrigues of the Roman court, and the love of family.  As stated before, this score is a-typical.  While it does have several themes, the way Zimmer has composed his themes is different.  For example, though this is a historical epic, Zimmer makes use of the synthesizer in addition to the regular orchestra.  Gerrard's vocals are haunting, and are a perfect fit with the rest of the score.  Her voice helps define the emotions on the screen.  Overall this is a great score and was a much better choice for the academy award than the actual winner of 2000.
B00005JK8K|4.0|This was a terrific war movie with very realistic battle scenes and a strong plot on the dysfunctional life of a soldier who blamed himself for the death's of his squad. <br />I don't understand the bashing it has taken from the critics. It seems that because the writers and producers wanted to deal with subject matter that included minorities in a substancial role they opened themselves to the cultural police. Had the title been \\"Enders War\\" I wonder if there would have been so much fuss about the lack of focus on the code talkers themselves? <br />I know that there were some minor technical errors in the film but I have NEVER seen a war movie with zero errors. I found that the movie moved quickly thus keeping my attention but unfortunatly it did skip over several opportunities for more in depth character development. I believe that there is only so much time a person will sit and watch a movie and the makers of the movie took this into consideration. Overall I found this film to be an outstanding war movie along the lines of \\"BAND OF BROTHERS\\" though it did not tug on the emotions like \\"Saving Pvt. Ryan\\" or \\"We Were Soldiers\\"
B00000I07Q|5.0|This album, of course, was the followup to the mega-smash hit \\"Slippery When Wet\\" album.  Of course this didn't sell quite as many millions, but it was still huge.  While \\"Slippery\\" had two # 1 and three total top 10 hits, this album also had two # 1's and a total of FIVE top 10 hits.  For sure, the success was once again well-deserved.<br />Some of the best-ever Bon Jovi tracks are on this album, such as the huge rocking hits \\"Lay Your Hands On Me\\" and \\"Bad Medicine\\" as well as non-hits like \\"Wild Is The Wind\\", \\"Stick To Your Guns\\" (with its lead-in \\"Ride Cowboy Ride\\") and \\"99 In The Shade\\".  \\"Born To Be My Baby\\" was a fantastic anthem hit as well.  I also enjoyed \\"Blood On Blood\\", an anthem about brotherhood and \\"boys becoming men\\".<br />On the other side, a few tracks are present that are not quite up to the level of previous Bon Jovi tracks, such as the hit \\"Living In Sin\\", \\"Homebound Train\\", and the silly \\"Love For Sale\\", which closes the album.  Don't get me wrong--these songs are for the most part very good, but just not quite to the previous level.<br />That leaves \\"I'll Be There For You\\", the definining ballad and another huge hit on this album.  You listen to it at first and thing that the lyrics are just too cheesy and sappy even for Bon Jovi, but over time it still grows on you.  While this ballad didn't have quite the power behind it of previous Bon Jovi ballads, it is impossible not to like it overall.<br />Overall, I love this album still.  While a few of the tracks aren't quite as good as on previous albums, others are simply amazing.  Still too great an album overall to give less than five stars.  After all, it is the last truly rocking Bon Jovi album to date.
B000060MY6|1.0|LA. A city of dark-seeded passions and false fantasies. It can be a city that consumes the naive with hopes of being someone bigger, meaning something larger.  We know. We know. But wait, this is not just an average film about vanquished hopes and overwhelming trials in the city of celebrity, this is a David Lynch film, therefore, it must have a DEEPER meaning. Let's go and see shall we........<br />Two girls meet in LA. One, a blonde, is a classic girl-next-door type who will have every viewer falling in love with her.  The other girl, a brunette, has seemingly lost her memory and will have every guy lusting profoundly after her.  The dark haired gal was almost killed in the beginning of the film - twice. The two gals meet up and the blonde - ever ready to help a hottie(I'll explain in a moment) - does her best to help the other lady find out her indentity.  Then, right when we're thinking that maybe Lynch won't pull any of his usual \\"deep and artistic\\" stuff, we're abruptly taken into Lynchland........<br />The two girls are lesbians(nice touch, Davey, especially for the porn-hounds out there), and they seem to change identities on numerous occasions, throwing off every single viewer into utter disorder and confussion. It is during these confusing segments that the Lynch-lovers out there instantly say to themselves: \\"WOW, what an artistic delight.  ...
B00000I07R|4.0|Like rock music in general, Bon Jovi was different in the 1990s then they were in the '80s.  For sure, this effort is more serious and &quot;mature&quot; (translation:  less rocking) than all previous Bon Jovi albums.  The &quot;heavy metal-ish&quot; sound is clearly gone.  Nonetheless, the great musicianship is still there, making this an overall worthwhile listen.<br />When you think of all the rocking Bon Jovi songs on previous albums, it is amazing to me that only true HARD rock sound here is on track 9--with &quot;Fear&quot;.  Nothing else would I call above an uptempo anthem.  That being said, I love the catchy title track as well as the pretty ballad &quot;In These Arms&quot;.  &quot;If I Was Your Mother&quot; is a uniquely interesting mid-tempo song.  &quot;I'll Sleep When I'm Dead&quot; is very infectuous and catchy as well.  These songs plus several others kept me listening to this album instead of Nirvana in 1992 and '93.<br />On to the negatives, besides the general fact that the hard rock sound is really lacking on most of the album.  &quot;Bed Of Roses&quot;, while the only top 10 hit on the album, is too long, slow, and dreary.  Sometimes I like the song, but overall it is a weak hit for Bon Jovi.  &quot;Dry County&quot; is also too slow in most spots (not including a solo that picks up the pace later in the song), and it is WAY too long at nearly 10 minutes.<br />At the time this album came out, I wondered what was going on here with the lack of hard rock from a band that had rocked on its previous four albums.  Over the past decade it has become plain to see that this is a common trend among many one-time &quot;pop metal&quot; bands.  If all you care about is hard rock, then this won't likely be for you, but if you also like more mellow melodic rock with still a bit of a kick, then you may still enjoy this one.
0316776963|5.0|My brother recommended this book. I took it on a flight from Atlanta to Barcelona and laughed out loud the whole way. If you enjoy intelligent humor you'll get a kick out of the stories in this book. Lots of fun.
B00000I07P|5.0|Truth be told, Bon Jovi's sound didn't change all that much on this third album of theirs compared to their first two albums.  But by the time this came out, in 1986, the pop music world was ready for hard rock to become big on the charts.  As soon as the rocking anthem \\"You Give Love A Bad Name\\" went to # 1, this band exploded into superstardom.<br />That superstardom is well-deserved.  Listen to this album!  The vocals are rough and yet melodic and soulful all at once.  The hard rock guitars and drums are top-notch.  When in the history of rock music has their ever been a catchier chorus than that to the all-time classic, also # 1 hit \\"Livin' On A Prayer\\"?  \\"Wanted Dead Or Alive\\" is a fantastic \\"cowboy anthem\\".  \\"Never Say Goodbye\\" is one of the best power ballads of a generation; it was even the theme song for my high school senior ball (as I'm sure it was for numerous others at that time).<br />Those are just the biggest hits that everyone heard at that time.  How about the heavy (if generic with the lyrics) leadoff track \\"Let It Rock\\", the beautiful power ballad \\"Without Love\\", or the anthemic, passionate \\"I'd Die For You\\" (which reminds me a bit of \\"Runaway\\" with its sound)?  These are all great songs.  Almost as good are the rockers \\"Raise Your Hands\\" and the closing \\"Wild In The Streets\\".  The only song that to me doesn't stand up in quality is the silly \\"Social Disease\\", but it is still a fun song with a rocking sound.<br />This album got so huge that I had to stop listening to it for a while after the fact.  But now, all these years later, it still sounds great.  For sure, it is a landmark '80s rock album, a defining album of that great decade of music.  Everyone who grew up in the 1980s and listened to rock music should own this album.  An all-time classic.
B00005JKHP|3.0|This director's cut by Robert Wise has some minor visual and audio improvements. Other editing is done as well, which is explained on the DVD. But overall, I still think this is a dull movie, and I'm a Star Trek fan. The DVD does have some nice behind-the-scenes documentaries. In fact, I found them to be more interesting than the movie itself.
0380799006|4.0|This is a very simple book that gives good tips on what to do to stop your kids from fighting so much. It's weakness is that it assumes kids fight over the same simple things, such as sharing toys. You can use the ideas and modify them to suit other situations. I'd also suggest How to Talk and a book titled Perfect Parenting to expand the situations and apply the concepts to all different aspects of raising your children.
B000001Y79|5.0|This album is masterpiece. I still have my original copy from 1995 when it came out and it still makes me ooze with excitement. Out of the many rock albums of the 1990's, this one will go down as being in the top 100 albums of all time. It is a classic! I love all of the songs on here. &quot;Spiderwebs&quot; always makes me feel energetic and youthful. And of course, &quot;Don't Speak&quot; leaves me in awe; it is a timeless song and I think it's one of the best rock ballads IN HISTORY! Anyway, BUY THIS ALBUM! It should be in everyone's cd collection!
6304806469|1.0|This is one of the worst films to hit the Disney masterpiece collection. It's an overrated movie for ages 5 and younger. The characters didn't interest me at all and The &quot;CHIM CHIMITY&quot; song was awful and so where were the other songs. If Disney dosent get their act together they will fall and DreamWorks will rise.
B00005QG9J|5.0|This band AND album have made my life worth living again. PERIOD.
B00005AXEL|5.0|A year after I bought this album I still listen to it all the time. As an old time Fleetwood Mac fan I guess I long for that sound. While this album is distinctly Stevie Nicks it brings back those fond memories of days when the grooves of the Fleetwood Mac albums got worn. Well this CD has surely been &quot;worn&quot; over the past year. In this age of mediocre Rock music this is one of the best albums in a long time by anybody. The best songs: Planets of the Universe, Trouble in Shangri-La, and I Miss You. Nothing bad either! Great effort.

What the hell is all the fuss about? And just who gave Ben Affleck the idea that he could act at all, let alone trying to get him to speak with an English accent. Horrible! But, of course, it had to be done - they had to put an American in there somewhere, just to make sure it sold in the US! Shallow!<BR>I am in awe that such a dull and shallow story could captivate people in this way.
B000009O8A|4.0|I Spit On Your Grave. I have to give this film four stars. Frankly, I am surprised that it did not receive higher ratings, and more favorable reviews in this forum. Even in todays cinematic climate, it remains disturbing and unsettling. It is easy to see why this film was considered controversial upon its release, and why ti stills remains as one of the most infamous underground films to date. Whatever genre this film is classified in...horror, exploitation, action, drama...it is a must see. The cheap cinematography, grainy texture, and tense atmosphere are a few of the highpoints of this film. It is also the most brutal and accurate depiction of the terrible atrocity of rape I have ever viewed. I want to make readily known however, that this film SHOULD NEVER BE VIEWED BY A MINOR UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE! This film is highly graphic and very disturbing, and should only be viewed by adults who know what this film contains. Highly recommended, highly warned.
0783230702|4.0|When I saw this movie in the theaters, I thought it was going to be alot like Seven.  Although they really weren't, it was still a very excellent, thoughtful movie.  I would always recommend it to friends, so I finally decided I might as well buy it for myself instead of renting it so many times!
B00000JLWW|1.0|TERRIBLE. I went to the theaters to watch this film, and could not wait for it to end. A terrible rehash of a cliched love story sold only by its special effects. This film is not worth ten minutes, much less three hours! Nothing can save this film from being placed on my list of WORST CINEMATIC EVENTS OF ALL TIME. Its difficult to believe that in an age of such movie diversity, this title could be so highly recommended and praised. I must say that even my fiance, who enjoys romance films, thought Titanic was a monumental disappiontment. With all the great romances available, leave this one on the shelf and spend your money on somethign worhtwhile. I gave this film one star, although it is considerably lower than that!
B000002L75|5.0|The two Depeche Mode albums that I never get tired of listening to are Violator and their 1984 release Some Great Reward.  Every song on this album is good with not one &quot;filler&quot; in sight.  People Are People was DM's first U.S. hit mainly because of it's huge appeal on the dance floor.  Other stand out tracks include Something To Do, Blasphemous Rumours, and Master and Servant.  Yes, the music is all done with synthesizers and drum machines but so what?  The sound is impossibly catchy and much more mature than their previous three releases.  David Gahan's voice is moody just the way we like it and Martin Gore's writing has rarely been better.  If you're a fan of early 80's synth pop or you're just wanting to find out about Depeche Mode than pick this CD up.  You won't regret it.
B00004Y87O|5.0|Snake Plisken, one of the definitive choatic heroes of the action drama. Once again, John Carpener surpassed himself with this dark classic! From begiinning to end this film is one wild ride! Regretably, the sequel Escape From LA, was a disappointing follow-up to this 80's masterpiece. I highly recommend this DVD, and give it a five star rating.
B00003CXI1|4.0|I am a huge Harry Potter fan!!  Being 21 years old, I never thought I would write those words!  I really love these books and the movie is great too.  My only advice is...I loved the books so much that the movie wasn't all that I wanted it to be (altough it is still wonderful).<br />Surely a movie that you should watch.  Try the books too!  YOU WILL LOVE THEM!
B00003BDXG|5.0|Yes, of course this movie is a furious parody about media, media-influences and driving-forces. That's especially obivious in the end, when the media literally gets killed in person of the reporter.<BR>One should keep in mind that Mickey and Mallory are not killing machines without any conscience just by that. First, their incredible harsh childhood lead to their killing obsession (they are victims in this matter). Second - and that's one of the most important scenes and themes in the movie - they change their minds when Mickey killed the indian. It's a turning point. (that's why the court scene has been cut out, showing too much brutality AFTER the indian-experience).<BR>The jail-interview is in my opinion a very sophisticated, interesting and provoking one; but of course that's just a personal opinion.<BR>I didn't like the movie at first sight. But it has the ability to grow and show lots of aspects at second sight.
014028009X|4.0|Okay, it's not the most... well, &quot;academic&quot; book, but it's still a lot of fun.  Actually, my favourite character was not Bridget, but her mother.  Such a colourful, silly, petty, STRANGE woman!<br />For those who have seen the movie before reading the book, be forewarned... all is not the same.  Both start off in a similar manner, but the end of the book is quite different (I almost wish they had filmed the book's version of the last few diary entries... that would have been a hoot!).<br />All in all, it's a fun book, but don't read it expecting to learn anything or experience anything new and earth-shattering.  It's light reading at its best.
B00006IUL7|4.0|This is one of the most beautifully crafted thrillers to have been made in recent years and that should not be a surprise to fans of Chris Nolan's last effort, the fantastic Memento. <br />As Insomnia begins, Will (Pacino) and his partner Hap (Donavan) are being flown in to help solve the murder of a 17 year-old girl. The story takes a turn when Will kills Hap in a tense and confusing chase in the foggy terrains of Alaska. Will suffers from depression and insomnia which adds to the tension that he is suffering as the investigation continues. Walter (Robin Williams) who is a suspect in the murder is playing mind games with Will, taking advantage of his Insomnia and at the same time trying to jeopardise the investigation, while (Hillary Swank) is a rookie who idolises Will as a model detective. <br />The relationship that the characters develop with each other is the centrepiece of this film, so don't be expecting a serial killer film as the murder takes a back seat to the acting and character development. Pacino is excellent in this role, and no matter how many times he has played a detective before, he really polishes it off in this film. Expect an Oscar nod for him. Robin Williams might seem like a bizarre choice as a murder suspect but he is very good in this role and is given a loose leash by Nolan to have a bit of fun, throwing in some of his own humour. But his role is still very constrained considering the man played Mrs Doubtfire. Another surprise is ex-90210 regular Hillary Swank. Her performance may not be as good as her Oscar winning role as gender bender `Brandon Tina' in \\"Boys Don't Cry\\", but it's still damn good. <br />Insomnia is not this years `Sixth sense,' it plays it straight forward, but provides great thrills all the same. The scenery of Alaska is gorgeously captured and is a vital element since the environment plays a key role in this stylish thriller. Although the ending is a let down, Nolan weaves a beautiful tapestry of great acting, fantastic cinematography and a fantastic script, resulting in a beautiful film.
B000069I5W|2.0|Robert De Niro must be going through mid life crisis.  Arguably one of the best dramatic actors of his generation, De Niro continues to try to prove himself as a comic actor in a parade of mediocre scripts (The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle, Meet the Parents, Analyze This, Showtime).  De Niro isn't a terrible comedian; he is just such a great dramatic actor that his comic ambitions seem pointless.  It is like Michael Jordan trying to play baseball.<br />This script is a weak satire of reality cop shows and buddy cop flicks.  It is no coincidence that the director of this film is Tom Dey, whose only other directorial effort was \\"Shanghai Noon\\", a Jackie Chan vehicle where Jackie does a comic duet with Owen Wilson in a lampoon of westerns.  The hope was that Dey would be able to weave the same kind of satirical magic here, but this film comes up way short.  To his credit, he did manage to give the film some good action footage.   <br />De Niro tries to play the straight man in an absurd situation and it seems like his is the only character that realizes the lunacy of it.  Everyone else seems to take their absurdity seriously.  The tongue in cheek comedy is way over the top.  Rene Russo, William Shattner and Eddie Murphy overact so terribly that it is more sad than funny.  As a footnote, Drena De Niro (Robert De Niro's adopted daughter), appears for the fifth time in a film with her dad as Annie, the assistant producer and Rene Russo's sidekick.<br />The star power in this film was costly with a hefty budget over $85 Million and a box office of half that amount.  I rated it a 4/10.  This one needs to gather dust on the rental shelves and De Niro needs to get back to serious acting.
B000025AJM|5.0|fantastic - i bought this album in 1970, i loved it, it's a little rock/jazzy infusion. i have not heard this record in 30 years it sounds just as good now, this cd would probably do better on today's market than when it originally was introduced.very well put together record for it's time.i recommend buying this one, y won't regrit it.
0790729725|5.0|What a classic. but first i must address the review on the first page from \\"a 12 year old viewer\\" titled \\"Goodfellas\\" (I think). Well first, De Niro is one of the most important characters in the movie (along with joe, ray etc.). Its also alot more than just \\"Cuss words and blood\\", actually watch the movie instead of just the violence and language aspect of it, anyway, this movie is not intended for an audience of your age. The movie shows an accurate representation of the mafia in america during 1930 through to 1980(and beyond) as well as a damn good story. Each actor (and actress) give it their best and it shows. Watch this movie because it is the best mafia movie ever made, i liked it better than the godfather movies, but thats just my opinion. (although the kid had a point about the pretty heavey violence and amount of swearing, but its pretty funny).
B000002I25|5.0|The Greatest Doors Albums. It has all the greats including Back Door Man. Which is great and on and on.
0767800958|3.0|If you are studying argentine tango, you should absolutely look at this carefully. If you are curious about the &quot;tango scenes&quot; in Paris, Argetina &amp; London ... this is your movie. Aside from that: the otherwise talented Ms Potter is a very flat actress [I would have loved to see someone else in this role] and the weak use of Tango as a metaphor for control in other things ... is labored and lacking in depth. But the dancing, settings and music are superb.
0380820846|4.0|Romancing Mr. Bridgerton.  I don't think this title fit the story.  But whatever.  I really really enjoyed this book, and almost stayed up all night to finish reading it, but my husband was sad w/o me in bed.  Penelope is the typical Wallflower, her own shyness has caused her to not be very noticeable.  Colin is charming and sweet, and has almost consistently been compassionately kind to Penelope.  I say compassionate, because sometimes it was due to pity that he was kind.  Penelope is befriended and soulfully encouraged by the outrageous, tell-it-like-it-is Mrs. Danbury.  With this friendship, Penelope starts expressing her inner feelings & opinions in the presence of the ton, to everyone's surprise.  No one (minus those that really know her, like her best friend Eloise & Eloise's mother, Matriarch Bridgerton) ever surmised that Penelope actually had a brain.  Most of the dialogue is believable & natural and sometimes downright heartwrenching.  However, there are moments when the dialogue feels forced and fake, and I concur with the other reviewers when they say it seemed like Ms. Quinn was just filling up space.  Most of this book is truly an enjoyable read.  I have only read one other of the Bridgerton series, Benedict & Sophia's story, which I thought was also very enjoyable.  But I like this story better.  I felt more when I was reading it.  For the readers who didn't find any change in Penelope, I don't think you were reading v. well.  Penelope was forced by her mother to wear colors that were not complimentary, previously she had never spoke her mind because of her debilitating shyness but with someone as open & outrageous as Mrs. Danbury encouraging her, telling her that maybe there is something more to her, she was able to open up & not be so shy around people.  Penelope did change in this book, and also Colin grew up and was able to finally SEE Penelope for who she was, not his little sister's best friend, but a WOMAN who had quite a BRAIN in her and who gave him the courage and confidence that his writing might actually be worth something.  I give this book 4.5 stars, due to areas where the dialogue was less than up to Julia Quinn's normal par and felt stunted & unnatural. I CANNOT wait for Eloise's story.
B000002LCX|4.0|This, the last album from The Smiths, is often unfairly accused of not being on par with the band's previous works - or even of being tossed-off or half-completed. Let me be the first to tell you that this is not the case. This is, in every way, The Smiths most ambitious and experimental album. Whether or not it is their best is an open question, but its worthiness is not in doubt. I find it very unfortunate that this is the last studio album we got from the band, as it sees them moving forward in exciting, inventive new ways. Having reached the apex of the original phase of their songwriting with The Queen Is Dead, The Smiths, wisely, decided not to try and copy that album, but instead to make an entirely different kind of album. Morrissey's lyrics here are just as sharp, poignant, and wise as ever, but they are not drastically changed from previous works. No, what makes this album different from all the other in the catalog of The Smiths is the music. Whereas their debut album featured mostly plaintive, simplitic musical backings, Johnny Marr, on the next two Smiths albums, fashioned an intricate tapestry of dense, interwoven guitars and textures. He takes it one step further here, incorporating an orchestra, saxes, and more. The mastepiece Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me is perhaps the epitome of The Smiths musical sophistication. Other songs (Unhappy Birthday, Girlfriend In A Coma) are perfect, flawless pop. Still others are superb riff-driven songs. Marr, much like U2's The Edge, was always a guitarist who favored textures and soundscapes as his musical delivery of choice, rather than the more traditional riffs and solos. This album, though, finds him experimenting with electric guitar feedback (I Started Something I Couldn't Finish), keyboard-driven arrangements (A Rush And A Push And The Land Is Ours), and more. Even Morrissey himself, who mocked his own piano-playing skills in The Queen Is Dead, nevertheless offers up an intimitable, tinkling codaon the instrument to Death of A Disco Dancer. And, as always, Andy Rourke, one of rock's top and most underrated bassists, along with drummer Mike Joyce, danced across the beats just as skillfully as ever. Top tracks include the masterpieces, Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me, Paint A Vulgar Picture, and two of the all-time best sarcastic pop songs, Girlfriend In A Coma and Unhappy Birthday. Although you should not start here - I reccommend Meat Is Murder or one of the band's numerous compilations for the neophyte - this is an essential album for any fan of The Smiths.
B000000I0D|5.0|My first Oldfield album was a copy of Tubular Bells, given to me in 1981 as a leaving present from my classmates in North England as I left for a new life in Australia.<BR>I was thirteen at the time and thought the best thing about the album was that one man had played every instrument on it.  <BR>There was something about the music, and perhaps something about the timing of it that made me feel like I had my own piece of England with me whenever I listened to it.<BR>A few years later and I was buying my own albums and it was then I discovered Crises.<BR>This was Mike Oldefield ten years after Tubular Bells and WOW! What a transformation.  At that point I had not heard all of the albums in-between Tubular Bells and Crises, so for me it was almost hard to believe it was the same artist.  Except of course for that distinctive Oldfield &quot;slightly distorted guitar&quot; sound.<BR>I haven't yet heard all of Oldfield's work, but to date it is probably his darkest and most pure rock based release.<br />Listening to the title track with headphones is a musical must for any fan of great music, but especially fan's of synthesised new age rock.  <BR>Oldfield's ability to make sound dance through the stereo spectrum and provide the listener with tiny details of sound make this an almost hypnotic experience.  The climax of this track is akin to the exquisite construction of a Beethoven symphony as he builds layer upon layer of sound all the while increasing the rumbling of the bass drums and acoustic guitars to an almost deafining roar.  So if you do decide to go with the earphones - keep the volume control within reach!<BR>The rest of the album includes a brilliant display of Oldfield's flamenco guitar skills with the track Taurus III, a song called &quot;Moonlight Shadow&quot; that made it to the charts in the UK and Australia which shows how Oldfield could have easily gone down the &quot;pop song writer&quot; track.  This track is claimed on some web sites to be a tributeto the late John Lennon, but I've yet to see any official confirmation of that.  The vocal talents of Maggie Riley are put to very good use on Moonlight Shadow and &quot;Foreign Affair&quot; and the final track &quot;Shadow on the Wall&quot; could have been a respectable addition to just about any UK rock bands repertoire.<BR>If you're already an Oldfield fan and you don't have this - go and get it.  If you're not yet familiar with his work, then listen to it, it won't be the last Oldfield CD you buy.<BR>I've just replaced it after my Vinyl copy finally died.  I hadn't listened to it in over ten years and now I'm driving my wife crazy with it all over again.
0517053616|1.0|I am a professional actor and teacher of Shakespeare. This is a vastly inferior edition of Shakespeare's complete works. There is no room in the margins for making notes. There are no footnotes to aid the reader with antiquated language and references. The binding is insubstantial and the gilding sticks to other pages. I picked this book up at a bookstore once and thought I would enjoy such a pretty and portable copy of Shakespeare's works. As soon as I opened my copy of the book, I immediately returned the book to the bookstore. I found misspellings and errors and the type was so tight, I found the text difficult to read. Try to save your money for the Riverside Shakespeare (a book you and your family will enjoy for years, mine is 25 years old) and use the Folger if you need to by one play at at time, but go to the library for your Shakespeare before wasting your money on this piece of junk. The notes are helpful and aid in the enjoyment of the text. Avoid this book!
B00005TT77|5.0|This is a really fun soundtrack/album.  Much of the criticism I've read seems to surround 2 things - 1) Why did they do the remakes and keep them so similar to the originals and 2) Gosh darnit, they don't sound like the original Beatles songs which were the best ever yadda yadda.<br />OK, number 1 - from what I read about the soundtrack, the movie creators wanted to use the original Beatles songs, and had paced and molded the movie to fit them. But, the Beatles (or their lawyers, I expect) said 'No Way, you can't use Beatles songs in movies.'  So.... rather than rewrite the movie they found some great artists to cover the songs with one request - please pace it like the original so that it still fits with the movie.  <br />Number 2 - they don't sound like the Beatles because, well... do you see a Beatle on the list? Nyahh.  So loosen up - it's not the Beatles.<br />Given number 1 and number 2 - now you know why the songs are, and why they are the way they are. <br />My favorites are Two of Us, Blackbird, I'm Looking Through You, and Mother Nature's Son.  This is one of the first soundtracks that I've heard in a while, that while I was watching the movie I thought - 'Hey, I really would like that!' It's driving down the road on a crisp fall day with the windows down kind of music.<br />Have fun.
B000068IEU|5.0|This is what I have been waiting to see ever since I first saw \\"Last House\\" several years ago, the most complete version of the film available.  This DVD version is great because it includes several scenes that were cut from the film over the years of it's release.  This most controversial film has been chopped to bits by theatre managers, video production companies, and censors.  Contained on this DVD are such infamous scenes as the \\"disembowellment\\" scene, the \\"severed arm\\" scene, and the scene where one of the murderers actually carves his name into the chest of his innocent teenage victim.  This version also gives you the story behind the nortorious \\"Piss your pants\\" scene and the scene where one of the killers gets his penis chewed off by the mother of his victim.  This DVD release also answers the question of \\"Whatever happened to that actor/actress?\\" with the extras.  There are clips of interviews with some of the cast of virtual unknowns that starred in this classic horror/exploitation film.  If you have never seen this film before...see this version and if you have seen it before and were nauseated or disturbed by it, you haven't seen anything yet!
B00005YXZH|5.0|Listening to this album is like putting your ear up against a thin spot in the wall between us and some parallel universe, and Jeff Tweedy is the holy fool we're eavesdropping on. A brilliant and quirky tour de force.
B00003CX5P|3.0|When George Lucas decided to make the first prequel to the original \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy, devotees of the saga waited years with much anticipation for its release. When the time finally arrived, massive crowds gathered outside theatres, some waiting in protracted lines for days in advance, ready to once again enter that \\"galaxy far, far away\\" as soon as the doors opened. However, \\"Episode I - The Phantom Menace\\" left many die-hards of Lucas' space opera unsatisfied and disappointed. Not because it is a bad film, but because it lacks most of the elements which made the original trilogy the superb classic it is.<br />Set decades before the unforgettable Blockade Runner star-fight scene which kicked off the series in \\"Episode IV - A New Hope\\", \\"The Phantom Menace\\" finds a young Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and his mentor, Jedi master Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson), sent as diplomats to settle a trade dispute between the Galactic Trade Federation and the planet Naboo. Before the negotiations even begin, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon must brandish their lightsabers to battle droids, as the Galactic Trade Federation - used as puppets by Darth Sidious for a more sinister agenda - launches an invasion of Naboo. After the planet is seized by an army of Battle Droids, the two Jedi must rescue Naboo's adolescent queen - and future mother of Luke Skywalker - Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman), and escort her through a conflict-ridden journey to the Galactic Republic capitol, the planet Coruscant. Along the way, they are accompanied by the boy who's fate we all know, Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), a loquacious - and annoying - Gungan, Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best), and those two lovable droids, C-3PO and R2-D2 (Anthony Daniels and Kenny Baker).<br />There is plenty to enjoy in the first installment of the \\"Star Wars\\" prequels, like the exciting and fast-paced pod race sequence, action-packed star-fights, John Williams' impeccable - as always - score (one of his best!), and a spectacular, creatively-choreographed lightsaber battle between Obi-Wan Kenobi, Qui-Gon Jinn, and the Sith, Darth Maul. Unfortunately, the film seems homogenized, foisting special effects and laser battles in lieu of heart and imagination. The story is not engaging. Because you already know the fates of most of the characters, it seems somewhat pointless and redundant - ostensibly, George Lucas had dollar signs on his mind instead of devoted fans of the saga while writing the screenplay. The characters, although likeable, lack depth and dimensionality; the performances are adequate but never exhibited spirit and empathy. The dialogue is clichéd and banal. Lastly, the visual effects (courtesy of Industrial Light and Magic) are as impressive as ever, but the starships and vehicles do not meet the stunning originality of the designs seen in episodes IV through VI.<br />There is a lack of cohesion between \\"The Phantom Menace\\" and the original trilogy. Although part of the same body of work, they feel somehow disjointed. Perhaps the prequel is best viewed as a separate entity, not existing in the same world with the saga that began \\"A long time ago\\". George Lucas' vision is not how I wanted the \\"Star Wars\\" saga to begin.
B00003CXI0|1.0|THIS MOVIE IS SO CORNEY AND BORING I DIDNT EVEN WANNA FINISH WATCHING IT I HATED IT SO MUCH
B000002C1W|2.0|I've noticed that most of the reviews on this album are long and meandering, so I'm going to keep mine concise.  While &quot;Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot; is better than most other music that came out in the 1980's, it is disappointing to a rock (and, for that matter, Pink Floyd) fan.  The lyrics, while not bad, are not all that good, either.  The worst part, however, is the bland and formulaic music.  The only track I truly appreciated on this album is &quot;Signs of Life&quot;.  Frankly, I'm going to sell my copy.
B000067CPX|4.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers have undergone some serious changes. Youve heard this before a billion times but I'll confirm it for you:this CD isnt for everyone. In fact many people were very disappointed with it, including me at first. You have to let it grow, not to mention get it through your skull that this is very much not rap anymore. You have to learn to enjoy great harmony and several catchy choruses rather than funky beats and solos. But if you do this you will be greatly rewarded. Its not that much like By The Way except the choruses, so dont judge it on that. Listen to it before buying it. But dont just give up on it, because its a good CD.<br />Closing comments:The cover is weird and the llama in the booklet doesnt make any sense at all.
0316666343|4.0|I admit I approached The Lovely Bones with skepticism, because I generally avoid even so called \\"literary\\" books involving serial killers, a subject American authors exploit shamelessly. I was pleased to find the treatment of that part of the novel restrained, and overall I felt the novel was indeed lovely--well written and interesting, despite some unnecessary tangents.  Unique point of view, even if it made for a somewhat detached story.  <br />For another unique and enlightening story about grief, read Fran Dorf's SAVING ELIJAH.   In a novel some might mistake  for a ghost story, the \\"ghost\\" helps the reader see and feel the mother's despair from the inside, in all its ugliness and terror, which makes for a moving and authentic, if perhaps more <BR>intense, experience.  Take it from someone who's experienced such a loss.  <br />Grief is anything but detached. It's intense.
B00005JKWJ|4.0|Super vampires who feed on other vampires, add in martial arts, a lot of suspense, and some comedy, and you have a surprise hit. I saw Blade 1 (confession: on TV) and enjoyed it. This one went beyond my expectations. Not once did my finger hit the fast-forward button. <br />Blade 2 was like watching a live-action comic book. Not only that, but it had a real story, and the ending was unexpected. My only complaint was the occasional profanity, which never belongs in a comic book (darned if I'd let my kid watch a movie with cussin'.) But the special effects were great, right up there with the new Spiderman movie. In one scene a super vampire tears himself from a spike, and as he crawls up the wall you can see his intestines, and it looks believable. <br />Another confession: I'd actually think about buying this movie. <br />Looking forward to Blade 3.
B00005JKNC|5.0|I found this rather light-hearted romantic comedy quite entertaining, and one of the aspects I enjoyed most about it was the unusual dramatic direction in which comedian Jim Carrey seems to be going with such efforts as this one and his recent triumphant portrayal of the title character in \\"Truman\\". Once again Carrey neatly uses his considerable talents in more subtle ways than when chasing laughs in such slapstick efforts as \\"Ace Ventura, Pet Detective\\" or \\"Dumb and Dumber\\", and the result here is a very pleasing, and much more mellow movie.<br />Of course, Carrey is supported in all this with a whimsical story and a strong supporting cast, including veteran character actor Martin Landau as the father so desperate to find his lost son he is left clutching at the straw Carrey's character represents. ALso terrific are Bob Balaban and Hal Holbrook. Also noteworthy here is the lovely Laurie Holden, who delivers a wonderful and fairly complex performance as a no-nonsense woman whose heart slowly finds itself surrendering to Carrey's lost boy charm. Expect to hear much more from her in the near term future, as she has absolutely everything it will take to be a major leading lady.<br />Of course, this is a 1940s type movie, much like the feel-good stuff Hollywood once seemed to discharge with impish regularity from noted directors like Frank Capra and many others as well. And the use of the Hollywood blacklist here adds strength and purpose to the character's amnesia and recovery that it otherwise wouldn't have. After all, the fact that he was running away from something is a critically important aspect of the story, so using the blacklisting of artists so common in the early fifties is an interesting sidebar to the events transpiring on the screen.<br />However, I found the Washington hearing sequences to be out of place and much too shrill to be included with the movie. I believe the issue could have been handled in another way and not detract from the main story line being developed and grown before us. This ends up being a bittersweet statement on life, and how one can make it be what one wants and needs it to be, if only one has the strength, courage, and imagination to live it at the edge, taking the risks needed to make it work. I found myself smiling as the final credits came up, and glad to have witnessed Carrey's growth into a much more substantial actor and artist than I had thought he was capable of being. Hopefully he will continue along these lines, taking the risks he needs to take to fulfill his beckoning promise as a dramatic artist.ne being developed and grown before us.

B0000683DH|5.0|&quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan&quot; is a real masterpiece when you think about it.  There is so much depth to the story. This Director's Edition adds minor segments, the most noticeable is the part where we realize Shipmate Preston was Scotty's nephew. Interesting huh? Also, the special effects are very good, I don't care what era you're in. Khan is a great enemy, Spock dies, Kirk meets his son. All emotional stuff on so many levels. The extras are quite appropriate, except for a overlong feature on some Star Trek novel writers. The Director's commentary is as Spock would say it, &quot;fascinating&quot;, and it explains a lot. It also touches on the family that the actors have become, whether they like it or not. It's also probably the first commentary where I felt like I was holding back the tears. Check it Out, like now! Overall a great package.
0380973650|5.0|It's a wonderful story, thrilling, passionate, you just can't stop reading until the end. It's one surprise after another, and when you think it couldn't get better it gets. I was stuck to this book from the very beginning to the end, specially because of the two greatest characters (Wednesday and Shadow). It's just great.
B00005JKHP|2.0|Ok so this movie has been enhanced with new special effects, and features intriguing extras. The film has also been edited in places, which does make \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture- The Director's Edition\\" alot more watchable than the original. However, the movie still ... It is way too slow. Obviously if you're a Star Trek fan you're going to get all the movies to complete your collection. But to you Star Trek fans, be honest with yourselves, the movie is just boring. I suggest you buy it to compliment your collection, and watch it, the commentaries and the extra features once, before storing it away until \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture- The Real Short Version\\" comes out. The only really positive thing I can say about \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\", is that it did lead to \\"Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan\\".
0446677450|5.0|A must for everyone.  I bought each of my children a copy.  I hope they read it. (You know how kids are about something their parent suggests.)
B00000JCOV|5.0|i must tell you a couple of things...listen to a slipknot song before you buy this album. get a friend or someone at a local cd shop to play a song for you (the &quot;non-franchise&quot; places will still do it if you ask).  while you're listening to the song, look in the book at the lyrics.  i'll admit, they are difficult to understand at first, but you catch on quick if you know what they are saying.  also, look at the cover.  if the cover 1)scares you or 2)makes you roll your eyes, do not buy this album.  you weren't MEANT to get it.  slipknot has no pretenses and comes right at you.  the songs are well produced but don't have the feel of being over-tweeked.  this album is unbelievable, fast-paced inspired rage.  after many, many listens, i still come back to it.
B000002AS3|5.0|Only a few times in one's life does an album appear that is &quot;genius&quot;. Oasis put there name on the map or Rock n'Roll gods with this realse dated from 1994. Every song on the album has top 10 single potential. Must listen tracks on this album are &quot;Live Forever&quot; &quot;Supersonic&quot; and &quot;Slide Away&quot;. What's pleasing about this record is that it is raw and captures a band in a live like sound. Liam Gallagher's voice never sounded so pure and brother Noel's guitar elements make this a must have in anybody's record collection
B000006SQ0|5.0|From the opening strains to the final note on CD 2... you'll be swept away by the majesty of it all. It has Child of the universe, Mockinbird and of course Poor man's moody blues... each played in total symphonic majesty. <BR>Forget a best off compilation if you haven't heard BJH before. Live Tapes has them at their best, playing their best. <BR>Listen to it and you will wonder like i do everytime i listen to it - Just how exactly did the world miss out on this band?!?<BR>My advice. Buy two copies! So you always have one copy just in case the one you lent never came back (believe me it happens)!
0440539811|2.0|I must admit, this book is wildly entertaining. However, I took off three stars because of the way in which it mangles the more complex philosophical questions. Wilson preaches a very narrow, dogmatic ethic of paranoia-- &quot;A, and never B, is what the smart person is afraid of, and C, and never D, is how he can escape...&quot; and that in itself would not be so bad, had he not also disguised it, very effectively, as open-minded nonpartisan questioning or &quot;neophilia.&quot; He accomplishes this disguise through a...very superficial...PRETENSE that he does not arrive at a single answer. Thus, he manages to obscure the real questions, and possibly the anawers, for those potentially insightful minds with little training in critical evaluation. Please do not take this book at all seriously if you are seeking wisdom. I doubt that Wilson himself does so, unless I underestimate his intelligence. In fact, to view this book as a parody of liberal-progressive metaphysics and the &quot;X-Files&quot; fnord contingent would be a much more enlightening, and funny, approach.
B00005JLF5|5.0|I came late to the DS9 party, being a die-hard TNG fan.   I never watched the original airdates of DS9, but when then started showing reruns on local TV, I was hooked.   (Although I had to have a friend explain who was who and what was going on.)  This show is becoming my favorite of all the series.   The strong charactors, friendships and plot-lines make it exciting and realistic.   I'm so looking forward to the DVD coming out I plan to buy a DVD player and new TV for the occasion!
B000063USY|5.0|The Fast and The Furious has to be one of the greatest movies I have seen in a while!!  Its got awesome cars, and great racing scenes!  It is a close portrayal of real street racing in the Bigger cities.  I would recommend everyone watch it!  You may not like it, but I sure thought it was great! I cant wait untill number 2 comes out!!!  YIPPIE!
B00004T8RK|4.0|It seems like it was forever ago that Pearl Jam was the biggest band in the world, and even though those days are done, Pearl Jam continues to move along with they're brand of uncompromising hard rock.  &quot;Binaural&quot;, Pearl Jam's least sucessful album, is highly underrated and one of Pearl Jam's best.  Opening track &quot;Breakerfall&quot; followed by &quot;God's Dice&quot; are short and straight to the point rockers, while radio singles &quot;Light Years&quot; and &quot;Nothing As It Seems&quot; are mournful songs of resentment that fit the album perfectly.  &quot;Grievance&quot;, &quot;Insignificance&quot;, and &quot;Parting Ways&quot; are among some of Pearl Jam's best, and as I said before &quot;Binaural&quot; is one of Pearl Jam's best albums, but sadly it went overlooked by critics and audiences while bands like Creed, Nickelback, and Puddle of Mudd make millions from ripping of the sound that Pearl Jam (along with other bands of the grunge era like Alice in Chains and Soundgarden) helped create.  Hopefully Pearl Jam's upcoming new album will re-affirm them where they should be: on top.

B000001Y5X|5.0|Before \\"Antichrist Superstar\\" made Marilyn Manson a household name, this 1994 major label debut album was the beginning of he and his band invading mainstream America.  After shortening the name of the band from Marilyn Manson & The Spooky Kids to just Marilyn Manson, they signed with Interscope Records and Nine Inch Nails mastermind Trent Reznor produced this brilliant album; which showcases the social and moral decay of average Amercian family life.  Song like \\"Organ Grinder\\", \\"Cake & Sodomy\\", \\"Dogma\\", \\"Get Your Gunn\\", \\"Sweet Tooth\\", \\"My Monkey\\", \\"Misery Machine\\", and the chilling \\"Lunchbox\\" are all thought provoking songs that really do make the listener think.  Forget \\"Antichrist Superstar\\", \\"Mechanical Animals\\", and \\"Holy Wood\\", if there is one Marilyn Manson album to get, make it \\"Portrait of An American Family\\", and you will hear that the reason he is the man so many die hard Christian fanatics love to hate, is because he could be right about what he is saying.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne, the new punk-rock girl, is so fantastic. Let go is the best album I've ever heard. Don't hazytate to buy it. My favourite songs are: Losing grip, Complicated, Sk8er boi, Im with you, Unwanted and many more..<BR>FANTASTIC
0312263120|1.0|This could rank as one of the worst books I've even seem.  The author attempts to make some grand statement but it comes out as a palsied whine.  The plot is boring, the characters cardboard.  He thinks by throwing in some buzzwords he can form a techno-thriller, but it is painfully obvious that he forgot to look up what the words mean.  I now understand why it was so hard to find, I wish it had been harder.  This is definitely a 'B' grade effort from a 'C' grade author.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Jones' voice, instrumental skill, and (albeit limited) songwriting ability shine in this CD.  It has a decidedly laid-back feel that rings with musicality and passion.  It's romantic, honest, fun-loving, sexy... all the things good music should be.  Very worth the investment.
B000067DNC|5.0|Stargate SG-1 is a perfect blend of Sci-Fi, Humor and full blown ... action. Every episode is action packed with plenty of laughs and lots a real science. It's a basic good vs. evil show that will surely give you years of pleasure. I've seen every episode several times and I pre-ordered each DVD season and am anxiously anticipating the release of Season 3. So check this DVD set out. You will not be disappointed.
B000003NA4|5.0|This is a great album by a great jazz singer and pianist whose inimitable interpretations and sensuous, silky voice will long be remembered by jazz devotees. She can't be compared to Ella Fitzgerald or Billie Holiday or any of the other great lady jazz artists, because she is one of a kind. But she ranks right up there with the best of them.

6303314015|5.0|I am 20 years old and this movie is still an absolute favorite of mine for animated films!  I remember, I was around 13 I guess when this movie came out and I absolutely loved it!  I had the priveledge of seeing it in theaters which was great!  I wouldn't recommend it for very young children though as it has a few slightly violent scenes in it.  In the end during the fight of Scar with Simba, the part where Scar jumps through the flames really scared me when I first saw it!  But anyway, this is definitely the best animated film ever made!  One of the cutest scenes is when Simba is born.  He is absolutely adorable!  There is some excellent music in the first half of the movie!  Circle of Life is the very first song and it is so awesome!  And then combine it with the scenery at the beginning of the movie and I must say, this is definitely an awesome song!  I Just Can't Wait To Be King is another song that I absolutely loved!  It is so upbeat and it is great for kids but I love it still as a 20 year old woman!  Be Prepared is another song that I like but it has kind of a scary tone (for little kids) to it.  Hakuna Matata was another one of the great songs!  The characters, Timon and Pumba do one of their first scenes in this song.  Can You Feel the Love Tonight is probably one of the absolute best songs of the whole movie!  It is a great children's song but it is also is great for adults!  I love that song!  The rest of the songs I really don't remember.  However, my family and I love this whole movie so much that our two cats are named after it!  In fact, our beautiful male Siamese's name is Simba and our younger female Persian's name is Nala.  In the movie, Simba and Nala start out as best friends but then later on they become a couple and I believe they have a baby and they show the baby in this movie but it might not happen until the sequel.  And by the way, the sequel is also a MUST SEE!  Believe me, you will not be disappointed if you get this movie \\"The Lion King\\".  Don't hold me to this but I believe The Lion King won two Academy Awards for Best Music, three Golden Glob awards (Best Motion Picture, Best Original Score, and Best Original Song), and three Grammy Awards (Best Male Pop Vocal Performance, Best Instrumental Arrangement with Accompanying Vocals, and Best Musical Album for Children).  As you can tell, this movie is definitely a MUST SEE NOW!g\\".

B000050FEN|4.0|The story goes that during preview screenings of 'Seven' an audience member, as he was walking out midway through, punched David Fincher, in another screening the audience chanted something along the lines of, \\"Kill the director.\\"  Now I can see why this downbeat (let's face it, depressing) film could inspire that kind of reaction in people but for me it did what a horror film should.<br />Now this is definitly a horror film, not your usual detective/killer movie.  The strength of the film is in the atmospherics created by the incredible production design and cinematography.  On top of this is the way in which Fincher handles every scene with attention drawn to every bleak detail.  It carried me through the range of emotions from sadness through fear and, yes, revulsion but overall it entertained me.  Every-so-often I like to see a film like this, something which challenges me and Fincher's work is a masterpiece of the serial-killer/horror genre.<br />Those looking for a redemptive ending should maybe view Michael Mann's excellent 'Manhunter' (one of my favourite films of all-time and one which would recieve 5stars).  Those who feel that they are drowning in, \\"sick mind-trash\\" and are upset by the, \\"disturbing images dancing,\\" in their brains should do the right thing.  Turn yourself in for whatever heinous acts your neighbours dogs is asking you to commit.<br />It's just a film people but a bloody good one.

0425129616|5.0|Captain Hastings is invalided home from World War I, and while on leave comes across an old friend, John Cavendish. When Hastings is offered to stay for the duration of his leave with the Cavendish family, he immediately takes up the offer. Arriving at Styles Court, instead of having a relaxing and pleasant stay, he gets involved in a murder! The victim is Emily Inglethorpe, mother of John Cavendish, murder by poison. It is then that Hastings brings in the famous Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, a refugee from his homeland. Will the detective be able to sort through the clues, use method and order, and exercise his 'little grey cells' to bring the killer to justice?<br />This is truly one of Agatha Christie's best Poirot novel! My father, my sister, and I are the proud owners of almost all of Agatha Christie's mysteries. All of her books are just so enjoyable to read that the best atmosphere I recommend you read them in is when you're either curled up on the couch or relaxing on your bed. Very hard to put down, I can almost guarantee you won't take as long as a week to finish one book!<br />The story and plot of \\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\\" is ingenious, with lots of clues, happenings, twists and turns which never seem to come together or make sense! Agatha Christie has that writing style where she seems to be giving you everything, all of the hints and clues, but at the same keeping you in the dark, guessing and suspecting but never actually knowing. Then she gives you a finale which just leaves thinking, \\"Of course! Absolutely brilliant! That's how it happened!\\" <br />The character of Hercule Poirot has a personality all of his own. Yes, we have our Sherlock Holmes and other well known and well liked characters, but Hercule Poirot himself is a remarkable character. With his system of method and order, gathering all of the clues even the most significant ones, then putting them all together with the help of a little imagination, he is quite brilliant. Then there's Captain Hastings, so incredibly gullible that though at times you'd like to ask him whether he's keeping up with everything, you can't help but like him. <br />Then there's the array of other characters for this mystery who all seem to have a motive for murder: John Cavendish, Mary Cavendish, Alfred Inglethorpe, Evelyn Howard, Lawrence Cavendish, Cynthia Murdoch, Dorcas, and more. Everyone is under suspicion, who do you think is the murderer?<br />I recommend all of Hercule Poirot's mysteries. And besides Poirot, Agatha Christie has written stories on numerous other heroes and heroines, Miss Marple, Tommy and Tuppence, Parker Pine, and others. Other mystery writers whose work I enjoy reading are Lillian Jackson Braun and Dick Francis.<br />Also, don't miss out on any of the TV series and movies of Hercule Poirot. Starring as Poirot is David Suchet, perfect in his role! Plus, the movie, \\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\\" is on DVD!

1587990717|3.0|This is an tough book to review.  I give it 3 stars because the points he makes are valid and should be more widely understood.  Unfortunately you must wade through much rambling to find them.  He seems more interested in proving that he's as arrogant as people expect him to be than in discussing the key points at any length.  With a fairly strong background in probablility assessment and risk evaluation I was able to follow his arguments reasonably well but I suspect anyone who does not already understand probabilities and Monte Carlo modeling will not understand the points he is trying to make.  This is because the explanatory points are almost always one sentence buried in a rambling paragraph.  Our society would be better off if every citizen understood his points but I don't think this book will enlighten many people.  On a side note - I don't know what book several of the other reviewers read but it wasn't this one.  Nowhere does this book discuss specific trading strategies or approaches or taxes.  Several reviewers also clearly didn't follow the discussion.  The point of survivorship bias is not that it proves LUCK is responsible for a given individuals success in any of the many areas where it holds.  The point is that you don't KNOW the source (luck or skill) and you can't PREDICT future results.

B00003CWNR|1.0|I read the book first. It's a wonderful story, but compared to the text, the movie is didactic, the characters flat, and the whole intonation terribly false. The movie makes the orphanage to look like a kindergarten birthday party, Dr. Larch and the nurses like Sunday charity workers, and Homer Wells like a stuttering half-wit. None of this is in the book. It's a shame it got so maimed.

B00005YUPO|4.0|While the images are simplistic, and adults will quickly tire of it, this DVD has offered hours of entertainment for my daughter since her first days home.  She is captivated by the colors and movement, and I am thrilled she is being exposed to classical music in such a unique way (unlike most of us who got their first taste of classical music from Bugs Bunny cartoons).  The best part is I can put it on, put her in front of it and get some housework done while knowing she is not seeing any commercials, violence, sex or swearing.

0345440900|5.0|Like many other new mothers, I read everything I could get my hands on while I was expecting my daughter; however, I somehow managed to miss this gem until she was 3 months old.  While my daughter was already sleeping through the night (most nights), I was having difficulty understanding what she needed when she cried.  The author offers practical guidance on how to read your baby's signals to determine why she is crying.  Within one day of finishing the book, I began applying her S.L.O.W. technique and now I am much happier, and so is my daughter, because I am meeting her needs quicker and more accurately.  <br />The author is also kind to us bottle-feeding mothers.  I offer no excuses for why I am not breastfeeding, and Tracy Hogg doesn't expect me to come up with any.  <br />I highly recommend this book be read before your baby arrives.  You will be amazed at how much insight Ms. Hogg has into the minds and needs of babies.
B00005JL3A|1.0|Lame, shallow and dumb, are just a very few words I will mention to describe this movie.  This movie's is basically a bunch of speical effects strung together by a shallow story line that really does not end with any real resolution other than to look out for part 2.<br /><br />On top of that you may notice that this movie \\"samples\\"  ideas from other movies such as Andromeda Strain - compare the Hive to Andromeds's underground installation as well as the Hive's computer system to the automatic self-destruct mechanism in Andromeda Stain.  Speaking of computers, where else have you seen a computer go on a killing spree? Here's a hint 2001. Another steal was from Night Of The Living Dead where dead bodies are hijacked and commissioned to wreak havoc on the living.<br /><br />If you want a real thrill get your self the game and start playing.  You will get 10 times the substance and all of your money's worth.<br /><br />Quite frankly I do not see what is so not helpful about this.  Obviously those who did not find this helpful have no idea about the game in which this movie is supposed to be based on.  Surely it's packed with a lot of suspense and action, but it did not follow the game in anyway.  I found this movie lame and somewhat of a rip-off from other movies.
B000063S6Z|3.0|Despite the peppy, `gives you tingle,' single &quot;we are all made of stars&quot; that has received considerable airplay, and remixed, clubplay, the rest of this disk is somber and plodding indeed. Indeed the &quot;Stars&quot; opener is by far the best cut on the disk, a super slab of Bowie &quot;Heroes&quot; or &quot;Lodger&quot; album (1978-80) era minimalist synth rock, grooved up for the new Millenia; and with a profound message for sure.<br />But Moby's chipper face on the cover notwithstanding, skip quickly through the opening bars of all the songs and the down tempo, dour, sameness shines through. The disc is plagued by a similarity of beat and emotion. The beat chunks away dutifully enough, but it feels like Moby is not paying too much attention to this and is most interested in the lyrics.  The lyrics are meaningful, perhaps too meaningful as M starts to preach a bit.<br />Possibly Moby has fallen under the curse of many successful artists, taking themselves too seriously and having the urge to say profound things--meanwhile losing the focus on the music itself. And once again, Moby's use of orchestration, the dreaded strings, merely adds a fog of prog rock pomposity that sours the mood further (and even blemished \\"Play\\"). At the same time, the sound tends toward the synthetic, and soulless--Moby explores the usual blend of electro beat, techno, trip hop, house, but a grey fog envelopes the whole.<br />Technically clever? Of course. Mixed brilliantly? Of course. Does Moby have things to say? Yep. But listenable? Not really, and since that is what its all about (if not, write poetry, see: \\"Jewel\\"), three stars only. Gosh, lets hope Moby cheers up a bit and puts some energy and creative excitement back into the mix.

The only singers on both are Phillip Quast (Javert), who is always superb and Michael Ball (Marius), also wonderful. The star, Colm Wilkerson, as Valjean, is unmatched for his power, emotional depth, and vocal range. Lea Salonga makes a lyrical Eponine, and Ruthie Henshall is the perfect Fantine.<br /><br />This concert is performed before a live and enthusiastic audience. It is breathtaking and you'll never tire of listening to it.  The songs are so well-written and performed that you can truly picture the relentless Javert hunting the long-suffering Valjean across the years, the noble, but doomed, students singing of freedom, and poor Eponine dreaming of her Marius. This is an absolutely perfect cd for Les Mis devotees and those who will soon be.
0780622553|5.0|Roger Ebert named this movie the best for 1998. One aspect that never ceases to amaze me when I watch it over and over again is the use of lighting in the movie. Words can not describe its use. It's a work of art.
068484267X|5.0|Rarely do I read a book that holds me to the end like Angela's Ashes. I read a lot of the popular bestseller prizewinning fiction and this one is one of the best.  Add my 5 stars to the overall rating.  It deserves it.
0783229526|5.0|Just buy this dvd!!... From the start you just know it's gonna be weird, I mean johnny depp & benecio del toro give crazy cartoonish performances that youll talk about for days, and theres so many classic lines from johnny depp here as well, The kewl fact about this movie and a funny one too, is that they are constantly on a drug, neither of them are sober together in a single scene!!!!  Either depps on something and benecio's not, or the other way around, it's hilarious! I myself have never read the true story novel but i've heard that the movie is quite accurate to the book. This movie just has it all, weird colors , bizarre and clever camera angles that make you think maybe your on drugs like the actors, cool 60's and 70's tunes, great performances. And great hallucinating sequences. Buy it, you and your friends will be watching this almost every saturday night.
B00006472M|5.0|A wonderful movie to keep the whole family entertained.  The cast was a delight to watch, especially Bette and Sarah Jessica Parker.   I'd recommend this film to anyone with a sense of humor.
B000006045|5.0|\\"You are my angel. Come from way above. To bring me love....\\" This is how it all begins. The horror-show begins with `ANGEL', with HORACE ANDY doing the honors beginning with inviting words against a very stoic and eerie backdrop. This 6 min. 18 sec. long forerunner leads way for equally dark remaining ten songs, the conglomeration of which, make up the beautifully horrific `MEZZANINE'. After the very positive and spirited `BLUE LINES', MASSIVE ATTACK took a shift and came up with a less exuberant but equally mind-blowing, `PROTECTION'. This gradual move towards the less brighter side of affairs could only result in something as bleak as `MEZZANINE'-sensuous, enjoyably distressing and stoic.<BR>The female collaboration, with whom these fellas have been working with, is worth a look. Firstly, it was SHARA NELSON, in `BLUE LINES'. Then it was TRACEY HORN, in `PROTECTION'. With `MEZZANINE', their darkest and boldest effort to date, their female accompaniment comes from an equally strange and mysterious band, THE COCTEAU TWINS. ELIZABETH FRASER sings for THE COCTEAU TWINS and has sung / co written three songs in `MEZZANINE'. With her mellow vocals and an ambiguous style of singing, which befits THE COCTEAU TWINS' style of music, LIZ's vocals agree perfectly with the ambience of this L.P. Of  `TEARDROP', `BLACK MILK'&amp; `GROUP FOUR', FRASER's vocals sound best on the first single of the album. With just the right amount of elusiveness she entices with her soothing tone, which makes `TEARDROP', such a difficult song, not to be haunted with. <BR>The other female support to ELIZABETH is, SARA JAY. SARA sings the most frightening number of this collection of spooky tunes. `DISSOLVED GIRL', is the name of the song in concern, which starts off in the most pensive and unassuming manner. The excitement starts somewhere in the middle of its six minute timeshare, when explode this bizarre crescendo, showing off a grand display of drum, bass &amp; guitars, of the ranks of a grunge band. This affirms that MASSIVE ATTACK's realm of genius extends well beyond disco. <BR>This collection of trip-hop gems also include some very interesting samples from THE CURE, VELVET UNDERGROUND, to name a few. `MAN NEXT DOOR', which contains samples form  `10:15 SATURDAY NIGHT', by `THE CURE', eases on the eeriness a bit and is the most acceptable song of the album.<BR>If you dare to enter this haunted house, you are guaranteed of a hair-raising experience, which will make you enter it again, once you've come out of it.
B000009QPG|5.0|Coming off the classics \\"Reign in Blood\\" and \\"South of Heaven,\\" Slayer continued their evolution with \\"Seasons in the Abyss.\\"  This album is perhaps their most mature, combining the speed and aggression of \\"Reign\\" with the more polished approach of \\"South.\\"  Yet somehow, it managed to be both heavier and more melodic than its predecessors.  The production is clear, the songwriting's diverse, and Hanneman and King turned in a performance that cemented their place among the best metal guitar duos.  And it's also worth noting that on his last album for the band, Dave Lombardo turned in a drum performance for the ages, with precision and variety that was just mindblowing.<br />The album fires out of the gate with the blazing \\"War Ensemble,\\" which combines crushingly heavy riffing with a tempo that is fast even by Slayer standards.  I like a lot of Slayer songs, but I'd have to say \\"War Ensemble\\" is in my top three.  From there, the band changes things up a bit.  The excellent \\"Spirit in Black\\" and \\"Born of Fire\\" are roaring speed-metal songs in the vein of the opener, but tunes like \\"Blood Red\\" and \\"Dead Skin Mask\\" slow things down to good effect.  The closing title track is a great six-plus minute epic, with a terrific intro and some very haunting melodies.  Tom's vocals are in my opionion at their best on this album, as he manages to occasionally do something that resembles singing without losing any of his edge.  His vocals on \\"Dead Skin Mask\\" and the title track, especially, have a very eerie tone that suits the music perfectly.  For fans of the older Slayer, though, there's plenty of good growling too.<br />Lyrically, the band also showed some signs of branching out, continuing the trend started on \\"South.\\"  The death-and-Satan approach of Slayer's first three albums could be seen giving way to a focus on evil in general.  \\"War Ensemble\\" and \\"Blood Red\\" intelligently address the destructive nature of violence and war; \\"Indication of triumph/the numbers that are dead\\" from \\"War Ensemble\\" remains one of my all-time favorite lyrics.  \\"Dead Skin Mask\\" deals with the crimes of infamous killer Ed Gein, while \\"Expendable Youth\\" talks about the problem of inner-city violence.  In other songs the message isn't so clear, but the lyrical content is at all times dark and oppressive, just like everything else on the album.  If you don't have this album, you're missing out on an essential piece of one of metal's defining bands.d\\" from \\"War Ensemble\\" remains one of my all-time favorite lyrics.  \\"Dead Skin Mask\\" deals with the crimes of infamous killer Ed Gein, while \\"Expendable Youth\\" talks about the problem of inner-city violence.

0312265859|2.0|Okay now... this is such a sad moment.<BR>I own all 8 Stephanie Plum books and have to say this may be the last one I have purchased.The only thing that may change my mind is that I am  a romantic and would like to know what happens between Joe and Stephanie.<BR>But other then that.. BORING.<BR>I don't buy a hardcover book to read in the first 30 pages about the lead character only. Stephanie's unabilities to live life, over and over and over and over again.<BR>A big let down also was how she handled the Stephanie and Ranger part. Come on, she constantly tells us what a hunk he is and so on and then she turns him into this cardboard man? His line is \\" I have feelings for you\\".. ja, no kidding.The man kills someone for Steph and always watches out for her, there is more then chemistry and feelings and that is what he gets? Even if it is not her intention for them to be together. This was lame.    <BR>I understand she doesn't want to write those cliche scenes anymore, but she doesn't have to. Ranger deserves better. That wasn't handled well at all. Joe was the only one in this book that came across better and stronger. I am wearing tired of characters like the atterney Klowne and even Lulu up to a degree, who just seem to waltz all over the story and Stephanie.<BR>Can you believe I was actually tempted to skip pages? It has come to the point that you can be blindfolded and predict what is written on the pages.<BR>She should have stopped at #5 or maybe #6, when she was ahead of the game. She is not advancing the characters at all and it  is starting to become boring. I have great respect for her work and know how hard it is to write in the first persons point of view.<BR>It will sell and satisfy her, but I do think she would also appreciate an honest opinion that tells her it is time.The story was okay. Didn't grib me, but again, I do give her credit for trying something new. That Steph was doing something ,not for the money, but because people that she knew may be indanger.<br />And come on.. the whole thing for a medal that could have belonged to Napoleon at one point? She couldn't come up with something better then that?<BR>Of course I love when Steph and Morrelli are together. That was the good part of the whole book.<BR>I hope she will really take her time and think what she will do for and with the next one. This is not working for me anymore.<BR>Anyone that wants to read this story, should start with One for the money. That is a good book and example of what she is capable off and we can expect of her... <br />Time to make a decision. Either come to an end or let them advance a bit.<BR>Thanks.
B00000099Y|5.0|Powerful stuff.  You really have to read the lyrics to appreciate the full force of Maynard's \\"message\\" but I think a lot of people get him, while others just hear the swearing and negative \\"vibes\\".  DOn't go in here looking for more \\"Sober\\" and \\"Prison Sex\\". If you do, with the exception of \\"Stinkfist\\", I think you'll be largely disappointed.   Open minds will love this album.
B000068OCS|5.0|This is a film that needs to be absorbed in its entirety to be fully enjoyed. The music and images blend together to create a mood and sets the film into motion.  In our sound bite society most of us can't tolerate waiting 15 minutes to begin understanding a film...but if you are there are hidden treasures in the world.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I love their new album! At first I was a little hesitant because I was so hooked on Make Yourself and SCIENCE, but after a few listens I knew I was back in INCUBUS territory. Their album is just as great if not better than their previous albums. I get a kick out of words in opening song \\"Nice to Know YouE Pins and needles Enice to know you EGOOD BYE!EI can't get it out of my head. Living in Tokyo, it perfectly describes the attitude of some Japanese folks when they meet a foreigner like myself!
B000001FBS|1.0|Tell me this is a joke!!<BR>We are suppose to take these guys as serious musicians?<BR>Maybe the replacements for Ace,and Peter Criss were talented..But this stuff is if anything of any value, a good laugh at a really bad \\"concept\\" album.<br />No wonder they went back to the Sex, Drugs and Rock n' Roll<br />2 Thumbs down for the lyrics
B000002MTR|5.0|This is an entirely different album than others by THE RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS.It has alot of good songs in it except Warped ,but it's growing on me.If your a new fan of the peppers,i suggest buying californication,Blood Sugar...  first.Then,if you enjoy both albums,i highly recommand this one.You won't be disappointed.
B000002UAU|1.0|I do not understand how this album can be considered amazing. It has been declared an eclectic rock masterpiece, a statement which is simply not true. It was supposedly revolutionary because it was \\"the first concept album.\\"  It also contained the spooky, thought provoking ending found in \\"A Day in the Life\\".  To each his own, I suppose.  <br />The title track is surprisingly adequate; it is one of best songs by The Beatles (which is not saying much).  The second track is \\"With a Little Help from my Friends\\".  It, like most other songs from this album, is entertaining for one or two listens at best.  Then comes the random babbling entitled \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\".  \\"Getting Better\\" and \\"Fixing a Hole\\" are more of this senseless garbage,only these include chiming guitars.  There's more cliché material, found in the saccharine \\"She's Leaving Home\\".  Then comes yet another pointless throwaway, \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\\".<br />\\"Within You Without You\\" is another one of those unoriginal, interminable songs by George Harrison.  \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\", \\"Lovely Rita\\", and \\"Good Morning Good Morning\\" more of the stale pop lyrics that The Beatles were so often praised for. We have a brief moment of coherence again with the reprise of the title track.  Then comes \\"A Day in the Life\\".  Somehow this song's ending is supposed to be genius.  Hmm, seems like more pointless noisemaking to me.<br />If this is the cultural revolution that everyone has talked about, then I now know why most pop/rock music stinks today.  If one does not like this review, that is fine.  As many of you apparently know, there is a Not Helpful button that one can press.
B00004Z459|5.0|This is definately one great album. But be warned, this CD isn't for everyone. I like it, you may not. Sample some of the songs here, if they sound good to you, definately buy it, it won't dissapoint you.
B000002HPT|4.0|This is my least favorite of their modern albums.  A self-described attempt at mainstream success, DT keeps the virtuosity but simplifies the form and intensity on most of the tracks here.  There are a few exceptions, such as the oddly accessible Burning My Soul and the haunting New Millenium, a popular concert opener for them nowadays.  For the most part, DT abandons the usual mania of their compositions in favor of a heavy and disappointingly ordinary sounding CD.  Don't get me wrong -- ballads such as Anna Lee are heartbreakingly beautiful with atmospheric piano playing beyond expectations, and epics like Lines In the Sand feature fantastic heavy riff-driven guitar and drum lines that will stay with you forever.  But, be forewarned, if Scenes From A Memory, Awake, and Six Degrees are what you're looking for in this album, look away.  As always with Dream Theater, the album is exquisitely musical in every second of every track.  For the most part though, it does not live up to the lofty standards set by their other albums in technicality, subject matter, or sheer enjoyment.  The album has gathered dust over the past few years in my CD case, whereas the other three mentioned above are in constant rotation.
0380018179|3.0|I've read all of Colleen's Masters of Rome series and thought they were great but found this one to be a disappointment. I had to struggle to even finish the book which I found to be sappy and superficial compared to her fairly hard-boiled and intricately detailed politico-military portrayal of Rome. I admit I am no fan of romances, but I believe her writing skills have improved considerably in her later books.
B000068TPN|5.0|As a veteran who served in the military for 35 years as well as a military history buff, I found this DVD to be the best that I have yet seen on the Vietnam War.A wonderful moving account of the men who had to fight on the ground with little understanding of the situation by the brass behind the desks. I think that this movie should be required viewing on leadership principles in the military, much as \\"12 O'Clock High\\" was some 20 years ago.<br />A terrific movie... and splendid acting by Mel Gibson.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|After adding my five stars to the well-written reviews above, I'd just like to point out one interesting undocumented special feature of the DVD version. After thoroughly enjoying the movie twice as presented, using the chapter select feature I watched it once more--backwards (which is, in effect, forwards)! :)
B00005Q3TZ|1.0|are the only reason for buying this &quot;Director's Cut&quot;.  The movie is still a stinker.  &quot;Tora, Tora, Tora&quot; did a much better job.  This would've been a much better movie if most of the love story were cut out.  And the movie should've ended with the attack.  Too much of a bad thing!
B00005JKZ3|1.0|THE STORY: Evil Aliens, lead by Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle)are looking for something that would help them to destroy Earth. The MIB need to stop 'em and Agent Jay (Will SMith) is assigned. But the only one who can help is former MIB Agent and partner Kay (Tommy Lee Jones), who has been deneuralised and works at a postal office. So now Jay must tell him about his past in order to fight Serleena and save the planet.<br />THE CAST: Will Smith and Tommy-Lee Jones definately had chemistry in the first part but in this one I couldn't help feeling they had been forced to act because they seem rather stiff and do not interact as great as they did 5 years ago. The supporting cast has little to do because they all have so underwritten parts no really cares about them. Especially annoying: Johnny Noxville with two heads and nothing but worn out gags...<br />THE FILM: I've seen lots of stuff that was supposed to be funny and wasn't but this one really takes the cake. Not only does it replicate the story of the original, it makes the big sequel mistakes and tries to put in as many effects as it can, making it more like a child's birthday than a movie. Sure the effects people does create cool alien but in MIIB it was just too much. Stylisticly the sequel has the same cold look as the original. Just as pretty much everything is the same, only without any energy. Then there's the running time of 88 minutes, which means, we only get about 40 minutes of Tommy Lee Jones, which is far too little. IT's just that I can't find anything good about this movie except the music by Danny Elfman and the Aliens in the locker but they're not really worth sitting through this stale film. It's not that I regret having seen this one but I was stunned how many unoriginal ideas a screenwriter can pack into 88 minutes of film.
0440180295|5.0|This book is mostly inspire by Vonnegut himself and his experiences in Dresden in the 1940s. The bombing, the friends he lost, the confusion and mental turmoil he experienced after the war.. the whole book was very crystal clear. It's very personal and moving for a story written in the third person. It was unusual for Vonnegut to do that because most of his books I have read were written in the first person. Billy Pilgrim's transition from reality to imagination are very adequate and plausible, and gave a very real, yet isolated take of life during such a terrible war. It also documents the dehumanization of the atrocities of war, since death doesn't seem to have an effect on Pilgrim, but you can tell that he does have feelings, but the war kind of took away all the feelings that really mattered to him. I've always been a pacifist and had a strong anti-military stance, but this only enhances my perspective. Most war novels and movies usually glorify the fighting the the atrocities done to both soldiers and civilians, only adding to the concept of dehumanization, but the sensitivity of its characters, especially Pilgrim, the protagonist (though not lucid, but still evident) makes it a very different military novel from a very different writer.

630281474X|5.0|Classic Hammer Films version of the famous vampire story. The film is notable for several reasons. Christopher Lee makes his first appearance as Dracula, his most famous role. Unlike Bela Lugosi's sense of tragic mystery, Lee stresses the vampire's delight in his unholy lusts. Lust is the key word. The late-Victorian era novel dealt only indirectly with sex. This movie has a definite erotic tone that is a Hammer tradition. For 1958, this was sexy stuff. Prim and proper women wantonly seek the vampire's kiss. The penetration is of the fangs in the neck variety, but we get the idea. Peter Cushing is Van Helsing, the vampire slayer. The brilliant casting of Cushing and Lee as adversaries became familiar fare in many subsequent horror flicks. The final battle between Dracula and Van Helsing in Dracula's castle is one of the great moments in vampire cinema. Lee's towering, menacing figure in the flowing black cape dominates the film. Lee's dialogue is minimal, but he projects more danger with icy stares than most actors accomplish with reams of discourse. When bloodlust rages, he is feral and overpowering. The characters are based on Bram Stoker's work, but the story unfolds in a way uniquely its own. One minor note: the obvious British accents of the supporting cast provokes unintended chuckles as they portray central European innkeepers and domestics. Little Tania is a special hoot. This is a great example of the way they used to make horror movies before the onslaught of insane killers stalking teenagers in a theater near you. Collectors building a library of Classic Horror 101 certainly need this one. ;-)
B00005JKDR|5.0|Most of us agree this is an excellent film - but how does the DVD rate? This 2-disc set has as many extras as some monsters have arms....or tentacles as the case may be.  The supplemental DVD is chock full of entertainment - for both kids, adults, and film fanatics.<br />          The team at Pixar created a wonderful way to explore the extras included here. At the main menu one is given 2 doors from which to choose, either one can take the Human Door to the left or the Monster Door to the right. Basically the Human Door includes your typical DVD bonus materials and is geared more towards adults. The right door brings you into the Monsters Inc. main building and is a wonderful extra for kids and the young at heart out there. <br />BONUS MATERIAL HIGHLIGHTS:<br />             MIKES NEW CAR SHORT:  One of the best extras included on this DVD include the new Mikes New Car animated short.  It is a hilarious short that involves Mike showing off his new \\"6 wheel drive\\" car to Sully.  It definitely met my high expectations of a Pixar short.<br />             FOR THE BIRDS SHORT:  This is the Academy Award winner for Best Animated Short Film of 2001 from the creators at Pixar.  The looks the birds give each other in this short are great, and this animation is definitely worthy of the award it has received. I was very pleased to see this included on the DVD.<br />            GUIDE TO IN-JOKES: This is an example of the greatness of this DVD. Most kids are not going to read through these - but adults were kept in mind in the making of these bonus materials. This guide describes and shows you over 20 in-jokes included in the movie.<br />          FUN FACTORY TOUR OF PIXAR:  I found the tour through the new studios very worth the time watching it.  This is not the boring tour of a building - it is obvious the people at Pixar have fun at their jobs. Not only do the creators give you the grand tour, but also a chimpanzee comes along for the ride. Check out the paper airplane flipping around when you find it in your exploration of this DVD - it leads to a funny Easter egg.<br />           SOUND EFFECT OPTIONS:  There were 2 things relating to sound that I think are great additions to this collection. The first involves being able to listen to just the sound effects for the length of the entire movie. A great option for those really into sound. Another cool effect is included - a binaural recording. Plug in some headphones to your TV and listen as Billy Crystal and John Goodman demonstrate a really great sound system.<br />           MONSTER SECTION FOR KIDS:  I loved the fact that one can pick which direction they want to head on this DVD. Walk through the Monster Door and the kids can find everything they want to know about how to become a monster, and they can play a few games along the way. Even the littlest of kids will enjoy the simple games awaiting them in the Monsters Inc. Headquarters. Oh - and listening to the teen-cracking voice of Needleman reading off stats and \\"cards\\" of each monster is hilarious.<br />Other Highlights include : Trailers and TV spots, International language section, a TV clip reel (which Mike and Sully introduce Monday Night Football and some holiday gags), Monster Files, Release Materials, Music Video, and much more! Also included is a Trailer for the upcoming Pixar film Finding Nemo.<br />             This is a DVD definitely worth the price.

0671024256|5.0|You don't necessarily get a glimpse into the bag of tricks King delves into to find ideas for his books, but you do gain insight into his thought process during the various stages of creation.  Many books on writing address the subject as dryly as a coroner would an autopsy, and to me, that's their greatest failure.  You can't craft a guidebook on a creative form of expression as if it were an instruction manual for a VCR.  <br />What King does here is different.  He provides a rough sketch of what the process of writing should be and leaves it to the reader (and hopefully, future writer) to fill in the details.  Writing after all, is a highly subjective and personal process.  King doesn't presume to dictate that there's only one way to do it.  <br />What he does convey, however, is that writing is a craft to be taken seriously, and as such, is to be considered a form of labor.  For him and ideally, for any aspiring writer, writing will be a labor of love, but King clearly imparts on the reader that a lot of sweat will and should go into crafting stories.<br />An added bonus to this book are the brief anecdotes King provides about his accident and his recovery that followed.  It's important to note that even for a writer as gifted and prolific as King, he never fell into the cliche of saying that writing saved his life or even speeded his recovery.  In fact, King mentions how difficult it was to create and write when just weeks prior, he had done so with very little effort.  It's important for aspiring writers to see the craft in an unromanticized light, and to see that it's hard for even the best of writers at times.  That, and that it's worthwhile to keep working at it.<br />For anyone curious at all about the writing process, this book is a delightful read.
B00005JKDR|3.0|I can't seem to win nowadays with what Hollywood is putting out for the kids... I bought this dvd for my four and a half year old son and it scared him so much that he cried!  Great movie and animation and everything - I mean, I really enjoyed it - but I didn't think a rated &quot;G&quot; movie would bring my son to tears!  Apart from the scary stuff, what's up with the hitting and punching and beating each other up?  What are they trying to do?  It just makes me so mad when I can't even sit and enjoy a CARTOON without having to explain what's happening with all the violence!  I think they need to change the &quot;G&quot; rating to &quot;PG&quot; or something more defined like &quot;G-7&quot;.  Great movie, but if you have little ones, don't buy it!
B00006AL1G|5.0|ANYONE WHO LOVES MUSIC SHOULD OWN THIS DVD !!!  THE DEDICATION OF THESE DJ'S IS INCREDIBLE.... GREAT LIFE LESSON...  THE SECTION ON THE DVD WITH PRODUCER AND DIRECTOR IS AN EXPERIENCE IN ITS SELF... THE DJ'S SCRATCHING LESSON IS THE BEST....
B000002AZ8|4.0|My mom got this CD when it first came out because she liked &quot;better man&quot; which is an awsome song, but my mom wasn't expecting the hard guitar chords found in songs like Spin the Black Circle, Whipping, and Last Exit which are some of the better songs on the cd. Nothingman made me think about what I thought about myself and all the things that I take for granted; truly a beautiful song. Courdoury, a very popular song, the crisp, clean, chords of the chorus send shrills down my spine. This CD would have gotten 5 strong stars if they would not have included the songs like Pry to, or stupid mop, which are what i think do not belong on such a perfect cd. Bugs displays pearl jam's more comic side with a goofy tune- it just fits. <br />This may be one of pearl jams more original works, one that may not appeal to the &quot;ten&quot; fans who like the more clean-cut hits. This cd displays just great rock'n roll.
0783225903|2.0|This film is silly, and the plot is incoherent. Some people actually take this film seriously, but if anything it's a comedy. Unfortunately, it's not that funny.
B00003CXXO|3.0|A.I. is one of the most unpleasant and depressing movies I've ever seen. Haley Joel Osment is so talented it's astonishing  He's the best and only thing to watch in the movie but even he is not enough. There are numerous plot/logic holes but heres one: David, I presume cost a lot of money to make. So, how come his &quot;father's&quot; employers didn't move heaven and earth to get him back when his &quot;mother&quot; abandons him? <br />The ending is so manipulative it's offensive. We have no way of knowing what Kubrick would've done with A.I. and frankly, if half the stories about his treatment of actors are true it's better for Haley Joel Osment that Kubrick didn't make the flick but this is definitely NOT Speilberg's finest hour. For all the special effects (the aliens from Close Encounters are back) there is a cheesiness about this movie that I just couldn't get past.
078322608X|5.0|this movie in my oppinion is a masterpiece, I think everything is said about this movie and i do not need to repeat them. You might need to watch it more than once to apriciate it and also apriciate the exellent directing and acting. Musics are also great, Especially the violin piece at the end. the movie combines Science fiction and romance at some point at least thats what i felt. Buy this DVD now, it also has some exiting extras including a very long \\"making of\\" and some still photographs. The DVD has an exellent sound and video quality.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen recently. <br />The movie revolves around John Nash - the Nobel Prize Laureate on Mathematics - and his unique problem, Schizophrenia. John is a genius, in fact, egoistical genius, and he cannot lose on his passion Mathematics. In an environment of smart people around, John is finding himself difficult to identify but believe it, he is an extraordinary genius. He could decrypt complex patterns in no time. Unfortunately there are a couple of more fictitious people he has too - a good friend, who listens to him, motivates him and guides him (Charles), Charles' niece (Marcee) and a CIA Agent (William Parcher) - owing to his problem and he creates his own world for them and lives with them. <br />The director has pointed out one thing clearly - most of the psychological problems can be cured more by the self than any medication. John realizing that Marcee is not growing with age is a wonderful scene to exemplify this. The drugs do not help him recover from his problems and the trouble John faces is portrayed very nicely. To his support is his wife Alicia. Russel Crowe has given his best performance even though he over-acted in couple of instances.<br />Overall, a good movie worth watching. Highly recommend.
B00006F2TV|4.0|As a stand alone movie, the movie is a good action movie with elements of romance and class struggle tossed in, but not to the point the movie becomes \\"depressing\\" or utterly dramatic to the point you forget its an action movie. Like some of the reviewers before me, I realized when I bought my ticket what kind of movie I was in for, and actually it turned out better than the Batman, Superman and Spawn movies combined.<br />For one thing its Spiderman, and so it goes and looks on screen as close to any comic book adaptation should get to looking like...well a comic. The action is similar to the old comic book and cartoons and the characters don't get utterly ridiculous like they did in all the batman sequels. If you like action movies or dig comics than this movie is a blast.
B00006FXB6|5.0|QOTSA's new album, Songs for the deaf, gives new reason for one to be excited about rock.  The album demonstrates awesome ability by the musicians and a series of well composed songs.
B000002G7E|3.0|White Light/White Heat, despite some stellar moments is The Velvets' weakest album. The extreme noise and feedback that started on the last two tracks of the debut is overdone here. Legend has it that this record was recorded rather quickly as a follow up, possibly they just didn't have enough tunes; leaving &quot;Sister Ray&quot;, all 17 plus minutes as the bulk of side two; although that is more like an abreviated version with the band sometimes stretching it 30 minutes plus in live shows.The title track is a classic,but recorded so poorly here that it sounds as if it came from a bootleg. John Cale is more prominent  vocally on &quot;The Gift&quot; (some humor for a change too)and on &quot;Lady Godiva's Operation&quot; than he was on the debut.&quot;Heard Her Call My Name&quot; has a great chorus hook amidst the feedback squawk.The next two albums were more listenable and focused, at least for my taste.
0790736039|4.0|I remember when I was in high school almost everybody was reading books from Stephen King, so I give it a try.  Since I was scare of clown as a kid clown still give me the creep lol, I red the book \\"IT\\" just the first one of the serie, it was kind of a big book and not really my type of reading, I think Stephen King wrote too much about no important things in his book but I sill found the book very good and the atmosphere in it was great, it was creepy and give me the chill.When I knew about the movie \\"IT\\" I want to see it, I finally got the chance to see it and it was very good, very smilar to the book, the same atmosphere.  It's rare that a movie is as similar to a book, usually the turn out always bad but this time the movie \\"IT\\" was very close to the book of King and the movie is great but still a movie cannot always be as good as the book because in a book they can go deeper and get more details and in the movie they don't have time for that, that's why movie are not as good as the book.  If you are a fan of King you will love this movie and if you are not but love horror movie well your going to love it too.
0896762173|5.0|Until this book dissapeared from my local library I must have borrowed it for over half its shelf life there, in all of 15 years this book has been THE reference for me, no mean feat to hold my attention since I was 11. <BR>I love it because of the minute detail of the fabric patterns which although hard to find today similar items can be found for those wanting to recreate the dresses. <BR>The value for money is unreproachable, you just have to buy this book. Thank the publishers for reprinting in the U.S and here in U.K !
B00004Z459|5.0|Hybrid Theory is an awesome cd! ... the only song I could bear to listen to was In The End because it's the only smooth and easy listening song. Then after awhile I gradually started listening to the first couple of tracks and then well I fell in love with it. The members of Linkin Park seem to mix emotions and love in their songs and they come out with some funky ...  song which is great to listen to. When I'm really mad it's real soothing to listen to them belch out their guitars, the pounding drums, and awesome little techno whatever sound effects. The lead singers Chester (the vocal like normal singing guy) and Mike (the rapper dawg) come together to make awesome songs. Ok this review is getting long. My favorite song is Runaway, One Step Closer, and of course the Classic- In The End. ....OK well YOU MUST BUY LINKIN PARK HYBRID THEORY!!!! and if you like it, buy Reanimation..but make sure u buy Hybrid Theory before you buy Reanimation...
6305531412|5.0|WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT? is a highpoint in cinema history with its seemless combination of live action and animation. It is probably THE film that ushered in a rennaissance of animation back to filmaking and reintroduced some classic cartoon characters to the filmgoing public. Too bad there was nothing special done with the DVD release.  There is nothing here except the film and little else.  Perhaps the studio is going to release an anniversary special edition because it is currently not available. In any case, the film itself receives 5 stars because of story, direction, acting, and technical merits.  However, the DVD itself receives zero stars because there are no bells and whistles. Great performance from Bob Hoskins as Private Eye Eddie Valiant who is hired by an animation studio head boss, R.K. Maroon of Maroon Studios, to tail the wife of their biggest star Roger Rabbit and stumbles upon a murder mystery and a plot to destroy Toonsville where all animated characters live.  Great supporting cast with the late Stubby Kaye (GUYS AND DOLLS), Joanna Cassidy, Christopher Lloyed, and voice work from Kathleen Turner as Jessica Rabbit, and Charles Fleischer as Roger Rabbit.  Then,of course, the appearance of all those famous cartoon characters from every major studio of the era in the same film was magic in itself!! (Bugs Bunny, Micky Mouse, Daffy Duck, Donald Duck, Dumbo, Droopy, Betty Boop etc.. - - suspiciously missing Tom and Jerry?)
B00000F1D3|3.0|I like the song believe on this cd. That is the main reason that I purchased it.  The bad thing is, I don't think she would sound that good if it weren't for the electronic voice sound effects.  After awhile the voice enhancer gets to be a little old.  Of course if you can change the sound of your voice and it keeps you in the music industry more power to you.
B0000009SY|4.0|Zappa fanatics already own this and newish Zappa fans already have it on their \\"Wish List,\\" so I'll direct this review to any Zappa newcomers, cork sniffers, or plain ole curious types.<br />Like most Zappa albums, this album is a mixture of some deadly serious & artsy genre-bending jazz/rock/fusion music and some silly and crude \\"humor music.\\"  To be honest, Zappa makes the listener really work as there are occasionally irritating moments on the record (\\"Sy Borg\\"), some VERY profane moments (\\"Keep It Greasy\\"), some catchy stuff (\\"Joe's Garage\\" and \\"Why Does it Hurt When I Pee\\") and some downright beautiful stuff (\\"Watermelon In Easter Hay\\").<br />I think Zappa fans fall into about four groups:<br />1)  Fanatics who think every recorded moment is brilliant<br />2)  Those who prefer the silliness and weird lyrical content, but aren't so big on the extended instrumental noodlings.<br />3)  Those who prefer the extended instrumental noodlings, but aren't so big on the silliness and weird lyrical content.<br />4)  The curious who buy a few albums, never quite find the hook, and loose enthusiasm.<br />Be advised that if you fall into group 2 or 3, Zappa is VERY DEMANDING.  He makes very little effort to be approachable, has no qualms about indulging a melody or an idea and is sometimes intentionally grating and anti-aesthetic.  This album is no exception.  I think it starts off very well, has some of his best songs in \\"Joe's Garage,\\" \\"Why Does it Hurt . . . ,\\" \\"Packard Goose\\" and \\"Watermelon . . .\\"  I also think it drags a bit in the middle and that some of the \\"humor\\" is almost too crude at times.   I'm no prude at all; but . . . well . . . one has to be in a certain mood to revisit some of the more explicit moments.<br />Still, in summary, I think this is in the top handful of Zappa's Post-Mother's work.  It's an incredibly ambitious work that rewards a dedicated listener with something new on each repeated listen.  Though parts of it drag a little, it's still an amazing and very adventurous work.
0380789035|2.0|American Gods could have been an interesting book about the journey of one man into the ancient and powerful.  At the same time, it could have been a humorous commentary on the American lifestyle.  Over a wide variety of colorful characters, it could have been a unique and informative illustration of many cultures' beliefs and folklore.<br />Unfortunately for the reader, it is none of these things.  Instead it is a long meaningless treck.  The &quot;gods&quot; are all the same character with different accents and vocabularies, and spout the same cryptic messages intended to add mystery to an obvious plot.  However, the schlock mysticism can barely paste over the thin plot and the reader is always ten steps ahead of the protagonist.  The novel is not slow-paced, as some readers have claimed, but is merely bland.  This is a book full of could-have-beens.<br />There are a few good points.  The writing is clear-headed, and some might appreciate the comic-bookish framing and pacing of the scenes.  The Wednesday character is likable for a good portion of the book after his cliche introduction, as is the protagonist's wife when she isn't speaking as a self-help guru.  The story is pretty well balanced, there's just not much too it.  Overall the book is a fine beach read, but don't expect any deep meaning, or to learn anything.
0316666343|3.0|It's the kind of story that draws you into it with a struggle because of the subject matter.  Just when you thought that the world wasn't so bad, Sebold reminds you of life's everyday realities.  All of her characters have depth and are so well-developed that their shortcomings were believable.  I just hope that most police departments aren't so inept.
B000002WU9|5.0|I've been a Wu-lover since day one. After almost ten years of extensive listening, I cannot help concluding that this is the best Wu-affiliated album out there. I have found myself coming back to this one again and again; it has a certain deeper value to it unfound in most hip-hop today. This is one of the rare albums you might dislike at first, but it gets better every time you hear it. If you want to experience what Wu is really all about, go get this album NOW and find out what a deep, intense musical masterpiece this album really is. A heavyweight y'all.
B00005OAIE|3.0|I bought this CD because &quot;No Such Thing,&quot; heard on &quot;Smallville,&quot; is a very catchy tune.  The rest of the CD is just like that...smooth, catchy, totally unoffensive.  During the second listen, I realized what it sounds like:  Michael Franks.  It's Michael Franks for those born after 1980.<br />Maybe not as jazz influenced, and definitly not as interesting lyrically (although Franks has way too many songs telling us what love is) but satisfying, nonetheless.  A nice CD your mom won't mind listening to when you're in the car together.
0446608955|4.0|I have to say this about &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot;:  This book is cheesy, sappy, obvious, and totally predictable.<br />But I still loved it.<br />Call me a hopeless romantic, but this book is really wonderful.  The story of Landon Carter and Jamie Sullivan reinforced the ideas (that I always believed):  That young people can know what true love is if they put their minds to it.  That love does not have to be complicated but can be simple and sweet.  Love does not have to be (and really shouldn't be) about physical attraction.  If you have postive experiences with another person that you love, those happy times will never leave you for the rest of your life, no matter what happens.<br />This book isn't for everyone, but if you don't mind a bit of sap in a sweet and simple romance then I recommend this for you.
B000002LCU|4.0|When this album came out, it was significant for a number of reasons.  First, it showed that George was alive and well and still capable of capturing the old magic... it lost none of the classic Harrison wit that was so evident on his previous work...  I personally like \\"Wreck of the Hesperus\\", \\"Just For Today\\", and of course, \\"When We Was Fab\\".  Listening to this album, it's much harder to believe that George is gone.
B000002U82|5.0|It's my favourite in absolute... it has all.<BR>Sweetness and anger, melody and rhytm, surrealism and cold sarcasm. You can listen it in every moment of your life, but is perfect for relaxing and reflecting.
B000006ZDQ|5.0|There is no denying all the Sabbath albums with Ozzy on are great, But so is this album with Ronnie James Dio. We all hated to see Ozzy go at the time, but now I am glad he did. We fans got a bunch of super good albums out of Sabbath and Ozzy's divorce. \\"Blizzard of Ozz\\", Diary of a Madman\\", \\"Heaven and Hell\\", and Mob Rules, are all some of the best albums ever written. The songs are all upbeat and rockin. I love the bass on this album. Geezer is in top form. My favorite songs are \\"Neon Nights\\", \\"Walk Away\\", \\"Lady Evil\\", and \\"Children of the Sea.\\" Dio and Sabbath a match made in \\"Heaven and Hell\\"...
B0000683DH|3.0|I was so looking forward to this dvd. But I was very disappointed<BR>when I finally got this dvd. The parts they added were the ones<BR>they put in the version that put in the version they showed on T.V. So if you already have a copy of this movie on dvd don't<BR>buy this. But if you don't already have a regular copy,then buy<BR>this version. It is a marginally better than the first version.<BR>The special features on disc-2 are ok but not great but interesting.
B00006EXDM|5.0|Tired of buying CD's that claim to be &quot;remastered&quot; only to bring them home and not be able to tell them apart from the original?  You won't be disappointed here.<br />The Stones CD's of their 60's material were some of the most poorly mastered in history.  The original Hot Rocks disc from 1986 is full of tape glitches, pops, hiss, and songs mastered at the wrong speed.  Finally, justice has been served.  This newly upgraded version blows away the original, fixing all the above-mentioned problems and then some.  Even the most untrained ear will easily notice the vast improved sound quality.<br />And to those complaining about certain songs like &quot;Satisfaction&quot; and &quot;Get Off My Cloud&quot; not being in stereo...have you actually HEARD those versions?  They stink!  &quot;Satisfaction&quot; is sped WAY up and the wide stereo effect on both songs (drums in one speaker, etc) gives them less &quot;punch.&quot;  <br />Hooray to ABKCO records.  They got it right this time.
B000069HKH|5.0|This is as good as it gets.  I am mildy amused at some of the reviews longing for another &quot;Born To Run&quot; or &quot;Darkness On The Edge Of Town&quot;, etc.  The essence of life is change.  Times change, people change.  Neither the world nor The Boss are the same as they were 25 years ago.  Bruce is now writing and singing more from the perspective of the 50 year old man that he is.  The sound is basically the same with a few wrinkles thrown in (by the way, it so nice to have the E Street Band back!).  The voice is the same.  The songs are great.  The emotion runs deep.  &quot;Into The Fire&quot; actually got me a bit misty-eyed recalling 9/11/01 and the heroes who sacrificed - and that is not easy to do.  Don't expect a rock and roll classic like &quot;Thunder Road&quot; on this disc.  Do expect to be thoroughly impressed!!  Beats the heck out NSYNC and Britney :o)
0780624890|5.0|1998 had several scifi action flicks as I recall one was not that great this one was called &quot;Spawn&quot;.  But this review is not about Spawn but rather the dimond in the rock action movie that is &quot;Blade&quot;.  This movie has a lot of great feautres that other scifi action thirllers lack(such as a plot).  <br />In all my days upon this planet I never expected that Snipes and  Kris Kristofferson would make such a great team!!  If you haven't seen this movie already go ahead and rent it(or preferably buy it!!)
B00005JKHP|5.0|This version is much better than the original version that was<BR>released back in 1979. If the studio had given Robert Wise the<BR>time to finish this movie properly this directors edition would've never been. He really did an excellent job reediting<BR>this movie.The editions that were made have made a big differance. So buy this DVD now!!!!
B00006AW2O|5.0|This is the remastered super audio CDs (SACD) of the Stones ABCKO catalog (which includes all the early Decca/London material.  ABCKO acquired the Stones' catalog after Allen Klein became their manager in 1965.  The legal battles during the 70s produced releases that the Stones opposed (they took out full page adds asking fans not to buy them), including the controversial Metamorphosis releases (which are now available on CD for the 1st time ever).  But the sad fact is that the Stones lost control of their great early material.  With these remastered SACD releases, we at last have some idea of what they really sounded like in the studio.  I guess if we had these 40 years ago they would have ended up Greatest Rock And Roll Band in the Universe instead of just our tiny little World.<br />This is the Stones 2nd US album, released Oct 23, 1964. It cemented the early blues band legend with tracks from their famous Chess Studios session in Chicago during the 1st American tour (Muddy Waters helped carry their gear into the studio) and tracks recorded at Regent Sound in London.   Essentially, this is the album that finalized their status as champions of Chicago blues.<br />The album starts with Check Berry's Around And Around, which the Stones had been doing as a show stopper in the UK, the big hits Time Is On My Side and It's All Over Now, and the great slow blues numbers Confessin' The Blues & Good Times Bad Times. Although they used to do a lot of  instrumentals, 2120 S. Michigan seems to have survived as the only memory of this part of the  early Stones familiar to most fans. Personally I always liked Congratulations, but never cared for their version of Susie Q, although it was very popular at the time.<br />The tracks recorded June 10-11, 1964 at Chess Studios in Chicago were:<BR>.....Around And Around<BR>.....Confessin' The Blues<BR>.....Empty Heart<BR>.....Good Times Bad Times<BR>.....It's All Over Now<BR>.....2120 S. Michigan version 2<BR>.....If You Need Me)<BR>Tracks recorded at Regent Sound in London were done on Feb 25, 1964<BR>.....Susie Q<BR>June 24-26, 1964<BR>.....Time Is On My Side version 1<BR>.....Congratulations<BR>Sep 28-29, 1964<BR>.....Under The Boardwalk<BR>.....Grown Up Wrong<br />This album was never released in the UK, however the tracks on it were released in the UK as follows:<br />6-26-64 It's All Over Now, Good Times Bad Times<br />8-14-64 Five by Five EP - If You Need Me, Empty Heart, 2120 S. Michigan version 1, Confessin' the Blues, Around and Around<br />1-16-65 The Rolling Stones No. 2 - Time Is On My Side version 1, Grown Up Wrong, Under The Boardwalk, Susie Q<br /> Congratulations was not released in the UK until 10-5-73 on the album No Stone Unturned <br />This information comes from \\"It's Only Rock And Roll: The Ultimate Guide To The Rolling Stones\\" by Karnbach and Bernson and from my own collection.
