0440213525|1.0|I'm willing to suspend disbelief when I read a novel.  Frankly, I frequently read novels as an escape -- but that's a whole 'nother issue.  The problem with this book is that the premise is so fundamentally flawed that it's hard to become engrossed.  Basically, within the first chapter or so a kid learns a secret that the mob wants kept quiet.  The underlying assumption of the balance of the novel is fundamenatally flawed.  The mob knows that the kid has the secret and the book is based on the assumption that they won't rub him out as long as he doesn't tell.  It makes no sense.  As long as he hasn't told anyone, there is something to be gained by getting rid of him.  If he spills the beans, maybe they'll be pissed and retailiate, but probably not -- the cat's out of the bag; it's too late.  The book attempts to maintain the tension under the illogical assumption that the mob will vacillate over what to do about the kid (who is annoyingly precocious) while he keeps the secret.  When the plot is so fundamentally flawed, and the kid is so precoiously annoying, I can't suspend disbelief and enjoy the book while I'm soaking up 'rays on the beach.
0812550706|2.0|Having been on a nostalgic classic Sci Fi trip lately I decided to pick up as many classics as possible and Ender's Game fit the bill.  I have heard a lot about this novel and it's sequels as a definitive Sci Fi collection so I expected solid things from Card's work.  Alas I was disappointed.  Perhaps it is because I am relatively young and in this modern age classic Sci Fi is becoming outdated by modern technology but I also found Cards writing to be a tad borish.  I read the entire book on a flight to Las Vegas so it is not a long read but the plotline really dragged.  The characters didn't seem to define themselves in any great manner and the biggest issue I had was that the whole point of everything was never truly presented.  At times I got a little lost at what was going on and had to track backwards to pick it all up again.  Once able to keep on track I found the plot to be predictable and redundant.  Ender was kind of an annoying character who just beat obstacle after obstacle with little explanation of how he did so.  By the end of the novel my mind was so numb from the monotonous plotline I pretty much missed the whole point of the book.  I wanted to like this book but it was just too dated and too simple to really have met my expectations.  It is truly an example of how Sci Fi is getting dated in todays society and if you want some real good classic sci fi stick to Herbert's Dune series or some of the newer stuff coming out.
B00005AQF7|5.0|Think back to 1993 when Dr. Dre's Chronic album was the hottest album out.  How many times did you hear Nuthin But a G Thang, Dre Day and Let me Ride.  Snoop Doggy Dogg was his sidekick and together they made hit after hit after hit and monopolized commercial rap radio together.  No one seemed hotter than Snoop Doggy Dogg at that point in time and the album he came out with was better than I could ever imagine.  I remember buying this album and listening to the whole thing over and over.  Some critics say this album is nothing but the Chronic Part II which is a pretty valid argument because the albums do have the same flavor but how bad can that be?? Doggystyle is a great album from top to bottom with the crazy fresh beats and the production by Dr. Dre.  Each song is very crisp and vocals come thru great.  Yes there is a lot of cursing, mentions of drugs, killing and disrepect of woman but if you didn't know that about Snoop before the album then you must of been living under a rock.  My favorite tracks on the album would have to be Gin and Juice, Ain't No Fun, What's my Name and Doggy Dogg World.  Don't worry about skipping tracks because even the skits are well done and entertaining.  The one bad thing about the album i would have to say is that G'z Up Hos Down is no longer included on the album.  Anyone with the first pressing has G'z Up Hos Down on it and has the messed up tracklisting with The Next Episode listed but no actual song on the album.  I guess the good ol Doctor didn't clear that Isaac Hayes sample.  But anyways, go pick this up, unlike many other rap artists from Southern California who made one album that had hits and just disapeared (Domino, MC Eiht) from the mainstream, this one really hits.  Snoop Dogg still makes records but nothing has ever come close to this album.  One of the essential albums ever in hip hop I believe.
B00005OWEG|4.0|If you appreciate Coppola's journey into the Heart of Darkness in the original Apocalypse Now, get this DVD. If you're not a fan, this won't change your mind.<BR>The additional scenes stretch the running time to the point where you'd best not make any plans for the day. Some do little to enhance the story, but some give fascinating glimpses into the environment and the characters that live in it.<BR>If you plan on adding either version of this movie to your collection, get this one. The sound is better. The extras are good and the additional scenes don't really detract from the overall production.
B00006LI4S|5.0|I stumbled across this one night and thought, what the heck.  I watched it yesterday, and only one word comes to mind.  WOW!!!!<BR>David Gilmour is definately one of the best guitarist in the world, with incredible creativity, and fingers that an amateur player like myself (who plays to my own amazement) look in awe at the master player.  <BR>Sure, he has some electronics to help get the right sound, but it takes pure genious to come up with such sounds, at just the right tone, at just the right time.  Absolutely, a must have for any Pink Floyd fan, or any guitarist as well, whether you like PF or not, get it.  It'll be the best money you ever spend.
B00008OWZC|2.0|For years I heard the hype about live Zep not being fully captured on Song Remains the Same.  Much of this hype is repeated in the many reviews here.  This band was my first great rock band love, and Jimmy Page is why I play guitar and own a Les Paul.  I was so excited to learn of this release and grab the discs.  But--wow, the band was weak at these shows.  Jimmy is sloppy, random and soul-less, and Bonham and Jones can do no more than pound loudly along under him.  I wondered if I had just outgrown the band, so I just listened to No Quater and The Rain Song from Song Remains the Same, all of Presence, and the studio Dancing Days and The Crunge-- No I haven't outgrown Led Zepplin, they were brilliant.  This release, though, is just for the those who like it very loud and very simple.  I can't recommend it.
B00005Y228|3.0|I bought Kylie's &quot;Fever&quot; earlier this year online after listening to clips of some of the tracks on the album, but mainly because I really like the songs &quot;Can't Get You Out of My Head&quot; and &quot;Love At First Sight.&quot;  I was quite surprised when I inserted the CD into my CD-Rom to listen to it for the first time.  Every song sounds like the one that came before it.<BR>The first track, &quot;More More More,&quot; sounds so much like the follow-up, &quot;Love At First Sight,&quot; but there's something about the latter that makes it much more enjoyable.  Next comes &quot;Can't Get You Out of My Head,&quot; probably her biggest hit in the US from this album.  It is a fairly enjoyable song but it gets old quickly.  The title track is next, and it is my favorite song on the album (although I suppose it isn't a fair statement to state that I have a &quot;favorite&quot; track since they all sound the same).  &quot;Fever,&quot; however, is the most enjoyable track for me.  &quot;Give It To Me&quot; sounds like something you'd hear on a telemarketing commercial.  The ringing sounds in the background are extremely annoying.  Just sounds like a slower version of &quot;More More More.&quot;  &quot;Fragile,&quot; however, makes up for its predecessor.  It is probably the closest that Kylie will ever come to making a ballad.  Even though the music goes quite fast, her vocals slow down.  She does have a very pretty voice.  &quot;Come Into My World&quot; sounds like a rock-edged version of &quot;Can't Get You Out of My Head.&quot;  &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; is just...there.  Sounds like every other cut on the CD.  &quot;Dancefloor&quot; and &quot;Love Affair&quot; follow in the same footsteps.  &quot;Your Love&quot; is another &quot;...just there&quot; song.  It has those same telephone-sounding rings in the background that &quot;Give It To Me&quot; has.  And the last track, &quot;Burning Up&quot; sounds like a Madonna remix from the '80s.<BR>I suppose if you're a hardcore Kylie Minogue fan or if you're obsessed with dance-pop, then this is a good CD to add to your collection (and of course, you must not mind that the whole CD sounds like one long, long song, or else you'll probably break it with frustration).  Otherwise, don't be fooled by the entrancing beats of &quot;Can't Get You Out of My Head&quot; or the sunshine music of &quot;Love At First Sight.&quot;  It wouldn't be worth your money to you.
0385504209|3.0|I wanted to love this book, because the plot, the ideas, and the themes of ancient spirituality sounded so promising. For the most part, you do get a bit of factual information that's intriguing enough to get you thinking.<br />But the breathless pace of the plot is simply made-for-TV. There's not a moment to pause and really see into the characters. Each chapter is about three pages long and ends with some tantalizing little bit that reminds me of a blackout before a commercial.<br />The code itself is sometimes dazzling and sometimes impossibly obvious. There were times I had to snap the book shut in disgust because the supposedly brilliant protagonist couldn't solve a basic riddle or recognize Da Vinci's famous mirror writing. And frankly, Da Vinci really has not much at all to do with the plot.<br />One would think that a thriller directed at an educated audience would be written with a little more care, more realistic dialogue and a hint of verisimilitude. I really couldn't believe any of the bold escape plans. Plus, for a book so focused on female spirituality, why is the Sophie character so distant and never allowed to show her own sexual side?<br />It's not a total disappointment, but I found myself let down by the final pages. This book could have been brilliant. It's just average.
B00004TDTO|5.0|All these so called \\"scary\\" films about sharks that have been made are rubbish. Deep Blue Sea, Shark Attack, Lake Placid, they're nothing compared to Jaws. Everything about this movie is great. The best thing is, is that most of the time, you can't see the shark atatcking and you sit there biting off your fingernails wishing you could tell those people to get out of the water. As soon a Christine Watkins dives into the ocean and dissapears in the mouth of the shark, you get shivers up your spine. Don't be fooled by the PG rating, because this is not a movie you want to watch with your kids.
B00005JLWN|5.0|This movie was awsome. There is no doubt this will become a cult classic in the years to come. If you like sci-fi movies with not a ton of special effects rent this movie and then you will want to buy it. I have watched it 5 times already. The action is compareable to Blade and The Matrix. The ending will blow you away.
0786869143|5.0|I'm feeling lucky this week.  I read two of the best books I'v read in a long time, both on the subject of bringing about good fortune by using one's mind.  This book, and The Little Guide To Happiness.  Both show us what a change in thinking and attitude can do to our exterior lives.  Wonderful!!!
B00006C7G9|5.0|I watched this with my Dad, and knew we had to get it! I love most war movies, and think they are all great, but I've NEVER seen one as good as this one! The price is a little much, but hey, what would you expect for an item as good as this, that is this long? I recommend you get it, because you'll never find a war movie as good as this one!
B00005UEAR|5.0|......THE BEST...CD EVER!!!!!!! (except maybe Scenes From A Memory another great DT release) This cd spent 4 months straight in my car cd player after the week I bought it. The cd is so unbelievably good not just in the instrumental part but I think its the best lyrics that Dream Theater has written to date. Ill Break it down song by song.<br />1) Glass Prison-The best opening song I can think of. It starts out really slow and erie and you can hear bells in the background. Then the song starts to pick up and I was bobbing my head...the first time I heard it untill the kid next to me nugged me (Kinda embarrasing). Then Singing..........but dont worry cuz its not long before you hear the reasons you bought the cd John Petrucci pounding away at his guitar, Ruddess playin the best keyboards of the modern era and in my opinion the best drummer and basist to ever live portnoy and myung making you want to cry at their godlikeness. The madness lasts for 13 mins and I wish it was longer because there is absolutely no part of this song that I dont like. 11/10<br />2) Blind Faith-A lot slower and more melow than the glass prison although the instrumental is nowhere near as good as glass prison I still like this song a lot because the lyrics are really good and it gives you time to relax after the unbelievably fast paced opener. 8/10<br />3) Misunderstood-A very dark song. It has very meaningful lyrics and the first time I heard it it made me cry. 9/10<br />4) The Great Debate-A song about stem cell research. It talks about a very important topic in 2001 and 2002. The lyrics are very thought provoking. O yea btw the keyboards on this song are unbelievably amazing. The only part I dont like about this song is the background comentary. Otherwise I'd give it a 10. 9.5/10<br />5) Dissapear-The worst song on the cd. Its another one of those ...songs where we get to hear Labries F49907Y opera voice. wootins. The only thing bringing this song up is the good lyrics. 6/10<br />6) Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence-The most epic song i have ever heard in my life. Its a 42 min song broken up into 8 parts. The song takes you on a rollercoaster ride and is very emotional. The lyrics are very powerful and I like every part of the song. Even Goodnight Kiss which is a part where we get to hear Labries opera voice. whoop whoop. Otherwise the song is amazing. My favorite part of the song is the test that stumped them all. I cant really explain the song to well but take my word for it its really good. 10/10<br />NEW TO DREAM THEATER OR AN OLD FAN THIS CD IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANY1 THAT EVEN CLAIMS TO APPRECIATE TRUE MUSIC. IF YOUR AN OLD PROGRESSIVE FAN LIKE RUSH OR ELP OR EVEN PINK FLOYD YOULL LOVE THIS. IF YOUR A FAN OF OLD METAL YOU WILL LOVE THIS ALSO. ANY1 WHOS EVER PICKED UP AN INSTRUMENT OR ANYONE IN GENERAL WILL FIND SOMETHING IN THIS ALBUM THAT THEY LIKE. FOR REAL DAWG.
B000089RVX|5.0|I love this album and discovered it like many others when \\"Bring Me To Life\\" was used in the movie \\"Daredevil.\\" Another reviewer stated it best that the interpatation of the songs \\"depend on who is listening to it.\\" Many of the songs, at least to me, deal with spirtuality, death and the supernatural. Not all of the songs are depressing (at least not on the same level of depression). Besides the hit \\"Bring Me to Life,\\" \\"Going Under,\\" \\"Haunted,\\" and \\"Torniquet\\" also stand out. These are good rock songs that will stay in your head until you listen to them over and over again. Furthermore, songs like \\"My Immortal\\" remind me of singer/songwriters like Tori Amos, mostly because of the depressing mood. <br />If you are a fan of hard rock music or depressing melodic music, this is the album for you.
B000002HK4|4.0|I love the Epic 23 min A Change of Seasons it is one of my favorite songs of all time. The song is the most epic song I have ever heard except maybe the title track on Six Degrees (my favorite DT release). It has so much going on in the song. Ofcourse the instrumental is amazing because its dream theater but a suprise to me is that for the first time I think I can say that I acctually like hearing LaBries voice. I really dont like the part about all the covers that come after the title track. Even though I am a big Zeppelin and Pink Floyd fan I still just really cant get into this. Maybe its just me but I would much rather hear an original DT song than a cover. If you are an established Dream Theater fan I highly recommend this cd as it wont displease. If you are relatively new to DT I would say that you should start out with either Scenes From a Memory or Six Degrees and then get something Earlier like Awake and if you like all of that then I'd say change of seasons would be a good next choice.
B0000009TK|5.0|This is a great recording.  In fact, it is my favorite live Frank Zappa release.  I know, there are many out there, and the Helsinky Concert represented well on YOU CAN'T DO THAT ON STAGE ANYMORE VOL 2 is well worth a look if you don't already own that... but, this one is so good.  Jazz was always a genre that FZ could write and perform for very well (see Grand Wazoo, Waka Jawaka) and I am so grateful that FZ decided to concentrate on jazz one last time.. being as this is from his last tour back in 1988.<br /><br />A lot of people do not like the chaos of When Yuppies Go To Hell, but I think it is very good.  But without further ado, here is the review:<br /><br />DISC ONE<br /><br />WHEN YUPPIES GO TO HELL, this song is just a mind blownig avande garde tool o' de force.  What wonder FZ could get out of this lineup.  And, what a lineup it was.  Even though they could not get along and forced the tour to stop (shame on you fellas)<br />FIRE AND CHAINS/LETS MAKE THE WATER TURN BLACK -- the way this band puts thier 'eyebrows' on this particular section is just awesome.<br />Jumping ahead to BIG SWIFTY/KING KONG... this is an incredible part of side one ... just listen, and smile.<br /><br />DISC TWO<br />BLACK PAGE really kicks the side two into high gear (I like disc two way better, although cd one is really good)<br />CITY OF TINY LIGHTS... there are many different incarnations of this live in the all the live output of FZ but THIS IS THE BEST ONE THERE IS.  THIS IS THE SINGLE MOST INCREDIBLE VERSION OF 'CITY OF TINY LIGHTS' THAT THERE IS.  And, it is so incredibly powerful that it is worth the price of the cd just to listen to this incredible performance.  I get chills just talking about it, and any member of this ensemble that listens to this song must be super proud.<br />THEN you get<br />Royal March from l'Histoire du Soldat<br />Theme from 'The Bartok Piano Concerto #3 followed by Sinister Footware.  What else do you need?<br /><br />Some notes about the band line up.. this particular line up was filled with turmoil.  they were not getting along.  There are tons of stories about this and that and what and who was at fault, but this much is true.. often conflict makes incredible music (I.E. Pink Floyds David Gilmore and Roger Waters) and this is a great example, compounded with the fact that FZ made them rehearse for three months, five days a week, ten hours a day before he even took them on the road.  This band could play at its own funeral.  FZ molded this band into one of his most incredible performers.  Too bad we only have 3 or 4 studios from this band, because they were THAT GOOD.<br /><br />If you want to hear jazz oriented rock, with classical tunes intermixed at flawless execution MIXED with FZ biting humor... this is the CD 4 U.<br /><br />This CD is in my top 5 FZ to own.ine up.. this particular line up was filled with turmoil.  they were not getting along.

B00007E8V4|5.0|System of a down gets even better as they get older, they can be Medolic, Heavy, Political, or just plain weird smetimes, and still manage to be one of the best bands ever. Alot better than their first self titled album i say. My personal favorites have to be.......... all the tracks but one. They should of really left off of the cd, and that song is streamline, which is also on the Scopian King Soundtrack, its just not a good closing out song. But it doesn't really matter when the rest of the cd can put any other band to shame. Their creative juices were really flowing when they wroe these songs. All and All this has to be one of the best cds ever, and if you don't like the cd at first, it'll proably grow on you like it had to on me.
0316666343|5.0|I have always been a fan of books that hook you within the first few pages, and this book layed brutal hooks in me right away.  The novel's lead character and narrator, Susie Salmon, is already dead when readers are first introduced to her.  Susie is raped and killed by her neighbor, George Harvey, who we later get to know on a deeper level.  The novel explores what the afterlife may be like, and the many different levels of grief that people go through to find the strenghth to move on.  As readers we see through Susie's eyes and feel the pain of losing those we love.  We watch Susie's little sister, Lindsay mature, her mother grow distant, her father's obsession with finding her killer, and her little brother Buckley attempting to understand death.  Who knew the such a painful subject would make to be a great work of insprational fiction?  This is one of the best books I have read yet.
B00005JM03|5.0|As a Mini owner-the identical twin of Charley's in this film-and as a fan of the original Italian Job, I felt an obligation to go and see this film.  I must admit I went expecting to be let down.  I mean, no one makes action movies like they used to, right?  WRONG!!!  I was delighted to find that this is a real, old-school, action-upon-more-action film.  From the first chase sequence through the cramped canals of Venice, you get the impression that you're in for a very exciting ride.  And it only gets better!  Not only are the chase scenes elaborate and perfectly choreographed, but the plot is clear and straight forward.  No useless side plot/love story thrown in for the ladies....Thankfully!!!  The cast was great too.  Everyone was perfect for their role.  Mark Whalburgh is perfect as the likeable thief, Charley.  Donald Southerland is great as the aging robber and mentor to Charley, although I think this would have been a perfect role for Michael Caine.  Edward Norton is the slimiest slime ball ever!!!!  Seth Green is hilarious as always.  And Jason Statham, well I've had a crush on him since Lock Stock!!!  But the real stars are the three Mini Coopers.  They race around through packed streets, on sidewalks, and through subway tunnels.  They take sharp turns, flights of stairs, and the highest jumps like they were nothing.  I saw the original Italian Job when I was 10 and it made me want a Mini, this film made me proud that I own one!!!A top film all round and worth going to see....several times!!!!!
B00005JLRT|1.0|I am so dissapointed with this film...<br />Why was Wesley Crusher at the wedding sitting next to his mother in Star Fleet uniform no less? Everyone who watched the series knows he became something other then human and joined with the traveller. Right off the bat this unexplained cameo had me scratching my head. <br />What was the purpose of the whole dune buggy chase? If B4 (Data's new brother) was supposed to be found by Captain Piccard and company why would these unknown aliens suddenly attack? Who were these aliens? Why did this whole chase resemble something out of Mad Max? Where did the new android come? <br />Why was Data back to his old stoic self? What happened to the emotion chip? Why was he suddenly having problems understanding the human condition again? We all saw him cry for his cat when he found it alive. We all saw him show a big range of emotions in the last few films. The chip is never even mentioned.<br />Geordi does nothing in this film. Beverly does nothing in this film. Worf does nothing in this film (er uh'm he shoots a gun in the dune buggy chase). Riker does nothing in this film. Deana gets mind raped and somehow later uses her telepathic abilites to locate a cloaked Romulan ship, other then that, she does nothing. It's a very poorly thought out Data and Piccard show.<br />Hey Piccard clone.... you need a full tranfusion (of what is never quite explained) from Piccard to stop your accelerated cellular degeneration. Hmmm, here is an idea. Grow another clone, activate the aging correctly (so the problems you have don't occur in it) and then get your transfusion from it.  Might be smarter then bring Piccard all the way from the Fereration to kick your butt. I never could quite understand your beef with the Federation anyway. I think you would exact revenge on the Romulans first, then go after Earth.<br />The ships seem to be looking more like Star Wars vehicles and less like Federation ships. The Janeway cameo was really done poorly. Killing off Data was the worst descision ever, even if you did leave him a replacement in B4. <br />Even watching the deleted scenes didn't help this stinker make sense. In fact I think they could have cut much more, at least two hours worth. Oh, yeah, by the way, it's a two hour film.

B00003CWL6|5.0|Some of my thoughts whilst viewing this superb film stem from the fact that being from another culture I judge many things about the movie to be \\"so typically American\\"... and yet, I admit that the \\"American life\\" is only a symbol of modern life in all the western civilization. A civilization that does not come out so nicely from this portrayal.  <BR>An example of this would be one of the movie's strongest parts when Annette Bening obsessingly scrubs the house she intends to sell, telling herself \\"I will sell this house today\\" over and  over again as a mantra and then breaking apart at the end of the day.. Crying and slapping her face for crying... What I mean is that I judge this behavior to be very American in the sense that Americans are great believers of the self power to change one's self and the reality surrounding him, and yet, this scene can also be viewed as a cosmopolite statement about loneliness - the fact that by the end of the day all you have is yourself only, and the ways people find to make themselves miserable.... all on their struggle to what they see as happiness (money? .... Success?) <br />I loved Kevin Spacey in this movie. I think his character is what gives this movie its charm. This could have been a totally depressing movie and is a little less so as his character somehow manages to give some comic relief - to be funny and heartbreaking at the same time. Lester has something about him that totally appeals to all of us - the courage to throw everything away - sort of achieving every one secret wish. He manages to be a total loser and a hero at the same time. This character is so human - and such a contrast to the phony uptight wife. I found the scene where he reaches out for her to be very touching... however she is more interested in the sofa.<br />And yet, life can be beautiful and this too comes out from the movie. There can be so many good things and Lester does not need to work in a \\"real\\" job to be happy. The other characters seem all to be in a search of happiness -  Ricki can see beauty only through his camera so it seems and when he is behind the camera he can become one with nature and with his surrounding. There is so much contrast between his \\"art\\" - and the beauty he can find in filming a plastic bag moving in the wind and the kind of life he leads, full of lies and deceit. He has found his way of \\"surviving\\" and in a way so did the other characters. The problem starts when these survival methods are shattered such as with Angela, Jane's friend, or when Carolyn's pretenses and fake up world is exposed. Lester is the only one who did not have pretenses (he had one secret re Angela but I feel that at least towards himself he did not lie about it) and thus I see him as a tragic hero. He did not \\"pretend\\" or lie, and yet paid the price for the others dishonesties.
B00000IQC8|5.0|I was told to watch this clerk movie that was super funny. Well, my friend was right on about the super funny! This movie showed how my generation dealt with so many of our problems, and I loved every single minute of it. Grab it and watch it over and over again.
B00008K7AM|4.0|I'm from the UK so have just seen this film at the cinema. I really liked the look of the film from the trailers, though i did read a really bad review of it on teletext.co.uk. I still went to see the film and I'm really glad I did! It's not a major complicated film and sometimes you dont need it to be! I just fancied having a few laughs and that's exactly what I got. I really like the fact that adam sandler is always is his films and vice versa! Yes, there were cheesy lines and american stereotypes, but hey, that's all part of the fun of it. Critics who review these films think they obviously are always right and dont even consider the target audience. I'm 21 and I dont consider myself to be a 'moron' who has no intellectual capacity thank you very much! It's a fun light-hearted film that many of you enjoy - definitely watch it!
B00005YW4H|5.0|I first heard Norah Jones on my local public radio station. Her voice was soothing; her songs were soft and easy on the ears--which is rare these days. Eventually, of course, she ended up on top 40 radio and won five Grammys--all well-deserved.<br />Several months later, I decided I had to get the CD; and I'm very glad I did. So what if there are no up-beat songs on here? According to Norah herself, slow, &quot;nighttime&quot; music is what she prefers, and that is what she offered on her CD. From the opening notes of &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; to the closing notes of &quot;The Nearness of You,&quot; you cannot help but be drawn in. Excellent music for either the night, or for lounging around on a lazy afternoon. I hope she will not be one of the many to succomb to the &quot;Best New Artist Winner&quot; curse; and I don't believe she will. She'll be around for a while. Thumbs up.
B00005J9U1|1.0|Yet another Bob Marley &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; CD, and one that makes the big mistake of substituting the band version of &quot;Redemption Song&quot; for the acoustic solo version.  Almost all artists' Greatest Hits anthologies seem doomed to have at least one blunder of inclusion or omission, but given the poignancy of this particular omission (the haunting solo version was the last cut on the last Marley album released during his lifetime), this CD must be written off as just another corpse dig by The Man.  Completely unnecessary.  For those shopping in the Bob Marley express lane, stick with &quot;Legend.&quot;
B0000028VT|5.0|Lately Mariah Carey has been on the usual fad when it comes to music and sometimes I find it hard to still stay such a big fan. But when I put in Mariah's cd's I dreft back to that time when I felt like she was looking at my life with a notepad and a pencil. Writing down everything she see's. Music Box isn't the greastest but it's one of the top 5 (Daydream, Music Box, Butterfly, Emotions, and Rainbow). She is one of the worlds most distinguishable and truly talented music artist whos talents are clearly showed in this CD of hers.
B00006LLLN|3.0|The audience is obviously in love, judging from all of the whooping and hollering.  These are competent, careful renditions of tracks I liked better in their studio versions - Krauss' voice is better suited to the intimacy of headphones than the concert hall - with nothing really catching fire until they &quot;kick out the jams,&quot; so to speak, on Bad Company's \\"Oh!  Atlanta.\\"  Jerry Douglas is an astounding dobro player, and he makes some of the tracks sound positively baroque, when simplicity would have perhaps worked a bit better.  Pleasant enough, but mostly hollow inside.  You're better off with Krauss's more intimate and emotionally powerful &quot;greatest hits&quot; compilation, &quot;Now That I've Found You.&quot;

B00004W50T|4.0|They didn't fiddle with the sound a lot that I can tell, which is fortunate because I always liked the hazy sound of this recording better than its follow-up, &quot;The Band,&quot; even if the material is stronger on the latter.  Hard to find fault with songs like &quot;The Weight&quot; and &quot;We Can Talk,&quot; however.  Loose, gently rocking, and slightly untidy, Big Pink is like a warm personal letter from a close friend.  While Levon Helms' drumming is a wonder, no one really calls attention to themselves, and that is a large part of what makes this work so well. This edition features several amazing outtakes, including &quot;Yazoo Street Scandal&quot; and &quot;Katie's Been Gone,&quot; both the equal of just about anything on the original Big Pink.
B00008PX8P|5.0|No need to look further, they finally did it! I have seen some great concert footage in my time, and spent a small fortune to do so. Nothing in my collection matches the vivid color or awesome sound of this set. Truly a must have for any Led Zeppelin collector. There is only two complaints. 1. Would love to see disk 4 and five. 2. As all Atlantic releases, the packaging is terrible. You'd think they could afford better booklets, more information, more pictures. Any additional printed material would be nice. I've seen low-end bootlegs that have better artwork. BUT......don't let that be a reason to buy this set! You'll love it!
B00008BXJF|4.0|While the move to a more metallic approach may be in part an attempt to reach a younger audience, it is by no means a callous one:  the band sounds inspired and invigorated.  One suspects the power percussion of Pat Mastelloto is just more suited to a heavier style than Bill Bruford's jazzier grooves.  Guitarist Adrian Belew remains Fripp's best hiring move: still providing smiles among the many shadows, and his voice sounds stronger.  The usual daunting instrumental passages are some of the Crim's most interesting in years.  And while the songs aren't quite at the level of the gems on Thrak (save for the cheekily witty &quot;Happy With What You Have To Be Happy With&quot;), &quot;Eyes Wide Open&quot; is simply lovely.  Not sequenced quite as effectively as it could have been, but still multi-dimensional listening, a rarity these days.
1577311523|5.0|I think this book does a good job of explaining that which is in essence indescribable; words themselves can limit our understanding and so to some this may sound new age.  Actually the concepts are not really new.  If you're familiar with Jungian concepts, you'll note similarities herein as well as with the teachings of Jesus Christ and Buddha and a number of the world's great psychologists, philosophers and spiritualists.  Personally I believe all these teachings to be true and to be saying basically the same things. I also appreciate the author's sense of urgency and I believe that we must awaken and respond to the urgency of the messages summarized within this book or like books if you cannot let yourself be enlightened by this book.<br />Enough of why to read this, let me tell you what I heard while reading.  First, we are all connected by the great life force, call it spirit if you like, the author refers to it as the now, that exists within each one of us and every living thing.  Result of this recognition will be respect and compassion for others and all living things as well as your own internal peace which is in the end that which we are really seeking.  We must constantly observe and challenge our thoughts and the inherent patterns of response that we share with all humans, (Yung called this the collective unconscious.)  That means asking yourself, why do I feel this way, why can't I stop thinking about this, why did I do that etc..  Another essential message is forgiveness; specifically the author cites that we need to forgive the past.  We hang onto anger and bitterness and perpetuate pain; to forgive frees us from this.  For many, not allowing forgiveness of another or the past, that which has already happened, causes them to be physically ill today.  It is hard to forgive but harder to hold onto these grudges.  The other half of staying in the now is of course living in the future, or living for the goal instead of living along the way to the goal. Isn't that what Carpe Diem means?  <br />God is love; in a state of true Spirit, in the now as the author cites it, there is only love and joy.  If you've never felt this comfort, seek it now.  It is a hard truth to realize that we are perpetuating our own suffering because it means we are responsible not only for the cause but for the solution as well.  If we each sought, found and acted on our own storehouse of inner peace, suffering would end.  While this is an ideal, it can happen, as change does happen, one person at a time starting with the person in the mirror. <br />This book also has an interesting chapter on relationships further citing to the discomfort of some readers that women have more power because they are more in tune with their whole beings that includes their Spirit; if you want this power, read this book, or some of the other recommendations but respond to these common messages while we still have time.  While I think human beings may be able to survive for a good while, I am very concerned that our planet cannot.  My only other comment on this book and that those of us who are already awake must do more than just be conscious in whatever way we can; much is expected to those who have been given much.
B00008WG3U|2.0|Didn't even no the new NOFX was coming out until I saw the posters all over Downtown D.C.  Talk about excited!  After the latest B.R. album hit I had very high expectations.<br />This album misses nearly all of them.  Song 1 starts out good then its a slippery slope from there.  I listened to it twice then went back to Cigar Speed is Relative.<br />Will I go to the show if they come to DC?  Of course.  Should you buy this album.  Probably, the liner notes are cool.
0790729393|5.0|\\"SLEEPERS\\" HAS TO BE ONE OF THE GREATEST MOVIES I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE! It is filled with so much emotion that will carry you for years to come. The plot could be a little offensive to some and rumors of the alleged pseudo story should not keep you from experiencing this magnificent masterpiece. <br />This is a movie not to be missed! All characters are unique in their own way, but also connecting in their aspirations. The four young boys deliver a performance of innocense that make you want to reach in and give your life to them. When they grow old, the shattered innocense is still evident in their faces, demeanors, and even action. They have more determination to finally seek the revenge they so yearned for and not even arrogant revenge - sweet revenge. Revenge that no one I know would feel differently about. I guarantee the characters feelings will soon be transformed into your own. One of Brad Pitt's greatest movies; Jason Patrick's tender quality; Billy Crudup's first encounter with serious acting before \\"Almost Famous\\"; Ron Eldered is great with remaining inner turmoil; All four young stars are excellent also with one of Brad Renfro's best movies; Robert De Niro's talent never fails as the boy's priest trying to set their lives in the right direction; Also one of Minnie Drivers' gentle performances. The acting and musical direction connect to bring you scenes that are just plain - beautiful.<br />Barry Levinson creates such scenes to enliven the passion you never knew you had. The movie ends and begins with the four friends who were succumbed to sexual, physical, and verbal abuse winning a dance competition. Additionally, with some narraration that will catch your intuition with deliberate interest. Throught the movie, you follow the agony associated with losing the innocense that once made the value of your life. You follow Shakes, John, Tommy, and Michael through a journey of once achieving the one thing that can alleviate some pain of their experiences -revenge. <br />I implore you to take the time to watch this movie and read the book (because it can even be much better than the movie if one can believe that) and i promise you won't miss out on life - you might gain realizations and insight into your own. <br />HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Guaranteed to reveal inner emotions and connect with the characters on a level beyond your expectations. Read the book ... Watch the movie ... and it will remain one of your greates experiences ever. Guaranteed. GO NOW...I PROMISE!
B00008NG5V|5.0|I discovered Brushfire at the beginning of last summer and I've listened to it almost constantly over the past year. I was so excited that this album came out, already it's the official soundtrack to summer and probably the upcoming year!  ;o)
B00005UEAR|5.0|I don't understand how anyone could listen to the second disk of this album and not get goosebumps.  It's a musical journey with universal relevance.  It pulls you in on a rollercoaster of pain, despair, and eventually peace.  There's no accounting for some people's taste, but I shake my head at those who criticize this album.  Anyone who is not moved by the whole 6DOIT suite is missing what is truly an exceptional piece of music. <br />I suspect the first disk will please the long-term DT fans; it's crunchy, heavy and musically sophisticated enough to please the purists.  Disk 2 is the real gem here; as someone who has battled depression, this disk holds special proximity to me.  <br />DT has not sold out; to the contrary, they've evolved into a band that is greater than the sum of its parts, much as is the case with 6DOIT.  <br />I can't say enough good about this album, other than the fact it is inspirational, moving and poignant. Give it a listen and you'll see what I mean...
B000002H6C|3.0|...this is actually the album when Metallica originally jumped the shark. I honestly like ALL of Metallica's material to one degree or another, but every band reaches their true peak at some point and is never able to climb that high ever again. AJFO marks the band -after- their peak.<br /><br /> When I was in high school, bands like DRI and COC began discreetly introducing metal into my system without me even realizing it. Next thing I knew it was 1986 and I was listening to Slayer every day. From there it was an easy task for a kid at school to get me hooked on Metallica by loaning me a tape of the then brand new Master of Puppets. To this day, that's my favorite Metallica album, with Ride the Lightning coming in a close second. And I also have to credit Metallica with being the first real influence that caused me to polish my guitar playing, trying to glean some skill instead of just pounding out simple three chord punk riffs all day.<br /><br /> I don't hate this album. I do have issues with the production. I can't stand the sterile, plastic drum sound. I don't like the complete absence of bass. I don't like the artifical, almost digital guitar sounds. I don't like the general high end tinny bias to the general mix throughout. What I do like is the song writing. These are great songs. It's just a shame they weren't recorded in way that would really bring them to life, as opposed to the cold and clinical sound they went with.<br /><br />The black album was the real disappointment for me. I really didn't care for the change in direction the writing took. I pretty much gave up on Metallica at that point, and they entered my growing pantheon of \\"bands I used to like, when I was a kid.\\" I suppose I felt like I'd grown up and left them behind. But surprise!: I -LOVED- Load. Not as much as Puppets or Lightning, but it definitely redeemed them to me after the black album. It turned out that Metallica had grown up too. Reload was... well, it was OK. Anyway, I'm listening to this and all of my other Metallica records because I'm anxious for the new album. From the samples I've heard, it sounds like they're putting out the hardcore album the always meant to do but never did. Good for them!my other Metallica records because I'm anxious for the new album.

B00007AJF9|5.0|Nothing compares with Cate Blanchett's performance of one of England's favorite monarchs.  Although the film, like many other period movies such as Braveheart, is not completely accurate, the experience of this film is overwhelming.  One is introduced to the climate of the Tudor Age, the issues, and the main cast of characters.  I consider this portrayal of Elizabeth I's reign to be one of if not the most powerful ever made.  This film has remade Elizabeth into a more believable and understandable person for the 20th Century. It is an absolute must for those who have an appreciation for period films and a passion for England's glorious past.
B000069AUI|5.0|I'm new to Coldplay, and I'm not really an alternative rock fan to begin with (whatever alternative means, still haven't figured that out yet).  I come from the school of Rush, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd and the Stones.  I find that I am very skeptical of newer bands, simply because it seems like typically someone is a ripoff of something /someone else.  I try to keep an open mind, however - even if I struggle.<br />The reason I'm babbling about my music interests is because I believe that this CD by Coldplay reaches out to music fans like myself.  \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" simply brings chills up my spine.<br />If you're new to Coldplay like I am, I see them as a sonic blend of Radiohead and U2, with the mystery and dreaminess of a Pink Floyd /Enya combination, and signs of the driving complex jams bestowed on music by the Rush institution.  I apologize in advance to the band and diehard fans if this was an inaccurate bastardization.<br />If you appreciate good musicianship and songwriting, pick this one up.  The individual songs stand up, but overall the CD is more of a single piece.  There is no denying that these guys are special, even to a close-minded music fan like myself.<br />I may even end up giving Coldplay credit for expanding my mind on the newer music scene of the last 10 or so years, and so may you.  Let's see how time treats this one and see if it holds up after 10 years to something like Rush's Moving Pictures, the Stone's Exile on Main Street or Floyd's Dark Side - it's worth consideration.
B000000JO3|5.0|Now I by no means am a fan of hardcore music so it baffles me why this album basically defines and sums up what is good about hardcore music.  Now there may be some people that criticize this album because the singer is straight edge. Now I hate straight edge kids today, not because they eat vegetables, but because they are discriminating hypocrites.  Ian Mckaye, the singer and Minor Threat was not the same.  He truly believed what he was talking about, and you can tell in the music.  Who says this is not fun music?  I say it is as fun as it can get, in a hardcore sort of way.  The first song, Filler gives a glimpse of the album.  Ian Mckaye, screams his lungs out, but not in a way that you can't hear what he says.  In fact you can hear most of the lyrics clearly.  This album pulls out a big bag of expletives so I don't recommend it for the faint of heart.  Plus the faint of heart don't have good taste in music anyway.  Some of the highlights of this album are seminal Straight Edge which passes by in just forty-six seconds, the song Minor Threat which sums up their political ideals pretty quickly, In My Eyes (My personal favorite) is probably the angriest song on the album and his full of just pure energy.  Now Guilty Of Being Of White is a great song and makes you stop and think.  You'll see what I mean when you hear it.  The whole album is amazing and there is by no means even close to resembling a weak track.  26 songs and they fly by in just 45 minutes, leaving a great effect upon the listener.  This album is what hardcore is all about, and even if you are not a hardcore fan (like me) you should at least like this album.  This album is one of my favorites and should be everyone else's too.
B00008MZ0N|5.0|I don't know about you, but all these reviews bother me! &quot;It's the ultimate guy flick,&quot; get real! Girls like this stuff, too, we're just not as quick to admit it. Aside from Paul Walker, Ja Rule, Tyrese(in 2Fast 2Furious) ana Vin Diesel(with his shirt off Oh My GOD!!) this movie has those amazing race scenes.  And there's also a girl driving(Michelle Rodriguez)! It's also not pointless, like some action flicks, and there is a plot for us to become engrossed in, as well as the major adrenaline rush. I still get chills down my back when Dom ends his first monologue with &quot;Ask any racer, any real racer, it don't matter if you win by an inch or a mile, winning's winning!&quot; And who doesn't want to drive the souped up Charger?
B00005JLT5|5.0|I had a few regrets at first when I bought this film because I have never seen a Polanski film in whole before and my mom begged me to at least take a chance and buy the movie. I seen it for a real good deal (...) and grabbed it without any thoughts. I guess the reason why I wanted to buy this film instead of renting it is because I collect movies and the word of mouth that this film has recieved especially in my town has been absolutely stunning. So one night (late, late, late at night) I had the chance and I took it by taking the DVD and putting it in my DVD player. The first scene takes place in a radio studio where the character Szpillman (Adrian Brody) is playing the piano over the Polish Radio. Then out of nowhere in the background a thrusting explosion is heard and soon the building in which the pianist is playing gets bombarded with bombs as the German take over goes unknowingly underway. This is how the film starts! With an instant beginning the film instantly begins the character's run through survival. After the families get weekly decrees from the German Nazis of rules on how Jews can only live and from then on the brutal reality of history portrayed by Roman Polanski is something you just have to see for yourself. The movie is 2 hours and 20 minutes long and it definitely will be a fast two hours because the scenes ,dialogue and whole story is so beautifully connected that it will almost feel that you were by his side the whole time as he tries so desperately to survive by hiding in bombed up buildings and ghost towns and a hospital that was evacuated after it was emptied by a fight from the Germans against some Jews who had some guns. Well this movie is one that I am happy I just bought because just writing this review makes me want to watch it right now!!! This is a beautiful film and I think Roman Polanski did everything right towards the making and story line of the film. It just has such a heavy atmospheric and emotional feeling when this film is watched and you won't move out of your seat, I guarantee it!
B00000IQBL|5.0|I just had to respond to the reviews that portray this movie as a condemnation of the military and our methods.  This movie just (for the lost part) shows what basic training and combat are like ( I've been through Paris Island, but not combat.)  I believe that the United States Marine Corps' accomplishments speak more loudly than the words of the reviewer of this film.  Marines have fought and died for this country for HUNDREDS of years, since 1775 to be exact.  Who the hell does the reviewer of this film think they are, George Washington, Thomas Pain, God?  Get a clue please.
B00005JKPF|5.0|Ya this movie delivers like no other movie so far this year. I Know that Matrix Reloaded had the most amazing action scences ever made but the story and everything about X2 was better. I'm not saying i dont like reloaded its just x2 was better. Lots are going to  disgree with me because reloaded has more hype than X2 but i don't care im just bein' honest <BR>Peace Out

B000002BFZ|4.0|Pearl Jam's senior effort is, above and all, solid proof that a record does not need to be commercially successful in order for it to be worthy.  &quot;No Code&quot; is an album that will leave you feeling pretty good because of its toss salad mixture of songs and melodies.<BR>The album begins with &quot;Sometimes&quot;, a slow, acoustic guitar driven three minute hum that leads right into &quot;Hail, Hail&quot;, a typical, hard-rock PJ song.  Then, instead of following &quot;Hail&quot; with another &quot;Hail&quot;, the album goes into &quot;Who You Are&quot;, a tribal chant that sounds as if Vedder has found his spiritual sense.  &quot;In My Tree&quot; continues with the tribal rhythm and is probably my favorite hard song on the album.  The next song &quot;Smile&quot; is a mix of hard and soft rock, which is also very good.  The next track &quot;Off He Goes&quot; is probably one of PJ's most beautiful ballads ever and will leave you feeling good.  The next three songs, &quot;Habit&quot;, &quot;Red Mosquito&quot; and &quot;Lukin&quot; are hard rock riffs which I usually end up skipping over since they are a little too hard for me.  Then comes &quot;Present Tense&quot;, which is just an amazing song because it starts off slow with a few bass lines and Vedder's soft vocals which lead up to a short hard rock climax and then a well-deserved soft finale.  Then comes &quot;Mankind&quot;, a decent PJ rock song.  The last two songs on the album, &quot;I'm Open&quot; and &quot;Around the Bend&quot; seem to express Vedder's pure emotional and intellectual state of being which is something I truly appreciate in an artist.  <BR>Overall, I enjoy this album on a regular basis and for the most part will leave you feeling good.  While not the most popular, &quot;No Code&quot; is definitely a chunk of gold worth finding.
0140177396|4.0|Lennie Small is too strong for his own good.  He is not a very intelligent person (everyone says he's stupid), and understands very little of what goes on around him.  If it weren't for his friend George, who travels with him, Lennie would have a very difficult time functioning in society.  In fact, he has that problem already.  His strength is a danger to him, because sometimes he harms things without understanding what he's doing.  For example, he's always crushing mice to death, and he even does this with a puppy.  Lennie is innocent and would never intentionally harm anyone, but his stupidity and his strength are a very potentially harmful combination.<br /> This book raises an interesting question:  what should be done with people who are dangerous through no fault of their own?  Should people like Lennie, who unintentionally harm other people, be held responsible for what they do?  Lennie is a very difficult case, because he does not deserve to be punished for what he inadvertently does, but he also cannot be left free to cause harm to other people.  This is the central conflict of the novel.<br />Set in depression-era America, this novel by John Steinbeck is well-written and thought-provoking.  The dialogue is fabulous, as is the narrative.  This book is considered to be a classic of 20th-century American literature, and in fact it is a very good read.  I would not give it the rank of classic, perhaps, but it is nevertheless a great (and highly recommended) novel.
B00008OWZC|5.0|This incredible 3-CD set, the first CD alone worth the money, encompasses the greatness of the band in their prime. It's release, although a bit late, will doubtless excite old fans and inspire new ones. This compilation delivers everything you could ask for in a live Led Zep set - it captures nearly all of their best songs from that time and shows how British rock gained tremendous popularity in the &quot;west&quot; - the US. You might notice that despite the three-disc package, there are only 16 tracks total - can it really do justice to this legend's repertoire? The answer is most certainly yes. The length is compensated by three 20-minute tracks, which are what live rock acts are all about - jamming, improvisation, and solos.<BR>    As a measure for comparison, one might look to the band Deep Purple, another great and highly influential British rock act. In their prime, with the Mark II lineup (easliy the best of the band's many permutations), they released a live set titled &quot;Made In Japan,&quot; a double-record package that included all of their best songs in a live set, featuring several extended versions of the songs. Coincidentally, it was recorded in the same year - 1972 - as this set and it did exactly for that band as &quot;How The West Was Won&quot; now does for Led Zeppelin - it recorded the best of their songs, when the band was at it's best, in the best music enviroment, onstage. This is the reason bands like this have longevity. A classics collection such as this immortalizes the band in the annals of rock history.
0393057658|4.0|As ever, Michael Lewis manages to make obscure financial/sports analysis and management practices accessible and interesting to the lay reader. But his great gift is to make the obsessions and particularities of his subjects compelling. The human process of baseball is at the heart of 'Moneyball,' and baseball and the Oakland A's are the perfect vehicle for Lewis's talents. Beane comes across as a kind of Ahab figure, forever driven to find the next undervalued prospect while nearly unable to watch his current team play. There is a lot of ego to him, which is odd coming from someone with so many regrets about his own life decisions. But that is exactly what makes him so worthwhile to be the subject of 'Moneyball.' Lewis is so talented a writer you come to believe he could make anyone's life a bestseller.<br />The considerable problem with 'Moneyball' is how it neglects the extent to which the A's Big 3 starters have made the team successful.  I recall that a method was devised by which a pitcher's effectiveness could be evaluated by the kinds of balls the opposing hitters put in play. Stunningly, none of this analysis is applied to Mulder, Zito or Hudson.  Perhaps they are all so dominant (Mulder's season is fast approaching that of Pedro's 1999 campaign) that the author didn't consider it necessary to mention. However, it would have really added a lot to the reader's understanding of what effective pitching really means. It just struck me as odd that this opportunity was passed over - it would have added a great deal to the book. Nevertheless, 'Moneyball' must be the best of the current batch of new baseball titles.
0312983867|2.0|I recently became addicted to the Stephanie Plum series, but was pretty dissapointed with this one.  Everything happened a little too fast, every kook can be compared to a kook from one of her other books.  Not awful, but not nearly as good as #5 or #7.
B00008OWZC|5.0|I used to be a Zep fan but never as much of a fan of them as I was the Stones and a few other bands. Never bought anything of theirs on CD, only had old albums and a few tapes. I happened to be listening to a Cleveland radio station on Memorial Day and they played all of the first CD from this great 3 set and I just went WOW!!! I immediately got online and went to Amazon and ordered that puppy and am I glad I did! Thanks Jimmy for a great CD that sure has stood the test of time......glorious fantastic!!!
B0000025DD|5.0|A wonderful album by the Pink Floyd Guitarist,David Gilmore. <BR>Its not Pink Floyd, but still a very enjoyable musical effort, stylizing David's individuality.
B00000ADG2|5.0|I've had this album since the very day it was first <BR>released but just last week I dug it up again and fell in <BR>love with it all over again. Round and round and I go back to being addicted 2 L-Boogie again.<br />It doesn't sound too dated and I just love her lyrics. She <BR>writes very clever stuff. More than just the average song- <BR>writer and yet just parred down enough to stop it all from <BR>ending up pretentious. I guess one could call it 'honest'. <br />At least, that's what it feels like to me. <br />I still remember the mess she caused when she released &quot;Doo Wop(That Thing)&quot; lol alot of people were disagreeing too hard and act all defensive but at the end of it all everybody gave L-Boogie the credit 4 telling &quot;the truth&quot; and I do mean the dirty down truth that nobody know of.<br />I loved every thing from the album, the way it was produced to the poetry rhyming to the vocals &amp; rythem arrangments:<br />-I loved how she took quotes from the Qu'ran &amp; the bible and blend them all 2ghether to build her own story, SMART!<br />-I loved the Doo Wop harmonies in all the songs! they remind me of The Dells, Jackie Wilson, Frankie Lymon &amp; The Teenagers and the rest of these 50's doo wop groups.<br />-I loved the whole live instruments(organs, clavinet, horns, rhodes, hammonds) I remember Prince back in 99 in Jay Leno giving her the credit 4 bringing back Donny Hothaway &amp; Stevie Wnoder's sound again.<br />-I loved the &quot;classes&quot; interludes at the end of almost every song,,I just love it, very cute!<br />-I loved the fact that I felt like &quot;Ex-Factor&quot;, &quot;When It Hurts So Bad&quot;, &quot;I Used To Love Him&quot; and &quot;Forgive Them Father&quot; were speaking directly 2 me. I neva felt this way 2ward any artist b4.<br />-I loved her critical attitude in &quot;Superstar&quot;, &quot;Lost Ones&quot; and &quot;That Thing&quot; and I also loved her uplifting attitude in &quot;Everything Is Everything&quot;. Ialso relate soooo much to &quot;To Zion&quot; it was the same way I felt when I was pregnant with my baby.<br />I might sound a lil' too much but I consider &quot;The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill&quot; the modern day version of &quot;Whats Going On&quot;. LOL I think you're going 2 hammer me becoz of what I've said but this is my honest opinion about it. It focus alot on issues that touchs the young people and tells 'em how to appraoch them and deal with them. At least,,personaly I could fully relate to it.
B00006J3WH|5.0|At first when I heard the idea of a Buffy musical, I thought &quot;Joss, what are you thinking?!&quot; But when I watched it, I realized it really was a great episode and the songs are pretty good, too. Many of the characters on Buffy sing really well, too, like James Marsters, Anthony Stewart Head, and Amber Benson. I also really like this CD because the songs are put in order so if you didn't see the Buffy musical episode, you can still understand and follow along how the characters are feeling. I would rate this more stars if it was possible. This is a MUST for any Buffy fan or anyone who just likes musicals.
0689835604|4.0|My 1 year old daughter absolutely loves this book!  In just a few weeks the flaps look old and worn but nothing has torn yet.  The book is pretty good when it comes to teaching where body parts are (belly button, hands, eyes, etc.).  It is fun for everyone to find out where baby's belly button is in the book and then point it out on your baby.
B00003W8NM|5.0|One part scathing social commentary, one part intro to abnormal psychology and throughout a work of genius, \\"Fight Club\\" is a must-see for anyone who is, ever has been, or is acquainted with a disaffected youth. Why do people who have everything seemingly hate everything and everyone?<br /><br />What is \\"Fight Club\\"? Think Holden Caulfied on crystal meth... one hell of a mind trip, but just as thought-provoking. Why is everyone so mad? Why do young men want to beat and be beaten? What is the source of our self-destructive impulses?<br /><br />The psychological turmoil that lies beneath the thin veneer of civilization covering most men is explored in this film. \\"Fight Club\\" is about the two sides of human nature: reason and animal violence. Or reason vs. animal violence? Why do we value material possessions, \\"Fight Club\\" asks us. \\"Why do I know what a duvet is? Its just a blanket,\\" said Brad Pitt's character. And so we are asked to confront our acquisitiveness, acquisitiveness being the clearest sign of our phoniness. \\"Fight Club\\" is about the split that occurs in each of us when faced with the choice-- to be driven by your heart, and inner compass or to be herded along with the rest of the sheep? In many ways \\"Fight Club\\" was the light at the end of a tunnel for many disaffected post-adoloescent, post-collegiate professionals who were sick of the herd mentality that suffused their environment. It made them know their dissatisfaction was not unique. That is why the phrase \\"I am Jack's Smirking Revenge\\" became almost a mantra. I don't want to be one of the sheep and be herded along to the slaughter. \\"Fight Club\\" hones into this feeling and the fears that produce it, as a result the film, while geared towards a cult audience is a modern classic.<br /><br />I give the \\"Fight Club\\" DVD five stars for being an accurate interpretation and distillation of Chuck Pahlaniuk's novel. In many ways the film is more effective than the novel. The casting choices, set design and cinematography were all stellar and the DVD comes with great extra features.
B0000057C5|4.0|...and I don't mean on the album notes. I mean the Depeche Mode cover. Till sings it with a badass German lisp, pronouncing the words sharply and oddly, but heavy industrial Depeche Mode is an amazing thing, and the instrumental is amazing. Of course, the rest of the album isn't bad, it's just...poppy. Compared to Herzeleid, everything sounds laid back and light. Sensucht also lacks the epic sweep of Mutter, and the music gets boring real quick. I know I'm not the only one that notices that \\"Du Hast\\" sounds eerily similar to Ministry's \\"Just One Fix,\\" off Psalm 69, and actually, most of the songs do. Not to mention the lyrics are a lot more dirty on here than on Mutter.<br />Why 4 stars? \\"Tier\\" is a rompin'-stompin' good time, \\"Sehnsucht,\\" an awesome opener, \\"Bück Dich,\\" a piledriving ode to homosexuality, \\"Kuss Mich,\\" great with that crazy cartoon sample, \\"Alter Mann\\" has that driving beat, and of course, there's \\"Stripped.\\" There's enough to warrant a listen every few months or so, when I get tired of Psalm 69 or Mutter and Herzeleid. Not a masterpiece, and not bad, it's just that there's better. Rammstein's done better. Oh, well...<br />Rammstein prima!
B00009EIQE|5.0|Remember that first song on Buddy's last album?  Well, now there's a whole CD of it.  Does it rock out like most of Buddy's previous outings?  No.  It takes its time and sneaks up on you.  This is the perfect CD for a early mornings, late nights and long drives.  Smooth, haunting and from another place and time.  Buddy may be from Louisiana and live in Chicago, but I can tell you that this album feels like it comes from Clarksdale, Mississippi.  It's real and real good.
0312932081|5.0|Anyone who wishes to improve their life and the lives of their children should not only read Ender's Game, they should live it!<BR>Being a small boy, almost everybody can relate to Ender's struggles and successes in the novel. When he triumphs over bully after bully, so do you. When he dominates the battleroom, you do too. And when he finally ... but, then, I wouldn't want to give away the end. You'll just have to read this wonderful work for yourself!
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I was flipping through the channels the other night, when I happened upon this movie. Within a second, I was hooked until the bitter end, just like the group of addicts this film is focused on. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. Just like a drug, it was beautiful and terrifying at the same time. I CANNOT believe I haven't seen this movie until now. This is one of the few movies that left me stunned, deeply affected, and just plain disturbed afterwards (the only other movie to do that was \\"Bully\\"). Shock-value aside, this movie was simply great, multidimensional filmmaking - visually, musically, and acting-wise. It's one of the best films I've ever seen.<br />In classical music, a requiem is a Mass for the dead. In the movie, we watch aspirations and relationships wither away when the characters are consumed by addiction. Overweight TV-addict Sara Goldfarb (portrayed amazingly by Ellen Burstyn) turns to speed for weight-loss when she believes she is chosen as a TV-show contestant. Her son Harry (Jared Leto) is a heroin addict, along with his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) and his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans). Harry and Marion dream of opening a store, and Tyrone wants to prove to the memory of his mother that he can be successful, so they get involved in drug dealing for some fast cash. Unfortunately, the road to hell is paved with good intentions, and the rest of a movie is a frightening trip down that path. When it all crashes in the end, all four characters are left rotting in their own personal hell, alone and tormented by their inner demons.<br />Ellen Burstyn should've won the Academy Award over Julia Roberts. The deterioration Sara goes through is intense. By the last part of the movie, she's a loony speed junkie, barely recognizable from the beginning of the movie. Physically and emotionally, her change is a total 180°. Jared Leto is wonderful as well. His eyes alone express huge amounts of emotion. You can really feel the love he has for his girlfriend, and the concern he has for his mother. Marlon Wayans surprised me by not hamming it up in his usual comedic way. I almost wasn't sure if that was him at first, since he usually doesn't tackle such dramatic roles. He handled himself splendidly... it's nice to see he's got serious acting chops. He came off as very natural. Jennifer Connelly was amazing. As her character starts to self-degrade, you can totally feel what she's going through, especially when she hits rock bottom.<br />Let's talk about the directing now. Darren Aronofsky, the director, is a genius. I have never seen a film utilize both visual and audio techniques to narrate a story as well as this movie did. Visually, the movie plays like a David Fincher flick on acid. Rapid cuts and edits, fisheye lenses, split screens, slow-mo and high-speed shots, swirling cameras... a whole array of MTV-like editing techniques are used. But, it never seems gratuitous, as if it were done just for the sake of looking cool and artsy. These techniques help enhance the storyline, making you feel like you're really in the characters' shoes. I felt like I was on drugs just watching this movie, experiencing both the highs and the lows (especially in the truly frightening final sequence). Moments of willpower in the film are shot very effectively as well; if you've ever been on a diet, you'll totally relate to the clock-watching, the beckoning fridge, and the quickly disappearing food. One technique I really loved was whenever a character used their addiction (whether it be smack, TV, coffee, coke, etc.), the camera would zoom-in up close and show syringes shooting, pupils dilating, lighters sparking, spoons bubbling, pill bottles popping open... all in rapid succession with sound effects going \\"pop, bubble, crackle, slurp, snap, suck!\\" This technique is repeated over and over, to give you a sense of the habitual nature of addiction. I can't even smoke a joint anymore without close-up images of lips inhaling andsmoke swirling flashing through my brain.<br />The beautiful musical score plays an integral role in the storytelling as well, aside from its obvious role as a requiem. Not since \\"Pink Floyd's The Wall\\" have I seen the music exactly match what you're witnessing visually, until now. The strings express such haunting sadness in the main overture, and frantic, Psycho-like melodies play as terrorizing images flash onscreen. The score is played by a string quartet, which can represent the four main characters. It is also divided up into three, very symbolic movements, just like the movie is: Summer, Fall, and Winter.<br />I highly recommend you see this movie, especially if you like dark films like me. I just advise you watch it in a sober state, unless you want to get freaked out of your mind really badly. This movie will affect you by itself. I'm scared of even just thinking about heroin right now.
B000003N7G|5.0|I came to Love Supreme from the album recorded by John McLaughlin and Carlos Santana - Love Devotion Surrender - that paid tribute to a saxophonist that at the age of 16 or so I hadn't heard of. Nearly three decades later, John Coltrane's 'Love Supreme' still speaks to me with an sensuality and spirituality that expresses both restlessness and peace. It's not so much the technique but the creative fire - of a quartet inspired by Coltrane's genius - that made this record so timeless and so wonderful. Surely one of the greatest pieces of music in jazz.
0671027573|5.0|Ohmy[...] This is the first time in a long while that a book has captivated me like this & the first time in a while that I have laughed this much.  Also, there was definitely no skimming paragraphs in this one.  However, halfway through, it got serious.... really serious.... psycho-killer type serious.... main characters dying type serious.  I can't say that it was a great mystery because the psycho was somewhat obvious to me about 3/4's of the way through the book, but it did have a weird twist at the end that had kept me guessing.  The romance was also great  [...].  Sam & Jaine's dialogue was lol funny.  I loved the fact that they didn't hate each other til the end of the book & then decided they loved each other... those type stories always irritate me.  It also had a couple of side stories of couples & their relationships - those weren't too evolved, but did add to the story.  I guess it would have been just too long & drawn out if LH had added too much more to their stories.  All in all, this is a must read for those who can stand a little murder & love fun romances.  It's not often that an author can wrap up this much fun with such a serious plot & make me like it.  LH has definitely done that.  I'm definitely going to pick up another Linda Howard book & I hope I've now found a new favorite author to read.
B0000634EV|5.0|I'm a child of the South myself, so this has nostalgic value. These days, on humid summer evenings, it's nice to take this out to the front porch along with a six-pack and reminisce of the good old days as a kid in Texas. Nostalgia and childhood memories aside, Down II does evoke feelings of bayou culture, swamps, smoked salmon, po' boys, and a certain leafy substance whose name escapes me now. Light years beyond NOLA, in musicianship, diversity, and lyrics. Although NOLA had some amazing gems like &quot;Rehab,&quot; and &quot;Stone The Crow,&quot; Down II is the better album in my opinion. The whole album is a 70's-meets album. Imagine Deep Purple mixed with Skynyrd, and toss in some Sabbath-style sludge for good measure. That's the sound of the album. Even the title is a reference to Zeppelin's &quot;Stairway To Heaven.&quot;<br />I'm done rambling. Down to business. After six long years, the who's-who of metal decided to get back together, bringing Rex on to replace the previous bassist. Phil, Pepper, Kirk, Jimmy Bower--the whole gang, and new producer Warren Riker, all headed into an old barn on Phil's vast property down in Louisiana called 'Nosferatu's Lair.' They spent 28 days with rented equipment, some weird 60's porn, and plenty o' the leaf, and cranked out this mofo. <br />&quot;Lysergik Funeral Procession&quot; kicks the album off with a 70's metal bang and a memorable riff to boot. The production is a lot less 'metal' this time, and more 'hard rock,' with plenty of other quirky musical effects, from a Hammond B3 to a 1930's steel guitar. Blues and country are further explored, evidenced by amazing songs like &quot;Where I'm Going,&quot; and &quot;Stained Glass Cross.&quot; A weird interlude and a drum n' bass jam, and well as a few folksy/bluesy jams are also tossed into the mix. Phil sings through 96% of this album, and it's great to hear his clean voice instead of the cat-in-blender thing we get with Superjoint Ritual and Pantera. Pepper tosses in a backup vocal here and there as well. The metallic numbers are still rockin'. &quot;Dog Tired&quot; and &quot;New Orleans&quot; are two good examples.<br />My fave cut would have to be &quot;Ghosts Along The Mississippi,&quot; just for the title, and the song happens to be amazing as a plus, with a sick tempo change at the end and great solo. There's plenty on here to like, mind you. It's over an hour of tripped out music, and I love it. Most fans were let down, but I find it much superior to NOLA, and reckon folks should get this one first to partake in the glory before moving on to NOLA.<br />Shout it with me now: &quot;Perfection of the Seed!&quot;
B000002UQJ|5.0|I've been a Beatles/Paul McCartney fan since I was young (the first CDs my parents ever bought were the Beatles' \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" and Paul's first solo album, \\"McCartney\\"). My parents introduced me to Paul's and the Beatles' music when I was about six, and I've loved it ever since.<br />Unfortunately, I haven't, as yet, heard very much of Paul's work with Wings, except for \\"Ram\\" and the songs on \\"All The Best\\", but I have heard all of his late 80's and 90's work. This album is definitely a stand-out among his 90's stuff. It has a lot of great rockers (the title track, \\"Looking For Changes\\" which is Paul's and Linda's expression of their feelings about animal abuse, \\"Biker Like An Icon\\" which, though its lyrics aren't some of Paul's most creative, has a great beat and rhythm, and \\"Get Out Of My Way\\", which has slightly fluffy lyrics, but , like \\"Biker\\", is musically excellent) and several beautiful ballads. Paul's songwriting is pretty consistent, and the musical arrangements of the songs are great. There are a couple of weak spots here and there, but they do little to take away from the strength of this album.<br />My most favorite songs off the album are the ballads- \\"I Owe It All To You\\", \\"Golden Earth Girl\\", and \\"Winedark Open Sea\\". \\"I Owe It All To You\\" is a great love song in the same vein as \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\", and some of the imagery is great ('I stood inside Egyptian temples, I looked into eternal gardens, Lay on the shores of distant islands, Listening to the sea birds song of joy')! \\"Golden Earth Girl\\" is, in my opinion, the most gorgeous song on here. Paul's lyrics are a veritable work of poetry, his vocals and piano work are excellent, and the instrumental solos at the end of the song are beautiful (I'm not exactly sure what instruments were used, but they really added a lot to the song's sound). \\"Winedark Open Sea\\" is another beautiful love song, and along with \\"I Owe It All To You\\" and the early 70's-era \\"My Love\\" & \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\", is, I think, Paul'smost heartfelt expression of his love for Linda.<br />I also really like the title track and the songs \\"Hope Of Deliverance\\", \\"The Lovers That Never Were\\", \\"Peace In The Neighborhood\\", and \\"C'mon People\\". The title track is a great, upbeat rocker. I love the fact that the guitar work on \\"Hope Of Deliverance\\" is completely acoustic; it gives the song a great sound. The metaphoric nature of  some of the lyrics in \\"The Lovers That Never Were\\" ('All of the clocks have run down. Time's at an end. If we can't be lovers we'll never be friends') is very good; they're an excellent way to structure a warning to a significant other who is hesitant about becoming dedicated to forming a relationship. \\"Peace In The Neighborhood\\" is a great commentary on the way human society is. \\"C'mon People\\" has a hopeful, thought-provoking message that people need to take note of in this current day and age.<br />Musically, and in many cases, lyrically, this is a great effort from Paul. I would definitely recommend including this in a collection as one of his later albums.
0448060191|5.0|Wow.  I thought that Little Women was going to be another boring old classic or literature book, but I was wrong.  The adventures of the four girls (or little women, whose last name I've forgotten, which is typical of me, haha, but I think that it started with an 'M') are sweet and sincere, to me, haha, and I found this book sad, interesting, funny, and plain good.  It touched me.  Read this book, I say, everyone! And I know that this isn't a very thorough review, but reviews are for opinions, and that's my opinion...
B00005JKCH|5.0|This has been a favorite in my library since I got it. Not only does it treat an american pop-culture icon with the respect that it deserves, it is one of the most well balanced action-adventure movies to come out in a long time. <br />This is what happens when a fan gets a hold of the material and does it right. Sure there is action, but an action flick is just flash and explosion without strong characters behind it. Sam Raimi is the perfect choice for the film. His Hitchcock like style and tongue-in-cheek humor lends itself well to Spider-Man. He has never been conventional, and he doesent disappoint here either. <br />Tobey MacGuire is also an ideal choice as Peter Parker, Spider-Mans alter ego. The movie never lets you forget that there is a awkward teenager underneath that suit, and in order to pull that off, you need a decent actor. Yes there could have been others but I shiver to think what would happen if Freddie Prinze Jr. got the role.<br />Willem Defoe was also aptly cast as Norman Osbourne a.k.a. The Green Goblin. But it also brings me to the only real issue I had with the film. His costume and I am being very picky. I loved Defoe's performance and see the reasoning why that the way that they did, but I was hoping for something a little bit more organic and less high-tech.<br />Kirsten Dunst also does a good job as Mary Jane Watson, Peter Parkers love interest and I was surprised at the depth and maturity that went into the performance.<br />But the show stealers are Cliff Robertson as Uncle Ben and J.K. Simmons and J. Jonah Jamison. Even the most skeptic Marvel die hards will agree that these two knocked out of the park. No matter how many times I have watched this, I always am amazed by them.<br />The DVD is very impressive. The favorite feature of mine is the pop up option for the movie. It's the same as \\"VH1's Pop-Up Videos\\" just done with a feature film. Very informative and funny. The is also a commentary which is okay and you can also choose to have a spider icon option than, when it shows on the lower right of the screen, you press enter and a behind the scenes vignette shows up. Very similar to \\"Moulin Rouge\\" and \\"X-Men 1.5.\\" The difference being, while still distracting, these vignettes are actuall interesting to watch. There are two music videos, concept art, and an interview with Spider-Man creator Stan Lee. Not to mention a really cool short featuring Todd MacFarlane and John Romita Jr. Two legendary Spider-man artists. My wife, who is not a comics fan, was surprised how much she liked the bonus material. So for you non-believers, this is a great way to see why the wall crawler has such a widespread and loyal fan base. <br />All in all a really well put together film with a really well put together DVD. The only thing I would say is that parents of young kids should really heed the rating on this one. A film that you will feel compelled to watch over and over.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I have been a Zeppelin fan since 1978 and unfortunately never got to see them live.  This DVD is simply unbelievable and I am recommending it for every Zep fan.  This shows the true power of the band and how tight they were as a group.
B00008J2DQ|3.0|I took a chance in buying the CD since none of their new songs are really that popular in this part of the world. I've been listening to Godsmack ever since I heard their headbanging song 'Whatever' a couple of years ago. I must say that this album is definitely an improvement in terms of their music. Sully's voice is much angrier and the riffs are heavier. But I guess I'm still looking for that hit that one song that will elevate this album. But overall, it's still a good album!
B000000W5B|2.0|I'm an avid fan of the Stones, and I cannot in good conscious recommend &quot;Goat's Head Soup&quot; to anyone other than completists or frequent party casualties.  I bought the album in order to plug the gap in my collection between &quot;Exile on Main Street&quot; and &quot;Some Girls&quot;, and while I do not regret my purchase, I consider it more of a novelty item than a serious listening experience.  This album was recorded in Jamaica in the early 1970s, for Keef's sake, yet where is the reggae influence (which was sonically evident on the next two Stones albums)?!?  Mick, Keef and company must have had the radios off while they were sampling the local ganja...   <br />I can listen to classic Stones albums such as &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; or &quot;Out of Our Heads&quot; many times over without them losing their edge.  In contrast, &quot;Goat's Head Soup&quot;  sounds eternally stale and unprofound.  The only time I feel it works as an album is when I have consumed too much the night before and am lying on the floor wanting to get up but unable to do so.  It is only then that the song cycle works: as an uninspired journey through the murkiness of a hangover with the final track &quot;Star Star&quot; as the lewd light at the end of the tunnel...<br />On a final note, it's a shame that the actual illustration of &quot;Goat's Head Soup&quot; isn't on the album cover, but is instead relegated to the back of the liner notes.  Albums with goats on the cover (think &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;) have tended to be among an artist's best work, though even this formula would have done little to save the Stones' &quot;Goat's Head Soup&quot; from the stale stench of consumption-inspired mediocrity...
B00008OWZC|5.0|I think this is an excellent live CD put out by Led Zep. Considering that Zeppelin has put out so little since the band's demise, we need to jump with joy at what does get put out!<br />And this triple CD contains some awesome, powerful performances. Yes, it is a selection of tracks taken from two different concerts, Long Beach and LA Forum respectively, but Page chose to feature the best performances and the small edits he made on certain tracks don't distract at all from the music.<br />This is a fantastic release and every Zep fan should be creaming in their pants to finally get some new LIVE ZEP!!!!!
0553213105|5.0|If you are like I was before reading this wonderful book, you probably can't imagine what could be so wonderful about Pride and Prejudice.  How can it be interesting, you're thinking, when it's written in such a stuffy time period? I'll stick with my science fiction/romance novels/westerns, thank you very much. And it's true, you can't find any lusty young rogues, aliens, or gun fights, but that doesn't keep it from being an extremely wonderful book to read. The characters are full of life, the plot well constructed, and the entire story full of charm and humour. Don't be put off by the language either. It takes some getting used to, but once you're going it's not only completely natural, but makes today's English seem completely dull and simple.  I cannot stress enough how wonderful this book is. (By the way, in case you think I'm someone who thinks a 'good time' is a trip to the museum or a riveting game of chess, I'm not. I take sick pride in my love of the uncultured, but even I can't help but love this book.) Once more, with feeling: Don't avoid this book because of the time period it's written in.
0679737456|1.0|Black Ice is a badly written memoir.  Though I am an avid reader, I found myself struggling to get through this work.  Not only does it lack insight into her situation, Cary consistently practiced poor word choice in her writing, leaving the reader wondering what her intention was.  I also question Cary's editors at Vintage Books--why did they allow her to leave in page after page of lackluster prose describing the minutia of her life? (i.e., pp.60-61 in which Cary describes dropping her soap) I am shocked that reviewer Arnold Rampersad and the Washington Post Book World placed Cary in the same league as Maya Angelou and Richard Wright.  Having recently read Ron Suskind's Hope in the Unseen which was a fabulous nonfiction book about a young African American's struggle to fit into life at Brown University, I was disappointed that this coming-of-age offered such little insight into Cary's inner world.
0062502182|5.0|The negative reviews written here unfortunately surprise me.  I found this book to be an excellent fable with symbolism that can be applied to real life.<br />This book teaches you that hope is something to cling to and that when all seems lost, if you give every ounce of effort to one last try, you will make it.  It teaches you that to be observant and to listen to words and omens and symbols, you can understand that the Divine speaks with you.  He always does -- we just don't always listen.  It also teaches that when we think we have lost one treasure, there is always a greater one on the horizon.  It really is mostly about faith in oneself and God.<br />This book seems simple in it's storytelling, but breaking down the conversations and lessons actually makes me pull out a legal pad and jot down information to ponder; this book made me think and is one that I'll be referencing for sometime.<br />As for omens, well, let me just tell you that a friend had recommended this book to me awhile ago and I thought: &quot;Well, I'll pick it up sometime later.&quot;  Two weeks went by and I didn't.  Well, one night I was walking up to my apartment and on the ground right in front of me was: &quot;The Alchemist.&quot;  Someone had dropped it on the street and didn't notice.  So I picked it up, brought it home and read it.<br />Was this an omen that I was to read this book and receive clarity in my life?  I'd like to think so.  But, that's what I've learned.  You'll probably have to read the book yourself and come up with your own interpretation.  All I know is I'm glad I acted on that &quot;omen&quot; and read it.
B000000W5B|2.0|I'm an avid fan of the Stones, and I cannot in good conscious recommend \\"Goat's Head Soup\\" to anyone other than completists or frequent party casualties. I bought the album in order to plug the gap in my collection between \\"Exile on Main Street\\" and \\"Some Girls\\", and while I do not regret my purchase, I consider it more of a novelty item than a serious listening experience. This album was recorded in Jamaica in the early 1970s, for Keef's sake, yet where is the reggae influence (which was to be sonically evident on the next two Stones albums)?!? Mick, Keef and company must have had the radios off while they were sampling the local ganja... <br />I can listen to classic Stones albums such as \\"Beggars Banquet\\" or \\"Out of Our Heads\\" many times over without them losing their edge. In contrast, \\"Goat's Head Soup\\" sounds eternally stale and uninteresting. The only time I feel it works as an album is when I have consumed too much the night before and am lying on the floor wanting to get up but unable to do so. It is only then that the song cycle works: as a banal journey through the murkiness of a hangover with the final track \\"Star Star\\" as the lewd light at the end of the tunnel...<br />On a final note, it's a shame that the actual illustration of \\"Goat's Head Soup\\" isn't on the album cover, but is instead relegated to the back of the liner notes. Albums with goats on the cover (think \\"Pet Sounds\\") have tended to be among an artist's best work, though even this formula would have done little to save the Stones' \\"Goat's Head Soup\\" from the stale stench of consumption-inspired mediocrity...
B00008OWZC|5.0|In the past I had been only a casual listener and fan of Led Zeppelin's music. Sure, every once in a while, when I was in the mood,I'd pull out 'Houses of the Holy' or the 'runes/Zoso' album. They're great albums, but were they nothing I went nuts about. Well, that all changed last week.I had read tons of media hype about how a new Led Zepplin CD of past live material was going to be released and once and for all prove, they were the best live band of the '70s. Curious, I decided to check it out and buy the CD. Guess what I found out? IT SURE AINT HYPE!!!! When I put \\"How the West Was Won\\" on the CD player I was totally bowled over! This CD makes the Stone's \\"Get Out Yer Ya-Yas\\" (my now former favorite live album) sound like a Sunday picnic. You know the scene at the church in \\"The \\"Blues Brothers Movie\\", where Belushi starts yelling out \\"I see the Light!!\\". Well thats how this album was for me! Never had I heard such an audacious brew of hard rock, blues and celtic folk all mixed together to create something so raw, heated and original.The first thing I did after my initial listening of this rock n'roll masterpiece was run out and purchase the companion DVD simply titled \\"Led Zeppelin\\". That baby is fantastic also! I've been wearing out both the CD and DVD players with both these titles for the past couple of days. Now its time to reassess all my Zeppelin CDs and start looking for imports. If you havn't bought \\"How the West Was Won\\" yet, all I can say is... STOP WASTING TIME AND BUY IT!!!
6305546789|4.0|this is by far John Carpenters best movie.A psychotic killer escapes from a mental hospital and returns to his old neighborhood, He begins stalking local teenage girls untill he strikes with a vengeance during Halloween night. Very scary with lots of suspense. Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie is terrific as the killers prime target,Donald Pleasence as DR. Loomis is good as the psychiatrist hunting his patient and pj soles as Lynda standsout amongst the rest of the actors.
B00006RIO7|4.0|This one stands up to the best of the great musical soundtracks of the 50's through the 70's, the heyday of the musical.  If only they'd left off the last two songs, it would be worth 5 stars, or even more.  The Queen Latifah-Lil' Kim rap version of &quot;He Had it Comin'&quot; is grating, too modern after all that great old fashioned jazz, and the Anastacia &quot;Love is a Crime&quot; just plain doesn't fit.<br />But Renee Zellweger, Richard Gere, and Catherine Zeta-Jones prove not only competant but fabulous, perfect voices to match their characters.  Queen Latifah belts out &quot;When You're Good to Mama&quot; (my favorite song), and &quot;Mister Cellophane&quot; is both sweet and sad.  <br />If you're a fan of musicals, especially the big MGM showy ones, you need this soundtrack, and the DVD and/or video as well.
B00006JJ1O|1.0|Wow...2 faux lesbian Russian girls with all the passion of a Jenna Jameson shower scene...thanks to libidos worldwide Tatu has become somewhat of a household name....and there was much wailing and gnashing of teeth....though the girls can sing, as much as 2 lesbian teen pop-stars with a fondness for plaid skirts need to, the lyrics, written by middle-aged men are trite and played out even in the candy-coated realm of pop music...some of the more techno-oriented tracks are veritable club hits but as a whole the album makes a better coaster than anything...seriously, what do you think my glass is resting on right now?.....music aside, the girls are quite good at making out in front of cameras and wearing plaid skirts though I must say that Traci Lords did it 1st and better....a friend tells me that one of them, the one with the short hair is a trained in piano...well, as far as I can tell, she never plays once on that album....I guess they don't have classes on how to wear a bra and briefs on stage....I must give credit to the guy who thought this up....I'm sure he's laughing all the way to the bank...I know I would...and the smiths cover is the icing on the cake for me, or should I say the air bubble in my vein....if Hell needed a soundtrack, this and anything done by the Bay City Rollers would be it....
0609610570|1.0|When this book is read in conjunction with &quot;Good to Great&quot; and &quot;Built to Last&quot;, the messages contained in the book are much easier to understand.
0920668372|5.0|I loved this book ever since i heard someone doing it as an oral language festival when i was in grade school. and now since I've had a son of my own . I read this story to him nightly and never get tired of it. It's great story from the mother's prosepctive as her one and only grows though the years. I find it touching to the heart and now I almost have it memorized. And to say it again this book is a wonderful story for all mom's to get and read to their babies and toddlers.
B00005JLXE|1.0|Quite possibly the worst adaptation, of any medium, in film.<br />Many have claimed that this version of Daredevil is, in fact, a true depiction of the character.  This, more than anything else, is an insult to one of the few complex characters Marvel has managed to produce.  Although there were a number of scenes that were taken straight from the comics, ala Spider-Man, unlike said movie the spirit of the character was lost.<br />For those of you that are not familiar with the character, Matt Murdock is a New York lawyer granted heightened senses and a \\"radar sense\\" from the accident that left him blinded.  Dedicated to an ideal of justice, Daredevil struggles in a hopeless battle - to effect change within his own microcosm, the section of New York known popularly as Hell's Kitchen.  In such a hopeless situation Murdock lives purely from his ethics, an unshakable belief in the legal system and a faith in man's ability for redemption.  He adopts the guise of the devil to remind man what waits for him if he doesn't change his ways and even after stopping criminals he defends them in court - to ensure they recieve fair treatment, even if they're the worst murderers, rapists and scoundrels.<br />Although the character has lapses in this unrealistic ideology as he's constantly barraged with proof of the meaninglessness of his struggle, the corruption of the legal system and the crumbling of his personal life, he heroically continues to strive for a better world.  The archetypical struggle of man's ethics vs. his enviroment.<br />Now, let's face the reality of this movie.  Matt Murdock is a prosecuting attorney that, when he can't win a case against criminals he knows are guilty, murders them.  He's motivated by a hatred for the \\"scum\\" who run the streets and is a cold, passionless man who hides out in his secret headquarters waiting to gain revenge on his enemies.<br />...  Is this what I waited years for?  The acting is dismal, a supporting cast of complex characters reduced to one-dimensional laugh-offs and senseless violence.  Some of comic's best scribes (include Miller, Nocenti and Bendis) have spent years creating a symbol for Everyman, and we get this.  ...
B000005DQR|5.0|This is Dj Shadows best work with the exception of &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot; -and thats mainly due tpo  PS' inclusion of &quot;In/flux . &quot;  While the tempos are slow (for dance music /electronica)  This is not a chillout record. THE dRUMS SLAM TOO HARD TO chill. He does some drum programming here thats amazing  !  Its even more amazing when you considere he chopped his samples manually on an mpc and didnt use REcycle ( a program that chopps drum samples automatically according to beat transients)!
B000001GQJ|5.0|Martha Argerich took the piano world by storm with her brand of aggressive, expressive piano playing coupled with brilliant technique and all of these qualities are on display here. She has achieved a reputation as one of the finest interpreters of Romantic Music and perhaps the first signs of this can be seen in this wonderful debut recording.<br />The programme is wonderfully varied with Chopin, Brahms, Prokofiev and Lizst. Argerich, with her win at the 1965 Chopin Piano Competition is well-known for her Chopin and this shows in her excellent rendition of the Scherzo where she manages to convey a wealth of different emotions in a short piece but I have to agree that the best pieces on this CD are the Brahms rhapsodies. There are few finer recordings that this and it shows Argerich at her most dynamic and interpretive.<br />This CD has been a bestseller since its release and justifiably so. It is mind-boggling to realize that Argerich was only 19 when this recording was made and perhaps another reason to marvel at this incredible performance.
0930289234|5.0|You can call Don Quixote the greatest and last knight book of medieval times. You can call Watchmen the greatest and the last comic book from the modern era. Everything after this book is post-modern, post-analog-inking, post-Watchmen.<br />The story is a complex tangle of killings and conspiracy. The superheroes who got old after years of service for the government are being murdered one by one. If a superguy is immortal, no problem, there's always a way to get him wiped out.<br />These super-heroes have to deal with the greatest villian alive (I'm not going to tell you who's the one, you have to get this friggin' book) and the greatest world-destruction conspiracy. They also have to deal with the police and their personal problems.<br />In a world of superheroes who get old or are capable of killing people with no remorse, the comic books are flooded with pirate stories.<br />I was reading this book on september 10th, 2001. I bought it in august. And the last chapter -chapter 12- is a macabre representation of the day after. This book is a prophetic masterpiece and has to be used as a reference of what the state can do to the common man.
0316666343|3.0|I would have preferred that the narrative device of having a murder and rape victim tell her own story not have been used.  To me, it felt like a gimmick and detracted from the truly interesting exploration of the effect of this horror on those left behind.  Ms. Sebold's treatment of the family and community members and the dynamics between them rings true to me.  The insertion of this 'magical' element strikes a false note.
B00005JLH3|4.0|This is a great movie with fantastic musical talent and the trailers and special scenes show how much effort went into making this production. The story line is guessable which is the only thing holding this back from 5 stars, but the appreciation of music as a sport and the talent that is represented in the show is incredible. The &quot;drum offs&quot; which pit school against school showcase the amazing skill that musicians have and the importance of cadence and comradery in building teams, confidence and sportsmanship. This movie goes to show that you don't have to be the star quarterback or the all star 3 point shooter to get the babes....
B00005JLEU|5.0|Wow.Spirited Away is an amazing movie and it blew me away.This is top notch anime,and it is one of the greatest movies of all time,period.The animation is excellent,too and if you are only used to watching the typical Disney like animated films then you will be amazed at how different and cool this movie is.Don't rent Spirited Away,buy it.You won't regret it if you do.<br />I give this movie a perfect 5 out of 5 stars.
0780631684|3.0|I will sum this up in  a sentence or two. The plot was good....I loved the idea of what they wanted to do. But they didn't do a good job of it. I can't see how it was \\"scary\\" though...it's really not that type of movie. More suspense than scary. It is worth watching to kill (no pun intended) an evening, but it won't leave anyone with  much other than \\"oh...I've seen worse as well as better.\\"
0446310786|5.0|Anyone who hasn't read this classic novel should read it.  Harper Lee tells a wonderful story, through through the memories of a child, passing important lessons on to the reader about growing up, overcoming fears and prejudices, trusting others, fairness and justice.  The story is told with wit, charm and grace.  It addresses the problem of racism in a way that exposes its evil and ugliness while also illuminating and nurturing the dignity possessed by all human beings.  If you've only seen the classic movie (starring Gregory Peck) you know much of the story, but you've missed quite a lot in the telling.  The movie can only be fully appreciated by those who have first come to know and love its characters through having read the book.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Most music today is claustrophobic. This project is skillful but simple. The simplicity of the work is remarkable. When was the last time you heard a drummer play a set with brushes? When is the last time you heard musicians respect each other's space and not compete for dominance? This is a wonderful cd that teaches us to respect every musician. Each is heard. Each part fits together like a jigsaw puzzle. The songs are great. The arrangements are great. The musicians are great. Norah's vocals are unbelievable. The cd is a classic. Come away and be enchanted by this wondeful project. Come away and breathe the free air.
B000058983|5.0|In short, it is a great album due to its psychedelic sound, smooth flowing sound, interesting lyrics, and great vocals and guitar playing. Need I say more?
B00008J4P5|1.0|I can't imagine why anyone would buy this...sounds the same as there last CD. The musicians still can't play and the songs lack any real thought. These two could stand to take some music lessons!
0805062971|5.0|by destroying it! You won't find a better manual for seeing what's wrong with the world. The epitome of nihilistic compassion, or whatever you want to call it. Jam-packed with more mind-blowing ideas than any book ever written. The movie is also amazing and is NOT just about dudes beating the crap out of each other. Buy them both! Now!
B000002ADT|5.0|This is simply one of the best jazz recordings ever. The music is stunning. The musicians were in the zone. Someone captured music at its best. Kind of Blue is the kind of classic that modern ears need to hear to understand that music is about the equilibrium of sound and silence in time.
B00005M91K|5.0|A remarcable movie about world, humanity, unity in diversity, spirituality and search for a meaning, &quot;as is&quot;, with the pluses and minuses of ourselves. No politics, race, religion, no comments and no words at all. If you feel you're not happy and content with your life, see this movie. A must have!
B00005JLEU|5.0|revealed how Miyazaki and his young &amp; talented team struggled to created this masterpiece. What was most interesting was how Miyazaki conveyed his traditional view and artistic technicques to these younger generations. In one point, he asked the team if anyone knew how a dog would show his teeth. No one did, so he took them to an animal hospital to observe dogs. All these little stories make the bonus disc very entertaining... but watch it only after watching the movie.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I'm 33 years old, and was a huge Zep fan from my mid teens to mid 20s. Buying this DVD set brings it all back into focus for me now and reminds me why Zepplin -- hands down -- was the greatest blues rock band ever created.<br />Listening and watching what they threw down in the late 60s and 70s in 2003 makes you realize just how devoid of power and passion the music industry in general is today. Today's music is marketing. Zeppelin flies in the face of that -- they were all about the music and playing live. I wish I could have been at one of these shows -- the DVD comes damn close to making you feel like you were there.<br />I can only hope that the DVD set and the 3CD live package will start another blues/rock groundswell that refocuses the music buying public's attention on the music -- not the marketing.
B00008PX8P|5.0|If there was any doubt left as to the sheer greatness of Led Zeppelin, this DVD puts it to rest. The sound and picture quality are beyond description and the performances are top notch. My personal favorite of all the shows is the Knebworth '79. Hearing &quot;Achilles Last Stand&quot; and &quot;In the Evening&quot; blew me away. Plus, after seeing how this band performed with John Bonham behind the drums, I can now see why they have never officially reunited. Who could possibly fill his shoes? The only downside to the DVD is that it leaves you wanting more, and wondering what might have been had &quot;Bonzo&quot; not passed away long before his time. Had Led Zeppelin been able to continue, they would officially be the World's Greatest Rock and Roll Band, not the Stones.
B00008OLIC|1.0|These guys started out as rock 'n' roll heroes, then ended up being rock 'n' roll zeroes!!  Simply put, this Motley Crue album is over-produced, too glitzy and extremely cheesy - extra cheese with Velveeta on top!!<br />It peaks at \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" and then goes nowhere fast.  Neil sounds like a screechy, annoying punk, while the rest of the boys in Crue sound way past their prime.  It's too bad, too.  These guys could have been legends, but they squandered it all away on a few blonde chicks and free cocaine.  <br />Like the \\"Behind the Music\\" special on them fully broadcast, Motley Crue went from rock 'n' roll heroes to rock 'n' roll zeroes in a matter of days...<br />I HOPE THE NEXT ONE'S BETTER!!!!<br />OUT!!!!
0780631684|5.0|An excellent movie and different from the typical teen slasher flicks except in this, you minus the slasher. Final Destination is entertaining with lots of thrills. Good cast equals good performances and the story may not be real like non-existant, but seems so realistic and is clever. The entertaining and unsuspecting thrills makes the whole movie fun including the gruesome elaborate deaths. And how the story falls in2 place, it's smart and interesting. The dark humor in this movie also makes the film worthwhile. It's worth the cash.<br />After 5 students (on their way 2 paris for a class trip) gets kicked off from Flight 180 after one seeing a premonition of a brutal plane crash. From their on, survivors get offed one after another unepectedly. As \\"death\\" has a plan and is out 2 get the rest of the survivors. These signs and weird feelings appear before the deaths of these lives which makes the movie interesting and more fun. Soon they realize that they can't cheat death.<br />This is a ride you want 2 take. Thrills around every corner and loads of fun. A little violent but hey, it's not as gory as the sequel! Turn the lights off and get ready 2 be on the edge of your seat. <br />***** (5 stars)
B000001FS3|5.0|I'm writing this review simply because ...  <br />The Joshua Tree was so unbelievably counter-culture and is deeper and more meaningful ...  Those of you kids from the 80s will recall that this album came out during the deluge of hair bands ...  Suddenly U2 puts out this gospel-influenced, intensely personal, yet humble work.  I remember lying on my bed in my dorm room listening to it again and again.  What is, perhaps, most amazing is that the lyrics, with few exceptions, are so uplifting.  No sex, drugs, or violence.  Just pure introspection.<br />My favorite song is \\"Without You.\\"  It is a perfect song:  the dynamics are spectacular, the thematic flows perfectly with the formal, the metaphors right on point . . . I just can't give enough superlatives.<br />... The Joshua Tree is timeless.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|A fun and funny movie, Shrek delivers us with good fun! This movie is a great family movie ... Entertaining and smart is what 2 say about this movie. The characters in this movie is so funny. Can be a little disgusting at times but- hey, that's half the fun! The DVD is loaded with lots of extras. The movie is great and it's on a great DVD!<br />Shrek is a ogre that everyone's afraid of. He ends up meeting a talking donkey with a sense of humor who follows him on a journey 2 try and save a fiesty, knows how to kick some butt, princess 2 get his swamp(home, privacy) back. But on the quest he finds out a little secret about the princess that's well- funny!<br />Great family entertainment. Loads of fun! Loads of laughs! It's a good one from Dreamworks! <br />***** (5 stars)
B000001DYJ|5.0|YOU WANTED THE BEST, YOU GOT THE BEST, THE HOTTEST BAND IN THE WORLD....KISS!!!  <br />That opener to the concerts is as true today as it was when it was first uttered, nearly 3 decades ago.  KISS has had so much influence on so many of today's bands, its hard to argue that they are not the best.  <br />KISS chooses some of best from thier career at that time.  Songs like Rock'n'Roll all nite, Unholy, Creatures of the night, Lick it Up, God gave Rock and Roll to You II, and the Star Spangled Banner, KISS cements themselves as not only of the greatest rock bands of all time, but as one of the partiotic as well.  <br />Well Worth your money.
0792844882|3.0|After getting this movie more or less accidentally, I decided I mind as well watch it.. see what the hype (or lack thereof) is about.<br />Overall, this movie isn't that great.  The acting is actually quite average.. nothing special, but certainly not horrible.. this was probably the thing that surprised me most... I was expecting acting on par with a (bad) porno.<br />Somehow, they managed to make the nudity (and there's a good bit of it in the movie) completely nonsexual .. even the scenes where there's actual sex going on.  How they did this, I have no idea.<br />I could concievably imagine a story similar to this happening in the real world, which is the other thing about the movie that <BR>surprised me.  I expected it to have the believeability of a badly written 1950's science fiction movie.  So, this was a nice surprise.<br />If they'd used decent actors, and even if everything else had stayed the same, they may've actually had a good movie to show for it.
B000001FA4|5.0|Very different than U2's previous three studio albums, Unforgettable Fire gave us softer, more melodic renderings such as &quot;Bad,&quot; &quot;Elvis Presley and America,&quot; a lullaby called \\"MLK,\\" and even an instrumental piece, &quot;4th of July.&quot;  With Unforgettable Fire, the band stops with the disenchanted- youth thing (which is a good gig for while, as their albums Boy and War proved, but can grow tiresome after a time) and breaks into the meaningful social-consciousness stuff we know and love them for.  This album was the fitting prequel to probably the best album of all time, \\"The Joshua Tree\\" (it actually finishes \\"MLK\\" with the same bass-line note that JoshuaTree begins with (\\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\"). <br />At first, I wasn't quite sure what to make of this album because it contains one super-hit (\\"Pride - In the Name of Love\\") and a lot of musical experimentation.  Then I figured it out:  just like Joshua Tree, this album was meant to be listed to wholly.  Sure, you can listen to \\"Pride\\" and \\"Bad\\" individually, but I highly recommend listening to the album cover to cover.  What you will find if you do is elated mourning - loss of beloved friend, parent, visionary, home, mixed-in with an exuberance you would never expect for such things.  Plus, there are many, many recurrent themes to be discovered that come out again and again in later works.  I hear something new ever time I listen.<br />If Unforgettable Fire is not a masterpiece in its own right (and I think it is), it certainly is by proxy because it was the necessary step before Joshua Tree.
6305922756|5.0|Sorry.. had to sneak the most widely known phrase from Spinal Tap into my review somewhere.<br />To sum it up in one sentence:  This movie is awesome.<br />I've wanted to see Spinal Tap for years.. I was 9 when it came out, and wanted to see it then... my parents wouldn't let me.  I eventually forgot about it, and didn't have a chance to see it until 19 years later.  (I feel old now.)  At any rate, this movie is just superb, following the waning career of British heavy metal band Spinal Tap.  Filmed just like a documentary, this film is genius.  (Which explains why it didn't do very well in theatres.. the general populace tends to take fluff, such as Titanic, over genius.)<br />Before I watched, I was expecting it to be something like Airplane.. just insane, nutsy comedy constantly.. rather, I found something that mirrored a real documentary.. some of it seemed to be serious for a while, before descending into side splitting humor.  The music makes fun of other bands.. most notable to me is &quot;Stonehenge&quot;, which seems to be making fun and paying homage (at the same time) to Led Zeppelin.  Finally.. the most impressive part is that everyone learned to play the songs.. it's actually Christopher Guest, Harry Shearer and Michael McKean playing their instruments and singing... no bad dubovers or mouthing of lyrics.  This just added so much to the film itself.  (Indeed, they actually 'toured' several clubs for a few months prior to filming to work on their performance.)<br />I cannot possibly reccomend this film in any stronger terms.  An absolute must see, even if you hate this kind of music.
0385504209|5.0|The Da Vinci Code is a brilliant masterpiece which cleverly combines history, religion, and modern times, and ties them together in a speedy thriller.<br />  It begins when a renowned symbologist named Robert Langdon is called to the scene of a crime in the Paris Louvre museum.  He is told he was brought here so he can decipher a puzzle made with the body of the curator.<br />  Robert is shocked because of this alone but withing minutes he is racing away from the police he just helped.<br />  At the same time, he is learning of a dark secret which is slowly binding him to a conspiracy with the least likely person at its head.<br />  Wonderful book which I recommend for anyone older than 9
0790733226|5.0|In these times when Hollywood gives us so much ill-inspired pseudo-scientific and -technical bunk to wade our way through in the interest of entertainment, we also get this wonderful story by the late Dr. Sagan brought to decent special-effects life.  Though much of what we hear coming from the mouth of Dr. Arroway (Jodie Foster), as directed at Palmer Joss (McConaughey), is presented with such an attempt at persuasion as you'd find in the characters of an Ayn Rand novel, the basic story is that life is a precious possession, to be cherished for all it is at the present moment.  The relationship of Ellie to her father is one of profound loss, but she will not accept God's will as explanation:  \\"I should have kept the medicine in the downstairs bathroom--then I could have gotten to him faster\\".  We are really left wondering about just what the actual \\"phenomenon\\" is that we have witnessed, since evidence proves finally lacking for the rigorously-grounded scientist to follow.  Sagan's awareness of the kind of fringe groups that \\"are out there\\" is illustrated by the mass-celebration and -demonstration held outside the Very Large Array, even to include a chapter of the Chevy Vega collectors' association, in honor of the star that has finally heard our stray RF from the 1930's and sent back its reply.  The response of the Clinton administration (though I understand the clip of him giving a press conference was lifted from another context) in militarizing the project might even find support among the UFO conspiracy-types.  But Dr. Arroway does not care; she has taken up the banner of scientific inquiry and integrity, so she needs to tell \\"everyone\\".  The \\"machine\\" is exceptionally well-modeled for the screen, though we have to wonder about some of what is purported to go on when the capsule finally reaches the core.  We are given imagery to remind us of the transport in \\"2001:  A Space Odyssey\\", or as later seen in Neo's initiation via the Rabbit Hole in \\"The Matrix\\".  This is a highly-developed story about a variety of developments in its human characters.  We are left wondering, though...what COULD have taken place for those 18 hours?
B000068IEU|5.0|I personally I think this is a blinder of a movie. I grew up watching horror films from the age of 8. Don't worry I haven't turned into &quot;John Krug&quot;, if anything quite the opposite. Horror's have made me an all-rounded person, and i take them light-heartedly now. It is movies like this that I wish I had the opportunity of seeing when I was young. That may be a bad thing, seeing as though this movie is very sick in parts, but the one thing I always reminded myself when I was young, was movies were not real. In fact Arachnophobia scared me when I was 10 (and that was a PG) and then I was immune from horror movies for the rest of my life. I was ashamed that this movie was banned for 30 years in the UK, because I have seen a lot scarier films when I was 8! True what the four murderers do is absolutely disgusting, but afterwards we can relish in the parents getting their own back, which made me laugh and I loved every minute of it! This movie didnt scare me, but I thouroughly enjoyed it, the acting was superb and it is actually very funny in places. The sound isn't all that, but it actually gives it a documentary feel. It is a very true-to-life horror movie, which differentiates it from typical slasher movies and another thing to point out is that it is Wes Craven's debut. If you don't mind going back in time to relish in some good-old horror and you don't mind it of a true nature, OR that can tolerate violence to the extreme... then this should be in your possession RIGHT NOW! If you are a very sensitive college girl with a lot going for you, then I recommend you give it a miss! However be warned you are missing out on the best horror film ever made.
B00000K19E|5.0|I first went to see &quot;The Matrix&quot; at the theater in 1999, and at the point where Neo (Reeves) is taking his martial arts training with Morpheus (Fishburne), I decided that my mind was not in a condition that day to be blown, so I postponed watching the rest until a further date.  My attention span must have improved since then, for now I see a fantastic movie, all the way through.  The description of just what the Matrix is, while a bit lacking in solid technical details (what is &quot;Bio-Energy&quot;?  what does &quot;120 volts&quot; have to do with power?), answers the question in a way that is disturbingly hard to deny.  &quot;Why not?,&quot; the open-minded may argue.  Perhaps what we see is a literal presentation of the kind of backgrounding that is in fact already done on citizens and subjects of the world, through computer systems.  The day that sentience finally arises in the non-living will certainly be enough to chill the souls of the humans who are responsible.  It has all grown so complicated, that no one could really prevent such domination, if it had enough of its own will.  The idea that the human is ultimately the better...entity...is shown by motifs like the use of martial arts (&quot;I'm going to learn...Jiu Jitsu?&quot;).  <BR>If nothing else, we have one powerful metaphor for the way things &quot;really work&quot;, which is at a variety of levels and a variety of motivations.  Though reviews of the &quot;Reloaded&quot; sequel have been mixed, the original &quot;Matrix&quot; was one hard precedent to follow.  It will be on my list of films I can watch, over and over.
0060194995|5.0|I read \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" at about the age of 12, when it was first published. As an evocation of time and place, and as a story of childhood grappling with maturity, it is unexcelled. It truly deserves its status as a literary icon. Like Dante and Shakespeare, it will probably survive at least a couple of centuries.<br />But that doesn't mean it's beyond criticism. Why has no one ever pointed out that Atticus Finch does a lousy job defending his client?<br />He knows full well the kind of prejudice his client faces. But instead of basing his defense on the fact that a man without a right arm cannot blacken the right eye of another man -- and stopping there -- he decides to indict all of Southern society for its racism.<br />Dumb, dumb, dumb. Absolutely guar-on-TEED to get the guy convicted.<br />I wrote a letter to Harper Lee pointing this out, but she didn't reply.
B000002KKK|5.0|I canft argue with ZZ Top's decision to go slightly techno in Eliminator. Similar to Aerosmith's resurgence, it introduced them to a whole new, \\"younger\\" audience and propelled them to mass acceptance. They deserved all the kudos. While Eliminator is a good enough to stand on its own two feet, Deguello is more the heart and soul of ZZ Top. <br />One thing I've always admired about Billy Gibbons is his penchant for timely yet tasty riffs. He is a master of guitar phrasing and those who rely upon hitting a hundred notes as fast as they can, would do better taking Billy's example of restraint. They are a guitar band, no doubt, but the guitar is part of the overall song in terms of rhythm not full of long, redundant solos to highlight one's skills.    <br />I love every track on Deguello but I'm Bad I'm Nationwide, Lowdown in the Streets, and Fool for Your Stockings really do it for me. Not just a blues band, they always seem to have this \\"Boogie\\" groove to their music and results in a Southern-fried kind of sound. The lyrics and feel of I'm Nationwide, really sum up what ZZ Top is all about. Deguello is also an excellent driving selection. Who canft see themselves in a convertible with the top down on a hot summer evening listening to I Love My Automobile? <br />If you like unpretentious, straight ahead, Southern blues rock, Deguello will fit the bill very nicely indeed. For aspiring guitarists, make note of Billy's unique sense of timing.
B00007JVBI|3.0|Music is so subjective.  My two cents is that as much as I'd love to be into a singer with the pseudonym Cat Power, try as I might, I couldn't get into this album at all.  I'm into most of Amazon's \\"People who bought this also bought...\\" artists, so I thought I'd give Cat Power a try.<br />I experienced the first two songs as reflective, moody, fragile--a good beginning to an album.  To my dismay, I realized that the melancholy tone of the album perpetuated itself almost brutally.  I found subsequent songs to be slow and aimless.  I couldn't get a grasp on the mood the album was attempting to create (I spend enough time staving off \\"no-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel\\" depression to want to embrace an album that seems to build it almost deliberately).  But then, I've only ever been able to get through the first half of the album.  An acquired taste.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Over the course of Led Zeppelin's career, Jimmy Page often spoke of creating a chronological live Zeppelin album which would showcase the band in full flight.  Not only has Page done that with \\"How The West Was Won\\", he has released this monster.  This will make Zeppelin freaks remember why they fell in love with the band in the first place. <br />\\"Led Zeppein DVD\\" primarily consists of material from four concerts: Royal Albert Hall 1970, Madison Square Garden 1973, Earls Court 1975, and their final UK gigs at Knebworth in 1979.  Zeppelin was not the type of band that would do note-for-note renditions of their songs.  The band would often improvise new sections in the middle of a song.  Witness \\"Communication Breakdown\\" from Royal Albert Hall; Robert Plant starts belting out the Isley Brothers \\"It's Your Thing\\" right after a furious Page guitar solo.  Witness \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" from Madison Square Garden, which begins with a Page onslaught and features some great interplay between Plant and Page.  The footage from both of these shows is excellent, the sound prestine in Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound.<br />However, Earls Court will leave you breathless.  This section begins with a 3 song acoustic set which looks like it was recorded yesterday.  Plant is in great voice, and Page looks every inch the guitar god in his black dragon suit.  \\"In My Time Of Dying\\" is incredible.  John Paul Jones starts whipping out these furious bass runs while Page goes postal on slide guitar.  John Bonham is right there with Jones, doing fill after outrageous fill.  \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" is beautiful with split screen shots of Page in blue light and Plant's hair highlighted by a yellow spotlight.<br />Knebworth 1979 has more great footage.  \\"Achilles Last Stand\\" has to been seen and heard to be believed.  Page, although by this time is suffering through heroin addiction, pulls out all the stops on this epic, and the whole band pushes their skills to the limit and beyond.  \\"Kashmir\\" isawesome, as is their revamped version of \\"Whole Lotta Love\\".  Then, it's over.<br />This DVD shows why Zeppelin cannot reform without John Bonham, who died 13 months after the Knebworth concerts.  He is simply irreplacable; his drumming throughout the CD is powerful, concise, and quite fun to listen to.  Zeppelin wouldn't be a quarter of the band they were without Bonzo, and they know it.  Be thankful that Jimmy Page oversaw this DVD project and buy it now.  It's simply amazing.
B00005JL2O|4.0|Goldmember was mildly amusing, but the plot was really lame and Goldmember was just annoying... And I'm sorry... Beyonce Knowles CANNOT act... There are a lot of gals that would have made a better Foxy. Also, the cameos got really annoying... The only amusing one was the one with Britney Spears. Die blonde! But the others were really tiring... Dr. Evil and Scott were amusing though... But as previous reviewers have mentioned, it seemed like they just recycled the jokes from the last couple of movies. It was alright, but they could've done better. Pick up the 2nd one instead...
B00006ZSAD|5.0|I was sitting on the back porch last night with my roomate, drinking a few beers, listening to this album, and my roomate says, &quot;This album is the type of album that I can give to anyone, no matter their taste in music, and they'll automatically be blown away.&quot;  How true--I loved Beth Gibbons in Portishead, but this is truly her coming out party--her voice on this work is more diverse, more beautiful, and more diva-esque than any Portishead album--This is reminiscent of the work of legendary women of years past--the only woman in modern music that I think comes close to this level of vocal genius is Bjork (sorry Norah Jones--you ain't got that depth yet)--This album is a must buy
B00004WEJZ|1.0|From the dreadful opening, showing Sean Connery's age, to the lack of gunbarrel intro, THIS IS NOT BOND.  There is a reason that this is not considered to be an actual 007 film, and the abscence of Bond's theme music shows it.  This is more like a B-reel to Thunderball (using old character names, plots and locations).  Very weak.
1582432678|5.0|Wow.  Others have already described what this book is about, so I won't waste more time &amp; space doing so.  Suffice it to say that this book is extremely well-written; Lionel Shriver has an immense vocabulary and a skilled way of using it.  <br />Although the essential plot of the book -- boy kills fellow high school students -- is stated from the get-go, the book is still suspenseful because you keep reading to find out why.  Whether that is ever answered is something for each reader to find out. <br />I will say that I disagree with the reviewer who stated that this book makes it clear that it is the parents' fault that their son turned murderous.  On the contrary, that is never made clear at all.  There is no doubt something was &quot;wrong&quot; with Kevin from the very start, perhaps something so wrong that it could not have been made right.<br />Lastly, many reviewers have spoken of a shocking plot twist.  Surely I am not the only reader who saw this coming a mile ahead?  But what is truly amazing about the power of the book is that this foreknowledge did not dilute the horror of the moment one iota.  <br />I cried when this book ended.  It is a shattering read in many respects that will stay in my memory.  I will definitely look for more of Ms. Shriver's work.
B000002WYT|3.0|This was my first Dave CD, I never really got into the band until a couple years after I got this, and at that time, I thought that this CD, was great, but now as I look back compared to other Dave albums, this is my least favorite.  The only songs I still find myself enjoying are So Much To Say, Too Much, and Drive In Drive Out.  I know you're thinking, that's three great songs, so won't that make the album good.  On all the other albums, with the exception of Everyday, it's hard to find three songs that I don't enjoy.  Infact, I think Under, Crowded Streets, and the Lillywhites, I can't find a single song not worth listening to a hundred times over and over.  <br />This record is probably the most popular among fans, but I just don't like it.  I know that many other hardcore fans are going to probably check negative, but I prefer to listen to Before These Crowded Streets among anything else. <br />I'm not saying that this is a terrible CD, but that the novelty has worn off.  I find it hard to believe that I have become such a huge fan of the band, without hearing better material than this.  That just shows you that Dave Matthews Band can do no wrong, with the exception of &quot;Everyday&quot;, I still shutter when I mention that record.
B00000613T|1.0|What a waste of money. I'm as big a CSO fan there is, but not even they can rescue Boulez's stale conducting. There's no excitement, the tempi are static and all the great moments in this work are just played through without any acknowledgement. Given that for the same price one could obtain the recent Berlin and Abbado performance, which contains mind-boggling orchestral playing and passionate conducting, there would never be any need to acquire this CD.
B00008OWZC|5.0|The entire album is incredible, but disc 2 I highly recomend, with the 25 minute long version of Dazed and Confused, to the great drum solo in Moby Dick.  This will never leave my CD player.
B00008OOZ9|5.0|The White Stripes are brilliant for what they don't do, deliver overproduced, pretentious, bloated and boring 79 minute epic CD's that are more filler than actual music. The raw energy and enthusiasm Jack and Meg bring to these 14 cuts is positively infectious and &quot;Elephant&quot; is likely to be the best rock album you'll hear all year. When the guitar kicks in full volume and Meg's snare and crash cymbals starts bashing out on the first chorus of &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; you are so invigorated is almost makes you cry, and the Zeppelin-ish, droning, distorted bridge on &quot;Black Math&quot; is heavier metal than most so called thrash bands can muster in an entire career. Simplicity is the key here; The Stripes have a simple patented formula and know how to work it to stunning effect. Meg sings, but doesn't butcher &quot;In the Cold Cold Night&quot; and lends the song an air of seduction that would be lost in lesser hands. Jack does his best Mark Bolan impression on quite a few of these tracks, but finds his true soul-shouter within and it never comes across as mere mimickry.<br />The White Stripes have offically claimed their place in the annals of rock history. We'll be hearing &quot;Elephant&quot; forever.
B000056K04|2.0|I rarely rate something this low, especially from the best band to ever walk the face of the earth, but this album is terrible.  I can't find anything worth while on it.  I consider myself to be a big fan of Dave Matthews, have all the official releases and dozens of bootleg concerts and everyone I enjoy.  I first heard \\"I Did It\\" on a pre-internet-release and hated, but I thought that because there is one horrific song on it it doesn't mean the album is bad.  I was obviously wrong.  I can't begin to describe this, but I'll try.<br />The major thing this album is missing is a great jam or any sound coming from Leroi or Boyd, in my opinion they are the best part of the live performance, so I don't think this album would translate to concerts.  Dave has said so many times, that this is a very unconventional band, and that they don't make music to make hits.  The make music for the sake of enjoying music.  SCREW THAT!!!!!! This album is nothing more than a chance to trade in the jam band sound that is loved so much for the MTV friendly sound. Full of short songs, no band effort, and absolutely no jams.<br />I Did It - Possibly the worst song in the entire Dave Catolog and that means it beats out my feelings towards The Christmas Song.<br />When The World Ends - One of the few good tracks on the album, sadly they were going to release a single on this but passed up after the 9/11 incident.<br />The Space Between - A pop song that reminds me anything on the Crash CD, which again is not one of my favorites.  Most people have probably heard this on the radio, fan or not.<br />Dreams of Our Fathers - Actually not a bad tune, but not a good tune.  I have mixed emotions on this, no way can I describe it.  Check it out for yourself.  Very good example of the use on the electric guitar on this album.  This is a quick versed tune with an etchy mood, but a pop chorus.<br />So Right - A Pop melody with great intro, first minute sounds like it could be a great song, but that only hides, it's true face.  Probably the only song where Leroi makes his prescence known.  If you want to listen to this, put it on INTRO PLAY.<br />If I Had It All - Too Much Effort on lyrics to fall up short.  Dave has not been known for his great lyrics, and this just expresses that.  Not a good song at all.<br />What You Are - Starts off all techno, but then goes into a mood of it's own, sounds too much alike Halloween, but that's not a bad thing.  I like this song.<br />Angel - Electric Guitar Intro but doesn't deliver anything else in the end. This sounds like another hard effort fallen short.  Sounds like this was to be one of their pop MTV singles, but last minute change, because it actually sounds like something N'sync would sing.  Terrible all around.<br />Fool To Think - Another song that sounds like Angel, but with a little more sound to it.  A cool percussion sound in the background but nothing else is worth the time.<br />Sleep To Dream Her - By this time in the album you know what you're missing, and it's a great solo coming from Boyd, and sadly you don't hear it here.  More keyboards than anything.<br />Mother Father - Sounds like a little Mexican tune, but actually not a bad tune.  The only reason I like this is because it gives the album diversity.<br />Everyday - The only reason I like this song is because of the music video, the whole point of the song it to make somebody's day better, and the video delivers.  I feel strange saying this, because I absolutely disagree with the idea of a music video, it's for nothing better to see teenage girls listening to a good song like this and then forget about it a month later.  Once you make a music video it loses the novelty to the song.  <br />That's the entire CD, and if you still don't believe that it could be so bad, then have a listen for yourself, and try and tell if you can tell the songs apart.  It's all very slow, very pop melody.  I was shocked after hearing this album that they canceled the Lillywhites, a great album, because it didn't have the Nancies sound.  I laugh when I hear that because, it that was a concern, this album wouldn't have been written.  Go ahead check that the review was not helpfull, if you haven't already, but you have to agree with me that this is not one the good Dave albums.  I never usually write this long, but I need to stop the suffering now!
6304708521|1.0|The Beatles are my favorite band of all time, but there is simply no excuse for this travesty. The spaghetti scene is awful and painful to watch, the bus ride singalong is horrid and quite simply the Fab Four look [bad] in every sense of the word. This movie is so bad, it almost ruins the music. Almost. This is one blot on an otherwise flawless legend. Avoid this at all costs.
0385504209|5.0|Too often things in the popular media get passed off as \\"genious\\".  This book isn't genious.  It won't revolutionize the world and probably won't be talked about for year's to come.  But it is a great book.  It is both intelligent and interesting.  Whether or not you agree with the views presented in the book, it's always great to see another perspective.  And instead of just being a boring essay about one person's theory of the Holy Grail, it is a murder mystery as well.  I heartily recommend it.
B000002KCC|5.0|If 65 Amazon customer reviews (and countless raves from professional critics) haven't convinced you of this album's greatness, then I certainly don't know what I can add.<br />This album is drunken and emotional, filled to the brim with the drug-fueled decay of the 1970s.  The idealism that informed the psychedelic age of the late 60s had given way to death and incoherence just six years later.  Suddenly, the excess and the drugs that seemed so hip began to kill people.<br />By the time Neil Young and his band entered the studio, Hendrix, Joplin and Morrison were dead.  No doubt Young felt that these stars' deaths showed the true dangers of excess.  He possibly might have felt that these were isolated incidents.  After all, drugs expanded and freed the mind, did they not?  They didn't kill you in various combinations.  Maybe those three just overdid it.<br />Then Danny Whitten and Bruce Berry also died.  Not just one person close to Neil Young, but two.  The resulting confusion and grief is everywhere on TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT.  This album is a portrait of a man mourning the deaths of others, while struggling to overcome his own addictions.  Pretty ironic that Young and company are singing about these deaths, and sound so loaded and wasted at the same time.<br />The contradiction in TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT is but one of the many facets to Neil Young, who must be considered one of the most complex and gifted artists of the 20th century.
B00008PX8P|5.0|If you love Led Zeppelin, this is for you. Kickbutt live music that will rock your socks off. Buy the cd/dvd set.
B00005JLPK|4.0|When I saw all the features of this 2-DVD set I got so excited about getting this movie! I own Julie Taymor's TITUS and the DVD (also 2-DVD) is wonderful to watch, and I mean, not only the movie but all of the extras.  She's really genius when it comes to elaborate a set and a scene; one gets to feel a balance of elements united by dialogue.  FRIDA is no exception, I was happy to learn.<BR>The movie is a great visual journey and its plot is decisively an intense love story.  I don't think this movie needed to make a political statement about what Mexico was like 5 or 6 decades ago, as many critics in Mexico have complained.  It's the kind of movie that invites you to enjoy beauty and relate to love in all the ways it moves us.  <BR>I'm so sad that so many Mexicans have demonized Salma Hayek and her movie when it's really a great example of what perseverance and discipline can achieve. (Two things I'm sure these people lack of) <BR>I can't wait to see the interviews with Chavela Vargas (Salma's girlfriend, as they playfully call eachother) and with Julie Taymor.  This DVD will absolutely be part of my collection as soon as it is available!
B000002KLP|5.0|For You and Prince could not compare to his third album, the masterpiece Dirty Mind. Neither of those albums provided such a great showcase for Prince's musical talents.

B0000683DH|4.0|Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan is a welcome introduction of the Star Trek TV show to the movies.  It is not a special effects bore of a movie, without any elements of what made the Star Trek TV show great.  In other words, with Star Trek II, they got it right this time.<br />Instead of creating a movie that had little to do with Star Trek, this movie embraces the TV show as having plenty of interesting characters and material to use for this movie.<br />This story jumps right into the adventure.  The USS Reliant has stumbled upon a life form on Ceti Alpha VI, which would disqualify it as a possible candidate for Project Genesis.  Chekov and his captain beam down to the planet surface to find out what the life form is.  It turns out to be Khan and surviving members of his family, left there originally by Captain Kirk in the Star Trek episode titled &quot;Space Seed&quot;.  Ceti Alpha VI, is actually Ceti Alpha V, which has been rendered an inhospitable world since Ceti Alpha VI disintegrated.<br />Khan is out for revenge, and he takes control of the USS Reliant and goes after the Enterprise.  What made this movie great was that we finally get to actually see impressive computer graphics aboard the ships, instead of a blue light emitting from a view finder that Mr. Spock looked into occasionally on the TV series.<br />The look and and feel of this movie is very practical.  In the director's commentary, Nicholas Meyer said that he saw Star Trek as the Adventures of Horatio Hornblower in Outer Space. <br />The ending is probably the most suspenseful of any Star Trek movie, or TV show for that matter.  It was good to see that Star Trek finally got a movie treatment that it deserved.
B000009QPE|5.0|This album is worth every cent. Listen to it, and you will be hooked from start to finish!
0060930187|4.0|The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath begins with Esther's, the main character, internship with a fashion magazine in New York, and then goes back a few years into her college days.  It goes on to tell about Esther becoming crazy.  It seems that she has an almost perfect life; she had received numerous awards for her writing.  However she struggles within herself.  This book is very close to an autobiography of Plath, and is an alarmingly realistic view of being suicidal.  It is written in a surprisingly calm tone, but one might wonder why is on high school reading lists.
B00008NRI8|2.0|By activating the &quot;Two Bleeps Notice&quot; function in Special Features, you can access the movie outtakes when a small pink heart appears on the screen. If you don't want to have to watch the entire movie, here are the locations of each heart. I think I found them all. These are listed by hour:minute:second. 18:32, 20:04, 23:38, 24:13, 26:38, 28:14, 33:02, 37:28, 41:36, 47:16, 57:50, 1:13:01, 1:24:29.<br />The extras on the DVD are of the usual fare, but not outstanding. The commentary is somewhat interesting, with Sanda and Hugh bantering about. The movie itself is somewhat forgettable, but is an enjoyable little film. I agree with another reviewer who said that it's like iceberg lettuce: not really great for you, but certainly not bad for you either, and you'll forget all about it an hour after it's over.
0316776963|3.0|Me Talk Pretty One Day was my initiation into the quirky and warped world of David Sedaris, and after the first few pages I knew I would like it there. This was a guy who tried to construct a vocabulary without using the letter &quot;s&quot; so that he could mask his lisp. As a child, he hilariously tells us, his midget guitar teacher had a voice like a recording played back too fast and he taught his students to love their guitars by suggesting they imagine them as a &quot;stacked&quot; woman. And that's just in the first two (short) chapters.<br />But suddenly, the same sharp commentary that had me laughing out loud in public a few chapters earlier started to seem predictable, and the sarcastic wit I identified with early on had somehow eroded into a grating kind of pessimism.<br />Fortunately, I put the book aside and read something else for a few days. When I picked it up again, it again seemed fresh and bitingly comical. And then I realized what I now think is essential to enjoying Mr. Sedaris' work: it needs to small bites in order to be digested correctly.<br />So I end up with three stars -- an average between the two stars I would give it had I read the book straight through and the four I think it deserves when it comes in drips and drabs. I can't agree with my fellow reviewers who consider Mr. Sedaris a modern day Mark Twain or P.G. Wodehouse, but he is pretty damn funny. Just remember, like most things, the key is moderation.
B000069HZP|4.0|Michael Douglas again plays a rich, divorced, cocky, wall street type, whose brother, the dark sheep of the family, perfect for Penn. decides to give him a unique gift for his birthday.  The gift is an invitation to a game, one that will change him entirely, and in the process discover his true self, or something like that.  It's an interesting thriller. and of course the old hollywood standby of losing it all and coming out of it a better person is here.  The big brother game agency speaks of the loss of privacy, and how our lives can be changed by technology. And then there is the underlying seed of it all, revenge.  Taking the rich scrooge and showing him his demons to extracting penitance for his success,while those around him suffer.  All in all a pretty good romp through the darkness of family treachery and deceit.
B00008OWZC|5.0|...to do this album justice?  I can't think of anything that could describe the thrill of this release as well as the DVD.  There are excellent bootlegs out there but are too expensive and hard to locate but even the best of those do not match Jimmy's talent for cleaning this one up.  This album should replace their untitled 4th album as the ultimate album of all time.  I say we donate some of our bootlegs to Mr. Page and let him get to work on releasing even more.  From their studio sessions to the present, Page and Jones are unequalled in brilliance; Plant and Bonham are no less brilliant too and considering they didn't have quite the pre-Zeppelin career Page and Jones had.  Plant's solo work is unmatched as well and deserves a second look if you're a Zepp-exculsive fan.
B000089RVX|5.0|Don't let the current smash radio hit &quot;Bring Me Back to Life&quot; fool you.  This is no one hit wonder on our hands.  I'll admit that was my original assumption after hearing the single.  I was wrong, and gladly so.<br />This album is amazing.  A few of the songs sound the same, but most of the songs have their own original sound.  It's something new, especially Amy Lee's vocals.  I've never heard anyone deliver a song like she does.  It's mystifying, and wonderful to listen to.<br />I can listen through this entire album without skipping a song, and each song captures a different emotion.  My favorites are, &quot;Everybody's Fool&quot;, &quot;Haunted&quot;, &quot;Tourniquet&quot;, and especially &quot;Taking Over Me&quot;, which has got to be the next single.  Amazing album!
B00008PX8P|5.0|..thats the only word to describe this masterpiece of musical and technical fusion. Pin sharp visuals, awe inspiring raw audio of pristine clarity..and i've only watched the Royal Albert Hall section so far....Let the boys live inside your head with headphones too in order to study every tiny nuance of each living breathing track. I cant think of a modern band that could attempt to come close to the ethereal connection forged between these remarkable musicians....and we all owe a big debt of gratitude to Jimmy Page for liberating this marvel from the vaults. Rock doesnt get any better than this....
B00005JLWN|4.0|Christian Bale, perhaps one of the most overlooked talents in Hollywood today, delivers his best performance yet. As John Preston, the most esteemed \\"Cleric,\\" a police-like figure whose responsibility it is to hunt down and kill those reisistance fighters who still cling to human emotion and collect relics of human culture in post-World War 3 civilization, Preston belongs to a government which firmly believes that it is our own emitions which threaten to destroy mankind.  The logical conclusion is to shut these emotions out, which is acomplished through the administration of a special drug.<BR>     <BR>     I don't want to summarize the plot for you, but being an employee at a major video rental chain, I see a lot of crap.  And this movie had the potential to join that crap in the stinking, steaming pile of garbage movies that are produced each year without fail.  But something about this picture is different.  Anyone who dismisses the blending of martial arts and gunfighting as ridiculous is obviously not a true fan of the genre, since they accept such equally preposterous concepts such as harnessing the powers of three psychic siblings to tell the future of crime before it is comitted in other similar films (not naming any names).  <br />     What we have here is a mix of Orwell's 1984 and Bradbury's Farenheit 451, with some Blade Runner and yes, I'm proud to admit, some Matrix-esque slickness thrown in for good measure.  The result is pure energy, a film which oozes cool without overtly trying to do so.  Hell, even Taye Diggs manages a  convincing performance.  For that alone this film deserves my rating.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I have not been this excited about a music release in years.<br />What strikes me about these live performances is that they do not vary in intensity. Knebworth in '79 just blew me away...as much as both Earl's Court performances. You definitely get a sense of the magic these guys tapped into when they took the stage.<br />These DVD's do an excellent job in showing, what I think, Zeppelin was all about: taking the listener (or watcher) on a journey. The improvisation, the grooves, it's all pretty overwhelming to a long time Led Zeppelin fan, particularly 'Trampled Under Foot' from the '75 Earl's Court show.
B000089RVX|5.0|There's no doubt that Fallen could have been the soundtrack for Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  From the first note, this CD evokes the same haunt-y mood and some of the lyrics could have been penned by Joss Whedon himself. . .they are that good.  I've never owned a CD packed so full of 'listenable' tracks. It was quite a surprise to find the whole Buffy/Spike dynamic recreated in my headphones. That was a treat I never expected to find in a product so far removed from the Buffyverse. <br />Fallen is destined to melt in my CD player.
B000067J1H|5.0|In 1999, a decade into the bookish Men's Movement, its concerns have finally been committed to celluloid.  \\"Fight Club's\\" Tyler Durden represents the cocky virile manhood missing in the pale fluorescence of modern man's office life in a service economy.<br />Brad Pitt's Tyler chainsmokes, wears red leather, dresses garishly, behaves transgressively, and begins a paramilitary movement to overthrow the glaze the American corporate world has placed in the eyes of its drone workers.<br />We begin, however, with Ed Norton's emasculated Jack, an insurance appraiser whose unchanneled emotion has made him a sag-eyed insomniac.  Physically healthy, Jack discovers illness support groups as a means to vent his sadness and frustration.  It's there that he meets sassy basketcase Marla Singer (Helena Bonhma Carter) whom he is too much of a eunuch to seduce.  The first half is the film is sharp black humor as Jack and Marla begin their bizarre courtship.<br />Slowly Jack's macho alter ego Tyler begins eclipsing his gentle cooperative persona to the point where, under Tyler's influence, he burns his well-appointed IKEA-packed urban condo and moves to the seedy edge of town near a malodorous paper mill.  Tyler and Jack, in buddy movie fashion, are first depicted as like-minded friends, both on the run from capitalistic values and their commodifying effect on human beings as well as a male-bashing Ritalin-crazed post-feminist world.  In their large dilapidated shabby-chic home, they create a male precinct where the traditional masculine values of freedom, mischief, rebellion, and vitality can thrive.<br />In a touching scene, Tyler and Jack discuss the absence of fathers, hinting that this missing piece of their upbringing is behind their vague but tender homoeroticism.  In their spare time, the duo form FIGHT CLUB, a group of disaffected men who meet in the basements of bars for bare knuckles boxing sessions which those involved find cathartic and invigorating.<br />In the Bible Christ says:  \\"I came not to bring peace but a sword.\\"  Tyler Durden can be seen as a Christ figure.  As a 30something, he's the right age.  He gathers an enthused discipleship.  He preaches of a spiritual war against materialism and docility.  Instead of the Sermon on the Mount, we get The Sermon in the Basement.  Tyler takes on the powers that be in his society, much as Christ did, with an army of misfits and outsiders, and he proves he is willing to die for his cause.<br />\\"Fight Club\\" flies in the face of political correctness every chance it gets and reminds us how sex and aggression animate our lives.  The scene in which Tyler gives Jack a searing chemical burn on the back of his hand is the film's shuddering climax.  Jack tries to disappear into New Age fantasy as Tyler urges him to stay with the pain.  This is Jack's hazing into manhood, recalling the male rites of passage of primitive tribes.  It reflects Christian mythos as well, since the scar from Jack's burn resembles one of Christ's stigmata.  Jack and Tyler then proceed to give this scar to all new Fight Club members.<br />When Fight Club morphs into \\"Operation Mayhem,\\" Tyler's vandalistic direct attack on civilization, Jack becomes skittish and winds up out of the information loop of an organization he helped to create.  He and Tyler clash, which yields a shocking revelation about them I won't spoil here.<br />\\"Fight Club\\" and \\"American Beauty\\" (both 1999) rail against the domesticated demise of American frontier manhood.  Their central characters are willing to pay a high price for freedom.  These characters' failures and disconnections lead to a kind of endearing macho campiness, and many will be lead to sympathize with their \\"male malaise.\\"  <br />\\"Fight Club\\" is like a gun aimed at the idealized androgyny and co-ed conversion of the last 40 years.  What men need, it seems to claim, is \\"guy-space\\" and \\"guy-time,\\" male bonding and man-making ritual.  The movie suggests that only after this confidenceand swagger is achieved can a man be a fit companion for a woman, meeting her considerable sexual and emotional power with a brand of power all his own.<br />Well acted by Pitt, Norton, and Carter; ably directed with great technical flourish by David Fincher; poetically written by novelist Chuck Palahniuk and screenwriter Jim Uhls, \\"Fight Club\\" is a biting satire, a malcontented masterpiece that forecasts a redefinition of manhood which is somehow both revolutionary and reactionary.  After Americans are past the long period of political centrism that began in the late 1980s and persists to <BR>this day, look for \\"Fight Club\\" to be regarded as a crystal ball.
B00008J4P5|4.0|I had never heard of White Stripes until a friend loaned me a copy. The first 4 tracks are amazing. I can do without the 5th track, but it is an amazing album overall. I couldn't believe there are only 2 of them in the band! They sound like a throwback to '70s classic rock, and he sounds a lot like Robert Plant on some tracks. My only criticism (other than track 5) is that the songs don't go togteher very well. It's all over the place as far as genre.
0688163173|3.0|Dennis Lehane is one of those writers whose books I buy on name recognition alone; I've read and enjoyed all his works.  This one is no exception--but it is NOT one of his best.<br />This book reminds me of the movie &quot;A few good men&quot;--you burn through a fast paced build up to a great finish, but while the finish may leave a good taste in your mouth you shouldn't forget the other 90% of the story.  Suffice to say on second look there are some major holes in the plot.  Once you read it, then go back through the plot, this story is more than a little bit far fetched.  And without the far-fetched premise (think p. 209-210, for starters) you don't get the fantastic finish.<br />All that being said, this is a good light read for the first time through--if this is a future screenplay I'm more than curious how they will make the ends tie together.<br />All that being said, Lehane has a skill at dialogue and a writing style that is first-rate. I prefer his earlier stuff over this but it's still a good evening's read.  When Mr. Lehane writes his next work I'll still be there with my $.
B00008OWZC|5.0|The only thing better than a &quot;new&quot; Zeppelin album is a new, live Zeppelin album. I can't believe how good these tracks sound. I have several Zep bootlegs, but they don't compare to the quality of these songs. If you are a Zeppelin fan and/or a fan of guitar, this is a must have! Trust me on this one.
B00008OWZC|5.0|Led Zeppelin's \\"How The West Was Won\\" is a godsend to all those Led Zeppelin fans that had to listen to muddy bootleg recordings of shows to get the full impact of how the band sounded live.<br />Now in all it's bombastic and crystal clear sound, Led Zepppelin can be heard the way it's meant to be heard - LIVE! in this 3 CD set compliation of 2 shows in summer of 1972.<br />Highlights are too numerous to mention but from the opening exitement induced \\"LA Drone\\", to the last harmonica belts from Robert Plant on \\"Bring It On Home\\", it is one delight after another. <br />Too hard to describe, but once you put it on, you'll fall in love with this band all over again and it will prove why they stand the test of time as one of the best rock and roll/heavy metal bands in the world - STILL!<br />All fans, get it!
B00003CXXM|3.0|Skip the movie' read the book. This movie doesn't even come close to doing Robert Ludlum justice. Enough said?
B000001EG6|5.0|I bought the original LP version around 1974 for five dollars at a local department store, when I was a teenager.  I played it until it wore out.  This isn't a bright, feel-good album. Featuring arrangements by the great Paul Buckmaster, the feeling here is almost gothic in its dark tones and heavy strings.  The feeling is of cold stone castle floors, heavy armour and damp dungeon walls.  It's not all depressing, though, even for its dark tone. &#34;The Greatest Discovery&#34; is the sweet and beautiful story of a little boy meeting his new baby brother for the first time, and &#34;Your Song&#34; is arguably one of the greatest love songs ever written.  This album was a favourite when I was a teenager, and it still is.
B00005Q4CS|4.0|Requiem for a Dream is an energetic and engaging melodramatic tradgedy with addiction as its theme, stylistically much like a ninety minute version of the film clip to Prodigy's \\"Fire Starter\\". A gradually accelerating descent into nightmare, both in narrative and imagery, Aronofsky creates a dark tale for our time with skillful and original use of camera and sound. It has resonances with 80's indie movie \\"Liquid Sky\\" (both subject and definitely soundtrack) and some of the imagery recalls Cronenberg's eXistenz. On this level it works and is a grimly entertaining and challenging film for those of us who like this sort of thing.<br />But a cautionary tale? Yes, like the 1950's propaganda film \\"Reefer Madness\\" is a cautionary tale. Addiction is an ugly thing and its ugliness is well documented, but Requiem for a dream goes well beyond anything resembling a factual analysis of its subject matter. If you want to use this movie to scare your kids away from drugs, you may have some problems suspending disbelief. Not everyone who abuses drugs is doomed to drug abuse hell, and this film does not embrace the idea of rehabilitation (where \\"Trainspotting\\" did). Much of the story reinforces old stereotypes and myths about drug dealers and wildly exagerates certain risks. Prescription diet pills leading to electro-shock therapy?<br />This is where my concerns about taking this film too seriously arise. Many points of this story sit uneasily with the issues surrounding our approach to drug abuse and harm minimisation. When Harry seeks treatment for a horribly infected and poisonous wound resulting from injection he is not only arrested but refused treatment. Refused treatment for a life threatening injury in a hospital. What is the take-home message here? Don't dare to seek medical treatment if you have consumed illegal drugs? Kids die that way.<br />Watch it and be revolted Cronenberg style. But if you want to use this movie like a Grimm Brothers fairytale, tread very carefullyindeed.
B000088E6D|5.0|I saw Michael perform recently at the Blue Note in NYC.  I was so blown away I managed to get tickets at the Sunday Sold Out show the following day.  Again - Sinatra was not this good at his age.<br />This guy cannot be missed.  He's better in person! And this is a great CD!<br />Look forward to a lot more from this exceptionally talented singer.
B00008OWZC|4.0|For all the bands like Mudvane and Coldplay who<BR>think they know how to play music, take a refresher<BR>cource at the Led Zeppelin School.<BR>   3CD's of Zeppelin at their brutal best will<BR>show anyone the way music was really made, before<BR>studio technology changed things forever. It is true<BR>that they were a better studio band. But for four <BR>guys to have the kind of live power that they did,<BR>is a testiment to how good they were.<BR>   The 'Whole Lotta Love' medley, does get lost in<BR>itself, and I thought John Paul Jones' bass could've<BR>been punched up a bit. But as a whole, How The West<BR>Was Won is a good set from a great band...

B00007JVBI|3.0|OK, I'm not gonna pretend that I know anything about Cat Power beyond what you find in the reviews for this record.  As nearly everyone has said, Chan Marshall provides subdued vocals to minimal accompaniment.  Don't pay attention to the big names mentioned - it's so not a big deal.  I understand that not all music is complex and that many people appreciate sparse arrangments; however, I think too much of this album is too musically repetitive for me to enjoy it often.  You may say that is the allure of Cat Power, but I know people in my city who don't have a cult following that can create simple songs more compelling than these.  That is why I am blown away at the amount of people who will readily give this album 5 stars.  To me, that is just as uselessly fanatic as the gazillion people who rate Britney Spears' debut album as perfect at her respective page.  Man, we need to be so much more critical of our music.  I can say this is interesting music at times and the lyrics are definitely unconventional and thoughtful.  The first track's words I find particularly intriguing and the overdubbed &quot;I don't blame you's&quot; are effective.  BUT - I can't say this is a masterpiece or brilliant.  I just don't feel that.  I am tired of both mainstream *and* indie singers/songwriters/bands being shamelessly overhyped and overpraised when they make mediocre music.  Sorry for the tangent, but sheesh!  One thing, the recycled paper CD case is cool, but I feel that my disk will become scratched easily.  I also have to turn the case inside-out to remove the CD, so it's not exactly simple, but that is minor.  Anyway, if I got this CD free I would not have a thing to say in the least, but I listened to Courtney Hole...
B00009EIQE|4.0|Buddy Guy is the very last of the superhumanly great bluesmen, and if you have not caught on to him, or know him only from his Silvertone releases, you owe it to yourself to catch him live. You will then bear witness to a man whose eyes have taken in so much of the world and how it makes a man suffer for who he aspires to be. Guy is well aware that he is both Oracle and Sage, Historian and Prophet. His is a blues of messianic turmoil. One of the most endearing turns in his career of extraordinary dynamics has come in the past few years. His CD, SWEET TEA, took him in his 60's to a whole new threshold and having crossed it, he seems to have found renewed energy. Perhaps he is going supernova, in which case every release demands that we pay close attention.<BR>So it is that BLUES SINGER has arrived. He has gone accoustic before with Junior Wells on the brilliant ALONE AND ACCOUSTIC CD from 1991, and this is an equally brilliant coda to that session. Guy deserves all of our respect for coaxing out of B.B. King and Eric Clapton a feral power I'd have thought they had checked at the gates of Vegas and Showbiz a long time ago. Perhaps it is impossible to stand next to the incendiary Guy and not be consumed by the passionate fire......<br />In any case from the opening track, &quot;Hard Time Killing Floor&quot; to the emotionally exhausting &quot;Lonesome Home Blues,&quot; Buddy Guy takes the listener on a deeper, darker, more subtle and disturbing road through the heart of the blues than anyone else in the field. His picking and fretwork are as wild, passionate and intricate as his blistering electric efforts. The upright bass and brush drums give this workout a haunting, ghost ridden feel. Something deep and spiritual inhabits these tales, and the intimacy with which they were recorded adds to the disturbing quality of ruminating over the loss in one's heart. This is not music for the feint of soul.<BR>&quot;It ain't the years, it's the mileage.&quot; Aye. And in the case of Buddy Guy we have a man who has stood at the crossroads of time and distance, has taken it all in and has this statement to make about it. It is quite an articulation.....

B00003CX8Y|5.0|I loved the first Beauty and The Beast. So naturally, when this version came to Imax theaters in my home town, I was all for seeing it large and up close. Even though I like the new added scene, I'mm fine with the classic. Having it on DVD is just a no brainer for picture clarity and sound excellence. Definite must have!
031286504X|5.0|This book was one of the most amazing novels I have ever encountered. It was truly captivating from the first page to the last - I read the whole book in one sitting. The monologue is thought provoking, profound, yet realistic. Rather than taking the conventional route of fantasy vampire novels, Matheson takes a more scientific approach, as he explains the true vampire through an analytical approach. The plot is very believable, and the main character is very well developed. If you haven't already done so, BUY THIS BOOK NOW!
B00005JLEU|5.0|Released in 2001, Spirited Away has become an instant classic in animation, bringing classic anime to a much wider audience.<br />In its roots, this is a classic coming-of-age story like thousands before it. A young girl begins the story afraid of her own shadow, cranky, timid and clingy. The family is moving to a new town and Chihiro doesn't like any of it. Her mother is clearly tired of this behavior and her father tries to push her into being stronger.<br />Then, just as the girl feared, something went wrong. A little trip into a strange area suddenly has her parents turned into pigs, herself trapped in a servant's contract, and no sign of escape. She's put to hard work and sees no way of escaping. It's the opposite of the Wizard of Oz - instead of a gorgeous world where she has friends, she's a scullery maid with people snarling at every turn. And like in Pinocchio, it was their own boorish behavior that had the parents turn into farm animals.<br />But slowly Chihiro realizes that things aren't as bad as she first though, once she gives it a fair try. Her fellow maids are actually quite friendly and helpful. The bathhouse in which she works appreciates the things she's able to do. The creatures and monsters that inhabit her new world, once quite fearsome to her, are now friends.<br />Most especially, Chihiro is taken care of by a boy, Haku, who both works for the witch overlord of the bathhouse and also seems quite familiar to Chihiro. As the story moves along, Chihiro matures quite a bit, of course. The whole story is about her growing and learning and discovering her strengths. Her friends band together to help her out, and the requisite happy ending results.<br />I understand why this is the highest grossing movie in Japanese history, and also why it was nominated for an Academy award. The general tale is one all people can relate to - the difficulties of change when you're a child, the wonder and strength that comes from realizing you can overcome those difficulties. The characters all have dimension - there aren't &quot;good guys&quot; and &quot;bad guys&quot;. Characters start out harsh and annoying, but you get to like them when you get to know them. Even the 'mean' characters have understandable reasons for being that way.<br />And yet, despite being an avid student of the Japanese culture and understanding a lot of the underlying themes, the movie just wasn't quite &quot;finished&quot;. Themes were started and not completed. Things mentioned with importance are later forgotten. There are characters that she meets for 5 minutes and is petrified of, and others that she knows for 8 minutes and is crying when she leaves them. Her roller-coaster emotions are inconsistant, even as she is maturing.<br />The same is seen in the animation. There were many sequences in the animation where it became jerky and rough. Yes, some scenes (the entrance to the boss' office for one) obviously were labors of love, with exquisite detail. But there were other scenes that should have been breathtaking - the dragon flying near the end, for example - that looked clumsy. And then only a few moments later, the two faces as they fell were again extremely well done. It's as if someone chose key parts that had to stand out, and really worked on those - but left the other scenes to middlemen. When I hold the animation of Spirited Away up to many of my other favorite animated classics, I'm afraid that Spirited Away just isn't as consistant or smooth across the film.<br />Also, with the theme being so timeless, I'm afraid that much of the movie was incredibly predictable. Even one of the key secrets wasn't much of a great moment when it was revealed, because there was no 'story meaning' to it. I won't give away the ending section, but while much of the middle of the movie sung with innovations and interesting, fascinating twists, at the end it dissoved back down into just about every other coming-of-age story written, and some extremely tired cliches finish the movie off. I truly felt let down.<br />It sort of indicates the general tone of the movie when my favorite scene here doesn't hold a candle to my favorite scenes in other animated classics, either from a drawing, a plot, or a character point of view. It was simply funny. It was the soot-dust scene, where Chihiro has first entered the scary bathhouse. She sees a poor little soot-dust creature struggling to carry a lump of coal, and it gets crushed by the coal. Aghast, she tries to help out the creature by lifting its coal lump and then carries the coal herself to the furnace.<br />The other soot creatures all crowd around her and it almost appears they're thanking her for saving their friend. One of the soot creatures lifts his own lump above his head ... and then THUMP, he drops it on himself, wiggling his little arms and legs and shrieking for help. Suddenly every little soot creature is dropping its coal on its head, hoping to get out of some work. It had me hooting in laughter.<br />So in the end, while other aspects of the movie were lovely but not excellent, I loved Spirited Away for those little spots of laughter in the story. Those little details are where it shone.ches finish the movie off.

The collection of animals, and bugs, on the lifeboat;the last glimpse of Richard Parker;the mysterious island-what visual magic Yann Martel writes!<br />I loved the exploration of what the point of religion is in the end, no matter what form it takes.<br />I loved the questions raised on many levels.<br />I highly recommend this book.  Savor and enjoy.
B00000IAU3|5.0|I picked up a copy of this CD after hearing the excerpt of \\"Thank You\\" in Eminem's \\"Stan.\\"  Immediately, I fell in love with it.  I started out liking \\"Thank You\\" and \\"Here With Me\\" because those were the ones on the radio, but the whole CD is full of great music, and those two get lost in the mix when compared to some of the lesser known songs.  The best are probably \\"My Lover's Gone\\" and \\"Take My Hand.\\"  The former is very slow and moving, while the latter is very dreamy and upbeat.  \\"Hunter,\\" \\"Slide,\\" \\"Isobel,\\" and \\"No Angel\\" are also all great.  Perhaps \\"Honestly OK\\" is weak, but the rest of the CD is top-notch.  I'd recommend it to anyone.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Beck has this great effect on me: each album he releases becomes my favorite album. I've all but ceased to listen to Midnite Vultures, one of my favorite albums of the last decade, because Sea Change is so, so beautiful. From the mournful opening guitar strums of &quot;The Golden Age,&quot; this album intrigued me; by the time the infectious bass lines and mellow groove of &quot;Paper Tiger&quot; had come in, I was hooked. It's an interesting sound... mellow like Mutations, but with a funk-and-groove twist, like a scaled down version of Midnite Vultures.<br />At first I thought I would be alone in not getting sad when I listened to this, but I'm happy to see that it's a familiar theme in the customer reviews. The lyrics are of heartbreak, but the music is uplifting. It makes you float over the emotions rather than get buried in them. It feels really odd to be singing along with lines like &quot;These days I barely get by / I don't even try,&quot; and feel your soul soaring over the countryside like a freed eagle... but that's what this music does to me.<br />Sea Change definitely grows on you, even if you aren't expecting it to. So if the mellowness turns you off at first - and I fully expect diehard fans of &quot;Midnite Vultures&quot; to feel this way - give it some time.
079284131X|3.0|Child's Play is one of the most enduring horror classics which still continues to terrify people everywhere today. Although low-budget, Holland has managed to create a seamingly-plausible plot that never loses its touch, and never comes short of sending chills up your spine. Although it seems the adult actors weren't too interested in the film, check out young Andy's performance as the terrified youngster whose dream became a nightmare. Listen for Chucky's remark after an older woman comments on his appearance in the elevator towards the end, and Andy's final(we hope) farewell to Chucky in the fireplace. This is a horror classic which anyone can watch more than once. Makes me want to go to Kay-Bee Toys (yeah right!).
B00005JLRT|3.0|This was not quite what I would call the best Star Trek movie.  It is said that they are supposed to be up against the most deadly apponent ever in a Star Trek film.  I fail to see this.  Jar Jar Binks would have been a more worthy apponent than this guy.  This Shinzon fella better be glad that he wasn't up against Kirk, because the movie would've only been about 5 minutes long.  Shinzon would've been dead after the first minute, and the last 4 minutes would be Kirk, Spock, and McCoy talking about how much of a joke Shinzon was.  There are a number of scenes that (if you're familiar with them) you can tell were taken from the other movies.  So to put it plainly, I would call it an average Star Trek movie.  But I would recomend &quot;The Voyage Home&quot; or &quot;The Undiscovered Country&quot; over this one any day.
079284131X|3.0|Child's Play is one of the most enduring horror classics which still continues to terrify people everywhere today.

B00008G9JO|3.0|When I saw this new version remastered and upgraded with extra tracks in the store, I bought it immediately, in an \\"outburst of joy.\\" After all, this is my favorite Tull record! I didn't even notice that it was a copy controlled CD. Actually I don't know if it can be considered a CD, because it does not carry the traditional \\"digital audio disc\\" stylized logo anywhere, not even in the jewel case internal tray. Instead it has the \\"copy controlled\\" logo on the back and on the front labels. So far it plays on my CD player, which is a relatively new one (I'm not sure about old ones but in the CD it says it should be compatible.) I couldn't play with my \\"Real Jukebox.\\" It thinks it is a data CD. It comes with some software that should allow you to play it in the computer. It looks like it doesn't allow you to make mp3 backups from it.<BR>This record shows a mature Jethro Tull, free from syndrome of suffering pop stars and anti-Christian frills. It is a well-blended folk-prog-rock record. This is the best (technically) formation of the band and the arrangements are intricate and delicate, but still \\"easy-listenable\\" for the majority of pop-minded population. The electric part of the songs blends well with the acoustic one (probably thanks to David Palmer.) The two extra tracks complement well the original CD musically and thematically.<BR>I would initially give it five stars, but the \\"copy controlled\\" thing made me feel a bit uneasy, a bit \\"controlled.\\" So I will take two out for that. I still have my old original CD and still don't know which one of them to trade or sell.
B000096I9G|5.0|As someone who has been to 25 Cure concerts and has over 700 shows on tape, I can tell you that this is a fantastic presentation of a legendary Cure concert!  Production is excellent.  The video quality is very good with a few artsy bits that enhance the performance without getting in the way.  The audio is mixed well too.  This is one of those good sounding concert DVDs, quality somewhere in between Depeche Mode Night in Paris and NIN All That Could Have Been.<br />It's a real treat to have songs like A Short Term Effect, Closedown, Cold, Same Deep Water as You, and Untitled in such great quality.  A FANTASTIC encore of If Only Tonight We Could Sleep and The Kiss is included too.  The Kiss is as good a version as I've ever heard.  The 40min interview is good too, all of the band members chime in.<br />Since they play the albums straight through and there aren't many poppy singles, this DVD is more for hardcore fans.  But even if you just love Disintegration I'd recommend it.  I hope they do a live greatest hits DVD like this one someday too.<br />The only minor problem I have is with the sound of Robert's 6-string bass on some of the Disintegration tracks.  It's not mixed as strongly as usual during Pictures of You and because of that the song comes off a bit flat.  The 6-string comes alive during Untitled though, probably because Perry is doubling up the lead part.<br />With everything else being so fantastic, I can't complain- 5 stars!!
6305428050|5.0|In the tradition of &quot;License To Drive&quot; and &quot;Ferris Bueller's Day Off&quot; this movie delivers high laughs and pure entertainment that everyone can enjoy.Shue shines as Chris Parker who, after been stood up by her boyfriend, gets stuck babysitting a kid daughter and her 15 year old brother (who shouldn't be there but decides to tag along due to his infatuation for Chris). She gets a distress call from her best pal Brenda who is trapped in a bus station downtown and Chris needs to go pick her up - but she is supposed to be babysitting! She decides to take them with her and this is where the real fun starts. Before they know it they are being chased by gangsters, singing for their lives in a seedy blues club and trying their hardest not to bump into the parents on the town.<br />Crammed with laughs, action and superb blues music &quot;Adventures In Babysitting&quot; is everything a comedy should be!
B00005JLXE|4.0|Contrary to both hardcore fans, and devotee haters, I thought this movie was enjoyable, fun to watch, (much better than I thought it would be), yet still nowhere near as good as X2 or Spider-Man. (People say that they feel that Daredevil was more of a realistic character, and I say \\"What? What blind guy has a radar sense? What blind guy can balance on a pole on a rooftop, or fight kung-fu in a public park? Realistc? get a dictionary!) But neither here nor there, the thing that, for me, really made this movie, was Collin Farrel's portrayal of Bullseye. He was so darn cool. He drank a lot, killed people without a second thought, heck, this is the first movie where Collin lets his true Irish accent show, and it works perfectly with the image of this obnoxious punk/rebel who happens to have a great arm/aim. Basically all the scenes with him (except when he's throwing glass at DD, that was too repetitive and reminiscent of SM), and especially the ones between him & Kingpin, were pretty funny, and really cool. So in summary, if they were to put Bullseye in his own movie, or at least a better movie (perhaps the next Spider-Man?) the movie would rule all, because he is what makes this movie at least enjoyable.
B000068IEU|2.0|Because I am in the UK, this movie was banned from when it was first released and never given proper censorship to be released - until now. I have to say I was disappointed.<br />Two 17 year old girls head out to catch a concert but on their way home they are captured by 4 escaped convicts and they are dragged into the woods not 20 yards from their house where they are subjected to severe brutality - rape, torture, humiliation and disembowerment before finally being killed in a very quick scene that lacks tension. <br />I defy anyone to watch it and NOT feel emotionally disturbed. I do think Wes Craven's idea to release it was \\"here's a movie that pushes the boundaries - watch it if you dare\\". And he succeeded. Although I said above it's a lousy movie it's not because of what happens - it's how it's FILMED. <br />The sheer fact that two young girls are subjected to ruthless brutality by psychos across the street from their house while their parents give a statement to the local sheriff in their livingroom is so disturbing, it makes your heart ache.It makes the viewer hooked on what's happening and feel sorrow for the victims and their parents who don't even know it's going on across the street from their own home. That's what a movie is all about - getting the audience hooked and interested - it's just a pity this one was handled badly. If this movie was re-made today with famous actors it would be an instant classic. This version is let down by poor direction,terrible music, some bad acting and a few comic moments that are so distracting it veers away from the horror that's supposed to be the imperative ingredient of the movie. Apart from the comic moments in it, the acting lets it down. The parents don't seem too worried that their daughter failed to come home 24 hours after a concert she went to, and when they find her body in the woods their reaction to the discovery of her death is very sketchilly performed.<br />Wes Craven is a master horror filmaker - but with this he should have tried harder, without the comic elements. Go watch \\"Scream\\" instead!!
0780021150|4.0|\\"M\\" was a pioneering effort when Fritz Lang directed it, a lifetime ago, and it's still well worth watching. But 72 years later, it's lost a bit of its edge. Peter Lorre was primarily a stage actor at the time he appeared in \\"M\\" and by today's standards  his performance in the famous \\"underground trial\\" scene verges on scenery-chewing. And while the print used to produce Criterion Collection DVD is mostly clear, the subtitles [are bad] ... sentences are broken in odd places, and often several characters' lines appear all together, before an exchange is half over.  If you've never seen this movie, and you have any serious interest in the development of the art form, you definitely ought to see it. But don't expect edge-of-your-seat tension throughout!
0754014975|5.0|Bryson has done it again!  I lived in Australia for quite a few years and reading this book brought back a rush of memories.  His wit is insightful, and internationally &quot;spot on.&quot;  He doesn't really have a go at the Australians, as much as say, guitely pointing out unique quirks the Auzzies have developed for themselves down under.<br />I read this book on a plane ride back from Australia a few years ago, and caught myself laughing out load more than once.<br />Great book, Bill.
B00005JKNC|4.0|There are a lot of things to like about &quot;The Majestic.&quot; Nice scenery, decent acting, a good &quot;message&quot; ... and a hilarious cameo by Bruce Campbell in &quot;Sand Pirates of the Sahara,&quot; the overwrought &quot;Egyptian curse&quot; movie scripted by Carrey's character, Peter Appleton. Unfortunately, there are some not-so-wonderful aspects to the movie, too. At 2.5 hours it's WAY too long. There are too many characters -- e.g. the resentful crippled veteran -- unnecessary scenes, and a heavy-handedness that made me cringe at times. Hollywood's self-preening take on the 1950s Congressional hearings is just a bit too much.<br /><br /> Also, I know I'm being nit-picky, but in most scenes, Martin Landau looks like he's wearing lipstick.... and when Luke and Adele have their first dance at the big homecoming bash, the band plays &quot;Stranger on the Shore,&quot; a song written a decade after the period the movie is set in.<br /><br /> Overall, a decent movie (in all senses of the word) but not the Capra-esque classic it aims to be. The consensus rating of 3.5 stars is about right.
B00006RG9K|5.0|I was so impressed with this dvd set!  The concert is great and the number of cameras they had along with the superb editing really make you feel like you' re at the show.  The multi-angle feature is awesome!  To me, it's totally worth having to split up the show on 2 dvds to add the angle options.  It really feels like you're watching it live when you pick an angle and watch it uncut for a while.  I especially liked some of the isolated cameras that were on Phil so I could see some of the funny and interesting things he was doing which you couldn't always necessarily see in the full edit.  Phil really gives it his all in this show, and though his voice cracks a few times, he really sings the heck out of each and every song.  Ample screen time is also given to Tony, Michael, Chester, and Daryl.  The interviews included on both dvds with Mike, Phil and Tony are great because they give some nice insights into the concert set and song histories.  But what happily surprised me most about this concert is that none of the songs were from the same recordings that were on the live albums that went along with this tour!  It was great to hear slightly different nuances in these live performances than the ones I am used to hearing on the live cds...like Phil singing a bit of &quot;Misunderstanding&quot; in the old medley instead of &quot;You're Own Special Way&quot;, or him calling gasoline &quot;Petro&quot; in &quot;Jesus He Knows Me&quot; for the London audience.  The audience was actually one of the only disappointing things about this dvd.  For most of it they seem pretty dull and are sitting down and don't appear to add a lot of energy to the show.  But luckily near the concert's end they stand up and cheer more and there is more interaction between them and the band.   Overall, a fantastic dvd and a great addition to any Genesis fans' library!   And the menus and opening to this dvd rock!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I had never heard of this movie 'til I noticed it on the IMDB list of 200 Best Movies.  I figured it had to be worth a try ... and it certainly was!  I'm not sure it's quite as great as some of its biggest boosters claim it is, but it's definitely in the top 5% of the approximately 1,000 movies I've watched in my lifetime.<br />In an era of endless sequels and \\"copycat\\" movies, \\"Donnie Darko\\" is a true original: clever, thought-provoking, filled with surprises and delights and wry humor.  And while it is aimed primarily at younger viewers -- i.e. those under 25 or so -- it should be seen by anyone, of any age, who appreciates creative film-making.  Worth watching more than once -- and, as others have already said, you should definitely check out the website to get the most out of the movie.
0061020710|5.0|As I read the last few lines of this book, I laughed to myself, once again thinking how much Terry Pratchett's writing resembled that of Douglas Adams.  I felt that this book was everything that it should and could have been: it had all the humor, the style, and the satire that makes works such as Alice in Wonderland and the like last as long as they have.  This book is set up as four quests, each involving the wizard Rincewind, who was kicked out of the Unseen University knowing only one spell, and Twoflower, the tourist who is followed by a mysterious box on one hundred tiny legs.  If you have read anything by Douglas Adams, than you probably can base your decision regarding this book on that, if you enjoy the works of Adams, then this may be just the book you are looking for.  If you don't like Adams' books, then this would probably be just a waste of your money.
B00006HBUA|3.0|if you like saturday morning cartoons, then this movie is for you.  the basic story (except for the egos of daphne and fred) is pretty much standard scooby fare.  they go to a haunted amusement park on a creepy island to bust a mystery.  whereas the cartoon never really had any supernatural solutions to its stories (the supernatural stuff was stuff created by the villain to scare people away), the movie dabbles in occult mysticism....not recommended for the kiddies.  it also deals with soul-swapping, again not recommended for the kiddies.  this is more a young-adult oriented film, and it fails there.  it's too gimicky to hold the teens' attention, and very dumbed down.  the only redeeming feature was matthew lillard as shaggy....no one else, other than casey casem (and he's way too old), could've done this part right.  the voice, look, mannerisms, and pure joy of doing the part really shows.  he really loves his work and puts his all in every part he plays.  rock on matt!!
B00006CXXU|5.0|OK....so I'm a little late to the party, and I put off wanting/buying this, and tonight my husband and I got it.  I'm on my third listen and REALLY need to go to sleep, but want to keep listening!  What an incredible powerhouse voice full of emotion.  I'm not sure what made me think this was \\"like\\" a Britney Spears type bubble gum singer - NO WAY!!!  This gal is a woman, not a child!! And has a voice - I mean a real voice.  I too am a woman, not a child (41) and am very impressed. Very.

B000002UJQ|5.0|Let me begin by saying im more into true hip hop music, not the [stuff] out there today but in the early 90's. i bought this cd after seeing it in The Spin mag for one the best of the 90's. i was blown away! i never heard music like this before. i was hooked from the first guitar lick( and im a hip hop guy). this album speaks volums on todays society, but it was done in 1997! these guys are on point and its a truely GREAT album.... a must have!
0385504209|5.0|This book is such an amazing, page-turning thriller that I read it only in two days! It reminded me a lot of &quot;Conquest of Paradise&quot;, another religious thriller I couldn't put down. Both books kept me up late at night reading, unable to stop! This is definitely one of my favorite books, along with &quot;Digital Fortress&quot; (another Dan Brown). As with all of Brown's novels, as soon as you think you have the book all figured out, keep reading and he throws a curveball at you. Not only was the book exciting and excellent, but it was also intellectually engaging. Definitely recommended - a perfect book with the exception of the irrelevant title.
B000069AUI|5.0|When listening to this album you get a sense that Chris Martin has the underlining theme of &quot;What A Wonderful World.&quot;  Never has there been an album to affect me as much as this one. Not to say that there never will be or has there been...I mean Radiohead ranks right up there in my list.  But this album has something in it that no other album I have heard has. I can't put my finger on it or verbally explain what it is but its something.  I recommend this ablum to any one, it doesnt matter if your a metal-head, dead-head, or just like rap. ANYONE can benefit from this album.
B00006LLNU|1.0|I like this CD in small doses. But it can be very grating when the lead singer repeats nonsense words (they don't mean anything in Icelandic for those who don't know) over and over again, or when he moans.  But the music is so idiosyncratic anyway that knocking it for the moaning is pointless perphaps.  At its best, Sugur Ros is a 21st Century Cocteau twins with more discordance and less melody. I prefer Cocteau twins

B000003TBP|5.0|Beck has to be one of the geniuses in music today. Who else could take so many different genres, stitch them together seemingly at random, and come up with a product that is so easy to listen to? Nothing that I've listened to (and I've listened to a lot of stuff) can make that claim like Beck can. \\"Odelay\\" is, in a word: awesome.<br />Let's take a look at the tracks on this disc. \\"Odelay\\" starts out with \\"Devils Haircut,\\" a good indicator of what you can expect to hear on the rest of the CD: catchy drumbeats and hooks, noise which Beck's songs would almost seem naked without, and of course Beck's trademark lyrics. Next comes one of my favorite tracks, \\"Hotwax.\\" This one mixes a laid-back beat with just enough feedback, retro keyboard hooks, and even a little accordion to keep things funky enough for the rhymes (\\"I get down, I get down, I get down all the way...\\") to seem right at home with. And ya just GOTTA love the ending! (\\"Who are you? I'm the enchanting Wizard of Rhythm.\\") \\"Lord Only Knows\\" starts out with a scream that hints at a rocker of a song, then abruptly shifts into a straightforward (for Beck) country-type tune that can very easily be \\"goin' back to Houston.\\" \\"The New Pollution\\" is another one of the highlights here, with a groovy late '60s/early '70s vibe and a cool sax line thrown in for good measure. \\"Derelict\\" sounds like some Arabic song, which is vaguely seductive in nature. \\"Novacane\\" just plain rocks, with a serious truck-drivin', CB radio talkin' jam. \\"Jack-Ass\\" mellows thing out with a folky groove that seems to unravel (in a good way) at the end. Now we come to \\"Where It's At,\\" one of THE songs of '96/'97 and one of the main reasons I got this CD in the first place. \\"Two turntables and a microphone\\" indeed. Funky, old-school rap with that great organ hook. \\"Minus\\" reminds me of something that Kurt Cobain (RIP) would come up with the music for. \\"Sissyneck\\" is a smooth country/blues-tinged tune with a great bassline. \\"Readymade\\" is perhaps best-described as \\"spacey,\\" with enough \\"elevator music\\"/organ to keep it somewhat grounded. \\"High 5 (Rock The Catskills) is another rocker, sounding almost like something Kid Rock would do (check out the reference to \\"Novacane\\" in the middle of this one.) And last but not least, \\"Ramshackle\\" smoothes everything out with a very mellow, very folky sound. Keep listening after the end of this song for a little noise surprise.<br />Well, that's it. What else can I say about \\"Odelay,\\" other than if you have yet to obtain a copy, do so!
0800184327|3.0|some good dancing/music &amp; an occassional laugh; however, i found the story slow, cliche &amp; predictable. did i miss the scene  where the us/cuban governments began allowing hassle free travel for citizens between the us &amp; cuba??? a 2 star film with an extra star for vanessa williams, who is unbelievably gorgeous.
6302994063|5.0|seen the movie several times, and i still enjoy watching it. i recall my mom picking this one up, and i wasn't terribly interested considering the ballroom dancing theme. nevertheless, it took maybe 5 minutes before realizing this was more than some cheezy romantic comedy. the movie is a winner -- great story, acting &amp; dance. the movie has lots of laughs, and i particularly like the satirical humor derived from the rigid institutionalization of an art form -- dance in this case -- and those involved that take themselves far too seriously (i.e. barry fife, scott's mum, etc).

They remind me of the original album sound. But the new discs sound too muddy or dark and the high end (which includes things like acoustic guitars and cymbals) are rather flat or dead sounding. Like my fellow reviewer from San Diego said, \\"save your money\\". Keep your old discs. They simply sound better in a side by side comparison.

0446389234|5.0|I am not a Frank Miller fan. Nope. Didn't care for Daredevil (Hurt. Pain. Captions. Too many. Disjointed.), not a Sin City fan, though I admire its novelty, and although &quot;Dark Knight&quot; (and one other book) protrayed the Batman in a competent manner, the ghastly &quot;Return of the Dark Knight/DK2&quot; has shattered any credibility in the &quot;Miller&quot; name, as regards the Batman franchise. That said, the &quot;one other book&quot; besides DK that Miller actually performed on was Year One. An EXCELLENT portrayal of Batman's early career, with the major focus on a young, pre-Commissioner Jim Gordon, brilliantly rendered by Dave Mazzuchelli, a true illustrative master and the main reason why this dark and gritty book shines so bright in the firmament of Graphic Novels. If you are even REMOTELY interested in the Batman mythos, this should be in your collection- moody, pensive, with a decidedly heavy film noir atmosphere (and brilliant pre-computer coloring), this story captures the flavor of Gotham City and its troubled denizens like few other Batman narratives ever published. Highest possible recommendation
B000084T18|1.0|Another generic illiterate rapper lisping over headache-inducing &quot;beeeeeeeeetz&quot;, for the brainless, trendy, superficial teenagers nationwide. Whoopee. When will people realize this by NO means even remotely qualifies for music? When will people stop buying this and spew like it and pick up albums that actually take time, talent, and effort? To quote the Offspring, &quot;I have a feeling it'll be a long time&quot;.<br />Hit me with the Not Helpful vote!
B0000542D2|5.0|This movie is excellent with some really funny scenes in it in addition to the musical numbers. Plus I only saw the VHS version of it that came out last year and for me the quality was still great. The music sure sounds clean and crisp to me and does sound like it's in true stereo, not the fake stereo or mono versions that others have said. I think DVD's are truthfully highly overrated anyway. As long as you have a decent tv and speakers hooked up, even VHS movies look and sound great. I have seen many DVD movies and none of them blew me away because of their sound and picture quality. I'm not saying that We Were Soldiers, Windtalkers, Mr. Deeds, and Spiderman weren't great, but the quality and sound wasn't much different than the countless other VHS movies I've seen. All you DVD fans are nuts in my opinion. DVD is not the wave of the future or other nonsense that others have led you to believe. VHS is still great and worthwhile period. DVD's are only great in that the discs are more sturdy than VHS tapes, but only a few tapes I've had have gotten messed up--with most of them being just fine. Keep your VHS movies everyone and don't let the complainers get you down. A Hard Day's Night is a wonderful movie in every way, especially in VHS!!!
B000088E6M|1.0|Despite a plot, this cd and this rapper are nothing to recommend, to compare this guy to the late 2pac and biggie is ridiculous, 2pac had much more then just thug appeal, this is trite<BR>Thumbs Way Down.
B00008YLV2|5.0|The movie is an excellent account of the vicious battle in Mogadishu.  What makes this edition a \\"must-have\\" are the inclusions of \\"The History Channel Presents: The True Story of Black Hawk Down\\" and \\"PBS Presents: Frontline: Ambush in Mogadishu.\\"  The movie and the two documentaries paint a well-rounded picture of the battle and political consequences that followed, culminating in President Clinton's decision to withdraw from Somalia instead of confronting Adid, the man responsible for the ambush. <br />If you liked the movie, want to know more about the events but missed the documentaries, this 3-disc release is for you.
B000002BE9|5.0|I was very surprised that after this album Fiona dropped off the musical landscape, well, as far as the radios were concerned.  Fiona brings a sultry mix of blues, rock, and R&B to the table, along with edgy lyrics and fresh perspective.  Her vocal work is definitely above the bar.  She manages to be sexy but not overworked like Shakira, edgy but not grating like Alanis Morisette, and unique without all high pitched drama of Tori Amos.<br />This album brings something for everyone, from the song about female cruelty \\"Criminal\\", the adversarial \\"Sleep to Dream\\", to the creeping sensuality of \\"Slow like Honey\\".  Fans of female vocalists that have gotten fed up with overmarketed teen pop divas should give this one a serious listen.  Definitely for the mature audience.  If I could, I'd give it 10 stars.
B000002MUN|4.0|Tom Petty gives the impression of being musically honest, and he's usually sticking to his guns. His melodic pop rock has always found its way right to my heart. \\"Wildflowers\\" is a strong album even `tho it can't compete with the classic \\"Full moon fever\\". But with more or less excellent songs like \\"You don't know how it feels\\", \\"Time to move on\\", \\"You wreck me\\", \\"A higher place\\" and \\"Crawling back to you\\", this album is clearly one of the better from Petty and sure worth the money. The lyrics may sometimes be open for interpretation but overall it seems Petty deals with loneliness,  troubles and pain. And he does it in a very convincing way.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I was tentative to get this film at first, but have absolutely no regrets.  I really enjoyed the depth of the main character, and the uniquely interesting supporting characters.  The amazing part is this is an animated film. Totally outstanding for kids and adults.  My only hope is that some force in Hollywood doesn't attempt to turn this into a live action work with heavy CGI...it would ruin the beauty of the film and the experience.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|I'm such a big fan of the band, and this CD is simply AMAZING.  It is really the best thing they have come out with since Rumours, I think.  I must admit it took some getting used to, but I like that.  I easily get sick of songs that have too many hooks and are made specifically for being hits. (And so many people do that these days.) These 18 songs, though, are so cool, because everytime you listen to them, you hear something new, and you end up liking it more and more.  My fav is \\"Come\\" - a MASTERPIECE by Lindsey Buckingham that is out of this world. The rest of the songs are awesome too.  GET THIS!!! ITS AMAZING!!!
B00000I1OY|1.0|I'm sorry, but this movie is pure and utter [unacceptable material]. ... The acting and the screenplay is horrible, with lines like \\"You're belly is like a sack of hay,\\" not to mention Burt Lancaster walks around like he's bigfoot toward the end of the movie. Get serious people, go see a \\"good\\" movie. ... If you want to know how \\"The Swimmer\\" was meant to be shown, go read the short story. It's a lot better.

B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina is a true SINGER.  She knows how to show true emotion in her songs.  Giving us listeners a sense of loss, betrayal, fighting back, and over coming it all.  She fills that gap that most singers are missing in this music industry.  Plus, when I found out that she wrote all of her songs, but about two, it was even better.  She wants to let the world know that she is pure talent with out the pressure of the \\"business\\".  \\"Stripped\\" is the perfect title of her new CD because that is what it is.  To the bare essentials.  Just her wonderful voice with true raw human emotion.
0440237688|5.0|The Giver\\", a book review by Johannes and Vitali, two German pupils in the 10th grade<br />After we read the book in the English class at our school we'd like to give you a book review with our opinion about this book and we hope that this might help you.<BR>Jonas lives in a community where you are always observed and where you have to do everything you are told. At first he is happy in his community. He has friends and has a usual life as a citizen in his family unit. He lives together with his sister lily his father and his mother. In the community there are different ceremonies for every age. <BR>After the Ceremony of twelve Jonas is declared to be the new Receiver of Memory and starts his training with getting memories of many eras before he lived. He gets memories of war, elephant hunts, snow and riding a sled, sunshine and such things. But very important is that he learns to see colours. That's important because no one of the citizens can see colours. In this world they achieved \\"sameness\\". They got neither weather nor any differences between them. When Jonas begins to discover the dark side of the community he is in fear of it. He begins to see, that nothing is as perfect as it seems.<BR>He discovers that in this community many people are murdered every day when they break a rule or when they got to old. When the foster child Gabriel of his family unit shall be killed he decides to escape with him to \\"Elsewhere\\", a different and better world.<BR>The opinion of Johannes:<br />At first I found this book boring but when we read further parts of the book it got more and more interesting then I began to read this book with more interest and I began to read it very fast. In the end I found that book interesting and informative but I think that it is not really good written.<BR>The opinion of Vitali:<BR>I found it interesting to read about a book which deals with a different community and with other rules then we have. But I can't imagine that no one apart from the Receiver can see colours or hear music. First I found the book a little bit confusing, but then it was clearer. The book is well written but for a German pupil it is a little bit difficult to understand all the vocabulary. Also I think that the ending is felicitous, because it makes you think further, what could happen.
067144901X|5.0|This is the perfect book to read from newborn on up.  Boynton's fun rhyming style (a cow says \\"moo\\", a sheep says \\"baa\\", three singing pigs say \\"la la la\\") is enjoyable and catchy for the youngest listeners.  Both of my kids loved this book so much that more than one copy fell apart and had to be replaced (due to use, not poor quality.)  I have given it as a gift many times and it has been as well loved by everyone.  I am now buying a copy for my newborn nephew.  A must have in any baby or toddler reading library!
B00005JLSE|2.0|I wish I had seen this film before Moulin Rouge.<BR>That innovative musical made this one seem stale and old hat. It should have been made in the 50s. The film seems so delighted at poking fun at Chicago and its corrupt justice system -- jeez, that was fresh when Hecht and MacArthur wrote The Front Page three-quarters of a century ago. Now, after their masterpiece (and Roxy Hart, Some Like It Hot and dozens of other films) its premise is stale, stale stale. And unlike Moulin Rouge, which used an equally stale plot to re-invigorate the way movie musicals were presented, Chicago's staging was an stale as its story line.<BR>The musical numbers might have been staged by Vincent Minelli ... I didn't find anything fresh or innovative or even memorable.<BR>I was shocked that Renee Zellwegger's blah performance was on Oscar. At least she was better than Richard Gere -- what a disasterous performance.<BR>I didn't really hate this movie ... I was merely bored by it.
0790729628|4.0|While I respectfully agree with most viewers and the director that the director's cut is more artistically complete, I have to say it is shocking not to be able to see the &quot;Hollywood&quot; theatrical release, preferably on a second disc in a new Platinum release of this groundbreaking movie.<br />Are you listening, marketers? The VHS version is fast losing its magnetic particles for those of us who like to see the voiceover version and compare it to what Ridley Scott decided to release on DVD. Hey, they did 3 or 4 versions of Brazil on DVD and I own them all. Why not this one?
B00005JLWN|4.0|Don't \\"Forget the Matrix\\" as the cover says, but don't miss Equilibrium either. The last comparable B Sci-Fi movie was \\"Imposter\\".<br />Plot: In the future, there is no war and everyone takes a drug to quell their feelings, so everyone lives in a nice orderly society. Stopping your dosage or possessing banned items warrants execution. There is an underground that fights, occasionally blowing up a pharmacuetical facility and our main character gets involved with taking on the society's high cabal. So it's kind of a cross between the movie \\"1984\\" and a B version of the Matrix (it is loosely comparable). There could have been more done with Equilibrium than this, but it's a good movie. The fight scenes are cool and at times the acting was very well done, especially on Bale's part. The same rigidity that flowed for the character of \\"American Psycho\\" comes back with this non-feeling enforcer who finds humanity and realizes he is a mass-murderer. The story is somewhat empty in that, it's difficult to believe that a whole society could be so brainwashed as to be totally drugged, obedient and willing in the first place to implement such measures, but on the otherhand if I look around these days...
0316666343|3.0|Due to the storyline, I find it somewhat difficult to review this book without giving anything away.  I will say that this book proved to be a veritable dichotomy of unrelenting euphoria intertwined with an inexplicable cryptic moroseness.  Difficult to explain, yet when you read it you will understand.  Quite unlike any other book I've read in a while.<br />The characterization by Alice Sebold is superb as she engenders a genuine empathy for our amiable protagonist Susie along with an equally ineluctable disdain for the antagonist Mr. Harvey.  The entire book I found myself seeking justice for the tragic transgression committed - only to be somewhat let down at the anticlimactic conclusion.  Overall, The Lovely Bones proves to be a unique page-turner that you can't put down.  I liken it to a poor man's To Kill a Mockingbird - but that's still high praise, nonetheless.
0767836286|5.0|I started watching this movie around 11 PM...two hours later, I finally started breathing. The movie was exhilarating. It was probably the most intense movie I've ever seen. The suspense was incredible, the camera work was great (with several Hitchcock-esque shots added in the mix), the plot was nicely twisted. It was a great movie! If you're looking for an adrenaline rush, go check this movie out. It had my heart pumping at twice my optimal heart rate from the first minute of the movie. I can't really give any of the details of the movie away, because it would really ruin a lot of it. Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins were the perfect choice for both characters. I really wish I could say more about the movie, but this is the type of movie that would be ruined by knowing too much. Don't even read the cover of the movie<br />A few words of caution: this movie is not for the faint of heart. However, if you think you are partially faint hearted, just don't watch the first 5 minutes...which (at least for me), was the most disturbing part of the movie. There are several scenes of violence, and there is blood, but the violence isn't what makes this movie so intense..it is the suspense. The camera angles and the film score make the movie almost unbearable when it comes to suspense. I could have shared my seat with several other people because I *only* used the edge of it! There are many, many &quot;jump scenes&quot; (scenes that make you jump out of your seat), despite what Screenit.com says. The language isn't great, but it isn't horrible either. There are a few incidents of foul language, but it is fairly isolated.<br />I give this movie a thumb's up, but I can definitely think of better times/locations to watch it (I had to drive home at 1:15 AM after watching it...). I would prefer to watch this movie in broad daylight in my own house with a large blunt object in my hand.

0783225857|5.0|A must-see movie with Atticus Finch (Greogry Peck) at his best. I would rate his acting in this movie as flawless and the character Atticus Finch as my favorite movie character of all time-- frankly speaking I was so involved with the character that at one time or the other I thought I should become a lawyer..... Although Peter O' Toole lost the best actor oscar ---as Lawerance (Lawerance of Arabia) another amazing performance--- to Gregory Peck,, I don't think anybody would disagree that the oscar was given to the deserving... The movie has many emotional and dramatic scenes but my favorite is the court scene esp.. Finch's closing statement.....I suggest this movie to everyone and anyone.....
0375823360|5.0|If you're thinking about exploring a new series but are hesitant for one reason or another, let this be the review that pushes you to reading these books.<br />In the \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy, Pullman hits the literary nail right on the head.  The first book, The Golden Compass, puts in motion a unique world, somewhat like our own, with an even better storyline.  We follow Lyra, an untraditional protagonist, as she pieces together mysterious phenomena that surrounds children disappearing, possible parallel worlds, and fighting armored bears (to name a few.)<br />The second book, \\"The Subtle Knife,\\" maintains the momentum of the storyline, while you savor every page in \\"The Amber Spyglass,\\" the final installment.<br />A series for all ages, His Dark Materials is some of the best innovative fantasy/fiction, and rivals the best - Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, etc...  The story will stick with you for quite some time - no matter when you turned that final page.

B00005T7HX|2.0|...  When it came out, it was supposed to be like, the Saving Private Ryan of films portraying inspirational teachers.  Maybe it's today's idea of what does and doesn't touch the heart that has made Mr. Holland's Opus, [what] it is today.  [It] begins with the first scene, when we overhear news of the JFK assassination, which so obviously sets the time in which the film begins.  [It] continues when we see various 60's newsfootage montages intertwinded with the series of young lives Mr. Holland has touched with music including a reluctant clarinetest who grows up to be governor, and the big dumb jock, who joins the band and is later killed in Vietnam, not for the purpose of moving the story forward, but simply to steal a tear from [the] viewer...   the film addresses one real issue, when we see Dreyfus' character become distanced from his son, when it turns out he's deaf, and will never hear the music that is his father's world...  Everything about this movie is like, the idea that a screenwriter had, but decided not to use because it was just too contrived, but decided to use it anyway for whatever reason.  The edited for television version looses the only real human parts of the film, the ...teacher/student crush that garners a kiss, and the deaf swear from his son...  The whole film ends with a climax ...when Mr. Holland's job ends as his \\"Opus\\" is finally played, by ex school band members who love him, and we see, that despite the love, he still will be jobless...
0316666343|4.0|Forget the publisher's hype.  This is a good first novel with an interesting premise, and some fine spans of writing, but no classic. It would, in fact, be a much better read if many of the \\"and so time marches on\\" passages were edited out, leaving us with a page-turner of a novelette.  Many of the characters are one-dimensional, and a disturbingly Dickens-like \\"God Bless Us Everyone\\" echo is included at the end of a (now mandatory?) happy ending.  That's right--Susan Salmon sounds like poor Tiny Tim at the very end of the book.  Deus ex machina is alive and well since its rehabilitation in The Color Purple.  Not to worry, however, because I'm sure this will be a selling point for the folks at Dreamworks Studios.  The same folks who gave us technicolor heaven for gladiators and a final chance for a robot to find lost love in \\"AI\\" would find everyone (somehow) finding their way back for a final get-together and photo shoot at the Salmon's no problem at all.  May I suggest Robin Williams for the quirky murderer, who \\"gets his\\" in a way that is sure to draw whistles and hurrahs (and scattered laughter?) from the ladies in the audience?<br />Another disturbing point: Susan comes back from the dead to take over the body of poet Ruth and then proceeds to make love with her first flame, but the whole scene strikes one as morally ambiguous as there was no explicit \\"permission\\" given by Ruth for the ghost to gratify herself at the expense of the living body of her former classmate.  This is all, once again, part and parcel of the rush for a happy ending.<br />Besides these obvious flaws, there are beautifully written passages in this book that almost brought me to tears.  The author really does give us a convincing picture of the anguish and confusion that families feel when they have lost a loved one to violence.  There is something so sad, so poignant in the things that Susan says as she looks back from her \\"heaven\\" at the people she knew and loved as they go about the task of salvaging their lives. The author has genuine insight into these disturbing matters. Those \\"authentic\\" sections earn this book its four stars, in my opinion, and not the flawed workmanship.e task of salvaging their lives.

B0000025D0|5.0|Released twenty five years ago, Darkness confirmed that Springsteen's talents were greater than the hype that had been a part of the Born to Run period. The characters in these songs have bitter disappointment and regret inside them, and the majority have lost the sense of innocence and youthful dreams that were a major part of the BTR album. The hunger and optimistic attitudes have been worn down, to be replaced by a more world weary, yet still defiant character. <br />Compare the start of the Born to Run album, <br />&quot;The screen door slams<BR>Mary's dress waves<BR>Like a vision she dances across the porch, as the radio plays&quot;,<br />to <br />&quot;Lights out tonight trouble in the heartland<BR>Got a head-on collision smashin' in my guts, man<BR>I'm caught in a cross fire that I don't understand&quot;<br />The contrast and shift in mood and atmosphere could not be greater, and Badlands sets the tone for the next 43 minutes. Always a master of pacing an album, this is best illustrated on Darkness, as the stories and characters combine to create the ultimate snapshot of the American Dream turned sour. Springsteen's own problems and experiences are evident on &quot;Something in the Night&quot;, where the despondent narrator bitterly admits,<br />&quot;You're born with nothing,<BR>and better off that way,<BR>Soon as you've got something they send <BR>someone to try and take it away&quot;<br />In two lines Bruce sums up his attitude towards the court case that prevented him from recording, and nearly curtailed his career. The song that has perhaps lasted as well as any other on the album is Racing in the Street, a heartbraking tale of tattered dreams and lost hopes that may be one of the finest songs Springsteen ever wrote. I don't consider this a depressing album, nor a downbeat one. It is however the album that would tie the artist to the audience, and ensure that this was not a one hype wonder, but a man for all times.
038572179X|5.0|I believe this book could become a classic.  It is a wonderful and disturbing story that is beautifully crafted.<br />At times the story moves very slow, as in the beginning where there seems to be an excess of character development going on, then BAM!  You need this information to understand why everyone reacts the way they do.  The monotony of Briony's experience in nursing school is truly felt, then BAM!  War starts and you feel the change of pace.  My reading sped up as well as my heart rate.<br />The story is awe-insiring.  Sometimes when I finish an enjoyable book I might think, &quot;I could have almost written that.&quot;  But after a book like Atonement, I think &quot;Not in five lifetimes could I write like that!&quot;<br />This book is a must-read, but not if you are in the mood for a light read.  This is a thinker's book, well worth your time.
6303921248|5.0|This movie really hooked me when it was initially aired on A&amp;E. I finally decided to buy it and was not disappointed. It exceeded my expectations and I loved it all over again.
B000021YQV|5.0|System of a Down started off as a rather clumsy band with their s/t-debut.  This album took them in a new direction.  Instead of the crazy, disjointed \\"noise\\" of their first album, this one is a beautifully-produced, heavy-yet-melodic, and truly powerful thrash (not \\"nu\\") metal album.  But before I go any further, I would like to make a little rant: WHAT'S THE BIG ...DEAL WITH CHOP SUEY?  Chop Suey is an average track, at least when compared with the rest of the album.  The lyrics are nonsensical, the music is slightly above average, and yet that's the song you hear all the time: walking down the street, turning on your car radio, asking your friends to put on some music.  Chop suey this!  Chop suey that!  Face it!  It's not that great of al song!<br />Anyway, despite what I've said, chop suey is still a good song worth listening too, although it's nothing compared to ATWA, Aerials, Science, and Deer Dance, to name the highlights of the album.  There is a hidden track at the end of Aerials, entitled \\"Arto\\", which is a bit of folk music, and is also quite good.<br />The songs are short, but they seem just the right length.  The lyrics are usually very interesting, although in some songs they're just plain dumb.  And the musicianship is outstanding.  Now, if only we could get Serj to play rhythm guitar; that would really make SoaD outdo themselves.<br />All in all, this album shows that metal can be great even in the mainstream, so polluted by the likes of Kid Rock &c.  Even if your snobby about your At the Gates and Dimmu Borgir CDs, don't dismiss this album.  It's definitely worth it.

B00005B36H|5.0|First off, lets set the record straight....the reviewer from the USA as they called themself must not know much about music to say that 3 doors down and system are better than Tool. Tool takes advantage of many musical tecniques that would blow the minds of one hit wonder musicians like 3 doors down.  System isn't bad, but they are hardly in a class with Tool. Yes, they did play the hell out of Schism (worst song on the album).<BR>Other than that, this is probably my favorite Tool album. As many times as I listen to it, it never gets old (save schism). Parabola and Triad are probably my favorite songs on the album because of their unique time changes and composition. Once again Danny Carey blows the mind of any music fan by his drumming, he is right up there with greats like Portnoy.
0812550706|4.0|Ender's Game is a wonderful book. It is a really easy read and so exciting that you won't want to put it down. Ender's character is taken from his home at age six and is constantly being manipulated by his commanders at battle school so he'll save the world from the buggers. They try to make him feel okay about hurting others so he can help them. He is able to win all of his &quot;simulated battles&quot; because he uses strategy and can understand his enemy. The more he learns about the enemy he questions whether or not they are that bad. I would highly recommend this book to everyone. The ending will shock you!
B00008LDPU|5.0|Lots of good things to say about this DVD, but the main thing is that some of the segments are just... hauntingly beautiful. <br />This mainly goes for The Second Renaissance I and II. Which is sometimes extremely gruesome, but has an important story to tell. It also has some fantastic abract imagery that won't soon leave you.<br />The same can't be said for &quot;Beyond&quot;, which has much less story, and no action, but which is even more beautiful in all its understatedness. If you like good drawings, I beg you to notice this masterpiece. It is probably the single most beautifully drawn piece of animation I have ever seen. Not the least the *composition* of the frames is amazing. <br />The concepts of the Matrix (what is reality? and are we prisoners?) are important to think about our situation in this world, and when they are represented as beautifully as here, they are a pleasure to consider also.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|I love this album, it has some remarkable tracks which will no doubt become Mac classics, however there are some poor songs too.  The problem is that there are too many tracks when realy they should have cut it down to 10 or 12 and just had the good stuff. IMO skip to track 7 and you will find an amazing album, esp Smile at You and Bleed to Love You.
B000021Y7X|5.0|I was a minor Talking Heads fan before this video was shot, but didn't see it until around 1987, having rented it from a video place.  It was and still is my all time favorite concert video.  David Byrne, Tina, Chris, and Mr. Harrison are brilliant.  The supporting musicians and singers?  Simply awesome.  From the bare stage begining of Psyco Killer, to Life During Wartime, and Crosseyed and Painless, every song is a work of musical art.  This is no overly produced star fest.  The music takes center stage.  Jonathan Demme was supurb.  I will probably never tire of watching this.  A sure fire way to brighten your day.  Even a non fan would probably be hooked to this!  My favorite song is probably the second... Heaven  Heaven is a place.  A place where nothing, nothing ever happens....as the roll the set out to the stage.  Brilliant
B00005JKPF|5.0|The new X-Men movie was so awesome! It deserves 5 stars and could almost beat Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter in the greatest movies! <BR>The movie begins where the last one left off...Magneto in his plastic prison and Professor Xavier at the school of mutants. But this time, a mutant-hater named William Stryker is arranging attacks to prove that we should kill mutants, and this heats both Magneto and Xavier up. So what do they do? They join forces and fight with the other X-Men against Stryker and while doing so escape an exploded dam and fly away from F-16's.<BR>If you don't think the movie sounds good, well, the stars of the movie are great, especially Shawn Ashmore and Anna Paquin. Are you going to see it? I highly recommend it, and it is defiently worth [the money] anyday!
B00008PX8P|5.0|I have collected over 50 Zep bootlegs over the years, and I used to be (and still am) a total fanatic. I have heard and seen a lot of stuff, and believe me the Earl's Court 1970 performance that starts Disc 1 is totally UNBELIEVEABLE!!! 2 tracks from CODA were taken from this show and edited down--\\"I can't quit you baby\\" and \\"We're gonna groove\\" (fyi). \\"White summer\\", Page's solo, will leave you in awe, as will Bonham's \\"Moby Dick\\"--these guys solo so fast, they MUST have made a deal with the devil! \\"How Many More Times\\" is unlike any version I've ever heard. So there's some true rarities here. I haven't even seen the rest yet--but I would have paid $40 for this show alone.

0156027321|3.0|Like many others I read this at the recommendation of a friend.  It was a struggle to read, bringing to mind the horror of having to read Old Man and the Sea back in high school. I don't argue that the book is unimaginative, it's just that NONE of the ideas struck me as new.  It's an awfully long book to ultimately be so unoriginal.
B000003N7G|5.0|This is a masterpiece of the 20th century and all music. John G must not know music.  Elvin Jones accompaniment to the whole album is inevitable and great. McCoy Tyner produces overly complex solos which flow extremely well and to criticize either of them, or for the worst, John Coltrane is a mistake. Anyone that says that the whole groups playing is \\"out of rhythm\\" or \\"lose the beat\\" needs to get out there and learn about music!!! Even worse, to compare this to Kenny G is an insult. Kenny G didn't practic a millionth of the hours Coltrane did. Kenny G doesn't or will never have a group like Coltrane had. Kenny G will just never be as good as Coltrane. However, to get off this topic, this album is great. Again, I will compliment on Elvin Jones and McCoy Tyner, they are truly great Jazz musicians. <BR> I ditto S. Bryson's remarks and just want to reinforce his point to Johnny G about what music really is, and I'd like to tell everyone that read's this that this is one of the greatest if not the greatest jazz album ever.
0316776963|3.0|As I purchased this book simply because it appears on so many Francophile Amazon.com listamania lists, I prepared myself for a throughly enjoyable and hysterically humorous read based on the 400+ reviews that pumped up the pleasure factor of this book to the almost unrealistic level of master satirist Mark Twain.  While the book is funny, I was disappointed to discover that it really was not about France or the French---the essay entitled \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\", indeed narrates the author's amusing and insightful struggle with learning the French language while at a language school in Paris, but it is only one out of perhaps four or five essays about France, the majority of the book deals with Sedaris' issues with himself and his colorful family back in the US.  (Now, please, just because I am warning those Amazon customers who wish to purchase a book about France and the French and were directed to this book by listamania listings, don't immediately click the \\"no\\" button as if the rest of my review isn't worth reading. Alas, I was sadly misdirected as most likely others are, too and should not be penalized for telling the truth as I see it. Nor should anyone rate anyone's review negatively simply because it expresses an alternative opinion.)  Because of this misdirection, I read the first half of this book--which has nothing to do with France--with anticipation of when France and the French were going to pop up in the author's humorous anecdotes and musings regarding this understanding of life.  By the time I got to the second part, where Sedaris travels to Paris with his boyfriend, I had already realized that this book of essays was just that: a book of essays containing only a few essays about France.  I confess to skimming through the contents of each essay before deeming it worthy of my time--sorry to those of you who simply love everything Sedaris--and I will say that the French essays in the book are well worth the read---I just wish there had been a whole book dedicated to just this topic.<br /><br />Therefore, if like myself, you have happened upon this page simply to read a book about France, save your money and either read the few French themed essays in the library or bookstore. Buy instead \\"On Rue Tatin\\"--the telling of an American woman and her husband who buy an old convent north of Paris or any of the Provence books by UK author Mayle. These books are not meant to be funny in a satirical manner, but instead convey an idea of the French and their country from alien prospectives.book dedicated to just this topic.  <BR><BR>Therefore, if like myself, you have happened upon this page simply to read a book about France, save your money and either read the few French themed essays in the library or bookstore.

0062502182|5.0|&quot;The Alchemist&quot; in my opinion is probably one of the best mystery/science fiction books ever written. In the book Coelho(author) describes each scene to a single detail. He hooks you to the story in an uncanny way, you literaly feel the story grabing you and pulling you into the the pages. &quot; The Alchemist&quot; is the king <BR>of all books.<br />   The story begins with a young boy contemplating his future in life. He had the mind of a dreaming Romeo and the heart and courage of a saint. All his life he has wanted to travel, see the world , explore. He was born and raised in the same old village he grew up in, he never left a foot outside it. Until the day came that Santiago (the boy) decided that he was a man and he had to forgo his dream. His father was outraged and insisted that he stayed and become a sheperd like him. Although his father begged him not to go, Santigo left with 10 sheep his father gave to him.  <br />   The only reason Santiago wanted to leave so badly other than his dream to exlpore and the hatred of staying in one place for your whole life, was because he visted a Jypsy fortune teller and she told him that he would find a treasure after a long and rough journey to the piramids so he thats were he intended to go.<br />  From there Santiago end up in a small town where he meets an old man. Santiago and the old man talk for hours and hours and what the were talking about was the Alchemist. The Alchemist possesed such powers to which he could turn any metal into gold. He also knew many remidies to sicknessess. The Alchemist was also a very wise man able to persuade almost any man. At the old kings departure he gives the boy two rocks. One a white rock, and the other a black rock. He tells the boy to learn the language of the desert and until he did, he should never forget the following. The black rock means no, and the white rocks means yes, and also to never ever, deny nor ignore omens(sort of speacial signs warning you of things tocome).<br />  After the old man leaves Santiago get in a series of mishaps and unfurtunate incidents. He gets robbed twice and almost killed. Although in the beggining of the story Santiago believes that he has lost his true love, in the end of the story he falls in love and marries a jypsy woman. After all the crazy things that happen in the story Santiago does indeed live his dream in traveling and returns home to a furtune.<br />   I highly recomend this book to readers of all ages. The text is not hard to understand is very addictive.<br />  By : Anthony Alfaro

B00008H2LB|4.0|This CD had the potential to have 5 stars and be by far the best rap/metal CD ever. The problem I have with Linkin Park is that they ruin a perfectly good song with yelling at the end almost every time. I find myself listening to the songs and then when they start yelling, skipping to the netx track. The band should have realized by now that their two most popular songs &quot;In the End&quot; and &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot; both don't have yelling in them. <br />Basically, the CD is pretty good and I would reccommend it to anyone who liked Hybrid Theory. If you aren't really a Linkin Park fan, then the yelling might annoy you and you may want to steer clear of this album.
B00005JM09|1.0|These are the reasons I think this film will fail.<BR>1. James Cameron Passed on it. That says a lot.<BR>2. No Linda Hamilton.<BR>3. John Conner looks like Doctor Bashir from Deep Space 9. Weak. What happened to the tough scar faced John Conner from the future in T-2?<BR>4. A hot chic Terminator? Give me a break. Talk about cashing in on the strong woman hero fad. I'm sure they are hoping her nude appearance in the beginning will be enough to get the nerds to the theater. Plus the name Termi-matrix? Machines don't have gender, they have numbers like T100 or T1000, they might as well have called her Brittney.<BR>5. Another terminator is sent back in time to protect John Conner from another more advanced Terminator, sound familiar?<BR>6. When will they realize that in order for the machines to finally be beaten John Connner must die. His birth started all this, if he dies then no Terminators would ever have come through time and no parts would have been available to create Skynet<BR>7. Really bad trailers, this is always a bad sign.
B00006690G|5.0|This new Eminem album is great addition to an Eminem lover's collection. This album is very well edited / recorded / written and it is by far some of Eminem's most refined work. What makes this album different than his previous ones is that it seems actually more soft and less of that \\"I just don't give a f***\\" attitude. The hit song \\"Without Me\\" you have heard I'm sure and it is basically a new verion of our old favorite \\"The Real Slim Shady.\\" <br />In conclusion, this album is great if you like Eminem and especially if you wish he went a little softer and had some better messages. There's less complaining and whining like on the Marshall Mathers LP and almost every song sounds great.
B00008LDPU|4.0|the animatrix is a collection of 9 short storys made by japans most talented artists and directors personally i do not like cartoons or any show figureing colorful characters but since its the matrix that was an acception when it came out on dvd which was today i went and purchased it and watched the entire dvd now here my striahgt forward review on all of the short storys based on the matrix<br />1.Final Flight of The Osiris- this was an amazing piece of art it had really great visual effects and a good story one of the best action storys on the DvD<br />2.The Second Renaissance Parts 1-2 this piece probually had the best story of all the 9 storys it tells the backstory of the downfall of the humans and the rise of the machines i find this piece quite disturbing brutal, yet i also find it simply the best<br />3.Kids Story- this was good quite good its about a kid that recieves a message from Neo telling him that agents are after him when recieving this message the kid quickly moves about running from the agents until his death and his departure from the matrix<br />4.Program- about 2 samurai warriors facing off at each other in a duel i thought this one was great because the fighting was so impressive this one is a thumbs up<br />5.World Record- this one was a so-so it was enjoyable and bland it isnt the best but it did keep me intrested mainly about a runner that is so fast that he could run into and out the matrix anytime he wants <br />6.Beyond- this one was werid yet confusing at the same time its about a girl who is looking for her cat and runs into a group of kids that can float and do tricks in the air then she discovers that she can do those tricks also it appears to me that the story Beyond is about a glitch in the matrix<br />7.A Dectective Story- animated in black and white this story tells about a dectective that is hard up for cash he gets a phone call by agents saying that he he can catch a computer hacker by the name of trinity that he will be payedhe sets out for trinity later learning that the reason the agents wanted to have him find her was because the agents placed a bug into him and are tracking his every move<br />8.Matricculated- where can i begin this one was a downfall or at least to me this was quite confusing no actually really confusing and very bland bummer since it was the last one but it did have some good points but those were spent quickly<br />over all - if you like the matrix then this is a must buy it is very good it deserves 4 stars only because of matricculated and world record and beyond but i would rather watch world record and beyond over matricculated any day overall not a bad dvd buy if you like the matrix----Ben N.
B000000W5F|5.0|Little T & A is not a song about little trains and automobiles, it's about certain parts of a girl's body, and Keith Richards performs the vocals on it very well. This is one of those CD's where Jagger and the rest of the crew, don't pull any punches. You're going to get Rock And Roll, but, you're also going to get some \\"Head Music\\" on songs like \\"Heaven\\". Their number one smash \\"Start Me Up\\" is on this CD, along with the ever popular ballad \\"Waiting On A Friend\\". There's the fun rocking songs \\"Neighbors\\", and \\"Hang Fire\\", and the funky song titled \\"Slave\\". I like these songs the most, but the rest of the CD is pretty cool. And if you like fun videos, by all means get the videos to Tattoo You. The \\"Neighbors\\" video is especially cool. This is a mix of blues rock, rock and roll, and \\"head\\" music.
B0000524CY|5.0|This is hands down the most terrifing movie ever made. I rented The Exorcist from blockbuster with some friends and watched it at midnight. Needless to say, I didn't get any sleep at all. If this classic horror film doesn't scare you nothing will. I saw it once and that's going to be it for a while.
0385486804|3.0|The book turned out to be interesting and left me wondering what really happened to Chris...Krakauer respected the life of Chris and honored his memory, but still provided the reasons native Alaskans thought Chris died.  If you are looking for a similar read to Into Thin Air this isn't it...but good nonetheless.
B000068PQ0|5.0|Having grown up on great progressive albums like Dark Side of the Moon, the earlier Alan Parsons fare, and the Buggles' masterpiece &quot;The Age of Plastic,&quot; I had come to accept that the era of progressive rock is over and that true concept albums are beyond the grasp of any of today's musicians. <br />But the Flaming Lips have proved me wrong with &quot;Yoshimi.&quot; Of the previously mentioned works, &quot;Yoshimi&quot; is closest musically to the Buggles. But in addition to interesting songwriting and tight playing, the Lips layer on delicious washes of shimmering synth much more than the Buggles did, and the concept feels just as wonderous as &quot;Age of Plastic.&quot;<br />Perhaps comparisons to previous progressive concept albums aren't really even a fair way to approach it. This album has a very different feeling to it. It deserves a place in the Modern Progressive Rock Hall of Fame on its own merits.
B000001DTM|5.0|Achtung Baby returns U2 to the level of greatness that the Joshua Tree accomplished. However, it is a completely different sounding album. It is more balanced than Joshua; not a single bad song can be found, and from the opening riffs of Zoo Station, you'll be hooked. Here's a breakdown of the tracks.<br />Zoo Station (C): Great riff and a good beat but I don't like the vocals. The upbeat music, however, makes for a good opener.<br />Even Better Than The Real Thing (B): A good song, but there's not much to say about it. Very similar to the rest of the album, nothing particularly special. Can also be found on the Best Of 1990-2000 collection<br />One (A+): The masterpiece. Everyone probably knows this song, and for good reason. Maybe U2's best song, I'd put it up there with \\"With Or Without You.\\" This song will be stuck in your head for a very long time. The best song on Achtung.<br />Until The End Of The World (A+): The second best song on Achtung also gets an A+ rating. One really should have multiple pluses at the end, but this song is great too. Bono's vocals sound more like talking at points but it works. Nice guitar work by The Edge.<br />Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses (A): The third best song rounds out the very impressive trio of One, Until The End Of The World, and this. This is typical U2.<br />So Cruel (A-): The longest song on Achtung clocks in at 5:49. With great piano and some strange lyrics, So Cruel is a nice softer song.<br />The Fly (B): Originally the first single off Achtung, The Fly is one of the stranger songs. Great loud starting music and good vocals lead to an interesting chorus that has both, according to the lyrics, an opera voice and a low voice. More great work from The Edge. <br />Mysterious Ways (A-): Most people know this as it was a huge FM hit. The lyrics don't make much sense, but this song is very catchy. <br />Tryin' To Throw Your Arms Around The World (B-): Not really a bad song but not nearly as impressive as most of the restof Achtung. You may find yourself singing the chorus, but overall the song doesn't really stand out.<br />Ultraviolet (Light My Way) (A): An intro that isn't really that good turns into a very good upbeat song. The chorus of \\"baby baby baby light my way\\" might be the single catchiest line on Achtung Baby. Easily one of the best songs on the album.<br />Acrobat (A): A very dark song, but that doesn't stop it from being great. I love the chorus in this one.<br />Love Is Blindness (D): My least favorite song on the album and I really wish it wasn't last. Acrobat would have been a fine closer. Another dark, slow song. Not terrible but this one just doesn't work for me.<br />Overall, Achtung Baby is a must have. It's as solid of an album as Joshua Tree but because U2's style evolved so much, it's hard to compare them. This is surely one of U2's finest albums. Buy it now; you won't be wasting your money.
B00005LQ04|3.0|This has been my favorite horror film for the past 15 years, and I was SO excited to get this DVD. Yes, the picture quality was the best the movie has ever looked-- Razor-sharp picture and ultra-intense colors. However, anyone who is familiar with this film knows half of \\"Suspiria\\" is the incredible soundtrack by Goblin. On the old Magnum VHS/Image LD, the music was so powerful. It really plunged you into the creeped-out atmosphere of the movie. But some fool at Anchor Bay decided to mix down the music!  The opening taxicab ride through the storm originally had the main theme playing much louder, but on the DVD this music practically disappears into the background. Sound levels are inconsistant throughout- a ballet lesson by the Nazi-esque Miss Tanner is very loud, but the famous double murder at the beginning of the film is subdued to the point of losing much of it's impact! In effect, this movie has been practically castrated!  <BR>I'm glad the movie is available, I just wish that whoever did the sound mixing for the 5.1 would have done justice to the film's original sound design. I could have done without the faded and unspectacular lobby card reproductions too.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay's sophomore release is much better than Parachutes, their mellow, altogether easily forgettable debut. Clearly the band has become more sophisticated in the way that they compose their music, and have gotten more experience.<br />The songs on the CD are very good, ranging from the inspirational to the sympathetic. Though most of the songs include synthesizers and pianos, a couple of tracks (&quot;Green Eyes&quot; and the title track &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot;) are acoustic. Chris Martin's mournful vocals on &quot;The Scientist&quot;, &quot;Warning Sign&quot;, and &quot;Politik&quot; show real feeling and passion for the music, a feeling that we only got a small taste of on &quot;Parachutes&quot;. &quot;Clocks&quot;, &quot;Whisper&quot; and &quot;Daylight&quot;, my personal favorite track, leave your mind open for thought and inspiration.<br />If you are torn at all between &quot;Parachutes&quot; and &quot;Rush of Blood to the Head&quot;, I would say that the latter is probably the better buy. Where &quot;Parachutes&quot; is unsatisfying, &quot;Rush of Blood&quot; shows a band that is more experienced, more influenced, and definitely more improved since their first release.
B00005JLEU|2.0|I had not heard about \\"Spirited Away\\" until it won awards. When a relative happened apon a pre-release video copy, he passed it along to us because we are huge Disney fans. My husband, 2 daughters and I love Disney animated movies. My older daughter, who is 6, had to run and hide 1/4 of the way into \\"Spirited Away\\". She has never done that from an animated movie before. Watching the parents turn into pigs was too much for her! <BR>The animation is beautiful but the story line is disjointed and many parts are not explained. It is as trippy as the Teletubbies. I'm glad I saw it once, but it certainly won't be watched until the tape wears out like \\"Toy Story\\"!
B0000931OG|5.0|i think this album is great, and i heared all the music about blur and all the artists britpop music. i thinks this is a simple album and i like it!<BR>i see they dont have evolutionated so much on this album cos its like keep the same of the others cds of their. but you cannot critic the sound cos its great!. my favorite is &quot;Out of time&quot; &quot;sweet song&quot; and 5 more songs.
B00005JLWN|5.0|I am not a person of many words; I will not summarize this movie. Here are my feelings of it. The action is second to none. There is no doubt this will become a cult classic. GET THIS MOVIE. The ending alone is worth the cost. Need I say more?
B00005JKNF|5.0|\\"Gosford Park\\" is perfect for the dvd medium. <BR>A murder mystery set in the early 1930's in a mansion in England, more than a dozen main characters (and a number of other supporting ones) flit by you in the first few minutes. Even for the most die-hard movie viewer, there is a lot to keep track of throughout the movie.<BR>First and foremost, the plot: a group of well-born (and some not so well-born) Englishmen and women gather with their servants for a weekend house party. Of course, the inevitable murder takes place and the inevitable investigation ensues. However, the murder is in many ways the least interesting thing about this movie. The movie really focuses on the English class structure and the clean break between those \\"upstairs\\" and those \\"downstairs.\\" Emily Watson and Helen Mirren will break your heart as two of the more poignant members of the downstairs. As for the upstairs-ah, well, that's really where the murder is taking place-not of an individual, but slowly of an entire class. <BR>When you see the movie several times, you can enjoy different aspects of it. The dialogue is quick and clever. The performances are for the most part, outstanding.(When you have an ensemble of this size, you're bound to have an off performance or two).<BR>The DVD is outstanding. It features two different voice over ttracks of the film-one from director Altman and one from the writer. <BR>I would recommend this movie to lovers of Bob Altman, of English murder mysteries, of serious films with higher purposes.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I have been waiting for some time for this release, and I was not dissappointed...  This is a MUST for any Zeppelin fan.  The live footage is really great, and the guitar solos are awesome.  This is the motion picture version of the best band out there.  Check it out!
B00007E8V4|4.0|I like this CD for the most part, but its an assult on your senses. The speed hardly ever stops the whole way through the CD, I think they could do a little better if they make their songs a bit deeper and longer.
0767819543|2.0|What's all the noise about \\"Central square\\" if nothing in it adds up? It is just one more example of cinematic trash, this time not from Hollywood but from Rio, where everything is settled before you start watching it. There are a few bearable scenes in this movie (people dictating their letters, etc.) but on the whole it is banal and boring. <BR>A child loses his mother in a street accident. Does he cry, you may ask? No, he does not. Why doesn't he? Is it because he is a \\"tough\\" kid (oh, these tough Brazilian kids living in the streets!) used to hard facts of life? No, he is not tougher than anyone else, and he has never lived in the street. But he still doesn't cry. Why doesn't he cry then? The answer is simple - because this movie is a fairy tale, and in fairy tales one does not want to be distracted by so insignificant events like, for example, a boy's mother's death. Fairy tales are made to be enjoyed, preferably with a can of soda and a pack of pop-corn in the vicinity, not to be thought about or, God forbid, affected by it. Why bother about it if it is only distractful? Let's move immediately to the real business, which, in the given case, is the glorious idea that every ordinary man is really an unrecognized saint doing great deeds (the idea is also rather comforting, since it does not require you to do anything except for watching movies - why do anything if I am already a saint, albeit not yet recognized). The movie starts, and from its very beginning we are given to know that an ugly haggard, at first not showing too much concern about our unhappy young hero (and even exphibiting other human faults), is to be redeemed by him towards the end of it. And so she does get redeemed. And so we sit back and revel in this beautiful tale of a lost woman found by a lost boy. And wonder at how amazing this world is. Nicely packaged. Designed especially for people who are into \\"spirituality\\".
B00007BH5C|5.0|The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers soundtrack is 1) an excellent score cd 2) a worthy companion to its predecessor the Academy Award winning The Fellowship of the Ring. Howard Shore returns to write the music for the next chapter of Jackson's films. The Two Towers has a mixture of new and old themes. Enya, a fixture on the Fellowship soundtrack is not featured on the Two Towers soundtrack. The Fellowship theme, the Isengard theme, the Rivendell theme, the Mordor theme, and the Hobbit theme all make reappearances, but added amongst them and comprising most of the cd are new themes. The Rohan theme is a very Vikingish theme replete with strings and percussion. Treebeard's theme, is a very soft kind of &quot;forresty&quot; music with a chorus to give it a mysterious air. It has many of the same qualities as the Ewok theme in Return of the Jedi. Arwen's theme is different from the first soundtrack, first because there is no Enya and second because its more of a melancholy love theme. Gollum's theme matches the character, kind of slimy sounding. As in the Fellowship, Shore uses different choirs very effectively, giving the elves an ethereal sounding choir, etc.  The only complaint I have about the Two Towers soundtrack is the second to last track &quot;Gollum's Song&quot; sung by Emiliana Torrini. I found this song to be out of character with the rest of the cd and didn't much care for it. Unlike Enya's &quot;May It Be&quot; from the Fellowship soundtrack, &quot;Gollum's Song&quot; employ's no elvish and really just sounds creepy. Fitting for Gollum and it fits perfectly in with the movie although listening to it alone takes some getttin used to. However, it does not detract at all from the listening experience. The Two Towers is an excellent cd, and while it does not surpass the Fellowship of the Ring soundtrack it is its equal.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|The Murnau Foundation should be commended for its landmark restoration of director Fritz Lang's \\"Metropolis\\" (1927). Even though 30 minutes of footage has been irrevocably lost, this silent classic now can be seen in the most complete and pristine version to date - abetted by the original orchestral score. Hopefully, more silent films will be preserved in the same fashion. Kino's DVD release is highly recommended, but try to see Lang's masterwork on the big screen.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Before The Fellowship of the Ring, I never paid much attention to Howard Shore, but after I heard his excellent score, I started to get more music composed by him. The music revolves around four basic themes: The theme for Isengard, the theme for the Black Riders, the theme for the Fellowship, and the theme for Hobbits. The range of music is extremely wide. The Black Rider theme is a very dark, gothic theme, while the Hobbit theme is very light and playful reminiscent of an old countryside folktune. The theme for Isengard is very strident percussion and brass with emphasize the evil building under Orthanc. The Fellowship theme is a very bold theme, only heard in its full glory 2 times on the soundtrack on tracks 11 and 13. The hints of most of these themes play in almost all the tracks of the film, however all of these tracks stand alone. For exapmle Amon Hen track 16 is one of my favorite tracks, because it provides a visual picture of what is happenning on the movie screen.  Choir is used effectively to heighten the emotion of any particular track. The cd is over 70 minutes long, and I wish it could be longer simply because the music is so enjoyable. Shore's score to this epic film belongs on the top ten score's of all time and it truly deserved the Academy Award that it won.  It is simply magnificent!
B000003S09|5.0|Okay, so yes, &quot;21st Century Schizoid Man&quot; could be the greatest hard rock song ever made.  I'll give it that.  I'll also give it the fact that &quot;Epitaph&quot; is so full of everything that KC would become that it's almost too much, and I'll go with the basic thought of everyone since the record first came out &quot;What the heck were they thinking with 'Moonchild'?&quot; But the title track, Jesus man, that's what music is all about...Three great songs, a so-so song and an almost unlistenable song.  A hell of a debut, and an album that still sounds beautiful.  The disc sounds wonderful, very clean, very loud, very...well just buy it okay?  Don't let the pigeonhole of &quot;Progressive Rock&quot; turn you off either.  This is NOT Yes, this is NOT ELP, this is not (early) Genesis.  This is the missing link between Black Sabbath and God.  In the Court of the Crimson King IS a masterpiece, even though it is flawed.  If you are interested enough to begin the long journey to discovery of all things Fripp-y, then this is the place to start.  Have fun with it, it's worth every penny and then some.

B000002HHB|5.0|For those of you who say &quot;I May Know the Word&quot; is too long, I must disagree.  This song couldn't be long enough.  It is by far my favorite on the album, and is one of my all-time favorite songs by any artist.  <br />The rest of the album is excellent as well.  It has a great flow to it from one song to the next.  Natalie's voice is just so moving, I can't see how there are people out there that don't notice it.  I listen to this album still to this day without being tired of any of it and will listen until it for many years to come.
B00009NH5W|5.0|This is an amazing album.<BR>Terence Trent D'arby or as he is now known Sananda Maitreya is a musical mastermind.  Each song on this album has a depth and sound unlike any other performer.  He mixes funk, rock, soul and spirituality in ways that not even Prince can match.<BR>If your a fan of TTD this album is for you. If your not yet a fan, you will be after you listen to this music unfiltered my the middle man-record industry... Honestly this is his best album ever.  Buy this album and you will not be dissapointed.  Stand out tracks are the funky sexy \\"Designated Fool\\".  The soul searching of \\"MY Dark Places\\", the beautiful \\"What Shall I Do\\" and the unforgetable \\"Sayin About YOu\\"....\\"I met TTD at his BB Kings Show In NYC and hung with him for about an hour...NOt only is he extremely humble and cool, but he is an amazing performer.....

B000001F3C|5.0|As a huge fan of U2 (and especially Bono... talk about eye candy!), I'd have to say that this CD is beautiful. It puts a deep and aware side to the otherwise fun-loving U2 vibe, although this CD was made before the big U2 style change. &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot;, one of the best and most famous U2 songs, really shares the guys' views on the so-called &quot;revolution&quot; that is going on in Ireland (the best country in the world, by the way). It is so passionate, you know exactly what they're talking about. There is another song on the CD called &quot;The Refugee&quot; that is actually my favorite on the CD. It talks about a girl who's Mom says one day her daughter will live in America. It really emphasizes the struggle and pain that refugees in other countries go through. It is an awesome song, although a little on the short side. All things considered, this is an unbelievable CD and a real breakthrough when it comes to inspirational CDs. I would give it more than 5 stars, but I'm not aloud to. Oh, and by the way, DO NOT miss #3 on the CD, &quot;New Years Day.&quot; It is a great song, although I don't really get the whole plot of it....

0393057658|5.0|I'm not much of a baseball fan and rarely pay attention to it until the playoffs. However, I'm a fan of Michael Lewis's ability to explore the nuances of business and the people who engage in it. I'll leave it to others to argue the contribution this book makes to the literature of the sport of baseball. There is no question, however, that it is one of the best business books I've read in recent memory. Like his previous books, Moneyball is a fascinating story filled with colorful, textured characters in which we are amazed to discover the paradox of business success: that winners are always flawed, their success not always as it appears at first. The book has given me a new appreciation of baseball, but more importantly a new appreciation of the need to always challenge the conventional wisdom of experts. Success comes not from having the right answers but by asking the right questions.
B0000024JA|4.0|1994 produced some sick albums that are considered classics, such as Illmatic. But no one ever really mentions Tical. Sure this is no classic, but it is still a bangin cut by my fave Wu member. The hottest tracks on this album, in my opinion are Bring The Pain, All I Need, Meth vs Chef, What The Blood Clot, Release Yo Delf. The other songs are still hot, but just a step down. There are only a couple songs that I'm just not feelin, like Sub Crazy. The lyrics are hot, but the beat is kinda, well, generic in some sense. The upside of this song is that it's only 2 minutes long, so you don't lose much interest in the album waiting for the next track. What I love about Release Yo Delf, is that Meth steps to the mic all hyped up after a short intro which is kinda like Gloria Gaynor's I Will Survive. This is one of the darkest and grimiest WU album....nah scratch that...this is one of the darkest albums in all of hip-hop. This is an essential album for fans of the older Wu albums (like 36 Chmabers) and Meth fans in general. Don't limit yourself to certain music just due to ratings, i'm out...1

B00005U2LM|4.0|Sometimes it's hard to be impartial when reviewing a band/group/artist you really like. That is the case at hand, but I must admit that this is by far the weakest album by Wu-Tang. I couldn't wait to buy this as soon as it came out, but I heard the complete album before its release and wasnt too happy. Wu-Tang is known for their unique, dark beats, but this album is commercialized as far as beats go. Don't get me wrong though, the lyrics are tight, typical Wu style. The two people that make this album good, Method Man and Inspectah Deck. A suprise in this album is the improvement of the not-so-good Cappadonna. Ghostface is Ghostface, bringing the random, yet hot verses to this cut. U-God &amp; Raekwon have seemed to decline lyrically over the past few years, but still do a decent job on the Iron Flag. <BR>RZA &amp; GZA both remain solid, and RZA has even improved lyrically. RZA's best work is still on Wu-Tang Forever. Masta Killa isn't on the album that often, which really isn't a good thing because he could have displayed his improvement. (For an example of this, check out Mortal Kombat by Afu-ra.) Below is the track rating (1-5):<br />In The Hood: 5<BR>Rules: 5+<BR>Chrome Wheels: 3<BR>Soul Power: 1 ( The beat is so annoying)<BR>Uzi: 4<BR>One Of These Days: 3.5<BR>Y'all Been Warned: 5<BR>Babies: 3<BR>Radioactive: 3.5<BR>Back In The Game: 4.5<BR>Iron Flag: 4<BR>Dashing: 4.5
0316666343|4.0|Lovely Bones is a wonderful book of heart wrentching compassion that is beautifully told by Alice Sevold.  <BR>The story is basically a look into the past when in 1973 a young girl is raped and murdered. It tells of her fathers drive to capture the killer and of her families effort to move forward with their life after this horrible incident.  <BR>Even if your not the whole \\"horror\\" book type, you should read this book, it's unlike any of the books you'll ever read!
0375823360|5.0|Absolutely the best story I have ever read.  Thought provoking, entertaining, endearing, and enthralling.  I'm sad that I've finished these books, but I couldn't put them down.  I laughed, I cried, and I bit my nails (unfortunately) every page of the way.  I fell in love with the characters, the story, and the settings.  I just can't say enough about this wonderful series.  Great trilogy for adults even though these books were written for young adults.  I would not recommend these books for children under 13 as they may have some difficulty following the themes.  If you haven't read these books, I envy you.  You have a whole new world to delve in to.
B00006J9OT|5.0|For all her technical skill, excellent vocals and wonderful phrasing and timing with lyrics, the one criticism that could be levelled against Diana Krall in recent times is her lack of swing. Perhaps as a result of being over-marketed as a sultry Jazz sensation, her recent albums have featured arrangements which are frankly slow at best or crawling at funeral paces for the more critical, particularly on her last album \\"The Look Of Love\\". This live album, her first, could not have come at a better time. Clearly uninhibited and given free reign the result is a wonderful jazz performance.<br />The programme on this CD is nothing startling - full of standards, ballads and bossa nova favourites but Diana Krall's vibrant contra-alto is perfectly suited for all of them. What is good is that Krall seems so comfortable with the programme, having done most of these songs on studio albums before that she able to let loose more than in a studio setting. There is a distinct sense of a little whimsy in her \\"Fly Me To The Moon\\" and a sense fun in her renditions of \\"Devil may Care\\" and \\"I Love Being Here With You\\"<br />The standard of playing on this album is excellent throughout. There is also a lot more room for improvisation on these tracks with the chance for some extended musical solos which show the technical grace and musical acumen of both Krall as well as her backing band.<br />When all is said and done, this is an excellent CD. It showcases the premiere jazz vocalist of today with superb accompaniment at her show-stopping best. Highly Recommended.

B00004T2FQ|5.0|If you can't afford the full set of Rigoletto, this is the way to go. I have about 10 versions of this opera which is one of my all time favorites. <BR>This Rigoletto is supreme. Sutherland sings up a storm, tossing of high D's and E's with extreme ease. Her trill is a marvel indeed. She is completely match with a young Pavarotti that matches Dame Joan's gorgeous voice. Pavarotti's high D is stunning.<BR>The only competition with this Rigoletto is the one with Callas.<BR>But Callas can't touch Sutherland in voice or technique. <BR>In conclusion, this is the Rigoletto to get if you only want the highlights.
1573228737|4.0|Read Tipping The Velvet, loved it so I picked up the next book and what do I find.  Geeze.  Can you say spooky.  The ending gave me interesting dreams for about a week.  But heck.  The book was good so I forgive it.  Just don't read the book in a haunted house or alone in the woods.  <br />Just warning ya.<br />Basic plot. (from memory lost book) Young woman fast on her way to becoming a loony spinster takes a volunteer job at the local women's prison (oh takes place in Britian when people still road in horse drawn buggies) and becomes fasinated by one of the women in the all star unit.  The woman claims she can talk to the dead and since spinster lady wants to talk to dead daddy she become fasinated by the girl.  Soon they are plotting the girl's escape.  <br />There's more to it but that's the basic plot.
B00008OWZC|5.0|Why oh why was I born in 1985? If only I was alive to see this great band perform live.  If anyone else has the same problem, then help has arrived.  Close your eyes and listen to these 3 CD's of pure blues-rock goodness.  Picture yourself in the front row, watching Page play so fast it looks like he is moving in The Matrix, listen to Plant sing his heart out, feel the rhythm of Jones' bass coupled with the aggressiveness of Bonzo's drums.  Put these CD's in your player and hit replay.  I'm telling you, you'll be assuring yourself that you really were there.  If you don't want to do that then just buy the DVD (which is also excellent).
B000002ADT|5.0|To add anything to what has already been written about this album is to decend into cliche. Yet add my two cents worth I must because this is the record is the one that ignited a passion for jazz that has developed since hearing its first chords. I agree that there are other jazz records that are perhaps more representative of Jazz as a musical genre, other gems that are accorded less than the legendary status that this album has attained, but Kind of Blue seems to have a profound effect on listeners of all ages and all walks of life.<br />What makes this record so brilliant? Certainly the musicians here are now all but legendary - the brilliant Miles Davis, Coltrane who went on to reshape Jazz in his own way, Bill Evans who recorded some of the finest jazz trio records in history, Cannonball Adderly, no slouch himself, and one of the finest rhythm sections in jazz music of the 60's. Yet, I believe that its true brilliance stems less from the individual talent than a synthesis of it into a collective which is truly indescribable and breath-taking.<br />People tend to be cynical when they hear a large majority enthuse so greatly about anything and admittedly I was rather sceptical about the notes at the back of the CD calling Kind of Blue &quot;the greatest jazz album&quot; and a &quot;life-changing experience&quot; but I wanted to get an idea of what jazz was about and the album was on sale at HMV so I got it. The rest they say is history or rather destiny. So, my stand is this - judge for yourself. You will do yourself no dis-service. Who knows? It might just change your life....
B00008PX8P|3.0|I thought this was a great DVD.  The only problem was that the Dolby Digital track had significant static in the center channel.  I brought it back to the store for an exchange but had the same problem.  This only happens in Dolby Digital 5.1 mode - DTS and 2.0 are fine.  I don't have this problem with my other DVD's so I know it's not my equipment.  The store manager indicated that he had not had any other returns for this item.  Has anyone else experienced this problem?  Otherwise the DVD was excellent.
0312263120|5.0|Like many, my first introduction to Dan Brown was through his absolutely SPECTACULAR thriller, 'The Da Vinci Code'.  After devouring that in half the time it normally takes to read a novel, I have found and read ALL of his books.  I must say, in a VERY short amount of time, he has become one of my absolute MUST HAVE authors.  ALL of his books are superior thrillers, and 'Digital Fortress' is his first great book.<br />What we as average, everyday citizens of the United States do NOT realize, is how much information we do NOT see--which is fine with me.  I trust my government NOT to tell me everything.  But when the NSA's Ultimate Super Computer comes across an encryption it cannot crack, suddenly the future of this ultra-secret organization is in serious jeopardy.  I think we would be shocked at what information they have access to.  However, I firmly believe that in order to keep us safe from dangers that we rarely (if ever) find out about, people who run these facilities NEED to exist.  Who KNOWS how many disasters organizations like the NSA has thwarted--and kept quiet about over the years.  However, for each and every person who believes the NSA SHOULD exist, there are just as many who believe that electronic eaves-dropping ought to be illegal, whether or not it ultimately makes American citizens more safe.  This is the major dilemma facing the Deputy Director of the NSA.  He has always been one of the biggest Patriots our government has ever seen, and is looking to make amends on a particular public fiasco which, although has ended, can never be forgotten.<br />TRANSLATR is THE Super Computer of Super Computers.  Able to decipher virtually ANY and ALL encrypted electronic messages.  But when one of the NSA's brightest is called in to assist the Deputy Director on a program that TRANSLATR seems incapable of cracking, the rubber hits the pavement, so-to-speak.  At first this seems absolutely IMPOSSIBLE.  But as it turns from impossible to probable and then finally to possible, the weight of what is happening suddenly becomes the biggest nightmare anyone in American Cryptology has ever experienced.  A code which is soon to be GIVEN away on the Internet--a code which is 100% UNBREAKABLE.  The conspiracy has been set, and the NSA's very life is at stake--among other things.  Immediately an unlikely College Professor is dispatched to Europe to attempt to acquire the Pass Code which will keep 'Digital Fortress' from becoming available to the free world.  While at the same time unsuspecting NSA employee's find themselves caught up inside a world-class conspiracy that the NSA Director apparently knows about, and is willing to let happen--all in the name of secrecy.  Dan Brown has built a truly fantastic tale of intrigue that rivals the techno-thrillers by Clancy, Cussler or anyone else for that matter.  What WOULD happen if a code such as 'Digital Fortress' becomes available to everyone connected to the Internet?  How could our top code-breakers help continue to ensure our safety if such an event actually happened?  TRUST me, this IS a frightening scenario.  Also, the phrase, 'DON'T trust ANYONE' applies to this story.  What you THINK is happening isn't necessarily what IS happening.  Just read it and you'll understand.  If there are any technical problems with what Dan Brown has written and actual computer software, well NOT being a computer expert myself, it all seemed pretty real to me.  I guess if I WERE an expert I might catch something somewhere, but for me, it all seemed very real in the way it was portrayed.  HIGHLY recommended, as is ALL of Dan Brown's fabulous novels.lly to possible, the weight of what is happening suddenly becomes the biggest nightmare anyone in American Cryptology has ever experienced.

B00008LDPU|4.0|FINAL FLIGHT OF THE OSIRIS <br />This computer generated prequel to the Matrix Reloaded, produced entirely in CGI, is the most technically advanced piece in this collection. There are moments when I forgot that I was watching virtual actors. The passion between the two main characters is intense, in a way that I thought computer images would never be able to imitate. An excellent short (not my favorite) but because of its intimate ties to the Matrix Reloaded, both in terms of story and style, seems out of place. It would have served better as the beginning of the second film.<br />THE SECOND RENAISSANCE PARTS I & II<br />Simply put, these pieces are the most powerful and provocative in the entire collection, filled with graphic and horrifying images. In a fascinating look at the prehistory of the Matrix films, humanity, not the machines, are the guilty party, enslaving an entire race of sentient life with no mercy. (As Gods, humans created machines in their image, so the slavers become the enslaved.) These shorts actually change the meaning of the overall film- very powerful.<br />KID'S STORY<br />A somewhat ho-hum story with some nice visuals and a cool ending that helps flesh out a small part of the second movie (don't want to give any spoilers) this segment is kind of pedestrian otherwise, with the skateboard tricks seeming to be the type of thing that would be cool in a 1980's comedy flick.<br />PROGRAM<br />Some interesting visuals help spice up a rather bland storyline in this short. Seems to be a remake of the fight seens between Morpheus and Neo in the first film. The story brings up the difficulty in accepting the bleak reality instead of the less bleak dreamworld, but never goes anywhere with the question.<br />WORLD RECORD<br />Perhaps the least visually appealing, with overly stylized runners going slo-mo for most of the short. If jiggly muscles are your thing, this is the short for you. No story substance in this one- very dull to watch. Also, whazzup with the agents?<br />BEYOND<br />A very beautiful piece, BEYOND is perhaps at heart the most simple story in the collection, with the focus on the perceptions of a young girl and some children in the face of mysteries they can never understand. Very engrossing.<br />A DETECTIVE STORY<br />A cool, stylish direction can not give this story the life it needed to fully flesh out. While it is the only one in the collection that focuses on the life of one of the major players in the film series (Trinity, with the voice done by the original actress, no less) the main character of the short is cardboard. Very disappointing.<br />MATRICULATED<br />The most bizarre and surreal of the bunch- this one took two viewings for me to understand its meaning, and still many of the images seem random, or bizarre for weirdness sake. The concept of pulling a machine into a human generated world and manipulating their perceptions is intriguing, but in the end we are left with many random but beautiful images that distract more than anything else.

B00008LDPU|3.0|the Animatrix has some of the best animation I have ever seen. I consists of nine different short films related to the matrix in some way. I thought this would have a lot of facts about the story behind the movies, but most of the short films talk about wierd things that are vaguely related to the movies. Besides, some of the have a really bad story inside them, which often ruins the amazing animation of the animatrix.<BR>For example, \\"World record\\" and \\"beyond\\" wont appeal to almost no one because the story is stupid and boring. In fact, there were only 5 stories that I somewhat liked. This were \\"the final flight of the osiris\\", which is the story of what happened before the movie, \\"the matrix reloaded\\" and the game, \\"Enter the Matrix\\". I also liked \\"The second renaissance part 1&2, which tells about the rise of A.I., the war between machines and humans, and the creation of the matrix. \\"A detective story\\", that tells a story about trinity and a detective, and \\"Kids story\\", a story about a kid rescued out of the matrix by Neo, Are also good ones.<BR>Overall, I give the Animatrix three stars because I loved some of the animation, But I think the stories were pretty bad<BR>I recommend a rent but I woudnt tell you to buy it unless you like the matrix and you are a fanatic of anime
B000002H33|5.0|Back in the day, I used to own all of Metallica's albums. Now, I have eliminated all of their albums, except for their first three. To me, this represents the REAL Metallica. This was back when they were a genre defining band. I believe that even though this was their major label debut, they still maintained a non-mainstream status. MTV, radio, and the media in general didn't even think of touching their music. This album elevated Thrash to a whole new level, being progressive and powerful at the same time. The lyrics are intelligent without sounding pompous. The drumming is fairly good (although it's not all it's cracked up to be). The solos aren't jaw dropping, but they still deliver. Cliff Burton is excellent as always. Thank god Cliff didn't see what was to become of Metallica after his death. After this album they became Selloutica, and then later they became Alternica. This is back when Metallica didn't care what people thought. They were doing there own thing. This is a milestone in Thrash and always will be.

B00005B36H|5.0|I'm a big fan of Tool, but I don't think they have ever sounded better then they do on La te ra lus. After listening to this cd for like the hundreth time, I realized Tool is now my favorite group, even better then Nirvana (that's something I never though I would think). I think every member of Tool is a true professional and it [stinks] that most bands don't even come close to sounding as good as Tool does on this album. But that's not Tool's fault. <br />My favorite tracks on this album are #1 (the grudge), #3 (the patient) , #8 (ticks and leaches) and #11 (reflection) . I especially like the last two minutes of reflection.<br />I don't see how anyone who likes rock n roll can not like Tool. You would do yourself a great service by picking this up. But don't be surprised if it stays put in your cd tray and all your other cds start collecting dust.
B00008OWZC|5.0|A must have for the Zep fan!  Incredible look at the band as it improved like a fine wine!  A blast from the past that is still fresher than any of today's music.<BR>ENJOY!<BR>P.S the DVD is excellent!
B00004SC3M|5.0|I thought this movie was really good. I know alot of people are whining about the age difference between Catherine Zeta Jones &amp; Sean Connery but as another reviewer said there are alot of other movies that are the same way! So people just get over it! Alot of people said it had a bad ending, but it had a VERY good ending compared to what i thought was going to happen! I also thought that their chemistry was very odvious. The plot is also very clever &amp; it keeps ur eyes glued to the screen! The DVD is really cool. There are tons of SpEcIaL FeAtUrEs that i really enjoy. SO i suggest that you buy this!
B00005JM03|4.0|Several of the early Amazon reviews adequately describe this film (as does Stephen Holden's surprisingly favorable review in the...New York Times).....Thus, this review will not comment in detail on the plot or the cast, but instead will try to furnish some additional observations and some insights about the nature of this movie. This is a caper film for moviegoers who like action including the usual chase scenes (including speedboats through the Venice canals) combined with sophisticated technology and the usual quota of misdirection and complications to be overcome.  It actually opens with the initial heist of $35 million of gold bullion; the main elements involve the falling out of the conspirators and the plans for revenge and reclamation of the bullion after its subsequent theft.<br />There is very little character development except for three of the conspirators. Donald Sutherland has a crucial but much too brief role for one of my favorite actors as John Bridger, an aging pro who is handing on his expertise to his young protege Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg). Edward Norton is almost perfect as the shallow Steve Frezelli, the member of the group who is in it solely for the money and is unfazed by any code of honor among thieves. (Almost like a reprise of his character in THE SCORE.)  In a great twist, he defines himself by his posseessions but can't even come up with anything original to purchase with the loot. Last, Seth Green is greaty as Lyle the techno-geek whose expertise is crucial to the robberies and who wants to be known as The Napster, since he claims that the Napster technology was stolen from him by his college roommate while he was taking a nap. The rest of the characters are quite well cast but pretty unidimensional, and the romantic elements are almost nonexistent but fortunately are not central to the story. A nice twist was the similarities in the methodology employed in the two major heists, and the use of technology was actually quite clever. <br />My wife and I both enjoyed this movie more than we expected that we would, there are enough plots twists and misdirection to keep it enjoyable and as well as a reasonable amount of tension on occasion. We also thought that the use of the mini Coopers as in the original version with Michael Caine was both a nice touch and worked great both as a plot device and in the theft and chase finale. The one caveat that I would like to emphasize is the limited amount of character development. Thus, it is more like OCEANS ELEVEN in this respect, and less like the recently released THE GOOD THIEF. In this regard, it also stands in sharp contrast to three of my favorite films of this genre, THE SCORE with the wonderful roles and interaction of Brando and DeNiro (along with Angela Bassett's brief appearance) and both the original THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR (Steve McQueen And Faye Dunaway) and the remake with Pierce Brosnan and Renee Russo, which in all instances incorporated a great plot based on a heist but were about the characters and their goals, self images and relationships combined with an important romantic overlay. Thus, while this was a fun flick that will be enjoyable for an occasional viewing, it only deserves four stars in my opinion. Those three are all five star classics that should never grow stale.
B00007KWHN|5.0|I purchased this CD, my first Yes album ever, a few days back and was surprised by how much I liked it. The band turns in a perfect mix of pop melody and driving prog rock. &quot;Starship Trooper,&quot; no matter what people say, has an excellent bass sound and great stop-and-start ensemble playing, and &quot;I've Seen All Good People&quot; is a terrific epic, despite being overplayed on FM radio. Chris Squire, like Geddy Lee and the late John Entwistle, plays the bass as if a lead instrument, diving in between's Steve Howe's guitar patterns and Bill Bruford's jazzy drumming. Howe's guitar prowess comes to light on his brilliant, hillbilly-like instrumental &quot;The Clap.&quot; Yes, there are some silly lyrics here and there on the CD, but even the grandest of all rock bands, The Beatles, turned out a few silly lyrics here and there (I Am The Walrus, Why Don't We Do It In The Road). Jon Anderson's soaring vocals might be an acquired taste, but I don't find them any more annoying than other first-tenor and alto-range singers. And I would definitely take Anderson's vocal phrasing over the shouting metal rappers of today. &quot;The Yes Album&quot; is a really good record, for musicians, for people who don't play an instrument but have fine taste in music, and for anyone else wishing to uncover what Yes was - and still is - all about.
0452282152|2.0|I loved the historical aspects of the book, and the descriptions of everyday<BR>life. The characters were well fleshed out. However, I felt they were passionless, lacking in wit, kindness, and character. No one in the book has a sense of humor, most of the characters are surly, and they all tip toe around each others' emotions. Also, I did not care for the sexist treatment of the main character, and her acceptance of this as what she deserved. In all, the book left me as warm as a Dutch sky in January.
B0000025GW|4.0|... I don't think it's really up to the level of some of his other albums (if you want to get Dylan's absolute best work, in my opinion you should start off with Bringing It All Back Home, Blood On The Tracks, and/or Love And Theft, but that's just my opinion), but, that said, it's a heck of a lot better than most things released in 1979, and it's on a completely different plane of existence from the much of the puerile, soulless treacle labeled \\"Contemporary Christian Music,\\" which is basically the same garbage on your average pop or generic alt-rock radio station with slightly altered lyrics. I'm more acquainted with that genre than most people of my religious background, since I share an office with someone who is rather intensely involved in an evangelical free church. One day, after hearing Audio Adrenaline one too many times, I played this album and a Blind Lemon Jefferson collection for him. He was hooked immediately, and I haven't heard any more Audio Adrenaline in several months since.<br />One interesting thing this album has made think about is this: the reason why certain subsets of both secular liberals and conservative Christians can each hold an artist like Bob Dylan in equally high esteem is probably because we have more in common than either would generally like to consider. Think about it: if you're sitting here, tooling through reviews of some of Bob Dylan's lesser-known albums, chances are you (1) have a sneaking suspicion that there's more to life than making as much money and acquiring as much material [items] as possible, and (2) that our culture in particular pursues and values those things far too much, no matter what your religious or political orientations may be... Toodles!
B00008R9KF|5.0|I have been griping for over a year about \\"the powers that be\\" putting this incredible classic on DVD, and finally here it is -the British dramedy \\"My Beautiful Laundrette\\" is more than just a love story where the love is between two men; this film will make you laugh, make your eyes well with tears, and make you angry as it explores the working classes of England, as well as the racial tensions that exist between white and Pakistani people there.  It's touching, funny, romantic, charming, and full of heart.  Most of all, it's very real; many people today may freak at the sight of a young, punkish Daniel Day Lewis passionately (and I mean PASSIONATELY) kissing/making love with another man (the beautiful Gordon Warnecke), but if you can get past that, you nearly forget you are watching a movie - the characters are that real, your ability to care for them that real.<br />For gay or gay-friendly folks who want to see a good, simple, character-driven kind of filmmaking, with no special effects or explosions or heavy prosthetic makeup to compensate for the lack of script, \\"My Beautiful Laundrette\\" is true art not to be missed.
B000007NYS|5.0|This disc is a terrific classic. Filled with hymns to the intoxicated run of loving and living, with tears on the road, and sometime a pause as pure as a dawn, the sigh of an opening rose (\\"Like A Rose\\"). The fact is Lucinda doesn't only write great songs: she incarnates, marries them so perfectly that you even cannot believe your ears: her voice with a violin is something so fine and graceful that it soars from the Earth to the outer space (\\"Side Of The Road\\"). <BR>\\"I'm only thirsty for a liquor unkown on the Earth\\", wrote the French poet Charles Baudelaire. Too bad he couldn't listen to Lucinda Williams.
B000002U9K|5.0|I think the reason I like this album so much is because the first time I ever had cable with MTV, I turned it on and saw the video for &quot;West End Girls&quot; playing, and the scene there has never left my head.  Strange, I thought because there were no girls in the video! But there was something about the music that hooked me, and I read someone once called the music &quot;haunting,&quot; and in many ways it is.<br />The music is very electronic and the lead singer Neil Tennant is probably not what you would think of as being a great singer.  However, his voice works with the lyrics, and those lyrics really make you think.  They stay with you.<br />My favorite songs on this album in addition to &quot;West End Girls&quot; would be &quot;Love Comes Quickly&quot; and &quot;Suburbia&quot;.  I also like the very simple &quot;Later Tonight&quot;, which I learned to play on the piano (but I am not a good musician by any stretch).  The Pet Shop Boys never really made it big in America past the mid-80s and it seems after their follow-up album ACTUALLY they practically disappeared from MTV and the radio waves.  But fans like me still buy their albums.<br />But their musical story starts here, and it is a worthwhile album to have.
B00008J4P5|5.0|OK, I didn't want to like The White Stripes--I figured it was hype (I'm begining to hate that word) and that they couldn't possibly be as great as everyone was raving.  I thought, \\"The White Stripes?  It's just folksy weirdo arty rock, I mean come on . . .\\"  But then I went into a CD strore where you could listen to the whole thing.  All right, I said, let's do this, let's get it over with.  Headphones on.  Track one, '7 nation army,' heard it--skip.  Number two: full-blown all-out rock song... What the--that guitar is insane.  This is like punk-blues,  ah! my favorites!...  Number three:  Jack White choir?  That is so awesome what the f--<br />[Dang].  I have to buy this now.  Noooooooooo!<br />Now you liten to me, Jack White can play guitar.  I didn't know he could play like that.  I don't really care if people can play guitar or not (most guitarists are show offs, SHOW OFFS, annoying) but Jack is crazy.  He's crazy.  And I love the blues, but they can get boring, which is why I love Jimi Hendrix; he took the blues and freaked them out, made them awesome.  Guess what.  So does Jack White.  He takes the blues and FREAKS THEM OUT, and it's great.  But that's not what makes the white stripes great; it helps, but it's just part.<br />This is for all of you who aren't into the W.S.s yet.  You can start here, it's OK.  Sounds too good to be true?  Quit being a snob and just listen to this already.<br />Also, buy the Von Bondies record, 'Lack of Communication.'  Jack produced it and they're cool.
B00008PX8P|5.0|First of all I have to admit that I had been al little disappointed when I knew the   material that was going to be included in this DVD release because I also expected some good quality (professional) rare film from the 1977 US tour which exist on the bootleg market. I also expected to have a good performance of No Quarter such as the one in Los Angeles in 1977 or even the Knebwoth's version. <br />But I truly have to apologize about all that. This DVD is definitely one of the best Audio/Video products I have purchased in years, the high audio and video quality (considering the years) contained in this DVD revels the enormous effort put by Jimmy Page and his collaborators to compete a project with no precedent. Even the short films contained in the menus give this material a really collectors touch.<br />I have been a Zep fan since 1976, and I started my video collection since 1990 which has been a very, very, very difficult hunting. I am not an english native speaker and is difficult for me to describe what I would like to write, but I will conclude  saying that  I am one of the millions of fans that waited too long to see this material officially released. Thank you Led Zeppelin and all those involved in this project for the happiness you have given us releasing this piece of the history of rock.
0684833395|4.0|When I first read the title of this book, it brought to mind all the wonderful comments I had heard about it. I knew I had to see what all the fuss was about. I was a bit intrigued after the first chapter, but I wasn't quite sure it was worth all the hype. As the book went on, I began to dislike it more and more, loving it all the same. It drove me nuts with every turn of a page. I was immediately thrown off by the absurd conversations depicted. I didn't understand how you could only go see someone in their office when they weren't there. But, I quickly warmed up to the idea that the book was just not going to make sense. The whole concept behind Catch-22 is that there is no logic; you have to find a way to use the illogical ways of the system to your advantage. Though I complained throughout most of my reading, I can say that I definitely enjoyed the book. It's one of those that will mess with your head; you just can't let it get to you. However, if you are planning on reading it, I would make one suggestion: make a list of characters and short descriptions as you read, or print a list from the internet. There are about 38 characters, not including some minor ones. If you do not find some way to keep them straight, you will find yourself flipping back pages all the time to remember who someone is.
B00008VGL6|1.0|Yes, I'm Depeche Mode fan and a fan who wasn't excited about the last CD \\"Exciter\\". I have seen many Depeche Mode concerts and this CD did need a human drummer. This CD is exactly what I anticipated because the 80's Counterfeit EP was lame.<BR>What's ever going on with DM is an enigma. Speaking of which, seems like the recording band Enigma, Brian Eno, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, This Mortal Coil, Dead Can Dance et al have casted a heavy gloom of influence on this CD as well as Dave Gahan's solo CD project \\"Paper Monsters\\" --released June 3, 2003...more about this later--there's just no energy on Martin's project; as if, his attempt to texture a fusion of Kraftwerk and Brian Eno. Not all is lost. Front 242 has a new CD called \\"Pulse\\" available here at Amazon.com. <BR>My reccomendation is keep the single of \\"Stardust\\" which is still a wierd re-mix but the re-mix of \\"I Cast A Lone Some Shadow\\" is the best track on the single. The re-mix master made the tune tremendously better which takes on sonic influence of a Mute Recording Band called: I Start Counting... now called Fortran 5.<BR>Optimistically, after the 80's EP, Martin seemed refreshed and composed some excellent tunes. Anything is possible.
0385507755|5.0|First of all, I have to thank James Frey for sharing this book with us.  His is a story the likes of which I have never read.  It is a comprehensive, heart wrenching, brutally honest account of substance abuse, addiction, self loathing and ultimately redemption. This book should be read by anyone whose life has been touched by any type of addiction.  The writing is fantastic, James's uncoquerable spirit is present in every poetic line. I cannot believe he survived some of the things that are described in this book. Many times as I was reading, I had to put the book aside for a moment because it was all too much to take in at one time. Now imagine living like that.  The best thing I can say about this book is even if the reader is the most cynical of people, he or she will come away having learned something.  I know I did and I won't forget this story for a long, long time.  Mr. Frey has such a unique voice and I look forward to anything else he writes.
0060926317|4.0|The book Mutant Message was very educational in the values and beliefs of realism. This book was not only interesting, it also gave the reader a new outlook on life and other cultures. It was an easy read filled with adventure and compassion. We recommend this book to mature adults (high school senior level). This book deals with real life contreversial issues. We rated it a four star!
0812550706|5.0|Card did an excellent job on this book.  The reader can really identify and apithize with Ender.  This book is extremely well written and keeps you wanting more.  After reading this book you will be drawn to go out and pick up Speaker of the Dead, the second book in the series.  Highly recommended
0671027344|5.0|This is one of the best books i have ever read! This book was great for me because as most teenagers that have family problems and problems with sexuality, this book shares it all! Mostly because this book reminds me alot of myself! I tried the whold drug and suicide route! And the best thing about this book is the poem, there is a poem about this kid who kills him self and it was like the saddest thing i have ever read! If you have a heart you will love this book! I give it 100 stars
B00008LDPU|3.0|While the animation styles are varied and great if story drives your purchases I would wait until this is boxed with the Matrix set as I assume it will be.<br />It is a classic example of form over substance as the animation is varied and excellent but the stories are universally weak. <br />I was surprised in these shorts how many existing visual images were used. The dearth of original imagery is disturbing and makes me wonder and worry about what has been burned into our visual minds.<br />A definite rental but I wouldn't purchase it if you are not into animation. It really does not further the Matrix world at all.
0743216458|5.0|In Band of Brothers, Stephen Ambrose shows a remarkable ability to suck the reader right into the story.  He does a wonderful job of letting the reader get to know the soldiers on a personal level.....to the point that if the reader were to actually meet one of these soldiers, he would instantly feel like he has known him for years.  The best thing about this book is the fact that it presents war from a personal view, rather than the typical cold, sterile, narrative format of most other history books.  Reading this book will bring back memories for many people, and for others, make them wish they had such memories and bonds.
0812550757|5.0|This is the second book in the speaker trilogy.  The first being Ender's Game and the third being Xenocide.  Although this story is pretty self contained, reading Ender's Game first will make the story more enjoyable.  This book is completely different from Ender's Game though.  A completely different story that Ender finds himself involved in.  Highly suggested reading.
B00005JLH3|4.0|Is \\"Drumline\\" formulaic? Yes.  Has its elements been shown before in movies?  Probably.  But it still succeeds, by the subtle and utterly believable performance given by Orlando Jones as a band teacher trying to stick to his principals and by shining a light on the no-nosense world of upper-level band programs.  Even in high school, it wouldn't be that absurd to think that the band works harder and trains more intensely than the athletes that they are there to support.  It is expected that you have every little detail down, every note crisply played, and every move memorized.  Into this world comes a cocky street drummer named Devon Miles (Nick Cannon in an auspicious screen debut) who thinks he can waltz through the band program.  However, that makes him butt heads with his line captain Sean (Leonard Roberts), which leads to dismay for their teacher, Dr. Lee (Jones).  Even through that turmoil, Miles still manages to pick up a girl, an uppercassman named Laila (Zoe Saldana) and prepare for a showdown with a rival band school in the movie's flashy and exuberant finale.<br />Director Charles Stone lll is as auspicious as Cannon in his directorial debut.  He pays enough attention to character to help the film move along, but his real strength lies in his staging of the energetic marching routines pulled off by dozens of actors and extras carrying various instruments and wearing colorful uniforms.  They are an absolute delight to watch, and Stone makes it all look easy.  And even Cannon and Roberts get in the act with their snare drums, showing off snappy solos and amazing routines.<br />Is the movie formulaic, and done before?  Probably so.  But it still succeeds  by paying enough attention to character and definitly by staging those marching routines.  Plus, Orlando Jones gives the film a little more depth with a surprisingly believable and subtle performance.  \\"Drumline\\" has enough spice, spark, and soul to impress even the most jaded moviegoer.
B000096I9G|5.0|The Cure - Trilogy is something I've been waiting for ever since news on it surfaced late last year.  I am not musically inclined at all and to think that a band could perform three entire CDs, with all the nuances of their instruments, is unbelievable.  But this is The Cure and they have made one of the greatest DVDs that you should own.  <br />After popping in Disc 1, the atmosphere sort of mingles itself into your living room (or where ever).  After clicking to Play Set (because I guarantee you will not skip anything anytime you watch this), the opening chords start as an initiation, and the opening drums to \\"100 Years\\" starts.  I _hated_ the original recording of the Pornography album, however I loved the songs anytime I heard them live.  This is no different.  Everything is amazing, and the drums on \\"The Hanging Garden\\", \\"The Figurehead\\", and \\"Pornography\\" really drive this first set.  The song \\"Cold\\" is probably the most depressing moment of this entire DVD.<br />After this, Smith and Company walk offstage, saying they will be back in \\"7 years\\" (the time between Pornography and Disintegration).  The haunting angelic chimes to Plainsong start afterwards, and the lightshow starts to become absolutely fantastic to watch, it truly complements this show well.  Highlights include \\"Lullaby\\", \\"Fascination Street\\", and of course, my favorite song off of Disintegration, the title track.  \\"Untitled\\" is breathtaking.<br />Immediately pop in Disc 2 to see Bloodflowers.  This is where all the band truly shines.  \\"Where the Birds Always Sing\\" is an extraordinary performance, as well as \\"There Is No If...\\".  Words cannot describe this set.  It comes to a close with \\"Bloodflowers\\", and the encore of \\"The Kiss\\" BLEW ME AWAY.  It is also one of my top 3 favorite Cure songs, so that was a true treat.<br />There is an interview and some bonus stuff, but that is simply incidental considering how great the entire concert is.  I only wish I could have seen it live, but this DVD really does make you feel as if you were there.  *claps*.  5 Stars.
B00005O3VC|5.0|I don't think I have ever laughed harder than I did the first time I saw MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL in a movie theater in Dallas, Texas while visiting my best friend in college Becky. I laughed so hard that I nearly hyperventilated, and I felt something like stabbing pain in my ribcage, so that the rest of the evening I had to grasp my chest with my arms to keep from hurting myself. I laughed and laughed and laughed, and then the opening credits ended and the film began.<br />As funny as the opening credits are, the film matches them. The skits are just off the chart absurd, and all the better for it. The film has penetrated popular imagination to such an extent that people aren't even aware sometimes of the origins of some of the things they hear. For instance, I played an online MMRPG (massively multiplayer role playing game), and in that game there were numerous players who played mages with some permutations of Tim, another named Brave Sir Robin, and one quest in the game was to get a gang of people to kill a tiny white rabbit that was capable of killing dozens of those attacking it. One group of players formed a monarchy called The Knights Who Say Ni. Outside that game, merely mentioning the words \\"African swallow\\" can evoke laughter in some quarters.<br />Even today, this movie remains one of the most original, intelligent comedies ever made. The entire conceit of making a comedy about King Arthur and the search for the Holy Grail is a bizarre one, but the Python boys pull it off with style. The skits (for there really is not a plot so much as a general framework for hanging great skits on) are extraordinarily intelligent, unusual, and, best of all, hysterically funny. To this day, except for other Monty Python films, there has been no humor along the lines in this film in either England or the United States, and that's a pity. This isn't easy humor to reproduce. It takes a certain amount education, a certain level of literacy, a certain level of intelligence, and very definitely a level of comic genius. What is brilliant is that the humor can move from highly cerebral political satire (the peasants who refuse to acknowledge Arthur as their king merely because he had been chosen by \\"a watery tart\\" who gave him Excalibur) to the delightfully absurd (the syllogisms by which a knight proves that a witch and a duck weigh the same, and then placing a duck on one side of a scale and the witch on the other, incredibly proving that she was indeed a witch) to the out and out farcical (the Black Knight).<br />The DVD set is spectacular, with a host of the kinds of features DVD lovers crave. I had previously owned the movie on VHS, but the DVD has a vastly clearer print with more vivid colors.gence, and very definitely a level of comic genius.

B00005JKPF|5.0|This movie was totally awesome. I think every Marvel fan should see this movie! Every actor and actress in this movie from the first movie or not was great. My favorite character in this movie was, of course, Wolverine and Deathstrike. Wolverine or Logan (Played by Hugh Jackman) was an awesome character and portrayed his character well. Next is Deathstrike, or Yuriko Oyama (played by Kelly Hu). She is SO AWESOME! This movie is jamp packed with action and drama! That is just perfect! Every person in the WORLD should see this, because I know they will enjoy it. Everyone in this movie is totally awesome:<BR>Jean Grey (Famke Jannsen)<BR>Rogue (Anna Paquin)<BR>Storm (Halle Berry)<BR>Cyclops <BR>Mystique (Rebecca Romijn Stamos)<BR>Magneto <BR>Professor X<BR>Pyro<BR>and Bobby Drake, or Iceman, are in this movie. And, to finish off this review: NIGHTCRAWLER (played by Alan Cumming). He was totally cool! He had an awesome role and a cool costume! He was my favorite character besides Logan and Deathstrike. Whether your age is 9 to 99 you'll defnitely enjoy this movie.
B00000DHRZ|2.0|Not half as bad as Conspiracy of One, but still a major blow factor behind this one. When I first bought it, I was into the whole Blink 182 thing going on. But now, I listen to REAL PUNK MUSIC and I really...hate this failure. Suprisingly it's from a band who I usually like the music by. However, this goes into a sissy, crummy, boring...posuer record with the least thought out lyrics ever. What really kills it is the ultimatly cheesy, radio-friendly \\"Pretty Fly (for a white guy)\\" which is a shocker compared to their earlier accomplishments. It's probably the worst album I ever bought and actually liked at one point in my life....
038533348X|5.0|Why do people write reviews that are 5 paragraphs long? I dont get it....Anyway, this is a wonderful book. A quick read and suspensful all the way up to the last sentence. Very enjoyable.
0780021150|4.0|Let me start off by talking about the transfer. For a Criterion edition (and the pricetag attached to the Criterion name) the transfer is really quite lacking. The negative is rather scratched and there is that rather unfortunate presence of the white bar in the latter stages of the film. I understand that they were dealing with compromised film stock, but I refuse to believe that they were unable to restore the film to a greater extent. <br />Criterion compounds this problem with their notable lack of extras. No commentary or audio essay, no production notes, no publicity stills, no biographies or anything else. A poor effort from Criterion.<br />On the other hand, the film is presented in the original 1.17:1 format, and not at 1.33:1 as another reviewer has stated. Criterion confuses this by stating that it is presented at a 1.33:1 aspect ratio, but in reality there are black bars at the sides of the screen. I suppose that this is nominally a 4:3 aspect ratio (as opposed to 16:9 enhanced) with reverse letterboxing being applied, if that makes any sense.<br />As for the film itself, I was quite impressed with it. It is a movie which is as relevant today as it was in the days it was made, a movie where the string of crimes would terrorize as many people today as it did then, and a criminal whom we are as unsure how to treat as they were then.  In this respect we may regard M as being vastly superior to current fare, as it actually raises the sticky questions of responsibility versus compulsion instead of emptily condemning that which cannot be condoned. <br />Sure, it may strike us as being unrealistic that the police and the underworld are both trying to capture the same man (and for the same reason), but it's a conceit we are willing to believe in \\"Silence of the Lambs,\\" not to mention \\"Cradle 2 the Grave,\\" which was a straight up M remake.<br />One of the surprising elements of the film is how well it uses sound, considering that it is Fritz Lang's initial forayinto the medium. In this sense it is an innovative work (like citizen Kane), as Lang has integrated sound in a way few directors today manage to do. We actually hear the murderer whistling before we see him, and you'll never listen to that little Grieg tune the same way ever again. It's interesting to observe the way sound is used at other stages of the film, as in some points there is no sound whatsoever, to the extent you might even start checking to see if there is something wrong with your speakers or DVD player. I don't know if it was the novelty of sound or what, but it seems like a lot of early directors were much more innovative in their use of sound (think of Eisenstein in Alexander Nevsky) and took advantage of it in ways modern directors don't think of.  Sure, there are directors to whom sound is obviously important and who use it well (David Lynch and Wong Kar-Wai are a couple), but for most it seems like something of an afterthought.<BR>At any rate I feel that this film holds up quite well, certainly more than other vintage films like Grand Illusion or Citizen Kane. The plot is largely as relevant today as it was when it was made (though thankfully we do not appreciate the commentary it offers on the nascent Nazi party or fascism) and the commentary on human nature is as true as ever. It is not best appreciated solely as a historic document or technical yardstick (which is how I regard the highly lauded Citizen Kane) but as a commentary on humanity and, above all, entertainment.<br />I was actually familiar with Peter Lorre before watching this movie, mostly from his extensive appearances on radio programs. That being said, I must say I found his performance rather tiresome, as he uses the same histrionics and tics (only this time they are in German, and not in the English I was used to hearing). Of course this isn't really fair to him, as he was no doubt being type-cast in his later American works, having made much of his reputation with this film. Ifyou aren't familiar with his other work then you may find his performance really quite fine.
B000002KIE|5.0|What true punk fan doesn't know or own this album. If you don't, and you say you're a punk fan, throw away your....Good...Charollote album and buy this monster. Vulgar, Nihilistic, Misunderstood, Underrated, but still great. The Sex Pistols were one of the most influental punk bands of all time, even though they defy the people who call it \\"punk\\". <br />The album features the well-known classics \\"God Save the Queen\\" and \\"Anarchy in the UK\\", but those are minors compared to the other tracks on the album. Don't get what I mean, check out \\"Pretty Vacant\\", \\"Problems\\", \\"Bodies\\", and \\"EMI\\" to figure it out (posuer)! <br />The album was recorded with original bassist Glen Matlock, before they hired the infamous and untalented Sid Vicious (famous for being dead and killing his girlfriend). Johnny Rotten's vocals give you an even more chilling fall into the band's music. <br />These guy's musical influences are very easily heard in bands like Dead Kennedys, Black Flag, Rancid and many others, but they also had influence on tons of metal bands, too. The controvery behind the album also may attract people, but make them forget about the true masterwork of the music.
B000001GQP|4.0|If one sticks to rigid traditions about what a soprano should or should not sound like at various vocal ranges, then yes, the Dulcissime sounds very different from what it is &quot;supposed to.&quot;  However, I think that the soprano is clearly making a choice about how to sing this brief segment.  Of course she could sing it &quot;correctly&quot; if she wanted to, but I think the soprano is taking a big risk by singing outside the box.  If you are willing to remove yourself from what convention tells you is beautiful, I think you will find the Dulcissime an extremely powerful, sweeping, breathtaking experience.  Music history is replete with people stepping outside of convention to meet with serious public censure.  Let's not forget the intial public reaction to Stravnski's Rite of Spring.  I think the soprano is a ground breaker, and posterity might just show again that perhaps we're all being a bit too stuffy and constricted in our judgments.
B000006045|5.0|When first released, Mezzanine was hailed as the future sound of pop music. This is the third full album release from Massive Attack (the group credited with inventing the triphop genre), and plunges the listener into a dark melodic world where man meets machine. Three guest vocalists (Sara Jay, Horace Andy, and Elizabeth Fraser of Cocteau Twins) carry the different moods of the album. It's difficult to pigeonhole the album, as it blends unique sounds from so many genres. Certainly the most abrasive album I've heard in Trip Hop country, it is nevertheless aclose thing to a flawless gem in the domain of electronic music.
B000083LQB|5.0|This reissue of the classic alterna-rock album from one of the genre's best bands is hands down one of the best cd releases of 2003. Sonic Youth is a truly inspirational band, and this is arguably their best release. It was the album that truly gave them pop notability, whatever that means. They didn't sacrifice any of their ideals or attitudes towards music, however. This is in-your-face rock music, tearing down the all too accepted male dominated ego, by making an experience for all genders. What ever happened to those ideas? It seemed that the whole alterna/grunge thing was a mere moment of what could have been a great blessing. There was a moment of solidarity amongst rock fans, and then we got stuck back with phallic morons screaming about nookie. (sigh) <br />Anyhow,this album showcases some of the most raw punk modern music has ever heard. Every song on this album is a masterpiece. I love bands that challenge what \\"good music\\" should sound like. Noise has never been so heavenely. The bonus disc is divine as well. Alot of the outtakes are epic insturmentals that are sure to be soothing to any punk fan's ears. Long live Sonic Youth! We need another musical revolution to destroy the mindless male oppressor, and to bring unity back to the masses.
B000001FI7|5.0|Elegant, stylish, and brilliant do not even begin to describe the debut album of Bristol's Portishead. Imagine an album that combined all of the best elements of songwriting, hiphop, breakbeat, cool jazz, and spy movie soundtracks and you might have an idea of what this album holds in store. Beth Gibbons' autumnal vocals flourish throughout the atmospherically lush album. As the seasons change, this is one album that remains continuously listenable.
0440418569|5.0|I can understand how Christian readers of this book might be offended at first glance by Phillip Pullman's allegorical depiction of their god and church.  However, I cannot understand the close-mindedness it would take to throw this book away without considering it or its message, to brand it as evil, or - worse yet - leave a review without even reading it!  That last seems to me to be the ultimate in hypocrisy, but that's getting off the subject.  The point is, I was shocked to see how many denunciations of it as heresy, blasphemy and sacrilege there are in these reviews.  <br />First of all, \\"The Amber Spyglass\\" is a fictional story.  For anyone unclear on the meaning of this, the author is presenting a scenario in a different world with made-up people.  It's just as ridiculous to get upset over \\"Harry Potter\\" for 'witchcraft and Satan worshipers!' ... as it is to slander this book for (gasp!) questioning a common viewpoint - namely, that Christianity is 'right' and that the monotheistic god worshiped by most Christians is just and good.  Instead of sticking to this safe recipe, the author goes further - what if that god really wasn't just or good?  What if the angels that serve this god were actually human, with human faults and frailties?  What if the entire basis for the church in Lyra's world doing awful things to people it claims to save was all just an ancient lie?  Many will dislike it because even though they may or may not be Christian, Judeo-Christian influences have played a huge part in Western social and ethical tenets for two thousand years - and this author dares to question those beliefs.  For instance, the author criticizes the Catholic doctrine of original sin and the nearly universal blind acceptance of another person's ideas most eloquently through Dr. Mary Malone, who in the allegory plays the snake who tempted Eve, or Lyra.  Both of those things caused Dr. Malone grief, and I personally was so moved by her marzipan story that I cried at how senseless her pain and confusion was.  Furthermore, he criticizes those laws and ideas of religion that do cause suffering, either directly or indirectly.  He also makes a darkly humorous pass at the hypocrisy shown by the church in Lyra's world, who preemptively absolve one of their zealots for the murder of a child - when it serves their main purpose, that of keeping their power.  So, I do believe that it definitely is a criticism of the things that the Christian church has done in their god's name - in fact, almost every abuse of the church's power described in the book has actually taken place, save the splitting of children from their daemons.   <br />What I don't believe, however, is that it's saying Christianity is bad, in and of itself - just like the way he raises the idea that no person is bad, in and of him or herself.  It's their acts that are good or evil.  In this case, it is the acts of people who never question this religion that lead to suffering, and are therefore evil.  This book demands that everyone who reads it thinks and questions and wonders, because it presents something that is very different from the regular viewpoint of this world's church.  And that's what's so wonderful and refreshing and different about it.  Besides, of course, Pullman's awesome writing.  I admit to taking a certain measure of satisfaction in the fact that even most of the people who left one-star reviews admitted that his writing was good, which points to the inference that it wasn't really the book they had problems with, just the ideas it represents. <br />So, finally, if anyone has problem with reading about ideas that may run very contrary to their own, they'd probably be better off with an author that agrees with them and reinforces their beliefs, instead of Pullman, who aims to leave them questioning.
B00008AY3L|4.0|Ben Harper, truly one of the most blessed musicians and songwriters of our time, has given us a diverse caper of an album with Diamonds on the Inside.  I've always admired the sincerity and emotional weight of Ben's music, be it on album, or be it live.  That said, this album doesn't work for me as well lyrically or dynamically as his other albums. However, this album does show off Ben &amp; the Innocent Criminals' improvisation work, which is absolutely stellar.  Still, there is no coherence from one song to another (which itself is fine, per subject matter), but the mood shift can be somewhat jolting from track to track.<br />However, this album is chock full of gems for just about everybody.  The first single, \\"With My Own Two Hands\\" is a powerful work of reggae, reminding me very strongly of Peter Tosh's Equal Rights work.  \\"When It's Good\\" has the down-south feel of classic acoustic blues.  \\"Brown Eyed Blues\\" and \\"Bring the Funk\\" are very soulful tracks.  \\"Temporary Remedy\\" recall Ben's adventurous electric outings from The Will to Live and Burn to Shine.  The album concludes with three tender pieces, with Ladysmith Black Mambazo on \\"Picture of Jesus\\".<br />The album keeps up with Ben's sincerity of musicianship and adds in (for the first time on record) the band's incredibly tight improvisation skills, but it still feels a bit schizophrenic all around.  For fans of Ben, I highly recommend you pick it up.  Like his other albums, there is plenty to enjoy here, it's just so incredibly different it may take a while to digest.
0783225970|5.0|This is probably Al pacino's best movie of all time...Al pacino plays as  Tony Montana,a bad...cuban political refugee in Miami with his partner Manny. there they kill cocaine dealers and regulate the streets of Miami. Al Pacino has his moment of fame in the movie but cocaine and all the money goes to his head. The acting is great and Michelle Phiefer plays a good role too. The dvd itself is also pretty decent its got some outakes along with the \\"making of Scarface\\" which takes you behind the scenes. This movie all together is excellent. It is out of print...but they are trying to put it back in theaters with extra scenes!! Look out for it...
B00008J2DQ|5.0|The album faceless is definitly one of the best albums from one of the baddest, hardest rocking bands around! There is a great diversity of songs. This is important because some albums from other bands sound all the same. If you like rock this is a must for your cd collection! O yeah and you gotta go to there concerts! I went to HFStival and they rocked the place with all the pyro and stuff!
0440237688|4.0|We are from a senior high school (Gymnasium) in Germany and read \\"The Giver\\" in our English lessons. We had to do mind maps, reviews, presentations and so on. All in all it was a time with a lot of work to do, but although with a lot of fun.<BR>The society we find in the book seems ideal. Everyone has a job for which he or she is suited emotionally, physically and mentally. The elderly are lovingly cared for. Every family has a mother, father, and two children, one of each sex. There is much laughter and joy. There is no rudeness, no crime and no disease.<BR>We see it all through the eyes of Jonas, a young boy about to receive his life's assignment along with others of his age group. To his surprise he is given the most respected job of all. He is to be trained to become the \\"Receiver of Memory\\". You see, in the society Lowry has created for us, the people don't want to be stressed with memories. However, they also don't want to make decisions or changes which, in the past, have led to disaster so they have assigned one person to keep all the memories of history, their own and that of all societies.<BR>The Receiver's job is to listen to their plans and just tell them whether or not they should do it based on the lessons of history. The present Receiver now sets about giving the memories- all of them - to Jonas. He does so through all of the senses. Jonas learns about war and hate, about snow and trees and colours. All of which are not present in this society. He also learns of the horror all around him. This novel is not difficult to read. <BR>I liked reading the book, it was not hard for me and I knew nearly all vocabulary. On the one hand it was not the kind of book I would read in my free time, but on the other hand I enjoyed reading it. The book showed us to keep individualism and not to build a perfect state, so the book is also transferable to our society. -Felix-<BR>I have to say that I don't like most science fiction books. It's only that I like this work although it is a science fiction and fantasy book. I liked the way Lois Lowry described the community. At first you think the community is perfect and you may want to live there, but then you see the disadvantages of this way of live that is what makes the book interesting.         -Katja-
B00008PX8P|5.0|A guidon for the greatest rock era and one of the most powerful leaders of the British Invasion in rock music, Led Zepplin taught the world about the meaning of Rock and Roll. If you are new to Zepplin this is a great place to start. If you've been with them for many years you already have this release and will not need to read this review. I have only touched the surface of this classic and I am utterly amazed. From the opening track \\"We're Gonna Grove\\" they grab you and pull you into a loud, bombastic rock groove that will not surrender. The power of Zepplin is exhilarating while the showmanship is second to none. Page's guitar work in \\"Dazed and Confused\\" will prove the range and ability of this master. Plants vocals soar with a blues rock sound that has never been duplicated in all of rock and roll. John Paul will amaze you with his chops on the bass. He matches Bonzo for a backbeat that threatens to collapse the stage. Thanks to technology and a lot of hard work the band has graciously provided us a priceless collection of some of the greatest Zep footage ever shot. Go out and get it - NOW!!
B00008H2LB|5.0|What a great album! I really don't see why Linkin Park gets so much criticism because as far as I see it, they are one of the most creative and innovative bands out there. (If anyone thinks otherwise, please pick up the awesome Reanimation, blows that theory out the water) <br />A quick breakdown of Meteora:<br />1.Foreword - not much to say except it leads very nicely and intricately into the next song. Very much Linkin Park's style.<br />2.Don't Stay - while being a great, hard song to thump along to, what struck me most about this song is Mr Hahn's brilliant work at the turntables running as an undercurrent to the rest of the music. Great stuff.<br />3.Somewhere I Belong - for the opening strands alone, this song deserves kudos. It's a really good song and showcases what Linkin Park does best; innovation but with a sense of familiarity.<br />4.Lying from You - a terrific song with special mention going to Brad on the guitars and Chester for singing so damn hard. The flow between Mike and Chester on vocals is also worthy of a mention, these two work fantastically well together.<br />5.Hit the Floor - probably the hardest song on the album, its all unforgiving beats and vocals. I quite like the bitter and vindicitve lyrics too.<br />6.Easier to Run - if this becomes a single, it'll be an instant smash. Chester shows the softer, harmonic side to his amazing voice here and blends superbly with Mike. It calms the album down a bit, after the heavy Lying from You and the ferocious Hit the Floor, this song has just the right tempo to soothe you at just the right time.<br />7.Faint - the fastest song on the album, this is pure fun Linkin Park style. It's catchy and very quick, no time-wasting with this song. <br />8.Figure.09 - this took awhile to grow on me and is probably my least favourite on the album. Having said that, it's got an a fantastic brigde that takes me back to the edginess of Hybrid Theory. <br />9.Breaking the Habit - quite possibly the best song on the album. This is Linkin Park as you've never heard them, no hard rocking, no quick-fire rapping, just great strings and Chester singing better than ever. This song shows just how diverse Linkin Park can be, these guys can go in any direction and still make music that sounds great.<br />10.From the Inside- definitely one of my favourites, this song belongs to Chester and Mike, who once again show why they're such a formidable vocal combination. The song rises and falls numerous times, combining soft verses with a harsh chorus and the result is an epic, rich and mature song.  <br />11.Session - Linkin Park can make even instrumentals sound good. Cure for the Itch was good and this is even better. <br />12.Numb - a great way to round off the album, it's catchy, it's easy on the ears and all the musical elements blend excellently together. <br />I suppose I can't find a bad thing to say about the album. Meteroa isn't Linkin Park being radically different and producing a whole new sound and why should it be? It is only their second album and they've chosen to hone, develop and mature their sound, the results which are the fabulous songs of Meteora. And I'm loving every minute of it. Bring on the third album!
0316666343|3.0|I could have put this book down at any moment of the first 100 pages.  It did pick up after that.  If you are &quot;afraid&quot; to read it because of the gore...there is none. Things are hinted but not really stated out. It is not sit on the edge of your seat exciting but it does hold your interest.  For a part of the book I had the feeling it was going to turn into a Stephen King novel but that never happened.  Kind of a let down.  My book club met on this book and the biggest discussion out of it was about heaven/hell/after life and what we believe in and why.
B000069AUI|4.0|this is a good add to any collection
B0000029GA|5.0|i must give this 5 stars... i don't want to, but i can't help myself... my hand has taken over, it can't deny the pure street poetry and lyrical genius that this album has... never has one so effortlessly catalouged the exact details of the projects or any hood or ghetto without revelling in endless violance and mocking of women/...<BR>I must also give this 5 stars to prevent it from being dragged down to the DREADED \\"3 and half STAR\\" RATING, that pathetic cliche inbreds like Nelly and his ilk possess with kids going \\"greatest rapper ever\\"... HA... the fact that they call them rappers obviously means they have no clue about hip hop... <BR>lyricists and thug poets 4eva...<br />peace...
B00008H2LB|5.0|awesome cd worth buying. support lp and buy it quality over quanitity everyone.
B000009RC2|5.0|This is one of the best CD's I own, simply because the music is nothing but exceptional. Every single musician is extremely proficient at their instrument, especially John McLaughlin, whose guitar skills are light-years ahead of anyone's. There are no lyrics; none are needed. The music tells the whole story. It is powerful, moving, uplifting (as in the chord progressions tend to ascend more than descend... which produces a really cool effect), and everything else. If you like music that moves you and takes you to wonderful places, you will love this CD. It's great to write to, relax to, listen to on headphones, read to, make love to... pretty much everything BUT party to. I personally can't imagine playing any of my favorite CD's at a party, so that isn't as much of a loss as it is a gain. <br />...The Mahavishnu Orchestra (along with Miles Davis and Pink Floyd) are truly exceptional, musicians who cared not about pyrotechnics, abuse of their instruments, making their songs \\"catchy,\\" or polluting their minds with drugs, but about the single most important thing: THE ACTUAL MUSIC!
B00004XQ83|5.0|Simply the best ever of the movie soundtrack genre. If you saw the movie, then you already know you must own the soundtrack. If you've heard the soundtrack, then, Brother, go see the movie! Doesn't matter if you're an opera buff, a R&amp;B afficianado, a blues lover...doesn't even matter if you hate country music. This one is for everyone.<BR>Outtasight, definitely.
B000002P5W|5.0|Out of all the Hendrix CDs I have (the entire Experience Hendrix catalog, plus god knows how many bootlegs), I believe Axis is the best of Jimi's songwriting talent.  Such examples would be the title track Bold as Love (especially), Castles Made of Sand, Little Wing and Up from the Skies, a sci-fi sorta track.  Musically, he travels into more asiatic sounds found in One Rainy Wish and Castles Made of Sand that would be later heard in tracks like Drifting on the First Rays CD, while maintaining the Are You Experienced? driving force.  I usually group AYE? and Axis together when describing Jimi to a newbie, because they are musically pretty parallel, which is not a bad thing at all.  If you haven't heard Jimi before, you really should buy the first CD first before venturing into this album, which is a bit heavier on the mind.
B00008LDPU|4.0|It can be argued that this collection of 9 animated shorts based on the world of The Matrix was as anticipated as Reloaded.  I, for one, was incredibly intrigued just by the concept.  I asked myself &quot;could any movie actually pull this off?&quot;  The Animatrix answers my question.  The world that The Wachowski Brothers have created truly is the Star Wars of this generation.  It is a cutural phenomena, and the quality of the 9 shorts that comprise The Animatrix show the impact of The Matrix.  Here's a review of each short:<br />1) Final Flight Of the Osiris-This is the only short film to be done in 3-D.  It was done, in fact, by the team behind the 3-D movie Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within.  It looks great and incredibly realistic.  The story directly relates to the events in Reloaded.  A great way to kick off this collection because it is the most familiar in style and feel.  <br />2 &amp; 3) The Second Renaissance-This two-parter tells the story of how man and machine came to fight against each other.  Probably my favorite of all the shorts story-wise, because it gave me chills and also made me think way too much about the possibilities it presents.  Be warned, this is probably the most violent of all the short films here.<br />4) Kid's Story-Another story that directly relates to something alluded to in Reloaded.  Remember the annoying kid Neo encountered in Zion who always followed him everywhere?  This is your chance to see what that was really about.  <br />5) Program-This short deals with the training process people who have been freed must go through.  It has absoutely breathtaking animation, and is the most &quot;anime&quot; of the 9.<br />6) World Record-This story shows the possibilities of being &quot;plugged-in.&quot;  Think that the only way someone can be freed is by taking the red pill?  Watch this.  The most interesting and inventive story as far as I'm concerned, coupled with a unique style of animation.<br />7) Beyond-This short deals with how the machines handled glitches in the system.  It has gorgeous animation, with bright colors and a thoroughly Japanese look.  <br />8) A Detective Story-Remember Trinity's legendary hacker status, alluded to in the first movie?  This is the whole story.  This one has a very unique style that I think fit the feel of the story well, and it's nice to see Trinity when she was still the baddest hacker on the block.<br />9) Matriculated-Can the machines be convinced to join the human side?  After all, if humans were batteries and if machines have A.I., doesn't that make both man and machine connected in some way?  This last short, with the best-looking animation out of the 9, answers those questions.  Just as The Second Renaissance will make you feel for man, this one will make you feel for the other side.<br />Overall, I'd say The Animatrix succeeded what it set out to do.  This was never meant to be enjoyed on the same level as the movies, it was meant to give everyone a further understanding of what The Matrix is and provide a more detailed backstory to complement the movies.  It is great to see how the animators do sometimes recreate such effects as bullet-time.  It comes very very close to being as dazzling and visually stunning as the movies themselves.  The stories are a little sad, but they also kind of have to be.  The root of why The Matrix is so popular is because there is nothing as painful for humans to watch than well, ourselves.  The Matrix is spectacular and impossible, and at the same time the emotional impact of these 9 shorts, as well as the movies, is what really keeps the audience watching.  <br />As for the DVD itself, the menus are at once cool and a little bit overdone (navigating them can be a little weird the first time you pop it into your DVD player).  There are few extras but nothing fancy, although the commentaries included on The Second Renaissance 1 and 2, Program, Beyond from the creators offer insight into the stories as well as the conceptual process (don't worry they are subtitled in English).  <br />Overall, if you are a fan of the movie, or of animation, you owe it to yourself to check The Animatrix out.  The stories are great, the animation is both varied and beautiful, and the whole thing is, quite simply, cool.  In a word: whoa.
B000002P5R|5.0|Ok, I'll admit it, I'm rather biased towards Jimi, but for good reason.  Second only to John McLaughlin (of Miles Davis and Mahavishnu Orchestra fame), Jimi is THE guitar God.  It goes beyond shredding and chops, it's the soul and jamage of his music that's rad.  Me and a buddy always refers to this as the 5th album, even though it was released 27 years after his death.  Why?  School yourself:<br />First Rays was the prospective double-LP he was working on during the Cry of Love tour, but due to his untimely demise, his catalog was then subject to poor management and the contents of this album were relased over many posthumous albums, some headed by the infamous Alan Douglas, who bastardized Jimi's name for decades to come.  When the family got the rights (and rightfully so), they released this as Jimi would've...with the exception of my fav. track, My Friend, which was just a Greenwich Village-esque jam.<br />The point being, this is the first posthumous Jimi release that truly represents what direction he was headed towards.  Band of Gypsy tracks like Earth Blues and Izabella, ballads like Angel and Drifting, long jams like Stepping Stone and Hey Baby, and the same ole blues like Belly Button Window.  Personally, this album is second to Electric Ladyland for me.  Many reasons why, too small of a space to explain, but if you haven't heard the man before, PLEASE buy the first four CDs first!
B00008S2VG|4.0|This Album is so grate, but its grate in a wery diffrent way then RAY OF LIGHT and MUSIC. Madonna has been the Pop Queen for a long time now. Prehaps she wants to take a step in a diffrent direction and be the queen of the Alternitive music, a type of music that has no queen. Well maybe Bjork...
B000003CKH|5.0|I don't really know how I first heard about Cake.  A friend, I think, was telling me about \\"The Distance\\" and saying how awesome it was (you know how that goes).  So I just had to hear it.  When I bought the CD Fashion Nugget I had no idea of what to expect.  And being that at that time I was listening to bands like Nirvana and the Smashing Pumpkins, this was quite the change of pace for me.  But I liked it.  Just like so many other people liked it.  You don't really know why or how, but you just do.  It's one of those unexplainable, but comfortable feelings.  Although \\"The Distance\\" is really the only song people who don't own this album know, aside from maybe \\"I Will Survive\\" (an exalting cover of the Gloria Gaynor original), I actually enjoyed the other songs more.  And that should be your main motivation for wanting to purchase this album.  Here's an overview:<br />1. Frank Sinatra - 5/5 - right off the bat we have my favorite Cake song to date.  This bold, straightforwardly titled tune is very good as far as sound and especially lyrics.  The frequently used line `while Frank Sinatra sings \\"Stormy Weather\\" / the flies and spiders get along together' doesn't even begin to prepare you.  Excellent.<br />2. The Distance - 5/5 - we all know this one.  And if you don't I don't how the heck you got here.  Musically it's less enjoyable than track 1, but that really doesn't matter.  The suspicious and almost apprehensive words give you a feeling that no other song (or band) can.  If you've heard this song, buy this album.<br />3. Friend Is A Four Letter Word - 5/5 - if you're wondering what that title represents, just think of a couple of curse words that would replace the word \\"friend\\".  Believe it or not, this one might also be better than \\"The Distance\\".  It's more melodic (in a Cake sort of way) than previous and latter songs, and is remarkably smart.<br />4. Open Book - 2.5/5 - a strangely messy guitar sound doesn't allow for \\"Open Book\\" to stand out amidst the other songs.  Still, it is a decent song with some great instrumental work and lyrics that again make you think.<br />5. Daria - 5/5 - this is one of those songs that will grow on you over time.  And it's grown on me so much that I'd rank it right up there with tracks 1 through 3.  The way `Daria' is sung around the musical background is absolutely flawless.  This is definitely a hidden gem that too many people overlook.<br />6. Race Car Ya-Yas - 3/5 - this is a bizarre song; even for Cake.  It seems to be a shorter rip-off of \\"The Distance\\", and at just under 1:30, it doesn't do much.  Still, the `...where large, fuzzy dice still hang proudly / like testicals from rearview mirrors' excerpt was funny.<br />7. I Will Survive - 5/5 - don't expect any comparisons between Cake's rendition and the original.  Since it is a cover you cannot compliment the originality John McCrea brings to the lyrics, but you can compliment the music.  Very cool.<br />8. Stickshifts And Safetybelts - 2/5 - I don't particularly enjoy this song.  I can't say it's horrible, but it's certainly not good.  The title is not sung very smoothly, and lyrics don't seem to carry any hidden messages.  Steer clear of this one.<br />9. Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps - 5/5 - you just have to love this song.  Here McCrea asks a girl if she loves him; only for her to respond `perhaps, perhaps, perhaps' (fittingly).  This is undoubtedly one of Fashion Nugget's best, and the trumpet work is incredible.<br />10. It's Coming Down - 4/5 - very similar to track 9, \\"It's Coming Down\\" it good, but nowhere near perfect.  The swings from quiet to frenetic are not that enjoyable, sadly.  But (again) the way McCrea sings the title is worthy of mention.<br />11. Nugget - 5/5 - this song is the reason you see an \\"explicit lyrics\\" sticker on the CD.  The `shut the fxck up / learn to buck up' chorus is rather offensive, but still awe-inspiring.  I have a hard time saying this song is the album's best, but it's one of my favorites.<br />12. She'll Come Back To Me - 1.5/5 - who would've ever thought Cake could do a country song.  It might be that you'll be so unprepared for this song that it's not pleasant.  You'll either love this song, or you'll hate it.<br />13. Italian Leather Sofa - 3/5 - it's starting to appear that Cake is running out of ideas with this song.  The lyrics are somewhat enjoyable.  But the music is zilch compared to tracks 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, and 11.  Still kind of intriguing though.<br />14. Sad Songs And Waltzes - 4/5 - the word \\"sad\\" should be aided with the adjective \\"very\\".  This song is unlike anything else on Fashion Nugget, and therefore it is again somewhat enjoyable to listen to.  But the comparisons to the great songs just `aren't selling this year`.<br />By now you can form your opinions about Cake by listening to their radio hits like \\"Short Skirt/Long Jacket\\" and \\"Never There\\".  But really, it's the unpopular gems like \\"Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps\\" and \\"Daria\\" that make Fashion Nugget so timeless and amazing.  If you have heard \\"The Distance\\" or any Cake song for that matter--and liked it--you will love this CD.  Be prepared to go through 14 tracks that are painstakingly beautiful, instrument-filled, sometimes one-dimensional hits that will broaden or at least bend your musical tastes into the genre of: different.  You know what kind of person you are.  If you're into THIS type of music, buy Fashion Nugget.  All jokes about Cake the band and the dessert aside.  This is a worthwhile recording.r />12.

B00000JLWW|2.0|i agree with another user's comments about this dvd: i love the movie (for me it's one of the best movies of the last decade), but i think this dvd edition is really really bad... it's not only that it doesn't have any extras at all: to add pain to injury, the video it's not anamorphic but letterboxed, so if you've a widescreen tv you'll have to zoom in the picture, losing quality. of course it's better than a vhs, but that's not the point with this kind of film... it's one of the worst dvd editions i've ever seen, period. but the movie is so good that you'll forget about this details when you start to see it!
1582432678|5.0|I admit that it was with some almost prurient interest I first picked up &quot;We Need To Talk About Kevin&quot; by Lionel Shriver, but such base instincts quickly turned to admiration for her literate prose and the fascinating story she wove. Many of us mothers have been mulling myriad questions about the teens who have participated in school shootings over the past few years and I was interested in a view of that issue.  I wanted &quot;why&quot; answers, who doesn't? But of course things aren't that black and white.<br />Shriver draws us into the &quot;perfect storm&quot; of a child who can only be described as a &quot;bad seed&quot;, a cold mother and a delusional father. We know from the onset that this hurricane produces no happy ending, in fact the ending is even sadder than we anticipate, although there is a glimmer...<br />I have to pick at one slight nit about the reference to military academies (like West Point and Annapolis) as being for troubled or recalcitrant boys. Nothing is further from the truth. Our military academies take the cream of the crop (both male and female and only 1% of those who apply) to become U.S. military officers. I think the author was actually referring to military schools which are quite another thing.
B000002UAU|4.0|There can be no doubt this album was unlike anything heard -- or seen -- before in pop music. The gate-fold album cover, the lyrics printed on the back, and the exotic sounds inside all showed the Beatles had turned the world of pop music inside out, just four years after issuing their first album. However, I wish I'd first heard this album then -- in 1967 -- so I could hear how revolutionary it was. Because by the time I heard it, 10 years later, some of its magic had worn off. There is still some incredible music here -- but I agree with most reviewers that it doesn't quite measure up to REVOLVER or ABBEY ROAD. One thing is clear -- this album was Paul McCartney's baby (and producer George Martin's), and it's easy to see why, in later years, Paul was the only Beatle who still sung its praises. John Lennon tended to debunk it, George Harrison said he wasn't all that interested in it, and Ringo Starr said he learned to play chess during the long, drawn out process of recording it. That said, there are great moments on it. We hear Ringo's finest vocal performance ever -- the one and only Billy Shears gives it all he's got on \\"With a Little Help From My Friends\\". John's \\"Lucy in the Sky\\" is a beautiful song, with George showing the influence India had had on his playing by mimicing John's vocal line with his guitar. Those influences were stronger still, of course, on Harrison's own contribution, \\"Within You Without You\\". Again, that must have sounded revolutionary in 1967, but nowadays, it cries out for editing --- shorten it by a couple of minutes and it would be fine! The most jarring moment of the album comes right after that -- we jump immediately from Harrison's mystic excursion to the goofy vaudeville clarinets of Paul's \\"When I'm 64\\". Every time I hear that song, I wonder what kind of self-respecting rock band could put out a number like this! McCartney's bass-playing, however, was stellar throughout, and show why Lennon, even at his angriest, would still callPaul the best bass-player in the business. And McCartney did have some good stuff here --\\"Lovely Rita\\" and \\"Fixing a Hole\\" are enjoyable -- especially George's extended guitar solo in the latter -- and \\"She's Leaving Home\\" is beautifully crafted -- especially the way John's counter melody blends with Paul's main theme. Yeah, I know it's a tear-jerker, but it still puts a lump in my throat.  There are other interesting moments -- the swirling \\"Mr Kite\\", the honking brass and Paul's scorching guitar solo on \\"Good Morning, Good Morning\\" -- and I love the hen-cluck that turns into a guitar note as Sgt Pepper's Band comes out to say good night.   But the one song that lifts PEPPER to the top ten of the all-time album list is the final one. \\"A Day In the Life\\" is such an extraordinary piece that it DEMANDS that you play the entire album over again, just to again be swept up in its incredible power. Lennon's eery, haunting vocal throughout and the vortex of noise that attack us -- TWICE -- followed by the crashing piano chord at the very end -- leave the listener breathless in their wake. Ringo's drumming was never more effective.  And Paul's \\"ahhhh\\" that floats over the orchestral bridge that takes us from his section back to John's is a thing of beauty.  This may be the very best Beatles song of all time!  On the whole, PEPPER was definitely a strong album, and it's an essential part of anyone's Beatle collection. But oh, how much stronger it would have been had two songs originally meant to be part of it -- \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" and \\"Penny Lane\\" -- not been pulled in order to be released as a single (in those days, the Beatles tried to avoid their singles also being included on albums).
B00008H2LB|1.0|linkin park is, like, pretty lame.  the music is pretty typical, you know, like other rock bands on the radio.  listen to bands like white stripes, the strokes, the flaming lips, wilco, beatles, beck, or sonic youth might just be what you need.  pass on the 12 year old boy band.  that's all.
0440178002|5.0|What every great protagonist must have is smarts and imagination and the hero in this book pulls some amazing stunts. A love that is so respected, so cherished, so honored. The ending however, brings such an original twist to this tale. These days, the only thing we ever pledge allegiance to is the flag, and even that, only half-heartedly. In Shogun, allegiance means lifetime, at least until a better offer comes along. I've read it three times and I've spoken with people who've read it eight times. It's that good. And the series aspect, viewing a family down through the generations only enhances Clavell's greatness.
B0000931OG|5.0|It is quite impossible- at least for journalists- to write a review about Think Tank without touching guitarist Graham Coxon's deplorable departure. As an avid Blur fan who owns all of their albums neither can I, and I have to say I feel truly sad about this turn of events. Coxon is one of a kind, and his singular guitar sound shall forever remain one of Blur's essential trademarks. The good news is, that the three remaining members have made a wise decision by not replacing him; and the truth is that once you get used to the idea that Graham's gone, you'll find that Think Tank is easily Blur's most mature post-Britpop album. Their self-titled 1997 album was exciting and fresh yet flirted with mediocrity toward the end of the album. 1999's 13 was a brilliant trip, yet far too experimental and alienating for quite a few listeners. Think Tank, however, manages to sound accessible and easily likable WITHOUT neglecting Blur's quirky and creative originality: The refreshing interludes are still intact (this time snugly and smartly hidden in between the tracks), and \\"We've Got A File On You\\" is the type of song only Blur can write and perform. However, Think Tank sounds just as cohesive as The Great Escape, excluding Damon's serio-comic Britpop element. Instead, the album holds a strong motif: Finding comfort in this war-ridden, fast-moving world that's so deeply immersed in technology, drugs, cynicism and vapid hedonism. Unlike with the eponymous album and 13, the lyrics are the dominating part of the album, as Damon reaches this comfort through love, nature and most importantly music. From decisive opener \\"Ambulance\\"'s recovery theme (\\"I know I'm not there but I'm getting there if you let me live my life\\") to \\"Jets\\"' perfectly solacing metaphor (\\"Jets are like comets at sunset\\"), the album just doesn't stop delivering. Like a Britpop ballad recorded in a Moroccan mosque, first single \\"Out Of Time\\" reveals hidden layers on repeated listens, as Damon reminds us to stop the race for a minute in order to truly enjoy what this world has to offer. \\"Gene By Gene\\" continues Blur's satire toward America, which comes off even stronger now due to the current state of the world. \\"Crazy Beat\\", \\"On The Way To The Club\\" and \\"Brothers And Sisters\\" doggedly protest against the 21st century's individuality-abolishing society, whereas \\"Sweet Song\\" offers cradling over a missed opportunity. Quite expectedly, \\"Battery On Your Leg\\" comes off as a fine goodbye to Graham, with his guitar coming in for a last duet with Damon's vocals and piano; Yet the best song here is the \\"Caramel\\" sequel \\"Caravan\\", with a haunting piano line and truly emotional lyrics. Damon reminds us through the caravan metaphor that even though we may be far from our family, its love and acceptance remain in our heart. This song inspires and brings hope for a new life. Damon's harmonica solo in the middle of the song is pricelessly touching and worth the price of the album alone. My only faint complaint goes to the second single, the \\"Song 2\\"-meets-\\"Bugman\\"-with-a-strong-shade-of-\\"B.L.U.R.E.M.I.\\" \\"Crazy Beat\\": It seems quite strainedly idiosyncratic, and I suspect that it was only put here in order to be released as a US single; However as mentioned before, its misleading lyrics save it. Over ten years in the business and departed from one of the best guitarists in the world, and Blur still sound fresh, exciting and thoroughly worth following. If only all Britpop bands were like them...
0688170528|4.0|This is a great read for book clubs.  There is a lot to analyze about the characters, and the families.  The book is well written, but does leave lots of unanswered questions which made for a great discussion in my group.  <br />Parts of the book veered toward the sappy, as advertised by the \\"Lifetime Television Movie\\" sticker on the front, but for the most part this was an engrossing read.
B00005JKCH|1.0|Great adaptation, cinematography, action sequences. Unfortunately there is way too much romantic development. I'll write more as soon as I can force myself to watch the whole thing. Very disappointing.
0312305060|4.0|These stories intertwine in a wonderful and very moving way.  The writing is simply beautiful, the tone perfectly expresses the tug between inspiration and the bleakness of everyday life.  Though as a novel it seems disjointed, the whole thing comes together marvelously at the end, in a very surprising and moving way.  It actually made my cry a little, yet feel wonder at the possibilities of life even as we experience so much pain.  Not many novels can do this much, particularly contemporary ones.<br />Warmly recommended.
0312932081|5.0|I usually have trouble finding a good book to read, but as I read the first page of Ender's Game, I was already hooked. I think it was the way Orson Scott Card wrote the book because it got me so interested and so I continued to read it. The plot is awesome its great to see the authors views of the future. For example your only allowed to have two children and the government chooses if you may have a third.Its very easy to read and the buggers (aliens) attacking the planet is just fasinating to read about. But it does go further, Ender's life at home and he being a third (third child of the family) is really emotional.  Ender and his journey at battle school are absolutly fasinating, the earth life for Peter and Valentine was pretty was interesting but on a different level. Overall I loved the book and it's great for people who have problems finding great books to read. I'm exited to read the next book of the series (Ender's Shadow) because Orson Scott Card is a brilliant author.
B00000IPAX|5.0|This CD is one of my favorites. I can listen to this over and oveer again with out getting sick of it. Some of the greatest songs are on this: Going away to college, Whats my age again, Adam's Song, All the Small things, and Wendy clear. If your thinking about getting this CD you should. If you like this CD then you will probably like Green day and Sum 41. I am 15 years old and I think blink-182 is a pretty good band.
B00008EPRY|5.0|this is the best of any album they ever did early in thier careers and live from woodstock five stars all the way plus im almost 50 and can remember great times and memories when i listen to it feels like im 16 again...
B00007L4MJ|5.0|Having read the book as a boy, I have tried in vain to view the various Metropolis's out there and make some connection to the book I had read.<br />Finally, I understand.  I have never seen the movie the way it was intended!<br />The best part of this version is all the restored scenes!  Granted, not all are even available any more, but I can finally follow the book.<br />The second best part is the score!  What a great piece of music which was actually written for the film.  In fact, much of the success of the restoration is due to the score, since the detailed cues and scene descriptions in the score gave the restorers a perfect, original overview upon which to base their work.<br />Last, but not least, the picture quality is miraculous.  Watching the featurette concerning the restoration showed what meticulous care went into it.  And it shows!  Crisp Clear better- than-your-average-`50s movie with great care to retain the depth of the animated portions - while maintaining consistency throughout.<br />Kudos and Thank You for finally making the film come back to life!
B000001IPL|5.0|This is by far the best cd offspring has ever had, and it is difficult to beat their other material. Their messages are clear and concise and their music is strong. I hope for more excellent music from them as they spend more time recording.
B00005JLRT|3.0|First of all, the guy who wrote this could not be much of a Next Generation fan.  When the duplicate Data is discovered, no mention is made of the possibility that it could be Lor, Data's evil twin brother from the series. Also, what happened to Data's emotion chip? These points could have been brought up later in the film, but I just couldn't sit through the whole thing.  The plot was so needlessly complicated(and dull) that I had to go on to more interesting things, like cleaning out my bathtub drain.<BR>The main problem I have with this film, and all the Next Generation movies, is the lack of magic and wonder.  Unlike the original Trek, the emphasis is on explosions and fancy light shows.  I don't know about most of you, but as far as I'm concerned, expensive special effects get really boring really fast.  PS, there are too many humanoid aliens.  Enough already!!!
0345440900|5.0|This book is superb! I especially like the way the author writes, she is a incredibly talented person with great since of humor. The techniques she describes in the book work like a charm. I am so glad I read this book and took her advice with the EASY plan. My baby who is 6 mo. today has adapted extremely well to this plan and he is a truly happy baby. I recommend this book so that you can eliminate the guessing game.
B00005M989|2.0|But it's definitely worth passing by. For the best Prince &quot;Best Of&quot; experience, get Hits 1 and 2, and Hits + B-Sides. A lot of great stuff is left out here, making this ideal only for the casual fan.
0440237688|3.0|`The Giver', written by Louis Lowry is a fiction novel about a world which seems to be perfect...<br />The world in which Jonas lives seems to be perfect, no suffer no grief no pain and no unemployment. Jonas will soon get an 'Assignment' at the `Ceremony of twelve', that means<BR>he will get a job. Jonas is chosen to get a job as the 'Receiver', who keeps all the memories <BR>of the past and those, which are withhold from the people of the community. When Jonas begins to receive the memories from the `Giver' he sees that this `perfect' world has its seamy side. People aren't allowed to have any feelings, any individualism, own thinking and fun. It is only a world, that works and those who don't fit to it, because they are too old, too weak or break some of  the many rules belonging to the community, get killed. When Jonas finds out that his little `brother' Gabriel (there are no real families, family units get allocated) will be released ( Release is an euphemism for killing) he flees after he talked to the Giver with Gabriel from the community.<br />  <BR>My opinion about the book: I like the topic of  the book, because it gives us a warning  about  how the future could look like if we don't care and of some dictators, who try to create totaliarianisms. So I liked the topic, but I didn't like how the author wrote it, because there are too many questions, that were not answered. Besides the whole book is a little bit too trivial and more for little children. Also in some points it is not realistic, but it is just a fictional book.
B00005LMBK|4.0|Initially I thought that Gorillaz were trying to be a little to electic covering quite a few musical genres.. But the more I listened, the more I realized that it effectively gels well as a whole album.  <br />Just a very mellow mood through most of the record and the different vocals definately give it variety.  It was also nice hearing Del on the radio (the hit single Clint Eastwood), never thought I'd see that day!  Have to give them mucho respect for having him appear in a few tracks, he is one of the brightest lights in the underground rap scene.  <br />Anyway, if you missed this album the first time around, it still sounds fresh and is worth checking out.  Enjoy it since it might be awhile till they put out another album seeing as how this is just a side project.  Peace..  =)
B000068PQ0|5.0|I bought this along with Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, since I kept seeing them on best of 2002 lists.  This album had me scratching my head the first few times I listened to it...  Although like others have stated it really grows on you after a few listens.  Found this to be a better record then Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.  <br />Just some really beautiful songs that get stuck in your head no matter how hard you try not to let them.  The only track that gets old, in my opinion, is Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots Part 2.  The rest are keepers, along with the cd and thus far haven't found a stronger album from last year.  Cop it..
B00009EIQE|5.0|My, my, my Buddy Guy you have definitely got the blues this time, yes you do.Welcome back Buddy:) So [darn] simple, so absolutely beautiful. Front porch, sitting in the shade & doing some blues. Nothing complicated, no show boating, no playing to the crowd (Mustang Sally:) a blues album for the true blues lover. Songs from John Lee Hooker, Frankie Lee Sims, Willie Dixon, Son House, Johnny Shines,Jack Owens  & Robert Nighthawk fill this cup to the brim. The playing is wonderful but it is the SINGING people, the voice, the human instrutment that just blows your mind man.. Man, you just seemed to forget what a powerful & soulful singer Mr. BG can be. He is just vocal dynamite on this CD. BOOM, BOOM, BOOM. The CD starts out with Skip James tune HARD TIME KILLING FLOOR, an epic to hard times. Nail this bad boy to the floor BG. You got me feeling it Buddy, a desperate man indeed ,hoping for hope. CRAWLING KINGSNAKE, JLH chestnut, has Buddy crawling the floor for his lady. Sexy little number folks. Frankie Sims LUCY MAE BLUES next in line, done easy friends, no hurry, no worry, laid back. CAN'T SEE BABY (Jack Owens) talking about a man & wife in love but they can't get along. Been there, done that, have t-shirt.You can feel the hurting Buddy, yes I can.. LOVE THE LIFE I LIVE (Willie Dixon) once again, taken down a notch to take full advantage of Buddy's voice. LOUISE MCGHEE (Son House) nobody has the power of Mr. House but Buddy does a real sweet job on this tune. That Louise McGhee was indeed a heartbreaker who men did not forget. MOANIN' & GROANIN' (Johnny Shines) one of best vocal tracks on CD. BLACK CAT BLUES (JLH) man moanin' bout bad luck & troubles. In other words LIFE. BAD LIFE BLUES lady done wrong song that is on EVERY blues CD. Good man treated bad. Poor, hungry, down in the dumps the man can't get a break. One of best tunes on CD. SALLY MAE (JLH) starts with Buddy banter about JLH. Nice t ouch. Real sweet vocals on this one. ANNA LEE  (Robert Nighthawk) startswith real sweet riff. Man wants woman song. Another of my favs here. End it with LONESOME HOME BLUES (Willie Borum) slow, easy tune with Buddy lightly touching these lonesome blues. I feel the pain Buddy, I do. Buddy has done an OUTSTANDING blues CD. Wonder if it will sell ? We shall see.......
B000002HPV|4.0|It is a mystery to me why I love her music so much. Maybe it's because she takes her music to a level that no one  else can ever claim. And she dares to be totally original and artistic in her music.  She definitely stands out and will be considered a great artist when people will refer to music in our period. HOMOGENIC is a good album. The first four songs are especially great and rememorable. But then the album kinda loses me but captures me at the end with &quot;All is Full of Love&quot;. While (IMO) POST and VESPERTINE are Bjork's best albums; HOMOGENIC still shows Bjork's great talent to take music to new heights.
B00008H2LB|4.0|first off, the cd is pretty good...second, yeah, its short, big deal.... third, it sounds a little repetetive... and fourth, there are different kinds of music for different people... and here we have people saying that linkin park is just pop with a harder sound to it.... i think they have way more emotion than any pop song i've ever heard.... so, people, just calm down... listen to what you like....
B00005JM93|5.0|I found this to be one of the most brilliant and invigorating films I've ever seen! I find it a revelation and a thrill to see violence in this world depicted in a realistic, over the top, unflinching way. Of course much of the blood and gore we see here is obviously the work of a great CGI department, but when you see the impact of that fire extinguisher against the man's head and the prosthetic [member] used during the epic rape scene, you can't help but admire Gaspar Noe's bravura and daring. He pulls no punches and leaves nothing to the imagination. I wasn't disturbed, repulsed or felt the need to look away once, on the contrary, I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. \\"Irreversible\\" is the jolt of genius and reality modern cinema has long needed. A job well done!
B00006879E|5.0|When I first heard Maroon 5 open for John Mayer, I immediately went and bought the CD. As I listened to it, I was not disappointed. In fact, I was blown away. This band is truly unique, and there is not a single song on the CD I don't like! If you're looking for a favorite, I would have to say number 6, The Sun, and also, um, all the rest!! Buy this CD and u won't be let down!
B00005OAIE|4.0|Ya wanna know what bugs me?  When snobby critics rip on people for making music with concrete lyrics!  Wow, John Mayer songs acutally GO somewhere, that means they suck, right?  Maybe John Mayer isn't going to rattle any cages, but the main point of music is that it is pleasent to listen to.  Compared to some of the nasally sludge out there, Mr. Mayer's husky voice and light acoustic guitar are a nice change for pop music.  Overall, the CD is very good background music.  Not mind-blowing, not the next Beatles, but worth the money.
B000023VR6|5.0|Dre's realease of 2001 is a great album. Not only are the beats bangin', but ts is possibly one of the top 5 albums ever released. I play this album in my car all the time and the bass is kickin'.<br />No matter what, if you are Dre fan or not, get this album.
B000067CPX|5.0|The red hot chilli peppers aren't just any punk-rock band. Listening to there music gives you the feeling of comfort. It makes you feel cool and relaxed. It has an effect on me. I recently attend on of their concerts were I screamed my lungs out and watched my idol Anthony Kiedis belt out the lyrics to some of my favourite songs. Being at that concert showed me how important music is and how special the chilli peppers actually are. To me their great. I listen to them every time i have the chance listening to Flea on the bass, John on the guitar, Chad on the drums and Anthony on the mic really made me realize how incredible this quartet is. The concert was the best one i ever seen and I recommend this album to anyone and everyone.
B00005JKPF|5.0|This movie shall prove no point and I intend it to stay that way but...there is great action and stuuf and many people think that it was boring but no it wasn't. I have to say that there will be a part three by how it ended. So Rogue and Bobby kissed but it didn't last long. I like all the acting and the plot. Well that is all good bye.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I just bought this DVD and listened to it last night.  I was blown away.  I only saw Led Zeppelin once, in July 1979 at Oakland Stadium.  Page was not in good form and the rest of the band had trouble compensating for his poor playing.  This DVD shows how great Zep was when all band members were on.  Bonham's drum pounding (you can't just call it \\"playing\\") rattles your bones, Jones' bass and keyboard playing is the glue that keeps the band on track, Page's guitar is wailing (his solo on In My Time of Dying is a classic) and Plant's voice is in classic form.  This DVD is a godsend for fans who've been waiting for something like this for a long time.
B00005JL3A|3.0|The game is way better and there are too many spoofs like the writing in the the beginning &quot;TODAY ALL YOU'RE DREAMS COME TRUE&quot; they were both different and that was noticeable to me. The speacial effects were great and so was the action and acting. The way they made the ending it means that there has to be a sequel and I hope that they make it a little better than the first. That is all...Good bye.
B00005ATQD|5.0|I am here to say that if you do not like this movie you have successfully been brainwashed by the establishment and should be corralled into a slaughterhouse and killed like the human cattle you are.<br />This movie is the closest thing to life as possible, without blood actually oozing from the screen.  Watching this movie is like staring into the portal of a parallel dimension, a glimpse into the dark soul of man.  This movie is like the quatrains of Nostradamus, the answer is for the initiated...for the illumined...
B00005JKZV|5.0|This a good movie and an awsome battle of the worlds movie! WOOHOO! This has a lot of action and fighting. The Two Towers has to be the movie of the year. I ove this movie and the way that the producer made the graphics and lighting. This is definitely my first choice in all the movies I like.
0783225733|5.0|This film, in my opinion, is a staggering achievement--the saga of Apollo 13, the first time an American spacecraft was in real danger of destruction.  The most impressive thing about this film is the fact that almost the entire storyline is absolutely authentic.  The skill and bravery (and honest fears) of the crew, the ingenuity of the NASA ground support team, the events as portrayed in the movie--all of this is what actually happened.  For once Hollywood manages to almost completely avoid tampering with the facts--this is said to be the influence of Tom Hanks, who is a space enthusiast; Hanks believed (correctly!) that the actual story contained more than sufficient drama.  The movie moves at a quick pace, never drags, and the end packs an emotional wallop that I personally found to be unforgettable.  I saw this film when it first came out, and just revisited it on DVD.  The impact is the same--this is a powerfully told story about a great event and a great success of courage and technological prowess.<br />I like Tom Hanks as an actor, and this is the best performance by him that I can recall seeing.  He simply becomes his character, Astronaut Lovell--he plays the part to utter perfection.  The supporting cast is equally good and all turn in superb performances.  This is a great and classic film that will leave few viewers untouched.  The DVD audio and video are crisp and clean, and this DVD belongs in every library collection.
B00005JLXE|2.0|So! Have you been awake during the times of STUPIDITY? I mean man this has got to be the lamest movie. The action was good and the acting ok and the rest well let me see...[was bad]! The music was the best part of the movie and so were a couple of the fight scenes. When Elektra and \\"Daredevil\\" are fighting that was dumb when she didn't kill him I mean she had a clear shot at him and she takes the time to take off his mask when all that precious time she could have cut him up. So Elektra and \\"Bull's Eye\\" Fight and the Sai through her hand was awesome and then there she goes of course that's it and the movie get's pretty dull from there and that is all i have to say!
B00005RHGL|5.0|This is entertainment.  Loaded with fantastic storytelling, through both character development and narration.  Kilmer and Russell both give the performances of a lifetime.  The entire ensemble cast was perfect.  The costuming, cinematography, imagery and script were all unbelievable.  <br />This film has the tendency to come across as a big budget, blockbuster wannabe.  And it should have been.  However, there are layers to this movie that require multiple viewings to really find.  The \\"Revelations\\" references are brilliant, and inspiring.  (at least to me)  <br />Other reviewers mention the cameos and small supporting roles.  I think Billy Bob Thornton steals that show.<br />Buy it.  Watch it.  Great Movie.
B00006F83Y|5.0|If you're like me, and you gave up on the metal/hard rock genre sometime around, say, 1987, do yourself a favor and reintroduce yourself.  It's hard to know what to compare this album to.  It's not gimmicky nu-metal, or alternathrash.  It's just great songwriting, great lyrics, and terrific instrumentation.  It's the most intelligent and well crafted metal (if you have to put into that genre) in a long, long time.
B000005IRG|2.0|Like a punk version of Yes without synthesizers.  Tedious and pretentious.  If you're expecting high energy NY punk like the Ramones, Dolls, Heartbreakers, or creative noise and tone poems like VU or Sonic Youth, you'll likely be dissapointed.  ZZZZZZZZZZZZ.
B00005JLD4|4.0|In the Australian Outback in the 1930s, three half caste Aboriginal girls are taken from their mothers in their hometown of Jigalong by the authorities headed by Kenneth Branagh, who wants to keep the races pure; and placed in what can only be described as a fundamentalist concentration camp.<BR>However the girls Molly (Evelyn Sampi), Daisy (Tianna Sansbury) and Gracie (Laura Monaghan) escape and begin a long trek home by following the Rabbit-Proof Fence of the title, which is meant to divide rabbits and farmland and at 1,500 miles long is the longest fence in the world. Though it takes the white fullas tracking them half the movie to figure that out.<BR>Directed by Phillip Noyce (CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER, THE BONE COLLECTOR) and based on the book by Doris Pilkington, RABBIT-PROOF FENCE is an honest, emotionally-charged  and beautifully shot film which does grow a bit tiresome at times (even given its 90 minute duration), but which still leaves the viewer affected. Features \\"music\\" by Peter Gabriel.<BR>Special features include making of doco; commentary by Noyce, Pilkington, Gabriel, Branagh and screenwriter/ co-producer Christine Olsen; cast/crew interviews,  the trailer, study guides and press releases; as well as DVD ROM features.

0800141601|4.0|A take-off on the Camelot legend, First Knight spins the yarn a tad differently than you learned in English Literature classes.  Nonetheless, not encumbered by a classical education, I really enjoyed this tale -- even though some purists have grumbled.  Sean Connery  plays a fairly convincing Arthur -- more than a little overwhelmed with the ongoing labors of perpetuating his realm, and an almost adolescence passion for his betrothed, the young Guinevere.  I like the dashing, somewhat Americanized, version of  Lancelot played by Richard Gere - kind of a small town boy makes good sort of character.  And the lovely Guinevere, played by Julia Ormond, seems like a great match for the persistently romantic Lancelot.<br />First Knight does stray from the traditional Camelot, but tells a terrific tale nonetheless.  Lancelot pursues Guinevere into all sorts of perils.  Arthur insists on moral principles and honor at all costs.  Prince Malagant is the quintessential fiend: dressed in black, persecuting the innocents, seemingly unconquerable -- and of course showing his true wickedness in the closing scenes.  ... the movie will entertain you if you like your adventures stories mixed with swashbuckling swordplay and tenderness, in a classic good versus bad tale.  A fun movie!
0440180295|5.0|In the late 1960's society was at complete unrest.  War was occurring in Vietnam, leaders were being shot, and families were drifting apart.  This was the time that Kurt Vonnegut wrote the novel Slaughterhouse-Five.  In the beginning of the novel he places himself as the main point of view.  He sets up the story with his own struggles of isolation.  He calls long lost friends drinks and smokes.  It is here where he visits an old friend and war veteran, whose wife worries that he will glorify the war by writing about it.  By mentioning this I feel that Vonnegut is justifying the novel's randomness, moving it away from a war novel to the multi-set version that it became.  The fact that Vonnegut himself is struggling, sets us up to the struggles that Billy Pilgrim will face while setting us up to the character himself being seen as the eyes and ears of the author.<br />Billy Pilgrim is a very interesting character.  In the novel he experiences the war, personal abuse, disability, mental illness and a lack of self-worth.  As ironic as that sounds, he is the center of the novel, the piece that holds it together.  Billy represents not just the negatives of war, but of the overall problems of the human condition.  The fact that Billy is  a victim and what he represents creates a cynical view of how the author views the world at the time.<br />Some may view Pilgrim strictly as a weak character.  The fact that he is taken advantage of time and time again is difficult to deal with.  I often wondered why he was so pathetic and what the point of that was.  In researching the author for this paper, Vonnegut himself was weak in many ways.  This is why the character of Billy Pilgrim works in this novel.  Kurt Vonnegut needed to be able to make a statement from the core of society, which was weak at the time.  The fact that Pilgrim goes into the future and becomes a celebrity equates his own writing success and what it really means to him versus how he feels about himself.  At one point in the novel he even mentions that writing is like advertising, you need to tell the truth or you get into trouble.<br />It is no accident that by the end of the novel, Billy Pilgrim seldom seems to know who, where and why he is.  The author notes this in the last chapter set in 1967.  It is the year before the assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King occur.  These problems in our society and Pilgrim's cluelessness are used to make a point.  The point that he is trying to make is that Pilgrim is presented as sick and listless but there are good reasons that this is occurring.<br />Still, why is this important to have him as a weakling?  I also feel that he is depicting mental illness as something caused by society itself and it is these mentally ill that create a major part of how the world is run.  Pilgrim at many times in the book is abused so badly you understand why he has become the weak person that he is during many moments of the book.  You understand why he is the weakling or the victim.  Tie that in with the previous points you realize that is us, all of society that is victimized.  It also runs into who is running the world.  In 1976, Pilgrim becomes a hero of society, yet you wonder how that can occur.  You know him as very un-heroic, yet Vonnegut places him in that role as if to say, it is the nuts that are running the asylum.  The point being that some of the same can be said about the leaders of the world during the time this book was written.<br />If the book is to be viewed basically, I could say that Vonnegut is telling us that war is bad.  In fact, the raid of Dresden is a large point regarding the unrest of society.  He could have stayed with this point throughout the entire novel.  It would have been the easy way to make a basic point.  The fact that he moves away from this to Billy in the present and later in the future, what the author is trying to say is that society needs to be fixed not just now, but later, before wars and cruelty cease to exist.<br />As mentioned early, the book is often criticized for being too random in its structure.  It was viewed as a fault.  I believe that randomness was used to make a point and is a strength rather than a weakness.  Vonnegut does this by the pace and quick changes in setting and plot.  The violence and cruelty is another way that he is reaching out to what is going on in the world.  Vonnegut frames this by placing himself in the beginning and end of the novel, thus introducing where he is at in 1969, as well as bringing the novel to a logical conclusion.<br />In conclusion, Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. uses many layers and levels of understanding of society to make his point.  What was happening while his book was being written adds to the structure and meaning of the novel itself.  The novel is not jumpy or all over the road, but rather a well thought out piece using a main character to define the place society was at that time.wars and cruelty cease to exist.<br />As mentioned early, the book is often criticized for being too random in its structure.

B00006JLX4|5.0|The original release was awesome, and so were the albums released after it, but this offereing is simply outstanding.  Released after the band's demise, it is a fitting tribute to a band worthy of rock god stature, and kings of the indie circuit.  The album itself has not one bad track, and even if you have the original release, as I do, this is well worth the money for Watery, Domestic and the live songs.  Any Pavement fan or music fan in general will be blwon away.
B00008AY3L|4.0|i got into Ben harper in 8th grade thanks to my english teacher, who played us 'fight for your mind,' definitely his best stuff. i can't wait to see him live this summer in Berkeley, California.<BR>the best tunes on this CD, in my opinion are-With my own 2 hands, which is very reggae-funky, When It's Good is a GREAT song to sing along to, Diamonds on the Inside (yes it is a Dylan copoff, but i like it anyways), Brown Eyed Blues (a great funky song), & Picture of Jesus thanks to the african roots of it. but some songs are just pretty awful, like 'when she believes' and the fake funk song. blah.<BR>but it's better than burn to shine, i have to say. and i love it overall. it's in my cd player right now.
B00006HBUA|5.0|This film is almost perfect except for one thing...i would say some of the scenes like when the \\"souls\\" come out of people's bodys may be a bit too intense for some younger viewers. But on the other hand, this film directly connects to the cartoon version and is very entertaining. The voices match each other perfectly and the actors are great. Many Scooby Doo fans will certainly enjoy this movie.
B00006FDCD|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time, it's one of the few movies out there that actually scares me a little bit. I can watch it over and over again and it will never get old. If you're a fan of Stephen King, or horror movies in general you must own this movie. If clowns creep you out I reccomend watching this with the lights on!
B00008J2DQ|5.0|WHAT CAN I SAY ABOUT FACELESS. WOW. THESE GUYS CAN ONLY GO UP.<BR>THIS ALBUM REALLY ROCKS. MOST OF THE SONGS ON THIS ALBUM HAVE TOUCH  SO MANY EMOITIONS . WHEN I FIRST HEARD GODSMACK  MY FAVORITE WAS OZZY. HAD BEEN SINCE THE THIRD GRADE. ALL IT TOOK FOR ME WAS TO HEAR MOONBABY AND THAT WAS IT.  BEEN HOOKED EVERY SINCE. WITH THE RELEASE OF FACELESS  IT JUST SHOWS WHAT MAGNATUDE THIS BAND CAN DO. IF YOU HAVENT HEARD THIS ALBUM THEN YOUR MISSING OUT. GODSMACK IS ON THERE WAY TO BEING THE BELT HOLDERS. THEY MAY FEEL FACELESS NOW, BUT IN THE END THEY WILL STAND TALL.  SO IF YOUR LOOKING FOR SOME KICK A@# MUSIC. THEN YOU WOULD TO GET FACELESS. OH AND LOOK FOR THE SPECIAL  BONUS TRACK ON THE CD. THATS ALL I HAVE TO SAY.
B00008H2LB|5.0|This song has to be one of the best songs i have ever heard...
B00008S2VG|4.0|this album actually gets 4.3 stars in my opinion.<BR>I don't see why so many people hate it! After listening to it the first time, I thought it was one of the most dismal recordings in history....<BR>but upon a second listen, it all came clear. Somewhat pretentious and somewhat questionable...but with a very clear message.<BR>You can see her on the cover, sporting what i call her \\"Che Madonna\\" look...Madonna as a \\"peaceful\\" rebel packaging this album like \\"Dear america...\\" and then with a message like: BAM! Get over yourself! It packs a punch, and that's what i love about it. she takes no prisoners this time, but in a believable way.<BR>The arrangements by Mirwais are really quite genius, with no truly bad songs. It sounds sorta like a continuation of the dreadful \\"Music\\", but in a good way.<BR>The best songs, to me, are \\"I'm So Stupid\\", \\"American Life\\", \\"Hollywood\\", \\"Nobody Knows me\\"....and yes, there are others:)<BR>I would reccomend this album to those who are willing to discover something cool on repeated listening. Her best album after \\"Ray of Light\\"
B00008OWZC|5.0|These very clear CDs are astounding not just for the improvisation and execution (a true breath or fresh air) but remind you why you listen to rock and roll in the first place.  These guys are/were talented musicians and they constantly remind you in these songs how far ahead of their time they were...
B00005JLH3|4.0|This movie brings together three critical elements of a successful film: concept, acting and cinematography.  Nick Cannon gives a superb and believable performance as an aspiring drummer who deals with demons of not being able to read music in the college setting.  Thinking his talent alone can propel him through the music reading requirement is where the movie picks up steam and leaves the station...<br />The only thing I may have changed was the predictability.  In the final battle, the champions for the past five years go next to last and, of course, the underdog team, covets the final performance.  Maybe a shock to some, there is a tie and the drumlines duel to the death (not really the death, but to determine who the victor is).<br />A nice concept for sure, Drumline carrys the beat.
0440237688|5.0|The Giver: A book review by Jochen and Waldemar <br />The novel `The Giver' by Lois Lowry is about a community in the future and a small boy who wants to escape from there. There were concrete attributes which he could not abide after he had not take drugs (pills against pain) like everybody else there. <BR>We liked the story `The Giver' by Lois Lowry.<BR>To tell the truth we have to confess that on some parts of the story, the content was a bit boring. But all in all the entire book was imaginative. The mixture of science fiction and fantasy was new to us. With all that fantasy you could reconstruct it. You could imagine that the society today could develop to the society in the book. The book is maybe a alert the people in our world. The people want to have everything perfect today and you can see what might happen if everything seems to be perfect. The main character Jonas was the only one who saw the problem of the community in which he lived, and wanted to have a world in which nothing is perfect but a society with feelings like love. It shows us how important feelings are and that we have to respect and to take care of them.
B000000H48|5.0|Wow! If you are a metal or guitar fan of any persuasion you must own this CD! This has got to be my all-time favorite &quot;neglected gem&quot; in the metal genre. Oddly enough, one of the least-selling and most obscure albums King has ever been involved in, including his Mercyful Fate material. I am an on-again, off-again musician and guitarist who listens to everything from bluegrass and Phish to Slayer and Miles Davis, and I must say that Andy LaRocque, although virtually unknown, is one of the best metal guitarists I've ever heard. Dynamic, precise, fluid and just plain scary, his brilliant soloing elevates this album to incredible Randy-Rhodes-like heights; while creating a cool, gothic dark atmosphere which complements King's unique and frightening imagery perfectly! The best part of this album is the fact that the lineup includes another great metal guitarist, Pete Blakk, especially since King's lineup on other albums is sometimes lacking. If you remember the melodic interplay between metal guitarists Adrian Smith and Dave Murray on Iron Maiden's landmark album &quot;Pieces of Mind&quot; you will understand my excitement. If you don't like King Diamond's voice, buy this anyway. If you have never heard Kind Diamond at all, buy this album; you don't need the rest. If you absolutely HATE King's voice (it is an acquired taste), buy this anyway-you won't be disappointed. If you are an old-school metal fan (you remember what it was like when people actually soloed) you must buy this album! Whew! Besides, with King Diamond, it's Halloween every day! ;)
B00006JJ1O|2.0|God, the refuse we've come to accept as &quot;breakthrough&quot; is astounding.<br />Hey, I'm the first one to admit the songs are catchy...especially the choruses. Like EVERY SINGLE Pop album should be.<br />But have you seen them LIVE? These girls have very little talent. Absolutely no stage presence (and no, kiddies, making out on stage doesn't give you stage presence and charisma), no grace, no vocal projection or expression. It was sad.<br />It is patently obvious that they are a marketing ploy....the Catholic schoolgirl uniforms, the making out on stage, the pre-adolescent/pre-pubescent look, the music written, composed, arranged, played and produced by everyone except them....it's like a modern, female version of Milli Vanilli (though I'm assuming that's them actually singing). <br />To those that say &quot;so what?&quot; You have a point. I still think the music is faceless and generic, but you're right, we should just care about the sound....except it's so funny that there are some describing this as &quot;soul-baring&quot; when they didn't even write it or participate in the creative development in any way, shape or form. I like integrity in my music. That means that if the artist doesn't write/compose or produce it, he/she should at least be able to interpret it well and make it their own.<br />These girls...don't.<br />Do they have staying power? I don't think so. But that remains to be seen, doesn't it?
0393038912|3.0|Having just finished this book, I have mixed feelings about the conclusions. First, let me make one thing perfectly clear: Reading this book is not a waste of time by any stretch of the imagination, so the one star reviews posted here are simply ridiculous. Having said that, I don't believe for a second that Mr. Diamond can be considered even remotely objective; political correctness and an unfair judgment of Europeans is a large part of this book, which is unfortunate.<br />The positive aspects of this book are numerous. A carefully organized voyage through human history, describing the origins of farming, animal domestication, population expansion, language and writing development, new technologies, colonization of new continents, and more. All this information, and presented in a nice writing style with a logical progression. You can't help but feel more knowledgeable and informed on many aspects of human civilization after reading this book.<br />The drawbacks to this book are simple: unfairness. Mr. Diamond rarely discusses European civilization and its benefits, instead describing colonization by Europeans as \\"catastrophic\\" under all circumstances. Some of his assertions as to why other peoples/continents lagged behind Europe in advancement and technology are quite reasonable, and probably correct. Others are glossed over quickly in hopes that the reader doesn't start to think about it too much. In regards to all the great geniuses that Europe has produced, he explains that they're \\"wild cards\\", and nobody knows how they figure into the grand scheme of human history. His view that New Guineans are smarter than Europeans (and white North Americans) is absolutely ludicrous. His basis for this judgment is that New Guineans are good at remembering jungle paths and plantlife, while white people watch too much TV. What!!? Hmmm...or could it be that if you had arrived at the conclusion that Europeans were smarter this book would never have been published, and you would have been dismissed as a racist! It's interesting to see that people are still against bigotry, unless it's aimed at white people.<br />Those are some of the thoughts I had while reading \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\". It is definitely a worthwhile read for someone interested in human history and the dawn of civilization. Just be warned that this book is written from an extremely one-sided viewpoint, with Europeans and people of European descent not getting the credit they deserve.ld have been dismissed as a racist!

B00005O5CM|5.0|what can you review about a DVD except that it's a great movie?
B00006NSZ5|4.0|After his three solo LPs already all went multi-platinum, Eminem is going into the movie business. We already know the hype around the movie & that it was a huge release & the DVD had huge sales and all, but what about the soundtrack. It seems 8 Mile had so much musical influence that they had to release the soundtrack & a \\"More Music From...\\" album as well, the latter of the half consisting of all the old school rap used in the movie (Biggie's \\"Juicy\\", Mobb Deep's \\"Shook Ones Pt. II\\", etc.) and the earlier of which being a 16 track arsenal of new rap faces that are blowing up in the rap game. The soundtrack to 8 Mile has all the right ingredients for a classic rap soundtrack, except just a few flaws. <br />The soundtrack starts off with three of Eminem's own tracks, the mega-hit & movie theme song \\"Lose Yourself\\" jump starts this amazing soundtrack with its tight flows & impressive beat. Next, the \\"8 Mile\\" titled song is good, but i found it too long & Em's raps get tired very fast. Rounding out Em's patch of the album is \\"Run Rabbit Run\\", a freestyle type song from Em with no chorus, this song is amazing, Em raps till he can't no more, a really good song.<br />Next is the collabo of Eminem, Obie Trice, & 50 Cent on \\"Love Me\\", i didn't like this track as much as i thought i would, but its a pretty good song. Good raps from the three top rappers.<br />Following up \\"Love Me\\" are 2, that's right, 2 50 Cent tracks. \\"Places To Go\\" starts off this double-header for the \\"rapper of the moment\\", i found this an excellent song, tight flows from 50 & a killer beat, but it should've been on his album, too. Next is 50's first hit \\"Wanksta\\", this is a really good song, everything about 50's performance is amazing, the beat is incredible & 50 tears up the \\"wankstas\\" of the game. This track can also be found on 50's debut \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin'\\".<br />Next up are 2 rappers that are more than unkind to each other. Jay-Z & Nas. The good part about these 2 tracks are that neither ofthem live up to the rappers hype, so nobody's really the best or worst. Nas personally has the worst track on the album, with the vulgar & violent \\"U Wanna Be Me\\", this is the reason the album got 4 instead of 5 stars, Nas should've made a good track, not a piece of trash attempting to diss Jigga beyond belief. The Jay-Z track brings some relief to the table, but doesn't live up to anything from his \\"Blueprint\\" or \\"Blueprint 2\\" albums. <br />To wrap this up quickly, i did like the D-12 track \\"Rap Game\\", but the Young Zee track \\"That's My Ni99a For Real\\" didn't live up to what i thought it would. Addding to that, i think the Boomkat & Macy Gray songs are TOTALLY wrong for this album, considering neither have the \\"gangsta rap\\" sound accomping the rest of the soundtrack. Rakim's \\"R.A.K.I.M\\" is stellar, of course thats expected with a Rakim track, and the Obie Trice \\"Adreniline Rush\\" is great.<br />Overall, my only dissapointment was the Nas song, but the rest are good. A truly incredible rap soundtrack, maybe there will be a hint of this on Em's next album. Once again, a really good album.
B000000W6X|5.0|Massive Attack has covered so much ground, they now possess a fan base as diverse as their musical influences.  So, I only speak for myself, but this is for me the best Massive Attack album ever (with Blue Lines coming in second).  The meditative quality of the singing anchored by unobtrusive and languid hip-hop beats and string arrangements by Craig Armstrong (check out his excellent solo albums) allows the vocals of Tracey Thorn, Nicollette, and Horace Andy to come forward.  About \\"Light My Fire\\", I think it's a great track, capturing the live club system (that's where the 'Massive' in Massive Attack comes from) roots of Massive Attack/Wild Bunch.  I heard that before singing this song, Horace Andy had never heard the Doors version of Light My Fire, only Jose Feliciano's.
0786915749|4.0|Ground-breaking and highly imaginative tale.  This series is heavily reminiscent of the Dungeons and Dragons fantasy role playing game, and brings to life an epic adventure. <br />The characters are quite well developed and intriguing.  Whether it's the Wizard Raistlin or the Knight Sturm Brightblade, each character will grow on you by the end of the book.  Each character has a dark side to him/her which I found refreshing. Even though they are the heroes, they are quite reluctant.
6301562178|4.0|Steve McQueen AND Paul Newman in the SAME movie??? Need I<br />say more...That itself makes it a winner, along with a very<br />good supporting cast, and a fire that just won't quit. Architect Doug Roberts (Newman) has built the tallest building in the world. However, due to faulty wiring, a massive fire breaks out the night of a party for the building's opening.<br />I must admit though, the movie doesn't really kick in until<br />McQueen shows up on the scene, as the fire chief. Never before have I fast-<br />forwarded a movie up to the middle, but this was an exception.<br />After Newman and McQueen (two of my favorites,) Jennifer Jones and Fred Astaire are the best. They make a wonderful couple. Also starring William Holden, Faye Dunaway, Richard Chamberlin, Robert Wagner, and O.J. Simpson.

B000089RVX|4.0|I've listened to a lot of Evanescance for the past little while since I came out:  in addition to the tracks on this album, Ben's said that Evanescence have no problem with us downloading anything from older albums - just please buy the new stuff and support the band.  I've heard up to 40 MP3s, I've seen two MOVs of unplugged performances, and I've got to say that I'm impressed.  I don't think this album - let alone the two DD singles - are a good cross-section for this group, and I can't say it's a five-star album, because I KNOW the band's awesome.<br />First off, the Metal/Diva thing works really well.  I hear Ben writes 80%+ and Amy sings 80%+, which is cool;  they both do their part very well.  Lots of comparisons to Linkin Park, here, except Paul would have to be rapping completely flat in order to compare.  Sorry, but Meteora is a bit more produced and a bit less well done than HT, and, really, LP and E are not really the same genre.  <br />Ben's writing is like his playing:  head down, full steam ahead, occasionally repeating really great bits but getting there.  You know he must write with his eyes closed and his head bobbing, like a personal Mosh in moderation, counting on his fingers.  I think that Ben really writes for himself and Amy - we're just along for the ride, but I don't think it's entirely required that we be there.  Not that Ben's 'tortured' or anything;  he's just writing for the sake of writing music and to hear Amy sing, and that's got to be the best motivation I know. <br />Amy's voice?  What hasn't been already said?  She's cute as a button in her play-goth-wear, sings like a goddess, already with more talent and charm than the has-beens we call divas already:  Houston, Carey, and definitely Ms Ross, and she makes us understand why they're just has-beens whose talent peaked in front of a congregation somewhere.  Amy's got just so much power behind that voice, even one that's still young, that you know it'll make you cry in a year or two when her pipes are all growed up.  Amy:  don't smoke.<br />But the bad news:  The local radio got their hands on Bring Me To Life, and they've overplayed it so much that it's painful.  They need to find and play 'Farther Away', 'Missing', 'Even In Death' - heck, find that \\"Big Goth Anthem\\" 'Understanding', and play that - just stop overplaying the one track.  \\"Fallen\\", the album, also, isn't a good representation of the band, like I said.  It's good, yeah, but there's not the variation in tracks like we have with the MP3 library.<br />In short, you simply have to find the resources on the net.  Ben says it's cool, but just don't trade anything that's on Fallen or the Singles;  go buy those.  Listen to the MP3s, find the power of Amy's God-Given voice and Ben making some crunchy noise, watch the MOVs, especially the German \\"Going Under\\" one, and make yourself a decision.<br />Give it a listen beforehand.  Unlike most of the dreck out there, I'll almost guarantee that you will like what you get.  If you hate it, flame me and re-sell it on Amazon with my apologies;  it you like it, tell EVERYONE you know.
0783240236|3.0|It's strange that Alfred Hitchcock only directed two films in his entire career that could be termed \\"horror\\" movies, since he was quite a fearful person in real life. His diffident nature found expression far more often in the anxieties and tensions of the suspense genre, and in his own peculiar warpings of film noir such as \\"The 39 Steps,\\" \\"Rear Window,\\" \\"Vertigo,\\" and \\"Frenzy.\\" It was the psychopathologies inherent in modernism and urbanization that animated Hitchcock more than subjective states of mind (\\"Psycho\\" being, perhaps, the sole exception to this rule). Hitchcock, in other words, was a \\"clinical\\" director of anxiety: the opposite of a film like \\"The Birds\\" is not Clouzot's \\"Diabolique\\" or Polanski's \\"Chinatown,\\" but rather \\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\\" or the 1962 version of \\"Carnival of Souls.\\" <br />The remote and aloof quality of \\"The Birds\\" is in marked contrast to the Daphne du Maurier story on which it was based. Hitchcock's clinical detachment, however, stems from a widening of focus. For example, with the exception of a few key scenes (such as the one near the end where Tippi Hedren is attacked by birds in a darkened attic), \\"The Birds\\" shows people terrorized as parts of small or large groups rather than as individuals. It's collective rather than individual terror, so that whereas the mood of du Maurier's story is claustrophobic throughout, the terror in Hitchcock's film stems from collective experience in open spaces (e.g., the attack on the school children near the middle of the film, and the attack at the seaside restaurant, where entire groups are shown under blistering siege). This unfortunately dilutes the terror, even as it enlarges the cinematic canvas.<br />Of course, it was necessary for Hitchcock to expand the story, which was really no more than a novelette running about 30 pages in most editions. So he introduced padding, particularly the love interest revolving around Tippi Hedren and Rod Taylor ---- this, along with the clinicalapproach  of the film, detracts from the story's original focus and frustrates audiences who may arrive with different expectations. In this sense, we might call the movie \\"a horror film for people who hate horror films,\\" a criticism which might also be applied even more accurately to other \\"mainstream\\" horror productions like \\"The Uninvited\\" and \\"The Bad Seed.\\" <br />Not everyone will agree, of course, and they'd have some grounds for disagreement. For example, on those rare occasions when Hitchcock does vouchsafe an individual focus (e.g., Jessica Tandy entering the house of a victimized farmer, or the attic scene previously mentioned), the effect is very powerful. Unfortunately, these moments are rare, and are interspersed with so many irrelevancies and banal conversations that many viewers will find their attention wandering. <br />Having said all that, I consider \\"The Birds\\" a superior film in the horror genre, and, typically for Hitchcock, there are many things to admire on a technical level. But because of (1) the sterile  approach to the material, (2) the mostly \\"agoraphobic\\" (rather than claustrophobic) atmosphere, and (3) the gratuitious love interest, I could never rank it as a personal favorite. \\"Psycho\\" is another matter entirely, and for those looking for real intensity and undiluted focus, that is the film to watch.
B00008S2VG|2.0|...don't buy this.<br />Madonna, what happened?  You were True Blue, your baby had a Secret, and you told me a BedTime Story.  Don't Tell Me, Nobody's Perfect, but did you Take a Bow with Music?  Is this some Holiday?<br />WHAT THE HECK KIND OF DRECK IS THIS?!?<br />I almost can't listen to this.  It's hokey, it's a far cry from the kashmir of Secret, and I'm almost in pain to hear this and realize that it's those tracks that were deemed Good Enough to let out - like there could have been more, but they were WORSE!<br />How can I express how disappointed I am with this release?  I've been a faithful listener (and buyer) of Madonna albums, and not only as a Substitute for Love;  I LIKE her music, or normally I do.  I can listen to many of the albums over even though they're all worn from over-handling as they are .. that is, except for the older pre-Material-Girl days.  <br />If I close my eyes, it sounds almost like a bunch of wanna-be Madonnas, trying to cover some early B-Sides.  Maybe that's it;  maybe Madonna's lost her talent, lost her mojo, whatever, and this album is an attempt to ~sound~ like herself again, using old and unreleased lyrics from her early days, songs that suit whatever damage her voice has sustained due to some recent calamity.  Her voice is gravelly, her tones aren't even steady or pure, and she sounds like she's phoning in her performance after an all-month bender on absinthe.  This ISN'T MADONNA ! !<br />I sincerely hope that, in two years, her next album will be better.  I don't want this to be the Sound of Good-bye.  I'm so Stupid to hope so, but when all you've got left is your hope, then it's all you've got.<br />ugh.  Let's talk about something else.  Lovely weather we're having.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Unbelievable, Incredible, Phenomenal...<BR>If you are considering buying this DVD, stop thinking and buy it NOW!  And get the CD too!  My God, it's breathtaking.  <br />I had talked my parents into letting me go to a Led Zep concert in 79, and then Bonzo died.  I listened to their albums and watched Song Remains the Same at midnite shows through the long wasteland that was music in the 80s.  I bought the 10 Cd set in the 90s but didn't play them much.  Too familiar, and lots of newer bands to listen to.  But now, now my kids are going to get what I never got, LIVE LED ZEPPELIN.  And I'm finally getting it too...Thank you, Mr Page.
B00008NG5V|5.0|Jack Johnson never misses a beat on his follow-up album \\"On And On.\\" Much anticipated after his debut \\"Brushfire Fairytales,\\" the new album stays true to the slow, smooth, catchy, Bob Marley-esque, style that warmed the hearts of millions of fans.<br />Although you won't find much experimentation on this album (partly because Jack wrote many of the songs in the same period he did for Brushfire), the entire album is solid and plays nicely the entire way though. I will add that Jack has really polished his sound in the last two years, and \\"On And On\\" flows much more smoothly than Brusfire (if that's even possible!!)<br />The best thing about the new album is the fact that Jack has proved he can build a legacy of rock-solid laid-back acoustic guitar blues rock sweetened by heart-warming lyrics for years to come!<br />If you liked the first album, this one's a no-brainer. And if you haven't heard of Jack Johnson before...Where Have You Been?? Buy this CD immediately!!

B00008RH3L|5.0|The Coen Brothers' third film is a gorgeous and brilliant modern take on the classic gangster film.  A flawless cast, headed by Gabriel Byrne in his best role ever, includes Albert Finney, John Turturro, Marcia Gay Harden and Joe Polito -- even brief appearances from Steve Buscemi, Frances McDormand and Sam Raimi. Every performance is terrific, but Byrne's Tom Reagan is a revelation -- a complex loner who can take a punch and hold on to his hat.  Sets and costumes are beautiful, Barry Sonnenfeld brings considerable talent as DP, and Carter Burwell's music is haunting. This is an often forgotten or underrated film by the Brothers Coen, but don't miss it -- it presages later devices (our hero lives at the Barton Arms, for instance) and is worthwhile in its own right.<br /><br />The dvd is sparse and has no vocal input from its creators, which seems passing strange, and a shame, but you can hear the film in English, French or Spanish, with subtitles available in English or Spanish, and there is a fun 16-minute featurette called &#34;Shooting Miller's Crossing: A Conversation with Barry Sonnenfeld&#34;, really a monologue about his experience, style and philosophy, including brief storyboard-film comparisons and a hysterical revelation about the ladies' room scene. There are also 22 behind-the-scenes photos; trailers for Miller's Crossing, Barton Fink and Raising Arizona; and multiple interview soundbites from Byrne, Harden and Turturro.<br /><br />This is an ingenious genre film with twists, turns, double-crosses, great dialogue, beautiful shots and a superb cast, and it's great to have it out on dvd.  An essential film.
6305810109|5.0|The Straight story is a show that my whole family enjoyed. As a Christian family,We have tried to be choosy over the years about what our kids watch.The Straight Story is one of our favorites. It has very little bad language and nothing at all that is morally compromising. It is a great display of what family should be about and also of people helping people whenever they can. Our three teenage sons enjoyed it as much as my husband and I did. It is nice to find an entertaining film that does not rely on special effects, violence, or sexually compromising situations to keep it interesting. I highly recommend it for everyone.
B00004TRD8|4.0|Last night I watched the hidden version included in the Ultimate Edition of Terminator 2, and its always interesting watching the deleted scenes, and seeing what versions of the movie have what extra features. Now let me get this straight. According to the ultimate alternative ending, Judgement Day did not happen, as the future is not set, and John Connors went on to become a Congressman, instead of a leader of the resistance. So Sarah Connors spends half of her adult life smuggling guns, blowing things up, assasinating people, and being locked away in a psycho ward for telling people that machines from the future were sent to kill her and her son John. We won't even touch the millions of dollars worth of damage she caused to property. Yet, here she is 30 years later, walking around free as a bird. And even though these things she said would happen did not happen, she is still seen as a hero, and not a nutcase, and she runs around like a nutcase telling everyone that each day is a gift. A gift from whom? Since the future is not set, and assuming here that God has nothing to say about this, the gift must largely come from Sarah. Its just a moviem, and perhaps we don't really want to go in this direction. Maybe it was a good idea that this alternate ending was never used.<br />This Ultimate Edition of the second Terminator movie is one of the three best movies I have for sound. I have a Pioneer Elite sound system with 5.1, B & W speakers, and a Panasonic HD TV. My system rocks. Therefore, when a new edition was offered with better sound and picture, I was interested. I can say that my setup can tell the difference between very good and very, very good. And as very good as the Ultimate Edition is, the Extreme Edition is even better. If someone wants to buy my Ultimate Edition dvd, I will be happy to sell it to them, and I will be more than happy to keep my Extreme edition.
0380733358|4.0|This spy story is really thrilling. \\"The Needle\\" is a German spy in Great Britain during World War 2. Many times he's nearly caught by the British, but because of his cleverness he always finds a way to escape. Sometimes you forget he's a killer, a Nazi.<BR>Follet knows how to produce tension. A spy is never safe and everybody can be an emeny.<BR>Follett barely shows the human sides of this spy. But \\"the Needle\\" not infailable, the end shows it very clearly.
B0000631L9|5.0|<br />I downloaded the original release of this CD and liked every song. This being the case, it was far more than justifyable to spend the money. I figured as long as I'm buying, I may as well get some bonus stuff out of it.<br /><br />I think this import version was worth the few extra bucks.<br /><br />The features are:<BR>The original album<BR>Two bonus tracks in MP3 format at 128kbps<BR>Multiple wallpapers in various resolutions<BR>Two screensavers<BR>Four MPG format videos<br /><br />I would have liked a slightly higher bitrate on the MP3 tracks and a couple of the videos had less than pristine quality in places, but overall I can't hold that against this disc.<br /><br />The album is a fast paced punk rock fest, with the exception of &quot;Find Yourself Another Girl&quot;. This song has a slow pace and a feel that makes me think of the early days of rock. It is the odd track out on this disc, but I still enjoy the song.<br /><br />The packaging is the cardboard fold out type, of which I am not too fond. The booklet is very basic and consists of little more than the lyrics, which are quite handy considering the pace of the singing in most songs. (The original release has a play time under 30 minutes for 12 tracks)<br /><br />If you've heard &quot;Hate to Say I Told you so&quot; and liked it, this CD is a safe bet for you. All the songs, save one (see above) have the same rockin' vibe to them. Good stuff. I eagerly await their next release, and hope it lives up to this one.
0226264211|3.0|The book starts out with the premise that economic freedom is a prerequisite to all other forms of freedom (civil, political). However, the bulk of the remaning text is a topic-by-topic accounting of how government intervention in various industries has been a poor choice. Unfortunately, Friedman doesn't come back to the central theme often enough to tie it all together.<br />It is still worth reading as a libertarian enconomic position statement, but it never develops it's central idea as fully as I felt it could have done.<br />Both Friedman's &quot;Free to Choose&quot; and Hayek &quot;Road to Serfdom&quot; do a better job of explaing the 'why' behind the necessity of economic freedoms.
0131103628|5.0|i was in several programming language classes and i was drowning in confusing programming books.  this book stopped the panic, calmed my mind, and let me see the creativity of programming.  it is an astounding simple book about c programming, but maybe not a starter programming book or the last book to pick up on programming. but i would suggest squeezing it into your reading list at some point.
B00005OAIE|4.0|First I should say that I really like this disk. I play it constantly, and there are many subtle things about his style that sort of creeps up on you at unsuspecting moments.  I found that, depending on my mood, a tune of his would suddenly &quot;register&quot; in my head, making total sense, and I'll be right there alongside him. That's not to say that it didn't leave me wanting a little more.  I think acoustic rock is at its best when paired with some other natural instruments (brass, etc), and I often found myself wanting to fill in some of the &quot;gaps&quot; in the music as it played. &quot;3x5&quot;, one of my favorites, is a case in point..it seemed like it was riding the edge. I kept wanting the song to explode into something amazing and furious in the end. Well, perhaps the charm is in its &quot;edginess&quot;. Still a great song though.<BR>Overall, I believe that John is a gifted artist who is merely at the beginning of potentially wonderful career, and I suspect that he will explore many directions, possibly picking up some other talented musicians to collaborate with. If your into bands like Fallen from Grace, Dave Matthews, and Davig Gray, then I recommend this highly.
B0000214F0|5.0|I feel slightly embarrassed to tell people how much I love this film, you should see the looks I get! But this film is the guiltiest pleasure there is. Is it porn? No, it isn't. When you have that urge to view porn, Caligula is not the first film you rent......too much plot. It has many hardcore sex scenes, but this was all part of an enormous failed experiment: To bring porn scenes to legitimate film. It didn't work, this film is a disaster. But because of this, the film is very entertaining. The first time you see it you won't believe what you're watching. You'll be asking yourself, \\"How?\\", \\"Why?\\", etc. Regardless if you love it or hate it, you'll sit through the entire two and and half hours of it just out of morbid curiosity and bewilderment. The same impulse that makes you slow down as you drive past an accident on the highway. I'm not quite sure what Gore Vidal was thinking here; Wouldn't you think that if you got Bob Guccione and Tinto Brass involved in your film that it would be overflowing with sleaze? Gore can't be that dumb! In the documentary it's hilarious to watch him talk about the historical and philosophical importance of the movie. I bet he feels like a total schmuck and totally ashamed now when he thinks back on that. I'd love to ask him about it. The film tries to be accurate and take itself seriously as a drama, but lets cut through ... here; Guccione was merely using this as a way to push his sleaze into the mainstream and become an \\"innovative genius\\" in the public's eye. The sex scenes are very sleazy and disgusting because they're usually sandwiched between(or during) scenes of graphic violence, making them devoid of any kind of erotic value. I love showing or lending this movie to unsuspecting friends, coworkers, family, just to get their reaction. There will never be another movie like Caligula....ever. See it once and remember it for the rest of your days. A warning though: Don't watch on a first date, she won't be impressed.
B00005JKN9|5.0|Perhaps it was inevitable that Gangs Of New York would recieve such a cold shoulder from critics, the Academy, and the viewing public.  Every time Martin Scorsese has presented us with one of his greatest, most personal films, he has been shot down, his vision dismissed as hogwash, only to be accepted as a great film years later.<br />Case in point: Raging Bull was widely panned by many upon its first release, and Scorsese was passed over for Robert Redford's Ordinary People, a good but far inferior film.  Raging Bull is now recognized as one of the greatest of all American films.  When Scorsese released his most personal film, The Last Temptation Of Christ, it was met with controversy and disdain.  Again he was passed over come award time, and now his Jesus bio is seen as one of the greatest films to tackle the subject of Jesus Christ.<br />I felt that Gnags Of New York was a fantastic film, and upon seeing it, I walked out of the theatre feeling that I had seen a film that would immediately be accepted as one of Scorsese's greatest films.  How wrong I was.<br />Yet I don't understand the cold shoulder in this case, because there is so much to like about Gangs Of New York.  We've all said great things about the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis, but his great performance overshadowed Leonardo DiCaprio's, which wasn't all that bad.  I personally think we all need to get over Titanic; this kid can act.  Cameron Diaz is fine in her role; note the scene in which she and DiCaprio discuss her abortion.  She shows that she is just as good a dramatic as she is a comic actress.<br />The costume design and art direction is impeccable.  Scorsese and his crew perfectly captured the New York of the Civil War era.  Reviewers have argued that New York couldn't look that bad.  As a history student, I can assure you that it did.<br />Finally, no one has seemed to notice that Scorsese has made a picture that combines the greatest of his influences.  Gangs Of New York captures the best of Italian neorealism and grand classic Hollywood spectacle.  In combining the two, he has made what may be his greatest film: a melding of De Sica and Fellini, John Huston and D.W. Griffith, into a style that is uniquely Scorseseian.  Gangs Of New York rushes along in its two hour, 45 minute running time.  Never once did I find it boring or slow moving.<br />So to those who have said it is a bad picture, I pose this challenge: How would you change it?  I've heard lots of criticism but few solutions.  Perhaps there are so few solutions because Scorsese has made a picture so perfect that it is impossible for many of us to comprehend its depth.st of Italian neorealism and grand classic Hollywood spectacle.

B00008GKEG|5.0|This is a follow up review, as I just finished my review of Ringorama, and it reminded me of the saddest part of the anthology collection, in which there are many obviously sad parts....<br />When you watch disc 5, when the boys are together, and you can see Sir Paul still can't prevent himself from dominating everyone, (not because he's bad, but because he never realized it was happening) there is a short comment by Ring when he says he likes hanging out with them.....<br />Ringo was always the base upon which the Beatles rotated, although I'm sure they never realized it, especially with all their talent, it would be hard to see how this simple, beautiful man could be the center of the Beatle Universe, but it was always the simple and willing Ringo that allowed the others to shine so brightly...<br />Well, watch that short comment someday with this in mind:<br />Here was the one person in the whole universe who was allowed into the greatest ride in musical history, who was enjoying it as much as the audience...Ringo was a fan of the Beatles as much as we were, and much more than John, Paul and George, who WERE the Beatles...who provided the songs and the personalities and lived in that horrible spotlight, and eventually suffered from it....<br />Steady old Ringo, he was like us, watching what was happening to his friends, powerless to help them, but sheilded from the creative demands and ego that accompanies it....no less than any of the others, and just as important because he was the base from which the others sprang...in some ways an impossible job of ducking the fights and the siding with one or the other, but loving this gift given him by the Good Lord.....to be a Beatle....<br />So watch Ring tell them, for all of us, that he liked hanging out with them, and then dry your eyes, and know that at least one Beatle knows your saddness, and carries it much deeper, and much harder than any of us......<br />God Bless you Ring, you were one of us, too
B000063DI9|5.0|After the release of the experimental \\"Somewhere in Time,\\" which remains as my personal favorite, Maiden moved forward into even more progressive rock territory.  This album also marked the last of the \\"classic lineup,\\" as guitarist Adrian Smith would depart for a different band.  When it comes to Maiden's albums, fans usually label this as the best from the band, and while I really can't claim their all-time best (note: when I say \\"my favorite,\\" it doesn't mean their best, just the one that pleases me the most), this 1988 milestone might deserve that statement.<br />By far, this is Maiden and their most sophisticated.  The songs are long throughout and employ synthesizers (in the special features on the CD, Steve Harris claimed they were guitar synthesizers, NOT keyboards) and complicated structures.  Here's the lowdown:<br />Moonchild - GREAT OPENING TRACK.  Starts off ominously and then bursts into a full-throttle rocker.  A winner!<br />Infinite Dreams - At first, I didn't like this one, but its progressive mood and awesome lyrics make this one a definite Maiden classic.<br />Can I Play With Madness - Many fans claim this one's \\"overrated.\\"  If anything, I think it's underrated; a great song with Bruce's vocals in fine form.  The guitars really hooked me when I first heard this.<br />The Evil That Men Do - One of my favorites!  The solo by Adrian Smith is superb and, while the chorus is a little weak, the verses are top-notch.<br />Seventh Son of a Seventh Son - the title track and monster epic of a son.  Very complicated song with guitars weaving in and out a 9-minute tale.<br />The Prophecy - I would probably say it's the weakest on the album, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.<br />The Clairvoyant - THE BEST SONG ON THIS ALBUM.  WOW.  This song is simply brilliant from start to finish and Steve Harris pulls one hell of a bassline.  The chorus is also very memorable and the lyrics are simply amazing.<br />Only the Good Die Young - Very progressive feel to it.  Not a bad track, but doesn't really stand out as much as the others.<br />Every song seems to flow together into one cohesive whole, and I can't think of any other Maiden album that does that (\\"Somewhere in Time\\" does somewhat, but not nearly as much as this album does.).<br />If you're the first-time Maiden listener, this album is a good bet.  It's a little harder at first to accept this because it's the MOST progressive of their albums.  However, it's still Maiden at the core and a more-than-worthy entry into Maiden's legendary legacy.  I first listened to \\"Powerslave\\" myself and this took a lot to grow on me before I enjoyed it and became an Iron Maiden fan.<br />It's a shame that many fans claimed this was a \\"sell-out\\" album.  PEOPLE, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE MISSING HERE.  This is still Maiden at heart and one of their best.  Rush also seems to get the \\"sell-out\\" bashing as well, even though they, too, took synthesizers and UTILIZED THEM WELL, unlike most bands during the 80s.<br />Overall, THIS IS A MUST-HAVE FOR THE MAIDEN FAN.  A brilliantly conceived album and the last to feature the classic lineup.  It's much softer than most Maiden albums, but people... this is an essential piece to Maiden's history and a solid album.

B00008OWZC|5.0|If you're looking at this CD, you already know how great Led Zeppelin was as a band, so I won't restate the obvious.<br />I will, however, say:  This is, hands-down, the rock album of the year.  Any band making new music today will be hard-pressed to top the energy and intensity of this album -- not to mention the songwriting and sound quality.  You will forget that these shows were recorded in the 1970s and not earlier this week.<br />From the over-25-minute version of \\"Dazed And Confused\\" to the nearly 10-minute drum solo in the middle of \\"Moby Dick\\" to the random covers thrown in the middle of \\"Whole Lotta Love\\", you will find yourself falling head-over-heels in love with Led Zeppelin all over again.  This live set is as essential as any of their studio records, and perhaps even more so.
0790729725|4.0|Whoever doesn't love this movie has absolutely no taste in movies and they should go back to watching disney movies. This is one of the greatest mob movies of all time and it stands tall next to godfather 1 and 2 in quality and originality. Anyone who gives the film a one star review makes me sick. I agree, it is a pain to get up and flip the DVD in the middle of the movie, and the sound isn't great, but overall just having this spectacular movie in your dvd collection makes up for this error. 5 stars for the movie, and 3 for the DVD, (even though it really should be a 0). It would be a good idea to rerelease this movie on one DVD with special features.
0375823360|5.0|First thing I'd like to say:  people who talk about this book having no character development are wrong, I believe.  Philip Pullman depicts his characters in such a subtle way that you become attached to them without having to read through their life stories.  You can take so much out of their actions and dialogue.  The absence of sap in this trilogy blows me over.<br />Nothing has affected me so profoundly before.  It was this trilogy that inspired me to write my own.  My views are completely altered- and I hope they never change back.  It is like seeing the world through new eyes.  You start looking at things differently, wondering how you ever could have been so shallow and ignorant.  <br />I've recommended these books to many of my friends, but judging from their responses, they are truly not for everyone.  People have different preferences, of course, but I don't see how you could just drop any of these books without knowing what happens.  The plot reels you and and keeps you there, close to the end, but never quite reaching it.  Even at the Amber Spyglass, there are questions unanswered, and I think that is part of the majesty of it all.  Pullman doesn't tell you how to think, he presents each idea in the same way, lets you decide what to believe.  <br />These books had me thinking and feeling differently than I ever have before.  A period of depression I've never known crept up on me after the conclusion, keeping me awake at night, hoarding my attention during the day.  One morning, however, I woke up and realized it was okay to feel the way I was feeling.  That day I noticed the smallest things, thought more about life in general than was normal.  Now, this is a regular occurence.<br />These books leave me with a sense of beautiful sadness every time I read them.  It takes something powerful to send chills up my spine.  After reading His Dark Materials, I am grateful that I don't have nerve damage.  What else is there to say?  Read them, if you think they'reyour kind of books.  Don't shun them because they are classified as children's fantasy.  And please don't compare them to Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings.  These are wonderful books in their own ways, as are His Dark Materials.  As I am reading The Golden Compass, or The Subtle Knife, or The Amber Spyglass, I'm not thinking about Hogwarts or the Shire.  There's not enough room left in my mind for them.  You wouldn't think a thirteen-year-old could think in this way, but they most surely can.
B000069AUI|5.0|There were so cool at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View! No idea 20,000+ people would show up and have the same music taste that night.  They sound just like their album, so you won't be disappointed! So if you ever get to see Coldplay in an outside concert...kick back on the lawn, sit on your blankets with friends/lover, and sway or sing along! (Oh and don't hope you'll get a glimpse of Gwyneth)
0156421178|4.0|In addition to being a book about the experience of an infantry man in the Spanish Civil War, this is also a book about the nature of politics and political parties. Orwell doesn't hold anything back when he discusses his disgust at the Fascist party of Franco, as well as the fabricated lies of the Communist press, and the ignorance of the French and English media. His political analysis is quite intriguing in that it provides the reader with an historical context in which to examine the key players who would be involved in another conflict only a couple years later. The Spanish Civil War serves as an exciting background to the Second World War which is right around the corner.<br />This is a vivid account of the life of a soldier. Orwell doesn't over dramatize situations; rather he tends to maintain a realistic style throughout this work. In addition, Orwell successfully intertwines humor with suspense as he recounts his brushes with death. In this book, Orwell examines the moral and physical experience of a man at war. His literary style resembles that of Remarque in his book All Quiet on the Western Front. Writing an engaging account from the first person point of view makes the account more authentic.
B000001Y79|5.0|There isn't one song on this CD that I can't identify with all the time.  I absolutely L-O-V-E this CD.  It made me a No Doubt fan for the rest of my life, not to mention lead me to purchase thier others as well.<br />The beats on these songs are mezmerising, the vocals - outstanding.  I love the singles released, but the other tracks are just as good, if not better.  If you don't own this, you should.
B000002AVF|5.0|Back in 1995 when music was becoming a very large part of my life, I was tuning into VH1 where they usually played the mainstream artists and saw &quot;Fantasy&quot; come on.  This very fun, upbeat song featuring a sample of music used in the Tom Tom Club's hit &quot;Genius of Love&quot; - along with the beautiful Mariah Carey and her attractive voice made me go out and buy her Daydream album.  Daydream is my most favorite CD out of the 11 Mariah Carey albums I own.  This is Mariah at her best.<br />1. Fantasy : 10/10* - Very upbeat, very fun, the best song on Daydream.<BR>2. Underneath The Starts : 10/10* - A beautiful, sweet, soft ballad.  This is a very good song.<BR>3. One Sweet Day (with Boys II Men) : 10/10* - Probably the best song on Daydream.  Mariah Carey and Boys II Men sing the most beautiful, wrenching duet ever in music.  This song is just so beautiful and meaningful - there is no way anyone could deny the power of this song.<BR>4. Open Arms : 10/10 - A cover of Steve Perry's hit, Mariah shows that she can also take someone else's song and spread the beauty of it through her beautiful voice, also making it her own song.<BR>5. Always Be My Baby : 10/10* - A beautiful, upbeat love ballad.  The music video made for this song is the best one representing Daydream and is the best music video Mariah Carey's ever released.  This is one of the best songs on this album.<BR>6. I Am Free : 8/10 - A beautiful song with stronger R&amp;B rhythm in it.<BR>7. When I Saw You : 10/10* - A beautiful ballad - love at first sight.<BR>8. Long Ago : 9/10* - Moving into a stronger R&amp;B rhythm, this mesmorizing song is one of the better songs on Daydream.<BR>9. Melt Away : 10/10* - Sort of like a love at first sight song, it's more of a head-over-heels in love song.  This is the sister song of &quot;When I Saw You&quot;. =)<BR>10. Forever : 10/10* - A semi-upbeat song with strong R&amp;B rhythm.  This song is also one of the better songs on Daydream - the sister song of Long Ago.<BR>11. Fantasy (Interlude) : 8/10 - Very long interlude.. the length of a regular song.  One of the better interludes I've heard Mariah do.<BR>12. Looking In : 9/10 - A nicely done emotional song.  But not one of my favorites on Daydream.<br />* Means that this particular song is one of my more favorite songs on this album.<br />The fun and beauty of Daydream has led me to discover the unbelievable singing talent of Mariah Carey.  Out of the hundreds of singers and bands I've heard over the years that I've been listening to music, Mariah Carey tops them all with her powerful, beautiful voice and her unique songs.

B000002BQK|5.0|Butterfly, one of Mariah Carey's many releases is probably in my top 3 favorites of all of Mariah's released albums.  I'd have to say, I was so glad I bought this album.  Mariah finally breaks away from her old image and into a new one.  She does great work.  Here are my ratings for all of the songs on Butterfly.<br />1. Honey : 10/10* - Fun and upbeat.<BR>2. Butterfly : 10/10* - A beautiful ballad.<BR>3. My All : 10/10 - Another beautiful, sad ballad.<BR>4. The Roof : 8/10<BR>5. Fourth Of July : 10/10* - A beautiful love ballad.<BR>6. Breakdown : 10/10*<BR>7. Babydoll : 9/10<BR>8. Close My Eyes : 10/10*<BR>9. Whenever You Call: 10/10* - A very beautiful ballad.<BR>10. Fly Away (Butterfly Reprise) : 9/10<BR>11. The Beautiful Ones : 8/10<BR>12. Outside : 9/10<br />* Means that this particular song is one of my more favorite songs on this album.<br />I also left notes on the songs that I felt needed to be acknowledged.<br />Mariah's talents shine on Butterfly.  This is a must-have for any Mariah fan's collection.  Her beautiful voice and these flawless songs.
B00005AR3G|4.0|This movie almost never made it to the theater.  After scrapping and redoing the entire storyline and much of the animation, it was salvaged by two directors at Disney who gave it a much lighter touch and less serious approach then was originally envisioned.  Spade and Goodman are great voice talents and the movie is endearing, but certianly doesn't stand out like Lion King or Alladin.  The story revolves around Spade's character, a young South American Emperor who is spoiled beyond belief.  He informs Goodmans character, a local farmer that he'll have to move his small house and farm to make room for his new Jacuzzi house.  The tides turn when the Emporer's aide accidently changes him into a Llama (instead of poisoning him).  He is forced to get help from the farmer who he almost evicted.  I recommend this movie with 4 stars.  It's entertaining and has good lessons for kids about treating people equally and in a manner in which you want to be treated.
B00003CXAE|5.0|Probably the greatest musical of all time, Grease (starring Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta) shows us the fun of its generation.  With the acting, the story, and the flawless music featured in Grease, it's no wonder why it has gotten such critical acclaim.<br />When Danny Zuko (Travolta) and Sandy Olsen (Newton-John) fall in love over the summer, Sandy delivers the news that she'd be leaving back to her home in Australia.  But as the new year at Rydell begins, Sandy has a change of plans and stays in the U.S.  Once re-united with Danny (thanks to Rizzo, played by Stockard Channing), Sandy is delighted to once again see Danny, and Danny is just as overwhelmed.  But he believes that his masculinity and his leadership is being questioned when he has trouble expressing his love for Sandy in front of the T-Birds and the Pink Ladies, so he decides to play it cool - which would end up in Sandy becoming confused and seeing Danny in a different way, yet she remains in love with him.  But eventually, things do work out between Sandy, Danny, the Pink Ladies, and the T-Birds - this movie is packed with great acting, not to mention the great songs featured in it.<br />Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta shocked viewers everywhere when they broke out into song.  Catchy songs such as &quot;Greased Lightning&quot; (sung by John Travolta), &quot;Summer Nights&quot; (sung by Olivia and John), and &quot;You're The One That I Want&quot; (sung by Olivia and John) - which is the signature song of the movie, became instant national hits.  Olivia's solo song &quot;Hopelessly Devoted To You&quot; shows how much of an angel she is, pouring out her sweet voice to beautiful lyrics.<br />This movie was well excecuted.  It's a legend of its own time.  This is a must-see, and of course, a must-have for any lover of great movies.
B00003CXB4|5.0|Obviously one of Disney's greatest animated films was not to be taken lightly when released on DVD.  This movie is a specticle of story, animation and music.  Heart wrenching, glorious, terrifying and fun this movie can get under the skin of anyone.  I won't rehash the story, because most everyone knows it.  In short, it's about growing up and taking responsibility for what you are responsible for.  Maturing angst and hard decisions make this a suitable parable for adults as well as children.    The animation is superb, the voices well cast.  There are intense moments and some violence but it's vital to the story.  Highly, highly recommended.
B000002A46|5.0|With the 1994 release Merry Christmas, Mariah wows us with the sound of holiday and pop.  Featuring the hits &quot;All I Want For Christmas Is You&quot;, &quot;Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)&quot;, and &quot;Miss You Most (At Christmas Time)&quot;, Mariah delivers a classic.  While other Christmas version CDs wouldn't grab much attention, Mariah's voice and the sound of Pop in these Christmas song remakes make this album a winner.<br />1. Silent Night - (4/5) - A more religous sound approach, but Mariah doesn't go all out.<br />2. All I Want For Christmas Is You - (5/5) - A fun, holiday pop song that can lighten anyone's mood.  Really upbeat.<br />3. O Holy Night - (5/5) - Mariah makes this song beautiful the way she delivers it.  (This song sort of sounds like her upcoming release &quot;Forever&quot;).<br />4. Christmas (Baby Please Come Home) - (5/5) - A semi-upbeat song, taking a more classical approach. <br />5. Miss You Most (At Christmas Time) - (5/5) - This is my favorite song on this album.  This is a sad, very emotional ballad that only Mariah could deliver.<br />6. Joy To The World - (5/5) - A true, upbeat gospel version of the song.<br />7. Jesus Born on This Day - (5/5) - Another beautiful song, and it gets even better with the choir of children.<br />8. Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town - (5/5) - A very upbeat cover of the classical song.  The sister song of &quot;All I Want For Christmas Is You&quot;.<br />9. Hark! The Herald Angels Sing/Gloria (In Excelsis Deo) - (5/5) - A beautiful, more classical approach of the song.  This song is done beautifully by Mariah and the choir.<br />10. Jesus Oh What A Wonderful Child - (5/5) - A gospel/classical/very poppy song.  This song is nicely done by Mariah.<br />This is one truely great Christmas album - I recommend Merry Christmas to any lover of great Christmas music.
B00005JL96|5.0|Lilo and Stitch is a great, great movie.  It harkens back to a simpler storyline about family, and suprisingly for a Disney movie, it's about a dysfunctional family.  An older sister tries, with great dismay, to raise her little sister (Lilo) after their parents die in a car accident.  It proves extremely difficult with the young girls outlandish behavior and rebelious attitude.  She's not a bad kid, but it's obvious she is acting this way because she isn't sure how to handle her parents death.  Her sister tries everything from rewards to tough love.  Nothing works and the local family services agent, Cobra Bubbles (a great character voiced by Ving Rhames) threatens to take her away.  Enter Stitch, a geneticlly engineered exterrestrial who, after wreaking great havoc, finds behavior beyond his genetic programming.  He discovers he wants what Lilo wants; a family, even if its broken.  Stitch's chaotic/intelligent/detructive and benign behavior leads to several funny moments and lends to a character development that is unexpected from something so hilariously vicious.  This movie is highly recommended.  It's great fun, and it will tug at the emotions in a good way.    ***update***  I just read a review by what seemed to be an irrate parent about the violence in this movie.  Please note the rateing; PG.  Yes, there is some violence, DUH!  The movie is about a destructive alien that escapes his captors.  It's necessary to show this character trait so you can see his transition to a gentler being when he discovers he wants to be part of something, most notably a family.  This 'irrate parent' needs to look closely at what his kids are watching.  There is a reason for the PG rating and quite frankly, it's really not for children under the age of four or five...that's why it's PG.  Which stands for PARENTAL GUIDANCE, meaning the PARENT needs to guide their child to this movie, through it, or away from it.  The makers of the movie & the MPAA did their job by giving it the rating, now you as a parent have to do your job.

B00008O0WN|1.0|The Remans - a race that has built the ultimate weapon - a biogenic device so dangerous that it destroys life instantly - decided to position it 15 feet behind the captain's chair on the enemy ship with no guards, force fields or shielding?  You're telling me that all one has to do is walk on the bridge and shoot the weapon with a phaser and you'll blow up the ship?  This movie is so full of stupidity that it makes Star Trek V look like Citizen Kane.  The writers are ruining this franchise.  Chimpanzees wrote a script for the most intelligent fan base in the world.
B000002GYG|5.0|You will not hear these songs done this way live today, this is early vintage stuff that is really untouchable by any nightclub singer. If you were lucky enough to catch the young Waits live  in a small club in the 70s you saw the best. If not, buy this, turn down the lights, pour a tall one and enjoy.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I am a Lord of The Rings amateur fanatic. I became so, when I saw the first Movie: The Fellowship of the Ring. Afterwards I read the book. Anyway, I bought The Extended Edition, and the story was much more complete, eventough only 30Mins were added. The characters were much realised, and if you are a person who didn't read the book yet, you will understand much more the roles the characters play. Well I was super satisfied with the first Extended Edition, that I'm sure I will buy The Two Towers and The Return of The King Extended Edition. It's A MUST SEE
0790729342|2.0|We all know it's a great film, so no need to comment on that. The DVD is terrible. The film and sound quality are barely better than VHS, it is presented in fullscreen format which reduces the brilliance of the cinematography, and there are no decent special features to speak of. If you really feel the urge to see it, rent it, and wait for the special edition which I'm sure will come out eventually. If the MadMax special edition is any indicator, it should be a great SE DVD.
0066214122|4.0|Michael Crichton has proved to me over and over again that he can crank up the suspense and really get me interested in a story-- Prey held true to this throughout the entire time I was reading it.<br />Told in the first person, Prey was definitely a departure from how Crichton normally writes; usually he writes in the third person, jumping from character to character and giving insights into their perspectives, feelings, and actions.  This time round, though, he stays with good old Jack Forman, a devoted family man.  Although quite a large chunk of the story is wasted on events that happen at Jacks home [hence the 4 stars], they eventually help explain things that happen later on in the story.  As the plot moves along, you are carted along with Jack (who is desperate for a job) to the desert where he finds that the job he was offered isnt as great as he was hoping (he didnt plan on his life being in danger, after all).  The plot moves along quickly, and as it progresses the tension increases page by page.<br />Although this is not my favorite Crichton novel, it still was quite a ride and I really enjoyed reading it.  For anyone who is looking to introduce themselves to Crichtons work, this is not the book to start with [try Jurassic Park or Sphere].
B000089CJI|5.0|My friend told me about these guys about a week ago, and since then, I haven't stopped playing them.  I haven't heard much like this before, but I do love it.  Even if you don't like the beats, get the CD simply for the lyrics.<br />Background info: Singer [Ben Gibbard - DCFC] and DJ [Jimmy Tamborello - Dntel].  Named &quot;The Postal Service&quot; because they communicated by mail.<BR>Best song: The District Sleeps Alone Tonight<BR>Lyrics: 5 out of 5<BR>Beats: 4 out of 5<BR>Sounds like: a warped version of Radiohead<br />Definately add this to your collection if you like variety, or any kind of techno/electronica stuff (or, if not, if you're looking for great lyrics and can tune out the music).  Plus, as an added benefit, you can always play it to make your parents and people on the street think you're strange... :)<br />Overall: 5 out of 5
6305508550|5.0|Is it just me, or is this one of the funniest movies on the planet?  I absolutely love Office Space-- it just gives you that warm and fuzzy feeling inside every time you watch it.  <br />I think the main reason why it is so funny is that the characters are completely the opposite of the stereotypical \\"office nerd\\" who works in a cubicle every day and has no life or sense of humor (much less friends...)  Also, I love how they listen to rap music-- the usage of the rap throughout the movie, again, is against the stereotype (light jazz, anyone?).<br />Another aspect of the film that is hilarious is how the situation is perfect for the main character to be defiant to his superiors.  The plot is set up so perfectly that you just can't help thinking during moments of brilliance \\"this is so awesome!\\" like when he's gutting the fish on his desk or parking in his boss's parking space.  <br />It's these little details and things that really make you laugh the hardest-- I am so glad I rented this movie-- check it out as soon as possible!
B00008O0WN|5.0|I'm a Star Trek Fan, from Belgium. I've bought this DVD, and had already watch it on theaters, and i can tell you it's the best Trekkie movie ever made. Too bad something very sad happens in the end. Otherwise, the movie rocks and you can only be angry against the editor for cutting too much scenes in the movie.
B000063S6Z|5.0|18 by Moby is already a classic amongst my other electronica albums.  At least one of Moby's CDs will always be on my \\"top 10 favorite CDs\\" list, simply because his work spans over so many genres (although he does some better than others).<br />18 and his other album Play seem to represent human emotion really well.  He somehow taps into your mind and evokes whatever memories of that particular emotion the song represents.  It's weird to think of now, but over and over again it has proved to be true.  <br />The songs and lyrics on 18 are well written, and the vocals are very good. My favorite song on 18 would definitely have to be \\"In This World\\".  The vocals are spot on perfect, and the piano and strings in the background are beautiful; they work together like...like...sugar with more sugar.  And chocolate.  And other reallly tasty things.
0385504209|5.0|This book is incredibly well researched and is filled with fascinating theories and facts.  In the genre of &quot;Gulliver's Travels,&quot; The DaVinci Code raises issues that have been ignored by mainstream Christianity for centuries.  If you have any interest the true relationship between Mary Magdalene and Jesus, you're going to love this book.
B000059MEK|4.0|The album first four, or five counting Crescendolls if you don't mind the repetitiveness (a bit much) are very solid, can keep you feet or mind from moving tracks. Somewhere after that though it falls into subpar tracks, just too much tricking out on one not-so good groove or beat until you get to Face to Face which, despite what some reviewers said, isn't all that bad. The vocals, both male and female work, the song works. So six, maybe seven tracks work, the other are okay as background music. So, you're thinking, &quot;he gave it four stars when he only liked half the disc?&quot; Exactly, because those six or seven tracks that do succeed, especially four of them, are worth the price of the album. Heck, the breakdown on Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger with the pitch keys is worth the album, great tune. Buy it, try it, you'll like (most) of it.
B00005V3Z4|2.0|I believe the directors and writers of this movie intended for it to be complex, but rather than this, they made it an unorganized collection of clips and dialog just to fit into a two hour time limit.  Nothing was portrayed the way it was intended to be portrayed. Many characters including Drew Barrymore's were underdeveloped, and when events took place in their lives, there was no impact to the viewer because of this.  The impactfulness of every event in this movie is dwindled down to a bead because of the lack of development.  It seems the producers wanted to impress completely different groups of audiences, one teenagers, the other, the oddballs of the world.  Due to the lack of structure to the movie, all of us oddballs were disappointed, especially with certain mediocre scenes of some characters using out of place profanity and subject content, when this time could have been targeted to character development and relationships.  Far from complex and brilliant scenes. The teenage crowd was unimpressed by this sloppy attempt at teenage relation.  Many of the deleted scenes were vital, and needed to be included in the movie in order for the viewer to feel and understand the whole concept of it. But the movie was inventive, and had some note worthy parts to it. Sadly, this was just the stories topics, original they were, but not done justice.  The only thing that gave it's mystical complex beauty was the music, which sets the viewer off into a journey into the stars.  To anyone, I would suggest buying just the album, which is excellent, the score is the only thing that saved this movie from being lousy, and providing it with a certain brilliance I was expecting.  The movie was certainly short of being brilliant.
B000089RVX|5.0|Much has been made of Fallen, the first mainstream for Evanescence.<br />I have followed this band for some time now, through Origin and their EPs.<br />I write this not to add to the wonderful words which have already been mentioned about Fallen - but rather to make a recommendation. There are some extremely rare demos which will hopefully be making an appearance in an album called &quot;Not For Your Ears&quot;. <br />While My Immortal and Hello pierce the soul, a track on there called &quot;You&quot; - a personal song from Amy to Ben will captivate, enchant and delight you, and leave your soul yearning for more - something which only the angelic vocals of Amy can fulfill.
B0000041Q3|5.0|This is the best Turandot in the catalog that I have heard.<br />The are numerous reasons that for that...the singers, Zubin Mehta, the orchestra, and the spectacular sound of the recording.<br />First, the singers - Sutherland, Caballe, and Pavarotti.<BR>Joan Sutherland has one of the most beautiful voice in the world at the time of this recording. She has an amazing range that goes all the way to the G above high C. It is a huge voice that is almost the size of a Wagnerian dramatic soprano with the warmth of a spinto. The diva's gorgeous tone is world famous as well as her percision and technique. True, she has never sang the role on stage. But in the recording studio she is ideal for Turandot. <br />Puccini wrote the role for a Italian train type of soprano known as a spinto soprano. Spinto sopranos typically have soaring large voices that are warm and smooth in tone. True, the role of Turandot calls for a unusual type of spinto soprano that borders on a dramatic soprano. but He certainly didn't write it for a Wagnerian(German)dramatic soprano because he wanted a rich &quot;Italian&quot; sound for Turandot. <br />This rules out Nilsson, she is too cold and edgy for Turandot. Sutherland, on the other hand, is pure velvet. Her top notes are world known for their power and accuracy, and she is at her best here. The extremely high tessitura poses absolutely no challenge for her. And unlike Nilsson who uses basically one volume(forte to fortissimo) and no emotions(she is dead cold), Sutherland uses varying dynamics(piano to fortissimo) and emotions in her voice to make Turandot human, instead of just a singing machine. She is also completely on pitch while Nilsson is sometimes sharp.<br />The young Pavarotti has the honey sweet sound and ego to sing Calaf. His perfect tenor has no problems with the tessitura and he makes child's play with Nessum Dorma. He is the best Calaf on record and that includes Corelli who scoops too much. Bjoeling voice, however beautiful, is too small and thin even in the studio to do Calaf justice.<br />Enough has been said about Caballe's famous phrasing and pianissimo to make her the quintessential Liu. I can't think of a single soprano in the past or present that can touch her complete performance of the tragic slave girl. Yes, Tebaldi, Scotto and Price are all great. But next to the definitive interpretation of Caballe, they're all just second best or less.<br />Unlike what some people think, opera is not just voice, the orchestra is also very important, as well as the conductor. Zubin mehta and the London Phil Orchestra paints the most dramatic and colorful picture of ancient China-both the barbaric and ugly side as well as its excessive opulence. His competitors falls short of that, in my opinion.<br />Finally, the recorded sound of this Turandot is second to none. It is absolutely state of the art. You can hear everything, from the softest triangle to the thunderous climaxes. It rivals the finest digital recordings that I've got, and I'm an audiophile<br />So, all in all, this Turandot is the almost undispute standard for all others. Ignore the Sutherland bashers who hates the Australian diva because she is the only soprano who can rival Callas or Nilsson as the &quot;Voice of the Century&quot;.(We all know <BR>about the Sutherland/Callas, Tebaldi/Callas politics)<br />In conclusion, almost all of the opera recording guides I've read consider this to be the definitive recording of Turandot. If you read all the reviews of the amateur critics here, you'll find that over 80% of them feel that this is the Turandot to get. <br />Pay special attention to the feature &quot;was this review helpful to you&quot; (yes or no) option at the end of each review. Notice that whenever someone writes a mean spirited review of this opera, they are voted down by &quot;NO&quot; by with unique feature. Notice also that all the negative reviews of this Turandot have many, many &quot;no votes&quot; next to it. Meaning most fans disagree with the negative review. Also notice when a positive review is posted, the &quot;was this review helpful to you&quot; feature is ovewhelmed by &quot;yes&quot; votes. This reveals that the vast majority of the opera fans here adore this Turandot and disagree with the bashers.<br />Judge this Turandot by it's reputable and incomparable merits. Listen to it yourself and be thrilled. Just ignore the disrespectful comments of the jealous and immature &quot;critics&quot;
B00005V3Z4|1.0|I have to agree with the Donnie Sucko reviewer.  I had high expectations for this film, as it came highly recommended by friends of mine who ordinarily have good taste!  I thought it was slow, cliched, with underdeveloped, smarmy characters.  I thought the acting was poor to boot.  The special effects were sort of cool, but not cool enough to maintain interest.  I've never hit the time remaining button on the DVD remote as often as I have while watching this drek.

B000066NW0|2.0|OK, I will admit their are a few songs that are good but the most of it is just her singing about what every other pop singer before her sang about.  No real issues just a boy this and I can't do that.  She has possibility and determination but she needs to find her voice and start singing about real issues.
B00005K3NR|5.0|This is another example of how Stephen King's novels of supernatual occurances can translate to the screen in the hands of the right director (the other being Kubrick's version of \\"The Shining\\").

0440237688|3.0|I am an eighth grade student and this was one of two books that I was required to read this year (see also my review for The Call of the Wild). This book is about Jonah, a young teen who lives in a community where everything and everybody is the same. There are no colors, and a board of superiors controls the community. It is censorship at its worst. The board also selects jobs for the teens. Jonah receives the job of Giver, which is very rare. The current Giver, in Jonah's job training, passes on memories such as color, pain, war, and love to Jonah.<br />This book is more for teens than for children due to some content.<br />This novel mainly discusses the use of censorship and how protected people are in some aspects of their lives. It talks about how people must experience things themselves in order to mature.<br />This book was good half the time. Some of the memories and lessons Jonah learns are memorable, and wonderful to read about. This book was also bad half the time. Some of the memories, thoughts, ideas, and rituals of the community are too much.

These two songs are so epic in scope, it's quite hard to find something to even compare them to, you truly have to hear it for yourself to believe it.<br />I suppose if you're used to Godspeed, you know what to expect.  If you're not though, and you just wandered here, you should most definitely check these guys out.  I dont think you'll be disappointed.
0385504209|3.0|Everything you every knew is wrong...or so says Dan Brown.  This novel received such incredible hype that I was almost certain to be let down. You can approach such a book in two ways: Forget reality and have a fun read or try to appreciate the research and idea even if the storyline strays from time to time.<br />The opening was absolutely one of the best I have come read. For a time you are thinking the \\"Thomas Crown Affair\\" in terms of sophisticated presentation. It soon devolves, though, into a Robert Ludlum conspiracy with mad priests, a prototype French detective, unassuming hero, brave heroine, evil religious institutions, ancient mysteries, etc.  You've seen it all before.<br />Brown devotes much energy in regurgitating the whole Jesus- Mary \\"affair\\" [what a double entendre] and the improbable notion that their lineage still exists in none other than (gasp!!) the  damsel who rescued our unassuming hero. Of course, she had no idea. We learn that \\"real\\" religion was once about the \\"goddess\\" but then those crafty males discredited her personhood and gained control of religious institutions.  Male-domination owes far more to physical prowess than nefarious schemes to diss Isis/Athena/Eve or in this case, Mary Magdalene.<br />A recurring problem is the attempt to integrate the action with discussions of pseudo-historical import. What you get is a mad race then a pause for a casual conversation on behind-the-scenes machinations at the Council of Nicene or being held at gunpoint while discussing cryptography in ancient Rome or reviewing the the apparent not-so-secret lives of such luminaries as Da Vinci, Newton, and modern day French presidents.<br />The ending was as bizarre and awful as the beginning was grand.  This is a book I wanted to like.  It had intellectual and artistic appeal, semi-original material and an unlikely hero.  This could have been a shocking, moving book but of course, in the end, nothing is really changed. For a good religious mystery get \\"Gospel\\"\\"Gospel\\"
B00006CXXU|4.0|When Christina Aguilera came out with her debut album back in 1999, I wasn't very impressed with her at all. I thought she had a good voice but wasted it on annoying, poorly written bubble gum songs. After seeing the video for \\"Dirrty\\", I was about to write her off as a singer who was incapable of making good pop songs. Even though I had my doubts, I listened to a little bit of the album online, and I started to slowly change my mind about Ms. Aguilera. I got the CD for Christmas, and I instantly fell in love with it. <br />The only thing I don't like about this album is that some of the songs are very derivative, which forced me to take one star off my rating. \\"Fighter\\" sounds like the love child of Janet Jackson's \\"Black Cat\\" and Destiny's Child's \\"Survivor\\". \\"Loving Me 4 Me\\" sounds like Mariah Carey's \\"Underneath the Stars\\". \\"Make Over\\" is strongly reminiscent of Sugababe's \\"Overload\\" (and oddly enough, Xtina sings \\"It's overload\\" at one point in the song). \\"The Voice Within\\" sounds like a rewrite of Mariah Carey's \\"Hero\\". Even with these faults, I have to admit that the songs are still good.<br />\\"I'm OK\\" is definitely the best song on this CD, and in my opinion, is Christina's best vocal performance ever. Instead of doing vocal gymnastics, she uses subtlety and genuine emotion as she sings about her abusive father. The music is simple (just an acoustic guitar and a few violins) which helps make the song even more real, melancholy, and emotional. I hope in the future that she writes more songs like this.<br />\\"Walk Away\\" is a beautiful R&B/soul-tinged ballad with a great flow. \\"Infatuation\\" is a nice Latin-tinged midtempo. \\"Beautiful\\" is the second best song after \\"I'm OK\\". And I love the video for this song. I'm glad that she applied a universal message to this song, rather than just making a close-minded females-are-the-only-ones-who-deal-with-insecurity song (i.e. TLC's \\"Unpretty\\"). \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\" is set to raise some conservative eyebrows as Xtina sings about casual sex. Christina has made sure to cover various types of relationships on this CD. I don't see a problem with that. And just because an artist sings about something doesn't necessarily mean that he or she condones the act. <br />There are some low points on this CD, however. The Alicia Keys-penned \\"Impossible\\" gets boring after awhile. I find most of Alicia's stuff boring, so this is no surprise to me. \\"Underappreciated\\" is bland, uninspired filler. And \\"Dirrty\\" (even though it was sadly released as the debut song) is the worst song on here, so try not to judge the whole album by this song alone.<br />Overall, this is a good, solid pop album. Xtina has proved to me that she does have talent, and I now have a good amount of respect for her now.
B00008LDPU|4.0|I had no interest in getting this DVD until I saw a clip from it on a TV show last week.  For someone like me whose only real exposure to animation (other than Chuck Jones and Tex Avery cartoons) was the film &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; and the &quot;Battle of the Planets&quot; on television in the late 70's, this type of animation seemed, well, a bit nerdy.  BOY WAS I WRONG!!<br />This is stunning work!  Creative in its execution, brave in its storytelling, and mind-boggling in its visuals!<br />My favorite ones are the first three, but especially &quot;The Last Flight of the Orisis&quot; (did I misspell that?).  Animation sure has come a long way since the old days of painting on cels.  The computer-generated 3D-like visuals are so realistic that you almost forget you are watching animation. Think of the film &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; with the benefit of a few years' worth of technological improvements.<br />The second two short story animation pieces are as much commentary on the surety of modern civilization collapsing as they are simply backstory for the &quot;Matrix&quot; films.  They are morally thought-provoking and sociologically scary.<br />All in all, the 9 short films run the gamut over many different styles of animation, from the computer-generated to the more traditional.  The separate stories are bound by a common thread, but some of them diverge farther than others.  But the mixing of the numerous styles of animation keeps the whole affair from getting visually repetitive, and that is a definite plus, despite the fact that the animation is superb anyway.<br />The bonus features on the disc, including commentaries, b-t-s features, etc., are good for fleshing out what you get for your purchasing dollar, but I'd almost rather NOT know how they did some of this stuff.  It's really more fun just to watch it and stare in awe and wonder.  You animation junkies, however, will be more than pleased with the extras, I'd imagine.<br />Though each of these films are short (around 9 minutes each), none of them feel skimpy.  They were obviously crafted with as much meticulousness and caring and talent as the &quot;Matrix&quot; feature films were.<br />Bottom line, &quot;The Animatrix&quot; features some solid and compelling storytelling, and the fact that these are animated features hopefully will not scare away the more traditional film fans who have yet to discover how animation has jumped forward in leaps and bounds since many of us were kids.<br />Rent it if you want, but you'll probably end up buying it anyway.<br />Highly recommended!e short (around 9 minutes each), none of them feel skimpy.

B00003CXBK|5.0|After watching Princess Mononoke i was blown away.. it became one of my all time favorites.. I know so many reviewers wrote this but.. Hayao Miyazaki is an absolute genius.. his other movies Spirited Away, Laputa Castle in the Sky, Kiki's delivery service, Grave of Fireflies truely are amazing.. This movie is definitely worth watching!
B00000JMOJ|2.0|I suppose if it were its own movie, then The Running Man wouldn't be so bad. As its own movie, it would be somewhat cheesy, and not very memorable, still, I wouldn't have much of a problem with it. I suppose I still don't. Its just a lame movie, and certainly not worth buying.<br />I honestly do not know how they managed to say that it was based on the book by Stephen King writing as Richard Bachman. This movie was absolutely NOTHING like the book was. It wasn't just the ending, where the book had the tragic ending (although perhaps in some ways a victory for Ben Richards), whereas the movie just HAD to have that classic hollywood ending. EVERYTHING was changed. In fact, the only common elements between the book and the movie was Ben Richards as the protagonist and there is a character named Killian, and he is on some kind of show. Even the rules of the show change from book to movie. In the book, he must run throughout the country and avoid being killed, whereas in the movie he fights on stage against a bunch of cheeser wrestling-type combatants with lame toys. It was almost humorous, though certainly not something I would take seriously.<br />If you have a few hours to kill and are really curious about the movie, then go ahead and watch the movie. You might even enjoy it. Who knows? But in my opinion, I'd have to say that the book was definitely better. This is, unfortunately, the case with most of Stephen King's material, but is probably the most accurately said in the case of \\"The Running Man\\".
6303471714|5.0|I first went to Radu's gym about fifteen years ago.  I started up again a few years back, but then switched to a job that was on the other side of town and just couldn't make it.  I remember hearing he had made a work out video with Cindy Crawford and Voila!, quickly found it at a video store.<BR>  <BR>I LOVE IT!!!  It was just like the classes, so I knew I made the right choice. <BR> <BR>Every so often, when I realized I wasn't getting enough excercise in my daily routine of life, I'd start using the video again.<BR>  <BR>Radu is really a very tough trainer.  No kidding, he doesn't mess around.  <BR>Knowing this, if you haven't worked out before or in a long while, start with the 10-minute routine first.  Some reviews say how sore everyone is in the beginning - start with the 10-minute workout.  After you're comfortable doing that for a week or so, move on to the 40-minute workouts.  (Switch between the 10-minute and a 40-minute one if you're still too sore?)  This last time around, I did the 10-minute one for about 4 weeks.  (I began working at home and was dearly out of shape!)  I then moved onto the 40-minute routines.  After about a week or so of those, my boyfriend said \\"WOW!  You look great!  You really are doing those workouts every day, aren't you?\\"  I don't know if it's the first 4 weeks of the 10-minute routine and then the 40-minute ones or just the 40-minute routines that made enough difference for him to notice, but it was still enough to make a difference.  I'm no longer tired doing the simple things.  <br />Even if you're a workout fiend, you're still going to be challenged with this video.<BR>  <BR>As for one posting saying doctors have seen patients with back pain after using the video...  Isn't it a long since known fact to consult a physician before beginning any type of workout regimen?  If that same person went to a fitness class, the instructor would have noticed they were straining and had them slow down or stop.  You have to use your own best judgement when you do it yourself at home.<br />I cannot recommend this video enough.  I guess there's a reason they say it's sold more than any other workout video. <BR> <BR>The music doesn't get tiresome and some of the excersises for the same body area alter enough so it's not boring.  The changes between black & white and color and the different backgrounds also keep it interesting.  Add that to the fact that the routines aren't so \\"wild\\" that I can't do them in my tiny NYC apartment living room make it just the perfect fit.  <BR>After so many uses, the tape finally went \\"snowy\\" this morning, hence I'm on this site to buy a new one - along with the follow up I hear has long since come out.  Stick with it and you WILL see changes.<br />One last thing - I used canned soup and later liter sized bottled water as my \\"weights\\" for years.  You don't want to be so sore in the beginning that you can't lift your toothbrush the next morning.
B00005JLRT|2.0|Since this was the first time I watched a Trek movie in the cinema, I had my hopes up. Good sound and picture would be awaiting me. Well, after finishing the movie that's almost all I got. The story was bad, the bad guy was bad, the inconsistencies were really really bad, the special FX were mediocre. In the FX department it all looked nice but another mano a mano and ship to ship battle was simple too simple. Star Wars overkills in this department but this movie underkills (is that a word :). What were those beach buggies doing there.<br />I could keep going, but you probably read some of the other reviews. It's a repetition of ST2 but without any link to the TNG universe. This movie rates just above the worst TNG episode ever &quot;Shades Of Grey&quot;. I am disappointed in the way Trek is going. <br />I've been a fan for many years and I hope Rick Berman gets a kick in the head so his nuts come down. Let's have some balls in the Trek universe and get something new.
B00005JLT5|5.0|A true story about pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman and his life working in Polish labor camps during WWII, and how he escaped deportation and capture by living in Warsaw's ruins. It is a truly mesmerizing story. While it is somewhat slow in the beginning at sucking you in, you will be fully there by the end, I guarantee. <BR>The movie doesn't ever get political, nor does it get graphic or gory. It's simply one man's account of what it was like to be a Polish Jew and live through that time in history. Oh, don't get me wrong, there's plenty of violence and death. It's just not dwelled on. Nor are the horrors of Auschwicz, though we know what's happening through what we studied in history class and what we do see on screen. When thousands of Jews are \\"relocated to the south\\" we know fully where they are going and what their fate will be. <BR>While I admit I have not seen all the nominated performaces as yet, Adrian Brody must surely have desreved his best actor Oscar. His performace was absorbing, as was the movie. Even if you're not a fan of Holocaust movies, this one is highly recommended. Not as a history lesson, but as an uplifting story of human survival even through the worst of times.
B00005JLPK|5.0|Frida is a movie my wife wanted to see, she spent 10 years in Mexico and admires the work of Kahlo. I was a bit reluctant to see it, but last night we finally saw it. I was pleasantly surprised to see the life and work of an artist portraited in Frida. Her life, her work, Mexico, all got the attention needed to give a feeling for who Frida Kahlo must have been. The movie allows you to have a little more understanding of the work of Frida Kahlo. Through the use of sparse FX and some very fine photography the imagination, experiences and vision of Frida Kahlo are shown transformed into her paintings.<br />Salma Hayek and Molina are the couple Kahlo/Rivera that go through the ups and downs of their relationship. <br />If you like to see a good movie about life, both suffering and joy, Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera and just a first impression of Mexico, go see this movie.

0316666343|2.0|After all the hype, the strategic placement in book stores, and the lovely cover, my expectations were pretty high for this book.  What a disappointment.  Boring.  Unbelievable.  Characters (like the sister) whose motivations are unclear and whose actions are unexplained.  An interesting premise (watching from self-created &quot;heaven&quot;)that just doesn't gel.  I never got the desired sympathy for the Mom, and never figured out why the Dad put up with her crud.  Not a bad first novel... but am I the only one who doesn't get it?
B000055X3U|5.0|Anathema is not just a metal band and this is not just an album. I mean can you imagine a stream of sentiments so pure and somber that they drag you along with its every single note? Never have I heard anything close to this masterpiece...Generally sad and melancholic musicians make up false emotions just for the sake of sticking to the genre or the line......staind is such example, although the music is good and somewhat sad, but the genuity and the pristinity of the work slips away when long-term effect is condsidered. Many other bands play sad music but none match the integrity of pure and true emotional experiences of this band. Anathema is one of those bands that being a master piece in itself is less known or generalized in actual public just like The Shawshank Redemption the movie is. Having a David Gilmour pink floyd touch and the best-sad-lyrics, its idiosyncracy can never be undermined. Alot of Anathema fans (having the image of Pre-Eternity-Growling-Anathema) think that this is just another album but what they fail to realize is that the band has undergone an emotional change for the best. \\"Black 91\\" Metallica is not equal to \\"Load\\" Metallica, but both albums speak extraordinary music. \\"Eternity\\" Anathema is not equal to \\"Serenades\\" Anathema and certainly both are not equal to \\"judgement\\" or \\"Alternative 4\\" Anathema.<BR>The point is, that this albums is a full-fledged-best-of album that a band can ever produce. Just like Metallica weren't able to pull out anything better after \\"black 91\\".<BR>If you listen to rock music (any category:- metal, hard, gothic, black, death or grunge), this album is a must! Its pure art, truly an emotional-agenda with the ability to grasp your attention like a drug...<BR>A fine day to exit is another extraordinary experiment but i agree with one reviewer that it really has got nothing to do with judgment. I believe the band is still capable of more and we might see another master piece in 2004-5-6.<BR>If you havent yet heard how anathema may change moods and produce tears in your eyes and shiver a breeze down your spine, check out \\"J'ai Fait Une Promesse\\" from their album \\"Serenades\\", you'll see what the band is capable of. And after that check judgement out.<BR>Give Judgement to any music listener....a 5-star rank is inevitable. I dont think no band has ever produced annything like this....not even Anathema (??)<BR>So, <BR>BUY THIS ! OH PEOPLE !
B00008DDSC|4.0|If you own Crash, then I think you should own this movie too.  Both movies are, in a way, about sex.  Both star James Spader.<br />The Secretary is about a troubled girl who likes to hurt herself.  She is hired by a troubled man who likes to hurt girls.  The imagery and symbolism is fantastic (I'll never look at a red Sharpie the same way again).<br />The only realy downfall to this movie is that the ending isn't really very intense.  They could have cut the ending of the movie off just after the lawyer makes his \\"I'm rather fond of you as well\\" statement, and it would have been perfect.  As it is, they drag it out to a fairybook ending in a normal seeming suburbia lifestyle.
B000000OQF|5.0|The band were great.  The line up, the looks, the sound.  Everything GnR did was perfectly portraying the lifestyle of the late 80s hardrockers.  <BR>This album was great when it was released, I reckon it is still the essential item for anyone who loves rock n roll.<BR>It;'s a shame that they had to fall apart.  Axl's vocal is not my favourite, but with the back up band like that, anyone's voice can sound GREAT.
B00005JM03|4.0|Strange that they called this one the Italian Job, since it has little in common with the caper classic it was named after. All the two movies really have in common is stolen gold and Austin Minis. The plot of this movie is really about the oldest trick in the book. The double cross.<br />In an attempt to put a new spin on that old plot, the creators of this movie decided to have the double cross very early in the film. After a somewhat interesting heist, the gang responsible for it is betrayed by one of their own and their gold stolen. This basically makes the rest of the movie our lovable band of thieves (and very well cast for the most part I might add) getting back the loot that they rightfully stole. This early plot twist might have made for a more interesting movie had the best actor in the film (Donald Sutherland) not been killed off in the process. Don't you just hate it when that happens?<br />You're a Good Man Charlie Brown<br />Our main character Charlie is played by Mark Wahlberg. Now don't get me wrong, he's a likable enough fellow. And he seems to do best playing the nice guy in films. But he really doesn't do much in the way of acting in any of the films I've seen him in. If there was one actor who could be replaced by a cardboard cut-out without anyone noticing, it would be him. I seriously cannot remember him saying one memorable line in the entire film. Perhaps it's because he said them all the same...<br />The Cast's the Thing<br />Well even though our main character isn't exactly Hamlet, does that make our film derail completely? No, no, no. For he is supported by a fine cast in the grand old tradition of caper films. Seth Green (the REAL Napster), is totally hilarious in this film. Sure, we've all seen a supposedly brillaint hacker in films before, but somehow he just rises above into new levels of geek parody. And then there's my man Jason \\"The Transporter\\" Statham. This guy has just got \\"the Driver\\" and \\"Action Star\\" written all over him. He's like the new Steve McQueen of Caper and driving movies. He's too darn cool. In fact, my favorite scene in the movie is one where he steps out of the car to sweet talk a girl into giving him exactly what he needs, and Seth Green  (the often stereotyped super-nerd hacker genius) starts imitating both the voice of the girl and Statham's voice. Now that's funny! And then of course we have our love-interest safe-cracker (and the daughter of the guy who got iced), and the required demolition expert. Everyone does a pretty good job in their roles, but no one else really stands out in my mind.<br />Get Some Action<br />For all the hype and popcorn popping, you'd think the minis were going to be flying down the streets of L.A. in long, extended, over-the-top driving sequences. Sorry guys, but the driving action simply ain't all that. The Bourne Identity has got a way better chase scene than this movie. So does The Transporter. Heck, so does Gone in 60 Seconds. If that's all you're interested in, by all means, rent one of those.<br />All in All<br />I'd say this movie is worth seeing once, especially if you particularly like any of the cast members or love caper-flicks.

B000002C1V|5.0|Was it really 20 years ago that Rolling Stone gave this album, yes album not CD, 5 stars?  Easily the best produced Floyd record to date.  Sure, Ezrin did a great job with the Wall and Alan Parsons should be complimented for DSOTM.  Still, technology marches on and what gets delivered here is a record that is just pristine in its sound quality...On to the music.<br />The '80s were really a VERY poor time given that the Cold War was given new, and more menacing, life by 'Maggie' Thatcher and Ronald Reagan.  As Roger Waters said many times, he was under the impression that REAL lessons had been leanred from WWII.<BR>And frankly, they had not, as evidenced by the Falklands War,<BR>and so many that have come since.  Southampton Dock is just so chilling.  <br />This record really was the end of the Floyd as fans came to know the band.  Roger and David were not getting along and Richard Wright had already been kicked out of the band.  Things were bad enough that Nick Mason didn't even play on Two Sunsets.<BR>Instead, Andy Newmark, of Roxy Fame, and soon the Bleeding Heart Band handled the work.
6305127697|5.0|Edward Norton never ceases to amaze me with his acting. In every role of his, I forget that it's Norton, and truly get sucked into his character. All of his roles are incredible, but this one is right up there with his other Oscar-nominated role in American History X. Richard Gere plays a major hot-shot lawyer (as he usually does) who becomes convinced of his client's (Norton) innocence when nobody else does. This film came at the very beginning of Norton's film career and is already a landmark for him. See this movie for his sake. This is not something that most kids would enjoy, nor should they view. Its R rating reflects strong language, some grisly violence, and a scene of sexuality that includes nudity. This is a memorable film with memorable roles.
6304708491|4.0|Some people won't believe it, but Help! set the boundaries for Monty Python. (There's a fact behind it, but we'll not go into it).  Anyways, the Beatles obviously play themselves.  Ringo gets this huge ring about the size of his nose in a fan letter and, being Ringo, decides to put it on.  The only problem is it won't come off.  Little does he know the ring is from an evil cult lead by some creepy dude named Klang who has to sacrifice anybody who wears the ring.  Well guess who still has it on??  <BR>The evil cult people try taking the ring by chopping off his finger in the resteraunt scene.  Oh, and that's where George Harrison was first inspired by the sitar. Anyways,after a few attempts (such as nearly destroying a bathroom), the ring still won't come off.  Eventually, they decide to leave for a few stops around the world, such as the Alps (where they go skiing and all heck breaks lose) and the Royal Palace in London. Ringo says some funny lines about how they won't get out of the Palace alive. Never-the-less, Klang finds him, along with the scientest dudes, but they don't play too much of a big part.  Klang gets his chance to kill Ringo.  But I won't tell you too much.  Some songs include Help!, Hide your love away, Lose that Girl, I Need You (Harrison), and Ticket to Ride.  It's an underrated comedy in my aspect.

0385504209|5.0|Excellent read.  Suspenseful book I found extremely difficult to put away.  This is the first book I have ever considered reading twice - the first time to find out the story and the second for the details! Dan Brown has woven his fictional characters wonderfully into the real life Grail controversy and brought up this 'conspiracy theory for a new generation!  This book made me painfully aware of how much history I do not know, but it made me want to learn more!
0688163173|2.0|Lehane is a very very good writer. He uses his talent to construct a novel like July 4th fireworks that are beautiful and exciting. At the conclusion, however, the reader is left with ashes and an empty sky. I don't always need a happy ending but I also do not like hopeless ones or endings that are depressing. One is left with the impression that the author was very clever, leads one down a garden path, and then ultimately leaves one gutted. Lehane ought to use his talent to better effect than to simply dazzle us, let us taste everything, and then abandon us with our stomachs upset.

But most important, \\"American Graffiti\\" document's America's love affair with cars.<br />\\"American Graffiti\\" describes the teen lifestyle that most males want and never achieve.  Set in 1962, the film revolves around two young men out on the town on a weekend night, cruising the strip and chasing fast cars.  The night is filled with hot rods, drive-ins, car hops, girlfriends and rock n' roll music.  The young men are 'good kids', but their lives are about to change permanently and their heads are whirling with the challenge.<br />\\"American Graffiti\\" revolves around cars.  Characters' cars reflect their personalities and their status -- cars are passports to freedom.  The airwaves are full of rock n' roll artists singing about cars.  Cruising the strip takes a full tank of gasoline, and the man with the fastest car is the local celebrity.  The characters in \\"American Graffiti\\" practically *live* in their cars.<br />In Summer 1971 I was working two jobs, but gasoline sold for less than twenty-eight cents per gallon -- purchasing gasoline for my car was no problem.  I love the memories that \\"American Graffiti\\" recalls.  But with today's higher petroleum costs, gasoline is a significant budget item and my love affair with cars has cooled.
B000002KGT|5.0|Well, I don't know If I can do this justice in a review. Excellent sound quality, especially caonsidering the time of production, and some just d**N great songs. The best tracks on this: &quot;Go your own way&quot;nd &quot;Gold dust woman&quot;. The worst? &quot;Oh daddy&quot;. As is typicall with Lindsey Buckingham, the guitar is strong and has a way of getting stuck in your head (In a good way). Stevie's lyrics are mysterious and beutiful, and the music that accompanies them dosn't dissapoint. Christine's songs are good, but I really think that she sonds her best when live. Recording equipment dosn't seem to capture her voice accuratly. Overall, excellent album, my personal favorite, from a time when &quot;good music&quot; wasn't an oxymoron.
B00008OSD3|2.0|Few fans of Star Trek have been more rabid in the adulation of all things in the Star Trek universe than I.  What I have noticed is that the various television shows have uniformly showed better acting, scripting, and dialogue than the Star Trek movies have.  This is rather surprising since you would expect with the colossal budgets that the film directors and producers have that they could crank out better material than what routinely has appeared on the small screen.  Unfortunately, this has rarely been the case and in STAR TREK NEMESIS, the trend toward big screen bores continues.  It is almost as if the writers are fearful of leading the Enterprise into any of the novel territory that TNG, DS9, VOYAGER, and ENTERPRISE most often went. Instead, these writers seem content merely to borrow the ideas that proved hits on television, but have forgotten what it was that made these ideas hits in the first place.  In NEMESIS, a villain appears (Tom Hardy)who has a grudge against Starfleet (Khan from THE WRATH OF KHAN & Soren from GENERATIONS) and proceeds to show just why he fails to deliver his plans for revenge or conquest.  At least Ricardo Montalban (Khan) and Malcolm McDowell (Dr. Soren) had a penchant for allowing the audience to peek under the mask of villainy to identify the underlying motivation that must be there if the audience is to click with that villain.  Tom Hardy as Praetor Sinzon comes across as woefully unmotivated.  He can't seem to make up his mind whether he wishes to cross swords with Captain Picard or to destroy the earth for the glory of the Romulan Empire.  If the former, then the fact that he is a clone of a younger Picard does not in and of itself imbue his character with sufficient motivation to do anything with relation to Picard.  If the latter, then he ought to hate the Romulans since they had tormented him for years and should be thus unwilling to cover Romulus with glory.  As a villain worthy of boos and hisses, Hardy's Sinjon barely rates a single boo or hiss.  He comes across as a peevish schoolboy who seems singularly unsuited to lead a predator race.  <br />The Star Trek writers on television had no problem coming up with exciting scripts for the many two part episodes that resonate even today.  If NEMESIS had been written as a straight science fiction outer space movie in a non-Star Trek setting, would it have even been made?  Possibly part of the problem is that the second generation Star Trek crew is showing their age, just as did Kirk, Spock, and McCoy when they made the leap from the small to the big screen.  Unless the writers can refrain from borrowing from a finite bag of used plots, then they might be better off shifting focus to the newest generation of Starfleet, Captain Archer of ENTERPRISE.
B00008H2LB|5.0|This album from linkin park kinda struck me in a weird way. Having been a big fan of their first album, when I first heard of this one I naturally went out to pick it up. After the first time I listened to it... I actually was border-line like/dislike. Some of it sounded like the old linkin park, some didn't. The lyric's I felt were not as inticate as their first album and it seemed like they were struggling to make it through the album. I actually put the CD away for about a week because I was kinda dissapointed. Then I decided to put the CD in my car stereo for my hour long trip to school and while listening to it up there and back after a few days, it finally struck me... I was listening... but I wasn't LISTENING to the album. Taking my initial dissapointment and throwing it aside, I really started listening and got into the album. So much in fact, i've been caught several times in my car at an intersection jamming away. The looks I've gotten are kinda halarious. But, I just can't help myself sometimes. The album has a different feel than the first one did. I'm pretty sure that's why I didn't like it at first. But if you pay attention, you find that first impression's are VERY wrong with this album. I now keep this album in the car and burned one for my house and have yet to get tired of listening to it. My favorite tracks have got to be #7 and #10. Lest favorite would be #5. <br />All in all, this album rocks but you need to keep an open ear and mind or else you won't like it. You'll probably listen to it one time and chuck it like I did. DON'T! You don't know what your missing. Give it a chance and you might be presently surprised.
B00003CXXS|4.0|I was a little disappointed by Jurassic park 3. It had the actiona dn adventure, but for some reason nothing can compare to the first one. There are some awesome new dinosaurs int his one
B000003S0P|5.0|This is one of the most brilliant and moving rock albums of the 1970's.<br />I have never heard the original vinyl pressing, or any earlier CD editions of this album. But the production on this 24-bit re-mastered edition is stunning. Clean, powerful, *big*. It sounds like an album produced in the 1990's, not the 1970's.<br />The musicianship is flawless. These are technical masters at the top of their game.<br />But on to the material. Between 1969 and 1973 King Crimson, of course, has been all over the map, in terms of style, and direction, and formation. But the King Crimson that recorded \\"Red\\" was unique in the band's history.<br />A trio for the first (and last) time. And like many trios (Rush, King's X, ZZ Top), there is a purity of purpose and often a stripped-down simplicity to the sound. There are a few exceptions where they bring in a sax or violin in a jam, to stunning effect. (The last few minutes of \\"One More Red Nightmare\\" are just amazing).<br />The album is dark and moody. Melancholy. Beautiful. There are moments that were so moving it sent chills up my spine. (It is the rare piece of music that can do this to me.)<br />It's rock. It's jazz. It's classical. It's a fusion of all of these, resulting in powerful, meaningful, memorable music.<br />I can't adequately describe it. Just get it and listen to it.
B00005MAM2|5.0|I loved the story line on this movie. It was a little science fiction, and a lot of awesome action! I like the motorcycles depicted in the film because they still look futuristic even today. I know the motorcycles really didnt have much to do with the story, but cool none the less. Anyway, the special effects and drawings were spectacular, and the plot twists were unexpected and exciting. I love this film and recommend it to any person that is even a little interested in anime.
B00005JLSE|5.0|If anyone didn't like this movie, it is for the following reasons: they can't sing well (if at all), they can't dance anything Fosse (probably too fat), they can't act and just haven't been able to get into a movie themselves, or all of the above. These people are so obviously jealous because this movie is getting more attention than them and their incessant whining about nothing real. Chicago won the oscar. The whiners didn't. Catherine Zeta-Jones rocks and they don't. Simple as that. Perhaps all the naysayers should prove their mettle and dance, sing, and act with those of us who have actually done it for a living for audiences that pay us to entertain them. And besides all this, it's downright un-American to put down the All American art form: the musical. So there, you old poops! Chicago ROCKS!
B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park rocks. Although many people say that they are a waste of time because they're not hardcore or they're nothing more than a boy band, I beg to differ. The lyrics are deep and meaningful, perfectly integrated with the backround music, and most of all dont rely on profanity to make great music. This album is the best yet, although reanimation had great effects and catchy lyrics (remixed versions of Hybrid Theory). I give this album a perfect 5 stars because Linkin Park reworked their magic into this album just like the previous ones.
6300271439|5.0|Anyone that has followed Madonna's filmography will have to agree that this is one of Madonna's better films.  As far as I am concerned this is the most entertaining of Madonna's films.  Who's that Girl is a riot featuring Madonna as a recently released from prison screw ball blond that sets the big apple in an uproar as she tries to clear her name for a murder that she never committed.  Madonna seems to be at ease with this role and seems to go with her just fine when you compare it to some her more recent dismal roles in films like Four Rooms, Dick Tracy, A League of Her Own, the atrocious Evita, and even The Next Best Thing.  This film is an hour and a half of pure dumb comedy in which Madonna manages to give a reasonably decent and believable character and at times is even funny.  Even though this film was a flop at the box office, the film does entertain and especially if you are a fan of the Material Girl.  Madonna is dumb, funny, pretty, glamorous, and looks every inch of an 80's pop star in Who's that Girl.  A great soundtrack featuring four Madonna tracks adds to the highlight of this film.  Madonna was definitely the girl of the eighties.
B000021YQV|4.0|I enjoy this band very much because they have great lyrics and awesome gituar and drum music. They also decided not to include profanity to make awesome music. I also like the different topics they cover including political views and just plain crazyness. The band integrates these views into catchy and memorizing songs. Hmmmmmm.........
0156027321|5.0|Yann Martel has created one of the most likeable characters in recent days- Pi is intelligent, charming, and amazingly captivating.  With small glimmers of &quot;The Old Man and the Sea,&quot; Martel develops the ocean into an unforgiving, vast, and mysterious character.  But perhaps the crux of the book occurs at the end, when Martel forces the reader to question the events and stories, and their ultimate meaning, that occur in the book. An absolute must read. We hope Marel can top it off.
B00005JKCH|5.0|I loved this movie because of the great special effects and awesome storyline. From the begining of the movie, you pity Peter Parker because he is treated like dirt and is bullied by the whole school bus (even the driver). After he is bitten he as a whole is changed including his body, his abilitys, and even his looks(no more glasses and even a more sophisticated look). This movie has it all action, adventure, and even a slight love story. Oh and also the most innovative kiss seen in movies. A real blockbuster, and movie you need to own.
B00006CXXU|5.0|this album from xtina is an amzing cd. i love it. i've never heard her at her best ever in my life on albums. if you're planning to get this, then go ahead. you won't be sorry!
B00008OWZC|5.0|As a member of the third generation to experience Zeppelin, this couldn't have come at a better time. The BBC Sessions came out six years ago, and all LZ fans have been waiting for a compilation that contains the best of the muddied bootlegs we've been listening to for nigh on thirty years. The reviews are all true: this is the band at the top of their game, with all four men at their musical peaks. Standouts include the &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; medley, &quot;Rock And Roll&quot; and one of the earliest performances of &quot;Over The Hills And Far Away&quot;. Buy the DVD, for that and this album eclipses &quot;The Song Remains The Same&quot; and finally puts to rest the notion that Zeppelin was a mediocre live act. Rock!
B00005MK9Y|4.0|The trouble with live albums is that techically the music is never as good as on studio albums. But Bob Marley is one of those performers who I  enjoy live just as much as in the studio. I have three different live albums of his, and they are all great, but I think that what perhaps gives this one the edge is that it has the best song selection. The versions of Stir It Up, Rebel Music, Heathen, and Is This Love are particulary excellent, and the only track I'm not crazy about is Jamming, which is possibly my favorite Marley number, but just not in this version.<br />But what you do get here is a great rowdy, thumping performance of a baker's dozen of Marley favorites, mostly in extended versions, with some fine guitar soloing and and hand-clapping, foot-stomping, sing-along audience making for great atmospherics.<br />I love playing this album on my daily commute to and from work, and sometimes wish I had a bit further to travel. It would also make an excellent gift for the Marley fan who has a few of the studio albums, but wants to live (or relive) the experience of a live performance of one of the world's greatest stars...
B00000I8NC|5.0|The most important thing that a person must have when listening to Godspeed is patience.  With each record of theirs that I have, I've always had to wait through several weeks of listening before the power and beauty hit me.<br />This ep is no different.  It's not just the same chords and melodies repeated like some may say.  It doesn't have the melodic diversity that classical music has, but this isn't classical music so that comparison shouldn't be made. <br />This album is full of emotional peaks and valleys because of the volume changes and the changing mood that is evoked by tensions and releases.  During the intense parts of the record you can feel yourself floating up to the clouds, and then slowly coming back down to earth when the music eases back off.<br />The way the music on the second track hangs off of the sampled guy ranting about the government is fantastic and is always fun to listen to.  This is a definite step up from their first album.  It's more cohesive and shows growth in song writing ability.
B00008PX8P|5.0|As a Led Zeppelin fan for the last 30 years, I jumped for joy at the news of this DVD.  To be sure, Jimmy Page's sound byte of &quot;mystery, thunder and the hammer of the gods&quot; to describe Zep live is well presented here, and the DVD is worth every penny.<br />It should be noted that we're also subject to a fair amount of smoke and mirrors here, as anyone who's heard bootlegs of these shows can attest to.  Page has unabashedly mixed multiple audio performances and less than stellar, damaged source footage into a singular illusion of Zeppelin live ... in its own right, a technological achievement as groundbreaking as the first Matrix movie.  Multi-tracks (when available) have been remixed, edited and likely auto-tuned to present Zeppelin as more consistently proficient than they were ... Page was often out of tune, and when he WAS in tune, he often played inarticulate (albeit passionate) solos, and Robert Plant was often hoarse, flat or both ... but make no mistake, the overall sound quality here is absolutely startling.  This is Zeppelin as you WISH they were live.<br />While Led Zeppelin DVD is less than honest from a documentation standpoint, it is quite possibly the BEST produced music DVD ever.  Page created a DVD with all the love a true Zeppelin fan would have.  The menus are meticulously produced with wonderful surprises -- not the least of which is a bootleg film (culled from two nights, naturally) of &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot; opening their 1977 set.  Other menus include footage from all through the years set to various rare live soundtracks.  It's simply a blast discovering each of these as one explores ...<br />The track selection is near perfect (I believe most Zep fans would've loved to also see versions of &quot;No Quarter&quot;, &quot;Over the Hills and Far Away&quot; or &quot;Ten Years Gone&quot;, plus we get only teased with a brief clip of Jimmy's violin bow/laser light show solo at Knebworth), and one gets VERY present to the lossof John Bonham as one of the best drummers ever.<br />But we Zeppelin fanatics are a forgiving lot ... we love Zeppelin warts and all ... and are ELATED about this release. I, personally, have made a second career out of watching this DVD since its release and look forward to seeing it again. Thank you, Jimmy Page for making this happen, and of course to the other lads for the legacy of Zeppelin this honors so well.  While this might not be an entirely authentic Holy Grail, it's certainly the Grail we wanted to find.
B00005JM03|4.0|Even though this movie isn't as good as the almighty Ocean's Eleven, The Italian Job is one of the best movies that I've seen in a while, if not ever.  After their friend betrayed them during a job in Venice, Mark Whalberg, Jason Statham, Mos Def, and Seth Green decide to get even with the traitor (Edward Norton).  They enlist the help of Charlize Theron, who plays the daughter of Donald Sutherland, the beloved leader of the group that Norton killed in Venice.  Theron is the safe cracker, Green is the computer whiz, Statham the driver, Def (coincidence that his character is half-deaf?) is surveillance, and Whalberg is the planner.  The jokes in the movie are wonderful.  They are sarchastic, witty, and timed correctly.  The plot, for the most part, makes sense, but there are a few problems, such as the subplot with the Ukranian guys, but I guess that at the end, they were somewhat necessary.  Also, Green's Napster references were kind of cheesy, but what are you going to do?  This is a great movie.  I guarantee that you will like it.

B00008LDPU|4.0|\\"The Animatrix\\" is a diverse collection of animated shorts based in and around the Wachowski brothers' \\"Matrix\\" universe.  The quality of the segments varies as much as the styles, however.<br />First of all, the segment \\"Beyond\\" is, for me, worth the purchase price on its own.  I will be watching this one again and again, in both languages.  It is beautiful, poetic, mysterious and non-violent (not that I have a problem with violence).  Consequently, it (along with \\"World Record\\") is also probably the furthest removed from the \\"Matrix\\" motion pictures. I cannot praise this segment enough.<br />\\"Kid's Story\\" and \\"A Detective Story\\" are also quite worthwhile.  Each exhibit unique artwork--from the hand-drawn, sketchy, explosive look of \\"Kid's\\" (a little reminiscent of Bill Plympton, though much less bizarre and cartoony) to the black & white, noir visuals of \\"Detective.\\"  Both are fairly interesting stories with artwork appropriate to each.<br />Unlike many reviewers here, I enjoyed \\"Program.\\"  While the story is not at all complex, I like the artwork quite a bit.<br />The rest:  \\"Final Flight of the Osiris\\" is technically impressive, but on the whole left me cold (much like \\"The Matrix Reloaded,\\" but that's a matter for another review).  \\"The Second Renaissance\\" two-parter is a retelling of the rise of the computers, and while I found the \\"documentary\\" approach (using \\"news footage\\" and visual cues from historical images of Vietnam and Tiananmen Square) interesting, I probably won't be revisiting this segment often.  I WANT to like \\"World Record\\" more; the art is very bold and unique, but I'm not really drawn into the story. Finally, concerning \\"Matriculated,\\" by \\"Aeon Flux\\" creator Peter Chung... didn't care much for \\"Flux,\\" and I can't say this did much for me either.<br />I feel I need to acknowledge the English language dubbing.  The voice talent is very good, with none of the goofy, distracting elements often associated with the genre.  (You know what I'm talking about--those weird \\"HUH-H-H?\\", \\"WHA-A-A?\\", \\"AIEEE!\\" type exclamations.)<br />RATINGS BREAKDOWN: \\"Beyond\\" -- 5/5. Obviously I really love this one.  \\"Kid's\\", \\"Detective\\" and \\"Program\\" -- 3.5/5.  The rest -- 2-3 stars or less.  Extra features -- 3-4/5. So overall, I've arbitrarily settled on 4/5.  \\"Beyond\\" makes me very satisfied with this purchase.
B00005JKPF|5.0|I saw X2 on opening day and expected to see an ordianary action movie but after seeing X2, I have a new favorite movie of all time right under The Matrix Reloaded.  I could hardly beleive that X2 turned out to be so good.  If you havent seen X2 you havent seen an action movie.  Plus, the two hottest women in the world, Famke Janssen(Jean Grey) and Halley Berry(Storm).  I left the movie theater with the biggest crush on Famke Janssen.  I think I'm going to propose to her.
B00008WG3U|4.0|NoFX is probably most famous for their humorous songs, but while these are enjoyable, Fat Mike is truly a genius when writing politically. The varied music that NoFX continually produces proves them to be an extremely original and creative band, and far away from the mindless pop-punk that pollutes MTV today. I am a fan of older punk, but I think with bands like NoFX writing like this, there is hope that punk isn't quite dead yet.<br />I have one objection about NoFX. On the whole, I usually love their ultra-liberal ideals, but a certain topic of theirs bothers me. NoFX supports the use of currently illegal drugs. It is their right to an opinion, but I do not support them in this. Even the name of the band suggests that they advocate drug use.<br />Moving on to more pleasant things...a song-by-song breakdown of the album, so you know exactly what you're getting into. (Amazon's track listing is wrong, I'll go by the order they actually appear on the album).<br />The Seperation of Church and Skate: The opening to the CD is perfect, starting off with some dialogue, and then going straight into one of the hardest songs on the album about the softening of new punk from the revolutionary music of the mid-eighties.<br />The Irrationality of Rationality: A depressing look into the lives of a few people in depressing situations. Hey, it criticizes corporate greed...what more do you want from a punk song?<br />Franco Un-American: A great, easygoing song about the transformation of a blinded, brainwashed, American consumer into an activist. Probably sums up the lives of a few of your friends (or perhaps former friends, if you're not the tolerant type).<br />Idiots Are Taking Over: Probably the best song on the album, this one's all about the devolution of the human race. Just listen to the lyrics, you shall be enlightened.<br />She's Nubs: A silly number to contrast to the beginning of what you may have thought was going to be a serious album. I don't enjoy this one much, butif you're a fan of that sort of thing, fine.<br />Mattersville: A song about \\"a neighborhood for punks over-the-hill.\\" For a not-completely-serious song, this one's pretty good. Should make all you 40 year old fans nostalgic. Or maybe not.<br />Decom-poseur: I must admit I have no idea what this is about. Nice on the ears though.<br />Medio-core: About the weak, pathetic MTV-punk around these days, and formula bands in general. A pretty good analysis of the situation, in my eyes.<br />Anarchy Camp: Another not too serious one about a summer camp for anarchists. Plenty of fun, with a pseudo-ska sound to it.<br />American Errorist: Any good punk hates Bush. So now you have a song about how much you hate him. Not quite anthemic enough to sing along with, but it's enough to make you lean back in your chair and say \\"Yeah....\\" in a positive way.<br />We Got Two Jealous Again: A song about a girl, with some reminiscing mixed in. Another one for you fans who were around as punk was developing.<br />13 Stitches: Basically a tribute to many of the great bands of the eighties and the scene at the time, this one takes the form of the life story of a punk. Of all the reminiscing on this album, this song probably does it the best.<br />Regaining Unconciousness: It's got a nice sound to it. Seems to be about the informal sector of the economy. Or perhaps police brutality. No, I've got it....it's about the opression of human rights under the leadership of Bush. Probably. Skips around a bit, but it sure gets the feeling across that the system is bad.<br />Whoops, I OD'd: A song about the dangers of drug abuse? From NoFX? There must be some sarcasm that I'm missing. It's a great album ender, musically, anyway. Hopefully not a prediction like Sublime's \\"Poolshark,\\" in which Bradley Nowell predicted his own death.<br />Overall, this album stands up well as a NoFX release, I liked that, like Punk in Drublic, a lot of material was political, and reminiscent of The Decline, which is always good. If you own a couple other NoFX albums, you know what to expect. If you don't know what to expect, due to lack of previous experience, check out some older stuff first.
0375432302|2.0|This is an entertaining tale, but to call it a historical novel is an egregious misnomer.  His representation of historical \\"facts\\" pertaining to the Knights Templar and the allusions to the Rosecrucians are inaccurate at best, and irresponsible in any event.  Cutting to the chase, everything else not withstanding, even if Jesus and Mary Magdalene had married and produced a \\"royal bloodlike,\\" the Passion, Crucifixion, and Resurrection still stand on their own right.  In other words, \\"What difference does could of this make in relation to one's faith and one's perception of Christianity?\\"  The only difference is much padding to Mr. Brown's bank account.  Greed, irresponsibility, and poor research in the guise of \\"Controversial Best Seller.\\"
B00005R2M3|5.0|I give this women major credit. Its hard to learn a new language, then make a hit record with it. The songs sound very different then her old music, but she still gives a wonderful performince through this album. And she has proven that nothing is going to stand in her way. Although i would be lying if i said this was her best. Its good, but &quot;Donde Estan los ladrones&quot; is my favorite. I recommend it to any music lover! But CD earns every star given.( By the way, when are we going to here from &quot;Magia&quot; and &quot;Peligro&quot;?
0060007737|1.0|The authors seem to think a company's success rises and falls on branding alone - no other factors (pricing, promotion, distribution, product quality, etc) are relevant.  I suppose if you make your living taking consulting dollars from companies you need to build a mythology that branding is a mystic and powerful art that only highly paid professionals can master. They probably think the Titantic wouldn't have sunk if it had been branded better.<br />Many of their examples are poorly defended.  As one reviewer put it they allow the reader to think of plenty of counterexamples.  <BR>The book would be much better with more analysis of success creation instead of repetitive bad-mouthing of 'bad moves'.  For instance, they mention how Black &amp; Decker successfully created the DeWalt brand, but the authors didn't discuss the appropriate scope for it.  Should it apply only to drills?  Cordless tools?  High-priced tools?  What would be the consequenses of defining the brand along these lines?  Such a case study would have been more helpful in illustrating their points. <br />The arrogance of the author's make the read annoying, along with their neglect of the importance of marketing to the distributors as well as end users.  For example, Coke needs to be in thousands of resturants, stadiums, and vending machines before it gets to consumers.  This has ramifications on the breadth and scope of product line, not to mention distribution.  Any marketing department has to consider factors like this, but the book oversimplifies all matters to branding decisions.  <br />There are a few good points, however, about line extensions and cannibalization.  Take the rest with a grain of salt.
0452282152|5.0|Jan Vermeer's paintings thrill me. They are so finely rendered that you can almost touch the velvet, the nub of the pearl, the satin. <BR>This book does justice to Vermeer's artistic skills.<BR>It is historical fiction at its best- a speculative piece of work based on a woman who  is the study of one of Vermeer's better known paintings &quot;Girl With a Pearl Earring.'<BR>In Chevalier's novel, the &quot;girl&quot; is Griet, a young Dutch girl of the poorer classes who becomes a housemaid in the Vermeer household. Through her eyes we see the nuances of family life-Vermeer's ever pregnant wife, bratty daughter, mother in law- and we also view the somewhat rigid class structure of Holland in the 1660s.<BR>Griet is a gritty, gutsy girl, who is struggling to survive with her dignity intact in this world. <BR>I would recommend this book to those who enjoy historical fiction and character driven plots, particularly female-themed. <BR>It is a beautiful read.
0375422307|4.0|I just got the book yesterday afternoon and I finished it yesterday evening.  While the art wasn't the greatest (but the author never professed to be a professional artist to my knowledge) the story was gripping and takes the reader through the whole course of human emotions.  Th author's story also highlights how American and western &quot;intervention&quot; (to be nice...) in the affairs of others can come back to haunt us (Iraqis attacking Tehran with f-14s?  Both sides attacking each other with chemical weapons made in Germany?).  It does make you appreciate your freedom and realize the value of fighting to save it from those who think that the people don't know what's best for them, at home and abroad.

B00005JLT5|5.0|I full appreciate and endorse the idea that there will be one film in your experience that brings home the horrors of the Holocaust for you, and after that point nothing else has quite the same effect.  This is true for me and actually came when I was editing out commercials of the television mini-series \\"Holocaust,\\" which had none of the graphic depictions found in theatrical films such as \\"Schnidler's List\\" and \\"The Pianist,\\" or even later television efforts such as \\"War and Remembrance.\\"  But just because the full horror truly overwhelms you that first time and never with quite the same force again, does not mean other similar tales are not worth the telling.  I know I will never see a film that conveys the horror of war more than the opening sequences of \\"Saving Private Ryan,\\" but that does not stop me from seeing more movies about World War II.<br />\\"The Pianist\\" is an atypical story of a European Jew during this period because the title character, Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody is his Oscar winning performance), survives the Holocaust.  There is a memorable shot of Szpilman walking down the street of the Warsaw ghetto after the deportation of the Jews and the streets are littered with their possessions.  Hundreds of characters in the film, thousands from the ghetto, millions throughout Europe were exterminated by the Nazis.  Szpilman is the exception, not the rule.<br />The horror of his survival is that is so random and very little of what Szpilman does contributes to his being alive at the end of the film.  The explanation, such director Roman Polanski provides in this film, is that Szpilman has value as a classical pianist, a cultural icon of sorts to the people of Warsaw, whether they are Jewish or not.  That is the key factor in the decisions, often impromptu ones, that save Szpilman's life.  But there is also the factor of luck, whether it is both German and Russian soldiers being poor shots, or simply where you stand in line.  You can see where the story would resonate with Polanski, who was pushed through the fence of the concentration camp by his father, who also survived.<br />In many ways \\"The Pianist\\" is a fitting counterpart to \\"Schindler's List\\" as a different sort of survivor's tale.  In Steven Spielberg's film the story is heroic because of the effort to fight the system and the odds (Oskar Schindler ended a lot high on the list of AFI's Heroes this week than Moses).  But there is little of the hero in Szpilman.  Instead he is a witness, who often has to do nothing more than look out the window to see both the atrocities committed by the Nazis and the turning tide of the war.  He is a mute witness as well, as much by temperament as by his vocation, although there is only one piano piece in the entire film where we sense that he is articulating his feelings rather than playing what he has been told to play.  But Brody plays many scenes without ever uttering a word and despite the title very few scenes have music if his character is not the one playing it.<br />The Pianist falls between triumph and tragedy, which may well prove unsettling to many viewers who want the security of provided by such categorization.  I have seen comparisons to the second half of this film with Castaway, and while I understand the comparison it falls through simply because Szpilman is a less than active agent in his own survival too many times.  But that is just another small reminder that The Pianist is history and not fiction and that the greatest horror is not the we are the victims of a grand design but rather of the arbitrariness of the fickle finger of fate.ory would resonate with Polanski, who was pushed through the fence of the concentration camp by his father, who also survived.  <br />In many ways \\"The Pianist\\" is a fitting counterpart to \\"Schindler's List\\" as a different sort of survivor's tale.

B000023VR6|5.0|Still a gangsta after all these years, Dre proves again he is still one of the the most elite out there. It starts with an intro on Dre's low rider and shoots right into The Watcher a song about the how much things have changed in today's world of rap.Still D.R.E. is an excellant reunion with snoop. The real gem is Big Egos which has an excellent beat and perfect lyrics, Hitman could have an excellent career.The skits work pretty well, CAr Bomb fits right into Murder Ink with a Halloween sample, Pause for Porno is defintiely uneeded but Edu-cation is hilarious. Eddie GRiffen is the bomb
0316666343|5.0|No, this book is not great literature... but not all novels have to be of epic scope and majestic language to be extremely enjoyable. I loved the story and the point of view of this novel, and it was just right for a weekend on the couch kind of read. It was sentimental to the extreme in some parts, but... I didn't expect it to be anything else.
B000007T1M|5.0|Frightening and exhilariating at the same time, system of a down's self titled album, is a fericious blend of Rage Against the machine style poltical lyrics and numetal guitars, <BR> The singles are very strong considering they were never really overplayed, Sugar is strange song, and spiders is a blast at the government's proposal for the v-chip. WAr? is probably my favorite song alongside darts, a very interesting view on religion and a propeace song. the worst songs are suite pee and know, the only songs i really skip, perfect for those dark and stormy nights
B00005KFUN|5.0|The first song i ever heard from Muse was off of a live video clip from their Hullabaloo DVD called &quot;Microcuts&quot;. It sounded like an opera gone awry filled in with some of the coolest guitar I've ever heard. I decided to look into them more and I am now obsessed. If you're looking for good new rock, MUSE IS THE ANSWER!! <BR>I've never listened to Radiohead before (and I don't really care to), I didn't listen to Coldplay or any of those other British rock bands so trust me, you don't have to be into other British alt-rock bands to enjoy Muse. <BR>I urge you to look past vocals for this album as well. Mathew  Belamy's expert guitar and piano playing bring out the best of this album alongside Chris Wolstenhome's intricate and creative basslines. This is by far one of the greatest bands I've ever heard and I can't wait for their American splashdown.
B00007E8V4|4.0|With maybe the exception of Innervision, none of these songs can really be considered sellout songs. Chicnstu is the real gem on the album with a hilarious hard driven guitars to some very tasty lyrics. F**k the system is the most poltical song besides Boom! intersting concept from an interesting band
B00008PX8P|5.0|Finally a dvd that shows Led Zep in all their power!! Any young band that's out now and even those hair bands from the 80's should watch this and learn something about how this is really done!! Great quality-both sound and picture...A MUST!!!
B000000993|5.0|Undertow is a mind bending assualt on the senses with the hypnotic sober and heavy songs like bottom and swamp its no wonder this is the greatest nu metal album of the 90s
B000088E6D|4.0|With the exception of the vastly overrated modern &quot;classic&quot; Moondance, this CD surprised me by the range of (admittedly pop) selections included.  I was particularly pleased with the inclusion of &quot;That's All,&quot; one of my all-time sentimental favorites and one inexplicably omitted from most such collections.  (I don't think Michael Feinstein or Ann Hampton Callaway has included it on any of their CDs yet.)<br />Definitely a man to watch as his voice matures.  He already reminds me of Sinatra.
B000002LQR|5.0|Although not as mature as many of their future albums, this was the cd that made their careers. Songs like breaking the girl and under the bridge show their emoitonal sides while raunchy hits like give it away contradict themselves, <BR> The guitars are perfect and the vocals match perfectly, both innovative and amazing it is sure to be sweet
B00005ASHM|5.0|Pet Sounds is the greatest album ever to me. It makes me think why the Beatles are more famous than the Beach Boys. Brian has got to be the greatest song writer in hostory. I especially like &quot;God Only Knows.&quot; First time I heard it I fell into tears. My favorite song however is &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice.&quot; Its been my favorite Beach Boy song of all-time. I guess because I'm 13 and I'm still a kid ,but this song will be in me forever.<BR> Pet Sounds has got to be the best album ever. No surfing just feeling. Although the fast songs are great those love songs make the Beach Boys my favorite band. If you haven't heard the album you should and you wouldn't care if you died at that moment. There would be Hell just heaven. I suggest you listen to the album, you'll love. I garentee it.
B00001W9G0|5.0|I was there.  It was the late 1960's and it was the best time to fall in love.  Many of the scene's, especially the ones on campus, Schenectady's Union College bring back the best memories.<BR>This movie is great and made these two wonderful stars even more<BR>wonderful.  I wish they could do a movie where they are rejoined<BR>in this same format.<BR>Watch it often, you will get a sense of real love and devotion from them to you.
B000002UAU|5.0|This is not the best Beatles work, but is one of my favorites.<BR>The interesting fact here is that this is the first record that The Beatles made without thinking in performing it. This gave them a lot of freedom.<BR>The best song is, by far, John's &quot;A Day In The Life&quot;. Maybe is the best vocal performance The Beatles ever did.<BR>Lovely Rita, Getting Better, She's Leaving Home, Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds, With A Little Help of My Friends, Within You Without You, Mr. Kite, Fixing A Hole, Sgt. Pepper, Good Morning, When I'm 64; is the way I list the Cd from best to not too good.<BR>The Beatles are the best.
B000002KXO|4.0|I think all three of Stevie Nicks songs on &quot;mirage&quot; are among her best. Gyspsy may be Stevie Nick's best song ever. Straight back is simply enchanting. It should've been released as a single because it would've been a big hit. The only reason it wasn't was that the band tried desperately to not become Stevie's back up band. That's all right is kind of a country song. I've found myself singing to this great song many times. Christine McVies songs on this album are pretty good too. Hold me is one of her best. Love in store is another good tune, Of which Christine has consistently produced over the years. Only over you and eyes of the world deserve mention as well as both are good songs. Lynsey Buckinghams songs, however, are barely tolerable or boring at best. What in the hell happened to him? I know he can put together better songs than the ones he did on this album. When his songs are more polished, they are much more ear friendly. However, all too often since Tusk, he just hasn't been the same, too experimental for my ears.

B00008O31H|5.0|I bought this album based on a great review it got, and I now think the reviewer undersold it.  This is the best album I've heard this year, and I'm not a big blues fan.  It's hard to believe that this rich, blues/rock that seems to fill every space is the product of a 2-man band.  Dan Auerbach is an amazing guitarist whose low-gear playing more than takes the place of a bassist.  His gin-laced voice is the perfect complement to his infectious rhythms.  While I can't find a B-side on the album, &quot;Set You Free&quot; and &quot;No Trust&quot; are particularly rocking pieces that will have you singing along wondering who needs 4 guys in a band.  And don't expect any \\"my dog left me\\"-boo-hoo blues - this is a wall of sound with driving guitar and screaming vocals.  Simply put, it is what all blues should be:  dangerous and yet grooving.  You'll wear out your speakers listening to this, trust me.
B00005221L|4.0|One of Arnold's better movies.  The Predator is defenitly one of the better movie monsters of all time.  There is a lot of corny dialogue in the begining which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars.  The DVD has a good amount of extras and the picture and sound quaility is good.  A little known fact though, the original predator was actually played by Jean-Claude Van Damme.  You can tell the difference between the preadtor in the begining of the movie and the end.  The director wanted there between a considerable difference between the predator and Arnold.
B00000J7JO|2.0|I feel sorry for the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  It must be hard to keep up the energy and vitality and fire and emotion that exudes from Blood Sugar Sex Magik and other earlier albums.  I can picture the musicians recording this album--particularly drummer Chad Smith--just beating away to yet another song with the same groove as 39 of their other songs.  I believe that RHCP still want to innovate--and their skills are musicians are formidable--but this album is not the forum.  There is nothing new here.  It's still RHCP--Kiedis' focused, penetrating vocals will not disappoint--but the album lacks the freshness and punch of earlier works.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|I just keep listening to this album over and over again. Everything is here: Beauty, passion, melody, harmony, and innovation.<BR>Because these artists are loaded both with talent *and* artistic integrity, I find that it doesn't really matter what style or content they choose to express themselves in--anything they do gives me pleasure to listen to.

0385504209|5.0|I am not a huge reader of fiction and tend to read far more non-fiction, but I simply could not put this book down.  I found the story fascinating from the first page to the last.  There are lots of surprises along the way, and the pace of the story is breathtaking.  What made the novel so appealing to me is that it is chock-full of true facts about all sorts of places and things, and the author weaves this information into the story in a very naturalistic way.  Thus, to a non-fiction reader, this was the best of both worlds: a fictional story grounded in reality.  Don't pass this one up; it's like nothing else I've ever read.
6304913176|4.0|Gosh, is this movie fun!  Beautiful (yet shallow) characters, heart-pounding action, jaw-dropping special effects, and witty, biting satire run roughshod across the screen as STARSHIP TROOPERS delivers adrenaline-induced entertainment.<br />Having not read the Robert Heinlein novel, I approached this film with no preconceived notions.  I immediately was struck by the movie's funny, yet effective, satire of a global, militaristic super state, perpetuated and enhanced by nonstop propaganda (\\"Want to know more?\\").  Yet the satire takes a back seat to incredible action and special effects, along with an eye-opening shower scene that raises men and women in the armed forces to a whole new level.  (Where do I sign up?)<br />Director Paul Verhoeven gives us bugs, bug guts, bug brains, and more bugs in an intergalactic struggle between man and beast.  I got a hoot out of watching \\"Doogie Howser\\" (Neil Patrick Harris) play a young mastermind in psychological operations; I got even more of a thrill watching gorgeous Dina Meyer and Denise Richards shake, rattle 'n roll.  STARSHIP TROOPERS never takes itself seriously, which only enhances the fun it brings to the screen.  Pop this puppy into the VCR and enjoy.<br />--D. Mikels
B00006690F|4.0|This album has it all...the regular Eminem ...talkin disses, Eminem singin, Dr Dre, D-12 and great lyrics. Ever since I have had this CD, it hasn't stoped playing.

Below is my track rating (1-5):<BR>Curtains Up (Skit): 1 (very short intro)<BR>White America: 5 (expresses Eminem's surprise because of how people feel the same as he does)<BR>Business: 5 (Great song)<BR>Cleanin Out My Closet: 4<BR>Square Dance: 4.5<BR>The Kiss (Skit): 2<BR>Soldier: 5<BR>Say Goodbye To Hollywood: 4.5<BR>Drips: 3<BR>Without Me: 5 (the single, great, like his others)<BR>Paul Rosenberg (Skit): 1<BR>Sing For The Moment: 5<BR>Superman: 5<BR>Hailie's Song: 5++ (EMINEM SINGS!)<BR>Steve Berman (Skit): 1<BR>When The Music Stops: 5<BR>Say What You Say: 5<BR>Till I Collapse: 5<BR>My Dad's Gone Crazy: 5++ (features Hailie)<BR>Curtains Close (Skit): 1<br />*Limited Edition DVD contains a music video, Eminem's movie trailer, and concert excerpts.*
B00008LDPU|5.0|Though a few segments fell flat for me (&quot;Matriculated&quot;, &quot;World Record&quot;), the others more than make up for it.  Combining anime creators with the Wachowski's post-apocalyptic vision was a stroke of pure genius.  &quot;Second Renaissance&quot; plays as a prequel to the first film, sort of a pre-history of The Matrix.  &quot;Final Flight of the Osiris&quot; and &quot;Kid's Story&quot; serve as a go-between, bridging the first and second films.  The others are kind of an anything goes approach, but attain a cohesiveness in style and theme. &quot;A Detective's Story&quot; has a downright tangible future noir feel that I can't recall seeing since Blade Runner.  The ghost story &quot;Beyond&quot; manages to be spooky, fun and beautiful all in the same frame.  The extras on the DVD are great fun as well, extremely informative, and packed with clips of the anime those interviewed are referencing.  The soundtrack CD -- available separately or in a two disc gift pack -- is the equal of the film, a great CD that'll likely stay in your stereo for some time.  Nicely done, and a must have for any Matrix or anime fan.
B000089RVX|5.0|The CD is one of a kind. It has a lot of things dealing with sadness, but it also can calm you. It's my favorite CD to listen to over and over agian. It has helped me through a lot of times.
B00004Z400|5.0|WIth this, their third album,the Deftones have become one of the best metal bands in recent memory.  This is by far their best album yet.  The songs Change and Elite are two incredibly written songs.  Add on Digital Bath and Back to School along with every other song on this album and you get a masterpiece.  This is one of the few hard rock/metal albums that you can listen to from beggining to end and not hear two songs that sound alike.  Aside from Mudvayne's L.D. 50, White Pony was the best album released in the year 2000 and it is definetly top 5 hard rock/metal albums of all time.  It is a must have for any hard rock/metal fan.
055357342X|5.0|After growing up on a heavy diet of Tolkein, McCaffrey and Ursula K. LeGuin, and then progressing to other fantasy authors such as Piers Anthony, I was somewhat doubtful of the rave reviews Martin was receiving for this particular series. Yet after reading all three books non-stop, I can say this is the best fantasy series I have ever read. Other currently acclaimed works from authors such as Robin Hobb, pale in comparison. In short, this is an extraordinary, marvelous series that will keep you enthralled and guessing to the very end. I can't wait until the next installment.
B00005YW4H|1.0|This is vapid.  Music for people who think they should listen to jazz.  You know, stuff you put on to make people think you are hip and so it is in background while you try out your moves.  I think it is more the double entendre of the first hit.  Yes, I suppose it is funny, but at some point you have to look at it musically, where it falls flat.  I rate as one star as a jazz CD, but maybe two or three if you just want to pretend to be in an elevator.
B00006879E|4.0|Add me to the list of those who had never heard of Maroon5 until seeing them open for Sugar Ray &amp; Matchbox 20.  Their performance of &quot;This Love&quot; is what led me to buy their CD right there at the show.  It's a GREAT song to hear live, and the CD version sounds every bit as good.
B00008977N|3.0|After owning the VHS tape and putting up with muddy sound and slightly grainy video but still very much enjoying the concert I kept sending emails to the Peter Gabriel website asking when a DVD version would be coming out and finally it did.  <br />Having read the other reviews I would have to disagree with the negative reviews on the video side, on my system the video is quite crisp with solid colors and I see no Macrovision artifacts.<br />However, the sound mix is extremely disappointing to me.  Although the clarity and crispness are what I have come to expect from DVD multichannel digital mixes WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LFE (Bass) Channel ?!!!???!!  Sometimes there are slight bass differences between Dolby Digital versus DTS but in this case both mixes have serious issues with the LFE track, its almost non-existent.  I have directly compared several songs from the VHS to the DVD side by side and although not as clean or distortion-free, the VHS mix has a much stronger bass line.  One of the prior reviews mentioned Tony Levin should turn his bass up, well he did have his bass turned up and listening to the DVD my subwoofer is barely breathing compared to the VHS mix.  As a huge Tony Levin fan from his King Crimson days to his solo appearances and sit ins with the California Guitar Trio the clarity and power of the bass signal was one of the items I was most looking forward to from the DVD.  I do not have a spectrum frequency analyzer but to my ears there is very little content below 60hz.<br />I also have to agree with a slight time alignment issue with the vocals and the picture, apparently my receiver (Onkyo Integra DTR 9.1) has some compensation for that so I will have to try that out but overall I was so upset about the lack of bass it is hard to listen/watch the DVD much anymore.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This motion picture record of Led Zeppelin's existence is important to those of us who weren't there.  As far as I was concerned, the actual existence of a real \\"Led Zeppelin\\" was a myth, more than a legend.  Led Zeppelin belonged to the same realm as The Moon Shot, Zeus, and Elisha, who resurrected the axhead from unreachable depths of water.  In 1991 I first heard Led Zeppelin, rescued from the darkness of Punk Rock by a dear friend who gave me Led Zeppelin II.  I was 18 years old.  But did the same four people really produce those nine albums?  Surely not; otherwise, God created the world in 6 days, and that's just too much to believe.  There are so-called \\"witnesses,\\" people who were there during Led Zeppelin's 11 years, but those people call themselves baby boomers.  Who of them can you believe?  No, the evidence was too great: \\"Led Zeppelin\\" never existed.  \\"Jimmy Page\\" did not play the guitar that way over the course of a decade.  No, no, no.  It's impossible.  Those 9 albums are the combined work of a thousand rock bands, a thousand guitarists and singers and organists and drummers recorded over a thousand years, compiled into nine albums for the sake of conspiring against the children of the baby boom, to teach us about rock and roll by means of a lie.  It is a conspiracy.<br />However, with the release of this DVD, another brilliant Jimmy Page production, the evidence is reversed.  There they are: four British young people on stage, playing that phenomenal rock music at the Royal Albert Hall.  There they are again at Madison Square Garden, a little older, but playing the so-called \\"Led Zeppelin\\" music.  Finally, they reappear at Knebworth, mature and wielding the hammer of the gods.  In truth, they had that hammer from the time they appear in that uncomfortable French TV special (you have to win a war to appreciate the exuberance of rock and roll) till Robert Plant bids adieu from Knebworth.  Unless this a conspiracy beyond any I've named above, then thisis indisputable proof that these gods existed.  They really are real.  But now my world is upside-down.  If Led Zeppelin really existed, then perhaps Elisha did resurrect the axhead.  And like the resurrection, Led Zeppelin still exists and still rocks!<br />Robert, Jimmy, John Paul, John, it's been 35, and you're welcome.

The characters are believable and three dimensional, the writing is fast and crisp, and the plot leaves your heart racing.  The head of the Louvre is murdered in an inaccessible part of the museum, but that is not the mystery.  He has also taken off his clothes, arranged his body so that it would be found in a certain position, and has written a message in his own blood.  Then the plot gets interesting!

B00005JKPF|2.0|I thought X-Men #1 was the best of the comic book movies but X2 lacks the pacing, suspense and drama of the first, so it seems to go on forever.  Add the...German character and all that's left is the wonderful exchanges between Patrick Stewart and a the truly wonderful Ian McKinnon.  I could watch those two play chess for 2 hours but the others are a yawn.  Femke does look almost exactly like a young Stephanie Powers which is interesting.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is definetly one of my fave CDs and one of the best. I don't think they sound like Linkin Park, however. Amy's voice rocks on every song. My favorite songs are Everybody's Fool and Tourniqet. GO BUY THE CD!
B00001U0E1|5.0|\\"Shakespeare In Love\\" has to be one of the most romantic movies I have ever watched. You are immediately are drawn to the characters and into their lives.<br />The film revolves around William Shakespeare and his quest to write another play. With competition all around him, he knows that his next play must be something great! The other main character in this film is Gwyneth Paltrow's character, who loves the words that Mr. Shakespeare writes. Paltrow's character disguises herself as a man in order to audition for a role in Shakespeare's upcoming play. Soon the two characters are falling head over heels in love, which would be wonderful, but Paltrow's character has been promised to another and she must fulfill her duties in order to save her family.<br />The chemistry between Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow is electric! They really make you believe that they're in love and cannot get enough of each other. Even though I didn't like the ending very much, I would definitely recommend this film! There is definitely a reason why this film won the best picture award at the Oscars - it's just plain wonderful!!!!
B000066NW0|5.0|This is such a good album, and she is such a good artist, anyone who doesn't like her should review their tastes!  If I could award the album more than 5 stars, I would definately rate it that.  Avril Lavign is the coolest!  Rock on!
0156027321|3.0|This book, though in many parts beautifully written (the sequence of the hills that lead to a different religious leader is a standout), has many lofty expectations, but drops the ball one too many times.<br />The book has little to no narrative for the first 100 pages.  Sure, it's educational (if you're interested in zoology), but far from entertaining.  A big misstep the author makes is in shattering any wouldbe suspense with lines that are total &quot;give aways&quot; as to the duration of sequences.  (Eg. Within the pages of the Pi's fourth day on the boat, Martel tells you that he would not be found for another 223.  Therefore, any hopes that he may be saved/spared are lost.)  Martel should've let the reader feel the hopelessness of the situation for themselves, instead of giving us a cheat sheet into the futures of all involved.  (He makes similar mistakes when discussing the fates of the hyena and Richard way ahead of time.)<br />Though somber, emotional, and practically poetic, the book is about 100 pages too long.  The book's claim to make the reader believe in God is unusual and (worse) doesn't achieve its goal.
B00006LI4S|5.0|David Gilmore live is like a breath of fresh air. This DVD adds a splended array of genuine talent and sound that everyone should experience. The DVD also ceases to amaze me, everytime I watch it, which is often. <BR>I grew up nearly twenty miles from Mr. Gilmore, and have had the pleasure of meeting him numerous times. I've always been a huge fan Pink Floyd's music, especially w/ Mr. Gilmore at the helm. He seems to add a presence to their repertoire, that only extends my love for their music. This DVD is both the reflection of Pink Floyds past and the present of Mr. Gilmore himself. Very...very...very nice sound quality and picture (crisp and clean). Buy this DVD and your life will change for the better.
B00003CY6M|4.0|I really enjoyed the film &quot;Serendipity&quot;! This film revolves around two people who meet by chance and instantly feel a connection. Wanting to believe that what they feel is fate, they decide to embark on an exercise to decide if they're really meant for each other involving a book, a name, and a phone number.<br />John Cusack plays the perfect romanctic male lead in this film and Kate Beckinsale does a good job as the female lead. You immediately feel the emotions of both characters as they try to come back to one another.<br />I would definitely recommend this film to all those who love a good romantic comedy! This film really makes you believe that you can find true love anywhere, and that everyone has their own perfect person out there for them, no matter what other people or circumstances may come in their way.
0688163173|3.0|This book is clever, and finally, almost too clever for its own good.  For those who've seen a recent film called &quot;Identity&quot; (with John Cusack), it's a close kin.  Lehane's book is better than the film.  Somehow, one thinks that the writer of &quot;Mystic River&quot; and &quot;Drink Before Water&quot; might be slumming.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Interpol are wonderful--can we agree on that?  Number two on this CD is perfect.  You can't listen to it and say it isn't, I'm sorry.<br />Now, I know people are doing what they love to do, which is comparing current bands with old ones, and sure, that makes sense, this sounds a bit like other people at times (I'm sure you've heard the Joy Division comparisons and all...) but you know what?  Those bands aren't around anymore.  Sure they were great, but can you go see them now?  No.  Can you catch their bassist DJing at some club in NY?  Can you anticipate new material from them?<br />Can you be excited about the current state of music?  Yes.<br />So let's go ahead and get the comparisons all out of the way and realize that this is a great band.  Stop talking about them, just listen.
B000002JS6|5.0|Even if you ignore the fact that this is the best selling rock disc besides The Eagles Greatest hits, and even if you don't care for AC/DC's bluesy rock stylings, this album is a must have.  Starting off with the dark tribute to dead lead singer Bon Scott, the disc immediately jumps into the sombre Hell's Bells.  Following this is the underappreciated Shoot to Thrill.  From here the disc just keeps getting better.  Classic tracks include the title track Back in Black, along with the concert favorite You Shook Me All Night Long.  The remastered disc does what i thought would be impossible - it improved on the best rock disc of all time.  The sounds are clearer and sharper as Angus' guitar cuts through the heart of every song, while Brian Johnson's lyrics seem energized.  Even if you dont like rock or metal, or dont particularly care for AC/DC, and even if you own the original, go out and buy this album.  You wont be sorry!!
B00008HCCF|4.0|This is the sort of DVD that you really only need to listen to in order to enjoy it.  This is not a knock on it, but just a comment on the style of music and the presentation of the concert footage.  The feature is an hour long performance by Norah at the House of Blues in New Orleans.  She has a backing back, but the show is pretty much just Norah at the piano.  She does some cover songs as well as stuff from her album \\"Come Away With Me\\".  She also mentions that some songs are only on her previous EP, which she expects that most people do not have.<br />If you have listened to her album, you have a pretty good idea what to expect from this DVD.  She doesn't talk much between songs, usually only to introduce the next song or to say who she is covering on a song.  This may be a good thing if she doesn't have anything interesting to say, it would only detract from the performance.  This is a fairly low key performance, but her playing is amazing.  Norah Jones is a very gifted musician with a beautiful voice.<br />The only comment I have in closing is that while I really enjoyed listening (and watching) to this DVD, I don't think it is something that I would watch very often.  I'm glad that I rented it, but it isn't worth purchasing (for me).
B00008G9JO|1.0|Sorry, boys and girls, I can't think of a more nearly perfect example of banality than &quot;Good morning, weathercock/Make this day bright/Point the way to other days/We can share with you.&quot; You may happen to LIKE banality; you may concoct some sort of argument espousing banality even; but let's, please, not use words any which way. (Thank you.)<br />The musical forms here, as it happens, are simple ternary forms, conventional and unremarkable and not worth discussing one way or the other. Let's be rhetorically honest, shall we?<br />Is this a pastorale? It doesn't matter: A good reviewer critiques the EXECUTION, not the intention. The title song is actually one of the better songs here, and its lyric makes manifest that its author is intelligent and articulate, but it is not a GOOD lyric. It is awkward and affected and prosaic. (A list of horse breeds is PROSAIC.) Though we know he has musical talent as well, we couldn't, on the other hand, by this song--or by any song on this disc. &quot;Heavy Horses&quot;'s vocal line and chord progression are distinctly unoriginal and worn threadbare. Neither do they comport with its words.<br />In short, this recording doesn't hold a candle to &quot;Songs From the Wood&quot;, a fortiori &quot;Stand Up&quot;, &quot;Benefit&quot;, &quot;Aqualung&quot;, &quot;Thick As A Brick&quot;, and &quot;A Passion Play&quot;.
B000006MS3|5.0|One listen and I knew that this was something special.  I already had &quot;Sensual World&quot; and was impressed but not blown away.  Now keep in mind it took me at least 3 listens to declare Yes's &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; a masterwork.  &quot;The Dreaming&quot; is a sonic wonder and a marvel of a recording; with techniques and arrangements like I've never heard (and I have over 150 great CD's).  To say even more is that I've never found the female voice to be very effective emotionally.  I guess it's the fact that I tie in womens' voices with relentless feminisitic pleas.  Though I am skeptical any Kate Bush album can rival &quot;The Dreaming&quot; I cannot pass up any other critically hailed album of hers. She's infected me with her musical vantage.
B000089RV6|5.0|THIS IS ONE FANTASTIC CD.WHEN I HERE ANY OF THESE SONGS IT MAKES ME WANT TO GO OUT AND GET STINKING DRUNK AND CROW LIKE A ROOSTER.BUY THIS.
B00005JLT5|4.0|No one who cares about Roman Polanski's work should miss this DVD's taut documentary about \\"The Pianist\\" and its director.  Billed as a making-of featurette, \\"A Story of Survival\\" transcends that reliably lightweight genre on the power of Polanski's words and vivid recollections.<br />The director tells his personal story clear-eyed, almost matter-of-factly, but with heart. As he speaks, images from Nazi camera crews are intercut with nearly identical clips from \\"The Pianist,\\" showing how the director used WWII film archives to ensure authenticity of the movie. The making-of includes recent footage of the real-life Wladyslaw Szpilman playing a Chopin nocturne (the pianist died in 2000).<br />Polanski says he chose the autobiography of Polish musician Szpilman because it was written right after the war, when the memories were fresh. The book's detail of the Nazi occupation was \\"vividly true to me, a child of the same period,\\" Polanski says.<br />\\"The Pianist\\" looks fine, up to major studio standards. Audio is generally OK, in DTS and Dolby Digital 5.1, with a fairly tame mix that makes little use of the rear sound stage. Center-speaker dialog is noticeably muffled at times. The DVD opens with the studio's usual ads for upcoming films, particularly obtrusive given this film's subject matter and tone.
B00005JLK0|4.0|This film has been unfairly maligned by the critics. I personally loved it. I thought the plot was original, an excellent cast of actors. I was not to crazy about the ending but this movie is not useless waste of film the critics have made it out to be. A great movie for Sunday night.
B000002J1S|5.0|In the pantheon of rock operas and concept albums, nothing even comes close to the greatness of the Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, except perhaps Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (and it's debatable whether that really counts as a concept album).  Everything about this album - the story, the lyrics, the musicianship, the melodies, the chord progressions, even the liner notes - is mind-blowing.  I could write for hours about how this is the best album ever made, but it's pretty much all been said here.  After all, it has an average rating of 5 out of 5... for a reason.  Get it, and if you don't like it, seek help.
B00008BXJ6|5.0|ITS A LONG WAY TO THE TOP AND THOSE OF YOU THAT THINK THAT BRIAN JOHNSON IS BETTER THAN BON SCOTT SHOULD LISTEN TO THIS CLASSIC AND FIND OUT WHAT AC/DC WAS ABOUT.THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST PARTY ALBUMS OF THE 70`S.
B000089RVX|5.0|this is one of the BEST albums i've heard in 2003! EVANESCENCE (evan-esence) <br />i usually don't buy an album without thinking about it for a while but when i heard 'bring me to life' on one of the music channels i loved it<br />a few months i'd see clips of it and think this is stupid but when i listened to it more i loved it so i went to a music store and bought it.<br />Amy Lee is probably the best vocalist (except janet jackson and christina aguilera) i've heard one of my favourite songs on the album (although i love all of them) is 'haunted'<br />here's how i rate each song:<br />GOING UNDER: 5/5, it's a great combination of gothic rock and the vocal tones on this track are brilliant.<br />BRING ME TO LIFE: 5/5 as i said the first clip of the video i saw i thought a suicide woman climbing a building? but when i watched it i really liked the video and the song!<br />EVERYBODY'S FOOL: 5/5 this reminds me of a song that would be on a soundtrack to a PG-13 'teen' movie but it's still a really good track<br />MY IMMORTAL: 5/5 when i listened to this on Amazon i didn't like it but it must've been the clip of the song so don't let that sample fool you it is a nice ballad with a simple melody<br />HAUNTED: 6/5 this song is GREAT! the starting verse is good because the tone of voice Amy uses<br />TOURNIQUET: 3(1/2)/5 it is an ok song a good rock song (obviously) it reminds me of a rocked up hym<br />IMAGINARY: 4/5 this is a good song but the chorus of it is like an infomercial for candy or somthin, the rest of the song is brilliant too<br />TAKING OVER ME: 4/5 this song sounds like a previous song on the album as do some of the later ones<br />HELLO: 3/5 well let me say this, it isn't the best song on this album it does give a hint of 'my immortal' in it<br />MY LAST BREATH: 3/5 this is another song you'll think you've heard before!  that is the only annoyance of this album a bit like 'imaginary'<br />WHISPER: 5/5 this one reminds me of 'going under' and 'haunted' really good choir in the backround in parts especially at the end<br />so in conclusion this is the best album of 2003<br />my most favourite songs are 'going under', 'haunted', 'everybody's fool' and 'whisper'<br />i love this album just as long as they keep making albums i'll be happy and thank god their next single is 'going under' cause it's a brilliant song
B000089A07|2.0|The reason for the recreation of this cardboard version of the superiorly filmed \\"Manhunter\\", was the wasy of cashing in on Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal, visually in all three films. Brian Cox wasn't what I was thinking off a serial killer in that role, but still played it well. Maybe cause we didn't see him do anything harsh or terryfying.<br />Hopkins is an awesome Hannibal, yet seeing him aged , and yet being in a prequal was laughable. Edward Norton is one of my personal fav actors. Here, his monotone, and hardly expressive character of Grahm was so hard to watch, especially with his talent he can and didn't progress  here. William Petersen was great at playing the emotional turmoiled and tortured FBI Agent we were sympathysing with . <br />Emily Watson and Ralph Fiennes stole this wafercracker show. If this HAD TO BE REMADE, then these two are the strength. Emily Watson was such a great character, as well as Ralph, still lacking SOME of the fridgid and psychoticness of the other actor who played the original Tooth Fairy. Fiennes was bruding though. Cool.<br />I really like Brett Rainer's films with his fast paced directing and energy. Here, it just works like a machine without feeling (hardly). More like a RAdio Shack ROBIE coin collecter robot than a human experience. <br />Micheal Mann is a captain of crime drama and mysteries with terror filled sequences. Brett Rainer will have to watch Manhunter again to see what he messed up on, and then get the ball rolling with his fun packed series Rush Hour, with installment #3.
B00008AWOD|5.0|After three years, London-based rock trio Placebo has finally arrived with long-awaited fourth album, Sleeping with Ghosts. With their previous three records all hitting top 10 in the UK, the expectations for the new album are, to say the least, elevated. Then it is with no small amount of pleasure that many fans, after having heard the new tracks, pronounced Sleeping with Ghosts Placebo's best album to date. I, for one, am inclined to agree.  <br />Taking their cue from the likes of DJ Shadow this time around, Placebo cleverly sidestep the pitfalls that dance/electronica influences often represent, and manage to fuse them effortlessly with their unique style. The arrangement chosen to showcase the music has a lot to do with this - in general, odd-numbered tracks on the album lean toward their old, guitar-driven approach with trademark 'insect buzz' distortion and simple punky rhythms; whereas even-numbered tracks showcase their new direction, with a couple of quiet, piano-led tracks to close off.  <br />The album opens with a sinister, frenzied instrumental reminiscent of the hidden track 'Evil Dildo' from second album Without You I'm Nothing, but as the record wears on, this quickly proves itself to be a red herring as to an indication of where the album is heading. Track 2, 'English Summer Rain', features vocalist Brian Molko on drums, providing a bouncy vibe and melodies you can't help but sing along to. 'Special Needs' is another highlight in a similar style, with lines like 'remember me / when every nose starts to bleed' exemplifying Placebo's usual lyrical perversity. How VERY Brian Molko!<br />'The Bitter End', the first single off the album, did well in charts worldwide. The sound is typical Placebo, with a little more melody than previous material. This newfound love of tunes features throughout the record, with is all the better for it. Placebo's old, arse-on-fire running-with-guitars style sits heavily on tracks such as 'Plasticine' and 'Second Sight', and 'This Picture' comes across like a close relative of 1998's 'You Don't Care About Us'.  <br />The title track is more than a highlight. Upon the first few listens it is already elevated to a status equal to despondent Placebo classics such as 'Without You I'm Nothing' and 'My Sweet Prince'. Stealing a couple of lines from Les Miserables, this a heartbroken anthem backed by sparse electronica and a gorgeous tune. \\"Soulmates never die\\", laments Molko in his remarkable helium-laced voice, bringing to the fore blatant emotional intensity and fierce love.  <br />Musically, Sleeping with Ghosts is marvellous. The band has struck gold with the heady mix of electronica, their signature trashy lite-punk and Molko's constantly above-par vocal performance. Though the words are competent enough, it doesn't ever get back to the lyrical genius exemplified in their earlier, dirtier work. (ah, ye goode olde days of 'Nancy Boy'...) But overall, that's a small price to pay. This is a dazzling album, a must-have for every Placebo fan and many more people besides.
B00006GJ9P|5.0|Is this it? It certainly is, This c.d. is one of the best cd's i have seen in the last 5 years. Why? 1. originality 2. Beautiful Lyrics 3. Awesome base lines, guitar lines, drum lines, and vocals. All of the songs carry a sence of emotion. The song &quot;NYC Cops&quot; brings a Raw, energetic feel, that complements every other song. &quot;Is this it&quot;, their first album, makes a good first impression, and i believe that if their cards are played right. They will go far. <BR>     As Far as the video's are concerned, I thought that they were excellent. It's amazing to me how care-free they get sometimes. Julian , the lead singer, is drinking heineken right in the middle of songs, for crying out loud! They all smoke cigarettes, and have fun! And could care less what other metal-heads and Punks think about them. They bring the coolest message a band could ever concieve.....&quot;Can't we all just get along&quot; (and party, and drink)
B00005AQE8|5.0|Tupac Shakur is hip hop and rap's premier embassador of the ghetto and street life. His profound mother, Afeni Shakur, raised him to be a intelluctual leader to fight against the troubles of the black community living in a \\"white man's world\\". All Eyez On Me is Tupac's fourth album and first since his bail from Rikers Island. This CD contains all of Pac's accumalitive thoughts and ideas that he grasped from books and his experiences in his troubled life. Book 1 contains all of the released singles, and demonstrates his Westside style in tracks like \\"All About U\\", \\"2 of Amerikkka'z Most Wanted\\", and \\"Cali. Love\\". The production is good on this CD and his mostly done by Deathrow producer Daz Dillinger. \\"I Aint Mad At Cha\\" is definetly the CD's best song. The catchy piano laced background melody cradles Pac's lyrics of his thought of death. \\"Only God Can Judge Me\\" and \\"Life Goes On\\" are two tracks that embarse Tupac's lyrical capability and also compensate his thoughts on death. Book 2 alone can be sold as a seperate CD. The style and production is a bit different but still keeps that Pac flavor. Tracks like \\"Shorty Wanna Be a Thug\\" and \\"All Eyes On Me\\" make you realize how unique Tupac was. \\"Picture Me Rollin\\" is the best laid back cruisin song that anyone can jam too while riding in their car. Dr. Dre produced \\"Cant C Me\\" gives you that Westside feeling with a \\"bump\\". All in all, The greatest rapper to ever spit calls himself 2PAC. Nobody will ever surpass his accomplishments and number of songs put out. All Eyez On Me cannot be critiqued or hold one's opinon, yet only one can judge Pac and a world can listen to his talent.
B000009EUM|4.0|But still this has some great songs and is a highlight from<br />the 1980's. I found &quot;Hunting High and Low&quot; more uniform but<br />I do feel &quot;Scoundrel Days&quot; shows Aha taking more chances, much growth as a group, and Mortens incredible vocal range has no rivals.  I agree<br />with a reviewer it was a sound in transition and not everything flowed together quite as well as the first one, but there is a quality here that transends the pop sheen and the media image<br />Aha had taken on and it needed repeated listens to really feel<br />this music.  Like the first<br />collection I play this one quite a bid and it could use a remastering to bring out the little things from this highly<br />underated group.
B00006F7XJ|3.0|\\"A Nod And A Wink\\" may not be as strong as its predecessor RAJAZ but it is a strong effort and a very pleasant listen for all camel fans. I highly recommend the purchase of the album to any progressive rock fan and note that the Import version of the album includes a great instrumental bonus track \\"After all these years\\" which is excluded in this version. Try buying the Import version to enjoy this great Camel song in addition to the finest moments such as \\"Simple Pleasures\\", \\"A Boy's Life\\" & \\" For Today\\". Andy Latimer's passionate playing still shine here. Long may you live CAMEL!
B000066AXE|2.0|This is to me, a classic example of critics being in love with a movie for its \\"movie qualities\\" but the finished product stinks! Get out the gas masks and the pooper scooper for this one! <br />Though the movie is mildly entertaining in the middle portion of the movie for about 15-20 minutes, the opening of the movie is very boring and the ending very, very cheesy! I understand that this was based on a true story, so the ending is what the ending is, and if this movie hadn't of been so over-hyped it wouldn't alteast had the \\"let-down factor\\" to it!<br />Best thing about the movie is Jennifer Connelly, great actress and what a hottie!<br /> However, I can not believe that this movie won Best Picture of the Year! Actually, on second thought I can believe it - it is always these boring movies with some supposendly \\"meaningful\\" storyline and sappy ending that win in Hollywood. What a joke!
B00008DDXL|4.0|The first harry potter film was way better but the same can be said for the books in my opinion. The 2nd book chamber of secrets was my least favorite so i should have figured the film wouldn't be great since the book kinda [stunk] compared to the others. They did a good job on alot of the CGI were the film did lack in SS.
0393317552|5.0|Diamond offers an interesting, somewhat unpopular view of the evolution of human societies. Despite criticisms to the contrary, I find the flow of his discussion to be very well organized.  He takes us on a journey through a number of intelligently illustrated variables which, in his view, were key to the disparities among the   development of various societies and cultures. However, this work is in no way a complete discussion, as he fails to touch upon the role that organized religions have played in shaping the history of the search for power, wealth and dominance.
B00004Z459|1.0|It's just sad these guys get the best hard rock award in every awards show when there are better bands out there that should have gotten the award. These guys don't even fit in the rock or metal genre. While some of their songs are a little bit of rock, most of the CD fits in the rap/techno genre. They're also more of a boyband. They don't have any talent so they must be a boyband, except a little on the heavy side. To those who like this band, you'll hate them the more you see them on on little kidde channels such as WAM!
B00008OWZC|4.0|Put simply, because of the superior sound, the length of the set (3 CDs), and the breadth of the tunes available (spanning their first five records), this is the best Led Zeppelin live CD available.  It was recorded at two shows L.A. in 1972 (just prior to the release of \\"Houses of the Hold\\"), almost a year before the Madison Square Garden show that was the basis of \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" and long before the recently released \\"BBC Sessions\\" (1969-1971), at a timet some fans consider the nadir of their live acumen.  Here is a song-by-song (with the songs not previously released as live versions marked as \\"*\\"):<br />1. \\"Immigrant Song\\".  Although not as tight a performance as the earlier live version on the BBC CD, this version is a bit meaner with a more interesting guitar solo at the end.<br />2. \\"Heartbreaker\\".  The extended guitar solo in the middle section is one of the guitar highlights of this set.<br />3. \\"Black Dog\\".  The band had benefits from getting a little more mileage with this one than the 1971 live version on the BBC CD and it shows.<br />*4. \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\".  One of my main complaints of 'The Song Remains the Same' (recorded less than a year later) was the song choice from 'Houses of the Holy' - this is a favorite that should have appeared, and now, here it is.  The opening and closing guitar parts are a bit messy (as this was a brand new song), but Plant's vocals make it a highlight of this set.<br />5. \\"Since I've Been Loving You.\\"  Nice version of this original blues tune, especially for those who saw 'The Song Remains the Same' and wished it was on the record. <br />6. \\"Stairway to Heaven.\\"  Although not as intimate as the version on the BBC sessions, technically, this stadium version is cleaner than the performance on 'The Song Remains the Same'.<br />7. \\"Going to California\\"<br />8. \\"That's The Way\\"<br />*9. \\"Bron Y-Aur Stomp\\".  As with the BBC CDs, there is an \\"unplugged\\" portion of the show, and while the versions of \\"Goingto California\\" and \\"That's The Way\\" are similar in quality to the versions on the BBC CDs, the inclusion of \\"Bron Y-Aur Stomp\\" is really special - much better than the original.<br />10. \\"Dazed and Confused\\".  This makes the fourth live version of this tune, which got longer and longer as time went by and Jimmy Page became more and more indulgent.  That said, I prefer the longest version on 'The Song Remains the Same', although this one has an interesting interlude with a piece of the then new song, \\"The Crunge\\".<br />11. \\"What Is and What Should Never Be\\".  Nice performances by all the members of the band, but this version adds nothing to this tune which had such a memorable studio production.<br />*12. \\"Dancing Days\\".  At the time of this performance, it was a new song, and as a result, this live version adds nothing to the studio performance.<br />13. \\"Moby Dick\\".  This is an infectious riff, but how long can a drum solo be?  This is the longest version of this one ever released - 19:20.  Enough said.<br />14. \\"Whole Lotta Love\\".  Of the four live versions of this popular favorite, this one is the longest and perhaps most misguided.  As with the other versions, the inclusion of a medley with \\"Boogie Chillin'\\" in a song dripping with sexuality is appropriate, but \\"Hello, Mary Lou\\"?!  What is interesting is the similarity between the riff in \\"Going Down Slow\\" (included in this medley) and the Led Zeppelin \\"original\\", \\"Dazed and Confused\\".<br />15. \\"Rock and Roll\\".  Due to the fine guitar overdubs, giving it that 50s sound, I always considered the studio version of this song to be definitive.<br />*16. \\"The Ocean\\". Of all the \\"new\\" songs peformed on this set, Page and Plant appear to have the most fun with this one.  The vocal performance is especially nice.<br />*17. \\"Bring It On Home\\".  This is easily the high point of the set for me.  The guitar and harp are fantastic, and it may be better than the original version.  Interesting note - Willie Dixon is credited as the writer under the song title, and Page/Plant/Jones/Bonham are credited parenthetically for the \\"Medley contain[ing] Bring It On Back\\".
0393320928|4.0|I just can't get enough of this guy !<BR>Still in the spirit of the first book 'Surely you're joking', but a slightly more serious follow up with some repetitions. Here the reader sees Feynmann dealing with the love of his life- his first wife Arline, the Nobel prize and much later the investigation into the Challenger tragedy. This time the hero is better developed and we get to see a more human side of Mr Feynmann in addition to the curious character. Given that he is no longer with us, this book will be treasured as much as the first. Readers unfamilar with the first book will still be able to enjoy the adventures of this remarkable scientist.
0385504209|3.0|From time to time Alfred Hitchcock made what he liked to call &quot;refrigerator movies&quot;. These were films heavy on plot and rather quick moving that took the viewer a long for a ride so thrilling and intense that he or she wouldn't pick up on the gaping plot holes until later that night, getting their midnight snack in front of the fridge. The Da Vinci Code is a lot like that. While some little things don't make sense right off the bat, most of the story holds up well until you've read the whole thing and can look back at how it's all put together.<br />The characters, as many hear have said, were thin and never did anything surprising. The plot moved very rapidly, though, and manages to keep you engaged until nearly the end. However, the last three chapters or so are complete head scratchers, and not the good kind.<br />I picked this up on a recommendation at a time when I was just looking for some light, fun reading. The Da Vinci Code certainly provides that. I think with summer right around the corner this will be a popular &quot;beach book&quot; and you could do a whole lot worse than this. Just don't look for any deep meaning and enjoy!
0393316041|4.0|Mr Feynmann has shown us that while it pays to be good at what you do, life is far more interesting if you poke your nose into things you know little of. There are people who complain about how boring life is. Mr Ofey has shown us that the joy of discovering things can keep us young forever. I am sure if he lives to a thousand years old he will still be the same curious character we all love. Like most who read this book, I am sad that we can no longer enjoy his antics. This book changed my life.
B00000DFRS|5.0|I grew up hearing Whitney's dancy late 80's/early 90's tunes like &quot;I Wanna Dance With Somebody&quot; and &quot;Queen of The Night.&quot;  To some, the new sound from &quot;My Love Is Your Love&quot; may be too much of a change, but for other's it's very much appreciated.  Ditching her previous producers, Whitney took in the incredible Clive Davis as the Executive Producer and she did all the vocal arrangement. The result? A magnificant and stunning collection of upbeat and slow jams.  Working with such big names as DarkChild (most noteably working as Brandy's top producer), Babyface and Diane Warren (songwriter, &quot;Un-Break My  Heart&quot;).  The great thing about this album is that unlike others which are composed of some filler tracks there is no highlight to this disc.  It starts out with some of the radio singles which is a good thing, but does not dissapoint from there.  The opening number &quot;It's Not Right But It's Okay&quot; is classic DarkChild and was a great first single.  Got more airplay on the R&amp;B charts but had good remixes and got good club play.  Soul Divas Kelly Price and Faith Evans accompany her on the soulful &quot;Heartache Hotel&quot; which is not a remake of the Elvis classic but a R&amp;B  masterpiece. Babyface produces one of the albums  highlights which is the power ballad &quot;When You Believe&quot; featuring Pop Diva Mariah Carey.  It was originally from the cartoon film &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; but Whitney and Mariah make this song their own.  Whitney's rich voice and Mariah's light/ary powerhouse voice meld together perfectly.  The Clive Davis influences are prominate on &quot;My Love Is Your Love&quot; as &quot;If I Told You That&quot; another DarkChild song incorporates piano chords in the beginning and throughout.  Fans of Missy &quot;Misdamenor&quot; Elliot will not be dissapointed as well, for she writes/produces the groovy &quot;In My Business&quot; and &quot;Oh Yes.&quot;  I'd have to say that one of Whitney's best ballads (although &quot;Where Do Broken Heart's Go&quot; definately still holds the title as her best ballad) is on this disc: &quot;I Learned From The Best&quot; produced by hitmaker David Foster (the mastermind behind her hit &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;) and written by Diane Warren.  I would consider it a good update from her En Vogue hit &quot;Too Gone Too Long.&quot;  Another favorite of mine is when two of my favorite producers/songwrites come together for a beautiful song: &quot;I Bow Out&quot; (Babyface and DarkChild). Who would've thougt it would work? And  don't forget the title track written and produced by former Fugee's member Wyclef Jean, &quot;My Love Is Your Love&quot; which is *definately* a Whitney classic and is one of R&amp;B's best songs ever.  Overall, if you enjoyed some of the radio singles and are a Babyface, DarkChild, Diane Warren and Clive Davis fan then get this album.  This is by far my favorite Whitney album.  Though her newest effort &quot;Just Whitney&quot; has some hot tracks and is almost as good, &quot;My Love Is Your Love&quot; is my favorite. A+

B00008PX8P|5.0|Led Zeppelin is without a doubt the greatest rock and roll band of all time.  And when you watch this DVD and you'll realize that their greatness was there from the beginning.  Jimmy Page is absolutely unreal!!!  If you're a L Zep fan then buy this DVD and ENJOY!
B00005YW4H|5.0|I purchased this CD only hearing the 2 or 3 songs they play on the radio, not knowing what else it had to offer.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that best songs are not the ones they're playing on the radio.  Nearly every song on the CD is a winner!
B00004TWZF|5.0|\\"The Big Blue\\" is a mini-epic that provides a sensational visual treat via its wonderful cinematography.  The film follows the relationship between two childhood friends - one French, the other Italian - who grow up to become rivals in the world of free-diving.  Jean-Marc Barr, as the young Frenchman, is astonishing.  His character is palpably uncomfortable in our world above water - his dream is to become one with the sea.  Jean Reno is both amusing and touching as his super-macho Italian friend who is determined to be the best, or die trying.  Add a bubbly Rosanna Arquette to the mix as an American reporter who falls hard for the young Frenchman.  Their final scenes together are both heartbreaking and transcendental.  This is the type of film capable of stirring up your emotions in more ways than one; you will marvel, you will laugh, and you will cry.
B00000DCHI|5.0|This excellent anthology contains all of Billy Joel's classic early hits as well as two new songs; &quot;You're Only Human&quot; and &quot; The Night is Still Young&quot;.  The first disc covers the years 1973-1977 and includes such greats as &quot;Piano Man&quot;, &quot;The Stranger&quot;, and the concert classic &quot;Scenes From an Italian Restaurant&quot;.  Disc two covers the years 1978-1985 and contains &quot;&quot;My Life&quot;, &quot;Pressure&quot;, and &quot;Uptown Girl&quot;, among others.  But what really makes this cd great is the two new songs, especially &quot;The Night is Still Young&quot;.  The vocals and insturmentals on this track are top notch, and this song alone is worth the price of the cd.  This cd is a must for all Billy Joel fans.  Don't forget the Greatest Hits Vol. III disc as well!
B000002H33|5.0|Maybe the best.  Buy it.  Nuff said.
B00008HCCF|5.0|I was not sure if I'd like jazz music.  I'm not really into jazz.  However this DVD is great.  The 5.1 sound mix is terrific and the small quaint club setting really makes you feel like you are there.<br />Norah has a very nice voice.<br />One reviewer commented on how sweaty Norah was during the concert.  I find all that perspiration makes her look really sexy.
B00005N5S5|4.0|I thought that this movie was perhaps one of the best movies of the eighties.  Arnold is great in this movie, and so is Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn.  It has a great storyline and a very intricate plot.  There have been many other reviews so I will not go into plot detail but I will tell you why I didn't give this movie 5 stars.  1] Reese leaves Sarah ALONE to get supplies??!!  How stupid of him and then he gives her a PISTOL to protect herself while he is gone!  PLEASE.  After all his hard work protecting her he leaves her alone.  Wow.  2] When Sarah is making the bombs for Reese she is screwing the cap and she does it a little too hard and he tells her \\"gently, gently\\".  Then a short while later after he tells her he loves her he gets mad at himself for saying that and he goes to the bag and starts literally throwing the bombs in the bag.  He is too smart for that I think.  Oh well some minor flaws but overall the movie was good.
B000089A07|3.0|This movie replaces nothing. It is 30 minutes longer than Manhunter because it shows how Lecter was captured as in the book. The cast does a fair job, Hopkins is very good in this reprisal of the role, originally done by Brian Cox. Hopkins gets far more screen time than Cox got in Manhunter. It would be interesting to see if there was more footage of Brian that could be incorporated into a rerelease of Manhunter. Ed Norton is weak trying to imitate the excellent job that William Petersen did in Manhunter. Harvey Keitel ,who is a great actor, does not come across as a member of the FBI. Dennis Farina played the part perfectly. Mr. Noonan who is very tall was a more powerful &quot;Tooth Fairy&quot; Dolarhyde, he was in control. I can't help feeling that to many of the actors were trying to copy Manhunter. This movie dragged too much. I recommend you rent both movies you will &quot;see&quot; what I mean. I am not familiar with this directer, you would think they would have hired a director with a known past for this project.
B00008PC2O|4.0|Terminator 2:Judgment Day Extreme Edition DVD is not exactly the fully loaded DVD that the Ultimate Edition(one of the best DVDs ever!!)is,however it makes a great companion piece to that disc.The special edition of the film is featured on disc one-picture quality is amazing,and the Dolby Digital EX 5.1 sound is just like from the previous release,excellent.There is a Dolby headphone track(designed to simulate 5.1 sound in headphones if I understand correctly),but no DTS as in the previous disc.<BR>Also on the first disc is an interactive mode that features a text commentary track and branching video clips.(haven't checked that one out yet,but it sure sounds cool!)Plus there's an Easter Egg to view the theatrical version of the film.<BR>On the second disc there is a documentary about the way T2's digital effects have helped revolutionize the way visual effects are done.Also there is an 8 minute montage of behind the scenes footage(very cool!)<BR>There are several DVD ROM features on disc 2 as well.<br />The real reason I wanted this set rests back on disc one,and that's the feature length commentary track by director James Cameron and co-writer William Wisher.<BR>It is an OUTSTANDING commentary,and hard to believe it's Cameron's first.He and Wisher give an extremely easy to listen to track that is packed full of info,and never boring for even a second.(now if only Spielberg would start doing commentaries!!)<br />Overall,if you're a fan of T2,I'd highly recommend the Extreme Edition,for the commentary alone,if nothing else.<BR>But hold on to that Ultimate Edition!
B00008PW3Q|2.0|Sorry, but my comment is not about the content of the album. I bought this and put it into my computer, which I use as my stereo. Won't play. Thanks to the great thinking of the record company, they only way I can listen to this is by downloading the &quot;illegal&quot; bootlegs off the internet. Beware--if you use your computer to play music while you work, this CD is useless.
B000002JSV|5.0|Amazon's editorial on this album is dead wrong.  You want a trancendent moment? Listen to Down Payment Blues.  This album may not contain a hit, but that is the entire reason you will not tire of it.
B00006BTCA|5.0|I heard this CD playing in an HMV shop in London's Picadilly circus. Asked the guy what was playing and he said Interpol. Never heard of them. Actually bought the CD at Heathrow on the way back to the US. The track I heard originally was very retrospect 80's to me, hence the draw. When I started to listen, I was a little disappointed but on the second and third listen, I got it. I am a big Blue Nile fan and this had some resemblence. The tracks just seem to build cleverly, draw you in and leave you feeling and sensing the song long after it is finished. Sometimes I just want to go back and play each track again before I go on. The last track is awesome and I would recommend this CD for anyone looking for a clever update to new wave music they liked in the late 70's and 80's. Buy it.
B00005UWCV|4.0|If your gonna mess with history go all the way let her kept the crown and return to the ball. Why bother having her put on a fancy dress and crown only to have it wrecked?   Lenin would have made a better villian. It seems the creators wanted to keep the mystery alive at the end but why? fear historians would attack them like they did to Disney for Pocohantos?
0446677450|3.0|Although this book is not perfectly written it is worth reading.  This book is based on a single key concept (easily explained in a one page summary).  The author did not invent this key concept; however, the author's long winded explanation may be helpful.<br />This book is not reference material - suggest purchasing used or reading a library copy.  You will only read the book once.
B000065U1N|1.0|I just have to say that this movie was an absolute disappointment.  I love war movies; in fact, they are my favorite genre.  And I've seen them all.  But this one lacks substance.  It is a war movie for the sake of gore.  If there is a plot to it, it is lost behind the overkill of the blood, gore, dismantled bodyparts, etc.  I strongly recommend seeking viewing pleasures outside this movie.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I think the new Led Zep DVD is a very credible representation of the small amount of really good visual recordings of the band. It has been cleaned up and looks and sounds as good as can be with help from state-of-the-art equipment. I think all Led Zep fans will love this collection. Most of the footage contains actual synced performances: the images you see are different camera angles of the performances you hear. This is great and remains true to the &quot;live and uncut&quot; nature of these vintage<BR>films. While I personally think The Song Remains the Same is very good concert film (except for the hokey fantasy sequences) it also has footage spliced in that does not go with certain portions of the performances as well as overdubbed &quot;fixes&quot; to the soundtrack. You wont find much of that in this new DVD. And the performances are all genuine: Jimmy page has not gone in and &quot;fixed&quot; much, if anything. This is one of the things that makes all this so great. These performances were all very improvisational; no number was ever played the same way twice. Sure there are mistakes; the band veers of into impromptu jams that sometimes dont work, there are many technical mistakes by all the players (not just Page),the PA systems were archaic and noisy,the productions looked shabby, even their clothes are pretty silly sometimes. It was also quite normal for both the performers and their audiences to be quite stoned in those days!<BR>And guess what? I love it! But those who give a bad rating to this DVD just dont get the point: these guys were innovators. Back in their day no one had ever seen or heard anything like them. Led Zeppelin redefined the rock experience and made it bigger than life. They were great players but werent perfect, which makes them human. They were constantly pushing the limits of their abilities and challenging themselves and their audiences. How boring it would have been to hear Stairway to Heaven played exactly like the album nightafter night. This was what a real rock concert was like in the early years of the big loud stadium bands! Somebody had to invent it, and here are four guys who were there at the beginning! And so I highly recommend this sound and visual Led Zeppelin experience to any and all who love real rock performances by real rock musicians, from a time when you could'nt hide lack of talent behind multi-effects processors,drum machines,lasers,samplers,tattoos and nose-rings! Bring it on Home!
B00006LLNU|4.0|I'm a person who likes to take different tracks from different artist and put them onto one cd.<BR>When I bought Sigur Ros, I wanted to add just a few songs from the album, (), to my own personal compilation.<BR>I have a cd software that extracts tracks from the cd itself.<BR>When I did this with Sigur Ros's (),  up came titles for all the eight songs.<BR>So if this is what shows up, then how can it be an album with untitled tracks?<br />Here is what the tracks are titled :<br />Track 1.

B000002B2T|5.0|This album is one of the top 10 albums made in the years between 1990 and 2000.  For pure artistic quality, this album stands along with Alice in Chains', TooL's, Nirvana's, Soundgarden's, Smashing Pumpkins'and Nine Inch Nails' albums for pushing the boundaries of accepted musical norms.  There is so much to be said for the lyrical content in this hour long piece of canvas that it is better left out of words and left IN the music.  Once you have given this treasure one listen, you will feel what can be seen, see what can be touched and hear the sights of gorgeous, beautiful, artistically created perfection.  Witness the beauty in the music and you'll feel the meaning of these words flowing through you, a bee-line to your soul, a comforting pillow for your soul's mind to rest upon.<BR>This album is a gift.  <BR>Seek the answers to your soul's queries- they'll lead to unto this soundscape of wanton abandon and sheer mellanchollic and therapeutic sound art.<BR>Those who have not heard dwell on a plane devoid of sonic perfection and joy.
0451450523|5.0|The unicorns have all gone, but one remains behind...<br />This is an incredible story.  Beagle does an unbelievable job writing this using metaphors and language that sweeps a reader off their feet.  <br />The message in this story is subtle and yet so blatant, depending on your age.  A young adult will appreciate the adventure, romance and suspense but may miss the tender under workings.  Those of us with a few years under our belts will love the moral and will weep at the ending but will reflect that Beagle's magnificent cast of characters is only living life as we all do, even if they are kings, princes, magicians and unicorns.
B00008LDPU|2.0|What is the Animatrix? Nine very short and uninspiring animated shorts. The good part? You'll realize this after 2, and turn it off. Last Flight of the Osiris is another Final Fantasy. If you liked that movie, you'll probably love this DVD. However, the vast majority of humanity did not. Some of stories don't even fit in with the world already created in the first two movies. Creativity? Yeah... but it's missused: perhaps even abused here. The 'Anime influence' is terrible... almost Samuri Jackish. The writers took all the anime cliches and threw them together to make their story. The Animatrix is a terrible mix of cliches of many genres. <BR>Don't believe anyone that tells you this is necessary to understand The Matrix: Reloaded. If you want to understand it, go see it again. As for the Animatrix, unless you know you prefer animation over soul, or you are the type of guy that gets off on animated-half-nudity, take the blue pill.
B0000009OP|5.0|Morphine does what great bands do - they find their groove and stay there...slipping around a strong back beat and keeping the production sparse and clearly defined.<br />This a great album. I love &quot;Head with Wings&quot; the most. You can not go wrong with this....unless you're waiting for gutar solos....
B00005JMFR|5.0|Neo using powers outside the matrix?  It was the other ship using the weapon?  Is the future world another matrix in a chain of matrix within the matrix?  Is the whole story the dream world of Neo, and every human being has independent dreams?<br />  I would like to think that neo really could use his powers outside the matrix in the real future world.  HE said that he could feel them coming.  Are the machines entitys that exist only if we think they exist?  Isn't God the same thing?  God only exist if we think He (or She) exist.  Are the machines dependent on our will?  <BR>  I think that the movie trys to tell us that the social system only exist if we think it exist.  As a matter of fact, society is an invention of sociology.  If we choose to, we can \\"shut down\\" the system that opress us if we have the will to do it.
B00005QHPQ|4.0|If you like dance ballads then you'll like this album. Fills the gap Ricky Martin didn't bother filling.
B00006L9ZT|4.0|My advice if you really want to 'get in the ring' is simple. Start buying the Met version and then move on to the Chereau version. Off course both versions are not perfect, hence the four stars, but they are as good as it gets now. Each version has its strongholds. Here is a quick comparison per Act/Scene:<BR>RheinGold I (Bayreuth wins staging and singing)<BR>RheinGold II (Met wins)<BR>RheinGold III (Met wins)<BR>RheinGold IV (Met wins)<BR>Walkuere I - III (Bayreuth wins landslide)<BR>Siegfried I (Bayreuth again)<BR>Siegfried II (Bayreuth wins narrowly)<BR>Siegfried III (Met wins convincingly)<BR>Goetterdaemmerung (Matti Hagen wins this one for the Met)<br />Pretty even to me and good reason to get both sets.
0440234743|3.0|It's OK but I would not buy another book by Grisham.
0694003611|5.0|I am lucky in that my 17 month old daughter has always loved story books.  Goodnight Moon is one of her favorites.  When she was nine months old our pediatrician recommended we start her on a bed time schedule.  Every night for months we read this book as the last step before bed.  The tone is soothing and the pictures are calming.  Every once in a while she will bring me something else to read, but almost every time it is Goodnight Moon.  There is a reason this book is a classic and is still so popular today.  I make sure every new mother I know has a copy.
0385504209|3.0|I loved Angels and Demons- and I really enjoyed the subject matter in Da Vinci Code but if I could guess what was coming with the plot line it was obvious.  I never try to figure out mysteries I enjoy letting them unfold in the read.  I had this one figured out way too early for my enjoyment.  Still a good book- hard to put down but not nearly as fantastic as previous works.  I learned a lot and will probably purchase a number of nonfiction works in this subject area.<br />I had to go on line and look up the art works that were described in the text and found that some of the pieces are easily mistaken (Madonna on the rocks and Virgin on the Rocks ) Some were even misnamed at a university site (astron.berkeley.edu/~kalas/disksite/ pages/madonna.html) should be Virgin on the rocks not Madonna- since this is the revised toned down image.<br />Well worth the effort- wait for paperback
B000066NW0|5.0|Lavigne has shown that nothing is impossible and that your dreams can come true. This Canadian Sk8er girl has shone a light for you and shown you that there are many hard times coming in your life. Her top hit \\"Complicated\\" has a meaning that says \\"don't change who you are\\". So my favorite song is \\"Naked\\" because it expresses how to open up to people and be yourself. This is one Canadian who is the only singer I like out of all Canadian singers. That is all, Good-bye.
B00008OWZC|5.0|The title, \\"How The West Was Won\\", is proven true by the performances on these discs.  As Walter Brennan - someone else who helped \\"win the west\\" in many a western - would exclaim, \\"No brag, just fact\\".<br />There is no hype when something blows your expectations away as completely as this set of music.  Let's put it this way, if you like the studio recordings of Led Zeppelin, you will love \\"How The West Was Won\\".  On the whole, for sheer excitement and impact, these performances, as only the best acts are capable of doing, surpass the studio releases.<br />As a teen in the mid-70's, Zep was one of the key touchstone acts for me.  Yet, having only experienced them live in a disappointing 1977 concert and the rather bloated and sometimes cliched playing and preening of the film, \\"The Song Remains The Same\\", these newly released live performances are a revelation.  There is a stunning directness with a tone of sound that we don't often hear any longer in this age of overly processed sound.<br />This is a band at its most vital.  Just put on the first cd and I don't really see how you cannot come away with happy appreciation for how good these guys were at that time.  It will help, truly, if you turn it up - this is a live concert, after all! Page, Jones and Bonham could really play with virtuosity; yet they could also jam and work a groove.  Unlike the almost embarassing banter in the \\"SRTS\\" movie, Plant's raps with the audience are more genuine, direct and meaningful.  You hear Plant developing into a savvy pro: Notice how - to get the certain applause/screams out of the way of the music of big crowd favorites - Plant first introduces/announces some titles, like \\"Stairway\\".  There is a directness of communication with his words, his singing, his ad-libs that seemed to be less apparent in later years.<br />What might be the greatest test, \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" is rescued from parody.  Thirty years on, in the face of cynicism, irony and practiced snobbery that comes allto easy to most of us, this performance of \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" strips the years away to present a fresh, even inspiring version of this classic.  'It's not really such a bad song after all, Charlie Brown'. ;-)<br />There are plenty of other comprehensive reviews here. The praise in almost universally positive - and deservedly so.  Some may not like 23 minute jams like \\"Dazed and Confused\\" or \\"Moby Dick\\".  Hey, this set is worth the price of admission for just the first cd, to go back in time to discover, at least for those of us who never saw Zep live in their prime, levels of greatness even we fans never realized existed.<br />Next, the five hours of concert performances on the new Zep dvd. If the new dvd is of the caliber of \\"How The West Was Won\\", \\"Boy Howdy\\"!
B00005RFAI|4.0|This has a lot of party music which is good for parties and a couple of slow songs. &quot;Get the Party Started&quot; has a great beat and great singing. &quot;Don't Let Me Get Me&quot; is another great song and says that you shouldn't let people try to change. If you like party music you'll love this CD. that is all, Good-bye.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I've got their album meteora when it first came out and it totally kicks...The songs I like was don't stay,somewhere I belong,figure.09,faint,breaking the habit,nobody's listening,hit the floor,easier to run,and numb.I also like the session by d.j. hahn,he is tight with turntables and sampling,he can direct videos too.I'm sure that linkin park are keeping up the good work because they won a grammy,an mtv music video award and lots of awards last year.I'm a huge fan of the band especially d.j. hahn.They'll be selling records and everything since they hit it big in the year 2000 with their album hybird theory.

0385504209|5.0|A great pell-mell thriller with intriguing bits of history and and art and religioso speculation thrown in. Surprisingly well-written for its genre (and far, far more readable than the turgid Umberto Eco). Brown orchestrates the plot and juggles his clues beautifully. I have to wonder at the agenda of the naysayers on this forum--it's a slick thriller with a great hook, so why all the puffery about the accuracy of its historical speculations? (As for those who claim that's it's too predictable and they figured everything out--don't believe 'em.)
6304936362|4.0|This movie tells the intense story of the Memphis Belle and its crew. It is definately one of my favorites. The only reason I robbed it of its fifth star is that it has one shortcoming, which is that it lacked good special effects for the aerial combat scenes.
B000089RVX|5.0|IF Margo Timmons and the Cowboy Junkies had an electric charge and energy, they MIGHT sound like Evanescence.  I'm not a rock rap fan, but I was electrified by the duet from Daredevil, and I must say the the rest of the CD holds up with great soaring vocals and instrumentals.
B000005H40|5.0|Just the way every single one of these artists came together and made such magnificent music is amazing.  Here you have 6 of the finest players in jazz ever, pianist Kenny Drew, bassist Paul Chambers, drummer Philly Joe Jones, trumpeter Lee Morgan, trombonist Curtis Fuller, and of course John Coltrane, that came together, under the leadership of Coltrane, to play.  The result is one of the finest sessions ever in the history of jazz.  The soloes from every single artist are just superb.  Lee Morgan's soloes, who was only 19 when he performed on this album, on Lazy Bird is just a sample of what was to come from one of the finest trumpeters in jazz, and, being one of his very first albums as a leader, shows the genius and the strength of what was to come from one of the biggest legends in jazz ever, a pure genius, John Coltrane.

If you are familiar with John Coltrane but not familiar with this certain album you should check it out.  This is truely a masterpiece.
B00008PX8P|5.0|First off, I am a total Zep-head and have been since I was 10 years old and heard Whole Lotta Love blasting out of the radio back in 1970 for the first time. Zeppelin was my guide thru the 70's. I was one of the over 1 million fans who pre-ordered Physical Graffiti - making it the first LP to ship platinum - without any support from the press or MTV (who?) - go figure. I never did get to see them live. In 73 I was too young. I waiting in line in a snowstorm to get tickets in 1975, only to have the mayor of Boston (Kevin White - may he rot in hell) ban the group for life from Boston because some fans had ransacked the Boston Garden while waiting for tickets. In 77 they did 6 shows in New York and I couldn't afford the trip. Buying TSRTS when it first came out on video was pretty amazing at the time - just to see my \\"Gods\\" rocking but over time the tired nature of the performance came thru. Just last week, I got the new DVD (thru amazon). THIS IS A RELIGOUS EXPERIENCE!!!!! Buy it and admire what rock and roll was truly about as played by the greatest band of all time. Compare the quality of the songs, the lyrics, the technical level each member had with their instruments, the raw energy of the live performance, the almost ESP like quality they had when improvising and tell me that the Beatles, Who, Stones, or anyone else is a better all around band. I'm hoping that this DVD along with the 3 CD H.T.W.W.W. will once and for all give ZEP the place they deserve on the top of the Rock and Roll pedestal. Note: After the first week's release, the CD is number 1 on the Billboard chart, and the DVD has sold over 120,000 copies breaking the 1st week release record of 60,000 for a music video (held by the Beatles). ENJOY EVERYONE. It does not, and will never, get any better than this!
0316666343|3.0|My mother-in-law recommended this book to me, and at first I could not BELIEVE it.  The first chapter is absolutely HORRIFYING.  The story is, of course, about a murdered (and raped) young girl.  The other reviewers are right, it starts off with a bang and ends with a whimper, but I did read it in three days and it did give me nightmares, so the author certainly did touch me on some level.  I found I had a bit of trouble remembering some of the extended characters, who were thrown in by name every fifty pages or so.  I would recommend this book, but only for the strong at heart.  It didn't leave me overly happy, although I think the author wanted that to happen, in the end.
B00005JLRT|1.0|This movie was horrible. I put off seeing it in the movies and now I know why. <BR>1) Spiner should have his name as the first one we see. He is the major character in almost all the Next Generation movies and the rest of the crew takes second fiddle to him, even the captain.<BR>2) Poor scripting makes for bad comedy. Picard wanting to peel out in an 24th Century SUV is so out of character for him. Worf always finds a way to be aboard the Enterprise for all the movies even though he was assigned to DS9 and eventually became Klingon Ambassador to the Federation. Where does he find the time?<BR>3) The Romulans used to be this enormous  threat and weary ally to the Federation and they simply bow down to Shinzon? Since when did they loose their backbone?<BR>4) The space battles were the only redeeming factor abou the film. They looked great. But to believe that the enterprise lasted as long as it did against Shinzon's ship suspends belief. <BR>5) Shinzon was not much of a baddie, he just wanted to be accepted  by Picard. But he was a bit better than F. Murray Abraham in Insurrection. Nobody beats Richardo Montobaun as the ultimate trek movie baddie with Christopher Plummer a close 2nd. <BR>Don't waste your time with this movie. Buy Wrath of Kahn or DS9 to get your trek fix.
0201485672|5.0|The first chapter guides programmer to the gate of refactory. It talks about why you need it, how you do it. At the second half of the book, it provides a reference of refactory methods. Its role is like a Dictionary. And the refactory methods fit in many daily cases.
B000002H38|5.0|One of her classic CDs, this one has great music throughout.  The title track is very good, while &quot;You Bring Me Joy&quot; is right there with it.  Then there are other classics like &quot;Sweet Love&quot;, &quot;Same Ole Love&quot; and &quot;No One In The World&quot;.  &quot;Mystery&quot; isn't one of her big hits, but it's a nice song as well, and all in all there's not a bad song on it.

0316666343|1.0|I looked into this book when it was first released and I had absolutely no desire to read it but after months and months of seeing it on the best sellers list I had to see what was suppose to be so great about it so I borrowed a copy from a friend.  And before you even read it I will tell you what is so great about it - nothing.  A good read is not something you struggle through.  A good read is something that allows you to move from page to page without even thinking about.  This book was a pointless struggle.  It could have ended 6 or 8 chapter early and you would have had a better read but no you are forced to go on and still end up with nothing.  The only thing that kept me going was the idea that it had to get better but it didn't.  This book explained nothing of why we are watching this family and why they can never seem to pull their heads out.  I do not recommend this book as a purchase or a borrow but if you feel the need to read it don't buy it find someone who wants to get rid of it.

1577311523|5.0|This is the first book which successfully guided me towards actually \\"getting it\\" on a profound level. The \\"be here now\\" message is not new -- as Tolle himself says -- but is re-stated for our time. You may disagree with this or that, but the main thrust of the message is profoundly life-altering in the most beautiful sense of the word. I've read lots of \\"spiritual\\" books, and been to lots of \\"spiritual\\" seminars, churches, etc in my 50+ years. THIS BOOK has shown me something deep and powerful and true that was always there hidden under a veil of constant mental activity, virtually all of it false and misleading and fearful. Let go of guilt and anxiety. Live NOW. Peaceful joy is the natural state of being. THANK YOU Eckhart Tolle!
B00008RH3L|5.0|In one of the extras on the Miller's crossing DVD, Barry Sonnenfeld refers to the movie as &quot;A handsome movie about men who wear hats&quot; . This is an excellent summary of the film. <br />This third film by the Coen brothers established their spots as master film makers. After the success of Raising Arizona it would have been an easy move for them to start chruning out comedies left and right. Instead they dove into the Gangster genre where it again would have been simple to trun out some recycled garbage. Instead they transcended a genre and produced a film both majestic in its beauty and poignant in its commentary on the human condition. This film never bores me, no matter hom many times I have seen it. It never condescends to me. It never underestimates me. It makes me laugh, it makes me think, it damn near makes me cry. Even when put up against their later films, Miller's Crossing presents strong argument that it may be the Coen's best.
0805062971|5.0|There aren't many books that I've read that I have enjoyed very much on a second read-through.  i have read Fight Club, however, three times and have enjoyed it more each read through.  The reason I think that it stands up so well is because past the plot, the book is dense with concepts and ideas.  Many of these are missed on the first read through because the plot is so engrossing, but it allowes for a wonderfully enjoyable secan and even third experience.  The only other novel I ever read that held up so wonderfully was We All Fall Down by Brian Caldwell.  It was likewise dense with concepts and ideas in a way that made it a pleasure to read several times.  As good as that novel is, though, i think Fight Club has suplanted it as my favorite novel.
B00006IU73|5.0|For those of you familiar with the Porcupine Tree phenomenon, this is both the most synergistic and the darkest album to date.  Wilson's vision flows from one song to the next, and you will be pulled right along, for whatever purpose you or he conjecture.  Much like \\"Up the downstair\\", I cannot put the album down in the middle.  At this point I'm tempted to compare Wilson's commanding capabilities to classical composers like Brahms.  \\"Darkside of the Moon\\" held together like a set of tone-poems, but \\"In Absentia\\" is one cohesive piece.  My one concern is that we are feeding on a creative mind which is spiraling into depression.  I have a hard time falling asleep at night, with Steve's visions swimming around into my mind.  I worry what further secrets he keeps in his shed.  PT's next album may be called \\"In Dementia\\", which is likely where we all will be if we follow along.  Would Wilson recognize happiness if he found it?  Ah well, never mind!  \\"Strip the soul.  Fill the hole\\"<br />One track I would like to mention specifically is \\".3\\", which contains a subtle but well-integrated string orchestration.  The material here is a high-quality effort that reminds me of the Moody Blues \\"Days of Future Passed\\", and efforts such as ELO's \\"Fire On High\\" literally pale in comparison.  No folks, those aren't synthesizers you're listening to - those are real strings.<br />For those of you unfamiliar with PT, I recommend starting with \\"Signify\\", which is approximately midstream in the creative trail, and working your way out in both directions.  You may not realize the significance of \\"In Absentia\\" if you start with it.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Love and Theft is easily Bob Dylan's best CD in a long time. I think a line from the song Mississippi sums this album up fairly well: &quot;Things are starting to get interesting right about now.&quot; After almost forty years in the business, Dylan is still putting out some of the best music he has ever written and recorded. It lacks the passion and underlying spirit of rebellion found in his early releases, but Love and Theft stands well above the vast majority of music being recorded these days. In Summer Days, Dylan says that you can repeat the past, and in a way, that is what he has done here. This Bob Dylan is a conglomeration of all the Bob Dylans that have come and gone for; drawing on varied aspects of his musical legacy, he manages to return to the basics while at the same time offering a fresh variety of sounds and musical approaches on these twelve tracks.<br />Mississippi would be my favorite song here; the manner of Dylan's extended delivery of incredible lyrics brings to mind classic songs such as Tangled Up in Blue. If you like energetic, toe-tapping rockers, Dylan proves he won't be performing sitting down for many a year with Lonesome Day Blues and Cry a While, two songs also heavily tinged with the blues, as well as Honest With Me. Summer Days is quite unusual, combining verifiable swing music with a strong pinch of rockabilly. On High Water (for Charlie Patton), Dylan incorporates the banjo and also possibly the mandolin, while Floater (Too Much to Ask) seems to feature violin music that works especially well in the transitions. I normally would not think of violins and Bob Dylan together, but the combination works fabulously. Floater is also notable for its plucky rhythm and subtly humorous lyrics. This album also features some slow, even poignant songs which I find it hard to describe. I could actually imagine the songs Bye and Bye and Moonlight being sung by a Sammy Davis Jr. to the accompaniment of the incomparable Laurindo Almeida. Po' Boy is another slow song, but it has a little stronger guitar playing pushing it along. Tweedle Dee &amp; Tweedle Dum gets this album off to a great start, and Sugar Baby, a reflective song about looking backwards at the past closes it out on a magical note.<br />Dylan's voice isn't what it used to be, but I find the distinguished, gravel-like nature of it quite enjoyable, especially on tracks featuring a good beat and forceful lyrics. It can sound a little strained at times, but what we get in Love and Theft is the real Bob Dylan. He seems to recognize his place in history, appreciating the great days of the past but charging ahead proudly into the future. The music is what matters to him, and he presents it honestly and openly; the sense of comfort he seems to possess at this stage in his legendary career allows the words and music to emerge naturally, and I believe that is the secret of his unparalleled success.s another slow song, but it has a little stronger guitar playing pushing it along.

0385335482|4.0|CONFESSIONS OF A SHOPAHOLIC by Sophie Kinsella<br />Now, THIS was entertaining reading!  Sophie Kinsella introduces the character of Rebecca Bloomswood in the first of a series of wonderfully funny books about a Shopaholic, in this case Rebecca.  Rebecca is totally hopeless. She's living totally beyond her means, doing all she can to work as little as possible to make time for those shopping sprees, and finds herself deeper and deeper in debt.  It sounds pathetic, but seeing it all through her eyes makes the whole situation funny. <br />Rebecca doesn't seem to have a clue how bad off she really is, and she lives her life enjoying what she does best: shopping.  It's an ironic twist that she's employed as a financial journalist by the magazine Successful Saving.  She fakes her way through her assignments, and somehow ends up doing press conferences for her boss, along with other financial journalists and experts, and still manages to spend hundreds of pounds a day on frivolous things such as a pen to help keep track of her expenses. And she seems to have impeccable taste.  Only designer clothes for her! It is no wonder her boss possibly thinks she's come into an inheritance, as there is no way she could live the she does on the salary she makes!<br />CONFESSIONS OF A SHOPAHOLIC is a very light read, but I found it was done so well that I highly recommend it.  I would like to compare this book to the Bridget Jones Diary series, as the main character in SHOPAHOLIC is as compulsive as Bridget was.  As I too was once a shopaholic, (I should say I am a recovering shopaholic), I was able to relate to nearly every purchase Rebecca made using all of her cherished credit cards.  Making excuses and justifying purchases, I felt it was funny, but yet scary at the same time, as I watched her dig herself deeper into debt. And Rebecca is a character you really learn to love.  She can drive you nuts, but she does find redemption by the end of the book.  I'm looking forward to readingthe rest of the series!
B00008LDPU|4.0|\\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" was a fantastic film-- after the first half hour or so, once the excruciatingly boring setup and that ludicrous Zion rave/sex scene were finished and the action kicked in. Similarly, \\"The Animatrix\\" is a phenomenal collection of anime interpretations of the Wachowski brothers' vision-- once you get past the first three segments (which add up to approximately half an hour... coincidence?)<br />Strangely, the weakest sections are the ones written by the brothers themselves. \\"Final Flight of the Osiris\\" is an absolutely gorgeous demonstration of the capabilities of CGI animation, but it's utterly empty plot-wise, and even the central action is fairly dull-- it's mostly a vehicle for Square to show off how they can create cool skin textures. The true abomination of this collection, though, comes with Mahiro Maeda's \\"The Second Renaissance (Parts 1 and 2)\\". It attempts to fill in the backstory of how the machines came to power and the Matrix was created, but it's so nihilistic, so repulsive in its violence, it leaves a bad aftertaste. Neither side, humans or robots, is the slightest bit sympathetic; Maeda pounds us relentlessly over the head with visions of brutality and cruelty, pretentiously evoking Vietnam and Tiennanmen Square, and the effect is overwrought and didactic. Rather than enlightening, it makes you feel that if humanity behaved this horribly, why should we care if Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus win the war?<br />Fortunately, it's all uphill from that point on. Shinichiro Watanabe's segments are especially effective; \\"Kid's Story\\" (the one successful Wachowski-written section) uses a pencil-sketch style that provides incredible fluidity of motion, and its minimalist story is well told; while \\"Detective Story\\" conjures the feel of classic black-and-white noir (love the computer with the old-fashioned typewriter keyboard!) The most traditionally \\"anime\\" of the films, Yoshiaki Kawajiri's \\"Program\\", is also one of the best, once again pivoting on a simple conundrum that proves more complex than it appears; the beautiful animation, evoking the look of medieval Japan, is far more compelling than Maeda's computer-enhanced effects in \\"The Second Renaissance\\".<br />I was also quite taken with Koji Morimoto's section, \\"Beyond\\", which expands on the idea that what we think of as supernatural phenomena are actually glitches in the Matrix. The character designs reminded me a bit of Gainax's \\"FLCL\\", while the detail in the backgrounds is on a par with Studio Ghibli's scrupulous work. And I enjoyed the two films that have received the harshest evalutations from others-- \\"World Record\\" (written by Kawajiri, directed by Takeshi Koike) uses a visual style drastically removed from traditional anime, but one well suited to the story it tells; and Peter Chung's \\"Matriculated\\", while suffering a little from its overly slick CGI surfaces, takes a fascinating approach-- what if a robot were plugged into a human-created Matrix? It's a little long, but still a solid mixture of philosophizing and action, in true \\"Matrix\\" tradition.<br />The extras are genuinely worthwile: making-of features on each film, a detailed history of anime drawing on interviews from genuine experts (though I do fault it for making no mention of Hayao Miyazaki), and directors' commentaries for four films. Sadly, two of those are the two parts of \\"The Second Renaissance\\", and they shed little light on why Maeda made his piece so unrelentingly vicious. I would rather have heard Watanabe discuss \\"Kid's Story\\" or \\"Detective Story\\" in greater detail.<br />So if you love \\"The Matrix\\", this collection is definitely worthwhile; just bear in mind you'll need to skip past the dismal segments to get to the real gems.on a simple conundrum that proves more complex than it appears; the beautiful animation, evoking the look of medieval Japan, is far more compelling than Maeda's computer-enhanced effects in \\"The Second Renaissance\\". <br />I was also quite taken with Koji Morimoto's section, \\"Beyond\\", which expands on the idea that what we think of as supernatural phenomena are actually glitches in the Matrix.

6305508550|5.0|I doubt I can extol this film in any original manner, but I'll give it a shot anyway. Obviously I love Office Space. Would I be wasting a pretty good beer buzz otherwise? The only people I can conceive of disliking Office Space are company presidents, CEO's and complete morons. But, being part of America's office-working automata (and not being a moron), I can relate. I could go on all day about the great jokes, great soundtrack and great characters, but these aren't what make this movie truly great. As paradoxical as it may seem, Mike Judge's true stroke of genius was making a movie that speaks to the majority. Most movies are either fantasies, portrayals of the ultra-elite, or simply gross exaggerations by studio execs of the audience's point of view. For example, movies like The Lord of the Rings are fantasies, where any connection to the viewers' lives is purely metaphorical. Most romantic comedies involve the super-rich and/or the super-attractive, and any romantic struggles these people encounter come off insincere. Finally there are movies like 40 Days and 40 Nights, where some jaded producer thought he could play to the audience's own sexual longings by portraying a protagonist who goes a whole month without intercourse. Right. How many of us can't relate to the anguish of going a month without sex? Call it 40 Score Days and 40 Score Nights and I might begin to take interest. But back to Office Space. This movie appeals to most of us: lazy, underappreciated, unattractive people who hate their jobs and curse at office machines. All of us have felt like Peter Gibbons at one time or another. And this somehow makes our jobs slightly more tolerable, knowing that we're not alone in the corporate dirge. Peter is our hero, our messiah. We all wish we could come to work late, leave early, ignore our boss, dress down, and rip the company off big time...big time. Before this movie, there was no model, no one to show us the way. And, even though few of us will ever reach the level of enlightenment that Peter has, at least we can dream.... Pass out at our cubicles and dream.h the level of enlightenment that Peter has, at least we can dream.... Pass out at our cubicles and dream.
B000005RTG|4.0|With ego (Blackmore) out of the band, DP began to stretch its' legs a bit with some jazz and funk with CTTB.  Although an uneven album in direction, it's still great to listen to the different musical and vocal styles.  Hughes wasn't trying to sing like then ex-vocalist Gillan much on this album like he had on the previous records, and sounds grand sharing duties with Coverdale.  One reviewer stated Blackmore &quot;rocked&quot; harder than Bolin.  If you know anything about Bolin, he was more than just crushing chords and turning it up to &quot;11&quot;.  As much a maestro as Blackmore but rooted in a different musical background.  He was mostly restrained on this record.  Given the opportunity to perform more with DP, he would have probably made many diehards think hard to remember Blackmore.  Get it,listen and enjoy!
B000002H72|5.0|This album can best be described as ahead of its time. Coming out when 'grunge' music was still underground, 'Doolittle' showed that alternative music did not have to be hard. The use of melody was brought back in a bigger way with 'Doolittle'. The music has a certain maturity to it while still holding up 14 years after it was first concieved. The vocals by Kim Deal and Frank Black seem flawless and the harmonies work very well together without sounding extremely similar. From the first song 'Debaser' to the last 'Silver' the songs are similar but do not seem to copy one another, they just seem to fit well together other than a 'concept' album in which all of the songs fit a certain format and a similar theme. I would recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of music that is all over the place with no boundaries.
0060926317|5.0|I love this book through and through.  It is such an inspiration to me!  It really opens my eyes to materialism and the things of this world and that we need to appreciate other matters, such as friendship and family -- rather than credit cards and money.  I highly recommend this book.  You won't regret reading it.  It will mean something different and special to you everytime you read it.
B00009EIQE|3.0|Blues neophytes who jumped on the Buddy Guy bandwagon with his last album, the overpraised &quot;Sweet Tea&quot; will doubtless be scratching their heads at the living legend's new disc, &quot;Blues Singer.&quot; This disc is a low-key, acoustic tip of the cap to blues masters of the past. Make that very low-key. Guy's guitar is strictly by-the-book and unobtrusive on this unplugged effort; in fact, the guitar tends to be mixed so low you wonder what they were thinking. But really, that was the point: it's called &quot;Blues Singer&quot;, after all, and the spotlight is on Guy's laid-back but very effective vocals on these 12 covers that range from well-known to relatively obscure blues songs. Obviously, the inspiration is Muddy Waters' early '60s &quot;Folk Singer&quot; album, on which Guy contributed tasteful acoustic guitar. Nothing wrong with that. So, think &quot;Folk Singer&quot; but also Guy's off-the-cuff acoustic teaming with the great Junior Wells on &quot;Alone and Acoustic&quot;, recorded in 1981 and available on Alligator. Hushed, deliberate, reverential but mostly effective. On &quot;Blues Singer&quot; Guy does a fine job aping Skip James' falsetto vocals on the lead track, &quot;Hard Time Killing Floor.&quot; There are also three John Lee Hooker tunes, a Frankie Lee Sims cover, a little Robert Nighthawk and, of course, a nod to Muddy on &quot;I Love the Life I Live.&quot; Also, there's a really nice rendering of a Son House tune, &quot;Louise McGhee&quot;. Jimbo Mathus provides guitar help on nearly every cut, and exactly half the tunes have rhythm supplied by drums (Jim Keltner) and upright bass. Electric? Nope. Fast-paced? Uh-uh. Impassioned? Only partly. This is after-hours, respectful acoustic blues that one would expect to be recorded on a European label as a one-off after a festival gig. This isn't really a criticism. It works, for what it is. Guy's getting up there in years, and a down-home acoustic album of important covers is just fine; thisalbum will seem more significant later on. It's not classic, it's not spine-tingling, but you know what? I prefer this to the admirable experiment but occasional mess that was the raucous &quot;Sweet Tea&quot;. But now that he's done both extremes, how about a return to the nearly perfect electric blues of &quot;Slippin' In&quot;?

B00005JKGI|5.0|What a magical time! Sometimes I watch these late Sixties movies and think how great it would have been to lived in those times. Then I remember, wait, I DID live through that! I was a 14 year old film buff and Huge Michael Caine fan since I saw him in \\"Zulu\\" on something like Sunday Night at the Movies on our black and white TV. The Italian Job looked like a great vehicle for the suave anti-hero Caine, so I dug up a $1.50 (evening show) and was absolutely blown away. Curse you, Marky Mark for defiling this wonderful show! The gifted and perfect cast (blimey! it's Noel Coward..and wouldja lookit that-it's Benny Hill!), the music (mega-ditto blimey, it's Quincy Jones!), the breezy plot (tailor-made for dear Mr. Caine), the locations (the Alps, Rome, London), and the perfect time (the climax of the Swinging Sixties, baby!) make this a classic that no cg animation-enhanced 21st century film can touch. Can you even imagine a big budget movie today having the guts to pull off that crazy ending? I've been trying to figure out what Charlie was going to try next for decades. Good to see it's finally making it to DVD. Raise your glasses gents, for this \\"self-preservation society!\\"
0385335482|5.0|I loved this book!!!! Sophie Kinsella really did a great job of portraying the shopping obsession of Rebecca (\\"Becky\\") Bloomwood, an editor of a magazine.  Becky is trying to stay out of the red, but her sinking credit is proving to be a threat to her sanity.  Her life seems to revolve around the revolving doors of stores of all kinds - everything from big department stores to minor boutiques to...what was the name of that place where she bought that cute scarf on sale?  This book was a good laugh, and I have to admit that in some ways I could relate to Becky.  She is just a little more air-headed and irresponsible, but other than that, I think most young women can identify with Becky Bloomwood -- her managing and juggling her career and insane passion for clothing, shopping.... and her interest in men, her best friend with best intentions...and most of all, how she succeeds in using what she knows best as best she can!
0312305060|5.0|THE HOURS, Michael Cunningham's riff on Virginia Woolf's envelope-pushing novel MRS. DALLOWAY, is a pretty stunning piece of work in its own right.<br /><br />Filled with razor-sharp observation and devastating emotional interconnectedness, THE HOURS is a stunning odyssey through a day in the lives of three women, and by extrapolation, every woman and every human being.  It would be impossible to read this book and not find little bits and pieces of yourself strewn across its pages.<br /><br />What's really amazing is that Cunningham is able to stick so close to the themes, structure, and characterization of Woolf's novel, while managing to build, out of seemingly the same pieces, a story all his own.<br />What THE HOURS does so well is reveal to us the binding emotional ties that unite us all. It makes you see the similarities in ostensibly different lives, different dreams, and different words. Cunningham manages to create a perfectly balanced fulcrum on which a large teeter totter of metaphors is able to swing up and down in powerful arcs.
0790729628|3.0|<BR>The novel on which this movie was based is so superior, I have to wonder who had such an ego to basically dump the original story and produce this couldabeen classic.  The only similarities are the names of a few of the characters and the (unexplained) replacement of animals with replicants.<BR><BR>That said, I have to admit that I've watched both released versions of this movie a total of at least fifty times.  It has a darkness about it that I find compelling, but there are so many rough edges, plot mistakes, and so much general hokeyness, that I generally watch this at bed time, and fall asleep by the end.<BR><BR>Unlike a lot of folks, I much prefer the original release version (which I have on VHS, and plan to have converted to DVD one of these days) with the narration.  The script is such a POS compared with the P.K. Dick novel that a narration to put a guide for the story is a must.  This thing will never be much of a movie, and the WB executives were entirely correct in their assessment of the need for it.  At the very least, a DVD (with its soundtrack capability) should offer the option of watching it either way.<BR><BR>Those who don't like \\"happy endings\\" would I suppose agree that the original ending of Charles Dickens' _Great Expectations_ was better.  I'd disagree that the original ending of _Blade Runner_ was particularly happy, since the two lead characters were going into a life on the run.<BR><BR>This movie excels in one way, and that's the visuals -- this view of a dying future, with humans struggling against replicants for no reason they can remember, is enough to hold the interest.  And it's pretty cheap.  Just buy it, and bemoan the lack of the narration as I do.<BR><BR>
0811836363|5.0|As of last year, Ive been a Beatles fan for more than half of my life.  I got into the Beatles in a big way when I was 14, and just recently turned thirty.  In the early days, While My Guitar Gently Weeps was my favorite song of all time and George was easily my favorite Beatle. Over the years, my appreciation for all of the Beatles, as a group and as individuals, grew enormously.  Today, Id say Paul is my favorite Beatle, if I had to pick one, with George following close behind. I have all of the music the four of them made, as a group, and as solo performers, and its been a regular part of my life now for sixteen years.<br /><br />John, Paul, George, and Ringo have had a tremendous influence on my life, musically, and otherwise, so it was quite a privilege and a revelation to be able to read their own story in their own words.  I thought I knew just about everything there was to know about the Beatles.  Id read many biographies, watched the movies, the documentaries, and the Anthology series, made a pilgrimage to Liverpool and pretty much soaked up any and all Beatles trivia I could, but I was surprised by how much I learned reading the full document of their own words.<br /><br />As someone who really likes both Paul and George, I found some of the passages in the ANTHOLOGY difficult to read.  What I really saw more clearly in the book than in the videos was the schism between Paul and George & John that developed fairly early on and certainly contributed to their breakup.<br /><br />Repeatedly George mentions the dental incident in which he and John were slipped some LSD at a party by a mod London dentist in the mid sixties.  Paul wasnt there to share the experience, and refused to try LSD for several more years, despite John and Georges insistence that it would open up his mind.<br /><br />Whether or not this was a big deal at the time, its clear from Georges reminiscences that it became one later for him.  He often speaks in the ANTHOLOGY about how he felt much closer to John from that moment on, and you can really see how early the seeds for the Paul vs. the rest of the band dynamic that later intensified into the Allen Klein/GET BACK/Phil Spector snowball were planted.<br />THE BEATLES ANTHOLOGY is a must read for anyone who cares to know a little more about the lives of the four men responsible for all that wonderful music.  Its not always an easy read, but along with the arguments and disagreements, the pages also reveal plenty of laughter, great memories and touching insight.  And, as Paul sang at the end of ABBEY ROAD, all of that stuff probably balances out in the end anyway.GY about how he felt much closer to John from that moment on, and you can really see how early the seeds for the Paul vs. the rest of the band dynamic that later intensified into the Allen Klein/GET BACK/Phil Spector snowball were planted.<br />THE BEATLES ANTHOLOGY is a must read for anyone who cares to know a little more about the lives of the four men responsible for all that wonderful music.

B00005JLEU|5.0|Most modern cartoons are stilted, with unnatural motion, poor plot development, and lack of attention to detail. In contrast, Spirited Away is a masterpiece of pacing, imagination, and beautiful artistry. The plot may seem strange to Western sensibilities, but it needs to be viewed on its own terms - possibly as a fantasy in the mind of a (very imaginitive) child. Parts of the film show images of buildings and landscapes in beautiful, sharp color. When the spirits &quot;come out&quot; - the mood changes to a ghosteliness, but then clarity resumes, as if we accept this is as the new &quot;normal&quot;. Some of the characters are wierd caricatures, while others have grace and are oddly sympathetic. I'm not sure this film will appeal to all - it's strangeness may put off some, but those willing to open their minds will be rewarded. This is wonderful stuff.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I had two reservations about a Led Zeppelin DVD: (1) Like many people, I've been grossly overexposed to the relentless spinning of \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" on brain-dead \\"classic rock\\" commercial radio, to the point of developing a distinct aversion to it; (2) Preferring Zeppelin when they stuck to their blues roots, I regarded their early albums as the most interesting, and stopped buying their music after the fourth album.<br />In other words, I approached this DVD as a skeptic. Lawdy, how wrong I wuz!<br />These are thrilling, electrifying performances, with clear, balanced audio feeds, and tasteful filming and editing. The inspired rendition of \\"In My Time of Dying\\" left me in stunned, slack-jawed disbelief, with tears streaming down my cheeks. Something snapped in my mind upon being exposed to this level of undiluted string and percussion-driven ferocity.<br />This work of art, this masterpiece, ranks along with the Red Hot Chili Peppers' \\"Off the Map\\" as perhaps the greatest live concert DVD ever made.<br />If you have the slightest interest in music and live performance -- whether you like Led Zeppelin or have even heard of them -- you should own this DVD. Don't ask any questions; I wouldn't tell you no lies. It is extremely great.
B000065U1N|5.0|This was by far the best war movie I have ever seen.  Straight story line about the screw up in Somalia.  There is no preachy hollywood garbage, just a no holds barred look at modern warfare.  It gave a non combatant like me the &quot;feel&quot; of what it might be like in combat.  It is sometimes difficult to watch because of the pain and suffering endured by both sides during the battle.  Very well acted by Josh Harnett as Sgt. Eversman, and Tom Sizemore as the senior officer in the field during the battle.  I cannot say enough good things about this film.  I will also purchase the special edition which is soon to be released.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera has always had a powerhouse voice; the question was did she know how to use it? On this album that question is finally answered with a resounding \\"yes!\\" STRIPPED is not the manifactured pop album I was expecting. In fact, as soon as I heard the track \\"dirrty\\" I swore to myself that I wouldn't buy the album out of virtue. When I heard \\"Beautiful\\" and \\"Fighter\\", I changed my mind and bought the CD and to this day am very glad that I did. <br />I am an aspiring singer/actress so I know good music when I hear it, so take me seriously when I say:WOW! Xtina has an incredible powerhouse voice filled with emotion and is very different from the other talentless artists we are used to hearing on the radio. Her voice alone is enough to give you goosebumps and her lyrics are inspired. Christina Aguilera is no longer an artist in hiding, she has truly come into herself and is sharing it with the world. Xtina now has a more mature,gritty, sound. <br />My Advice: Buy this album now!
B00008K7AM|1.0|Please people, how could you give this 4 stars?  lol.  Who are your dealers?  What a dumb movie!  I watched 15 minutes of this and <BR>I said to myself; Man I must be old.  If you are a child or a stoney you will like it.  I'm sure the same people that enjoyed this movie also enjoyed Dude Wheres my Car.

0440237688|3.0|I just finnished reading the book The Giver in my 8th grade Languge Arts class. I really wasn't a big fan of the book. In the beginning it didn't really grab my attention it was really boring.It took to long for something to start building up. If I did not have to read the book with my class I would have stopped reading the book. I felt that the author made things really hard to understand and had a few things that did not even make sense. I felt that the ending was done well, but it just left to many things unanswered. Things that I was anxious to find out. I know that it lets the reader use their imagination, but still you can't end a book with that many unclear and unanswered things. I feel that if the ending were done different then maybe it would give people better closure about the uncertainty. One thing though that I did like though was how the author introduces and reveals kind of twists and turns and shocks in this book. So in conclusion if you are going to read this book expect frustration coming your way.
B00006HBUA|4.0|I'm tempted to give it 5 stars, as this was a very enjoyable picture - I'd actually give it 4 1/2.  <br />This was far better than expected, but then I expected very little.  I was afraid it would be a showcase of computer animation, and I actually found I liked Scooby, they used him just enough, but not too much.  Shaggy really stole the show for me, and it was great to see Linda Cardellini as Velma...love her!<br />I was actually surprised by the villian, and it was a perfect choice. (I'm not easily surprised, I figured out the Sixth Sense in the first 10 minutes)<br />If you are a kid, you'll like this movie.  If you are an adult who watched the cartoon as a kid, you'll probably like this movie.  I actually wish they had more of the predictable cartoon-like action sequences (running in place, ghosts sneaking up behind you, etc.)<br />C'mon people, this isn't Shakespeare, it's a talking dog that eats a lot.  Lighten up!
B000002BSG|5.0|this is for true fans of acid jazz, only a jamiroquai fan would understand.  this introduced the boys to the US, but it didnt last long.  this album also features the last of stuart zender's career as bass player with the band also.  track 10 is the perfect example of mr. zender's strummin'.  if u like bonus tracks be sure to buy the UK version, its worth it.  Jami is known for their hidden tracks...
0316666343|4.0|We'd like to think that the dead are at peace. We find that this is not true, with the introduction of Susie Salmon, being haunted by her family's attempts at living. <br />This is a lovely, moving book. I was reluctant to like this book precisely because it was hailed as such a wonderful book. I don't love every part in this book, but it is a terrific, unflinching look at some of the harsher realities of life and living, and what it means to be alive.<br />Don't read this expecting it to change your life, or break your heart (it might, but the cynics out there will probably just shrug their shoulders.) Read this because it's a good book, with characters you'll wish you really knew, and because it will at the very least, make you think a little bit, about what happens to the dead and those who are left behind.
0807282375|3.0|You've written two books that have been great. Really great. You've created a grand and imaginative universe. You right a third book that has \\"deeper meaning\\" that happens to be anti-religious. You forget what your characters are like and leave the \\"Temptation of Eve\\" anologies and instead go for a bad ending that really doesn't leave you cliff-hanging. Bad idea Phil.
0312263120|3.0|I think Dan Brown's writing has greatly improved with time and experience- either that or he's just written about more interesting and compelling subjects in his newer books. His greatest strength as a writer is in pulling out obscure, well-researched facts and throwing them into a fast paced chase to catch the bad guy and stop something from blowing up. While this book has an impressive array of facts and figures, good action, good characters, and intriguing plot twists, I think it lacks the focus that I felt was in Angels and Demons and the Da Vinci Code. In Digital Fortress, I was bounced around from David Becker's linguistic skills to Susan Fletcher's cryptography skills to the villains' own obsessions and quirks. His later books seems more tightly controlled, and thus, hooked me into the story more.<br />All in all, another fun, informative, and fast read- I finished it just over 2 hours in the bookstore- but not one I'd really care to buy. There is a code that is at the end of the book that presumably, if you paid attention to the book, you'd be able to solve, but I just don't care enough about this one to bother.

0380789035|5.0|I thought this was an amazingly complex and wonderful read. Neil Gaiman manages to tie in bits of dozens of fables, myths, and legends, and make it all work together. I finished this book, thinking- it all makes complete sense. We create gods with our thoughts, and some day (if they haven't already), they're going to be offended by our lapses in worship and our promiscuous jumping around from \\"religion\\" to \\"religion\\". One day, they're going to battle it out for supreme leadership over us. Every day, is a battle between these beings, and none of us mortals will ever know or understand. Except for Shadow.<br />The book builds up splendidly to a frightening encounter between the old and new gods of the world. But before all that, we are following the journey of Shadow, a con who was granted an early parole of a few days because of his wife's tragic death. Shadow's a simple, solid guy. He just wanted 3 things when he got out of jail. To take a bath, be with his wife, and stay out of trouble. He had no idea what he was going to walk into.<br />It's an intriguing world that Gaiman unveils, one that you almost could believe was real- one that you want to believe is real, because the alternative just makes the world seem so much paler and ordinary in contrast.
B00008A7QK|5.0|This is my favorite album of 1971 and one of my all-time favorite albums--period.  So I'm not ashamed to say that this marks the fourth time I've bought ELECTRIC WARRIOR.  The first time, of course, was on vinyl when it was first released.  I then upgraded to CD in the nineties.  Then I bought A&amp;M's 30th anniversary edition, but it's Rhino's re-release that got everything right.<br />You get remastered versions of the eleven songs on the original album, plus a number of extras:  All of the non-album UK/US singles and B-sides that were released in 1971, a previously unissued acoustic version of &quot;Planet Queen,&quot; a nearly 20-minute interview with Marc Bolan, the cardboard digi-pak maintains the look of the original release (lyrics of all songs--including the bonus tracks, a 9 x 14 poster, the drawings on the album sleeve, even the original Reprise logo on the CD).<br />All in all, this is the definitive version of a classic album. If you haven't upgraded to CD yet, this is the one you've been waiting for. ESSENTIAL
B000003TA4|4.0|All of Nirvana's songs are not depressing.  They wrote some very funny and also some very upbeat songs.  The key to Nirvana is that they had a sense of humor buried beneath tons of irony.  Kurt IS a great songwriter lyrically and musically.  Like Lou Reed before him, he learned those 8 or 9 chords and played the hell out of them and with so much heart and true emotion that it is simply awesome.  The lyrics are incredible man they get the point across in as little words as possible (true punk style).  I like complex music too, but for those who complain this is too simple then you guys are straight up music snobs and that's what Nirvana hated, damn elitists.
B000007T2Z|5.0|Three tracks totalling over an hour is just the first sign that you're headed towards something big.  Big doesn't even describe what this album is.  Enormous, epic and prodigious might be better descriptions of this album, but they still can't quite adequately portray what f#a# has in store for you.<br />Please please get this album.  Don't just listen to it, immerse yourself in it.  Shut off the lights and the telephone and let the the music take you to a place you probably wouldn't really like to see in real life.  The songs are incredibly dark, and very draining to listen to.  But its worth it, if you can invest the time commitment.  Don't cut this album short by just listening to one track.  You must experience the entire 3 songs to get the full effect of that this album has to offer.

B00003CX5P|5.0|Granted, this installment of the illustrious Star Wars series may not boast the completely unexpected, jaw-dropping impact which the original trilogy had on its now diehard fans, but the fact remains: Star Wars: Episode I has been badly mistreated in the ranks of its one-time supporters.<BR>The plot is not undeveloped, the casting is not mischosen, and its place among the Star Wars saga is not unsure.  On the contrary, this film is a very fitting continuance of the story fans fell in love with so long ago; it has the plot dripping with mystery, suspense, and intrigue, the characters complementing the story with their unique additional personalities, and the very Star Wars-like conclusion, which begs for the story to be completed in the final two films.<BR>      This movie is not at all badly written.  The plot flows smoothly from one scene to the next, and even dons unique characteristics.  The Jedi phenomenon is explained in much more detail (what some critics claim is &quot;mumbo-jumbo&quot;), and the audience is given more glimpses into their amazing abilities (i.e. Qui Gon and Obi-Wan speeding through the hallway, making daring leaps from ledge to ledge, etc.).  The lightsaber   battle(s) with Darth Maul brag incredible imagination on the part of the choreographers, and are absolutely dazzling to watch.<BR>      Overall, this film is brilliantly written and made, bewildering movie-goers with gut-wrenching suspense, a deeply woven plot, many unexpected twists and turns, and incredible special effects; with very special mention to the newly written music scores by none other than the genius John Williams.  And while it boasts all of the characteristics that make for an awesome spectacle of a movie and addition to the Star Wars saga, loyal Star Wars fans are turning their backs on it and not appreciating it for the aesthetic genius it is.<BR>      Don't think it lives up to the first three Star Wars films?  Don't compare it to them.  It is profoundly different, because it is meant to be.  It tells the story within the story, and was meant to be much different than any Star Wars &quot;fans&quot; would expect.  It's a different time, different place, you must remember.  That means different people, different places, different tales.  Be fair people.  <BR>      This is an excellent film and lives up to every expectation as a Star Wars movie as a whole.  I rest my case.
B000067CQK|5.0|I owe so much to my cousin, I really do. She has the best taste in music, and she was the one who told me about David Bowie and how great he was. I had heard of him ever since I was little, I never really gave him much thought though. Around Christmas, my cousin told me I had to download the full Ziggy Stardust album, after I did, I had experienced something brilliant in the world of music.<BR>Now, I give huge credit to the band Garbage for changing my views of music forever. Because they really did. When I bought their album Version 2.0 last year, I was changed forever. I was sucked into a magical word of rock music. And boy am I thankful. Now, back to David Bowie. He is one of those artists that is truely one of a kind. He's such an amazing individual. He has so much confidence, not to mention talent.<BR>This album is like Garbage's - not in the style, but by the way it's changed my life. Only once in a while an album will grab me and never let me go. This is one of those albums. Every song, and I mean EVERY song on here is absolutely amazing. A two disc special is also a really good deal.<BR>Velvet Goldmine is by far my favorite song by David Bowie. Every song is amazing, but that one is my favorite.<br />10 out of 10, amazing!
B00005JLF5|5.0|With the success of Star Trek: The next generation, a spin-off was inevitable.  With a galaxy of characters and adventures, you couldn't just stop with one Flagship of a massive starfleet.  Deep Space Nine was a completely different approach to Gene Roddenberry's world.  With the perfection of Earth, the chaos of the galaxy beyond it had to be brought to life to show what the Federation was up against.  DS9 was cast with dynamicly different characters who didn't always like each other.  It stuck it's perverbial toungue out at the Kum-Bye-Ya sainthood of the crew of the Star Ship Enterprise.  As time went on, the stories became increasingly deeper and more involving.  You really cared for some (Sisco, Kira, Odo) and loved to hate others (Quark, Garrick, corrupt political preists).  Unfortunately, the spirit of adventuring through the souls and lives of Characters didn't amount to ratings.  The show lagged behind for most of it's entire run.  Attempts to boast it with the addition of Worf, introduction of a vicious new enemy and an all out war helped considerably, making the last few seasons highly excitable.  The show is character driven.  I didn't realize this at first, but after being a fan and watching it through to the bitter end, I have gone back and seen earlier episodes to realize that they knew what they were doing all along.  This is an awesome, awesome show filled with story arcs and plots that get you involved and leaving you wanting more.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Five stars do not give this remarkable set the justice it deserves. I got into them at age 16 when I first purchased the box set, and then had to go out and get the remaining songs that werent on it.  This however is the total collection for live performances as well as rare interviews.  I mean come on it has over 5 hours of great material and a better set list than The Song Remains The Same.  One of the best purchases I have ever made.
6305311463|4.0|With a great cast, spectacular special effects and many shattering scenes that depict hard core destruction on Earth bound cities, Armageddon is a movie you watch with your brain turned off.  Not that it's completely dumb, but it's not something you nit pick for scientific accuracy.  It's very entertaining, loud and sappy; and man is it a helluva ride.  Bay is the best director for this.  He has a gift for the action scenes as well as the emotion.  They are all overdone and overlayered with a patriotic soundtrack and camera angles that come from all perspectives.  The Criterion Collection is full, and I do mean full, of extras and documentaries.  If you want a more realistic disaster movie I would recommend Deep Impact.  It's slower but a more revealing drama.  I still highly recommend Armageddon, just leave your scepticism at the door and ignore the critics.
B00008A7QK|5.0|T. Rex and especially its elfin leader Marc Bolan were huge stars in England in the early 70's. They were the prototypical glam rockers and they racked up number one hit after number one hit in their native country. Despite the T. Rextasy that swept through England, the band never really caught on in America. The lone exception was Electric Warrior. The album spawned their only US top ten single, the pulsating \\"Bang A Gong (Get It On)\\". Those who only know the band from that song, should check out the rest of the album. The opens with a strong quartet of songs. \\"Mambo Sun\\" starts things off with a kick and then the album's best song \\"Cosmic Dancer\\" is next. The song has a slow, percolating rhythm accented by a string section and the song simmers along. The pace is quicken by the other big single the band had in the US, \\"Jeepster\\", which has a popping guitar riff and \\"Monolith\\" is a sexy rocker. Even though the band never hit it big in the US, their influence was felt in the 80's as T. Rex had a big impact on the British new wave invasion bands of that era. Rhino Records has done yet another brilliant job in remastering this album.  It is lavishly packaged with original album artwork, a pull out poster, loads of pictures and great liner notes from Sean Egan.  The album contains six bonus tracks including their U.K. number one hit \\"Hot Love\\" and a previously unreleased acoustic version of the glam rocker \\"Planet Queen\\" as well as an excerpt from a 1971 interview.
B000050FEN|4.0|SE7EN     (USA - 1995)    Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Super 35)  Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital / DTS    On the eve of retirement, a world-weary cop (Morgan Freeman) teams up with his younger replacement (Brad Pitt) in the hunt for a monstrous serial killer whose crimes are based on the seven deadly sins.    Dark, gruesome shocker which set director David Fincher on the road to Hollywood glory following an inauspicious debut with the half-baked sci-fi shocker ALIEN³. Freeman loans dramatic weight to the proceedings as a burnt-out cop struggling to make sense of the horrors he has witnessed during his long career, and Pitt distances himself from the 'pretty-boy' roles in which he had become typecast by playing a complex, headstrong character whose flaws lead to a devastating climactic 'twist'. The drama unfolds in an unnamed city where moral values have been replaced by human apathy and excess, allowing the killer at the heart of the story to fester unnoticed, until his monstrous scheme begins to overwhelm the central characters. In fact, Andrew Kevin Walker's ingenious script works both as a police procedural and as an examination of society's moral vacuum, though the downbeat ending may strike some as too neat and cynical for its own good.     The movie is quite shocking in places - the killing derived from the sin of 'lust' is particularly degrading - though it's also quite playful in its own twisted fashion (note, for instance, how the constant rainfall surrenders to bright sunlight for the horrific finale), and Darius Khondji's elegant widescreen cinematography often belies the movie's grim subject matter. A triumph for all concerned, this is as close as 1990's Hollywood ever came to a 'daring' mainstream blockbuster, and nervous viewers are urged to avoid at all costs.
B00008CLOA|5.0|Dark Side Of The Moon is one of the most famous and seminal albums in the history. 2003 marks the 30th anniversary of the album and it is still a major seller. The big reason for this is that the album appeals to teenagers of any era and the eternal teenager in all of us. With its dense, sonic musical landscape complete with sound effects and vivid lyrics, the album is perfect to throw into the cd player, put on your headphones and be taken on a cosmic journey. The songs effortless merge into one another creating almost one long song. In addition to all the mysticism, the band was at the height of their musical prowess. Roger Waters had fully grown into his musical potential. The album's songs are more concise and fully realized and he doesn't try to cram too much into one song. His bass playing is among the best of his career with the memorable bass line that memorable propels the top twenty single &quot;Money&quot; along. The band takes on the mental breakdown of their former leader Syd Barrett on the closing &quot;Brain Damage/Eclipse&quot; which is a subject they would explore more deeply on Dark Side's follow-up, Wish You Were Here. The album has been remastered many times, but this SACD version is head and shoulders above the rest.  The sound is absolutely incredible and the clarity is so pure that even the background sound effects are clear.  Longtime fans of the album will feel like they're hearing the album for the first time again.
B00006LPER|5.0|Yes, I felt like I had been gutted after first seeing it. But not until the next day did I begin to see the true brilliance of this creation. I won't repeat much of what has already been said by those who appreciate the film, but there is one new area I want to touch on...<BR>**SPOILERS**<BR>Why exactly did the teacher put the broken glass in the student's pocket? Most reviewers have noted that it only reflected her cruelty and reaction to an unsatifactory performance. I must disagree. Watch the scene again. Huppert is moved to tears as she watches her student playing on stage. The student is quite an expressive girl (crying &amp; vocalizing her fears)- just the opposite of Huppert's character.<br />There is a scene later in the film, after the girl is injured, when Huppert discusses the accident with the girl's mother. The mother, visibly upset, states &quot;We gave up everything so she could study piano&quot; and Huppert immediately snaps &quot;You mean SHE gave up everything, don't you.&quot;<br />So it was my thought that Huppert was simply saving this young expressive student from her own destiny. She didn't want the girl to end up like HER, repressed &amp; hardened, condemned to a life of recitals...gradually killing the soul in the pursuit of perfection.<br />For me, that realization made all the difference in what I experienced through this film. Brilliant.
B0000256VK|5.0|For years now, I've gone back and forth over what is my favorite ROXY MUSIC album.  They never made a bad one, in my opinion. Even MANIFESTO has a few decent tracks.  While I'd have to say that FOR YOUR PLEASURE or SIREN are the best examples of why ROXY MUSIC remain unequaled and contain some of their best work, I think that, at the end of the day, AVALON is their masterpiece.<br />There is a mood and atmosphere that surrounds this album that no other album, by any artist has achieved.  From the haunting, opening chords of the exquisite \\"More Than This,\\" to the sea-drenched melody at the end of the beautiful \\"Tara,\\" the music on this disc is 37 minutes of complete and utter erotic bliss.<br />\\"More Than This,\\" the title track, \\"Take a Chance with Me,\\" \\"The Main Thing,\\" and \\"True to Life,\\" rank as some of the best songs in the ROXY MUSIC catalog.<br />Bryan Ferry and Roxy Music inspired two generations of musicians with their music. In the 1980's, their influence loomed large over the new-romantic sounds of bands like ABC, DURAN DURAN and DEPECHE MODE (to name just three!), and in the 1990's, right on up to today, one can hear and see their influence in such Brit bands like RADIOHEAD, SUEDE and PULP.<br />It is AVALON, their studio swan-song, that is perhaps their most groundbreaking and innovative work.  Without hesitation, this is my pick for Best Album of the 1980's.  Even Rolling Stone Magazine had it in their top 100 of the 80's.  I'm even willing to go out on a limb and put it as my favorite album of all time- alongside the likes of The Beatles \\"Abbey Road,\\" and U2's \\"Achtung Baby.\\"<br />And, yes, it's true what's been said time and time again about AVALON- it is, undoubtedly, THE album to have playing for the ideal intimate encounter!
B00008K7AM|4.0|I was afraid this movie was going to be a total let down, until I saw this movie. The Preview doesn't OVER-DO it with included all the funny parts. Because the preview left out most of the funny clips, which Im glad they did. Anyways, Hot Chick is a really funny movie if you are a fan of Rob. The chick in the movie who he changes bodies with, is very hotttt. Thats worth seeing the movie alone.<br />Overall- If you want a laugh, rent Hot Chick or even buy it. Its worth it.
B000069AUI|5.0|I first heard Coldplay when ABC featured their (quite annoying, in my opinion) song &quot;Yellow&quot; in one of their commercials. I was not too impressed until I heard their next single &quot;Trouble&quot; on the radio. I bought &quot;Parachutes&quot;, but was somewhat disappointed. When &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; came out, I was tempted to pass, but fortunately I did not. There are almost no words to describe how fantastic this CD is. I don't like to think of this CD as music. I think of it as an experience. Coldplay has managed to bring their music together in such a way that it feels as if the actual composition is surrounding you. Some particular bright spots on the CD include &quot;The Scientist&quot;, &quot;Amsterdam&quot;, and my favorite song of all time, &quot;A Rush of Blood to Head&quot;, which was featured recently on a commercial for HBO's series, &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;. Actually, my advice to you, the buyer, would be to buy this CD to experience the title track. Amazing, that's all I can say about this CD.
B000002BE9|2.0|Overall a boring album. Fiona Apple writes good lyrics and okay music. Musically it is not very compelling and she tries to be a bit jazzy, bit rockish and poppish and even though she manages to be that all she doesnt do it very well. Her voice is irritating and constant moaning doesnt help either. Her Piano playing is overlooked by the mass production which often distract the listners from the music. Obviously talented but this album isnt very good in my opinion.
B000002KKS|4.0|Seems most people forgot about Sabbath after ozzy.  In my opinion there best recordings happend with dio not ozzy.  I am mainly a fan of hardcore/black/death metal, but this album still entertains me.  great cd \m/.
B00005JLRT|2.0|While better than Insurrection, overall this movie stinks.  I would actually give it two and a half stars.  This one feels very forced, and while I appreciate the inclusion of the Romulans in a movie, it simply isn't ever convincing that Shinzon would want to destroy Earth.  Even with the backstory they do provide, I couldn't believe he wants it that badly.  The sudden addition of a new sub-class of Remans is lame.  One could write off the coincidence of a race of aliens, just happening to share their name with the mythical founder of Rome.  But when all of a sudden we learn of an off-breed of the same race that shares it's name with Romulus' brother Remus it becomes laughable.  And perhaps it's a bit cruel, but Brent Spiner has gained weight since the series ended, and it's just odd to see the android Data with a second chin.  Sorry, no good.
B00006L83N|5.0|This album kicks major behind, what more to say.  This band has musicianship you just dont find anymore and it shows thorough on this record better than ever.  A progressive triumph.
B0000931QA|5.0|This is a special CD.  There is plenty to enjoy musically, but there is so much more.  It is rare for a CD to be able to tell a compelling story.  Set in the late 80s, we hear a tale of an antigovernment revolution led by Doctor X - \\"The Man With The Cure\\" - who uses a combination of propaganda and drugs to recruit assassins.  The CD focuses on the rise and fall of one such recruit.  After getting sucked into the revolution, he falls in love with \\"Sister Mary\\", the nun who supplies him with his drugs.  However, the order comes down from Doctor X that she is to be his next hit, and this becomes the turning point.  He winds up killing the priest, but he and Mary try to escape.  Eventually, Mary does wind up dead, but we are not told explicitly how or who did it.  All that we do know is that the assassin is arrested and ends up in a mental hospital.<br />From hard hitting metal to driving ballads, every song on the CD is good.  You will find yourself listening over and over again, picking up something new each time whether it's a deeper understanding of the story or a layer of the harmony of the rythm section.  It seems like a contradiction of terms, but this CD is metal for the intellectual.<br />The additional live tracks are a nice added bonus.
B00008WG3U|5.0|this is a great cd.it's chock full of punk rock and politic content about the president and the whole government.it's got songs about other great punk bands too(13 stitches and two jealous agains).it's also got some ska and i definately recommend it to you.enjoy.-sam
B00008LDPU|3.0|The Animatrix is nine short animated films that tie into or branch off of the world created by the Wachowski brothers in three feature films.  Taken as a whole, this project can be described as a visual masterpiece decorating a very uneven set of stories.  It is a worthy buy for fans of animation, and for those of us who are simply fascinated with anything Matrix related, but if you are expecting any groundbreaking, knock your socks off revelations or storylines, you may be a bit disappointed.<br />The animation often achieves moments of breathtaking beauty and detail, and is refreshing in its variety from one short film to the next.  Styles vary from the ultra-realistic (Final Flight of the Osiris), to film noir (A Detective Story), to the truly bizarre and psychedelic (Matriculated).<br />As for the storylines, they are frequently vague and in serious need of fleshing out, and are for the most part not essential to any deeper understanding of the main story presented in the Matrix films.  For my taste, the three shorts that did relate directly to the film, Final Flight of the Osiris and The Second Renaissance Parts I and II were the most satisfying and the others were simply dessert after the main course.  All in all, every story with the exception of The Second Renaissance Parts I and II left me wanting more.  Perhaps that is a testament to what a story should do, or perhaps it is an example of an inability to pull a story completely together, depending on which point of view you choose to take.<br />Whatever the case may be, if you are only a casual fan of the Matrix films and could care less about the fine art of animation, this DVD is probably not for you.  However, if you have an appreciation for animation, or if you are waiting for Neo or Morpheus to contact you through your computer, then get your geek on and get yourself a copy of the Animatrix.
B00006J3T4|5.0|Circa the mid-80's, Mark Knopfler's headbanded image defied MTV's \\"gotta look good to succeed in music\\" -- and 20 or so years later, all he's done is write some incredible music and defy those years on MTV with music that cuts out everything but the necessities, ie solid melody, memorable lyrics, and some smooth-as-silk guitar.<br />When people criticize Billy Joel for assuming the plight of those less fortunate (\\"Allentown,\\" \\"The Downeaster Alexa,\\" \\"Goodnight Saigon\\"), they're missing the point, and Knopfler's gift in assuming others' roles is as impressive as is Billy Joel's and another great American songwriter, Tom Petty's. For \\"Ragpicker,\\" his tone is earthy, restrained and moody yet upbeat, observant, wry and humorous. Comparing Jerry Springer to the Professor, a leader of side-show freaks (\\"Devil Baby\\") one can't help but laugh, and, simultaneously, get Knopfler's point.<br />\\"You Don't Know You're Born\\" haunts and taunts the listener with its bluesy undercurrent swing; the title track regales the listener with the warmth of being among family for holidays, so much so you can almost smell the food; and \\"Why Aye Man\\" places the listener in Germany, among its inviting frauleins and \\"chemical-free\\" beer. In addition, Old Pigweed evokes the sense of humor that Knopfler fans have come to know and love, whether it's Industrial Disease, My Parties or Millionaire Blues.<br />Some might not the like how this story is told, and others might prefer other stories altogether, but as with Golden Heart and Sailing to Philadelphia, Mark Knopfler's latest effort is not a collection of songs but an impressive, entire work that is worth experiencing and revisiting like any classic, whether it be Catcher in the Rye, Animal Farm or The Sun Also Rises. This album is absolutely worth a few listens, and, I believe, a definite keeper.
B00005JM09|4.0|Terminator 3. Geez it seems like only yesterday I was dreaming it would come out - however that was 10 years ago now, alot of things have changed.<BR>It can be seen from the trailer that the film does have a different appearance - due to James Cameron not directing it.<BR>T101 all look the same, its sad that you can tell that Arnold has aged somewhat - however without him, Terminator cannot exist. Im afraid that the introduction of too many new characters to the Terminator legacy will destroy the film.<br />New Director<BR>New John Connor<BR>John Connors partner chick<BR>A female Terminator !<br />For me, too much change could indeed ruin this movie. Special effects are brilliant, but without the storyline dont really mean anything! If this movie becomes a Bomb, then I feel it has ruined all of the existing Terminator movies. I have no time for American film makers trying to make money by destroying ripping off these great films.<br />I have doubt that T3 will suceed. But as long as Arnold is there, anything can happen cos he is the MAN !
B00008J4P5|5.0|Granted 5-stars is probably a bit weighted when true classics have the same 5-stars.  But, for 2003--this is a great rock CD.  It has a lot of the style that made Led Zeppelin and Cream sound so great (yes, I know, they STILL sound great).  But this is 2003 and there aren't many out there that can run with Meg and Jack White.  Ball and Biscuit is a real blues rocker that can stand up to many of the classics.  Elephant has its flaws but it is certainly a few levels up from the current competition.
0316666343|4.0|On her way home from school in December one day, Susie Salmon is brutally raped and murdered. She is the latest victim of a serial killer-who she only knew as her neighbor, Mr. Harvey. This book is told through the eyes of Susie, as she looks down from heaven, seeing what happens to the man who murdered her and how her family copes with her death. Heaven is perfect and has everything she could ever want, but her family.<br />This book was incredibly sad, but that did not make it bad. The beginning has a little too much detail, but otherwise, there are so many little details and messages. The characters provoke love and hate, which means they are good characters. I found this book very good, especially as I thought it would be a Christian \\"God is my savoir\\" book.

B00008J4P5|1.0|The only reason I was possessed to come and review this was because the amount of times &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; has been crammed down my throat on MTV and the radio. I thought Queens of the stone age were pushing it when they wrote a whole song with the same riff over and over and over again, but this band takes the cake!! Is it the fact that they could only come up with one chord? or did they want to milk it for all its worth? either way that managed to tick me off. I also read some reviewers say they are &quot;musically strong&quot; You can say anything you want about this band: you can say you like them, they are cool, what have you, but you cannot say they are musically strong, count the riffs, do you hear any guitar leads? do any of you play guitar, you could learn this in only a week if you have never played a guitar, and if you have, you could learn it in 2 seconds. Simplistic, annoying music, sounds like a broken record!
B00005JM03|4.0|rather disturbing title, ain't it? oh well... it fits this movie though... in some ways. thing is, this remake of the 1969 comedy caper bears little resemblance to the original, except of course for the mini coopers, the car chase (kinda) and the characters (also sorta)... *shrugs*<br />and the \\"italian\\" part is well... misleading coz the whole thing took place in los angeles. the first heist though, took place in venice (instead of turin in the original).<br />enough of that. i love this movie. it's not the same as the original italian job, but what is? the michael caine vehicle is an unbelievable movie and i doubt that anything could ever top that one in it's originality, script and performance in the heist genre.  that said, this 2003 remake is far from incompetent and god forbid, mediocre. i's a whole new different ball game, and it's well made with an excellent cast and great directing.<br />ed norton plays the utterly slimy and oily villain who stole the gold from the team led by croker (wahlberg). in the process, he left them for dead and killed theron's father played by sutherland. they managed to track down norton, now living it up in LA, and it's payback time...<br />this is really enjoyable. so many heist movies in recent memory failed to live up to their expectations, but even with a tough predecessor (the original italian job) this movie shines as one feel good escapade. some complained about the formulaic plot, but i think it's better to have a formulaic plot and still able to pull it off with great performance, directing and energy. after all, people go to the movies to be entertained.<br />and you shall...
B00008OLYN|1.0|First off, i will listen to this album again for the third time and see if my opinion changes, if it does I will change my rating: in the mean time, this music is annoying and outdated! i want to smack the guy who called this black metal. Oh, and yes, I do have one of their other albums, which is way better than this one, so i do like some of their stuff (I got blackwater park) anyway, i never wanted to eject a cd out of my player so bad in all my life. There is no emotion in this music, its terrible! Its not angry, its not sad, its not happy, it does not have a good beat, good riff, good anything! If you like \\"we had joy we had fun, we had seasons in the sun\\" maybe this is for you, then again, even that song is better than this stuff...did I say that?
B000089RVX|5.0|I love every song on this CD.  It is a little dark but the lead singers voice really makes this worth listening to.  It is so powerful and amazing.
B00005JM03|5.0|I saw this movie last week, not because I liekd the original (for I haven't seen it), but because \\"Finding Nemo\\" didn't appeal to me, it got a good review, it looked good, and had a great cast with Seth Green, Jason Statham, Edward Norton and others. It's a fast paced action movie about a very organized crime group who just stole millions of dollars in gold, but are betrayed by Norton's character and left for dead. But they survive, and then the movie really starts. It's about revenge, basically, and most of the movie focuses around them planning their revenge on Norton, but there's a lot more than that. It blends a lot of humour into it (most done by Seth Green, who's character claims that he was dorm mate with the \\"creator\\" of Napster, but the ide was his and his friend stole the disk with it while he was asleep). I suggest you see this if you're ANYONE, because it really enjoyable. (I don't have time for a much bigger review, but you can read the other ones...)
B00006JKON|1.0|&gt;I don't know anyone who doesn't like 'Bungle in the Jungle.' <br />And I don't know anyone who does. It WAS a hit single, so SOMEBODY must have liked it, but as a survivor from the period I can testify that he was not among those who bought previous Jethro Tull records, who formerly attended Jethro Tull concerts, who supported the group and helped it to achieve its then considerable fame and critical standing. He was not among those who made Jethro Tull what it once was, without whom it couldn't have become even what it is now.<br />In any case, though there are a few better songs here than &quot;Lungle In The Rungle&quot; (you guessed it: &quot;Skating Away&quot;--but also &quot;Back Door Angels&quot; and &quot;Only Solitaire&quot;), there are also much worse (&quot;The Third Hurrah&quot; and pretty much all of &quot;side two&quot;). So &quot;Nungle In The Tungle&quot;--since presumably you've heard it--is a fair test. If you like this song a LOT, you may very well like the rest of this album. If you are at all disdainful in any way of any of &quot;Kungle In The Yungle&quot; (it's title, say), avoid this album.
B00007BH5C|5.0|First, let me say that on FotR, the best song was The Breaking of the Fellowship. <BR>Then, hear me out: Samwise the Brave(TTT)= The Breaking of the Fellowship(FotR).

0440237688|5.0|The Giver: A book review by Jochen and Waldemar <br />The novel `The Giver' by Lois Lowry is about a community in the future and a small boy who wants to escape from there. There were concrete attributes which he could not abide after he had not take drugs (pills against pain) like everybody else there. <BR>We liked the story `The Giver' by Lois Lowry.<BR>To tell the truth we have to confess that on some parts of the story, the content was a bit boring. But all in all the entire book was imaginative. The mixture of science fiction and fantasy was new to us. With all that fantasy you could reconstruct it. You could imagine that the society today could develop to the society in the book. The book is maybe a alert the people in our world. The people want to have everything perfect today and you can see what might happen if everything seems to be perfect. The main character Jonas was the only one who saw the problem of the community in which he lived, and wanted to have a world in which nothing is perfect but a society with feelings like love. It shows us how important feelings are and that we have to respect and to take care of them.
6305212112|5.0|My wife decided that I needed a little joy in my life and strongly suggested that I watch this movie with her.  Of course, I had heard that this was a &quot;chick flick,&quot; and expected to be bored silly.  I was so wrong!  This is a great movie, loaded with laughter, love and bittersweet moments that will leave you at the same time with tears of joy and sadness.<br />The two Marys, Stewart and Louise-Parker, are just outstanding.  It is clear that they didn't have to work at acting their affection for each other.  These two make magic happen before your eyes.  Kathy Bates and Jessica Tandy are absolute delights, and the supporting cast couldn't do a better job of just that.<br />In conclusion........Do you think I liked this flick?  YOU BET!  C'mon guys, give it a try, or better yet give it to the love of your life and she'll love you for it!  Highly recommended!
B0000508U6|5.0|When I first heard of Coldplay it was by accident. I was listening to one of those &quot;new music&quot; compilations and stumbled upon a live version of &quot;Yellow&quot;. Then late at night, watching VH-1, I saw them perform &quot;Clocks&quot; live. Well I fell in love with that song; I fell in love with Chris's energy on stage, and that's what made me purchase A Rush of Blood to the Head. Yes, I bought their second major album before the first one. <br />So about this first debut - there's nothing like it. I've heard a lot of music in my day, but nothing like this. I tried comparing Coldplay to a lot of other bands like Radiohead, Vast, Tears For Fears, Pink Floyd, even Led Zepplen - and I love all of these bands. But the somber mood, mixed with the passionate energy, it gives you a reason to live.
B00000IJPU|3.0|[MY RATING FOR THIS IS ACTUALLY 3.5 STARS, NOT JUST 3]<br />When first delving into the legacy known as Iron Maiden, I bought this CD, which I found out later there was a double disc collection of this.  As such, this review applies solely to the single disc compilation.  This one predated \\"Virtual XI\\" and the current efforts, so you won't find any songs here from \\"Virtual XI,\\" \\"Brave New World,\\" or any live track from \\"Rock in Rio.\\"  However, I do deem this album better than the more readily available and most recent greatest hits compilation, \\"Edward the Great.\\"  Read on:<br />\\"NUMBER OF THE BEAST\\" (1982)<br />Number of the Beast, Run to the Hills, Hallowed Be Thy Name<br />Comments: These three are what that album's best remembered for and I don't oppose the selections, considering its a single-disc compilation.<br />\\"PIECE OF MIND\\" (1983)<br />The Trooper<br />Comments: TALK ABOUT A CHEAT!  Where's Flight of Icarus and Die With Your Boots On??<br />\\"POWERSLAVE\\" (1984)<br />Aces High, Two Minutes to Midnight<br />Comments: The two big hits from the album.  Fine selections.  I wish that Rime of the Ancient Mariner was on here as well, but since it's a single disc compilation and that song is 13 minutes long already, it's good to leave room for other songs.<br />\\"LIVE AFTER DEATH\\" (1985)<br />Only one live track made it here, and it's an edited version of \\"Running Free.\\"  It's nice that they edited out the middle part which Bruce does the whole \\"SCREAM FOR ME, etc.\\" schpeel.  I was hoping for more from this live album, though.<br />\\"SOMEWHERE IN TIME\\" (1986)<br />Wasted Years<br />Comments: ANOTHER GREAT ALBUM CHEATED.  What about Stranger in a Strange Land, or Deja Vu??<br />\\"SEVENTH SON OF A SEVENTH SON\\" (1988)<br />Can I Play With Madness, Evil That Men Do, The Clairvoyant<br />Comments: Great selections.  I'm very glad to see The Clairvoyant here.  I was hoping for Moonchild to be here, but I will not complain.<br />\\"NO PRAYER FOR THE DYING\\" (1990)<br />Bring Your Daughter... To the Slaughter<br />Comments: I understand that this song is their only #1 U.K. hit, but people... it isn't that great of a song.  I would've preferred Run Silent Run Deep or Tailgunner over this.<br />\\"FEAR OF THE DARK\\" (1992)<br />Be Quick or Be Dead<br />Comments: Although I think From Here to Eternity and Afraid to Shoot Strangers should've been included too, they DID include a live performance of Fear of the Dark (I think it's from Live at Donington) that outdoes the studio recording.  This compilation came out before \\"Rock in Rio,\\" so it's natural that my favorite version of Fear of the Dark is not on here.<br />\\"X FACTOR\\" (1995)<br />Man on the Edge, Virus (B-Side)<br />Comments: I never cared for this album all that much, but Man on the Edge is one of the best tracks.  However, WHY DID THEY PUT VIRUS ON HERE?!  It's actually a b-side from X Factor and I don't feel it should be here at all (just like When Love & Hate Collide was put on Vault: Def Leppard's Greatest Hits... does not belong!).  I never really liked that song, and it's a long track that could've been dispensed for some other, more important songs.<br />Overall, this should please any Maiden fan THAT IS ONLY A FAN OF THE DICKINSON ERA OF MAIDEN.  They left out some awesome tracks from the Paul Di'Anno era like Phantom of the Opera and Wrathchild.  He may not sing as well as Bruce can, but his era had its fair share of excellent songs as well.  For the casual fan, I recommend getting this for a low price.  Otherwise, bypass and buy the discography.  It's more worth it that way in my book.  I gave this an extra half star, however, because:<br />1) The songs almost fill up the entire CD, which \\"Edward\\" doesn't.<br />2) \\"Seventh Son\\" still has many tracks here, but it doesn't overtake a 1/3 of the CD like \\"Edward\\" does.  It's evened out with \\"Number of the Beast.\\"<br />3) This one has the STUDIO RECORDING of Wasted Years.<br />4) Even if Paul Di'Anno isn't represented here at all (only a faint representation with the live Running Free, which this one is performed by Bruce), they at least made a slight representation of Blaze Bayley.ve Running Free, which this one is performed by Bruce), they at least made a slight representation of Blaze Bayley.
B00005RERU|1.0|Dear Fellow Viewers:<br />I intend to buy the Alpha offering of DVD One Eyed Jacks but don't know if the quality is good. I have read the DVD reviews with conflicting comments from good to bad. Since there are three versions being sold out there, I just want to know if the Alpha product is the good one being emulated or the bad one being lambasted.
B000005RFQ|4.0|Born Again is definitely different from Sabbath, but you can't deny that Ian Gillan and the rest of the Sabbs had loads of fun writing and recording this blistering album.  Gillan screams like never before, Iommi's guitar tone is a razor blade that shreds the ears, Geezer thumps away, and Bill Ward made his last appearance for many years on this album, drumming ...  Producer, Robin Black must have bent the needles on the meters while tracking and mixing Born Again.  This album is just plain fun with one great song after another. Highlights include Zero The Hero, Hot line, and Keep It Warm.
B00007JVBI|5.0|I had no idea who Cat Power were when i first heard the name. My first thought was that it was a really bad name, so they probably weren't any good either.<br />But i was wrong, i logged onto their mini site at matador and saw the video for cross bones style (which is from an older album). I was immideatly moved by that song. So i went off and got their latest album (You are Free) and once i started playing it i couldn't stop. Chan Marshalls voice in incredible. It's the kind of voice that goes through your whole body. The kind that i had never heard. Their songs are very simple, and the lyrics are very personal the Chan. Or so it seems, they don't say much. Yet they're deep. They have different meanings to different persons.<br />Some of the songs aren't that strong. But most will nearly bring tears to your eyes. It's a bit depressing album, however i have to say it's probably the best album i've ever heard.<br />If you're like me, who likes to listen to deep and a tad sad music every once in a while. This is defintly one of the best buys you'll ever do.
0618001905|5.0|Since I read this book over a year ago I have spoken about it to several people as well as bought copies to give to others. Trying to explain it does not do it any justice, you have to read it to capture the full sense of the horror and puts present day Africa and what is still happening there in full focus.<BR>It was a light bulb turning on.<br />Many of the ways people are being killed, tortured, mutilated and raped are the same as when colonialization by Europe and others was occuring. Blacks were used to inflict suffering on others or become inflected themselves. It is almost like  generations after generations used these same tactics and now it is sadly in bred as the way to dominate. be ruthless and brutal beyond belief. <br />During WWII, the Jews lost 6 million, Russia lost over 20 million<BR>and we hear about them, but who really knew what happened to Blacks in Africa after the Slave trade to America and other countries was over. Or that the adventures of Stanley and Livingston was more than some adventure walk through Africa. All my life I was fooled and looked upon them like virtually everyone else, wow that must have been exciting. How I know...wow they were brutal murderers.<br />White people around the world as well as black people should read this. I say whites because they really need to be made aware of our history. Black are brought up and taught white history but they can often go through life fully clueless of <BR>what has happened in our history. Or before being quick to turn a blind eye to Africa as just some place where blacks can't seem to get along, remember one thing what you see or hear about now has a direct line back to many countries around the world that took want it wanted by any means. If blacks anywhere in history inflicted 1/1,000,000 of these horrors on the white race, it would be in every history book as one of worst example of evil ever known.  In this case no one seems to know or talk about it.
0679411585|4.0|The most striking lesson to be learned from \\"We Were Soldiers...\\" is the importance of first class training. Moore's Battalion was a team. They had trained together in the US, they had lived together in the US, and through shared adversity had gone to Vietnam with a tight bond. Their training was sound and they understood the finer points of being a soldier. The other units involved in the action, and which moved out of X-Ray by foot were not as well trained. There can be not doubt that they were fine individuals and brave soldiers, but Moore's account highlights a deficiency in their training. Soldiers simply halted, sat on their packs, and lit up a smoke. Even NCOs walked down the column without rifles or helmets to see why they had halted. Any well trained soldier knows that during a halt you immediately face out, take up a defensive posture, and watch your arcs. Every well trained officer knows to deploy early warning, achieve mutual support/interlocking arcs, and to stay in a suitable position to command their troops. On both accounts, the soldiers and officers of 2/5 and 2/7 Battalion failed to adhere to these basic principles. This book serves as a lesson about the value of first class training and demonstrates the importance of ensuring that every soldiers basic skills are up to scratch.
B00008PC2O|5.0|I bought the Second Edition DVD of T2 and it is perfectly fine for me.  My friend bought the Ultimate Edition and although it is an awesome DVD, I don't feel the need to throw down $... for a DVD that I already have.  Hollywood did the exact same thing with the Men in Black DVDs.  They don't realize that people are not going to keep spending money on new releases of DVDs that they already have.

0440237688|4.0|\\"The Giver\\", by Lois Lowry: A book review by Olga and Kerstin, two girls in the 10th grade from Germany<br />A few months ago we began to read our first English book in our English class. At first we were afraid not to understand the content, but while reading we recognized that the book was very simple to read and the content was easy to understand. And with the help of mind maps, which we should make to each chapter the content was lot easier to understand.<br />The protagonist Jonas lives in a community, which seems to be perfect. But as Jonas is selected to be the new receiver of memory he observes that it is not as beautiful as it seems. From the memories he receives as the new receiver he notices that in \\"Elsewhere\\" there are feelings and colours and things he doesn't know about, but there is also pain and war.<br />At first there is to say that we both have the same opinion about this book: The book is FANTASTIC!!!<BR>The way how the author describes the events, the feelings and thoughts of the characters impressed us. Each chapter has its own tension and some times the chapters brake up in a tension and this makes the book so exciting.<BR>It is only the ending we don't like much, because of the open ending. We think that the book would be better if the author has written on. And that's why we wrote our own endings in our class.

B00005T30L|5.0|You're reading these reviews because you're trying to gain insight on whether or not to buy Ghost World. Just buy it.<br />If that wasn't good enough, let me explain that I've seen every movie ever made with the exception of about 10 films. Ghost World is definitely in my top ten. I wouldn't call it a traditional movie. It has no clear, defined plot like perhaps the Hulk does. Character building, dialogue, quirkiness, etc... well this film has more than any movie I've seen in a long time. I figured, while watching it, it would fail in the end, but I was happy with the ending... the overall feel of the whole movie. I'm not really describing the movie here, but it's best to let you rent or buy it and find out for yourself.

0790731509|5.0|I cannot imagine why this film hasn't been more acclaimed. It is without a doubt one of the best of all time. I think the thing that appeals most of all to me is the unbelievable authenticity of all the characters. Except for Newman (because, hey, he's Paul Newman) nobody here appears to be acting. The guards are done just right--tough, good ol' boys who you don't wanna mess with. The prisoners meanwhile are a fairly diverse lot, some educated, some not, some with a whiff of femininity, but all have a refusal to be stripped of their dignity. Luke magnifies that element to the Nth degree. <BR>The second best thing is the dialogue: Like \\"The Godfather\\", \\"Star Trek II\\", \\"Resoirovir Dogs\\", and \\"Jaws\\", Cool Hand Luke has several scenes which you'll easily memorize in their entirety.  <BR>Other elements: Boss Godfrey, The Man With No Eyes who doesn't say one word during the movie and who is one of the most chilling characters in a movie ever; Luke's mother, the car wash girl, the egg-eating contest, and Luke's excellent final monologue. <BR>Luke's story has been compared to that of Jesus. When you look at it, you see that if Luke is a savior, he's a terribly flawed one, one who can't save himself. He's anti-authority, he's got nerve, and some major cojones, but he's got no aims, no goals, no beliefs. He's a Rebel Without A Clue. If he'd been born about 15-20 years later he could have made a good hippie. But this is still the early '50s and men who fail to conform end up exactly where he does. IMHO, this film accomplishes what One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest tried to do and does it much, much, better. <br />One final small note: The Lalo Schifrin score is great particularly during the \\"tarring the road\\" scene. Anyone who grew up in NYC in the 70s will instantly realize it as the theme to Channel 7 Eyewitness News!
B00008PX8P|5.0|Ah yeh.....this  is  a  wonderful DVD....having been born in 1976 and  missed all the fun,  it's  great  to  have  this DVD to see what Led  Zeppelin concerts were  like. Granted, the VHS (and DVD) of The Song Remains the Same has  been around a while (I made sure I got it too...hehe)...but  in  order  to  understand what Led Zep's concerts were like....it's better to get info from  more than one  source,  and  this new  DVD  gives  you  plenty.  Go  buy  it! Guitarist approved...giggle!
B000005HNQ|5.0|No music anywhere has been this good since Dark Side of the Moon, and that was quite some time ago.  The flow from song to song is amazing. In particular, the fade from &quot;Third Chance&quot; to &quot;Kevin's Telescope&quot; is absolutely the smoothest transition ever.  This has got to be the best album of all time.  wow.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Ordinarily, I wouldn't listen to rock if you paid me. All the screaming and thrashing is pointless nonsense in my opinion. I still largely feel that way, except I think Linkin Park are absolutely brilliant. I was stunned by the tremendous Reanimation, so much so that I made myself pick up 'Meteora' a few weeks ago. It hasn't stopped playing at my house since. Ironically, what I like about Meteora is just how heavy it is, this is very much a record with its roots in rock and yet sounds nothing like any rock record I've heard before. A stark contrast to Renimation, it is yet another indication that the men of Linkin Park are the true masters of diversity and versatality. But as hard as it is, it doesn't shy away from harmonies or melodies. Not to mention how adept the band seem to be in balancing the rock/rap sound it's made it's own. The intertwining of genres is so sublte and yet so effective. And it is because of this trait that Linkin Park does for me, what no other rock-influenced band has managed to do so far and that's hold my attention.<br />While I have to admit that tracks like 'Hit the Floor' and 'Faint' where a bit too rock-ish for my rather sensitive ears, I haven't skipped one track on this CD. My stand-outs have to be the amazing 'Nobody's Listening' a song with a strong hip-hop complemented by Japanese flutes (if only P. Diddy could be this creative), 'Don't Stay' a song that pays homage to the X-Ecutioners with the excellent scratching within it and the first single of the album, 'Somewhere I Belong'. <br />With Meteora, Linkin Park literally rock. And I never thought I'd be saying that about any band.
B00004YYDI|5.0|This movie is completely amazing, despite what these other critics say about the \\"perverse love affair\\" or whatever else. If they actually payed attention to the movie you would notice that there is nothing perverse about it. And whoever was whining about leon teaching her how to shoot a rifle.....its the movies, and marilyn manson didnt make them do it either. <br />If youre into action movies that involve a little more thinking then your average steven segal movie then this is for you. it is also in a way a wonderful story about love and revenge and life in genral. <br />I recommend this movie to anyone.
B00008LDPU|2.0|After reading the scores of positive reviews here, I decided to buy the DVD without renting it first. Boy was that a bad decision. Although some of the episodes were entertaining, most of them resorted to simply copying basic themes and visuals from the first movie. The dialogue tends to draw staight off the first movie which can get really annoying. Also, rather than coming up with new machines, these episodes show that in fact squidies are the only machine we will ever see. Except in the last episode which manages to destroy this one good point by being extremely confusing.<br />I suppose if you really like anime then you might like this dvd more than I did. I'm a really big fan of the Matrix. I thought the first and second movie were fantastic. This DVD is definitely not anywhere near the level of those movies. But if you are a big fan, you'll probably want to see these once so rent it or borrow it from a friend.
B000084T18|1.0|What is the hype about this guy? I just don't get it. His mumbling, illiterate raps are pathetic. Listen to cats like Snoop, Biggie, Tribe, De La Soul, ANY other good hip hop performers and the skills & lyrics put 50 to shame. See 50 Cent for what he is: a nice, hard working, ghetto thug who's trying to get paid by riding a little hype. These tracks are garbage. Just wait 6 months and you'll be able to pick up this album in the $$ bargain bin. Hype doesn't last long in this biz. Don't be a sheep
B00008LDPU|2.0|This DVD start's off wonderfully with &quot;Final flight of the Orisis&quot;, the animation is outstanding and it does a great job of setting you up for &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;. But after than there isn't anything really worth your time. Only two others come close and those are &quot;Kid's Story&quot; and &quot;Detective Story&quot; and those are really pretty far from relating to the movie. If your a anima fan you may enjoy these just for the animation, but for my after &quot;Final flight of the Orisis&quot; it lost any real Matrix feel to the stories.
B00000K19E|1.0|The mythical rise of the loner-as-hero which constitutes much of  The Matrix  has certainly attracted its share of reclusive techno-geek types, as the many twists in the plot might have rung a bell or two, encouraging strong identification with the main character ; but, ultimately, the movie carries little food for thought, apart from a bunch of cheapo socio-philosophical concepts thrown together to impress and flatter. The staged rebeliousness, the fight against the  system , the whole concept of the movie is a gigantic smokescreen, a Dr FeelGood sort of thing, that has proven able to keep millions of generous souls soundly asleep, as the world keeps running its reckless course, spinning out of control, like a toy in the hands of a bunch of kids, too stupid and selfish to even bother about anything else than their own amusement. True, the movie  is an apt metaphor of our world. But who are the machines ?  them  or us ?  They  are truly human, after all : greedy, arrogant, and utterly senseless. On the other hand, we have become predictable clockwork mechanisms, rushing to get our share of stimuli. So, basically, we are being fed the stuff to keep us quiet. Don't be fooled by it : understand it for what it is. And remember, as Lenin said -and in that case he was quite right-, capitalists will sell us the rope to hang them. The Matrix, which is, for  them , only a money making machine, might well prove to be that rope, if only anyone could see it. Think about those execs summing up sales figures in their cosy offices. Think about that newly released second episode. You've read the raving reviews ; you've seen the crowds, eager to get their share of  action , desperate to know where the story goes ; you've witnessed friends and relatives, hopelessely addicted to sequels. Do you like it like that ? Do you really think you've discovered something ? What is  real  ? So, why not forget about the Wachowskis for a while, and read Chomsky. You should know better.
0385504209|4.0|This isn't an especially well-written book but it's very interesting and very provocative.  The idea that there are competing strains/versions of Christianity and that the official church (the Vatican) has acted to destroy or at least suppress the truth is an old one but Dan Brown uses this idea to great effect.<br /><br />  The characters are interesting and the plot moves very quickly---this is a real page-turner.  Brown constantly leaves you guessing and you are never sure who is on the side of the hero and heroine and who is opposed to them.<br />  I loved the interaction between Langdon (the hero---a Harvard professor) and Sophie Neveu (the heroine---a Parisian cop and cryptologist).  The action in the book occurs over abt a day or two and Sophie and Langdon's relationship is true to this.  Many thrillers have the hero and heroine fall madly in love within a 24 hour period as they are being chased by bad guys---this is pretty unrealistic!  Brown doesn't fall into this trap.  His characters have only just met and they maintain a professional and very real relationship throughout the book (no sex on the run).<br />  My only complaint (and it's very minor) is that Brown doesn't include a \\"Historical Footnotes\\" page.  I wanted to know what was true and what was not true in the book!<br />  Buy this---and reserve a day to read it.  It goes very quickly and you won't regret it!
B00008J2DQ|5.0|The first song I heard by Godsmack on the radio was &quot;Whatever.&quot;  However, the very first time I'd heard a Godsmack tune was in one of my husband's video games.  Needless to say, I've been hooked ever since.  I enjoy all three CD's but, I've gotta say, &quot;Faceless&quot; is the best.  The guys really let loose, letting whatever inner rage they feel come out in their music.  I'd definitely recommend this CD to anyone and everyone who enjoys the heavier side of life.  Can't wait til their next CD.
B000066NW0|4.0|I'm one of those people who is very much divided on my opinion of Avril. I dislike her just as much as I like her, so was very reluctant to buy this album. Admittedly though, I have been pleasantly surprised. OK, os she's spoon feeding the under 16 generation just what they want, and so what if the image has already been around for 5 years? This girl is plugging some great tunes.<BR>She has a good voice (I wouldn't call it a great voice), which always helps, and her vocal range is admirable. Anyone who has listened to 'I'm With You' will vouch for that, and the songs are annoyingly catchy. I liked Avril long before she came to England, and I advised almost everyone I knew how huge she was going to be, and I was a fan of her in the beginning. However, I think she has recieved too much media attention, which has been very much focussed on the fact that she has a skateboard and dresses a la punk. I can't walk into a clothes shop without finding Avril-esque clothes, and because of this I have begun to dislike her. BUT, 'Let Go' is a wicked album, which is (dare I say?) one of the best albums I have bought in a long time. It features alot of cool lyrics, many of which seem to relate to boys (odd for someone who claims to be a 'punk rocker') and the tunes have a broad variety of beat of rhythm - the upbeat 'Sk8er Boi', the reflective 'I'm With You' and the somewhat, acherm, screechy 'Unwanted'.<BR>This isn't rock. This isn't punk rock. This is pop. It is not consistent with punk rock albums. Don't be fooled by the drums and the guitars. Avril could just have easily have won Pop Idol and upheld this image, but it certainly wouldn't have been rock then. Her image has been what has given her career that extra boost, which is a shame, because it diverts away from her cool voice.<BR>I'm an alternative girl, and I usually steer clear of this genre at all costs, but I had to but this CD, even if it was just out of curiousity. Its awesome though, and was money well spent. I noticed a list below of the 8 steps to make a teen idol, which I guess was referring to Avril, and htey are very much true, but so what! Isn't everything that does well in the charts made that way? My fave track on this album are 'Anything But Ordinary', which is encouraging individuality, 'Losing Grip', which is perfect for explaining a feeling of being alone or ignored by a group and 'I'm With You'. <BR>Like Avril? We've got a singer here in Britain called Amy Studt, who is being hailed as 'the British Avril'. I personally consider her to be marginally more talented, so watch out for her future releases. Also, Alisha's Attic were producing similar material when Avril Lavigne wasn't even a known name.
0894803123|3.0|This is really good and fantastic, I suggest you buy it, but if you have only got a 1 quart ice-cream maker, don't buy it. This book requires at least 1 and a half quarter or more... but anyway, this is a really good cookbook, I must say.
038572179X|2.0|It is a rare book that I just can NOT finish and although this book came highly recommended by several people, I just could not finish it.  I kept putting it down and would come back to it but never could get invested in the characters or the various plot lines.
B00004T8RK|4.0|Another great Pearl Jam album.  To anyone says Eddie Vedder just mumbles has never listened to more than 10 seconds of any great Pearl Jam song.  How could one even say that the band should break up??  And Creed beng a great passionate rock band is absurd, look who's music is being copied by who?  A fresh new sound by Creed, I don't think so.  In 10 years Pearl Jam is still going to be rocking like they have for almost 15 years and Creed is going to be some senseless band that had a brief career due to bad ears like yours.
0553382179|5.0|I've been a &quot;flybaby&quot; for a few months now and just read her book over the weekend.  This is not another &quot;get organized&quot; book.  Flylady teaches you how to love yourself, quit being a martyr, bless your home, family, friends and others with the decluttering of your home all with a new attitude.  My family has noticed a huge difference in our home in the past few months and are pitching in to keep it up as well.  We're moving soon to another state and the amount of STUFF that has left this house is amazing!  You will feel so liberated getting rid of the things that don't bless your family or home and that you don't love.  I bought the book for a friend and know she will soon be flying as well.  Get the book and God Bless you!
B00006L9ZT|2.0|It seems that the views as regards this production have been rather polorised. Well, instead of analysing the merits and faults of this production, which other reviewers can evidently do better than I can, I would only say that I'm rather bored when watching this monumental cycle on DVD. The point is that there're very few places in this production where the drama or the music really lifts off. For most of the time, the production remains resolutely earth-bound. The singing and acting are mostly mediocre, and the camera work is quite unimaginative. In fact, I enjoy listening to the Ring cycle on audio CD more than when watching this DVD set. Others may of course have a different view. But for me, I'm more than a little disappointed by what I see and hear.
B00007AJF9|5.0|I first saw this movie in June 2003, and I was shocked in how well this movie is directed and played. I feel that Cate Blanchette's performance deserved her the Academy Award that she did not win. Although Gwenth Platrows performance was always good in Shakespeare in love, I just feel that she won because of politics. This movie is for anyone who likes a great movie. I think this should have won for art design, picture, director, and Best ACTRISS.
B00005JM03|3.0|For your average popcorn flick, The Italian Job is pretty average.<br />Let me first state that I'm a lover of heist/con flicks. I try to catch all that I can. Part of the fun of the movie is just seeing how they pull off the job. In this sense, The Italian Job is ok. Overall, the movie is predictable, but it's still fun watching these thieves do their job.<br />The characters in the film are all cliche but you'll like em anyway. Seth Green's character, Napster (the supposed real inventor of the program) is my favorite. The cast is talented, but their performances feel very boxed in. I attribute this to the MTV video style directing that never lets any performances shine.<br />Possibly the film's biggest flaw is the marketing. If you've seen the trailer to this film, you've seen the movie. I'm not kidding, it's basically a Cliff's Notes of the film. There's not a single surprise in store that the trailer doesn't reveal. It's really too bad, because watching the film I get a sense that some of the twists might have actually been surprising.<br />The best thing I can say about the film is that it isn't bad. You'll be entertained, just not wowed! I don't feel like I wasted my money at the theatre, but I do think the film could have been much better. So if these kinds of movies are up your alley, catch a matinee, and see the best commercial for a BMW Mini ever made.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|I Would Like To Reccommend This Cd To Anyone Who Likes Pop. It Is A Great Cd That Has Lots Of Great Songs. My Favorite Is &quot;Not Gonna Get Us&quot;. The Album Gets Me Real Hyped Up When I Hear It. It Is Worth The Money.
B00008LDPU|5.0|This is some of the most amazing Anime out there right now. The first episode, which is all CGI is unreal and the roster of artists is just incredible. This is a must have for all Matrix fans as well as all Anime fans. Don't sleep on this, go get a copy!
B00008OWZC|3.0|This recording is an archive. It is analogous to finding a papyrus scroll of Egyptian incantations. You can read the words, but all ceremony is lost. Gone from the recording is the anticipation of the upcoming concert, the atmosphere of the crowd, the joy of seeing your musical heroes in person and, perhaps, most important, your youth. In short, all the things that made the music at a Led Zeppelin concert great. This is not a bad recording. It is exciting some of the time, boring some of the time and self-indulgent most of the time. In other words, just like the baby-boomer generation which comprise its most ardent fans. At this point, I must confess that I am a baby-boomer and a true Led Zeppelin fan. I can tell you not only all of the group's albums and songs, but the order of each song on each album. I saw the group on this particular tour in San Diego. I loved every minute of the concert. My ears rang for days. All that having been said, with the benefit of thirty-something years, I ask myself, Is this great music? The answer: Of course not.  Oftentimes, I regret to report, it is not even good music.  For perspective, listen sometime to Mahler's \\"Sixth Symphony,\\" Strauss' \\"Four Last Songs\\" or Puccini's \\"Madama Butterfly\\".  If I could summarize, I would say that the appeal of this recording has very little to do with music and everything to do with trying to recapture that brief shining moment before our lives and everything in it became so complicated.  The people who will enjoy this recording fall into two camps:  Nostalgic baby boomers like me who ran out immediately and bought it (and who would run out immediately and buy another live set if Led Zeppelin was to release it) and those members of Generation X and younger who want to get some notion of what the commotion was all about.    After reading my review again after a little over two years had passed, I wanted to add a postscript.  By way of background, I saw two Led Zeppelin concerts, in 1973 and 1977.Both of them were in San Diego.  I missed the 1972 tour because I attended Boy's State.  I missed the 1975 tour because I was attending college in a small town in New Hampshire.  Led Zeppelin's last tour of the United States was in 1977.  This was 28 years ago.  What this means is that the youngest people who actually saw Led Zeppelin in concert are now in their 40's.  I have read many of the posted reviews.  I suspect that the majority of these reviewers are in their 30's or younger.  Now, I am not trying to pull rank here.  What I am suggesting is that these reviewers may be trying to overcompensate for not having actually seen Led Zeppelin in concert by overly effusive, even slobbering praise of this CD.  For those who never saw Led Zeppelin in concert, let me say that it was not the most awesome event ever.  Yes, there were some awesome moments, but there were also some dull, boring and tedious ones, too.  On this CD, like the Led Zeppelin concerts I remember, there are some awesome moments, but there are also some dull, boring and tedious ones, too.      Let me turn again to the CD itself.  I have two additional issues, which have influenced my opinion of the CD:     First, I question whether or not the CD is actually the original artifact.  The CD comprises a compilation of several concerts, one in Long Beach and the other in Los Angeles.  The concert in Los Angeles at the Forum has been long available on the audience bootleg CD, \\"Burn Like a Candle.\\"  In comparing the bootleg with this CD, it appears to my ear that \\"How the West Was Won\\" was not only remixed, but also \\"touched up,\\" meaning overdubbed in parts.  This would not surprise me; Mr. Page is a perfectionist.  Most live performances have mistakes.  They also contain parts that, for one reason or another, did not record properly.  I doubt Mr. Page would allow anything to be officially released that did not live up to the legend.      Second, I question whether or not the CD is actually the best Led Zeppelin concert available.  To my ear, the \\"Holy Grail\\" of Led Zeppelin concert recordings is the soundboard bootleg, \\"Flying Circus\\" (Madison Square Garden, New York: 1975).  Three years had passed between the concerts which comprise \\"How the West Was Won\\" and the concert comprising \\"Flying Circus.\\"  During this interim, mobile recording technology had improved, I would say dramatically.  In \\"How the West Was Won,\\" the sound is distant.  You feel like you are listening from the balcony.  In \\"Flying Circus,\\" the sound is immediate.  You feel like you are on stage listening.  Also, \\"Flying Circus\\" is a complete concert.  It is not compilation.  Because the recording is a bootleg, there are, additionally, no overdubs.  Finally and most important, Led Zeppelin is playing at what I think was its peak.  I should add that other concert recordings that are as good or, to my ear, better than this CD include the soundboard \\"Listen to This, Eddie\\" (Los Angeles Forum, Los Angeles: 1977) and the soundboard \\"Destroyer\\" (Richfield Coliseum, Cleveland: 1977).
B000093NLH|5.0|This &quot;Platinum Edition&quot;(released in April 2003) of the Scorps' 2001 Acoustica release has all of what the original Acoustica contains, plus 3 bonus audio tracks and some eye candy (extra video) for several dollars cheaper...  Too bad for those who bought the original for more money and got less (no video, and three less songs), but if you haven't already bought Acoustica and want to, you really get a lot of bang for your buck with this one.
B000089A07|4.0|This is a good film, but I liked MANHUNTER more.
B000067CPX|5.0|What can I say?  They aren't the Peppers we've always known.  But let's face it, we all noticed a change in their music when they released Californication.  Anyway, this is a great album.  Older fans of the Peppers will love their maturing style.  Newer fans will love the album because of the powerful and sweet vocals, solid bass, and outstanding guitar riffs.  I am a true old school Peppers fan but I'll admit that By The Way is my second favorite Peppers album, right behind Mother's Milk.  Buy By The Way, you'll be doing yourself a favor.
B00008DDSC|2.0|This film seamed to lack cohesion.  I am not new to this subject, but I just did not get it.
B000002KOO|5.0|Completely original songwriting and playing.  Peter Green (author of &quot;Black Magic Woman&quot;) set the standard with this near perfect blues-rock recording.  &quot;Oh Well&quot; is an emotional and ageless masterpiece combining both electric and acoustic guitar and great lyrics.  For me &quot;Showbiz Blues&quot; is the strongest song on the album, but one could also argue for &quot;Coming Your Way&quot; or &quot;Rattlesnake Shake.&quot;  I owned this in vinyl a long time ago and wore it out several times.  Although different in style, I rank this music with &quot;Who's Next&quot; and &quot;Sgt Pepper&quot; in its influence and importance in rock music.  I can't think of another blues-rock album that matches this one.
B00006JDVV|1.0|This film just did not deliver.
B00008OLYN|5.0|Ok, so I go through a major break-up with this girl and what is the first CD I buy...DAMNATION.  Talk about putting me in a bigger depression than I already was in...I felt like drawing all the blinds in my house, sitting in the corner in complete darkness and ending it all...well not exactly, but this disc is pretty depressing if you aren't in good spirits.<br />I played this disc non-stop for the last two weeks.  It's a really awesome CD...not like anything Opeth has released to date...there are no Cookie Monster vocals on this disc, it's fairly mellow, yet still with a hard/metal edge to it.  I just suggest if you are bi-polar or suffering from major depression to stay clear of this CD.<br />I can't say there really is a bad track on the disc.  Steve Wilson of Porcupine Tree/no-man fame produced Damnation.  Steve brought along a lot of his 70's influence to these songs and I believe has taken Opeth to a new level courtesy of the Mellatron.  Mikael Akerfeldt vocals are incredible, so full of emotion and passion. Martin Lopez, Peter Lindgren and Martin Mendez also do an incredible job making this a truly original album.<br />This is a bittersweet album for me...very emotional...it's a masterpiece.<br />Favorite tracks are Closure, In My Time Of Need, To Rid The Disease and Death Whispered a Lullaby.

0684833395|5.0|It's just one of those books you don't want to put down. I'm real picky when it comes to books catching my interest, but this book made me laugh so hard on so many different occasions that it seemed like an episode of Seinfeld. I've never ever laughed out loud at a book until this one. I highly recommend this and can't wait to read the sequel Closing Time.
B00008OWZC|3.0|The band's performance and selection of songs on this album make an essential to any collection. Though, the sound quality is extremely disappointing. The sound is muddy and flat, making one wonder what, if any effort was put into the production. Maybe it's the best that could be done with the source material. It's hard to beleive that this album with so much potential was done on the cheap, but it makes one wonder.
0156027321|3.0|Winner of Britain's Man Booker Prize (the equivalent of the Pulitzer Prize for Literature here), \\"Life of Pi\\" by Yann Martel is a tale about the power of story and the quest for truth that can best be described as Hemingway's \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" set on its proverbial ear.  Call it \\"The Young Man, the Tiger, and the Sea.\\"<br />We'll get to the tiger later.<br />Named after a famed pool in Paris, Piscine Molitor Patel lives out his young life amid the gentle bustle of life in Pondicherry, India.  His father runs the sole zoo in the area, granting his son an education into the dark recesses of the animal psyche - a gift that will later save his life.  At a time when young men turn their eyes to the fairer sex, Pi - adopting the moniker of the symbolic number in an effort to distance himself from his given name - turns his to the heavens, beginning a spritual quest that makes him perhaps the only Hindu/Muslim/Christian in all of India.  Confounded by this spiritual synergy, everyone in his life is plunged into wondering about Pi's rationality.<br />Rationality is soon at hand when the Patel family elects to leave India amid the crumbling of Indira Gandhi's government.  When Pi is told that Canada is the destination and that the zoo animals will be sold off, he is left to grimly wonder about this new, foreign home.  Setting out by cargo ship with his entire family for North America - along with a few animals destined for zoos in the States - his world is further devastated when the ship sinks in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.<br />While the lighthearted story of this boy occupies the first bit of the book, the tale becomes as deeply, searingly intimate as the ocean is expansive, for Pi must now battle the elements and his own mind.  If not for his friend Richard Parker, the only other survivor of the shipwreck, Pi tells us he surely would have gone mad.<br />But Richard is not what we imagine.  Gaining his name from an unfortunate clerical error, Richard Parker is far less of a man and far more of a 450 pound Bengal tiger.  The ensuing tale of the teen who learns to live adrift on the ocean with a beast capable of crushing most of a human's bones with one swipe of the paw occupies the rest of the book.  Martel weaves an utterly compelling and richly detailed tale of how one can survive not only the harsh cruelty of the open sea, but also the savage wildness of a primeval carnivore.<br />Be forewarned: this book is unflinching in its portrayal of survival, harkening back to adventure novels of long ago that young men would devour page after page late into the night with a flashlight under the sheets.  The squeamish should look for other reading material, as the day to day of Pi's fight to live is horrific.  Martel glimpses life at its rawest, but in those very depths delivers a page-turner that is expertly told.<br />And ultimately, \\"Life of Pi\\" is about the telling.  It's about how stories transcend the mundane and lift us to truth, be it lofty, spiritual truth or the truth of making it through just one more day.<br />Sadly, this is where Martel's creation stumbles.  Pi's spiritual quest that prefaces the shipwreck becomes not so much a desire to know God, but a love affair with stories.  Yet how can mere stories bring salvation and transcendence unless they are rooted in truth?  The ending of the book casts serious doubt on not only the nature of truth, but also the meaning of story.<br />At one point in the novel a character states that Pi's story can make you believe in God, but if we are to believe (or disbelieve) the tale of the young man, the tiger, and the sea, we are left to surmise that God is merely what we fabricate within us: a gauzy, white veil over a grim reality.  By extension, if we have invented God, then truth is only what we subjectively create.  For a book of this kind, it is a moral that consumes itself.<br />So Martel's book concludes with disturbing questions (for those who search for profundity hardenough), virtually ensuring it to be a favorite among juries that award prizes to books.  For the rest of us it is simply best to be lost in the story and appreciate whatever sections can be most appreciated, for in the end the sum of \\"Life of Pi\\" is less than the whole of its exceptionally well-crafted parts.enough), virtually ensuring it to be a favorite among juries that award prizes to books.

B00007E8V4|5.0|System of a Down will never fail me.  Another fantastic CD. The last SOAD CD, \\"Toxicity\\", focused on the point of drugs, espiacially in \\"Prison Song\\".  Now SOAD reflects on political issues, but not really supporting them...  Here's a quick synopsis:<br />1-Chick N' Stu- SOAD resorts to craziness in their opening song for \\"Steal This Album\\".  Awesome. 9/10<br />2-Innervision- Their first single of this album.  What a great pick! Somethnig about re-inventing a bicycle... 9/10<br />3-Bubbles- The first political song on the CD. not one ofmy favorites, but still good. 6/10<br />4-BOOM!- The second political song.  Really packs a BOOM! 8/10<br />5-Nuguns- What a nugun is, I will never know.  But a good song. 8/10<br />6-A.D.D- Another political song. My favorite though, good catchy tune. 10/10<br />7-Mr. Jack- Great instrumental in the biginning.  It just goes uphill from there. 8/10<br />8-I-E-A-I-A-I-O- Another slightly political song.  Their second single of this CD.  The chorus reminds me of African voodoo hymns. 9/10<br />9-36- WAY TOO SHORT! 7/10<br />10-Pictures-Great Guitarring Dave!  Keep it up! 8/10<br />11-The Highway Song- Slow verses and fast chorus.  Good verses and fast chorus.  Good song. Great song.  Tremendous. 10/10<br />12-F**k The System- This song itself should be worth a parental advisory label!  What was going through their heads when they wrote this song? 7/10<br />13-Ego Brain- Awesome good tempo song. Kind of relieves the pressure of the last song. 8/10<br />14-Thetawaves- A lot like Toxicity's Deer Dance.  And I LOVE Deer Dance. 9/10<br />15-Roulette- The slowest song SOAD ever made perhaps, but it really gets in your head after a while.  7/10<br />16-Streamline- KABANG! A killer ending to a killer CD!  Bring on Number 4! 9/10<br />Well, there you have it.  Gobuy this Cd! If you like KoRn, Taproot, MuDvAyNe, and maybe even Rancid, you will LOVE this CD, I gauruntee it.  Even if you don't like those bands, you will love this CD!  Go buy it now!<br />Hope I was helpful!<BR>                               -MIkel Askenzo
0060392886|5.0|I highly recommend this book, regardless of whether you are a Motley Crue fan or not.  This is one of the most entertaining, well-written books I have read in a long time.   Of course, if you are a Motley fan, you will be familiar with the band members and the wild stories, but even a non-fan (such as myself) can get into the story of these four guys.  Neil Strauss did an amazing job.  He covers the band members childhoods, drug use/addictions, the struggle to become the Crue, the successes, the tragedies, the marriages, the divorces, the jail time, the band break ups - you name it, it's all here.    Many of the stories related are not for the easily offended / faint of heart.  There is some pretty hardcore stuff here.  I have to admit I was turned off by quite a few of the guys antics.  And I'm still amazed that there are actually women out there who behave like this.  READ THIS BOOK!   I guarantee you won't be able to put it down.
B000002UAR|5.0|Anyone who is a young person may not have heard of this album.  I am 23 years old, and I know I hadn't heard of most of the songs on it.  Most people have heard a few Beatles songs, but I myself always dismissed the Beatles as &quot;pop&quot; music, sticking to Hendrix and Zeppelin for &quot;real&quot; music.  That was until I heard the Revolver album from start to finish.  It is an eclectic blend of musical styles, and features works by Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison.  &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; paints a great picture, &quot;Taxman&quot; has a poppy yet poignant sound, and &quot;Tommorow never knows&quot;  features some of the most unique and oft-copied sound out there.  If you haven't heard it, buy it and listen from start to finish.  It will change the way you think about music, and the Beatles.  Many people I know who &quot;love the Beatles&quot; hate this album, because it doesn't sound like, &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand,&quot;  or &quot;Can't Buy Me Love.&quot;<BR>To sum up:  GET IT, LISTEN TO IT.
0395951054|3.0|Mein Kampf is a torturous, confused ramble filled with hate, lies and useless metaphors. Although we could equally lambast Stalin or Mao as some of the worst men ever to have lived, Hitler stands apart from all the other sadists of history. Perhaps it was because the man who wrote this book was democratically elected to govern the most civilised country in the world; a nation with a rich tradition of intellectualism and brilliance. After all, Germany produced Kant, Goethe, Nietzsche and Beethoven among others. <br />Hitler is an example of a human being without conscience or feeling, and Mein Kampf offers a dark insight into the depths of human depravity. Read about Gandhi or Mandela to be inspired, read Mein Kampf to be chilled to the core. I think this quote summarizes the man and the magnitude of his stupidity, intolerance and evil: <br />\\"I am freeing men from the restraints of an intelligence that has taken charge; from the dirty and degrading modifications of a chimera called conscience and morality\\" (p.219.)

B00004XMS0|3.0|Batman **** - a solid comic book adaptation.  Michael Keaton does a great job of establishing personal issues of a man convinced to dress in a bat disguise in order to fight crime.  Jack Nicholson does an uncanny performance as the Joker, you'd think the part was made for him.  The best in the series.<br />Batman Returns *** - a more personal adaptation.  It's obvious here that due to the success of the first film, the producers gave Dir. Burton more freedom to tell the story.  Not a great idea, movies like this need a better balance between producer/director.  Burton purists may hate that comment.  Still good, but recommend Edward Scissorhands for the director's personal vision.  It's basically the same story.  Michelle Pfeiffer is outstanding, Danny DeVito is good and Christopher Walken is well, Chrisotpher Walken in top form with maybe the funniest line in any Batman film, \\"Bruce Wayne, why are you dressed up like Batman?\\"<br />Batman Forever ** - the beginning of the end.  Dir. Schumacher brings an action packed script to life with a drastically different style from the Burton era.  This shouldn't even really be viewed with the first two.  The performances are good enough, I like Val Kilmer's version of Batman, but not as much as Keaton's.  Jim Carrey, Tommy Lee Jones and Nicole Kidman are all good and end up saving the movie.<br />Batman & Robin * - the end.  Some hate Clooney's performance as the Batman, but Clooney is more the ideal Bruce Wayne in the comic books (pre-Burton comics that is).  If only Clooney had shook is ER head bobbing problem, he might have given a better performance, but as it stands: not as good as Keaton, better than Kilmer.  Schwarzenegger and Thurman are over stylized villians and strangely out of place due to Schumacher's second failed attempt.  Avoid this film unless a big fan of any of the artists' work.<br />Final Note - Avoid the legacy and just buy the first two, they're more of a legacy than with the addition of the second two and make a great double feature.  Enjoy.

B000022TSW|5.0|A feature-length version of the cult TV show, \\"South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut\\" is a brilliantly subversive attack on all the holier-than-thou types who take it upon themselves to tell everyone else how to run their lives. Not only that, the film features about a dozen musical numbers which make Disney's music sound like bland pabulum.    The story goes something like this: In the quiet Colorado town of South Park, four kids sneak into an R-rated movie and come out gleefully repeating the many varied and creative obscenities heard within. Their parents go ballistic, and in their crusade to scour all naughty language from society in general get us into a war with Canada. Also along for the ride are Conan O'Brien, Brooke Shields, the Baldwin brothers, Bill Clinton, Satan and Saddam Hussein.    \\"South Park: BL&U,\\" co-written by \\"South Park\\" creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, is likely to be the funniest cartoon feature in a long time as it skewers sacred cows and stereotypes left and right. The musical numbers, likewise satirizing everything from Disney to Rogers & Hammerstein, could carry the movie all by themselves, ranging from Satan's ballad \\"Up There\\" to the \\"Les Miz\\"-ish \\"La Resistance.\\" And let us not forget the \\"Oklahoma!\\"-y number of which the song title itself is unprintable, to say nothing of the lyrics.    Parents should be aware that this cartoon film is absolutely not for kids, as it features deviant sex, some very bloody cartoon violence, and a truly stunning amount of profanity. But for everyone who is tired of people butting into everyone else's business or just needs a good, high-spirited laugh, \\"South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut\\" is for you.

B000002UCQ|5.0|After ten years of being the odd man in the Beatles legend - possessing neither John Lennon's genius and amazing charisma, Paul McCartney's beautiful voice and unlimited musical talent nor Ringo Starr's charm and lovability, and with no more than two writing credits per album, George Harrison's first major solo album (excluding his two highly experimental albums, `Electronic Sounds' and `Wonderwall Music' turned out to be just as impressive, if not more so, than those of his peers - Paul McCartney's hasty `McCartney' and John Lennon's `Plastic Ono Band' (again, excluding two non-commercial attempts - `Two Virgins' and `The Wedding Album'). Some of it is thanks to the wonderful musicians backing him - namely, Derek and the Dominoes, with Eric Clapton on guitar and the remarkable Jim Gordon on drums - but that's not all of it. During the Beatles' final recording years it was quite clear that George was not fulfilling his potential, and that his wonderful masterpiece songs on these albums (`Something', `Here Comes The Sun', `While My Guitar Gently Weeps', `I Me Mine') were just barely the tip of the barrel.<br />As George himself explained, he returned from India in 1968 with an incredible number of new songs, only very few of which were recorded by the Beatles. As Anthology teaches us, many of the songs on `All Things Must Pass' were written during the Beatles days - like the title song or `Wah-Wah'. George left the Beatles with so much unused material that, while Paul and John experimented in small and earnest albums, George's talent exploded over an amazing TRIPLE-ALBUM (now squashed into a 2-CD set) with even less fillers than the White Album had, with a troupe of incredible players and big arrangements - even a few instrumental jams. In years to come, George would be the Beatle most involved in the music world and most inclined to work with other musicians (e.g., the Traveling Willburies) and `All Things Must Pass' is the beginning of the inclination. Influences of Clapton, the Allman Brothers and the Byrds, not to mention Dylan, are all over the album. On the other hand, it also sounds more like the Beatles than any other Beatle solo release.<br />Almost all of the songs on `All Things Must Pass' are classics, and despite a couple of cover versions (like a great homage to Bob Dylan on `If Not For You'), most of it is all George. `My Sweet Lord' is one of his greatest solo hits. `Wah-Wah' is a fantastic, eccentric rocker. `What Is Life', `Isn't It A Pity' (both versions) and the beautiful title song are classic pop tunes with great guitar interplay by Harrison and Clapton, two of the most important guitarists of the 60s. George's folky, Dylan-ish side shows on `Apple Scruffs' and `Behind That Locked Door' and `Let It Down' is a great rock song. The instrumental pieces on the second CD are surprisingly good and George gets opportunities to shine as a guitarist like he never did with the Fab Four.<br />George is, to my taste, the one Beatle who never fell. Though he never reached the level of genius the Lennon/McCartney music contained during their Beatles years, he didn't disappoint in his solo music as those two, and continued to make wonderful music up until his untimely death last year. `Cloud Nine', `George Harrison' and `Dark Horse', as well as the new release `Brainwashed', are all fantastic albums. `All Things Must Pass', however, remains his best. Essential for any Beatles fan, essential altogether.
068484267X|4.0|Angela's Ashes has given me a better look on poverty and how we should value the things that we have. It would be a good book to use in senior english classes because it's so emotional and it makes you realize how lucky you really have it.At first I thought of not even wanting to read Angela's Ashes because it was too long, but once i started the first few chapters it had gotten too interesting to just put down and quit.I would recommend this book to anyone just because it has a good plot and the author just really showed me how awful he has had it to live in such poverty. It really made me appreciate more of what I have.
0440219078|3.0|My son wouldn't finish this book.  I did, but I didn't enjoy it at all.  We're in a fantasy world (something I usually like), but one where the rules of the game are never really explained -- this means that incidents happen without, seemingly, making sense in the terms of the world we are plunged into.  Also (and this is why my son wouldn't finish it) the book is depressing in a way I found not only cruel, but gratuitous.  I have no problem letting my son read \\"The Yearling\\" or other books where the outcome is far from pleasant, but the ending of this one seemed nasty in a way that's acceptable perhaps because of the culture we live in.  I felt a lesson was being pushed down my throat -- and I didn't like the lesson.  I know the book won an award -- but it's not the only winner of the Newbery that may prove not to age well.
B000002H8F|4.0|The Pixies are my favourite band, hands down. I'd like to get my opinion about that out here first, and say why this album didn't get five stars. Before this, the Pixies were energetic, edgy and somewhat raw, all the way. After this (Trompe le Monde) they still had the same energy, but with a more complex sound and more beauty. The theme changed too, from incest and bodily harm to spacy weirdness. Bossanova seems to be the crossroad, and pulls it off nicely, but not perfectly. Some of the songs are excellent, like Velouria, Cecila Ann, Blown Away and Havalina. Other songs though...not so good. (Stormy Weather, a very boring song, comes to mind) That's probably the only flaw with this cd, is some songs are boring because they drag too much. I do enjoy this album though, and listen to it frequently. Anyone getting into the Pixies should first check out Surfer Rosa or Dolittle, then Trompe le Monde, and then finally get around to this little gem.
B00005KB9T|5.0|&quot;Catch a Fire&quot; may not be the first album by Bob Marley and the Wailers, but it did help put the band (and, by extension, reggae music) on the map with mainstream listeners.  As with virtually all Marley albums, this 1973 CD stands tall on the merits of its tight melodies, solid instrumentation, and the often politically charged lyrics on cuts like the impassioned &quot;Slave Driver,&quot; &quot;400 Years&quot; (a Peter Tosh original), and &quot;No More Trouble,&quot; a tough jam that can be interpreted as a pro-peace/anti-war anthem.  But for me, the album's high point is the catchy &quot;Stir it Up,&quot; one of his most familiar tunes that captures the essence of a classic reggae song.  Some complain that it's a bit long-winded at over 5 minutes, but for me, the groove is just fine as it is.  This reissue has two bonus songs that really aren't bonus songs at all: &quot;High Tide or Low Tide&quot; and &quot;All Day All Night.&quot;  They were actually available on the early version of &quot;Catch a Fire&quot; but were later deleted from future pressings.  It's good to have them back so the listener can absorb the album as it was originally released.  I wouldn't exactly recommend this album as a first Bob Marley purchase, but it's still an essential recording and a definite classic that definitely shouldn't be overlooked.
0783227019|5.0|Carlito's Way stands as a fine testament to brilliant filmmaking. Beginning with the opening credits, De Palma takes the viewer through a black and white color framed death.We know that Carlito Brigante will face a trajic death and  yet the viewer will keep his or her eyes glued to the screen as this story develops. Suddenly, the color changes and we are swept away to a 1970's new york city courtroom where Brigante is released from prison thanks to the skills of his diabolical lawyer(Kleinfeld) played by Sean Penn. The premise of Carlito's Way is that a reformed criminial can never survive because of past history. Throughout the movie, Carlito plays his antagonists like a russian chess player.  However, Carlito's inability to return to the ethos of the criminial code of conduct eventually seals his fate.<BR>   This DVD is fantastic!! Carlito's Way is brilliantly filmed. You definitely feel like you are walking through the streets and Dance clubs of  1970's New York. De Palma provides a fantastic 70's texture to this film. Since I have a stereo system attached to my DVD player, I was amazed at the sound quality when Carlito entered various dance and strip clubs. In fact one of the hidden gems of this movie is the disco soundtrack which underlays this story. In addition to the unique sensory experience, this movie explores the mind of the big time criminial. The viewer witnesses a large amount of calculation and negotiation that Carlito must undergo in order to stay alive and pursue his plan of leaving New York. If I have not mentioned Carlito is surrounded by colorful characters like Kleinfeld(Sean Penn) and Pachanga. In my opinion, the character of Pachanga is fantastically put into the film. Pachanga symbolizes \\"the old school Puerto Rican gangster\\" that Carlito must come to terms with. Though De palma might not have intended to do it I found myself laughing at pachanga's  quirks and gestures. Overall, I give this DVD 5 stars and would recommend this movie to anybody I know!!
B00005R24K|4.0|Welcome to the first film of director Sam Raimi's career, and the first film of what would become a massive cult following for Bruce Campbell.  Here in this film Raimi answers the age-old cinema question:  how do you create a work of art with little money and very [bad] actors?  Answer:  some [great] makeup effects and very psychedelic camera zoom shots.  For pointless trivia, it is about 15 minutes into the movie before someone does the first really stupid thing (unless you count renting an abandoned cabin in middle of the Tennessee woods an act of stupidity in and of itself), namely playing a reel-to-reel tape of a demon invokation spell.  After that, the hits just keep coming.  And therein lies the genius of the movie.  It is so fast-paced that it leaves little room for predictability right up to the ending. Far from being sentimental, Raimi pulls no punches with the carnage, which includes a wonderfully choreographed vine-rape scene!  If you are looking for plausibility, check that at the door; if you are looking for convincing acting, rent Silence of the Lambs...
B00006JL1Z|5.0|This ultimate collection of Fleetwood Mac hits can discontinue production of the sixteen-track Greatest Hits album from 1988. Fifteen of the sixteen tracks from the earlier collection are on this album. The exception is &quot;Big Love&quot; from the still-in-production &quot;Tango In The Night&quot; album. A live version of the song is on &quot;Very Best&quot;. The &quot;Very Best&quot; also features a live version of &quot;Go Insane&quot;,Lindsey Buckingham's personally composed solo hit from 1984. My dad heard this collection and truly loved it since he's a longtime Fleetwood Mac fan. His personal favorite is Stevie Nicks' &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot;.

There's also plenty of material from the self-titled &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; and &quot;Tusk&quot;. &quot;Think <BR>About Me&quot;,one of the &quot;Tusk&quot; tracks is really great. However there are no tracks from the Bob Welch era or earlier. The earliest songs are from 1976.

Stevie Nicks and Christine McVie both went solo at various points in their careers but neither's solo material is contained in this collection.
B00005LB50|3.0|Stampede was the legendary lost album by Buffalo Springfield, which supposedly had some fine tracks, such as Neighbor Don't You Worry, Sell Out, Down To the Wire, and many other hitherto unheard of gems.  Well, to give the box-set some credit, a few of these gems have been brought to light.  There is a fine version of Young's composition, Down To The Wire, which is sung by Stills.  Also included is a song, \\"Down Down Down\\", which would later be recycled for the Country Girl suite on CSN&Y's Deja-Vu album.  There are some good unreleased tracks, but they get buried in the mountain of demos you have to fast forward through to listen to.  To get down to the Nitty Gritty, this set has too much fat and grizzle on it.  The demo tracks are neither shed new light on the composition in question nor are they of good audio quality.  A whole disc (the fourth) is devoted to a remastering of the first two Springfield albums.  Biiiiig deal.  The songs were already scattered across the first three discs at least twice over!  I'm not big on remastering, because usually this involves tweaking a bass line here, and adjusting a treble there to what essentially was the same song in the first place.  The remasters here do no justice to anything.  Did you know that there was an extended version of Bluebird that lasts for over 8 minutes?

Here in this film Raimi answers the age-old cinema question:  how do you create a work of art with little money and very crappy actors?

B000094A6A|5.0|This one will definitely rate up there with Caddyshack, Tommy Boy and Billy Madison on the ratings of the funnies slapstick comedies.  I am not usually a fan of these, because they are never that funny.  I could not stop laughing at this one.  Too funny.
0783114222|5.0|I'm watching this miniseries for about the fifth time (it's great to NordicTrack to). Each time I watch it, I am more impressed.<br />First, it works as a dramatic narrative. The History Channel it ain't! The drama centers around the usual \\"people at risk\\" conflicts, but it derives as much of its energy from the aspirations that drove the people to put themselves at risk. It could easily have collapsed into cheap sentimentality or jingoistic patriotism, but instead, it inspires.<br />Almost as importantly, it doesn't compromise its history to tell its story. I am personally very tired of producers who excuse bad history by saying \\"we're making entertainment, not a documentary.\\" If you're good enough, you can make great entertainment that is great history. This miniseries is a mavelous example of just that. I think that what I enjoy most about the series is that it's as much about the 1960s as it is about the Apollo program. We went through incredible social changes during that decade, and 'From the Earth to the Moon' touches many of them.<br />I don't buy television series on DVD, because I don't think I would watch them more than once in five years. I bought this one, and I bring it off the shelf every year. It's well worth the investment.
B00006ALGL|4.0|There is no doubt that Damien Rice is an excellent songwriter and a fantastic singer. And this is one of those rare albums that you'll fall in love with after just one sitting. Although listening to the whole album in one go can be somewhat exhausting, it's worth it. The songs are a wonderful blend of genres subtley interlaced into Damien's unique style. He manages to exude a combination of total energy and total relaxation. It's the epitome of cool. It's the tension created by that blend that leaves you struggling to catch your breath at the end of the album. <br />As fantastic as the album is, however, it still doesn't manage to capture the feeling you get when you see him live (that's why every review here mentions his live performances). The only times I've seen Damien Rice perform were at the open mike sessions at Molloy's in Dublin, back in 2000 - and it was unbelievable. That spirit, its essence, needs to be captured before I can say give an album of his 5 stars. The reason that this has 4 is because I just don't think that this one lives up to how good he is and when one is released that does, I want to be able to give it the full 5 stars that it deserves! <br />On the other hand, you should buy the album to get a taste for what he's doing (and to support a fantastic musician). He is nothing but pleasure to listen to, his melodies are exquisite, his music is infinitely powerful; have a listen to Blower's Daughter and you will instantly fall in love. <br />I can't wait to hear his next album, but for now, I'll definitely be happy with this one. You will too.
0446310786|5.0|I read To Kill a Mockingbird in high school. When the books were passed out, I thought that it was going to be another boring book that was mandatory to read. However, once the themes were discussed, they made me realize that such problems go on in the world even today - racism, social status, etc. This book showed the parochial views of the citizens of Maycomb. I loved how the Finch family overlooked the rumors that were spreading and Atticus defended what (and who) he thought was right. I definitely recommend this book!
B00008S2VG|5.0|I am sure there are a lot of people out there who are completely confused about this album due to all the critics that vary from sky-high to inferno levels, so I thought the time had come to present my personal answers to some very relevant and certainly common questions.<br />Q: What is the reason for such discrepancy between opinions?<BR>A: This is an album totally different from anything she has done before. It mixes rap with techno and guitar acoustics. Her voice has also been distorted with a vocoder, and it sounds similar to the effects used in the \\"Paradise (Not for Me)\\" track. Well, some Madonna fans were just not ready for such a change, and those who enjoy this kind of tune are not regular Madonna purchasers, so it is possible this album will stay in a sort of a category limbo. Anyway, for many others (like me) \\"American Life\\" is a groundbreaking and inspiring change that defines a whole new musical genre.<br />Q: I was told the lyrics in this album stink. Is it true?<BR>A: Let us say Madonna is one of the few artists (very few, even) who can afford to transport their very true feelings into their music. You will find no \\"baby don't you know, I love you so, so please don't go\\" kind of songs here. On the other hand, you'll have your ears filled up with sincere words that truly depict Madonna's life and feelings. If you're not ready to hear her complaint how stupid she was for being so materialistic and that she does not want to have it simple but rather to work like a bull, well ... stay away from this album. Again, my opinion is she deserves an ovation for being so damn courageous.<br />Q: This album is anti-american, so I feel compelled not to buy it. What about you?<BR>A: This is possible the silliest affirmation ever. This is an album about her intimate feelings and has absolutely nothing to do with anti-Americanism. You'll only feel offended if, in your opinion, Americanism equals hypocrisy, irrational materialism and loss of innocence, because these are the values she speaks against. Even her self-censored video clip was antiwar, not anti-american, and there's a huge difference between these two positions.<br />Q: I've heard most of the tracks are bad, so is it really worth to buy it?<BR>A: Let us say I used to hit my \\"skip\\" button about four times during the first hearings, but even the less sticky tunes start to grow in you after a while. It is certainly not a \\"hearer friendly\\" album for the Madonna habitués, but after you give it a few spins you'll find yourself mumbling the songs often during the day.<br />Q: So hey! Should I buy it, or what?<BR>A: My (humble) opinion is ... yes! This album was not made to hit a sales record, so it is possible many commercial pop buyers will stay away from it as a Norah Jones fan would certainly stay away from an Iron Maiden record, but if you are musically open minded this is certainly an album worth discovering. And in these days, innovation alone deserves a five star review. There you go!
B000068QY7|4.0|Ok I just read the \\"expert\\" review at the top of this page, and I have to agree: the stealing of other people's ideas is not to be cheered.  Oh I am not speaking of Oasis, I am speaking of the reviewer stealing the oldest Oasis-critique in the book: \\"they rip off the Beatles.\\"  Anyone wanna know whay this is all you ever hear or read?  its because its all they got on Oasis.  Legitimate critics will critique the work itself on a minute level, but such overarching statements emplyed by the \\"expert\\" are signs of lazyness and dare I say New York Times-esque story stealing.  Here is a top story: Oasis is a great band, they are here to stay, and while they might remind people of the Beatles it is less because they rip them off than it is because the Beatles revolutionized ALL modern popular music.  Its like saying everytime a car manufacturer uses the assembly line to make cars they are ripping off Ford.  If you want to know the true genious and impact of Oasis, read every review of every band to come out of Britain since 1995....you will find the word \\"Oasis\\" in every \\"expert's\\" critique.<br />PS: Album is pretty darn good too ;-)
B000083E79|3.0|In my opinion, she has produced far too few material to justify another \\"Very Best of ...\\" so few years after the last similar release.<br />This was clearly made to take advantage of her new techno-pop diva status she has conquered with \\"Believe\\" and that she is finding quite difficult to perpetuate. Facts are ... no matter how much plastic you put on the outside, your energy and stamina come from the inside and there is nothing you can do turn back time on those.<br />The only plausible explanation for such a hurry is the fact this is definitely a farewell album. Nevertheless, it is a farewell album for someone who deservedly achieved a music diva status after ongoing four decades of relative success.<br />Concluding, this is an album worth buying for Cher's newest fans (add a star to my review). For those who have been staying with her since her pre-\\"Believe\\" works, I think the newest themes included in this album do not justify purchasing a third \\"Best of ...\\".<br />As for Cher, it's certainly \\"bye-bye music\\" and \\"movies, here I come again\\"!!!
157492589X|5.0|See also McMurtry's book of the same title. The film is exceptionally faithful to the book. But see the movie first, because Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones fit the two main characters perfectly: you'll hear their voices as you read the book (warning to Germans: don't buy a dubbed version of the film!). No one can write about Texas like McMurtry, and no actor can play a Texan like Duvall! What's it about:? The short transition period from the time of the outlaws (the lawmen were also outlaws now and then, as is portrayed in the film) and Indians, and the transition to the boring money-civilization of banks, shopkeeping, and corporate ranching. In this connection, see also the oral histories collected in the fine book 'In Their Own words'. My Geman wife hates kitch, smells it a mile a way, and loves both Lonesome Dove and The Evangelist, both played by Duvall. She also loves West Texas but hates the fences there. There's much more freedom of motion in Europe than in the fenced-in U.S. In Europe, you can walk across a farmer's land without asking permission, whereas in Texas you shouldn't.
B00006LLLN|4.0|Allison Krauss ? The voice of an angel is right here!<BR>A fantastic performance but I agree with other reviewers that the best bet for a new AKUS listener is the &quot;Now that I've Found You&quot; CD. <BR>As for this Live performance - top notch vocals all around as well as talented musicians.<BR>I loved the crowd interaction.
B00008J2DQ|4.0|If you're a rock fan, and are looking for a great new cd to listen to, buy Godsmack's &quot;Faceless&quot;. I've always been told &quot;don't buy the cd, until you've heard about 3 songs from it.&quot; Well, I had only heard 1 song from the album, and knew I loved the group, so I bought the cd after only hearing that one song. Let me tell you, the CD is AMAZING! I absolutly LOVE it! If you're not much of a rock fan now, when you hear this CD, I guarantee you'll love rock and roll as much as I do! So go out and buy &quot;Faceless&quot;. And if you like that CD, try looking for anything else by Godsmack. Trust me, it's worth it!
0156027321|5.0|This is the most original book I have read in a long while.  I was absolutely transfixed with the story and with Martel's writing.  I felt I had discovered a whole new world, and read and learned eagerly through the whole book.  I was sorry to see it end, but the ending was both thought provoking and satisfying.<br />As for the reviewers who quibble about whether or not the book does or does not make you believe in God, I say:  Get over it.  If you paid any attention at all to the pre-shipwreck part of the book, you would have understood why Pi would make that claim.
B00003CXZ4|4.0|This movie works, because, besides told backwards, each scene in the movie leaves you pondering how and why. For example, why is he running, from who, or is he run after someone.  This story keeps you glued to the story line to figure out who each of these characters and what are they doing to Leonard.  Also it would probably be more on the funny side if you get to see this movie in a normal format.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|The acting wasn't bad the set decoration and costume design was super nice and there were 4 nominations this missed at the oscars: BEST DIRECTOR,BEST ACTOR(lead),BEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY,BEST ACTOR(supporting) this is a dvd you have to own I bought it and it is presented in a carton box with colorful pictures and a colorful booklet.For amazon viewers BUY THIS DVD!<br />Ive seen CHICAGO, MOULIN ROUGE IS BETTER!
B00008NG5V|3.0|The title to this record is very appropriate...given that the songs go on and on with little variety.  Don't get me wrong, I am a big Jack Johnson fan, but I wish he would branch out a bit and add a little more variety to his music.  I enjoyed his first record more...however, the two are very (perhaps a bit too) similar.  Definitely a great cd for the Summer, just put it on in the background and chill.  However, don't expect to be struck by any phenomenal tunes...just laid-back, basic guitar and vocals.  I would buy JJs first record before on and on.
B000002MUQ|2.0|Oh geez, I think &quot;Balance&quot; and &quot;Van Halen III&quot; should be a two-CD set. Both fit so nicely. Van Halen &quot;III&quot; is flat, boring, and more serious and somewhat political. &quot;Balance&quot; is about the same; nothing interesting, flat-sounding songs, and a more serious flavor. Both CD's lack Van Halen's trademark feel-good, classic party-rock. There is nothing ear-catching about &quot;Balance,&quot; so it's hard to describe this album. About the only bright spots are &quot;Can't Stop Loving You,&quot; which I heard a lot when I was in junior high, and my favorite, &quot;Not Enough.&quot; Sammy and the gang were superb on that song; very heart-felt and full of feeling. You know, &quot;Feelin'&quot; isn't too bad either. It has a razor-sharp edge to it, and cuts through you. I just wish the rest of the album could have been as good as these three. This may have been Sammy's final album with Van Halen, but it's great how they all teamed up again to record &quot;Humans Being&quot; for the &quot;Twister&quot; soundtrack, (which also appears on the &quot;Best Of Vol. 1&quot; album). That song is awesome! Just blows me away.
B00007KWHO|4.0|Yes' second album, Time and a Word, is pretty good, and the bonus tracks are fun.  i believe 6 of the 8 original tracks have a bit of an orchestra playing along with them.  it's nice, but the orchestrations and such aren't always pulled off wonderfully.  in general, though, it's a good album.  i should also mention that a few of the songs have jazz-ish sections that are really great, so if you like early prog, with string arrangements and a hint of jazz, buy.  it's cheap.
B00008DDSA|4.0|A girl with a troubled history behind her - she likes to inflict wounds on her self - gets a job as a secretary with a law firm. When she starts making typing errors, her boss punishes her: firstly with spanking, then by making her crawl on all fours with a letter in her mouth, and building up from there. Curiously, she enjoys the attention that she finds no-where else. Certainly not from her boy friend, who does not give her the excitement that her boss gives her; not from her alcoholic father, nor from her over-protective mother. The attention may be perverse, -and this is a very perverse film- but through it, she discovers her self-esteem and no longer feels the need to inflict wounds on her body. If the psychology passes muster or not, I can't honestly say, but it seems to make narrative sense. <br />Without, I hope, giving too much away, this film has a happy ending, but this only adds to the film's perversity. An unusual film, but an interesting one. I suppose the moral of this film is that there is someone for everyone, or that love is found when desires are met. This may not be Love Story for the 21st Century, but it could be this century's Story of O. Outstanding performances from Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader.
0316666343|4.0|I hesitated to read this book.  I had heard it was about death.  But a murder?  And the story told by the murdered girl?  This book was very upsetting, but I couldn't stop reading it.  I think alot of people have some sort of idea what their heaven may be, so I was glad to read what heaven may be like from someone else's perspective.  I think the book was nicely written.  It's just the whole subject was very emotional and upsetting to read.
0440178002|5.0|This book takes place in 16th century Japan where feudal lords ruled over the land. A place where foreigners were called barbarians and any contact with them was considered preposterous. After a young talented captain lands in Japan in a storm he quickly adapts and learns the customs and over time is let into the Japanese civilizations. This captain was rare because he was English. He sailed with a mostly Dutch crew. When he lands in Japan he faces more problems then just the samurais and lords. The Portuguese and Spanish also had had landed in years before and since at the time England and Portugal were at war they treated him very harshly. He becomes a samurai and learns the languages. He quickly becomes a key player in the growing conflict between the two most important feudal lords. Since he had the power over ships and understood operations of the ships. One of these lords was Toranaga he was on the regent council of Japan and basically ruled Japan. He took the captain Blackthorn under his wing and helped him.  Shogun has so many leaders and characters.  Shogun has literally hundreds of side plots that lead up into the larger plot. From assassination attempts to ninjas to coups to basically anything else one could think of. I wouldn?t recommend this book to any one though. It does have some mature content, and shouldn?t be read by anyone under the age of 14. It has a great plot with many plot twists. The number of characters is endless and is very historically correct. I give it 5 out of 5 stars for the mature reader? Many people may give up on it because it is so long, I believe that every part of the book was required and help add to the plot.
B00008LDPU|1.0|I am an avid Matrix fan. So I was excited to have my copy of AniMatrix arrive in my mailbox. I quickly opened it and watched through all 9 episodes. I watched the first one and thought this is real good stuff. Unfortunately, the only one worth watching was the first one. Each one that followed got stranger as I watched them. My teen-aged sons said it looked like the Matrix on drugs when it came to the other eight.<br />Unless you are really into the amine art/cartoons, it would be best to only rent this video.
B00008H2LB|5.0|This is truly one of the best CDs I've ever bought.  After hearing their first single, \\"Somewhere I Belong\\" I knew the CD was going to be good, but as soon as I bought the CD and listened to it all the way through, I was in awe.  It knocked me on my seat with all of it's majesty!  The only complaint I have with the CD is it's length.  It is a short CD for the price, but it more or less makes up for it if you buy the enhanced version with the DVD.  I highly recommend buying this CD to a fan of any genre.
0062502182|5.0|Though this book only took an hour or so to read, the impact it made was far greater than that of the most detailed book. Coelho writes in such a way that it is easy to read between the lines. The book is simple, yet the message it sends to the reader is extremely complex and deep. A young boy begins by discussing his life as a shepard, and everything he learns from his sheep. As the novel progresses, and the boy meets many new people on the way, the boy becomes more spirital and gains new understanding of life and how people communicate. I have read this book time and time again and gain a new understanding of life each time.
B00006JJ1O|1.0|Okay, \\"All the Things She Said\\" has kind of a catchy beat, which will probably be enough to lift this duo to the level of a bona fide one hit wonder. But six months from now when TATU bashing has become the new fad of the minute, how many of the people who are now blathering on about how soul baring and authentic these girls are will be the same ones saying oh, of course they aren't really lesbians and they're totally fake and we knew it all along? TATU's \\"performance\\" at the MTV movie awards was just embarrasing. They ripped off Eminem, having a bunch of pretend lesbian school girls march on to the stage and pretend to make out, and they were obviously lip synching. So should the quality of the music be judged separately from the authenticity of the group? Of course, and the quality of the music is just plain bad. I don't know who the people are out there who insist that two whiny voices screeching \\"you're not gonna get us!\\" over and over is somehow the best music they've heard in years, but they should really think about getting on medication. This is a pop duo for the dirty old man in all of us.
0385507755|5.0|James Frey pulls no punches in this harrowing, rage-fueled book about his descent into addiction, and, more importantly, about his recovery. I could relate to his struggles (though my addictions are not the same as his) and his rebellious attitudes toward the treatment &quot;party line.&quot; Though unlike him I ultimately embraced the 12 steps, there were many aspects of my treatment I surely didn't buy, and like him I went kicking and screaming and sometimes just did my own thing. I could relate to The Fury he described, the feelings of self-loathing, the struggles he and his fellow patients went through. I've heard their stories; they are at once the same and yet unique, and I think he captures that well. I think he also captures the joy that can come from recovery. I was amazed at how many times people smiled and laughed in the book. Yet I can remember all the smiles and laughter in my own three months in treatment.<br /><br />As for the question about the 12 steps, here's my take on it. First, I think Mr. Frey doesn't totally understand the concept. He seems to think that people who believe in the 12 steps take no responsibility for their actions. That is not the case. True, we see addictions as diseases, brought on genetically, fueled by childhood traumas. But there is still choice involved, especially once we understand our addictions. I know food is an addiction for me; obviously, I can't stop eating, but I can choose not to have that dessert. The 12-step program gives me tools--people to call, a sponsor, meetings, readings--to help me make the choice not to eat compulsively. That said, the 12 step program is not a perfect program, and it doesn't work for everyone. One of the other things we learn is not to do other people's inventory. Mr. Frey has been sober for 10 years, so who am I to say that what he is doing isn't working? I will say that if someone is reading this book and is facing an addiction problem, don't give up on the 12-step method, but don't believe it is your only option, either.ieve it is your only option, either.
0440237688|4.0|THE GIVER: A book review by Stephan and Dominik<br />We read the book `The Giver' by Lois Lowry with our English teacher at  Schwalmgymnasium (senior high school) in Treysa, Germany.<BR>We reacted differently. We think it is too unreal but also very exciting. While reading the story you don't know what happens next, there are many surprises in the story. The idea to that story is very good but someway very silly. In this perfect world there is no pain and no feelings like love or something else. We think this world is very boring because everything is planned and you aren't allowed to choose your partner or your job. Something good is that there is no war. But in the community there are no colours, no weather, no cars and even no real families. Everything seems as a real world but it isn`t because they live a lie. They can't carry their own life in their own hands, the Elders control everything.<BR>The book has an open end which makes the reader think.<BR>We think that the end is too abrupt. While reading you will note that it is a typical science-fiction book.<BR>If you are interested in science-fiction books this book is OK for you.
076790592X|5.0|This is a book I read in summer school.  It was a very thoughtful story.  A college professor who had cancer used the last days of his life to teach his formal student the most valuable lessons, the lessons of life and death. The student in the story wrote this book himself, everything in this was very honest and it really worth people to read it.
B000089QEN|5.0|Simply put:  a magnificent rendering of the novel. One can't imagine any other filmic incarnation. The casting is astonishing, right down to each and every extra. The editing and direction are impeccable. And the music is so spectacularly appropriate, even though its raucousness - at times - seems so twentieth century. This of course helps the production stay fresh and modern, whilst absolutely nailing the society and period it depicts.<br />A truly ragingly funny adaptation - rampant with human foibles and greed, vicious and deliciously bold, heartbreakingly tender and beguiling. <br />Andrew Davies is indeed a very, very capable screenwriter. And Marc Munden a decidedly gifted director.
B00008LOS1|5.0|along with machine head,aqualung,volume 4,and street corner talkin,sticky fingers,we can safely  conclude that they belong to the class of masterpieces where not a single track in the album is boring.<BR>from baba o riley up to wont get fooled again,you are sure to experience an hours delight of listening.thanks to TRACK RECORDS for re mastering and adding bonus materials to this masterpiece of masterpiece.i am very sure that mr.TOWNSHEND will nod his approval with my observation.i have been listening to this album for 27 years, and it gets stronger every year.a millenium ahead in its time. every rock music lover must have this album.
B000068QZK|2.0|No Rest For The Wicked was definitely a comedown after the decent The Ultimate Sin album. This is Ozzy's first album with Zakk Wylde on lead guitar and although his playing is impressive, the songs for the most part aren't very good. The first three tracks: \\"Miracle Man\\", \\"Devil's Daughter\\", and \\"Crazy Babies\\" are the strongest tracks on the album. The track \\"Hero\\", which was untitled on the original release, is also a decent track. The rest of the album consists of unmemorable songs like \\"Breaking All The Rules\\", \\"Tattooed Dancer\\", and one of Ozzy's worst tracks ever, \\"Demon Alcohol.\\" The band is top notch, as they are all on of Ozzy's albums, but the songs aren't up to par. I would recommend this fans of Zakk Wylde for the excellent guitar playing but otherwise Ozzy has made much better albums than this one, particularly those with Randy Rhoads.

0425152251|5.0|This is a story about a little girl who was taking secret classes with a mysterious philosopher.  The story made me think a lot, it led me enter the door of philosopher or thinking and wondering of life.  There were also many other issues involved in this story such as: science, religion, and mythology.  After I read this book I discovered that those things are not as hard to understand as what I had expected.  They are really based on very simple thoughts
6304698798|5.0|Is there any way to get a version that includes these missing scenes? I ordered the Italian version, but it doesn't have any of these scenes. Does anyone know? I'm sure we would all enjoy the extra footage.<br />Original review from November 1999***<BR>The DVD is great but does not feature all scenes which originally belong to the movie but were cut because of the film length. Missing are: The 'Tuco in a cave sequence' (where he hires the 3 banditos), a longer 'Tuco torturing scene', the 'Eastwood in bed with a mexican woman' sequence and a short scene which explains how Angel Eyes got the job in the prison camp.
B00005AREQ|5.0|with the exception of larry coryell-CORYELL lp, thas lp by beck can claim the title of the best jazz-rock guitar album.the playing displayed by beck set the standards by which jazz guitar will be measured.tracks like (cause weve ended as lovers)alone is worth the price of the album.i really believed that the pack of mclaughlin,diMeola,metheny,deLucia and others will surely envy his style. A JAZZ GUITAR EXTAVAGANZA ALBUM.do not forget to buy it.

0062502182|4.0|This is an adventure story about a shepherd named Santiago who was traveling from Spain to Africa looking for treasure.  But what this story really about was philosophy; and the boy was really looking for his reason to live, his destiny or where he belongs to.  This book taught me that we should pay more attention to things that we saw everyday, then we were discover the wonders and joy of life.
B00005JM1F|4.0|How old are these guys? That one guy was almost a hundred years-old! \\"Old School\\" was a very funny movie and Frank \\"The Tank\\" (Will Ferrell) was pure laughtersome (genius!). You're crazy man, you're crazy. The part where Mitch Martin (Luke Wilson) and his buddies kidnapped their pledges was hilarious and the BJ instructor (Andy Dick) was hysterically witty! Crouching Tiger, Hidden Twig was off-the-wall comedy. Earmuffs were awesome once Vince Vaughn said, \\"FSB.\\" This movie was great.
B000069CWE|5.0|It seems rather simplistic and too much of an understatement to call this a fantastic album. What adjectives would I use instead? How about revolutionary, visionary, ridiculously innovative? Renanimation is a record that blows away genre restrictions, cliches and stereotypes, inventing and reinventing itself all through the 20 tracks on the album. With tracks like P5shing Me A*wy, Enth E ND, FRGT/10, Istp Kloser and Krwling (which is worth the price of the album alone) Linkin Park have set the standards for every other remix album to follow. No longer will I settle for a fast beat on a previous ballad, three-guest vocalists on a song that originally had two, big name producers who put their stamp of popularity on a record. Instead, I will now insist that each song on a remix album is literally reinterpreted, to open my mind to how many more directions a particular song could have taken, adding beats where I least expect it, show me how pointless genres concepts can be when music is done for the simple sake of being creative. Because that is what Linkin Park have delivered with this extraordinary record.<br />Revolutionary, visionary, ridiculously innovative? Reanimation is all that and more. So you invented the remix did you P.Diddy? Wrong, Linkin Park have made that domain all their own.

0140390693|4.0|Little Women, a classic novel written by Louisa May Alcott, is about four girls coming of age during the Civil War. It tells of the lessons they learn and how love conquers all. Even though I had seen the movie before I read the book, I found the book to be intriguing, romantic and kept me hooked from the beginning. The one aspect of this book I did not care for was how the author described relationships or objects, which went on for sometimes pages at a time. That was the only downside, beside it being over 750 pages and not letting me read any other books for a month.<BR>Otherwise, this was an excellent novel that I will remember and keep as one of my treasured books; it has taught me many lessons that I will remember always.
0790733226|5.0|Contact is a work of art, a scientific masterpiece, and an all-around great movie. This is the kind of movie that gives you goosebumps while motivating you to explore your world as well as yourself. Truly amazing. I saw it 13 times in the theatre. I've seen it at least as many in my home. One of my top five all time favorites.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This is truly What I have been waiting for over 30 years! Finally a Music DVD that does the best Rock band of all time some justice. I wonder where they have been hiding this great footage, it's just about every great Zeppelin song you ever wanted to see live on two DVD's That amps up through the years song by song. Its a History of their music in order, all live in all the glory that is Led Zeppelin. Never before have they been captured on Video like this. It is such a complete DVD that really I ask for nothing more I am complete with owning this DVD.If you ever were intrested in this Great band of era's past, you can't miss this DVD. It's a Must own for anyone who ever loved or love's rock and roll. Now if only Pink Floyd could just get something like this out!
B00006AFUR|5.0|This CD/Band just plain old rocks. Every track offers something new and equally incredible. Loved every minute of it. 'nuff said.
B000002HEP|5.0|Simply put, this is one of the sickest albums of the 90's. get it.
B00008LDPU|4.0|I really enjoyed this dvd, each little short was enjoyable by itself, Where it fails a bit is when some of the pieces try to fit together. They story gets somewhat convoluted, and is hard to follow, still quite enjoyable. Worthy of adding to anyone's collection who likes this kind of DVD.
0375823360|5.0|I got the first book for my birthday, because i'm a total bookworm and everybody knows it. I finished the book and went to the library the next day and got both the second and the third. The series just blew me away. <br />It wasn't the average fantasy-elves, magicians, unicorns, etc. It was so original and had everything you wanted. Clear pictures, totally enough action, original story line, wonderful characters, suspense, just everything.<br />It starts out with Lyra, an orphan at Jordan College, and the first book is about her adventure into the north, finding out she has parents and who they are, discovering new worlds, and new people(or bears). In the second book she meets Will, running away into the new world, trying to save his mothers most precious possession. He recieves the subtle knife (in exchange for a couple of fingers) which lets him cut into any of the millions of worlds that exist. The third book is the best of all, and takes them through lots of worlds, including the world of the dead, and then thier parting back into thier own worlds.<br />These books, just thinking about them gets my mind racing with the  fabulous adventures these two have, and all the wonderful things happening that make you want to laugh with relief as they get out of one prediciment, and then cry as they hit another. You can read them over and over again, and always discover something you missed the time before. I've read hundreds of books, and these are definitly in the top 5. If you like fiction, get these books. I guarantee 'em.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I did NOT like this CD when I first listened to it. But decided to give it another shot, and have to say that it is Madonna's most interesting and introspective work to date.<br />Madonna has grown up and it's showing in her work. She also has the confidence to go out on a limb, which she has done on American Life.  Hats off to Madonna for producing one of the BEST albums I've heard in a long time.
0140177396|4.0|George and Lenny are two men traveling while striving to support themselves and make a home together. The message that I gathered was that high hopes and dreams for a better future could make a miserable today more tolerable. The main characters are George and Lenny. They are best friends and watch over each other as they travel together. Lenny is unable to take care of himself because of his mental disabilities. George sees him for who he is and is his true friend regardless of the negative things Lenny does. Lenny is an extremely large man and does not understand his strength and the harm he is capable of causing. This leads him to the conflicts that occurred between Curley and his wife. This is the one thing that Lenny did that could not go unpunished for. It is George that did the right thing for his friend Lenny in the end.<BR>I can really relate to this story from a personal experience of my own. My good friend from my childhood always had so much going for him. I don't think he even realized all that he was worth and capable of. Based on his actions it was plainly obvious that he did not see this. He started using drugs, then selling drugs, and then the last straw was when he put himself in the hospital by overdosing. His parents were blinded by what a good kid he was; they didn't understand what was happening. I knew he would be upset with me for telling on him, but it was the most loving thing I could do to save him from his destructive path. He is now clean and sober and has numerously thanked me for caring enough to bring the problem to the surface. So, like George, I looked past what I didn't want to do and did what was best for my friend.<BR> I really enjoyed reading this book because Steinbeck was so descriptive with his choice of words in this novel. I could actually picture each event in the story like I was watching a movie, but better. I love books like this because they are the ones that I can't put down, which makes reading so enjoyable. My favorite parts of the book are every time George and Lenny talk about their dream of having their own farm with the rabbits. It seemed like such a beautiful dream. It made me wish that I had a farm of my own. I didn't like how the novel ended with George and Lenny because they were so close and I hoped that they would remain friends forever. I wouldn't change anything about this book because it was written by a great author and is a classic, even today. It ended just the way it was meant to because any other way would not have given the same message about friendship.<BR> I think that everyone should read this book at least once in their life because it is an excellent work of literature. It is full of excitement and adventure that would keep anyone's mind occupied and entertained. This novel is not really directed to a certain type of person. Each character is different and unique. I would definitely recommend this book to everyone.
6301697707|5.0|What's not to like? This is a perfect 1950s/early 60s monster movie set in the 90s. Reba McIntyre and Martin Gross are awseome as the survivalist couple fighting off the graboids in their rec room. Bacon and Ward are perfectly cast as two ne-er do well cowboy types confronted by lethal creatures who learn and improve as they go along. The balance between humor, tension and action is perfect. <br />I'd rate it even superior to giants ants and triffids!
B0000028P8|5.0|She sounds live just as good as in the studio. Thsi EP from the legendary MTV show is made after her second album.<br />EMOTIONS: I love the song with the high notes but I prefer the studio version because the backgound sounds better with synthesizer.<br />IF IT'S OVER: She wrote this song with Carole King. It'S a typical &quot;Diva-Ballad&quot;.<br />SOMEDAY: Great Popsong with Gospel influences.<br />VISION OF LOVE: To perform this song live and unplugged might not be easy at all. But it aounds good here.<br />MAKE IT HAPPEN: On the studio album this song sounds too dry. It should have been released only as a live song. I like this version but I precfer the version on the Divas live album.<br />I'LL BE THERE: With Trey Lorentz who is her Backgroundsinger. It'S the only song wich is new on the album.<br />CAN'T LET GO: This is one of my favourite songs by her. I prefer the studio version but it sounds good here as well.

The picture quality is superb.  The sound quality is outstanding.  I listened to the dolby digital track last night and I felt like i was there.  I just can't believe they are selling this so cheap!  Just buy it. :)
B00005YTFG|4.0|I thought this was and excellent movie! I suggest that you watch it with a friend & not alone. My friends & I cried & cried. As my friend said \\"Its so beautiful yet so horrible\\" Horrible meaning a sad ending. I also never knew that Nicole Kidman could sing & she sang pretty well. Ewan McGregor is ver hot in this movie. I thought parts of it were funny too. Like the begining when the man falls through the ceiling & when The Duke & Harold sing Like A Virgin. All in all this is a pretty good movie
B00005JLRT|5.0|I like this movie because the visual effects are incredible,the plot keeps you on the edge of your seatand the rich musical score adds a nice touch.A Romulan senator kills the head of the Romulan Senate.Its new leader is from Romulus'twin planet,Remus>What's more Shinzon is a clone of Picard!He claims to want peace-but does he?On a desert planet,a prototype of Data is found.Data's interaction with him is great.At the end of the movie,one character gives his life that the rest of the crew might live,Who is it?To find out,order this DVD!!
B00005R87Q|4.0|\\"FATF\\" is not a movie I would have expected to see. When it came out I blew it off as just another lowbrow chase film with \\"some big dumb muscle guy\\" in the lead. Who needs another stone like Schwarzenegger or Stallone or Jean Claude I-Can't-Act-Worth-a-Van-Damme on the screen?<br />Then I discovered that Vin Diesel has a brain (and a pretty good one at that) and had to see this film. Shortly afterward, I retracted my previous blind criticism. Yes, this is a pretty standard plot (enigmatic criminal, undercover cop sent to destroy him grows to love him and wants to date his sister) but I looked beyond that to content and there is some good stuff here. The chief asset is undeniably Vin. Dom is such a difficult role because he has to be tough, enigmatic, charming, dangerous, and yet vulnerable, and Vin pulls off all of these tasks admirably. Watch the scene where Dom confesses to Brian that he caused irreparable brain damage to the guy he blames for his father's death. There's genuine shame and pain in Vin and he got to me. Bravo!<br />The action is topnotch, the car races and techno-tricks amazing, and everyone gives a decent performance, although if Paul Walker was anymore vanilla I'd have made him sit in an ice cream cone. But forget your logical, orderly, grown-up brain and just watch this movie. You're seeing a superstar named Vin Diesel start to take over the world and believe me, you don't want to miss him.
0783235380|4.0|I gave this a 4 because of the BAD ending! I was really enjoying it &amp; then he just goes &amp; picks the wrong girl! I thought it was kind of wierd that his girl friend or whatever would just forgive him like that. I really enjoyed the other parts though. It was funny too. Those poor people pretty much everything that could happen to them did! But all in all i would only rent this movie

B00005JLSE|5.0|Chicago is my faveorite movie! I've seen it 4 times & I can't wait for the DVD! The DVD special features sound cool, Deleted scene interviews, trailers what could be better. I hope they have the song that Catherine Zeta Jones sang but they had to tak out of the movie. I hear a part of it & it was a wonderful song. The cast was awesome, I had never really like Richard Gere but now I really do. I was never a BIG Catherine Zeta Jones fan either but now i am. I had barely even heard of Renne Zellweger & now i like her. I think this movie is MUCH better than Moulin Rouge no matter what anyone says. The storyline in Chicago is just plain better. I really never enjoyed musicals like Annie or Sound Of Music becaus I thought it was so wierd that when they were just walking down the street they would just burst into song. In Chicago most of the Songs are dreams or they have a real reason to be sung. Like ALL THAT JAZZ, Velma just doesnt burst into song for no reason she os preforming. I cannot express in word how much i ADORE this movie. Every one should see it plain & simple
B00008PX8P|5.0|This DVD is worth it just for the first track! I have never heard \\"We're Gonna Groove\\", Live. The intensity of the band is 3X the intensity of any audio I have heard. So far I have only seen 3 tracks, but it was magnificent. I started listening to the Grateful Dead for the last 10 years and they are great but this Zeppelin DVD your socks off. This DVD reminds me why I got \\"The Hermit\\" from the 4th album and the 4 symbols tatooed on my arm!!! Because Zeppelin rules all!
0553106635|5.0|This book (and the books preceding it) are simply the best series I have ever read... and I've been reading fantasy since I was four. I can't really tell anything about the books, because part of the ultimate fun of reading these books is that you have absolutely no idea what is going to happen. The only thing that Martin does that is kind of annoying and disappointing is to kill off someone who's been around since the first chapter of the first book. This does add to the realism, though, but when your favorite character gets killed...<BR>Advice: If you buy or read the books in hardcover, DO NOT look at the inside front cover where it tells about the book. It gives some things away. Start with the first book, A Game of Thrones, or you'll be completely lost. And, budget several sleepless nights to read these.<BR>Happy reading.
B00005JKZT|5.0|...in the movie industry. Lord of the Rings has amazed audiences and critics everywhere. I, as a loyal devotee of the books, was not the least bit disappointed with the material left out in the Fellowhsip of the Ring, and am not disappointed in the Two Towers. TTT is one of the greatest achievments in movie history, with both great special effects, great actors, and one of the greatest books ever written adapted into a great movie.<br />I am not going to write the plot of the movie as you have to go see it for yourself, but I will write that what most impressed me in this movie was not Gollum or the Battle of Helm's Deep (both of which were EXCELLENT), but the actors. Most every performance was believable and the characters were excellently portrayed.<br />In short, I give this movie a well-deserved 5 stars. <br />\\"A new power is rising! Its victory is at hand!\\"
B000003TAW|5.0|To hear people say so good about the CD makes me feel like some people who listen to decent music are still alive in this world. This CD is the CD above al my CDs, and the lyrics are the kind that are in your head all the time, yet you never tire of. &quot;my name is jonas&quot; is just a reallu good classic Weezer song and &quot;no one else&quot;, though at first glance may seem chauvinistic, is in fact very catchy and one of my favorites. In &quot;The World Has Turned and Left Me Here&quot; the mood changes but the quality doesn't. It's sad, but very pretty and identifiable, and easy to understand. &quot;Buddy Holly&quot; is a fun song which is also very catchy and i think is about prom rejection. &quot;The Sweater Song&quot; is the first Weezer song I ever heard and its repeated chorus and the harmony is very good, and I enjoy the dialogue. &quot;Say It Ain't So&quot; is one of the more serious ones, and it's really sad but has a really great rhythm to it and you can't help but love it.  &quot;holiday&quot; i recognize as being about heaven, and it's a real lighthearted yet serious song that is just beautiful and is my favorite. There is so much more i could write but to sum it up: weezer is awesome! this is the best of their CDs, if you like this style.
B00008J4P5|5.0|my best friend staci lent this cd to me a couple of months ago. i must say, as soon as i heard the first song, i was completely hooked. <br />now for those of you who really believe that jack and meg are brother and sister, it's not true. their marriage liscences were found online, and if you've ever seen them live, they have this sexual chemistry together like none i've ever seen. you can bet a brother and sister wouldn't act like that, oh no!<br />this album shines from every single track. not one is a filler, and it serves each of its purpose on the album. my favorite is meg's sexy vocal \\"in the cold, cold night\\", jack's beautiful acoustic \\"you've got her in your pocket\\", and of course the silly closing track \\"well it's true that we love one another\\". <br />meg's drum beats with jack's killer guitar adds up to equal one hell of a band. with that said, go buy this cd and grab some tickets for their upcoming US tour. it's seriously not to be missed, folks. enjoy. :)
B00006SFLV|5.0|\\"My So-Called Life\\" is not good television; it's extraordinary television-making.  It is what TV shows could be if people took the time to create them instead of worry about how much money will be made.<BR>     I fell in love with \\"My So-Called Life\\" when it was rerun on MTV awhile back, just like everyone else.  After purchasing the DVD set and rewatching the episodes, I've fallen in love all over again.  How can any show be this good?  It's not just the extraordinarily witty and insightful writing, not just the excellent acting, the complex characters, its...everything.  <BR>     MSCL is real; it's the antithesis to shows like Dawson's Creek.  Its characters are real.  They're flawed, but in believable ways.  It's a very complex, nuanced, and subtle show.  What's great about this show is that none of the characters are given the \\"short end of the stick\\".  Each character unforgetable and multilayered.  Angela Chase herself is one of the most complex characters ever created for television.  There's just so much to her that you can't believe someone made her up.  Such a shame that we didn't get to know her better before the show was cancelled.  My favourite character though is Brian Krakow, the first TV character I could identify with.  Brian's a sort of tragic anti-hero nerd.  Characters like this have appeared in other shows, but usually as comic relief.  MSCL has sympathy for Brian and gives him a voice, yet does not overlook his many faults.  There's just so much psychology, philosophy, so much depth and genius in MSCL.  <BR>     I honestly do not believe there's a bad episode in the entire show (albeit there were only 19 episodes ever made).  The Halloween episode comes close, but it was worth it just to see Danielle dressed up as Angela and all the unconscious tension it implied.  In general I thoroughly enjoyed watching ever second of every episode.  I'm stunned with awe after every episode.  This show is for anyone who's ever been a teenager in the 90's.  Itcaptures perfectly the defining aspect of our generation.<BR>     I had the pleasure of personally meeting and Winnie Holzmann, creator and writer of MSCL when she visited UC Berkeley recently (yes, I'm a bear.  Cal pride!).  I got the opportunty to thank her for creating the show.  I think the consensus of the audience that we had our mouths open salivating for more when the show was killed off.  But Winnie said it best \\"It was tragic that the show was cancelled after only one season, but in a way I'm happy with the way it worked out.  With only 19 episodes, there's kind of a preciousness to it that's preserved forever, instead of what would have happened, had we continued the show to the point where everyone was tired of the show and no one could come up with any new ideas\\".  Indeed, there is tremendous preciousness to the show.<BR>     One last thing:  Claire Danes is so HOT!!!  How can Brian not be in love with her?  Anyone else notice how her eyebrows curve upwards in the middle like this: ^ ?
B00006BTCA|5.0|my best friend staci recently lent me this cd. once i popped it into my cd player, i was taken by complete surprise.<br />from the beauty of &quot;untitled&quot;, to &quot;leif erikson&quot;, i was left only in a trance-like mode. i don't know what this album does to me, but it certainly has its odd effects. it has a dreamy, melodic quality to it, that just sends you to somewhere else. my only suggestion to you, is to put yourself alone in a darkened room, and blast this cd. just let your imagination do the rest.<br />give it a try. you might just like what you find.
B000002UAO|4.0|I liken this to the moment in the Wizard of Oz, when Dorothy leaves black-and-white Kansas for the intense, surreal colours of Oz.  The Beatles had always been a cut above the crowd, but with this album they jumped to a whole new level.  And the most amazing thing about it all was that this album was a rush job.  They were still trying to meet their quota of two albums a year, and with recording only beginning in the fall of 1965, they had a lot of work to do to make their late November deadline.  But unlike BEATLES FOR SALE issued a year earlier, under similar pressures, the band rose to the occasion with a rich, lusterous album containing very little filler.   The deliciously tongue-in-cheek \\"Drive My Car\\" starts everything off in great style -- and features some interesting guitar work by George Harrison. George is even more prominent on the next track, introducing sitar to the world of pop in John's \\"Norwegian Wood\\".   And he comes up with his own best composition so far.  \\"If I Needed Someone\\" features some terrific harmonies and a jangly guitar sound that George borrowed from the Byrds -- which is fair, since his 12-string guitar from A HARD DAY'S NIGHT had been such a huge influence on the California band's leader, Roger \\"Jim\\" McGuinn.  \\"Think For Yourself\\" was also a strong George track, bolstered by Paul's hefty fuzz bass playing. John Lennon's transition to a more confessional style of composing was strongly in evidence on this album.  In addition to \\"Norwegian Wood\\", which was his story of an actual affair he'd had, Lennon's \\"In My Life\\" was a touching trip down memory lane, bolstered by a charming baroque-style piano bridge from George Martin.  \\"Nowhere Man\\" is another great song, made even greater by George's lustrous guitar solo (I love the \\"ping\\" at the end of it).  And \\"Girl\\" adds an eastern European flavour to a rather moving, and somewhat disturbing, love song from John.  Lennon's voice is also in fine form on this album -- demonstrating he was more than just a rocker, with some of the most moving vocals of his Beatles career.  Not surprisingly, Paul McCartney had the biggest hit on RUBBER SOUL with \\"Michelle\\", but I've never much cared for it, considering it \\"just another pop song\\". I much prefer \\"You Won't See Me\\" and \\"I'm Looking Through You\\".  The latter is the only Beatle song I can think of where I prefer the American mix (from the old vinyl LP) with its false start, to the British version included on this CD.  The two \\"W\\" songs on the album -- \\"Wait\\" and \\"The Word\\" -- are also pretty good, although they're somewhat forgettable.   The only real disposables on RUBBER SOUL were the songs which started and ended Side Two on the original album.   \\"What Goes On\\" is pretty thin, and \\"Run For Your Life\\" is downright nasty.    Too bad such a fine album ended on such a down note.  It might have been better to close RUBBER SOUL with \\"If I Needed Someone\\".  But still, a very very good album, showing the Beatles growing maturity.  They say this was a drug album -- for me, it's just a very enjoyable album.

B00008OWZC|5.0|No one who truly appeciates Led Zeppelin, or live rock and roll for that matter, would ever say, as one reviewer in this section does, that Led Zeppelin was &quot;a better studio band&quot; than live band. From 1968-1973 Zeppelin was the last word in live rock and roll and many of thier performanses from that era, particularly 1969 (my appologies to those who haven't heard them), have never been equaled. While &quot;How The West Was Won&quot; may not be one of thier few very best performanses, it is an exteremely good one, and an exellent example of the kind of inspired, free weeling improvisation that is the essence of good live music. The &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; medley, singled out for criticism by the aforementioned reviewer, is arguably the best example on this CD of what I'm talking about. Far from &quot;getting lost in it self,&quot; the medley demonstrates the stylistic breadth and whimsical unselfconsciousness that are the hallmarks of Zeppelin live. For the audience it was clearly the emotional climax of the concert. How many of today's rock groups would have the nerve to play &quot;Hello Mary Lou&quot; and the talent to make it sound great? People who are disappointed that Led Zeppelin's live shows are not note for note reprodutions of their studio work, or studies in technical perfection are missing the point and shuold stick to the 9 studio albums. Those who love the excitement of a band plying on the edge of their ability, always searching for that special musical moment, will really love this CD.
0553296981|4.0|This book has inspired me to be a great writer like Anne.  I would want to compose a diary and talk about my life and important events that will happen as I grow older.  I also have a diary of my own.  It is really sad that Anne died and even before her death she experienced poverty.<br />  I feel very bad for Anne because she doen't have much.  I wish I could help her and I am very thankful that I am not like Anne. Even though she is very poor and helpless, she has the courage to write about her struggles and let the whole world read what she has gone through. If I was Anne, I wouldn't have the courage to write about my struggles.  I really respect her for that.<br />  Anne Frank is a strong individual with a big heart.  I wish i could have a friend like Anne or even get that chance to meet her before she died.  I will never forget her ambitious attitude and strive to be a better person.

B00000JGHM|4.0|Fully a misunderstood plot by many, and stated as overlong, it was all of the combinations of dramatic interventions and conversations with the husk of a charged crime thriller. Imagine how real life cops/crooks wouild go through this adventure \\"real time\\". With sequences, like the little girl that Pacino fathers who nearly killed herself, or the torn tendencies of De Niro finding an outside interest that heeds no guns or \\"hot info\\" and is ashamed of his profession, is interesting. The cast, Pacino and DeNiro are the cake, as well as well-focused-on-the-job Val Kilmer as Chris, Judd as the hurt yet still clinging-to-hope wife, and a strong support of minor roles as well.<br />The gunbattle was so brutal, and surreal, and even though I don't promote gun violence at this level anything \\"good\\" for life as we know it, it was still a fact of what could happen. The gunpower and gunplay was much more real than most capers out there.<br />Way to go Mann....way to go.
B000067JG3|5.0|This musical was absolutely fantastic! Julie Andrews did the best acting job in her career closely conflicting with mary Poppins. Christopher Plummer did not get a very good chance at acting since we didn't see him happy most of the time. The children were great.

They nearly destroyed us, now its time for us to retalliate, if only we had a commander...<br />I am not an avid reader yet i loved reading Card's work. It snatches you and does not want to let go!<br />Ender's Game is a thrill ride, loaded with action, action, and more action!! Not to mention amazing plot twists... This book is great for anyone, though i would caution parents in letting young children read it, due to the sparse crude language and intense fight scenes. <br />Ender's Game flys by, it is a quick read and not necessarily a small book. Once you pick it up, you won't be able to put it down, i'm already planning on reading all of the books remaining in the series, i can't wait to get started.
0783225857|5.0|In a twist of time and fate I was viewing 'To Kill A Mockingbird' on DVD when AFI released their choice of Gregory Peck's portrayal of Lee Harper's character Atticus Finch, the Southern lawyer who defends a black man unjustly accused of rape, as Hollywood's all-time movie hero.  No character in film history has more deserved to be designated as the best 'good guy'. Peck garnered a well-deserved Oscar for his role as a man of understated wisdom and quiet courage and the quintessential father-figure all men should aspire to be and all children long for in their lives.  The fact that this film, it's participants, and the basic story are still being honored after 40+ years is a testament to the solid message if offered and the effective manner in which it was presented.<br />I read this Pulitzer Prize novel when it was published and saw the film upon its theatrical release.  The memory of both have long lingered.  Enough can't be said about the wisdom of Universal's decision to release this Collector's Edition DVD. The public owes them a monumental 'thank-you'. Interviews with Gregory Peck and commentary by director Robert Mulligan and producer Alan J. Pakula make us privy to their precious memories surrounding how the charming novel was transformed into the perfect film.  Seeing Mary Badham (Scout) and Philip Alford (Jem) (non-professional southern children starring in an Oscar-nominated film) as adults offering insights into their unique experiences was an unbelievable treat.  To watch Robert Duvall make his screen debut as 'Boo Radley', and what a debut that was; and to hear his comments nearly a half-century later proves as never before the value of the DVD format and special features.<br />Watching this film upon its release it was inconceivable that we could one day far in the future hear and see the inside story of its making in the comfort of our homes and from the mouths of the individuals so instrumental in the process of creating a legend.<br />This DVD is priceless. The details of the making of this time-honored film have now been documented forever in a piece of movie-history that deserves to be savored by any true movie-buff as well as by a generation not yet born at the time of it's release.  The message and the method of communicating it are timeless and dear.  Please do yourself the honor of viewing this film.priceless.

B00005B36H|4.0|I would like to clear up and set straight a few things that have been previously said about this album.  First off, Lateralus is no doubt an extremely artful piece, and a a truly enjoyable listening experience.  But, despite the opinions of other...it is definately not the bands greatest album.  Lateralus in my opinion is a culmintation of all of tools previous albums.  The cd features much ambience and musical talent, along with great lyrics.  The CD however, is nothing compared to Aenima...the bands definative masterpiece, and a mainstay of the genre.  Aenima featured some of the most mind blowing lyrics I have ever heard, songs that made me cry at times.  Lateralus may have more intricate instrumentals, hence making it better to listen to at first...But the lyrics from Aenima will never be surpased.  Aenima is without a doubt MJK masterpiece in every way.  Not only are the lyrics inspired and meaningfull, but he sings them out from the bottom of his deep heart.  The purpose of this review is as follows:  As a new listener to tool you may be pursuaded to by Lateralus because it is musically apealing to the first listenings.  However, I asure you that you will be more pleased with Aenima...It is some of the most honest and powerfull music you will ever hear.  This CD gave meaning to my life at times when I was in deeper dispare than is even imaginable by most.  My advice is to buy Aenima first, to get a better, more copmrehensive understanding of the band TOOL as a whole.  Then go and buy lateralus and not only will you see the obvious aural beauty...but you will understand the true art and purpose of TOOL.  You will be forever touched and changed by the music if you open up to its message.
B00000HYXB|5.0|I am mostly listening to black metal and death metal but a friend let me borrow this, pretty much the first thing i started realizing is- \\"this is where Borknagar came from\\"- this style of power metal turned into melodic black metal, and comparing this to newer metal like arch enemy. The guitars on this CD are just as amazing as michael ammot's. This is definitely gonna get me into more of this older power metal.
B00008H2LB|5.0|This cd blew me away. All of the songs are nothing less than incredible. Buy it and you'll see what I'm talking about. Can't wait for their next. 5 out of 5 stars.
0452284392|2.0|I am a computer engineer.  I know this is a general audience pop-sci book, but it was too watered down.  I would have been better off reading a short research paper on the subject.<br />All the author seemed to write about was his jet-hopping and his good ol' boys club of researchers.  I'm surprised he didn't advertise Albert TV: the webcam--see me at my desk, writing my next book...about...myself!<br />Much of the scientific writing was repetitive--as if he were trying to fulfill a publisher's page quota.  Maybe I've just been exposed to the topic before, but most of the concepts seemed to be common sense.  If you remove the hub in a star network, it will go down.  REALLY!?!  I smell Nobel and Pulitzer!<br />In summary, a grand display of hubris, speckeled with a few easily-digestible facts amid a sea of repetition.
B000000WA4|2.0|I'll be the first to call Billy a genius, and the sheer wistful beauty of Siamese Dream will always haunt me, but this bloated opus is just a bit much. Let me break it down for you:<br />There are only 5 awesome, essential songs on here: Tonight, Tonight -- Zero -- BWBW -- 33 -- 1979.<br />There are several &quot;second string&quot; songs throughout that are noteworthy, the first three being standouts among them: Here is no why -- Where boys fear to tread -- Thru the eyes of ruby -- MCIS -- Porcelina -- Take Me Down -- X.Y.U.<br />These next ones are barely marginal in quality, but have the tiniest amount of value: Jellybelly -- F.U. (an ode to no one) -- love -- galapagos -- muzzle -- beautiful -- by starlight.<br />All of the other tracks on these two discs are complete garbage, and Billy should be ashamed: To forgive -- cupid de locke -- bodies -- in the arms of sleep -- tales of a scorched earth -- stumbleine -- we only come out at night -- lily -- farewell and goodnight.<br />...and so that's it. I would never dream of getting rid of Siamese Dream or Gish, but I sold this one on in an on-line auction long ago, so I could get their 1999 greatest hits promo-only CD, which has the &quot;essential&quot; songs on MCIS, plus &quot;Landslide&quot; and &quot;Drown&quot; and &quot;Mayonaisse (acoustic)&quot;. Sure, these days you can get this thing for less money than a Happy Meal, but unless you are truly a Billy Phreak, don't bother ...
B000069AUI|1.0|This CD is worth neither your time or your money. All of the songs are slow, pessimistic, and make you want to commit suicide all of a sudden. Buy John Mayer in Room for Squares or something by Jason Mraz. Just don't buy this CD.
1573301183|5.0|It's great to see a band like Alice In Chains toned down for an Unplugged set. The only thing I would have added to make it better was if they would have played Rotten Apple, that song was amazing. But what's even more amazing is watching the emotion Layne Staley is putting into Sludge Factory (once he remembers the lyrics) and Frogs. Now all I'm waiting for is the Nirvana show to be released so I can actually compare the complete shows.
B00000JZIK|4.0|good story. wonderful actors.  very interesting film.
B000002B2X|4.0|Make no word about it, this is a very good disc. Extremely short, but still a good disc. However, the only songs that really ever appealed to me on it were Brother and Got Me Wrong, Am I Inside and Right Turn both sound rather similar to each other.
6305076995|5.0|This set here captures Yes in fine form, as they were performing songs to support their 1972 release _Close To The Edge_. As many reviewers have stated, the sound quality is quite faint, which can be inexcusable to many viewers, but the performances are top-notch, and on the whole, is worthwhile for the Yes fan.<br />The six performances on here are for: &quot;Your Move/I've Seen All Good People,&quot; &quot;The Clap,&quot; &quot;And You And I,&quot; &quot;Close To The Edge,&quot; &quot;Jingle Bells/Hallelujah/Roundabout&quot; and &quot;Yours Is No Disgrace&quot; as an encore.<br />&quot;Your Move..&quot; is quite a nice performance as vocalist Jon Anderson is using his ethereal upper-register, and Steve Howe is playing mind-blowing material on his guitar (though in the first half, he plays what looks like a mandolin.) The vocal harmonies exchanged by Jon Anderson, bassist Chris Squire and Steve are nice as well. I also liked watching keyboardist Rick Wakeman clapping his hands during the handclapping section. &quot;The Clap&quot; is an extraordinary workout by Steve Howe. It was nice watching the close-ups on the fretboard, and watching Steve's amazing technique and virtuosity.<br />Elsewhere, hearing and seeing this live performance of &quot;Close To The Edge&quot; was quite refreshing, and sits quite nicely with the studio version. The opening was melodic and mesmerizing, although there were some parts in the beginning where you couldn't see the bandmembers, due to some of the art collages. This may annoy some viewers as this appears in other places during the performance, particularly during the third movement, &quot;I Get Up, I Get Down.&quot; It was almost like magic witnessing Rick Wakeman, wearing his glowing silver cape, playing that soaring synthesizer lead before the crashing rhythm section jumps in to close out that third movement.<br />And, for more Rick Wakeman, he continues his magic on the &quot;Jingle Bells/Hallelujah/Roundabout&quot; medley. The first two parts feature Rick on the keyboards alone. First, he starts with a fairly reverent version of &quot;Jingle Bells,&quot; then all of a sudden, it turns into a funked-up, bluesy piece, with the audience members clapping along. Then comes his interpretation of &quot;Hallelujah,&quot; which was magnificently done, as he plays a synthesizer with his left hand, and what I think is a mellotron with his right hand simultaneously. It's unbelievable how he could get orchestral/choiral effects out of his instrument. But, of course, that may as well have been the technology at the time. But, in any event, it was nice to watch what many non-prog rock fans would simply call silliness and indulgence. And to end it all, there's an energetic version of &quot;Roundabout.&quot; The encore was lots of fun as well, which was the fiery live version of &quot;Yours Is No Disgrace.&quot;<br />To end this horribly written review, I'll just say that this should be owned by Yes fans, especially for fans who wish they could have seen the band play live in their 1970s period. Despite the slightly lacking sound quality, this still shouldn't be ignored, as the performances are excellent.first two parts feature Rick on the keyboards alone.

B00006LLNU|3.0|Not sure its entirely their fault though.  When I saw Sigur Ros live in Seattle prior the this albums release, they performed stunning versions of Pop Song, Death Song, and Njosnavelin. I ended up downloading multiple bootlegs of these and a few other songs on this album from various shows (Montreux Jazz Festival being the best).  So after listening to live versions of 5 of the 8 songs for 6 months prior to the albums release, I had high expectations. The album versions must be better than the live recordings, right?  Not necessarily.  The songs are still great but it just seems like the album has bad mixes/recordings. Something intangible seems to be missing. Anyway, great songs, they just weren't able to capture great recordings. I'm hoping for ( ) redux.

B00008LDPU|5.0|In a word: Stunning!<BR>Simply amazing and beautiful artwork throughout.  Haunting, intriguing and fanciful stories broaden the Matrix universe.  Including a two-part &quot;prequel&quot; relating the story of the machines early clashes with their human masters.  The near-realistic looking Final Flight of the Osiris (from the folks behind Final Fantasy) is a thrilling piece of eye candy.  Matriculated is an unexpected treat, exploring a kind of Anti-Matrix, where a machine's mind is plugged into human brains.  Perhaps my favorite segment, Program, from director Yoshiaki Kawajiri, treats the viewer to an unforgettable medieval samurai battle sequence.  Animatrix delivers.

Well, half a page into the book I was hooked, and I couldn't concentrate on anything in &quot;real life&quot; until I finished it. What a mindblowingly suspenseful book. The characters were well-developed, the writing was skillfully done, and and the romance was believable and heartbreaking (no sappiness here).<br />Now I am the one pestering friends to read this amazing book.

B00008H2LB|2.0|I hate to jump on the bandwagon but I can't help myself.  Linkin Park is simply not a very good band.  I heard this album when my friend who swears up and down by these guys asked me to give it a listen.  Never one to be closed minded, I thought what the heck, it can't be that bad.  Well I was wrong, it was horrible.  Every song sounds the same and though I haven't listened to Hybrid Theory, it sounds like all the singles i've heard on the radio. <br />They basically have three elements, whining vocals over a monotone rap, the same distortion filled guitar riffs they have always had and buried scratching to fill spaces.  Lyrically it's the same pre-packaged rage every other nu-metal band has been spouting out for 5 years.  <br />... Two stars for being 38 minutes, at least they aren't pretentious enough to make a 75 minute album.

B000000H57|5.0|When i think of type o negative i usually think of their slow gothic metal sound that no one else seems to have. October Rust really stands out from all other type o cd's. FOr one, the material on this cd is what i would normally think of as type o negative's music,it's slow, hard, and gothic. I think that if your intrested in buying any of type o negative's music then this is the cd that really shows what type o's music is, or at leat what it should stay as. The whole idea of Type O making faster and somewhat harder music, which they have done, just dosent work out. This cd truly stands out as what Type O Negative's music is, or should be. Type O Negative has a certain sound in their music that no one else can ever have. Me and most other fans aggree that Type o Negative's music really ... when they try to make it fast or anything different then their type of music which is shown in this cd. thats pretty much why suggest that you buy this cd.

If you owe allegiance to any of metal's many diverse subgenres, this should be the first album in your collection.<BR>James Hetfield croons, howls, and snarls as he and Kirk Hammett deliver a mindblowing double guitar attack.  Lars Ulrich's drumming is controlled, consistent, and insanely fast.  The late Cliff Burton delivers a complex and legendary performance on bass.<BR>The efforts of all four combine to present fans with thrash metal that is pounding, angry, opinionated, and truly epic, from the haunting acoustic opening of &quot;Battery&quot; to the blistering closing track, &quot;Damage Inc.&quot;<BR>If you do not own this album, you cannot call yourself a fan of metal.
B00000GUZP|5.0|Man!!! Where do i begin? First off..i had always been curious about Debbies solo effort and was unable to find it for a long time. About 10 years or so ago..i found it on cassette and hated it, expecting as many others did that it was a total departure from her Blondie work. I chucked it and never looked back, until..... I rediscovered it again 6 years later..on CD even! I bought it and played it and discovered a newer appreciation for it..still not thoroughly impressesed. I put it away and didn't take it out again for the next 3 years...But lo and behold!!! I have brought it out of hibernation just last year and played it all the way through and was blown away!!! I have driven my neighbors and coworkers insane with my repeated playing of this ingenious disc!!! I was floored, almost insane in my newfound faith of the one and only Debbie Harry!!! Almost every song is a standout..mainly, \\"The Jam Was Moving\\", \\"Surrender\\", \\"Under Arrest\\", the ethereal \\"Chrome\\" and \\"Oasis\\"..plus everything in between. Excellent production, great vocals, totally experimental and the better for it. The merging of styles amazingly work and the concepts and always fun lyrics add to the mix..Totally worth buying for the artwork, music, originality, and of course Debbie. If I can be wowed and taken aback years after years of denial..I think anyone who is a true Debbie fan can become a convert...
B00005JLET|5.0|there's no other way to put it.  The animation in this movie is crisp, fluid and clear, no drags or jumpy frames.  Music is beautiful and accents the story further.  Story line and characters are amazing, you really feel for them.  The end leaves you BEGGING for more, not wanting to believe that it's over already!!<br />This story takes you on a fantastic adventure into a world of spirits, magic, dragons, and on a journey with a little girl who's lost, scared, and is trying to save her parents.  You watch as the girl, (Chihiro, or Sen), transforms into a strong character who is willing to overcome her fears and do whatever it takes to save the ones that she loves.  A truly captivating story!!  One you'll want to watch over and over again!!
B00008J4P5|5.0|Ingredients:<BR>1 cup Led Zeppelin<BR>1/2 cup David Bowie<BR>1/4 cup Beatles (heavy on the Lennon)<BR>2 Tbsp. The Who<BR>2 Tbsp. Rolling Stones<BR>1 Tbsp. Spinal Tap (it is so blatantly mocking - and some of the lyrics are ridiculous!)<br />Blend all ingredients, bake well in a white hot oven.  Allow to cool and savor the kick arse sound!<br />I LOVE this album and listen to it and tell friends about it whenever I can!  BUY IT!
B0000070QS|5.0|Morten Harket's \\"Wild Seed\\" showcases this artist's depth of talent and depth of soul. If you have yet to hear any of his work past the \\"Take On Me\\" single, this album is like finding an oasis in the arid desert of pop music. His sweet, sexy, soulful, and soaring vocals are very impressive. He knows when not to overpower a song, instead, allowing it to live and breathe through him. He caresses a song with his voice and holds his listener captive. Just surrender to it. The songs are lyrically outstanding as well. One of the best finds I have in my vast CD collection. Very special, very different and it will stay with you.
B00006CXXU|5.0|It took me awhile to buy this CD, only because of the cover--but I'm so glad i did!! The more I listen to it the more I LOVE it. Her voice is incredible, and unlike a lot of artists out there now she shows real emotion in her voice- another thing which makes her music so amazing. This is one of the few albums I can listen to from start to finish, over and over, and not get sick of. Even the interludes are beautiful, and really add to the charectar of the album, making more than just a collection of songs. I'm not a huge fan of her new \\"image\\" but I appreciate that she is being herself-- her music is mature, and better showcases her talent. A few comments on the songs:<br />1) Stripped Intro- basically this interlude begins with people talking about Christina, and then she sings about what the album is to her- just a chance to show herself to the world. (9/10)<BR>2) Can't Hold Us Down- nice song, positive message about women in the end, fun sound. (9/10)<BR>3) Walk Away- one of my favorite songs on the album, really showcases her voice, emotional, I can relate to this situation.(10/10)<BR>4) Fighter- one of the songs that made me buy this CD in the first place, love it, real song, great lyrics. (10/10)<BR>5) Primer Amor (interlude)- in spanish, basically talks about the story behind the next song, about her first love and how it all started. (9/10)<BR>6) Infatuation- Latin beat, great lyrics, her voice sounds incredible, light mood, not as heavy lyrically as many of the other songs. (10/10)<BR>7)Loves Embrace- another interlude, Christina talking in a soft voice, some singing. (8/10)<BR>8)Loving Me 4 Me- really pretty song, her voice sounds incredible, really soft, think early Mariah Carey, but still Christina's. Great message, about someone who really deserves you, by loving someone for everything they are, really positive. (8/10)<BR>9)Impossible-R&B flavor, produced by Alicia Keys, her voice is really powerful, again singing about relationships and the need for communication. One of my favorites ever since I saw her sing it live. (10/10)<BR>10) Underappreciated- Love song but with a different twist, about giving a lot into a relationship but not getting back the same. Sounds like there is a chorus singing backup, creates a beautiful sound. (8/10)<BR>11) Beautiful- gorgeous song, really positive, about loving yourself no matter what, basically says that everyone is beautiful and it doesn't matter what other people say. Beautiful voice, simple lyrics but powerful message. (10/10)<BR>12) Make Over- really different direction for Christina, sounds a little like Pink's new song. Fun, kind of summery song, about wanting to be herself, not needing to be like everyone else: \\" I don't need anybody to make me over\\" (7/10)<BR>13)Cruz-The beginning is a little a cappella, a beautiful ballad with a great message.\\" I believe in today\\" (9/10)<BR>14)Soar- her voice sounds incredible, I love this song! (10/10)<BR>15)Get Mine, Get Yours- sexy song about casual *relationships*, a little raunchy, but her voice, as usual, sounds incredible, and the song has a great rhythem. (9/10)<BR>16) Dirty- a little overplayed on the radio, it's not my favorite on the album, but it's a good party song. (7/10)<BR>17)Stripped (Part Two)- again speaking about being herself, and not letting other people bring her down. Positive message about individuality in a personal sense. (9/10)<BR>18) The Voice Within- a great song about trusting yourself, another beautiful ballad with an amazing message. (9/10)<BR>19) I'm Ok- sad song, very personal, I'm glad Christina chose to put this song on the album. Although it's a little hard to listen to, in the end its about surviving through difficult situations.(10/10)<BR>20) Keep on Singing My Song-Wonderful end to a great album, great beat, about not letting what other people say hurt you, or let them change you. A little on the long side... (8/10)<br />Overall this album is incredible, every song is different, but all incredibly written and sung. I can honestly say no song on this album is filler, there are 17 amazing songs, even the interludes add to this CD. I'm glad Christina took the time to produce a great album. It was worth the wait!

B00006G8K0|1.0|Yes, this is the first and greatest of the Christopher Lee outings as Dracula.  It's also probably the best Dracula movie ever made.  So why release such a shoddy DVD of this horror masterpiece?  If there's a film that deserves audio commentaries, behind the scenes footage, biographies or even a decent photo gallery, this is the one.  Yet, the producers of this DVD thought so little of this film that a still photograph on the rear cover isn't even from this film.  Affectionados will probably recognize the buxom victim represented as being from the later 'Dracula A.D. 1972'.  If you can't even get something as obvious as that correct, then you shouldn't bother at all.  I'm going to wait until someone who cares releases this film on DVD.
B00008LDPU|4.0|The Animatrix is a great dvd that delves further into the rabitt hole.  The anime shorts are excellent and range around fifteen minutes on avarge theres an hour and twenty nine minuetes of great anime, and an hour and twenty eight minutes of extras (which arent junk extras like as in many dvds).  Each anime short is unique in its own way whether its the writing or animation style. The Anime shorts are:<br />         Final flight of the Osiris-A cool cg anime with a [bucket] load of action. The crew of the Osiris must warn Zion of the onslaught of advancing Sentinels before it's to late. This movie sets you up for the Matrix Reloaded.<br />         The second renaissance part 1-This anime has to do with the beginning of events that would later begin the war between the humans and the machines. <br />         The second renaissance part 2-This anime is about the war between the humans and machines and the creation of the matrix.<br />         Kid's story-Is the story about a teen hacker who by jumping off a building while escaping agents is able to wake him self up and unplug himself from the matrix. He does this because he does not believe what is happening to him is real.(this is about that annoying kid in the matrix reloaded who keeps bothering Neo).<br />         Program-Is about a a female practicing her fighting skills in a medieval Japan setting. When she encounters a fellow rebel something goes horrible wrong. This anime is great and has an even better ending.<br />         World Record-A runner with super fast speed is able to break the rules of the matrix and wake himself. Agents don't like this and silence him by putting him back to sleep rendering him comatosee. But the runner refuses to believe that he cant run and wont be stopped.<br />         Beyond-A women is invited to a haunted house by a group of kids who know its secret. The house is really a glitch in the matrix. There's a part of a highway street in the garden, rain in one part of the house anda hallway which becomes an alley. The women and kids are able to break the rules of the matrix. Agents find out and come to destroy the house and fix the problem.<br />         A Detective story-A detective is hired by the agents to track down trinity.<br />         Matriculated-A group of rebels kidnap a sentinel like robot and plug it into a simulation where it is given a choice to get help form a human to save it's life. The rebels are trying to give robots the \\"choice\\" to become good once more.(this one is very weird and out there I hate this one but at the same time like it).
B00006CXXU|5.0|Alot of people I know have put this album down mainly because of Christina's new image but an album should be based on the music, not the person.<BR>I love this album because I can relate to a few of the songs like &quot;Soar&quot;,&quot;Cruz&quot;, and &quot;Beautiful&quot;.This lyrics are really about things that a girl goes through in her late teens and early twenties,from crushes to relationships to leaving home.It touches on a variety of subjects and each song seems to have it's own feel,with everything from rock to r&amp;b.<br />It's really a must have for any young woman that likes top 40 music.
B00008S2VG|1.0|Every once in a while, I pull out the old Madonna CD's and try to remember that she really knew how to make infectously, groovy dance music.  She needs to do the same.  I can forgive the Dick Tracy Soundtrack. I cannot forgive this.  This CD is so instantly forgettable, you will wonder why people ever thought she was talented.  After really great CD's \\"Like A Prayer\\", \\"Erotica\\", \\"Bedtime Stories\\" and \\"Ray Of Light\\" comes this bloated, self-important dirge.  Ugh.  Forget the lyrics! THe music is monotonus, it hides Madonna's voice and it sags under the sheer weight of the pretension.<br />Maybe the post 9-11 Madonna feels that she has to try to shock us by hurling grenades in a video.  The shocks that Madonna really delivered were the unabashed, hedonistic woman who would talk about sex, flaunt her body and make us dance. We need fun and good dance music.<br />The American Madonna I remember is the girl in black lacy things, writihing on the floor and reminding us that bad girls can be like a virgin and still groove.  Please, Madonna: find yourself again.  Go out to the gay clubs again.  Dance with the men.  Listen to the music and find the new CD that will take America by storm again.
B00005YW4H|4.0|After hearing Norah Jones' two hit singles, \\"Don't Know Why\\" and \\"Come Away With Me\\" I decided to buy this album.<br />At first I was a little disappointed because there were no upbeat songs but this has become one of my favorite albums for that reason.It's one that you can put in your cd player on a rainy day and just relax.Her voice is just so smooth and soothing and the music has a country/blues feel to it.<br />I recommend it to anyone who liked the first two singles or loves easy listening.You'll love this album!
B0000017CA|5.0|This cd is perfection.  There is no other way to describe it.  The lyrics are insightful, moody, twisted and sometimes downright deranged.  The poetry and construction of the lyrics is something that should be framed in a gallery.  All the songs on this cd are fantastic, my favorites are \\"Tranquilized\\", \\"Scream of the Butterfly\\", \\"Jezebel\\", \\"God Machine\\", \\"What Color is Death\\", and \\"Bones of Baby Dolls\\".  Buy this cd now.  NOW.  You will never regret it, one of the soundest investments ever.<br />Sedated and lazy, cold skys full of blue.....
B00005JLRT|4.0|The Star Trek movie franchise oscillates from high adventure to mindless action. This movie is partway between the two. As a small mercy, it hasn't degenerated in the \\"dark sets\\" tendancy of TV science-fiction yet. It is a weird mix of : mindless and pointless action (even pointless sex, which is unusual for a Star Trek movie), pulp fiction, Trekkian clichés, a couple of TNG \\"best of\\", and what I thought were some self-aware parodies of Trekkian clichés (unless the screenwriters are so absolutely braindead that they don't realize they've made enormous absurd clichés as part and parcel of their story, but even then it's still funny, just really sad too). It doesn't know what it wants to be. <br />Of course, there has to be plot holes the size of Quebec (why were the aliens on the planet where they found the android firing on them ? how can they detect positronic signatures this far away ? how did LaForge find the theleron radiation ? how did Shinzon get a ship like this ? these are not fatal plot holes, but need explanation), an archenemy, a new weapon, and stereotypical Romulan treachery. <br />To be fair, there are some great scenes. The first three scenes are hilarious, for this Star Trek fan anyway. The space fight scene is great (and parodies the two-dimensional space combat on Star Trek, once again if they are parodying). The photography is great, especially on the alien planet. And who can forget the flying Data ? Come on, that was just too much fun. <br />Its underlying theme of conditioning not being more influential than genetics is a refreshing one - against so many sappy movies that preach that \\"all you need is love\\" and that nature can be changed by a plot device, this more realistic view is promising. Too bad it is supported by no other sophistication, just action. On par with First Contact - at least its bastardization of the Romulans is not as bad as First Contact's bastardization of the Borg. <br />The director really likes \\"German expressionism\\",as he strenously tells us all through the commentary. Apparently the enemy vessel was made under that style. I have no idea what German expressionism is, and it looks kindof absurd in a science-fiction setting, but well. It's a Star Trek movie, it's not supposed to make sense.
0385503954|2.0|This book is overrated.  The opening sections are so slow that I found myself skimming (something I rarely do).  I only stuck with it because of the numerous positive reviews it has received.  The middle section was more interesting.  The book was fairly predictable, except for the ending, which was annoying.
6304076517|2.0|This movie should be called &quot;Gielgud in Love...&quot; with his own voice.  It's an interesting experiment, and an interesting idea, but it is so narcissistic and indulgent.  Prospero's Books lacks all of the passion of the Tempest, sells it short by falling in love with an admittedly great Shakespearean actor saying all of the lines in a beauitful if somewhat detached way.  Please, save your money and rent it if you must, but preferrably go see a live production!
0446677450|5.0|Robert Kiyosaki writes that Financial Literacy is the key to making and keeping wealth. In school we are taught about IQ. Kiyosaki introduces the concept of Financial IQ. Starting with basic concepts and principles such as, \\"The rich don't work for money\\" and \\"Your home is not an asset\\", Kiyosaki destroys many cultural myths that circulate around the wealthy individuals of today.<br />I have personally given away more copies of this book than any other I have bought or read.  I would highly recommend this book and all the Rich Dad series books for anyone wanting to take hold of their finances and learn what true wealth and financial freedom really mean.<br />Patrick Rodriguez, Life Coach<BR>StepByStepSolutions.com
B00008OWZC|5.0|I have been a fan of Led Zeppelin from the beginning and a guitarist since 1975. I have always wanted to hear more live material from Led Zep other than \\"TSRTS\\". I've heard various bootlegs over the years, but the quality lacked and frankly, the performances were a bit sloppy. THIS recording captures Led Zeppelin during a couple of shows where they were totally ON! The playing is tight, the energy is excellent, and this CD really makes you feels like you were there at the concert. My hat is off to Jimmy Page for producing an EXCELLENT collection of songs. This CD is a real testament to the raw energy, music, and social phenomenon that was Led Zeppelin! This CD is well worth the $$$.<br />On a rhetorical note...why is this band Number 1 on the music charts 30 years later? Listen and find out. The rock bands of today could learn a lesson or two from these guys!
B00005JLEU|5.0|Amazing?  You betcha. Breathtakingly beautiful? Doubly so. Able to be enjoyed by all ages, except the very very young (like age 3)?  Yeah!  I'm 27 years old and I enjoyed it, as have all my friends of varying ages.<BR>You can enjoy Spirited Away on a variety of levels - the animation is so detailed, so expressive. There's also the story which is intriguing and surprising. The characters are, of course, mesmerizing.<BR>I highly recommend it!
B000089RVX|3.0|First and foremost, this band is not an answer for Goth fans.<BR>When you're reading the reviews around mine, realize that &quot;goth&quot; is being used as a BUZZWORD. Clearly nobody knows what goth is, but MTV and such told them it was so the gullible public believed it. Do not buy this album if you are a goth fan, you will be horribly disappointed. The fact is, this kind of music (classical/brooding rock/pop) is selling at this point in time, so Evanescence is following the money trail. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, Linkin Park did the same thing and found success, but I'm just pointing out that their lyrics and music isn't &quot;from the heart.&quot;<br />[Ben] Moody emphasizes... \\"We're not trying to sell an angle, we're just here writing from our heart.\\" (evanescence.com)<br />That kind of cliche abusing makes me sick. Their web site antics go on.<br />Moody remembers... &quot;The second song we ever wrote was this seven-minute, ridiculous Goth anthem called 'Understanding.'<br />&quot;We're definitely a rock band,&quot; says the 20-year-old Lee. &quot;But the twist is that the band's music is epic, dramatic, dark rock.&quot;<br />&quot;As a four-piece, we are able to carry out the intricate harmonies and orchestrations of the memorable material on Fallen.&quot;<br />To all you teenagers looking for a good band to be sad (and therefore cool) about, please avoid these musicians. Their music isn't good enough to establish a reputation for itself, they have to define it on the website. And calling their own work &quot;memorable&quot;? PLEASE. Rage called their music memorable when la Rocha left, but their music accomplished things. Rage's electrified-politicking over nine years was something to be remembered, as was leading a rally and speaking in Philadelphia's city hall in defense of Mumia Abu-Jamal.<BR>Back to Fallen: they've released one album and have become so cocky that they called their ONE album &quot;memorable.&quot; It makes me sick.<br />I gave this band three stars because despite what other criticizers say, I DO believe that Amy Lee's voice is amazing. What they are doing: classical/brooding rock/pop because it sells. So yes, they are in it for the money. But they are doing it well, and that gives them three stars.
B00005JM03|2.0|We hate to admit it, but we love the action-comedy. \\"Bad Boys,\\"  \\"Die Hard,\\" and \\"True Lies\\" can all be called guilty pleasures. Another genre that has come into fashion recently in the heist or caper flick, where a stylish yet motley crew of thieves follow their charismatic leader to bull off what is always \\"One Last Job\\". <br />The charismatic leader of the group is Charlie Croker (Mark Walberg, in a performance that gives a new definition to the term `dry-read'). The rest of this crew are equally as predictable; there's the computer guy who can hack into anything, the demolitions guy, the womanizing wheelman, and the veteran thief and safecracker in it for \\"one last job\\" played by Donald Sutherland. Rounding out the crew is Steve Frezelli (Edward Norton) the only member of the crew that has no discernable talent, which makes him the prime suspect in any double cross.<br />The real story of this movie is the Ed Norton had to do it, because he had signed a multi-film deal with the studio, and the studio was threatening legal action. You can tell because he gives one of the most uninspired performances of his career. Mark Walberg is never believable for a minute as the charismatic leader of his crew. <br />The jokes, which admittedly are funny in a corny way, are too rapid fire for the audience to take the action part seriously, but are not funny enough for this to be a fulfilling comedy. I kind of wish the filmmakers went completely overboard and made a self mocking action movie like \\"The Boondock Saints.\\" But the film always tries to keep one foot in the land of credibility and it just doesn't work because I was never invested in this movie or the characters at all. I wouldn't have cared if at any time during the movie everybody dropped dead.<br />The movie feels like an excuse to get as many mini-coopers into a film as possible. The sound editors made these mini's sound like fire breathing tractor-trailers, not like the hamster wheel engines that Mini's actuallyare equipped with. That said, the stunt driving makes for the most engaging sequences in the movie.  And that's saying something. All in all I can't say that the movie is bad, it's just in no way good.
0385507755|5.0|A Million Little Pieces is a great work, and I found it very difficult to put down...Personally, I loved Frey's style - very much stream of consciousness in the first half of the book, as he is in the beginning of recovery, and more rational and coherent as he progresses. I have had no experience with addiction, but I feel that this book truly gave me a feel of what Frey's addiction and recovery were like. Great memoirs give you an opportunity to see the world through someone else's eyes; even if that world is one that you hope never to encounter on your own, you can learn a lot from those who have been there. I highly recommend this book.

1559409010|3.0|Ahh, the Pythons. What would life be without them? Certainly for me it would be more dull and boring.<br />Having brilliantly skewered the Arthurian legends in &quot;Holy Grail&quot; the Pythons set their irreverent sights yet higher to target the most sacrosanct: the New Testament.<br />While this has the classic Python-esque wry humor and satire, there's something a little more timid here. The jokes just aren't as funny, the satire isn't as sharp. And the acting just lacks that full-throttle zaniness that I've adored since &quot;Flying Circus&quot;.<br />When this film was made &quot;Flying Circus&quot; was long gone and each of them was well along in their solo careers. Bringing them back together for this project has the feeling of a worn-out school reunion.<br />Maybe they had too much money to play around with, too. Much of the charm in &quot;Holy Grail&quot; for instance, is the guerilla filmmaking where they had to get absolutely as many laughs for the dollar as possible.<br />To put it another way, since I purchased &quot;Holy Grail&quot; last year I must've watched it 5-6 times. &quot;Life of Brian&quot; on the other hand, I've only played once. Will I watch it again? Sure. It IS funny, but not my favorite.<br />I would give the film 4 stars but for the DVD: the transfer is quite poor. The picture quality looks like the master was taken from a over-rented VHS tape and the sound is all over the place. I often had to resort to subtitles to understand was was being said -- if I raised the volume instead then all the foley effects and music were way too loud.
B00005N83M|5.0|I don't know why y'all hatin on my gurl. I'm one of her biggest fans and I love her music. I especially love this Cd. My favorites are: Love don't cost a thing, Come Over( warning: this song is very sexually charged, so I recommend parents to watch out for this one), and Secretly( J.Lo doesn't sound that bad!)
B00005LK1N|1.0|hi there. im danish and a very big yes fan for more than 25 years. when i saw this special-edition was available, i couldnt resist. i bought it for a total of $$. i cant describe my dissapointment with all them drop-outs, specially on the ROUNDABOUT, ive always been told, that japanese were perfectionist. the japanese people who have made my copy must have had a very bad day. my advise is, go bye the RHINO remaster, it looks and sounds perfect. absolutely no drop-outs and the sleeve and booklets are better. AND IT ONLY COST YOU A THIRD
B00004XOWM|1.0|3 stars, Heh? It's an average? No, this is worse than 3 stars.
B00008J4P5|5.0|I thought that rock was dead but those two guys reminded me that is still alive. Thank you Meg and Jack for this album. &quot;I just don't know what to do with my self&quot; hearing and hearing all day long those purerock songs...

0440237688|4.0|The Giver is a suspensful book that keeps you guessing on what Lois Lowry is trying to get to.  Then when you find out what she was trying to get to and you will say \\"ohh. I get it.\\"  It is interesting because the book is almost opposite from the way we live here.<br />  The only downfall is the ending because you have so many answers to choose from of how the book ends.  I wasn't a big fan of the ending but you might so find out by getting The Giver.
0393057658|4.0|For all those hours spent cursing at Tony La Russa and his misguided philosophies on hitting, this book is quite the antidote for any Cardinals fan. At last there is a solution! <br />In all seriousness, it's wrong to criticize Mr. La Russa that much -- he's brought the Cardinals into the playoffs two years in a row and three out of four. But in many ways, he simply is archetypical of a thinking that this book points out to be -- if not wrong -- as substantially incorrect. Michael Lewis, in a taut 288 pages, details Billy Beane's playing career, Sandy Alderson's influence, and the slowly creeping and intelligent theories of Bill James eventually being realized by the Oakland Athletics.<br />In sum, Lewis deconstructs baseball strategies to a measurable science, to an economic study, really. It's not at all surprising that most of the principals -- James, DePodesta, Cramer -- have backgrounds in economics because that's all they're doing with the national pastime. Yet, this book and this new way, as James astutely points out, is not about statistics. It's about the proper usage of them. Instead of the five tool scheme so adored by scouts, these gentlemen decide to use the tools that their computers develop. And while it is true the A's have no World Series ring to show for it, it's by no fault of the strategy. <br />It seems rather unfortunate that Lewis chose to focus a large chunk of the book on Scott Hatteberg and Chad Bradford rather than the Big Three -- Zito, Mulder, and Hudson. Not taking anything away from these role-players -- their stories are woven beautifully into &quot;Moneyball&quot; --they are just not as important to the A's success as the pitchers. It may have been more convenient for Lewis to focus on Hatty and a relief pitcher, but it would have been more satisfying if he would given the pitchers the ink they deserve as well. <br />That said, this large omission does nothing really to hurt the quality of the study, which is fabulous. A gift to baseball and my Cardinals like no other, if only the men in charge would listen.
B00000G3AZ|3.0|I am a big fan of the A&amp;E/Kate Beckinsale rendition, so I approach this from that perspective.  This &quot;Emma&quot; appears to be an attempt to upgrade the story to a more contemporary audience.  The language is made a little more modern (meaning sloppy), the dance music is almost too fast to give time for graceful movement.  A visit to a poor family's cottage is a forced attempt to remind us of life for &quot;the rest of the folks&quot;.  So this rendition is more PC.<br />Yet, this movie does present possible logical explanations for some of the A&amp;E gaps, and it does have some interesting spins on how things could progress.  Gwyneth Paltrow does not seem to have the emotive repertoire of Kate Beckinsale, which is a diminishment.  For those of a more classical bent, this rendition might not satisfy.  However, if one reminds oneself that this is NOT the A&amp;E version, it is fairly amusing.
B000002LKU|5.0|I heard \\"Sweet Dreams\\" on NPR one night and next day went to Amazon.com to find out about it.  Bought it and have not stopped playing it since.  I do not agree with \\"if you liked this, try this\\". None of the suggested albums are anything like \\"Presumed... This CD is truly sweet and slow and dreamy.
B000006TRV|5.0|Before you listen to this, forget who you are going to listen to, relax, and forget whatever you know about this band. <BR>As this is a concept album, everyone will have there own interpratations of it. I, having not seen the movie, will tell you mine.<BR>The main carachter is born in the second song. While the mother was pregnant, the father had ran away. The main charecter was normal physically but mentally he is insane. As a teenager he has a girlfriend named Vera. After graduation, he moves away and becomes a rock star.

B000089RVX|5.0|Wow... is all I can say. So many people have posted reviews and so many contradiction opinions. Which is understanding seeing as Evanescence is so different. <BR>I have never heard anything like it. Amy Lee has the single most stunning voice I have ever ever heard... and with Ben Moody they both write the most amazing, true to life lyrics I have seen for a long time.<br />The wide range of styles and content in the Fallen Album means that I listen to it all the way through -every- time, without skipping a track, there isn't a weak one. You have the haunting ballads My Immortal and Hello (which is my personal favourite) and then the 'rock', but even there Lee and Moody are bending boundaries with the eerie strings and choral accompaniment (Whisper) <br />This is a must have for anyone and everyone.

B00008OWZC|5.0|This is an excellent triple CD set.  All live, and better than their only live release when the late great Bonham was still present on this hemisphere.  The Band is heard playing with such soul and passion, as they truly won the west (aptly titled CD).  I was living in LA at the time, but wasn't interested in going to a British rock group (Heavy metal was coined after the critics saw them perform live).  Of course, I caught on to their act too late.  This CD is a fine rediscovery from Page and company to pull out of the vaults.  Hey, Joe, if your reading, this is your little buddy now living in Tokyo.  Remember when we saw &quot;The song remains the same?&quot; in Covina, California?
0156027321|4.0|Fact or fiction?  I read this book over the course of two days, reading late into the night and using up a rainy day.  Who would imagine that 247 (or however many) days at sea could be so captivating?  I had to keep reminding myself that this was a work of fiction - a fantasy, almost - born of a writer's mind and delivered up in paper, not flesh and blood.  The enduring lesson is simply endurance; or maybe it's hope.  Or maybe - as the twist is delivered in the end - it's about how we shield ourselves from the unbearable by devising a more bearable, though surely less credible tale.  I found myself invested in the Life of Pi so much that I did not want to read the 'alternate' version he told to assuage the skeptical Japanese men.  How could I care so much?  This is, after all, just fiction...
6305265666|1.0|Now I don't have the DVD, but I've seen the movie.  I'm sorry to say but it was a huge waste.  A boring &quot;chick flick&quot;, i HATED IT.  It was boring, stupid, and it could barely keep my attention.  It was the story of Cinderella, played by Drew Barrymore, but I feel that the Disney version is much better.  This movie was horrible, pretty sets, but boring.  I reccomend it to nobody, unless you like this type of boring, nonsense, &quot;chick flick&quot; movie.
B0000024U8|4.0|This is an album composed almost entirely of blues, with a little soul (Man's Temptation) and jazz (Harvey's Tune) thrown in.  It is Al Kooper's creation, and his keyboards (mostly organ, some electric piano) anchor the entire effort.  Mike Bloomfield lays down sizzling lead guitar jams, but only on four instrumental tracks.  Steven Stills fills that role less inspiringly on the subsequent, less guitar-driven tracks.  Horns provide backup throughout, but never take the lead until the last track (Harvey's Tune), indicating that after being booted from Blood Sweat and Tears, Al backed off the idea of horn-based rock.  Although Mike's solos merit a close listen, the album as a whole rates better as background music to a late night party than it does as a front and center event.  It definitely has the feel of a \\"session\\", a very good one, but hardly \\"super\\", and you can get bored if you try to focus all your attention on it!  So why 4 stars instead of 3?  Simply because the 2-minute jazz masterpiece \\"Harvey's Tune\\", written by bassist Harvey Brooks, brings the whole album up one notch.  As jazz, it doesn't even belong here, and would have been much more fitting on the occasionally jazzy Blood Sweat and Tears debut album \\"Child is Father to the Man\\".  It has a gorgeous major-minor melody (sax in the lead), exquisite harmonies and counterpoint from trumpet and trombone, and Al's electric piano brilliantly defining the theme and the complex chord progression.  It is moody and sophisticated and utterly beautiful - and much too short!  So give the album 4 stars, and hooray for Harvey!
B00007ELEL|5.0|Not many people know about this movie. The Coen brothers did this and it is an underrated masterpiece. All the actors did an excellent job. John Goodman was hilarious and this was undoubtedly his best performance. John Tuturo was also funny as 'jesus' and just remarkable. Jeff Bridges, as the main star, did an outstanding job as usual as 'the dude'. There are so many one-liners in this movie that it's ridiculous. It's one of those movies you can watch over and over and still laugh out loud at. In the days where movie critics are a joke, no one really knows who knows whether a movie is good or not. Well, trust me, if you're in for a hilarious movie with an intelligent script and not you're average teenage comic rehash, check this movie out. It's original and I promise you'll be glad you did!
B00004YX39|5.0|1980's \\"Gaucho\\" was Steely Dan's final album before embarking on their 20-year sabbatical from recording together again. Apparently, Walter Becker & Donald Fagen reached loggerheads in their partnership on this one, with both men having personal & business-related problems at the time. The recording of \\"Gaucho\\" was long & laborious, and one particularly treasured song, \\"The Second Arrangement,\\" was tragically lost, having been accidentally erased by a careless engineer. That Becker & Fagen finally finished the album despite all of the behind-the-scenes problems must be considered a great miracle. Just seven tracks long, \\"Gaucho\\" is easily the lightest, most laid-back album in Steely Dan's catalog, but that certainly doesn't make it bad. It's a wonderful, handsome disc, filled with the fine quality jazz/pop & production skills that the Dan are famous for. \\"Babylon Sisters\\" is a fine, slow & steady shuffler. \\"Hey Nineteen,\\" the big hit from the album, is a bouncy, sparkly tune, and \\"Glamour Profession\\" is very groovy. The title song is more laid-back, but has marvelous melody to it. \\"Time Out Of Mind,\\" the closest Steely Dan get to \\"rocking out\\" on this album, is a terrific toe-tapper, and arguably the best tune from the album. \\"My Rival\\" is a cool smooth-groover, and the finale, \\"Third World Man,\\" with it's feeling of calm, is a tranquil, peaceful gem for Walt & Don to exit with.Thankfully, \\"Gaucho\\" was NOT the last we'd ever see from Steely Dan. Becker & Fagen finally put the Dan back together again in 1993 for a successful concert tour, and then, at long last, they released a brand-new studio album in 2000, the Grammy-winning \\"Two Against Nature.\\" But it must be said that the duo's first era of work ended on a very solid note with \\"Gaucho.\\" Granted, the blood, sweat & tears that Walt & Don shed to make \\"Gaucho\\" ended their partnership for 13 years, but they still managed to deliver another terrific platter of music. \\"Gaucho,\\" in my book, is a very cool Steely Dan album.
B00005U2JL|3.0|If you're looking for some real explicit and offensive language, messages and attitudes, you've reached gold...<BR>  I wasn't a real Manson fan before I bought this DVD (I bought it because I wanted to know more about him), and now I must say I staret to enjoy some of his songs and attitudes.<BR>  My personal favorite live performances are: \\"Rock Is Dead\\", \\"The Fight Song\\", \\"The Love Song\\" and \\"The Dope Show\\". They rock! Awesome songs!<BR>  It's a full-screen show, and it's much better in 5.1 Surround...<BR>  There is also a documentary called \\"The Death Parade\\", featuring Eminem and Ozzy Osbourne. It's about his tour repercussions. Involves religion, sex, death...<BR>  The reason why I don't give this DVD a five or four stars is the same reason I gave this three stars: explicit content. The documentary \\"The Death Parade\\" contents really strong material for anyone under the age of 17 (here in Brazil, it's prohibited for anyone under the age of 18)... Sometimes it's even disgusting. And you'll get in this conclusion: Manson is absolutely insane.<BR>  Do not ignore the \\"Explicit Content\\" label in the cover. Don't say you haven't been warned.
B00009EIQE|5.0|I have to admit I was a little hesitant about this cd when I heard it was all acoustic. I love Buddys stinging and blistering electric guitar solos, but man oh man is this cd a real blues treat! Buddy Guy is the real deal and he has no problem proving it here! Eric Clapton and BB King lend a hand on &quot;Crawlin' Kingsnake&quot;, and Clapton plays on &quot;Lucy Mae Blues&quot; as well. Buddy's vocals are right on and at times make your spine tingle as you really find out here what the blues are all about. Every song on this one is great, my favorites being &quot;Crawlin' Kingsnake&quot;, &quot;Moanin' and Groanin'&quot;, and &quot;Black Cat Blues&quot;. If you love the blues then this cd will definetly put you in blues heaven! Thanks for the great music Buddy!

Martel also bring about religon though I dont feel that it has an impact on the survival of Pi.

B000002BBY|4.0|Oasis, \\"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\\" has some \\"feel-good,\\" \\"back-in-your-high-school-day's\\" songs. I've been listening to it since I was 17. This is their best album, with the melodic \\"Wonderwall\\" and \\"Champagne Supernova.\\" The words to Wonderwall, (depending on the way you interpret the lyrics) paints a \\"mental picture\\" of how life could be a \\"winding-road\\" sometime. It's where you get into this relationship with someone; it's like you're not quite sure what to say to the other person. In other words: meaning love is blind. It evokes the feelings you're having with a \\"higher-being\\" like God being the Wonderwall, I guess. Who knows? Perhaps, it could be a telepathic conversation you're having with the unknown?   <br />It's pretty sad, how Oasis seems to be fluttering with their other albums. \\"(What's The Story) Morining Glory?\\" is the only album I like of theirs. It seems to me like they've been teetering on the brink of disaster, with all the cacophony in all of their other albums. Moreover, the band Oasis, in which Noel Gallagher and his brother Liam, assembled together back in the early '90's, is like a tribute to the Beatles, AKA the \\"Fab- Four.\\" Oasis, like their Beatles counterparts, indulged in the uses of illeagal drugs to get high. Nonetheless, my point being that Oasis' music sounds a lot like the old '60's rock music of that era. I hope they'll come-out with a \\"greatest hits\\" package pretty soon and some better albums in the future.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Radiohead suprised me with this record. Not that I wasnt expecting the same ambient noises and maticulus sounds, but they seemed to fit a bit more rock into the album. More guitars, drums, bass, and just an overall effect of Ok Computer. It fits in a nice feeling of solitary tranquility. Can possibly be doubled as a sleeping device for insomniacs. I've found it helps.
B00005NC66|4.0|When I first saw Godard's Breathless, perhaps I had my expectactions high, or rather manipulated to be as such from reading other reviews, and I ended up thinking that while there was a flair for style and a rhythm that was a reminder of the jazzy feel in Cassavettes' Shadows, the characters, inparticular the lead, were too shallow, self-righteous, and all-too-vain for comfort - or perhaps too, well, French.<br />On a few more tries of the \\"groundbreaker of the French new-wave\\" (which I believe was at it's absolute best in Truffaut's 400 Blows, accessible to a wider audience), I see that Godard, as much as he probably loves his characters, he despises them as well, in a sense.  It could even be suggested that Godard sees himself in the lead Belmondo's role, and if that's the case then Godard is practicing the old self-reflection trick (though the story is loosely based on a newspaper article, scripted by Truffaut himself).  For those that can take such filmmaking, this is the treat of the week.  And for film buffs it should be seen at least once to get an idea where most \\"affluent\\" independent filmmakers get their edge, and indeed its rhythm will give inspiration to struggling filmmakers.  I might even see it again in several months to remind myself how inspired the jump cuts were that Godard used.  But, I certainly don't think that it's among the greatest films ever.
B00008LDPU|4.0|I don't really know how I could recommend this DVD to people who are either unfamiliar with the Matrix mythos or who are unwilling to watch a series of short animated films, each with its own visual style and depth. However, as an \\"anime rookie\\" (I've seen Akira and Ghost in the Shell) I can say that artistically this DVD is stunning. Each short is presented differently and each one shines in its own particular/peculiar way. If you have the inclination to try a film that is beyond standard fare you should at least rent this title. I can say, however, that the two Parts of \\"The Second Renaissance\\" are among the most visceral films I have seen in some time, either animated or not. I could not get the images out of my head. Neither gratuitous nor exploitative, there are several uncomfortable scenes involving human vs. robot revolts, dismemberment, and/or mayhem which were as striking as they were disturbing, particularly a scene where you see several brawny men restraining what appears to be a human woman in a revealingly torn shirt. Shockingly, one of them wields a large pipe and bludgeons her with it, ripping the synthetic skin on her face and revealing her to be a robot. The viewer is shocked...should you be grateful that it was not a person who was brutalized, or should you still feel the horror? In short, it is beautifully animated and thought-provoking fare that will knock the socks off animation fans but will probably not appeal to most who are outside of the genre. NOT FOR KIDS!!!!!!!!!
B000002J03|5.0|This album is arguably their greatest with Zep 1 being right on it's toes.  I spent many hours practicing guitar to this album as the songs are so fun to play and Page did his best stuff on it.  Each member was musically at their best I believe, it is such an artistically strong masterpiece.  Plant is amazing on this album.  Basically, words can not adequately describe the excitement, pleasure, and hard heavy metal rock this album puts forth.  The younger generation just don't understand.  Their bands could not even carry Zep's guitar picks.  Buy it, you'll like it!
B00008PX8P|5.0|First i want to say that Amazon got my order here fast and secure. I am very impressed! Second....  This DVD is a true time portal.  I have been a Zep fan since I was 10 years old, and (Im not giving away my age lol) but Its amazing to see the early stages of this stellar band. All the way through to the end of the flight. I remember hearing the day JB died and (another hint at my age lol) and I was saddened... Since that time I have always love Zep, and have gone through many stages of picking them up and putting them down.  Well since the West was won and this DVD came out it has sparked a new flame for a Incredible band that I never have gotten to see. All the way to the year I was born ( ok if you dont know my age your pretty dumb lol) It is amazing to see how many times they take the same song and just play whatever and still are in tune with each other. That my friend is true speech through music.  Of course I love bands like Rush and perfection too, but This DVD captures the magic of a true mammoth of a band. When I hear people say Zep sold out im like whatever.. People loved them and its evident in this film.  making cash from people who love you is not selling out its giving and recieving... Anyhow..lol. Tangets lol.  If you even remotely were or are into zeppelin.. this is a piece of music history, GET IT.  Ive heard every single zep song a million times and its fresh again and new versions of the same songs are awesome. As a drummer myself, all the footage of Bonham alone is worth the price. (I also play guitar and Bass.. So To me its a bargain lol) Seeing them when They were 20 and how far they were along musically is also mind boggling. Anyhow.. Zep by far was (and hopefully is again) the Best band ever.. Well.. there are the 10 top bands of all time.. But Zep is on the mountain.. This DVD is AWESOME, INCREDIBLE and easy to watch over and over ( I rarely watch movies over and over too) The sound is cleaned up and if you watched the Song Remains the sameas many times as I did, your in for a treat. The pictures are sharper and the sound is not as watered down. ( TSRS is sonically inferior and The fidelity is not as good as this one ) Its like you were there. Have fun and rock on people..Sorry for the typos.. this isnt a school report lol. Peace
B000000YG5|5.0|I was not quite familiar with Sonny Rollins before this album.  I just picked it up at the store one day because one of my friends was raving about how awesome of a sax player he was and also because I read that he was a big influence to one of my favorite saxophonists, John Coltrane.  When I heard the first note from Sonny's sax I noticed something that I've never heard in any other sax's tone.  I heard a real controlled rich sound that was truly brilliant.  St. Thomas written by Sonny has a bit of a latin touch to it.  Max Roach first lays out the beat then comes Sonny blowing down the head.  Sonny's solo is just awesome with those octave jumps.  Moritat is a very familiar tune but under a different name, you'll know what I mean when you hear it.  To me there are two tracks that really stand out above the rest, Strode Rode and St. Thomas. On the swinging starts and stops of &quot;Strode Rode&quot; and the dreamy blues cycles of &quot;Blue 7,&quot; Rollins began his solos with simple melodic motifs, and orchestrated them into grand, elongated thematic statements--every note made meaningful by Rollins' extraordinary sense of development and intuitive musical architecture. Any body wanting to listen to a good saxophonist should really check out Sonny Rollins' Saxophone Colossus.
B00005J73X|3.0|Bon Jovi is one of the best live bands I have ever seen in concert, (and I have seen such mega acts as Paul McCartney, U2, Aerosmith, the Rolling Stones and Nirvana) but this album did not seem to reflect the energy and quality of the live shows I have seen the group perform. It really is not a bad album, per se, BUT it could have and should have, been better. I am REALLY looking forward to their live acoustic album coming out in the fall, because if you have not heard such classics as &quot;Livin' On A Prayer&quot; or &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot; acoustically, you will be in for a treat. Let's hope they get it right with that release, and even put some covers on it as well.
B00000I8UF|5.0|One of the most well known jazz recordings for the title track, there is no doubt in my mind why it was so successful.  This is by far one of the essential jazz albums of all time.  The different styles, that cover standards, like Come Rain or Come Shine, bluesy material like Moanin', to real hardcore bop like The Drum Thunder Suite, all make this album so unique and make it stand out above the rest.  Just the line-up guarantees this to be a good album.  Art Blakey one of the finest drummers during the 1950's and 60's recruited a new trumpeter that got his debut in Dizzy's Big Band, Lee Morgan on trumpet, Benny Golson, a major key in the success to this album because he was the one that wrote most of the songs, on tenor, Bobby Timmons, a prime leader in the soul jazz movement, on piano, Jymie Merritt, a long time companion to Art, on bass.  f you simply can only have one Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers disc (and why would you stop there?), it absolutely must be MOANIN'.  That's all there is to it.
B00008DDSC|5.0|This film could have been third class perverted semi-porn movie. But the director Steven Shainber did great job in turning a bit perverted material-sadism and masochism-into absolutely funny and cute love story. Although the movie deals with somewhat irregular sexual issues, it is never erotic or disgusting. The reason, I suppose, is truthfulness and purity of the characters. <BR>Maggie Gyllenhaal(Lee) did stunning work in playing a very pure, yet unconventional, female secretary. Lee looks somewhat dumb and weak to her desire, but at least she is uncontaminated by the outside world and true to her feelings. The way she tries to seduce James Spader is quite adorable. <BR>James Spader also proved that he is a great actor. Mr. Gray (Spader) is slightly deviated from the normal person, but still he is greatly attractive man. How he heals the wounds of Lee and how he resists her seduction induces laughter from the audiences. <BR>This film is never typical and never normal, yet it shows the true feelings of the human beings. This film depicts physical attraction, yet it show what real love is.<BR>I absolutely recommend this film to everybody and I guarantee that anyone who sees this film will like it.
B00000IL26|5.0|Just eight years after his debut in the Dizzy Gillespie Big Band, Lee Morgan made one of his most famous well-known recordings of his career, The Sidewinder.  The opening title track is a swingin' melody that includes solos from every artist on the album except for Higgins.  The line up includes, then the up-and-coming, Joe Henderson on tenor, Billy Higgins on drums, Bob Cranshaw on bass, Barry Harris at the piano, and of course Lee Morgan on trumpet.  The fascinating rhythm section figure established during the opening ensembles is sustained throughout the solos, giving this album a deep blues feeling as well as a Latin touch.  Lee's solo on the Sidewinder is so fluent, and swingin' it's hard to keep from just jammin' with him.  There is no down fall to this album, every cut being unique yet supporting each other making this one of my favorite Lee Morgan albums ever made.
B00000272N|5.0|Released just before the main seattle-based grunge scene, this is alice in chains' debut album sprouted from an unreleased demo, 'We Die Young', (I think)- which is actually the first track of 'Facelift', and what a start it is.<BR>Aswell as 'Man in the Box', 'Bleed the Freak', 'Sunshine' and 'Sea of Sorrow' the first track has a great guitar solo along with guitarist Jerry Cantrell's fast trilling and Layne Staley's versatile vocals.<BR> Facelift without a doubt , has the most powerful vocals by Staley than on any other AIC album especially shown in hit single 'Main in the box' and final stomper 'Real Thing'.  These go great with AIC's trademark layered vocals beautifully presented on 'Sunshine'.<BR> Although bassist Mike Starr and drummer Sean Kinney add superbly to this album, the quaking bass on 'It Ain't like that' and the high rumbling on the slowest song, 'Love Hate Love' added with sludgey drum patterns.  Cantrell contributes most to this release- writing almost all the music and half the lyrics.  <BR>  This is an exceptional debut when Alice in Chains were more a metal band rather than grunge in which they were categorised, but you can almost hear from the music where their music was headed, you can feel the pain seeping from your speakers during personal fave, 'Bleed the Freak' and 'Confusion'.<BR>  This was the hardest AIC album for me to get into but once you listen to it thouroughly you start to appreciate the artists contributions musically, like the great effect the guitar dynamics have on the frustration-influenced lyrics during the chorus of 'Put you down'.  This is a superb debut and worth adding to your CD collection. Sexual Chocolate Baby!!! \m/
B000002ADT|5.0|I actually give this album 500 stars for its brilliance. My first listening to this album was like no other listening I have ever experienced.  Miles Davis, one of the most genius jazzmen to ever be, picked the best musicians imaginable to join him. The line-up included John Coltrane on tenor, Julian &quot;Cannonball&quot; Adderley on alto, Bill Evans  (or, on &quot;Freddie Freeloader,&quot; Wynton Kelly) on piano, Paul Chambers on bass, and Jimmy Cobb on drums.  Coltrane's astringency on tenor is counterpoised to Adderley's funky self on alto.  Every thing came together so naturally and so perfectly, as if God made it happen the way it did.  This is one of the most amazing, incredible, brilliant recordings in the history of all music and definitely a milestone, a changing point in music.  This is if not the best album ever made it is definitely the finest Miles Davis session of all time.  This is without a doubt a work of art that can not be touched.  Some of the most brilliant playing of these artists.  God bless Miles Davis.
0679735259|5.0|Certainly one of the most visceral descriptions of the Vietnam War.  Herr dispenses with politics to get to the heart of the matter - the soldiers in the field.  He tells so many compelling stories of the front line experience, which served as fodder for both \\"Apocalypse Now\\" and \\"Full Metal Jacket,\\" co-writing the movie scripts.  What makes the book stand out is the empathy Herr had for the soldiers' experiences, subliminating himself in the course of the narratives.<br />Khe Sanh is indeed the centerpiece of the book.  He describes the battle from ground level, drawing comparisons to the infamous Battle of Dien Bien Phu, which brought the French chapter of the Vietnam War to an end.  Commanding officers bristled at the comparison, yet here were the Americans entrenched in a remote outpost, with the mysterious presence of the Viet Cong all around them.  Herr gives you the perspective of a handful of soldiers he was in closest contact with, following up on their fates in later chapters.<br />Herr doesn't try to make sense of the war, simply presenting it as the maelstrom it was.  Chaos reigned.  All you could do was keep your head down.  He ties you in to some of the other reporters covering the war, including the flambouyant Sean Flynn, who would ride into most any situation with the aplomb of his legendary father, Errol Flynn.  It is such a fantastic range of dispatches giving the reader a real feel for what went on in Vietnam.
B000000Y1H|5.0|I have to admit, I thought at first that Thelonious Monk sucked.  I used to make fun of him when I used to play the piano, telling my friends,\\"I'm Thelonious!\\" and I would start banging on the keys.  One of my friends, who is kind of a mentor to me because he was the one that got me into jazz and the one that I look to for questions about other artists, was raving about Thelonious and I told him I didn't really care for him all that much.  He was shocked and told me that Thelonious was one of the most brilliant pianists he ever heard.  I asked him if there were any must-haves from Monk and he replied,\\"Brilliant Corners.\\"  Then I went to Tower with him and picked this album up.  I kind of regret making fun of him after hearing this album because this is definitely one of the most hard core swingin' albums I have ever heard.  The line up is featuring some of the most well established and talented musicians of the time, Thelonious Monk (piano, celeste); Ernie Henry (alto saxophone); Sonny Rollins (tenor saxophone); Clark Terry (trumpet); Oscar Pettiford, Paul Chambers (bass); Max Roach (drums, tympani).  If you were like me disliking Monk, this album will definitely change your mind.  This is a true masterpiece
B000092Q7O|4.0|One cant help when watching this film if Roman Planski wasnt doing some hidden statement of his own, the brilliant pianist forced to etch out a living apart from the place he knows and loves.  Polanski driven from Hollywood forced to Europe. not able to give the world his great gift of film making.  Seriosly, it is good to see him score a hit, even though it will no doubt recall Shindlers list to many viewers, the core of the film is the story of one mans survival against all odds.The gritty often graphic film, stirs our emotions as Schindlers did, and once again causes us to hate the inhumanity of that time period, but how many films do we have to see on it to do that.  This is an amazing film on its own merit and not everyone will appreciate that.  Welcome back Roman.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|This is one of the best albums i have ever heard and the songs arwe just great! The Cd not only has american hits but songs in russian as well! To find out more info about t.A.t.U check out ... for info music and more!
B00007AJKI|5.0|My son dragged me to this movie..and I loved it!!<BR>Besides the dialogues, I also enjoyed the warbling edges and movements which suggests to me true life, how the edges are not as sharply defined as we think them to be. It was a poem of a movie.<br />remember to flick the lite on and off :)
B000089RVX|4.0|I got this cd last week and I havent stopped listening to it. The songs are so cool, with a mix of rock and amy lee's really pretty voice. THe only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because a lot of their songs sound the same...especially when you listen to it the first time.<br />Fave. Songs:<BR>Going under--This song is just really good cuz it's all rock-y and stuff <BR>Bring Me to Life--This single is definately one of the best..youve prolly heard it already and know why it's one of my favorites<BR>My Immortal--This song is really pretty<br />so i reccommend this cd to you definately..its really good
B000009EUM|5.0|In 1986, A-ha was quite popular in my area. There was something so different about A-ha compared to all of their peers. Morten Haarket's vocals for one, but the sounds they attained on this album and as a band in general are heard no where else. They must be the only users of their brand of keyboard or something. I will say that this was one of the most eagerly awaited albums of the year, after their infectious debut album. It did not disappoint. There was more electric guitar on this album compared to their first, and little or no acoustic. The synths were there, though, and the same dark but sweet sound was present.  There are great grooves (Cry Wolf), (Maybe Maybe). Ethereal, new wave (The swing of things), (We're looking for the whales). Flat out rippin' songs (The weight of the wind), (I've been losing you). And in contrast- introspective, dark haunting songs like &quot;October&quot; and the &quot;Soft rains of April&quot; that no one seems to do as well as this band, even to this day. Very colorful. Listening to any of their albums it's hard to believe they're only a trio. Like their first album, I could not stop listening to this and they are one of the 80's defining bands.
B000083E79|1.0|I don't see how anyone can stand to listen to her.  I can think of probably 1000s artists better than her.  Even Britney Spears has a chance to become better than Cher.  For your own safety please don't buy this album.  <br />Warning:  Side-effects from listening to this CD include: nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and bleeding through the ears, as well as severe brain damage(which explains why so many people continue to buy her albums).
B000002L7Y|5.0|When I first heard \\"Take on me\\" back in the 80's when I was 11-12 years old, I thought it was a cool new sound defining the growing new wave movement. I bought the cassette a couple of years later expecting it to be \\"take on me\\" and filler, as no other singles had been played from it. I was amazed as track after track of fantastic music kept me soaring on a musical cloud. They were immediately my favorite band, and I listen to a ton of other stuff. I have played this tape and it's replacement over and over for years, awestruck every time. The beautiful strings and guitar ballad \\"Hunting high and low\\" is one of the best songs ever written, a real tear-jerker. I play this song as part of my own musical repertoire, a-ha kept me inspired to become a musician myself. The child-like \\"Living a boy's adventure tale\\", with the band's first use of clarinet is a masterpiece. The album includes vastly contrasted themes such as the dark and teen-spirited \\"Dream myself alive\\" and \\"Here I stand and face the rain\\", probably my favorite song on the album with it's ethereal synths and haunting acoustic guitar and mysterious lyrics. The whole album rocks, soothes you, and trips you out from one song to the next. Lots of changing sounds and textures. Very talented musicians. I would say they are one of the top 5 most skilled users of synths. Skilled because they don't sound like computer music but rather like a pop orchestra with the great singer, lyrics, guitar, cool rhythms, nothing is overshadowed. All of their other albums are good too, but I agree with other reviewers that after \\"Scoundrel Days\\", something was lost and the magic was not as strong as their first two albums. Their music became more organic, less youthful and dark, less colorful and changing. This album and really \\"Scoundrel Days\\" too, are must-haves for any music collection. I just wish they'd remaster them.
0451526295|5.0|I must admit that the first half of this book is somewhat slow and at times quite difficult to hold attention to.  I understand that the setting, personalities, and situations must be established in the first half.  Even so, the story is a gem well worth reading.  It has quite a different feel from the other Jane Austen books and the characters stick to your mind as people you will never forget.  A few characters are quite tragic yet do not deserve sympathy, which provides an interest in the reader's mind.  Fanny Price, the main character of the book, is an admirable and intelligent person whom I would not mind modeling myself after.  This is a GREAT book, so don't miss your chance to read it.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I was, and still am, a huge fan of Radiohead. I bought and downloaded, burned, and heard everything I could by them. One day, I came across an article on line comparing the two bands, calling Wilco &quot;The American answer to radiohead.&quot; Of course, I was intrigued, so I downloaded &quot;I am trying to break your heart.&quot; And suffice to say, the song did. I thought I could never replace Radiohead, but Wilco proved me wrong. I immediately bought this cd, and much like Radiohead, it took about 2 or 3 hearings to really appreciate the music. But by the time the cd ended, I had stopped everything I was doing, and just stared at my cd player. I had never heard a more compelling, dynamic sound. While Radiohead's technical wizardy and Yorke's brilliant lyrics will always stand for themselves, Wilco does not have, say the same pretension and haughtness as Radiohead. They allow their songs to be fun, light, well composed and sometimes almost flippant, such as heavy metal drummer and I'm the man who loves you. But Wilco also shows maturity in songs such as Ashes of the American Flag, and Poor Places, as well as Jesus Etc., showing the band is capable of the same esoteric lyrics and metaphors as their British counterpart, but never losing touch with the audience. Their messages are straight-forward, allowing you to appreciate the lyrics and the music, instead of trying to delinate some meaning about mind-control or overpopulation that really seperates the mind from the music. Don't get me wrong, I love Radiohead, but sometimes my frustration over not understanding or grasping the theme does not allow me to fully devulge myself in the song. Wilco just plays and allows me to roam over in my mind the theme and mood of the song. A great buy, the only cd besides the bends I give to people! I have given so many of my friends this cd I think I could make the album go plantium myself!
6305907145|3.0|This movie does not do justice to the book.  It does not capture the full meaning of the story and a few elements in this film are completely out of character.  If this film is regarded separate from the book, it might deserve a higher rating.  A few important scenes which take place in the book are replaced by others in the movie which alter the feeling of the particular moment.  If you wish to see a movie that stays true to Jane Austen's book, this is not the movie for you.  To watch this movie and to possibly even enjoy it, the viewer must regard it as an entirely separate piece.  It is true that this movie has a few worthy moments, but the book is more worthy of your attention and time.
B00008NG5V|5.0|Jack's new CD is amazing. I bought it three days ago and haven't turned it off yet. This CD has more &quot;soft&quot; songs than Jack's first CD, Brushfire Fairytales, and less up-beat songs like Mud Football and Flake. After his first CD I thought he could never come out with anything close to it, but this CD has showed me otherwise. If you liked Jack's first CD you will definitely enjoy this one. <BR>Top 5 songs:<BR>Times Like These<BR>Taylor<BR>Holes to Heaven<BR>Cookie Jar<BR>Rodeo Clowns
0425170349|5.0|You've heard of books that one simply &quot;can't put down&quot;, well that was how this one was with me!   After reading other books with small parts for John Clark and his side kick, this one was spectacular and awesome.<BR>  Rates right up there with Richard Marcinko and his Seal Teams adventures.
0553801511|5.0|This book continues the story of Fitz. It follows his growth into his new /old setting of Buck Keep and its intrigues and introduces what will be the quest for the next book. Hobbs is very comfortable with the character of Fitz as well as those from the earlier book and she uses that comfort level to move the characters from one point to another both in the plot and in their growth as a character. The only fault I could give is that for a second book it doesn't go very far. This is more because of it being an intro to the quest and following the growth of the characters rather than the second book in a larger story. I give it a B+ on the StuPage.
B000006TRV|5.0|The Pink Floyd Albums I listen to the most are Animals, Wish You Were Here, The Wall, Dark Side Of The Moon, and Momentary Lapse of Reason is good but to me may as well go under a different band name.<br />There is not a song on The Wall I dont like, matter of fact, some of them feel like a part of me, and I dont get that as much from the other albums. I fond that for me there are some albums that I like right off, and there are some that take time to sink in before I really start to like them. This was one that took a little time to sink in. But as with most albums that reach me that way, once it sunk in, i was in love.  ...thats how music hits you sometimes.<br />The story is pretty cool, what makes this album great to me, is that the frustration and emotions of the main character that comes through Roger Waters' voice comes through with such with such beleivable emotion. I mean really the words could just as well be anything because the melodies are good enough to carry the songs on their own. However, the story is good, is believable, and anyone can identify with.<BR> <BR>There are Great guitar solos around every turn, nice musical pasages everywhere. Beautiful piano as well. The special effects are not overdone and seem appropriate and on time. I also really like the fact that this was a two record set its helps with the drama of the unfolding story. In side one we see the mounting tension, confusion, agitation, and sliding of sanity of the main character.  Side One ends with the beautiful \\"Goodbye Cruel World\\"<br />\\"Goodbye, cruel world,<BR>I'm leaving you today.<BR>Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.<br />Goodbye all you people,<BR>There's nothing you can say,<BR>To make me change my mind.<BR>Goodbye. \\"<br />Side Two begins and our main character has slipped to the other side of sanity.....with open arms......?!?!?!?!? then we have comfortably numb.....<br />well ....its just a great album....my favorite floyd album, and one of my favorite all time albums....i try tolisten to it at least once every couple of months.....back in high school its was at least once a week
B00005JLEU|5.0|If you have never seen any of Mr. Mayazaki's works, get ready to be amazed. From all of the movies that I have seen, mind you I have only seen four of them (Princess Mononoke, Castle In The Sky, Kiki's Delievery Service and Spirited Away, they are all great, awesome, incredible. Spirited Away is basically about a girl named Chihido who stumbles into a world over taken by different types of spirits when going to her new house. When her parents undergo a transformation she must find a way to get them back to the way they were. In order to do that she must find work at the bathhouse and soon befriends a mysterious boy named Haku. Haku tells Chihiro that he will help her return her parents back to normal. So the adventure begins. That's basically the start of it. I hope this review will help you. And if you really haven't EVER SEEN Hayao Mayazaki's works this will be atsonishing!!

B000089RVX|5.0|I've lived in a decade of musical inferiority, rather it be the Limp Bizkits or the Nirvanas or Creeds of the world. Now in 2003, a band with talent finally emerges from the alternative/nu-breed rock scene. Although to put them in the category of alternative rock would be an insult.<br />Evanescence \\"Fallen\\" is, by far, the best rock album I've listen too in a long while. I could go on about everything that others have mentioned, but I would only be repeating the same praise from others. Amy Lee's excellent vocals, the prog traits, and so on. Not to mention that this is a big boost for female-fronted rock in general. Better than what Avril Lavigne and the rest of the teen pop scene has forced us to swallow in recent years.<br />If the other 700 or so reviews haven't convinced you yet, than BUY IT!!! I am the last person on Earth to ever recommend a modern rock album but this is the one you can't afford to miss out on!
6302913896|5.0|The \\"Twin Peaks\\" saga captivates with dark intensity tinged with left-field humor.

Beyond who killed Laura Palmer...WHERE IS BOB? To be continued up through episode 29!!! It'll freak you out, in that bizarre twisted way only Lynch's \\"Twin Peaks\\" and Dale Cooper can!!!
0596000480|5.0|This is a wonderful reference book.  Not for the beginner but the quality examples and the entire demonstrate concept is truly wonderful.  This is done without being to fundamental or dry. It covers the basic important appearance of JavaScript that you would expect in any book covering a progress language.  The explanation of questions you may have are already answered.  The reading goes by quickly and you just seem to understand what the author is saying.<BR>I highly recommend this book to all programers.
B0000640VO|5.0|I held out to get this movie for too long. Really, this is the movie that you will be passing around the neighborhood with great reviews. Your friends will be asking your opinion about other movies. The secret is all in this remarkable story that is guaranteed to charm. Subtitles only. It has an R rating, but in my opinion it wasn't deserved.
B00008LDPU|5.0|Unfortunately, there is a great amount of time between the &quot;Matrix&quot; and the &quot;Matrix Reloaded&quot;.  But through Animatrix, the average fan can get a &quot;catch up&quot;.  Though, not a fan of the 'animated' approach, if any of you find &quot;Reloaded&quot; to be confusing, watch &quot;Animatrix&quot; then go back and watch &quot;Reloaded&quot; and I bet you'll say that &quot;Reloaded&quot; is one of the best movies you have ever seen.
6303168507|5.0|This was a great movie well-made from start to finish but God it was extremely sad I almost cried at some parts. Great acting also, Ralph Fiennes and Liam Neeson did believable German accent. Ralph Fiennes you will learn to hate in this movie.
B00008LOS1|5.0|Any serious music fan already has a copy of WHO'S NEXT in their collection.  It is, after all, the quintessential Who album.  In fact, most Who fans--myslef included--already upgraded in 1995 when MCA rereleased the Who catalog complete with bonus tracks.  So why fork over good money for music you already have?  For me, it was disc two.  This is 75 minutes of material from an April 1971 concert at London's Young Vic Theatre, which gave the audience a sneak preview of material for the Who's  new album, which wouldn't be released for another three months.  While not all of these songs made it onto the final album, except for &quot;Young Man Blues,&quot; &quot;My Generation&quot; and &quot;Road Runner,&quot; a live audience was hearing these songs for the first time.  The performances on this disc rivals anything on LIVE AT LEEDS and belongs in any serious Who fan's collection.<br />Of the bonus material on disc one, the difference between this and the 1995 edition are not as pronounced.  The version of &quot;Baby Don't You Do It&quot; is  from the same session, but this is an expanded 8:20 version as opposed to 5:13.  [Incidentally, it's Leslie West on lead guitar.]  The alternate version of  &quot;Getting In Tune&quot; is previously unreleased. This version of &quot;Pure and Easy&quot; is identical.  &quot;Love Ain't for Keeping&quot; was previously only available on the revamped 1998 edition of ODDS AND SODS.  The versions of &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot; and Won't Get Fooled Again&quot; are also the same as on the 1995 release.<br />A cynic might ask, how many times do I have to buy the same album?  But any true Who fan will gladly fork over the money for this deluxe edition.  VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B00005A46T|5.0|If you liked SlipKnot's self titled cd, then you must get IOWA. Don't bother reading this review, get [up] and get this CD. I don't see anything wrong with this album. From (515) to IOWA, this entire CD was nothing short of the praise I give it. My recommended tracks off this cd are, well, basically all of them. By the way, what ...are you doing reading this. I thought I said to go get the...album!
B00008OWZC|5.0|It's official...you can now throw out your copy of THE SONG REMAINS THE SAME.  After more than 25 years, Atlantic records has released the definitive concert album from the premier heavy metal band.  Culled from two 1972 California concerts, this is two-and-a-half hours of primo Zeppelin.<br />And while it would not be until spring of the following year that HOUSES OF THE HOLY, their fifth studio album, would be released, four songs from that album were debuted during their 1972 concert tour:  &quot;Over the Hills and Far Away,&quot; &quot;Dancing Days,&quot; &quot;The Ocean&quot; and &quot;The Crunge,&quot; the latter as part of the 25-minute &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; medley.<br />In addition to highlights from their first five albums, the band shows us that their musical roots weren't exclusively the blues. In the 23-minute &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; medley they cover early rock 'n' roll  songs &quot;Let's Have a Party&quot; and &quot;Hello Mary Lou,&quot; as well as &quot;Goin' Down Slow.&quot;<br />As enjoyable--and indispensable--as this album is, I do have a few quibbles. [Get ready to hit the &quot;Not Helpful&quot; button, folks!] Some of Page's noodling on the first half of &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; is a bit bombastic. Also, was it really necessary to expand the studio version of &quot;Moby Dick&quot; from under five minutes to nineteen minutes?  [I played in a band in high school and we never gave our drummer more than five minutes--long enough to have a smoke.] And what was the point of listing the 14-second &quot;LA Drone&quot; as one of the tracks?  In addition, there are virtually no liner notes, and there is no booklet or concert photos.  If they were trying to cut costs, this would have easily fit onto two CDs instead of spreading it out over three.<br />With that said, this documents Led Zeppelin at the top of their game and the peak of their creativity.  This is a must-have purchase for any Zeppelin fan.  VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B00008OWZC|5.0|This CD collection could not be better, and I'm affraid I can't quite find the words to describe it.<BR>I played it on my DVD/home-theater and was blown away.<BR>Robert's voice is in great shape and he's great when he improvises lyrics, Jimmy's guitar is masterful (except the part where he plays the riff to Black Dog off key), John Paul Jones plays some mean bass and keyboards.<BR>Then there's John Bonham; his drumming is flawless, powerful, bone-crunching, excellent. <BR>The mixing was fantastic. You can hear Bonham's drums up front and personal, like you've never heard them before.
0374172897|5.0|This book is lovely. It truly looks into the depths of human darkness and light in the context of relationships, time, and many other factors.  I've read it twice and only enjoyed it more the second time.
B00008LDPU|3.0|Of the 9 short animated &quot;shorts&quot; on the &quot;Animatrix&quot; some are the best examples of animation available, while some are highbrow intellectualising which leave this viewer disappointed.<br />Final Flight of the Osiris - the Final Fantasy team put together a superior piece on the brave final stand of the crew of the doomed hovercraft Osiris. I loved Final Fantasy - Spirits Within, therefore I was expecting a lot from this piece and I was not disappointed. If only swordplay was more realistic (I don't care whether you're in the Matrix or not, some things in a sword fight work, while some things never work).<br />The Second Renaissance Parts 1&amp;2 - Finally the history of the world leading into the Matrix series and most questions are answered. A good piece.<br />Kid's Story - Awesome, the second best of the lot, the animation is a little hard to get used to, but after two viewings it's pretty easy to take. The best story of the lot.<br />Program - The best. Ninja Scroll, Wicked City, Vampire Hunter D - Bloodlust and Goku - Mr Kawajiri's work speaks volumes. A great example of good anime (there is a lot of bad anime running around).<br />World Record - The most interesting story of the lot, but the animation style was difficult to take. I really wanted to like it.<br />Beyond - A good story, with great characters. It would have been really interesting if Studio Ghibli was given the reigns of this project. I've always been curious of effects of a couple of bad lines of code in the matrix.<br />A Detective Story - Trinity is always good, but this segment could have been much better.<br />Matriculated - Nothing against Peter Chung (Aeon Flux is one of the best characters in animation ever), but this segment is a prime example of highbrow intellectualising which left me disappointed.<br />Don't pay full price for this disc.
B00006CXSS|5.0|TIIIGHT! If you are interested/a scholar of WWII, this is a great movie for you. Although it doesn't give a whole lot of history, it's really not needed. Didn't comply with your typical WWII (or war) movie--not overly dramatic nor repetitive battle scenes. Sweet movie! Get it!
B00005JLEU|5.0|The lastest offering from Studio Ghibli - Spirited Away continues the unpararelled streak of hitting cinematic home runs. Apart from Disney's Lilo and Stitch (which incidently also features the voice work of Daveigh Chase), Disney's recent run of feature length animated films has yet to produce a film which could be compared with anything Studio Ghibli has made.<br />Spirited Away has something for everyone: action, beautiful animation, great storyline and Bruce Lee-esque emotional content.<br />Like Princess Mononoke and Kiki's Delivery Service the main protagonist is a young girl who unlike nearly all girls in western animation has her own unique personality.<br />I would like to recommend this film to anyone and everyone. Although there are some scenes that may frighten young children (like Chihiro's parents being turned into pigs) some parental supervision may be needed.<br />But don't let the the scary scenes dissuade you from showing this film to kids as the themes of loyalty, hardwork, friendship and courage are worth the small scary scenes. Like Willy Wonka (but less scary).
0385504209|4.0|Dan Brown writes novels with complicated, often convoluted plots, and The DaVinci Code is no different in that respect. But overall it is the best he has done to date, and its tenure on the bestseller lists attests to that. Unlike &quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot;, which played fast and loose with the thriller genre mixed with irrational science fiction, blended with religious (Catholic) philosophy that just went too far over the top to suspend disbelief, in &quot;the DaVinci Code&quot; Brown lectures less, and writes &quot;to&quot; instead of &quot;down&quot; to his readers. In previous books I have felt he showed off too much, lecturing like a frustrated professor rather than being a story teller. Here he seems to have geared back and found a much better balance to create a truly memorable romp. The writing is dense, but readable, the plot is stellar, and the characters resonate. Definitely, I will be looking forward to the next Dan Brown.
B00008LDPU|4.0|Reminds me a lot of the old movie 'Heavy Metal.' This is a great compliation of stories involving characters that appear in the two films and a ton of backstory of how the matrix came to be.<br />I hope that this is the first in a series of 'Animatrix' movies. I'd love to see more just like it.<br />I'd be remiss if I didn't drop a quick warning as well, this movie earns its 'R' rating and is definitly not intended for younger veiwers, extremely graphic at points.

B00008DDXC|4.0|I am one of those people who will always like books better, no matter what.  I believe the book draws you into the story more, really portrays the fear Harry is feeling.  This is most likely quite difficult to do for a novice actor, but maybe something could have been incorporated into the script.  Also, one of my favorite scenes in the book, Nearly Headless Nick's deathday party was not included.  It would have been great to see more of John Cleese... can you guess I'm a Monty Python fan?  <br />The movie was surely much darker than the book seemed.  If this is the second book, I can't imagine the movie for the fourth (though I hear it isn't going to be made).  Maybe it is just the castle, or the fact that there's a snake going through the plumbing, I don't know.  I do love the Weasleys' house, and Diagon Alley especially.  I think Hagrid played a bigger role in the book, however, as did Professor Lockhart (who is my favorite character in the books, aside from Lupin, and all the Weasleys).  It would have been great to see more of the signed picture thing... I really loved that.  But aside from these points, this was a great movie.  Hope the third is just as good, or better, seeing how it is my favorite.
B000000I0H|4.0|Incantations is a rare gem in Mike's output. Very diferent from the previous three symphonic-folk-rock masterpieces, but also isolated from the rest of his discography. Here the musician-composer-interpreter is more composer than ever, in a very academical way, close to such composers as Steve Reich, Phillip Glass or John Adams, althought his distinctive guitar can also be found here. If the previous Ommadawn was folky and romantic, Incantations is minimalistic and classical, without the dramatic emotional intensity of his predecessor and more inclined to an aseptic flowing of musical structures and melodies. Mike gets very close to Steve Reich here, specially for the sparse use of melodic percussion, flute and strings, and also in terms of compositional technics: the use of minimalistic cells which create the base and background of the music. The chord-arpeggios are also very used and refer more to Phillip Glass; so any doubt that this is a real minimalistic piece of music, long and repetitive, but with great oldfield-melodies and idiosyncratic guitar-playing. The only link with Ommadawn is a medieval influence in some parts, but of course in a very different context. The best parts for me are part one and four, with a special mention to the vibraphone passage on part four, in which he uses changing meters as 4/8, 6/8, 5/8. In my opinion Mike reached a top with this work in terms of compositional ability and musical ambition (73 minutes of music), so he changed completly of musical direction to more easy and commercial works; a real pity. The sound-atmosphere of the recording is clear and sophisticated in itself (in contraposition to the previous albums, more raw and rustic), so there's no need to say that the remastered CD dignifies the final listening tremendously. The only problem with the remasterd edition is the bad quality of the covers, as another reviewer has pointed out, it seems like a colour photo-copy! what kind of Art-work is this? I can do it better with my scanner and computer. Five stars for Mike Oldfield and Incantations. Four for the edition.
B00008YLV2|5.0|Being one of the only modern day war films, this movie excels in its portrayal of present day conflict.  Technically correct in more aspects than any other military film, it does a great service to those who sacrifice for our country.  A must own for anyone who appreciates what our nations young soldiers give for our freedom and for the freedom of the people of other nations.  Unflinching in its combat scenes; there are no &quot;breaks&quot;, but rather only few moments where the honest feelings of these soldiers are revealed.  A true masterpiece of a war film.
6304806442|5.0|The giant joke of Trainspotting is hidden in plain sight, obscured by the loaded topic of heroin. Certainly drug culture is everywhere in the movie, but the heart of the film is what the narrator, Ewan MacGregor's character, sees as the obvious link between heroin addiction and working. The central passage of the film is the scene where MacGregor and his mates sprint through the streets, with MacGregor doing the voiceover:<br /><br />\\"Our only response was to keep on going and [*] everything, pile misery upon misery, heap it up in a spoon and dissolve it with a drop of bile, then squirt it into a stinking purulent vein and do it all over again-keep on going getting up going out robbing stealing and [*] people over, propelling ourselves with longing towards the day that it would all go wrong, because no matter how much you stash, or how much you steal, you never have enough, no matter how often you go out and rob and [*] people over, you always need to get up and do it all over again.\\"<br /><br />It's a passage that sums up the twin futilities of junkiedom and working class life, and it's no accident that this scene begins with a sprint from a store and ends in a courtroom, marking the twin pillars of a free-market economy. Or that the motive for the sprint--a habit-inspired shoplifting attempt--turns the chase itself into a kind of rat race. It's also no accident that the unrepentant Sick Boy escapes, the cleverly insincere MacGregor gets off easy, while unwitting Spud is nailed to the wall in court. Or that when MacGregor gets clean, his debauched heroin-culture skills of lying, stealing and hustling make him well-suited to a job as a rental agent. Or that the only sincere character in the film is the one undone by deceit, heartbreak, and drugs.<br /><br />In MacGregor's heroin world, the successful cheat as a rule, and they do it overtly; in his exposure to the working world, the same rules apply, everyone knows it, but no one admits it. In this conceit, Trainspotting emerges as a cynically perfect epitaph for American free-market culture spreading across Europe, with its heady mix of genuine aspiration, barely concealed greed, and deep denial--all neatly paralleled by heroin pleasure, heroin addiction, and the brain-addled values of the heroin culture.<br /><br />So while being terrifically stylish and funny on a number of levels, Trainspotting's foundation is what makes it a great film--a disaffected, disillusioned narrator trading one socially rejected role for a socially acceptable one and failing to see the difference between the two. It's a fabulously clever movie with an unnerving argument rifling through every scene, and you should get this DVD.

B000003TAR|5.0|Although this was not as commercial as 'Nevermind' 'In Utero'was a huge songwriting leap from 'Nevermind' and generally, shall we say,more angry than it's predecessor.Cobain's ability to draw in the listener was still there as was his hatred for the MTV audience he despised.In utero was basically a record about his life, Never had a star like Cobain laid himself so bare.For example Heart shaped box was about his love for his wife, 'Serve the Servants' was about how his father had let him down,'All apologies' was about the dissapointment he had for himself and in 'Dumb' it talked about getting high (a subject Cobain knew all to well).The bottom line is that if you don't already have this album then buy it otherwise you'll really be missing out.
0345451325|4.0|The book shouldn't be called The Fall of Reach, because that happens at the end of the book.  It deals mainly with the development of the SPARTAN-II subjects from day one and the various events leading up to the X-Box game.  Otherwise very enjoyable.
B000069AUI|5.0|I found this CD to be light-years better than 'Parachutes', which, honestly, I didn't find that good aside from 'Yellow' to begin with.  I heard 'A Rush of Blood...' before 'Parachutes', and probably wouldn't have given Coldplay another listen had it been the other way around.  There isn't a bad song on this entire disk.  Can't wait until the next one.
0553573403|2.0|I don't see the why there is such a buzz about this book.  I've read most of the fantasy/sci-fi authors that you can think of off the top of your head.  I don't think Martin is in the same league with Tolkien, Jordan, Tad Williams, or Feist.  I thought the book was well writen, but lacked novelty, wit, and most of all creativity.  It read more like a romance novel.  This book now holds up my window.  I suggest raeding Fritz Lieber, Micheal Stackpole, Gene Wolf, and Tad Williams.
B00005QK3B|5.0|This is without a doubt, one of the best albums I have ever heard in my life.  I don't usually tend to go with music that is 100% serious or emotional, but this hit me hard.  The music is very good, but the highlight of this album is Fish's lyrics and performance.  To me, lyrics have to be EXTREMELY well written to provoke any kind of emotion, but Fish succeeded here.  Fish was a very troubled guy, involved in drugs, depression, relationship issues, overwhelming stress,  and what-have-ya.  His outlet for this was obviously his music.  With the passion of his lyrics and vocals, you practically feel and experience everything he is going through as he's singing about failed relationships, drug abuse and depression.  There most likely be a song on this album that will stir memories of your own.  We've all experienced heartbreak and relationship troubles, and Fish knows how to tap into that and put it into words.  He says the things that you wish you could say, but could never find the right words for them.  He paints a very vivid picture with his lyrics that you can practically step into.  This album stirs more feelings of sadness, sorrow, and hopelessness than a hundred goth rock albums could only dream of doing.  Sure, the music is a tad dated, it sounds like 80s pop at times, but it works!  Don't ask me how, but it really works.  Once again I'll put that down to the great songwriting.  I don't mean to give Fish all the credit here, he was backed by some great musicians, no doubt about it.  But honestly, when Fish left, Marillion was done.  I know that's up for debate, but I would never hear anything from Marillion again that would pack a punch like the years with Fish.  And never so much than on Misplaced Childhood.  DO NOT LET THIS ALBUM GET AWAY.
0316666343|2.0|Whoever marketed this book did a great job.........it is my opinion that it is way over hyped, much too highly rated and doesn't deserve the attention it has been getting.  As I moved through it I couldn't help but think that I would have taken the story in a different direction. This happened often.  I found that much of the book spent too many words on subjects that were of no interest to me, whether fictional or real.  I was enthralled for the first two chapters and it was downhill from there and by the end I was really skimming to get it finished, always thinking that any minute it would reach out and grab me.  It never did.  Can't recommend this one.
0679745653|5.0|I really just loved this book.  This addition has BAT and three other wonderful Capote stories The House of Flowers, A Cristmas Memory, and The Diamond Guitar.<br />I like these stories because each shows that there is prices to be paid in life and that there are some both negative and postive conquences to almost any relationship.<br />BAT is a story is so unique it is about a girl that everyone wants to save, but who really never needs it.  Holly Golightly is a woman with an unknown past and a less known future.  Everyone she meets seems to think she is a fake but for the fact that she is genuinly not trying to convince anyone she isn't.  It is the story of a woman who wants freedom and love, but in a masculine way is willing to part with love that has to high a price.  There is only one Holly Golightly in the relm of literature.<br />The House of Flowers is about a poor Hatian girl who goes from being a well paid prostitute in Porto Prince to a wife of a honest man.  The story shows that she has to indure hardships in Marriage as well as in her first profession.  It also shows that often we only have to look back a little bit to see value of the present.<br />The Diamond Guitar is a story of two men in prision who are best friends and the conflict they have when one man wants to escape.  It has to deal with friendship, loss , freedom and memory.  It is comic and tragdic.<br />The christmas memory is just too hard to explain, but it shows the life of a person who never  can grows up and her experinece with a young boy who has no choice but to grow up.
B0000039PW|5.0|Debut album from probably the greatest freestyle rapper of all time. Hailed from Brooklyn, Biggie Smalls raps about everything on this album. From the art of robbing to women to hustling the streets he masters everything and comes up with some of the best rap on an album. Every track on this album is incredible, but my personal favorite is Unbelievable. The record also includes huge hits such as Big Poppa and Juicy. All in all this is the best East Coast rap album of all time and it may rank above those of Illmatic, Reasonable Doubt and The Infamous. Buy this and you'll be satisfied. I guarentee it.
B00008O31H|2.0|One problem with calling yourself a &quot;broken down blues-punk duo&quot; is that you should actually play some punk.  The Black Keys sound like your local blues trio that plays at the club down the street who heard the White Stripes and decided it would be a cool idea to kick the bass player out of the band.  There's no &quot;punk&quot; to be found here, which is fine, but as blues players the Black Keys are average at best.  This album isn't terrible, but if you like this stuff and you don't own a Muddy Waters cd, then you're just posing.
B00005AQF7|5.0|For all of those who heard him on the Chronic with Dre you know he can blaze a track. On this CD he produces hit after hit. Gin & Juice, Ain't No Fun, Tha Shiznit, Lodi Dodi, Who Am I (What's My Name) and Murder Was The Case are all West Coast classics. Before Snoop started going soft and making songs like \\"Beautiful\\" he was a hardcore gangster/funk rapper. This is a typical Death Row album and if you enjoy any kind of rap you should purchase this album. Even Jay-Z on Reasonable Doubt and the great Notorious BIG on Ready To Die sampled this album. That's saying something. Cop this!
B000066NW0|5.0|Seldom do I find a CD where I can listen through the entire thing and enjoy it all. This CD is full of variety, from catchy poppy songs like Sk8er Boi to softer, more &quot;romantic&quot; songs like I'm With You. It's also fun to sing along to :P I'd highly recommend it to the 3 people in the world who don't have it already.

0131103628|5.0|Besides &quot;assembly language Step-by-Step&quot;, this book is one of the best ever written. <br />Will you succeed in mastering C with this book?<br />Depends entirely on the fact how much effort and thought you put in the examples and exercises. For example, there's a procedure dcl() that converts C-declarations to plain English. If you understand this procedure, you will have a rock-solid understanding of complicated declarations like &quot;void * (*(*fp1) ()) [10]&quot; (a pointer to a function that returns a pointer to an array of 10 void pointers).
B00008LDPU|5.0|The newest Matrix, Matrix Reloaded, is very good, but this is even better. This DVD of Anime by the worlds greatest and latest Anime creators is full of amazing stories that tie into the movie directly (Final Flight Of The Osiris), tell the history of mankinds downfall (The Second Renaissance Pt. 1 and 2), or just focus on the smallest scale of what life can be like in the Matrix itself(Beyond and Dective's Story).<BR>The Stories themselves range from good to excellent and the acting is almost always subperb. Oh yeah, the picture quality and graphical style is either nice or totally, undenialbly, mind blowing! Whether you just enjoy anime, good storytelling or are just a Matrix obsessive, the rabbit hole certainly runs deeper than we could have ever imagined.
B0000640VO|5.0|Admittedly this isn't my first excursion into french cinema. I can't recall the exact film but I remember that it was very long but complex enough to sustain my interests. I would say this is the case for Amelie. I throughly enjoyed this film from it's photographic and sometimes surreal scenes to the interesting dialog. I am not apart of this silly, brainless anti-France kick. This film was a reminder that the best American films of which I have enjoyed were in a similar vein of being anti-linear and woven into a complex thread of scenes and events. Think Pulp Fiction without the violence or catchy one-liners. This is a definite buy but be warned, it isn't dubbed!
B00008S2VG|5.0|One look at the album cover of American Life and you may be inclined to think Madonna has created a whole body of music influenced by the controversy of war. You may even be curious to see just how controversial (or bad, if you've read the reviews) the music is. The truth is American Life is no fall from grace for Madonna, although the media and pop charts would like you to think so. In fact, American Life is as close to a masterpiece as Madonna has come thus far. And that is saying a lot. A listen to either of her greatest hits albums can tell you Madonna has explored some deep territory and has had significant influences on society, yet American Life is her deepest and most substantial social commentary yet. We first buy American Life with the preconception (generated by the first single) that this is a dance album. We expect to her the same overused synthesizer and dance sounds we've been hearing by Madonna since Music. You will be in for a big surprise. Never judge a book by its cover and never judge an album by its fist single. Simply, Madonna has created an album of love songs. With the combination of acoustic guitars, synthesizers, and Madonna's soft and vulnerable voice (singing almost jaded, as if she were a dreamer scarred from an unloving world and forced to be strong), you will not know whether to cry or dance. There is a difference between American Life and albums such as Music, where her voice seemed altered and affected. In American Life we can hear Madonna as we haven't heard her since the days of Take a Bow and Evita, singing from her heart and not a machine.  And what a voice it is.. Although not blessed with the range or power of a Christina Aguilera or Whitney Houston, has there ever been a sound so beautiful, full of warmth and humanity? What sets American Life apart from many other albums and what makes it my favorite album ever (not just my favorite by Madonna) is its theme. Many say this album isn't consistent. I say it is. Beginning with thepoetic and devastating American Life, where Madonna sings of the emptiness found in our culture, the album continues with a song that truly deglamorizes the false beauty of Hollywood, a place where happiness is not what it seems and where dreams come with a price. I'm so Stupid, a song about Madonna's dreams and the false ideals she bought from a mindless and heartless society. Then there are the love songs...dreamy and melodically beautiful like \\"Gone\\" from her Music album. The best is Nothing Fails, which seems to combine the best of Like a Prayer and Take a Bow. Intervention, the next track, is one of the album's greatest triumphs. If you're wondering what the intervention is, it is love. From what? Again, a society that doesn't know how to love. Clearly, Madonna does, which makes her early days (remember the Sex book?) seem so odd. But then again, songs like Erotica were always placed next to important love songs like Deeper and Deeper about falling in love when you're gay, the resistance from parents, and the heartbreak that can cause. Was she really \\"So Stupid\\" or is Madonna just unable to see her own genius?
B00003CXSP|3.0|Let me start by saying &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; was a masterpiece in the psychological thriller/horror movie genre. The acting, along with the directional style, and the disturbing storyline and insane villains, made it one of the most compelling horror films to date. It's difficult to live up to the standards set in &quot;Silence&quot;, and &quot;Hannibal&quot; proves that sequels can often become catastrophic. The film has a fairly good basic plot: Doctor Hannibal Lecter's frightening return. But, other plot elements (a crazy guy trying to feed Hannibal to wild bores) complicate the film. Julianne Moore is a good actress, but for me, Jodie Foster will always be Clarice Starling. As for Anthony Hopkins, his talent is undeniable, in my opinion. The Italian setting fits the character of Hannibal perfectly. But, the horror-movie grossness goes slightly over-the-top. All in all, a fairly good horror film, but not nearly as good as &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; or the Hannibal film that came out recently called &quot;Red Dragon&quot;.

0385504209|3.0|Like some of your readers, I found The Da Vinci Code to be a fun summer pastime.  But although I am no art history expert, I found some of the errors to be disconcerting.  In the first place, most art lovers refer to the artist as &quot;Leonardo&quot;, in the same way they call Raphael and Michelangelo by their first names.  No one would dream of referring to them as &quot;Buonarroti&quot; or &quot;Sanzio.&quot;  Also, Leonardo did not have &quot;hundreds of lucrative Vatican commissions.&quot;  He didn't even have hundreds of commissions period.  Considering his genius and his long life (69) his output is surprisingly meagre.  And his disappointment at receiving no commissions from the Medici pope Leo X, a fellow Florentine, is well documented.  Furthermore, Leonardo's Adoration of the Magi has no paint on it at all.  Only the underpaint, the preparatory ground, which is not grey-green but reddish brown.  No one has ever painted over it, unlike The Last Supper, which was painted over many times.  Surely the most rudimentary research would have prevented these errors.

006092988X|5.0|It was with relish that I opened the book for the second reading of  A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.  It is one of those novels that you can read over and over and find some lovely detail that was missed before with each reading.  This is the coming of age story of Francie Nolan and her family living in Brooklyn in the early 1900's. What is fascinating to me in addition to the story is the accruarate portrayal of life for the working class citizen at that time.  Life was hard and could be physically and spiritually back breaking for the uneducated working class man or woman of that time.  Betty Smith so beautifully captures this in her prose and observations about life.  This may be so, because the author grew up in those very neighborhoods at about that time period.<br />Francie is the daughter of John and Katie Nolan who grows up knowing that her father is an alcoholic and that her mother loves her brother Neely more.  Although this is conveyed to the reader what you really see is the love Francie has for her parents despite their shortcomings.  As a child she only sees the  way her father sings and his  poetic, dreamy view of the world. Francie admires the  hard working ethic and coarse love and protectiveness of her mother.  We meet her aunts and other neighborhood characters who add to the richness of the story and feel of authenticity of that time period.  She views all of the secondary characters for what they are, flawed but worth loving. She is a dreamer who goes from being a little lonely girl with the ability to see lifes ugliness with a sense of wonder and joy to an accomplished woman who still maintains this ability.  As the reader we are treated to life through Francie's eyes and that is truly a journey worth taking more than once.

One of the most infamous take over events in the 1980s has been exposed in full by this book.  <br />The RJR Nabisco Leverage Buy Out attempt finally exposed the greed and ruthless business accumen of the era.  Very enjoyable to read with the exception of you knowing that the end result still has far reaching consequences to this very day.
B000089RVX|4.0|I don't know if everyone can open their minds enough to enjoy a band like Evanescence. But this can't necessarily be surprising; when most people hear about a new hard rock band whose lead singer delivers her vocal in a Celine Dion-esque fashion (for example), they'd probably be like, \\"Huh?\\" It may sound experimental, but it does work.<br />The vocalist, Amy Lee, has an AMAZING voice, and her vocals work well over the mesmerizing guitar sounds that Ben Moody delivers. This is especially proven in songs like \\"Going Under\\", \\"Whisper\\", and the hit single \\"Bring Me To Life\\". But if you're looking for more mellow songs that work with a voice like Amy's, then \\"My Immortal\\" and \\"Imaginary\\" are probably more up your alley.<br />Sometimes it may seem like Amy herself has to try harder to let her voice match the music, because rock guitars are usually overpowering, so it may be hard to hear everything she's saying in songs like \\"Whisper\\" and \\"My Last Breath\\" (which are still good songs). And although I love the first three tracks (\\"Going Under\\", \\"Bring Me To Life\\" and \\"Everybody's Fool\\"), the music from those songs don't sound all that different from each other.<br />Oh well, most albums aren't perfect anyway. And this album is still exceptional, especially for a debut. This album may be called Fallen, but fortunately it doesn't look like the duo will be doing that any time soon.
B00005Y1TL|4.0|Aphex Twin is a musical genius, and this is some of his most early work. It may not have the polished and revolutionary feel of his newer work, but it is still a very wonderful cd. My favorite track on it is the wonderful &quot;Tha&quot;. This is one of the songs on it that is truely ambient. Also, don't be mislead by the name. Not all of this cd is &quot;ambient&quot;...beats reminiscent of early synth music run throughout much of it. However, it is still a great cd.
B00008J4P5|3.0|The White Stripes are actually one of my favorite bands. I already own and enjoy their first three albums, so when I heard that they were releasing a new one, of course I raced out to get it. Unfortunately (and people may not want to admit this), this album isn't without its problems.<br />Things start off with a bang, though, with the leadoff single \\"Seven Nation Army\\". \\"I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself\\" is great too. But the most innovative song would have to be \\"Ball And Biscuit\\" due to its spoken-word flow. And \\"In The Cold, Cold Night\\" was refreshing too because Meg was actually leading a song!<br />Sadly, being innovative doesn't always prove successful, as especially evidenced by the disorganized sounds of \\"Black Math\\"; and sorry, but I just couldn't get into \\"Well It's True That We Love One Another\\". Also, I had to stop a few times to make sure I was, in fact, listening to Elephant and not White Blood Cells because of certain similarities. \\"There's No Home For You Here\\" sounds a little like \\"Dead Leaves And The Dirty Ground\\", and when I heard \\"Hypnotize\\", I said, \\"I remember when this song used to be called `Fell In Love With A Girl'.\\"<br />One more thing I have to mention is the obligatory song that'll make you ask, \\"Was Meg even there?\\" This time around, that song is \\"You've Got Her In Your Pocket\\". The song is still good, though. In short, if you're a diehard fan of The White Stripes (like I am), you'll still feel like keeping Elephant in your collection, but you can't help but to feel a little disappointed. At least they can still blow you away when you see them performing live.
0894803123|5.0|This is worth buy, it has got almost EVERY recipe for ice-cream. This book calls for 1 and a half quart of ice-cream machine at least.
0679721037|2.0|Ok, I had to read this book for school and it was boring. We was hearing the book from a tape and i kinda felt like going to sleep. My teacher said it's a hard book to read (maybe because it kinda reads like a newspaper) Read this book if you want to.
B0000844I8|4.0|I don't have a lot to add to other reviews. I truly enjoyed the picture. However, this movie has nothing to do with time travel so I'm not sure why it's in this review area.
078322804X|4.0|The Blues Brothers is a great movie, but it's all about the music! If you get into it, you will soon be clicking your fingers to the catchy tunes, especially such tracks as 'Shake a Tail Feather' with the legendary Ray Charles and 'Sweet Home Chicago', the song at the end of the movie.<BR>The car chases are great, considering it was the early 80s and there was no computer-enhancement, the plot is good enough and there are some real killer jokes along the way, including my favourite line \\"We're not police ma'am, we're musicians.\\" <BR>John Belushi and Dan Akroyd are excellent as the leads on a self-described 'mission from God', with a star-studded list of musical guests, and the DVD also offers a very interesting 'Making of' feature that goes back to how the Blues Brothers started as a band before the movie. <BR>If there is one aspect of this film that makes it better than most comedies, it is the great blues music. <BR>Guaranteed to entertain you, and is an essential part of any real DVD collection!
6303481272|1.0|Unfortunatly I cannot give you a full view of the plot, because this movie was so incredibly [bad] I couldn't get to the plot. I can explain the few scenes I saw however. An epedemic is spreading and a group of warriors are trying avoid it. They are running through the woods when one man comes out and cuts them all in half. Yeah sounds awesome, but wait until you hear what comes next to judge the movie yet. The man takes a young girl back to a temple, and rapes her, that's right, rapes her. It is completly disgusting. I hoped that it was just one scene, there wouldn't be anything else like it. I fast forwarded to the next scene, yet another sex scene. This was the most disgusting anime i have ever seen in my life. Why it is so popular is beyond me, I cannot believe people are actually applauding a movie as shallow as this. The art may be good, there is no denying that, but it is how the art is used to carry along the action and plot that counts, not the quality of the art itslef.
B00004Z459|1.0|There are so many bands out there that are a million times better than Linkin Park and it's really sad to see this [garbage] as a top seller and get so much MTV and radio airplay.  It also bothers me that DJ's will speak of them as if they're the most original band that ever existed.  Contrary to popular believe, they aren't original at all.  Electronics and metal were combined, and done better I might add, by Industrial groups during the 80's.  I suggest instead of getting this go out and get a Ministry album like Psalm 69.  Go get Skinny Puppy's Rabies or The Process albums or Ohgr's albums.  He's relesing a new one in July.  They are a million times better than this garbage.
B00000IPAX|4.0|This CD is what made blink-182 well famous Blink-182 today. there are some great songs on this album and one of the best is Adam's Song. Altho what really hitt the charts was Whats My Age Again? it actually got kids asking that question. but most people already have this Cd, and if you dont i think you should....
B000069AUI|5.0|This band exploded with the single &quot;Yellow&quot; and teetered on the edge of being a &quot;one-hit wonder&quot; band.  This album proves that there is no danger of that happening to this band.  When you bring this one home, plan on an extended musical journey.  Just close your eyes, get warm and comfy and turn up the volume.  This rich collection of songs will move you to the very core of your being and then wrap you up warm in soothing, day-dreamy melodies.  <br />Any of these songs could stand-alone and be a radio hit instantly.  Yet, I have to agree with the reviewer who said this album plays as one long, beautiful song.  I feel cheated if I don't get to listen to the whole CD.  Coldplay is musical talent at it's rawest, rarest, and most moving.
