B00E8KLWB4|3.0|So far so good will keep playing. Don't like having to buy stuff just to play a game and being asked to share all the time.
1936608618|5.0|This was a gift and my husband loves it.  Great, well-written book with clear instruction.  I do recommend this book!
B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|Fresh new music with great lyrics. I hope she doesn't get bogged down by the Fame being so young and all!
B003G4W49C|1.0|My Pro: This book was shaping up to be a quick and easy read for a lazy day. The author throws you into the book but nothing's too out there that you can't just go with the flow and more or less get what he's talking about which is nice.<br /><br />My con:I wanted to read the book before delving into the movie and I was very upset by the racist language that was used in the book. I know there are some books that have certain, distasteful words throughout them if their time period pieces or more in line with pulp or grunge but frankly this book threw me for a loop with it being something that I see all the time in the YA section of bookstores as well as scifi.<br /><br />I overlooked the violence from the kids in the book as just something to take in stride since it was set as a war type novella but as someone from a mixed cultural and race family seeing certain words in this book totally turned me off from reading it after Ender joined the rat team.<br /><br />Heard good things about the movie but I doubt I'd go see it now.

1609611543|1.0|I think wheat and gluten may be unsafe to eat, but this book is an intense disappointment and waste of time.<br /><br />Instead of explaining his reasoning or presenting facts, this author repeats mantras of name-calling \\"bagel butt\\" \\"biscuit face\\" \\"pretzel brain\\" \\"wheat belly\\" and then offers great snake-oil-esque promises \\"you'll think clearer, cures cancer, diarrhea, joint pain, insomnia and you'll lose 20, 30, even 50 pounds!\\"<br /><br />He literally repeats these items verbatim in a list like this.  And he can't even keep track of these outlandish claims.  The first thing he says it wheat causes specifically \\"belly\\" fat and not other fat deposits. That seems to be important.  It is the title of the book, after-all, but then a little later he throws in man-breasts as a direct result of wheat.  Which is it?<br /><br />Give me a break.  He's a charlatan, peddling easy answers to a desperate audience.  And the author is a weak, negative, little person who's book makes our difficult lives that much sadder.  But the real pity is this kind of cash-grab exploits and weakens legitimate interest and arguments around gmos, wheat and gluten.
B001P06GX4|5.0|Haven't given the kids this game yet, but look forward to playing it with them.  It has been highly recommended to us.  Brilliant delivery service again Amazon.
B0054XOMX4|5.0|Great bey! Japan has outdone themselves in creating the best stamina bey(as of now)! I would definitely recommend to a friend!
B00CRS88IO|5.0|Wow! This is a fast-paced spy novel, filled with a lot of action and intrigue that is sure to excite Bond fans, far and wide. If you’re looking for a fun read that‘ll keep you on the edge of your seat, this is an ideal choice. What a great spy thriller. I haven’t read a book like this in a long time.
B009O07NMA|5.0|My grandsons love this CD. They are 4 and 5 yrs. old and know all the lyrics! It's great to listen to them sing together. We all love Florida Georgia Line!
B005ZB91KY|4.0|Entertaining adventure that keeps you on the edge of your seat once you get past all the slow character development at the beginning.

B006ZZQH4W|5.0|I LOVE MAUVE BINCHY<br />Sorry but cannot give her a bad revue ever!!  lovely Irish gossip.  Really a nice author and book to take on holiday.  Super light read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for candy crush saga to come on Kindle fire I am so happy! I have been dieing for it! Happy playing!
B008Q0D9DG|5.0|Funny even if you're not a baseball fan. Bob Uecker is hilarious as the announcer. This movie is a classic.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great fun you can get  into it anywhere . I am happy it will be on my menu now. Its the devil:)
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This app lets you learn languages really easy. I am learning Spanish and I have learned 25 words in about 5 hours. Easy to memorize and put into practice.
0765337541|4.0|This book overall is very good. Ender is consistently portrayed throughout the book and shows character developement. The book is slightly on the long side, but never really gets boring. The book does get slightly crude at parts, but Orson Scott Card knows how to not go to far.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|Had high expectations, was not disappointed. Best cd I have owned in quite some time, I listen to it every day.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|It is exactly the kind of easily readable and thorough weather app I was looking for; and the moving weather graphics background is a nice touch.
1419705644|5.0|This Encyclopaedia is tops. The pictures are beautiful and the entire book itself is just right up my alley. Love all the little notes from Finn, Jake, and Marceline scattered through-out it.. It's just a great summation of the series in a really funny, awesome, compact book. It has a nice, quality feel to it too.<br /><br />Definitely a great gift for the Adventure Time fiend in your life.
B004W4CK44|5.0|This Soundtrack really brings the atmosphere of Pina shows.<br />If we close the eyes and just listen to the music we can imagine as being inside Tanztheater Wuppertal.<br />All songs are great!!!
1250038820|5.0|Everything you would expect if you're a fan of the blog. I laughed and cried, and love owning it to flip through whenever I have a bad day.
B000ZN802W|5.0|This is a great movie. I read the book years ago and did not realize that they had made a movie about it! Emile Hirsch did a wonderful job depicting Chris, the movie goes along with the book pretty well there are a few differences but none that change the story line or the essence of the book. I was very impressed, its a great movie even if you haven't read the book.
B000JMKNZQ|5.0|Never put the book down...finished in one sitting and ready to read it again!  I live all of Paulo Coelho' s works.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love the idea that I can see all my pins all from my phone. Its easier and cool. I just wish I can put pins from my kindle onto the app. Instead I have to go on the Internet version of this app in order for me to do so.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Filled with great information.  We all need to think about this. Get this. You need to know this !  Read it. Very important.
B00FG1Q5J8|5.0|I'm a little bias because this game is completely up my alley. However the system management and fun mini-games for combat really makes this a skillful game. Probably one of the more indepth ones I've played on a mobile platform that isn't over cluttered with everything you don't want in a game of this nature. Get it... for $2 if you like Sci-Fi and are a fan of FTL or any games like it (heck if your just a star-trek fan) this is totally for you. I don't see how anyone can go wrong with this unless you hate micromanagement.
B00BXKKNFS|5.0|This works. Strike back vs. Google force feeding your mobile screen space. Try it with Firefox for Android. Happy, happy, happy.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I use it daily, mostly for youtube videos but it also works seamlessly with Netflix, Pandora & Hulu. I have used this with a Galaxy S3, Galaxy S4, a dell laptop, Chromebook (Samsung model), a nexus 7 (2013 version) and an iPad. There have been no issues at all with my setup - AT&T U-Verse internet with an average of 15.5 Mbps downstream. Comparing it to my friend's Apple TV, it definitely is more basic and simple with less features but I believe that makes it even better. He always has a few hiccups in the stream using his apple tv and I've only experienced stalls/interruptions twice.<br /><br />It's not perfect but It's so simple and works great. Definitely worth at at this price. $35 at this time.<br />I have since purchased one for my cousin's tv and she says she uses it daily for streaming netflix cartoons for her kids in the morning.
B00ECU1A6C|4.0|Cute story. Good messages about standing up to bullies and friendship. Only gave it four stars because, while the show is geared to the younger kids (5-8 I'd say), this story line jumped straight to early teen. They're in high school, Twilight likes a boy, that kind of thing, that my 7 yr old thought was weird. It's reaching for a new audience but lost what made it unique. Overall it was good, my kid enjoyed it, and the lessons were good, just had them grow up too fast.
B0091THDOM|5.0|The leather is real and the phone fit nice and tight in the case. Good protection if you drop it.
B00ELOOYZI|2.0|My second &#34;FREE APP OF THE DAY!&#34; to try out and it definitely seems like it should be a free app. It's a rocket/puzzler/crafting kind of game that will keep you engaged all of ten minutes if you really bare with it.<br /><br />There's a sort of uncanny valley here with this game's attention to realism in some aspects that clash with the cartoony style.<br /><br />If there's anything really wrong with this app it's that it's too ambitious. I would've settled for a moon lander game where you get to build your own lander, I could've even paid for a game like that and not regretted it.
B003TTKB5I|5.0|I don't know how I missed the boat on this series when it first aired.  Great writing!  Great casting! Great, great story lines!!
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|It makes you feel like solving on paper. Nice app to spend your time with some mind work. The small edit pen makes it feel better.
B007FH9GA6|5.0|Man love with Daniel Craig.  Nuff said.  Awesome actor.  The story was a great thriller as well.  I'm glad to see that the trilogy was compiled.
098357670X|5.0|Very good book on how to draw caricatures.Clear instructions and step by step illustrations.Highly recomended.I would highly recomend this book to anyone trying to learn or improve thier caricature skills.
1446249182|5.0|Andy is a great writer! He even makes statistics interesting and fun with his characters and mind stimulating examples. His British humor is to die for. The additional YouTube videos he offers are very helpful.
B0027MJU00|3.0|This is a well-written novel with a slow-paced storyline.  The characters are well developed; I actually liked them all by the end.  Gillian Flynn made a whole storyline out of 24 hours.  Like all of her books, you won't regret reading this novel.  Very entertaining, but slower paced than \\"Gone Girl\\" or \\"Sharp Objects.\\"
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Too much unnecessary dialogue and story not pertinent to the main story.  It was boring to read, I found myself just skipping through chapters to find the meat of the book.
B009K916ZK|5.0|This was just what I needed.  Great product!  I was very satisfied with my purchase.  Would order this again.  Great!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I'm biased to like Grishman and this one didn't disappoint me. Keeps you guessing the whole way and wanting to know what's next.  Not his best ever, but I enjoyed it from start to finish.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I enjoyed every page of this book.  I would recommend to anyone.  The story of the suffering of the Germans and the Jews was remarkably told.  Will definitely want to see the movie as soon as it comes to the theatre.
B005SHTXN0|5.0|Excellent movie... I'm a excellent driver.. 32 Haines.. I wear boxers.. 400 oak St K mart .. Cincinnati.. These are too tight..
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I laughed, I cried, I yelled, I made assumptions, I argued with the characters, then I laughed and cried some more!  This book took me on an emotional roller coaster, the ups, downs, sideways, inside outs, and backwards kept me obsessively flipping through page after page, unable to set this book down!  I felt every emotion the characters did, and put myself in the middle of their arguments!  This book brought me to the insanely cool, albeit destructive world of dystopian Chicago!  Now I just have one question.  \\"What happens next?\\"<br /><br />I was angry at Veronica Roth for the death of our beloved Tris at first, but from the moment Caleb volunteered to die, I knew she'd never let him.  Tris is so absolutely mesmerizing, she captured me from the moment I read the first word of Divergent.  With Tobias by her side, I knew they were capable of anything!<br /><br />This book and entire trilogy was absolutely amazing!  Excellent Veronica Roth!  Just absolutely outstanding!<br /><br />I wish the best for you and all your future endeavors!  I'll be waiting for more of your books to read!<br /><br /> Xoxo, a hopeful 16 year old future writer.  Oh and remember: Be brave.
B00EYE0ECW|2.0|seems functional but start screen is blurred and requires you to press the Start Here button. Default location is India.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush is very funny and addicting but it makes me very angry how I can be stuck on one level for dam near a whole week because candy crush wants to cheat. Candy crush will wait til you have one jelly left and 17moves left and it happens to be an orange candy in the jelly and out of 17 moves I can't get a orange candy near my jelly to bust it. Smh.
B000FC0V3E|2.0|Every character is a drunk. Spoiled rich people drink and go to fiesta. At least the bullfighting and trout fishing were entertainment.
B00BPDR3F6|1.0|I really, really hated the book. It is boring, nothing more tan a checklist of places that a Young thief visited around the World. What happened with the zest, the fun and the great way of writing a book that E. Gilbert showed in Eat, Pray, Love?<br />I should've guess it. Her previous book Commited was also boring and tiresome to read.<br />Makes me wonder if she ever wrote Eat, Pray, Love or somebody else did it for her.
B000P407K4|5.0|I always lose it at bodily fluids. First time I watched it, it took me 45 minutes to find it funny. A genius movie. Mein Fuehrer! I can walk!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great plot. I loved the ending. I downloaded the book to my iPhone while sailing offshore from Hilton Head, SC,  to New Smyrna Beach,Fl, and could hardly put it down for the whole trip.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Good movie, sometimes things happen on the fast side and a little hard to keep up with.  a couple times, audio goes down very low<br />and you lose what they are saying.  Lots of action.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I am in love with this show.  I'm sorry I didn't start watching it when it first aired on television, but I'm catching up!
B00F880BWG|5.0|Suspense, great actors, special effects, story line - love it! I am unable to afford upgrading my satellite dish to $60 per month to get AMC. With Amazon and $2.99 per episode for The Walking Dead in HD I can be current and save a ton of money on my favorite TV shows.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I had it working in about 5 minutes. Read the directions before you plug it in. I bought a few for Christmas gifts!
B001BANK32|5.0|I loved the movie and now all these years later - I'm ready the book (again).  Of course the book is better than the movie - it always it!  So glad to be able to purchase this &#34;classic&#34; on Amazon for my Kindle Fire....
B00C8S9VKM|4.0|I'm a history buff but I learned all sorts of fascinating trivia while reading this book. There isn't really a story line, but a collection of themes(Lindbergh's flight and tour of America, some sensational crimes, Babe Ruth's home run record, an epic flood in the MIssissippi Valley, Coolidge's decision not to run in 1928) that the author uses as an excuse for rabbit trails aplenty. Really enjoyed the rabbit trails as well as the main stories. I couldn't stop reading snippets to anyone in earshot!
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|It's fine except it deletes things I wanted to keep. Please fix that. I like that you can pick the type of notebook and how many pages are in it and lined paper or white paper. It's so cool! It's the perfect starter to a diary app. Honestly.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This compelling story has spoken to me about how incredibly important it is to live one's life through commitment, humility, unwavering determination and a relationship with G-d.  The author has brought to life one of the most tragic and yet loving stories anyone could read, no matter your profession or standing in life. I am blessed to have read this story...
0385738765|1.0|Hardly any questions answered, the majority of the book was just filler so the author could create a trilogy.  Loved the first book but it should have ended there!
B00ECU2RGY|2.0|Great special effects but story line is lame. Ending is a take off from Star Wars &#34;Death Star&#34; Ending. Plot is confusing.
B00CFA222M|4.0|Fun movie.  So much fun, I had to buy a copy for my video collection.<br />Storyline also has a nice twist from the original.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Challenging, but still fun to play.  Replaying to beat your last time is challenging also.  Definitely not boring, in fact it's very addictive!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Had a hard time putting it down once I got into it.  The ending was a surprise. You will enjoy reading the book.
B003RUZKC8|5.0|The Losers is &#34;The A-Team&#34; sans the prefrontal lobotomy! My only concern is that this film, while great, seems missing a scene (or more?); Chris Evans character's tongue-in-check remark that he &#34;wouldn't mind getting shot again&#34; is nowhere in evidence.....
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This book is valuable for Christians and others as well because it never addresses the issue of Jesus as God. Instead it attempts to chronicle the 30 year life of this Jewish  man born in Roman occupied Palestine from birth to Crucifixion.  It does this using the detailed records the Romans kept of their property (which Jesus was) and taxes which he would be obligated to pay. In addition, ii uses the context of the ordinary Jews who only followed God's law and refused to accept Roman rule and the ruling Jews (the Pharisees) who were glad to cooperate with the Romans. These ordinary Jews believed that the end of the world had come and the promised Messiah was at hand so Jerusalem was literally crawling with Messiah claimants. However, the most informative part of this book is their use of the New Testament  Gospels as a historical source to show how the story of Jesus'  life is modified in these Gospels as time goes on to become the story of his life especially after the Romans destroy the Temple and the death of Jesus' brother James who headed the church in Jerusalem after his death and the ascension of Saul/Paul to leadership in Rome.
B00BEIYN3M|3.0|We're The Millers is about a guy who creates a fake family, so he can easily smuggle drugs across the border. By the end of the movie the fake family, becomes more like a real family who care about each other.<br /><br />I liked the movie. There were a lot of funny parts. The haircut scene, and \\"No Ragrets\\" were the funniest.<br /><br />However there were parts that really me sad and uncomfortable. Like that whole scene involving Kenny, and him never kissing a girl. I felt it went on too long, and I didn't like he was portrayed in movie. They made him look like a loser, and it really upset me. I don't like watching movies that upset me. And I certainly do not expect a comedy to be upsetting. So I have to knock off two stars for that.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's a well written movie. I can't say that it was a good time at the movies, because it upset me. But We're The Millers is good overall, and you will probably enjoy it.
B004P98QZ8|5.0|My grandson loved it. All the other toys went by the wayside on Christmas and he spent the afternoon putting it together.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Hooked on this one, but don't like the bombs and the chocolate blocks, and need more free moves per turn.
B0016CQCMQ|5.0|If there is a true musical artist that is transcendent in this generation, it's Jack White.  The Racoteurs just adds another facet to his remarkable body of work by creating a band with the most talented musicians he could find; his friends, Brendan Benson, Jack Lawerence and Patrick Keeler.  The Raconteurs grew organically from like-minded, creative artists who enjoy each other's company.  They are one of the best bands and, hopefully, will be producing music for many years to come.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|can you escape was a fun but diffucult game it definitely extended my knolge a lot ithought it might be a boring game but its not it is spectaular game<br />  love<br />  gamer
B0016OMFO8|5.0|The first being the Traveling Wilburys with Roy Orbison.  These four talents combined to make a rad gumbo of goodness.  Yes, they were diminished by the death of Obison but they still pressed on to make a hugely satisfying album of great music.  This music is further proof that George Harrison was the greatest Beatle of all.
B00DB2JQ7W|5.0|Unique format of all the pieces being performed by guest artists, plus originals, makes this more a joyful listening experience
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|this movie was awesome!  great job by father and son.  i will own this movie.  great suspense, char building, and story line.
B009JBZH54|3.0|i like the batman movies all together. they are best batmans i have seen. one problem the first batman begins won't play on my blue ray player. don't know what problem is with the blue player or the disc

B0060MYM7O|5.0|I love the game of thrones and it is the best tv show i ever seen.  I can't wait for the next to come out
B000006NUW|4.0|Great sounds! It was the best compilation of Motown music I have ever heard.It brings back the sounds of the<br />Baby Boomer generation!
B0001I561E|1.0|Was so excited to find Aladdin for my sons birthday present. Saw that there were only two in stock so I ordered it a few weeks before his big day. Although it was a new DVD it skips and the sound was messed up. Amazingly the money back guarantee was for 48 hours so I paid a ridiculous amount of money for nothing.
B00DWFQ2N4|5.0|While everything about this album is amazing from production to vocals (jt and timbo hammered it out of the park again) and being a complete departure from the first half, I still have not received my copy yet :/ all albums ive purchased have arrived within 2 weeks and it has been 5 weeks since i placed the order now and still no sign of the album showing up! Really disappointed with amazons shipping methods! :(
0767836324|5.0|Hook, never gets old, and I never get past it without a tear.  And, I got it was a great price through Amazon (finally upgraded from VHS to DVD!).
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great John Grisham!!!!  Not the powerful ending like A Time To Kill but powerful with Jake & friends. Good to hear from them again!!
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Very good movie! I like the angle, and the morbidity, of this zombie movie. The special effects are, in general, very good and very realistic.
B0031RS4UM|2.0|First person deductive reasoner becomes second person thug.  I was disappointed. But not as much as when I read book 3.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|finally on kindle fire. thanks. wishing maybe not so long of a wait.when you.have no more lives. especially on facebook you can be stuck for weeks than it isn't fun anymore and you begin to loose interest.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Omg this is the best.  I use to have my daughters wii to use for Netflix but it would always go down, no with this chrome cast I just plug it in its set to my wii fi & I can watch Netflix & utube with no problems, plus it doesn't use a lot of battery time off my iPad, or my iPhone 4, I just plug it in turn on what to watch & turn off the screen to my apple products & watch anything!  Rating is ten out of ten for this chrome cast for me.  I also tried the white plug to plug my iPad to my tv but that eats up too much battery while ur watching Netflix save yourself twenty bucks don't get the white plugs, get the chrome cast it works really good!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I felt the author did a wonderful job at giving a new perspective on pediatric cancer and the journey associated with it. Much like Hazel and he favorite story, I was not ready for this one to end.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|Excellent acting and story. Very good makeup for the zombies. First movie ever where you could take them out with small arms. Ha ha
B00BMTX5IW|5.0|I heard this cd for the first time while visiting Blowing Rock, NC.  I was going in all the little shops and this cd was playing in the background.  Just fell in love with it and within a week, bought the next cd.  She is so talented!  My husband and I have been enjoying her cd's almost non-stop since we purchased them.  Highly recommend!
B0035LJY6C|5.0|Great writing, quirky characters, and simple yet charming plot. All of the actors and actresses portrayed their characters well, and the line delivery was excellent. The Addams family is different, but really displays how a family should bond together--an old but classic family film!
B009XI7RF6|1.0|It was fun until got through the first two levels where it is locked until you pay. Starting to think&quot;free apps&quot; are junk<br />Lame
B001FB55LC|5.0|The design is OMG!! I love the brightness/color! The price and availability of the product is amazing!! A must buy!
0896898288|5.0|Love the book, bought it awhile ago, can't remember details on buying it or having it shipped but the price was great as I remember and have really enjoyed the book.
B003IY48PS|4.0|This movie is pretty good. I love old b rated horror movies. I thought that for sam raimi's first movie that he did a pretty good job. the remake is better than the original. I do think that the original was pretty good. and that bruce Campbell did a great job. this is surely a cult classic I will tell you that. hope the next two are just as good or better. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Awesome game. I would recommend it fir hunters and non hunters alike. I can't wait for the next content patch.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game. Takes your mind of things and does get harder and more difficult. It's well designed. It's great fun
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|I went into this film with little expectations. The trailer looked great, but it ended up being so full of itself. All style and no substance. The premise and cast are amazing, but it just comes through contrived.<br /><br />The twist at the end was the only redeeming point.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The wait in between games can be frustrating.  Also on my kindle the sound button does not work so I cannot use it on there.  CANNOT STAND ALL THE NOISE!!!!!!!!  However I have in in my iodine and iPad and am soooooooooo addicted.
B005HEDI3K|5.0|Star TOS is looking pretty good here.  My favorite is watching the BD in 1080p!  It is nice to have Star Trek on Amazon Prime.
B00005NB8K|5.0|For all those music fans or The Door in specific, this is a summary of a guy that blew up peoples mind on stage, including his later on. Crazy, adventurous, sexual, all at once like those 70's really were.<br /><br />Adults only, not even teenagers..lots of sexual situation an drugs additions.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|It is a pity for such a great film that no-one has taken the effort to add any extras to this DVD,<br />to someone out there  PLEASE DO IT NOW BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE  Audrey and Peter are gone is there anyone left to interview ?????? at least add scene selection or the cinema preview .... something, why has this film been forgotten ??????
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|figuring out to solve each puzzle is very exciting.  Even if I get stuck for a while I keep coming back until I get it done. Fun love it
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|It was a great read, but more for youth than adults.  The book is great for ages 15-20 I would think.
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|I had seen Michael's documentary and the book reflects this very well. I refer to it constantly as a reminder, a motivational tool and for calorie information. For me the 'diet' is not about losing weight but a life style choice which in the long term will help prevent the diabetes, hereditary in my family and the dementia which my husband has developed at a very early age. How well, time will tell.
B00DXP7L88|1.0|***This review contains spoilers which I suggest you read instead of actually purchasing this season. You're welcome.***<br /><br />Although I have ordered this for my parents who do not have Showtime, I would not order this for myself. I believe that any loyal Dexter fan would (and should) pass on this season so as not to spoil your opinion of the whole series. I wish I had.<br /><br />Where we came from: I believe that Season 7 ended the way that the series should have ended. It left enough to the imagination to be intriguing, yet tied up enough loose ends to provide closure. Season 7 also had the same consistent, quality writing and pace that we had expected from Dexter since the start. All the seasons previous, especially the season with John Lithgow, were exceptional.<br /><br />Where it went: Instead, the endless stream of producers listed in the opening credits got greedy and created Season 8. Character development was not as good as before. A new character was introduced: Masuka's daughter. The writers must have run out of innuendos to write for him and instead gave him a daughter to explain his sudden turnaround brought on by lack of creative writing while providing the excuse of Character Development. It was just filler. They could have written him out of the season or killed him off and it wouldn't have lost anything.<br /><br />There was also more talk than action once we meet the doctor who persuaded Harry to let Dexter \\"do his thing\\" as well as Dexter's heir-apparent. The pursuit of the doc's son (The Brain Surgeon) was similar to the classic Dexter but with too many people \\"in on the secret\\" the show's magic was gone. The further the season went, the more of a stretch it became, until the last episodes where it just got ridiculous and - quite frankly - predictable.<br /><br />The magic also failed the show when Hannah returned. We all knew it was coming, we just didn't know when. At first, there was the same hostility between Deb and Hannah but she (Deb) seemed to end up liking Hannah. Hannah made Dexter go all soft on us which was a complete change from the reasons I watched the show. Tension and suspense are key to this type of show, not lovestruck sympathizers. I realize the need for character development and improvement and morality but that takes a back seat to action, which is why everyone watches the show!<br /><br />The decision to kill off Deb at the end of the show, shot by the Brain Surgeon and, after her death, taken from the hospital by Dexter to be dumped in the ocean as the hurricane approached, was not a great way to go. Quite implausible that no one would have noticed this. Neither was Hannah and Harrison, pursued by inept bounty hunters, ending up in Argentina endlessly waiting for Dexter who would never get there. More ridiculous choices made by the producers and writers to tie up story lines that didn't need it. There is the possibility that these should be emotional scenes but they do not come across this way.<br /><br />I could go on and on listing interactions and plot devices that added nothing to the show. Leaving all these out would have left us without a Season 8, which is my whole point.<br /><br />Overall I think the producers and writers tried too hard to fill the episodes that Showtime purchaed. They tried to incorporate everything into this series finale. They tried to cash in on the amazing success of the previous seasons. They tried to go over the top in the finale and instead upset their loyal fans.<br /><br />If you want to know how an incredible series should end CORRECTLY, watch Breaking Bad instead.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like this Bible that I can just listen to. It help me to understand it better. I can ride my bike to excuse.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game, interesting, fun, challenging, sensational .We all know candy crush is a great game. for everyone, but all I know is adults playing it. even my mother of 80 years is playing it, and loves it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game hard to stop playing would be nice if you could just purchase the game. The cost to buy extra lives is a little pricey
B000NDMRCS|5.0|I personally enjoy technical sci-fi type thrillers! This one was very well done; far fetched but yet believable. The actors were excellent in their roles, and the cimetography and special effects were well done.
B00F2362IE|5.0|I bought this for my 9 year old son and he loves it every single time he gets his free time he goes straight towards the game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love , love, love this game. Like the challenge of the higher numbers are harder to play and find it interesting fun
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|It was a good book with characters you can identify with; good life lesson for the reader and a clever ending.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I like to know how much time I have left before a charge is needed. I don't know yet how accurate it is, but it is a guideline.
B00G32OER4|5.0|it's genuine in its' creepiness. It's one of the scariest movies I have seen in quite a while.<br />Rates up there with the Exorcist.
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|I you like movies were nothing happens and the trailer was about the only good thing about it<br />...this is for you!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am a huge fan of both despicable me movies. When I found out about this game I was so eager to try it out!  This game is very fun and addicting. If you love those little yellow monsters like me, I totally think this is a game for you!!
B0087IT8LO|5.0|Lighthearted, funny, entertaining. Everything you'd want from a film like this. It's not supposed to make a new man/woman out of you. The film merely seeks to expose the joys and pains of a very likable relationship.
B002RI9VVM|5.0|Brilliantly written, not one spare word. The characters unfolded in this great classic novelette were completely believable and so skillfully revealed. Ranks in the top 5 ever read
B002XTXFU8|4.0|I heard/read someone relate this film to &#34;A Clockwork Orange&#34; before I bought it. While I primarily bought the movie out of my love for Tom Hardy and his impeccable ability to act, I was also intrigued by one's comparison of the this film with one of Kubrick's greats. Ultimately, &#34;Bronson&#34; is a hilariously lighthearted film adaptation of Charlie Bronson's laughably rebellious life/lifestyle. I don't laugh at his outcome but at his fearlessly enduring attitude towards his own. The greatest difference between the two movies is that Clockwork Orange had more of a statement to make on our society and culture while Bronson is, believe it or not, much more ambiguous in its nature and is loose biography at the end of the day. If you watch this movie with a light heart, a good mindset, and an appetite for entertaining vulgarity, you'll enjoy it. . .
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I had been waiting for the Kindle game app and was not disappointed! No problems loading/playing and I especially like playing on a larger screen vs. my phone.
B00080Z53O|3.0|I love Javier Bardem (that's why I bought the movie), but this movie, in general, doesn't require your attention to understand it. You can be doing a dozen other things while watching it and still walk away understanding most, if not all, of the plot points, dialogues, events, etc. It's a good film with an interesting topic. I desired a greater journey on the topic of Euthanasia but all I seem to have gotten were character based opinions, and not the strong ones that have us floored in admiration.
B001NA6096|2.0|BeNot as good I thought i. Fairly goodt be great with having three films to it.  Actors are ok. Fairly good love story.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|Truly one of the GREATEST movies I've ever witnessed. It was an honest pleasure being able to see this flawless film. It lead me through every imaginable emotion. At moments, you can expect to cry, laugh, smile, disgust, etc. If you have the funds and are looking for a film worth spending them on, look no further as this WILL make it on your &#34;Favorite Films&#34; list. . . Guaranteed. . .
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I haven't cried about a book like this in a long time I definitely recommend it to anyone who is alive it's really one of those books that make you question life, love, and suffering... It puts you right with the character and just wow.<br /><br />Read it, seriously.
B004EQAVFU|4.0|I bought this movie after seeing its moving trailer and watching Andrew Garfield shriek in emotional anguish a while back. Ultimately, for once, the movie actually did maintain the set mood from the trailer and all the actors/actresses were amazing. Carey Mulligan and Andrew Garfield were particularly, ridiculously good in the movie as they both had me believing every ounce of their characters. I have never witnessed such a display of acting ability than in Garfield when he lets go and releases that yell. I mean, wow. Absolutely great work. You WILL be able to relate to him when you see him in the scene I'm referring to. I give it 4/5 instead 5/5 only because the movie didn't require my undivided attention as a few scenes seemed to drag just enough to call it &#34;imperfect&#34; (or just shy from being that 5 star film we all love) Still, it's worth every penny.
B005J9ZDYK|5.0|My 7 yr old granddaughter loved this.  Grandma and Grandpa had a chance to look at it with her.  We laughed a lot.  It is a great video.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|I saw this on FX maybe a year or two ago (a time before I could really appreciate it) and decided to buy it after being reminded of it. After watching it again, I was floored by just how great this movie is. It is everything that will please the most haughty critic to the humble blockbuster seeker. Those of us who seek a greater &#34;meaning&#34; in our films will find one in this story of literal &#34;illegal aliens&#34; and those who just enjoy watching crazy, well-made action sequences for shock value will find plenty to hold on to as well.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I had been waiting for Candy Crush Saga to be made for Kindle, and am so happy that it finally is. Very pleased.
B004ZG5F3M|2.0|Movie had a sturdy, somewhat interesting beginning but ultimately never got anywhere for me. Just plateaued after a point, leaving me wondering why I didn't just stream it as opposed to buying it in full. Don't get tricked into buying it JUST because it's on sale.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I love magic the gathering, and I love this game it is so much fun, it is well worth the ten dollars to get the full version, lots of fun, keep up the good work
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game!!!!! I started playing this game ever since I saw my mother and sister play it. I thought to myself what am i missing, Well i found out how much fun this game is.
B00AEBB932|5.0|A super, legendary western!  One of Alan Ladd's greatest performances!  Should be seen over and over again! Never a disappointing moment!
0385045913|5.0|If you are a true enthusiastic fan of the great fiction detective Sherlock Holmes, you probably all ready have this amazing two giant volume set of all the Sherlock Holmes stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  The complete edition was \\"originally published in nine separate books containing thirteen hundred pages of the best detection fiction in English literature.\\"  This two volume set has a total of 1602 pages.  I thought I had read every Sherlock Holmes story over the years; however, after picking up this incredible two volume set I realized I had not read more than half of his many short stories.<br /><br />Volume one covers the following:  A study in Scarlet(A novel), The sign Four (A novel), The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (Twelve short stories), and Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes (Eleven short stories).  The second volume contains the following: The Return of Sherlock Holmes (Thirteen short stories), The Hound of the Baskervilles (Probably his most well-known Sherlock Holmes novel), The Valley of Fear (A novel), His Last Show (Eight short stories), and The case book of Sherlock Holmes (Twelve short stories).<br /><br />In conclusion, if you are a fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories, this wonderful two volume set should be in your personal library.  I was overjoyed discovering and reading this two volume set of Sherlock Holmes. My one and only complaint, which is due to my age I am sure, is the small font is sometimes difficult to read.  Nevertheless, this does not take away from the value of this set.<br /><br />Rating:  5 Stars.  Joseph J. Truncale  (Author:  The Samurai Soul: An old warrior's poetic tribute)
B00D2I8E46|5.0|Awesome collaboration.  Sometimes reminiscent of legendary groups from the past, sometimes a totally new creation, this in an album that will be around for many years.
B008476HBM|2.0|The story of this book is well known, and I began to read it with this in mind. I hoped it was an enjoyable read although a bit futile.<br />I didn't count on the dialogues being as boring as they that are ... My God, the dialogues are so insipid and irrelevant ...
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I am so hooked on this series (I have not watched the television program).  Book Three was action packed with many twists and turns leaving me wanting more.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Very nice device. Will give it as a Christmas present. It is a nice addition to a non-smart TV, expanding its viewing capacity.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|great game to play if your board. only down fall is you cant play it very long with out running out of energy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I played this on Facebook but I didn't always want to be on the computer. Now I can play on my kindle
B00742GBDM|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie. The focus was that it was more important to marry for love and character than for money.
B000NY12CI|5.0|WOW. Infidel is truly an amazing, and incredibly thought-provoking book. Ayaan Hirsi Ali defied all odds, coming from a Muslim family in Muslim Somalia and miraculously ending up in Western culture (accompanied with Western ideology). I chose to read this book so I could learn about Islam. I was curious about something I knew nothing about, yet heard about all the time. This was an excellent book to read on the subject. Raised Muslim, Ali is as expert as a person can be. She's very insightful, giving a brutally honest account of what it was like to grow up Muslim. It was interesting to see her religious transformation throughout the book. (She was finally forced to make a decision regarding her religion after 9/11, after years of questioning Islam). It was truly eye-opening. I admire her courage, will, ambition, and most of all, her heart. She is an amazing woman, with a spirit that cannot be broken.<br /><br />I particularly found this analogy very powerful:<br /><br />\\"When I was asked for my opinion, I explained that Islam was like a mental cage. At first, when you open the door, the caged bird stays inside; it is frightened. It has internalized its imprisonment. It takes time for the bird to escape, even after someone has opened the doors to its cage\\" (p. 285).<br /><br />She also draws thought-provoking conclusions based on her observations of how religion affects government and modernization, declaring, \\"Every society that is still in the rigid grip of Islam oppresses women and also lags behind in development. Most of these societies are poor; many are full of conflict and war. Societies that respect the rights of women and their freedom are wealthy and peaceful\\" (p. 296).<br /><br />Of course, these are just excerpts from a very well-written chronicle of Ali's life. I highly, highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone. If religion isn't your thing, there is still MUCH to take away from this book, no doubt.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Great movie, full of action from beginning to the end. One if the best marvel movies to date. Must see
B005WTR4ZI|5.0|Well focused and poignant. An excellent encapsulation of the massive changes taking place because of increase computational power and storage capacity coupled with mobile technologies.
B0015HM60E|5.0|What else but 5 stars for the Masters of the MeloDeath at its best.  The production may not be as good as it is at their later albums, but the raw, true, unspoiled energy is there.
B00EDF43MY|5.0|My daughters loves these games.  I have a 4 year and an 8 year old.  We love dr panda games!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love it. Works great<br />Easy to use to manage. Makes watchimg netflix a breeze. I would recommend to friends
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Reading about the life of the these two inspirational women made me ever so grateful for the peaceful life that I share with my loving husband. It's so easy to get caught up in the day to day mundane details of our lives. A story like this brings us back to the reality of the greater world we all live in together. My greatest wish is for peace and security for all. Thank you for sharing this story. It has changed my life.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I hate that with the mobile app I cannot use my extra moves. I have so many that I can only use when I play the game on the computer. I think I should have the same options no matter which way I play. I know that in some cases I could have won if I had those extra moves.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|---Spoiler Alert!!---<br /><br />While I enjoyed the Divergent series, I was supremely disappointed with the author's decision to kill Tris. Partly because I like stories with happy ending...call me a sap but with all of the dreariness in the world, I like to read something that shows happiness is achieved when people endure to the end; but also because it seemed like a pointless death when viewed from the readers standpoint. Or at least I thought so. I do understand the storyline and that Tris was true to her word that she would never send her brother to his death the way he nearly did, but that didn't mean someone else i.e. one of the secondary characters introduced in Allegiant, could not have arrived at the last minute to either take the bullet or kill David before he got a chance to shoot Tris. She survives a death serum that no one should be able to only to be shot...Really?!?! Couldn't Nita, Reggie, or Matthew have arrived to alter the ending?! Those other characters all had motive, and with a little creative story telling could have had means. Like I stated before, the story was very good, but the ending was very disappointing.<br /><br />I was very let down by the ending, hence my 2 star rating. While I might still recommend this series, I would caution the reader about the ending.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I loved this game when I first dewn loaded it but after the last update it crashes more times than not.<br />&quot;
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|Pretty good. Nothing special about the plot, but action throughout makes it entertaining. All of the slow motion must come from the comic book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's been a while since I stumbled upon a new series, and a new author who really captivated me.  Mr. Howey, I love your books. I read all the books in the series within 1.5 weeks, over several evenings of awesomeness.  They are one of the best, if not the best, post-apocalyptic stories I have ever read.  The writing itself is great, the imagery is awesome, and the descriptions of the relationships between the characters is very real and touching.  Also, it's super entertaining.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|I enjoyed the stories very much but found the style difficult as it jumped from different years without warning. i would also have preferred title chapters as it took time to realise which character was the subject.
B00FVAEKJ6|2.0|I really like the other FlipPix Aps. The objects are way TOO BIG in this one. I prefer the objects to be more &#34;to scale&#34; and these are not.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Great game. Do get it because it's fun. Ya, it takes awhile to recharge the energy when you use it all, but it's not that long.
B006ZWLXZ8|4.0|I really enjoyed this record.  I had only saw her SNL performance and wasn't impressed, but was recommend to give the whole album a listen.  i really really like it.  Reminds of of Julee Cruise and def. has a David Lynch/Twin Peaks vibe.  Her voice is amazing and the songs are beautiful
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I love this series and this book ties it all up for the reader. It's not what I expected but is another mind blowing book full of action, emotion, humor, and depth.
0142410314|5.0|Always a favorite, my 5 year old loved it. It is really hard to beat this book, can't wait to reread the others!
B00DUCXFUC|5.0|Best movies ever. The story told is done in such a way that has never been seen before. No words can describe how good these films are.
1490313370|5.0|Awesome book, a little mix of business, self help and entrepreneurship. James is open and honest about success and more importantly failure.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This is a fun game you can play with others, any time of the day or night. A must download!
B00DS715VA|1.0|I used to get this calendar every year (yes, I work in a cubicle in corporate America) but they NO LONGER get better each year.  Instead I just got the Dilbert App on my phone for free and now I don't miss any Sunday comics.<br /><br />For 2013, 2014: My strike against purchasing this calendar begins. GIVE US BACK OUR SUNDAYS! GIVE US BACK OUR SUNDAYS! GIVE US BACK OUR SUNDAYS!<br /><br />For 2012: BOO-O-O SCOTT ADAMS! Now I am getting pissed. Again, the Sunday strips are missing. This will be my last edition unless Sundays come back. It used to be that I kinda looked forward to stumbling into my cubicle each Monday because I knew--first thing--there would be a couple of days worth of Dilbert to greet me. But that all changed on December 26, 2010 (the last day they printed a Sunday comic in the \\"Day-to-day\\" calendar).<br /><br />For 2011: Wired: full color, cool Dilbert cartoon content. Tired: they combined Saturday and Sunday into one page (only printing the Saturday panel, which in my opinion is the suckiest of all days to read comics; Sunday's the best day) Where are the big beautiful Sunday versions of Dilbert?!@! I hope this decision saved a lot of money, because it really, really blows!
B000I9S69K|5.0|Great movie, definitely worth the purchase. I bought it because it was an assignment. It was a very nice movie.
B000XKZQ74|5.0|I love this movie. If you enjoy foreign films and do not mind reading its sub titles then you should adjust well when watching this movie. The quality of the picture is great. Loading went well. There was nothing wrong with audio. No interruptions. I was able to watch this movie twice and pause for 10 minute durations throughout the movie.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|So-so movie with faulty logic and holes in the plot.<br />Not worth more than a $0.99 rental fee and not worth buying.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Loving this book! Elizabeth Gilbert at her best! Hard to put down as her character development oils super.i hope you enjoy this as much as I am.
B008NMT684|1.0|Only four puzzles but we couldn't unlock the additional ones. Might be ok if we could unlock all the other puzzles.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Great device, easy to install and easy to use. There are only two minor issues: too few apps supporting it (basically youtube and netflix so far) and sometimes it's keeps playing videos after you try to stop them on your phone or laptop.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Great book. I finished it in one day. I can't wait  to buy the next book in this great series.
B004P1JDJO|5.0|I had come across some of the messages in this book a few years ago when I had just one or two years of experience, and I thought it was kind of interesting but nothing more. Now, 6 years after my first job it makes a lot more sense. I'd recommend this book to anyone in the corporate world between the early 30s and late 50s, to understand what motivation is about, no matter if you're trying to motivate yourself or your team.<br />Personally, I'd stick to the first part of the book, which contains ideas and concepts. The second part, focused on recipes and practical recommendations is not very interesting to read, but I think it might work as reference material if you want to incorporate some of the ideas into your work environment.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Excellent read, interesting & full of fascinating personalities. Lots of detail, yet not overloaded with minutiae. Good for history buffs or general readers.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|There are so many different editing options with this app. Simple to use, so it is easy to navigate around. I love it!
B00ECR7KX2|5.0|It's amazing!  make sure that you know the story before you watch; much like any great play, you will get more out of it if you know what is going on and can follow fluently!
B00BXLU1EU|4.0|Product works good if you are trying to hack into a router for your connection. But, if the security is a web base sign in i.e. user-name and password then forget it. it will not work.
B004K7HMJ6|4.0|She is amazing; the quality and production is lovely.  I did not appreciate the every other song with the f-bomb.  She is too talented to need that.
B00EY7LT9Q|5.0|I really like this show. I sometimes have to watch each show several times to get the full plot. I am still wondering who's side Sky is on
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|I saw Daniel speak last week in New Orleans and he was very compelling. I bought his book and read it over the next 5 days. It is a engaging work on the history and transformation of selling research to back it up. Like other readers, I found this work very easy to read impeccably researched and easy to apply to my day job, which includes :moving people. I highly recommend this book as the must read of the year.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|You have a great app. l love the game. Keep up the great job. I cannot put the game down when I play.

B00EY7MFKS|5.0|Fun and original; I applaud marvel for this and look forward to every new episode. I wish Amazon was more diligent making the episodes available with my season pass.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I lovvvvvve this series so muchhhhh I'm so sad I've finished it. Veronica Roth is the best author in the history of the world.
B00ET0PZDO|5.0|Just fun for a bunch of us to play.... Each person takes a room, if u can't get it, you pass to another. Really a fun and challenging for all! Worth the time.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|its really fun and I got all the characters besides one rainbow dash and so then it broke down and didn't work at all which was annoying coz I was on level 51
B00GBQI0M2|5.0|\\"The Making of Marea\\" by Scarlette D'Noire is a short story that describes a \\"making\\" of a vampire. Sounds like we've read this before, right? Well, here's the thing: as long as these stories are freshly told, have unexpected plot twists, and craftfully written, we'll be chasing the high again and again.<br /><br />The story is set in a plantation, where Marea, an ex-slave girl, is an object of desire of both the Master, and Delano, the vampire. Delano turns Marea, hoping to bind her to him. Sounds simple, but it isn't. Marea is not a \\"simple\\" girl, not a plaything to those who have more power.<br /><br />Read on to find some nice plot twists and get yourself surprised. A very neatly constructed story set in the vampire lore.

Maybe I am missing something but what a rip off. I should have just got the DVD.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Great show! 5 stars forever! I am ready for the next! I wish amazons video section would give more information on the videos though. I do not know if buying a season pass would recharge me for the episodes already bought AND there is absolutely NO contact information for questions.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book by Stephen King.  I was an early fan of his books but sort of got lost when he went so weird!  Now I'm back and he seems to have returned to characters you can care about and that are not so frightening you don't want to read the rest of the book!  His characters are much more believable when they're like your next door neighbor -- just a little quirky!

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I don't appreciate kindle requiring me to review this book before I can continue my reading. Reviews should be optional. If this continues, you can count me out as  a Kindle customer.
B00E9P959O|5.0|I am not an audiophile who can tell what hand the recording studio sound technician used when he mixed the album. However, I think this gives me some strength as a reviewer since I am seeking what the average listener seeks.<br /><br />Vapor Trails is one of my favorite albums; if I were listening to the CD I would have worn it out by now. The album was not perfect, but certainly an important development in Rush's discography.<br /><br />Vapor Trails Remixed is better. The original album contained a \\"wall of sound\\" approach which tended to  hold it back. Even if you liked Rush cranked up, there was a certain muddle to the album. The remixed version dials back that auditory assault and cleans it up. There is \\"space\\" inbetween the various elements that adds a cleaner, somewhat more spare sound to the album. Rush sounds more classically Rush. The Power Trio's individual contributions stand out more on their own.<br /><br />The songs you liked a lot, you will like more; the songs you sort of liked, you will like a little more.
B00DZPVS9O|5.0|I think this album is killer.  Their best in years.  Find your happy place and zone out to this beautifully produced album.
B000HL2J0G|4.0|Very entertaining. Brought back wonderful memories of when I used to watch the series live. Quality of video is very good.
B007HACDLK|5.0|As usual, Vince has dine an amazing job. He will be greatly missed. Thank you for giving us Mitch Rapp!!
B003G4W49C|4.0|A painful glimpse of war, hegemony, and love as seen through a child's eyes, Ender's Game is told with the voice of an extraordinary adult, but with the honesty of a child, culminating in a unique, but very true view of evil, goodness, and duty, and how all three are found in us all to unique ends.
B00F9040HU|5.0|Trying to get to the next levels. This game is intriguing, challenging, and addictive.  It's had me up late nights.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Now I'm not much of a Stephen King fan, but every once in awhile he'll release novels that'll attract my attention Cell, Under The Dome and now Doctor Sleep. When I found out that this is the sequel to the Shining I knew I had to get it and this novel was amazing. I have to admit though it kinda started out slow slow to the point I wasn't gonna read it, but I'm glad I kept with it.<br /> this was an amazing read and if tour a fan of the Shining then you should definitely read this.
0988178532|5.0|Frankly, I am usually not a paranormal kind of person; that genre seems to go in one ear and out the other.  Imagine my surprise when I started reading Brandt Legg's Outview and was totally hooked from beginning to end!<br />I am, however, a sucker for great characters I can relate to, and this author certainly does not disappoint.  Enter Nate, a teenager experiencing repeatedly violent visions/dreams and worrying he's going insane. Added to the mix is a beloved dead father, a distant mother, a brother who's been committed to a mental institution, two Vietnamese-born best friends, and a fatherly neighbor, Sam.  Totally believable and, in the case of his best friends, extremely likeable, this cast instantly helps draw the reader into Nate's life.  More and more, Nate discovers that not only is he not insane, he actually possesses mystical powers. Now, normally, this is the point where I would jump off, but not so in this book, because the way these Buddhist-like, reincarnation-oriented powers are explained and demonstrated is totally authentic and plausible.  Now, that takes talent!<br />In short, this book grabbed me--Legg's beautiful, movie-like descriptions of different time-traveling, portal-based lands were wonderful; his philosophical take on the evils of corporate and political greed and power, riveting and spot-on, and his basic storytelling outstanding.  A true, 5 star recommended read!<br /><br />S. R. Mallery, author
B00GD9F59S|5.0|When I first began reading the Covenant series I could only give it a mildly positive review because it seemed to be ripped directly from the Vampire Academy series. It was uncanny. Still, I recognized a talent to Jennifer Armentrout's writing that convinced me to stick with her and see where this series would go ... and what a wonderful journey it has been! After that opening book with the similarities to the VA book, this story became its own, and I have grown to love this series. It is my favorite of all of Jen's book series. And now we have arrived at the final chapter in this great paranormal series. I am super satisfied with the way this played out, but a little sad that it is over.<br /><br />For this final book in the Covenant series Alex finds herself completely broken after her disastrous encounter with Ares at the end of the last book. She is horribly scarred both physically and mentally. And yet she can't stop working to find a way to stop Ares and his master plan to take over the world. Seth seemed to be working for Ares, but I always, ALWAYS knew that he would come back to help Alex. I always believed in his innate goodness, even when his every action seemed to point otherwise. Hooray for the way this plays out in this story! Very well plotted! With a sort-of ragtag team of fighters, Alex and Aiden set out to try and save the world. It isn't pretty. There is heartache and danger and difficulty all along the way, but it was a great story to enjoy for the weekend.<br /><br />What I liked:<br /><br />Alex. She is in one heck of a mess. Her situation is horribly dire, and none of her choices seem to be desirable at all. But she plugs on. She fights. And I love the fight in this character. She is tough, but she doesn't face her trials without emotion. She is scared. She can be hopeless at times. She can be a bit selfish. She seems real, and I appreciated her strength as well as her weaknesses in this story.<br /><br />Aiden. I have been Team Aiden from the very beginning. I adore him and all the sweet words he has for Alex. I love the strength that he offers Alex at all times. He is strong and talented and fierce in battle. True, he is probably a bit too stereotypically awesome, but I don't mind. I love this character!<br /><br />Seth. Sure, I said I was Team Aiden, but I can deny that Seth may be my favorite character of this entire series. He is just so interesting because of the many contrasts in his character. He can be so self-centered and egotistical, and yet he can make some amazingly altruistic decisions that warm your heart. I can feel the love he has for Alex, even when he is making goofy side remarks or seemingly poor decisions. His love for Alex will come through with shining colors in this story. I want to know so much more about him. And doesn't it seem as if the ending to this story might leave the door open for a Seth spin-off series? I really, really hope so. That would be a major treat.<br /><br />Apollo. Total awesomeness. I loved him when he was Leon. I love him now. The best Greek god of this series.<br /><br />The actual story. This book is full of plenty of tender moments sandwiched in between humor and dangerous action. Ares made a great villain even though he was not present for much of the story. The choice to unleash the Titan Perses made for an interesting story line since he wasn't all that great of a person/Titan/god. But they needed him, and that need outweighed the bad ... at least most of the time. Aiden, Alex, and Seth all have to make some tough choices that required them to sacrifice in order to serve a greater good. Overall it made for an enjoyable end to the entire series.<br /><br />The Happily Ever After. This story wraps up super conveniently. Everything works out wonderfully for Alex and Aiden and the world. Sure, there will be lots of people out there who might not like the convenience of it, but I'm not one of them. I appreciated it. After reading five books and two novellasof constant danger and difficulties for Alex and Aiden I felt like I deserved to read a HEA for them. I loved it. And I really liked the last line. It just left me with a happy smile, and that is always good.<br /><br />Overall this was a great ending to the Covenant series. I am glad I stuck around to see how everything played out. Five stars!of constant danger and difficulties for Alex and Aiden I felt like I deserved to read a HEA for them. I loved it. And I really liked the last line. It just left me with a happy smile, and that is always good.<br /><br />Overall this was a great ending to the Covenant series. I am glad I stuck around to see how everything played out. Five stars!
B000FC0OOU|2.0|This book reminded me of a soap opera. I could skip pages, wander back in and never miss a thing. Dialog sounded like conversations between a bunch of drunks.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is challenging....that is why I love it! I have it on my Android, then I have it on my Kindle Fire.  The times are off so I always have extra lives....Perfect!
B0040I09RM|5.0|Gotta love outlaw justice.  Just finished Season one (in one day) - cant wait to watch the remaining series - Im hooked!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|The second book was awesome but book 1&3 was not good.  She should have neeed with book 2.  No ending on this book:(
B00FX8EY60|5.0|I love this addicting album. There's a lot that Katy offers including modern pop tunes, 90's and 80's influences, and many heart filled ballads.<br /><br />Roar 2/5 Never been a fan, and it's one of the tracks I skip on the album. Too bubblegum pop for my taste, but kids seem to love it.<br />Legendary Lovers 5/5 One of the album's highlights and I hope it becomes a single. It has hit written all over it.<br />Birthday 4/5 Nice fun tune. Sounds like Madonna's \\"Holiday.\\"<br />Walking On Air 5/5 Probably one of my favorite songs of Katy's. It sounds like a radio hit from 1992. Best song on the album.<br />Unconditionally 3/5 The worst ballad on the album and I'm surprised she chose this as the second single. She's releasing all the wrong songs from this tremendous album.<br />Dark Horse 4/5 Took awhile to grow on me, but now I can't get it out of my head.<br />This Is How We Do 5/5 If T.G.I.F. had a sequel, this would be it. It has the same feel-good party beat and lyrics.<br />International Smile 5/5 Catchy and very Teenage Dream.<br />Ghost 3.5/5 Decent mid-tempo track.<br />Love Me 5/5 Another great ballad that's very radio-friendly.<br />This Moment 4/5 80's sounding ballad that will make you smile.<br />Double Rainbow 5/5 Another album highlight. The best ballad she has recorded to date.<br />By The Grace Of God 4/5 I'm not a religious person, but this beautiful ballad displays her feelings quite well.<br />Spiritual 3/5 Another catchy 90's inspired track.<br />It Takes Two 4.5/5 A divorce track with sad lyrics.<br />Choose Your Battles 3/5 The final ballad that sums up the album with yet another heart-breaking theme. Sounds like a Celine Dion song.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great pop album. It does slow down for the final 8 tracks, giving it a well-balance listen of dance tunes and slow songs. If you loved Teenage Dream, then you'll love this as well.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this game but it keeps asking you to buy more stuff to help you win. I have a feeling that I will have to buy more in the end or I will be stuck.
B00F30S0Y0|5.0|Saw Arcade Fire on Saturday Night Live and the extra show after and my wife and I couldn't wait for the CD.<br />Only listened to it a few times but it could be their best work so far
B001NHNG64|5.0|but I don't feel like typing an essay about it... going to down load and start reading number three now
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Just adore his books, so addicting. This book did get little drafty at the end but it's so nice to learn with real life facts in a story. This is what I treasure in his books.
1419705644|3.0|One of my granddaughters is an Adventure Time devotee so I bought this as a Christmas gift.  I'm a bit disappointed.  I was expecting a coffee table book and instead got something you'd find at a grammar school book fair.  At least it has a hard cover.  I hope she enjoys it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush is prob the most played app right now. I love it!! It's not only fun, but it's challenging as well. Who knew
B0058YPL66|5.0|This is a gift for a friend, so it has not been opened yet, but I have been happy with any of my transactions with Amazon .....if she likes the series I will certainly get more as what an easy shopping idea & can be used over & over & passed around to her friends. Thanks
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I regimens to all it is challenging and fun for parents and kids of all ages I love this game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is the best game ever. you can be in grus lab, el machos lair, or in residential. you can battle el macho, meena, and vector. it is awesome
B009MYARIK|4.0|This novel was pure Sophie Kinsella. A little kooky, a lot funny and thoroughly enjoyable. 4 stars for an enjoyable read.
B00ESNE696|5.0|We love this show.  The character development has been great over the 5 seasons and the plots of the stories are always great.
B000VDUWMC|4.0|This book has some fabulous content that covers the evolution of human history from pre-historic to modern times. The author applies some really interesting and logical frameworks to deduce the broad stroke patterns of history. My only complaint is that the prose can sometimes get a bit too wordy and repetitive especially towards the end of the book once the key ideas have been established. The writing style sometimes becomes too academic and can be a put off for the casual reader.<br /><br />But on the whole, a must read!
B004Q9TYWQ|5.0|This collection had me laughing until I cried.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who needs a good laugh.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|It's a very easy to understand and use app for learning German. It's helped me in class with vocabulary. It plays more like a game than a learning tool.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham always keeps me guessing as to what the outcome might be. I could visualize the characters from the movie as I read. I can't wait till this one hits the screen. This hits the top three of Grisham favorites of mine. Right there with its predecessor and A Painted House .
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Really keeps you going.. Slightly frustrating because every chapter jumps from character to character but it makes you want to keep going. This book has all the qualities I like in a story.. A little suspense, love and drama. And not unrealistic love.. Very enjoyable.. Didn't want it to end
B0000TG9E2|5.0|we had all the videos from disney and wore them out.  now time to upgrade to cd, and this was the perfect christmas gift.  little one was very very happy.  great quality and great price.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|Whimsical and lots of rythm music done by a young and talented singer.<br />Well done Janelle! Keep writing and singing please.
B002XBVQKW|4.0|I have not seen the movie for a number of years.  It was great to see it again.  The humor was dark, the acting great, and the songs were terrific.  Everyone should see it at least once.
B005MRXQ7K|5.0|I have used this adapter from Bowers (the same as the Polaroid one) for years and I have never had a moments problem with it.  I use a 75 - 200 zoom lens and was able to get it to work without any problem.  It just takes a little thought process and some playing around to get the set up working just right but I have duplicated approximately 15,000 slides with no problem.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|So at first i got this game and it was doing well, Bus then it started asking me to do all these things like pay money to continue, or you have to be this old to do this, and Itz not fair for children. Anyway other then that i guess its a good game.
0385335482|4.0|I really like this book but there was a page missing from the copy I bought.  Slightly disappointing.  But I still love Sophie.  She is hysterical.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I don't write many reviews, but I felt that this book deserved one. IT was fantastic and devastating all at once. The characters were all damaged in some way and yet they were all able to overcome the tragedies of life. Some overcame it in cowardice, but mostly they overcame the harshness of life with the love of each other and the love that they found within themselves. Life is harsh and war IS not romantic. Many do not make it home fighting for a greater good. Not all stories have happy ending, what matters is what you can take from the story when it ends. I loved it and cried many tears for it. Bravo. (less)
0440242401|5.0|I love this book!  Sophie takes you into her world and I love it there even when it gets slightly uncomfortable and awkward, I know everything will work itself out in the end.  It's the perfect world!
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|Thoughtful, insightful, interesting read. It's always fun to see how Gladwell thinks. He makes connections that others don't naturally see.
B00CATSONE|5.0|This was a very fast look at one of the world's greatest minds. Tesla was a fascinating man and this book was way to short. Sean Patrick did a wonderful kid hitting the highlights but it only leaves you wanting more.
1423136802|5.0|Great for gifting. I didnt read the book yet but my friend's daughter loved it. Maybe someday I will read the book ^_^
B004KKX80A|1.0|I got ripped off and got the fake ones, I was hoping i would have gotten the real ones but no.
B008JFUPOY|5.0|Great movie.  Only downside is that if you are using the digital copy it is rather a pain compared to most.  You have to actually go to disney site type the code in.  Choose Amazon, Vudu, Hulu as the software then log in and type in another code.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game ROCKS!!!!! Totally a five star game!! The minions are hilarious and the courses are SO cool.  Get this game!!!!! It's a modern-day  temple run, with a kick.
B002VRNR1Y|4.0|Classic Horror film holds up well. Shelley  Duvall was not as annoying as i remembered from previous viewings. Jack Nicholson was a special effect all by himself.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I could not put this book down. Card really knows how to make you love the characters. You will not be disappointed.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a great game i love it love it!!! This game is super dupper addictive I cant stop playing.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is one of my favorite games in the world and without a doubt I bet you will love it a few moments after you start playing.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Well, I'll tell you;  it's probably my favorite game and I like the little character.  I like the premise of the game.  I don't like the difficulty of some stages where I'm stuck for weeks.  I like challenge, but I don't like nearly impossible, only getting a few chances to play and then having to wait.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I really love this game but like many other reviews before me, I can not log on to Facebook to 're dive the daily rewards. If this could be fixed it word be a great game. I do need more neighbours though. Please add me. My farm I'D is. FASBKTT
B003G4W49C|5.0|Movie wasn't that frat after reading the book, but the book was enough!!  Highly recommend starting to read this series!!
B000GWE44U|5.0|It was scary enough to get many reactions, but not too scary so I could sleep that night after watching it.
0743201140|1.0|This would have been a great deal. Bought the book for less than $20.00. Insisted on new so I could use the access code for the online test. The book came on time looking very new but the code they put inside had been used and it was a similar complain from some friends. Please go to Barns and Nobles or any other bookstore to physically buy the book except you have $20.00 to lose.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I have never read a John Grisham book before.  I am so glad I had the privilege to read Sycamore Row.<br />From the second it started I could not put it down. I loved this book.<br />I heartily recommend it to anybody. It's really that good.
B002PBTAL2|4.0|Season 2 is when the show finds its current groove and Charlie Hunnaman stops beaming in every scene.<br /><br />Small Tears is an important episode because Katey Sagal who is Jewish and portrays a character with Russian Jewish ancestry is beaten and gangraped by white supremacists and throughout this season, whenever the rape is mentioned, the characters talk about the tactical nature of the assault to destroy the ability of the men to fight by \\"crushing the matriarch.\\"  Also, Katey Sagal's characer is accompanied by her shrewd babysitter, a Black woman echoing how for generations, European Jewish women and African American women were assaulted and chose to not report the rapes to spare sharing the burden with their families since there was no hope of justice.<br /><br />To paraphrase the show's Hamlet:  if John Teller had lived to see Gemma raped, he would have written a very different book.<br /><br />And we know how [[ASIN:B004OA6858 Criminal Minds: Suspect Behavior - The DVD Edition]] ends - there's no speculation there.<br /><br />Janeane<br /><br />We always pick Janeane.<br /><br />ETA:  The white racists organization is probably based on the real life America First Committee which involved GERALD FORD, Sargent Shriver, a Quaker Oats heir and future Supreme Court justice.  I hope this means that America First Committee was just a government concoction to fool the Axis into believing that the Americans were on the fence over which side to be on.
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|It's a simple but addictive game. For 99 cents; you can't complain. I play it in the evening when I have some down time.
0316204366|4.0|What Good read for traveling.  Had a vew people looking over my shoulder asking if they should purchase it.  YES!
B008KYWMY0|5.0|I bought these to wear as part of my Halloween Costume. I was the &#34;Tin&#34; woman from the Wizard of Oz and needed a pair of silver shoes that I could walk around all night in with my children. For two different events I walked around for hours and didn't have a bit of trouble with the fit or comfort.<br /><br />I had these shoes in black and red from two years ago and they are just as comfortable as those original pairs. And they are a fun color that I can wear with a lot of my wardrobe. I highly recommend them.
B00G9U7NEQ|5.0|Great movie!! Not just for kids! We love it and watched it as a family! Lots of giggles and we will be giving it to our girls for Christmas!
B00DYFCYSO|5.0|I got this cd for my girlfriend.. its got a few nice tracks.. and she listens to it every few days..
0786956127|5.0|As advertised good quality. Added some better play spaces then drawing would allow. Going to buy another pack soon. yay
B0000013GT|5.0|my dad wanted this cd and it arrived fast and nice n clean.. hes been riding around listening to it and hes pleased..
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Love it. Would recommend this book and any other by this author for thought provoking reading. Download was perfect as always with amazon.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Loved it at the theater, and love it still. Especially on my 65&#34; samsung smart tv. wow. Will watch it again and again.
006202406X|1.0|The first 2 books were amazing. The writing was phenomenal. This book is so bad I actually question if she wrote the first 2. There's really no plot, the characters harp on the same things over and over and over with no resolution. The new characters that are introduced are arbitrary and show no development or thought. This book was really a waste of time and money and I've already returned mine.<br />****Spoilers Ahead****<br />Now onto the ending. Evelyn's change of heart is ridiculous and completely unbelievable. This is the woman who left her son and lied to everyone but the factionless. She was power hungry and seeking control of the city but now she's just going to step down because Four asks her to? Don't buy it. Tris's death? Even more unbelievable. You expect me to believe that David, who has probably never shot a gun in his life, manages to hit her not once, but twice as she runs across the room? You spend 2 books building up her tiny stature and quickness only to have her taken down by an unexperienced scientist? You must think your readers are really stupid Ms. Roth. I have no good words for this book. Only thank God I still had my receipt so I could return it. Now time to find something else to read to help get over the disappointment of reading this monstrosity.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|Daughter watches this movie everyday. It's cute seeing her and her 3 year old brother dance and sing the songs in the movie.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I believe this book should be required reading for anyone that's ever been a mother or is about to be one. It deals with darkness, fear, and mistrust without creating a sad story. This is a great story of strength and learning to trust yourself.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|We enjoyed watching this movie together as a family. Didn't have to worry about the content. We'd watch it again.
B004UID2LC|1.0|It infested my device with viruses worst app ever do not get it :( made my device run slow and made it crash
B0089LOG02|5.0|This is an amazing story that brings so many emotions to play. There is a cast of characters that are so diverse, yet the author blends them all into a fascinating read that is built on this little known piece of our history. Our book club highly recommends this book.
B008EL25LE|4.0|Crazy addictive game. Its a battery drain and I've started shutting down my WiFi during play to buy me some time. No crazy ads, no crazy permissions. Storyline is okay and even after winning the game, there are still challenges you can mess around with.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|IT is a awesome game its free but you have to pay Gs there things that are money.  you only have 50 though.
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|It has really helped me advance my spanish skills.  Easy to use, I can break up my learning into short segments
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I am a huge fan of keeping my computers and other devices &#34;clean&#34;.  There are some pretty standard utilities for Android, such as History Eraser.  However, I've usually had to use two, or even three, to do a complete job.  Clean Master does it all, in one app.
B008602KQI|4.0|Captivating story-- engrossing, visually intense effects that pull you in. While character development is a little weak, the story makes up for it. Holds pretty true to the book.
B00E7RZEI0|5.0|I really enjoyed the original Sprinkle, so I was please to find this sequel.  It introduces new actions and features, while still based pretty closely on the original game.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Very hard to put down.  Lunch takes 20 minutes longer than normal.<br />I did not read The Shining but watched the movie.  The writing is not too complicated and easy enough to read in short increments without losing where you were in the plot.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Very well written, with many surprises throughout. Reminds you of the domino effect our decisions and actions have on the course of our lives.<br /><br />Definitely one I would recommend to my friends.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|An interesting take on how Kirk and Spock came together at the beginning.  A more entertaining and well-acted move than the older Star Trek movies.

1780543484|5.0|As an avid Sherlock fan, I had been looking to get this calendar ever since it came out in September. Unfortunately, it had been a bit expensive, more than I wanted to pay for a calendar (around $30)... but then the price went down and I snapped it up. I'm very glad that I did.<br /><br />Each month is adorned with a beautiful photo of someone from the series. They are high-quality photos, very vibrant and with lots to look at. Most, if not all (can't recall at the moment) has a quote to match the character. The quotes are good picks, ranging from the comical &#34;I need you to maximise your visual memory&#34; when Sherlock spins John around in The Blind Banker to the ever-poignant &#34;Alone is what I have. Alone protects me.&#34; &#34;No. Friends protect people&#34; from The Reichenbach Fall.<br /><br />The photos of the characters range from Sherlock to John to both of them, to Jim and Mycroft and Lestrade. Even Mrs Hudson has a page for herself. I was a little disappointed to find that Molly didn't have a character page... but perhaps next year.<br /><br />And there's a special treat in between July and August, I believe are the months... which I read is a special pre-promotional photo from Series Three. It's nothing fancy, but I didn't expect it and it makes me smile. It also gives one a reason to hang up the calendar before 2014, since it doubles as a non-year specific poster.<br /><br />Now, I've never bought a calendar that was made in the United Kingdom, so I didn't know what to expect. But the quality is even better than what is made in the United States. The front and back covers of the calendar are good quality and glossy, where my US calendar from last year is just dull, no shine whatsoever. It seems to be holding up very well.<br /><br />All in all, I'm stunned by the beauty of this calendar. It's a definite buy for any Sherlockian if you can find it at a reasonable price for you. It helps to fill the void that seems to be like the Great Hiatus betweenSeries Two and Series Three... and it also helps me count down the days until January 19th's premiere.
B0053O89JM|5.0|I received the DVDs in a timely manner.  I had missed the last 6 episode of house and was anxious to see how the series ended.<br />A great ending to a fantastic series. Everyone that liked House will be satisfied with the very last episode.  A must see.
B00632HWOG|1.0|I have yet to be able to retrieve my 'inbox'.  So far this app has totally sucked!  Would never recommend it!
081297381X|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. Along with Kahneman's &#34;Thinking Fast and Slow&#34; should be required reading for everyone.
B0068TL23G|5.0|This is so much fun and addictive too. I had it on my phone for the longest time and then I got to a level I couldn't beat. I finally gave up when I had to replace my phone. But it is a lot of fun!
B00498YZH8|5.0|Interesting, genuine, and fascinating.  Terrific performance from Lawrence and the rest of the cast.  Scenery is incredible.  A spellbinding yarn you'll have a hard time letting go.
0385351399|2.0|are presented in Eggars new book but the writing, pacing and dialog is extremely sub-par. It's hard to make it through the book without the thought arising that time would be better spent doing just about anything else. It's really took bad because the subject matter is ripe for serious examination and ready for to be parodied and satirized. I guess Eggars was not the right person to examine our digital lives and futures.<br />The book ends up being trite, unbearably silly, predictable,  simple minded and ultimately a waste of time. This is the kind of book that only gets released because a established writer wrote it, if anybody else would have written it would have never been published.
B00D8CSVLW|2.0|What could have been a really good story, was ruined by poor character building and a lack of emotional depth.  Disappointing.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book a lot! I have read this 3 times already! It sounds just like the book Blood Red Road Dust Lands by Moors Young! On to Mockingjay!
B00F3YFR38|4.0|I love In Utero, it has been one my fav Nirvana album and one of my fav albums all time (being second to Oasis'WTMG perhaps). It's absolutely suberb in mind and as an album is much better than Nevermind (though as a collection of songs it might fall a bit behind).<br />I just got a copy of the 20th anniversary edition - its an utter disaster. First of all, the album did not deserve such a mediocre packaging (I mean it's not bad, but it's just does not feel anything special as THIS album would deserve).<br />Second - no lyrics, okay, I own an original, so could live with that.<br />Last, and most important: what a terrirble text in the booklet by that guy (whoever that is)... I mean common... I did read it through, but it is absolutely disgusting how he tries in a pseudo funny way to draw all the attention to his @own living experience and vision@ and stuff completely irrelevant to such a great album, nothing to do with the band or the album.<br />Was expecting some  retrospectical review from one of the members or something, not that BS.<br />Sorry.<br />In Utero deserves a 5/5. I give it 4/5, just cos of the album..<br />But this is 0.5/5 totally dissapointed.<br />Still probably going to buy the 3cd/dvd version, just cos the album is so great.<br />If you are a Nirvana fan - save money for that one instead I guess...<br />If you are not Nirvana fan, then please just buy an original In Utero album.
B004A7OQKY|5.0|I was in good shape before I got pregnant, and then fell off the wagon big time in my first and part of my second trimester. Yoga once a week is all we could really afford, so we bought a few pre-natal dvds hoping that would make it easier on my schedule and wallet. I have tried about 6 different dvds now and this one is my favorite.<br /><br />Pros<br />Easy to follow<br />Not boring<br />Pushes you, but not too much<br />A darn good workout<br />Got me back into shape and gave me much more energy<br />Love the partner work out at the end<br /><br />Cons<br />I wish she had more dvds!<br />May not be best for people who haven't worked out before. Make sure to modify!<br /><br />...I couldn't think of any more cons. I really recommend this one to pregnant ladies everywhere!
B00F91RYL8|3.0|It's a good movie if you accept it for what it is.  It's not your traditional zombie movie.  Although you sometimes see herds of 'zombies' you don't see them that often in my opinion.  They seem to be more a part of the scenery at times.  They run really fast and are pretty strong but seem to be just passing through in lots of scenes.  You don't really get the suspense that's in other zombie flicks like Resident Evil or shows like The Walking Dead.  I guess you can say it's more sanitized, like resident evil minus the gore and big scares.  It's a zombie movie for those who may not care all that much for zombie movies.  That being, said it's still entertaining, action-packed, and worth a watch.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Did my 1st puzzle liked it.  It was free and they didn't put the bite on you for money.  Not like some of the other games I have bought that were free and after you download them you have to pay to play.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|What's not fun about minions? This game it's fun and challenging, but not so hard my kids can't play it too. Better than the subway juvenile delinquents.
0307266303|5.0|This is a great book!  It totally changed my view of running and human physiology.  It is written very well with medical facts intertwined in an interested story.  I highly recommend the book, and I have been running &#34;barefoot&#34; ever since.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|Every episode of this series was amazing. I plan on ordering the rest of the box sets so I can have the entire set at home.

B003WUYRGI|1.0|I LOVE READING AND I AM AWESOME AND I THINK THAT THIS IS THE WORLD'S WORST BOOK EVER!<br />DO  NOT GET IT!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I enjoyed the majority of this book. It took me a few chapters to understand all the characters (main and supporting) and how they were intertwined, but eventually it all fit. The book was definitely a page turner; however, I was disappointed with the resolution of  events. I don't think some of the endings were based in reality. The Husband's Secret is still a good read and I would recommend it.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|LOVE THIS GAME- MUCH MORE LEVELS ETC ON KINDLE THEN ON COMPUTER.<br />NO PROBLEMS.<br />HARDLY EVER CRASHES.<br />ADDICTING CAN'T PUT DOWN
B00B2FLDRQ|4.0|This is a very funny feel good book giving amazing insight -I assume- in the working of the mind of an Asperger

B0063IH60K|5.0|Simple and fun to play, ads can be ignored and best of all......it's free!!  If you like solitare you will love this game.
B00FPGSPQU|1.0|Alan was especially arrogant and abusive in talking to or about others and Chow was not likable at all. I didn't find any humor in it  and the ending was disgusting.

B00AEFXTKO|5.0|Love this movie when it first came out.The picture was nice and clear and it is a good quality.Will order from this site again
0756404746|4.0|Kvothe telling his life story to The Chronicler is a good way to develop the story.  The storyline Rothfuss has developed has me wondering how he's going to be able to wrap it up in a trilogy, as it seems like Kvothe has a long way left to go.<br /><br />Kvothe's character is developed well, but I find myself wishing the same effort was applied to the rest of the major characters.  The main antagonist is simply a boorish incredibly wealthy Noblesman's son who lets one argument escalate into a war of wills without any reason why.  The teachers at the university are generally one dimensional, as are Kvothe's friends, and even his love interest, to some extent.<br /><br />The storyline works fine, and was entertaining, yet I find myself angry with Kvothe for some of his decisions in life.<br /><br />Still, it's a good read, if not an all time classic.
B0084B1T8Y|4.0|Several great stories. All worth reading. Wish I had read it earlier.<br /><br />This book kept pulling me in and flowed pretty well.
B004LUS390|5.0|I find this ap to be a lot of fun. Unlike some others, I don't think it is difficult to figure out how to use. I am not very good as an artist but I still have fun with it and like that I can save the ones I want.
B002ITWSUQ|5.0|I love this movie.  I could watch it again and again.  It's a sweet movie with a perfect ending.  This is a movie I can watch with my kids when they are a bit older.  It has a great message.
B00EKQ3YZI|4.0|I PURCHASED THIS COLECTION OF REMIXES AND AFTER LISTENING TO THEM REPEATEDLY, I CAN SAY THAT THERE ARE SOME BETTER THAN OTHERS, I'M HAPPY OF HAVING THIS REMIX ALBUM WHICH MEANS; I´VE GOT \\"NEW DONNA SUMMER STUFF\\" IN MY HANDS, OR... SORT OF IT. AND TO BE HONEST I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT THAT TAKES TO RELEASE THIS ALBUM OF REMIXES, ALL THE WORK BEHIND THE PROJECT, IT DESERVES RECOGNITION TO THE PRODUCERS. DONNA SUMMER IS RELIGION TO ME SO I LOVE THE ORIGINALS, BUT WHAT I'VE LEARNED FROM THE DAY I KNEW ABOUT THIS ALBUM, IS THAT SOME FANS WOULD LOVE IT AND OTHERS HATE IT. THIS ALBUM DESERVES TO BE LISTENED AS IT IS; AN ELECTRONIC DANCE ALBUM... DANCE YOUR HEART AWAY!!!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Best sitcom in many years... Never miss it and watch past episodes over and over again...<br />Buy all the seasons !!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun game but if you buy more lives it should be more than given because I did buy and I still didn't even come close to completing so not buying anymore. Waste of money . Give us a fighting chance will you...
B003G4W49C|5.0|loved the psych insights--surprise ending was great! recommend for all ages and professions. hope the movie is as well done!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I enjoy playing this game but sometimes is very difficult especially with the limit of how many games you can play without buying
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|Good movie to watch with the small ones. I even enjoy Nicky Cage's acting. Very good animation. Fun cute story.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|What a crazy fun book to read! So charming and one can relate one's childhood even today! Make your soul a favor read this book
B003F44QRQ|4.0|A classic.<br />Great acting and still funny.<br />Dated but good. The two Corey's have never been better. The clothes and hairstyles are always relevant.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I like almost all his stuff. What would it be like if super heroes were villains is a good theme. Read it.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|A for action packed with some sci fi humor & a sci fi reality. 3 Z's for for Zombie, Zombie,Zombie action. Get ready to wrap your arms with duck tape & mags!
B00271B752|4.0|Very well acted.  I love Al Pacino in this one.  I think it lays out the story of a young, idealistic policeman in a corrupt system in a very realistic way.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Great graphics for a free game<br />Wish u could free roam would make the game more intense but over all I give thumbs up
0307476073|3.0|As a female hiker in her early-30s, I was really excited to obtain and read this book.  I had just heard an interview w/ the author on NPR and had an upcoming 3 hour flight, so I was pretty excited to get my hands on the book.  The book reads FAST - I'm not a fast reader at all (pretty average) and I got this thing done in about a total of 5 hours of reading (needed to break out a 2nd book for my flight home!).  It was definitely an entertaining book, just not EXACTLY what I was looking for.  Some might find it a good balance between a 'book about a long distance hike' and her 'personal story'...I was looking / hoping for a larger focus on the long-distance hike. Don't get me wrong, there's light gear talk, blister talk, talk of trail names and culture, etc - but just not as much as I was hoping for.  I really enjoy factual adventure books (Into Thin Air, Into the Wild, etc) and was hoping this was a little more along those lines.  I would definitely (and have) recommended it to my similarly outdoor-oriented female friends, but not necessarily to my male friends w/ similar interests.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|One of favorite CD's lately and also by him.  Love the cover love the music. Its soothing with a little country/folk sound to it.
B006ZDS7CE|1.0|This is not the regular summertime sadness song... it is a re-mix... way way waaaaayyyy slower. Definately not the upbeat song I was looking for.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Awesome box set! Well worth it!! I have watched all of the DVD's and none of them have any scratches or any problems!
B00BQBNK04|5.0|Truly one of the best musical soundtracks of all time. I totally understand why Les Mis is the world's most popular musical... it's just about perfect.
B0035G0U2O|5.0|Although a little unbelievable at times, the cinematic effects and exciting never-before-seen natural disasters made this movie watching experience very pleasurable.
B00G32QIEG|1.0|The movie just down right was stupid glad I didn't go to the theater to watch it and pay the high dollar
006202406X|1.0|This book was part of a trilogy. It was purchased for my 13 year old daughter who fell in love with the Divergent series, well for the first two books that is. She was greatly disappointed about the abundant amount of teen romance that the third book was filled with. She was a faithful reader of the series and had pre-ordered book 3. She literally couldn't wait! Once the book arrived, she dove right into forgetting about her other favorite pastimes, i.e. Minecraft, YouTube, and Pandora.<br /><br />She read through the book despite wanting to stop 1/3 of the way into it. I suggested she skip those parts and read around it so she could her know how the book ended. Even with that suggestion, the book ended on a sour note. It really is disappointing when devoted readers stay with an author throughout the series, no matter how many years it will take to reach the end. Unfortunately for this writer, she took the easy way out and fell into the doomed world of Hollywood and sold out by filling the pages with teen sex. Seriously, if we want our teens to act better and have inspiring role models, it's time authors, screenwriters, directors and producers start entertaining our children with something other than sex. There is more important things in the world than dating.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Much more comprehensive publication about Amazon's editorial and publishing criteria.  If only one book were to be considered, i.e., Building your Book for Kindle versus Publish on Amazon, I would suggest Building your Book as the primary source of information.  However, since they both are offered by Amazon at no cost, I ordered and received both.
0143117009|5.0|Jared Diamond's Collapse is a magnificent study in Cultural Geography. He discusses the end of numerous civilizations from different parts of the world at different times.<br />He spends the first part of the book describing the cultures that were established on many of the islands in the South Pacific, how the local ecologies differed and how that led to different outcomes. He describes the technique of pollen analysis (palynology) as a way to determine what kinds of trees were living during particular times in a region (or, more particularly, Easter Island). From examining the bones of animals in the middens, they have shown the existence of a half dozen birds, and postulated dozens of sea-bird species. He also describes many other geographical characteristics that affect these islands including the relative distance from other islands, latitude, how distant they are from the mainland volcanic eruptions that provided vitamin-rich dust/soil.<br />In his survey of early native-american societies he describes the painstaking work to determine the age of structural trees when they where cut through tree ring analysis and their relation in time to other structural trees based on the relative location of significant event shown in the rings (droughts, fires, etc.) From this he makes well-supported conjectures about the growth and collapse of the Chaco Canyon dwellers.<br />In another section he details the different outcomes from the various island societies started by the Norse in the North Atlantic before the \\"little ice age\\" around 1400 AD. These include the Shetland and Orkney Islands, Iceland - which only survived by establishing rigid ecological rules - and eventually Greenland, where their European culture ruined their chances for establishing a lasting settlement once the ice age came.<br />However, what I found most gratifying is Dr. Diamond's admission that he initially started this book thinking to prove how environmental destruction was the sole or primary cause of these civilizations' collapse, but that once he get into the research he found that, although it played a part in all these collapses, it was only a part and was even then sometimes driven by cultural and/or political factors. Little nuggets like that make sloughing through these types of tomes written by ultra-liberal academics sometimes worth it.ause of these civilizations' collapse, but that once he get into the research he found that, although it played a part in all these collapses, it was only a part and was even then sometimes driven by cultural and/or political factors.

1476747016|5.0|A must-have book for anyone who loves everything and anything Pusheen. The quality of the material is also very good for the price. Definitely a great purchase.
B00DURHYWC|5.0|As usual Pink Martini took unfamiliar music and made it their own.  I love this album and almost cried when Phyllis Diller finished singing.  Thank you, P.M. for convincing her to do that song.  Now I have an audio memory of a lady I enjoyed over the years.  The rest of the album is just as delightful, glad I got it.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Great movie about a man on the run and a teenage boy who wants to help him.  The story is original.  The boy, who does everything to help Mud get the boat floating so he can leave the area, drives the story.  I have sympathy for the boy and Mud because because both are trying to fulfill their unfulfilled dreams.  It is truly a story about the loss of innocence and the boy's idea what love should be, but isn't.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I use it all the time.  Its ease of use and the ability to switch from dictionary to thasaures makes it a most useful tool.
1451626096|2.0|This book is fiction I know , but this is too much of that, so much that while reading I thought too many times : this is impossible , that can not be true, so I finished it but it was a disappointing experience for me..........
B00622B3MY|4.0|A little overly violent for the younger set, but cute.  My son loved it of course, and we'll probably watch it again before we head off to Cars Land in Disneyland!
B00G9U7NEQ|4.0|As it often happens with sequels, this movie is not as good as its predecessor.  However, my children love this movie and would watch it over and over.
B008JFUO72|5.0|I own the first two and love them.  This one is just as good, if not<br />better, than the first two.  Will watch many times.
B005EHILV4|5.0|Good purchase good price cant beat it! sounds great I would recommend to anyone who's trying to build a home studio and just starting like me
B005LAIIMG|5.0|A perfect movie for me.  I love the action flicks.  Will watch over and over.  A great<br />addition to my collection.

B006IYG5HE|4.0|Another Damages But Enticing Hero!  It's a wonderful series, though quite dark. The twists and turns in the plots are always good.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I don't recommend nobody this book because it is not a good book to read it is not a dictionary they are a layer
0992251656|5.0|Pleasantly surprised at how much of the verse is incorporated into this game. You really get the feeling that you are a Firefly Captain and are just trying to survive out in the black. Even though I gave this game full stars it's not without some faults. Most Firefly fans won't care because is just a ton of fun. The turns can take a bit due to needing to determine what contracts you want to accept and figure out where they are on the map. Also consideration options for purchasing crew and gear can take a bit. All of that gets better when players get the board memorized, and learn to start the next players turn before the previous player is done. Occasionally you will get stuck due to drawing too many bad Nav cards but it's designed to simulate random havoc while flying out in space, from Reaver encounters to Alliance inspections, to just normal breakdowns and salvage operations. If they find a way to make the turns go faster, it would be nice to have a 6 player option but for now this will do. Really, really love this game. Plenty of variations with Captains, gear and contracts to keep the game fresh for many replays.
B00F56AZK4|5.0|I am usually not a fan of jigsaw puzzle s but after playing this app. I am hooked This is Fun free &amp; fabulous! And the price can't b e beat! I highly recommend this game!
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|Started out slow but it did picked up nicely. I would recommend this movie to any fan of the avenger marvel movies.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Very easy to download and I had music!  Then I set up my playlists so I could choose for the mood I am iin.
B00F8MIIKO|4.0|This was an enjoyable movie however not quite as good as the first one.  Some characters were a bit too scary for my young kids but overall, pretty good.
B007USWCXS|5.0|Le Havre was my introduction to Finnish director/screenwriter Aki Kaurism&auml;ki.  After seeing the film I immediately sat down at the computer and put the rest of his films in my queue.  Called the “miserabilist's miserabilist,” his long sequences with no dialogue and deadpan faces are a delight to me.  His capacity to create the bleakest comedies reflects not only himself, but his mother country.  In an interview, he said in answer to what defines the Finnish character:  &#34;Melancholy.”  And as to why Finland has such a high suicide rate? &#34;Lack of light. Light in every way. The sunshine.  It is always dark, and when it is dark, it is also dark in the mind.&#34;  (Being a person affected by SAD -Seasonal Affective Disorder - I totally understand this.)  The amazing thing about Le Havre is that it is not only bleak; it is funny and sweet.  As he says (and I love this quote), &#34;When all the hope is gone, there is no reason for pessimism.&#34;  The film has a quirky quality to it that brings a smile, even though it deals with life and death issues – a wife who might be dying, a young illegal immigrant from African Gabon avoiding arrest.  One of the delights is the surprise of characters who go beyond expectations.  A reminder that people have more possibilities than we often imagine.  Another delight is the astonishing affirmation of the power of a love that simply takes care of the details, one by one.
B00FFHG6KQ|4.0|Like the game but it can get frustrating to play as the there are no sliders and the computer can shoot lights out when left open. The modes alone give this game 4 stars as you have a lot of options and the fact you can play multiple seasons is impressive enough.<br /><br />Playing defense can be challenging as the control makes it hard to really control your player. The computer gets way to many offensive rebounds and too many fast break points.<br /><br />Do like that the A.I. moves around and don't stand still as you try to create shots.<br /><br />Like the game, but man it can get frustrating trying to win a game!
B00AZMFO6I|4.0|Dustin Hoffman’s directorial debut is adapted from a play by Ronald Harwood about a retirement home for aging musicians.  Many supporting roles are played by musicians who do perform.  My major disappointment is that Hoffman didn’t cast top flight aging opera singers in the “quartet.”  But then, most singers probably wouldn’t be willing to perform past their retirement, and the quality of Verdi’s glorious Rigoletto quartet, which is the movie’s finale, would suffer.  Since I love musicians and fine music, I reveled in the film.  The acting was quality (Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon, Pauline Collins and Billy Connolly), and the story of personal and professional reunions pleasant.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|The dialogue in this movie is just amazingly honest, and so perfect!  I love the quaint, beautiful walks through Paris too.  It's the sequel to Before Sunrise, and it was a sweet follow up on their story.  The ending is so perfect, I'm still smiling!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Excellent game, in fact so good that I deleted it so I could start from the beginning again. Highly recommended.
B00CHVJODE|5.0|We've watched this movie as a family atleast a dozen times and laugh every time :) we love it! It's hilarious and is also very clean...no hidden nasty jokes or innuendo to worry about the kids catching onto, just good clean fun :) great movie!
B000X1T7MS|5.0|First of all, thank you for speaking out about the real force behind terrorism.  The author is heroically determined to open some eyes.<br /><br />Now if only people with an open mind were encouraged to pick up this book and assimilate the message in it.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|lots of fun some boards are harder than others makes you think. the jokes are cute. why is it even in a game like this the girls have big boobs?!
B00EUVG3P6|5.0|This is a smoking little chip for what it costs.  It has two fast Haswell cores, and many of the recent features, and really has pretty good throughput.  Spending more money will get you a faster chip, but this little guy offers about 80% of the big chips, in terms of running most software, for about 30% of the price.<br /><br />Now, it won't do as well with widely multithreaded things, like video encoding, because it has only two cores.  But not much consumer software, and only a few games, take advantage of more than two cores at the moment.  For normal software that most people run, this thing will kick butt.  It's fairly close to the speed of the much more expensive i3, with the major difference being that the onboard video on this chip is much weaker.<br /><br />But, if you actually want 3D performance, the stronger video in the i3 still isn't strong enough, so it's just wasted.  Buying this instead will free up a bunch of money toward a separate graphic card, which will improve your gaming quality much, much more than the i3 ever could.<br /><br />If you're a value shopper, this is an outstanding choice.
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|I read the reviews online but decided to take a chance. Very much enjoyed the storyline. Could have had more character development but kept me well entertained. Had a Blade Runner feel but the characters were more innocent.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I put in my order for this on the 1 st of Nov. And got it today. Nov 4 th.<br />This is a great set. I have the old DVD set my wife got me a good 12 years back.<br />And got this one to go with it. Could not pass it up for $20.00 bucks.<br />The set is in a neat book like picture book deal.<br />The disc to take a bit of time to load. But everyone of them play great.<br />And it is great to see all the movies in Blu-Ray..<br />This is one great set!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|The grandkids and. I are fighting for a turn at this very engaging game. Crushes candy crush any day of the week.
B00G9U7R2O|4.0|good movie and funny leads to the first one that came out a while ago. All new characters and new scares.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|As Netflix users, I think this is a must have product. We were previously watching Netflix through our Blu-Ray player and were often frustrated with it freezing up. With Chromecast we can now cast from our phones or tablets. It is convenient and easy to set up. We also cast you tube videos to our tv and can't wait for Amazon Prime to be added to the list! For the price, you can't go wrong.
B00006EXDM|5.0|&#34;Nuttin&#34; like the Stones to getcha rocking and a rolling and partying your pants off!  An absolute must for Stoned fans, especially if you just want their greatest hits.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Outstanding look into Scott's journey and training.  He was so honest with his ups and downs. The recipes are priceless and are part of my training and daily living.
B00FJTYDKK|3.0|maybe it was that I had such difficulty downloading it, so it stopped and started all the time. I don't have that trouble on net flicks but don't like their movie selection as much as yours.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|What a good story!  Told well.  Good character development. Nicely paced and uniquely told.  Fun plot.  BMI ?( not saying)!
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|Utterly boring and drawn out. It's a remade Godzilla movie a different character name and a really crappy plot. So pissed that I rented this in HD for $4.99.
B00F3WO0NS|5.0|It's cheesy, overly dramatic and involves teenage angst and wiggly eyebrows, but you have to live this series. It has the familiar plot progressions that have been seen in the previous instalments and plenty of actions tis nice to have a lighter vampire series than true blood and this one continues to deliver
B005HEPIDS|5.0|A big Star Trek Voyager fan. I was finaly able to complete the series and fillin the blanks while reading the novels
B003G4W49C|5.0|I highly recommend this book. As any masterpiece, it is an everything work. People who never read anything but technical manuals started to read for pleasure and purpose after reading it. You can read the plot points in many places, I don't need to repeat them. Prepare to be moved, it's what great literature does.<br /><br />It is one of the most human, humane, and caring books I have ever read. I truly feel sorry for people who haven't, or won't, read it.<br /><br />It is inconceivable to me that the man who wrote this book could also own his views on LGBT people. I don't understand the disconnect.<br /><br />If it is possible to divorce one's opinions of the author from his (earlier?) writing, enjoy this book. It is very understandable if you cannot.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|over all its a good game some of the levels are almost impossible because they don't always give you enough fruit to win
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|By far the best he has written. I hope when Hollywood comes calling, they retain as many of the  original cast as possible. It is a must read!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Get this game! It's fun and keeps your mind working. I'm sure glad my friend told me about can you escape!
B008JFUQZ2|5.0|A fantastic film.  For fans of anime or kaiju films this movie is a must watch.  It is a great film with epic set pieces and action, but the human factor of this story is also great.  The people within this movie serve to round out the spectacle with real 3 dimensional people.<br />The special features are an enriching experience as well.  You can go in depth with the methods and techniques Guillermo Del Toro used to create the machines, monsters, and other elements that compose the world that he has created.  By far my favorite movie of the summer with special features that make this a more rewarding experience.  I recommend this film to anyone who likes great action, fun adventure, or good films.
B00A757EFW|3.0|my grand daughter downloaded this game she likes it...me was never into this game, must be I am not good at it
B00DU74U74|1.0|It was one of the most boring movies I have ever watched. It was nothing like twilight. Twilight saga had it's interesting moments.
B005HSL626|2.0|My grand daughter downloaded this game, I played it and not sure what else i am to do other then slice the fruit.  Not my favorite game but the kids like it
B000FC1K66|1.0|I know this book was highly recommended etc. but I just could not get into book. The author rambles constantly and the main story could have been wrote on three pages. I could not even like the characters. I hope the movie was better.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love love love this book. It's an easy read and it flows so well. Highly recommend you read the series.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|My wife and I enjoyed this show and it was done very well. My wife says it was the best movie or show made of Jane Austen's book
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Lovely. As always. Beautiful story. All the character's pain and longingness is delicately braided into a hopefull story where life shows them mercy and a  chance of redemption.
B00E7SFAAG|2.0|Too hard to play- guess I'm not too good at this type of game. Maybe you can do ALOT better.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|The master of the genre, Grisham delivers. It was a nice reunion with Jake, Ozzie, Lucien, Harry Rex, et. al.
B00BE97ONM|5.0|Aside from some minor editing I thought this book was excellent. The plot was believable. Believable characters, and an unexpected ending. It was gritty, engaging, and well written. In spite of not wanting to I found myself sympathizing with the character. That I did so speaks to the author's excellent craft at writing.<br /><br />Well done.<br /><br />(I bought another book written buy the same author because I like this one so much)
B00G32TD98|4.0|Great Movie, can't believe it's based on a true story.  Make sure you watch the interviews of the real family.
B01FMW4P6U|5.0|&#34;There is so much stuff that has yet to be invented.<br />There's so much new that's going to happen.<br />People don't have any idea yet how impactful the Internet is going to be and that it is still Day 1 in such a big way.&#34; ~ Jeff Bezos ~<br /><br />Following the death of Apple's brilliant CEO, Steve Jobs, in October of 2011, there were many articles written on who will be the next Steve Jobs. One such article was from CNN written by Doug Gross who came up with a list of dotcom CEOs and high-powered executives who are worth considering. On top of the list is technology genius, visionary, innovator, dynamic CEO of Earth's biggest online retail store, Amazon.com. Many, including myself, believe that the most likely candidate would be Jeff Bezos, who at an early age, had already demonstrated genius-like qualities and outside-the-box thinking. And there are quite a number of similarities between the two.<br /><br />Brad Stone, a senior writer for Bloomberg Businessweek who has covered Amazon and Silicon Valley technology for many years for Newsweek and New York Times publications, has written a well-crafted, most comprehensive, no-holds-barred 372-page-hardcover that is filled with a wealth of information on amazing Amazon.com and its brilliant Founder/CEO, Jeff Bezos, who is one of the greatest and most famous personalities in technology industry and business sector in the last two decades. The author's prose is sublime and his writing style is exemplary--the kind that commands the readers' undivided attention and stay focused and engrossed with their reading.<br /><br />Although I have read a lot of articles, news reports and information about Amazon on both print and digital media, reading this book gave me more insight on how Jeff Bezos--with his carefully selected team of smart people from newly graduates to seasoned executives from other companies--run Amazon.com and made it what it is today--a multi-billion-global-company that has 97K manpower worldwide. It has evolved from an online bookstore to &#34;everything store&#34; that sells 200 items per second and has become a one-stop-shop and go-to site for online shopping. Recently, a new fulfillment center was opened in San Bernardino, California.<br /><br />&#34;The Everything Store - Jeff Bezos and The Age of Amazon&#34; is an interesting and enthralling book from start to finish and is extremely detailed to the extent that the reader feels privileged and privy to the inside world of the giant online retail store and its highly-intellectual leader and his team. It takes the reader into the most intriguing behind-the-scenes of Amazon's operation. In a way, he reminds me of my boss in the past, a Senior Vice President, Trust and Investment Department of a fast-growing financial institution who expected everyone from his department to be focused 110% and excel in every project they do and whose mantra was &#34;I want results, not reasons.&#34; He was one of the very best, highly-educated, well-respected SVPs we had and we looked up to him as a role model. Through him, we all learned how to develop an excellent work ethic and how to deliver results in a timely manner.<br /><br />The success and incredible growth of Amazon.com is phenomenal. Of course, it was not at all smooth-sailing along the way. There were tough times too during its first few years of operation. Brad Stone mentioned that &#34;the company had lost $52K in 1994 and was on track to lose another $300K that year.&#34; But for Jeff Bezos and his excellent team, tough times never last. They were well-equipped with brilliant ideas, strategies, drive and determination that were utilized to the fullest during those tough times. His four secrets of success are: Customer Obsession, Invention, Long-Term Thinking and It's Always Day 1. On May 15, 1997, Amazon went public and traded an IPO of $18 per share. It was a tremendous success and raised a whopping amount of $54 Million which resulted in the company's 900% growth in annual revenues. Now the stock is valued at over $300 per share.<br /><br />In the past two decades the Princeton Summa Cum Laude has come a long way and became a business savvy and sharp negotiator as evidenced by his acquisitions of Zappos for $900 Million, Quidsi for $540 Million and of late The Washington Post for $250 Million. His other business ventures include Blue Origin, Bezos Expeditions and Bezos Family Foundation. It doesn't take a Brain Surgeon to figure out the huge success of Jeff Bezos and Amazon.com. He has a remarkable business acumen and not to mention his lofty goals with pinpoint accuracy.<br /><br />In 1999, he was named by TIME magazine as Person of The Year. Forbes named him as one of &#34;America's Best Leaders&#34; and he is ranked #15 on their list of &#34;The World's Most Powerful People 2013.&#34; He was also featured as &#34;Person of The Week&#34; in Diane Sawyer's World News at ABC sometime in August this year.<br /><br />The following are some interesting quotes that I've found to be noteworthy:<br /><br />&#34;Jeff is very clear and simple about his goals, and the way he articulates them makes it easy for others, because it's consistent. If you look at why Amazon is so different than almost any other company that started early on the Internet, it's because Jeff approached it from the very beginning with that long-term vision.&#34; ~ Danny Hillis ~<br /><br />&#34;At Amazon there were a hundred and fifty good ideas all the time and Jeff was capable of developing a new one every day.&#34; ~ Joe Galli, Jr. ~<br /><br />&#34;I have realized about myself that I'm very motivated by people counting on me. I like to be counted on.&#34; ~ Jeff Bezos ~<br /><br />&#34;Like other great entrepreneurs, including Walt Disney, Henry Ford and Steve Jobs, Bezos was turning imagination into reality, the fancies of his youth into actual physical things.&#34; ~ Brad Stone ~<br /><br />&#34;When we go ask him questions, it's worth listening to his answers.&#34; ~ Rodney Brooks ~<br /><br />&#34;Every anecdote from a customer matters. We research each of them because they tell us something about our metrics and processes. It's an audit that is done for us by our customers. We treat them as precious sources of information.&#34; ~ Jeff Wilke ~<br /><br />&#34;Amazon may be the most beguiling company that ever existed, and it is just getting started.&#34; ~ Brad Stone ~<br /><br />~ Update: December 26, 2013 ~<br /><br />The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and The Age of Amazon&#34; won the prestigious 2013 Financial Times and Goldman Sachs Business Book of The Year Award.

B00BWQW73E|5.0|The Everything Store is a fascinating and exhaustingly researched tale of the rise of one of most iconic companies of our time.  Its the definitive book on Amazon, and how it has changed our world.

B00G9U7R2O|4.0|Better than what the trailer made it out to be. It's a great movie; however, I still expect more from Pixar.
B005544V6A|5.0|I love the acting, the cast, and the plot twist.  Every week  I tape the shows and will watch each of them at least twice!  They also wear such nice clothes 😉
B001NEK2GE|2.0|I purchased and was charged for this product as a new unused product.<br />It took about a week longer than expected to receive this product.<br />After I received it I noticed that it was used.<br />There was no operator instructions or software CD's with the product.<br />I have not used this product yet.<br />So I do not know if there are any problems with it.
B002X6PTH8|4.0|Great movie! Classic Jim Carrey. My kids enjoy watching this movie on my tablet. It's lots of fun for the family.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|I plan on watching all the remaining seasons. I end up watching back to back episodes because of the cliff hangers. Very good show.
006202406X|1.0|I devoured the first two books of this trilogy. I couldn't wait to read Allegiant. But wow - it was horribly boring. I found myself bored to the point of skimming and skipping whole paragraphs - then forcing myself to go back and focus and read (only to discover that skimming was actually the way to go). This book is awful. It was forced. Unimaginative. Boring. Completely uncompelling. If I could do it all over again I would have stopped at Insurgent so that I could have finished on a high note...<br /><br />By the way, I know some will dislike the ending. But frankly, by the time I reached the ending I was so unbelievably disinterested that I felt zero emotion. What an utter disappointment.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|It was what I expected and why I wanted to read the book. Saw the movie and wasn't satisfied because I wanted to find more about the social aspect of the war. The book provided that.
B003DES8I6|5.0|Best movie ever!!!! I watch it over and ovet again :) Norman Reedus is do good in this film. Its perfect
B00G32QIEG|2.0|The dead people are depicted as clumsy aliens. Full of bad jokes, and the plot proceeds at a boring pace.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|fantastic and inspiring. this book taught me a lot about myself and how to approach varying situations with an open mind and lots of love
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I've never been a big Taylor Swift fan but bought this album because I liked a few of her songs that were out. I LOVE THIS ALBUM and now it is probably on my Top 10 list.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|Fits Well, good quality!<br />Excelent for the price,<br />I Recommend it and I will buy it again.<br />And the shipping time was good, without problems.
B003X2O6KW|5.0|I've liked the last few Kanye albums, but I am IN LOVE with this one. Listed in my Top 5!

B0063IH60K|5.0|Helps me relax after a hectic day.  Lots of fun!  Great to have on Kindle so I don't have to carry a deck of cards!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Really addicting and fun to get friends help What a Great game! Each level proving more difficult! I love the bright colors and challenges
B00D3J2QKW|5.0|The book is not an advise, it is founded on deep research and in a nutshell if I have to describe the book &#34;it is powerful  and simple&#34;. One of the very few books I could read in 2-3 sittings. Felt like sharing with all my friends. Great read for anyone and everyone across age groups.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|...and thought provoking. You'll want to discuss at a book club. I can't wait until I do tomorrow. Epilogue was surprisingly liked. Good plot organization and memorable characters with deep thoughts on marriage.
B0074QGGK6|3.0|Not bad, not great.  Helps to get ideas and the quest to find more info.  I just purchased \\"Zig Zag\\".
B002SLIALA|4.0|I enjoyed all four seasons of Everwood. A young Gregory Smith (Rookie Blues) and Emily Vancamp (Revenge) are a real treat. They tackled some serious issues: drunk driving that results in the loss of a popular teenager and teen sex and pregnancies with just the right amount of education and tact. The only thing that bothered me was Treat Williams.  He is a good actor but not convincing as Dr. Brown, the famous neurosurgeon. A suit-wearing doctor from NYC doesn't suddenly wear jeans and carry a back pack. To be honest, with the unattractive beard, he wasn't convincing as a love interest either but beyond that Everwood is a quality show.
006202406X|5.0|I was just as distraught over the ending of Allegiant as everyone else was, but honestly, after thinking it through, I couldn't imagine a different one. In short, and without declaring any [major] spoilers, it was just right. Everything Tris has done, everything she has become - has lead up to this moment. And I don't see this conclusion as making her efforts or her character, in general, worthless - on the contrary, I think it is the final step in revealing who she really is, who she was meant to be this entire time. In conclusion, I applaud Ms. Roth for creating such a complex and engrossing world filled with characters and a trilogy that have left such a powerful and lasting impression on me. Her work is truly inspiring, and I hope to see much more from her in the future.
B00G9VB288|4.0|How I Met Your Mother is in its 9th and probably last season but  continues to be a light-hearted fun show to watch. I don't consider it appropriate for children but a great combination of silly humor and true sentiment.
0385733577|4.0|The story was very engaging and intelligent. A pleasure to read and I will be reading all in this series
0385334206|5.0|Well, this was a fantastic book. Just fantastic. Witty. Dark. Weirdly fun. And oddly wise. There was stuff like this that had me laughing out loud: &#34;Kilgore Trout once wrote a short story which was a dialogue between two pieces of yeast. They were discussing the possible purposes of life as they ate sugar and suffocated in their own excrement. Because of their limited intelligence, they never came close to guessing that they were making champagne.&#34; And thought-provoking stuff like this that I'm pretty sure added another healthy wrinkle to my brain: &#34;Ideas on Earth were badges of friendship or enmity. Their content did not matter. Friends agreed with friends, in order to express friendliness. Enemies disagreed with enemies, in order to express enmity. The ideas Earthlings held didn't matter for hundreds of thousands of years, since they couldn't do much about them anyway. Ideas might as well be badges as anything... Earthlings went on being friendly, when they should have been thinking instead. And even when they built computers to do some thinking for them, they designed them not so much for wisdom as for friendliness. So they were doomed.&#34;<br /><br />I'd never read a Kurt Vonnegut book before *Breakfast of Champions*, but I am now hooked.

B00992CF6W|5.0|its cool but it needs more like the nether portal and mob spawn eggs and villages and caves and enderman wich would be really cool and it needs red stone dust and that kind of stuff over all its a good game
1580084621|3.0|Although the recipes seem true to tradition the author suggest using vegetable oil in place of pork fat or coconut oil claiming \\"the first is dripping with cholesterol and the second laden with saturated fats.\\" Page 164.  It's a shame he isn't up on the fact that both lard and coconut oil are healthful ingredients. Stick to the traditional Thai method of cooking and pay no mind to this guy's advice.
1439156816|5.0|This is an excellent book. Part memoir, part writing instruction manual. It is both a very honest and inspiring read. The reviews stating that it is &#34;the best book on writing...ever&#34; are not overestimating the book. I highly recommend to any aspiring (or established) writer.
0345803485|4.0|Took me about 4 chapters to start enjoying it.  The writing is not that great, but the story line is something I have never read of before.
B00007KWHN|5.0|In the first half of the 1970s, the rock music landscape was dominated by bands that are today called ‘prog rock’ bands.  The genre has become synonymous with over blown, over produced and ostentatious.  But at the time, many of these acts dominated the sales of LPs and filled arenas and large music venues all across America.  One of these acts, Yes, has become the poster child for all the scorn and derision directed at the genre.  They are a band that has changed their stylistic approach many times during their existence, and the period that they produced this release, The Yes Album was a good example.  Interested in raising the bar on their creative expectations, the group, composed of Jon Anderson, Chris Squire, Tony Kaye and Bill Bruford brought guitarist Steve Howe on board to help change their direction.  The result was music that is a little bit simpler in structure compared to what they had been playing, but it is also cleaner, more diverse and much more powerful. My personal favorite tracks are Your’s is No Disgrace,  Starship Trooper, and I’ve seen All Good People, but as with many of the best works from that period, it really works best if you play it all altogether. The tracks dovetail seamlessly into the others very nicely throughout, and you get a real appreciation for how skillful these guys were as musicians.  The original LP had six songs on it, but this reissued CD (expanded and remastered) adds circa 2003 bonus tracks of three of the original recordings (singles and studio versions). Why? I’m not sure. Perhaps they assumed you couldn’t get too much of a good thing with this CD, and basically I won’t quibble.  The original LP jacket art is reproduced on the CD insert, and it includes lyrics, credits and a short, well written piece describing the band, including some photos from the period.  Many Yes fans prefer one of their ensuing works, Fragile or Close to the Edge, but this one is their finest IMO, and I think it represents the very best of their output. I recommend it whole heartedly.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|The movie had me from the beginning, knowing the plane crash was going to come did not prepare me for the actual crash, it did not prepare me for the second less damaging, but needed crash.  I did not know about the alcohol part of it, that was a surprise, but that was the only surprise for me. This movie works on every level and it is an experience that I'm glad I had the opportunity to endure.  It is a stressful, in your face ride through what life can do to you when you let all of your control come from the substances that can make you feel good or feel bad.  It was a hard movie to watch, because it makes you think about what you would do in that situation, but knowing that you would never want to be in that situation.  THE STORY - had me from the beginning and took me on a ride that was never boring and never dragged, because I was in for the duration.  The writing was tight and every minute worked and was needed.  Would love to see what they filmed, but never used.  THE DIRECTION - was top notch and invisible, because the people and the situations and the writing were so real and true to life all you could think about was the characters and what was going to happen next.  No wasted moments veering away from the story being told.  It was in your face as ugly and broken as life can be sometimes.  It's hard to watch, but when a movie is this good you can't turn away till it's over.  THE ACTING - The acting in this movie works.  The only character that seemed tacked on and made me dread his appearances was the John Goodman character, but thankfully his time on the screen was small.  His was the only character that did not ring true to me and seemed out of step with the story, but I guess his character is the kind of person that would be out of step and not ring true, but somehow for me even as I think about it now, his character did not work.  Every other character worked and did well and they are gave award worthy performances.  THE SPECIAL EFFECTS - It's like being in the middle of a miracle and a horror story all at the same time.  I was tense as the crash was so realistic to me I felt I was in a seat and going through it.  I was in awe of what can be done now with movies and with a standard like the one displayed in FLIGHT why would anyone want to make anything that doesn't reach achieve or exceed that level of craftsmanship.  MY FINAL RATING AND RECOMMENDATION - I highly recommend this movie and will own it and will watch it again, but not soon I will have to recover from this flight.ng in the middle of a miracle and a horror story all at the same time.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|I am a die hard Veronica Roth/Divergent fan. Well...was. I have read every book in this series, and I am utterly, completely disappointed with this book. Firstly, 3/4 of the book is unbearable SLOW! Nothing, nothing, and more nothing going on. Every single scene is drug out, and I found myself having to push to keep reading. The first two books I read in a day or two. This book took me nearly 2 weeks (one day shy of it). And then the ending...OH my GOD the ending. It is HORRIBLE. It couldn't have gotten much worse - Roth would have had to try pretty hard to make it any more lacking than it already was. She could have made it 'edgy' in 1000 other ways if that's what she was going for.<br /><br />Even if you've read both of the other books, I would NOT recommend reading this book. I am pissed that I invested so much time and money reading it. I would be surprised if this last book doesn't end or stall Roth's career. I say that sadly, but I say it honestly. I will never buy another Veronica Roth book.<br /><br />***Spoilers from here on out: How depressing was it that Tobias and Tris pretty well hated each other for most of the book, minus the 2 pages where they slept together on a couch. I mean really???!!! How depressing is that?! Especially since Tris dies shortly thereafter!!! Then...oh by the way Tris just died? Let me go ahead and officially kill off Uriah now that you're sobbing from Tris dying. Hope you don't mind... I mean there was a solid disconnect (emotionally) between pretty well everyone in this book, for the ENTIRE book. I mean couldn't we have resolved the hateful relationship with Caleb a little sooner since everything else was going to be depressing?

Felt like Christmas morning when I got it. ;)
1878424319|5.0|This book was absolutely inspiring! I loved it! It is one I will refer to again and again. It just makes me feel good!
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Great adventure; non-fiction; inspiring. Cheryl Strayed shared one of the most amazing adventures in the outdoors. She was inspiring as she's sharing her hardships and faces real life outdoors.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|For those of us who are introverted, Cain's research provides many insights about both surviving and excelling in a world where it seems that extroverts prevail.  We'll worth the read.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I have read a ton about our country's last decade + at war but, nobody has ever been engrained in my brain like the four SEALs in the book. They are the best in history both in heaven and here on earth!!! Way to put that story forth King Marcus. You are a warrior to the core and an immeasurable man, friend and brother
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|You know as I first started to play it was fairly easy as expected. But as I got further into it became a little more challenging again as expected. So I began to use the boosters, after I depleted them I was  (assuming) hence the word that as I beat certain boards with a limited minute amount of moves that I  would be rewarded with a booster here &amp; there, that's not the case. But hey for this fun programming money has to be made for their  efforts. But the part that gets me are the limited amount of lives and the time that you have to wait to get those lives back can be a little frustrating. I think that's the tricky part to keep you coming back. So what I do at times is play until I lose two or three lives and then wait until the others lives are replenished and come to the game so for that alone I'm 50/50 with this game but it is a fresh game PEACE to us HUMANoids.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|It doesn't work. I it hooked up to the HDMI and USP sockets a Smart TV. I get the message ready for CAST. I click the cast icon on my laptop. The icon displaying my WI FI connection is shown however the cast never completes!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|very fun game and my kiddos get to play it as well only thing i dont like is you dont get lves when you pass the leval
B00BD99JMW|2.0|After reading the first two novels in the series, I was SORELY disappointed with this final novel. Why did Roth decide to change the narration in this one? I feel like she did not spend enough time developing a unique voice for Tobias which ultimately caused quite a bit of confusion while reading. I found myself frequently flipping back to the beginning of the chapter to check to see whose perspective I was supposed to be reading. Tobias's narrative read just like Tris's. I also think I was so frustrated with this narration that I wasn't able to focus on the actual storyline.
B009LDD4Z0|5.0|Love it! Because Emily and David has wonderful chemistry and it shows! And they are awesome actress and actor! It's awesome show!
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|It shouldn't be so great, but this movie is. Take it with the grain of salt the director means for you to and just enjoy the ride.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Love this game wish that the news bar across the top would read the news to you instead of you having to read it. But awesomegsme still.
B002ITWSUQ|4.0|Main plot line is an old one, but how it was written into this tale was nice. Surprisingly cute, very much worth watching.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I enjoyed this game. Very good puzzles that made me think. Nice story. Great graphics. Use of logic in most cases.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|One of the more unusual types of hidden object games on the internet.  I've tried a few but am finding this one more entertaining than most.  It's true that you can play for long stretches of time without spending your &amp;#34;real money&amp;#34;. You just have to learn how the game works and make some careful choices about where you go. However, if you don't have patience, spending some of your cash will keep you playing steadily. Recommend you try this but remember the HOS are more difficult than average and you're on a timer!
B002QQ8HAG|5.0|I was teaching a series on the fashion industry, and this provided great insider information on the characters who make the decisions.
B001AR0D4A|5.0|The Mist is a wonderful and welcome return to the more suspense filled horror films of old. Darabont takes his time showing us the characters, their surroundings, and their reactions to the confusing and horrible phenomenon unfolding before them.<br /><br />Although there is \\"something\\" in the Mist, the gooey, winged, tentacley monsters are meant to take a back seat to focus on the tension and danger that stirs between the humans. The situation really does get one to think about what would really happen if placed in a similar situation. Would we really be able to keep our cool when the impossible becomes reality? Would the societal norms that keep us balanced (relatively speaking, of course) hold up under such extreme pressure? Would the monsters be the worst thing that we'd have to worry about or would the real issue be a little more close to home?<br /><br />Turn off the lights, turn up your speakers, put the kids to bed, and really immerse yourself into this emotionally exhausting experience. If you let it, The Mist will take hold of you and deliver an experience that the world of horror has been missing for so long.
B001HM1PFO|4.0|Camp movie...grows on you as you watch it more times, but obviously very silly.  I wondered &#34;what the h...?&#34; the first time I saw it, but the music is fun and catchy, and sex jokes funny
0307586901|3.0|Very unhappy with book. Nothing noteworthy or eye-catching.<br />I suppose I expected much more from Martha Stewart. Clearly not worth purchase price.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|well done and entirely unbelievable. almost laughable. but well crafted. a fun ride a la indiana jones without the laughs.  i mean, Really? He kills about 40 guys non stop, completely solo. everyone goes down with one karate chop or one shot via pistol . he NEVER MISSES and NEVER TAKES a SCRATCH. c'mon. please.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love this book. I just hoped it was longer and the story was longer I'm sad it's the last boom hope for another one
B00AOVXOQW|5.0|It's really cute and still works after a few weeks of 2 toddlers playing with it! I like the little light that lights up in front and its cute how the coal car rocks back and forth. I made an oval track ,with my son's birthday cake in the middle of it, on the dining room table and had this train going around. It was so cute!! I like that it works with the standard wooden rail tracks. It runs with 1 AAA battery.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Good game needs more interaction can't wait for part 2 but still needs a little more. A must play once game.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|I like Adeles singing and this had some of her best. I like it and listen in my van. Very nice
B0040I09RM|5.0|best show ever. can't keep from watching it. love all the action and drama. keeps you pulled in all the time
B00D2I8E28|5.0|Elvis' best work in a while!  Elvis and Questlove have great chemistry that make these new grooves a welcome addition to the Costello oeuvre.
B0007DAZW8|5.0|These guys are very good.  They make music that transcends genres and is great to do stuff to. Highly recommended.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Another page turner. Excellent story. Once you start you can't put it down. Really good writer. I've only got one more to go and I've read all of your books ! Please keep writing.

B00C061I3K|5.0|These guys are very good.  They make music that transcends genres and is great to do stuff to. Highly recommended.
B004JN1D2I|3.0|s. morrison CA i like the series but, it's a little slow but i can't stop reading it! try it today
B0073COMUW|5.0|These are ideal where you need light and are not concerned about the white hot color.  In the basement or garage great.  In the bathroom where you want to know it's clean, fabulous. In the ceiling fan light for the dining room or living room, get the warmer lamps.  If you haven't gotten LED lamps before, you will be startled by how bright these are.
B008PZZYB2|1.0|It wasn't worth the time it would have taken to watch it.  it was ridiculous and gratuitous, we didn't finish watching it.
B00A2FSTC4|4.0|Once again Tom Cruise delivers . . . but as always never gets respected for it . . . . His film library keeps growing but the more it grows the more his popularity sinks. Oh well . . .<br /><br />The premise is a crime obsessed and ravaged America sacrificing common sense, morality, and its Constitution to eradicate crime . . . well murder. . . by using a new crime fighting division:Pre-crime. Pre-crime is a division that gets premonitions from genetic mutants (produced by druggies of all people) and capturing the offenders (well future offenders) before they offend. Not only do we get the premonition told to us we get it on video to watch before it happens. . . because you know the brain's thoughts can just be downloaded like computer programs, right?!?<br /><br />Another Hollywood corruption of morality for entertainments sake is the underlying theme here . . . If you wanted to eradicate all crime why not prevent the married woman and man having the affaire? Why not prevent the detective's drug abuse? That's right . . . Hollywood's morality tells us that those are not really crimes. They do allow the Irish actor playing an American (I guess there are not any good American actors who wanted or could play an American gov official . . . isn't that what we are told about immigration reform???) to give a somewhat confusing logical reason for focusing on murder only. But that is just an attempt to satisfy those of us non-sheep who question the plot in this area.<br /><br />Anyway despite the farcical segments that you come to expect from all modern Hollywood plots preaching morality you do get a mostly clever plot that really should be examined in today's political arena . . . the Constitution was created for a reason and when you stray from it you just create havoc. And just like all movies that predict a morally decaying American society leading to a horribly oppressive future (think Matrix) this movie takes the &#34;good guys&#34; underground to commune with icky people . . . the repulsive &#34;eye doctor&#34; . . . the creepy old woman who reaches out, grabs Cruise, and kisses him on the mouth (gag) . . . the amoral computer geek who runs a porn shop but somehow is the only one who knows right from wrong and helps Cruise's character. The entire idea behind the child molester scene, while ultimately exposed, is just disturbing beyond belief. It just leaves you with a hole in your gut as you realize Cruise's character like millions of American parents have had their children kidnapped by someone only to never have been seen again--probably the worse thing to ever happen to a parent. You never ever know if they are alive or dead. At least death brings closure. But we realize Cruise's character and his wife never find out. At one point we are led to believe by the &#34;precog&#34; that the kid is alive and well and adjusted . . . but that is muddled beyond belief. So again you are just given false hope. Anyway I guess the ick factor helps underscore what happens to a wayward America in this scenario. Dunno. What I got from it.<br /><br />Anyway some day when I'm old and in a Retirement HOme I'm sure Hollywood will release a Tom Cruise Greatest Hits DVD (or some media) and it will be more than I will be able to afford on a fixed income at that point. But it will be well worth it. Think about it . . . late 70s he has title credits and he is still going strong. I will never understand why America has to feed upon its own greatest treasures.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Even though I have not read previous books in this series, it was very easy to pick up on the story line and the twists and turns made it a real page turner.  Hard book to put down.  I will go back and read some more Pendergast novels.
B008JFUNHI|5.0|Card is a master storyteller and this movie remains true to his story, both the original Analog magazine 1977 version and the 1985 novel length version. The fact that it has unbelievably complex nested layers of meaning in its dialogs and beautiful effects just add to its appeal.<br /><br />Asa Butterfield presents a scrawny 14 year old Ender Wiggens, struggling with his identity as a third child in a society which normally only licenses two children per family. His character is a genetically manipulated prodigy, whose sole purpose in life is to seek training to lead the combined armed forces of an Earth which had been severely damaged by an unknowable enemy, the Formics. He is despised and bullied by his schoolmates, then kills the leading bully in a fight to end the persecution.<br /><br />These two critical conflicts naturally lead into a third, that of the debate between Major Anderson played by Viola Davis and Colonal Graff played by Harrison Ford. Anderson is the psychologist tasked with keeping the child trainees sane and balks at the way they are forced into endless conflict after conflict. Graff, the commandant of Battle School must suppress his humanity to find a way of beating the Formics, making him the voice of relentless call to duty. Anderson pleads for merciful treatment for both Ender and the other child soldiers. Graff dehumanizes himself, Anderson and the children to find a way to destroy the invaders and to prevent a second Formic invasion.<br /><br />At Graff's insistence, Ender becomes the first member of his family - both siblings and both parents had failed - to achieve the invitation to Battle School, an orbiting boot camp designed to train commanders for Earth's space fleet. On arrival Graff immediately throws him into every possible negative situation, designed to either break him or make him the perfect commander, a Caesar or Napoleon. Anderson tries to stop Graff from stripping his humanity.<br /><br />Yes, the training battles are everything any reader of the original book could imagine and more. Special effects are both brilliant and beautiful. Ender wins, but before he can go on to Command school a second bully, Bonzo, played by Mois&eacute;s Arias, attacks him. Ender beats Bonzo but in doing so, breaks his own spirit and resigns. Anderson resigns as well, realizing that she cannot live with the psychic damage Graff is doing to the children in Battle School.<br /><br />What follows: the mourning time at the mountain lake, sister Valentine's (played by Abigail Breslin) calming influence, Ender's return, the battle to end the war, all follow with progressively grand vision. All the folk we grow to love in the book: Mazer Rackham, Bean, Petra, are there.<br /><br />The small additions, mostly from Xenocide and Children of the Mind (v. 3 and 4 of the quintet - see [[ASIN:0812550706 Ender's Game (The Ender Quintet)]]) do not seriously detract from the primary story. Criticism by some of the negative reviewers on the basis of lack of development of the Peter/Valentine tension or Enders future role as Speaker for the Dead are out of place since those plotlines are not as greatly developed in the original story as they are in the later books.<br /><br />I rate this as a five star movie. You don't get all the dialogs that are in the book and some scenes are contracted or expanded but it works much better than most adaptations of sci fi books. Music is as fantastic as the special effects, but it is shadowed by the deep psychological play between the characters and within their respective psyches.thing any reader of the original book could imagine and more.

B00CH3DBNQ|4.0|As I read this now, Pakistan and Afghanistan are in the news media. The book does give insight to the culture of the people and the struggles they are going through between a corrupt Pakistani government and the Taliban.  There is also good geographical descriptions of the countries. A brave young woman who will no doubt become an influential political figure in her country.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|I loved the original Star Trek with Capt Kirk and Spock and this was a really good spin off of the original series. This was exciting and entertaining. I really liked the young Kirk and young Spock. Good movie.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I wanted a convenient and low cost set of the Indian Jones movies and this set did the trick.  I got all of the movies in a nice container that I can add to my movie collection.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Believe it or not, this was basically a love story. I absolutely loved it. The characters were delightful and the ending will leave you sighing for happiness. Good movie for the whole family.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I thought this was a good book. I judge that by if you cry, get mad, etc. along with the characters. There were a few chapters that I lost interest in, but most of all, a great read. The ending, a shocker, but good.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Fun missions that alternate being  challenging and easy. Also short explanations about each creature are informative. Three different parks in one game.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|it doesn't give you any clear instructions. I couldn't find how to play at a slower speed so I could learn the game.
B008133MDK|4.0|Fantastic series!! Loved season 1 more than season 2 but really amazingly written and acted.  Can't wait to see more.
B002HHPVHQ|4.0|This book is best read in hard cover or paperback - not on a Kindle.  There are a lot of footnotes that interrupt the flow of the story since you didn't see them coming.  Also footnotes are best when you can go back and reference the points they address which isn't always easy on a Kindle.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|Some books make sitting on the beach, on a tropical island during winter vacation, extra-memorable.  This is one of those books.<br /><br />Take it with you on vacation.  You'll spend a lot more time smiling.  Give yourself time to adjust to the style... it's different and can be off-putting at first.  Keep going... very soon it clicks and you cannot get enough.<br /><br />“Good Omens” super-Brit narrative (give it some time) speaks right to the reader (give it some time) turns out to be one of the funniest reads around.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|really addictive but even my 3 year old loves to laugh at this game. great buy- would recommend to everyone.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this  game. It is challenging and fun! Some levels are hard to conquer but I continue to try and am entertained  Moore than any game I have tried. Sandy
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|The action and drama in this show is just fantastic.  And I like how they've added a bit a humor now with season 4.  Plus, I'm picking up all sorts of good tips for when the real zombie apocalypse comes.  Education and entertainment.  Win-win!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I cried. A lot.<br />I absolutely cannot wait for veronica to spit another book out.<br />Nor can I wait for the movies!<br />The ideas are fascinating.and the emotions and delemas are very real life. This series is hard. Hard to read and relate to and understand. Because it is very real. It all COULD be real. I could see  this happening. And it's terrifying.
0553381709|4.0|Martin has yet to stand the test of time but if he keeps heading in this direction and is able to not rush the story and eventually pull every thing together he will find himself on the same shelf as Tolkien
B00DJWV11I|5.0|This is my first book review ever. I must say that this book had just about everything I was looking for after reading the same ol' same ol' in search for a great book that would leave an impression. I found one!! I enjoy books that have characters that you feel like you know and can relate to. The story is laugh out loud funny, romantically sweet and hot, hot, hot. All the things I love in a contemporary romance. Outstanding read! If you're tired of reading the same predictable CR stories then READ this book. It will not disappoint. It broke the boring read cycle for me. Now back on the hunt in search for another gem.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I am about half way through this book. So far I really like it. Thank you Mr. Martin for letting us get inside the mind of Cersei - sort of I think. That cool, calm, and languid person we have see so far . . . Well you won't believe what goes on inside her head. I do miss Tyrion. His words, quips, quotes, and observations were really funny but the funniest and sometimes wisest things he kept inside his head. His humor had bite but not the cruelty that Cersei's has. That woman is completely messed up.<br /><br />The only characters that I found NOT interesting were the &#34;drowned&#34; guys. But I read them anyway and felt cold and clammy at the end of their chapters.<br /><br />I appreciate the way Mr. Martin wrote book 4 - I really needed to be let down - gently - after the intense, drama and action of book 3 that set my brain on fire. So, I appreciate the cool down after the nuclear book 3.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|One of the most charming films I ever saw! It teach you the meaning of friendship and loyalty. Thanks Amazon for help me to get it.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Love this app. It's great that I can check the weather anywhere at any time. It's a plus to have the local time display as well as a beautiful screen to look at.
B005HIEFC4|5.0|Best movie close to reality,  Great for relationship association and to work out other issues between partners. get it now!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Creative and inventive plot.  Watched with family and all of us were pulled in trying to figure out the how, why and what next?
0553374842|5.0|If you loved the Star Wars movies, this is a must have book for you! It takes you to many places lime Tatooine, the Death Star, Alderaan and so much more. The illustrations are amazing, the descriptions from Kevin J Anderson take you to these worlds in a way the movies couldn't do! You will find yourself looking through these pages again and again!
B00FPH6M82|3.0|Not Will Smiths best. The acting wasn't horrible, but the story line seemed to be missing something. Glad I waited to see it on DVD.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|****SPOILERS CONTAINED IN THIS REVIEW****<br /><br />WOW - not sure this is a good time to review this having literally only just finished reading it. I now have to try and review this without giving away too many spoilers re the ending.<br /><br />I decided not to read Insurgent after I'd finished Divergent (I did start this series late so both books were already out when I started) as I wanted to be able to read the second and third books straight after each other - and I am so glad that I did.<br /><br />Allegiant starts pretty much straight after Insurgent finishes and find that Tris is still branded a traitor and being kept apart from everyone along with Christina. Eventually a small group of rebels begins to form in response to the factionless regime implemented by Evelyn. Some of these then decide to leave the city and see what lies outside the city boundaries - including Tris, Four, Uriah, Cara & Caleb (saving him from being executed). There they finally find out the history of the world and what led them to be in Chicago to begin with.<br /><br />Although at first it seems like the 'Bureau' are the good guys it soon emerges that they aren't any better than Jeannine Matthews or the factionless. Of course things eventually come to a head where big decisions have to be made which will affect not only their own lives but the lives of everyone.<br /><br />The ending of the book took me completely by surprise and seems to fly in the face of convention with series of this genre. This was an extremely brave choice made by Veronica Roth and, I would hazard a guess, not an easy one to make. Knowing that there would be a lot fans of the series who would, for want of a better word, be outraged by her decision. I'm not one them. I thought the ending was fitting with the character of Tris and the culmination of the journey that she had been on from the start of the series. It was completely in character for her to do what she did - I could see her decision coming after aconversation she had with Caleb. Finally she was able to do the right thing for the right reason which showed incredible growth on her part.<br /><br />I also loved the switch in point of views from Tris to Four giving the story a whole new dimension and from this we were able to see his growth as a person too. In fact, in this book we kind of see a switch in the characters with Four acting out like Tris did in Insurgent.<br /><br />This was an amazing finish to a great series and I cannot wait to see how the film version compares. I know there are a lot of people who won't the like ending and say that this spoiled the series for them. For me personally, I do not feel that way and think that Veronica hit a home run with this one.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Not a fan of the author and rarely do I read scifi but all in all it was a good story that was fun to read and I would recommend others to read it.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|A clever movie that moves fast. I found the end came up a little short of perfection but well worth your time.
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|I must admit - I can take Cher or leave her for the most part.  But this album is awesome - usually you buy an album and like a few songs - every son on this album is great.  Worth buying!
B00ECR7KX2|5.0|Seeing as I have a semi-obsessive nature toward this play, the movie is a must.  Also, in the cast commentary some of the members are playing a drinking game which makes it hilariously different from many other commetaries.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a great game and this is a great app but it needs updating! The levels only go to 440 and I'm on 456!
B003L77GGK|5.0|Wonderful for fans of the series.  Art of the discs is well balanced for the well acted season.  Great gag reel as always!
B00BXKOMT6|5.0|Blood Song, the first in a fantasy series titled Raven's Shadow, takes the reader on a trip through the intricacies of a world of wars, interfaith conflicts, intrigue and battle. The societies, geography and political structures developed by the author are all very believable.<br /><br />As regular readers of my reviews will know, I care deeply about character in fiction. This book does not let the reader down. The characters, and there are many, live. All are flawed in their own ways; all are individuals. No stereotypes here.<br /><br />For reasons I won't bore you with, I was unable to read this book in a short time. The extended time period was nothing to do with the book but only reduced my enjoyment in the sense that I found myself impatient to get back to it as soon as I was able. The story certainly held my attention.<br /><br />This is a book that will suit those who like their fantasy to involve battles, unusual friendships, a background love story, minor references to a form of magic and details of fights and weapons. But it has an added theme that interested me a great deal: the book examines religion and its association with various gods. It analyses faith and hints strongly at the lack of validity in many claims made by religions. This is done through story, rather than through the less attractive type of proselytising sometimes evident in books that touch on religious matters. So, it's thought-provoking as well as entertaining.<br /><br />I found I grew more and more attached to the main protagonist as he fought his way through the many barriers placed in his way. The pace is good throughout and description is generally limited to those aspects that require explanation. There are many evocative scenes and a great deal of variety in location and setting, making the journey both interesting and engaging.<br /><br />I enjoyed the read. It's a long book, typical of the genre in the sheer volume of words and pages. Good value for money. I recommend it to all who love fantasy and suggest those who have so far avoided this genre might try this as an introduction to how good such storytelling can be.
006202406X|5.0|Allegiant was a good read; the characters take on surprising changes in this final book as well as seeing new twists and turns.  The ending was sad but fitting considering the plot by bringing about the true character of each person.  The book did hold my interest and it was hard to put it down once I started reading it.  It is always sad when you know it is the last book of the trilogy.  I can't wait to see what Veronica Roth will write next.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|This book is everything I hoped it would be and more. Allie never fails to make me laugh and she has this amazing way of making me see myself more clearly. Her drawings may not look like much at first glance, but their expressive faces are spot on. I love everything about this book, especially the rainbow pages!
B0092SQ5EG|4.0|I am not what you would call a Katy Perry fan. I have found most of her music pretty predictable pop, but in this movie she comes across as a very engaging and sympathetic character-- a real person-- who has a very interesting story. It also shows her in many scenes without all her makeup, looking like a normal girl you might pass on the street. She obviously has a good head on her shoulders and has surrounded herself with good people, including members of her family. I would recommend this movie-- you will find you like Katy Perry!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great! Loads fast and plays as well as it does on my laptop. Don't have to wait until I get home to play.
B00ARF92HK|4.0|I enjoyed the movie.  Not all &#34;hollywooded-out&#34; like the Stallone version was (and the way the previous Batman series got).  This was just a gritty, dirty, in-your-face action movie.  The story was there (not amazing but served the purpose), and the characters stayed true to form without necessarily being stereotypical.  Funny watching this-and then Star Trek: Into Darkness right after each other and seeing Urban in such different roles.<br />The violence was excessive-if you have a problem with that sort of thing (I do not).  But I think that it all fit within the story.  The place they were was a bad place and bad things happen there.  I'd definitely watch it again.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I just deleted this from my android do to pop ads. Hoping that doesn't happen here . If anyone knows how to stop pop up ads on android razr please share so I can reinstall on phone
B008C20TDG|3.0|I've tried the Whole30... but also have an autoimmune disease and tons of food intolerances (especially severe reaction to gluten) so really was limited to just meat, some veggies, and some fruits. Per their autoimmune protocol = no eggs (I'm allergic anyway), no beans, no soy, no nuts & seeds, no rice ...  It's just too restrictive. Oh -- and I'm a business traveller.<br /><br />The real issue was also eliminating beans plus nuts & seeds (per the autoimmune protocol). I decided to eat nuts and seeds... and when I'm in the Middle East I eat hummus and tahini. It seems a food culture I'm not allergic to so I was eating too many nut products before I did the plan, probably. (Peanut butter & hummus were daily staples.)<br /><br />The book and plan definitely made me think in a new, healthier way about food even though I did not stick to the plan exactly.<br /><br />I'm also seeing people stick to it in a way so extreme it's not healthy -- they're losing far too much weight & not being very balanced in their thinking/approach. Maybe it's easier in the US, too, I'm overseas and it's tricky to get some ingredients you can get at Whole Foods... so organic meats, etc. are tricky here.<br /><br />As a result, I'm not sure this is the safest or smartest of ways to approach food. I see the value for folks who don't already know how their body reacts to food. For me, I wasn't eating anywhere near enough on the plan and I'm seeing that with others, too. It's too restrictive, too difficult, not a healthy, balanced approach. I'm not convinced of all their arguments, though it's still better than most Western docs' approach, in my experience.
B000IMKDPC|5.0|I watched it first when it just came out in 2000 and watched it again now with my 3 kids. We enjoyed every minute of it.
B00FOWX6NM|1.0|The clear plastic is scratched up and low quality.  Using this cover makes my new iPhone 5S look a lot cheaper.  The color is also much browner than the pretty gold iPhone color.
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|Lorde could sing the ABC's and make them sound good. Her voice is absolutely stunning, and this album proves it!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This novel was well written intriguing, and kept me glued to each<br />page. I look forward to another one, as I always buy his books.
1885167776|5.0|At the beginning of 2013 I committed to reading at least two nonfiction books a month. Twenty five books later this book is the one that made the biggest difference form me. The &#34;One Thing&#34; way of thinking applies to every area of my life. I would recommend this book. I got a 2nd copy because I wanted to reread the book after I loaned my original to a friend.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I  love the book all it did was make me feel how It is to get picked on I will read it again
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is amazing!  The graphics are so beautiful and the puzzles are really well thought out.  I can't wait for the The Room 2.
B004SIP9Z6|5.0|Awesome movie. Love that film style of mixing b/w with color. Mickey Rouke and Bruce Wills had great roles in this movie
B00DIJQAI6|3.0|I'm so bummed this game is so hard to use.  I used to love this game as a kid but with touch screen technology it's just too hard to use.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I ordered 2 of them.  The first one worked great, but the second would not boot.  Amazon immediately did the RMA thing and replaced it in 3 days, so no complaint there.  However, I'm a little nervous about Google's quality control.  When they work, they work great.  Great way to add Netflix to the kitchen TV.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|It took a while for me to get into this book.  I found the later chapters to be more engaging and at times a bit enraging, not at the author but at the stupidity of her sentence.  Being sent to prison for carrying ONE suitcase is not only beyond ridiculous, it just doesn't make sense.  She has a nice way of pointing out everything wrong with the American justice system, if you even want to call it justice.  The author felt so guilty for something that I don't even think was a crime.  At all.  I feel like she was pressured to feel guilty for being a lesbian and hanging out with people selling drugs.  I found part of her soul searching forced and not real.  The other inmate seemed a bit more real, such as Pop.  I would really like to know what happened to her.  And the cousins who were being flown to Florida and they didn't know why.<br /><br />Overall, it was good book to discuss with friends and a great speaking point about the reforms which are needed in the country.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Thus book was spool good. I loved it all. It was the perfect but sad end to the series. Veronica Roth is a really good author. :)
B007PVHMCG|4.0|I thought my kids would go nuts over this, but let's face it - it's not Minecraft. It's Legos.<br /><br />BUT - it was the perfect cake topper for a square Minecraft cake. Just frosted it in chocolate, piped some grass frosting as a border - and voila! Minecraft themed cake.<br /><br />The pieces are tiny and it breaks apart easily because of this. This entire set, when put together, is very small - maybe a 5 inch cube at best. I can't believe the price on it - you're paying a LOT for the brand/game name.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|the game was highly addicting. The graphics are fine. The rate of progress in the game is quite slow, but not in a bad way. The real problem with this game and what lead to me deleting it are the 75mb updates. It would literally take me a few days worth of attempts before it would successfully download and install. And BTW, I have full speed cable internet and used Wifi while sitting about 5 feet from the router. Bottom line: the game is a blast, but it's nearly impossible to keep playing. What in the hell were they thinking with a 75mb update? Call of Duty doesn't even have updates that big.
B00G9U7R2O|4.0|Not nearly as good as the first one but well worth the price of admission. All your favorites are back except for Boo.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|OMG - I already finish reading this one. When is &#34;Captivated by You&#34; going to be release? I couldn't put it down
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|Excellent character , I did not guess the killer.  Big surprise at the end.  Convoluted , but good background on characters.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I enjoy reading this series. I got hooked quick w/ the characters. Can't wait to start reading the next one.
B006JRS4GA|5.0|One of my favourite seasons ever. Everybody are so innocent and young. Love it so much! Cory we miss you.
0375831002|5.0|It was perfect! I bought it used, but you'd never know since the hardback is perfect and the cover is just brilliant!!
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|This album is awesome. There isn't a song I don't love! I've liked Kanye's work for a long time but this album has made me a super fan. Cannot wait to see what he does next!
B00F91RYL8|1.0|Imagine I am legend. Now take away a cohesive plot, character development, and substitute a few cool cgi effects, most of which you have seen in the trailer. That is wwz.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've downloaded this game on every device I own...cannot get enough! Was so excited when this game was finally available for the kindle!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved this story. Although it made me sad at times, I could not stop reading. The real-life issues discussed made me think twice about my personal opinions....that alone makes for a great novel. Read Me before You!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The saga continues to develop the characters, family dynamic, and environment of the times to satisfaction till the shocking, unexpected climax. Now I'm left wondering - where will the story go from here?
B006RXQ1L6|5.0|fast shipping and received as described. good price. Would order again in the future. Brand new. For those of you who haven't seen this is a great musical.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game. Well really make you think. Challenging and fun. Can not wait for more levels. Try it today and think outside the box.
B00DHHWXYY|3.0|The movie was just ok. Also there was something wrong with the disc and we couldn't view the entire movie.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I thought it was awesome. I liked the background it give for the characters. Zachary Quinto looked good as Spock.
B00127RAJY|2.0|I can only say two good things about this video and they're both kind of the same thing:<br /><br />1. It is challenging<br />2. It is probably effective<br /><br />I have been physically active my entire life.  My parents had me in dance lessons by the time I was 2-years-old.  I danced past high school and remained active afterward.  I am now 30-years-old.  I am no stranger to working out.  I know the importance of reps and strength training combined with aerobics but COME ON!  This video, while challenging, is pretty much like my high school gym classes.<br /><br />Jumping jacks.<br />Push-ups.<br />Fake jump roping.<br />Crunches.<br /><br />It lacks character and variety as the same movements are used over and over.  I get so bored I can hardly stand it.  When you are working out and having fun, you don't think so much about how you feel tired or your muscles are sore but with this work out, you feel every. last. rep. because you are SO bored!  I put it away for a year.  This morning, I thought I'd give it another try to make sure I really didn't like it.  Yep.  I popped it into the DVD player and walked away about 8 minutes later.<br /><br />I have never seen 'The Biggest Loser' so I was not familiar with Jillian Michaels' style before I bought this DVD.  She will begin a movement and do maybe 2 or 3 reps and then stand up and start walking around the room, calling her models \\"Buddy.\\"  It's weird.  I get the sense that even Jillian Michaels is bored out of her mind.<br /><br />If this is your style, then by all means, you'll be happy and I'm sure you'll see results.  If you are used to variety in your workouts - if you like to have fun and learn new things, this isn't your video.  Just do jumping jacks, crunches and push-ups on your own and save yourself 9 bucks plus shipping
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I tried the free one and liked it a lot. I bought the paid version because  I wanted to listen to my music as the alarm. Awesome alarm app.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the best game I have ever played in my whole entire life. I love to play it. it is addicting
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I chose this as a 5 star read as I could not out the book down. I loved how all the characters lives intertwined. It reminds me a little of the writer Mauve Binchey. I will look forward to reading more from this author.
B000Q6ZG5M|5.0|Good movie beginning of something great. I recommend this to anyone that read the books or supernatural movie genre fans.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Best game ever .l can not stop playing it<br /><br />The levels get hard and  harder,but if you keep trying you will neat the levels
B003YHSE7W|5.0|Iron Man 2 is an awesome movie and everyone would love this movie. Machine suit, explosions, super villains what's not to like.
193700788X|5.0|good i like that this is good book very nice Sookei and Sam be lovers and be best friends si love him
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really enjoy the game now that I don't have to sit at my computer to play it. Only wish I could use points from Facebook to unlock levels. Great job.
B00477X6DA|1.0|You know I was expecting to get a simple watch phone In the male.  THAT IS NOT WHAT I GOT. I got a complicated PEICE of plastic. It does not come with a stop watch!! It took me five hours to get the actual device into the watch strap. You can't charge it while it is in watch form. The only. Way to get it out of watch form is using a clip. Very time I took the watch out of it to charge it got scraped by the clip. It disconnects every five minutes. When I finally got used to the watch it fell apart. DO NOT BUY THIS PEICE OF GARBAGE.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|Wasn't really what I was expecting. The movie seemed to move too fast and didn't really explain everything. I would have liked to see a more complete ending.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Sure liked the story line and the special affects were amazing but not overdone.  Will see part two for sure.
B00DU73T08|4.0|Pretty good movie. I can't say that it'll make it to my favorites list, but it was worth the watch.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I like the game but around level 23 I didn't feel that I could pass the level without paying for a boost.  should be able to pass any level without a paid boost.
B00571F26Y|4.0|it's so confusing and hard for me to understand all the lingo he writes. i just want to know how too go without wheat .
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I HATED the ending. HATED IT. Up until then, it was very, very good. But this book broke my heart in many, very bad ways. I loved this series, but I was so disappointed in the ending that I don't even know if I can watch the movie without thinking about it. I think the end has spoiled the whole series for me. Why, Veronica Roth, why???
B00EDPFJA4|5.0|With this lastest album critics states this is an \\"Album for the decades\\" unlike most stars of YMCMB(tm) Drake makes music not only targeted for the hip hop community he targets an INTERNATIONAL AUDIENCE. This album is worth every penny. Drake killed it with this one. With his undefianable creativity and uniqueness Drake deserves to be mainstream. Just know after leaving critically acclaimed recording label YMCMB(tm) Nothing Was The Same...
B00BSB2AE4|3.0|Anyone who's read her website already knows 75% of the stories in this book. They're still hysterically funny - the story about moving with her dogs is reason to buy it - but if you're looking for a ton of new material, this isn't it. I was disappointed.
B00AEBB9EG|5.0|I saw this in the theatre when it came out and this dvd is a example of how good movies used to be before all the special effects took over. I always liked the line by Faye Dunaway when Robert Redford asked her if he had hurt her or raped her and she replied &#34; the night is young”  Sidney Pollock made good movies.
B005544TRQ|5.0|good. I like it. Good show.  Real good show.  It was a show I thought was really good.  Good show.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is certainly unique from other running games and its got fun power ups it really interoperate a lot
B003F3FJQO|4.0|Great read for  both teens and adults!!! After my son started reading the series I decides to give it a go and I was pleasantly surprised!!!
B003WUYRGI|1.0|U have to look for It your self. BORING! U need to make it so we can type in the word we r looking for please
0307394549|3.0|Beautiful book, and well organized. But so far, three out of the four recipes we've tried have been disasters. Disappointing for sure.
B009NXV2RK|5.0|Full of action. No slow parts. Working in the IT field myself, it makes it all the more believable -almost. NSA listening perhaps?
B004J4WKTW|4.0|The beginning was a little slow, but I was enchanted with the story and the character development.  This was not a &#34;fast food&#34; type of book that you could rush through, but a little more thought-provoking.  It fits perfectly with my personal beliefs that everything in the universe affects everything else
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|We thought it sounded like a good idea. We have a Netflix subscription and were able to hook it up and watch a couple of movies but we had a hard time adjusting the sound quality. During normal dialog, you could barely make out what they were saying, then an action scene would suddenly arise with music so loud you have to turn down the volume. We could never get adjusted. We were too frustrated to enjoy the movies. We don't have that problem watching TV movies normally. Also, we noticed on several occasions that the device had changed the settings on our TV, so we had to get out a different remote that came with the TV and re-adjust things back to the way we liked. I unplugged the device yesterday and filed it away under M for mistakes.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this app! I play nothing else!! it honestly is so much fun to play and the levels just keep getting harder!
B008JFUR10|4.0|So how does one rate a movie like this?  I see comments about no character development, shallow stories, and so on.  If you compare this to 'Lincoln' or similar movies and consider a rating to be based on things like character development, realistic motivations and emotion, and how 'Best Picture Oscar Worthy' a movie is, then Pacific Rim is obviously a 1.  But then again, so are most movies ever made.<br /><br />Instead, I choose to rate this within the &#34;Big, Dumb, Plotless, Loud, Action Movie&#34; category, because that's what it is.  And within that category, it's actually somewhat smarter than most with a relatively coherent plot.<br /><br />Sure, the science is absolutely the worst kind of technobabble, but no more than much of what you see in any Star Trek movie/episode.<br /><br />Sure, the characters are pretty stereotypical, but there are some interesting twists - including one I never saw coming but in retrospect it made perfect sense - amongst the more predictable elements.<br /><br />The way the movie starts is brilliant.  Most movies require a long setup... And if this had been like most movies, you would wait for 30 minutes to see the first monster, and probably another hour before you saw the first giant robot designed to fight the monster.  That doesn't happen here.<br /><br />The action is top notch in the beginning and end of the movie.  The story drags a bit in the middle, but this is the case in a lot of films, and it's not too badly done in any event.  The acting is average to good for the most part even if slightly over the top at times.<br /><br />At the end of the day, this is a movie that ranks up there with Independence Day and Armageddon as 'guilty pleasures' for me, and it has enough changes to the usual formula to go along with the truly spectacular action, to be worth recommending.  Just don't expect it to win an Oscar for Best Picture.  As long as you're ok with giant robots fighting giant monsters, you'll be entertained and maybe even just a bit surprised.
0385341008|5.0|This epistolary novel is like reading an onion. Each letter peels a layer (or two) off the sender and, sometimes, the recipient. It is set<br />on an island off England which is occupied during WW II by the Germans. But, the human characters are timeless. Like many good books, rereading also pays handsome dividends.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|Great for workouts--cardio and weights, any kind of exercise.  I've used it during biking, running, abs, etc.; very, very peppy!
B005ERIRZE|5.0|The implications of neuroscience for will power are many and varied, and the author brings all of them (presently known) into play in a breezy, example-filled, narrative. While the book has numerous practical suggestions, I found it interesting for the surprise applications of recent neuroscience research and experiments. These insights are laid out in  easily understandable packets of<br />informal prose, so using this book to induce sleep is not an option. I recommend it without reservation to anyone who has will power and want s to understand it better, or to anyone who wants it.
B007N8RULO|3.0|I enjoy this game when it works, but every day or so it just won't open and I have to reboot my Kindle to make it work again.  Maybe it's a memory cache thing, but whatever it is, it's annoying, when I want to play a quick game in line or something and have to wait for my Kindle to restart.  If it weren't for this issue, I'd rate this four stars, maybe even five.  It is a lot of fun when it works.<br /><br />By the way, this is my sixth uninstall/install.  Previous times, I couldn't even get it to work with rebooting and had to uninstall the app then redownload it from the cloud.  Another reason for the lower rating.
B00E1LQ7Q0|4.0|I don't think I really liked the packaging of this CD, but I do like the fact that it was available for automatic download so that I didn't have to wait for the CD to arrive before I could listen to it.  Overall, it's a pretty decent CD.  I've always been a fan of Justin Timberlake and his last CD FutureSex/LoveSounds was an excellent CD.  20/20 has a more jazzy feel, which I like a lot especially in Mirrors, Pusher Love Girl, Take Back The Night and TKO.
B005ZI2X4I|5.0|Collier continues his series of wonderful childrens' books.  Children will love this story of snow men and snow alligators.  Definitely one to add to your collection.
B000002LND|5.0|OMG, this album by Madonna has a lot of my favorite songs from the 80's.  I tell everyone that I'm an 80's girl and this album signifies just that.  The 80's had great music and talented singers like Madonna.  I saw an interview by Eva Longoria and she was asked if stranded on a desert island and you only had one album to listen to, what would it be?  Her reply was &#34;Immaculate Collection&#34; by Madonna...now I can see why she said that, it would be an album I wouldn't mind listening to over and over again either!
B006RZFACU|5.0|I must have over a dozen of Collier's books and they are all fantastic short bedtime reads.  The trick to reading his book is to read them in rhyme, like you are reading to a child.  The story takes on a whole new life when you do that.  Collier has a natural gift for writing amusing, light stories that your children or grandchildren will love.  I recommend any of his books.
1592537251|5.0|I check the online URBANSKETCHERS website frequently and love this book.  I seem to be stuck on this book and leaving others behind.  The level of skill among the sketchers ranges from just above my ability to a true artist.  I love the way some sketchers use very few lines and just a small splash of color to convey the scene.  Fantastic book - if you love sketching you will love the book ... and the website.
B00CEF014E|5.0|If you like psychological thrillers that don't go one forever but keep you biting at every turn of the page then Solstice is the novella for you.  I don't give away plots or spoilers but I will say that it involves ancient rituals, sacrifices and one woman's struggle to maintain her own sanity as she tries to get to the bottom of what happened to her boyfriend. Stevenson does an excellent job at having the reader wonder if the main character, Dana, is living in reality or a world distorted by medication and depression.  Very well written, Stevenson draws you in with enough details that you can see, hear and feel what is happening around the main character. I loved this story
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's fast, keeps your brain occupied, keeps you interested in the different levels and graphics to match, and I just really like to play.  It is my favorite game.
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|If you liked the first Kingdom Rush you will LOVE this awesome sequel! Well worth the price for the hours of gameplay and pure fun of killing things. Highly recommended.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|Interesting; cool effects; a little confusing at times; camera work was sometimes obnoxious as it moved around elliptically -- kind of quickly.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|I love every song on this album.  The quality of the recording is wonderful and Adele has such a beautiful voice!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|We really enjoy this series and have ordered all the rest. We are getting addicted with this series. Highly recommend.
034580404X|5.0|This Book is HOT HOT HOT!  Cannot put it down!  A must read!  Hope E L James will write more!!  Excellent! I have even reread this.  More please!
B0002YLC24|5.0|I love both this film and the original Before Sunrise. If you like intelligent conversation filled movies, this is fantastic.
0553106635|5.0|love it. finding the hardcover without the hbo promo was difficult, but exactly what i wanted. recommend this to everyone.
B003QSLDTA|4.0|My five and a half year-old loved this movie! And I gotta say, I love anywhere I can see Mark Harmon!
0553108034|5.0|love it. finding the hardcover without the hbo promo was difficult, but exactly what i wanted. recommend this to everyone.
B00DJZR46G|3.0|Elton John will never ever sound vocally or even remotely musically like he did in the 70's.  For those of you like me who bought this thinking maybe things were going to get better and Elton would sound like he did in his heyday, you are going to be disappointed.  The songs on this album plod along a track and never seem to go anywhere.  Elton simply cannot hit the high notes like he did when he was younger and even his keyboard playing reflects this.  As far as the quality, music will never sound as good as it did before anyway because of the way engineers record music all on the same level now with no dynamic range.  Bernie Taupin's lyrics have changed as well so you cannot expect the same sort of songs that were produced back in the 70's either.  Elton has always bragged that he can write a song in less than an hour.  I'm afraid it's starting to show.  That's hard to say because I've been a fan of his since I was a teenager - back when Elton used to be a real showman and do handstands on his piano.  We cannot expect that sort of drive from Elton anymore.  He's aged and his music has aged but not as well as we would have liked it to.
0553103547|5.0|love it. finding the hardcover without the hbo promo was difficult, but exactly what i wanted. recommend this to everyone.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Chromecast was fairly simple to set up and use. The battery power drain on my ios device is extremely minimal when using. Also, I found it to work great from the Chrome browser on my MacBook Pro. The price is ridiculously competitive (why I decided against Apple TV). 4/5 only because the list of compatible apps is so minimal right now, can't wait to see more development on this device!
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|I got the seventh, page did the ass first around  slender then I fell through the world<br />It sucked .. I was confused but it's a  Good game<br />M
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|Entertaining, but not a great plot: overdone with too many super heroes, the villain didn't seem fit for the job, and most of the talking was petty...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|If I could give more than 5 stars for Candy Crush, I would.  It is one of the most addicting game ever. Hands down!!
B009E2WX3W|5.0|Amazing album. One of my favorite albums of all time. Every song is perfect. I hope more people discover Peter Gabriel.
B005NKGEP2|5.0|Great writing! Funny too. I really enjoyed this book. Complex story that didn't give away the ending in advance so kept me turning the pages until I was done. I know I love a book if I am sorry that I've reached the ending and that was the case with this book.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|This game really is pretty awesome. It's relaxing, mellow, and the perfect end to a long day. It's a &#34;find things in the painting story&#34; type game, but does it well as you explore the world and solve other puzzles along the way. They really did a good job, and for .99 cents it really is a nice game!
1444777556|5.0|It was the follow up sequel to A cat named Bob and it's an easy reading book.  I loved to follow the adventures of James and Bob.  Together they make a great pair and hope they both succeed in life.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Good but not shocking. Love a happy ending though! Glad I finally read the series. Would recommend for those looking for dome love and excitement.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is addicting!  I can't ever stop playing until my lives are gone. I do wish it were easier to earn the extra help pieces.
B00632HWOG|1.0|I don't like how they group all the emails together and get rid of the &#34;me&#34; in the listing.  Who came up with that anyway?  The setup you had previous to this one was just fine---go backl to it.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Love the graphics.  Really simple but lots of fun.  Uncomplicated logic puzzles.  An adorable game no matter how young or old you are!
B0002ADXYI|5.0|Brings back memories of being a rocker in the 70's, complete with patched Levi's.  Humility is necessary only when one is 'forced' to beg.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Decided to find out what all the buzz was about and purchased this book for my Kindle.  Some hot sex scenes for those with an interest in BDSM.  Beyond the sex is a weakly written, implausible plot with one dimensional characters.  No one is as young, wealthy and perpetually horny as Christian Grey and no modern 22 year old woman today is as naïve as Ana Steele.  It will be interesting to see how the movie turns out.  Otherwise save your money.  There is much better written Mf sexual material available.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|LOVE THIS SERIES OF STORIES. JUST WAITING FOR 11-22-13 SO THAT I CAN SEE THE NEXT INSTALLMENT IN THE THEATER AND THEN WILL BE PURCHASING THAT DVD TOO!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Good set of short stories but I expected more from Hosseini after reading his other books. Just expected something more of a novel.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Brad Pitt does a great job. Not your typical zombie movie. Entertaining fiction. I watched this while spending the night in an empty LAX terminal after missing my flight. Kinda spooky.
B008JFUPOY|5.0|this movie is funny very funny I laughed so hard my side hurt I have watched it twice already and I love it .if you loved monsters inc then you will love this movie .
B000N2HBSO|5.0|First rate writing, research, and story telling. As Goodwin's book title emphasizes, he was able to gather some of the most skilled politician/statesmen around him in order to build an unparalleled team of people in the shadow of the most difficult period in the country's history. Lincoln's ability to put his ego completely aside and build loyalty to his cause in his cabinet (a group of egotistical but brilliant men) in order to accomplish what were ultimately amazing feats is amazing.<br />Important history that everyone should read. We badly need a Lincoln now, but. Thank you, Ms. Goodwin, for bringing Lincoln and his contemporaries to such vivid life!
B0036TGT2A|5.0|I bought this blue-ray as a gift and my girlfriend loved it. If I had more stars to rate this purchase I would, so here they go ★☆★☆★☆★☆★☆★☆★☆<br /><br />#underthesea #legsweremeant4walking #littlemermaid
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great science fiction with a thought-provoking moral dilemma.  Its amazing that the original story was written several decades ago, it has held up extremely well.  I think that's the mark of a classic!  If you enjoy science fiction and a good story, read the book.  I think its  particularly appropriate for young adults.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This device works well. Easy to use. I hope more applications utilize it in the near future. I definitely recommend.  Cheap way to turn your hdtv into a smart tv.
B003G4W49C|4.0|A few twists and turns and surprises here and there made this a good book. Also, the intriguing overall plot about a world desperately seeking a child soldier to save them all from a common enemy. Not the greatest piece of literature of all time; but compelling: a good thought-provoking escape. Read it b/c I saw a movie trailer for it a few weeks ago. Glad I did. Now I get to go see the movie and see how they did.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|A really fun game to play on a rainy day. Or at work. Or on the toilet. I recommend it.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|The Shining (the book) entered my life when I was too young to be reading books like The Shining. I went to the movie version with my mother and grandmother, and the one time they clapped hands over my eyes was when the naked woman came out of the tub.(I could tell stories about the discrepancy between their treatment of sex and violence.)<br /><br />King said in an interview, at least I remember him as having done so, that Danny would grow up to be an abusive alcoholic, which I admired for the realism of that -- statistically, probably. It seems, though, that King came around to see something better for Danny, now Dan. Once that, psychic vampires aside, is also plausible.<br /><br />I liked this version, where he finds sobriety and a calling. I'm not as sure that the huge coincidence in the book works, and the bad guys didn't feel scary, and they didn't make me worry for the good guys.<br /><br />The scariest scene was at the beginning -- the return of the dead woman from the tub -- but that got an assist from my childhood fears.<br /><br />I guess what I'm saying is that I wish that King didn't have to label this a horror novel, and could truly make it about Dan Torrance's work to guide people into death, to witness their lives and, oh, transitions. That feels like the book this was meant to be, perhaps the book the author wanted to write. Maybe that version could have been a story in his next anthology.<br /><br />Like a whole lot of other people, I considered Stephen King a part of my life, his books there for every stage of my life, other than infancy and toddlerhood. I'm always glad to spend time with him, as well as the other find writers in his family. (Tabitha King, Joe Hill, Kelly Braffet, and Owen King.) But for me, the two best novels from this family this year would be [[ASIN:B009NF6Z2K NOS4A2]] and [[ASIN:B00BE255NU Save Yourself: A Novel]]. However,last year I adored [[ASIN:B005K0HDGE 11/22/63]]. This is a wordy way to say that I liked Doctor Sleep, but the end result was too far off the mark for me.ut the end result was too far off the mark for me.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I found this finish to the series pretty good, but not really great.  I was glad there was an actual explanation as to what happened to cause this situation in the first place. However, I was somewhat disappointed in a few aspects of the story.  Most people will be upset at the ending.  Not getting the ‘happy ending’ you want tends to do that to most, however I for one think it would not have worked any other way.  I was somewhat disheartened to find out they were in an experiment and there was the rest of the world outside the town.  Based on many things mentioned in the first two books, I had this as a theory of what they were and I find being able to predict this plot twist a bit of a letdown.  I mean, that has been done so many times, I was really hoping I was wrong. That being said, the actual story of how the group gets out of the town (that most of us already knew was Chicago) is very exciting and has a good pace.  The conflict of the folks from the town against what they are being told is well done.  As the outside reader, you know there is an angle to everything they are being told but see the struggle of Tris & Four trying to figure it out.<br /><br />My major disappointment with this one is the more in the way it was written.  I have read several books from dual points of view.  In every one of them, you can usually tell which person POV you are reading from.  Sorry to say, there were many (and I mean many) times I had to remind myself or figure out from other parts of the page whose POV it was. The tone, word choices, etc. are usually different between characters in some way, especially when you have one male and one female.  Different ways of thinking, acting, etc. are one of the ways used to tell the reader about the character.  It seems like this was not held to the higher writing standards of the original book.  Yes, I know this is for YA readers, however I still expect better of the writer than this.
B00DHNBPA6|3.0|Ok movie but like most remakes , not as good as the original! Like most people I watched the film cause I liked the first one.
B0041KVXLK|5.0|This album is great! Everything that I was hoping for, plus more! I listen to it often and the inserts are a very nice feature.
B000053VAZ|5.0|A all round delightful movie with lots of laughs.....if you like Johnny Depp, you will be enchanted with his performance.  Should be a classic for him.  I only own 3 movie CD's, and this is one.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I'm very impressed how well Chromecast does to mirror your content from phone to TV. My son watches netflix from his iPod to TV with no problems.
6305428042|4.0|The perfect movie to watch with the little ones just before Halloween.The witches are a hoot and good always triumphs over evil.
B002O3Z4Y8|5.0|Kept me wondering the entire time; sad but interesting and believable. Be ready for some surprises, laughs and tears too.
B00000K3D4|4.0|Fun, family movie. The creatures are awesome. Even by today's standards. This movie is a classic that you should have in your library. David Bowie is fabulous as the goblin king.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I'm bummed that I couldn't play this game.  No specific directions so I just started tapping anything.  Got one puzzle to appear but nothing happened after I solved it.  It seems like there must be features missing...
B008RXYOKY|4.0|It works like it's supposed to, but really pricy.  I'm used to paying top dollar for apple products, but this seems a bit steep (though it's cheaper than a thunderbolt drive...)
B000GL1BHO|5.0|Love the detail on the dinosaur! My husband even said we will eventually buy the set. Also I love how durable it is. Thank you again for pulling through for us.
B005PW3OS8|5.0|Great movie to watch on Prime. One of the better Marvel movies. Entertaining with great details on the time period.
B0089LOG02|5.0|VERY interesting story, told in a way that is clear and draws you in to the times it recalls and the emotion it reflects. It also draws parallels with the present day character in a way that is subtle, yet very powerful.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is amazing but I wish it didn't take so long to regenerate. Still I highly recommended it. Love this app
B001UTW7QU|5.0|You get to enjoy the Science concepts and fall in love with the characters. It is a well written show with great acting.
B008133MDK|5.0|Well written with today's audience in mind.  The actors are excellent and the action fast moving.  Love the hat spoof.
B008N9AASC|5.0|The packaging was less than I expected; it was merely in bubble wrap in an envelope. I felt the movie was incredible. If you can handle something with no dialogue I suggest you give it a shot. Artistic, secular, and so beautiful I almost cried.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game... I can play this game for ever.. best game ever mad, anyone who didn't like this game are crazy..
B000AJIF4E|4.0|Very good quality, and clearly well-made.  The only things holding me back from 5 stars are that it's a little easier than I'd like for people in the room to hear what is being played through the headphones, and that there are no controls on the headphones or cord itself.  The latter of course I should have realized when I placed the order.  The headphones also come with a very sharp-looking Sony branded leather carrying case.
1926778537|5.0|It is very good artbook, and you can see a lot of official design of the characters in the game. If you are a fan of this game, get this artbook.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|This is certainly the best book on writing I have ever read, and it is also a wonderful memoir.  I have read it three times over the past 13 years since it came out, and gotten a lot out of it each time.  Definitely not just for Stephen King fans, although it will rekindle your interest in his fiction when you read it.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I'm not sure about this app...i have heard great things about it but for one thing, either the person takes to long to draw when you do random or they quit which is no fun.  I am thinking about deleting it...
B005K17RU0|1.0|It refuses to let me delete cities in which I have no current interest. Nothing but a whole lot of frustration.
B00DQAM5LI|5.0|If you like music that has an awesome beat and rhythm, this will definitely keep your attention and also keep your blood pumping.
B004L35GAQ|4.0|Love Awolnation's song Kill Your Heroes; which is why I bought the album. Most known for Sail. They have a couple of good songs but couldn't get into the entire list. Similar to Imagine Dragons but more like hard alternative rock.
B000V6BE6C|5.0|These guys tell stories and rock your guts out at the same time.  A must have for your collection. The beats are haunting.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Chromecast was VERY easy to set up. Allows me to &#34;cast&#34; tv shows, movies, even web pages and Youtube to my TV. Great for group settings or if you do not have cable service.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I only bought this kindle fire to play candy crush saga. When I couldn't get on here I thew it in a drawer for months...I play again it's ADDICTIVE!!
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Imagine Dragons are a great band that creates great music. Songs are indie rock that you can listen to over and over. Starting to appear on the radio more and more; most know for their song Radioactive. It's also great the the mp4 version of this album comes with it and you automatically have them on your Amazon account.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy that it finally came . Out can't put my kindle down unless it dies that how edicking it's fun and creative
B0075MFS9Y|4.0|I'm glad I purchased this album (impulse buy) because I got to know other great songs by The Lumineers instead of just their hit song &#34;Ho Hey.&#34; Great chill music.
1476727651|5.0|Awesome! Really bonded with the main character. Written vividly so that you are immersed into the story. Stand alone novel but much better after having read the prequel The Shinning. This continuation of the story did not disappoint!
0439680093|5.0|The first book of the Gatekeepers series. Piqued my interest immediately. Follows the story of a boy who is destined to save the world, but doesn't know it. Great read but must read the whole series. Intended for teens/young adults.
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|Seems like too much was left on the editing cutting floor. Story line was disjointed at times. Over half of the movie is shot in low light which makes it hard to see anything.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gillian Flynn is a new and unique writer - love her style. Gone girl is a page turner that follows the story of a young married couple and how they begin to learn things about each other that are disturbing and dangerous. After his wife goes missing, Nick finds clues into his wife's mind that leaves the reader on edge. This suspense novel is a definite read.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|The special effects were great. Characters and story line were shallow. Reminded me of I Am Legend but this movie did not come close to enveloping you into the story.
B000GWE44U|5.0|I first saw this movie when i was very little, my mother let me watch it not knowing anything about its content.  I was 7 years old.  Well, this movie left me scared for months.  Now as an adult i can appreciate how great the movie is.  From the director to the actors its one of the master pieces of cinema and one of the most freaky and scary movies ever.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|Enjoyable entertainment that you can watch at home alone without having (too many) nightmares. The scenes and ending were not too predictable.
B002C4YYEU|4.0|Fantastic magical story with a lot of heart too.  Great acting and amazing special effects.  Very entertaining from beginning to the end.
B001BANK32|5.0|Classic King. The characters grab hold of your emotions and take you for a ride. A must read before moving onto the sequel Doctor Sleep.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Certainly not as dark as its predecessor but nonetheless wonderful yarn.  I turned each page with the same dread that I did when Danny Torrence was a boy.
1423141997|5.0|My sons loved the book (and the series) and couldn't put it down.  I love anything that gets them to read.
B003PIUC02|5.0|What a master piece. Breaks my heart that Andy passed. What a talent. Show has everything I want in a very adult oriented TV show. Something crazy happens on every episode. Must see. Blu Ray looks clean and bright. Great solid soundtrack.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Nice story about families and who they are interlinked.<br />Interesting thought patterns and enjoyable read but somewhat predictable.<br />Do give it a try.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Because it was a great movie. What else can I say, You people are to much, OMG!!!!!! OMG, OMG, OMG!!!!!!!
B000VYX8PE|5.0|Solid and good and really great also very very good and no less then really good because it was the best
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Great classic movie. I think this superhero epic was well made and excellent in high definition. I payed approximately $6.00 and it was well worth it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|King took me back to the '70's when I would gobble up any book he put out. It brought me back to the pure simple storytelling of his earlier works. If you loved It, 'salem' s lot, and The Stand, this book will take you back. I couldn't put it down!  Well done, Mr king, well done!
B000PMG16U|5.0|Great deal! I saved a lot by buying it used. The Blu-ray version is really a great upgrade for what I payed.
B00AEBB8QK|5.0|I love this movie! Rented it years ago when it first came out and finally remembered the name of it! I can watch it over and over now.
B003XWEQ1G|5.0|This product was simply everything that I expected it to be. It was also in the condition promised.<br /><br />I like that I got the Blu-ray with a DVD copy for the same price as a Blu-ray without DVD in Wal-Mart.
B008HK3QII|3.0|It's not as well padded as the one I had from same maker for my old Kindle Fire. I think it's sort of bare bones for what it costs.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so awesome,but I haven't gotten passed level 13 [  :(  ]<br /><br />This game is so cool and very addicting.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|Fantastic read and captures the honest view of a soldier in combat. E.B. Sledge's candor and insight make this a must read for anyone interested military history.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's basically like temple run and subway surfers accept you buy boost buy new characters and more! Good time waster and all around fun for the whole family
140006922X|5.0|Introducing the muslim jesus. Just a man, nothing more. Characterized as a failed revolutionary. By selective reading of rejected speculations combined with isogesis (selecting a single verse or set of words out of context) and using moslem methodology, he has created someone who would be unrecognizable to biblical scholars. These scholars do not count because he deconstructs all the work on biblical texts suggesting they misunderstood Jesus, especially the Jews. Sound familiar? It is very important to read this book because it is a valuable insight into the minds of moslems, explaining why they say what they say.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Great game!  Good way to pass the time.  Not only fun, but makes you think.  Not too difficult for kids.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I think that this book is a really good book to read.  A lot of people say that this book is related to the \\"Lord Of The Flies\\", but i think that this book is much better than the so called really good book 'Lord of The Flies\\".<br /><br />  This book is very enigmatic, and really catches me and brings my thoughts into the books soul.  Reading this book makes me think about all the scenes and things and actions in the book into a movie type scene...<br /><br />  It describes about all the readers thoughts clearly and in a very catchy interesting way, to make the readers get real interested in the book...  I thought that this book was just one of the best books that i have ever read in my life, and i would strongly recommend this book to anyone whether you are in primary, middle,high school or even in college, it is a very good book to read and a lot of people will love and enjoy to read this book!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Games ok whens the update coming..only 10 levels is kinda cheap hurry up with the update don't take forever like other games..
B00992CF6W|5.0|I would recomend this product to aduts kids and teens this is the awesomest game ever (my dad LOVES it)
0142001104|5.0|This book is insightful, thought provoking and can easily be put into practice!  I couldn't put it down till I had finished.
B003YOZNBU|3.0|Story wasn't horrible. I got this during Black Friday online for .96 cents so I can't complain :) It was a decent watch.
B0088W6IMQ|4.0|It is an awesome show. Very exciting and interesting. I like the science fictiona and action types of tv show and movies
B008JFUUIA|4.0|This movie really surprised me.  It has some great lines and fun songs.  Anna Kendrick does a great job acting and singing.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the puking scenes.  The excessive puking was disturbing to watch and could have been replaced with something else (belching, perhaps).  Those are only two scenes in the movie, though, so it didn't affect the likability it too much.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a lot of fun!  You cannot put it down.  When. I get stripped I just have to keep trying until I get it.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I loved this book so much, I laughed, cried and felt such amazing  love through them. Moving to book 2.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I really love this movie! I can see it clearly and the effects are great. One of my favorites by Hayao Miyazaki!
B003G4W49C|4.0|A very quick read and entertaining.  I heard there are more books...some good, some bad.  I will look into it.
B000I5SY5U|5.0|This is possibly the best musical movie ever made. Liza Minelli's performance is amazing and moving. The filmography is beautiful. Joel Grey is also wonderful in his part as the emcee.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I like this alarm..but wish it would display the time when it's sitting in your FAVS.. I have to open it up to display the real time..
030758836X|5.0|Fabulous book.  You think you know what's going on and then it all turns around on you.  Wonderful.  I couldn 't stop reading it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is the best!  Well the better of the two I've tried... the better by far.  Very user friendly & very comfortably designed... the layout is very easy to play on.  I love it!
0375432302|5.0|Very entertaining read.  The Da Vinci Code contains enough factual information to keep your attention.  It was a very quick read for me.
B00ECU2SGS|1.0|Dull. Very slow moving. Formulaic childish plot. Dialogue for high schoolers. Couldn't finish it. Too boring. Don't waste your time.
B000093BDX|5.0|I love the Beach Boys music, so this was an obvious choice for me.  My 4-year-old is also learning the words and loves to sing and dance when it is playing.  If you like the Beach Boys music, this is a great choice to have most of their hits in one collection.
B0017XD3OY|5.0|Great movie. Will smith does a fine job in this twist on the zombie apocolipse. It will even make you cry
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Youtube is a Good app. Runs good there was no lagging. There was not a single problem with it at all
B000O599ZS|5.0|This is clearly a John Wayne/John Ford Iconic movie which keeps your attention from the time Wayne rides up to the time that the Cabin door closes behind him.  Great character portrayals by the entire cast starting from Wayne and Ward Bond all the way down the cast.  Probably one of the best Westerns ever made and I like the backdrop of Texas locales depicted throughout the story, giving it added realism.
B0099Y2YL6|4.0|I adore this show. However, this was my least favorite season. Without giving away any spoilers I think it made some abrupt &#34;shock value&#34; decisions in terms of characters that were less grounded than in previous seasons. Still, one of the best shows on television today. Can't wait for the next season to hit the US!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This book was very enjoyable. I appreciated the personal weaving of the women's lives and how they chose to survive.
B00110K62U|5.0|This is the only way to listen to or see this amazing show. The vocals in the movie (and serious lack of orchestration) were so disappointing, if you are looking for a way to introduce people to the truly majestic piece of musical theater that Les Miserables is, this is the way to do it. Colm Wilkinson and Philip Quast are unmatchable as Valjean and Javert. This is a serious treat for theater fans!
B0042TV4IW|3.0|OKay show.  Typical period piece.  It is better than most of the stuff on TV now days.  Keep it up.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Very compelling story with many twists and turns.  The ending was not predictable.  One of the authors best books and worth reading.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie ... it is a lot of fun to watch.  Barbara Streisand is great a s usual and added allot to this movie.  It is a fun movie that will entertain
B008602KQI|5.0|Just was a good movie. Can't wait to see the next one that is coming out. The signs for it are interesting looking.
B002KVCA1O|5.0|This is a great collection of Stones best music .  Re-mastered beautifully and packaged perfectly.  Enjoy the Stones at their very best
B004W2UBYW|5.0|When this was first published I knew I would read it someday and now almost two years after his death I did undertake reading this biography.  It is so complete on so many levels and I think the portrait that emerges really helped me understand why I truly love my Apple products and why I appreciate them so much. Steve jobs was a force to be reckoned with and his legacy will endure for many generations. I for one am so grateful that he was such a visionary,and so dogged in his ambition. The author balances his life story so deftly that I can't see how it could be any better told. Even after finishing this I still find myself thinking about how much influence on everyone's life he has had. Truly a remarkable man and a compelling story masterfully told.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I liked this movie .. wasn't great, but it was good.  I found it slow in parts, but I enjoyed the cinematography and the costumes of the day ... Mr. Lewis' portrayal or Lincoln was uneventful.  He did not meet my expectation of what Lincoln would have sounded like or acted like .. The writing was good and kept me interested through an otherwise slow moving movie.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I just did on Season 1 & 2  This  series is one of the best I have ever viewed & Season #4 can't arrive soon enough for me.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I liked this movie.  I found it to be interesting and well written.  It is a good story, well acted and edited.  It was easy to follow and entertaining.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|This was a gift to my daughter & she's totally hooked on this program.  She just moved to a different state, doesn't know anyone yet & is filling her time after work with Downton Abbey. My husband bought it for me & I can't get enough of it!!  I have season #4 pre-ordered. I buried a beloved Beagle so those tapes couldn't have come at a better time to take my mind off of my grief.
B00BF11STU|3.0|Sorry couldn't get into this movie ... I didn't think it was very well edited ... nor did I think it was very well written.  Very choppy and hard to follow ...
B006LSZECO|3.0|GONE GIRL.....MY THOUGHTS.... Well I was 30% through the book and almost put it away. I was so bored and had a really hard time getting through it. It was just after 30% when it started to get good (One of my clients told me her rule of thumb \\"if you can't get into it within 100 pages, then don't read it.\\" Well my Kindle doesn't have a 100 page mark. I'm going to have to set up a percentage rule that applies the same.) I'm 90% through the book and I will say since I've been reading this thing, I've been in a bad mood, cranky & irritable. I mean the twists and turns are really good but it's DRAMA that's all too common in real life these days, however, without the morbid sickness that the book portrays. Not sure I'm going to read the rest of the books.
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|Sorry didn't like this movie ... couldn't get into it ... just too slow and really not edited very well ... I found the movie to be choppy and difficult to follow... a real downer ...
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Cute, fun. Just wish gems were easier. Maybe a way for interchangeable gems for coins, gems for hearts, or the other way around.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|I love the mad men series .. Season 5 was especially interesting and entertaining .. Can't wait to see season 6
B00144VBBS|5.0|Great music.  Super singer.  It came in a very speedy fashion. Saw him in concert and he sang many of the song!
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|This movie is too long ... I found myself looking at my watch wondering when was it ever going to end ... A very slow moving melodrama, though Denzel does an excellent job... his performance is worth the torture
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Great game I love them action and exciting play. Hope they let us trade for flu coins sometime that would make the game much better
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|This was a nice movie to watch on a Sunday afternoon... nothing Oscar worthy... just a nice movie with some suspense added in .. I recommend it
B007A4SDCG|3.0|It raises some valid issues about creative blocks, but then swerves into some over the over the top ramblings about muses that served only to weaken the central thesis of the book. I had a hard time taking him seriously from that point on, even if it was only metaphorical usage of the term muse, which seemed far from clear.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book was phenomenal, well written from an interesting point of view. Until now I have never found a book that can at  both rip my heart into millions of pieces and yet make me smile. There are parts of it that are happier then others, like when Liesel and Max build the snow man, that part always makes me smile. Then there are the more numerous rip your heart out and stomp it on the ground parts, like the bombing and what happens to Werner  - lets not get starter on Rudy Steiner  kay? - while those parts are more numerous they are written just perfectly.<br /><br />However the book did take me a very long time to finish it despite only being around 500 pages or so. Usually I could finish a book of that length in a weekend or less. The book isn't hard to read its just very heavy. I did find myself having to stop for several hours before reading it further. Of course the heaviness of the topic and the tone is to be expected from a book about a girl in Nazi Germany (Which isn't really what the book is about but that's the most basic description I can think of without spoilers) everyone's story ties in so perfectly.<br /><br />Another thing I would recommend is maybe not being in public as you finish the book because it will make you sob. Not a lot of books make me cry (Marley and Me didn't and that makes plenty of people cry) but this one truly did. I was in Music Theory when I was finishing it up and my teacher  - who for the record wasn't teaching at the time it was the very end of class and we had 2 minutes untill the bell - and at least 5 classmates asked why I was crying (Though the one who recommended the book only laughed she knew very well why) and then I had to proceed to explain through out the day why I looked like I'd been crying. So don't finish it in public especially if books make you cry.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read and am hoping to read it to my little sister when she gets a little older.
B0025WX2YW|5.0|Loved the series and loved getting all of them free through Prime at Amazon..  10 stars for costumes!  Thumbs up!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I love this show, it is so down to earth and love all their characters, good actors, good drama, great story line.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I have not finished the book yet.  So far it has given me insight into what Lincoln and rivals did at that particular time.  Thoroughly enjoying it.  I am about half way through. This is not a book that you can zoom through.  It takes some thought. Very good so far though.
030758836X|4.0|Like many others, I could not put down &#34;Gone Girl&#34; once I started it. I actually read almost entirely non-fiction, but I heard good things about &#34;Gone Girl,&#34; so I gave it a try. Plenty of red herrings and sharp turns keep it fresh and interesting for the first two acts, as well as fully-realized, engaging lead characters. However, the third act is comparatively weak and collapses under the weight of the sheer number of twists. Although the ending was disappointing, I still recommend it as a quick, engaging read.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|I mylanta! So much tension I literally could not put the book down till the end. I feel like I felt all of Alex's emotions with her. And I was left guessing all the way to the end. My husband would check on me and comment on my facial expressions while I was reading, noting the intensity of my emotions. A great ending to a great series.
B00DSTBMMU|5.0|Excellent! Love her songs. Of course I love music periodly. Great listening and I love her new song.  Just Great.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|had me thinking and I love that!!one of the best games ever. I cant wait formore to come.can you escape really challenged my mind and my 13 year old son loved it too.
0857680986|5.0|One of the BEST if not THE BEST book for the beginner.  Covers the basics of the how and why of figure drawing.
B008602KQI|5.0|The book is always better than the movie and you simply can't compare the 2.  But this is by far the best book-turned-movie I've ever seen.  Putting the book aside, this was a moving, gripping, entertaining movie.  My husband, daughter and I loved it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game! I was hesitant at first to play, but it's just so good! I can't wait to get to higher levels!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Shifting between present and past was hard to follow at times. I didn't have time to read daily, which made it harder to keep characters and storylines straight. The ending was beautifully written.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|A very moving and eye opening book into the mind of a suicidal teen. Great book for teens to read..
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I like it because its intense<br />It gives you he feeling where you have too know what's going on!! It's good
B003F3PMYI|5.0|This book is enlightening and it explains my constant struggles.  When you are trying to paddle against the current, it hurts, you get exhausted and you feel very little progress.  Thank you for showing the way!
B003O86FMW|5.0|suzanne collins nailed it again!! i didnt think i'd find another good series after twilight, but i love this series & i cannot wait til th movie comes out!! th end of this one made me really want more!
B000P0J02E|5.0|If you love the movie you'll love the music...sweeping, epic score for a fun, rollicking movie.  All the favourite themes are there plus a few new ones.  Enjoy along with the other movies soundtracks and it makes for great listening pleasure.
0525958002|4.0|As a child of the 80's, growing up would have been completely boring with Duran Duran and my seemingly never ending crush on John Taylor, bassist of the super group.  Being the &#34;Duranie&#34; as I was (still am), reading about John's life was something I always thought would never happen as the only information I had back then was through teen bopper style magazines.  But the insight he provides into his life is both sad and interesting as I was made aware of the lows and highs (both literally and figuratively) that both he and his bandmates went through.  What makes it even more interesting reading is how he bounced back from his addictions to his first love...music.
B0082XJGRK|1.0|Did not care for this book at all. I deleted it. I am writing because I am being forced to do so.
B006O6F932|5.0|Came fast and without problems. Cute and good price. Checked around and this $70 was the best I found. Wish my kid will play this more often for this price
B00E9ZFIMM|3.0|I am not sure this is the app but I think it is great. Of course you may have your own view. Enjoy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game so much and I was so excited when it came to Kindle. This made me a very happy person.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|This is a great app but I am not able to use it. It seems it is only for wireless printers. That is on my Christmas list.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this show and Season 3 does not disappoint.  I'm not going to give any details away.  I like this time period.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Fantastic app. I had Spanish for one year at the university. I did not remember one thing. This app brought it all back and more. It is fun. It is educational which is right up my alley. I love it!
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|Great movie if you're in for easy story line and high effects. It's a good time. Sit back and let go.
B0097PW7H8|5.0|This is a fantastic product. It works as advertised. It lets you know when your battery has been fully charged as not to waste energy. It also tells you what programs are running so you can stop them to save energy or leave as is. You can uninstall applications whenever necessary. A fabulous product. If something else is released by them I will surely download it with no problem.
B005544V6A|5.0|Awesome show, completely hooked on this show! If you haven't watched it yet, you should. Definitely a must watch show!
B008KYOCA2|5.0|Fabulous app. I love the icons that you are able to put by your appointments. It is great. I would recommend this app to everyone.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Many similar movies of this genre but it gets 4 stars just because Brad Pitt is starring. Definitely worth the $1rental.
B00BXDOSXS|1.0|Did not play anything that was labeled flash. I understand now there is no Adobe Flash player which sucks. This is not a good alternative. I deleted it.
B00E8TWPI4|5.0|My grandchildren saw it when it came out on tv and they loved it. The only thing I would have done differently,is I would not have ordered it in HD......takes up to much space on the kindle.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|I love Jack Reacher novels.  Awesome story, great plot.  The audio books are also very well done.  We are glad Lee Child can pump out so many.  So far they are all pretty unique.
B00637D114|5.0|As a family we all enjoyed this movie so we put it on my kindle so my grandchildren could watch it when we travel(I enjoy watching it too)!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|A great game that's well fleshed out (excuse the pun). I have enjoyed every one of my numerous hours logged on here.
B005LLSZNM|4.0|Very good!!!  I love SOA.  Would be better if it worked on the iPad...  Works fine on a PC, but Apple has a hard on with Adobe Flash.
B002UWH8P6|5.0|If only there was a season 3! I got into the series and was deeply saddened to learn that it was cancelled.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Great story.  I liked the characters and the flow of the story,  I had a hard time putting the book down once I started it.
B005CAPS0K|4.0|Not big ghost story fans but this was pretty good and kept us interested a some silliness but we want to see Insidious 2 from earlier this year now that we watched this one.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|very handy.  does what it supposed to do,,  Always wanted one that you could input text and save calculation file
B00F3W9NQ2|4.0|This episode is kind of fluff. If you are having to buy the episodes individually you can skip this one and save two dollars.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love love love it....i recommend this game to everyone even my mom plays this game and she is in her late 50s  its very relaxing yet intense...u'll love it...be careful too u might have sleepless night....smiles
B00DYWKPAQ|5.0|This is an outstanding release by Kings of Leon<br />Their journey into the mainstream continues (but it's still better than anything on the radio)
1781162646|5.0|I am big Stephen King fan, and read all of his books.  This was a great book and a very enjoyable read.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My daughter loves horses and she really enjoys playing this game!  I also enjoy playing this game myself :)  Fun fun fun!
B0058VW36U|4.0|Adorable and the kids like it also.  Although I have to say it can be a little stressful when levels seem impossible.  I also have an issue with having to buy chances to complete a level.  Not cool.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Loved it..a little slow at times but great humanistic point of view, as well as a clear understanding of  the life she lived with this man.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This game is fun but a little mind numbing.  To advance you sometimes are asked to purchase additional chances.  Not cool.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Love the book, it keeps you on the edge of your seat<br /> I didn't want to put it down. Great read!
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|its a very fun game and very challenging at times,  I would give it a higher score if it didn't freeze up so much,  my son-n-law likes to challenge me
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I enjoy the challenge of each level. It's fun to try to stay ahead of my friends.I recommend this to everyone.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Just when I prepared my self for the grand conclusion things took a turn , a turn that considering the recent events for Katniss was an amazing conclusion wrapped in a plethora of emotions. I would read this series over and over and still be in love . There is no wonder this book series so popular , \\" Fire is catching\\"!
B00FOU1O3S|4.0|My grandson thoroughly enjoys this game. He enjoys the penguin and the different things he does for the polar bear as he returns each time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have a ball trying to figure out which way the candy will crush. I only get frustrated when I run out of tries and have to wait for my next chance.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Lee Child keeps you intrigued thru the whole book, everything seems so real when reading. Wanted to start his first book in the Jack Reacher series to see if I would like it. Will keep on reading the whole series.
0316204366|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Have always been a fan of Malcolm Gladwell and he didn't disappoint with his latest work.
B00DXP0QX0|5.0|Excellent collection covering Rod Stewart early years. A really must have for any Rod Stewart fan or to everyone who loves the old and good rock'n'roll.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game I have been hooked for a long time. I have downloaded every game I could find like it because kindle did not have it. Thank you kindle for finally making candy crush available to us kindle users.
B008C40218|4.0|Calexico is a group you'll love or have no taste for.  I have a taste for it and this taste test proved quite acceptable.  It reminds me a lot of Carried to Dust sonically.
B009TQPUSI|5.0|I remember this edition as it is the first one I read. As my review about the later edition is just as relevant I have included it below (partly to balance out a negative review for this edition - that seems to be about the quality of a used copy the person bought, rather than the actual content of the book).<br /><br />This classic book in the Self Help genre went on to sell over 30 Million copies throughout the world.<br /><br />The \\"Erroneous Zones\\" Wayne Dyer is referring to are the various assumptions and mental/emotional habits which can block us from leading a successful and fulfilling life. Your Erroneous Zones are things within you, which immobilise you and stop you living your life to the full.<br /><br />One of the key ones, and the first one Dr Dyer explores in his book, is Self Doubt in its various forms. This can be things likes; disliking oneself, putting oneself down, being overly critical of our own body (\\"don't like that bit\\", \\"wish I could do something about my...\\") and so on. This kind of thinking is so pervasive that Your Erroneous Zones is still as relevant today as when it first came out.<br /><br />Self doubt can also show up as not being able to accept a compliment and giving the credit to someone else.<br />Someone might say, \\"I like your hairstyle!\\"<br />We might reply, \\"Oh I got lucky with picking a good hairdresser.\\" rather than fully accepting the compliment with, \\"Oh thank you!\\"<br /><br />Dr dyer suggest asking ourselves \\"What is the point of all this self doubt?\\" to help us break out of it and the heavy burden we place on ourselves because of it. It tends to turn life into a struggle when we are filled with self doubt, or dismiss our own goodness, as we have no real support or encouragement - not even from ourselves.<br /><br />Your Erroneous Zones mentions that some object to the idea of self encouragement or self love as being \\"selfish\\". As the book points out, being selfish usually means putting a burden on others. Yet, there is nothing more burdensome to others than a person who refuses to approve of themselves as they then become desperate for that approval from others. Self approval or self love actually means we are less selfish as we have more to give and more to share with others.<br /><br />Wayne Dyer offers wonderful insights into some of the quirks of human nature and how much we hold ourselves back because of our self-imposed limits and dis-empowering ways of thinking about ourselves. He help us see that, worry is using the future to be immobilised in the present; and that guilt is using the past to be immobilised in the present. Yet, all our power is in the present - and we can change our life by becoming aware of the choices we are making and making better ones.<br /><br />Erroneous Zones also looks at the labels we attach to ourselves which are dis-empowering and which we can let go off simply by starting to make healthier choices. This book is till highly relevant and I happily recommend it to anyone open to leading a happier and more fulfilling life.<br /><br />William Fergus Martin, Author<br />[[ASIN:1844096289 Forgiveness Is Power: A User's Guide on Why and How to Forgive]]<br />Kindle Edition:<br />[[ASIN:B00FA4A7CC Forgiveness is Power: A User's Guide to Why and How to Forgive]]othing more burdensome to others than a person who refuses to approve of themselves as they then become desperate for that approval from others.

B00E1ZIZ3O|5.0|I was delighted by this one.  I had kinda low expectations not really knowing most of the artists on this one.  I bought it for the ones I did know.  No disappointments from those I did have high expectations of and my impressions of the new voices will have me looking out for those artists now.  What could be better than that for a new album?
B005S9ELVC|1.0|Steal a piece of \\"L.A. Confidential\\", add a few high profile actors and tell them to over act (especially Sean Penn), add a horribly written script and direction and you have \\"Gangster Squad.\\"  Could have been much better but it's the worst movie I've seen for awhile.  No wonder it's on cable already.  I can't believe the high user ratings this is getting on Amazon and elsewhere.  Only Rotten Tomatoes seems to have gotten it right.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Loved this story, would recommend to a friend. A quick read. will look for more stories about the orphan train
B00APUQH0W|4.0|One can find issues, but there was an interesting and fairly realistic story, that was well written and acted. That alone is worth four stars nowadays.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|terrific! good story, enjoyed the writers perspective of being a spirit gatherer, would recommend to a friend, was a quick read
B0064MPXFA|5.0|CBS Finally got a drama right. Amazing show. Great cast. Individual episodes flow well and over all series plot is well crafted.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Cute game fun for the little ones. My little one love her points and this game give it to her. But expect to shell out Orkney for the extras.
B002FGU44O|5.0|I've worn this model before and really like it for ruggedness and grip, plus they look nice and not cheap in appearance. My last pair lasted over 10 years. There's more texture on this shoe, and it feels odd against your feet. Older Terra Fi's were smooth and felt really nice. This took some breaking in and getting used to. After a couple of weeks they have conformed nicely to my feet. This is typical with this kind of sandal. They are very rugged and it takes some time. I could do without the texture against my feet. I'm sure it creates a little extra grip for the soles of your feet. It takes a moment for me to get used to them every time I put them on. But the final verdict is I absolutely love these sandals.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great idea<br />It was so fast and easy to set up. The picture quality is the best, go out and get one fast
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|This is one of the best horror movies I have ever seen.  It will scare the hell out of you.
B00E7NIMZ6|5.0|I loved the movie and soundtrack verry good job. And I enjoyed the movie and life of  James hunt and his legacey
B001EC2IT4|4.0|Great movie and timeless fun for all. Never mind that most of the characters are unbelievable. Its just funny and your kids will laugh with you just because... nothing is scary ...
B004VMUS9G|5.0|For a free app. this one does a great job reminding of what I input into the alarm clock. The clock works beautifully and the alarms are perfect (for me). I highly recommend this game.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|was great to see this again. remember when was kid, dreaming about finding treasure with me friends. my grandson loved it to.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids love this, it's easy to use, and no problems with running it on the Kindle fire. The HD graphics are great!
B00FJU1HLC|5.0|Super cute, only wish we had bought it instead of rent it. HD was nothing special on our new TV.
0062290797|5.0|Kyle's life was a very complex one and if his story is accurate he was killed for no apparent reason and that is a travesty of justice. His life after the military seemed to be turning to a point where he could be helping those with PDSD.
B00E72OKAS|5.0|It seems rare to find a game that is a fun casual game that's doesn't want more money after 30 minutes.
B008YW5RH2|5.0|Great graphics and physics. Awesome way to kill time. Highly addictive, can't put it down, and the different game modes make it a<br /> delight to play
B006C45MRE|1.0|This was one of the stupidest movies I have seen in a long time.  We only watched it all the way through because a friend had a bit part in it.  I have some questions:  WHY would Harrison Ford lower himself to play in such a  hokey movie?  WHY  did they portray supposedly intelligent aliens as  shapeless, slimy blobs with legs?  And the arms emitting from their abdomens has been done, thank you very much!  The &#34;space ship&#34; looked like a can of beans with the label peeled off and windows and doors cut out.  I thought maybe the movie might  be something new and different, but no, it was as lame as the name sounded.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|The show of the decade<br />Just love the zombies<br />the actors make me feel part of the group.<br />Story line is getting great
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was a great book had me at surprise as I read can't wait for the movie and ready to read the next.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It's fun but they give you timeouts and don't make it clear what you have to do like what are jelly 's?
B003OUXECE|5.0|Well thought out, using in game text to refer too and shows the previously unknown past of Andrew Ryan, Frank Fontaine, and Doctor Bridged Tenenbaum. As well as exploring the fate of Rolland Wallace and Bill Mcdonaugh.
B00594XOZU|4.0|I love this app you can talk  to your friend anywhere!<br /><br />What I hate is that all the things in &quot; Sticker Shop&quot; cast money but FlavorSplash and Memes! PLEASE MAKE THEM ALL FREE!!
B00005JKDR|5.0|Great movie! A classic!<br />This is my 4 year olds favorite movie and the adults enjoy it as well. Sully, Mike Wazowski and Boo will be household names
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|This game would be awesome except for the fact that it crashes frequently. When I try to get on it will say that it's having trouble loading or that it has an unrecoverable error. Except for that this game is fun it is really easy to get money and dragons.
B004GWQT5I|4.0|Solid movie! Awesome how the story inner twines with each character. Classic suspense! Right on par with Signs and The Sixth Sense.
B0083XFFWO|2.0|Cheapest watch band I have ever seen on a watch at this price, sqeaks even after oiled, rattles like crazy. The watch chronograph gets hit and puts the watch on a &#34;pause&#34; mode witch ive never seen on a dive watch, and is annoying considering you check the time and its inactive, it is also way larger of a face than represented. the face itself however looks fairly durable, but its not worth the money
B00CHNKJFO|1.0|I couldn't get this to work. Maybe it was just me but no matter how my brother and I tried to get it working, it just would not work.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|Just enjoy watching the show from the beginning. Older adult male that grew up watching musicals as a child and still do.
B008KYOCA2|3.0|It's alright not quite what I was looking for but it did the trick if you want something simple !
0385349947|2.0|Why is this book considered so wonderful?  Sandberg, it is true, offers an impressively documented evaluation of the inequality women face.  But rather than propose structural solutions that might help level the playing field (and that exist in other countries, such as paid maternity leave of longer than two weeks, or available, affordable child care), she instructs women to try harder and stop giving up so easily.  She doesn't answer the question, \\"What if it doesn't work?\\"<br /><br />What if you find a husband and a partner whose job requires just as many hours and as much travel as yours does?  Who will care for the children?  Tina Brown, a woman whose child-care budget is not restricted,  cited her \\"Lean-In Moment\\" as the moment when she persuaded her mother to move from the UK to the apartment across the hall from her, to take care of her children.  For how many of us is that a realistic choice?  (Hey, Mom!)<br /><br />What if someone wrote a book for people with brown skin, and documented all the reasons why bias against them truly exists, and then instructed them to work harder?  Do you see Thomas Sowell going on Oprah?<br /><br />Don't bother reading this book.  Spend your time networking, instead. Or get a little extra sleep--you need it.
1401923127|4.0|Fascinating look into the science of mind, body, spirit connection, written so a lay person will have somewhat of an understanding.  Always interesting to become more aware of the amazing creations human beings are, and this author allows us an insight into a very complex science.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I LOVE this book!  After years of spiritual seeking and experiencing what many have called impossible miracles in my life, someone told me about this book and I had to have it.  I had to do the experiments!  What I discovered in the doing of the exercises was profound -- not simply because they work, but because what I discovered about myself in the process is that I don't see the blessings around me in my daily life.<br /><br />Pam Grout's writing is easy and funny and she says what I often think:  \\"I hate to break it to ya, FP (Field of all Possibilities, what I commonly refer to as God), but folks are starting to talk.  They're starting to wonder, `Is this guy for real?'  I mean, really, like it'd be so much skin off your chin to come down here and call off this crazy hide-and-seek thing you've been playing.  I'm giving you exactly 48 hours to make your presence known.  I want a thumbs-up, a clear sign, something that cannot be written off as coincidence.\\"<br /><br />And, so began my adventure -- the adventure to find that consciousness trumps matter, that we create the world with our minds.  Indeed!<br /><br />I followed the instructions.  I asked for a sign, a gift, within 48 hours - something that could come no other way but from God.  Then, I waited.<br /><br />As it happened, that weekend, I was at Menla Mountain House to be in a workshop given by Howard Cutler on \\"The Art of Happiness.\\"  He's written a book by the same name with His Holiness the Dalai Lama.  I was curious to meet someone who has spent so much time in the Dalai Lama's presence.  I marveled at how a Doctor of Psychiatry could gain so much access to one of the holiest men on earth.  I wondered what he was like, how he would be.  I was expecting big and charismatic, like Robert Thurman, who runs Menla and Tibet House in NYC, and is also a friend of the Dalai Lama.<br /><br />What I found is that Howard Cutler, with his gasping breath and soft voice, first occurred for me as surprisingly artless, almost childlike.  As the weekend progressed and I listened to him speak about working with the Dalai Lama, and then doing the exercises and meditations that he taught to us that would cultivate happiness in our lives, I started to see him as truly ingenuous: naïve, almost, with an innocence that reminded me of the Dalai Lama, himself - as well as other highly spiritual people, like Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Satya Sai Baba.<br /><br />The weekend was glorious, the meditations delicious, and the small group of women, twelve in all, sweetly intimate and loving - I was so happy I had come.  I had forgotten about looking for my gift - I was enjoying the weekend so much.<br /><br />At the end of the seminar, Howard announced that he had \\"graduation presents\\" for us.  We all laughed as he pulled out boxes of gourmet jelly beans for each of us.  Then, he told us that he had a special gift for us: he revealed a small silver box that he opened to offer us a Tibetan Blessing Bead.  He instructed us to be careful how we picked ours out of the box - they are very tiny and easily dropped, and the rug was multi-patterned - if we dropped our blessing bead, we would have a hard time finding it in the folds of that rug.<br /><br />As he walked the tiny box around the room for us to select our bead, he explained that blessing beads are very rare and valuable in Tibet - a Tibetan farmer might trade, oh, say, twenty yak just for one tiny bead.  He approached me so I could select my little bead and he continued talking to the group: \\"What makes these even more valuable is that I had them blessed for you by the Dalai Lama.\\"  We all \\"ooh-ed\\" and \\"ah-hd\\" and were very impressed.  I held my tiny bead in my hand, debating whether to put it under my tongue now or wait until later.<br /><br />We said our good-byes... I am always sorry when a program at Menla is over.  It is such a special world there - a holy valley where the world seems so very far away and love reigns supreme.  As I walked out of the conference center, I decided to pop my blessing bead in my mouth and savor these last moments at Menla with the added blessing of this precious gift.<br /><br />Gift.<br /><br />Precious gift.<br /><br />Blessed by His Holiness the Dalai Lama.<br /><br />It hit me like a bolt out of the blue.  This was it - my gift, delivered within the 48 hours and blessed by the Dalai Lama - what could be more of a message that this was a divine sign from God? - the very sign I had asked for.<br /><br />Yes.<br /><br />My very next thought?  Why didn't I get that right away?  Why did it take me the ten minutes it took to gather my things and walk out of the center to really get it what a blessing this was?  What was I expecting?<br /><br />Ah, yes.  I was expecting something material - a gift from a friend, maybe; an invitation to something I really wanted to go to.  Nothing so simple as a little blessing bead, for which Tibetan farmers would trade twenty yak - probably more if it was blessed by the Dalai Lama.<br /><br />What an insight into myself.  I'm embarrassed to admit it except that, at least, I got this about myself - and could choose to be different in that moment.  I vowed never to take my blessings for granted ever again.<br /><br />I went back to my room and quickly opened the book to the lab page that Pam Grout supplies at the end of each chapter - so that I could write down the results of my first experiment.  And, then I saw it.  What I had read as \\"gift\\" really said, \\"blessing.\\"  The Hypothesis read:  \\"If there's a 24/7 energy force equally available to everyone, I can access it at any time simply by paying attention.  Furthermore, if I ask the force for a blessing, giving it a specific time frame and clear instructions, it'll send me a gift and say, `My pleasure'\\" (italics and bold are mine).<br /><br />Now, I am eagerly doing the other experiments.  They're fun, they're easy, and Pam Grout is so funny about things quantum, things spiritual, that it has renewed my faith in that God does have a sense of humor!<br /><br />READ THIS BOOK!  It will change your world.  It will change your LIFE!!!<br /><br />[...]
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|Awesome movie! Franco is the man! The effects are incredible, the story is solid. hopefully they will make a sequel. One could only hope!
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|This is a captivating movie, and made me feel like I understood not just the raid, but the process as well. I'm amazed they could make this without compromising secret information.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|Awesome!!!  I am really enjoying watching all of the episodes; some that I had missed and others that I enjoy watching over and over!  Great purchase and value for the money!!!'
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so much fun, I play it every chance I get. The game makes you want to play all the time. I love it. Would recommend this game to all my friends.
B009738XXM|4.0|I actually like this album a lot more than I expected. I bought it on a whim because it was very discounted and was pleasantly surprised. Tiny Little Bows is adorable and the rest of the album is really quite a lot of fun. Good, syrupy pop music, perfect for cleaning the house or driving.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|It was an ok book. It still deserved 4 stars. I recommend this book to you!!!!<br />·™€`^¥«»{}©® °[]<>£¢¡%*\~¿1234567890@$&_():;\\"-!#=/+?.com!!!!<br />See the site!!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Loved all three books recommend to anyone. Tris and Four were absolutely amazing. Just wish the ending was better. Overall one of my favorite series
B00008RH3L|5.0|This is one of best mob movies ever made, and a particular favorite of mine. It's a bit unusual, as you'd expect from the Coen brothers. The Irish mob, led by Albert Finney, is at odds with the Italians, and there's trouble ahead. The script is brilliantly written and unpredictable. And the cast is perfect. I especially love the music score, memorable and haunting. This is a film that stays with you.
B00AEJM6H2|2.0|Gets locked up and needs to be 're-downloaded occasionally.  I liked the old version better - it was not based on a timed basis.  It seemed to be a bit more skill oriented than this one that is timed oriented.  I do enjoy playing, but get tired of having to re-downloaded and having to start all over.
1616550414|5.0|Beautiful artwork, and an incredibly in-depth look into the video game and culture that has helped to shape my childhood.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|it's a good movie.<br />I bought it for the actor and actresses in it. and it was a pleasant watch.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|Intriguing character study and story line! Great acting!  This series is addictive! AS I watch it I can't wait for the next episode!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Life changing. Read it. Male or female, inspire and educate yourself. This is a book to remind us where we have come and where we want to go as a global community.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|This show was way ahead of its time! The social issues they took on in the 60s are still relevant today! And CAPT Kirk was HOT!!!
006202406X|1.0|An awful, incoherent story.  I'm so disappointed as I loved both Divergent and Insurgent.  The story here becomes confused and lacks the same appeal as this first two installments.  Giant disappointment!  I feel badly for the author, who is obviously hugely talented and perhaps rushed this end??
0425252868|5.0|Fascinating true story.  Wish it had been published sooner while they were still with us. Now we're waiting for the movie!
0761119752|5.0|This is such a fun and silly book to read as a bedtime story.  My girls loved it when they were little.  It has nice rhymes as it follows different animals as they get ready for bed.  It ends with a nice happy ending with all the animals finally going to bed.  Overall, it is a cute book, and one our favorites in our household.  Recommended!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Again as said earlier. There's more morals on this show than in the actual world today. To be human with compassion....Who knew? I look foreword to the next season.....There's never enough.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Dr. Who is the best thing ever, its witty, charming and original.  Even with an ever changing cast they always find a way to make you fall in love.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Have this on my andriod love it, good for all ages. I've played all the saga games and so far all have been user friendly from my mom to my granddaughter we all can play
B007JRUCGO|5.0|Delightful movie for the children.  It will be a fun movie for the children to watch.  Most adults will enjoy it, too.
B008Y5T5ZE|5.0|It was the mystery of the story line. It had its share of suspense.and it had a good storyline. Good replay value.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|The movie was all I thought it would be.  The acting was fabulous.  Yes, this movie deserved the Academy Award.  Very few movies today will I even waste my time watching.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I can't wait to really see this as a movie!!! I don't read books and I have read all these books about 6 times now. Awesome story!
B000QI2ZWW|4.0|This movie was all right for the children.  I have to say Happy Feet 2 was a much better movie for the children.  This movie was more for adults than for the kids.
0982633939|5.0|If Cary Grant was good, the book was so much better.  This mystery and adventure moves quickly and with more than enough surprises that last to the end.  Dodge is well know for his fiction and what better introduction into the mystery genre than this tale of suspense.
0788859544|5.0|Brought back awesome childhood memories! I bought this one because the newest edition came out but I didn't want to spend a tremendous amount of money on the same thing. This item was perfect!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|stops to much for levels and wants money all the time<br />slows down the game<br />candy crush takes for ever stops to much
B008220DIC|5.0|I really do like this movie, I was intrigued where the plot was going. I found myself perplexed by some of the deeper meanings of the movie, which for me, leads to questions. Almost wanted to google, what does it mean? Also, I think you have to be in the mood for an emotional movie, otherwise you might not like it.
0446547654|3.0|The listing stated that it was &#34;very good&#34;.  When the book came, it was missing the dust cover and it had writing in the front of the book.  The corners of the pages were pretty worn as well.  It did not meet the &#34;very good&#34; standard in my opinion.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I give Stephen King the credit for making me a passionate reader. My very first taste of him was Salem's Lot as a teenager. Though I haven't read him lately, it couldn't wait to get my hands on this, essentially, The Shining part 2. Dan Torrance is exactly where I would expect him to be, drunk and wandering the country. Stephen King is the master. No other author could submit a book with 2 prologues and not have it rejected. We need each to catch us up (1) and show us who we are dealing with (2). Dan Torrance is a very likable character, flaws and all. Abra, who we meet as a baby and follow until she's 15, is compelling. Her shinig is &#34;a lighthouse&#34; while Dan's is &#34;a flashlight.&#34; Together they work to destroy the True Knot, a band of gypsy child killers who travel the country by RV. Though I was never scared enough to put the book down and only read in daylight, I kept saying to myself, &#34;how does he think this stuff up?&#34; What a mind Mr. King has.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Recommended by friends but I was skeptical.  Sincerely loved the movie.  The ending was a surprise that I did not see coming.  The cast was brilliant!
B001MKVDPS|5.0|This is a classic thriller. The thing that makes movies like these so scary is that there are no special effects, or outrageous elements. This is something that could actually happen. Great movie!!
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|ROBERT DOWNEY JR....enough said!  Iron Man 3 is so far my favorite of all the Iron Man movies...love it!  Hope there are more!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I love this movie.  Interesting twist to the Wrath of Khan story.  Pretty damn good movie I must say.  A lot better than the first one which I still enjoyed.  Khan is more of a badass physically in this movie though he's still pretty smart.  He's a genetically altered super soldier after all.  Cant beat originals but it was still a pretty good movie.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Great and glad it's finally here. I am addicted to this game and hate when it drains my phone so I can't play. So glad it made it here so I har another place to play it.
B00FEHXCIG|1.0|I couldn't really watch it due to buffering every 5 mins.  I don't have problems with netflix or hulu streaming doing that so I don't know what the issue with amazon streaming is.
0385528787|5.0|An amazing end to a trilogy I couldn't put down. Margaret Atwoods depiction of a post plague America is frightening and just close enough to reality to make you stop and wonder.
B00G32OER4|4.0|I really liked this movie. It is based on a true story and was executed well. Definitely a creepy movie!
B00AB0Z88S|2.0|This movie is painfully slow with many unnecessary dialogues. The movie tries to stay true with the novel, and therefore it is boring. The screenplay should have been different; too much story telling makes it a documentary.
B005DI9906|4.0|A first class adventure story and one of the early colour films with some famous old-time actors.  I think the hero was too easy on his girl-friend at the end for her lack of faith but what the heck.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|A great story with action, romance, tragedy and survival.  The trilogy captured my imagination and emotions.  A very enjoyable read.
B0083GQKQG|1.0|one hell of a boring movie, kevin should have been beaten by his parents not coddled. an unrealistic film, with a total cop out ending
B00ET0PZDO|5.0|The first levels are fairly easy, but they increase in difficulty as you progress.  I found the last few difficult enough to have me groaning in frustration...but that's a good thing.  One of my favorite escape games
B003TSEEDY|4.0|It was a good read. I especially like the fact that you have suspicions but can't confirm till the very end where the story is going. Also it is very different style of writing. Don't want to say more as it will spoil it for the reader
B000JMKRKC|5.0|Very inticing, interesting story. It kept me guessing until the very end.  The author has a beautiful way of writing, and while reading this book I was completely involved with the characters! I was looking for something different to read, I was getting sick of silly, predictable romance novels, and this was the perfect choice.  Loved it!!
B008XKSW7M|5.0|funny and relaxing movie for a chill afternoon, It is not a masterpiece so keep it in mind. It is great for those who need a laugh but dont expect actors  to receive an Oscar for it
B004JMY312|5.0|A must see for Halloween! Just a great classic for the beginning of the fall season.  Just spooky enough for kids, but not enough to keep them up all night with bad dreams.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Love walking dead! Different from the show, but in a very good way, be prepared to become addicted to the comics too
B003SI9WYG|4.0|Pretty good movie. My family loves Halloween and Christmas so this was the best of both holidays in one movie.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I was not sure about picking this app but, when I saw that so.many had downloaded it  I went for it. It is very simple to install.and run I really like the fact it shows you  what it has cleaned up for you.
B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|Finally some decent music from a talented young person!  Typical we had to go to New Zealand to find her!
B00BOUL9DM|4.0|I like these puzzles.  Some are too obvious -- level20, everything red is &quot;red&quot; -- although what jumps off the page at one person may stump another.  Also, would like to have the option to stay at a certain level, rather than going up to the next level after every single try.<br /><br />As for the title of this comment, I keep getting the feeling that this game hinges on British English rather than on American English.  Is that so?  If someone knows one way or the other, please comment on my comment.
B002C949KE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book. The experiments described were simple and easy to understand but conveyed very important traits of human thought. Excellent read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|When I get stressed and need to keep my mind busy with out dealing with work it is a great release for me.
B0008KLVGY|5.0|It was just as advertised and enjoyed very much. I saw this movie in 1975 when it first hit the big screen.
B008K6HN8I|2.0|I don't use it enough to rate it any higher! But if I did its pretty easy to navigate! Good find!
B00E7RZEI0|4.0|Fun and challenging. The game draws you in and adds a fun and challenging platform for you to spend you time.
B00FY9JJYA|5.0|It is very important that people get to hear REAL music.This  music is OUTSTANDING. Robert please keep doing this. Thank You!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|This is the season that started it all for my obsession with the Doctor. Since then I have gone back to watch the original series and I am even more hooked!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It was affordable , and works great. I Just was hoping HBO was on it as was rumored when i bought it.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This is a wonderfully written book about an amazing piece of history that many have heard about but few know much about.  I couldn't put it down!
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Love learning about these historical figures. Having been brought up Catholic I was very surprised to learn that some of the laws for Priest and Nuns were implemented by Henry the VIII. The scenery is beautiful and in particular the costumes!  I have found myself watching several episodes one after the other.  I just have to see what happens next. Don't know what I'll do when I finish watching all the seasons/episodes. :-(
1476734941|5.0|My Husband & I both have lost 20 lbs.+, but more importantly - both of our cholesterol levels dropped and my husband is now off his high blood pressure medicine.
B00G9U7NEQ|5.0|Really fun to watch.  Much better then I was expecting. Loved the whole movie and the ending was unexpected. Five stars.
B008JFUNNM|3.0|Relatively solid thriller. Manages to successfully keep the tension high for most of its (unnecessary) length. Nothing really to write home about though honestly. The performances are quite solid across the board but I didn't find them as compelling as a lot of critics seemed to. The biggest success of the movie is the portrayal of the pirate characters - they're actually (for the most part) pretty nuanced and there is noticeable effort to flesh them out. You really find yourself sympathizing with them at certain points, which is a definite accomplishment and adds some depth to the movie. This isn't essential viewing but if you decide to spend two hours with it you'll most likely walk away satisfied.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|GOOD animation. Even blood . A little confusing at first, but doesn't take long. I just started playing it. If you like to shoot things, it's for you.
B005LAIIGW|2.0|Film critics need to stop name-dropping 2001: A Space Odyssey. Seriously, enough. There's no quicker way of piquing my interest, and no better way of ensuring my disappointment. Don't get me wrong here. Gravity is a decent movie. It can be quite arresting in its best moments, remains visually stunning throughout, and is reasonably entertaining for most of its duration. You could certainly do a hell of a lot worse for the price of admission these days. But despite its considerable strengths, none of them amount to a truly great film worthy of the absolute universal acclaim it has garnered.<br /><br />I'm not going to devote a whole lot of effort into explaining the strengths of the movie because they've basically been enumerated by nearly every single critical review on the internet. Yes, this is an undoubtedly gorgeous film. The visual fidelity is really something to behold, especially during scenes depicting space station destruction. The particle effects are definitely the most eye-popping I've ever seen. What's even more impressive than the visual effects though is the truly free-form, highly original camerawork and cinematography. The vast majority of the movie is shot with lengthy, tightly choreographed yet completely unhinged floating camera pans that are dizzyingly complex. The camerawork is really the most resounding success of the film as it completely creates that feeling of weightlessness and spatial disorientation that the characters are feeling and transmits all of that directly to the viewer.<br /><br />So yes, Gravity is certainly a spectacle and a visual feast, but honestly that's where the good things I have to say about it end. Thematically, this movie is essentially barren. All that's really at its heart is a half-baked attempt at reversing a traumatic, potentially damaging experience into a moment of rebirth, reinvigoration, and self-actualization. It's not even an original idea to begin with, but this isn't a particularly compelling rendition and the characters are at fault. This has got to be some of the most bland, undercooked characterization I've ever seen in a film with such positive reviews. After spending a full hour and a half with Bullock's character, all I feel I've really learned about her is that she's pretty damn efficient at taking on and off a space suit. Oh, and she has a pretty impressive lung capacity. I'm obviously exaggerating a bit- there's a very vague backstory involving the death of her daughter which gives us some perspective into her decidedly withdrawn and, frankly, boring demeanor. But it just isn't substantial enough to make her intriguing as a character and makes it very difficult to really buy into her transformation at the end of the movie.<br /><br />What's frustrating to me too is the fact that a lot of these issues could've been resolved with a little more exposition. This isn't a long movie at all. It easily could've been 30 minutes longer without even the remote danger of being bloated. Just 30 extra minutes of scenes devoted to characterization could've done wonders for the film and really gave it some weight and emotional resonance. Bullock's breakdown scene in the fuel-less escape pod is the perfect glimpse into the movie this could've been. It's by far the best scene in the movie and the only time where I was truly absorbed in the story rather than just admiring the pretty visuals. In this moment, Bullock's character shows a moment of complete vulnerability as she realizes the bleakness of her situation. She is completely alone, both in the overtly obvious physical sense but also in an emotional sense as well. This is such brilliant moment because it takes the character's emotional isolation since the death of her daughter and weaves it directly into her current physical isolation, creating a nice metaphor that instantly breathes life into the movie and gives it a sense of purpose. The character has essentially been drifting in this dead escape pod ever since her daughter died, and it isn't until this moment that she has finally come to terms with it.<br /><br />This moment is just as fleeting as it is powerful though, and it comes off as too little too late at this point. I do have some other more minor quibbles with different scenes in the movie that I thought were handled poorly as well. Early on in the film there's a nice moment where Clooney's character says something to the effect of \\"nothing beats the view\\" and the camera pans over Earth with some really nice ambient music that kicks in. But as it re-circles back to Clooney the music fades to complete silence a little abruptly and the transition into more dialogue feels awkward. There's also a particularly hokey moment where Bullock's character verbally compares her flight in the escape pod to the times where she would \\"just drive\\" after her daughter's accident. It comes off as a very forced attempt to integrate the relatively useless backstory into the present moment and just ends up being cringe-worthy. There's definitely more moments like this too- Bullock's howling along with the dog on the radio transmission or the corny, triumphant line of dialogue towards the end where she essentially announces something to the effect of \\"well, whether I live or die this has been a hell of a ride!\\" I realize these are relatively petty criticisms but the film stumbles like this enough for it to take me out of the moment and detrimentally affect the viewing experience.<br /><br />At the end of the day though, this isn't an awful movie. It isn't even a bad movie. It offers up some very compelling set pieces, unbelievable visuals, and some truly phenomenal camerawork that alone makes it worth the 10 bucks. But it's also a film that is ultimately very hollow, essentially devoid of compelling characters, and severely lacking in substance. Yes, it provides the superficial thrills and the eye candy. But for a film with so many accolades, it really leaves a lot to be desired.ughter died, and it isn't until this moment that she has finally come to terms with it.<br /><br />This moment is just as fleeting as it is powerful though, and it comes off as too little too late at this point.

B002PNER9U|5.0|Favorite movie in the whole world. Thrilled that amazon allows to rent digitally in countries outside the U.S. :D Finally.
B008JFUNYG|3.0|This remake was warranted.<br /><br />God, something about that phrase feels so blasphemous. It's definitely not something I'd ever expected to say after a film, but in this case it somehow feels appropriate. The original Evil Dead is obviously a seminal, classic horror film that can never be truly replicated. But it becomes apparent from the outset that this movie isn't attempting to reproduce what came before. It comes off more as an homage than anything else - a celebration of the first film in all of its ridiculousness and glorious excess. And although this remake doesn't manage to successfully capture the unique, fun-loving tone of the original, it certainly captures all of the ridiculousness... and the excess.<br /><br />Oh the excess. As I mentioned before, I feel that this is one of those rare remakes that doesn't feel like a useless rehash with no purpose for existing other than to fill some wallets while emptying others. As great as the original film is, it's undeniably dated visually. And since so much of the entertainment of the movie hinges on the absurd levels of gore and all-around-nastiness, the dated visuals definitely hinder the film from being as effective today as it was when it was released. The remake fully rectifies this and then some. This has got to be one of the most visually impressive horror films ever made, especially considering there's barely a shred of CGI to be found. If this movie proves anything, it's that there's no real substitute for great make-up and prosthetics in horror. CGI can be a very tricky thing to pull off in this genre and it often ends up making things that were meant to look scary actually look goofy and artificial. I can wholeheartedly say that everything that is intended to appear scary in this movie definitely looks the part. As far as I'm concerned, this is the absolute best that possessed people have ever looked on screen. They'd be downright gorgeous if they weren't so repulsive.<br /><br />Sadly though, the rest of the movie doesn't quite live up to the stunning visuals. Although the lead actress gives a very strong performance, none of the other actors (or their characters) are nearly as compelling. Also, something about the pacing of the film felt a bit off to me. The divisions between the scenes where you knew something scary was about to happen and the \\"safe\\" scenes where there was a lull in the action were a little too transparent. It was essentially always obvious when you should get ready for the next scare and when you could take a breather, which made the suspense of the film feel disjointed. Instead of slowly and relentlessly ratcheting up the tension like the original, the remake feels more like a string of self-contained gruesome scenes parceled up and divided by packing material. The tone of the film also feels a little conflicted. It definitely tries to take a more serious, straight-horror approach for much of its duration but additionally sprinkles in comedic elements reminiscent of the original. These two approaches don't complement each other that well and feel slightly at odds.<br /><br />Despite its shortcomings, Evil Dead is definitely an anomaly- it's a remake that's actually worth watching for fans of the original film. The inconsistent tone, limp characters and disjointed pacing hold it back from being an excellent film, but none of these pitfalls prevent the film from being a ton of fun and the make-up/effects are second to none. I had a great time watching it and I'd expect most fans of the original would as well.est of the movie doesn't quite live up to the stunning visuals.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|If you haven't read this trilogy well quite frankly you've missed out on life! I'm dead serious it's so intense and you can just sink right into it and get transported into a whole entire different world! It is fantastic!! Collins is one of the best authors that I know of. She is just superb! Definitely read all of these books hunger games, catching fire, and mockingjay! You won't regret it for one minute!!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book was amazing.  Even after I was done reading it--it haunted me for days.  This is one of those books that I will remember whenever I look for flower.  I refer to the glossary for weddings, birthdays and funerals for the rest of my life.  I loved the romance of it all.  But, on the flip side, the book had some very dark themes and chapter.  I read it on my kindle and listened to it on Audible at work.  I found myself having to stop the audio to wipe tears away.  The love of a mother and feelings of failure as a mother whether intentional or unintentional are real and heartbreaking.  The author weaves the story so well you feel like you are there.  I loved how she wrote and found myself writing down phrases so I could ponder on them later. She is a spectacular author.  I have to say I was disappointed to see that she doesn't have any other books to buy--please assure us that you have more books on the way.  I highly recommend this book to people who love reading about the complexity of relationships and like having a book leave an imprint on your soul.  You will love this book and will carry it with you forever.
B003F29D44|5.0|Great movie. Way better than the recent sequel that was made. We watch this every couple of months and it is always a great movie.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is excellent! It is a challenge at every level. So much fun and an absolute adventure for old and young.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|I saw this series when I was very young and decided to watch it again.  It really is a classic and some of the best of British drama.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is a very intense story about a teenager and his parents.  It makes all parents consider what they would do in similar circumstances with a disturbed teenager, who appears very normal.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This series is like a history lesson you want to return to, not something you dread like high school history class. Gives the dry facts feeling and emotion. I'm waiting for the last book of the series to be released.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|Easy to play. Even my 5 year old likes to play it. Makes you think a few steps down the road
0525953728|5.0|This book is a great read. It give a great account of what happens at war. My guy enjoyed it.
B00BRUPICM|4.0|Great read. I love the plot twists and the way all things converge onto one another.  Looking forward to reading more books featuring the commandant.  I rushed thru the first reading, and settled in for the second, a page turner both times.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Even emailed my 3 sisters recommending they read it.  That is a first.  Quite a surprise to find out what the secret is, and I liked her style of writing.  GL
B00AEFXJ1I|5.0|The racial issue is not as dominate as the idea of redemption...  Christina Ricci is amazing!  There are some scenes where she really shows off her toned physique.  Highly recommended.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Wonderfully written, and gripping. Read it in one go, seriously.<br />The Shining -along with 'Salem's Lot- is my favorite book ever written, and I always loved Danny, hoped to know what ever becme of him. In my own way, I loved Jack too, or the memory of the Jack that was a loving father and husband -albeit one who could only try hard, without really accomplishing...- and at first the revelation of who Lucy was kinda hurt. By the way, I saw THAT one coming for MILES before they actually came out and said it. Please, anyone else?<br />But still, I also knew 'who' the wind was in the platform, and even if Dan didn't cry, well, I did.<br />Overall, I loved it. Yes, please, and thank you very much.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|It was ok but not great. Several times they try to make it feel like a high tension moment but didn't quite pull it off, I never really felt submerged in the story
B00992CF6W|3.0|It's a good game, but it doesn't have as much stuff as the Xbox and computer versions of the game.<br />I think maybe you should add more stuff in creative. Then me and other people that play it will be happy.<br />And trust me, ALOT of people play it. Not saying add it all now. Maybe add little by little in future updates.
B00EDPFJA4|5.0|Best Hip-Hop Album of the Year. An amazing album and I loved it. Definitely WORTH buying. I only bought two albums this year this & 20/20
B000YHG72E|5.0|Must see!!!! Now gotta see it. You will laugh.  Cry. Laugh some more. Laugh. Laugh. La.ug ghhhh even more noe
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|At first I thought this game was just for kids until a waitress told me Candy Crush was her favorite game.  When I found it on my Kindle Fire I tried it. Now it's my favorite, too.  I'm 70 plus.
B00594XOZU|1.0|It's not that it's an update and its not the app it's Amazon -_- it's getting me angry because it won't let me log in either and honestly Amazon better fix this problem soon or they are going to have A LOT of angry frustrated customers and I'm gonna be one of them
B008Q0AP2E|5.0|No cheese here, just class! Pretty vampires, great costumes, intriguing characters throughout. A few moments of longing for things to get better for the main character. Love the story within a story. You'll watch it more than once.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|This is the most unique novel I have ever read.  If you enjoy something completely different and fun, I highly recommend Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Fun game, we were waiting for it to come out for the kindle.. however some boosts should be free... it's crazy to want to charge people all the time.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|This App is out of date.<br />the version of this app is 1.2<br />The newest version of PVZ is 5.1!<br />Amazon, update your apps!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Obsessed with Pinterest and this app. Easy to repin and &#34;like&#34; pins. Easy to connect with friends by sending pins. Love!
B00F91SCXC|2.0|Character development, story line, and dialogue are pretty cheesy. Action scenes are pretty good. Great climax, but movie ends abruptly 5 minutes later. Ending pretty dumb. Nice, new twist on zombies.
B0015DRPJU|5.0|Great vampire fantasy. A page turner for sure. Packed with action that will keep you reading. A great series for the vampire lovers.
B00CW6DAKC|2.0|Heart fun but would be much better if I had NEIGHBORS !!!! Only going to ask nicely once... please fix the connection to Facebook. So please let us know when we can connect as I see I am not the only one that cannot connect. Only 2 stars because of this problem.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed this game...wish there were more floors.  There were some good puzzles.  Not too hard but they were not all too easy.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Really good and I couldn't put it down!!!  Even tho there was some sci fi to the book, there was a lot of true history about JFK and Oswald!  I like reading more about Oswald that I really didn't know before!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The narrator was death, so it was no shocker that the ending was going to be depressing.  Because of the narrator, it took the element of surprise out of the book.  Even though the book was depressing, it was well written and interesting.  One of the reasons why I liked the book was because the main character stole books.  Another reason was that the main characters bravery was inspiring.  The third reason why I enjoyed this book was the fact that the narrator was death.  I actually started to like him for his brutally honest and haunting story telling.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|This app has totally streamlined the way I take notes and review them. I owe my grade in my First Amendment Law class to Evernote.<br />I tried once to do a project on it and then view it as a link and it worked for a couple hours but then idk what happened but all the progress I made suddenly disappeared so I had to redo it.<br /><br />Overall I still love Evernote, but I am wary of doing any high-stakes work on it.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|My 7 year old son loves this game it's nice to have a game that can let him use his OT skills and have fun at the same time also he loves games that you don't have lives to lose and wait for people to send them or for the clock to reset he can play for hours
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My son loves this game easy to play and keeps him busy for a while. The graphics look amazing on his new kindle fire hd
B000055XMF|4.0|The quality was very good.<br />The movie was excellent I hadnt seen it for a very very long time.<br />Superb music great acting and the story holds true for todays teens,<br /> trying to find themselves. Brilliant
B003L77GH4|5.0|I love the Vampire Diaries, keeps you on your toes!!!! Happy to have started watching cant wait for next season.
0143122010|5.0|A very comprehensive analysis of the topic if violence. The underlying reasons why violence has trended downwards is revealed .
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|Good graphics and  easy to use. My only real gripe is the dice rolls seem to get much better for the computer as the levels go up. AT level 5 the computer threw 4 doubles in a row, 3- sixes and a 5 at the end game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I can spend hours on this! it is absolutely awesome! and quite addictive. I love this game! I'm going to stop reviewing so I can play now!!
B000002KKC|2.0|Other than Tusk, I didn't care for most of the other selections.  I wouldn't buy it again, given the choice.
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|When Lord of the Rings came out, I asked where's The Hobbit? Here it is! A decade can be almost too long to wait! George Lucas is another film maker to go out of order, but these stories already had books made of them!<br /><br />The last Harry Potter book was split into two films to make extra money! This Book was split into three! A little annoyed I have to wait for the followups, but it gave me a reason to see a movie cinematicly in the month of December! My kind of X-Mas Movie!<br /><br />As I did with the DVDs of Lord of the Rings, I waited for the extended editions! Only time I bought them again was for replacing DVD with blu ray! Unlike in the year 2001, I could watch my brother's digital copy of this motion picture's theatrical version whilst I waited for the real deal! Why buy it twice when you can just wait a few months?
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Nobody can tell a story like Stephen King.  This follow up to The Shining is the story of Dan Torrance, the boy who survived the destruction of the Overlook Hotel.  He teams up with Abra, a young girl who also has the gift of shining, to take on The True Knot, a gang of zombie like people.  What struck me about their story was the essential goodness of their character, contrasted with the evil of their adversaries.  The conflict between good and evil, the oldest story there is.  I thought this was one of King's better books, which means it's great.
B00BZW5W3W|5.0|She is an excellent artist her vocals are silky smooth. I give this album a perfect 10. While winding down one evening/night with that special someone play this album and it's ON!. A perfect fit for your collection. I love Maysa's music, will look for her again and again.
0385737955|4.0|The Maze Runner is an exciting book that keeps the reader want to keep on reading, it has action. Personally i like action advenure type of books. The Maze Runner is a great example of that. The Way James Dashner writes the story is amazing. The way he describes everything makes me think that i could see a place like that in my mind. Before i read this book i thought it would be exactly like any other action/adventure book. He truly brings out the feelings and thoughts of the characters. Also the way he keeps people on the end of their seat he puts in many surprises to make sure the reader does not know what to expect and make the book that more interesting. For example, Once Thomas was getting used to the surroundings a girl showed up, but there has never been two maze runners coming at the same time. This example shows that James Dashner has a mind to make up any idea and make it part of the story.For a kid like me in the 8th grade i really liked to read this book so much that i would have wished to be in this type of world except the fact that it was dangerous. I would really love to read more of his books and soon share his books with family and friends. I give James Dashner two thumbs up.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a fun and challenging game.  I like the ways in which your mind is challenged with color, shape recognition and other spatial tests.  Wish there were more levels.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Candy Crush Saga is not as good as Fruit Drops Puzzle games to me but its ok I just like the fruit drop games better real good games to past the time away real relaxing and entertaining.
B0042FZOFU|2.0|Without SPANISH language, when he/she carries out the purchase since he/she didn't have the complete information, the pictures didn't show a lot and I supposed that taenia among the SPANISH languages, so I lost the purchase and like I reside in COLOMBIA, be not able to make the refund on time.
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|Fruit Drops Part II-Match Three Puzzle I like it a lot I play it a lot I think that its better then Candy Crush I would recommend it to every one its a whole lot of fun and I have not had any trouble with it at all a very good game.
B00DJ3ITKS|3.0|Why it is now the Kindle version is more expensive than the hard copy? We oversea readers rely on the kindle version as the book's discount factor disappears once the international shipping cost is added.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book. The concept of kids killing kids is difficult to digest. But for some reason I still loved it. Couldn't get into the second book though. Way slower
B009CVRQLY|2.0|I had preordered this CD from Amazon, but after hearing all of it I cancelled the order. There are 4 maybe 5 decent songs on it. All the rest are too boring to listen to in entirety. Why would she do a remake with Stevie Wonder of a song that was bad enough on it's own? I have been a MAJOR fan of Celine since she first started out with American music, not into French music at all, but after waiting 6 years for a new CD this was a MAJOR let down. She can do so much better than what she did here. Doubt she will ever top &#34;Water from the Moon&#34; or &#34;Call the Man&#34;, but hopefully her next cd will come close.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Enjoyable read an very good descriptions of the fighting.  Several characters could have played bigger roles and been explained in more detail, probably could have kept the Colonel around.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game and its so addicting! You can chose many different characters and I just cant put it down!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|So happy that kindle finally got candy crush. Graphics are good although a tad bit slow. I'm sure the first update will fix it. Good job Amazon.
B009CVRQLY|4.0|This is a refreshing CD release titled 'Loved Me Back to Life' (13 tracks) from Pop diva and phenomenon Celine Dion. I have always loved Celine Dion over the years but a common criticism from her detractors has always been that her 'vocals were boring' or 'monotonus' which I don't agree with. But with these refreshing songs and vocals in this new CD, even her strong detractors would finally appreciate her vocal ability very highly from now onwards. Just listen to the tracks \\"Water And A Flame\\" (a different voicing I haven't heard before from her), \\"Breakaway\\" and \\"Thankful\\" (incredible vocal range). With producers/composers including Ne-Yo, Diane Warren, Babyface and Stevie Wonder among others one is not surprised by an overall sweet pop and R 'n B feel to this new CD release.<br /><br />Stand-outs/gems/my favourites are the tracks \\"Loved Me Back To Life\\" (opening and title track, wonderful melody and duet featuring Ne-Yo), \\"Breakaway\\" (slow-tempo track with an incredible vocal range by Celine Dion) and \\"Overjoyed\\" (beautiful duet featuring legendary Stevie Wonder).<br /><br />On overall, Celine Dion doesn't disappoint in this new CD: refreshing songs and wonderful vocal execution by her. A recommended CD release.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|This game is so realistic and FUN for the best outcome of the family and friends and family and friends and family and friends and family and friends and family and friends and family the family and friends<br />@yahoo.com or Friday is on a few years ago when to the market is young years ago when to plant daisy wedding invitations to be done in a few years ago when to<br />Christa smile@yahoo.com graffiti f2f u and Aeschylus advise on Friday is going well and that I have no problem of a stock market and the kids tank is so realistic to see the rides
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Sadly this book is easily the biggest disappointment I've read all year. It had so much potential, and apart from the horrifically bad ending, it was also just uninteresting and slow to start with. Don't waste your money or your time.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have always like solitaire and it plays great on my Kindle .Game goes quickly and I play often but lately been too busy.
B00DQVST76|5.0|Queen of Pop.  No ifs, ands or buts about it.  She is the world's greatest performer.  I would say that to date my favorite concert of hers is The Confessions Tour, but I love this one, too.  There is a lot going on. The staging is insane.  It puts me to shame, honestly.  How can I be less than half her age and feel exhausted watching her?  Anyway, amazing show.  Amazing hard-working woman.  Can't wait for her next tour.
B00F9040HU|5.0|Love this game. Match three with a progressively harder challenge. A bit pricey but worth it. Music isn't too bad either.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Works well! Interesting game. Good for passing the time while waiting . No glitches found so far. Will be sure to update if there ever are.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really enjoy the new levels and updates that have been added &amp; New ways to spend bananas.  Great game.
B00BD6RFFS|3.0|The text to speech in this book doesn't work very well causing it to crash the app on my Kindle Fire HD.  Otherwise the book is ok.
B0036BK6MW|4.0|Loved this story and will watch it again. We hear so much about the bad things that happen and this one is special for me.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|AWESOME!!! This is one of if not the best &#34;Stryper&#34; releases to date. My prayers have been answered. We have the real Heavy Metal of &#34;Stryper&#34; back! This is I believe equal to or more so the heaviest head bangin' Heavy Metal they have done and would have been in perfect order after &#34;To Hell With The Devil&#34;. Great harmonies on guitars and vocals like we used to know so well and for those who thought Michael could not hit highs he will silence any non believers in that department multiple times over. The classic grinding guitars and pounding drums are back and Timothy is heard clearly on the bass. Great all around package. Really like the picture of them in the newer version &#34;To Hell With The Devil&#34; era clothing. I have followed this band since their first EP &#34;The Yellow And Black Attack&#34; and have seen them gradually come back to the greatness they once were and they I can assure you have accomplished that and more. Do not miss out on this one.
B00FSBW2L6|5.0|I am not a big fan of historical books, however this author makes the books personal. We follow Germany through Hitler's leadership, but we also follow a family and the destruction that occurs. The book isn't an Anne Frank story, but rather how a family survives the war and dictatorship. You get pulled into the story with fighting siblings, theft, destruction, death, life and forbidden mates. At one point you want to hate each character, but then are shown their struggles and point of view. Great read that teaches you a little history and to have alot of compassion.
B00846REIS|2.0|I'm disappointed that the characters are willing to put up with so much bad behavior. Predictable<br /> but enjoyable....will continue series
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|so much fun! this game is so addicting..no real skill needed...fun way to pass the time. need friends to move forward.
B000X2H8G4|5.0|These are great for those who have hearing problems and need to clearly hear conversation with someone.  I wouldn't say they would be a good pick for TV watching, unless the room were quiet or for many voices in the room talking at the same time.  For our purpose which was so our mother could hear instructions and question for medical purposes, this device works wonderfully.
B00280NYW6|5.0|You can not relive the past.  But who wants to when these guys just keep getting better with age. It was well worth the money!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Wonderful coming of age story. Loves it and the series. Can't wait for the next one! Writing is great (especially for a first book!)
1250037751|2.0|Fantasy…which I don't like.  Computer / Google related…didn't understand.  Not my cup of tea.  Others in our book group really enjoyed it and found it humorous in parts.  Good thing we don't all like the same kinds of reading.
0802473156|5.0|If you are in a relationship, this is a must! Finding out your love language will stregthen any relationship. Great book for couples!!
B009UNGYHG|5.0|This charging case ROCKS! It will keep a charge for a week while I am traveling. The headset is very nice also,
1612130283|1.0|I agree wholeheartedly with the many one star reviews.  I got caught up in the hype so I had to buy the tril-oh!-gee!  Read Grey and am now halfway through Darker.  I have never skimmed over dialogue in books like these but after purchasing them I feel compelled to finish all three.  They have no substance.  What a waste of my time and money!  A new genre of books has surfaced:  Pornographic fairy tales.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I bought this for my son, now 49, who has been a &#34;Trekkie&#34;  since he was 10.  It was released the week before his birthday and I ordered it.  It arrived a couple of days before the birthday. Needless to say he LOVED it!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Awesome sequel, anyone who loved The Shining will dig this book! Maybe a sequel involving  Abra and her adult life and her growing powers would be great!
B00CCXL9OE|5.0|So nice to see it in 1080p HD!  Everything works as expected and all my USA Blu-ray players can play it without any trouble!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|A good game to pass the time.  Not a true style hunting game but more shot challenge style of game.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|My son LOVES this movie.. the only movie he can pronouce.. :) and tells me to put it on every single day.<br />very cute movie..
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really enjoy the mind boggling way to play with candy. Mom always says don't play with your food but this game is irresistible.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Wakes me up consistently! I love the new design for snooze and stop function! Great app that is very helpful. Thank you!!
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|This movie was difficult to watch... Because it was so bad... I'm not sure where all these good reviews come from.
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|Hoped for the truth...but I guess some things aren't meant to be said.  It wasn't a pact as much as it was a remedy or relief.
B00CDV6WDS|3.0|Couldn't find a pause button, don't always have time to finish a game and need to pause it.  I play a form of this game all the time and was disappointed in this one.
B006LSZECO|2.0|First let me say that the book is well-written.  I did not like the book because it was more a study in love, hate, and mental illness than a mystery. I disliked both the main characters intensely.  Of the lesser characters, Go and Boney were sympathetic.  In short, I felt misled by all descriptions of this book.  I cannot imagine why it remained a best seller for so long.
B000WC3864|5.0|Best horror movie ever. Definetly buy it.Gory,tense,scary and campy.What else do you need?Probably my favorite even out of the other two.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Really, you only get 5 lives at a time, put it down, pick it up, put it down.  Why can't you just play continuously?
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Excellent character development.  Suspenseful and realistic plot structure. The climax wrapped up all the plot lines extremely well.<br />I will be thinking about this book for a long time and will probably re-read it !
0143124838|5.0|A really lovely book full of pictures and little stories to just peruse through and be inspired either by fashion, art, ideas, etc... I'm a fan of Alexa Chung so this was an easy sell for me ;)
B0043URV5U|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my husband to listen to as he drives his Corvet.  It contains all of Bob Segers hits, new and old.  Some of the tunes I had never heard, but it is definitely rock and roll.
B0015DYIH2|1.0|I was glad to have finally finished this final book in the Twilight series.  So much time was wasted in repetition.  Don0't waste your time.  Read The hunger Games instead.  It is far better written and more entertaining.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Bought this to go in our truck that doesn't have built-in bluetooth and it works great!  It does everything the built-in system does in our newer car.  The voice of callers is clear and easy to listen to.  The demands are simple.  And the hole thing was very easy to set up.  Very portable.  Great buy.
B000VSBX34|5.0|If you are a Beatles or Bee-at-till's fan, then you gotta have this DVD in your collection. Excellent film quality, humorous story line, and decent acting. Of course, the music is Awesome. Nice price for this DVD, too. Thanks!!
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|GOOD STUFF, this is must have for all Jimi fans. It may be old songs but it's nive to hear some of other Jimi's work.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Awesome! For the price nothing touches it. Now apps just develop more,  and Amazon quit using Android and not being compatible.
B004VD3YIM|5.0|none better...it has all the features you need...works with all my cameras.<br />great image quality.  easy setup.  a must have for op cameras
0425263924|5.0|I Loved it so much I can't wait for the next book!!! Had me hooked the entire time !! Great love story
B009CVRQLY|5.0|This is an absolute masterpiece! Each song on this album is stunning and delivers nothing but pure emotion. Celine and her team has simply outdid herself giving us a modern and refreshing album as amazing as her 1997 album, Let's Talk About Love! Loved Me Back to Life was worth waiting 6 years and will be a favorite among long time fans and new fans!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Devine tree you have to be updated with an Yuri to yoyo and the world of a yoyo to the world of a new comment.
B00B1MJ02K|5.0|What can I say. One of the best musical voices of our time!! If you like Bocelli, you'll love this album!
B00EPQQ2PW|5.0|I love this album. When I'm not listening to it, I'm thinking about it. The music takes me back to my Depeche Mode obsession in high school.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I have resisted playing this game for so long. I called it candy crack saga for a long time because of how my facebook feed was taken over by all of my friends status updates on this game. I enjoy the game but am only at level 30 and already see how they make their money you can buy more minutes to complete levels, and its pretty hard to beat a level when it won't let down the pieces you need to complete the level. You can also buy more bonus pieces.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|First of all, as everyone has said, this game is EXTREMELY addicting.  The way it is designed is to drag you in with relatively easy levels at the start but then gradually it starts to become VERY difficult.  Due to having to wait for a period of time after losing 5 lives, there have been several levels where it literally takes days to get by (due to having other things such as work and sleep to do).<br /><br />I find that often I am only a couple of moves away from completing the level...that is why the company allows you to purchase \\"extra\\" moves, along with lives and other boosters.  I would have easily just paid five or ten dollars for the App on its own if it was fully playable, however they can make a lot more money by having folks just pay a dollar or two at a time as an \\"impulse\\" purchase.  I have done this a few times myself already but I realized I am not even 1/4 of the way through the levels so I will not be doing this again.  I realize most apps are using this business model but it is still disappointing.
B00G118LYY|5.0|First of all this app is for all ages and you can create your own world or use the one they have there and I recommend this app for younger children but it is also good for 8 to 12 years old but for kids 1 to 3 parents might have to help steer but no doubt this app is one of the best app ever
B005721W9O|5.0|Of spoof movies, I think this has to be my favourite and a definite classic: loved it from the day I saw it, as a teen, and appreciate it in new ways now as an adult.  Writing this in late 2013, the visuals hold up really well from the time it was made until now, and watching it in HD the quality was fantastic and clear, without having an 'aged' feel to it.  There are some fantastic actors in here, and they really are what make the movie- we also see some supporting actors that later make much more of a name for themselves.<br /><br />The plot of the movie- well, I've never seen a spoof that quite grabbed me like this one, both for its originality, lack of over-reliance on the source concept, and strength of individual plot.  The quality acting, directing, and writing really helps in connecting to the characters and crossing the line of suspension of disbelief.  One can laugh hard with it, and yet at points find some deep emotion.  While I feel the ending was a bit showy and a let-down (would have been better if they'd stopped just a tad sooner), it was/is an excellent movie and definitely worth watching at least once for everyone.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the best game ever I think everyone should play this game you get to have a horse and it is a really fun game:).
B00BFUC8RC|4.0|I  LOADED THIS FOR A FRIENDS CHILD. SHE LOVED IT! AND WOULD PLAY WITH IT OVER AND OVER.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!

B00BEPVAV8|2.0|I NEVER PLAYED IT BUT LOADED IT FOR A FRIENDS CHILD. SHE PLAYED IT AND AS FAR AS I KNOW SEEMED TO ENJOY IT.
B001CDWFPC|2.0|I love the ESV, but this Kindle edition does not work properly in my reader app.  I have the HCSB edition, and works fine.  It will not access the books of the Bible themselves.  I tried just the other day to link to 2 Timothy—not sure exactly what is wrong.

B001DHXT6G|5.0|We are watching the original series over again. It is amazing the job they have done to restore this to the original (or even better with some additional computer graphics that were not available in the late 60's). I remember some from when they were broadcast initially, but am glad to have them to watch again.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I LOVE PINTEREST.  IT'S LIKE HAVING A PERSONAL LIBRARY AT YOUR FINGERTIPS AND THEN SOME!  I'M ON IT ALMOST EVERYDAY!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I can not stop playing this, I'm completely addictive! They need a candy crush rehab!!!! Don't start playing this unless you want it to consume your life!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I LOVE EBAY.  THIS APP IS ON ALL OF MY DEVICES.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD DO WITHOUT IT!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Fun and very entertaining game but can be slow at times. Hard to get acorns in game and sure don't want to buy them,that takes some of the fun away.<br />Like the new film world.
B008EKMB82|4.0|What a satisfying read. A good story stretches you and awakens ideas you've dreamed but haven't  really held onto and makes them come alive. Ruth Ozeki has such clear voices here. Both Nao and Ruth, the characters we follow, not only have authentic voices as teenager and woman, but Ozeki helps them to mingle and exchange with each other through time. This is not a time traveler story, but what you've ever questioned about time and worlds within time is beautifully explored. The characters capture you, the language is beautiful, the story is worth reading time and again, now and later.
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|It is a very fun and challenging game as you continue through it. Some say it is pay to win i would not believe them. This game is all about strategy and tactics you can win without the heroes. All around good game heroes are a little over priced.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|After reading The Hunger Games trilogy, I needed something to read. At a reading conference someone said to read Divergent...I was hooked! I have so enjoyed all 3 books, but I think Allegiant has been my favorite. I look forward to more books by Veronica Roth!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|fun but a little confusing at times. It's very addictive and stimulating as well as frustrating but am surpised at how quickly I've caught on..
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Glad the Kindle fire finally got Candy Crush Saga! Not sure why it took so long. Now somebody send me some lives. Lol
B005PK56TA|5.0|One of the best shows I have seen so far.  It has all the ingredients that made season one close to perfection.
B00E6890VC|5.0|I recall recently being in one of my local record stores and seeing this album as the name of the band stuck out to me. After debating to just purchase the album on a whim, I decided against it and went home determined to check the band out. Wow, what a mistake I made not buying the album immediately! CHVRCHES is an incredible 80's inspired synth pop band. Their songs are catchy as hell and so much fun to play! I can listen to the album beginning to end and love each and every song as much as the next. They have so much talent, I can't wait to see what the future holds for them! I would recommend certain tracks to try out but NO REALLY, GET THIS ALBUM. I highly doubt you will regret it.
B000JIMMUE|5.0|One of the best fighter jet movies out there. Actually prefer this over top gun. Very good action footage and story line.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|I haven't listened to an Eminem album since the Marshall Mathers LP1 (which I really enjoyed).  I can't imagine he's ever done anything like this before? Right?  I'm up to Evil Twin and I'm still waiting to find I song that isn't amazing.  I prob shouldn't review a product until I've listened to the entire thing but this is one of the best albums I've every experienced.
