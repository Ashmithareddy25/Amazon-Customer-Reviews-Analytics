0679746048|4.0|The story GIRL INTERRUPTED is a story about a girl named Susanna Kaysen who goes to a mental institution in 1967.  The doctor diagnosed her with borderline personality diorder.  Her therapist said that she had to spend at least two years in the hospital.  Susanna met a lot of new friends at the hospital.  She was usually with one in perticular.  Her name was Lisa, and Lisa was a bad influence on Susanna.  They get into a lot of trouble together and this was not helping Susanna progress in her thrapy or problems.  Lisa had been in the hospital for many years and there was nothing the doctors could do with her.  She just kept getting worse and worse.  Although Susanna had fun with Lisa she knew she had to seperate from her. When Susanna was away from Lisa she got through her problems and was out of the hospital within a matter of eight-teen months.<br />I recommend this book very much.  I enjoyed reading it and thought it was very exciting and thrilling.  It made me think about all the problems that so many people have. It was a wonderful novel and I hope many more people get the opportunity to read it
B00004SCX6|1.0|The fact that my sister keeps listening to this CD like it's actually good is driving me crazy.  This was worse than the first piece of trash.  I wasn't shocked to find that there is not even ONE actual SONG on the whole so-called album. I mean, were there any actual INSTRUMENTS used to back up that \\"voice\\"? Man, talk about overproduced. Can this even be called music?  Oh God, and the little voiceovers before songs like Lucky and that Rolling Stones cover that she butchered (Satisfaction) are just absolutely the epitome of awful.  Please, don't waste one cent on this CD.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Considering all the garbage that was released after the Days of Britney and Friends, I now feel that this album is not the crappiest recording on the planet.  This is a sad day in music, indeed.
0393312836|5.0|I just moved and happened across my copy of CO.  I sat down and read it again only to be mesmerized by Burgess once again.  In his introduction, he is very self-deprecating, but this is one fine work.<br />Holden Caulfield, this is what teenage angst is really all about.  The use of language (nadsat talk) is truly an amazing literary feat.<br />Read it again or read it a first time...it is so worth it.
B000058983|5.0|This is the cd that all Love fans have been waiting for. The 5 previously unreleased songs are stunning. The instrumental song titled 'Hummingbirds' is a great demo with acustic guitars from the '7 and 7 is' session. This song would later be made into the 9th song on Forever Changes, 'The Good Humor Man He Sees Everything Like This'. The next track, 'Wonder People (I Do Wonder)' also would reappear later on Out Here as 'I Still Wonder'. It is the only song from the Forever Changes session not to appear on the original LP. 'Alone Again Or', the classic Bryan Maclean is next and offered in an alternate mix. 'You Set the Scene' the las song on Forever Changes, is offered and includes a completely different ending. The greatest part of this cd is the eight minute track session highlight from the song 'Your Mind and We Belong Together'. This is worth the money in itself I think. It has Lee directing trafic in the songs making, telling Echols to wail away, and Maclean to slow down. Yes, Maclean was there! We get about 10 takes of the intro and then a full length instumental with a different guitar solo. Then we get the single 'Your Mind and We Belong Together' b/w 'Laughing Stock'. This is a definate for any Love fan, and to those who are new to the band you get 11 perfectly cut songs from Forever plus the 7 bonus tracks. 18 songs of great music.

B00004XOWM|5.0|I have NO IDEA as to why this album got such bad reviews.  It is, quite possibly, the best CD that I have ever heard.  I love Limp Bizkit, but their first 2 CD's aren't that great.  They have a couple of good songs a piece, but nothing special.  This CD has it all.  There are no really BAD tracks.  Tracks 2,3,5,6,7,9 and 14 are all great, and the others aren't that bad.  The hidden track in between tracks 8 &amp; 9 is pretty cool too.  I recommend that if you haven't burned/bought this CD to purchase it now.
B000002MUW|5.0|Out of all of Madonna's album I think that &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; is most forgotten of all, but I can't understand why? On &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot;, Madonna take us into a kind of musicial dream, her dream, which isn't all that bad. The first single &quot;Secret&quot;, went to #3 and gave us another good Madonna song, I love the remix version of this song, although this is not one of my favorites of her, next came &quot;Take A Bow&quot; which hit #1 and became Madonna's longest #1 hit staying at #1 for 8 weeks, who would have known we would have to wiat 6 years for her next #1, but then came &quot;Bedtime Story&quot;, the title track which I think went over a lot of people's head at the time this song only charted at #42, but gave us one of the most brillant videoes in the video era, and finally &quot;Human Nature&quot;, a payback song for those who critized her for her &quot;Erotica&quot; album and &quot;Sex&quot; book about taking things to seriously, this song gave us another classic video, but the song again landed outside the top 40 peaking at #46?, I just don't understand?, out of all her album this I have to say honestly, is the one I have listened to the least, but I have listened to it enough that I can give it five stars, because it's Madonna and you know it will be good, I think this is another album of hers where she just brings out great music and once again great writing. Nice album Madonna.
0553106635|4.0|I have to say that I truly like this series.  It's a wonderful transition from the normal fantasy series, i.e. no true monsters, magic, or true goodness and evil.  While I do enjoy Jordan's WOT and Goodkind's SOT series more, these books rank up there.  But I do have a few small problems with this series.<br />-Why does it seem Martin follows a &quot;kill them all&quot; stance in his books.  While it is a new concept to kill off major characters, and one that is somewhat refreshing (it makes it so you do not have to remember hundreds of characters) it appears if he continues along this thread he will have no more people on which to write.  Is that how this series is to end.  &quot;Well all the characters are dead, so looks like that's the end.&quot; &quot;Sorry people that's all [he] wrote.&quot;  I for one do not wish this seris to end at book 7 simply there are no more characters on which to write. Do any of you?<br />-Second, G.R.R. Martin has to be the most pessimistic man in all the world.  Nothing good ever comes to any of his characters. Even when it appears something good has happened, such as Bran finally finding a way to find the three-eyed crow, we all know something unquestionably bad is going to happen. Perhaps he will become completely paralized. I mean come on. This series is somewhat remenesent of what life was probaly like in Midevil days, but still, I'm sure some good things happend to some people during that time of history.  I for one thing Martin should now begin each book with &quot;Nothing good will come of this.&quot;  Will any of these characters ever get a break?<br />-Third I find it hard to believe that everyone in the world has stopped believing in the &quot;Others&quot;. You do not build a wall of ice for generations, and then suddenly start believing the reason you built the thing in the first place has ceased to exist.I realize of course that many of the other characters in the world have their own worries, what with so many wars andall, but it would be somewhat more believable if some of these people would look to the north and realize something terriable is afoot.  <br />-Forth. Everyone keeps talking about how well this series is progressing. I see no progression at all, and for the simple reason that I don't think a reason for this series was ever clearly stated. I mean, where is this all leading. Are all the wars being fought by the kings the important issue, or is it the up-and-coming war with the &quot;Others&quot;. So far all I have seen is alot of death, some needlessly, alot of fighting, some for no reason at all, a serious amount of backstabbing (I do not feel I could trust a single one of these characters to tell me the sky is blue), and so much political intrigue I feel as if I am stuck in a fantasy version of a Tom Clancy book. Where is this all leading. Why must I know Sam has killed a wrath, when it seems he is possiably the only one who ever will. The way this series is progressing I fear one of two things will happen. 1-either all the characters will be dead before the &quot;Others&quot; have a chance at them, or 2-so few characters of any importance will remain that we will not care what happens in the story, either from the wars for power, or the ultimate &quot;battle&quot; with the &quot;Others&quot; which may never happen<br />All in all, I like this series. It's a nice rest from the tried and true fantasy books we all know and love. But will I ever love it? Sadly I must say no. I mean, how can I love something I could read about in any history book about Europe's past. Simply put, this is a good series with wonderful new ideas and writing, but will it be remembered? Surly not. <br />So in my opinion, read Jordan and Goodkind, for though their series have staggered somewhat, at least we know an ending will happen eventually. When it some to the Martin series though, it seems the entire world's population must die before an ending is found.  But, who knows, perhaps Martin will pull a rabbit out of his hat and prove my &quot;kill them all&quot; opinion is wrong.  I know I'll keep reading his books, but only after footing the bill for much better authors such as mentioned above.
B000002MFN|5.0|I agree with those who reviewed this album, &quot;Erotica&quot; was very underrated because of the controvesy, with her &quot;Sex&quot; book she released the same time as the album. &quot;Erotica&quot; has great songs on it, the first single &quot;Erotica&quot; was a terrific song, and I had no problems with the song, then came &quot;Deeper And Deeper&quot; the song that I think got truly lost on this album, this song continues to be a favorite for me and I think the song was very good for this album, it brought us Madonna back to the dance clubs, then there is &quot;Fever&quot; the remake which I think she did a nice job of remaking, and I love the video, next comes &quot;Bad Girl&quot; a sorely misunderstood song this was one of Madonna's lowest charting songs, but I think it is one of her better songs and once again sounds like nothing out at the time and the video for &quot;Bad Girl&quot; was awesome, and finally &quot;Rain&quot; this should have put the &quot;Erotica&quot; album better appeal, the song is sung so well by Madonna, the way she sings over herself is just wonderful, but to end there is wrong with unreleased material like &quot;Waiting&quot;, &quot;Thief Of Hearts&quot; and &quot;Bye Bye Baby&quot; which should have been released, this is an album that should stand on its own and like all Madonna albums does. I think a lot of the hoopla surrounding &quot;Erotica&quot; is unfair because this is a very overlooked album with great music and writing on it. To dismiss this album just because of her &quot;Sex&quot; book is a big mistake. Great album.
1573225517|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book.
B000002UAU|5.0|This album has no holes. Many people say that songs like &quot;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite&quot; and &quot;Lovely Rita&quot; and &quot;Fizing a Hole&quot; are just fillers and that the only songs worth listening to are &quot;Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds&quot; and &quot;A Day in the Life.&quot; However, if you listen to these 'filler tracks' you'll hear that they are actually the heart and soul of the album. Pure lyrical genius is clearly apparent in each of these songs. The songs that are dismissed as filler are done so because they do not have a deeper meaning, but even though there is none the words and the music display absolute mastery. The lyrics are the kind you remember and the music is the kind that has you remember when each instrument comes in.<br />The concert mood of &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,&quot; the druken-bar-singalong feeling of &quot;A Little Help from My Friends,&quot; the psychadelia of &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,&quot; the self-confidence of &quot;Fixing a Hole,&quot; the sadness and lonliness of &quot;She's Leaving Home,&quot; the carnival feeling of &quot;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite,&quot; the deep exestentialism of &quot;Within You Without You,&quot; the carefreeness and dependence of &quot;When I'm 64,&quot; the ups-and-downs of &quot;Good Morning Good Morning,&quot; and the ....... well I can't describe &quot;A Day in the Life,&quot; make every single album in the song as important and perfect as the one that came before it.<br />This is the first pop album to feature a full symphony. It wasn't as if John, Paul, George, and Ringo just went crazy with the London Philharmonic however, every single note in every single song seems brilliantly placed, right up to the orgasmic ending of &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;<br />This is one of the few albums that you can turn on and just listen to without stopping. Simply put, every lyric, every musical note, even the cover art (The Beatles and 50-something of themost influential people in their lives) is perfect.
0226264017|5.0|Capitalism and Freedom is an excellent book. It describes Capitalism very well. I think it is one of the greatest books ever writen about economics and Milton Friedman one of the greatest economics ever. I think everyone will find himself in this book and understand the role of the competitive markets in the economy.  As Milton Friedman says: The role of Government in a free society is to set the rules of the game and to foster competitive markets.  Enjoy it
B00003CXIY|5.0|Hilarious from beginning to end! I couldn't stop laughing. It is made up mainly of bathroom, drugs, and sexual jokes, but if you're over fourteen, you can laugh with the cast.
B0000296SI|1.0|okay.. lets see what I need...  A drummer who has the skill level of a 5th grader...a guitarist who knows what a power chord is (the first chord you learn when u take guitar lessons!)... a desire to sell out!

0930289528|5.0|The original ten part mini-series compiled in this book was completed in 1990, and fortunately, most of Moore's dire predictions about its now outdated setting of 1998 London have not come to pass (like the limited nuclear war that obliterated most of the other world powers).  Still, this Orwellian vision of a fundamentalist Christian, anti-Semitic, homophobic, fascist regime may hit frighteningly close to home for many Americans.  Its architects could just as easily have been Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh, except that Alan Moore offers his readers a cure for the type of social disease spread by these right-wing demagogues.<br /><br />It is the tale of the mysterious V, who haunts the pages of this book masquerading as the 16th century English folk villain and failed Parliamentary bomber, Guy Fawkes.  Using extraordinary physical and mental abilities accidentally gained through experiments performed on him while in a government concentration camp, V almost single-handedly brings the State to its knees.  But while most comic books teach a lesson in learned helplessness where humanity can only be saved through the divine intervention of super-powered beings, V constantly places the blame for his nation's troubles on the voters who are so eager to put their lives in the hands of others.  V acts as a Robin Hood for the new millennium, redistributing the only wealth of importance in the Information Age: Knowledge is not only power, it is freedom.  As people become self-aware, they become self-reliant, and soon they become unwilling to prostrate themselves before the trappings of authority.  While this is one of the single greatest works of graphic literature ever, V's battle to free the people from their elected masters may also be the most eloquent, moving, and gripping endorsement of anarchism you will ever encounter in comics or anywhere else.
6305807426|2.0|...and hang his head in shame for this subpar horror movie. Maybe I should have taken a cue from the brief introduction by Argento before &quot;Inferno&quot; started where he mildly praised the movie that I was in for a bumpy ride, because in a previous interview (at the end of &quot;Deep Red,&quot; actually) he claimed he &quot;didn't keep&quot; any of his films.  I thought, &quot;Oh great, he's trying to butter me up for what's ahead.&quot;<br />So, after seeing &quot;Suspiria,&quot; &quot;Tenebrae,&quot; and &quot;Deep Red,&quot; I was expecting something on the level of those horrors but instead got a terribly incoherent supernatural thriller (I guess).  To some degree, it can be said that Lucio Fulci did a little ribbing on &quot;Inferno&quot; to make &quot;The Beyond,&quot; but at least that movie was big, overblown horror fun that didn't wallow in the pompousity of its own artsiness.<br />The &quot;plot&quot; has something to do with the legend of &quot;The Three Mothers&quot; and an American music student who's searching for his sister but finds death instead.  The movie is basically set up in the opening credits, and even if you can follow that brief expelling of information, you'll still wind up confused...and more likely frustrated...by everything that goes on.<br />Argento, who made some of the best Italian horrors of the 1970s, seems curiously defanged here.  Even the maestro's usually eye-opening set pieces lack the urgency of his previous films.  Any fans of Italian horror will want to see this, at least once, but this is hardly Argento's best work.
B000002NC4|5.0|Having started listening to built to spill with there's nothing wrong with love, it took me awhile to get into this album, but when i did!  what a thoroughly cool album.  It's really different from tnwwl - it's far more dense and layered, and more epic.  The magnitude of the epicness is emphasized by the sheer length of the songs, as previously discussed by other reviewers.  <br />&quot;randy describes eternity&quot; has really cool lyrics and are aptly able to personify the sheer depth and length of eternity.  I feel the need to be religious whenever I listen to it. &quot;Made up dreams&quot; also has lyrics i really like.  In particular, &quot;Hard to believe, that after all this time, and after all this I'm still me.&quot;  Also, &quot;No one cares what you dreamt about unless you dreamt about them.  But don't let that stop you.  Tell them anyway.&quot;  It's some good stuff. &quot;Velvet Waltz&quot; is really beautiful with orchestral instruments and rock music.  It's a great combination.  &quot;kicked it in the sun&quot; is my favorite track, and untrustable is pretty cool too. All of the songs seem to be a combination of many two or more songs, but the concantenation does not seem forced - there is a natural flow to it all.  I can't say how much I like this album, but if I were to recommend a bts album for a new fan, i'd say get tnwwl because it's more accessible, and work your way into this.
B00001NFCY|1.0|This is, by far, the worst band I have ever heard.  Creed is bad enough when you listen without making references, but when you consider that everything they record is a ripoff of one thing or another the whole experience becomes doubly horrible (if this is at all possible).  I can't believe that anyone actually listens to this nauseating crap.   Creed is comparable in musical value to fingernails on a chalkboard (no offense meant toward the chalkboard).  Whoever signed these morons to a label should be institutionalized.  If there is an ounce of mercy in the world, Creed will mysteriously disappear from the face of the earth, never to record another note.
B00004SCX6|1.0|whatever she sings.... man! it's idiotic!!! it's obvious that she's just cashing in on her 'popularity' and this is just a bag of s***. the woman can't sing, she just basically sells herself to get album sales and people... it's just the packaging. the song oops i did it again is such an inane piece of drivel that it's sickening that there are people who writes this kind of stuff and call it art!!! i wanted to give this a -20 marks fer it's sheer ridiculousness but they wouldn't let me. the song stronger nearly killed me the 1st time i heard it because at the start she was shouting GREARGHHHHHH... YEEEAAAAAHHH!!!! and i thought that a frog was stuck in her throat! the song is really tasteless coz it's not 'catchy' and the beat is terrible... it just flies everywhere and it sounds worse than any racket that my 1 year old niece can produce. i can't even believe they're selling this vile pile of horrible, horrible art!!!
0393312836|4.0|What amazes me most about A Clockwork Orange is not the literary pretensions that Burgess set out with in creating it, but how quickly and easily he draws you into the world he creates.  Two things allow him to do this.<br />The first is the flow of his language, a thing that is doubly amazing when you consider that he had to invent a fairly complex slang vocabulary which can be more than a little off-putting to readers at first.  I say at first because within a few pages I barely noticed that I was reading words like &quot;rooker&quot; and &quot;litso&quot; instead of hand and face.  In fact, the language has a cadence and rhythm all its own once you become used to it that actually guides you through the story.<br />The second reason is Alex, the narrator of the novel.  Alex is a 15-year-old leader of a gang of droogs who has equal love for Beethoven and &quot;the old ultra-violence&quot;.  Something about this character makes him completely appealing, even as his actions make you want to turn away.  Or maybe appealing isn't the best word.  Fascinating, perhaps.  And Burgess doesn't have to do THAT much to make him that way.  Contradictions.  Simply things like contrasting violent tendencies with his effete nature.  Singing showtunes while beating a man to a bloody pulp.  I wish I could explain better, but maybe there isn't more to explain.  For whatever reason, I simply find myself pulled in by Alex and his antics.<br />Speaking of antics, though, I refuse to discuss the specific plot of the book (I think it's rude and a bit juvenile; besides, Amazon has that information already if you want to read it), but I WILL say that Burgess' book deals with many themes.  It is in ways a social critique, a &quot;fable about good and evil&quot; and a philosophical text that questions what &quot;the self&quot; entails and what freedom means.  <br />ACO is alternately bitingly funny and horribly frightening, and Burgess manages to paint a portrait of a dystopic future in whichstreet punks rob, rape and cause general havoc to everyone they can, parents are mostly useless and ignore their children because they cannot deal with the horrors in which they participate, and the government concerns itself only with good public relations rather than the welfare of its people.  Moreover, Burgess manages to do this with seeming ease.  <br />Please do not think that if you have seen the movie you do not need to read this book.  While similar in plot, Burgess intends certain thematic differences than Stanley Kubrick completely dropped the ball on in his movie.  This will become crystal clear if you read this version of the novel, which contains the much debated 21st chapter that was not originally released in the United States.  <br />My personal feeling on this chapter is that Burgess did not understand his own novel enough if this is the way he intended to end it.  I say this because there are certain things that happen in this chapter that I cannot find any evidence for in  the rest of the book.  I feel like Burgess began to write one book and then just decided that he couldn't follow through with it.  For this reason I call ACO flawed brilliance.<br />But don't let the first word draw your attention away from the second.  This book is brilliant, and well worth a read or two.  I am even glad for the inclusion of the last chapter, because it is what Burgess originally intended and opens up interesting lines of discussion.  <br />Others books would be so lucky to have a flaw as wonderful.
0930289234|5.0|This seminal work of graphic literature is the \\"War and Peace\\" of superheroic fiction.  While it would qualify for this distinction in length alone (338 pages of comic book story plus 46 pages of supplemental text material interspersed between its 12 chapters), the sweeping scope of this Wagnerian epic and the ironic interplay of words and pictures that fills every page, combined with its unflinching examination of human violence-both on a personal and political scale-make this a truly momentous literary achievement, graphic or otherwise.<br /><br />This work was principally responsible for a fundamental change in the way superhero stories have been presented since the mid 1980s.  Deconstructing the traditional \\"comic book\\" conventions of the \\"men in tights\\" genre, Moore treated the seemingly absurd notion of costumed crimefighting with a depth and seriousness that leant it a newfound credibility. Rather than populating his fictional world with the types of demigods that fill more traditional superhero universes, Moore created a brand new pantheon of all too human mystery men and women, almost all of whom were merely eccentric but well-meaning citizens trying to make their communities a little safer.  These heroes include the scientific wizard and avian aficionado, Nite Owl; the daughter and namesake of the 1940s heroine, Silk Spectre; the paragon of human mental and physical perfection, Ozymandius; and the brutal trench coat-wearing psychopath, Rorshach, who conceals his identity behind a white cloth (pulled over his face like a stocking mask) that contains a constantly shifting pattern of black blotches.<br /><br />And what was America's reaction to these quirky costumed do-gooders?  In the 1970s Congress passed the Keane Act, a law banning costumed vigilantism and forcing most of them into retirement. The only official exceptions to this ban were the nearly omnipotent being, Dr. Manhattan (capable of anything but remembering what it was like to be human), and the gun-toting misanthrope paradoxically known as the Comedian, both of whom operated as US government agents. It is only when Rorshach--who has continued his crime fighting career in defiance of the Keane Act--discovers that the Comedian has been murdered that this cast of former heroes is reunited and forced to deal with the unresolved conflicts of their convoluted pasts.<br /><br />Written during the Cold War (which, unbeknownst to Moore, or practically anyone else, was actually in its death throes at the time) the threat of nuclear Armageddon constantly looms over the characters in this story, lending an even greater urgency to their personal struggles and unfulfilled dreams.  This saga is so complex and enthralling that I have made new discoveries each of the nearly half dozen times I have read it.  Along with Moore's [[ASIN:0930289528 V for Vendetta]], this is perhaps the most masterfully crafted work of graphic literature ever created.gun-toting misanthrope paradoxically known as the Comedian, both of whom operated as US government agents.

B000056JYB|5.0|I sincerly question the decision to make this a double disc release with a double disc price (evidently, so does Polygram, as they are releasing it in its original format), but that does not take away from either the fine music that comprised the original album, or the wonderful remaster it has received.<br />I might mention that Dennis Drake actually did a fine job with the original digital remaster in, I believe, 1990.  He gave a low end to the sound that it lacked in it's LP form.  But this release is a revelation!  The full, lush low end now compliments and balances the thinner, upper register sounds that previously dominated (Winwood's voice, organ, piano and the guitars).  <br />At first, it seems that the high end has been compromised compared to the original Drake remaster.  But after several listens, I believe that to be an aural illusion due to the incredible low end that exists on this disc.<br />Let me just say that this is one the true lost classics of rock. Everyone always criticized Blind Faith as being a money-grubbing supergroup who were rushed too fast and burned out too quickly.  This is all true, but that certainly wasn't the intent when they started.  Their mistake was letting the sharks in.<br />Maybe the album was rushed, but man, what a sound.  It is clear that Winwood, Clapton and Baker were creating something quite unique.  And bassist Rick Gretch (ex-Family) actually keeps up! and contributes a wonderful violin solo to Sea of Joy.<br />The oft-criticized &quot;Do What You Like&quot; is actually a wonderfully arranged and recorded excursion in 5/4 time; maybe the drum and bass solos go on just a bit too long...and maybe they don't.  The drum sound that Baker and Jimmy Miller, the producer, create is just absolutely stunning.  Could be used for a test record today to showcase both stereo sound and drumming pyrotechnics.<br />These are inspired musicians creating a fire under some really fine songs.  Put on Can't Find My Way Home and tell meyou've ever heard anything like it.  I dare you.<br />And what about the additional tracks on disc 1 and jams that comprise disc 2?  Hey, with a band this hot, why not see what they were up to?  Nope, nowhere near as brilliant as the original album, none of it, but still, isn't it worth a listen?<br />If you decide that it isn't, then I suggest the &quot;new&quot; remaster that just came out, that contains just the original album.<br />It will keep you happy for days.
B000003TAW|4.0|Last night my friend and I were driving down the road and we were just blaring this cd and rockin to it while speeding around.  Just listening to it again gave me a big goofy smile on my face as I song along to all the lyrics from every song.  There's nothing I can emphasize in particular, because every song is just a pop rock masterpiece.  Not only is it just catchy, but it's lasting.  Particularly, weezer is on tour right now, and nearly every show is sold out, years after their last release.  People still want to go see them, because they're amazing and the longevity of their work is evident.  Buy this cd, and then buy pinkerton.
B00003CXA6|5.0|Gettysburg has to be my favorite movie of all time. I am disappointed that the extra scenes are not part of the DVD, for those explained in a little more detail the Confederate debacle in front of Cemetery Hill. Although there are some historical flaws, and some of the beards are pretty goofy looking, I felt that the movie was historically accurate. I think there should have been more details about the second day then there was. Not once in the movie was the bloody fight of the first Minnesota mentioned (The book passively mentioned it). However, the drama of Chamberlain's charge gets me every time I see it, as does Pickett's charge. To top it off, Randy Edelman's soundtrack is beautiful and appropriate. I have to admit that I have only seen it through one time (However, I have probably seen it a dozen times if I combine the partial viewings.) I recommend this movie to anyone willing to sit through the 4 hours plus.
B0000560X1|5.0|If you bought benson's 80's pop album and know little else of him, then this vid is for you.  If not, it is absolute waste! I bought this thinking I was going to see benson the musician.  What I got was benson the entertainer.  -a cheesy hotstepper mugging for the camera.  There were hardly any close-ups of his actual playing.  This vid is not for jazz fans looking to really see benson play guitar closeup.  The camera work was horrible.  You get to see benson singing and dancing from a distance like in a britany spears video, but you almost never see him or his fingers closeup except for a second or two by accident -and even then the shot quality is not good.  Jazz fans, take my advice and don't rip yourself off like I did.  I know its tempting after having waited so long, and as much as you might want to think that anything is better than nothing -you are wrong.  Don't know what benson's handlers were thinking when they put this stinker out, what a disappointment. -especially considering that while we all really dig and admire benson's pop stuff, his core fanbase is very into benson as a jazz musician and virtuouso guitar player.  This thing has all the right teasers, but none of the package substance.  Bypass, bypass, bypass.
0060920084|4.0|Bill Bryson is one of the funniest authors around.  I recently finished Lost Continent, one of his earlier books, and found it very enjoyable.  Bryson is able to have a unique perspective on America, being both a native Iowan - but one that has been away from America for many years.   Bryson's commentaries on many of the changes in America were very  insightful. Overall, I found this book much more rough around  the edges than some of his more recent books, but still a very funny read.
B000053VAF|5.0|It helps if you've had a formal religious education, but anyone can enjoy Dogma, as it pokes fun at organized religion, and especially the rediculous rules of the catholic church. It's got everything: satire, dialogue, action, jay and silent bob, and even chris rock! It's a must-see.
B000002UDB|4.0|More a collection of singles than any other album the Beatles recorded, Magical Mystery Tour has some wonderful songs. Strawberry Fields and Penny Lane were the first two songs recorded for the Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band album, but didn't fit as the concept album developed.  Those songs were the impetus that began this adventure.  Much more a Paul influenced album (as was Sgt Pepper's) there are a few non memorable, but great Paul songs ie Hello, Goodbye and Your Mother Should Know.  John wrote only 3 of the songs, but All You Need Is Love was a defining anthem for a period of time where the worlds culture was strongly influenced by the Beatles.  (All You Need Is Love was chosen by Britain to represent their nation in the first world wide transmission of television.  That's pretty damn historic stuff!)  The surreal sound and imagery of Strawberry Fields is one of the best experimental tracks ever recorded by the Beatles.  Baby You're A Rich Man, like A Day In The Life on Sgt. Pepper is a song where Paul and John collaberated together in writing.  As in the latter, each wrote their part of the song and blended them together.  The collaberation was something they had not done often the last year and a half, and would not take advantage of again until Abbey Road.  This may be one of the fab four weakest albums, (only Let It Be could be considered a cousin) but it was and is a Beatles album and they never produced anything bad.  Appreciation for the Beatles will live forever because of their unique dynamic, incredible talent and their passion for writing and recording.  They were the hardest working band in rock and roll and should enjoy the pinnacle of fame and success they worked so hard to earn.
B000056N8X|4.0|This is an excellent movie.  If you are a Highlander fan, of the television series or the movie series, this is a MUST own.  It's been a long time since I watched either and it really didn't matter.  I thought you might have to be up to date with the t.v show or the movies, but you don't.  This movie has a very good story, along with an excellent cast.  The bond that they show between the Connor (lambert) and Duncan (paul) is fantastic.  This movie does explain somethings that were i believe, left untouched in the series.  The build up towards the final battle is  awesome.  Good special effects + good story + good actors + highlander movie= Four Stars.  Not to mention that this DVD is a 2 DISC pack that is packed with an exclusive cut which has 11 minutes of extra footage!
B00003W8NM|2.0|When Susan Faluhdi wrote a piece saluting this film, but really promoting her own book Stiffed, I decided I'd better have a look. We're nearing the end of the Century and the Millenium and the jig is up in nearly every direction. The Cold War is over. The major political fights in America are over lifestyle issues. The folks producing films are forced to use vaguely focused Arab terrorists as villians, because the traditional communists are our friends, sort of. And Feminists are writing books in defense of abused MEN.<br /><br />Its the perfect backdrop for a story about young guys so fed up with the ennui of these times, their only relief comes from knocking one another senseless. First its the two friends, Brad Pitt and Ed Norton who knock one another about while living in a broken down abandoned building. But in the words of an old Chrysler commercial, it starts a movement, a momentum a beat. And the Beat Goes On with fight clubs forming all over America.<br /><br />You would think Pitt would be the lead here, but its Ed Norton handling the narrative, the voice-over. Ed goes through the usual contortions. Bored in the meaningless job he holds in the corporate world, Norton quits and takes up an equally meaningless unemployed existence with Pitt. Why work for the soulless corporate machine when you can appear just as prosperous with no job at all.<br /><br />Lingering in the background is a decidedly un-English-looking Helen Bonham Carter. Helen hasn't a lot to do but smoke cigs and look downmarket and fetching. The storytellers are holding her out here in hopes that either Norton or Pitt will make a move on her. For Pitt, that is out of the question. Norton walks her home a couple of times. But Helen doesn't<br /><br />really get a lot of action in this movie. So much for the love interest.<br /><br />The movie is a guy thing you see. I can barely remember what the climactic scene at the end is about. Its just a lot of cosmic acting out; Jimmy Carter's Malaise. Its supposed to mean something, but it doesn't have to really, since its producing the requisite violence for a $75 million domestic gross. The violence is meaningless but necessary to stir interest among the 18-34 year old demographic this film is aimed at. Go see the Brad Pitt movie about Tibet, or catch Ed singing in that Woody Allan film of a few years ago. The Fight Club should have been aborted at birth.Malaise.

B00003CXE7|5.0|Based loosley around the film 'Fall of the Roman Empire', 'Gladiator' is a brilliant epic from director Ridley Scott, bringing the glory and bloodshed of ancient Rome back beautifully. Whether its the gorgeous visual effects, moving story and music, gritty battle sequences, or superb acting that gets you, one thing is for certain: Gladiator is an epic adventure, worthy of all its hype.<br />Russell Crowe's explodes into the spotlight with his role of Maximus, the greatest soldier and general in the Roman army.  When Marcus Aurelias is murdered by his son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix, who plays the role of the 'evil' emperor to its limit), Maximus is sentenced to death.  His family is murdered, and he barely escapes execution with his life.  He is picked up, sick and weak, by slavers, where he travels to Africa and becomes a gladiator.  With the help of his new found friends, Maximus eventually rises to Rome, where in the Coliseum, he prepares to take his revenge on Commodus, and free Rome and his once lost love, Lucilla (Connie Nielson).<br />The story itself is beautifully crafted around actual historical events.  For example, Marcus Aurelias was murdered by his son Commodus.  Commodus did go mad.  Commodus did fight in the gladiatorial battles of the coliseum.  and Commodus was killed in combat by a gladiator.  By using these true events to act as connection points, the story flows together, with love and war and revenge all into one.  The music, by composer Hans Zimmer, is absolutely outstanding, though the Celtic feel of it sometimes seems out of place.  The special effects are impressive; never before have we seen Rome or the Coliseum like this.  And acting is excellent from all.  <br />The movie is not perfect.  There are minor plot errors, as well as historical aspects that are fictional (the Roman army did not have archers at that point in time; Roman swords were meant only for stabbing; Romans did not have saddles on their horses).  But these are minor in thegrand scene.  And grand it is.   Gladiator is by far one of the best movies to come out in quite a while.  It easily ranks up with BraveHeart, El Cid, and other historical epics, and deserves every award it has gotten and will get.  Don't miss this one.
B000002MQ9|5.0|WITHIN THE REALM OF A DYING SUN was the third LP by Dead Can Dance, the duo of Lisa Gerrard and Brendan Perry, released in 1987. In it, they go further with the classical structures explored in 1986's SPLEEN AND IDEAL and in doing so forged what may be their best album.<br />It's remarkable that Perry and Gerrard wrote the music for this album after simply picking up a couple of books on scoring. This is an album that, after the somber introductory tracks by Perry, moves into clashing cymbals, thundering timpanis, and exploding brass. The musicians who accompany Perry and Gerrard are extremely skilled, and Peter Ulrich, percussionist, adds a great deal of talent to the album. And of course, there are the voices. Brendan Perry's voice is among the most profound and sagely of modern music. And Lisa Gerrard, as anyone who has heard her sing, has the voice of a goddess.<br />Other reviewers, much to my chagrin, have thought of this as a &quot;goth&quot; album. Although the album is indeed dark, Perry and Gerrard have always denied attempting to present a gothic image. This is a somber album because Perry further explains his world-view, and because Gerrard's tracks move the spirit in a way that is too sacred to make light of.<br />Some have criticized this album's layout, saying that it is a mistake to divide the album into a first half of Perry's philisophically pensive songs and a second half of Gerrard's choral pieces. Nonetheless, part of what makes Dead Can Dance's work interesting is the duality between the two musicians, and making the album bipolar merely highlights the differences between their styles.<br />Every track on this album is excellent, and this was the first album I ever bought where I can't complain about even a single song. WTRDS is probably the best place to begin listening to Dead Can Dance.
0393312836|5.0|After following a few violent days in the life of  Alex, the anti-hero of Anthony Burgess' A Clockwork Orange, and his friends (his `droogs' in the slang of the time), we're obviously supposed to be shocked when we he declares, after murdering an elderly woman, \\"And me still only fifteen..\\"<br />Yawn.<br />Maybe when written in 1962 this was shocking.  Post-Columbine High School, most people have become numb to violent acts committed by children.   The fact that Alex and his gang's favorite pastimes are spreading terror, theft, and rape, may even seem tame by today's standards.  Yet we should be appalled, none the less.  Not at his age, but with the cavalier attitude towards death and the destruction of the lives of others.<br />It is a well known fact that Burgess was dismayed at the success of A Clockwork Orange.  In the introduction to the 1986 reprint, which included the \\"missing\\" 21st chapter, never published in the United States before (more on that later), Burgess says he would \\"be glad to disown it for various reasons, but that is not permitted.\\"  While ACO survives, other works of his that he values more, \\"bite the dust.\\"  Such is the life of an artist. Our humble narrator is a 15-year old leader of a small gang of droogs.  The four spend their after-school hours wreaking as much havoc as they can muster.  Of course, boys being boys, someone has to lead the pack.<br />As the result of a power struggle within the little group, during a bungled robbery attack, Alex takes one across the glazlids, and is left blinded for the police to pick him up.<br />Though sentenced to spend 15 years in prison, a stroke of luck gives Alex the opportunity to participate in a new experimental aversion treatment for violent criminals.  He emerges from prison a changed, if not particularly new, man.  The violent impulses are still there, but he is overwhelmed by nausea whenever they rear their ugly head.<br />Enter Politics.<br />Now a \\"victim\\" of the state, the opposition political party that is fighting the government's recent crackdown on violent crime seizes upon Alex's plight.  He becomes their poster child for overthrowing the oppressive regime in the next elections.  Tormented by his present condition, Alex attempts suicide by leaping from a window.  His failure only draws attention to the issue (the opposition is delighted) but prods the government into righting its previous &quot;wrong&quot; by changing Alex back to his old self.<br />\\"I was cured all right,\\" the original American version ended.  So now our little droog is back to the way he was; violent, chaotic free will and hormones raging.  Ready to prey on society once again, only now with a good paying government job from his new friends.<br />The new version or, perhaps I should say, the original version (now available in the U.S.) has an entirely different ending.  In the final chapter, our \\"young thuggish protagonist grows up.  He feels bored with violence and recognises that human energy is better expended on creation rather than destruction.\\"   This version, Burgess believes, is a true novel as it is founded on the principle that human beings change.  The old American version was a fable as are all fictional works that fail to show change in human character.<br />The prison chaplain, who befriends Alex, puts it succinctly when he says, \\"When a man ceases to choose, he ceases to be a man... It may be horrible to be good.\\"<br />He warns the pre-treatment Alex, \\"You are passing now to a region where you will be beyond the reach of the power of prayer.  A terrible terrible thing to consider.  And yet, in a sense, in choosing to be deprived of the ability to make an ethical choice, you have in a sense really chosen the good.  So I shall like to think.&quot;<br />Burgess, like his jailhouse preacher, is a strong believer in free will.  They are appalled that government could decide to take away one's ability to make decisions between right and wrong.  If that happens, a person is no longer a person and the fact that they will no longer harm anyone else is secondary to the fact they have been harmed themselves.  Then what is the point of punishing criminal behavior?<br />Which brings us to the final, omitted (dare I say censored?) chapter.  In the original novella, and the revised American version, Burgess' character has a sort of realization that maybe the life of violence he has lead is not the right way.  Maybe he should even get married and have kids - not that he would be able to control them any more than his parents did him, but just maybe...  Is this a true conversion in Alex?  Or is it the idle prattle of a common street thug?  Burgess intends for us to believe that it's the beginnings of a true change.<br />Suppose it is.  That's not a hard thesis to support.  Alex himself recognizes that something is changing.  \\"There is something happening inside me,\\" he says, \\"and I wondered if it was like some disease or if it was what they had done to me...\\"  But Burgess fails to take the cue from his own character.  <br />Perhaps out of resentment for the original omission of his last chapter, Burgess refuses to even recognize that maybe it was the punishment he received that has lead to the new Alex.  Instead, he gives all the credit to Alex's free will.  Perhaps.  After all, as he says, \\"The important thing is moral choice.  Evil has to exist along with good, in order that moral choice may operate.\\"  <br />And so it must.
B00003CWN2|5.0|Boys Don't Cry seems like a hundred other exploitive teen films as the film credits roll over scenes from Nebraska small town nightlife. Its a world of young working people, not long out of high school. Happy at being freed from parental constraints they seek thrills at after-bar-parties. There is drinking, hanging out in taverns, the occasional beef leading to a fight, karaoke singing, dangerous jousts and high speed chases in cars.<br />The familiar scenario becomes less so with the appearance of a boyish-looking girl- Teena Brandon- who looks like an extremely un-macho high school male.<br />Hilary Swank, the actress who portrays Teena, is in almost every scene of this perfectly plotted if suspiciously predictable story.<br />Brandon lives in Lincoln, Nebraska, but she is having a lot of difficulty there. Her attempts at bedding a member of her same sex are getting her into serious trouble. A male friend who lives in a trailer warns that her behavior will lead to violence against her after Teena is chased to his place by gay-bashers.<br />Teena hits on a solution. She decides to try her luck with other girls in another city: Falls City, Nebraska. Right away, the young set she encounters there take a shine to her. Teena fools this new crowd into believing she is a guy. At least she fools them for awhile. Our 21 year old leading character has reversed her name to become Brandon Teena.<br />She takes up with a group of twenty somethings and two older males who gather around the broken household of a divorced woman and her daughter Lana. Teena is smitten with Lana. And gradually, Lana gets interested in Teena.<br />This is a love story, a long love story. The gender &quot;problem&quot; is childs play for Teena to handle at first. But gradually, the &quot;family&quot; begins to have doubts about Brandon Teena. The story is delicately told. It is a surprise to see the storys sexual details revealed so explicitly. Though the explicitness lengthens the movie, I think director Kimberley Peirce and her co-screenwriter Andy Bienen were right to risk it.<br />The third act is extremely long. The nature of Teena's romance with Lana is dawning. There will be consequences. The mostly true story has a powerful ending. The scenario is a little too perfect, however. It is obvious the real story has been &quot;cooked&quot; slightly to strike the right moral: Homophobes are bad. I suspect Brandon's real experience in 1993 Falls City was quite a bit more complex.<br />The central characters are extremely well rendered. The story is superb even if it is a touch too long. Hilary Swank's young man trapped in a girl's body is extraordinary. Her performance reminds me very much of the young and innocent Judy Garland of the late 30s and early 40s. The actress doesn't look that male. Her innocence is thus key to putting over this extremely complex character. Miss Swank does it smashingly. I will be very disappointed if she does not become as big a star as Garland became.ector Kimberley Peirce and her co-screenwriter Andy Bienen were right to risk it.<br />The third act is extremely long.

B0000542DJ|5.0|JFK is Oliver Stone's controversial film about the conspiracy theories surrounding the assassination of President John Kennedy.  The film is based on the investigation that was started by New Orleans D.A. Jim Garrison.  The film is a visual marvel, with flashbacks, quick cuts, some scenes in color, some in black and white, all perfectly weaved together for a tight cohesive film.  The view of the film is that President Kennedy was killed by Cuban sympathizers and Lee Harvey Oswald was a part of the conspiracy, but was set up as the fall guy.  Whether you believe this theory to be true or if you think Mr. Stone is full of hot air, one can't deny the power of the film.  Kevin Costner stars as Jim Garrison and leads an all star cast that includes Sissy Spacek (as his wife), Ed Asner, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, John Candy, Kevin Bacon, Donald Sutherland and Gary Oldham who is perfectly creepy as Oswald.  JFK followed Platoon, Born On The Fourth Of July &amp; The Doors and completed Mr. Stone's look at the 60's.  He is often criticized for his views, but no one can take away the fact that Mr. Stone is among a handful of directors that use film to provoke us to think.
B000002NAK|5.0|A lot of people have problems with Madonna in the title role of Evita, as opposed to the indisputably better singer, Patti Lupone, and Antonio Banderas as Che. One needs to realize that singing is not the only thing that makes a production work. *Acting* should also be a priority, and I don't think there is anyone better qualified for those roles than Madonna and Banderas.<br />Madonna may not have the range of LuPone, but she has a very sweet voice, sounding very Evita-like indeed, that can be used both to charm ('I'd Be Surprisingly Good For You') and to fight ('New Argentina' and 'Hello and Goodbye'). LuPone may be an excellent singer, but she could not make me believe she was Evita. She came off as too old, putting too much strain in her voice, and generally sounding like a grandmother as opposed to the woman that seduced Argentina's most influential men. Also, she had no grasp of a real Spanish accent whatsoever, something that (because I live in a highly latino area) makes me wince to hear.<br />Banderas did a superb job as Che, and showed the world that he has a voice to match his looks. Although I was sceptical when I learned that Banderas would be the lead male, I was pleasantly surprised by his performance. He brings a vitality to the role that the original Broadway Che couldn't. In addition to his powerful accent, the dark bitterness in his voice during certain songs ('Waltz for Eva and Che' and 'What a Circus') draws one into the storyline better than the light, impersonal tenor of Mandy Patinkin.<br />While purists insist that the better singing makes the Original Broadway cast better, I prefer the personality and emotion in the movie soundtrack.

B00004Y62T|3.0|Anthony Minghella the writer-director has done a slight rewrite on Patricia Highsmith's the Talented Mr. Ripley. The Ripley of Minghella is a nerd, not in the same league with Dickie, the young man young Ripley has been sent to persuade to come home. Dickie wants to become a jazz musician. He is having a high old time just laying about in sunny Italy. Tom Ripley likes what he sees. Dickie's father believes Tom went to Princeton with his son, though Tom went to no college at all and is simply a slightly classy looking waiter.<br />As I said, Minghella's Tom is at odds with Highsmith's Ripley. Highsmith's Ripley is as flamboyant as Dickie is. Highsmith's Ripley is as cute and obviously upper class as Dickie. Minghella's character, played by Mark Damon, can do no soft shoe that even comes close to what Dickie does. Highsmith's Ripley is brimming with a boffo confidence that is really quite close to blundering. Minghella's Ripley could put tape on the glasses Highsmith would not even let the character wear. Minghella has created such a reluctant dweeb that the Highsmith story is seriously undermined. The idea is for Tom Ripley to replace Dickie and live his life. Minghella's Tom Ripley cannot possibly replace the splendid and aristocratic Dickie played by Jude Law.<br />The film is far too long. Dickie's girlfriend, played by the beautiful Gwynneth Paltrow, sort of stands around and does very little. Kate Blanchett, as another heiress on the continent who mistakes Ripley's true identity, is a little better, but Minghella uses her character to make the Highsmith novel more complex than it need be.<br />At the end, moviegoers are left wondering why Ripley keeps putting himself through all these conniptions since further attempts at fooling people about who he is, only tempts fate. It also doesn't seem the sort of thing the halting character played by Damon would do. The minute this guy gets money in his bank account, he would count his lucky stars and stop fooling around.<br />The Talented Mr. Ripley is a classy looking film, almost as classy as the Director's earlier English Patient. But this story is not quite the vehicle for this kind of classic treatment. Minghella has toyed with the story and damaged it. He would have been better to just film the story as Patricia Highsmith wrote it.<br />We find Ripley aboard ship in a bedroom at the end, trying to figure out what his next move is. We know this Ripley would never have taken chances like this. Minghella has left his hero up a creek without a paddle, and even the audience can't really see a way out for him. Minghella, you should have ended it twenty minutes earlier while you were still ahead.<br />The Talented Mr. Ripley is a classy looking film, almost as classy as the Director's earlier English Patient.

B000002KBD|4.0|His Band &amp; Street Choir is a solid effort from Van Morrison.  The album followed Moondance and while it's not as good as that album, it's still pretty darn good.  &quot;Domino&quot; is a bouncy number that became his highest charting single peaking at number 9.  &quot;Crazy Face&quot;, &quot;Virgo Clowns&quot;, &quot;Gypsy Queen&quot; and &quot;Call Me Up In Dreamland&quot; are all excellent songs.  &quot;Blue Money&quot; is the best song on the album with it's neo doo-wop, r&amp;b feel.
B0000025DT|5.0|I was a mere 5 years old when I first heard this album and had no idea why I enjoyed it so much. I must have driven my mother mad asking her to keep playing it all the time. By the time I was 10 I knew the words and the whole feel of the album from memory. When I grew as a musician, and a person, I finally realised why I loved this album so much- because it is so musically perfect in every way. From first to last this album is a true classic.   From the opening track of &quot;Tightrope&quot; you are transported into Jeff Lynne's unique vision of us as a people. I often find myself thinking what a true visionary Lynne was with the song &quot;Mission (A New World Record)&quot; with lyrics that mean even more today than they did 25 years ago.    Along the way we meet despair (&quot;Telephone Line&quot; and &quot;My Shangri-La&quot;) and joy (&quot;Rockaria&quot;, &quot;Living Thing&quot; and &quot;Do Ya&quot;) and it is as if we encumber the whole range of human emotions in a short space of time.    This surely must rank as one of the defining moments of pop/rock, certainly one of ELO's most defining moments.    I love &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Discovery&quot; but to me this album pips them all and I eagerly await the day the album is given the proper remastering treatment as has happened with other bands like Deep Purple and Kiss. The recent &quot;Flashback&quot; set shows that it can be done!   Until then I'll wait for somebody to throw me down a line!
B00003CXDF|1.0|This is barely worth one star. Dull &amp; confusing plot that is equally bad as the first MI. Here, though, the  action scenes didn't keep my attention that much. The overuse of slow motion seemed very stupid and ruined this review being two stars. You never know when it's going to happen and I found myself hoping that the next scene would be normal. The motorcycle 'joust' was ridiculous... and where does Hunt carry all of those masks?  <br />Annoying 'romance'; much too long at 123 minutes; <br />I was very glad when it was over and regret even renting it.
B000021Y74|3.0|I read someone else's suggestion that this German film would inspire Hollywood to copy it. It would if it were that original. I have seen this idea done twice already in America. The first was a short film about a man who was unable to avoid repeating the same few moments in his life, for an entire day. The documentary-like film had no stars. The next thing I knew Bill Murray was starring in Ground Hogs Day, an almost complete replication of the short film I had seen earlier. The short film isn't particularly a comedy, the Murray film is.<br />Run Lola Run is not a comedy either. Its a film about a girl who has 20 minutes to save her boyfriend from robbing a store. Manni, Lola's boyfriend, needs 100,000 in 20 minutes to pay his bosses back for money he has left on the subway train. His life will be forfeit if he is unable to pay this money to the men he works for as a courier. Three times Lola runs in order to help her boyfriend. Each time the scenes are largely replicated but there are minor differences in timing. These differences result in major differences in what happens. I'm not going to tell you why the sequence repeats three times or how it comes out.<br />Suffice to say that the film technique here is extreme razzle- dazzle. I don't think there has ever been a German film with this much heavy production and effects. Mostly we see Lola traversing a German city, going from one building to another, across one scenic plaza after another, running at full speed. In each rerunning of 3 very similar scenarios, her encounters with people, places and objects are just slightly off. The minor changes in time make for major differences in what happens.<br />I have to tell you the film was an obvious formula with too few variations, to excite me much. Some might like it. I didn't think it was as much a story as it was a production. I wouldn't recommend it. Its wonderful filmmaking but very poor story-telling.
0783240236|5.0|The Birds is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best movies.  The plot revolves around massive flocks of birds attacking a quiet Northern California town of Bodega Bay. A then unknown Tippi Hedrin is luminous as a young socialite from San Francisco who visits the dashing Rod Taylor in the small town.  A young Suzanne Pleshette plays a school teacher and former love interest of Mr. Taylor and Jessica Tandy plays Mr. Taylor's overbearing mother. The scenes were the birds attack are well staged and scary, but the times in between the attacks are truly chilling.  Mr. Hitchcock keeps things eerily quiet and the attacks happen so suddenly that you never see them coming.  Mr. Hitchcock is of course the master of suspense and this is another example of how he keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The effects also show his deft hand as a director.  Nowadays a director could just plug in the bird with digital effects, but Mr. Hitchcock had to use real birds in some scenes and fake birds on wiring systems.  This took a tremendous amount of skill and the end results are fabulous.  The effects don't look like the cheesy B movie effects of the time, but realistic.
0671578855|5.0|This was the first book that i read in the Miles Vorkosigan series. I know, I should have started with the first. However, it doesn't matter. It's a fabulous book. You could read it all by itself without the other prequels. But... I didn't do that. AS soon as I read this one, I went out and got Cordelia's Honor, The Warrior's Apprentice, and Vorkosigan's game. And read them. Is there more Miles to come? I hope so, and it is totally greedy of me, but I hope for a VERY long time. <br />A Civil Campaign is hilarious, I especially loved everything about the butter bugs. All the characters and their interactions are wonderful. The political scene is a romp. And Ivan's ex-lover's sex change and his reaction to it are...let me just say humorous would be an understatement. I am happy to say everything is carried off with a flourish and the story has an happy ending.
0875847706|5.0|The authors bring a unique and refreshing approach to the subject of achieving our God given potential.  This subject has broad application, in both business and personal realms.  The authors also provide very practical application techniques for their principles.<br />This is also a great gift for any child or adult who is struggling with who they are becoming.  I had my 9 year old daughter listen to a talk that Benjamin Zander gave.  This was over 1 year ago.  She still refers to many of his principles.  <br />This is one the best books I have read in some time.
B0000039LE|5.0|Well,I have to say that of all the slasher flicks that I've seen,this is truely the best.  For one thing,it probably has the absolute best story told of any horror series;very complex and scary,but pretty straight foward.Second of all,the music is what really made the movie a big hit.I truely believe that John Carpenter was the primary element in making the movie as popular as it is today.The music is scarier than Friday The 13th's,The Exorcist's or Psycho's.Next time you're on Napster search for it.There are many different versions of the theme so look for the one that's 2:58 long.Third of all,you can really feel as if you're in the movie itself.If you've had a bad day or really board,than this is the thing to help.You'll get so caught up in the movie that you will forget about your problem(s)or it will wake you up and give you something to do.  I now must appologize for spitting all this crud at you that really dosn't matter because that's not why the movie was made in the first place.The movie was made odviously to scare the heck out of people and it sure did the first time I saw it.(By the way,I am listening to the 20th Anniversary Soundtrack while I write this.)Something else that may strike you anti-violence people as odd is that this movie is one of the most talked about scary movies in history and is still today.Amazing right?Well,let me ask you this:what other horror series has been so popular for more than 22 years?DUH!Remember,it came to theaters in 1978.Pretty cool huh?And just think,with six sequals and another one coming to theaters October 2001,who knows what could happen?  Oh and by the way,if you have decided to see the movie because of my review,then skip the third movie The Season Of The Witch.It has absolutly nothing to do with any of the others.The first one is defenetly the best,but if you really want more carnage,I'd recommend the second (The Nightmare isn't over) and sixth in the series (The Curse Of Michael Meyers).The rest is just average for it's group.  All I know is that if your a blood and guts fan and you havn't seen this baby,than see it soon cause trust me it's worth it to hurry!st average for it's group.

0066620694|5.0|This book clearly deserves more than five stars.  It has positively influenced more technology executives than any other book.<br />The book does a wonderful job of explaining how traditions, bureaucracy, disbelief about the potential of new technologies, and misconceptions about the market hurt companies.  Professor Christensen is a Boston Consulting Group alum, as am I, and that firm has been very interested in the question of why dominant firms lose out to new entrants featuring innovative technologies. Professor Christensen has written the best work on this subject that it has been my pleasure to read. Unlike most academics, he is rigorous without being dull or irrelevant to those who must operate businesses. I particularly found his exploration of the differences between a sustaining and a disruptive technology to be very useful. His insights into how accounting and financial concerns can &quot;stall&quot; organizational progress were also valuable.<br />His cases (especially the hard disk ones) accurately capture many of the classic &quot;stalls&quot; that delay organizational progress. For example, tradition says that everyone focuses on serving the current customers. That's where the bread and butter are. Also, the overhead structure is established to serve those current needs.<br />Both perspectives no longer serve when a disruptive technology is involved, and he persuasively argues that being first with disruptive technologies is usually very important.<br />Bureaucracy comes into play because the authorization process requires a lot of confidence by those who will bet their careers that the market and financial projections will be achieved. The bureaucracy also increases the likelihood that an error will be made, or an unnecessary delay will occur.<br />Disbelief comes from the tendency to misdefine who the customers will be and to underestimate the long-term potential of the technology. Professor Christensen puts in some nice technology development/time charts in to show how to better anticipate a new technology expanding from a lower need-defined market into the mainstream market.<br />Misconception comes in because people misunderstand the danger of the disruptive technology, and how to manage it. THE INNOVATOR'S DILEMMA is very hepful here because it provides a model of best practices to cure the misconception stall here.<br />Three other stalls are often important: Procrastination (delaying when delay is costly); Ugly Ducklings (avoiding what is unattractive, physically or financially); and Communications (not getting the message or not understanding the message). I suspect all 3 play a big role in the cases here, but I could not tell from the way the cases were written. I hope in his future work, Professor Christensen will also tie his thinking into the idea of innovation itself.<br />I personally favor an 8 step process for improving innovation. One, measure everything you can in an area to understand how the measurements can help you improve. Two, apply the same approach to your most important activities. Be sure to consider how and why noncustomers do not find your offerings appealing. Three, seek out the best practices in other industries in these important activities, and estimate where these best practices will be in five years. Four, assemble a new combination of best practices from these cases that goes beyond what any one company will be doing in five years. Five, imagine the best that anyone will ever be able to do, ever, as the ideal best practice. In the case of disruptive technologies this would involve spotting them well in advance and being able to pursue them without pain to the rest of the organization, and pursuing very rapid adoption that leads to dominating the new marketplace. Six, find ways to approach the ideal best practice. Seventh, put the best people, resources, and incentives together to create great success in exceeding the future best practice and approaching the ideal best practice. Eight, repeat steps one through seven.<br />Do buy, read, and apply the lessons of THE INNOVATOR'S DILEMMA. This is pure gold. Also, send Professor Christensen a friendly note to encourage him to do more studies like this one on innovation. He deserves our support.<br />I also suggest that you set up some skunk works to advance potentially disruptive technologies, as a way to develop more experience in improving your innovative potential.  You may also wish to study Cisco's attempt to be technology agnostics, to see what you can learn from their experience as well.<br />Let innovation reign supreme!est practice.

0385493622|5.0|Singh does a great job here of bringing the casual reader into the world of mathematics.  True, the story is about the mind-boggling little riddle Fermat left for posterity, but the concepts and personages introduced go far deeper.  Singh also has the good sense to know when the advanced mathematics have left the reader behind, and paints the final modern stages with a much broader brush.  Still, enough of the early efforts are explained in such detail that the reader can still grasp the main ideas behind the complex equations.  Fermat's Enigma is a great read, and a good history of one devilish proof, but it is also a great overview of mathematics.

B000002IHD|5.0|Otis Redding's Otis Blue is among the greatest albums ever made. Every moment of this record is breathtaking. This is one of the earliest albums that was true soul, and it is most likely the best. All 11 songs are incredible. Otis Blue shows just how great of a singer Redding was. <br />Three things make this album so incredible. One of them is Otis Redding's voice. It is incredible. Few people could sing like Otis Redding. Whether it is a slower song, such as I've Been Loving You Too Long, an up beat song, such as Respect or even a blues song, such as Rock Me Baby, Redding's voice shines. There isn't one moment on this album where one woul question the greatness of his voice.<br />A Second and equally important aspect of this incredible album is the band. Backed by Booker T. and The MGs, the instruments on this album are wide and the playing is great. Also, Steve Cropper on lead guitar is essential to the greatness of the sound of these songs. Especially on Ole Man Trouble and Rock Me Baby, Cropper's guitar almost overshadow's Redding's incredible voice.<br />Perhaps the most important aspect of this album is just how great the songs are. Ole Man Trouble is a Redding original. It contains some great guitar work and Redding's voice, as always, is great. Respect, another original, is only about two minute long, but the energy that Redding and the band put into that two minutes in intense. It is very different then the later Aretha Franklin version. I like this one just as much, but it is up for arguement. A Change is Gonna Come is the first of three Sam Cooke songs on this album. Cooke was one of Redding's favorite singers and he did these songs in tribute to the recently deceased Cooke. In paying tribute, Redding's versions at least equal the originals and sometimes almost surpass. A Change is Gonna Come is a bit slower then the first two, but it is one of the highest points of the album. It really shows how great Redding's voice is. Down In The Valley is a great cover of the Solomon Burke original. I think that this version is even better. I've Been Loving You, another Redding original, was the biggest hit on the album. Again, it is a slower song that is very beautiful. Shake, a second cover of Sam Cooke, lightens up the mood and is just a fun dance song. My Girl, a cover of the immensley popular Temptations song, is just a sgood as the original. Redding's version, however, definitely has more feeling and emotion in the singing. Wonderful World is the third cover of Sam Cooke. This version again at least equals Cooke's version. Rock Me Baby, a BB King song, shows that Reeding can also sing blues. Steve Cropper's bluesy guitar almost overshadows Redding's voice. Satisfaction, a cover of the Rolling Stones song, isn't quite as good as the original (only because the original is so great), but this version is still great and is interseting to hear. The album closes with You Don't Miss Your Water, one of the best songs on the album. It closes the album with a bang.<br />Otis Blue is one of the greatest albums of all time, probably in the top ten. It is possibly the most essential album in R&amp;B history.

B000002UB3|5.0|Although Let It Be was the Beatles last release, Abbey Road was the last thing they ever recorded together in the studio. Despite the fact that tensions within the band were tearing it apart, they managed to come out with an amazing album. The album starts out with the bass heavy &quot;Come Together.&quot; This song has got it all:eerie vocals by John, a harmonized guitar solo, and lyrics that will blow your mind. It then goes into the George Harrison ballad &quot;Something.&quot; This song is a true classic and is arguably one of the best songs George ever wrote(except for &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;). The album then proceeds to go into such songs as the McCartney love song &quot;Oh! Darling,&quot; the corny, yet catchy, Ringo Starr song &quot;Octopus's Garden,&quot; the epic blues song &quot;I Want You,&quot; and another George Harrison classic in &quot;Here Comes The Sun.&quot; Although the first half of this album may be filled with popular songs and radio standards, the second half can only be described as an epic descent into madness. It starts out with quite possibly the worst Beatles song of all-time &quot;Sun King,&quot; and then proceeds to move on to better songs such as &quot;Mean Mr. Mustard,&quot; &quot;She Came in Trough the Bathroom Window,&quot; and the four short tracks that end the album. These tracks start out with &quot;Golden Slumbers,&quot; and then goes into &quot;Carry That Weight,&quot;(my personal favorite), &quot;The End,&quot; and finally &quot;Her Majesty.&quot; Perhaps the song &quot;The End&quot; followed by the mere 30 second &quot;Her Majesty&quot; was a sign that the Beatles would be breaking up soon. The world may never know.

B000050XEI|2.0|Let me make this clear.  I love Enya.  But this album is a very poor offering.  The songs are unremarkable and sound like leftovers that she hadn't been able to record previously.  Nothing very original here.  I had been anticipating a new from Enya for several months and sadly, was very disappointed.  This is a good addition for rabid Enya fans or for those who'd like to make their collection complete, but if you give it a pass, you really won't be missing anything.
B00000IAU3|5.0|I JUST LISTENED TO A COUPLE OF HER SONGS AND I WOULD HAVE TO SAY SHE HAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL VOICE ON A A WOMAN. SHE IS A VERY TALENTED PERSON AND I HOPE SHE COMES OUT WITH MORE ALBUMS.

SHE IS TOTALLY AN UNBELEIVABLE SINGER.
B000046PVN|5.0|I was very happy when rhino released this expanded soundtrack. Finally John William's Superman score the way it should be heard in all it's entirety. I got the original soundtrack long ago and was very disappointed with it. Hardly any of the best pieces from the movie were not in that soundtrack. Scenes like when Superman shows himself for the first time and saves Loise Lane, the death of his father Jonathan Kent, and the end credits the way it was in the movie. And if that isn't enough, you get more. Alternate versions of some of the themes and unreleased material. This soundtrack defiantly worth the money to any John Williams or score fan. In my opinion, it's not only one of John Williams best but it's one of the greatest scores ever written. The one and only flaw i consider with rhino's re-release of Superman is that it wasn't digitally mastered for sound quality. It wasn't super produced like E.T. and Radiers of the Lost Ark and the Star Wars trilogies. So, therefore it doesn't sound much better than the original soundtrack put out by W.B. But because u get the whole score and the packing is great, it's a very small flaw. Being able to hear the score in it's entirety more than makes up for the lack of sound quality. Some people were dissapointed with this release, although i don't see how. Any real John Williams fan would be satisfied and excited with this release. I'm hoping that John Williams score to the film J.F.K will also be re-released sometime because the original is totally unavailable. It is more than worthy of a re-release because it's also one of the greatest pieces of music ever done for a film.
0446677450|5.0|I just read the reviews, but am disappointed on what they wrote. People should be more open and listen.  You may disagree, but Mr. Kiyosaki's point was made. Look at him, he's a self made millionaire, and if you want to be one, open your mind and read what he has to say. I read the book twice and I think it's a great guide for anyone who wants to be financially free and be rich!.  It inspired me and made me want to be more financially literate!. Thanks Mr. Kiyosaki.  Hope to chat with you one day. :)

B00000IMTG|2.0|Rainbow's 'On Stage' is to me one of the weakest live alnums I've ever heard, especially cosidering it comes from the era when great live albums were plentiful. First off the mixing is dreadful;Blackmore's guitar is drowned out by the keyboards throughout. It also suffers from the same problem as Deep Purple's equally boring 'Made In Japan',possibly one of the most overrated live albums ever, in that the long extended versions of the tunes just meander, not going anywhere. If you want the line-up with Dio,stick with the superior studio albums. I think the were much better and more concise with Graham Bonnet and Joe Lynn Turner. This one's for completists only.
B000056MOD|4.0|I saw the movie 13 times in theaters.  I'm aware of what is in the workprint versions floating around and read the leaked script online. I've now gone to the store and rented the vhs version.  When I saw 87 minutes on the box, I was a little worried, thinking it was going to be exactly what I saw in the theater. <br />BUT it wasn't! It was so much better! This NEW and improved version has better continuity throughout and they pretty much closed all the holes in the original screen version of the story. I might have some preference to the slight differences in order or cut of some of the scenes (loft fight, love scene) in this release but I think that might be only because I saw the original so many times in the theater.<br />You can't get any better story than the story between Duncan and Connor. It was done to perfection. Christopher Lambert is at his best in this one.  He knows Connor and conveys his disposition so well.  Adrian Paul delivers drama and comedy and has all the skill, command and screen presence to bring every scene to life.  The martial arts/sword choreograhy was intense and thrilling and Donnie Yen and Adrian Paul's talent in this area is apparent. <br />More weight was given to Kell's character in this release which was badly lacking in the theater version. We are shown more about Kell and Kate's relationship (deliciously evil, awesome scene). Duncan and Kate's story is a tender and bittersweet mystery, driving the tensions of the movie. There is an important alternate scene in this release. It is much more fitting in a movie like this with so much death. Yes, immortality with all it's rules in this realm is about death and dying but it doesn't always have to be so. It is also about surviving. This film continues as the series did to explore the depths of such a premise and characters forced into the Game and what it means to them to be immortal. It is not just an action, sword and sorcery movie!<br />AND the huge, glaring JVC sign is GONE from most of the rooftop scene! Thanks I needed that! Actually, there are a few cosmetic improvements in this version of the movie.  The re-edited special effects, other added effects and the occasional different camera angle, were welcome additions.<br />Okay, now we can start begging for the director's cut and hope the begging works. I want to see more of director Doug Aarniokoski's work. (every scrap and shred of Highlander Endgame film!!) <br />Fittingly, redemption is a good theme for this movie. The theatrical version of the story needed to be redeemed and the fan's faith in the franchise sorely needed to be restored. Hopefully this is a start. I hope there is a Highlander 5 in the works continuing Duncan MacLeod's story. I can't see anyone else in this role but Adrian Paul.<br />For fans, this improved Highlander Endgame is a must see and newcomers will enjoy it as well. The producers and writers did an overall excellent job of bending artistic and dramatic license to bring the movies and the television series together.  If you are not to strictly obsessed with the other Highlander movies and can let go your imagination a little, you will really enjoy this one.
B00003CXE6|5.0|I'm not normally a fan of Hollywood movies, but&quot;Gladiator&quot; is not the norm.  Although there were severalcircumstances in this film, which I sincerely doubt would ever havehappened in true roman times (ie.  the emperor (joaquin phoenix)fighting maximus (russell crowe) in the colliseum and the suddenchange of heart within the praetorian guard), this film truly deservesfive stars.  Crowe gives a splendid performance as the fearlesssoldier, merciful and uncorrupted and yet unfailingly worldly.Despite the violence, which Crowe's character displays, his love forhis family, his humour in the face of death and his profoundphilosophy is truly memorable.  Moreover, Phoenix plays such aconvincing villain that he forever more will be ingrained in my memoryas a &quot;drip.&quot; In addition, the musical score for this filmpossesses a certain irony as it swells into epic song in the mostgruesome parts.  Best of all is the ending.  Although it was fairlyobvious that Maximus would fulfill the former emperor's legacy, theway the film turned out was a pleasant surprise....Parts of this filmwere surreal and others were brutally &quot;real,&quot; for lack ofbetter definition.  As it is, this film is one that I plan onpurchasing for my permanent collection.
0553571338|5.0|This story takes place in a future in which there are no choices. There are ordered little communities in which there are many rules and all people's lives are planned out by committees. In one such community, a young boy named Jonas is chosen to recieve the memories of all history. These memories of emotions are taken on by one person in the community to protect all the other people. At first, Jonas is a little scared of his new assignment. After a while, though, he can no longer understand why people have chosen to live without choice and emotion. Thus, he and the Giver, being the only two people with these memories, hatch a plan to try and give these memories back to the community in a hope to change it.       I found this book to be extremely interesting. I would recommend it to anyone, but especially to people who like deep, science-fiction type books.

0385484518|5.0|Morrie Schwartz is Mitch Albom's favorite professor at Brandeis University.

As they grow older each year their relationship is no longer teacher to student, they become friends.  Morrie is his mentor and like a father to him because he helps Mitch through college and the struggles with everyday life.  Although Mitch promises to visit after he graduates, like many such promises, it was not kept.  One night, almost fourteen years later, Mitch is flipping through the TV channels and Ted Koppel, from Dateline, says, &quot; Who is Morrie Schwartz? And Why after tonight will you love him?&quot;  Mitch went numb.  While watching the program Mitch discovers that during the summer of 1994, Morrie recieves a death sentence when he is diagnosed with ALS and only has two years left to live.  Mitch resovles to go see the professor that changed his life.  Morrie is a remarkable man and teaches Mitch a  &quot;lesson&quot; that Mitch will never forget.  The Most interesting aspect of the main character, Morrie, is his ability to stay so optomistic when he knows that he is going to die so soon.  He opens up to everyone around him and makes the best in his horrible condition.  This book is a must read.  The captivating story of these two men will touch your heart in many ways.  Morrie tries to convey the message that people should not be afraid of death but rather live your life to its potential and not be distracted by superficial matters.  This story makes you look at your self in a way that you never have before.  Once you pick this book up it will stay in your heart forever.

0440219078|4.0|\\"The Giver\\" is a very strong novel whose main point is the importance of differences and choice.  Also especially important is the theme of safety over freedom.  It demonstrates these points by showing a society with very few differences and freedoms.  In these respects it is very similar to \\"1984\\", and \\"A Brave New World\\", although it seems to be geared for a younger audience.  The story revolves around a boy named Jonas who is chosen to become the only one in the community who is given the capability to remember the past.  The rest of the community can only know things as they are now, not as they were before.  No history books or other reference materials exist, so the \\"Receiver of Memories\\", as the position is titled, is the only person with knowledge that can be used in new situations.  Everything and everyone else runs by a mechanical routine.  Eventually Jonas, encouraged by the former Receiver, flees the village in order to restore the memories to all the people.  The ends like \\"Lady and the Tiger\\" with no one knowing if Jonas makes it to a better place or dies in the attempt.  The biggest problem I saw in this book was the predictable plot.  Once you understood the job of the Receiver of Memories you could guess the rest.  The term \\"release\\" in this book is a euphemism for death designed to be mysterious, but given that those inefficient per the needs of the community are \\"released\\" and disappear forever.  You know that Jonas does not like or fit into the system, the old Receiver is idealistic and the book needs to make a point.  It fits that they would try to change things.  The only way to do that is to return memories to the people.  The details are just that, details.

There are Si-fi movies that try to create its own world throughout the movie, which is limited to only 2hrs.  The most great si-fi, including Star Wars, Aliens, don't try to explain to much or set rules for that world.  Those things, we can get from books.  That's what novels are for.  Starship Troopers is a great si-fi movie, not because it creates its own world, with lengthy history and explanation for tecnological pregress.  It's good, because its simply good for the eyes.  FOR YOUR EYES only.  Visually, it achieves the level of Star Wars and Alien series.  Story is simple and not too much of complications.  but, I still enjoyed it, because it most accurately portrays my imagination of what the future would be like.  This movie is simply great.  Get ready to visually stunned.  DVD has alot of extra features.  Great buy.
0425152251|4.0|I can tell you that this book is a lot more fun that sitting in a college or post-graduate philosophy class. I nearly choked on logical positivism in grad school, but this book makes Kant, Hegel and all the other greats of philosophy easy to absorb.<br />As a novel, I have some quibbles with the secondary theme; the mystery Sophie must solve seems a bit mean-spirited and manipulative to me. How she is treated by someone important in her life is, in my opinion, not how I would treat a child or anyone else, for that matter.  The entire tone is a bit teasing, like a superior college professor leading on a neophyte student. Not entirely good natured.<br />Still, this is an unusual book and very helpful for understanding a lot of western philosophy, which can be very DRY going at best. This creative book puts it in honeyed form, easy to take and smooth going down.

0767824571|5.0|This is without doubt the funniest movie ever made.  It's also the most intelligent movie ever made.  Think about it you take 5 Britt's who all went to Cambridge and Oxford you know you're not in for dumb humor (just very silly) This had some of Monty's best scenes.  Opening with the mighty King Aurthur riding form in search of knights, with his trust servant Patsy in the back banging two empty half of coconuts to make the sound.  And never ask how they found the coconuts please!  See Aurthur battle over liberated pheasants and vicious black knights, plus knights who say Ni! You'll meet Sir Lancelot the Brave, Sir Galahad the Pure, and Sir Robin The-Not-Quite -As-Brave-As-Sir-Lancelot, and the aptly named Sir Not-Appearing-In-This-Film.   You'll face taunting Frenchman and Killer Bunnies as well.  A bit of advice while watching this film. 1. Know the air speed velocity of an un-laden swallow.  And 2.  Know why witch's burn.  You will learn not to worry about horrid Black Beast's Of AAAAAAAAAAAAA because the animator will surly suffer a fatal heart attack.  Finally watch this film at your own risk.  You might just die laughing.
B000056PWV|5.0|&quot;Rear Window&quot; is Hitchcock's masterpiece...at the same time delightfully funny and chillingly suspenseful...The chemistry between James Stewart, Grace Kelly, and the wonderfully droll Thelma Ritter has never been equalled in any film, not even any other Hitchcock movie!  From the moment I saw this movie for the first time until this very day, I have been spellbound by this brilliant work, each viewing presents something new...some nuance that went undetected before.  There is a scene where Grace Kelly goes over to the apartment in question to try and find telling evidence...just as she is about to leave, the tenant in question enters, trapping her...I thought I was going to lose my breath...Sheer brilliance unmatched by any film---EVER!  Now, if you've never seen the film, I won't reveal whether this neighbor actually murdered his wife...but even if I did tell you, it really wouldn't make &quot;Rear Window&quot; any less enjoyable to watch.  I've easily seen it 30 times, and I enjoy watching it more each time.  The mood is set not by soundtrack music that says &quot;you're supposed to be scared here&quot; etc., but by the beautiful music wafting through the courtyard from the songwriter's apartment (watch for the cameo here) as he struggles to write that perfect song...The mystery begins with a sudden scream in the night, and deepens when Jimmy Stewart catches sight of the henpecked travelling salesman across the way making several mysterious trips in and out of the apartment at late hours during a thunderstorm...each time, carrying a suitcase.  Then, the next day, the voyeuristic Stewart notices that the salesman's nagging, invalid wife is no longer in the apartment, and the salesman seems suddenly concerned that someone might be watching him...especially as he wraps up some rather suspicious objects in newspaper in his kitchen.  Where is his wife?  Did he murder her?  These are things Stewart begins to wonder...and the viewer wonders right along with him.  If you have never seen this movie, you have no idea what thorough enjoyment you are missing.  The original &quot;Rear Window&quot; to which I am referring (not to be confused with the sharply inferior remake starring Christopher Reeve) is hard to find...but well worth the search.  If you can, don't rent it---buy it!  You will be sorry if you don't.  The only reason I gave this movie five stars is that I can't give it 20!!!  &quot;Rear Window&quot; is nothing short of the master's crowning achievement, a must for anyone, not just Hitchcock connoisseurs like myself.  If you only see one Hitchcock movie in your life, let it be this one!!! You'll never forget it!  And you'll want to watch it again and again!
0452282152|3.0|Note: This review is probably too harsh, but someone has to...<br />If you want to learn about Vermeer, Dutch life in 17th century, really good writing, or interesting plot twists -- this is not the best book. If you want a 200 page something to while the time on the train or on a plane -- you are welcome to read this short novel. Overall, there is not all that much to critique, except that I found the heroine too all-knowing and self-aware to exist anywhere outside of Dawson's Creek or a feminist study program. She does everything better than anyone, teaches Vermeer a few painting tricks, and clearly would be a superior painter had she been allowed to study. All of that is a bit hard to swallow, at least for me. Studies of domestic life are interesting, if somewhat rushed and biased towards the main character. This is probably a worthwhile read for 2 or 3 train rides, but unlikely to find a place on your bookshelf for a very long time. I do not usually buy paperbacks because they get ruined too fast, but in this case I am glad to have done so. Personally, I would recommend &quot;Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister&quot; for a much more interesting read on similar people at the same time in Netherlands or &quot;Headlong&quot; for a much better fictional &quot;painter&quot; book.
B000001FKY|5.0|oke, what can i say about Def Leppard, i just like it , the first time i heard was back in summer 1988 , i was only 9 years old, but as a child back then i was &quot;hysterical&quot; to hear my most favourite songs that was &quot;animal&quot; , it reach number one in UK and one and still the best pop-rock singles i ever listened to. until my high school era , i was fascinating , i sometimes listened the album three times a day , i played animal singles four times a day , and rate my self a whole year i listened the album  about 2500 times . And my old brother are saying i was crazy because my activity to played the band songs every day , i spent three years to collecting the entire album of Def Leppard , and the result is i am very lucky to have listened a band that have a very ugly start,and bad luck  until the most higher selling rock album all time beating bon jovi and Led Zeppelin albums. For the conclusion , i would like to say ,if you enjoy listening a modern pop -rock albums  you will regret it if you don't listen to all songs in Def leppard albums especially this album.
0790729342|4.0|According to the production notes that come with this beautifully restored version of the film, the filmmakers read books by Joseph Campbell before writing the screenplay for The Road Warrior.  What they had tapped into intuitively with the first movie, Mad Max (1979), they brought to full consciousness in the sequal.  It shows.  The Road Warrior is about story telling, it's about how culture, religion and the myths of the hero evolve in the primitive conditions of human beings fighting to survive upon the earth.  The characters are archetypal, the situations are primal, the technology has been reduced to what would remain in the wastelands after an atomic war.  There is so much at work here in terms of universal themes: the tension between ID And civilization, order and chaos, civilized religion and paganism, mind and body.  These themes would reappear in the 1985 sequal Beyond Thunderdome as Tina Turner attempts to carve a city out of the wasteland, the mind-body split coming in the form of Master Blaster, but that's another movie). Here things are grim indeed: A policeman has been reduced to scavanger and seems indifferent to the attempts of the refinery tribe to rebuild society (as Max puts it in Beyond Thunderdome to the tribe of children wanting to return to their city of birth, &quot;There's nothing left. It's all gone!&quot;)  The brutal mass-murdering Humongous, a cross between a WWF wrestler and Doctor Doom., is a vile evil villian but his voice cracks when he confesses a yearning for an end to violence and pain.  We get a sense that the morality of the Mad Max world is complex and not easily reduced.  Although the two-dimensional characters are grinning, savage beasts of violence, at least they are honest.  It is the good guys who betray Max in the end.  And the last image of Max standing in the wilderness, without car, without dog, without home or safety, left to find shelter in the midst of nothing, existing now only in memory, is one of the greatest and most powerful moments in film history.d most powerful moments in film history.
B00000J6AG|5.0|This album shows that &quot;mixed&quot; music isn't just boring and endless beats. Moby has the same qualities that Fatboy Slim and Chemical Brothers have, but moby rips the beats out in a wide arange of styles. This album does not get boring because of the different styles Moby comes up with. Some tracks are easily reconisabale like &quot;Porcelin,&quot; but some become your favorite songs like the great guitar track &quot;Everloving.&quot; Moby has made a very unique album which should be loved instantly.
6303269869|4.0|Story about a school worker wife and pilot husband with 2 children. Wife is an out of control alcoholic. Very realistically played out. Brought out some little know realities .. Like how the person feels when their husband/wife recovers. I disagree that this is only for people who have been exposed to alcoholism. It wakes you up to the seriousness of the problem but is not boring or &quot;heavy handed&quot; It is a good movie in it's own right.<br />Andy Garcia is excellent, I just love him. Not only is he is so good looking and so sexy but he IS a good actor. Meg Ryan does a pretty good job but with her I never quite forget that she is acting, it's not natural ... whereas with Garcia it is sooo natural in every movie he does. I thought the scenes in Mexico and the rehab center, and in their house were particularly good.<br />Definitely worth watching if you feel like a movie that makes you think.
0812550757|2.0|Well, I read Ender's Game and was definitely looking forward to reading the second book in the series...Speaker For The Dead. Let's just say I was quite disappointed. <br />This book was definitely a hard read. The first 200 pages had me wondering if anything was ever going to happen. Card spent way to much time setting up the ending of this book. The concept of a &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; wasn't exactly the idea I would have built a novel around. Quite frankly it was rather dull. The begining of the book started out exciting...then one of the xenologers was killed and he spent the next 150 pages telling us how terrible Novinha's and Marcao's marriage was...the problems with their children and so on. We learned very little about the alien species until the end of the book. Why the need for the use of the portuguese language? For a scifi book, there sure seemed to be a lot more talk about the catholic church than the alien species. Card should have entertwined the mystery of the &quot;descolada&quot; much earlier in this book. <br />So, to make it short, he spent to much time telling us about dysfunctional families and not enough time on the aliens or the &quot;Descolada&quot;. If you can stand to be bored through the first half of the book, the last 100 pages gets you turning the pages.
B000002UR7|3.0|My first radiohead CD was OK Computer, and that is my advice to you, buy OK Computer first, then buy the Bends, Kid A, and then buy Pablo Honey. Pablo has Creep and some other good songs but it's really only for the diehards. I think Kid A will still be popular in twenty years just like Darkside of the moon by Pink Floyd, but you should still buy OK Computer first. P.S. Don't forget about Coldplay.
0812589041|5.0|This is the first Orson Scott Card book that I have read. Being a fan of scifi and seeing that this was the first book to win Both the Hugo and Nebula award I figured I would check it out. Well, what can I say...this book is definitely a page turner and the ending...well...let's just say that it was an absolutely great ending. After  finishing the book it had me wanting to go straight out and buy the other books in the series.
0316286850|4.0|This book is a great addition to your bedroom bookshelf. You may not use it every day, but it's there when you need it. Mr. Aucoin shows you how you can transform yourself with makeup.He uses before/after photos and tells you what each of his models (young, old, black, white, asian, even men) should focus on.<br />Many of us have the tried &amp; true, day-in/day-out routine. This book gives you some great ideas on how to break out of the mundane and add some variety and interest into your makeup.<br />His ability to turn celebrities like Lisa Marie Presley, Julia Roberts, Gwyneth Paltrow and others into completely different looking people should inspire any reader to try something new.<br />In a fit of desperation, before a formal event, I grabbed this book for some ideas. I dug around my makeup collection and found the ingredients to try one of his looks. With his step-by-step directions &amp; illustrations, I was able to totally recreate a more engaging treatment. When my boyfriend picked my up, he looked at me with this surprised look in his eyes. &quot;I can tell by your face; you hate my makeup don't you?&quot; I said. &quot;No. Not at all, it's just so different. So Sexy.&quot; He responded.<br />'Nuff said.
0440219078|4.0|I am a  student that was assigned to read The Giver for class. The first night we recived the book I read it in whole. I couldnt seem to put the book down, the details pulled me in, and there was an element of suspense that wouln't let me go. As I was reading, I decided that this book was one of my favorites.  As I reached the end of the book, I was unbelivably dissapointed. This book, which was full of detail, had just left an ending out to the open. Had jonas died? Was he dreaming? What happened? It seemes no one quite knows. If you love a book with a great ending, dont read this one.
B000006YMP|5.0|Do you realise this woman's voice has probably appeared on more records sold than any other female EVER! Think about it, 360 million plus sales with ABBA and a few million more under her own name, no other female singer comes close. So being very familiar with Agnetha's voice I wasn't really sure what to expect from this solo album but I wasn't disappointed. Certaintly the material isn't as good as what she recorded with ABBA, but the voice and production is still there. Her soaring vocals and high range sound as superb as ever amongst a wide variety of styles. Stand out tracks include the title track, Stand By My Side, Can't Shake Loose. Definitely well worth it.
6304119046|5.0|Citizen Kane is considered by many to be one of the greatest, or even the greatest movie ever made. Orsen Welles changed the way movies were made with Citizen Kane by introducing many new camera angles and techniques and with its story structure. Unfortunatley, appreciation for Citizen Kane usually comes only from movie critics and movie buffs and is dismissed by others as `boring'. Admittedly, Citizen Kane is a very deep movie and it may require 2 or 3 viewings to fully understand it and to appreciate it for the masterpiece that it is.<br />There are a number of aspects that make Citizen Kane a classic and a landmark for movie making. The use of camera techniques and angles that Orsen Welles introduced are outstanding. The camerawork in Citizen Kane is outstanding even by today's standards. <br />Then there is the script. Written in such a way that it flows, never looses its way and always keeps you hanging onto every word. It really is one of the greatest scripts ever written. <br />Then of course, there are the themes in Citizen Kane. One is the fact that Kane wants to be loved but doesn't know how to love. Another is the message that riches don't bring you happiness. Charles Foster Kane was a man who had everything yet only really valued 'Rosebud'. Also, Kane was very high in terms of social status and knew a lot of people, yet he was still lonely. <br />Citizen Kane is one of those movies that can be watched over and over again and is just as good everytime. It never seems to lose its interest and has stood the test of time. Citizen Kane will probably always be regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time, and with good reason.
B00000768B|5.0|This album wasn't released in USA so I didn't own the CD until fairly recently, already having all the other ABBA albums. Technically this is not an ABBA album as it was originally released under the name of &quot;Bjorn, Benny &amp; Anna, Frida&quot; in 1973. Recorded in the early seventies, the ABBA sound as we know it today is not present on this LP. In fairness, the group started of as being a duet with just Bjorn and Benny. In fact one of their singles, &quot;She's My Kind Of Girl&quot; is included in this set. Bjorn and Benny frequently asked their girlfriends (Agnetha and Frida) to record backing vocals for them and their voices gradually started becoming more and more prominent on the recordings. This LP is the result, no hint of the group's name ABBA which came a year later. So with this in mind, Ring Ring is a fascinating insight into the progression of the group in its earliest years. There are a few songs here that I don't like (unlike the later ABBA albums), and a few hidden gems (Another Town Another Train, I'm Just A Girl, Nina, Ring Ring). Definitely not their strongest but I wouldn't be without this CD.
B000056N8X|5.0|Finished watching the DVD at 1:30 am 2/20/01EST. I almost didn't blink throughout the movie -- the pacing was great, the transitions logical, the continuity much better. <br />This was more the movie we were all hoping for -- Yes, even in my sleep-deprived state, there were things to nit-pick (some parts too long, some parts too short -- for me -- not necessarily other folks!!). <br />After seeing this version, one wonders what was the rush by Miramax to get the movie into the theaters -- to put an inferior (and badly reviewed product) out there defeats everyone's purpose. This movie would have made you a lot more money!<br />Anyway, in toto, this was terrific! <br />So, to paraphrase Professor Higgins in My Fair Lady: <br />&quot;Today, old boys, you DID it, you DID it, YOU DID IT!  I didn't think you could, but indeed you did!!!&quot; <br />Congrats!!!!!!
B00000JQFL|5.0|Hey, I was a high schooler and college student in the 70s, and Earth, Wind &amp; Fire was THE BAND, even better than P-Funk.  Saw EWF live each and every year beginning in 1972 at Fairleigh Dickinson University, then Madison Square Garden's Felt Forum, then Madison Square Garden, New Haven Coliseum, etc.<br />I think my point is, as has been pointed out by other reviews posted here, EWF was at their best on stage.  If there was any of the dozen or so EWF LPs I have that I would rate over all others, it is &quot;Gratitude,&quot; which captures them live and performing their great songs of the time.  I think their live version of &quot;Sun Goddess&quot; with Larry Dunn on keyboards surpasses their 1975 studio collaboration with Ramsey Lewis.  &quot;New World Symphony&quot; was a great innovation, and the studio &quot;new&quot; release &quot;Can't Hide Love&quot; -- can't tell you how many times &quot;the brothers&quot; and I used to sing that ending -- even hittin' those high notes!  The opening &quot;Power/Africano&quot; medley cooks, and sets the table for the run of the LP.  <br />The studio cuts are almost anti-climactic, as they cocncluded the original LP on its 4th side  The tunes are good, though.  They followed this LP/CD with the near-great &quot;Spirit,&quot;, and like other reviewers here have said, started sliding into a slick, commercial formula.  <br />I have always preferred harder edged, hard driving music.  &quot;Gratitude&quot; fits that bill and is possibly my all-time favorite live LP/CD.
B000002NFM|5.0|This is the best album that the Prodigy hace managed ot produce to date.  The album contains the UK number hit singles, Breathe and Fire Starter and the top ten hit Smack My Bitch Up.  The album is full of other top tunes like Fuel My Fire, Minefields and Funky Shit.  This is the album that people have been waiting a long time for and the Prodigy have managed to deliver it at last.  I just hope that their next album will be just as good.
B000056BSA|1.0|This film was a real letdown. With a star as charismatic and charming as Penelope Cruz it's hard to make a truly unbearable movie. But director Fina Torres has just done that. The story about a woman who flees to San Francisco to escape from her miserable life in Brazil, this movie was full of possibilities.But it fails on every level. The romance is cliche. The comedy is so very predictable. And the movie tries so very hard to be quirky..but it ends up being annoying.
B000002BMD|5.0|This was the Manic's come back album and i think it was better than people were expecting.  From the first to the last track the manics captivate the listener and wont let them go until they are fully spent.  The album contains the hit singles, A Design For Life, Australia (my Favourite), Kevin Carter and Everyting Must Go.  The album also contains great tracks like Further Away and Removables which show that the Manics have lost that edge that they had.
0790729644|5.0|Thus far,the pinnacle of an fascinating career....let it go further in this direction......Deserved all honors after repeated viewings.  A turn in recent films, as Clint becomes anti-hero turned hero...This SEXY man has more to come.
B000001FTD|5.0|It has been said that a drummer is the backbone of any band.  If thats the case, Charlie has the biggest backbone of any.  This album establishes Charlie as a great drummer - The '95 release Stomp 442 establishes Charlie as the greatest drummer of all time in my book. Most of this album belongs in the 80's where it was conceived, however there are several songs on it that remain timeless.  NFL, Skeletons in the Closet, and Indians are three such songs.  Charlie's drum work on Skeletons is nothing short of brilliant, and its not until the '95 release of Stomp 442, on American Pompeii, that he tops even himself (the ending solo on this song just kicks).  Both Charlie and Scott Ian have stuck to their guns over the years, both with Anthrax and the also timeless S.O.D, showing that they are still in it for the cause.  Just great people all around.  I applaud them both.<br />If your new to this band, this album is a must.  I would get this and SOD, &quot;Speak English or Die&quot;, and then skip everything up until the '93 release of Sound of White Noise.  Stomp 442 and Among the Living are both in my top ten albums of all time list.  Diamond Darrel's work on Stomp 442 is also good.
B000050FEN|2.0|After checking out a myriad of &quot;must haves&quot; in DVD, I bought the recommended, and after having enjoyed the theatrical release, and credits, watched terrible dialogue and sloppy moments throughout.  After the terrific credits the film is just flim-flam despite photography and actors.  Just style !!!...a remake of regurgitated ideas from &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; /the detective side.  Stick with &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; on any night.  Loved the credits!!!<br />Considering it was in New York, when can you simply travel to the desert in 1/2 hour..........? Or give a dinner party, and then explain to the guest AFTER dinner that your apartment is over a subway?

0767830555|5.0|The &quot;support&quot; behind this DVD is equal to the film. Interviews interlace with the terror of knowing that this film presages the reality that was to come, literally, with the suspense that was Hitchkock was all about. Photography=BRILLIANT A special citiation to Mr Special effect for creating what was a that time considered violent.
B00004Z459|5.0|I don't know why anyone would want to compare them with other groups. Just cause they mix rock and rap doesn't mean they trying to be the 'next' Limp Bizkit!  And they don't sound like NSync,not even remotely. These guys have their own style and its great to see new groups, especially ones who don't feel the need to justify their so called 'hardcoreness' by using a 4 lettered word in every sentence. As for real Metal,these guys make music they like, not because its real metal. Mike and Chester (vocalists) are both talented lyricists who deliver every word they utter smoothly and with meaning. The thing I liked about this CD is that the songs all had their own sound and the songs didn't have that boring monotony that a lot of CDs have. You know when all the songs start to sound the same. The best quality this CD has is its diversity and its appeal to fans of different genres. Theres a lot of harmonising (supplied by Chester)and ingenuously inflicted ryhymes (emceed by Mike)flowing over the inventive guitar,bass and drums.    Theres also a bit of electronica/trance/hip hop beats and good ol' scratching added by the incredibly original and subliminal Mr. Hahn. My personal favourites are A Place For My Head, Cure For The Itch and One Step Closer.  If you'relooking for that so-called hard core heavy metal with a four letter in every sentence or you just don't like rap metal, I wouldn't reccommend it. Otherwise this is a really good CD. Listen to the samples and if you don't like the CD, just don't buy it. Its that easy.
B00005AFVR|5.0|Bruce Springsteen's reunion tour with the E Street Band was a total success for both hard core and casual fans.  This 2 disc live set from the final concerts at New York's Madison Square garden shows why Bruce's biggest fans love him and are frustrated by his artistic decisions.  This live CD has performances that we fans have hoped for like the twin punch of Youngstown and Murder Incorporated.  But there is never everything we want.  The newgroups are full of &quot;Why wasn't X on the CD?&quot;  At least we get to hear an official version of 41 Shots.  Live Springsteen is always highly recommended.  No it doesn't have everything we hard core fans want, but it is a fabulous performance by one of rock and roll's greatest performers.
0792846303|4.0|Ok...when you start watching this film for the first time (or read the plot summary), you may be thinking that it is not worth your time, and even I will admit that when I first started to watch it, I was thinking that the whole premise was lame.  BUT...I found myself watching the film every time it was shown on television, and each time it created extreme chills and a tangible eerieness.  One thing that definitely contributes to the eerie mood (as in Halloween) is the music.  It is the perfect addition to a terrific horror movie.  Watch this one with the lights off (from midnight to 1 a.m.)!
B000056N8X|4.0|Originally, I went to go see this movie simply for Donnie Yen (Jin Ke), and at first I thought it was not bad, but now that I've just bought the DVD, I find it even more so fascinating to watch this time around (and what's great is that the DVD has some uncut scenes and cast interviews that give in-depth insight about their roles!).<br />I've only seen HL-1 and a few of the TV series, but I think Endgame makes a lot of sense and blends in well as a sequel. Though personally, I think this one has the best action out of all the other ones, especially the intense fight scene between Jin Ke and Duncan; it was fast and fierce. I was very impressed with the martial arts, it had long fight scenes (like HK style), and to actually see Adrian Paul go up against Donnie Yen!...WoW!<br />I especially love the storyline, its moody with a dismal sort of flow, very &quot;typical Highlander&quot;. Beautiful sceneries, nice transitions between past and present, and the soundtrack is quite entrancing. I also liked Kate/Faith's character (good acting), as Duncan's murderered wife, she certainly added an interesting twist. One thing that is a bit unclear is Conner's role; I still can't make out what his motives were - either that, or he purposedly wanted to portray a complexed being suffering from inner-turmoils!?<br />Overall, its an enjoyable movie. Then again, the HL stories in itself is &quot;out of the ordinary&quot;. It may be difficult for first time Highlanders to follow, but Endgame definately has an appeal that'll keep the suspense high for any viewer.
0453007686|4.0|This is interesting spin on the traditional story of the three little pigs. It is told from the perspective of the big bad wolf. I read this to my 2 1/2 year old and I doubt I will be reading it to him again until he's a little older. This book is geared more for older kids and adults. I found some of the concepts hard for small children to understand; comparing eating a little pig to us eating a cheeseburger. Most of the illustrations are very cute but some of them are a little abstract. This is very entertaining for the appropriate age group.
B00004YA66|5.0|You'll have to pardon my sappiness but, as a huge fan of movies, particularly action and suspense, I was thrilled when a friend told me about Frequency. He had seen it in the theatre and knew immediately I would love it. He was right! This has now become one of my five all-time favorite movies. While there are some technical aspects that might make viewers confused, I find that if you are looking to make too much of the technical side of this movie, you won't enjoy it for its true meaning.<br />As an adult woman whose father passed away when I was 11 years old, I can more than understand John's heartbreaking ache for the father he lost too young, even after thirty years. The characters blend well together and are believable but the most precious moment, for me, is the ending at the old ballpark. For those who have seen it youo might agree that coupled with the song by Garth Brooks, this scene brings tears to my eyes and an ache to my heart everytime. If I could have only one wish...that would be easy - to get the second chance that John does in this wonderful, heartwarming movie. Enjoy!
B000056VIY|1.0|this cd is awful, under the master mind of her friend/man p-diddy, J.lo is exactly that.. low. this is basically on the 6 but, with a slighty more puerto-rock feel. i only liked one song and that was for the beats only. but if you liked on the 6... then go or it.
B00004SU5J|4.0|I think personally that all true jazz lovers should experience the first two minutes and thirty seconds of  the 1st track \\"Rose Rouge\\" .....man, this is a tight groove. Didn't expect it to go into a house beat, but the horns over this makes it extra sweet. One of my favorite tracks is \\"Sure Thing\\", the only track I heard before having the CD. The way this song starts off had me hooked. The entire CD has a nice groove that would appeal to all jazz, house and acid jazz lovers. Thanks goes out to that \\"Amazon friend\\" who brought this CD to my attention...one luv. Good jazz, good beats, just an all around good CD. <br />oNe
6305169187|1.0|Well, well, well. If it isn't another disaster: the earth's gonna be blown up send-up. I've seen some weak, undeveloping, boring, unexplained movies in my hayday, but this one is far worse than anything I've ever seen. There isn't one element in this entire movie that wasn't COMPLETELY misdone:  the characters bicker and are annoying to watch, they are all different and act like real dumbies. Steve Buscemi is annoying and does nothing for the plot. <br /> The plot jumps back and forth and there are about 25-30 small scenes and lines that make me wonder if this movie was made to be stupid. They get so irrelevant. <br /> The heroes get on a shuttle and save the world in a wink of time. I hate how it had to show them go through basic training and it showed all of their personal lives to make this end up being three hours almost. The music is terrible, too. Real terrible. When the characters act serious, you just sit there and say &quot;Yeah whatever&quot; because it is so boring and unmoving that you know noone cares. Worst movie ever. No exaggeration.
0688170528|5.0|Being a college student with an attention span of a two year old when it comes to things other than the three B's(boys, beer, and bootie)this novel captured me in a way that no other author has ever been able to(as proven by my high school english grades).  Picoult does a fantastic job in incorporating the reader into the lives of the two families.  There were nights when I was up till 3 just reading to see what happens next.  It is a wonderful love story with Law and Order style mysterioso.
B000005HLV|5.0|This album is probably the best Black metal album out there. In the same league (in terms of excellence) as In the Nightside Eclipse, this is simply brilliant. Euronymous' guitar playing skill and song craftmanship comes out in full here for all to see. Hellhammer's breathtaking drumming is a delight - not simply pounding out the same beat ad infinitum - but shifts in pitch, tempo. You name it, Hellhammer can execute it. The glorious rumble of Varg's bass guitar (although way down in the mix, per Euronymous' parents request after the the Count butchered their son) are still evident (one can only imagine what the original must have sounded like!).<br />But above all, Atilla's glorious operatic style takes the album to an entirely different dimension. This style not only complements the music played, but adds an evil theatrical dimension, which contrary to what some people have opined here, makes the album 100 times better, rather than worse.<br />You have to buy this album. Sound quality is pretty good (especially when you compare it to some of Darkthrone's releases) Worth it just for the song Da Mysteriis Dom Sathanas. This album is way underpriced for what you are getting!!!!
0783239955|5.0|Besides being a comedy it has a plot as well.The director and the actors performed brilliantly. The movie is unpredicatable and the twists it takes is hilarious.  I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and would definitely recommend to anyone who is in for a good humor for the length of the movie. It is not a slap stick comedy which is even more re-freshing. Overroll comment &quot; the Dinner Game&quot; is definitely in a class of its own and would definitely be nominated for an  oscar my comedy category for foreign movies.
B00004Z459|5.0|This CD was a risk.  I usually have to hear a band on the radio before I buy their CD.  This was one of the exceptions.  I liked this disc so much.  I must have listened to this thing 1,000 times through.  It's a hit.  Anyone who buys this CD was most likely floored by the hard, speeding metal riffs and the rapid fire lyrics.  Sure, Chester sounds the slightest bit like a 13 year old who just hit puberty, but who cares?  The music is enough to bring a person to start jamming.  It is a real success and gets all the attention it deserves. (Almost 4x platinum, that is).  This CD has gone platinum so quick so fast and 4 times for a reason:  Because it is awesome!  I searched the whole thing for bad trax, and found none.  the best track is definitely \\"In The End\\".  The worst is \\"Runaway\\".  Big deal.  It convinced me that new bands can be very good, and this became my favorite.  BUY IT!!! It's awesome.
0553573403|5.0|This was a hell of a book. I've been a fantasy fan for about 26 years and I have a new favorite. What more can I say the best. If you haven't read it well, get off the net and buy it now!
B00004Z459|5.0|This cd hits people fast and hard and with a minimum of bad stuff.  The only bad track was Runaway, but that really isn't saying much.  One Step Closer was a radio hit and compelled many to buying this cd.  I bought it before I heard their songs, and then listened to the cd. I heard the song on the cd, and I just put the thing on repeat.  The next singles were just as good as the rest of the cd, but they fell victim to overplay and made people get sic of these guys when they are really a new trend for the genre of rock.  Despite the fact that there is a lot of rapping on the cd, it wasn't that big of a deal.  Why?  Because unlike people like Limp Bizkit, who sold out to be cool, these guys are doing their own thing and not posing.  Everyone thought these guys were just a Limp bizkit protege.  Every last member actually has talent, unlike Bizkit.  LP is going to leave those dorx in the dust and sweep the rock world within a year.
B000002UEB|5.0|I bought the CD of Mindcrime in 1991. In the 10 years since then, I continue to be amazed by the brilliance of this album. The band was obviously at their peak of songwriting when they did this work. All of the tracks are intricately tied together, yet at the same time, all come across differently in their textures and rhythms. Degarmo and Wilton's guitar work imbue a sense of power and mystery behind Geoff's incredibly great voice. Rockenfield's drumming is second to none. Who do you want to win, Nikki, or Dr. X?<br />This is the sound by which I continue to judge all progressive metals albums to date. I have found only few other records which even come close, such as Fates Warning's Parallels, or Megadeth's Youthanasia.
B00000JGEI|4.0|Robert Patrick's appearance as Duchovny's replacement on The X-Files reminded me of the  only other time i've seen him, as the evil robot in T2.  An actor without a speaking role is  difficult to assess, so there isn't much to be said about him here.<br />Schwarzenegger, on the other hand, has a tough job here in trying to match Linda Hamilton's  performance as the concerned mother.  She dominates this film, bringing feminist strengths to  a new intensity.  Her breakout from the hospital must have taken all the energy she possessed  and very nearly overrides the remaining scenes.  Certainly, her conniving tactics in  accomplishing it stick in memory far more than the remainder of the film.  The scene of her  struggle in the foundry seems a bit overblown, but was a necessary climatic build.  Cameron  may have overdone it a bit here, and it's impossible not to wonder how much of it is  Hamilton's own drive to show her toughness that prolonged it.<br />Arnold turns in a performance superior to most of what he'd done prior to this film.  His  change of character from the earlier Terminator is unquestionably genuine.  It's a forecast of  what he achieves in later films.  Having seen this film prior to watching the original  Terminator made the comparison even more stark.  Never having been a Schwarzenegger fan  before seeing this, it made a convert of me.<br />This isn't a film to see on a regular basis, but Cameron's abilities deserve more than one  watch.  Clearly, this film is designed for the Schwarzenegger buff.  If Cameron feels Arnold is  worth directing, we must all sit up and take notice.  For that alone, this film is worth adding  to your collection.
B00003CXMG|5.0|I remember when my movie theater manager held a screening for this film for us, the day before it's sneak preview.  I had seen the strange poster of the blond girl with the huge mirrored sunglasses in the lobby (heck, I had put it up), and then, I saw the film!  What can I say?  The critics were right: it deserved all the praise and critical acclaim it received!<br />  Patrick Fugit plays William Miller, a young boy living with his mother(Francis McDormand).  Listening to Rock and Roll, Young William soon begins to write review for an underground newspaper.  One day, his work catches the eye of Rolling Stone magazine, and he is sent to go along with the up-and-coming band &quot;Stillwater.&quot;  At the first concert he attends, Will meets several band-aids(young women who are there to support the certain band), including the mysterious Penny Lane(Kate Hudson).  Before he knows it, Will is whisked all over the country, and becomes close confidant to lead Stillwater player Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup).  <br />  The film plays well on several levels, and on it's humor.  At the beginning, Will is unsure how to go about his duties to report Stillwater's happenings, and his questions to Penny Lane create some incredible enigmas for us(what is her real name?).  Some of the best comical moments involve the constant call by Will's mom to make sure he's staying out of trouble and not doing drugs (my mom would have probably done the same thing), and one scene in Nebraska where Russell goes to a nearby party and gets wasted.<br />  Based loosely on an early life experience by Cameron Crowe, he takes us on this journey, and wew get to experience much of it from Will's point of view, rather than just viewing it like an outsider.  The story has many twists and turns, and probably not since &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; had I seen a piece reflect the period it was contained in so well.  It's movies like this that make me yearn for the era of retro-style (there was one lamp in the movie that my parents had in the late 70's).
B00000JGEO|5.0|Arnold Schwarzenegger simply refuses to take himself seriously.  Who else could have made  Twins or Junior after that string of muscle films?  Recently, he seems to approach film making  with an air of wry amusement.  And that's very good for us, because with True Lies, he's  achieved an almost unqualified success.  This film is a collector's item for repeated  enjoyment.<br />Combatting terrorists has taken a grip on the American psyche.  Big Arnie is a counter  espionage agent who acts as a &quot;software salesman&quot; to his family.  The dual role keeps him at  the sharp end some of the time, but concerned father and devoted husband the rest.  His wife  is a legal secretary and effective housewife, arranging for repairs, rearing their daughter and doing  the laundry.  It's a pretty dull existence on the surface.  She needs excitement, while her  husband is experiencing almost as much of that as he can handle.<br />As a James Bond character one moment and a middle class husband and father the next,  Schwarzenegger displays a capacity unexpressed in his early films.  His narrow escapes and  rapid role changes are carried with suave assurance unseen in his earlier work.  In this film  he's able to carry off a variety of identities without missing a beat.  Even when he reverts to  his earlier smash 'em and crash 'em scenes, he manages it with full recognition of the role.  It's  not mindless, meaningless violence, but with the full characterization of the supposedly  betrayed husband.<br />Tom Arnold, as his fellow agent and backup turns in a superb performance.  As the &quot;older  and wiser&quot; long-time sufferer of failed marriages and director of Schwarzenegger's  clandestine operations, he comes through with a fine display of wit.  He's a born humourist  and brings that talent to a fine pitch here.  The other major male character, Art Malik is simply  indescribable.  You'd never believe him to be a native of the UK, he comes across as fresh  from Iraq, Iran or out of Khaddafi's stable.  He's a consummate terrorist leader right to the  end.  Bill Paxton, a used car dealer posing as an agent to pick up women, outdoes anything  he's shown us before.  It must have been a tough role to play, given the handling he receives  from Schwarzenegger.  He's despicable, but carries that image through in good style.<br />Giving all the male actors in this film sufficient accolades isn't hard.  They all perform without  serious flaws.  This film, however, is picked up and walked away with by Jamie Lee Curtis.  Starting as a stodgy secretary-housewife, she moves into an almost romance with Paxton.  &quot;Rescued&quot; by Schwarzenegger's team, she moves into an entirely new role for her.  The hotel  scene with Big Arnie must have given the Hollywood censors some uncomfortable moments  in trying to rate this film.  It would be fascinating to know if Jamie's &quot;breakout&quot; from her  previously roles was really due to James Cameron or if she entered into the spirit of the thing  on her own hook.  It's certainly difficult to imagine Cameron sitting off to one side shouting  positions for Curtis to assume during the hotel scene.<br />The performances given in this film far outweigh the action sequences, stunning as they are.  We can get all we want of that watching the James Bond flicks without ever seeing this level  of characterizations.  This film cries out for a sequel, particularly given the closing scene.  Curtis, transformed by her exotic experiences following the revelation of what Big Arnie  actually does for a living are superb.  A good follow-up would be a perfect cap to what we  view in this, the best of many of the performers here.r out of Khaddafi's stable.  He's a consummate terrorist leader right to the  end.

6305265488|5.0|No guys need to read this other than to buy it for their sweethearts. This is one of the most romantic movies I have ever watched! A friend of mine recommended it to me so I went out and rented it over the weekend ~~ so glad I did!<br />Drew Barrymore can act ~~ with passion and beauty. She is the ordinary girl who got swept off her feet by the prince. And this is the stuff fairy tales are made of. Thank goodness for those kinds of movies!<br />You guys can stick with Die Hard and Lethal Weapons type movies. I'll take this one anytime! It's enough to remind you that romance is still alive and strong!
0671027344|5.0|I have now read this book twice in less than a year. I found it only by chance at the library and have since bought it. The story of Charlie a shy freshman is so real and amazing you will have to read it again and again. Everything he does or says you can relate to yourself or someone you know. This is High School! I am currently a senior and I could see myself in Charlie and the other characters in the book. I too over came being a &quot;wallflower&quot; you just have to get active and for those who can't do it alone, this book will help. For me it wasn't just Charlie that affected me but all of the characters. One of my favorites being Patrick, the gay senior that helps change Charlie's outlook on life. The topics in this novel range from growing up to gay bashing to abortions to dealing with death. This book is LIFE and I am a better person for having read it. I can't stress enough the power this book with have over you. You truly will look at life differently and if you don't then you didn't really read it. I think about this book a lot in normal everyday situations. You can learn so much from these characters. You can laugh with them and cry with them, and believe me you will do both. So stop reading these reviews and go get this BOOK! You won't regret it, I swear.
B00000DCHD|5.0|I enjoy every song on this CD. The 3 hits(Big Shot,Honesty,My Life) are great songs, but I like Rosalinda's Eyes and Zanzibar even better. Until the Night is a powerful ballad. The sax solo on Stiletto is awesome! Give this CD a try, you won't be able to take it out of the player.
B000058983|5.0|You MUST buy this!  If you don't know this album, now is a great time to get aquainted with it.  If you DO know it, well...you ain't heard it like this before!!  This new edition sounds fantastic!!  There's a much improved sense of depth and clarity on this reissue.  As for the bonus tracks, well, they're great!  Contrary to what's been said here, the track 'Wonder People (I Do Wonder)' is NOT the song 'I Still Wonder', which popped up on the 'Out Here' double LP.  It IS the song 'I Do Wonder', which showed up on Arthur Lee's early 80's Rhino solo LP.  It sounds GREAT here---given the full Forever Changes treatment!  Anyway, I won't say more---just buy this!  FREE ARTHUR LEE!
B00004ZAV3|4.0|This album definently lacks the cohesive structure that their previous albums had. It needs some kind of melody that threads together each song like their previous album &quot;her wall paper reverie&quot;.How could the Beatles even think of making another album without John Lennon!
0553282980|3.0|Hi there. Just to please my English-teacher :) : I've read the book at school/home. We also watched the movie, and in my opinion, the emotions of the characters and all the atmosphere of the story are better caught here. The music is a big advantage . If you just read the book you will fail to entirely understand the dramatic moments . You can't right imagine what the actors perform. It's more impressive to watch the movie!
0800141806|5.0|Save your money and buy the VHS (9.99). There are no extras here not even the Bruce Springsteen music video. How Come? Let's hope they do a reissue and add some extras and the Springsteen music video. This movie truly deserves so much better.
B00004XOWM|1.0|Man, what a bunch of crap.  My friend bugged me into buying it, claiming that all the crap I hear on the radio by them in no way represents what the rest of their cd's sound like.  Damn, do these guys suck.  Fred Durst has to be the biggest jag-off to ever exist.  Don't believe me?  Just listen to the song he made on the Strait-Up Lynn Strait tribute CD.  All he talks about is himself and Limp Bizkit.  Now onto this new pile of crap he's put out.  God, why don't his band members just kick him out?  The music may be halfway decent without Fred and his whiny woman's voice saying the &quot;F&quot; word every five minutes.  I recommend this cd to 13 year olds, TRL fans, and any other scum of the earth loser.  If you want real music, listen to PIG, KMFDM, and even for better rap-rock b.s. music Incubus.  They at least have talent, and a frontman that doesn't wear a red hat to hide the fact that he's bald
B000059Z8J|5.0|The moment you hear John Williams opening score, you'll be engrossed in this film.  Arguably, SUPERMAN is the greatest superhero movie ever made (and coincidentally the first movie I ever saw), and definitely one of the last epics to ever hit the silver screen.  Making people take Superman seriously is the hardest task anyone making a comic-related film has ever encountered.  However, director Richard Donner succeeded where eveyone else would've failed by taking the road less travelled, and focused on the mythos of the Last Son of Krypton, and all the empathic human emotions contained within.  Consequently, he set the standard by which all comic-related movies were to be judged for the next 23 years (and beyond)!<br />Few recognize, however, that the movie itself helped force the special effects genre into overdrive.  Before SUPERMAN, no one had attempted to truly integrate blue screen effects (even Lucas)with traditional prop special effects.  More importantly, they had never dared to do blue screen in daylight images (due to the black outline and unsteady color caused by the film of the time).  Most importantly, utilizing a person in these images meant movement, something space ships didn't offer up as a problem.  By the time SUPERMAN II came along, the challenges were even greater, including creating an entire city street to destroy!<br />From beginning to end, SUPERMAN is a legendary fantasy-epic, wherein the Man of Steel ultimately turns his back upon the knowledge of his ancestors in order to save the life of his love, Lois Lane, by turning back time.  Created in an age of art &amp; innocence, SUPERMAN ignores the depressing scientific jargon-babble of today's trekky movies, and refuses to drag you down with over-complicated premises.  Instead, it engages you in a fairy tale come to life (more fantasy than sci-fi).  Simply put:  SUPERMAN may very well be the most FUN movie of all time.
0375501851|1.0|I was very excited to get this book and read it after all the glowing reviews.  The first section was very good and I looked forward to the rest of the book. Unfortunately, it was downhill from there and I struggled to keep awake through the remainder.  I still don't get what happened at the end....probably because I skimmed through the last fifty pages.  I was so tired of the writing style it was giving me a headache.
B0000025ZF|4.0|To some degree this record reminds me both of riding the trains across Europe and of American highways; when on the highway, it has an incredible resonance. Despite the fact that the music is a letdown compared to that of Pink Floyd [aside from Clapton's incredible solos on tracks 5 and 10, and the magnificent Every Stranger's Eyes, which gives me the chills] the power of this album is strong, after the listener has absorbed it. Roger has opened his heart as much here as he did on the Wall.
B000058T5E|5.0|Jeff Beck back again? So soon? He usually retires for 5 years or longer between recording`s. His new cd is nothing short of fantastic. It`s even better than Who else? Earthquake sets you up for the power and thrills of what the rest of the album has to offer.Roy`s Toy, Dirty Mind, Nadia, Loose- Cannon,Rosebud...WOW! This is Jeff beck at his finest so far! Blackbird and Suspension allow you to clean what`s left of your scrambled brains off your walls and furniture...then you start all over again. Play it loud, play it often. I`m proud of this man, never afraid to take chances and the brains and talent to pull it off. If you get a chance to see Jeff Beck live, don`t pass it up! He`s a living legend!
B0000027I6|5.0|Pink Floyd, in Roger's absence, has hired a support band; so no surprising that Roger has hired a cast of characters from Jeff Beck and Rita Cooledge to sportscaster Marv Albert and WWI veteran Alf Razell. The theme of watching war as entertainment on TV is terrifying because it is dangerously real; and Roger, if anything, has become more thematically subtle and lyrically powerful. His guest stars give this the musical power of a Floyd album, and WITH the lyrical power that the band has lost without him. The only flaw is that on some songs, notably his Don Henley duet about the Tiannamen Square massacre, could have done with fewer words; but small complaints do not take away from this achievement.
B000002J09|5.0|Wow!  This album is the most complete album I've ever heard.  There are eight tracks on it and each track is different from the last, composing an album that can take you through a great range of feelings.  First there is &quot;Black Dog&quot;- this is classic Led Zeppelin tune that defines the word heavy metal.  Next, is &quot;Rock and Roll&quot;- this one harkens back to the early beginnings of rock'n'roll.  You can tell that Led Zeppelin was influenced by such greats as Chuck Berry and Howlin Wolf.  Then the next track strays from the first two into something different.  An acoustic track with Page on Mandolin.  &quot;The Battle of Evermore&quot; was inspired by Ancient Scottish wars in Medieval times.  This is a great song about war that is extremely powerful.  The lyrics to &quot;The Battle of Evermore&quot; prelude to Plant's incredible lyrical skill that is found on the next track-&quot;Stairway to Heaven.&quot;  I don't think I can say anything more about this track other than it is the most requested song of all time on radio.  Next, comes &quot;Misty Mountain Hop.&quot;  This is just a good departure for the band from the seriousness of the previous two tracks.  It is a fun song.  Then we have &quot;Four Sticks&quot; which is a very creative song with a cool guitar riff that dominates the song.  It is a jazzed up funky song that has a great vocal performance by Plant.  Then, probably the most beautiful song on the album next to Stairway is &quot;Going to California&quot;.  This is a song about the search for the perfect woman.  It has Jones on mandolin, who perfectly compliments Page's fingerpicking.  I heard it was inspired by Joni Mitchell.  Then the final track is &quot;When the Levee Breaks.&quot;  This is the song that is credited with more sampling of the drum beat created by Bonham than any other song.  It is also the most blues-inflected song on the album.  I remeber listening to this album when I was young in my Dad's convertible on long trips.  He made us listen to the album all the way through.  It is a complete album in every sense of the word.  It is awesome.  This album is probably one of the greatest rock'n'roll albums of all time.  Need I say more.

B000002KIE|5.0|This is the quintessential Voice of a Generation album like no other.   <br />Anyone dismissing this as rehash of music heard from the NY Punk scene in the early '70's reveal themselves as a bitter acedemic music history buff attempting to impress.  Stuff it up yer arse!  The Sex Pistols were a defining moment in music history and this album captures all their fury perfectly - don't let the bookworms and the cynics lead you wrong.  <br />Rent  &quot;The Filth and the Fury&quot; for an in depth examination of the Pistols and their music.
B000002IWQ|4.0|A real gem. Some bits good some bits not so good, but if you're a fan then it don't matter, YOU NEED THIS ALBUM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? BUY IT NOW!!!
B000002JB3|5.0|This is the second best Phil Collins album.  Phil has grown.  He has been through quite a range.  I find this album refreshing and incredibly insightful.  Lorenzo is my absolute favorite.  This song has so much to offer the fan, great percussions, moving lyrics and a great rythm!  He does a great job.  KUDOS to you Phil... hope there's another to come soon
B000002J1O|5.0|Yes this is a great genesis album. Peter gabriel at his most theatrical! There really is no prog rock band at this time to compare. the music is full of story telling and wonder. The music and lyrics really come together on this one with phil collins doing his first solo vocal with the band!!!! (More Fool Me). This is the album that old genesis fans get misty eyed over!!! BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!
0393312836|5.0|This book was beutifully written, and not in a flowery or traditional way.  It was angry, it ws brutally honest, it was somehow endearingly disturbing.  The author makes you think, reason, listen and question. I am so glad that I was able to get the edition with the last chapter not previously published in the US- but a word of advice: either get the book with a glossary or download the vocabulary from the internet because it makes the book that much more enjoyable.  Although at first, the dialog is a bit puzzling- if you look up a few key words you are able to easily follow it and somehow get caught up in the author's speak.   A malenky bit of beuty my friends!
B000002IOW|4.0|Rush have always been known more for technical flash than for straight-ahead rock, but Presto achieves a synthesis of the two that's accessible without compromising. It's strong lyrically, without the heavy-handed symbolism and the band often gets into a rhythmic groove that's positively infectious; check out \\"Scars\\" or \\"Superconductor.\\" Presto is also the first Rush album where the incorporation of electronics and synthesizers truly works, instead of sounding like an additional layer artificially added to existing music. This album marked something of a creative rebirth. Enjoy
0345440757|5.0|I have read just about every book out there on the subject of babies...and this book is the best one yet.  It offers very sensitive yet practical advice that is easy to follow, and also includes some great material that no other books seem to have:  for example, there are charts to help you interpret baby's facial expressions, cries, etc.  There is also an excellent chapter on feeding your baby, and the battle of formula versus breastfeeding.  For any moms out there who are torn on this subject, this can help clear it up without guilt or unnecessary bias toward one method or the other.  From now on, all my newly pregnant friends will no longer be getting the &quot;What to Expect&quot; books from me...they'll receive this one instead!!!
B000002J1L|4.0|England, England, England. Yes, this album just oozes Englishness!!!!! If you are used to later slick Genesis productions then this may be hard work to listen to. It really is a mix of themes and musical styles but an essential purchase if you are a Genesis fan.
0380730405|4.0|I'm not sure if my book is missing pages, but the ending didn't seem too complete. The begginning didn't seem to match up with the end.  (could anyone whose read this book send me an email? ashleythewriter@hotmail.com) otherwise, this book is wonderful. The nameless  narrator narrates in such a way that you are shocked, appalled, distressed, happy when she is. It's like you are her, going through the many ups and downs of life at Manderley.(and there are alot). One flaw, I sometimes wondered why the characters did some things. Maxim seemed to have no feelings one day, and tons the next day(referring to narrator). anyway, read this book.
B000001ESN|5.0|One of Rush's finest moments, second only to Moving Pictures. This album includes two classic songs, \\"The Spirit of Radio\\" (which has one of the most recognizable guitar riffs in all of rock) and \\"Freewill.\\" There's also the epic-feeling \\"Jacob's Ladder,\\" as well as \\"Entre Nous,\\" a sort of intellectual love song (if such a thing can be said to exist). The introspective \\"Different Strings\\" and the anthemic \\"Natural Science\\" (which clocks in at over nine minutes) close the album. Though there are only six songs on Permanent Waves, it's enough; the material is rich enough that more of it would be like overdosing on chocolate
0446525537|4.0|I just finished reading this book as I am looking out a picture window with a beautiful view of a lake. Perfect. I felt like I was back in time and part of a story that I didn't want to end. I would love to see this made into a movie. Can't wait to read the rest of Nicholas Sparks' books.
B000002J1M|4.0|the first track, &quot;Watcher of the skies&quot; does sound a bit pompous these days but the rest of the album is a real treat. Can utility and the Coastliners is a real gem (what the ..... does that mean?). Supper's ready is a genesis classic and all that is progressive rock. Weird English self indulgent, electronic meanderings.........Get the picture?
B000055ZB8|5.0|If Todd Browning's &quot;Dracula&quot; is about the sound of Bela Lugosi's accented voice saying &quot;Good Evening,&quot; then F. W. Murnau's &quot;Nosferatu&quot; is about the sights of Max Schreck's grostesque figure rising up out of his coffin.  The fact that this is a silent film actually adds to the atmospheric tension; think of the moment when the death ship slips into the port of Bremen, carrying its cargo of death.  The story is clearly Bram Stoker's &quot;Dracula&quot; (although the names have been changed to pretend otherwise and avoid paying the author's estate), and this 1922 film is actually more faithful than most versions of the novel, which almost invariably avoid the actual conclusion to the tale.  Murnau's version ends with vampire's downfall being caused by a sacrifice based on the love of Ellen Hutter (Greta Schroder, the &quot;Mina&quot; character) for Thomas (Gustav von Wangenehim as the &quot;Jonathan Harker&quot; character).  Even though Schreck's &quot;Count Orlok&quot; is clearly an example of German Expressionism with his gaunt countenance and immensely long talons he stalks his prey through a decidedly realistic 19th-century world, which also somehow magically adds to the film's effectiveness.  Similarly, the &quot;special effects&quot; are nothing more than such rudimentary tricks as stop motion and double exposure, but none the less potent for their simplicity.  Perhaps the greatest testament to this film is that directors who have filmed the Dracula story since &quot;Nosferatu&quot; have included homages to Murnau's masterpiece, from Browning (the actor playing the count is also the coachman) to Coppola (the count's terrifying shadow cast large on the wall).  When released in 1922 this film was also known as &quot;Nosferatu the Vampire,&quot; &quot;Nosferatu, a Symphony of Horror,&quot; &quot;Nosferatu, a Symphony of Terror,&quot; and even &quot;Terror of Dracula.&quot;  The 1998 reissue title in the United States was &quot;Nosferatu: The First Vampire.&quot;The First Vampire.&quot;
B000002J2F|5.0|A mix of pop and prog. This is the album that Phil gets his first real song writing teeth into. It is a real mix but very interesting. genesis alays suprise. There are songs on here for all types. The Instrumental &quot;Dukes travels&quot; is worth the purchase alone if you are a hardened prog rock fan. This instrumental just comes out of nowhere and really shows what Tony Banks is capable of (with the help of David henscthel). THIS IS THE GENESIS THAT MOST PEOPLE REMEMBER.
B0000524E5|4.0|Producer Jerry Bruckheimer seems to have an innate sense of what makes money in cinema.  He seldom makes a film that isn't profitable and has numerous blockbusters on his resume over the past 30 years (American Gigolo, Flashdance, Beverly Hills Cop, Top Gun, The Rock, Con Air, Armageddon).  Bruckheimer is a populist producer.  He is more concerned with giving audiences what they want than he is about producing films of any artistic value or substance.  In that regard, \\"Coyote Ugly\\" fits right in.<br />This film is energetic, entertaining, scintillating and fun to watch.  The story is &quot;Flashdance&quot; lite, and is reminiscent of the popular but vacuous \\"Cocktail\\" with Tom Cruise, only with a decent plot woven in.  Violet Sanford (Piper Perabo) is a young aspiring songwriter who leaves South Amboy, New Jersey traveling to New York City to be discovered.  When things don't go as planned, she takes a job as a bartender in a raucous singles bar where the sexy female bartenders dance provocatively on the bar to the shrieks of the rowdy patrons below.  Of course, there is a love story to go along with the quest for fame, completing the populist formula.<br />Bruckheimer defies the conventional Hollywood big budget approach by using an ensemble cast of veritable unknowns and a first time director.  Other than John Goodman in a minor role, and supermodel Tyra Banks who hasn't done much acting, most of the actors have extremely short resumes.  This gives the film a freshness and energy that comes from the cast's exhilaration at just being on the set.<br />Piper Perabo is an incredible find.  She is not simply acting in this film, but living the role.  Just like her character Violet, this film is her big break so her ability to understand the character and the role is implicit (another stroke of Bruckheimer genius).  Perabo is an excellent actor with tremendous ability and potential.  It is likely that this film will be the launch pad for a bright career.  Maria Bello also gives a fabulous performance as Lil, the tough and successful owner of the nightclub.  Australian actor Adam Garcia has great chemistry with Perabo as Violet's love interest.  His pleasant demeanor and good looks have many people comparing him with Mel Gibson, although it remains to be seen whether he can handle roles that are more substantial.  John Goodman provides one of the film's best moments when he gets up on the bar and dances as Violet auctions him off to the screaming women in the crowd.<br />The DVD is packed with interesting special features about the making of the film.  It also includes a DTS audio option, which I like better than Dolby Digital 5.1.  The soundtrack is pulsating and explosive and pumps the film up with excitement.<br />This is not great filmmaking, but it is great entertainment.  It is an amiable film that sparkles with energy and is easy to watch.  I rated it a 7/10.  Many people were surprised by how much they enjoyed it, but I'm never surprised when I like a Jerry Bruckheimer film.  He knows how to push our buttons.
B000001ESP|5.0|The new era of Rush music. This album is a big favourite with fans and contains a healthy dose of synthesizers. I know fans are divided on the synth issue but I really feel on Moving Pictures the mix is spot on. Rush have always experimented with sound but have maintained contemporary musical sensitivities to produce music that challenges the listener. This album is a classic and well worth a purchase!
0670824399|5.0|Classics like MATILDA are not simply an extraordinary work. They are what are called a 'legend.' MATILDA, by one of the best selling children's authors of all time, Roald Dahl, tells the fantastic, dangerously hilarious story of a young genius girl named Matilda. Living in a society and a family full of stupidity and selfishness, she adapts to her surroundings with her prodigal skills. Attached to her library, she reads out the entire children's as well as adults' section, and finds herself reading almanacs and dictionaries at the age of five. It's only until one incident angers her that she discovers in herself a fantastic gift -- using this uncalled for gift, she lets out her powers on her cruel parents and snobby brother. She soon enters school, that way her thief parents don't have to worry about the 'spoiled brat' anymore. (Her parents never bought her a thing in her life, don't know her age, and sometimes forgets she's even there. They're also unaware of the fact that she could spell her name at two.) There, she enters the only world that she could ever love -- the world of children. And the world of her sweet, loving teacher, Ms. Honey. And it is there that she sees an evil in her school -- the Trunchbull, her rather cannaballistic principal. From the laughable memories of Bruce Bogtrotter to the tale of the Trunchbull's past to the magical, hilarious, and wonderful last page, MATILDA makes itself my favorite novel of all time.<br />Showing you that a child can be so strong, showing you that a little girl could be so heroic and talented , is a masterful work to compile. Written with Dahl's loving style, it is among the best of children's novels of all time. Leveling and even surpassing Lois Sachar's HOLES and Philip Pullman's HIS DARK MATERIALS trilogy, Matilda is the most loving novel I have ever read and will continue to be. It is good to know that no book will ever beat this classic, no matter how fantastic<br />the book will be. Matilda is legendary. Andif the rating system would go up to 10 stars, it would still be unratable. This is not overhype; this is perfectly true. It's absolutely unforgettable, the flagship of all children's books.
B00001NFCY|5.0|This CD is awsome! My cousin had it and when he played it I fell in love with Creed.I reccomend this cd to anyone.
B0000025OP|4.0|I don't understand at all when people diss this album.  I love it.  In fact, I've bought it twice, since my first copy got old and scratched.  &quot;Hazel&quot; is one of my favorite songs on the disc, because, call me sentimental, it is such a great love song.  And with the classic &quot;Forever Young,&quot; which I take as a strong portrait of a father's love for his son, how can this not be acknowledged as an important album?  This album just transports me.  I guess it's best for Dylan fans, but the man is a true poet, so anybody that wants a mellow but solid rock n' roll album should appreciate this one.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Ba-doo-da-doo..(tick-tick)....ba-doo-da-doo..(tick-tick)... Those first 10 seconds of the CD, the harsh, angry, beaten piano introduction of &quot;On the Bound&quot; was about all I needed to hear to decide what I thought of WHEN THE PAWN.  It's fantastic.  Fiona's voice has some unique quality to it--tired yet pretty (and dark, too, oh my how dark).  And the musical interludes are splendid.  In fact, I think I'd rather listen to it than talk about it.  Goodbye.
B00000J7JO|5.0|I was completely blown away by this album. Before this album, I hadn't even heard of RHCP. I fell in love with the singles and I knew I had to by the album. I hate to use a cliche, but this album relly does have everything. THe thumping bass and Anthony Keidis's zesty lyrics hit you from &quot;Around the world&quot; to &quot;Road Trippin.'&quot; The writing on this album is unbeleivable. Unlike the world of pop that's taking over our radio stations, the bass is a driving force in all of RHCP's music. Anthony's smoky voice is perfect for the wild harmonies between the bass and guitar. It creates an unbelievable type of rock that blends a thrashing edge and a unique style of harmonizing with lyrics that are never subtle. Three thumbs up, buy it today, you'll never be sorry.
B000002N2Z|5.0|With this CD the Deftones really tore out of the underwall of metal.  It is really a shame that so much crap is dragging real metal down now(Limp Bizkit, Kid Rock...).  The first song Bored has an ironic title as I could never get tired of the song.  The first song I heard off this CD was 7words, and it blew me away.  The only other Deftones songs I had ever heard before were(though I did not know it at the time) My Own Summer(Shove It), and the far weaker, and equally enjoyable Change(In the House Of Flies).  This song sounded revolutionary to me, even though I have been listening to metal for a while now.  Having heard this song I craved to hear the rest of the CD.  And while others may have said this already, the title says all you need to know about this CD.  It is pure &quot;Adrenaline&quot;.  It definetally has the most power, and best lyrics of all the sweet Deftones CD's.  Every song is a winner, and the hidden track closes the disc on a very nice, melodic note.  The meaning of the CD is not noticeable by me, but there must be one here.  When the Deftones wrote this disc they must have jabbed themselves with a million epi-pens, as it is so powerful, and strong.  On a sadder note I went to see them in Ottawa, and the show was cancelled because Chino had a throat problem.  Maybe if he quit smoking it would not be a problem for him.
B0000024RQ|5.0|All of these songs are excellent and can stand next to anything Dylan has ever done, but I won't write this review about the cd; everyone knows its quality.  I'll write this about where to start with Bob Dylan, the most important and diffucult musical artist since who knows when.  And did I mention best?  This may be the place to start with Dylan.  It covers a huge variety of moods and is faultless.  It's user friendly with simple anthems like &quot;Blowin in the Wind&quot; and simply beautiful songs like &quot;Girl From North Country&quot;.  And those are just the first two songs!  If this is your introduction to Dylan just be prepared: THIS IS FOLK!  It's self-conciously in the tradition of great folkies but you don't have to know anything special about it.  I bought it without any knowledge of folk and was completely charmed by it.  If you don't get it at first, please keep listening!  It's something anybody can like, like the Beatles.  Later albums like Highway 61 Revisited (his best) are very, very diffucult, but this is pretty universal stuff.  It's just the starkness of the folk arrangements that can get to people.  If you really must be a rocker, download &quot;Positively 4th Street&quot; or &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; first (from Napster, of course) and then buy this CD.<br />But the biggest advantage of buying this album first of Dylan's oeuvre is it's placement in his career.  If you are taken by it, you can just go through his career album by album!  All the 60s stuff is great and they come right after this album.  Just be warned that &quot;The Times They are A-Changing&quot; is pretty subpar by Dylan standards (but still enjoyable and thought-provoking).  And so, if you have any interest in music and/or poetry at all (but you don't have to like poetry!) buy this CD!
B00004RFFU|5.0|When this movie opened on the big screen, I did not go to see it because I thought it was going to be a &quot;spoof&quot; about vampires.  However, when I saw the video, my assumption couldn't have been further from the truth.  I found myself enthralled with the tormented Louis (Brad Pitt), the flamboyant Lestat (Tom Cruise), and the exquisite child Claudia (Kirsten Dunst).  This is a very passionate, expressive, and vivid adaptation of Anne Rice's novel.  Tom Cruise brings the character Lestat to life with all the bells and whistles (he went for it) and is one of his finest hours on the sliver screen.  It seems the vampire Louis was written for Brad Pitt - need I say more.  The child vampire, Claudia, was played brilliantly by Kirsten Dunst, and she looked the role all too perfectly.  I found myself caught up in the macabre atmosphere and genre of New Orleans and the 18th Century.  This movie takes the classic vampire as we know him, and shows a different side where human emotions, vulnerability and the need for companionship meet.  Underlying it all is the &quot;thirst&quot; (no pun intended) for knowledge about the origins of the &quot;dark gift&quot;, the fear of abandonment, and future survival.  It takes the fears that we go through as humans and fuses them with these vampires.  For those of you who like the mysterious and eerie, this is a must to see.  I fell in love with it and have watched it many times over.  I love Anne Rice's book, but adore the movie.
B00001NFCY|3.0|I like Creed. They're not my favorite band, but a lot of their music is still pretty enjoyable to listen to. My main complaint is that they imitate earlier '90s alternative bands too much. When listening to them, I often confuse Scott Stapp's exaggerated deep vocals for Eddie Vedder's of Pearl Jam. On this album, elements of early grunge bands are apparent, especially on &quot;What If?&quot;, which sounds distinctly like something from the Stone Temple Pilots. Creed's hard rock is pretty strong, but seems to fall just short of great. But Creed is still a relatively young band, and they will probably grow and become more distinctive as they mature.
B00004XQ83|5.0|Thought i just had to add my input to this here review. I defy anybody to find me a better soundtrack than this. What else is there to say? The album has a story of its own, a language, a poetry. It is - in short - a work of excruciatingly beautiful art. There isn't a single moment of weakness anywhere. Finally, i have had the album in my posession for two days and have been listening to it constantly. I would swear i heard it sung by the characters in my dreams last night and it carried over well past breakfast. In fact i am listening to it right now.
B00004T8RK|4.0|Pearl Jam fans may be somewhat disappointed upon their first to Binaural. True enough, it's not as good as earlier albums like Ten or Vs. Nor is it an easy listen. But after a couple times, the album's strengths begin to become apparent. The opening song, &quot;Breakerfall&quot;, is strong, if slightly bland for Pearl Jam. &quot;Light Years&quot; is an excellent song and the best on the album; &quot;Thin Air&quot; and the haunting &quot;Rival&quot; are also standout tracks, and &quot;Nothing As it Seems&quot; has a distinctly Pink Floyd sound to it. Though Pearl Jam seems to be wearing out a little after 10 years of musical greatness, and Eddie Vedder's voice seems to be getting sort of tired, Binaural is still a good album that just takes some time in getting to like.
0679879269|5.0|Lyra is a girl from a world not too different from our own.  One of the only main differences between her world and ours is that in her world everyone's soul lives outside of them in the shape of an animal.  It is called a Daemon.  Mrs. Coulter, who is Lyra's mother, and Lord Asriel, who is Lyra's father, are also from that world.  Mrs. Coulter is keeping Lyra sleeping with a potion.  Meanwhile, Will, a boy from our world, is searching for Lyra.  Two angels are looking for him because they know that the knife that he carries can cut between any two worlds, and that if they bring that knife to Lord Asriel, the leader of the rebellion against the church, he will acknowledge them even though they are low ranking angels, because the knife is needed to win the war.<br />Dust is the glimmer from angels from all of the worlds that is slowly disappearing.  The church is trying to destroy Dust, and the rebellion is trying to save it.  Will refuses to go to Lyra's father before finding her, so one of the angels goes to Lord Asriel to tell him what has happened and the other one stays to protect Will while he is looking for Lyra.<br />The most interesting aspect of Lyra is that she can create stories on the spot, and she captures everyone's attention.  When she starts to tell a story at the end of the book, the whole room crowded close to her, even the ones who knew that the story was utter nonsense.<br />Anyone who enjoys magical fantisies will love it.  It is wonderfully detailed, and the author keeps you interested from the first word of the trilogy to the last.  The characters are beautifully portrayed and creatively three-dimensional which gives the story an exciting twist.
B000000WA4|5.0|After buying and listening to this album several times, I was disappointed...not in the album, but in the belief that every other album I bought after would pale in comparison. This 2-disc epic is so grand, so vast in scope, and so moving that it is, by no means, a typical rock album. Combining hard alternative rock with classical strings, techno-new wave, industrial metal, psychedelic rock, and even some groovy, jazzy elements, the Pumpkins touch on all sorts of musical styles over the course of this mammoth masterpeice. The soft, dreamy piano piece that opens the album and the swirling grandure of &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot; that follows are immediately indicative of the brilliant contrasts that highlight this album, as much of the Pumpkins other work. This album is to alternative rock what the Mona Lisa was to art, and no alterna-rock fan should go without it.
B000002VMH|3.0|I can't imagine what Daniel Durchholz had for supper when he wrote his review of Diva; it is, in my opinion, and remains, one of the most beautifully haunting efforts by a female artist yet.  Not only did Annie manage to fly well away from the synthetic pop of the Eurythmics; she clearly established herself of a voice of substance, emotion and great range.  I loved this CD the day I bought it; I love it more today.
B000002UAF|4.0|A Hard Day's Night is the beginning of the change over for the Beatles, from the fun, pop band to the stunning force of nature they became. Hard rockers like the title track and &quot;Any Time At All&quot; are balanced with beautiful ballads like &quot;If I Fell&quot; and &quot;And I Love Her.&quot; While there are a couple of songs that could be considered filler, &quot;Beatle filler&quot; is better than top quality material from many bands and there really is no song here that isn't a pleasure to listen to on some level.Enjoy.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I bought this collection on vinyl from Acoustic Sounds.  It was manufactured in England on 2 Lps with a poster and four pictures by Richard Avedon.  The sound quality is supberb!  The vocals sound live, the cymbals sound clear, the guitars sound like guitars and The Beatles have never sounded better.  Compact disc sounds thin and can never replace the sound of vinyl.  I have been replacing my CD collection with new 180GM vinyl Lps and the difference in sound brings the music back.  I will never buy another compact disc again.  This collection is all the radio songs by The Beatles.  I recommend buying The Beatles albums on vinyl and get the entire Beatles catalog on vinyl.  Compact disc may be convenient but the sound is poor next to vinyl and CD artwork is awful compared to LP artwork.  Buy this set on vinyl.
B000002NJS|5.0|I have followed Madonna's musical career from the beginning and have to admit that I was not much of a &quot;MADONNA FAN&quot; until August 1998.  In August 1998, I saw a Madonna biography on TV that included musical videos and excerpts from the &quot;Ray of Light&quot; CD. WOW!! I witessed a transformation in persona and music that I have never seen in my entire life.  I ventured out an bought &quot;Ray of Light&quot; and it has been in my CD changer since that day.  The song lyrics expressed to me a spiritual and mental maturity in Madonna that was obviously brought about through the pregnancy and birth of her daughter, Lourdes.  All one has to do is listen to the lyrics to discover the personal transformation.  Although all of the songs on the CD are powerful and impacting, my personal favorites are &quot;Swim&quot;, &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, &quot;Skin&quot; and &quot;Sky Fits Heaven&quot;. &quot;Child fits Mother so hold your baby tight, that's what my future could see...I think I'll follow my heart.....&quot;
6303160344|5.0|This was the first role I ever saw Juliette Binoche in although she had previously starred in many diverse roles and is a big star in France. It was breathtaking. The film focuses on trying to live with the grief she feels after her husband and daughter die in a car accident. She gets rid of their house and moves to a new apartment trying to move on with her life. She befriends a woman in the apartment building (who happens to be a woman that the rest of the residents want to evict). The film moves somewhat slowly but never too slowly. The course of the film is perfect to convey Binoche's grief and angst and her eventual coming to terms with the realities of her life before and after her family's death. She discovers that her husband was having an affair with another woman... a woman with whom he was in love. A woman whom Binoche comes to meet and discover is pregnant with a child. Binoche finally gives the home she and the husband had shared to this woman so the child can grow up in its father's home. Binoche also experiences a reawakening of love... and finishes the last work her composer husband left behind. A beautiful film with some of the most superior acting. (Also check out the gorgeous soundtracks to all three films in this Kieslowski trilogy).
B0000000LI|5.0|The title says everything. This cd is excelently played, the bassist has an outstanding slapping (one of the best i've ever seen) and makes some solos, the violinist its very good and the other instruments are very in place and very well organized. The music is good but not so good as the instrumentation, so if you are a instr. player (especially a bassist or violinist) you'll benefit very much from this cd.
B00004RFFU|3.0|Everyone knows that no one wanted Tom Cruise to play the lead of the vampire Lestat in this film. Everyone just knew he was too much of a lightweight pretty boy to pull it off. Writer Anne Rice was livid with this casting choice. However, Cruise surprised everyone when he pulled off a stunning and sexy performance. Anne Rice herself was said to be surprised and even more than that, delighted. Cruise's outstanding performance coupled with the performances of Brad Pitt, Christian Slater, Antonio Banderas and Kirsten Dunst, then just a child, precocious as she was, made this film good. And on top of this the scenery was lavish and moody just as you would expect. I am not a fan of vampire stories nor of Anne Rice, nor particularly of Tom Cruise of Brad Pitt, but I will say that this film was surprising in every way.
B00004Z459|5.0|screw pod, limp B, and Papa Roach.  those people are trying to hard for lyrics.  they don't have the gift these people have.  Linken Park seriously will take your breath away.  and i totally agree with the comments about the no use of cuss words.  i didn't realize that i guess.  and it's true.  don't think you'll get your point across if you're going to swear the whole freakin song.  there are way too many bands out there doing that.  but linken park has it all.  great songs from beginning to end.  limp, pod, and all those other people have like maybe one or two.  right.....and these people are unique!  I never really liked/respected the whole rap/rock thing till i heard linken park.  it's amazing and i totally recommend buying this cd.  it is worth the dough.
0788811355|5.0|The English Patient is one of my favourite films of all time. The cast is brilliant, the scenery and cinematography throughout are unsurpassed, the story is a love story without being too emotionally taxing or juvenile, and the soundtrack is perfectly haunting. I knew from the first moment the film began that I would love it. The soundtrack is mostly made up of Hungarian folk music from the renowned Hungarian group Muzsiks. Music I had been listening to and loving for years was finally making its way into the public eye (and ear). The story, like the book, is told in a non-linear fashion. Slowly the identity of the English patient begins to unravel, as he (a brilliant and restrained Ralph Fiennes) reminisces of his life before his plane accident. The storyline of the past, including Fiennes' love affair with his colleague's wife (Kristin Scott Thomas at her best), includes some beautiful scenery of the desert where Fiennes and his colleagues are mapmakers whose work is delayed by the onset of World War II. Colin Firth is excellent as the doting and eventually murderously jealous husband of Kathryn (Scott Thomas). In the present day, the tragedies that continually befall Juliette Binoche's character, Hana, come center stage. She has lost her fiance and her best friend in the war, and now she is taking care of Fiennes's character who will eventually die. She falls in love with a Sikh bomb expert who comes to stay in the abandoned Italian convent where she is temporarily staying to take care of Fiennes. The story is quite complex and worth every moment of unraveling the complexity.
B000050X31|5.0|Of course, this made-for-VHS production (which possibly aired on PBS at one point) does not have the video quality of some films on DVD, but it is quite crisp and vibrant, and has the special touches (wonderful costumes/props/sets) of a Met production.  The Met touch is especially nice for Zauberflote, as it frequently receives a &quot;minimalist&quot; staging.  Manfred Hemm is excellent as Papageno and Kurt Moll is an incredible -- if slightly unconfident in the lower register at times -- Sarastro.  This is an opera that even people who hate opera will love.  Spoken dialogue is included, so the plot is intelligible (especially with German, French, Chinese and English subtitles).  The performance rivals the best I've heard, and you are not liable to find a better DVD edition.
B0000203YT|4.0|This film is brilliant and entertaining and its cast is inspired. However, I refrain from giving it a full five stars because as brilliant as it was, it just was not quite as brilliant as everyone said it was. Gwyneth Paltrow was lovely and charming, but she was not quite as luminous as everyone gushed (in my opinion). The story of Shakespeare fighting writer's block and looking for a muse and falling in love with Viola de Lesseps was an inspired storyline. The cast, from Geoffrey Rush to Rupert Everett as Shakespeare's rival Christopher Marlowe to Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth, is excellent all around. Joseph Fiennes is the truly luminous performer here, showing Shakespeare as a man of passion and inspiration but all too human nevertheless. The love story is actually feasible and beautiful and tragically illuminates the way toward Shakespeare completing his tragedy Romeo and Juliet. The film is resoundingly beautiful.
B00004T9UF|5.0|The Marshal Mathers LP is perhaps the best rap album of 2000.  For that, it does deserve a Grammy(and got one).  Many people disagree though. I will admit to the fact that the moral message on this album is nothing to be proud of, and is something I would want no child or angry person to be listening to.  But if you put that aside for a second and listen to the album ..., you'll find that Eminem's lyrical skill is top-notch.  There were times where I would often marvel at the genious of his lyrics.  The song &quot;Criminal&quot;, which might possibly convay the worst message on the album (besides that of &quot;Kim&quot;), is in my opinion, one of the best lyrical performances I've heard since the days of 36 Chambers and the Wu-Tang Clan.  And when you wrap all this up, you end up with an album good on content, but bad on morals.  I can't deciede between the two for you, but I personally, don't mind Eminem (although I am a bit sick of him).  I recommend the album.h any of it.  And as for the  links to teenage violence, Columbine and all that other s**t, well we have  the government, society, and the media to blame for that.  Not just one guy  from Detroit.<br />Musically you can't call it a masterpiece, because in the  genre that Eminem exists - Hip Hop - It's not. <br />But then it isn't in the  same bracket as Vanilla Ice and his unremarkable crap either.<br />It's an  album that has some funny, disturbing, thought provoking, sincere and  insincere and genuinely upsetting lyrics.  And it has some good solid beats  that you can listen too quite easily.<br />It's a lot darker than the Slim  Shady Lp, which in heinsight was a comedy album.   But then what were you  expecting?.  If you tell someone over and over again that they are  something bad,  they're going to begin to believe it themselves.<br />Eminem  does what he does because thats how he feels, and if you want a reason why  he feels that way - take a look at the abuse thats been thrown in his  direction and you find the cause and effect.  <br />I genuinely wanted to  write a review that concerned music, not morals, maybe I can when this has  died down... but it seems that at the moment someone needs to speak some  sense.<br />And do you know what? At the end of the day it really isn't any  worse than whats going on in your parent's bedrooms.
6304078102|3.0|The film runs too long and is a bit overdramatic, but the excellent performances of Richard Dreyfuss and  Glenne Headly save the picture from being completely dismal. It tells the tale of a man whose dream is to be a musician, but the dream is constantly set aside by other considerations. First he takes a position as a music teacher just so he and his wife can get on their feet. Then she becomes pregnant. Before you know it (well, actually you will know it. You will be looking at your watch to find out how much time has elapsed. The story and its vignettes are not that gripping that you will lose track of the hours) this man's entire life has passed and he never leaves the small town where he teaches. His career has been as a music teacher not as a musician, but in a sappy but happy ending some of his former students come back to thank him as he is retiring. They convince him that his students and the success stories of his teaching ARE his symphony. In tribute to him they play his work. An interesting part of the story is that his son is born deaf, which is the greatest sadness and irony for Mr. Holland because of his own intense love for music. He had expected to share it with his son. He has incredibly difficult relations with his son for years because he refuses to learn sign language to communicate with his son and feels that his son cannot relate to him at all. Eventually their relationship is restored, but it was an interesting angle to examine these family problems.
0451196716|5.0|At the beginning of this book Ray Garaty is entering the annual Long Walk. The Long Walk is when 100 teenagers get together and have to keep walking at 4 miles an hour. If they drop under this for 30 seconds they get a Warning and if they get 3 Warnings they get their ticket, DEATH! In the middle of the story he talks to his new friends that will only stay with him for a while, and gets to know them very well.  They get unlimited amount of water, however, they have a limit of food until 9A.M. the next day. In the end they are so exhausted that they have to force themselves to eat. Most of the people go crazt and get themselves killed. Finally at the end Stebbins dies of exhuastion and Garraty wins the Prize. The Prize is what ever he wants.

6302250269|4.0|Over here in Iceland where I live they are showing this movie on tv and somehow the tv station put together a summary on the film which states that Susan Sarandon and Gwyneth Paltrow star in this film together!! What a marvel. Who knew? Luckily a friend of mine has control over one tv guide that goes out to all parts of Iceland, so hopefully people will rely on his accurate account of the film which would state that this is the film, starring Sarandon and GEENA DAVIS, that launched Brad Pitt into stardom. This is the film that inspired many women to action, renewed friendships and made some women feel powerful. Although most women probably did not end their lives the way Thelma and Louise do in this film, women everywhere gathered some sense of togetherness from this film when two friends go on the run as events and circumstances around them escalate. Soon they are running from the law and feel that they have no alternatives although the detective on the case, played by Harvey Keitel, seems sympathetic and sincere in his desire to bring the twosome back peacefully. The film is witty, full of surprising events, and you will enjoy it although the end might not be the happiest one in film history.
0684853523|3.0|As an avid King reader, I had to read this book, whether or not I was interested in how to write well (and I am - though you can't tell from this sentence!).  The book is part memoir, part random 'on writing' gems.  Actually, 'random' probably best describes the format and content of On Writing.  Admittedly, King was attempting to avoid a detailed 'do this, do that, this is the way it must be done' summary - I'm glad he did.  His points on writing were easy to remember (mostly because they were repeated several times) and easy for anybody to put into practice.  Read alot and write alot, says King - sound advice.  My gripe with this book, although small, was that his editor allowed too many repetitions of the same information, mostly in the writing tips and also his near fatal accident.  It made the book seem less polished.
6301966988|2.0|For the longest time all I could remember about this film was that the villain's name was Willie Lopez. I had a dog named Lopez, so it was hard not to associate the two. I also remember that my French teacher in high school for some reason loved Ghost (although he called it The Ghost) and announced one day that we would all watch Ghost and all benefit and learn from it because it was such a fabulous and otherworldly film. I, for one, laughed throughout. Parts that were supposed to be romantic, loving, touching, or otherwise emotional were so contrived that it was not credible. Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze are two of the worst actors in modern cinema. Swayze particularly lacks the depth and talent necessary to convey the kind of love he supposedly feels and definitely lacks the depth to convey the level of frustration he feels when he is dead but has unfinished business to take care of. Tony Goldwyn and Whoopi Goldberg are the two best things about the movie. Goldwyn as the ultimate villain, Carl, who orchestrated Swayze's murder and tries then to seduce Moore. Goldberg won an Oscar for her portrayal of a psychic who never actually believed she had psychic powers until Swayze's ghost came along and convinced her to help him catch and punish Carl and save Molly (Demi Moore). People who like really sappy love stories and far fetched tales will appreciate this film. In fact many people like it. It is a crowd pleaser, but it was too idiosyncratic for me.
B00000I952|4.0|ABBA is legendary for their extremely catchy, albeit goofy, pop songs.  This album ranks as one of their silliest and finest collections!  Who can resist the unnervingly catchy &quot;Two For the Price of One&quot; or &quot;One of Us&quot;?  A person with no pulse, that's who.  Benny and Bjorn's songwriting reaches surreal new heights as Agnetha and Frida sing their Swedish hearts out and abuse the listener's threshold of pleasure.  I highly recommend this record to all lovers of pop music!  Three cheers for ABBA!  Gimme an A!
B000001GK9|5.0|I enjoyed reading other reviewers' various comments about Herbert von Karajan below, although I am puzzled by those who never get around to actually talking about this recording.  This recording is, quite simply, one of the most amazing performances of any symphony by anyone anywhere -- ever.  Never have I ever heard the opening bars of the first movement sound so fragile, so tentative, yet so cohesive.  The movement starts out with a whisper and slowly builds -- organically, naturally, miraculously.  <br />I have to admit that I've never paid much attention to the shorter middle movements -- they sound fine, and the playing is very precise.  <br />The last movement, though, like the first movement, is unbelievably unified, passionate, and gripping.  It has the white-hot intensity of a live performance, and the playing of the Berlin Philharmonic is astonishingly polished and virtuosic, especially at the dramatic climax.<br />By all means, get this CD set!  Even if you're not a big Mahler fan, this recording is something else.
B00000JLX0|3.0|I fought against seeing this film for so long. I refused to see it in the cinema and refused to watch it on video. I was so tired of the hype of hearing about it and about how wonderful and sad it was. As if the tragedy of the real Titanic weren't enough! I am not a Leonardo DiCaprio fan by any means. The stories of cost overruns on the set and the thought of Billy Zane running through a ship that is sinking anyhow shooting a gun to kill DiCaprio is just inane (not to add, insane). One day, though, I don't know how, I got sucked into watching this film. It was too long. The dialogue was completely stilted and forced. And of course there were ridiculous parts, like Billy Zane chasing people with a gun on a ship that was already doomed. The love story I could have done without. The story of the Titanic and its doomed maiden voyage... classic, well told and duly dramatic enough to convey the sheer magnitude of this tragedy. The set and costumes were lovely. Kate Winslet was the star of this film in every way (she usually is in all her films anyhow). I cannot join the legions of people who heap meaningless praise on to the film, but I have to say that it was well crafted and happily all the hype is over.
6301942647|5.0|This film has in it some of the most beautiful cinematagrophy I have ever seen.  If reviews where it is criticised as being slow or arrested worry you as to whether you should rent or buy it I would judge it like this: if the thought of  walking through an art gallery and taking several minutes to sit or stand in front of some pictures to fully study and appreciate their beauty seems &quot;slow&quot; or &quot;arrested&quot; to you then you might not like it, if you can imagine yourself enjoying watching an expresionist/art noveau/surrealist set of  pictures come to life on your tv screen then you might like it.  I am dissapointed in those critics who can't imagine the medium of movies having value unless they are built around a fast paced linear plot line.  These are the same people who probably think poetry is a bunch of rubbish and &quot;Finnegan's Wake&quot; is an unreadable waste of time.  I hope and pray and fantasize that the studio that owns the rights to this movie will release it in greater numbers, drop the price, and (glory of all glorys) release it on dvd.  It is one of the greatest movies of one of the greatest directors of all time and should be more accesible.
B00003CWTH|5.0|An ensemble cast in a wholly surprising and overwhelming film by the director of Boogie Nights. The entire cast is in top form, all conveying their extremely human flaws and still coming across in a way that evokes sympathy from the audience. Tom Cruise is a misogynistic infomercial self-help guru who sells the concept of \\"Seduce and Destroy\\". The late Jason Robards is his dying father, a former television executive. Julianne Moore is Robards's wife, who is manic and frantic as Robards nears death. The always spectacular Philip Seymour Hoffman portrays Robards's in-home nurse who goes on a crusade to get in touch with Cruise's character when Robards requests a reunion with his long-estranged son. John C. Reilly is a police officer who takes his job quite seriously but somehow still manages to bungle things up. He is lonely and places a personal ad. However, instead, he meets a cocaine addicted woman, Claudia, when he responds to a noise disturbance call. They go out together, and he never suspects her addiction. Claudia's father is a game show host, Jimmy Gator, who has problems of his own. William H. Macy is a rather unstable man who used to be a child genius appearing on the game show Gator hosts. Macy is obsessed with getting braces. You get the idea. There are many stories going on at once, and they connect to one another brilliantly. All of these stories are augmented by the incomparable Aimee Mann soundtrack.
B00003CXRP|1.0|the most boringest movie ever. in this film Hanks shows no character. millions of reasons why i did not like this movie. the movie had great acting, but the plot sucked! i know that Zekemis can do better. if you want a better pick, pick &quot;what lies beneath&quot; starring Harrison Ford, Michelle Pfipher, and Diana Scarwid. i call a great hitchcockean thriller. top notch. so just scratch cast away off the do list and head to your local video store and rent &quot;benath&quot;.
B00000DG1R|5.0|This is a great compilation some of Duran Duran's best songs. It is highly recommended for someone new to the band, or if you just want one good overall CD of what the band is all about. These songs span a period of almost twenty years and are a testament to the bands long-lived and hard-fought talent. The recording job is top-quality and the CD is filled to the brim with good music. From &quot;New Moon on Monday&quot; to &quot;Electric Barbarella&quot;, all these jams will get you dancing. For people who dis this band, let me ask you, have you accomplished this much?
B00003CXDG|1.0|Normaly, I like any movie I see.  However, this one I could hardly stand.  I'm real sorry I wasted my money.  Just by the first one and forget about MI2.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I bought my DVD player just to get this film!!  Great film. I write this, for the 2cd time, after the Oscar nominations.  This was the box office hit Russell needed.  Great extras in the package.  One thing I did not like about the film was the relationship between the brother &amp; sister.  That was not needed!
B00004XONN|5.0|I acquired this album about two months ago and have listened to it about once a day since.  It's a fantastic album and if you are a true Radiohead fan you will not be disappointed.  If you're expecting 3 1/2 minute songs that are radio playable then this album probably won't make much sense to you.  This record is challenging but very rewarding, and is best listened to through headphones at 3am when you can't sleep.
6305878323|4.0|This is the first Disney film released after I was born.  I got into this film because of the music.  It is perfect!!

B000002UA0|5.0|Taking its title from a chapter in Kenneth Grahame's children's book &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;, Piper at the Gates of Dawn is classic psychedelic music. A genre that many claim Pink Floyd or more specifically (founding member) Syd Barrett invented. Although some might consider this statement a stretch, it might as well be true. The Floyd were making music that no one had heard of when they started out playing random gigs around England. On stage they crafted out long and trippy improv jams something however that this album lacks to cover fully. In songs such as &quot;Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk&quot; producer Norman Smith's edits are clearly audible in the mix. He considered most of it to be &quot;rubbish&quot; and simply took some scissors and cut random bits out of the tape. In light of this however, the instrumental classics &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot; and &quot;Pow R. Toc H.&quot; survived and went on to become Floyd favorites. <br />This album also covers the other side of early Pink Floyd or Syd Barrett for that matter. The album highlights his wonderfully crafted psychedelic pop songs that focus on children's fairy tales and other innocent items rather than the typical cliche songwriting topics of the time. Syd was a fantastic and innovative songwriter and it's a shame he couldn't do more with the Floyd afterwards. However even 2 to 3 years after Syd was &quot;dropped&quot; from the band his former colleagues were still playing some of the songs he had written. His influence would later surface on other Floyd albums such as &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;. The plain fact is that Pink Floyd wouldn't have existed if it weren't for Syd. According to those who knew him at the time he was an amazing individual and this album stands up as a testament to his genius.

0684800713|5.0|Jake Barnes was hurt in World WarI and since then he is impotent. This injury affects his relationship to Brett Ashley, the woman he loves, as well as his whole life.<br />Brett Ashley is an aristocratic and irrestibly beautiful but she has a trauma and this makes her unable to change her way of living. Since her fiancé died in the war she has tried to forget or to hide behind drunkenness and lust. She is unable to have steady relationships. Her lovers change as frequently as the sun rises. <br />Yet, as mentioned above Jake Barnes is in love with her. There is, however, his injury and secondly Brett's behaviour that makes love impossible. At first Jake doesn'tsee or doesn't want to see that he will never possess his true love.. He gets more and more jealous and absorbed. It makes him an eternal spectator of life. He is not able to live his own life. He is isolated and this makes him sick and purposeless. The war and his injury, in particular, made him a member of the lost generation. A generation that is so affected by the results of the war that they lost themselves. (see All Quiet On the Western Front) Jake's purposelessness is well shown by his drinking, by his treating of women ( Georgette and Brett) and by his travelling. He is trying to get away from himself. Merely the fact that he is an expatriate shows that he is homeless, a refugee. Once Bill, his friend, tells him: &quot;You're a an expatriate. you have lost touch with the soil. You spend your time talking not working.&quot; <br />His isolation and the fact that he is a spectator of life is well shown when he is in Pamplona watching the bull-fights. In the arena there is life going on. A bull fighter is so close to death that he lives his life with utmost intense but Jacke who is only watching outside, stays an eternal spectator of life.
0671042858|3.0|I have read a lot of stephen king books and the other day i saw this one at the store so i thought that i would pick it up i didnt really like it that much, there was not a lot going on like in most Stephen King novels. Another thing was that this book was not scary at all, i dont think it was meant to  be a thriller but all the critics are saying it is scary, i didnt see any scary parts in it at all. so if you want to get scared dont read this book.<br />But if you do want to get scared read<br />Salems lot, also by King Strangers, By dean Koontz Red Dragon, by Thomas Harris
0670451495|4.0|Robert McCloskey's classic children's book, Make Way for Ducklings is just as delightful in the year 2002 as it was back when it was first published in 1941.  The timeless story of Mr. and Mrs. Mallard and their eight adorable ducklings is still a fun read for children and parents alike. The story begins as the prospective parents search for a new home suitable for raising their young ones.  Mrs. Mallard is clearly the expert in this endeavor and Mr. Mallard is quite relieved when she finally settles on a spot that is not too dangerous or noisy for their young family.  The couple make themselves quite at home on a little island in the Charles River of Boston, a quiet oasis within the busy city. Soon the ducklings hatch and Mrs. Mallard sets about teaching them all they need to know in order to live in the city.  By now they have made good friends with some of their human neighbors, especially Michael, the policeman.  When the family makes its first trip into the city, Michael calls for backup and literally stops traffic all along their path.  The people the Mallards encounter are just as pleased to see the ducks as the Mallards are to be there.  The reader leaves the family settling comfortably for the night after a day of happily following the Swan boats in the park and eating the peanunts tossed their way. The charm of this book lies in both the heartwarming story and th realistic but idyllic illustrations.  McCloskey is quite gifted at portraying the natural world to children in a way that is authentic and familiar.  Most children have seen duck families in a nearby pond and witnessed the way the ducklings learn about the world by waddling along after their parents.  The sketched illustrations add to the natural feeling of the book.  The depiction of the ducks is terrific because they are visually expressive but still look like ducks. Another engaging facet of the story is the positive interaction between animals and humans.  The Mallards find a way to live comfortably within a city full of people and their human neighbors are welcoming and accommodating. Overall, this a warm and timeless book.  It is just perfect for a parent and child to read together or for a teacher to read to a classroom of younger kids.  This is a good selection for children aged 3 to 7.
B00000J6AG|5.0|I repeat: this is techno at it's most &quot;live&quot; and organic. For proof, just listen to the opener, &quot;Honey&quot;. The turntable scratch is the only thing that doesn't sound like it was recorded live. Dance music has been lacking in the &quot;live sound&quot; department for quite some time, and this was a great idea: blues and gospel vocals added to modern electronic beats.<br />Of course, that wouldn't mean jack if the album didn't have good songs on it, and it undoubtedly does. &quot;Honey&quot; and &quot;Natural Blues&quot; are great examples of this concept, but the real winner is &quot;Run On&quot;, an incredibly catchy song that could be the album's highlight. &quot;Porcelain&quot;, &quot;Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad?&quot;, and &quot;My Weakness&quot; are just some of my favorite slower songs here. &quot;Machete&quot; is an Underworld-esque track that is a lot better than it sounds on paper, and &quot;Bodyrock&quot; is the last great big beat song.<br />All in all, this is probably Moby's finest hour, and a great achievement for the world of dance music. It seems to appeal to those outside the techno world, too, making this a rare crossover. Appreciate it now or be left behind.
B000004727|1.0|In this album, Paco de Lucia for the first time revealed himself to be bankrupt of ideas and musicality. <br />He also managed to make manifest the last cynical betrayal of his flamenco heritage. It disturbs me to say that - indeed, I never thought I would be thinking such thoughts - because Paco at one time (the 60s, 70s, and early 80s) was almost single-handedly carrying forward the torch of hope for this unique, and at the time somewhat neglected, folk-art in its instrumental form.<br />Then came this flamenco guitarist's infatuation with jazz and pop. That was the eighties. It was a romance that evidently went on a little too long, ending in a smug marriage. Almoraima was the beginning of the end. But at least Almoraima was original, steeped as it was in the Gypsy-Arab heritage of Andalucia.<br />With &quot;Siroco&quot; and &quot;Luzia&quot;, the aficionado of flamenco puro is transported into a kind of waking nightmare of flamenquismo, a return to the bad old days of the Flamenco Opera. Remember? - Just what Falla and Lorca so decried in their 1922 Concurso del Cante Jondo. Then, it was orchestration of the chico (light) flamenco with fandanguillos and tanguillos proliferating, along with an almost total marginalization of such profounder forms as the Siguiriya and Solea. In the 1980s, it was proposed to replace these with a dizzying multitude of whirling Bulerias and Rumbas por guitarra. Not so bad a fate, some might think.<br />Nothing is sacred to this instrumentalist. His bowing and scraping to the demands of a pop-propagandised mass audience will go on: and the worst of it is, people will be convinced that this is what constitutes flamenco, because such is the power of the sleeve-note (Felix Grande turned pseud extraordinaire).<br />What is the remedy for the average listener looking for genuine expression in instrumental flamenco? She won't find the Duende here. I suggest going back initially to the very first days of recordings of the flamenco guitar - to the man who started it all and, many would argue, has never been improved upon musically - namely, Ramon Montoya. Next, progress to Nino Ricardo, and then on to the scintillating falsetas of Sabicas. And finally you might console yourself with Paco de Lucia's own two debut recordings: La Fabulosa Guitarra, and Fantasia Flamenca. They are a beautiful peak from which the flamenco guitar could only descend thereafter. You see, it wasn't always this way...
B000002U82|5.0|What can i say about Dark Side of the Moon. Truly an epic in music making. From the begining and the end Floyd shows us how their unique sound can captivate so many listeners. When i first started listening to the album i only listen to the more well known songs; Time, Money, Brain Damage, Eclipse. All unbelivable songs and each one its own style. Yet it wasn't until i actually sat down and listened to the whole album when i realized how unbelivable the albumm is. -On the Run- is a great lulling song. That is almost hipnotic. -The Great Gig in the Sky- is a great song with an awesome melody. This one i never listened to before and i absolutly love it. My Favorite track on the Album is definetly -Us and Them-. Truly a testament to how musicaly inclinde Pink Floyd was and still is. The song sends shivers through my spine everytime i hear it. With the songs -Brain Damage- and Eclipse- the album ends, but at what a climax. Brain Damage is repetative and soothing. Then eclipse builds and builds into an awesome finish. One of the best endings to any album. (&quot;The End&quot; Abbey Road) In the end, an awesome album, one for any person who loves good tunes. Pinkl Floyd's music is timeless. I started listening to Floyd when i was 13. Im 18 know and many of my friends share the same feelings towards them as i do. Simply Timeless music!!!
B000058T5E|5.0|No guitarist takes bigger chances than Jeff Beck. His distinctive stylings have never settled into the predictable, and never will. He never panders to commercial interests. Here, he takes another bold step forward. Just as it was with his previous album, the decidedly more mannered &quot;Who Else?&quot;, Beck challenges us again. This time he and Andy Wright take us even deeper into techno. The funky riffs and crunchy rhythms keep coming, fast and hard, and Jeff wreaks havoc. For big, aggressive, hard edged Jeff Beck, you will be thrilled. Guns ablazing! If you are looking for ballads, there is little of it except for &quot;Nadia&quot; (but it is upbeat). The standout track is &quot;Suspension&quot;, a haunting and quiet whisper of a number that will stay with you long after you shut off the stereo.
B000058983|5.0|this review is intended for those already in the know. thus, i will only deal with the unreleased stuff here. first of all, i feel the bonus material is a revelation and reason enough to purchase this cd (as if the improved sound of the original disc weren't reason enough). the first bonus track, &quot;hummingbirds&quot;, is a da capo era outtake. it amounts to an instrumental demo of &quot;the good humor man...&quot; the stripped down 2 guitar and bass instumentation really brings out the subtleties of the tune. the guitar playing is great and you get to hear a little arthur quote at the end of the demo. the next track &quot;wonder people (i do wonder)&quot; will be familiar to the owners of arthur lee's 1981 self titled album on rhino records. while this song sounds a little less polished than the cuts that made the official &quot;forever changes&quot; album, it is still an nice listen. arthur's vocal is pretty flat, but then again this isn't finished product. maclean's acoustic soloing really shines on this track as well. the &quot;alone again or&quot; alt. mix is, unfortunately, not the maclean lead vocal mix i was hoping for. apparently, that mix has been lost. the next track is an alt. mix of &quot;you set the scene&quot; which features a previously unheard vocal out section during the last minute of the song. it doesn't improve the song, but is interesting none the less. now on to the &quot;your mind and we...&quot; tracking sessions. this stuff is great. lots of arthur lee instructing his band on how to perform the song, take after take. it's cool to hear arthur's instructions as the song  slowly comes together. eventually the band gets through the tune but echols' solo is not &quot;on&quot;. arthur asks him what his trip is.. and the solo is cut again. later on the cd, at the end of the 45 version of the tune, you can hear arthur congratulating echols on a great solo. as a side note, i once read that nobody in love besides arthur lee could verify if they had personally played on &quot;your mind and we...&quot;. after 44?!?? takes you'd think SOMEONE would remember this session. blame it on the brown acid i guess. so that's it folks. i highly recommend these bonus tracks, as they've given me a new insight into the creative process behind this must own cd. enjoy.
B0000524CY|4.0|This restored version of The Exorcist was better than the original version, but I was disappointed by a couple of things. When the original movie was released on DVD, it had a documentary called &quot;The Fear of god&quot;. In it, they showed some of this cut footage including the spider walk which showed Regan &quot;spidering&quot; down the stairs. When she gets to the bottom of the stairs, she flexes her tongue like a snake and then tries to get Sharon while walking on her hands and knees. I'd like to know why this was not included in this new added footage cut. The spider scene was so quick in this movie it was barely worth the effort to see. Why didn't you show the whole spider walk scene, Mr. Freidkin? There was also no blood in Regan's mouth when she reached the bottom of the stairs in the original footage. Actually I think this was CGIed in to give today's audience some gore. Which is unfortunate because The Exorcist never had any bloody scenes it it. That documentary also showed footage of Ellen and Linda walking around town and sight seeing. Freidkin said he didn't include this in the new version because he lost the dialog tapes. But it could have still been kept in and had music over the footage.   They could have at least put that other footage on the DVD in an &quot;other footage&quot; section. Like in the original DVD release, there is a separate audio tract with that actress (forgot her name) doing extra demon voices.   This version also has Freidkin doing a narration over the movie. It starts out with reflections of how the movie was made, but then it turns into Freidkin simply describing the scenes as we see them--in a very long and repetitive fashion I might add!  This new version was good, but there's still another &quot;version we've never seen&quot; out there. Maybe we'll see it one day.
B000053GTF|5.0|I have been a Celine fan over 10 years with 1 of the largest U.S. collections and also know several of her fan club members,enough on that ,i must say ;This Dvd was Excellent Sound and Picture /quality and quantity wise ..ah,with the exception of being Different than THE 1 Celines' fan club told her fans in the last fan mag recently,we definetely didn't need 2 versions of :Its all coming back to me now!!the photos were great ,and so was the biography,should have included some form of collectors book with photos but no,just another 99 ad from sony on old dvds they have for sale ( puhlease)...by the way according to my good associates in Celines' fan club the Bonus song was supposed to be : all by myself..and the version of &quot;My heart will go on&quot; was supposed to be LIVE from Au Couer Du Stade..hmmm..???                   If you are a celine fan at all this Dvd is the must have !! But as always some naive Celine fans are happy with anything with her name on it...BUT this was really a good buy,and finally showed class more than other items released on her lately... (the ;last c.d. ) (the biography;she didn't write)..SO YES !!! Go out and get this Dvd Now!!!! Editor ;Celine Queen Of Pop..
6305313687|4.0|Wow. I didn't want to watch this movie at first, but it has since become one of my all-time favorites. It is incredibly graphic in almost all areas (nudity, violence, language), but only to hammer the lifestyle these characters live home. <br />The movie stars Edward Norton as Derek, a Neo-Nazi skinhead in the city of Venice Beach, Cali. Angered by his father's death and the circumstances surrounding it, he turns to a path of race hatred culminating in the brutal killings of 2 black men. In prison, he learns that his rhetoric and propaganda won't save him here - he must rely on bribes paid to other race groups to survive. After a brutal rape by fellow skinheads, he renounces his racist views and, once released from prison, must prevent his younger brother Danny from following in his footsteps.<br />This is a very powerful movie, with scenes that can shock and sicken. It carries the highest possible RSAC ratings for violence, language, and sexuality. Beyond all that, however,  you'll find an excellent film with a powerful message.
0446608955|1.0|First, let me say that I am usually not a very harsh critic, I try to find something positive in every book I read. For example, &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot; which is probably not a very sophisticated piece of literature either, is one of my favorites and I gave it five stars. But &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; is so full of kitsch and clichs, it's just ridiculous. The sweet but plain minister's daughter who helps orphans and injured animals, the &quot;wild boy&quot; who is not so wild after all and tries to do the right thing, his buddy, the most popular guy in town who also turns out to be a real nice guy and the pretty cheerleader who has &quot;banana pudding where her brains should have been&quot; - oh, please! Shallow characters and a very unrealistic and foreseeable plot form a fairy-tale without the usual &quot;and they lived happily ever after&quot;-ending. So if you are a romantic teenage girl looking for a story that will make you cry your eyes out, you found it. For all others, it's just a big fat waste of time. Sorry, Nicholas Sparks, but this book is definitely one of the worst I have ever read, and I bet it would have been rejected by every publisher, had it been your first novel.
0451197968|5.0|This book reads amazingly fast. It is very different then the Movie.  It took about 2 days reading to finish this book and I will remeber the characters for a long time. This book is not as political as I would like but it still is a good anti-government book.<br />Fun read, very exciting and very nice ending.
0380730367|5.0|Having just finished Prayers for Rain, I have to say, it's another book you can't put down and wish there were more when you are done. Lehane weaves a seductive tale of force and brutality of a man able to get into the lives of people and forces their breakdown. The characters are rich with substance and are portrayed as vulnerable, yet unwilling to back down from their fears. I am running out right now to get another of his books!
0345404475|5.0|In addition to having the most original book title in history, &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot; is an amazing novel.  At its most fundamental level, it questions what it means to be human.  Is the soul fundamental to life, or is it the product of compassion and experience?  Furthermore, is religion a product of human experience, or is it a guide for human experience?  Dick doesn't claim to know the answers to these questions, but, as is the case in many of his novels, it is the asking that is important.  The fact that such deep thinking occurs in a brilliantly imagined post-apocalyptic city populated by deep, wonderful characters makes this novel all the more remarkable.
B000056VPD|1.0|Disappointing for all who expect GB as a brilliant musician.The dvd sound is bad an the whole concert made me feel like a benefit concert for former great musician.The pictures do the rest.Watching 60 year old irish women,dancing in front of the stage and the disappointing music made me stop the dvd and bring it back to the store.Sad.sad,sad.
B000002HD5|4.0|First, let's consider the album cover itself.  Click the little album, blow it up.  There you go.  In the foreground, a young shirtless boy can't maintain eye contact with either you, the viewer, or the reclining girl on the bed.  There's sadness in his eyes.  There's a sullen tension in his face.  The boy and girl appear to be about 10.<br />Why does any of that matter?  Well, the picture tells the story of the man, Greg Dulli, and his (former) band, The Afghan Whigs.  The songs on Gentlemen aren't about Gentlemen; they're about men and women who hurt each other and long for each other and for the hurt that the other will inflict.  Lyrically, this is strong stuff.<br />The music serves the lyrics.  Angry guitars with more funk than Nirvana and more crooning than Pearl Jam.  The Afghan Whigs were never able to break into the mainstream, but came closest on this, their major label release.<br />Dulli's songwriting lashes out at others as well as himself.  The album's major themes are self-loathing, emotionally destructive relationships, and any other unpleasant feelings that Greg Dulli happened to have while he had a pen in his hand.<br />I give it 4 stars because it's the Whigs best album.  I listened to it a lot when it came out, but it hasn't been in the CD player for a while.  I only give 5 stars for life changing albums, and not many people would want to change their lives for Greg's circa 1993.
B000058983|5.0|jesus were do i start ? well i was reading in rolling stone about their guitarist  bryan dying and they were describing their music with all these weird diferent genres all put together, like classical and folk and flamenco and rock and i got so sick of hearing about them i went to the coolest record store and picked up this cd forever changes that is suppose to be so a head of its time. well i immediatley went home tom play  it expecting the worse and what i got was this. some of the best acoustic guitar work ever and the string and horn arrangements  really make this such a powerfull  moving piece of art.  the lead singer arthur lee has got this really trembly voice that sounds like hes scared of the whole world collapsing but yet holding out a glimmer of hope the arrangements are almost progressive rock but to be honest  i dont like progressive rock at all because its way too pretentious this one isnt in the least  its stirring and emotional and the occasinal electric guitar works very well within  the subtle frame work of this. sometimes the lyrics  make me think hes prophetic.  wow!! and too think they had the balls to never perform live because it would be neer impossible to duplicate this exactly live so instead of duluting it without the strings and horns they took the hard road ans stuck to the guns knowing it  might flod commercial if thwey didnt tour. it also sounds very similiar too moody blues early stuff i will leave you guys a piece of prophetic poetry from this genuis. this comes from the song red telephone &quot;their lockin them up today there throwing away the key/ i wonder who will it be tomorrow you or me&quot; cool huh? if you cant relate to that u just aint human!
B000001GQP|5.0|Prior to buying this recording, I had owned the Robert Shaw/Atlanta Symphony recording on Telarc.  For a long time I was satisfied with it, simply because I did not have very high expectations for this work.  Then, one day, I suddenly decided that Carmina Burana is more than merely a popular classical tune.  I wanted a performance that breathed life into the work, something that the Shaw recording had failed to do.<br />I tried several other &quot;top&quot; recordings before finally decided to buy this one.  They included the Ormandy (Sony), Muti (EMI), and Previn (EMI).  One that I wish I had the chance to try, though, is the Blomstedt recording on London.  Nonetheless, after listening to these versions, I decided to buy the Jochum.  To be honest, except for maybe the Ormandy, Jochum's recording does not sound as good as the others.  At times, the recorded sound does show its age.  However, the performance is absolutely first rate.  As others have already mentioned, except for that little track of Janowitz's, everything else is great.  While it'll be too pompous to say that this is the definitive recording of the work, you are really missing out on a great performance if you don't even give it a try.  I hope you will decide to let Orff and Jochum take you back in time to the Middle Ages.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Gladiator, the film with a leading 12 Oscar nominations for the 2001 Academy Awards, is the first film in quite a while to return to the epics of the past.  Reminiscent of Spartacus and Ben Hur, Ridley Scott's masterful direction transports you back to the peak of the Roman empire.  This film is certainly well deserving of all the recognition it has received thus far.   On a side note, the musical score, which won a Golden Globe Award, is truly magnificent as well.
B00004T1C8|5.0|My only complaint about this item is that some other brands of trains get stuck in this tunnel and also those trains didn't trigger the noises (ie, activate the magnetic strip) unless they were pulling another car.  I would still buy it, though, my 4 yr old boy loves the noises.  However, also note this is the noisiest of the Brio train noise makers and can interfere with your hearing tv if it's in the same room.
B0000524CY|5.0|What a difference a few minutes of footage can make! Having seen this film countless times since it's original release, watching the newest release was like seeing the entire film for the first time. The sound is fantastic! One place (which I won't mention), made me jump like never before, haha... (congradulations! I don't scare easily.) The extra footage adds an even more solid, subtle base to the overall tale, and yes, the 'spider walk', brief as it is, is a welcomed sight. If your eyes are alert, you can play 'Count The Pazuzus', as shadows and reflections show the demon hovering around the house as it zooms in for the kill. I must say, if you are into audio commentaries (I had the DVD version), that is a bit of a snooze. Where were the behind-the-scenes tales and trivia from 'back-when', and talk of why/where areas of the film were remastered from an artistic viewpoint? Was it fun or a chore? The director simply tells you what you already know as far as the story itself as it moves along... (It's like 'Read along with William Friedkin' :) Once in a while he might tell you an interesting tidbit (like the history behind the dig in Iraq), but I had a paperback book from the early 70's that was much more in-depth in the making and goings-ons behind the film you see. He scarcly mentions much about the new scenery added, and while talking about the scene in the doctor's office, there's a fun 'echo' as he says exactly what the characters are saying, but he's telling it like it's supposed to be informative for the listener, haha! Still, you get to see the show again, from a different perspective, so not a total loss, just not an additional reason to buy...
B000056V73|5.0|I saw ALMOST FAMOUS last year and loved every minute of it.  It's about a young man pursuing his dream!  Like the other reviewers, I was surprised that the movie did not earn more acclaim.  <br />ALMOST FAMOUS will make you laugh.  It will make you cry.  It will inspire you to realize your own dreams!<br />Being on a student budget, I'll have to wait until the price drops before I can purchase this on video; but once it does, you can be sure I'll have a personal copy, as well as extras to give away as gifts to those who have the courage to dream!
B000050XEI|5.0|For those who say that this is nothing new and that she has not gone through any great strides in making a good CD, they are wrong.  The only thing that I have to say is listen to &quot;Wild Child&quot;.  The music is deep and relaxing at the same time.  Enya seems to have more of an upbeat sound to her and the music doesn't put you to sleep, yet you could if you wanted to.<br />I am extremely impressed by what this cd has to offer and I can listen to it time and time again and never want to put it back in the CD case.
006097625X|5.0|Unique insights and ideas<br />...and practically on every page, too. <br />What can I say? This book, and the sequel Reinventing Comics, are damn important, and yet they are entertaining and a pleasure to read as well. Get 'em.
B000002PC6|2.0|What is it, exactly, about music you heard when you were young? Whether you loved it, loved it only secretly, or hated it, you are doomed to revisit it. So with me and Olivia Newton-John's \\"Physical,\\" an album both like and unlike anything else in her output to that point. My sister had this album when I was just a kid, and I don't remember thinking too highly of it as she played it. No matter--to this day, this album can still play out in my head whenever I want, and sometimes when I don't.<br />In any case, \\"Physical\\" was something of a marketing ploy for Newton-John, who to that point had largely confined herself and her wispy, waifish, debatably overpretty voice, to monster hits characterized by pseudo-country flavorings and often painfully affected innocence (\\"Have You Never Been Mellow,\\" \\"I Honestly Love You,\\" etc.) For this album, her fans were asked to swallow a newer and marginally more sexual image. It would have worked, but the title tune was badly overplayed, which placed Newton-John in direct competition with innumerable other female singers who could emote sexuality with a little more sincerity.  Perhaps abetted by a (inadvertently?) campy video, and by endless repetition in aerobics classes nationwide, \\"Physical\\" is perhaps now more commonly associated with the early 80s fitness fad, and stands as something of a novelty tune.<br />That's too bad, since some other tracks on this album are more worthwhile. \\"Stranger's Touch\\" beats out \\"Physical\\" as the one track in Newton-John's entire output where she really _does_ sound sexy, while \\"Make a Move on Me\\" comes close in the verses, and is only undone by the sing-songy chorus (still, a nice hook) and a cheesy introductory synth riff. \\"Silvery Rain\\" is high on studio-effect-mediated atmosphere, but don't pay too much attention to the lyrics, which introduce Newton-John's ongoing strain of simplistic environmentalism (I lean strongly left on environmental issues, personally, but I find most celebrity foraysinto the topic to be largely naive and silly). \\"Recovery\\" and the other tracks are more typical of her earlier output, but the album as a whole sounds different, perhaps due to a persistent studio-distorted or -reverbed acoustic guitar present on most of the tracks.<br />\\"Physical\\" stands as Newton-John's most interesting _sound_, and includes some of her best vocals. That this places her squarely in the middle of the heap of female pop vocalists should prevent no one from sampling its guilty pleasures.
6303407188|5.0|This movie is very good. The idea that it's in black and white may seem annoying to some people but I think it makes the movie feel more \\"real\\" (like `Schindler's List'). This movie doesn't make fun of Edward D. Wood. Jr. or portrays him as an idiot or an incompetent filmmaker, but as a man who really wanted to make movies, and believed they could be successful. The actors are great, Martin Landau got an Academy Award for playing the old, sick Bela Lugosi. The movie feels very real and it is a fascinating story. I suggest you buy it, especially if you're interested in Wood and his movies.
6304510861|5.0|Lost Highway is set in a world where time is dangerously out of control, hypnotic and intoxicating.  Time is looped like in `six figures'; the film starts then starts again.  The end is the start and the start is the end.  The contrast of speed at the first half of the film to the second half is very strong.  The first half is slow and moody; the second is speed up at an incredible rate.  The opening credits with the point of view shot of speeding down a highway, also shows the speeds of time and its flowing continuum. <br />   David Lynch has made some of the most beautifully paced films of all time, pure poetry in motion. His use of time is truly special.
B0000508U6|5.0|This was the album to give me hope.  After the late 80's/early 90's I had virtually given up on music here in the US and clung to my house, dance, punk, alternative, and rap albums from a decade ago wondering what happened to all the creativity, the diversity of sounds, the emotions . . . the great music.  As I was driving up to Belfast from Dublin this summer though I heard something new and I knew then and there I had to own this album.  It was &quot;Trouble&quot;, the 6th track on this album.  It was moving and filled with emotion and beautiful to listen to.  It was a piece (albeit a small one) of what the music scene has been missing for some time.  When I returned to Chicago in November this was one of the first albums I bought.  While I will agree that Coldplay still needs to develop themselves this album was an incredible beginning and I am sure that they will find that there is a rather large audience out there waiting to embrace their sound.  I hope they continue to grow and to cultivate themselves from this great foundation though.
0553106635|5.0|In all 3 of the series Martin has been unpredictable.  It is refreshing to not know who is going to win, or lose who is going to die,or win.  A really enjoyable series.
6302799066|5.0|You know a film is a classic when George C. Scott, Peter Sellers and Sterling Hayden are merely the icing on the cake! Stanley Kubrick's timeless satire of Cold War politics will probably still have 'em rolling in the aisles in 3001 (if they haven't dropped The Big One by then). Terry Southern's screenplay is so full of memorable lines that you might as well place quotation marks at either end. As he had already demonstrated in Kubrick's &quot;Lolita&quot;, Peter Sellers shows an uncanny ability at playing mulitple characters, affecting a German and American accent that sound as natural as his native Queen's English in this outing. George C. Scott bellows, gesticulates, cajoles, glowers, sulks and generally pulls every face known to mankind in the most deliciously hammy performance of his career as the hilariously named General Buck Turgidson. Sterling Hayden gives all actors a master class on how to play black comedy by remaining as serious as a heart attack while he delivers the movie's most savagely funny monologue. Outstanding supporting performances abound. I guarantee you won't be putting this one on &quot;pause&quot; to relieve your precious bodily fluids until the final credits roll!
B000055Y0X|5.0|With Dick Cheney and Colon Powell in the Whitehouse using Bush as a pawn to get back at Suddam for their shortfalls in the gulf war, this movies is as funny and scary today as it was when it was first released.  Who voted for him anyway?  Politics aside, this is one of Kubrick's best movies, definitely his funniest.  The new extras are great and the excellent replay value makes it worth owning.
B000058T5E|5.0|So glad to see the new album by J.B within only 17 monthes! the absolut record of this guitar-god. he usually releases new stuff after 5 years or longer. how can i say of this another-master-piece? just push play and put 5 stars!
0789723107|5.0|Steve Krug has written an excellent and witty guide to web usability. It is a &quot;must read&quot; for students of web design as well as for professional web designers and developers. Clearly written and fun to read, it's bound to become a bestselling favorite!
B00000J6AG|5.0|This album in amazing and has definitely made me a Moby fan.  From the great top 40 track &quot;South side&quot; to the jamming sound of &quot;Bodyrock&quot; on to the haunting sound of &quot;Inside&quot; behind the emotinally turbulent ads of Ireland's safe driving campaign (summer and fall 2000) Moby has a sound for everyman.  This is perhaps the most creative and exciting album to come along in years.  It is ever changing, constantly evolving, and certainly not stuck into any peg hole the music industry would like to stuff it in.  It is truely expansive.  If you don't like anything Moby has to offer than you probably won't like anything at all.
B00004XMVH|5.0|This movie was great.  It has many ingredients to make it very well done.  The actors were superb and with the action in this movie, I just cant stop watching it over and over.  Go and try out this movie, and when the price lowers, go and buy it.
B00000K2SC|1.0|Now let's take time out to praise the genius of &quot;The Matrix.&quot;  Really, this movie must be a work of genius because the characters have cool NAMES like Trinity, Neo, and Morpheus (*swooning*).  This movie must be the best movie ever made because when people shoot guns, the bullets can go in slow motion and leave TRAILS (*gasping*).  This movie must be 'more than meets the eye' because it plays out like an expensive videogame (*cool!*).  This movie has to be a treat for all those 'intellectuals' out there, who think sub-Shakespearian monologues sandwiched in between pointless FX scenes make for an intelligent film (*stimulated*).  And of course, keeping up with style, this movie must be GREAT because the characters wear very chic black leather outfits!  These are all the makings of an American classic, if you ask me.<br />Please, people...if you need something to open up the neural floodgates, go with &quot;Fight Club,&quot; a movie that's truly original and loaded with ideas and doesn't hide behind smoke and mirrors to pass itself off as an intelligent film.
B0000029DD|5.0|Jeff Buckley died too soon, as did his father. His music lives on and this IS the best record of the 90's. The record being a debut album is unbeleivable. In my opinion this is a top 3 all time record, right up there with Bob Dylan's Blood On The Tracks, The Band's The band, Nick Drake's Pink Moon or Van Morrison's Astral Weeks... A must have for any person who claims to be &quot;interested&quot; in music!<br />I couldn't live without it!
0767836286|2.0|well, i found Arlington Road a good suspense film,but i have to say that the ending was way too disturbing for me.It was so unfair what happenned to Michael Faraday(Jeff Bridges).It was like a punch on my stomach...It wasnt necessary a happy ending there are lots of films whose endings are not happy but theyre great. Now this ending really made me upset...
B00003CWL6|5.0|When Kevin Spacey said the line, &quot;I rule,&quot; I couldn't help but say, yes, yes you do.  What an incredible performance by Spacey, and the whole cast, really.  This movie will leave you thinking about life when the credits begin to roll, much like the Shawshank Redemption and other modern day classics.  Truly an awesome movie.  I loved it, you will too.
B000056VIY|4.0|Critics that have ripped into Ms. Lopez's second album really show their lack of insight or just plain haven't listened to the album at all.  Granted, she is not the greatest female vocalist of her time, but then, she doesn't claim to be and then who is? Whitney? (Late 90's Whitney I mean)..Mariah?(Her beautiful voice has not been the same since &quot;Emotions&quot;)..Madonna?(She has even stated that she isn't a great singer!) Bottom line, this album does tend to sound a little like what we have heard in the past (but then again, I guess that is to be expected whenever the greatest &quot;ripoff thief&quot; of all time, Puff Daddy, is involved in any way). Songs like &quot;I'm Real&quot; makes me wish that Michael Jackson would hurry up and release his new album and &quot;Ain't It Funny&quot;(which hints of Madonna)sound like other songs that either had an influence on the artist and/or the songwriters, but in this age of &quot;sampling&quot; and copy-cat sound and &quot;do what the guy before you did&quot; mentality, this album does have a fresh ring to it. The album is a good effort from an actress/dancer/singer and if the album and she are taken in that order, then it's worth listening to. Give it a try.
B000056N8X|4.0|Okay, I am a new viewer to the Highlander saga and I am totally enchanted by the movies and the series.  I haven't found the second and third movies yet but have seen the original and end game and was captivated from beginning to end.  From what I've seen, continuity isn't the greatest but do I care?  No, the action was more than enough to compensate for that.  The swordplay in this movie has much improved from the first movie and also an improvement over the series.  If you're going to watch EndGame, in my opinion, you must see the first Highlander movie first and even watch some of the series to get a feel for the characters and the traits that they each bring to this movie.  That's crucial to find out how both these characters tick.  My definition of a good movie is if I cry, it's worth watching...I cried.<br />Looking forward to seeing more!
B00004XOWM|5.0|I love this CD, and for the people who said the title is stupid, YOU are stupid, I think its a hella funny title.  You probabnly don't get what it really means, starfish?  hot dog?  chocolate? Nevermind, and the title has nothing to do with music.  Same with lyrics, this CD has good music in it withit's own style Ihavent heard anywhere else.  I'd say a must for all the people who like new alternative!
0393038912|4.0|Geography is destiny is the moral of this book. At the beginning he relates a question posed to him by a New Guinea native: Why is it that the whites have all the cargo [technology] and his compatriots don't?<br />Diamond boils it down to four key issues: the availability of plants and animals to be domesticated, the ease with which this domestication can be transferred (east-west being easier than north-south due to similar climates), isolation, and the size of the population. What we call western civilization emerged in the fertile soil of southwestern Asia, with a host of available plants and animals for domestication. It then spread rapidly along the east-west axis of Eurasia. This reliance on farming made a dense population possible, which along with the proximity of the domesticated animals led to a host of endemic diseases. These diseases, when brought to the Americas, did more to subjugate the natives than either the guns or the steel of the title.<br />This thesis is explained in detail, first in overview and then with the quick example of the Polynesian islands. Part two of the book covers food production and the domestication of animals. Part three expands by covering the increase in disease and the spread of writing and technology based on the previous principles. And the final part provides a quick investigation of five parts of the world that demonstrate how geography affected their inhabitation and culture.<br />It's a powerful and persuasive thesis, though Diamond admits that further investigation is needed.<br />His prose is straightforward if somewhat rhetorical. He hews very closely to the advice that a writer should tell you what he's going to tell you, tell you, then tell you what he's told you. He's also quite fond of rhetorical questions, though this seems a useful device in this context.<br />Overall, it's a fascinating and thought-provoking book, and includes an extension section on recommended further reading--all of which sound very interesting as well!
B0000399WI|5.0|What an extraordinary accomplishment this film is.  Truly remarkable.  Sure, they show it 20 times a month on TBS/TNT, but hell, it's more than worth a buy.  Best movie... ever.
B0000065O1|5.0|I was really impressed with both of Cindy's videos.  Although difficult to do at first, once the workouts have been done more than three or four times, they become easier.  I like the fact that after doing them, I feel slightly sore the next day--exactly where I want to be sore!  Then I know the moves Radu's put together are really working.  I find the cardio section of Cindy's Next Challenge video a bit too rigorous and short; but the video itself is presented (on the cover) as a toning one, which strives to lengthen and firm various areas of the body, which I think it does well.
B00000IQC8|5.0|despite what a previous reviewer said, this is not the BEST movie ever made.  the camera work is pedestrian at best, with generally poor cinematography.  to date, smith has yet to learn how to work with the camera.  however, he's a damn fine writer and has constructed one of the better comedies of the 90's here.<br />the transfer here is good, about as good as you can get with the quality they started with.  the audio commentary is mostly smith, with a smattering of the others, and mewes occasionally grunting a response.  it feels like de niro's commentary on meet the parents, but smith is entertaining enough to more than make up for the other's shortcomings here.  the commentary is almost as funny as the movie itself.
0385486804|4.0|Wow... I read this book in a single afternoon. In the beginning of the book I was thinking &quot;this Alex/Chris kid is a definite nutcase&quot;. By the end of the book I was thinking that I too could take off to Alaska and spend some time there.<br />The story is full of the beauty of life, of sad and pathetic irony, and of a tragic death. He led such an interesting life, and yet by the end of the book I still could not decide whether I thought he was crazy, arrogant, ignorant, or just out for adventure like the rest of us.<br />A very good read.
0399226907|5.0|I remember reading this book as a small child, but not in the board edition.  In the book we had, you had to be careful when you touched the holes in the pages (let's face it, no child can resist that) because the thin paper would tear.  However, it's always been a magical story about growth, transformation and the perils of too much junk food.<br />Now I'm the mother of a toddler who LOVES caterpillars.  This book was a no-brainer gift for her and imagine how pleased I was to find it in board form.  What a brilliant idea!  Tiny fingers can poke into the holes chewed by the caterpillar with no harm done.  This book lives in our diaper bag, except for the 3-4 times a week we pull it out and read it at bedtime.  A must have!
0517118297|4.0|As a devoted reader of Jane Austen's novels, I thought this book was the answer to my prayers. Except for Sanditon, it contains all her novels, and it has a pleasing presentation.<br />But there are some details in this book that can become quite bothering. As I read Pride and Prejudice, I noticed that an entire line of a dialog between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet (the main characters) is omitted, and frankly, it is difficult to follow the conversation without that particular line. There are also many other mistakes in the text (i.e. 'becausee'). If you are too particular about this kind of errors (like me), maybe you should choose another book. If you don't really care about these things, it is a good choice.
B00003CXE7|4.0|Gladiator is a good movie (although not as great as some would have you believe), and I highly recommend it.  However, I take issue with the idea that it is at all historically accurate.<br />In reference to Trevor Cook's review (see below), there is little actual history in this movie.  Marcus Aurelius, the Roman Emperor who died in the beginning of the movie, did not die at the hands of his son, Commodus.  Rather, he caught a dangerous infection (possibly plague) and died at his camp at Vindobona (Vienna).  And the Emperor had named his son Commodus his heir several years before that.<br />It is not known if Commodus went mad.  However, he was known for his cruelty and he did fall victim to his physical vices.  He often appeared in staged lion and tiger hunts in the Coliseum, where he liked to call himself Hercules.<br />Because he enraged many of Rome's senators, they tried to assassinate him with the help of his sister, Lucilla.  But the plot failed.  Commodus naturally became paranoid and therefore launched a campaign of terror against his enemies.  Eventually, an assassination attempt against him was successful, and he was strangled in his bath (and not, as the reviewer below would have you believe, in battle as a gladiator).<br />So, while Gladiator is a good movie and I have nothing against it, do not mistake it for history.  It is a fictional account based on historical people.  Nothing more and nothing less.

0805047905|3.0|If I were rating this book for me, I'd give it five stars.  The illustrations are gorgeous, and the concept is really strong.  It teaches sequencing as well as color and animal identification.  I bought this book for my daughter, who's 2 1/2, because I knew they read it at preschool.  However, she has never been particularly interested in having me read it to her.  (I have noticed her &quot;reading&quot; it to herself a couple of times.)  It's a preschool classic, but I'd make sure your child actually likes it before buying a copy for home.
0385484518|5.0|The novel, Tuesdays With Morrie, is a very well-written, five-star novel that really makes you think deep inside of your heart.  One of the main characters, Morrie Schwartz, is an old and wise man, who was diagnosed of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, (ALS), a brutal, unforgiving illness of the neurological system.  There is no cure.  It is terminal.  Morrie knows he is going to die in about two years.  In this book, Mitch Albom has the reader take a walk on that final bridge between life and death, while Morrie narates the trip.  Morrie was a college professor and taught a class on The Meaning of Life.  One of his most promising students was Mitch Albom, the author of this novel.  After Mitch found out about Morrie's diagnosis, they became very close.  Mitch started to meet with Morrie every Tuesday.  Each Tuesday they would talk about the different aspects of life.  The last Tuesday before Morrie died, they talked about death.  Not many people take death into consideration and ignore it throughout their lives.  Death is a very hard concept to accept and very hard to understand.  Children should talk about death to their parents/guardians for them to get a better understanding.        I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who has a fear of death and would like to get over it quickly.  It is a wonderful book because it discusses all the questions you could have about life in general.  The author's description of Morrie and how he expresses a person's feelings who is in the middle of life and death is truly remarkable.  This novel depicts how a young man and an old man discuss life's greatest lessons.
B00003CX8I|3.0|The X-Men (if you are one of the half dozen or so people who don't already know) are a band of super-powered mutants who appear monthly in a number of titles published by Marvel Comics.  In comparison to many previous made for TV failures and direct to video flops this first major motion picture adaptation of Marvel Comics' characters was very impressive visually and had some nice moments of dialogue as well.<br /><br />The premise of the story (both in the comics and the movie) is that occasionally, in defiance of the normally slow process of evolution, someone is born with a bizarre genetic mutation that gives them powers far beyond those of \\"normal\\" humans.  These mutants have become the latest in a long series of societal pariahs, feared and hated by an increasingly large segment of the general population.  In the face of persecution from a Joe McCarthy-like Senator, the world's most powerful telepath, Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), has set up a special school to help young mutants come to terms with their strange abilities and use them to convince the world that they are not a threat.  His graduate band of do-gooders include telekinetic prodigy Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), optic beam firing Cyclops (James Marsden), and weather controlling Storm (Halle Berry).  To this group are soon added two newcomers: Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is equipped with animal-keen senses and reflexes, the ability to heal wounds nearly instantaneously, and a skeleton and claws made of an indestructible metal.  Teenaged Rogue (Anna Paquin) is cursed by a touch that drains the life-force of anyone whose bare skin contacts hers.<br /><br />Along with a hostile public, the X-Men deal with another band of mutants, lead by the master of magnetism, Magneto (Ian McKellen), that is intent on permanently eliminating the threat posed by the prejudice of normal humans.  Magneto's troops include the feral berserker Sabretooth (Tyler Mane); the leaping, prehensile tongue shooting Toad (Ray Park); and the shapeshifting Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos).<br /><br />The best part of this movie, in my opinion, is Hugh Jackman's portrayal of Wolverine, which totally captures the spirit (if not the letter) of the comic book character.  Other highpoints include the opening scene that explains Magneto's mistrust of humans, the interaction between former friends turned enemies Xavier and Magneto, the friendly rivalry between Wolverine and Cyclops, the confrontation between Magneto and the police outside a train station, and the fight scene between Wolverine and Mystique.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the story was not as gripping as it could have been and, with the exception of Anna Paquin's Rogue, all the female characters were given very little screen presence.  Jean Grey and Storm are two of the most powerful mutants in the comic book series, but in the movie they mostly stand around looking pretty and end up getting beaten up and/or having to be rescued. (Of course, what can you expect from a group that calls itself the \\"X-MEN\\" even though half its members are women?)  Even Rebecca Romijn-Stamos' Mystique (in the BROTHERhood of Mutants) only gets one sentence of dialogue in the whole movie.<br /><br />The 10 minutes of additional footage on the VHS (and [[ASIN:B000AYELVA DVD]]) version all add a great deal of characterization to the film, and should never have been cut from the theatrical release.  I only wish that, rather than having them all at the end of the tape, these expurgated scenes had been reinserted into the film.shapeshifting Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos).

B000002B35|5.0|I read complaints about the band releasing this album when the music is already on other albums. YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO THE *OTHER* MELODY!! The band is trying to tell us all something very deep and meaningful. They're highlighting these songs on purpose with a live release, because they hold a hidden meaning for mankind. LOOK AT THE PULSE ALBUM COVER! Part of the message is in the imagry! Listen to the music and the voices, they're talking to GOD, about GOD, and trying to free you from the darkness. LISTEN. PAY ATTENTION. IT'S MAGIC. These are not ordinary men and women, they have become messengers to those with ears to listen!!!<br />Light the darkness.<br />+
B00004WG9G|1.0|I purchased this video thinking it was the Peter O'Toole/Sophia Loren movie of the same title.  It turned out to be a poor quality animation that had very little redeeming value (even for kids).  Do yourself a favor....skip this one.
B000001FDK|5.0|Grease is one of those guilty pleasures in life.  There is no substantial music here, but it's just plain old fun to listen to.  Try not singing along to songs like &quot;Summer Nights&quot;, &quot;You're The One That I Want&quot; or &quot;Greased Lightnin'&quot;.  The title track is a great combination of doo-wop and disco and &quot;Beauty School Drop Out&quot; is campy fun.  All in all, Grease is fun stuff.
B000002G60|5.0|nine objects of desire is a humorous, deep, and simple album. vega's lyrics are descriptive but concise, a perfect balance for her musical style. in this album her music crosses the genres of rock, folk, and bossa nova, making for an unusual experience. her thematic choices are unique and empathetic. the overall theme being desire, she talks of death, gambling, homosexuality, marriage, and wanting to eat a plum (my personal favorite). her quiet, thoughtful songs are a fantastic choice for those who like artists like tori amos, jewel, and pj harvey.<br />my favorite songs are &quot;casual match&quot;, &quot;stockings&quot;, &quot;no cheap thrill&quot;, and &quot;my favorite plum&quot;. enjoy!
0465068359|5.0|It is unbelievable how some Japanese continue to deny the truth. First off-this book is not about the Japanese language or the Japanese culture-it is about the atrocities that Japanese troops committed on the Chinese citizens of Nanjing. Those that deny it so admently only go to show how guilty they really are. They should understand that this book was not published specifically  to put-down or slander the Japanese people and their culture, but simply to open the eyes of general population to the darker points in history that have always been shadowed (I say specifically, because there is no way Mrs. Chang could write this book without some bias). EVERY country has her darker past and the rape of Nanjing is Japan's. History has the right to be known.  This is the first book that introduces the Western civilization to the in the East. It is about time ignorance is dispersed.
6303029027|5.0|This movie is everything you can expect. The story is about a young buy who idolizes a gang member, which toments his old man.Not only is a a good character study, it tells a good tale of Italian thug life in New York City.
B00001OH7U|5.0|David Bowie's Station To Station was the follow up to the r&amp;b flavored Young Americans.  The album moved away from those sounds towards the more progressive and experimental sounds that set the stage for his Berlin trilogy.  The album opens with the brilliant title track that introduced his Thin White Duke persona.  The song has a futuristic sound and is a great work.  &quot;Golden Years&quot; is a shimmering, looping song hat hit number ten on the charts.  &quot;TVC 15&quot; is a fun tale about technology and love while &quot;Stay&quot; has beautifully tortured vocal.  The album peaked at number three on the charts and was his last top ten album until 1983's Let's Dance.
B00004XONN|5.0|This album is very unconventional.  At first I didnt like it but now its one of my favorites.  And no, Radiohead arent copying U2, just because Thom Yorke sings a bit like Bono doesnt mean he is copying him.  There is less singing on this album than other Radiohead albums but the band (not just Thom) really shines.
0345347951|4.0|The synopsis above says that the overlords start eliminating humans, which is utter tripe. I apologise for the plot spoiler, but it's worse to have a wrong spoiler like that above.<br />Anyway, rant over. The story starts off almost exactly like the film Independence Day - huge ships appear and hover over Earth. But the continuation is very different. The Overlords are definitely hiding something, but it's not clear what. Don't worry, all is revealed over the course of this readable, short, and engrossing book.<br />There are two things to like about this book. The first is how prophetic it is. It was written in 1953, but foresees the pill, and DNA testing, and universal surveillance, and holograms, among other things. One prophecy that has not come true, but might, is that as people become richer, they become lazier, especially mentally, and watch TV the whole time. At one point, Clarke says, in shocked tones, that people are watching three hours of TV a day!<br />The second thing to like about this book is the way that it manages to tell the story of the relationship between the human race, and the Overlords, through individual stories, rather than through a history-book like relating of the facts. There is not a lot of character development, but you get to identify with the players.<br />The way the story developed was surprising, and it's surprising how original it felt. I would have thought that someone would have ripped it off by now. Maybe the later generation of sci-fi writers don't read the classics. Anyway, you won't get the feeling that you have read this book before, which is quite common for me with these sci-fi and fantasy books.
B000056VIY|2.0|JLO I must admit may not have the best type of vocals for the music in her latest cd, but one must admit that her singing isn't all that bad. I do believe though, with more pratice in strengthening her vocals, she might just come back next time with a more powerful voice. She carries her tunes well. Unfortunetly, I only liked the single (#1 on the cd), the rest basically sound the same and that harp music at the beginning is a bit too much. There's one thing I am not in favor of. I bought my 10-yr old the cd. Never in my dreams did I think JLO would stoop to say this in one of the songs: &quot;play my mother f-cken song&quot;. She has a huge impact with the younger listening audience, minus ONE. I've refused to let my kid listen to JLO. Kids are very impressionable, and there's nothing worse then hearing your kid chant, &quot;Mother f_cken&quot;...
0440214041|1.0|After the massive success of The Firm, anticipation was high for John Grisham's follow up, The Pelican Brief.  Unfortunately, The Pelican Brief doesn't come close to matching the high quality of The Firm.  The plot revolves around the assassination of two Supreme Court justices that no one can figure out the motives behind.  A young law student, Darby Shaw, comes up with a theory about it and writes a paper detailing her thoughts.  It turns out to be more accurate than anyone thinks.  Her boyfriend is one of her professors and he is killed in a car bombing.  She fears for her live and ends up with a Washington Post reporter, Gray Grantham.  They set out to prove Darby's theory.  The book is a fast read, but the plot is so far fetched and unbelievable that you find yourself shaking your head at it instead of being taken in by it.  Mr. Grisham was obviously trying to capitalize on The Firm's success, but The Pelican Brief has the feel of being too forced and knocked off without much thought.
B000053GTE|5.0|My biggest complaint in terms of music videos is that there are not enough compilations available.  Being a big Celine Dion fan, I was incredibly excited to hear this video was being released. This video, which spans her incredible career, is one of the best, if not the best collection of music videos ever released. Included in this video is the the &quot;Ballad of the '90's&quot;- My Heart Will Go On, from the blockbuster film &quot;Titanic&quot;.  Her duet with Frank Sinatra, &quot;All The Way&quot; from the 1999 CBS special is still superb, as well as bringing back some great memories.  My favorite song on this video is her latest, &quot;That's The Way It Is&quot;, which displays her terrific range.  This video is a must have for any Celine Dion fans.
0440211727|4.0|A Time To Kill is the debut novel of the mega selling author John Grisham.  Setting the basis of much of his future works, the book follows the story of a young Southern lawyer who has seemingly insurmountable odds stacked against him.  Jake Brigance is the lawyer who represents Carl Lee Hailey in the small Mississippi town of Clanton.  Carl's young daughter is viciously raped by a couple of rednecks.  The rednecks are on trial, but Carl takes matters into his own hands and kills them.  Carl is black and this incident has split the town along racial lines.  Was is justifiable homicide or premeditated murder?  Should he get the death penalty or be acquitted?  Grisham is a lawyer so his intimate understanding of the way a lawyer approaches a case and how a trial unfolds is letter perfect.  The book is a quick and easy read and highly enjoyable.
6302054982|5.0|This is by far the best of the awesome Robert de Niro films, the best collaboration between De Niro and Scorcese, and the best film of the last 25 years. Hell, the best film ever made, lets call it what it is! Great.
0385484518|4.0|Mitch Albom was well known to sports fans for his insightful writing in the Detroit Free Press and for his appearances on ESPN's Sports Reporters.  He had written several books on sports (including an excellent book on Michigan's Fab Five) that were not best sellers.  So when he published this small book about becoming reacquainted with a former mentor who was dying of Lou Gehrig's disease, no one expected much from it.  What has happened is that the book has become a cultural landmark.  The book has spent over three years on The New York Times Best Seller list, has been made into an Emmy award winning TV movie starring Jack Lemmon and made Mr. Albom into a star who has his radio show simulcasted on MSNBC and a development deal with CBS.  The book details how through his death, Morrie Schwartz taught Mr. Albom how to live.  Mr. Albom had seen his old professor on Nightline and decided to visit him.  He was wrapped up in his own life and felt ashamed and nervous around the dying Morrie.  In course of their initial meeting, they decide they would meet every Tuesday in what would be the last class Mr. Schwartz would teach.  Mr. Schwartz explains that dying people don't want pity, but dignity and that death is a natural part of life.  The lessons he teaches are somewhat depressing, but they do help one appreciate life.  The book is very easy to read and Mr. Albom has an inviting style of writing.  He lets us into his life and his relationship with Mr. Schwartz and through the book you can feel the genuine respect and love they had for each other.  Mr. Albom wrote the book as a true labor of love and as a testament to his friend.
B000051S3H|5.0|This version of Jane Eyre is marked by good performances, and a great music score by John Williams. If it had been longer, I think it might have been the definitive version, but at under 2 hours, it cannot come close to the Timothy Dalton BBC version which was several hours long, took dialogue straight out of the book in most scenes, etc. But George C. Scott was a more realistic Rochester. Timothy Dalton acted well, but was far too pretty, and Rochester was supposed to be a rather ugly man physically, to match Jane's plainess. Susannah York had the right sweetness to play Jane, but again far too beautiful. I haven't seen a real plain Jane yet in any filmed version, except for the William Hurt version, which I actively disliked. (Worst was the A&amp;E version, I threw pillows at my tv screen, it was so bad).
0451167716|5.0|Mario Puzo's The Godfather started America's fascination with the Mafia.  Prior to the book, most people didn't know about this subculture.  We knew about gangsters like Al Capone and the like, but not about the families. As we all know, The Godfather is about the Corleone family lead by the Don Vito Corleone.  The book follows the path of The Godfather Saga movie which combines the two movies in a more chronological pattern. If you've seen the movies, you can see that they follow the book quite closely.  Most of what happens in the movies unfolds in the book.  The difference between the two is that the book fleshes out lesser characters like Luca Brassi and explains situations like how Michael gets back to America from Italy that due to time constraints, the movie can't into.  If you loved the movies, then you'll love the book.
B000053GTF|5.0|Celine Dion has graced the music industry for over ten years now. She has managed to reach the top of Billboard's Hot 100 Singles Chart in four occasions, and four of her albums have reached #1 on the Billboard 200. Celine has already sold more than 120 million albums and singles worldwide, won Grammy Awards, sang at the Academy Awards five times... the list could go on and on. There were just two things missing but fortunately they have already occurred. She just gave birth to her first child, and a very long-awaited video collection has been issued. &quot;All The Way... A Decade Of Song And Video&quot; presents her biggest hits plus the six new recordings on the companion CD. I think the videos are awesome, but I would make the following changes: Instead of including two versions of &quot;It's All Coming Back To Me Now,&quot; I would have put there one of her best videos that people never really had the chance to enjoy, such as &quot;Water From The Moon.&quot; I actually saw that video once, on Entertainment Tonight, the night before the Grammy Awards in 1993. I would love to get it. Also, I would have included the original video for &quot;Because You Loved Me,&quot; which includes footage from the movie &quot;Up Close &amp; Personal.&quot; Also, I would have decided to include the original version of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; with Peabo Bryson. Well, there are several other Celine Dion videos out there, including rare performances (think &quot;I Finally Found Someone,&quot; the song she sang at the 1997 Academy Awards). Let's keep our fingers crossed for Sony Music to ultimately release these gems. In the meantime, let's enjoy this DVD and VHS.
B00000634J|3.0|I would take issue with this being the very best of John Lennon. In fact, there were easily half a dozen songs that this album could have done without. I also noticed the hit song, &quot;I'm losing you&quot; was missing from the album. On a positive note, I was thoroughly refreshed hearing his beautiful lyrics, longing for peace, love, unity, and for a better world. I felt enlightened by the songs, imagine, instant karma, #9 dream, love, happy xmas, watching the wheels and so on. It is an inspiration for me to hear a man of such musical genius, sing songs that speaks to the hearts of many, including mine. It can really change the world!
B00003XACV|5.0|Wahoo! Thomas Newman just won the 2001 Grammy Award for this score for the category of Best Score Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or other Visual Media! I have owned this CD since January of 2000, and I still listen to it almost daily. It never seizes to amaze me. My concept of it often changes, as I repeatedly find new &quot;hidden&quot; musical messages within it. While it didn't win the Oscar last year (it should have!), this Grammy win ALMOST makes up for that. Plastic bags will forever more be meaningful.
1878424319|5.0|The Four Agreements will help you do just that. I make my living as a prosperity coach, and this book is the best I've found on the subject. ANYONE can create a life they truly love, and everybody should! This is a book full of very powerful, very wise teachings.<br />Ruiz makes the agreements simple to understand and adds an element of the mystical that makes the book hard to put down. He also incorporates the teachings of several religions, making the book applicable to people of all faiths. This is a definite must-read!
B00003CXHJ|4.0|A very entertaining movie that is only made better seeing on DVD. The sound quality enhances the scenes with the depth charges so much it is unbelievable. Great cast, well written and a gutsy movie. Also love the short hair on Bon Jovi, you could barely recognize him. Much like the Matrix and Gladiator, this is a must for anyone how loves thier DVD player and loves movies. The extra stuff is also a great bonus.
B000056HOZ|2.0|Although Springsteen fans doubtless won't care, this DVD was a big disappointment from a technical standpoint.  The video is not especially sharp and suffers from many problems of live concert footage such as poor camera angles and lighting.  Be aware also that this DVD is not in widescreen format.  Likewise the sound quality was not up to my expectations - the surround sound aspect was limited and the clarity of the recording was far below any studio albums.
B000002UB3|5.0|It's difficult to explain in words how Abbey Road affects you.  This album creates feelings of uplifting joy, heart-wrenching sorrow, and of shocking power.  Corny, perhaps, but it's so true.  The Beatles are incredible, and this album is one of their best.  Do yourself a favor and buy this; you won't regret it.
B000056N8X|1.0|Although I am a big fan of the Highlander series, this movie was aweful.  There was no character development.  Characters die and you could care less.  I think they needed to do ALOT of rewriting - didn't - and rushed this to the screen.  It was a waste of money and was a huge disappointment - I was waiting a long time for this movie to come out.  I think they owed it to their fans to have created a better movie than this.
B00005214X|5.0|This is one of the best multiple side albums of all-time, not to mention the greatest album of the former Beatles after they broke up (IMHO).  The first four sides of the original album was often played by &quot;Album-Oriented-Rock&quot; stations (AOR) back in the 1970s, back before FM became so commercial (all of you kiddies born after 1970 don't know what I'm talking about).  A definitive classic.  Old George saved his best after the Beatles broke up.  <br />Great music.  Great artists.  Enough said.  If you don't buy it, you are missing on some great music.
B000056N8X|3.0|First off, I'm a big Highlander fan. I've always loved the first movie..thought two was cheezy and should be destroyed, rather liked 3 even though it seems alot of others didn't. I even tend to like the series (though I will admit I think Duncan is a pansy). I was rather disappointed with this last movie though. I had hoped for a little more from Connor, and while some people said there were to many flashbacks, personally I thought they were the best things about this movie. The whole point was that you fight to the prize, the last two fight..then there's only one. Ok, Connor did that....TWICE. Now suddenly there's a whole new generation of immortals, and Connor's still around. Personally I think that if they wanted to continue, they should have left Connor out of it and instead of killing him, turned him into some kind of a legend that no one knows what happened to him. Just that once he lived and won. Don't get me wrong, I love Conner..but he deserved much better than just to die. The plot was terrible, but the fight scenes were rather good. I would have liked to see more Methos, but you can't have everything you want.<br />Normally I wouldn't buy a movie quite this bad. But I did buy it, for the same reason I bought a copy of Star Trek Generations...one should always have the ending of a legend...<br />There can be only one....
B00004ZAV3|5.0|The CD contains all no. 1 hits done by the world's no. 1 group. It's true that they are not the best 27 songs done by them, but certainly a memorable collection. No doubt that all the songs are atleast good. I like &quot;I wanna hold your hand&quot; so much.Only Problem seems to be everybody has listen these songs so many times, but listen one more time, you will say you still like these songs. I bought this CD without listening only 2 songs (&quot;eight days a week&quot;, &quot;penny lane&quot;). The rest I have listened (more or less) 40 times each, but when i started listening, it was the same old (Beatles) magic. They were such an easylistening group, that's why everybody loves them, starting from one who listens AC/DC to one who listens MC Hammer. Another plus point of this CD is its sleeve designing, it has pretty good color combination.
B00004TLMC|5.0|Aesthetically, this is the most beautiful film I have experienced till now. »Eyes Wide Shut« is simply a delight for your eye - but as much for your mind. 'Cause the story comes around every dark corner of the human sexuality, without ever becoming moralizing flattening or going into klichés.<br />Tom Cruise was criticized for his acting in the film, and Nicole Kidman was highly praised. Strange. 'Cause Cruise plays the only real leading act - we follow him through nearly the entire film - and he does it brilliantly.<br />A beautiful, marvellous film. One of the very best in years!!<br />The short story that inspired the film, »A Dream Novel« by Arthur Schnitzler, as well as the soundtrack are highly recommendable as well.
6305268843|5.0|I saw this movie on TV and was so impressed with it that I had to rent the video to watch it over again.  I think Sophie Marceau is a unique beauty.  In this movie, she has so many different expressions (happy, sad, feeling pain) but yet looked beautiful in her own unique way.  I love the part when she tried to shout while facing the sea.  Stephen Dillane is one of my favourite actors now after this movie.  His acting was excellent.  He is handsome in his own way.  Definitely charmed me!
0451160916|5.0|'The Shining' is one of the earlier works by Stephen King. His expressive use of imagery and suspense are at their finest in this book and you get sucked into this story from the very first page.  Character development is superb...you get attached to all the characters from the start.  You experience a wide array of emotions as you watch Jack spiral down into a dark place that you realize he will never get back out of, yet somehow you completely empathize with this character as he struggles with his demons.  <br />This novel was one of the first that explored alcoholism and child abuse in this generation and King, as usual is a master of suspense and horror, managing to infuse both with a truly imaginative and intriguing storyline.  <br />I highly recommend this book.  If you are not familiar with Stephen King, check him out.  His writing style is exceptional, both visual and poetic.  If you are familiar with King only by reading his more recent works, you are seriously cheating yourself, give his older works a try... believe me you won't be disappointed.
B000002ADT|5.0|Great album in every regard.  Davis is at his best and most introspective on this disk, using the space between the notes for maximum effect.  In the recording studio with Miles was one of the best line-ups imaginable: John Coltrane (tenor), Bill Evans (piano), Wynton Kelly (piano), and Paul Chambers (bass).  This CD includes a nice bonus: an alternate take of &quot;Flamenco Sketches&quot;.
B00003CXHJ|4.0|There are a lot of critics who rightly point out the historical inaccuracies of this story, but let us not lose perspective...this was good entertainment. I liked the story, I liked the photography, and yes I liked the explosions and the effects. It kept me and my family entertained and that's a key element.  Obvious comparisons to Das Boot by many reviewers missed the point that this is essentially a very different film. Das Boot was made in the same genre as &quot;all quiet on the western front&quot;: an unglamorous and somber warning of the misery of war. This is a fictional tale based upon real life events, ( just like many other works of fiction) and it's pretty well done. Try it - you'll like it
B000002U82|5.0|There really is nothing left to be said about this album.  In 547 reviews, I think it's all been covered.  This is the finest rock album to ever grace the world.  I've only had it for a few years now, but in that time, I have turned over 20 other people on to Pink Floyd just from this CD alone.  Powerful stuff.<br />Everything works here, there is not one second of bad music.  Roger Waters is a true genius, his lyrics are top-notch, and they would only continue to get better on latter Floyd albums.  Nick Mason's drumming is actually pretty damn good on Dark Side.  I think he deserves a little more credit than the &quot;Playboy Drummer&quot;.  Rick Wright's contributions to this record are quite good, and his synthesizers are incredible.  But say what you will, I truly believe the real success of Pink Floyd came with Dave Gilmour.  He is the whole package.  Not only is his guitar playing Godlike, he can just flat out sing.  Gilmour's solos on &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Money&quot; might very well be the most incredible sounds I have ever heard.<br />From Track 1 to Track 9, this album never disappoints.  As said before, it is the ultimate... CD.  I just feel damn good after listening, like I've experienced something that I didn't deserve.  It's like this each time.... Dark Side is still incredible to listen to.  There are so many different sounds going on that it is the perfect CD to use on a high-tech stereo system with the lights off.<br />Finally I'd like to point out that no matter what anyone says, this is the greatest Pink Floyd album EVER.  Even though I like Animals and The Wall just as much as this, thoseare not Pink Floyd albums....<br />Just buy it if you haven't already.  Do you really have a choice?

B000023VR6|5.0|This is a very nice collection. I don't know if it is better than The Chronic but it is very good. It has a lot of good guest appearences and Dre still holds his own with the best of them. My favorite songs are The Watcher, Xxplosive, Next Episode, Big Egos, Let's Get High, and Housewife. Overall, this is one of my favorite cds by one of my favorite artists and I suggest that you go and buy it.
0783211856|5.0|Meet Oskar Schindler. A German living in occupied Poland during World War II. A member in good standing of the Nazi party. A womanizer, a war profiteer...and ultimately a man of conscience. A man who became one of the great unsung heroes and humanitarians of the war.<br /><br />\\"Schindler's List\\" chronicles Oskar Schindler's spiritual odyssey from war profiteer to humanitarian and hero.  Winner of seven Academy Awards® in 1993, including Best Picture, this  harrowing and heart-rending film is Steven Spielberg's masterpiece, and perhaps one of the finest and most important movies ever made.  It depicts Schindler's ultimately successful attempt to rescue 1,100 Jews from Hitler's \\"Final Solution\\" by getting them to safety outside Poland.<br /><br />Dynamic performances abound in this beautiful movie,  Especially noteworthy are Liam Neeson as the suave Schindler, Ralph Fiennes as the monstrously depraved Nazi colonel, Amon Goeth, and Ben Kingsley as the dignified, principled Jewish prisoner Itzhak Stern.<br /><br />\\"Schindler's List\\" is definitely not light entertainment!  This beautiful movie allows viewers to feel like they're actually a part of one of the darkest, most horrific periods in history. (I'm sure this is the reason the film was shot in black-and-white, with only minor \\"colorized\\" bits included.)  The story of the Holocaust needs to be told over and over again, in hopes  that future generations can understand the horrors perpetrated on an entire race of people and prevent future occurrences.  \\"Schindler's List\\" is perhaps one of the best and most effective vehicles for telling that story I've ever experienced.
B00000163G|5.0|This album is even better than the hype. Being the first hip-hop double cd, it is also one of the best. It is almost as good as Greatest Hits, but not quite. I cannot say that I have a select few of favorite songs on this album because it is so balanced that this is nearly impossible to do. One of the cds does not dominate the other. A lot of times this happens with other double cd but this is not the case. If you would have to get only one cd in you life, picking this one would be a pretty good choice.
B00005A3KS|5.0|I have been waiting to buy this film since I bought my DVD player, and started using Amazon. One of the greatest action flims, combinging surfing, skydiving, high speed chases, Awesome! How big was that wave?
0312119038|5.0|Karen Armstrong entered a convent as a teenager in the 60's. While all the tumult of the sexual revolution, the Cold War, the Vietnam War seethed in the outside world, Karen was struggling with her difficult and almost medieval novitiate, her classes at Oxford, where her training as a nun conflicted with the scholastic world, and with her health. While Karen sought to cool the passions and desires of the world and become the perfect nun, her body rebelled and she suffered anorexia, fainting fits which were attributed to her emotions (but were diagnosed as epilepsy much later on.) Meanwhile, she achieved scholastic triumphs at Oxford, but at heavy price.<br />How Karen adjusts to live in the convent, and then to life at Oxford is an amazing story. Her autobiography is unsentimental and honest. This is a fascinating personal story as well as a rare look into a secret world that was forever altered by Vatican II and its reforms.
B00004U2A1|5.0|First off, before I start my review of the DVD, I would like to add that Evil Dead 2 is NOT a remake.  Renaissance Pictures couldn't get footage of Evil Dead from New Line, so Raimi simply re-shot some flashback footage, quickly summarizing Evil Dead.  Ok, now Evil Dead 2 starts right where Evil Dead left off.  The morning drives the evil spirits out of Ash, but that doesn't mean that they will come back!  <br />Ok, now for the DVD.  Quite possibly the greatest horror film of all time, this is the only DVD version that matters!  Evil Dead 2 has been re-released in an excellent Limited Edition tin case set.  Numbered out of 50,000 copies, Evil Dead 2 Limited is loaded with extra features.  The disc contains widescreen and fullscreen versions of the film, which are both excellent transfers, and the soundtrack is amazingly remixed in Dolby 5.1. Now onto the extras.  First up is one of the greatest commentaries of all time, it includes Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell, Scott Speigel, and Greg Nicotero.  Next up is The Gore the Merrier featurette.  It runs about a half hour long, and is very informative with behind-the-scenes footage, and great details about the special effects.  We then get a trailer, a videogame preview, talent bios, still galleries, a poster replica, and a nice 48-page booklet.  Get this DVD now!!!  It is rare, and will be out of print soon!
B00004Y6NW|5.0|If you're thinking of buying a Dire Straits greatest hits album, forget about it.  This is not a greatest hits type of group.  The only way to really understand fully what this great band and their great guitarist, Mark Knopler is all about, is to purchase their individual albums.  This is the place to start.  Sultans of Swing is a prime example of the effortless ease that Knopler is known for.  I play a little guitar myself, and believe me, Knopler makes it sound so easy but it really isn't.  His fingerpicking technique is astonishing.  But he is equally adept at jazz riffs, rock, classical, country picking.  He is a master! This is one of the great debuts of all time.  Every cut is wonderful listening!  It is the place to start, then collect them all, but stay away from greatest hits packages, because you won''t capture the full atmosphere or depth of this great band.
B000056N8X|4.0|This movie was a pretty good movie. UPS:Good battle scenes,good acting and decent specia; effects DOWNS:Plot is only mediocre,dialouge is semi cheesy.
B000056VIY|4.0|Jennifer Lopez' follow-up to &quot;On the 6&quot; is awesome.  It totally rocks.  I liked &quot;On The 6&quot;, but I didn't buy it, I guess I was afraid I wouldn't like the songs I didn't hear on the radio.  But &quot;J.Lo&quot; sounds great and it was number one and all.  It takes talent to pull off a number one album and song and movie and Jennifer Lopez makes it all look so easy.  Her voice isn't powerful or mind-blowing, but she knows what she can and cannot do.  In none of her songs does she go out of her vocal range.  She's got a mellow, smooth voice and she knows it.  She's not gonna go out and sing a Mariah Carey song.  The beats in &quot;J.Lo&quot; are totally awesome.  I especially love &quot;Ain't It Funny&quot;, it has a spanish flava, and a dancey beat.  As for you haters who feel obligated to compare celebrities to each other, don't even try to say that Jennifer Lopez is just a &quot;spanish Madonna&quot;.  Given Jennifer Lopez shows off her body (and she does have a great bod, might I add), but she isn't a &quot;Madonna&quot;.  That's the thing with Jennifer Lopez, she doesn't try to be anyone else.  Her music is totally original.  Usually I can think of some other singers out there who can sing a song better than the artist who sings it.  But with Jennifer Lopez, her songs fit her voice perfectly.  Jennifer Lopez: established actress, successful singer and divine dancer.  She is the total package.  Madonna:  so so singer, terrible actress and a meager dancer.  J.Lo could mop the floor with Madonna.  Hey Haters, if &quot;J.Lo&quot; is so terrible, then why the heck is it number one?  How is it that &quot;Love Don't Cost A Thing&quot; went to number one?  Apparently there are a lot of people out there who can appreciate good music, and not just hate someone because they're jealous.  If you think Jennifer Lopez is so bad, then try getting yourself a record deal, and release an album.  She may make it look so easy, but its not.  I commend Miss Lopez onher incredible success and hope to never stop hearing her sing.
B000002IV8|5.0|This album with the exception of W.F.O has got to be one of the greatest albums ever made.  For a band with such amazing talent and musical skill, it is truly sad wider recognition is not evident more publicly.  SHADES OF GREY, WEIGHT OF THE WORLD, IGNORANCE &amp; INNOCENCE should all be heard by everyone at least once.  Amazing lyrics, and killer musical prowess make this album a certain &quot;MUST HAVE&quot;.
B00003W8NM|5.0|I keep wondering about each word of this movie. I ask myself why it is that we dont act as the movie tells us. I do think we are bored, ok right maybe u do have a life and family. But there is a point where u kind of loose touch with living life. Maybe i mean something in the line of this movie. Well i suggest you to watch it and listen to Durden words of wisdom... it does leave you to think: did u do the right choice in your lifetime? If you have any thoughts u can mail me a line kai_von_zei@yahoo.com
630407185X|5.0|This film represents a great opportunity to see European actors not often seen in Hollywood-type films.  It is worth having just to see the amazing charisma of Dirk Bogarde, Edward Fox, Maximilian Schell and, above all, the incredible face of Hardy Kruger.  These are actors with which many of us are not familiar enough.
B00004Z459|5.0|Plain and Simple, this is one of the best new cds out there.  Not since Incubus Make Yourself have i bought a cd that is awesome the whole way through.  This will not dissapoint.  My favorite song would have to &quot;In The End&quot;, but like i said every song is great, even a nice dj mix on track 11. If you don't have this cd, do yourself a favor and get it now.
B000056N8X|5.0|I would like to thank the producers Davis and Panzer for this DVD.  There were so many things improved over the theatrical release!  I recommend this to anybody who likes action, sci-fi, and a good movie.  Thank you Davis-Panzer!!!!!!!!
0800141385|5.0|The film of &quot;Funny Girl&quot; was awaited with much anticipation after all the tremendous publicity given to Barbra Streisand following her stunning portrayal of Fanny Brice in the hit Broadway show. Streisand won the Best Actress Oscar for her role in the film (but had to share the award with Katharine Hepburn).<br />The young Fanny Brice (Barbra Streisand) desperately wants to be a success in show business and after a shaky start thinks she has made it when she lands a part in a big Ziegfeld show. Ziegfeld (Walter Pidgeon) and Fanny clash over various matters connected with the show due to her strong personality but her talent shines through and she eventually becomes a major star. She meets gambler Nicky Arnstein (Omar Sharif) and falls madly in love with him. Unfortunately, his gambling habits get him in trouble with the police causing Fanny much sadness and anguish. However, she manages to overcome these problems to concentrate on her career and becomes a big Broadway star.<br />The film was directed by the legendary William Wyler and produced by Ray Stark (who was in fact Fanny Brice's son-in-law!). The film had a superior supporting cast including Kay Medford (repeating her Broadway role as Rose Brice), Anne Francis (Georgia James), Lee Allen (Eddie Ryan), Gerald Mohr (Branca), and Frank Faylen as Keeney.<br />Some favourite lines from the film:<br />Barbra Streisand (to her reflection in theatre mirror): &quot;Hello, gorgeous&quot;.<br />Lee Allen (to Streisand): &quot;Are you sure you can rollerskate?&quot;. Streisand: &quot;Can I rollerskate?&quot;.<br />Streisand (to Walter Pidgeon): &quot;O.K. you win. You don't win fair but you win!&quot;.<br />Due to the success of &quot;Funny Girl&quot; a sequel was made (in 1975) called &quot;Funny Lady&quot; with Streisand again and James Caan as Billy Rose.  Omar Sharif also returned in a cameo role but the sequel was not as popular as the original. &quot;Funny Girl&quot; was one of those rare occasions when the perfect part came along with the perfect actress to play it. One of the last of the great Hollywood musicals. Clive Roberts.he perfect part came along with the perfect actress to play it. One of the last of the great Hollywood musicals. Clive Roberts.
B00004X0Q0|4.0|Not being a fan of most of the new metal being out today, I was somewhat skeptical upon purchasing this album. I had heard &quot;One Armed Scissor&quot; on the radio and I enjoyed it. The rest of the album is just as good. It's a chaotic blend of sound that rivets me to my seat everytime I put it in the CD player. The music is filled with atmosphere and the piano parts lend to it that much more. It's catchy and quirky and I'm definitely delighted I picked it up.
0140437312|5.0|one of those books i never got around to reading but last week it became the one i could not put down . i just love the old mr fairlie he has such classic lines and reminded me of the simpsons mr burns ..well do i look like i need bothering ..so why bother me . I should have been studying ,so what some of us never grow up.
B00003W8NM|5.0|David Fincher's explosive movie draws the viewer in as if he's sucking venom from a snake bite. Never before has a film so sucessfully captured the zeitgeist of an era. With it's constantly evolving narrative, Fight Club throws more punches than you can keep up with. A left hook here, a right jab there and before you know it, you're begging for mercy.<br />The real secret to Fight Club's success is the way in which the viewer is so shamelessly manipulated into seeing Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) as the everyman hero of the underdog. However, just as you're cheering and applauding Tyler's philosophy on life, you suddenly become aware that the movie has taken a dark turn and perhaps Tyler may be more than a little dangerous. Everyman hero? Or mentally unstable Anarchist. Despite his ruthless honesty and genuine belief that the world can be a better place if we all just learn to let go of the excessive garbage we each carry around, physically, emotionally and spiritually, there comes a point in the movie where Tyler sheds his skin and becomes about as heroic as Timothy McVey (The Oklahoma Bomber). A disturbing thought to imagine anyone ever cheering and applauding his behavior and view of the world!<br />Director David Fincher has created a movie that treats film making as a blood drenched contact sport. Right from the opening scene Fincher grabs the viewer by the throat and doesn't let go for a second. Watching Fight Club is the cinematic equivalent of riding the biggest, scariest rollercoaster 20 times in a row without stopping even once. The dialogue flows like machine gun fire. The editing skips and jumps in perfect synchronicity to the pulses and beats of the techno driven sountrack, and the flawless cinematography and production design combine to create a vision that seems plucked from the dark and twisted imagination of HR Giger. In short Fight Club is work of genius. Watch it... if you think you can take a beating.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|From the first days of 1964, just waiting for the first appearance of the Beatles on US television, that electricity has never diminished for anyone who ever loved them! To hear I Want To Hold Your Hand today still sends a shiver through the spine and the listener recalls waiting for every week's Top 40 publication....  There they were, with 8 of the top 10 on the charts and you only had to switch from station to station on the car radio to catch one of the Beatles' hits.... And now it's on a CD-- no more AM signals lost.... The Beatles are still NO. 1-- and the times stand still to listen!
0783221487|1.0|Who decided to make this? This is nothing like the 6 hour version on DVD, and The Baron looks horrifying! Just a bad movie. Can anyone tell me why Sting was in the film? ECH! Anything with Sting in it will probably be bad.
6305095574|5.0|I love this movie. It has everything. There's tons of gore, knockout gut- wrenching zombie mutilatiation, demonic- evil sprit possesion material to go around and come back for seconds. I watched it twice when I rented it. I advise you DON&quot;T LISTEN TO THE RATING AMAZON.COM GAVE THIS MOVIE&gt; IT IS NOT NC-17! IT&quot;S NOT EVEN RATED. Movies like this shouldn't be rated because they are so outrageously violent and gory that in the end, it doesn't matter what it's rated because it's just a horror movie and succeeds as just that. It was released in 1981, but don't be fooled. You'd never guess it was made 20+ years ago. It is a classic in the horror world. The filming is great. If you watch this and THE SIXTH SENSE and you'll see some strong resemblences between the two and the way they were filmed. The fact that this movie doesn't have much of a plot doesn't affect the quality of the movie. This movie is awesome. Rent it or buy it today if you are true to the horror genre.<br />(This movie contains strong gore violence, brief breast exposure(nudity), and very mild language. Not suitable for those under the age of twelve.)
B000053SPI|5.0|Thanks to the review that pointed me at the Japan release. Wonderful CD. All 14 tracks are great.
B00000AFFF|5.0|I've listened to this CD again and again -- and never grow tired of it. It's great for road trips. Every track is a treat. I'm a singer and (for my own pleasure) a piano player -- I can't think of another recent CD that sent me online looking for sheet music. The arrangements are recognizably Bacharach, and the quirky lyrics, vintage Costello. The simplicity and honesty of EC's voice lays comfortably into the music. It's nice to hear a vocal that hasn't been produced to high heavens, that bears a satisfying resemblance to the original in the shower. Could these songs have been sung by someone with great vocal strength and range? --- undeniably. Would they have retained their beauty, perhaps not. I love this CD,
B00000FC5H|5.0|Mid-1970s black music seemed dominated either by fun, mindless party jams like &quot;Jungle Boogie&quot; and &quot;Skin Tight,&quot; or dour warnings like &quot;Future Shock&quot; and &quot;Living For The City.&quot; Stevie Wonder sang his share of life-affirming music but Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, here with a definitive one-disc greatest hits, made such positive strength the heart of their musical identity.<br />Some of the era's most needed, heeded messages ran deep and sweet atop Verdine White's bass grooves (front and center on &quot;Getaway&quot;), brother and leader Maurice's drum and percussion tracks  honed over years with Chess Records' rhythm section (&quot;Saturday Nite,&quot; &quot;Kalimba Story,&quot; 1977's dazzling &quot;Serpentine Fire&quot;), Louis Satterfield's horn section scrambling through jazz-rock mazes every track (becoming a 80s rock stalwart backing Phil Collins), and Phillip Bailey's high, clear falsetto on &quot;After The Love Has Gone,&quot; the prom dance standard &quot;Reasons,&quot; the soaring chorus of &quot;September,&quot; and the elegant &quot;Fantasy&quot; which, with &quot;Serpentine Fire,&quot; gave R&amp;B one of its best 1-2 LP opening tracks.

0684833395|5.0|In &quot;Catch-22&quot;, Joseph Heller paints an incredibly ludicrous, and simultaneously realistic, view of one man against the military-industrial complex. His writing style is difficult to get accustomed to, however once the reader starts thinking like Yossarian, every page is a welcome adventure. Joseph Heller weaves his tale with great skill, taking the reader from ironic situations so funny you *will* laugh out loud, to mind-numbing tragedy on the same page. My personal favorite? Colonel Cathcart, and his 'feathers in his cap' and 'black eyes'. I recommend this novel to anyone with a slightly twisted sense of humor, rest assured you will have your eyes opened.
0440180295|4.0|In my opinion, Slaughterhouse-Five was a very thought-provoking book and I enjoyed it very much.  At first the story seemed a little slow, Vonnegut actually devoted the first chapter to tellin ghow he considered the book a failure and how he could not seem to write a book about his experience in Dresden.  he goes to a friend who also cannot recall anything significant about the bombing.  The next chapter seemed to start to pick the book up.  The war is not mentioned until about half way through th chapter and then spastically jumps in and out of Billy's military career.  The is perhaps a message that Vonnegut is trying to get across.  He does not say much about war because war is senseless and there is really nothing to say about it.  Billy seems to be unphased by death when he is in the war.  This is shown when his group is being shot at.  Billy is narrowly missed by a bullet and stands stil in order to give the shooter another chance at hitting him.  If Billy does not see death as a thing to fear he must not htink of war as anything too important.  From Billy's point ov view all the war brings is death.  Even after the bombing of Dresden Billy does not pay attention to the dead bodies he is cleaning up but focuses on other, more obscure details.  FOr instance, Billy said that the best moment of his life was laying on the horse cart under the sun in Dresden.  MOst people could not be able to enjoy any moment in Dresden after the bombing rad with the 135,000 dead people all around.  This unrelenting obliviousness gave Billy a comical aura.  There is much more dark humor such as this spread throught the book.  It's the unique humor that makes this book stand out from the many others I have read
B0000508U6|5.0|This CD is amazing! I have had it for 2 weeks and i can't stop listening to it. The music is so original that I don't even get bored of the lyrics. If you like bands such as The Verve,Blur and Oasis then you will love Coldplay!
B000053SPI|5.0|When I first read that Steve Perry was no longer with the greatest band in the world and replaced by Steve Augeri, I was very disappointed and wondered what would happen to Journey when the &quot;new guy&quot; took over. Well, &quot;Remember Me&quot; didn't do him justice. Then I saw the band live in Chicago in June of '99 and was BLOWN AWAY! This guy can do it all, and then some. Augeri had absolutely nailed all of the old classics, as well as the new one at the time, &quot;Remember Me.&quot; Now, we finally get to hear the guy on 14 new tracks, and they are all absolutely fantastic! The rhythm section is tight, Cain is perfect, Schon gets better with age, and Augeri truly is phenomenal! All 14 tracks are classics. The highlights are &quot;Higher Place,&quot; &quot;Livin' To Do,&quot; &quot;Live and Breathe,&quot; and &quot;To Be Alive Again.&quot; The word on the street is the U.S. release due on April 3rd will have 2 additional songs not on the Japanese import. In the mean time, buy this and enjoy. You will not be disappointed.
6305499365|5.0|This is an absolutly great film. Workplace comedy at it's best. While expressing a great deal of office humor it also depicts a deeper meaning as well. Expressed in a quote by the main character, Peter Gibbons,&quot;Human beings weren't meant to sit in cubicals staring at computer screens all day&quot;, this would truely be the meaning of this film. People were not supposed to do what society currently expects of us. There must be something more to this mundane life we lead. I truely enjoyed this film and would definately recommened it to others.
0689835604|5.0|My daughter, who is eight months old, absolutely adores this book! She has countless board books, and this one is by far her favorite. Something about it makes her laugh hysterically. The only problem with this book is, the second we get to the end she wants to read it again! We could read it five times in a row, and she would still cry for more.
B00000JZJ0|5.0|OK, so Bride of Re-Animator isn't as good as the original, but as fans know, that was a pretty hard act to follow. I didn't really appreciate this movie as much until I rented this  special edition DVD and was blown away!  First of all, this movie has the second most hilarious commentary track (the one with Jeffrey Combs and Dan Abbott, as Dr. West and Dr. Cain) I have every heard (the funniest was Evil Dead 2, limited edition-I don't think anything can top that).<br />I should also point out here in all fairness that I'm a complete Re-animator geek, I saw it in the theater in 1985 and was hooked; I've probably watched it more than any other horror movie-at least 50 times in the last 15 years. I almost broke my legs in my haste getting to the video store when their copy of the sequel came in I was so excited. I was slightly disappointed, but I did have very high expectations. The last 20 minutes or so were pretty impressive, but the prologue I was so psyched to see (more on that later) was completely gone.<br />When I rented this DVD special edition, though, I decided to actually pick up a copy. Not only; was the commentary by the actors hilarious, but both of the actors, especially Combs, go into interesting details like how the scene was shot,; and even going into the character's motivations. Combs even remembers some of his lines (with the exact inflections he delivered them in), which didn't make me feel like such a geek. You can tell he had a blast making the movie and really enjoyed it. Lines that never struck me as especially amusing before such as Dr. West saying, &quot;My God...they're using tools!&quot; were hilarious when the actor made a few comments afterwards. Anyway, if you're a diehard Re-animator &quot;superfan&quot; (hey,it sounds better than &quot;geek&quot;) like me, you HAVE to see this special edition. I can't say enough good things about the commentary-I realize I sound like a broken record now as well as a movie geek, but again, you have to see it for yourself to really appreciate it.<br />The disc is absolutely packed with cool-a$$ extras-it's one of the double-sided ones, so be sure to check out the other side. Some of the highlights include the unrated version- it doesn't have a whole lot of extra gore, less than a minute, but it's pretty jaw dropping (several more seconds of the climactic meltdown). It includes great behind the scenes footage, (you haven't laughed till you've seen a behind-the-scenes shot of David Hale as Dr. Hill in full make-up, casually playing poker with a pair of bat wings sewed to his head) and a breakdown of a sequence where the detective actually finds Dr. Hill in a sideshow where he's advertised as &quot;The Talking Head From the Miskatonic Massacre&quot; (apparently, he followed West's advice from the first movie).<br />But the real gem is the deleted original sequence where Dan re-animates Meg (hint: it doesn't go real smoothly). It's sort of a rough cut, but very satisfying- I read about the opening in Fangoria before the movie came out and thought, &quot;man, I can't WAIT to see that-perfect!&quot;, so I was really disappointed when it was cut. In fact, it's worth the price of the DVD just to finally get to see Combs as Dr. Herbert West utter the immortal line: &quot;No, Hill didn't kill me...he didn't have the guts.&quot;  YEAH BABY! I waited over 10 years to hear Jeffrey Combs say that line, and by God, it was worth it. Why they cut the opening, I have no idea. Ah, the invention of the DVD special edition -one of technology's greatest achievements (for us movie fans anyway).<br />So, if you're a big Combs fan, a big Stuart Gordon fan, a hard-core fan of the first movie, or all of the above like me, this is a must-add to your collection. Even if you weren't that blown away by the first movie, you'll love this special edition- trust me on this. Much, much better than I expected.<br />Date. Mate.

B0000203Y5|5.0|Is this film perfect? By all means, no. In places the camera work waves out of control, and the constant featuring of Ry Cooder grows tedious. Yet despite all of this, there are certain images that this film captures that have refused to leave my mind. I get chills just thinking about Eliada Ochoa tearing up during her rendition of &quot;Silencio&quot; as she is filmed before an audience of thousands in Stockholm. I will never forget Ruben Gonzalez sitting at his piano basking in applause. And, of course, seeing Ibrahim Ferrer walk through the streets of midtown Mannhattan in utter awe is enough to make any man choke up. Though flawed, this picture never fails to stand as moving testament to the triumph of the human spirit. For these beautiful moments alone, I give this poignant film a 10.
B000002UB3|5.0|&quot;Abbey Road&quot; stands as one of the greatest achievements in musical history.  Without a single doubt, this is one of the Beatles' greatest efforts -- which is, in itself, an amazing accomplishment.  <br />By January 1969, the Beatles were pretty much finished as a functional unit.  John and Yoko were involved with &quot;experimental music.&quot;  George and Ringo were worried about the future.  Paul had different ideas.  Yet, in the midst of all these problems; the Beatles pulled together &quot;one more time&quot; to create this timeless classic.  <br />Unlike the &quot;White Album,&quot; the Beatles played together on practically all the tracks that make up Abbey Road.  This collection of tunes also introduced us to some of the more famous Beatle characters:  &quot;Mean Mr. Mustard,&quot; &quot;Polythene Pam,&quot; and &quot;The Sun King.&quot;  On this Album, George Harrison gives us two of his greatest pieces of music as a Beatle:  &quot;Something&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the Sun.&quot;  Not to be outdone, Sir Richard Starkey graces the listener with a fine ditty, &quot;Octopus's Garden.&quot;  <br />Side 2 of the Album is a classic Beatles perfromance.  All the songs are strung together to give the listener a bit of a &quot;story.&quot;  On this side, John, Paul, and George harmonize to make musical history.  <br />This collection of tunes is lyrically and musically strong.  Of course, compact disc just emphasizes the strength of the vocal and musical performances from these four lads from Liverpool.<br />If you are going to own anything by the Beatles, then this is the CD to have in your collection.  Strong musical performances. . . . Outstanding lyrics, vocals, and songwriting. . . . Out of this world production efforts by Sir George Martin. . . .Indeed, a splendid time is guaranteed for all.  And, no, Mr. Kite will not be footing the bill on this one.
6305949557|5.0|1999 was undoubtedly one of the greatest years for film since the 1970's. It was the year that brought us the darkly brilliant &quot;Being John Malkovich,&quot; the spellbinding film &quot;The Insider,&quot; and the richly beautiful &quot;Topsy Turvy&quot; (Please note I am excluding the instant classics &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley,&quot; &quot;The End of the Affair,&quot; &quot;The Sixth Sense,&quot; &quot;The Straight Story,&quot; and &quot;All About My Mother&quot; due to time constraints as I could write paragraphs on how much I adored each one of these films). Yet I make no apologies for saying that &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; deserves to sit with these amazing artistic achievments as one of the greatest films of the late 1990's. No, it does not offer any particular new insights into the human condition, or brim with originality. But what &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; is, is the perfect studio film. It is that perfect Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers dance that can be marvelled at time and time again, and coax tears out of the most cynical of souls. The film brilliantly interweaves a magnificent tapestry of comedy, fun, family entertainment, and pathos that is only rarely exhibited in today's cinema. As I watched the film in an audience full of laughing children I both found myself smiling so big that my face began to hurt, and gently crying.<br />I loved this movie. It is great for both kids and parents alike.
B00003CXP1|1.0|Simply terrible, I can't believe how much hype this movie is generating. It's not that good. I don't know how many people say that this is the best director ever. Ellen Burstyn does a good job, but she is the one who is carrying the movie, no one else is doing something that can be pointed as good in this movie.
0399146253|3.0|I usually really enjoy Cornwell's books, but her characters are starting to get into a bit of a rut.   I would think it's hard to keep all the characters fresh after so many books, but Lucy and Marino and both pretty irritating at this point.<br />I live in Williamsburg, Virginia and the thing that really annoyed me about this book is her geography of Jamestown is all screwed up.  First of all, there is no modern place called Jamestown.  All the people who live near the Jamestown settlement actually live in Williamsburg, according to their mailing addresses.  So when a character who lives near Jamestown says &quot;He's staying with his grandparents in Williamsburg&quot;, it sounds totally stupid because someone actually from here wouldn't say that.  They would refer to the place where he's staying as &quot;nearby&quot; or &quot;in town&quot;.  They wouldn't refer to Williamsburg like it's some other town because it's the town they live in.<br />She also has a character who fishes at College Landing Park, which is supposed to be near Jamestown and it's not.  It's several miles away.<br />She also keeps referring to Route 5.  It's a road that winds through many parts of town, but only one section of it is referred to as Route 5.  The rest of the road is referred to by different names.  Either the part she refers to is a stretch of the road that no one really calls Route 5 or the places she mentions as being near each other, can't really be.<br />I used to live in Richmond and her descriptions of places there would always make me feel like I was there because they were so exact.  <br />Her descriptions of the Williamsburg area were confusing and definitely sounded like they were written by someone who doesn't know the area.  It surprised me.  I actually pulled out a map because I couldn't figure out where she was talking about.<br />I guess this is all totally petty, but it was irritating.
0452282152|5.0|I cannot describe how much I loved this book.  I have read it late into the night, over my lunch hour, to and from work, just to finish it.<br />I used to live in Holland and the evocation of the Netherlands and 17th century Dutch life is marvellous.  But what is truly wonderful is the 20th century voice of Griet, the maidservant, who evolves and matures under the watchful eye of her master, the great painter Vermeer.  You read this book with your heart in your mouth, greedy for the next page, and to find out how the story of these fascinating characters will end.  This story of the maidservant and the painter is not formulaic, Vermeer does not seduce Griet on page 1, and it is not predictable.  This story is far, far more complex and interesting, and sensual, as a result.<br />I am so sad this book had to come to an end.  Read it, you will love it.
0375501851|4.0|I find it hard to believe Zadie Smith is only 24 years old. She has written an amazing work! She has taken the threads of everyday life, livened them up almost beyond recognition, and woven them into this funny, poignant, and sometimes just plain strange, tapestry. Hers are the kind of characters that you're sure you have met somewhere before. However, it wasn't perfect. While Ms. Smith's descriptions of her settings are dazzling, sometimes she goes too much into detail. Also, her South Asian characters seem to be based on rather crude stereotypes. Other than that, what a book this is!
B00004U8H4|3.0|This would have been a very difficult movie to make as there were very graphic scenes of murder, torture and mutilation in the book. There was cannibalism and the murder of children. Unpleasant to say the least. However, the book was interesting on a couple of levels. After reading it I wondered about the main character - was it all in his imagination? I also wondered about the author(Brett Easton Ellis)- what exactly is in his head? The guy is only the same age as Bateman himself. I looked forward with some anticipation to the movie - boy was I ever disappointed! I did not feel that the movie captured the essence of Bateman at all. For example,(in the book)Bateman is a guy obsessed with clothes and describes the clothing of all he meets in great detail. I know that I couldn't identify an Armani suit if my life depended upon it. The detective (Kimble) is wearing a 'linen Armani not unlike mine' but who's to know? Bateman is a character who is mega-rich with expensive education, clothes, apartment,lifestyle, etc. but the movie did not truly reflect that. When paying a check all four yuppie diners slap down a silver credit card (meant to be Platinum AMEX cards) but who's to know? For no apparent reason the names of a couple of the characters were changed. Tim Price became Timothy Bryce, Paul Owen became Paul Allen. Bateman tells Evelyn that she should leave as he 'could not control himself' when this was actually to a air-headed model called Daisy whom he picks up in Nell's. The movie tried hard to make the point that it may all have been in his sick imagination - but not convincingly. There have been reviewers who thought this was a black comedy. Murder, torture and mutilation are not funny to my mind. This is a sick mind we are dealing with - whether we believe he is a murderer or not. More to be pitied/reviled than laughed at. Apart from Christian Bale's performance the whole thing was quite bland really. There were several anonymous characters. Willem Dafoe was wasted. As for the violence is was not well done. Come back Hitchcock - all is forgiven!
0679746048|4.0|In Girl,Interrupted by Susanna Kaysen, Kaysen goes back to 1967 to relive the McLean Hopital.  The hospital was a maximum-security crazy house.  Kaysen had gone for her weekly session with her doctor and was plopped in a taxi to McLean.  When Kaysen got there she quickly became friends with all the warders.  They spent their time in the ward by torturing the nurses and absorbing the television.  Kaysen realizes that she cannot be in the ward forever, she soon gets a job after being turned down many a times.  She then got married.<br />     To get through the years the girls came up with many methods to entertain themselves.  They would harass the nurses everyday just to see them open every lock on the ward, when they found nothing wrong the nurse would go back in the office and the cycle would happen again.  But most of the girls time was spent smoking and consuming TV.<br />I would greatly recommend this book to people over the age of thirteen.  The subject of what goes on in a mental hospital is not a subject one reads about everyday.  It made me understand life in a different perspective.  The strong characters added to the memoir greatly.  Just the idea that Kaysen could go back into such a deep, dark past was amazing.   Through the pains and problems of the girls, their stay a McLean made an unexpectedly funny memoir and it was written with the greatest detail possible.
B00003CXP1|5.0|I haven't seen pi in about two years and i really don't remember too much about the techniques Aronofsky implies, but i have recently, the last year been takign film courses. This film made me decide that i wanted to do that in actuality with my life. Thank god it got released again at my local kewl movie cineplex,albeit only showing once at the latest time available. I  was rocking back and forth in my seat by the end and was too emotional to even cry, i felt like i was being shoved in my stomach. This is the most powerful movie i have ever seen. Ellen Burstyn needs and deserves to win an Academy Award for this film. Julia Roberts was a wonderful Erin Brokovich and I LOVED Laura Linney in You Can Count on Me, but this performance is the thign that comes along not too often. PLEASE WATCH THIS MOVIE. The only reason it is unrated is because the dopes at the MPAA are too scared to let people see this sometimes too realistic depiction of the spiral that drugs can cause. Traffic is good, THIS IS GREAT!!!!!!
B000000W71|3.0|I have been listening to Gary Moore for several years. This isa decent collection of slower songs and some of his blues. The tracksthat are previously unreleased are a nice addition for acollector. However, I also own Still Got The Blues and After Hours andprefer those albums as they are versus the sampling here. Putting anedited version of a song on any disc is .... If you want to samplesome of Gary's faster and harder rock, I suggest the OUT IN THE FIELDScollection or trying to find THE EARLY YEARS collection which was putout by WTG records in 1991.
B0000007BI|5.0|Mozart's Requeim is another masterpiece where he unleashes his overwhelming genius, which even his jealous contemporaries could not not find words for other than &quot;divine&quot;. At the same time, it is also a subject of great controversy as to how the unfinished portions should have been completed (serious listeners should try to learn more about how Sussmayr completed the work and how his work is criticized). Whatever the case, this is unquestionably one of the greatest works of art ever created by man.<br />Having said that about the music itself, I find this particular recording to be an excellent performance not unworthy of Mozart's genius. This is a &quot;period&quot; performance, meaning the instruments and the style of playing were chosen to resemble those of Mozart's time. If you are used to &quot;modernized&quot; performances such as the excellent Karajan recordings, which usually have a slower tempo, you may need some time to adjust to the period setting of recordings such as these.<br />This is a beautiful recording. The chorus and soloists soar with beauty, elegance, and vigor, yet with all the seriousness, reverance and appreciation toward what is transcendental, eternal and perfect, the spirit that forms the essence of the music itself. The orchestra beautifully harmonizes with the vocals. The recording is also excellent, giving clear yet adequately reverberant sound. The Penguin Guide calls  Herreweghe's conducting &quot;arresting from the very dramatic opening bars.&quot; <br />This is one of my favorite CD's, and definitely a must-buy for Requeim fans. Another excellent period performance is Gardiner's 1986 recording. And those looking for a good &quot;modern&quot; performance should also try Karajan's 1987 recording.
B00005214X|5.0|Incredible...I just spent ten days in Hawaii, and I picked up a copy at the Kona Borders(!!!) and played it over and over in the rental car CD player. It became the soundtrack for a great trip. The remastering made it sound so fresh and new. Clearly one of the 60's or 70's greatest rock albums. So inspired. George's singing is so urgent, and the overall level of execution, considering all tracks were basically played live (no digital editing back then)is so precise...they've (any rock artist) made very few like this before or since. If you love the Beatles and don't have this CD, WHAT ARE YOU WAITNG FOR??????

B000002J1M|4.0|With thier &quot;classic&quot; line-up complete,and thier ensemble sound now honed to razor-sharp perfection from many months on the road,Genesis came one step closer to art-rock nirvana on thier fourth long-player,&quot;Foxtrot&quot;.Thier great leap forward from previous efforts is immediately evident in the rich,full mellotron cascade that opens &quot;Watcher of the Skies&quot;,kicking off a much more dynamic,assured and certainly much better produced album.Also very apparent is vocalist Peter Gabriel's continual development as a,well,not so much a songwriter in the traditional sense,but,shall we say, a conceptualist:the tracks on this record are full of coy lyrical asides,grand metaphors,winking allusions,and laboriously constructed narratives.Indeed,Gabriel's astonishingly ambitious approach to structure and thematic development functions simultaniously as the record's biggest asset and most glaring flaw:on &quot;Watcher&quot;,his bruesque rumination on a creative diety's misgivings about what he has rent,the band struggles to keep up with the thematic thrust,chugging along behind with a clunky,steam-powered quasi-jazz contraption,complete with awkward sound-effects.On&quot;Get 'em Out By Friday&quot;,Gabriel makes explicit the band's early adherence to a very British,Monty Python-insired absurdist humor with a wry tale of a near-future where public-housing officials have declared limits to human hight,so as to optimize space in apartment complexes.Again,however,the band seems tentative,flailing away in very trad-prog fashion,right down to the over-amped,braying organ leads.However,it's not always the band having trouble;&quot;Time Table&quot;,and especially&quot;Can-Utility and the Coastliners&quot;,are musically flawless,but burdened with laughably naive English-Lit 101 psuedo-poetry that suggests....       All of this quibbling is mere pedrantry,though,once you hear the ultimate early-Genesis track that closes the album-&quot;Supper's Ready&quot;.Here,all the pieces fall into place.The band's never sounded more cohesive or dynamic,and individually the performances are unfailingly inspired,such as the spine-tingling acoustic picking by Steve Hackett and Micheal Rutherford in the first section,and the galvanic keyboard fills by Tony Banks in the epic,climactic &quot;Apocalypse in 9/8&quot; section.Phil Collins is solid as always.And Gabriel turns in his first seamless narrative.       &quot;Foxtrot&quot; is not without flaws,but,just for the perfect &quot;Super's Ready&quot;,it is never-the-less essential.
B000007OY0|5.0|Messages of living come through many different mediums - books, poetry, great teachers, films, theatre, song, not to mention the many people, strangers and friends (and the non-human ones) that pass our way in life.  This movie is one of those messengers. The message of hope contained in one of the final scenes where Andy says to Red &quot;that I guess it just gets down to one thing. You either get busy living, or get busy dying,&quot; is a reminder that no matter what life hands us, we and only we, are the ones that choose to keep growing, or to give up. This is the stuff of great character. It's an empowering message.
B000002J1L|4.0|Opening with the band's first bonafide classic, &quot;The Musical Box&quot;,this album marks the culmination of Genesis' rise from school-chum obscurity to true music scene players(even if it was the Italian music scene).With the addition of Phil Collins on the traps,this was the world's first chance to hear the line-up that would produce the bands' most memorable and adventurous work,and all the elements that they would perfect on subsequent recordings are present:the baroque,searching set-pieces(&quot;The Return Of  The Giant Hogweed&quot;,&quot;The Fountain Of Salmacis&quot;),charming acoustic tunes(&quot;For Absent Friends&quot;),and eccentric,twisted pop confections(&quot;Seven Stones&quot;,&quot;Harold The Barrel&quot;).All the players are strong on this album,but it's arguably guitarist Steve Hackett's show.Also a new addition to the group,his skill and innovative style are especially evident in the harsh,dissonant leads he performs on &quot;The Musical Box&quot; and his elagent,swooping lines on &quot;The Fountain of Salmicis&quot;.The band's flawless ensamble playing makes &quot;Hogweed&quot; surprisingly kinetic and driving(Never know much for &quot;rocking out&quot;,the band occasionally displays a rousing dynamicism,especially live,that may surprise those unfamiliar with thier early work).The only flaw with this album-and it's a major one-is the atrocious production:muddy,flat and utterly uninspired,it keeps this record from being truly indispensable;but,despite that,&quot;Nursury Cryme&quot; should be in any true genesis fan's collection.
B00002Z88D|5.0|This was the first Metallica album I bought, and I soon had to get more.  Micheal Kamen, director of the orchestral part in &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot; from Metallica's self-titled album is back, and this time he's done more than written background music for the songs.  What was created on the stage at the Berkely Theater was amazing, and we will never again see anything like it.  &quot;Call of the Ktulu&quot; is an excellent intro for &quot;Master of Puppets,&quot; starting the concert off with a bang.  Metallica really shines on Disc 2, however, with &quot;Nothing Else Matters,&quot; &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls,&quot; &quot;One,&quot; and &quot;Battery.&quot;  Metallica wrote two new songs, and &quot;-Human&quot; and &quot;No Leaf Clover&quot; show Metallica at its best.
038533348X|5.0|I had heard so much about Vonnegut since my freshman year in High school. I know now that I will become a hard core fan of all his books. I'm an avid reader of all science fiction novels and this one is definitely one of my favorites. This book is by far a thrill ride of an apocolyptic adventure. There are also alot of great charcter introduced in the book and alot of funny scenes. This was my first experience with Vonnegut and I enjoyed every moment of it. When I first saw the cover of the book I thought that it would be interesting and it was. It was not so hard and it was not very easy either. I love the way he satires religon and science. Blending his patented wry humor with acute social insight presented in an absurd fantasy world, Vonnegut has written an exceptional novel of love lies and the self destruction of mankind. The story centers around the narrator, Jonah, who is called by name only once in the entire book. We are told in the begining of the book that he is writing a book on the events of the day the first atomic bomb was dropped on Japan.His research leads him to a correspondence with Newt Hoenikker, the midget son of doctor Felix Hoenikker, father of the atomic bomb. After meeting with Newt, destiny leads our protagonist to the impoverished island republic of San Lorenzo, where among other adventures he finds religon, falls in love and becomes a president. All of this by itself would make for a very entertaining book, but it is not in the story line that Vonnegut's genius lies. Cat's Cradle is rife with painfully accurate insights into the institutions that our society holds so dear, such as, religion, politics, and science. Vonnegut invents for the inhabitants of San Lorenzo a brand new religion based completely and admittedly on &quot;foma&quot;, or lies. This wouldn&quot;t be so shocking, except for the fact that this &quot;bokonism&quot; seems to make perfect sense. Other Vonnegut ironies pervade the book and are too elaborate to go into. Cat'sCradle is one of the most absurd,and frightening novels. This book truly causes one to stop and think about the things that one holds as unquestionably true. All of these incredible people, places, things and ideas in Cat's cradle are intricately woven into a perfect tapestry that sums up and spells out many of mankind's self-created problems in 191 pages. I haven't read any of Kurt Vonnegut's other books but I know that I most certainly will. After checking this book out from the library I went and bought my own copy. I strongly recommed this book to anyone over the age of four-teen. There is no reason not to buy this masterpiece of modern literature. SO IF YOU READ IT WAS AND DIDM'T LIKE IT THAN READ IT AGAIN. IF YOU READ IT ONCE AND ENJOYED BUY IT AND READ IT AGAIN.
0804115613|5.0|I borrowed this book, which was (incongruously) written by the actress and comedienne Fannie Flagg, from a lesbian friend and never ended up giving it back.  She left town, and I'm sorry, but I kept the book and have read it again and again and again and again and again and have never grown tried of it.  Wanna be tempted?  Let me quote a couple of lines from the book that will make you get teared up if you ever get teared up:<br />Evelyn stared into the empty ice cream carton and wondered where the smiling girl in the school pictures had gone.<br />Idgie smiled back at her and looked up into the clear blue sky that reflected her eyes and she was as happy as anybody who is in love in the summertime can be.<br />Eva didn't know about a lot of things, but she knew about love.<br />Sipsey was still in the cafe, wagging her finger up to the ceiling. &quot;Don't you do dis, Lord .. don't you do dis to Miz Idgie and Miz Ruth ... don't you do this thang!

038533348X|5.0|Cat's Cradle is by far the best Vonnegut novel that I have yet read. Blending his patented wry humor with acute social insight presented in an absurd fantasy world, Vonnegut has written an exceptional novel of love, lies, and the self destruction of mankind. The story centers around the narrator, Jonah, who is called by name once in the entire book. We are told in the beginning that he is writing a book on the events of the day the first atomic bomb was dropped on Japan. His research leads him to a correspondence with Newt Hoenikker, the midget son of Doctor Felix Hoenikker, father of the atomic bomb. After meeting with Newt, destiny leads our protagonist to the impoverished island republic of San Lorenzo, where among other adventures, he finds religion, falls in love, and becomes president. All of this by itself would make for a very entertaining book, but it is not in the story line that Vonnegut's genius lies. Cat's Cradle is rife with painfully accurate insights into the institutions that our society holds so dear, such as, religion, politics, and science. Vonnegut invents for the inhabitants of San Lorenzo a brand new religion based completely and admittedly on &quot;foma&quot;, or lies. This wouldn't be so shocking, except for the fact that this &quot;bokonism&quot; seems to make perfect sense. Other Vonnegut ironies pervade the book and are too elaborate to go into. Kurt Vonnegut is my favorite author of all time. Cat's Cradle is one of his funniest, most absurd, and frightening novels. This book truly causes one to stop and think about the things that one holds as unquestionably true. All of the incredible people, places, things, and ideas in Cat's Cradle are intricately woven into a perfect tapestry that sums up and spells out many of mankind's self-created problems in 191 pages. --This text refers to the Mass Market Paperback edition.
0395324416|5.0|This book is an extremely useful supplement to the Silmarillion. A collection of short essays and accounts which take into depth the tales of the eldar days, and to a lesser extent, the War of the Ring and the third age. Most useful/interesting is the account of the Istari (Wizards), telling of their coming to Middle Earth under order of the Val in the blessed realm and their quest. Also the description of the Isle of Nmenor, home of the old Kings of the men of Westernesse makes for good reading. However, not one for the casual reader, and serves as aforesaid a supplement to The Silmarillion.

B000002ADT|5.0|In 1959 during two spring afternoon sessions in an old church turned studio, Miles Davis, Bill Evans, 'Cannonball' Adderlry, John Coltrane, Wynton Kelly, and Paul Chambers recorded quite possibly the world's most beautifull recored. Kind Of Blue is unlike anything I've ever heard, Jazz or rock, or pop, classiacal...anthing. This recording will continue to move you even after countless listens. Each note floats around the listener while the hypnotic melodies sooth the soul and inspire the mind. Rarley does a single album obtain near perfection, Pet Sounds, Geaceland, Blowout Comb come close....Kind Of Blue Achieves. Kind of Blue is filled with subtle greatness, somthing very rare in music
B000050XEI|3.0|I have always liked Enya and i have singed these &quot;Sail away,sail away&quot; lyrics million times.Thus,when the new album &quot;a day without rain&quot; came out,i immediately rushed to a record store and bought it,only to discover that it's an album without what i loved about her music.Every new Enya album always had something different to a previous one,but this seemed to be too much of the same.I felt like a had already heard these songs...as a result i went back to the past albums.Some tracks are nice,i.e.:Only time,Wild child,Tempus Vernum and A day without rain,but the album seems to be more pop than new age...if you are ok with that, then you will love this,personally,however, i prefer Watermark and Shepherd Moons...dissapointing.
0767817478|1.0|Another big budget turkey from Roland Emmerich, who proves again that it always pays to underestimate the intelligence of your audience.  Godzilla is ugly, the characters are boring, the romance is, well, uninspired, and frankly you hope the stupid monster destroys all of New York and then chokes to death.  Don't watch this if you can possibly avoid it.  Definitely don't buy it.  It's a waste of money, time, and plastic.  Think 2 hours you'll never get back.
0440219078|4.0|&quot;The Giver,&quot; by Lois Lowry, is a novel about a perfect world that would never exist. The community in which these characters live in is surreal. Their lifestyle is based on what they are told to be and how they are told to live. This book has many themes and meanings. A particular theme is the study of folklore and cultures of different people.   In this novel, Jonas is the main character. He is a twelve year old boy who will be turning thirteen in a short time. He is excited about this fact, because in his community, when you reach a certain age, you are given a job that you have to perform for the rest of your life. When it is time for the ceremony, and the children are all given their job assignments, Jonas believes that he had been forgotten about. Surprisingly, he was told that his job assignment would be that of the Giver. Jonas was to go into training immediately. The Givers' job was to receive the memories of all the people in the community. All the love, pain, hate, anger, happiness, worry, frustration, war, hunger, and every other emotion possible, would be in the hands of Jonas. After some training, and Jonas' witnessing of his father murdering an infant, Jonas decided that it is too much for him and he decides to go &quot;Elsewhere.&quot; This decision would be a very dangerous one, because no one was allowed to leave the community. Jonas does it anyway, and wonders what is waiting for him beyond his own community.  The Giver is an appropriate book for the study of folklore because it shows how memories are supposed to be passed from one generation to another, for a person to truly understand who they are and where they are coming from. The Giver shows us that for a community to survived and live normally there has to be a balance of emotions and no one person should be able to hold all these emotions and not pass them one. Although our world and communities are not perfect, it is more important that we know who we are, and we be able to love and hate and feel whatever emotion we choose, than to live in a perfect world filled with no emotion.
B000001FSU|3.0|This album highlights what was going on at that time, Make me Laugh was TV Evanglists getting caught pants down, Who Cares Wins explored the homeless problom, and Be All End All, was about suicide. <br />Granted it's not as heavy as ATL but it's good never the less.
0553213105|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is one of those books that I just keep coming back to over and over.  Austen has spun an very romantic love story with this one, but it is much more than that.  Her social commentary is biting and true, even for today's standards.  Her dialogue, though that of over 100 years ago, still sounds true and real.  The plot keeps you reading so you forget that this is a classic, and just enjoy it for the story and the beauty of the language.  On of my favorites, and one I highly recommend!
0688170528|5.0|On Tuesday I was almost glad to take a sick day from work because, despite the flu, I could finally finish The Pact--only several days after I started it.  Needless to say, this book was hard to put down.  Several times throughout I found myself dreaming or thinking about the characters, a sure sign of a book that has really captured me.<br />This book is about two kids, a boy and a girl, who grew up next door to each other.  From the time they were little their families expected the two to get together.  When they are in high school, they finally become a couple.  Unfortunately, as you find out at the very beginning, there is a tragedy one night and the girl ends up dead.  Piccoult spends the rest of the book exploring each character and his or her relationships in detail.  The book culminates with a tense trial to discover...just who is responsible for the girl's death?<br />Despite the subtitle (&quot;A Love Story&quot;) The Pact is not a romance.  It, does, however, explore several kinds of loving relationships in interesting ways.
B000059Z8J|5.0|Last night a friend that works at Warner Brothers brought over a surprise: The Superman-The Movie two disc DVD! And after watching it, I've got some good news, and some bad news. <br />First the good news- This new version is even better that the original edit of the film. A lot more of Marlon Brando's scenes. And the really cool sequence in Lex Luthor's underground hide out where he tries to kill Superman with bullets, fire &amp; cold. Plus more... <br />The picture quality is just stunning. Krypton has this insane glow to it. And the new sound rivals brand new movies. The music is bright &amp; vibrant, swirling all around you, and the entire 5.1 mix is used very well. <br />Now, the bad news- There's only the one version of the movie. I had hoped you'd be able to play the original, too.<br />More good news- The second disc has an enormous amount of brand new special features (almost two hours worth.) In their entirety, they seem to transport you back in time to relive the fascinating story of how the two Superman movies got made--up until director Richard Donner was stupidly fired, and not brought back to finish the second film. There's a lot of never-been-seen before, behind-the-scenes footage. In the casting tests you can see early versions of the Superman costume as Chris Reeve plays against many actresses including Leslie Warren, Anne Archer (both who were very good,) and of course Margot Kidder. <br />And then there are the two exceptional documentaries with new interviews from almost everybody. They follow the history of the two films, and include very interesting business aspects. Chris Reeves' story is very touching.  Also included is a documentary on the special effects with neat(!) early flying tests.<br />Now more bad news- My friend took the discs with her.<br />To some up: this is the most complete, classy &amp; top notch DVD package I have ever seen. Very well done !  A+
B0000029GA|5.0|if youre a hip hop fan youve probably heard people talk to no end about this album, and they are right to do so. Very few hip hop albums have the consistancy and overall quality of this lp. Nas shows maturity and skill WAY beyond his years and drops a debut that sadly he could probably never top. Track for track this album never dissapoints, every song is amazing, every rhyme is amazing, every beat is amazing, throught and through this album is the defention of a classic. This albums only weakness is that its only 10 tracks, which is not enough, and leaves you begging for more. the cat who said this ablum is over-rated didnt listen hard enough. there is only one guest emcee (AZ) and this is a plus because it leaves more room for nasty nas. The prdocution is all star, including: Primo, Large Professor, Q tip amongs others. do yourself a favor and buy this album
B00004ZEQX|5.0|This movie is wonderful with a touch of cheesiness I look for in movies of this genre.  The child actors are much more disturbing than the movie itself, but that has to be seen to be believed...
0375703764|5.0|This book had gotten inside my skin and I can't scratch it out. I think Mr. Truant would be impressed by the effect he had on me with the prose he was transcribing from Zampano, his blind neighbor who'd penned a critical work regarding a nonexistent documentary about a very, very strange and frightening house in Virginia.<br />House of Leaves *sounds* and actually is very complicated, but it all makes sense once you start reading it. Despite the multiple narrators and numerous footnotes as well as very strange arrangements of text within the book, it's surprisingly accessible.<br />Navidson's Record, had it been a real movie, would have scared me to death. It does remind one of Blair Witch Project - the pseudocraze surrounding it, the spookiness, the handheld cameras - but Blair Witch is silly childish funny stuff in comparison to the terror you're bound to experience in the able hands of Navidson, or should I say Zampano, or maybe it's Mr. Truant - or, actually, just the marvelously talented Mr. Danielewski.<br />For some reason, besides the oddities of the house and obsessiveness of all characters involved, the one thing that haunts my dreams is a story of Minotaure that was supposedly excised from Zampano's book - readers are in for a most extraordinary retelling of this myth.<br />I can't say enough good about this, I just can't. This is an experience that will consume you whole. If you're claustrophobic, prepare for prolonged therapy from inevitable aftereffects. If you're not claustrophobic, you will become afflicted.<br />Going back to stare at the pictures of staircase again now...

Well &quot;Empire&quot; is my choice but &quot;Operation Mindcrime&quot; is a close second! The tracks are so smooth you can sip Jack Daniels or slug down Finlandia Vodka, it really does not matter... All the secrets of the universe are yours for the taking if you will just listen!<br />This band is on the edge and you can't get much better!<br />Did you like Rush's album &quot;Moving Pictures&quot;?<br />Did you like the Beatle's &quot;Sgt.

Then you will Definitely love Queensryche's &quot;Empire!&quot;<br />This is recording at it's best! Queensryche has all the qualities of the perfect rock band and they deliver on this album!<br />&quot;Silent Lucidity&quot; can send chills right down your spine!<br />Put the CD in the CD player set the Receiver to &quot;Live Room&quot; and pour yourself a good stiff shot of Jack Daniels, turn all the lights off... And if God don't talk to ya well you are beyond all hope!<br />A definite Buy recommendation from me!
0064471837|5.0|When my friend recommended this to me, I thought it looked, well, less that appealing. But I picked it up last night and have read straight through... it is one of the best books I have ever read. The style of writing makes the story seem plausible, despite the fact that it revolves around the daughter of a necromancer who can pass freely between Life and Death and who has Charter magic... you get the idea. This story bashes all the female stereotypes with a strong female lead. The characters are round and dynamic, the reader can get to know them and care about them (or hate them, depending).  I would recommend this to just about anyone other than my 18-year-old brother. Absolutely an incredible read.
B000001IPL|4.0|Smash is good, but is not the Offspring's best. I play guitar and know Smash like the back of my hand. I notice that a lot of the album sounds the same with not much variation in between. The best is Ixnay on the Hombre, where they incorporated all of their skills into one kick-ass album. Buy Smash, but don't expect to be blown away!
6300214044|5.0|When ever I am asked what is my favorite movie of all time, I never hesitate when I say &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;.  From it's first dark and sepia toned scenes, you are immediately drawn into the tragic life of Mr. Merrick.  While sometimes painful to watch because of the cruelty this man endured, it's also a testimonial to the kindness that many people can exhibit, and to the human spirit - brilliance can not be kept down.  I can not imagine another movie will ever be made that would be comparable in it's beauty, intelligence, spirit, and the way it touches your very soul.
B000002W3R|5.0|This Album is just AWESOME! It's the King at his Best! I have this Album also on blue vinyl!
B000053V7Q|5.0|The Special Edition of \\"Elvis: That's the Way It Is\\"  IS indeed special.  From its original release date in the early 70's this concert tape has always been the best performance documentary about Elvis, but at the same time it was always a strange combination of triumph and disappointment.  \\"Special Edition\\" remedies the disappointment and makes the triumph all the greater! <br />The director of the original movie was Dennis Sanders. He chose to include a great amount of distracting \\"fan\\" footage.  I always considered myself an Elvis fan, but the fans shown in this movie always embarrassed me.  Surely I wasn't like them... Ick!!! They seemed so \\"weird,\\" so boring, so uncritical and fawning, and I always felt they did not reflect well on Elvis nor on Elvis fans.  Their extensive inclusion in the original movie brought the film to a near halt. You couldn't fast forward to the next Elvis footage quickly enough!<br />This new version, \\"Special Edition\\" is almost a totally new movie. It is simply amazing.  It reduces the distracting fan segments to almost zero and adds much interesting material unused until now. Elvis was at the very beginning of the &quot;comeback&quot; having many new hits and successes that added to his confidence.  The voice many of us had feared was gone forever after the lazy 60's movie years, was suddenly back, exciting audiences all over the world again. <br />The first half of this \\"Special Edition\\" film shows preparations for the Vegas opening. First in Los Angeles with the Imperials and Sweet Inspirations practicing to Elvis recordings. Then rehearsals with Elvis in Las Vegas.  The way in which Elvis prepared, how he was fully involved in the arranging of his music is remarkable.  His playfulness, self-deprecating humor, his clowning around with his band members is very amusing and charming.  The second half of the film is the actual performances  in the main showroom at the International Hotel, Las Vegas in 1970.  The film notes that the performances shown here were filmed and selected from six different shows.  I like that kind of honesty in a documentary. It is glorious to see this greatest of American entertainers at his best.  At 35, Elvis has never looked better:  handsome, healthy, slender, working his audience like a magician.<br />Everyone in popular music today owes a debt to Elvis.  His influence was world-wide, yet few modern American performers acknowledge any influence from Elvis Presley. Perhaps they don't realize how the singers they do feel influenced them were in turn influenced themselves by  Elvis in a long chain.  These people all need to look at this new \\"Special Edition\\".  It is interesting to note that unlike American performers, two Belgian singers, 31-year-old Helmut Lotti and 13 year-old Michael Junior list Elvis as major influences on their own styles.  Check out Lotti's \\"Romantic\\" right here on Amazon. You'll think you're listening to a reincarnated Elvis.  Or check out Michael Junior,  also here on Amazon, the most astounding child singer in many, many years.<br />\\"Elvis, That's the Way It Is, Special Edition\\" belongs in every serious popular music fan's collection.  Buy it today, especially the DVD version.  It is truly a triumphant historical document that is as alive and relevant today as it was in 1970.
0671034065|3.0|Four friends make a list of what qualities they think &quot;Mr. Perfect&quot; should have.  Someone takes umbrage and the murders begin.  This book was a very easy read and a page turner, but I found the rapid romance between one of the heroines and her next-door-neighbor cop with the &quot;let's jump into bed every chance we get&quot; to be a bit much.  I also figured out who did it almost from the beginning, but the ending was still a thriller!
6300182770|1.0|The only reason this got one star instead of none was the fact that James Woods was in it (plus you can't rate items with less than one star...).  I felt like turning it off after the first ten minutes because it was so boring, but I decided to give a try.  I would rather have my time back then say I watched that dull bit of movie making.  I can't believe any of you would call this a classic.  It's a classic piece of boring trash, and thats about it.  Besides Woods, the acting was terrible, the storyline mundane, and what little special effects there were did not really impress.  But I guess some people need to cling to a movie that stinks like this, just so they can tell people they think its a classic.

0792151712|1.0|I'm sorry but this film didn't keep my interest. I'm even a forteen year old girl and I still didn't like it. Maybe I'm just not into romance movies. Many parts of the movie I wasn't even paying attention. The movie got tedious at times I found myself shifting in the theater seat. The only part that kept my interest was the actual ship sinking. That was done pretty good. It's amazing how many Titanic lovers critisize the people who don't like it to be in denial. What's wrong with them not liking the same movie you do? Isn't everyone entitled to their own oppinion? Why does it make you mad that their favorite movie isn't the same as yours? Sorry I've seen much better movies than Titanic. But then again maybe I'm not interest in Romance stories. What's next? Rose and Jack meet on a WWI battle feild? Rose and Jack in the Chicago fire? Rose and Jack in the Normandy Invasion? Rose and Jack meet in the Depression?
6303314015|5.0|This has to be the most beautiful (animation wise) film Disney has created yet. The opening sequence is stunning, with a very African feel and a wonderful song, and it really sets the mood. <br />The characters are great, and the voices were definitely well cast. Simba is your typical little boy -- bratty, self-centered, cute. He and Nala remind me so much of kids; they're more human than most of Disney's human characters. <br />Scar is my favorite Disney villain. He's funny, too, and the song &quot;Be Prepared&quot; cracked me up -- the hyenas dancing in the background was ridiculously funny. Mufasa is a great father figure.<br />The stampede scene was very powerful; I cried when Mufasa died. Some people might find Timon and Pumbaa annoying; I think they're hysterical. Hakuna Matatta (sp?) remains one of my favorite songs, along with every other song in this movie. <br />The ending is intense, to say the least, but I still liked it. I've been getting sick of cheesy happy Disney movies, and the Lion King's raw, violent ending fit well with the wild African theme. <br />The Lion King and Mulan are my two favorite Disney movies (yes, even more than Beauty and the Beast!). The animation is stunning, the songs are wonderfully done, and this is one of Disney's best movies ever.
B00000163G|4.0|I think if they would just release the first cd of this album, it would have much more succes.   The first song &quot;Ambitionz Az A Ridah&quot; is not so good, but is is followed by a couple of exellent songs: &quot;All About U&quot;, with Dru Down, Snoop Doggy Dogg and Nate Dogg, then again Nate Dogg on &quot;Skandalouz&quot;, and &quot;Got My Mind Made Up&quot; with Daz &amp; kurupt and Method man &amp; Redman.  Then on the same cd, there's &quot;2 Of Amerikaz Most Wanted&quot; with Snoop... this song is one of the best on the cd with &quot;California Love&quot; featuring Dr. Dre. The second cd is not so good, I don't know what to say about it..   :)<br />Peace.
B00004XOWM|1.0|Fred Durst is the most unorigial bag of lard there ever was.  Wes may have good guitar, but only on LB's first CD (Three Dollar Bill Yall'z) was he allowed to have any influence.  Three Dollar easily got 5 stars, Significant Other (their second album) just got to three.  This album is a horrible piece of music from a band with good potential; if they kicked out Fred they could make some good music.
0789723107|4.0|Although the ideas and conventions may seem common sense, you would be suprised at how many sites fail to &quot;see the light&quot;.  This book &quot;sheds some light&quot; on the issues of web design that are sometimes so simple that they may be overlooked.  Steve Krug also adds humor and whit to his chapters, which are short and sweet.  Don't Make Me Think is an easy read and should not be neglected, especially if you are new to the &quot;WWW&quot;.
B000002MFE|5.0|This album is a pure gem! Clapton, once again, certainly proves that you don't necessarily need to shake your butt or smile like an idiot to the camera to conquer the crowd and sell more albums; you don't need computers or special effects to make great music. There are so many musicians who started their careers pretty much at the same time as Clapton (more than thirty years ago that is) and you don't hear much about them anymore: E.C. is always there! And boy has he matured! The Martins, the Backstreets, the Spears and Aguileras will come and go, but guys like him will always be at the top!
B000028U0Y|5.0|I was raised listening to Johnny Cash.  Every Sunday morning, my father would listen to JC and so would us kids.  This CD is a kick-ass collection of songs!  For anyone who is interested in good old, tell it like it is, music from the heart, this is a MUST HAVE for your collection!!
B00004XOWM|5.0|limp bizket definetly got there groove on with this cd thats all i am going to say buy this album or i'll kill ya
B000021XS0|5.0|YES. Scenes from a memory is an album that you MUST buy. It is all the way great. The vocals, the speed, the harmonies, the technicals, the concept, great. You should listen to the album from the &quot;A to Z&quot; (from start to finish). The &quot;songs&quot; aren't songs, they are parts of the album. My favourites are &quot;Fatal Tragedy&quot; and &quot;Through Her Eyes&quot;. Scenes from a memory seems like a soundtrack or music for a book. Instead of buying Korn, Limp Bizkit, Eminem and other @#$!ing stuff, try this one! It is a masterpiece.

B000002G8N|3.0|This cd has a lot of pleasant easy-listening radio-friendly super tunes. Nothing vast, but nothing bad. Check out &quot;Black Rose&quot;, &quot;I Can't Stand It&quot;, &quot;Hold Me Lord&quot;, &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot;. Bye.
B000000OPU|5.0|Peter Gabriel is one of the most artistic of all musicians. With every song and lyric, there are elements of poetry and and beauty which are rarely encountered in modern music. On this album, \\"In Your Eyes,\\" is the ballad that will move you to tears. This song remains embedded in the memories of many who were priviledged to share their first dance at their wedding to the spiritually connecting symbolism in its lyrics. Always a popular wedding and dance song, the album is worth owning for this song alone. As a bonus, the incredibly popular songs red rain, big time and sledghammer are also on this album. As a result, you can't lose in owning it.<br />(I agree with most of what the person who wrote this review said, but unfortunately, I did not write it. Peter Gabriel is an EXCEPTIONAL artist with God-given talent...you can't say that about a lot stars today...Kelly Osborne comes to mind as a recent point-of-reference. Anyhow, the review stands \\"as-is\\" but it doesn't necessarily reflect ALL of my views.)<BR>--Matt
B00004XOWM|5.0|This was a great c.d. if not the best I have.Even though they do repeat things a lot they still are creative. It is a very active c.d. and keeps you up.Its also good to dance to.The lyrics do have lots of curses but if you dont want that then get the censored album.Either way its good. It also has a bonus song.
B000002BVN|4.0|Five great songs was half way to a near-perfect album.  Too bad half of it was remixes.  As an avid fan and critic, I won't kid you in saying this album is a must for everyone.  As an artist, I think remixes ruin the original intent of a song, and as a rule I don't own them. But for five new MJ songs, I had to ignore the remixes.  Therefore, my review is based on the quality of a single song which makes this album worth owning.  &quot;Morphine&quot; is a song aimed at the intelligent and the artistic listener. As a poetic ballad about the dangers and desires associated with drug addiction, this song makes for intersting listening. It is combination hard rock, and tender ballad mixed into one confusing and disfunctional bag.  Obviously written as a healing step to overcome his own addiction, it shows how even the most pious and charitable of celebrities can fall to the ills of the common man.  The glimmer of hope is, no matter how lost you may be, you can find a way to escape the intoxication associated with an addiction. For the artistic value of this single alone, I would say this album is worth owning.
B000002H97|3.0|Sorry to say it folks, but I just don't see this being a great metal album, and it has nothing to do with whether they &quot;sold out&quot; or not. The leadoff track, 'Enter Sandman' was of course a big hit, and there are a few other tracks on here that are very good, such as 'Wherever I May Roam' and the hard rock ballad 'Unforgiven'. But almost the entire second half sounds like filler to me, just stereotypical mid-tempo hard rock stuff. Only in isolated moments does this record reach the peaks of aggression that Lightning and Puppets did. Some of this may just be my taste, I really like the old speed-metal material. But after all the hype I heard about this one and how many copies it's sold, I was expecting more.
B000056N8X|1.0|The one star rating is much too generous, but 0 stars and minus stars are not provided. This film is utterly unbearable! The only redeeming features are some attractively misty location photography and the tiny metal crosses on one character's shoes. Am I clutching at straws? You bet, but unlike the makers of this unbelievably awful pile of sludge, I'm not yet plumbing the depths of REAL desperation. The writing, direction and acting are abysmal, and I was begging my co-viewers to stop the DVD player well before the supposedly exciting finale. Appearing soon in a used DVD bin near you! (By the way, I had no complaints about the actual technical quality of the disc, thank you).
B000002H33|5.0|It was the title track of this 1986 opus that first awakened me to the possibility of there being art and finesse in heavy metal. The divebomb opening, impossibly tight thrash sections and melodic neoclassical interlude make it the most outstanding speed-metal song I've ever heard. And fortunately, the rest of the disc is also excellent - up-tempo brutality in 'Battery' and 'Disposable Heroes', haunting leads in 'Sanitarium'. 'Orion' is the other major standout for me, including passages of great beauty as well as pummeling riffs. The blueprint for this album was Ride the Lightning, but this one certainly perfects the idea of extended thrash songs, sprawling out for 54 doom-laden minutes. The production is rich and full and much better than on their next (slightly inferior) release ...And Justice For All. I always return to Master of Puppets as a prime example of metal mayhem done right.
B00000K0EA|2.0|I cannot give this entry into the Bond legend any higher than two stars. This rating is despite high production values, more than acceptable villians, great action sequences and some very nice actors (Jonathan Priyce and Michelle Yeoh). My problem is the actor as Bond; Pierce Brosnin simply doesn't work in the role; by definition Bond is a killer...the most dangerous man in an entire nation, and Brosnin completely fails to convey any sense of either strength or threat. Certainly he is suave and well dressed, polite, refined and easy to see as a lady's man...but all of these qualities should be subordinate to his main function which is as a killer...a double o licensed to kill operative of Her Majesty's government...and he simply never comes across as such a dangerous individual. I find it especially embarassing when he is constantly grunting, grimacing and acting tough; these are painfully obvious examples of overcompensation in his character. Connery allows his own good humor to show through without damaging his ruthless persona; he can afford to. Brosnin either can't or at least feels he can't, and this greatly hurts the end product. What is particularly disturbing in the movie is when his fighting abilities are compared to those of Michelle Yeoh. Yeoh impresses one as a coordinated and well trained professional martial artist; Brosnin is intended to be her equal or better, and the script follows that analysis. Unfortunately it is obvious to any viewer that Yeoh is vastly superior to him in terms of physical prowess and expertise, nor does she grunt, grimace or act tough at any point in the entire film. I own this film but only as a completist. It is sad, because so many other parts of the film really are extremely well done, but as I can't accept the protagonist, everything else suffers as well.
6305171769|5.0|Michael Meyers was from another realm- a place of dark natural forces. His strength, stamina, and ferocity terrorized the little hamlet of Haddenfield, Illinois for three genrations. And he always returned on Halloween to stalk his last victim- Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis). <br />To fully appreciate the finale to this modern horror epic, one is advised to watch each Halloween film in succession (but you can skip Haloween III because it has nothing to do with the others). Only then can you fully understand the metaphysic of the Druid sandman and the fear he instills in Laurie Strode. <br />The entire sequence of events comes to a hero's journey finale in Halloween H20 when Laurie Strode decides to no longer run from her fears, but to face Michael Meyers head-on. In the finale, Jamie Lee Curtis is beyond actress- we see in her emotions, in her veins and in the sliver of passion which shakes her body, that for her the resolve of this journey had become an actress's reality (she does not like starring as a victim in horror films- she candidly has stated that to the press many times: but lo and behold, Halloween 8 due out this autumn!).<br />Only those who do not understand the hero's journey may see this film as just another slasher fiction. But for those who have followed the heroine in all of her trials and fears, to see her for the first time turn in a resolve to live free or die, is exhilirating and incredibly meaningful.<br />God bless Donald Pleasance (Loomis)- his spirit lives!. As for Jamie Lee Curtis- bravo, and thanks for doing this. You are acting a role that Joseph Campbell would be proud of.
0440219078|4.0|THE GIVER is a good study of folklore and transcendentalism or the philosophy of the perfect world. It shows how it could or couldn't work, depending on the reader's point of view and how it changes the human being. It is most definitely worthy of its awards and is a good and easy read. It's not difficult to understand and yet provides a deeper meaning for anyone willing to look for it. Definitely 4 stars possibly 5.
B000002UKS|5.0|The Colour and The Shape<br />In my opinion, the finest work by the group and best writing by Grohl before or since. The CD that truly turned me onto the Foos, eventually earning them the spot of favorite. The debut was great, yet a little repetitive; This one is perfect in all ways.<br />Every song hits an individual chord with the soul, and each selection sounds genuinely heart felt. A concept album (of sorts), the order of songs is perfect as well, creating a great finished UNIT which deserves to be listened to straight through:<br />A little breakdown...<br />1)Doll - Great opener. Short and sweet, it portrays Grohl's timid and overwhelmed feeling at the beginning of the story. Each passing song is filled with more and more confidence until the triumphant end.<br />2)Monkey Wrench - One of the more publicly recognizable tunes on the platter, it has an awesome beat and is one of the better songs on a CD without a weak spot.<br />3)Hey, Johnny Park! - My second favorite song and one which, for some reason, always seems to be overlooked. Great intro, terrific lyrics, and a very unique aura qualify this one as an A+.<br />4)My Poor Brain - The song that took me the longest to open up to; after listening to it enough it really starts to stick. Very powerful sound, after a peculiar start.<br />5)Wind Up - Another hidden gem everyone tends to pass over. Somewhat bitter and vengeful, it definitely deserves a listen.<br />6)Up In Arms - Cool little song. Changes from slow to fast halfway through, it really becomes quite uplifting.<br />7)My Hero - Gets quite a bit of radio play, still. Many interperatations exist concerning its lyrics, making it very intersesting. Great drum opening, cathcy riff, and POWERFUL lyrics.<br />8)See You - One of the more innocent and laid back songs. Fun to listen to and it is reported that Grohl joked that it was his &quot;favorite&quot; on the album.<br />9)Enough Space - Strange song, but like everything else, it fits. Loud sound and fastpace keep things moving in a good direction.<br />10)February Stars - Slow, emotional lyrics for the first half, followed up by a second half containing strictly the chorus, set to an awesome distorted sound.<br />11)Everlong - This is it. The most famous Foo song, most widely played, and my personal fav song by anyone. Horribly infectous da-da-da-dada-da sound, poigniant and beautifully vocalized lyrics, and an almost haunting quality all serve to leave an indelible impression on the mind.<br />12)Walking After You - Slow, acoustic love(?) song. Very interesting and thought provoking lyrics. A good one.<br />13)New Way Home - Simply brilliant ending. Caps off the concept in an ingenious fashion. Ends with Grohl's shouting of the lyric &quot;I'm not scared&quot; (whereas in &quot;Doll&quot; he claims, &quot;I've never been so scared&quot;), completing the whole confidently re-born motif. One of the best 6 minute songs I've ever heard.<br />Overall Rating: A+ (a MUST have)
0375704027|5.0|Unlike many of Murakami's other novels, this one has few or none of the fantastic elements we've come to expect from him.  Rather, this is a coming of age story set in Japan in the late 1960s.  Toru (there's that name again) Watanabe is a not-too-engaged drama student living his own personal drama in a world that seems to be perpetually on quaaludes.<br />I don't want to give the plot away, but in its simplest terms, the story is one of a romantic triangle (quadrangle at times), where two of the sides are totally unconnected.  It's a story of impossible promises..  In the end, it is a sweet tale of love, commitment, and growing up.<br />This book was originally published in English in Japan (translated by Birnbaum, not Rubin), and has been long sought after here in the US.  This edition is a new translation, and is Murakami's approved translation for sale outside of Japan.
B000056HOK|4.0|This album is as good as &quot;Live Aus Berlin&quot; and &quot;Sehnsucht&quot; can be put together.  For those of us who have got &quot;Asche zu Asche&quot; and &quot;Sehnsucht&quot;, then you already have this album, but without the Australian Tour sticker.  I'm not sure how common this is, but my stereo was unable to pick up and play Disc 2 (Asche zu Asche), but fortunately I had access to another stereo that could play it.  BE WARNED.  Otherwise, it's a great buy for any Rammstein fans collection.
B000002KON|5.0|I just got this CD in the mail today... and already it's working it's way into my into my list of favorite albums, competing with Quadrophenia, by The Who, and Wish You Were Here, by Pink Floyd. All I can say is that this album flat out rocks!  My personal favorite tracks are &quot;Mr. Churchill Says&quot; and &quot;Shangri-la&quot;, but there's not a bad track on the whole disc.  Buy it.  I promise you won't be disappointed.
0451524985|5.0|I did not read this book until ten years ago - age forty for those who count - and found it a brilliant work. It touched on every aspect of life in that era, using a difficult premise at the focus.<br />One reviewer called it 'sexist.' In that era, women were kept removed from the world, so men were the ones who made the initial contacts with reality and their sexuality. If Lawrence had written about that society in any other way, he would have been inaccurate. Lawrence shows the social conflict with both subtlety and brutality. Yet, Mellor IS a lover. There are sexual descriptions which are explicit, but within the coccoon of emotional bondings.<br />The way that Lawrence has essayed the class structure of England in that era is brave and accurate in all ways. He makes the posturing of the aristocracy both frivilous and full of assinine criteria at the same time he understands the willingness of those in power to offer their lives in the defense of the general welfare.<br />Lawrence notes again with unpleasant accuracy the detriments of an unchecked Industrial Revolution on the social structure of the time. He has Constance both witness these effects and suffer the olfactory damage.<br />This is a literary work which has an effect across the full spectrum of the possible. Finely drawn characters searching for a better way to survive their lives in a scenario that is rife with obstacles and unpleasantness. He has the touch of the finest artist working with the lightest gossamer and the blunt force of an ogre swinging a stone axe.<br />This was published in an abridged version because it was felt that the societal message it conveyed should be allowed to transit the draconian (by the less filtered standards of today) censorship of the era which DID focus on the sexual descriptions but could NOT stop the voice of social criticism any more than the same group could stop Dickens a few decades earlier.
0131103628|4.0|This is a concise explanation and exploration of the C language.  It's examples are pulled from the standard C libraries or from UNIX itself.  <br />I am an experienced Java programmer that needed to quickly learn enough C to use the Palm API to develop a handheld application.  I just finished this book, downloaded the GNU-PRC Tools IDE, and hope to get a test Palm app running in a few hours.<br />I recommend this book, but please keep in mind it's purpose - this book is designed for individuals with an understanding of programming basics.

B00003CWTI|1.0|this movie got on my nerves. i love julianna moore. she was good in this part, but it didn't make the movie any better. the ending was anticliamtic. the movie was too long and just made me bored. i could not get into this movie at all. don't waste 3 hours of your time. stay away from this movie at all cost. unless you just want to waste time.
0553278398|5.0|On the whole I am not fond of books written to round out a series.  They tend to lack the depth that the books of the series itself possess.  In this case, this book is an equal to the others in the series.<br />First of all, I would read the Foundation series first, before you read this.  I would also read the Robot series before you read this.  There are aspects of this book what would spoil the suprises in the other books if this was read first.<br />It gives you an in-depth look at the sheer diversity of mankind, all from the diversity he finds fleeing the government, a diversity that offsets the making of a mathematics that deals with our similitude.<br />The ending is also a suprise, even if you have read the other books, and for that, I must give Asimov credit.<br />Hari Seldon is given an impossible task, to find a way to quantify all of human activity, and he doesn't think he can do it.  Meanwhile, he is being hounded by agents of the government of Trantor, capitol of the Galaxy.  Yes, this book takes place when psychohistory is just an idea, before Hari became the all-knowing sage that he is pictured as in other books.
B000002MUW|5.0|This album is probably in my opinion the best album Madonna has ever recorded.  One reason that I say this is because the song that I adore of hers the most is Bedtime Story the title track to this album.  It's an R&amp;B album but Bedtime Story stands alone as a track that you would hear perhaps on Ray of Light.  She used different producers on this project resulting in a variety of songs, many of which are my favorites of all time including Survival, Secret, Inside of Me, Love Tried to Welcome Me, Sanctuary, Human Nature, Take a Bow, and of course Bedtime Story.  I would highly recommend this cd to anyone who likes R&amp;B and just likes a relaxing album to listen to.
B00001QEBQ|5.0|If you're looking to buy a DVD, the main factor I look at is how often will I, or my family, watch it. Well, with Mulan, my family watches it just about weekly. <br />Mulan is an old tale set back in yesteryear with dragons and spirits. I think that's why my kids like to watch it. It gives them a sense of fantasy.<br />Another good way to rate DVD cartoons is the music. For me, if there are songs that you can sing to during the movie, it makes the movie so much more fun. There are a number of sing-along songs that will keep your youngsters' attention. <br />And if that's not enough, there's always the good guys/gals vs the bad guys to instill moral standards. Overall, Mulan is one of the best Disney DVDs you can buy. I recommend it for everyone.
B000050XEI|3.0|Why is it that Enya never seems to come close to her remarkable breakthrough 1988 release, &quot;Watermark&quot;?  She certainly had it in mind when she made this album, as the opening title track is clearly modeled after &quot;Watermark&quot;'s.  But it comes nowhere near matching it, nor does this disc.  Enya and the Ryans seem to be playing it safe with this offering, compared to the varied and dizzyingly beautiful songs of &quot;Watermark&quot;.  And at less than 35 minutes (even shorter than her debut album), that clinches a disppointing 3-stars for it, compared with &quot;Watermark&quot;'s five stars and four-stars for her self-titled debut (retitled &quot;The Celts&quot;), &quot;Shepherd Moons&quot; and &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot;.  Make no mistake:  Even at her weakest, Enya remains beautiful to hear, but I listened to this one after playing &quot;Watermark&quot;, and that's like following up a gourmet dinner with vanilla ice cream.
B00000IAU3|5.0|As with many other reviewers, I found out about her during the SNL show when Eminem and Dido were performing Stan. Frankly her singing was the most refreshing piece I had heard in a long time so I had to get the album. And since I got it a few days back, it has not budged from the CD Rom tray in my computer. The balance between the electronica laden music and her soothing vocals is pretty awesome. I recommend it to everyone who want to choose only one album this year and dont want to go wrong.
B00004T9AF|5.0|There are some ground-breaking albums that you feel you ought to own but you end up struggling to enjoy.  There are no such problems with this CD.<br />This was the multi-million-selling album that established the Virgn label.  Without this, there might have been no Branson empire.  I doubt whether Tangerine Dream's PHAEDRA would have reached the audiences it did without the Virgin label.  Certainly this LP opened the door to a new market which others such as Steve Reich's wonderful MUSIC FOR 18 MUSICIANS were able to cater to.  Even composers such as Arvo Part subsequently benefited from the demand for 'new-age' material -- although I recognise that both Oldfield and Part dislike that term.<br />It all started with a little piece consisting of one bar of 7 beats and another of 8 beats, which Oldfield said turned out by accident to be a very nice listenable thing, which owed something to the complexity of Eastern music, the repetitiveness of Terry Riley and the technique of Bach.  These looping clusters of notes built to a grand climax narrated by the late Vivian Stanshall (ex-Bonzos).  You could whistle to it, or even have sex to it (a popular pastime in the mid-70s).<br />Oldfield has recorded three near-perfect masterpieces, all in succession: this, HERGEST RIDGE and OMMADAWN.  People argue about which is the best, but frankly you will enjoy them all.  Each has moments of fantastic beauty.  There is something elemental to the trilogy: if this represents Water, then the second is Air, and the third Earth.  In the 90s, Oldfield, I feel, wasted his time trying to recreate his achievement by recording BELLS II and III.  He should instead have looked in a very different direction, completing the quartet with the fourth element, Fire.  But I shouldn't think out loud like this.<br />What you get here is a 100% classic.  It's worth paying a couple of dollars extra for this remastered version, which comes with many previously unseen photographs and some anecdotes from Oldfield, Newman and Heyworth.field, Newman and Heyworth.
B000002J03|5.0|I just recently got this album on CD for the first time, afterowning the original LP as a kid when it first came out.  I've beenthrough punk, and alternative, and am waiting for the next rebirth ofquality rock out of its current state of artistic and musicalmediocrity.  (Lame Bizkit et al.)  And while I'm waiting, I'm goingthrough my usual rediscovery of Led Zeppelin--it happens every fiveyears or so, but usually is limited to IV or Houses of the Holy, bothoutstandingly great albums IMHO.  But after 31 years, I'verediscovered this kickass slab.  WHOAH!  You can try to listen toStairway to Heaven with fresh ears, and it comes up precious and dated(not to mention overexposed), but &quot;Whole Lotta of Love&quot; isSTILL mindblowingly original-- electronica/hardrock/porno/bluesfusion, anyone?  The album is so much more energetic than their ratherponderous debut album, filled with adventurous but entirely successfultime changes, wonderful orchestrations and harmonies, yet every trackbut &quot;Thank You&quot; (perhaps the first sappy hard rock ballad, Iguess it was ZEP who &quot;taught us how to love&quot;) simply ROCKSLIKE HELL!  &quot;Ramble On&quot; sends shivers up my spine,&quot;What Is and What Should Never Be&quot; STILL surprises me withits offbeat fadeout (where did they come up with THAT?), &quot;TheLemon Song&quot; takes a creepy blues jam into some strange newterritory that still hasn't been reexplored as far as I know,&quot;Living Loving Maid&quot; sounds downrightNew-Wave-ahead-of-its-time, and I think &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; justmay be the TOUGHEST song that's ever been done by ANYBODY.  And&quot;Bring It On Home&quot; does just that.  Take away the 70'scliche drum solo throaway, &quot;Moby Dick,&quot; and you've got analbum full of timeless grand slams (I'm including &quot;ThankYou&quot; just for the ladies, to be frank), free enough of sleepyhippy jams and Celtic fairy dust that even the fussiest punk rockerwould have to give it props.  Oh, and Page's guitar work andproduction are at their usual high standard, except rawer; Bonham is,well, Bonham, which means the best rock drummer ever; John Paul Jonesplays his best bass ever, and begs the question why ANYBODY EVERthough Jack Bruce was the best; and Robert Plant is simply miraculous,full of bluesy howl with none of the hint of self-parody thatfollowed, maybe the best rock vocal performance ever.  In short, amasterpiece, and I urge all of you young musicians who might beinterested to buy this CD, learn from it, and then go forth and saverock and roll from its current pathetic state.
B00000JSHZ|5.0|child's play is a tale of murders and voodoo.a man who was a murderer got shot and put his soul into a doll to cheat death and PAYBACK.he walks.he talks. he KILLS. and he doesn't even need batteries. this was such a great film. i remember i saw back when i was 8 years old and scared me to death. i mean i love the movie now. but i have this movie to blame/thank cuz if it had now scared me so , i may never ever have been into horror movies and would have missed out on great things. here is a movie we all can relate to. when you are a little kid you toys can be your best friend..and that is true.. but what happens when your own toy betrays you. i think the message this movie was tryin ta get out is that it just might now be easy to be a little kid , who knows?i think this movie may be underrated sometimes becuz people really cant relate to it.. LITTLE KIDS can. and another thing is things happen and you get blamed and really didnt do it, but know it all grown ups are always right.lol..and if they say you did then you did..i know i sure can relate to that .. so sit back..be a kid again..and enjoy..this movie has a powerful message..i can relate to it and now you may be able to apriciate it more.
6304139586|4.0|I remember watching this movie when I was six or seven years old and loving every second of it. I even went as Peter Pan for Halloween because of it. First, it's directed by Steven Spielberg, the best director of all time. It features many star actors such as Robin Williams and Dustin Hoffman, and it's overall a great film.<br />Basically the plot is this: Peter Pan grows up to become a lawyer, and when Captain Hook kidnaps his children, he is forced to go back to Never Never Land to rescue them. The problem is, he doesn't remember anything. This makes for some good comedy, along with some much-needed friction between characters. The battling is interesting, but not gory for small children, and at the age of 15, I still don't mind watching this movie. It's not a child's flick only...adults can enjoy it as well. No annoying Pokemon here. <br />Some reviewers said that this was too violent for children. I don't believe that. I think it's a good film about a classic character that children should see--however, there is some mild language, but nothing terrible.
0789723107|5.0|I bought this book because I thought it would help me tame my own hobby site...; all I can say is wow, wow, wow.     Steve Krug tells you everything you need to know about effective interface design, from the most valuable point of view of all ... that of the user.    I'm really fired up about applying all SK's killer interface ideas to my own site. The only problem is, he's made me realize how badly laid out my site is at the moment. My re-design is going to take flipping years.    But anyway, this book is a classic. I have already passed it around my day-job firm's web team and studio, and they all agree that this is the best tome they have read on the subject to date.    If you only buy one book on web site usability, make it this cracker. Great advice, fab typesetting and you should easily be able to read it over your commute (I did).

We bask in the sway of waves bearing her lively pitch, her precise and playful interaction with the language - and we bemusedly acknowledge that such magic has never even yet come close to being rejuvenated by anyone, despite so many attempts made within the some 200 years since her novels were written.<br />  PERSUASION quaintly commences on a quiet country estate in Regency England, and on a fanciful whim journeys on through to the seaside resort of Lyme, thence onward through the social promenade of Bath.  The story follows Anne Elliot, daughter of snobby baronet, Sir Walter Elliot.  Anne is the middle daughter, in between older sister Elizabeth, the apple of her father's eye, and married younger sister, Mary Musgrove.  Jane Austen makes very good use of her exquisite wit in the depictions of shallow, haughty Elizabeth and selfish, frivolous Mary.<br />  Anne, however, is cut from a different cloth.  Having fallen in love at age 19 or 20 with a handsome young man of no fortune, Anne denies her passion for what she sees as her duty and breaks her engagement with Frederick Wentworth - after, of course, some persuasion from Lady Russell, a friend of her late mother.  Then, some eight years later, after Anne has apparently lost her youthful bloom, Captain Wentworth returns - still very handsome, and now quite rich after having made his fortune in the Navy during the Napoleonic Wars.<br />  As Captain Wentworth brandishes warm, flirtatious attention upon the young, lively Musgrove sisters, Louisa and Henrietta, sisters of Mary's husband Charles, Anne silently harbours the certainty that her deep affection and love for Wentworth had never faded despite all those years apart from him, and that his aloofness bears witness that his feelings for her have forever disappeared.  She all the while keeps those pangs of loss and regret subdued, and stays steadfast in her knowledge of what is right and what is good in the complex modes of interaction with others.  After her father's frivolity with money has necessitated moving his family to Bath and leasing out his estate, Kellynch hall, Anne must search for her place in the world.<br />  Although PERSUASION may not be the wittiest, nor the liveliest, nor the brightest or most luminous of the six novels written by Jane Austen, one cannot deny that it is perhaps the most moving.  Our heroine's allure takes the reader gently into that era of innocent romance, that beautiful country where sometimes what once had been lost might inexplicitly, almost magically, be found...if sought.what is right and what is good in the complex modes of interaction with others.

0684853523|5.0|This book is one of the best I have ever read on the art and craft of writing.  King shares his journey from neophyte to professional in a succinct but informative manner.  As a struggling writer, I was grateful to read this book and realize that some of the great ones are not born but made, through discipline, perserverance and faith.      The right amount of advice mixed in with anecdotes and (dare I say?) philosophy is contained within these pages.  A great read for anyone looking to honor the validity of the writing process and to recognize that each person is unique.  King lays down some practical guidelines while giving out the message that any writer must in some part trust their voice and go with  instinct.      It is a crossover piece of reading which should hold appeal for King fans, for writers, for biography readers and even for students of the human condition.  As with his fiction, King writes from a genuine place, no doubletalk or hidden agendas here.      If you want to read a book about writing, as honest and thoughtful as the many characters this prolific author has created, pick up a copy of &quot;On Writing&quot; today.

B00003CXP1|5.0|Darren Aronofsky has now proven himself to be a brilliant director.  With his first film, &quot;Pi,&quot; Aronofsky created a dark, disturbing world plunging the viewer into the chaotic world of mathematics as it relates to the main character's insanity.  In &quot;Requiem for a Dream,&quot; (based on Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel of the same name), he has once again created a disturbing masterpiece (&quot;Requiem&quot; is easily one of the most disturbing films ever made), however he has grown in his filmmaking techniques.  &quot;Requiem&quot; is a masterfully made film following the drug-addicted lives of four main characters.  Ellen Burstyn deserves an Oscar for delivering the best performance of the year and quite possibly her carreer (she acts better than she did in &quot;Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore&quot; - for which she received an Oscar prior to this film).  For anyone who can withstand challenging visuals and graphic violent and sexual images, &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; is a materpiece of modern cinema.
B0000070QS|5.0|I have been a fan of A-HA since the release of HUNTING HIGH AND LOW. As the years went by, the music of A-HA got better and MORTEN'S voice grew stonger. When I found out that he had 3 solo albums out, 2 of which are in Norweigan, I had to buy them. It was money well spent. His unique style and voice character is by far the one of the best in music. With the release of WILD SEED, MORTEN has taken the solo artist label and has put himself in a category apart from all the others. He sings with the grace and style that is lacking in today's music. Buy it !
B00000I8UD|5.0|David Sylvian simply never fails to impress me.  Even Darshan, a seeming half-hearted effort (w/ Robert Fripp), has a few moments of brilliance but, Dead Bees on a Cake is a whole different beast all together and harks back to his Brilliant Trees days for it's beauty, restraint, and pervasive ambiance.  However, some fans will definitely be disappointed.  Gone are the esoteric musings and experimentation.  Gone are the cold and bleakness he dabbled in with Gone to Earth and which he immersed himself in with Secrets of the Beehive.  Although this effort's intention is inextricably connected with the latter, I believe it to be only to the extent of the exorcism of those proverbial ghosts that David has wailed about these past twenty years and which came to a climax with Secrets of the Beehive.  The bees and their secrets are dead indeed.  Like Sade's new album, this one's a long time coming.  And also like Sade, you can tell that David has changed.  The most apparent aspect reflected in the album is that David is in love. There's a very relaxed and uninhibited quality to the songs where his earlier work, although just as beautiful, seemed to have an edge and somewhat angst ridden.  Don't get me wrong, there are some cuts here that hasten one back to previous material but, overall, it is much more accessible in terms of its messages -  it seems that Ingrid has brought him much peace.  Maybe the &#34;cake&#34; is &#34;love&#34;. This effort is much more diverse than anything before - especially stylistically.  From the Mississippi delta driven Midnight Sun, (with a wonderful touch of Gil Evan's like brass section), to the exotic, sexy, Hindu inspired Krishna Blue, to the loungy Rhodes chillin' Wanderlust.  Mere words cannot convey how good this album is.  Thalhiem is simply remarkable.  Its by far my favorite track in addition to Alphabet Angel and Wanderlust.  I wanted Alphabet Angel to go on forever, but for the first time ever, David isn't as self-indulgent. The song's structure could easily warrant endless exploration, however David simply stops and the senses collapse, craving more - which I'm sure was his intent: his premise probably being simply &#34;why do it&#34; when any sensitive listener can improvise the rest.  The melody is undeniably that true to form, spookily familiar, and is unshakable.  The usual suspects are here:  Sakamoto and David's brother Steve Jansen.  Great ECM luminaries like Steve Tibbetts, Kenny Wheeler, and Bill Frisell.  Even Tony Barberella from the Prince camp joined in, (for obvious reasons).  Minneapolis is in full effect with Tibbets, Chavez, Barberella with God Man sounding suspiciously familiar! (this is the only track I didn't really care for).  David's albums have always possessed this very self-effacing, introspective &#34;way&#34; about them that would seem out of place being played on the radio or at parties.  This album, much more than ever, is one to explore alone but, for the first time, some songs are comfortable enough to share with someone you love.  Very romantic indeed.  I don't know what Shree Maa is singing about but it makes me want to weep - in sadness and in joy.  It's taken me a while since I first heard the album, to write this review and believe that, if some fans would have waited to issue their initial impressions, their reviews would be different.  This is a classic if there ever was one.  Every artist must grow and change -  their fans too, but it should be no surprise to anyone that, more often than not, it is not synchronized.  It's still David: just a different David.
B00003CXBK|1.0|This movie sucks. I have a 11 year old daughter and 7 year old son, and the level of violence in this &quot;cartoon&quot; was simply unacceptable. The story was an obscure &quot;myth&quot; of what happens without environmentalism- the makers of this film ought leave their social commentary in Japan. Like violence will help trees grow-don't buy or even rent this movie.
B000056MOD|5.0|The Highlander &quot;Series&quot; are an extremely creative saga that I hope never dies.  I am a female and even with all the fighting scenes there is enough romance and fantasy for the ladies to ponder and wish for in real life.  I really enjoy the past/present switches throughout the movie, they keep you tuned into the whole picture and whole centuries long storyline.  This movie is not for the analytical mind, nor for the right brainers out there, your left brain needs to be turned on to reach for the fantasy of these movies and series.  I hope you enjoy as much as I do, the movie is very entertaining and I hope to see more films in the future.
014028009X|2.0|What's the point?  Or, better yet: What's the big deal?  Maybe it is a gender thing.  I'm a guy, so i don't get the humor of Bridget Jones's Diary.  The book is not funny.  I found it quite tedious and i often wanted somebody to boot Bridget in the head.  I did sympathize with the character at times.  Quite a few times to be perfectly honest.  Reading this book, i found myself waiting for a payoff that never came.  I finish one chapter and think, &quot;How dull.&quot;  I finish another, &quot;How dreary.&quot;  I finish the book, &quot;How tedious...and i'll never get that time back.&quot;  That's when i know i got nothing out of a book, when i realize that i've just wasted whatever amount of time i spent reading it.  With all of the hype surrounding this book, i just feel let down and betrayed.  It just wasn't interesting.
B00003CXRP|4.0|In Cast Away, although I must admit that I had great expectations about Tom Hanks' acting, I did not expect to find the inspiration that I did. Robert Zemeckis has surpassed himself so greatly that when you get out of the theatre you will forgive him for making Contact, Forest Gump and What Lies Beneath. Tom Hanks has once more given a performance that will literally touch your soul. Even though I had not been that excited by the trailer, when the movie ended I was left speechless. It is true that on those rare occasions that Hollywood tries it can still create magic. Furthermore, what else can I say but the fact that Tom Hanks can hold a film together all by himself. He will be definitely a favourite among the Oscar nominees this year. Oh, and by the way do not expect a common ending...<br />P.S: All those who love good cinema must definitely NOT lose this film!
B000000OXH|4.0|This is a good second part from their debut album, the music style is the same. <br />I recommend this CD but dont expect more than the Asia first album (a masterpiece).<br />It was the second and last release from the original line up: Wetton, Downes, Howe &amp; Palmer.
6303614493|5.0|This is a great movie, I babysit for a 2 and a 6 year old and everytime I go over there, we always watch Casper. My favorite part in this movie is at the end when Casper gets to be &quot;alive&quot; until 10. And he dances with Kat, and literally lifts her off her feet. I love the song that they slow dance to. Its called Remember Me This Way, but I don't know who sings it...END
B00000B9BD|5.0|Ditto all the praise before my blurb.  This remains a solid LPof space-folk, less kitsch than DAYS OF FUTURE PASSED (which stillgrabs my heart, make no mistake) and better produced.  Will someoneplease tell me what &quot;Hey, Little Man&quot; is about, though?...<br />Nice concept work, too, great packaging.  &quot;Benedictus&quot;instilled in us a sense of wonder and reverence we were sorely missingat that time.<br />Were only albums this well crafted today....
B00000IBRI|4.0|Ha Ha ! I just typed a long review at the film libary in Amsterdam, but I lost it ! I can not be bothered to type it all again,sorry. Suffice to say that this is one of the most scary films I have ever seen and I really reccomend that you buy this great DVD.
B000000OMB|5.0|This is a great reunion of four talented progressive legends. One of Cd´s that i listen to from start to end, great compositions, great vocals from John Wetton, keyboards from Geoff and drums from Carl, and as always, terrific guitar work from Steve Howe.<br />Sadly, this epic line up just record one more CD: Alpha.<br />The music is totally accesible, the sound is basicly progressive rock with a &quot;pop&quot; touch in many tracks.<br />A must in all rock and progressive rock collection.

B000002X2B|5.0|&quot;Have You Seen the Stars Tonight&quot; is probably one of the more lovely and romantic rock compositions ever penned in my humble opinion, and its neo-folkie-psychedelia dates very well.<br />This is a very, very, very trippy record in an offhand sorta folkish manner.  I guess one had to be there to understand that, which, apparently, some of the writers before me WERE there.<br />It's the best &quot;Jefferson Airplane&quot; record of the bunch, too, even as Kanter does dominate. Slick contributes some nice wailing here and there.
B000056MOD|2.0|Just to let you know, I'm going to say what happens to the characters, so SPOILERS for those who haven't seen it.<br />I heard rumors that there is a video coming out where Connor may not die. So I rented the {Bonus footage} {new Ending} Instead of Duncan at Connor's headstone, walking off into the sunset after saying his goodbye's and having flashbacks of Connor with beautiful Celtic music playing, they have the flashbacks when Connor dies, and instead of walking off into the sunset, Duncan ends up on what looks like some kind of movie or photo shoot set, and he starts to walk away, and down the stairs comes &quot;faith&quot;, the woman he married centuries ago, mortal, until he killed her violently so her immortal power could be released, and she could be with him litterally forever. But she didn't want forever.<br />first off...Duncan wouldn't have killed her. he would have told her I think, about her immortality and left the choice up to her.<br />Secondly... Connor became disenchanted with life, mankind, and hope. It seems a rather drab way for such a loved warrior to go out. <br />Third... Connor should have been brought back in the alternate ending somehow. Not faith. In the movie she dies, in this version the same thing happens, only it turns out Kell didn't kill her after all. It sucked out all of the emotion from the movie ending which left a tear in your eye when Duncan walks away from Connor's grave. This version just makes you go, &quot;Huh?&quot;<br />Forth...one of the watchers kidnaps duncan because he doesn't want the immortals to get down to the last one. He says there should always be two. Yet in the added scene origionally cut, he tries to kill Duncan as he's fighting Kell. No reason why or anything. Joe Dawson walks in, shoots him, says merry christmas and leaves. Another... &quot;HUH?&quot; Why would he 1.) try to kill Duncan knowing that would be one less Immortal, one closer to an immortal winning the prize which is what he tried to avoid, and 2.) why didn't he go for Kell knowing Kell has killed the most immortals of them all?<br />and lastly...the script writers...were they tv show writers to begin with? Because this wasn't movie material.<br />If you get the movie, see if there is the origional version played in theaters. The added scenes sucked, the origional ending shown in theaters was much more emotional, and gave it the perfect holding your breath kind of ending.<br />At least there is hope. Even Christopher Lambert himself said &quot;I'm only 44. I still have at least 6 good years left. and hey, they brought Spock back in Star Trek. So you never know.&quot; (He said this in an interview on tv with Adrian Paul.) so that gives us hope...right?
B000002UJQ|5.0|After making one of the most influential and widely praised albums of the 90's{THE BENDS}.How do you follow it up? Well, if your Radiohead you make a stunning conceptual piece about isolation and fear, that would prove just how talented these guys really are. Throughout, the band shines. From the prog-rock spectacle that is &quot;Paranoid Android&quot;, to the shimmering brilliance of &quot;The Tourist&quot;, the album never ceases to amaze. Without a doubt one of the best records of the past century, Ok Computer is the perfect example of a band at the absolute top of their game. A masterpiece.

B000056VIY|4.0|I enjoyed &quot;On The 6&quot;, but like many of you, I found most of the ballads to be snooze-inducing. I was hoping that &quot;J.Lo&quot; would be a more dance-driven album. I can't say that all my hopes and expectations were fufilled. I was hoping that this album would have followed the lead of &quot; Waiting For Tonight&quot; &amp; &quot;Feelin' So Good&quot;. I really didn't think that I was going to like the album when I first listened to it. My expectations weren't met, but I decided to really listen to the album and to my pleasant surprise, it really grew on me. &quot;My Love Don't Cost A Thing&quot;, &quot;Walking On Sunshine&quot;, &quot;Ain't It Funny&quot;, &quot;Carino&quot;, &quot;Thats The Way&quot; &amp; last but, not least &quot;That's Not Me&quot; are great. I found myself singing &quot;Walking On Sunshine&quot; all day after I first heard it. The only tracks that I find myself skipping over are the raunchy &quot;Come Over&quot; and the tribute to the good-smelling men of the world &quot;Secretly&quot;. Her choice of ballads for this album were less than excellent, but the rest of the album makes up for it!  &quot;J.Lo&quot; wasn't meant to be a serious &quot;artistic&quot; effort. As a singer, Jennifer Lopez isn't like Madonna who puts on a showy pretense of being an &quot;artist&quot;. Lopez is, what she is, an entertainer.
B00000JCOV|1.0|Why not re-label this as &quot;Music for retards- made by retards&quot; Music has hit an all-time low with this trash- I don't see how it could get any worse. Slipknot actually makes Marylin Manson sound talented!!
B0000062FJ|4.0|This album contains great original latin rock sounds. The first 3 Santana albums were absolutely magical. This ranks behind Abraxas and Santana 3 but continues to be an album which is regularly played. As a blues fan you can hear the blues roots played by Carlos and the band.
B000020617|5.0|A truly musical CD. Seldom do you hear rock this intense that is so melodic and musical. Dave Grohl is a genius. It actually reminds me melodically of stuff from the Beatles.. very creative, great hooks. Rock music as it should be. If you don't buy this CD, you're nuts.
B00001NFCY|2.0|...And I can't say it's my best. &quot;Wrong way&quot; and &quot;Never Die&quot; are great songs, but as a whole, this album comes off a little weak. &quot;My own prison&quot; is a better cd.
B000000WHC|4.0|The title track is magic. 'Oh Pretty Woman', 'As the years go passing by' are also great blues tracks. The rest lack that magic factor. Even though Gary owns and sometimes plays Peter Green's guitar, the rest of the tracks do not fall into the same bues category.
B0000524E5|1.0|This was the biggest waste of time I have ever seen.  The only person that would be interested in this movie is a thirteen-year old boy.  Tyra Banks should stick to her day job.  She is much better as a model for Victoria's Secret because she never has to open her mouth &amp; speak.  I want the wasted hour &amp; a half of my life back.  This movie was very predictable &amp; lame.  Don't waste your time.
B000002BUY|3.0|This is pretty good funkified metal (funk-a-fied? funk-i-fied?)  Anyway, it's a good cd, and some of the songs (New Skin, Idiot Box,) are worth it. If you wan't to look back into their past from &quot;Make Yourself,&quot; check this out.
B00004RHZU|4.0|this is a good album, particularly from a new artist. and i think she's got places to go, and as far as i could see, she's the most promising of all new female r&amp;b act. why? because lately it seems to me that the scene is too boring, the new faces are just way too 'commercial', if i can say that. pink is different though, she writes her own stuff and she doesn't deal with what has become too boring of late : ... here ... there and generally nothing new. don't get me wrong, she does touch on relationship and stuff but not like the way most r&amp;b and rap artist do, like &quot;i'm a playa and i can get any woman i want&quot; blah... blah... blah... which is very annoying coz it's well... stupid. so i find the songs here refreshing fer a change and believe me, there are some really good stuff here. my favourite tracks has to be 'most girls' which is excellent with its wonderful beat and production; 'you make me sick', another winner in my eyes, excellent lyrics and i think many can relate to the love-hate relationship and also 'hiccup', a weird but nice song that deals with 'tongue-tiedness' and i know *i* can relate to that!!! i'm sure most people will recognise there you go... it's great but i feel that it pales next to most girls. all in all i think that this is a good album to keep.
B00005176F|5.0|If you're a longtime fan, this is a great collection to get, and the live disc sweetens the pot. If you just started getting into Blur from Song 2 (Woo-Hoo!), then get this. It'll basically act as a primer, and get you up to date on their songs.
B000000OPZ|5.0|Back in 87 when this came out I wore out 2 tapes and have since bought the cd. This is top end choice rock at it's finest!
0553296981|5.0|You might think The Diary of Anne Frank is just a diary, but here words go beyond just a diary.The best part of this story is the ending. Theer's so much thrill in it ,you just cant put it down. It certainly shocked me! You can actually feel what she feels at that exact moment. The character that changed the most throuht the story would be Anne Frank.She changed by maturing,understanding,and responsabilties.Anne Frank is the main character.She has many outstanding personilty traits.The setting has an importent effect on the main character because during the war you're not sure where you'll end up, in a  camp,a secret hidding place, or even end up dead!! Anne was in a secret hide away that now is a hstorical land mark today.Her story is part of history and very important for the whole world. The theme was a  moral,''dont judge a book by its cover.'' I learnd that in this book I wasen't sure what that expression was before, but The diary Anne's made it true, and like they say shall the truth set you free.
1878424432|4.0|This book has actually been in my thoughts everyday since I read it.  There are a whole bunch of things that I agree with in this book, but there are also things that I do not agree with.  The thing is that whatever you do not agree with, is completely accepted by the principles of the book.  Everyone, I am sure, could take something different out of it.  I think that it is definitely worth reading because anyone would get at least one helpful thing that may change their life out of it.  If they don't they will surely get something worth thinking about out of it.  Overall I do believe it is worth reading.
B000003TAW|4.0|You know what?  This CD is just plain fun to listen to.  All the folks who proclaim this to be a momumental moment in the history of music are mistaken.  It's just a CD made by some geeky guys having fun!  And that's fine by me
0140067477|5.0|This book is garuanteed  to give you a different outlook on life, if you actually think about what you are reading.  I recently mailed this book to a friend that lives in the UK, and I have never seen anyone more appreciative in my whole life.  It offers any type of person a perspective that let's you live life the way every person should.  And who better to explain this than Pooh bear?  I would hope that this book makes all people realize that we are what we are, and we need everyone else in order to be what we are. This book offers appreciation of everything in existence.  I hope that you are capable of understanding (and wanting to understand) the things there are to be learnt by this book.
B000059WH0|5.0|When you dig up God's little acre, you lose all peace of mind, you stare into the distance looking for a sign, but the sign it never comes, babe, your wishes won't come true, praying for the rain .......while the sun beats down on you<br />Too bad this was the only song not written by Toto on the whole album, yet they named the album after it. It's impressive stuff. I find a lot of what they do here to have a grunge edge that they never had before and didn't go back to after the late great Jeff Porcaro passed on. Lots of the guitar work is like today's CREED... but Steve Lukether is unmistakeable. A true original.. didja know he did the lead on &quot;physical&quot; years ago? Or the rythem for &quot;Beat it?&quot; He also sang the vocals on &quot;Sugar Sugar&quot;.. but maybe I go back too far for most of you. If you can forget about Don't Chain My Heart, a song that doesn't belong here, and you like wild, hard dark stuff.. like if your into goth or something, pick this up... but if you want something along these lines but more of a thirty something album, go with &quot;Tambu&quot;.
B000002E5J|3.0|This is not a bad cd at all,tunes such as &quot;estoy aqui&quot; and &quot;pies descalzos,suenos blancos&quot;and&quot;vuelve&quot; not to mention &quot;antologia&quot; all stand out.However in my opinion she is still quite immature as a lyricist,I predict she will become a mega star on the trendy american pop market eventually.She mixes a bit of hard rock with folk,dance,and pop to come up with a sound all her own,and it sells,but there's just something missing...
B0000508U6|5.0|I purchased this CD because I heard \\"Yellow\\" on the radio and liked it, but the rest of the CD is great. The guitar melodies are very emotional and deep. Besides \\"Yellow\\", the song that comes to my mind is \\"Shiver,\\" as the melody stays in my head. Ever since I got this CD, I can't stop listening to it.
B000009ROK|1.0|He takes beautiful songs that have already been done,and makes them sound like plastic,cheap,wannabe,immitation.I'm trying to figure out what it is that makes him so popular!If you like real romantic music in spanish,try los panchos(whom he attempts to cover)or los dandys.Oh well,music is a personal thing,and I've tryed getting my wife to stop listening to this,but I have been unsuccesful...so there is something to the lads credit!
B000002OX5|5.0|The Who Sells Out is something of a concept album, where you are supposed to be listening to a pirate radio station.  The album even comes complete with commercials.  But the interesting concept aside, the songs are among the tightest in the band's catalog.  &quot;I Can See For Miles&quot; maybe the quintessential Who song, with its feedback, crashing guitars, thumping drums and sinister lyrics.  It became their only top ten single, peaking at number 9.  &quot;Rael&quot; is an epic song, &quot;Tattoo&quot; is blazing and &quot;Mary Anne With The Shaky Hand&quot; is great.  The bonus material is solid, but not spectacular with the exception of &quot;Glow Girl' which is the genesis of Tommy.
6305364648|4.0|Arnold Schwarzenegger might very well be the only Republican I can stand to watch for the duration of a two plus hour film.  He's funny, intellegent, well spoken and consistently churns out some of the best action movies around.  Much of this success can be attributed to his partnership with Titanic director James Cameron, who's provided him with some his best material to date in the 1994 action/comedy True Lies.<br />In it he plays Harry Tasker, a spy posing as a computer salesman to his wife and daughter, which is a funny concept in it of itself, let alone to have the Terminator cast in the title role.  But what's so remarkable about his performance is that he does an astonishingly convincing job of passing himself off as an oafish slug.  Yet even despite the domesticated way in which he presents himself to his family, it doesn't diminish his credibility as an intellegence agent, thanks in large part to his commanding presence which is never too far from the surface.<br />The action gets off to a rousing start with a white knuckled opening sequence that's sure to leave you breathless.  After a short break to develop the characters and the situation we're thrown back in the fray with a chase through the city streets of DC, leading from malls to parks and eventually winding up on the roof of the Mariott.  It's really quite spectacular.<br />Of course, they can't maintain this frenetic pace for long, so James Cameron makes the smooth transition into comedy with the introduction of Bill Paxton as a mystery man named Simon.  You see, Simon's trying to bait Harry's wife, Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis), into an affair.  Little does he know that this &quot;bored housewife&quot; is married to a spy who after overhearing her talk about him to a coworker puts the full wait of the CIA (or whatever agency it is that he works for) behind investigating their relationship.  Sure it's &quot;a misappropriation of government resources,&quot; as Tom Arnold chimes in, but when a movie's this much fun you don't question it's plausibility.<br />The laughs keep coming for about an hour when the seamless transition is made back into action.  The story somehow manages to shift into a plot involving Arab terrorists without disrupting the flow of the movie.  The terrorists threaten to blow up one major US city each week until we withdraw our troops from the Persian Gulf.  Its seems a reasonable request given the fact that we're not doing much good over there, but I won't get into that here.<br />The terrorists are as sterotypical as ever which Cameron tries to counteract by adding a few token minorities, who serve no real purpose but are nice window dressing for 20th Century Fox.  I suppose we've been spoiled by David O. Russell's groundbreaker Three Kings, which for the first time in a long time shed the Arab community in a primarily positive light.  But I can't very well hold this against a Schwarzenegger film which has no other purpose than to entertain, and it does.<br />Kudos to Tom Arnold as the wisecracking sidekick to Arnold's action hero role, and Jamie Lee Curtis who has never been more believeable than she is here as a frumpy housewife.  But the performance that resonates most with me was from Bill Paxton, showing an inclination towards comedy in one of his best roles to date.  As for Arnie, he does a nice job chewing on the scenery, delivering what lines he's given, but his performance is so rooted in his screen persona that I can't imagine anyone else being able to pull it off.<br />This is the type of movie I wish James Cameron would revert back to.  One with modest ambitions, not overwrought with sentimentality (or arrogance) like Titanic, but a whole hearted summer blockbuster that knows what it is and delivers.
B000002OX3|4.0|A Quick One is a hodge-podge kind of album from the band.  The songs are all over the place, but they contain some spirited performances.  John Entwistle contributes two songs that are among the album's highlights.  &quot;Whiskey Man&quot; is a high-octane song and &quot;Boris The Spider&quot; is a manic, pulsating gem.  Pete Townshend's &quot;A Quick One while He's Away&quot; is his first attempt at a rock opera.  The song is a mini-opera with several different movements and characters and is a great song.  The bonus material is mostly made up of songs that were featured on English EP's and they show a fun side to the band. They have a roaring take on the theme to the Batman TV show, another quasi-instrumental, &quot;Bucket T&quot; which is in a surf rock vein and Keith Moon's screeching version of &quot;Barbara Ann&quot;.
0884271153|3.0|It's Not Luck is the sequel to Eliyahu Goldratt's great business novel, The Goal.  After their success in The Goal, Alex and his team have all been promoted into the key positions in the faltering Diversified Businesses group in their conglomerate.  The whole company is faltering, and great pressure is put on Alex and the team to turn their businesses around.  The story emphasizes the Thinking Processes from The Goal, and the importance of using them in business and in personal life.  The problems addressed are primarily ones of (1) tailoring the bundle of business product and service offerings for customers in ways that create profit margin advantages across the business (2) by building on benefits from adding value for customers in improved ways and (3) creating these advances in ways that competitors cannot easily duplicate.  The examples include a printing business for packaging, a beauty salon products business, and providing a service and parts intensive product.<br />The book's main story is interesting, and will keep you turning the pages.  If you only read this as a novel about the caring manager and parent as a hero, you will find this to be a five star book.<br />If you want the book to help you learn new methods, you will find it not too beneficial.  The examples are developed at such a level of generality that you will probably learn little from them.  I graded the book down two stars for this weakness.

The first notion is to think of your customer and yourself as one entity.  How can the two entities be combined in order to create the most value for both?  The second notion is to then think about combining your business with acquisitions or being acquired by others so that the new business model can be applied to all these enterprises.  I hope you do learn how to develop these commendable ideas.<br />After you finish reading this book, I suggest that you think about all of the ways that current measurements in your business cause you to optimize the performance of parts of your enterprise rather than the whole business and that of your customers.  If you can locate those flaws, you can then begin to change the measurements to become those that reward the correct enterprise-customer optimization goal.  The rest of the benefits will tend to flow from making that change, even if you never become very good at using the Thinking Process described in this book.

B000002UAR|5.0|Like I said, this is not an album like &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; where basically every song is a international hit.  This is a great album that flows perfectly and captures The Beatles in a transition. For that reason this album shows the most evenly distributed between Sgt. Peppers and &quot;I wanna hold your hand&quot;. There really are no highlight songs on this one, its just a solid CD that you let play whenever.  However I must comment on &quot;Good Day Sunshine&quot; which my friends and I have dubbed the &quot;happiest song ever&quot;. If you are building a Beatles collection, or just want good ole rocking roll, pick this one up.
B00003W8NM|5.0|I was one of the only females I know who could see the brilliance in this unusual film.  I've watched it many times because its such an incredible journey into the lives of some very interesting people.  I think you have to just sit there, keep your mind open to really get the full effect of this movie.  Once you do, it stays with you long after its over.  I remember the film ending and just sitting for a second thinking &quot;Wow, that was incredible.&quot;<br />The characters are all brilliantly acted.  The story is one that will become a classic.  Its the story of a seemingly ordinary young man who hooks up with the enigmatic Tyler Durden.  Together they start the fight club, a club full of guys who beat the crud out of each other.  Helena Bonham Carter is great in this film because she plays a rather strange and deranged young woman so well.  All three of the actors makes this film so great.  I think Ed Norton is one of the best new actors to hit the screen in years.  His portrayal of this mad character was superb.  It really makes you see another side of life and it makes you see civilization in a way that few films do.  Its violent but done in a way that is just incredible.<br />Some reviewer said watching it was like an acid trip and I agree. Its a weird, ultra-violent world that just might lurk under the surface of any city we live in.  Its madness, chaos and a wild trip into a frightening subculture.  Its a film I watch quite often!
B0000070QS|5.0|This album was a great hit in Norway, and by listening to the fantastic melodies and excellent vocals by Harket you will understand why. Few thought that his solo album would become outstanding. But it did!!! Best song is &quot;Spanish steps&quot;. This album got far less attraction internationally than it deserves. I don't know why. Harket has also made a solo album in Norwegian called &quot;Vogts villa&quot;. (Harket-freaks should try to get it). All who likes a-ha can very safely buy &quot;Wild seed&quot; without having listened to a single song from it. Buy it today!!!
6305718903|4.0|How the critics could downplay this fine movie is beyond this writer.  They actually get paid?  The acting by Gabriel Byrne was over shadowed only by a terrific performance by Patricia Arquette, who out acted Linda Blair who depended on special effects. The only reason this movie could be over looked would be the lack of a superstar.  It was better than &quot;End of Days,&quot; but didn't have Arnold.  Insofar as shedding a poor light on the church, the inquesition and the Borgia Pope did that already.
B00004U8JV|1.0|This was HORRIBLE!!!!!<br />The book wasn't half-bad, for a script.  The movie didn't just deviate, it went irretrievably down the proverbial toilet.<br />The movie degenerates into a Jurassic Park (a GOOD movie) meets Mad Max (another goodie) with reality-challenged child-gymnast-thwaps-dinosaur-in-head, and then - hey! - let's let them loose on downtown San Diego!  That's not Godzilla-esque!<br />Save your money and don't even rent this stinker.<br />But if you do watch it, there is a funny scene where Jeff Goldblum picks up a pair of binoculars to sight the incoming helicopters, and HE HOLDS THEM UP TO HIS EYES *BACKWARDS*!
6305127638|5.0|Hello, To all Star Trek fans.  You've got to get this film.  It is the best film they've made since Star Trek II Wrath of Kahn.  This movie involves the Borg as they travel back in time to the time when Zephren Cohran is building his warpship.  Basically the Enterprise goes back to stop the borg from assimilating the EArth.   This movie is full of action and good special effects and really follows a straight plot line.  I was really impressed by this when i went to see it for the first time.  If you have seen earlier Star Trek Movies, you know that this movie is the first one in a while that really lives up to the Star TRekkers expectations.  Overall, a great movie and an excellent buy!!!!!!
6305350205|1.0|Captain Kirk allows his starship to be taken over with no oppositon at all.No security team,no warning even though he is in direct contact with his ship and,worst of all,he flys the villian up to the ship after telling him him that he wouldn't help him(does that make sense?).Is this the same captain that self-destructed his previous ship to avoid it's capture?In this film the Enterprise is portrayed as a faulty and clunky ship,a classic gimmick when you have a weak villian.This is a bad film,a voyage to nowhere where nothing happens.Avoid it.
B00000ILBK|2.0|Hello, I have been a huge fan of Star Trek and Star Wars for years and years. Star Trek Insurrection is i believe the ninth movie made.  If you have seen earlier episodes of Star Trek and the Next Generation Series, you know that this movie does not live up to the expectations.  It has no real plot other then that Captain Picard and some of his crew are on this planet that has some special properties that allow you to live for a long time.  Basically an alien race working with the federation is trying to force the natives of the planet so they can collect the life giving force.      The reason this film is not that good is the lack of motivation, almost all the previous movies gave reason for future ones to be made, but this one is completely pointless.  Also, don't be fooled by the lie that this film is full of action, because its not.  If you are expecting hard core battles like in Star Trek II Wrath of Kahn or Star Trek VIII with the Borg, you will be very dissappointed.  Finally my last point is, what on earth was paramount thinking when they allowed Jonathon Frakes to direct this movie. Hell, he is the First officer.  Why would they allow an ammature direct a movie?       In conclusion, Star Trek Fans, its sad to say this but Star Trek is truely done.  I don't think any new series or movies are going to come out that will ever come anywhere near the quality of the ones that William Shantner was in.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Goodbye, to another hard hit-negative review. Here is the revision of a review written months ago. Gladiator is a delivery of a story told in the form of many movies, but not in character. Maximus is a man troubled with loves past and desires nothing but to go home once the barbarians are destroyed. Before granting his wish the Emporer asks him to take rule of Rome, Leaving his own son without a throne. Joaquin Pheonix plays a terrific sadistic maniac that would do anything to claim the throne, even kill his own father. What starts out as a terrific victory, Gladiator follows Maximus' decent from the heights of high protector of Rome, to a slave in chains. Gladiator was the #1 movie of 2000 at the box office, which shows that many people were drawn to the story. Many viewings later on my own dvd, I say it is a good movie. Catch the scene when Maximus prays to God. We need more scenes of humility like that in todays cinema.
B00003Q43A|3.0|Independence Day is a simple plotted movie, in which aliens try to take over the world.  The lead star is Will Smith who is a fighter pilot who fights and eventually destoys the alien mother ship.  The special effects are awesome in this movie, particularly the fighter combat sequences.   But like many new sci-fi movies this one lacks good acting and story line.  The actor who plays the president is disgusting. His character in my opinion is so wimpy and uhhhh it makes me cringe watching some of the scenes where they try to create a plot.  Particularly where the president's wife dies.  You really have to see this scene yourself, but it is so fake. This movie could have been so much better if the director would have put more money and effort into developing a more complex plot, with better actors other then Will Smith; who is awesome in this film.    Overall, this movie is okay if your a scifi freak, but other then the action it is not that good and not really worth buying.
6303942830|5.0|If I can convince two Matrix-Loving teens to watch and enjoy this movie, I can surely convince you. Is That what you want? Here you go. Pure adrenaline rush, Putting a hole through an elk, Pure Love, and several battle scenes. All you need do is make it past a scene of talking between Duncan and Webb at the beginning, then you off to bashing through the forest, jumping out hidden caves through a water fall, burnings and sharp-shootings, heart pumping/wrenching climax. And it has the full un-cut version of the revenge scene that the dvd slightly slandered. Your gonna love it!
B00003CXHJ|3.0|First of all U571 is a decent story about American involvment in world war II at capturing enigma machines.  The previous customer reviewer John Loizou is full of crap.  1 the Americans were involved in capturing the enigma machines 2. His jealousy is apparent, in saying that the United States played no part in winning the war 3. He does not know his facts, the Americans captured enigma machines twice.  Don't listen to that jealous foreign freak.  This movie is not to bad. The realism of the inside of the sub is pretty cool.  And yes I have seen &quot;The Boat&quot; an earlier submarine version that previous customers have mentioned as &quot;Das boot&quot;  It is true that there are some inaccuracies about this movie and some of the acting is a little cheesy, particularly the black cook.  This is a huge blunder.  I have every respect for African Americans, but the truth of the matter is that they navy was segregated and they didnot serve on submarines.  Him saying to the captured Germans &quot;you've never seen a black man before, get used to it&quot; is just a political statement by the producers or rather their attempts at being politically correct.  They were trying to include someone outside of the white race to make the movie politically correct.  But don't get caught up in this point, I just hate to see historical films portrayed inaccurately so that someone can make a political statement. Overall not a bad movie and a decent buy.
B00005221M|5.0|From start to finish this DVD is terrific. I bought it even after getting VHS. (My in-depth review can be found by clicking on my name.) In comparison, the DVD if far more superior to the tape, simply for quality. The extra's are great also. (Even the guide screen is awesome!) But two things struck me as odd. Why cut the ending #1? And How come the original release didn't hold all the extra material? It is still wonderful. You could buy the vhs to keep the ending whole, or you can buy the DVD and have all the features, all the extensions (Including an entire battle scene), and have crystal clear images. Whatever, buy the DVD for the collection!
B000002ADT|4.0|Reading the reviews it seems everyone has given 'kind of blue' five stars, I feel compelled not to. This is a very good CD at it's time innovative the solo's are all very clear, interesting, good. And so is the modal structuring of the compositions and the rhythmn section's subtleness.<br /> But I sense a strange conformability where every reviewer says this is their personal favorite just because 'everybody' else says it's good, everybody loves the same album not because of it's greatness but because it's regarded as great, do these people love the music because of what other people say about it, it seems so,  where other Miles davis albums which are musically equal and just as innovative to this are neglected, why, I cannot tell, maybe it's because people listen to the critics more than they listen to the music. Even Miles Davis himself seemed surprised that 'Kind of blue was so popular but some other albums of his were hardly noticed such as the excellent &quot;A Tribute to Jack Johnson&quot;.<br />In my opinion this is a very good jazz CD but there is nothing amazing about it, Other records from this awesome musician although less recognised, &quot;Milestones&quot; &quot;Miles Smiles&quot; &quot;Live Evil&quot;  &quot;Tribute to Jack Johnson&quot; &quot;In a Silent way&quot;  are all equally innovative and good and a more original choice.
B0000042MY|5.0|Last of the Mohicans is a perfect marriage between film and music. Some pieces of the album are haunting while others wrench your thoughts, living the adventure yourself. The tracks 3 and 6 are my fav's. The love theme, and Saving Alice...the climax of the film! Words arent enough, just get it and you will understand what I mean!!
6305041156|5.0|There is not a single day that I do not thank Akira Kurasawa for creating this &quot;the greatest piece of art ever created.<br />Word cannot describe this film, it's spender can only be experienced.<br />To look at, like a cinamatic interpretation of a Kandinsky Oil Painting.  The story the poetry of a Shakespere play .  The sound of Takemitsu. <br /> The Takemitsu Soundtrack is the greatest film score ever created. Better even than &quot;Miles Davis's&quot;<br />Kurasawa had turned to Shakespere's &quot;King Lear&quot; for inspiration   The tale of greed, jealously and human nature leading to     Chaos( Ran) The film has the story, moral dilemma's and majesty  of        shakespere.  But it is not for these reasons it is great.<br />Cinematically it is almost as if film has being set in the  paint palette of a some great artist, a vast chaotic sprawling kaleidoscope of colour unfolds, but the picture is not moving, but still, like a painting the figures of men can be made out but everything is abstract, abstract shapes, forms, thoughts. But then the scene clears:  A shape, ....a  Castle is engulfed by yellow, red, angrylily in conflict the fire of chaos of hell, to the left a vast horde of Red to the right Yellow, rendered in thick impasto . Everywhere there are contrasts between Red and Yellow of the opposing brothers ,walking through this vast seething mass of colour is a white colourless figure ,the figure of Hidetora the great lord who has lost his power his colour.  The scene the greatest in cinematic history, everything.... ..everything in conflict dynamic tensions between the opposing colours ,red and yellow, in the backround they are scrapping over the castle in the form of the swirling churning red yellow, fire while in the foreground the colourless figure ,isolated,could not commit harikiri has lost everthing.The men cannot touch him the invisible barrier between them evident. The composition, perfectly symmetric .Perfectly Symbolic. The single figure holds the scene that represents everything Shakespere intended, The weakness of human nature leads to chaos. The camera is in the heavens, mocking yet curious. The scene as if viewed by god, or behind a pane of glass in a art gallery.        A thin mist hangs over everything greating a feeling of distance yet the godlike perpective makes us feel almost responsible for the characters, for the ghostly flute player a symbol of the crimes commited by Hidetora's, for the dishonored suburu, for the chaos. The fact we are not responsible leads to a feeling of emptyness the emptyness is displayed onscreen .The vast landscapes expression remind us of how petty and insignificant all of it is in the face of Buddha.    The perfection of this film is undoubtable almost frightning as if it were made by a god. Perhaps it was ?        The greatest achievement of modern civilisation....
0375707972|1.0|This book has the basic outline of a great novel/story.  Unfortunately, it reads to me as a manuscript.  Unfinished, and unexpanded.  The story could have been developed more.  The author didn't delve deeply enough into the characters or history.  I was very disappointed by what should have been a great novel.
0375501851|3.0|Ms. Zadie Smith sure knows her way around the English language and I was impressed by the way she writes descriptive paragraphs and crafts quirky characters and situations, so I was disappointed that I felt bored with so much of this book.  Why?  Because there wasn't a clear story to follow. <br />After I got past the &quot;bells and whistles&quot; of Ms. Smith's often engaging prose, I longed for something else to keep me turning the pages---like &quot;what's this story about?&quot;  For me, the writing was too episodic---just a big collection of colorful characters and read more like a series of novelettes than one cohesive novel. <br />Yet,there is much to admire in WHITE TEETH---I was immediately drawn in by the beginning--Archie's darkly-comic suicide attempt (but then he disappears for large chunks of the book); Irie's sad, but also funny, trip to the beauty parlor to have her black, kinky hair straightened (she's not it the book that much either); and the hilarious Chalfens--I really loved them and would actually like to read a novel about them alone.  <br />I think that was the problem--Ms. Smith had an &quot;embarrassment  of riches&quot; with too many good characters.  Like she had to put every great character she constructed into this book instead of, perhaps, focusing on one or two and saving the others for future stories.  It was like being at a cocktail party where you talk to many people, hear an amusing anecdote from their lives, and move on without really knowing or caring too much.    <br />I think Ms. Smith is a very talented writer and I will look for her next work of fiction.  Hopefully she will deliver the steak along with the sizzle.
0792844882|5.0|This is the single best Bad Movie ever made, and as such, anyone with an interest in film should see it.  Liz Berkley is lovably awful, as is her entire supporting cast, and most of the dialogue must be heard to be believed.  If you take any of it seriously, you'll be disappointed, but if you're in the mood for the greatest unheralded comedy of the 1990's, just stick it in.  Your home entertainment system, that is.
B000006045|5.0|I just looked through the reviews and noticed that noone mentioned that this album is right up there with Peter Gabriel's Passion as a classic massage CD.  It's steady beat and entrancing vocals allow you to really get into a zone.
6304493681|5.0|Ghost in the Shell is engaging and exciting on all levels.  It goes beyond the typical action driven anime and gives you an interesting story.  To me, the tell tail sign of a good movie is whether I am still thinking about it the next day.  Ghost achieved this.  I love the idea of a consciousness spawned out of the net that strives to merge the best parts of human and computer intelligence.  The movie delves into the philosophy of being human without getting bogged down in it and becoming overly preachy.  This is by no means just an intellectual film.  The animation is absolutely breathtaking and, I would venture to say, the best I have seen to date.  The computer rendering really adds to the panoramic scenes, giving them sense of depth and distance that cell animation alone cannot achieve.  <br />The world Ghost paints is also exciting.  We see snap shots of a politically complex and technologically exciting culture that leaves the viewer dying to know more.  My one qualm with the film is with the dubbing.  While it is certainly better than average, it runs into a common anime problem of sounding overly cheesy.  The words are right, but the tone of voice detracts from the drama in some of the scenes.  This is hardly a critical problem and I still give this movie an enthusiastic 5 stars.
0688062334|5.0|Okay, I admit it: I'm a college student.  I'm almost 20 years old (my god, that's OLD!) and this is still one of my all-time favorite books.  I remember picking up Howl's Moving Castle at the library, many years ago, and Diana Wynne Jones shortly became one of my favorite authors.  Her writing is humorous and intelligent, her characters are fascinating and real, and she has an imagination about which words fail me.  People may talk about JK Rowling (who is also an amazing writer, not to be missed), but before you rhapsodize about Harry Potter, read about Howl.  This book is bewitching; Diana Wynne Jones has charmed me for all time.
B00003CXFG|3.0|I bought the movie, also because of the positive reviews and was disappointed. In my opinion this movie is a nicely made SciFi movie but horror??? The so called 'raptors' are somehow cute - not frightening at all and I am talking about the unrated movie. I didn't see anything in the movie which I did not see in other movies - except for the raptor design.  The raptors live underground during the daylight period of the planet and come to the surface, when the eclipse takes place. Well, they are no threat if you have a 'torch' and they have. Then also the abandoned station stuff with 'science went wrong' etc. also like Mission to Mars - abandoned outpost, what went wrong, dark secret and so on. This movie reminds me of 'Alien' but only slightly - which was scary imo.  The crash landing at the beginning has some very nice visuals but that's it. The horror of Van Diesel is also - well - lame as a serial killer and not scary at all. My conclusion: A movie worth to see it but not to collect it. I am from Germany and I think it was never shown in theatres in Germany which tells me something...
0792140923|5.0|&quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is a very special movie, a movie in which so many values, traditions, historical events and occurrences are all seen through the eyes of one man who is affected by all of the above mentioned aspects of life. This man is the very embodiment of American innocence in a time when that innocence was fading from sight, with such events as the Vietnam War and segregation issues plaguing the country, and through his simple words and actions, we are able to appreciate the lives in which we live on a much more elevated level. <br />The film is a complex and stunning journey that involves many characters, all of whom represent a separate and unique stereotype of the 50's, 60's and 70's. The events portrayed throughout the movie are handled with such meticulous detail and through the eyes of Forrest Gump, we see everything in a whole new light. His simplicity and limited education seem more of a blessing than a curse, and it may cause viewers to look at their own lives and take stock of themselves as well. <br />Forrest's journey begins in his early years, as a skinny child who must wear leg braces for his crooked back. His mother will do just about anything for him, including giving special favors to the public school principle in order to get her son enrolled. On his first day of school, he meets a young girl named Jenny, whom he falls in love with at first sight. He will carry this love with him for the rest of his life, protecting her from her abusive father and staying by her side through their school years. His high school career offers him a position on football team, which leads him to college, where he becomes ensconced in many different cultures and beliefs, as well as his first taste of segregation. Jenny begins to branch off into more risqué lines of work, evolving into the drifter hippie that so symbolized the 60's. <br />Forrest stays in touch with her, even after he is drafted and sent to Vietnam to fight in the war. There, he meets Bubba Blue, and they become fast friends due to their ostracization from the rest of the group's men. Their commanding officer, Lieutenant Dan Taylor, is harsh and strict, so it comes as no surprise that when a battle goes terribly wrong, he loathes Gump for pulling him out instead of leaving him to die. From this point on, Forrest will become a national hero as well as someone that every human being, decent or loathsome, can come to admire. <br />Forrest's simplicity and small outlook on life is such a blessing for him, and that is shown through the plot of this movie. He sees everything going on around him, but none of it ever really registers in his mind the way it would someone of a higher IQ. Forrest lives his life the way a child would that has been taught by his mother the values of life, and Forrest holds extremely true to those values, never breaching them for a second. His small outlook on such a vast melting pot of societal woes becomes the way in which we would like to look at the world, and at ourselves. <br />The movie also places Forrest in slight interaction with historical figures, ranging from John F. Kennedy's congratulating of the All-American football team, to Richard Nixon's resignation from the White House. Even though his involvement with these events is purely fictional, it offers much needed comical relief for such a serious film. This is where the film gets to use some very effective special effects in order to incorporate Forrest into real footage taken of the events portrayed within the movie, and it does so seamlessly and without flaw. <br />The story's characters all act as a representation of some stereotype from the decades the movie covers. Forrest is not a conservative, nor is he an activist, but rather one of the people that watches from the sidelines as the country falls apart before his eyes. Jenny becomes the hippie, the rebel of society who does drugs and men, following what is considered cool even when it puts her in danger. Lieutenant Dan is the wounded Vietnam officer who is forgotten by his country and the government and left to fend for himself. All of these characters give us diverse looks at the events at hand, while also providing an emotional outlet as we feel their pain and emotions. <br />Tom Hanks gives his best and most memorable performance ever in this film. He plays Gump with all the simple-mindedness and naivety that the movie needs, and brings such vivid and emotional life to the movie. We believe in his ability to create such beautiful images with his simple words. Robin Wright plays his girl, Jenny, who has a profound effect on us despite her many mistakes in her life. Throughout the movie, she seems to be wanting something more than just the popular scene and lifestyle, and Wright brings all of that out with vivacity and excellence. Gary Sinise plays Lieutenant Dan, and his embittered attitude towards his country prove to be quite a challenge for Sinise, who readily accepts and makes the role his own. Mykelti Williamson is Bubba Blue, who is a bit smarter than Forrest in terms of understanding the country's upsets. And Sally Field plays Forrest's mother, sweet and charming, loving and warm. This is the Field we all know and have grown to love. <br />&quot;Forrest Gump&quot; works on so many different levels of emotion, intensity and passion for life that it becomes a success many times over. It will not soon be forgotten, so long as we all look for a way to better simplify the events of our lives, seeing things with the naivety of a small boy who rose to such heights of fame yet never really realized his social status. To him, it didn't matter; he was just living life.
B00000K19E|1.0|This movie is horrible.  The story is a VERY LAME excuse for all the action; the action isn't all that good either.  When someone says 'You just don't understand it' I say 'You're the one that doesn't understand how BAD it is.'<br />P. S. :  The acting is horrible, and Keanu Reaves is the WORST actor ever.
0786915749|5.0|The Dragonlance chronicles is one of the greatest fantasy epics of all time. I have been reading lots of great fantasy over the years, and would you believe, that on January 22nd, 2001, I finally learned of Dragonlance's existence?! Apparently, all my friends have read them and they never bothered to tell me about this masterpiece! Anyway, it's all my fault that a best selling fantasy book series numbering over 60 volumes (I'm including all those little side books) that date back to the early 80's just happened to escape my attention, so I went out and bought the chronicles. After four days of non-stop reading I finally finished, and I felt a kind of... emptiness inside of me. I just then realized it was over, and it hurt, I didn't want it to end! I wanted to find out what happened next! (fortunately I discovered the Legends trilogy) the point is, I never felt that way about a book before! The writing is fantastic! The characters are so well developed! (Believe it or not, I cried when a certain person(s) kicked the bucket. My mom came in and asked me if I was alright, so I wiped my tears and told her everything was fine... after she left I began crying again.) Of all the 'epic' fantasy series' I have read, this one ties the Lord of the Rings as my favorite. Among my other fave series' is 'The Wheel of Time' by Jordan, and 'Lord of the Isles' by Drake. But the most satisfying thing about the Chronicles, is that in FAR less pages, Weis and Hickman make more cool things happen, better develop the characters, and create a better world than Jordan does in his whole nine volume (more to come of course, and I still love WoT)series! Bottom line: Dragonlance = Oh yeah!
B00000J7SS|2.0|I agree that Miles Davis is one of the giants of 20th Century jazz, but this vastly overrated album is the biggest reason why jazz has lost its sales impact.  Miles new approach &quot;Rock-Fusion&quot; aliented jazz fans, because instead of improvising off the tradional melody lines, he opted for improvising off say two dark chords.  The result is aimless meandering, which is dark, gloomy and quite simply boring.  Ken Burns recent Jazz series opened a renewed awareness to  the greats of the 20th Century like Parker, Armstrong, Ellington, Monk and earlier Miles, when there was a melody, some romantic intrugue, beauty in improvisation and outstanding technique.  This album singlehandedly, turn jazz into a brooding, dark and dissonant music, which has taken nearly 30 years to recover.  A lot of young jazz listeners back then were sheep, the only reason they bought this was because it was perceived as cool, and their buddies bought it too.  Answer this? Does anyone in his right mind after a stressful day put this CD on?  I don't know of anyone who listens to this waste of time anymore!  Please be careful, if you're thinking of suicide, don't listen to this, it'll bring you over the edge.  Stick to Miles' recordings from 1957 to 1965, his peak period.
6300213714|5.0|I found myself, as a kid, getting pumped up every time I saw this movie.  Now that I'm grown... I'm still getting pumped up every time I see this movie.  <br />It is a great movie.  <br />When the movie first came out, critics were saying 'No Way'.  Well now-a-days those same critics are saying 'Yes Way'.<br />If you look outside your doors, you will see just how true this movie is to real life.<br />I highly recommend people to rent or buy this one.
1559409010|5.0|One of Python's best efforts and their second best movie (first being Holy Grail) This is also one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  The dialog is great; the physical comedy is hilarious.   I am a Christian and this movie is not in any way offensive unless you are a complete fool.  This movie never makes fun of Jesus but at the silly people who fallow whatever leader comes along.  It's a wonderful mockery of the Roman political system and is just plain silly, and intelligent at the same time.  Again this isn't an offensive movie unless you're a stupid git like my college roommate who couldn't take it.  Always Look On the Bright Side Of Life, has always been one of the funniest songs ever written just to listen to.  Once you see it in its context you'll die of laughter.  This also teaches you several things.  When in Israel if you ever come across some terrorists called People's Front Of Judea runaway they'll leave you out to dry.  Oh and avoid the Judean Peoples Front as well!

B000001FSR|1.0|Well, I for one don't quite agree with the glowing recommendations that have been provided here by other humble Tom Waits fans. This album comes nowhere near the beautiful serenity that is delivered in Closing Time, or The Heart Of Saturday Night both of which I think are Waits more valued items...
0792845684|5.0|I've been a huge fan of this movie since the first time I saw it.  I know that 1997 has already passed but the way America is headed, this movie is believable...in every aspect.  First of all we have Plissken, the hero, or should we say the bad guy...? <br />Plissken is injected and told he must save the President...He goes in and fights through every impossible odds, and still he is cool during the whole thing.  <br />I say that this is believable because it lifts the crook to super hero status.  Just look at how we, today, lift up serial killers to that status.
0805017305|5.0|Bury my heart at wounded Knee is one of those books that literally can cahnge the way you look at the world. I first read this book as a high school freshman, then have read it a half dozen times since. It tells the sory,through the eyes of the Native peoples[or indians,or native americans].having been raised on a steady diet of gen. Custer and kit Carson{niether of whom fare very well here},I was shocked then appalled at what I read. From the forced march of the navajos,to the cheyenne trail of tears,to the magnificentCrazy Horse,to the sad,somewhat co-opted Red Cloud&quot;They made us many promises,more Then I can remember,but they only kept but one:they promised to take our land, and they took it.&quot;This was the first place I read of the remarkable chief Joseph of the Nez Perce,and his stunning travail. Or the magnificent apache's...The death of sitting bull is elagaic and very,very sad, as to survive, collaborators joined the occupying force{as is the case in any occupied country}Tragic,and ending horribly with the massacres at Sand Creek and Wounded Knee. The final image of the survivors of that massacre being brought into a chruch decorated for Christmas has satyed with me through the years. Searing, brilliant,essential.
6304196938|3.0|I thought the story was somehow interesting.The story wasen't boring.When I heard this film was made in 1959 I thought this might be new for the audience in those ages.However,for me the scenes were quit unnatural.It didn't have the reality. When I saw the last scene I thought this is the ordinary ending we can see in Hollywood films.
B00004XQ83|5.0|WOW!  What a thrill to write a review about my favorite movie, &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot;  This film playfully and respectfully salutes an era from long ago, the 1930's.......in the Gulf region of Mississippi..... loosely based on Homer's &quot;Odessey&quot;, OBWAT is full of adventure, mystery and laughs, but the very best part of the movie is the music!  Tastefully produced by T-Bone Burnett, classic hobo tunes like &quot;The Big Rock Candy Mtn&quot;, &quot;Keep on the Sunny Side&quot; are beautifully captured by some of the best roots musicians you'll ever hear.  Folks like Gillian Welch, Dan Tyminski[who is George Clooney's singing voice,] and my Hero, Dr. Ralph Stanley, who sings the spooky tune, &quot;Oh Death&quot;, all add many layers to this film.   Why, they're all my close friends that play on the soundtrack, some even appear on screen as themselves[most notably, Buck White and his 2 daughters, and Gillian Welch....]  It's so exciting to see and hear Bluegrass music not only on the big screen again, but the audiences seem to love it as well!  R_U_N_N_ O_F_T_ and S_E_E_ I_T...
0782008372|5.0|I can't belive all the negative reviews I have read here. This was a milestone movie in the SF/Fantasy genre and I enjoy this movie immensely. Yes, it's true that the cinematic sequels don't measure up, but the first one is a thrill ride with plenty to love. Memorable heroes and villains, a good story, and an interesting premise all add up to a movie I watch over and over. The picture on the DVD *is* a bit grainy, but good grief...look at the price and you'll see it's still a great deal given that my DVD player doesn't have the penchant for eating DVD's like my VHS does with tapes. And the extras that highlight some of the missing scenes made it a must have for me.
B000055WIQ|5.0|I have searched far and wide for the ORIGINAL version of this movie and finally found it at a movie rental store near me.  This movie is absolutely the best horror film I have ever seen and now that it is out in it's original version, I will add it to my collection very soon!!
B00000J7S8|5.0|This is the first Diana Krall album I have ventured out to buy. What a complete joy. It evokes sitting in a smokey club with your love. There is not a song that disappoints here. &quot;Popsicle Toes&quot; is humourous and sexy, &quot;When I look into your eyes&quot; is romantic and lushious. Hard to believe that she is so young, she sings as if she has been around for a long time.
0195073401|5.0|It must be true that some concepts and proofs in this book could be out of reach from some people that does not has the technical initiation on the area, but as anyone has pointed before it is not necesary for readers to check out all the proofs to understand the nontechnical or basic ideas behind theorems.  Since Samuelson, mathematics and statistics tools becomes an indispensable way of proving and advancing in Economics at all because its a thruthfully way of avoiding everybody saying whatever they want.  Mas-Collel et. al. made a wonderful job on Microeconomics, and everybody who makes serious studies in areas related with Economics must agree with me that it is a unvaluable tool for understanding and thinking in the right way.  This book is an obligated reference for them.
B000056N8X|5.0|I was finally able to listen to the DVD at appropriate theatrical sound levels (that is -- really, really loud). <br />OOoooooooooooohhhhhhhhh!!<br />The sound designers, Foley folks and all other sound tekkies really have done a terrific job.  After 15 years using my last stereo rig, I finally have a state-of-the-current-art 6 speaker set-up with DVD, CD, MD, major sub-woofer, etc. and a humongous receiver to pump it all out.<br />One of the major points of DVD technology is the ability to have magnificent sound and Highlander: Endgame takes full advantage of it.<br />The Quickenings (especially the climactic last one) are incredible -- the lightning and explosions occur all around you -- to the point I found myself whipping my head around to see if the noise I heard behind me was our cats destroying something made of glass!!<br />Nice job all!!!
B0000542DJ|5.0|The movie JFK was made 28 years after the assassaination of President John Kennedy and was an effective history lesson for people who were not alive at the time, like myself. This movie examines the event from the viewpoint of Jim Garrison, a New Oreleans District Attorney who takes a look at the case three years after the shooting and finds numerous inconsistencies with the given investigation. There are many stars in this movie that give great performances, among others Kevin Costner, of course, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau as a U.S. Senator, Gary Oldman as Lee Harvey Oswald, Kevin Bacon as a male prostitute, Joe Pesci as a principal part of the conspiracy, Donald Sutherland as an ex-CIA man who helps Garrison, Tommy Lee Jones as a conspirator with a few secrets, and Seinfeld fans will recognize Wayne Knight (Newman). This movie, although it is not a documentary and should not be regarded as one, does make the Lyndon Johnson coup theory seem more than plausible, but the only thing that makes sense. This movie will make amaze and surprise you until the end. It is too long, but it is worth your time.<br />Well, it's provocative, anyway, but pretty -farfetched-, admittedly.
B00004XOWM|3.0|The first time I saw Limp Bizkit was at the MTV Spring Break of 1998 I believe it was.  I was thoroughly impressed.  They played &quot;Nobody Loves Me&quot; and I was like, yes!  While it wasn't groundbreaking, I could see this band improving and being just awesome.  <br />Sadly, this band hasn't improved at all and in my opinion has gotten much worse.  Did you even graduate the 7th grade Mr. Durst?  The guitar work is so average it turns my stomach.  Whats the point of playing a 7 string guitar when you can't even play with 6?<br />All in all, I had high expectations for this band and they totally let me down.  The songs are ok but I expected much more from these guys.  What a shame.
B00001NFCY|2.0|SERIOUSLY FOLKS...DON'T BUY THIS CD!!!  I cannot stress it enough.       First off, they have already sold practically 10 million 'Human Clay' albums.       Secondly, there is absolutely nothing innovative about their tunes.  Nearly every track on the cd begins with an 8-count guitar jingle then ignorantly and so conceivably they'll follow with garbled rock noises with Scott's ailing and bellowing voices of meaningless lyrics.  I seriously consider Britney Spears's lyrics much more intricate and complex then that of Creed.        Bottom line:  Yes, Creed is a great band...a great band to throw rocks at.  If you are in search of a great band and you are completely sick of the regeneration in music today...... Listen to Third Eye Blind music....It's a remedy for a lost cause.
B000002WYT|1.0|It seems to be a recent trend.  I expect an artist to put out something that shows some sort of cleverness or something refreshing, and instead I get grade C music that does little for my arm hairs (they sit passive, unlike in the day when they would jump for joy at hearing something cool).<br />This album is good for one reason.  Chics love Dave.  Its a proven fact, and the only reason for buying this albu...  So just throw this sucker in, grin and bear it, and watch as the ladies flock.  Then when they turn around, throw that Sublime CD back in there.
B0000042FP|5.0|This is probably the best version of Verdi's Masterpiece so the complete set is strongly recommended! However, even highlights are enough to make one realise why this is a legendary recording. Just have a look at the cast: R.Tebaldi, M. del Monaco, E. Bastianini, G.Simionato, C.Siepi, F. Corena! This is a 1955 in glorious sound quality stereo recording. All main principals are in fabulous vocal shape. Listen to Tebaldi in one of her best recordings singing Pace, Pace mio Dio. She fills the room like no other with her extremely powerful, amazingly beautiful godsend instrument. Her duet with one of the greatest basses of all times C. Siepi in the first act is a miracle! Del Monaco heroic, powerful, simply p e r f e c t! Simionato once again proofs why she is regarded by many the best verdian mezzo. Let me not forget the grand Bastianini nor the young, sublime Corena. The powerful conducting of F. Molinari - Prandelli completes the success. I've been trying to find a drawback for this Forza and the only one is, that it's just highlights here!
630382790X|5.0|Few movies have the ability to captivate me and take me into the story. This is one of them. From the heartwrenching first scene of the fire of Apollo 1 to the final 4 minutes, I was held by the surperb acting of all the actors and the storyline. What made the movie even better was the fact that it was true and stayed fairly accurate to the actual storyline. This is one of the best movies I have seen.
0440219078|5.0|The Giver by Louis Lowry was an exceptional novel about the true nature of a utopian society.  The society that the main character, 12-year-old Jonas, lives in is completely devoid of the emotions and pleasures of life in order to shield them from the bad points.  However when Jonas is selected to receive all of the memories of the \\"old\\" world, his safe life is thrown into turmoil.  Through this child's eyes, Lowry poses the question as to whether this utopia is actually superior to society today.  Yes, there is no pain, war, hunger, ect., but in order to cause this \\"sameness\\" the people are forced to live in a world as if sedated, devoid of strong emotions, and ultimately the freedom of choice.  <br />Lowry attempts to answer her own question in the denouement of the novel, which although in a minority, I thought was an appropriate way to end. Since it does not supply a definite answer, she allows the reader to draw their own conclusions.  It would have seemed trite to me if there were a simplistic end to the novel, since the ideal of a utopia is such a complex concept.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Parks &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; is Awsome!!!! its the best new cd out now that you can get! and right now my new favorite band!!! in the end, paper cut, forgotten, (all of them really) are my favorites!!!!
B00003CXFV|5.0|Okay, language issues aside, Julia Roberts SHINES as the real-life Erin Brockovich, a dogged, unabashed crusader for justice.<br />Erin accidentally finds out that several hundred unsuspecting residents of Hinkley, California are dead or dying from poisoned water that has exceedingly high levels of toxic chromium.<br />This is a touching story that reminds me a lot of Sally Field's performance in Norma Rae. It's about a grass-roots effort to right a very terrible wrong, and the investigative techniques used by Erin will floor you with their sheer simplicity. It's not what she does, rather it's HOW she does what she does that makes a difference. Erin is not equipped professionally to take on this insurmountable task, but she refuses to let that stop her from trying. She's what I would call &quot;ignorance on fire&quot;, but she's also smart as a whip.<br />What I love most about this movie is how Roberts character gets results when others can't. She may not be the most professional (this movie is cleavage city!), or meekest person you'll ever meet (her boss says she could use a good dose of \\"charm school\\" - he's right!) but she has a way with people. True, her wardrobe doesn't hurt in her getting her way so often (especially with men), but it's her honest compassion for these victims that makes the movie work.<br />Erin Brockovich teaches all of us a lesson in true leadership, persistence against all odds, and how to motivate people. These victims TRUST her because they know she really CARES, That's the real lesson here, and that's why she is so successful in getting them to do something they would never have done without her.<br />This movie is a real gem. You will learn a lot about purpose, passion, corruption, romance, and how to deal with people so that they respond. And you'll also learn that door-to-door selling is NOT antiquated!<br />Highly recommended.<br />Cris
6302662648|5.0|Stephen Tobolowski gives a fabulously over-the-top performance as Dr. Werner Brandes, defining a new phase in his career as an unparalleled supporting actor. He gives the role unprecedented depth and importance; let's not forget, Sneakers was made just a year before Groundhog Day. We all remember Tobolowski's astounding  portrayal of insurance salesman Ned Ryerson! Do you really believe that that performance would have been possible without his appearance in Sneakers? I believe that the excellence with which Tobolowski created his role helped drive others in the cast to give equally stellar performances; not to be outdone, David Strathairn gives a particularly compelling performance as &quot;Whistler&quot; that is both dirty and idealistic. He and Dan Akroyd's &quot;Mother&quot; pair to make an incorrigible but loveable duo with a one-two punch!<br />Conclusion: Sneakers is a brilliant constellation of stars, big and small!
B000002BPS|5.0|My first album I got of Offspring's was Conspiracy of One, which I thought was pretty good, but some of the songs were unclear as to what they meant, i.e. &quot;Living in Chaos&quot;; but the music was great. Then I got Smash, which just is plain awesome. The music makes sense, such as &quot;Come Out and Play&quot; and songs with teen agnst like &quot;Smash&quot;, my favorite song. So I went out and got this CD without hearing any songs, and boy, no offense, but this CD beats Smash. No question. A lot more of the songs on here are catchy, like &quot;Mota&quot; and &quot;All I Want&quot;, and there are some that have emotion like &quot;Gone Away&quot;, and &quot;Cool to Hate&quot; which is a thumb in the eye to all the preppies and jocks. The only songs I don't like are &quot;Don't Pick It Up&quot;, which is kinda stupid (who would ever mistake poop for candy?) and &quot;Me &amp; My Old Lady&quot;, which sounds like incest, but I like the music in it. The beginning of &quot;Change the World&quot; sounds similar to &quot;Genocide&quot;, and the bonus music after &quot;Smash&quot;, but hey, no problem hearing the same riffs...so if you like Smash or Conspiracy of One, get this CD. It's a must. I've heard Americana is a pop-infested album, so it can't be as good as this. Ixnay is simply the best.
B000055WIQ|1.0|Being a TRUE horror fan this piece of crap always rubs me the wrong way. What do you sad saps find so scary. Is it the little wanna be devil voices or Pea soup being spewed. Go see a real horror film with real atmosphere. What is there to be scared of anyways a demonic possessed little girl. That's a pathetic vilian at best. Not only that but She isn't even convincing there is no suspension of disblief. I wanted to like this movie I really did but I can't forget all I know about horror and just Conform. For real Scares see a Dario Argento directed movie or just see Henry: Portait of a Serial Killer both are superb in atmosphere and suspension of disblief.
0689504764|5.0|When reading this book to my kids they all loved it.  (Ages 3-7)  Just reading the title to them and showing them the front cover were enough to raise their curiosity of what the story would contain when it was being read.  They asked questions like: \\"Why are they hunting for a bear? Do you think they will be ok?\\"  We're Going on a Bear Hunt does a great job of making reading out loud to your kids a thing to look forward to.  Your kids will enjoy this little story as it takes you onward towards the bear.<br />When reading this picture book you will see that the Illustrations are colorful, lively and accurate in their support of the text at all times.  The clearly defined illustrations also complement the mood and setting of the adventuring family along the changing terrain.  You will notice the contrast between lighter and darker scenes as the storyline changes emotions and how they help develop the plot throughout.<br />Just like the illustrations, the text of the story is lively and fun to read.  The themes are repetitive and easy for young ones to anticipate.  (Another good thing for beginning readers)  The page has text that imitates the sounds that the family makes while on the bear hunt. You will also notice that the text and Illustrations are not mixed up with the layout on the pages, thus avoiding the confusion that some books do have.  The text is large enough to easily read and good for beginning readers.  My oldest enjoyed reading it to his younger siblings.<br />Overall, I would say that We're Going on a Bear Hunt is a great way to teach your kids, in a fun way, a little about what not to do when you go on an adventure in the wild;-)  It will provide plenty of good reading, laughter and silliness.  I am sure you will have your little ones asking you to repeatedly read this charming, fun and well-done book.
B000002MFE|5.0|I ran into this again after too many years!  What a find!  Clapton is certainly on top of his game with this one.  Tears in Heaven, Signe and Layla are without question the cream of the crop.  This is one you will play over and over cuz you won't get sick of it.  He is a fabulous musician and his guitar must be very happy.  It sure sounds that way!  Just buy it already.

B0000021RB|5.0|This is without a doubt Chicago's best work.  I fell for this album when it first came out and just recently got it on CD.  What a pleasure to hear them again on a great sounding stereo without pops and other nefarious noise.  Well worth the price of admission.  They represented a certain time in music that current artists can't even touch.  This is the real thing folks!
0788816454|4.0|The Waterboy is a simple tale about how a simple guy goes from being a picked-on &quot;water distribution engineer&quot; to superstar college &quot;foosball&quot; player. This role is tailor-made for Adam Sandler, who makes a good living acting stupid onscreen.      OK, your opinion about this film will probably hinge entirely on whether you find Bobby Boucher (Sandler)'s voice - complete with stutter - hilarious or annoying. I think it's hilarious, but this film has so much more! Alot of the comedy is sight gags, and the football scenes are especially well done. Sorry, but EVERYONE should laugh when Bobby drop-kicks &quot;Number 62&quot;.      The supporting cast do well too, with Henry Winkler providing a few laughs as Bobby's wimpy coach. This is the prototypical Adam Sandler movie: he plays a lovable loser who rises to the challenge and gets the girl (see Billy Madison, Big Daddy, Happy Gilmore, Little Nicky...), but if it ain't broke, why fix it? I give this 4 out of 5. Could have been 5, but a few of the jokes miss, and as usual, some of the acting is less than good.
B0000507R0|5.0|If you have a DVD player matched to a 5.1 home theater or better, buy this CD.  It does not matter if you are an ELP fanatic or a casual listener, this sets the standard for surround recordings.  Originally released in 1973 and almost 30 years ahead of its time, the format for this recording has finnaly been created.  I will be taking vacation time when Tarkus is available!
B000056WTC|5.0|Bruce Lee shines in this action-packed, story-thin adventure! As with most martial arts movies, the fight scenes are the best parts, but in this film the supporting cast are exceptional. John Saxon and Jim Kelly provide light relief from the intense atmosphere, and Shih Kien sizzles as the menacing Han. Samo Hung makes an early appearance, getting fully beaten down by Bruce, and watch out for Jackie Chan getting his neck snapped by Lee near the end! <br />This is a quality production by Warner Brothers, and has aged well. Unfortunately English copies of the film are without the amazing nunchaku scene, and this greatly detracts from the movie. Apart from this, all is good, especially Bruce's anihilation of O'Hara and the brilliantly choreographed final fight in the &quot;Hall of Mirrors&quot;. A MUST SEE.
B000056N8X|2.0|I'm happy that I simply rented this dvd. If you've only seen the television series, you may enjoy it, but it doesn't stack up to the best episodes there. If you're a fan of the first movie (where Connor killed the Kurgan and won the prize) and hated the following two sequels---then you'll hate this one too. <br />Not to ruin anything, but the plot was pretty weak, the acting was sub-par (execpt for the series regulars, who were as good as usual), and the special effects were only so-so. <br />I loved the tv series, and this movie bridges the series to the big screen, but to sacrifice some of the best characters from the original movie was a bad idea and in bad taste. <br />This release gets 2 stars only because I made it through the entire thing before feeling completely let down.<br />Have a nice day.
B000001ELD|3.0|I've often wondered if Gene Simmons gets tired of being 'the guy with the tongue.' While his face is forever linked to most peoples' mental images of KISS, his music is not quite so important. In fact some would argue that Gene's songs, as a whole, pretty much suck (his two biggest songs &quot;God of Thunder&quot; and &quot;Cold Gin&quot; were written by Stanley and Frehley, respectively.) Aside from the numbingly stupid &quot;Calling Dr. Love&quot; Gene hasn't contributed much music to the KISS canon.<br />With his solo effort he tried to be more than the blood-sptting guy. He tried to throw in some blues, some gospel and some heart. He tried to write some heart-felt songs that may have changed people's perceptions of him. Did he succeed? Not really.<br />At best this record is a mixed bag. At worst, it's a terrible record. &quot;Radioactive&quot; has a decent hook but otherwise most of the songs are pretty forgettable. There' nothing necessarily wrong with most of them but they just aren't that interesting. &quot;See You Tonight&quot; and &quot;Mr. Make Believe&quot; are decent enough tunes but they don't build to anything -- in fact &quot;Mr. Make Believe&quot; ends up being a first-rate bore.<br />Gene's embarrasing &quot;When You Wish Upon A Star&quot; doesn't help matters. Novelty is fine, Gene, but at least sing on pitch for God's sake.<br />But in the end, these songs aren't much better than what Gene contributed to most KISS albums. So, to most people he's still the guy that spits blood. This album didn't change that one bit.
B0000027I6|5.0|Lyricly, one of the strongest albums ever penned by Roger Waters.  Musically, also.  It  hits on some pretty tough spots, like TV Evangilism, Media, and life in general in this decade and century of materialism.  His best work since he left Pink Floyd.
B000001ELL|5.0|But this is my favorite KISS album. Some say it's 'too pop.' I simply don't agree. &quot;I Was Made For Loving You&quot; is a heavily pop-influenced song, no doubt.  But the rest of this is pretty straight-ahead rock and roll. Paul's &quot;Sure Know Something&quot; is a true classic, mixing a softer verse with a heavy chorus (granted the chorus riffs are just like Paul's &quot;Tonight You Belong To Me&quot; riffs but I doubt many people notice that.) His &quot;Magic Touch&quot; is a heavy, riff-laden gem.<br />Ace, riding the success of his solo record delivers 3 more solid tunes. &quot;2000 Man&quot; is the most famous but &quot;Hard Times&quot; is the one that should stick out. Great song. &quot;Save Your Love&quot; has great verses but the initial chorus is somewhat bland. But it ends up being another solid tune.<br />Heck, even Gene gets on base both times with the killer &quot;Charisma&quot; and &quot;X-Ray Eyes.&quot; Both songs have great grooves and melodies -- these two songs are pretty much better than anything Gene has produced before or since.<br />Only Peter's &quot;Dirty Livin'&quot; falls short but he was an unhappy camper and it shows.<br />&quot;Dynasty&quot; is more heavily-produced than KISS' previous records. The instrumentation is a little more complex, the melodies a little brighter. But this is not a disco record, it's a rock and roll record .. and a heck of a good one.<br />As far as I'm concerned this is a must have.
B00002MZ12|5.0|I love the versions of the songs -- acoustic.  There is a big difference between the versions on this cd and the album versions (i.e.:  I Was Hoping; Joining You). My absolute favourite track is That I Would Be Good.  You can hear all the different overtones and the raw emotion behind the lyrics.  Absolutely Gorgeous.
B000002KHF|5.0|Simply put, Moondance by Van Morrison is one of my all-time favorite albums.  Although I have owned it for years, I still enjoy listening to it on a regular basis, it is that good.  There is not a weak song on this album.<br />There are many Van Morrison songs on this album that most will recognize like &quot;It Stoned Me&quot;, &quot;Moondance&quot;, and &quot;Crazy Love&quot;, and it also includes other great tracks that may be less familiar like &quot;Glad Tidings&quot;, &quot;Caravan&quot;, and &quot;Into the Mystic&quot;.  All the songs fit well together, and make for a great collection of Van's earlier material.<br />I highly recommend this album to any Van Morrison fan who does not already own it.  If you do not own any Van Morrison albums (you should be ashamed if you don't), then buy this one.  It is a great album to discover one of Ireland's best talents.
B000050XEI|5.0|This CD is shorter than any of her others (I own them all), but it is a wonderful addition to the collection of any Enya fan and it's also a great way to introduce yourself to her beautiful music. I listened to this CD on a long drive (three hours) and found it helped me to relax and unwind for my nice weekend vacation. Enya's music is always relaxing and uplifting at the same time with gorgeous melodies and sounds that are just so terrific on the ears.
0780626966|5.0|Mind blowing.  I've always thought Fred Kruger as the ULTIMATE horror villan, though I'd never seen any of the NOES series.  There was just something about the way that he looked that put fear into my heart.  This collection is by FAR the best DVD collection I have ever got.  While many say that Nightmare 2 is the worst, I personally felt that it was one of the best.  While I will always have a place in my heart for the old Fred Kruger, I have to say that the new one in New Nightmare is much more darker and the makeup ROCKS!  I didn't like his new &quot;glove&quot; though.  It felt too fancy.  The old glove has a much more &quot;glorious&quot; history.  You will buy this collection.  You will enjoy it.
630179513X|3.0|Ok, plot summary:<br />Part 3 picks off where 2 left off.  Marty is stranded in 1955 (again - jeez!) and Doc Brown has been stranded in 1885 - the old west.  Watch 2 to find out how the heck that happened.  Doc has the post office keep a letter he writes to Marty all the way up until 1955 so he can get it.  Doc also hides the DeLorian in 1885 so Marty can dig it up in the Future.  However, Doc    ures MArty he is very happy living in the old west and tells him to just go home and destroy the time machine afterwards (therefore preventing any more time-paradox/problems/risks.  So Marty has the DeLorian again and is ready to go home, when he finds out Doc had been shot in 1885.  So he goes back to the Old West to save Doc before he goes home.  But after getting there, the fuel line is ripped - and they both get stranded.  Now they have to find a way to get back to the Future before Doc gets shot!<br />I found this episode to be much more bland and toned down than the other ones.  The love story between Doc and Clara doesn't make it any better.  But its clever how they have marty meeting his and Biff's ancestors back then - very clever.<br />This film was very much like the first but no nearly as good.  Parts I and II are equealy fine as far as I'm concerned.<br />Peace OUT!
B000003TAW|5.0|I'm a metal, indies, grunge, alternative, punk, techno, and everything in between (except Limp and the like), long hair, black, if you were to see me walking on the street you'll be like &quot;ROCK ON&quot; sort of person (that should give you an image of who i am). And i love weezer. <br />I don't know how this band is a geek rock band. Its more like an I HAVE THE BEST GUITARIST IN THE WORLD AND THE BEST MUSICIANS but one problem we can never make any lyrics that really make sence and come out funny, sorta band. I really never saw them as a geek band. <br />well anyways about the album. Its a master piece the song are really good with lyrics that are really good in that sorta &quot;made it in 3 minutes&quot; way. Absolutly all the songs are master pieces, especially the sweater song, no one else, the world has turned , and Buddy Holly.<br />Well i hope i conviesed you to get this album. Its really good (even i love it).
6302800897|4.0|This movie was filmed in the town and surrounding areas in which I live, In fact in the scene with the children playing, My mother was one of the children. It is interesting to see the places in the film as they were in the movie compared to how they are today.
B00001SIES|5.0|Well, what can u say about Muse which hasn't already been said? Matt, Chris and Dom are all talented musicians and possess a sound which is totally unique, dark and full of passion. The songs that stand out the first time u hear the album are Sunburn, Muscle Museum, Unintended and Showbiz which are all different from another but are all excellent. <br />Get this album...as u won't be disappointed! I've had it for months and still play their album everyday and I'm not tried of it. As for Matt..well, his vocals are superb, his falsettos and he can sing higher than me....
B000053VJI|5.0|I am a forty-eight year old white Anglo-Saxon female who decided to take dance lessons and immediately fell in love with Latin music. My wonderful instructor gave me a list of cds which included Grandes Exitos, and I simply can't stop listening and dancing to it. Juan Luis Guerra's songs have such amazing rhythms and melodies that I go to sleep and wake up with them on my mind. And his voice is both strong and versatile. I have a long way to go with my dancing, but I am enjoying every moment, especially with music like this. Next I am going to learn Spanish!
B00004XQ83|4.0|From the small taste, I immediaely established a connecion to my youth in the 30's: 2 to 12 years old.  The radio was the most important communication device in the house and the family entertainment as well as news were vital.  The music was the sole conduit to the &quot;outside&quot; and usually reflected emotions of the current times, homelessnes, hunger, relationship breakdowns, joy and an abiding faith in God things will get better. Songs like &quot;Can I Sleep in Your Barn Tonight, Mister?&quot; and about little Marian Parker who was kidnapped, held for ransome and killed, filled us younger kids with apprehension about the world out there. We had our pride and looked to no one to provide for us no matter what the circumstance, and there was no job too menial to refuse, or do less than the very best effort. I am anxious to see the movie, now, and to hear the entire musical score, and buy a cd.  The character of the music is what we called hillbilly, but it also sounds a lot like bluegrass.

B00003CXA6|5.0|Well, maybe not a great movie, but some great acting. I wasn't enthralled to be watching this movie, but my father-in-law had purchased it after visiting Gettysburg, and wanted to point out where he had stood, overlooking the field (I think he might have been a drummer during the actual battle...no, no--just kidding!) So, it was with heavy heart that I sat down to watch this movie. I wasn't impressed so much with Sheen, or Berenger (Sheen was too heavy handed, in my humble opinion, and Berengers beard should have been given a supporting actor nod, but it was far too fake!). Then, I saw Jeff Daniels. Could this be the same Jeff Daniels that starred in Dumb and Dumber? I couldn't believe it. Actually, I didn't recognize him at first, but was already taken back by his strong performance. As the story line grew, I became more and more thrilled at watching Daniels perform. I realized that I missed something in all the movies I had ever seen him in--he is an artist, who can carefully craft his work into something that can surpass time. I have seen pleasantville, and was pleased by his performance in that, but this is beyond anything that I could have hoped for. I am now in the process of looking up all of his movies, as he has won himself a fan. <br />I wholeheartedly recommend this movie, if for no other reason then to watch Daniels earn his pay. Give up four hours of your life, and you will be pleasantly surprised, I am sure!
B000000OSG|5.0|NOT AS GOOD AS THERE FIRST CD &quot;APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION&quot; BUT IT HAS EXELLENT SONGS LIKE CIVIL WAR SO FINE ESTRANGED YOU COULD BE MINE ECT... AXL'S HARD POWERFUL VOCALS MIXED WITH SLASH'S HARD GREAT GUITAR PLAYING IS A PERFECT PAIR THIS CD ALSO CONTAINS A GOOD COVER OF THE BOB DYLAN SONG KNOCKIN ON HEAVENS DOOR IT IS WITH OUT A DOUBT ONE OF THE BEST ROCK ALBUM'S EVER
6303418287|3.0|The title of this review is a line from Jerry Seinfeld referring to this film. And although Kenneth Branaugh's 'Frankenstein' doesn't really owe that much to the Karloff classic, it still makes one wish it contained the element that the previous one strived for...horror.<br />Not to say that 'Mary Shelley's Frankenstein' is a horror movie; I just can't tell what kind of movie it is at all. It's definately a stylish period piece, with a lot of credit going to the style. Rather than go for a bloody (although it has some) thriller-horror movie - which it was blatantly advertised as - the film is rather an exploration of one man's ambition and obsession... I think. Or it's the story of a monster who longs to be a man, who longs to find acceptance among those who fear and hate him... I think.<br />The problem here is that neither Dr. Frankenstein (Branaugh) nor the Monster (played by Robert DeNiro in what I thought was a good performance) are very well thought out roles. Is the Doctor the hero of the movie? The villain for creating and abandoning the Monster? Neither? And what about the Creation himself? Should we hate him for his selfish murderous actions? Pity him and his quest? Both? Neither?<br />Frankly by the end I didn't care for any of them. I did, however, enjoy all the actor's performances. Branaugh tends to over-act, but generally handled the &quot;role&quot; well. Helena Bonham-Carter and Ian Holm also appear, and are as enjoyable as ever. <br />If your in the mood for revisionist horror, I'd say pick this one up for the sets and actors alone, but definately pair it up with &quot;Bram Stokers Dracula&quot;, what I feel to be the superior film. Pretty costumes, but not enough growl's in the monsters.
B000002NJS|5.0|This is a wonderful cd by the so incredible Madonna.  She has expanded into uncharted territory with this album.  &quot;sky fits heaven&quot; is my life song I am sure of it.  with lyrics like &quot;traveling down this road watching the signs as i go, i think i'll follow my heart, its a very good place to start&quot; you can't help but love that song.  The others are just as inspiring, you will like this album even if you are a death metal fan like me.
B000050FEN|5.0|Even though I really liked Silence of the Lambs (Except for Hannibal), I found myself enjoying this movie more. The dark over tone made the story even more intense.  I am not a Brad Pitt fan, but I thought he did an excellent job in this particular role.  And what was more interesting was the ending, did the bad guy win?  Buy it, watch it and decide for yourself.
B00004TRD8|5.0|I reside in Sydney Australia, and ordered the DTS T2 DVD from ..., in the States.  It arrived in only 2 weeks and I was excited as soon as I recieved the postal slip to pick it up.  Wow!  It is just simply the ultimate in both picture and sound. The DTS soundtrack sounds loud and clear and gives the listener an extreme feeling of presence.  There is the theatrical show and the special edition which I had never seen before, another great bonus.  The menus are huge with alot of added extras to be explored.  It has not been taken out of the DVD tray, nor will it be, and acts as a demo for sound enthusiasts.  DTS is awesome.  I can't wait to get home and watch it again!
B00000I924|5.0|Ignore the naggy parts of Jerry McCulley's review (above). Stylistically, this excellent album is the logical bridge between the very clean and classic Beck stuff of the &quot;Guitar Shop&quot; power trio (Beck/Hymas/Bozzio) and the more densely techno 2001 release &quot;You Had It Coming&quot;, which features stranger Jennifer Batten and Andy Wright influences. This album has a bit of everything. The minimalist funk of &quot;Space for Papa&quot;, &quot;Brush with the Blues&quot;, a traditional blues that Jeff builds up and then shreds apart, and gorgeous whispers of &quot;Another Place&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot;. Jan Hammer tunes always bring out the best in Jeff Beck, and &quot;Even Odds&quot; is no exception---it is the exceptional track on the album that will remind you of prior collaborations like &quot;Star Cycle&quot;.
B000001DQI|5.0|I recently started listening again to this remastered CD and must write again to say that yes, this is a GREAT album! It was a nice follow-up to Don't Shoot Me, another excellent pop- sounding venture. <br />Though I still prefer earlier, more mature works like Madman Across the Water and Honky Chateau, I certainly continue to enjoy his mega-seller  GYBR and appreciate the wide diversity of songs that a good double album like this provides.  Songs like Funeral/Love Lies Bleeding, Bennie and the Jets, Grey Seal, I've Seen that Movie Too, All the Young Girls Love Alice, Roy Rodgers, Sweet Painted Lady, Candle in the Wind, Danny Bailey and Saturday Night's Alright for Fightin' showcase (what was at the time) Elton's great talent.  Back then, Elton exuded great enery and excitement.<br />Also, the production is outstanding.  As with all of his &quot;earlier&quot; (read: 70's) works, the production by Gus Dudgeon is really good!  It's just too bad that he's not still producing Elton- except for an occasional song here and there, nothing has been as good since. I doubt that that's coincidental. Creative production has been lacking for some time (except for some of &quot;The One&quot;)<br />For those of you unfamiliar with earlier albums- check out Tumbleweed Connection, Madman Across the Water, Honky Chateau and Don't Shoot Me, I'm Only the Piano Player.  Along with GYBR, these are the cream of the crop.
B00004XONN|4.0|This album is not as groundbreaking as people say, other artists have fiddled with electronic music as a melodic tool before.  It's just that Radiohead has one thing that all those other groups such as autechre and aphex twin and others don't have; Radiohead has Thom Yorke.  He keeps this album from becoming a complete mess, his voice gives the album the cohesion it needs.  The album blends perfectly together from track to track, letting it be an album that can be listened to straight through, over and over again.  My personal favorite tracks are Optimistic, Everything in it's right place, and Idioteque.  Although most of the album is pretty good.  The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5, is that I have heard better than this, this style of music is nothing new, so I can't justify giving it a perfect rating.  But it is well worth buying.  Also I like where Radiohead is heading, the ultimate masterpiece is just around the corner, I know it.
B00003CXPD|5.0|Thats definitly the best movie Ive ever seen in my whole life. The story is so simple but very heart-touching.Ive seen it for 5 times.Always when the movie had ended the whole audience was silent.At my last visit I had almost cried because there are lots of details you dont recognize at the 1st or 2nd visit. Jamie Bells performence as Billy is very impressive. Billy Elliot derserves the higest recognition, I was dissapointed when I heard it doesnt get a Oscar nomination for Best Picture. Cant wait to own it on DVD.
B00000BKDW|3.0|This has some pretty cool songs, but I think the Number of the Beast is a little better.  And also, after a while they tend to sound like Judas Priest, a better band in my opinion.For some great heavy metal check out Judas Priest, (early) Metallica, and the tightest band I've ever heard, Pantera.
B000006TRV|5.0|In The Wall, Pink Floyd ask us, if we want to know what's behind these cold eyes, we'll just have to claw through the disguise. And that is exactly what they set out to do. The album could be called, &quot;The Deconstruction of a Rock Star&quot;. Part autobiographical and part social satire, it tells a story of alienation. Alienation from fans, alienation from each other and finally, alienation from oneself, which is essentially, insanity. The first side of the album deals with the past experiences of the main character and their contribution to his insanity. Personal experiences such as growing up without a father due to WWII, the humiliation by teachers in school, and over-protective parenting are used as points of departure for their connection to larger social concerns like violence and oppression, deficient and stifling educational systems, and madness.      The second part of the album deals mostly with the main characters' own ruminations. Now, behind the wall, closed off from the world, he is lost in his own tormented mind. Through this, The Wall sets out to, and does so brilliantly, depict some of the psychological mechanisms that might be at the root of emotions like hate and fear, and could eventually culminate in destruction and violence.        The music is phenomenal. It represents the full realization of every direction the band was moving in since Waters became the primary creative influence, as well as a new level of musicianship and ambiance, un-mathced in earlier albums. The Wall has been critisized in the past for it's somber mood. However, I find the mood is more adequately described with words like meditative or contemplative. It is not, however, what you would call a &quot;feel-good&quot; type of album, so if that is what you're looking for, than try picking up &quot;The Bay City Rollers&quot; or something.

0449227421|3.0|This is my second Ken Follett (my first was &quot;paper money&quot; which was very good). It is a bit like seeing a slick Holywood action movie, the time passes and it is good entertainment and there is ever some insight of some of the characters but on the whole it is pritty empty and manipulative. I enjoyed paper money so much I am not going to give up but if this was the first KF novel I read I am not sure I would want to try another.
B00000IAU3|5.0|What nobody seens to have mentioned about the increasingly popular Dido,is about how the brilliant 'Here with me'is the theme song for the tv series 'Roswell' which I immensely enjoy.This is how I first heard Dido at the beginning of 2000, in Australia and I had to hear more...what a fantastic albulm!!! Hopefully she may tour here one day.
B000005IRG|5.0|I heard about Television while looking up information on the Talking Heads.  The book I read (ha ha) contained a less than lukewarm review of this album here, in fact much like the title of my review.  But as I flipped through pages I came across the editor's top ten albums of all time, and Marquee rode in at number one.  <br />I was a bit curious so I checked it out from the library and gave it a couple good spins on the old cd player.  I was not impressed.  I returned the cd and thought nothing of the ordeal at all. Six months later, I was humming along to the title track, having never fully remembered the vocals.  I rushed out and bought a copy and it hasn't left my cd player for more than a week since.<br />The bottom line, if you've read through the rest of the interviews you already know, Marquee Moon is alot of things, but being immediately accessable isn't one of them. Its a bold stroke to what American punk aspired to do, and in the brief span of eight tracks, accomplished.  Its breaking every rule of rock by being the first to actually follow them to the letter.  It slices the blues away from music to heighten the rock.  It infuses a musical richness to a style that even in 1977 was thought of as little more than primal.  And along with Patti Smith, Richard Hell, and The Talking Heads, proved that punk could be intelligent and confrontational without wallowing in passing social ills.  Oh, yeah they play guitars on this album too.<br />But in closing, just remember, when you first listen to this album, you'll hate it.  Everyone does, its natural, but with each subsequent listen another layer will be evident and in the end you'll wonder how you lived without it.
B0000000LI|5.0|I have some other works of Yanni - some studio recordings of his. They were soft and soothing but at some points they are a sort of bore. Then I bought this title. 'Awesome' is the first word that comes to my mouth. I think it is Yanni's best performance ever. His vibrant tunes are arranged in an exotic manner. The music is good and the arrangement and sequencing is the work of a genius. The bass, violin and bass guitar backgrounds are truly great. I would rate the songs in this order: Within Attraction (best of all, just listen to it! Violins, percussion - it has everything), Swept Away(very good), Keys of Imagination (the rythm pattern is same as that of 'Within Attraction' but the percussion part is great), The Rain Must Fall (depends on your taste, has a nice guitar part), Acroyali (lively) and Santorini (sheer grandeur). The other tracks are good too.
B000005ZGZ|4.0|Red Medicine was a hard act to follow.  The disc was a double miracle of being both experimental and accessable... But Fugazi was never one to be intimidated by such things, three years later they released End Hits to the world.<br />On the surface the album sounds different than its predecessor, however there's little new innovation here, just further solidifying.  For example, Red had a very laid back feel, almost as if all the tracks were jammed out for the album, here the production is very angular, so the transitions are very choppy between the different parts.  Now this might seem like a problem, but it so happens that band is writing the catchiest riffs in their recording history, so on occaision this plays to the song's favor (as in break or foreman's dog).<br />Its also surprising to note that despite the above flaw, many of the songs sound terrific live, one might almost say that this is the &quot;More Songs About Buildings and Food&quot;  of Fugazi's albums.  Lyrically, the boys hold it together.  Bassist Lally turns out his finest performance, Ian continues on with his twenty plus years of relevance with five corporations, and Guy just has a good time all around.<br />hits(break, f/d, recap modotti, five corporations, foreman's dog, floating boy).  misses(Closed Captioned by a bit)<br />But should you buy the album?  Yes, but I would recommend getting Red first.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Well, this is one of the BEST movies I've ever seen. If you expected some bloody action, you will get it but it won't be the thing that you might have wanted; just killing and getting bad guys. No, it's not that kind of action movie. It has THEMES. That makes this movie very diffrent from those Stenven Seagal movies(obvious, isn't it?). I'm not saying this movie is for those who 'educated and knows stuffs' but for everyone! When you watch it, you WILL feel something, and you will think about it. That's what happened to me when i watched it first time(i watched this movie about 7 times ever since and i think i'm beginning to understand what i felt but..i won't tell ya, you figure it out by yerself).  I'm not talking about the obvious theme; mankind's desire to return to the primitive life they once had long time ago, which is nothing but a cliche. However this movie has something else, more than that. So like i said, when you watch it, you will feel it. Go and grab one and you will thank me for that or you'll never know what you have missed.
B000001FY9|5.0|This is a must have for any Bob fan, or a great overview of his music. Granted this doesn't have a lot of Bob's best, but that's what box sets are for. So, I say this to any one who is just starting to get into Bob, or is thinking about buying one of his CD's. Buy this one, and I promise you will not only get your moneys worth, but you will fall in love. You honestly can't help but love Bob! Put this one in your shopping basket,and I promise you will be glad that you did!
0553293397|5.0|I read this book even before i read the other Robot detective books and i found this book fascinating! Baley's work in this book is quite great and i loved the story as well as the logic shown. After reading this i bought the other robot books and after reading the Caves of Steel I could understand Baley's queer behavior in this book(jush as agrophobia). So I would recommened to read those books in order. the Caves of Steel, the Naked Sun, and the Robots in the Dawn. However the order doesn't really matter. You can enjoy this book without great knowledge about the other Robot books.
B00004T9UF|4.0|I have to admit, I surprised myself and my friends by purchasing this album, but I also have to admit I am glad.  Although the lyrical content is surprising and sometimes a bit scary, there are parts I can't help but laugh to when I hear them.  Eminem truly has talent--both rapping, singing and acting, and I hope he continues making work as great as this.
0553278398|5.0|This is the most entertaining book among the Foundation series. Other Fondation books usually deal with political issues and lots of talk and talk and talk but this book has some action. (Poor Harry Seldon would have never imagined that himself would have been a active young man who could do some martial art and do some physical stuffs when he first appeared in the Foundation) The style is very much like the Currents of Space and this book is just as well written as the Currents of Space. If you like adventure and thrill just try this book even if u don't know what Foundation series is. Well, but 'some' knowledge over the history of Earth (Asimov history, that is) would be quite helpful to understand the whole situation. (When I read the book i didn't know about the Aurora and Earth stuffs and didn't quite understand..so i had to read it again after i finished the Robot triology)
630021463X|3.0|Here's just one example of overreaching to get a laugh: Scotty's mistaking a mouse for a microphone to be used in talking to the computer. Would he really be that ignorant of early computer technology? If you went back in time and saw an early typewriter, would you look for the electric cord or the disk drive? The point I'm getting at is that the humor was contrived. There were good moments in the film (Kirk and Gillian in the pizza parlor, for example). But there were also many heavy-handed moralistic moments regarding the whales, along with the aforementioned forced humor. So 3 stars is about the most I can give it.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Well, this is one of the BEST movies I've ever seen. If you expected some bloody action, you will get it but it won't be the thing that you might have wanted; just killing and getting bad guys. No, it's not that kind of action movie. It has THEMES. That makes this movie very diffrent from those Stenven Seagal movies(obvious, isn't it?). I'm not saying this movie is for those who 'educated and knows stuffs' but for everyone! When you watch it, you WILL feel something, and you will think about it. That's what happened to me when i watched it first time(i watched this movie about 7 times ever since and i think i'm beginning to understand what i felt but..i won't tell ya, you figure it out by yerself).  I'm not talking about the obvious theme; mankind's desire to return to the primitive life they once had long time ago, which is nothing but a cliche. However this movie has something else, more than that. So like i said, when you watch it, you will feel it. Go and grab one and you will thank me for that or you'll never know what you have missed.
6300213803|3.0|Although the movie had its good points, I subtract 2 stars for the ridiculous space battle that has the two starships tacking and maneuvering like the Bonhomme Richard going up against the Serapis. There hasn't been a sillier pseudo-sea-battle-in-space since that Original Series episode where the Romulan ship and the Enterprise engage in a destroyer/submarine duel.
B000002572|5.0|I've owned this album since high school, a couple of years after it came out, and I never play it.  I also have not bought the cd.  Why?  Because more than a quarter century after this album came out, most of the songs are still in heavy rotation on all the rock stations in my city.  I've heard the lovely &quot;More Than A Feeling&quot; and the brawny &quot;Long Time&quot; on the radio at least once a week for my entire adult life.  And I'm not tired of them yet!<br />This album is far greater than anything else the band did subsequently, is greater than the band itself, in fact.  (Though it is remarkable that Tom Scholz was able to come up with a gem like &quot;Amanda&quot; years later, after it seemed that the band was finished)  Pick an adjective!  Soaring, searing guitars, cathedrals of sound production, great hard rock singing, beautiful melodies, meaty rock riffs that never get stale...I guess it was just too much to expect them to top this, or even reproduce it in concert.<br />Punk and disco both happened around the time this album was released, so if you're fond of classifying things into time periods, you could say that this was the last great album of the classic rock era.  The fact that most listeners today would rather spin this than anything from those other two genres is just another sign of its greatness.
B00000HYXB|5.0|masterfull thats all i can say about this cd it was the first one i picked up by them and it just floored me great metal.the concept of tolkinen.just great pick up at all cost at all costs
B000001F5F|5.0|From the opening, &quot;This is Gloria!&quot; I was hooked on this album.  Althought way too short, the album perfectly captures the raw energy of the early U2.  Every time Bono say &quot;The Edge!&quot; before a solo, I get goosebumps. Much more stripped down than anything to follow, this live album is edgy and hard rocking.  Larry Mullen's drums are in your face, especially in songs like Sunday Bloody Sunday. A definite must have for any U2 fan
B00000IMYA|5.0|When I decided to review this set, I took along several ideas, some of which have been adequately covered by other reviewers, but I think I can add some additional perspective.<br />There are only a few tracks I've ever heard in Jazz that approach the power and intensity of &quot;Diminuendo/Crescendo in Blue&quot; (Louis Armstrong's &quot;Stardust&quot;, Miles Davis' &quot;All Blues&quot;, Coltrane's &quot;My Favorite Things&quot;, Lee Morgan's &quot;The Sidewinder&quot;) come to mind), but to simply say that does not do the performance justice. Now, it's obvious that Gonsalves' solo is the glue holding it together, and that can be analyzed on its own merits (the fact that he held on for 27 choruses - over 10 minutes - is notable in of itself, but the way the intensity keeps building makes you want to play the track again and again), yet the credit goes to the Duke for conceiving of the idea of using a sax solo in the first place (where previously he had played the interval on piano), and for leading it off with some swinging piano. Over 14 minutes in total, the track simply rocks (if I may use such heresy!). Particularly notable is the understated way in which Ellington introduces the track - giving absolutely no hint of the fireworks to come.<br />But one would be truly remiss to ignore or overlook the rest of this fine two-disc set, which sets a mood from beginning to end. The fine and voluminous liner notes (2 sets) adequately detail what went on that particular July evening in Newport as well as the remarkable story behind the making of this set (alluded to above in the commentary).  The fact that Duke and his band had a break of a few hours in the middle of their set probably lent a harder edge to the performances when they returned to the stage with &quot;Take the A Train&quot; (a particularly spirited rendition of the classic).  From there, things only got more interesting as Duke introduced his newly-written 3-part &quot;Festival Suite&quot;. This band plays like it had something to prove, and prove it they did.<br />There are many fine moments available here, and each one who listens will probably claim her/his own favorites, but I enjoyed &quot;Tea for Two&quot; and &quot;Tulip or Turnip&quot; along with the selections I listed above. This is a large investment for the music buyer as a two-disc set, but let me add my voice to the chorus: if you need to be introduced to the music of the Duke (and get an idea of what he was all about), if you want to own a true musical milestone in the history of Jazz, or simply want to hear a band &quot;blowing it out&quot;, look NO further.<br />You've arrived at Ellingtonia in all its majesty!
B00004WG4G|5.0|I just want to say that this is a true masterpiece! And to the reviewers like the &quot;too distrurbing&quot; one, let me say this: American Beauty is NOT an educational movie. When that reviewer says: &quot;if you're a parent you won't like it&quot; come on! that's so stupid. A good movie doesn't necessary have to be optimistic. You can't say &quot;it's too disturbing to be good&quot;. It doesn't have anything to do.<br />And again: no one said this was an educational movie ok? don't get confused, you &quot;parents&quot;.
B000000OSE|5.0|This is easily the best of the two albums in the 'Use Your Illusion' range. Although 'coma' goes on for a bit too long the album redeems itself with songs like 'don't damn me' and a wonderful cover of Paul and Linda McCartney's 'live and let die'. Without a doubt this is a must have for any Guns n' Roses fan and any fans of this genre.
0792151712|5.0|great movie
B000021XR5|5.0|NO. 4 PROVES THAT STP STILL HAS WHAT IT TAKES.  OF COURSE AFTER THE ALBUM &quot;TINY SONGS FROM THE BAND THAT USED TO PUT OUT GOOD STUFF&quot;, THEY COULD HAVE ONLY IMPROVED.  IT'S AS IF SCOTT REALLY CLEANED UP HIS ACT, THEY WENT BACK INTO THE STUDIO AND WORKED LIKE DOGS, AND THE RESULT IS A RECORD THAT RIVALS EVEN THEIR FIRST TWO.  ALTHOUGH SOME MIGHT ARGUE IF SCOTT IS INDEED DRUG-FREE AFTER SEEING THE VIDEO TO &quot;SOUR GIRL&quot;.  ANYHOW #4'S SONGS RUN TOGETHER WITH A SMOOTH EFFORTLESSNESS THAT MAKES ME THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE NAMED IT &quot;EAR CANDY&quot; OR SOMETHING. &quot;SOUR GIRL&quot;, &quot;I GOT YOU&quot; AND &quot;ATLANTA&quot; ARE THE RECORD'S SLOW SONGS, BUT SLOW DOESN'T HAVE TO BE BAD, PEOPLE. &quot;I GOT YOU&quot; IS A GREAT SONG AND &quot;ATLANTA&quot; IS AS UNIQUE AS IT IS AMAZING. IT'S LYRICS ARE MEANINGFUL AND THE MELODY IS BEAUTIFUL.  THE WAY THE SONG FADES AWAY AT THE END WITH WHAT SOUNDS LIKE FLUTE OR SOMETHING IS REMARKABLE.  THESE SONGS REALLY DISPLAY THEIR DIVERSITY AND FULL SOUND WHEN COMPARED WITH HARD-HITTERS LIKE &quot;NO WAY OUT&quot;, &quot;SEX &amp; VIOLENCE&quot; AND &quot;PRUNO&quot;.  THEN THERE'S THE RELAXING MELANCHOLY FOLW OF SONGS LIKE &quot;GLIDE&quot;.  5 STARS FOR STP AS THEY APPEAR TO HAVE RECAPTURED THE MAGIC THAT THEY EXPLODED ONTO THE MUSIC SCENE WITH.  SCOTT REALLY SHOWS HIS DYNAMIC VOCAL RANGE ON THIS RECORD AS WELL, WHICH IS ANOTHER REASON #4 IS SO DAMN GOOD.  HE HAS A NATURAL HIGHNESS TO HIS VOICE THAT REALLY GOES WELL WITH THE MUSIC.  PLUS HE'S SINGING MORE THAN HE'S SCREAMING.  THIS RECORD IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST HAVE.  IT'S ON BEST SELLER LISTS EVERYWHERE AND FOR GOOD REASON. THEIR NEWFOUND ENTHUSIASM AND EARNESTNESS REALLY SHOW THROUGH.  FANS AREN'T STUPID.  WE RECOGNIZE SOMETHING THAT'S FANTASTIC AND WE TELL OUR FRIENDS AND THEY TELL THEIR FRIENDS.  BRENDAN O'BRIEN HAS THE GUYS BACK ON THE RIGHT TRACK AND THIS LISTENER CAN'T WAIT FOR #5!
6304083769|3.0|This dub is awful... You miss the entire point of the story (which is very profound). On this version Moltoko just seems like a confused woman. Not the profound, and brilliant being that she was in the english subtitled version. If you ever saw both versions of this movie you would NEVER trust another dub again. The storyline is great (5 stars), but the translation is just silly (0 stars). It makes the movie seem like a cop flick rather than an anime tale. Buy the SUBTITLED VERSION and watch this story come alive..<br />get.to/thejewel.com
B00000K0DQ|4.0|Here is a film which really makes you think... About Religion, Social disparity, Political pork-barreling and about the Death Penalty... about our modern way of Life and the way we deal - or don't deal - with issues that for some of us are better hidden away from public view, managed by &quot;experts&quot; whom we are happy to pay to do our dirty work...<br />For me this film raised a storm of emotion... The brilliant portrayal of the different characters involved - massaged by an empathetic direction - really allowed all sides of the story to be seen, felt and experienced... The result was deeply disturbing and from both an ethical and moral point of view left me with more questions than answers.<br />The sound track is deeply evocative and the mixture of Indian traditional Classical Sitar interwoven with the equally classical sounds of the &quot;Deep South&quot; wore exceptionally well.<br />As a non-American, there were times when understanding the idiom was quite difficult: this was exacerbated by the fact that in certain parts of the Audio on this DVD, the lip-synch dialogue was out by at least 6-8 frames.  Finally - were it not for the crackles, pops and other idiosyncrasies of the Sound-track - I would have rated this film a 5-Star PLUS!  If you don't mind an indifferently synched and technically poor audio track, then this film is a MUST of the genre to be included in any serious collection.
B000002MIY|5.0|First, a history of Gaucho. Walter Becker was in a bad car accident at the time of the recording of that album, so Gaucho was essentially a Fagen solo album. Now I'll tell you a story of two parallel and slightly fanciful post-Gaucho universes. In universe one, Becker dies and Fagen decides to record another album as Steely Dan - one that is even more synth-driven than Gaucho. Without Becker's influence, synthesizers come to the fore, guitars almost disappear, the sound becomes very slick, and Fagen writes unexpectedly sentimental and strangely sci-fi lyrics.  He calls the album &quot;The Nightfly.&quot; In universe two, Becker recovers after the car crash, and Becker and Fagen decide to record a Steely Dan album together.  It is a funkier album that is more balanced between keyboards and guitars.  They call this album &quot;Kamakiriad.&quot;<br />My point in conducting this thought-experiment is to show that either of Fagan's solo albums could have been a worthy Steely Dan follow-up to Gaucho, depending upon whether Fagen carried the group's banner alone (as in &quot;The Nightfly&quot;) or with Becker (who produced Fagan's &quot;Kamakiriad&quot; and play on some of the tracks), but Fagan's solo albums sounds do not sound alike (except for the penchant for the '50's futurama sci-fi lyrics). The difference in the albums' sounds are, I think, largely a function of Becker's involvement in Kamakiriad. Becker doesn't let Fagen's keyboards dominate the album the way they do on the Nightfly, because Becker plays guitar.<br />There's not a bad track on Kamakiriad, although some are stronger than others.  The songs are an appealing blend of funk, jazz, and smooth pop. For my money, the two best songs are &quot;Snowbound&quot; (with a great Becker bass-line) and &quot;On the Dunes.&quot; They have an appealing mixture of compelling melodies and strong, assured musicianship.  It certainly holds its own against Steely Dan's albums
0399146253|5.0|I have read the entire series of Patricia Cornwell books where she writes about Dr. Kay Scarpetta and all of them are excellent reading. If you just getting started on this series I would suggest that you read them in the order that they were written in since the books do tie into each other. It is an excellent series and is worth the time to read them. It is one twist after another as she finds the killer or killers with the help of her neice and a police captian. They should all be rated at least 4 star reading.
B000002KBU|5.0|Joni Mitchell's best album!  Combines her upbeat guitar songs like &quot;Carey&quot; &quot;All I Want&quot; and &quot;California&quot; with soft and beautiful piano in &quot;Blue&quot; &quot;River&quot; &quot;My Old Man&quot; &quot;The Last Time I Saw Richard&quot; etc.  This is one of those great albums that you can listen to over and over. . .
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|This album is certainly a strong departure from the heavily electronic sounds of the wonderful &quot;homogenic&quot; to a much more &quot;Broadway-musical&quot; scene. But make no mistake, this album has all the things that have made Björk so great. However I would suggest that before you buy it you watch the movie first (I've seen it 3 times already). It will give you a much better understanding of the album and you'll appreciate it much more. I bought it before seeing the movie and I liked the album but I absolutely loved it after the movie. The album starts off (like the movie) with &quot;Overture&quot; which is a purely instrumental song. The next song, &quot;Cvlada&quot;, is absolutely brilliant with the music being generated trough the noises in a factory. And Catherine Deneuve does a pretty good job in this song although her voice can't be compared to Björk's. Afterwards you'll see the Oscar-nominated &quot;I've seen it all&quot;. Once again the song is born from ambient sounds being in this case a train. Many Björk fans will find this song particularly interesting as it's sang by both Björk and Radiohead's vocalist Thom Yorke and as many of you know a lot of people that like Björk like Radiohead. Afterwards you have &quot;Scatterheart&quot; which is much more electronic than the previous songs. The lyrics on the song are quite different from those in the movie but it's a fantastic song nevertheless. &quot;In the musicals&quot; sounds just like its name: A song from a musical but with an excellent percussion and very interesting changes in rhythm. 107 steps is absolutely wonderful. The synchronisation between the woman on the background counting from 1-107 and Björk singing specific numbers is fabulous. The album closes with &quot;New world&quot; which is based on the rhythm of &quot;Overture&quot; but with percussion, electronic sounds and Björk's lyrics. I personally regard it as one of the best on the album with an impeccable instrumentation and outstanding vocals.<br />Some people have complained about the album being too short. Though it's some 37 minutes long (If I'm not mistaken) I believe that on the quality aspect there's nothing to complain about it. Maybe if Björk had decided to produce a less &quot;cleaner&quot; album she could have added the movie version of &quot;Scatterheart&quot; as I personally love the part when she sings &quot;...the time it takes a tear to fall, a snake to shed it's skin, it's all the time that's needed to forgive me...&quot;. She could have also added the song about &quot;a few of my favourite things&quot; and the &quot;next to last song&quot; would certainly bring tears to my eyes every time I listened to it.<br />But like I mentioned earlier, I strongly recommend that you watch the movie first (Which is one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time) and when you exit the theatre buy the CD and I assure you that you'll enjoy it a lot as you'll understand both the lyrics and the sounds of the album. However, if you're not going to see the movie, you'll be missing out on a fantastic movie but you should buy the album anyway. But I can tell you from personal experience that it doesn't sound half as good as it sounds after you've seen it.
B00004YKSD|5.0|Oliver Stone's &quot;The Doors&quot; is a blistering, visually hypnotic, visceral and memorable film about Jim Morrison, that leather-wearing idol of the rock world. &quot;The Doors&quot; perfectly captures an era during which an enduring artist emerged. Like &quot;Platoon,&quot; &quot;Born On The Fourth Of July&quot; and &quot;JFK,&quot; &quot;The Doors,&quot; which is less-serious than those other movies, is still an important dramatic film document of an era America, indeed, the whole world lived through. Val Kilmer gives his greatest performance as the rock star Morrison. Nothing Kilmer has done surpasses this. He seems possessed, incredibly making us forget who he is and making us believe that he IS Jim Morrison. He even sang most of the material live, especially the live concerts and went hoarse from doing the 1969 Miami concert sequence. He captures the energy and madness we see in Morrison's most wild performances. Stone's film is not an inside job into Morrison, but an outside view of the man and his times. And of course, there's some great music here. There are truly hypnotic scenes, like the one where the band performs &quot;The End&quot; at the Whisky A Go-Go. And on DVD the visuals look great. Of course there is a lot of unpleasantness when we see Morrison falling deeper into the trap of decadence brought by fame. But I think Stone was giving a warning of how excess can kill a great artist. The concert sequences are spectacular and have the authenticity of a documentary. I do agree that it is one of Stone's lesser movies, but still a good one. It is the best rock movie made so far. Of course it shouldn't be declared THE definitive account of Jim Morrison, but it should be seen by anyone who's either a fan of The Doors, intrigued by the 60s, or is just looking for a true rock movie. Vibrant and alive, &quot;The Doors&quot; is a blast.
B000002BPS|5.0|In my opinion this is the best offspring cd.  The rest are really good, i would have given them all 5 stars, had i not hear this one.  It is not as hard as smash and the ones before smash, but it is not as &quot;poppy&quot; as the ones afterwards.  It is probably my favorite cd of my collection.
B000002BMV|5.0|I LOVE this cd. My favorite cd of all time. I've been a professional musician for over 20 years and these guys are the real deal. I'm sorry for some of you that it isn't &quot;dark&quot;, and they made sure the guitars were in tune, and Steve Perry can sing (this is now called 'over produced'), unlike bands of today who screech their low monotones. I'm sorry if that offends you in some way. Journey is not trying to make a political statement. They are just writing about things that everybody thinks about. Sure, it's commercial sounding, but that doesn't make it bad, that just gives it greater listening appeal to more people. Now, to pick on the rest of you: I didn't grow up in the 60's. I grew up in the 70's and 80's. Yes, I think the Beatles are fantastic, but if I were left on a desert island, I'd rather have &quot;Escape&quot; than any Beatles or Jimi album. Sorry! Journey is just what I'd rather listen to. Every band has some crap songs. However, I think that Escape is 99% good music. The only song I wouldn't give a '10' to is &quot;Dead Or Alive&quot;, though it is still good. Sometimes more artsy stuff like Jimi or the Beatles can get hard to listen to, especially some of John Lennon's wierd crap. I appreciate ground breaking artists like the Beatles and Jimi Hendrix, but music has evolved. The bottom line is I'd give Escape 5 stars and Revolver 4. Sorry, it is just what I like more. Now, please re-read the title for this review...........
6304342160|1.0|Some people appreciate this movie because they like watching women in sexual relationships together, and in this film Gina Gershon plays a lesbian plumber who hooks up with a gangster's girlfriend (Jennifer Tilly). Personally I am not a fan of either actress, so this made the film rather unbelievable. The first time I saw this, I rented it. The clerk at the video store asked me several times if I was really sure that I wanted that film because it could be quite ugly and disturbing. And I did. I rented it and found that while it was not particularly ugly or disturbing, it just wasn't good. The two women scheme to try to get a large sum of money from the gangster boyfriend, which will get the gangster boyfriend in trouble with higher-ups... which will get him killed. But the story is not presented well. Gershon is convincing in her role, but Tilly is never convincing to me in hers. The other people were so plain that I don't remember them at all. Gershon's skepticism about Tilly's honesty is the best and most convincing part here. But to each his own.
B00004W5UA|1.0|This film is a tragedy-- not as a film itself, but in that it exists in the first place.  This is glorification of mindless violence-- unsubstantiated violence.  The film is well made, and therein lies the problem.  Films, by design, are mediums of manipulation.  The better the film, the more convincing.  This film forces/allows the audience to not only feel good, but inteligent and scholarly in their enjoyment of senseless violence.  This film is an atrocity particularly because it is  well made.  To modify Robert McKee, this is a horrible story, well told.  By all means, avoid this film unless you want to rationalize your disgusting and worthless existence.
0767819462|2.0|Way, way, way too overemotional and contrived. Ed Harris wants to marry his girlfriend, Julia Roberts. But his kids from his previous marriage to Susan Sarandon don't like her, and Susan Sarandon hates her. So naturally she has to win them all over... and of course tragedy has to happen, so Susan is stricken with cancer and will be out of the picture soon enough. Yes, there are some winning moments here. It would be difficult to have a film with all these well known and often brilliant actors without having some really great moments. But overall this is not a thrilling or interesting film.
B000002UB3|5.0|Along with Rubber Soul, Abbey Road showcases the greatest band in history at their best.  There's not a single weak song on the album, and each song showcases the Beatle's varied talents.  John is typically stereotyped as the rocker of the group, and &quot;Come Together&quot; and &quot;I Want You (She's So Heavy)&quot; support that.  Yet, &quot;Because&quot; demonstrates that he could write gorgeous harmonies with the best of them, while &quot;Oh Darling&quot; shows that Paul was no slouch in the hard rock department either.  Ringo's quirky humor can be heard in his &quot;Octopus's Garden,&quot; and the album shows George Harrison at his writing peak.  It's impossible not to feel better after hearing &quot;Here Comes the Sun,&quot; and &quot;Something&quot; is so good that Sinatra called it the greatest love song of the past 50 years.  And then there's the grand finale...<br />If this album isn't in your music collection, get it.  You'll be glad you did.
0792140346|4.0|I watched this year's Golden Globes and the completely annoyingcoverage provided by the E channel-- Joan and Melissa Rivers. Havethere ever been two more annoying people in the world? And the factthat they feed off each other's annoying behaviour is all theworse. If E were to do a serious pre-awards show, they might have twopeople out there greeting stars who actually know something aboutthem. I witnessed Joan Rivers talking to the multitalented but muchunderrated Laura Linney. Rivers asked Linney how she would follow upher critically acclaimed performance in You Can Count on Me, andLinney replied that she would be working on a project with RichardGere. Rivers asked if that would be intimidating to work with someoneas famous and well known as Gere. Any entertainment reporter worth adamn would know that Linney held her own quite well opposite RichardGere in this film, Primal Fear. Linney was gracious of course andinformed Rivers that she is lucky because she has worked with Gerebefore. I just recently saw Primal Fear. I had always wanted to see itbecause I have seen all of Edward Norton's subsequent performances.Knowing that his powerful performance in Primal Fear more or lesslaunched his highly diverse and successful career made me curious, butI never quite got around to it. But finally I did. And a stunningperformance Norton offered indeed. His dual personalities (which turnout to be a deception on his part) are skillfully executed, and hemanages to dupe everyone. Richard Gere is the perfect person for therole of an arrogant, high powered attorney who thinks he can defendthe lowest of the low and get them off the hook. He plays this sort ofrole best. Linney is the prosecutor who has shared what she calls asix month long one night stand with Gere's character. She is alsoassigned to prosecute the case against Norton's character while Geretakes on Norton's character's case.  Excellent in small but importantroles are Frances McDormand as a psychiatrist and John Mahoneyas theattorney general, Shaugnessy. (It was sort of strange to see him playa semi-bad guy. And to see him calling Gere \\"Marty\\"-Mahoney'scharacter's name on the hit tv show Frasier). Also excellent was AlfreWoodard as the no-nonsense judge assigned to the case.  As Gere'sassistants, Maura Tierney and Andre Braugher were good to see...nothing special but early work for them. This was a superb film fullof suspense and a surprise ending.
B00003CXP1|5.0|The only way I could describe 'Requiem' is the most brutal and horrific downspiraling I have ever seen happen on film to its characters.  This movie uses imagery, color, and editing in ways that mix and combine their various powers and lash out, leaving you almost senseless after watching it.<br />It takes place in Coney Island, NY, and follows the relative descent of four characters, seperately and together.  On one side, you have Jared Leto, his best friend, Marlon Wayans, and girlfriend, Jennifer Connelly, all trying to structure their futures while shooting up heroin.  Then you have Leto's mother, in an courageous and flawless performance by Ellen Burstyn, who thinks she is going to win a junk-mail contest and be on television.  That ignites a flame in her to lose weight as quickly as possible, and in doing so she becomes addicted to physician-described diet pills.<br />There is a nice, slow buildup through the film, showing a combination of complete utopia of the drugs, and the destructive results as well.  The interaction of an amazing script, direction, acting, scoring and editing holds up every seen, and your eyes are locked, horrified but not able to turn away.  Slowly, things break down and all hope is lost in this psychotic assault overload.  <br />Darren Aronofsky follows up 'Pi' in a way I wish I could describe with doing justice.  To think that this film is only his second shocks to me as to what his future might hold.  He creates moments of rapture which he easily discards for pieces of vague, hallucinogetic, nightmarish visions.  Every scene is carved to near perfection, and they are stacked in such a way that you couldn't walk out if you wanted to.  <br />Beware of this film and it's bravery, and make sure you keep away from the sure-to-pop-up Rated-R cut.  I imagine it will butcher the film, even if only seconds are removed.
6301963911|4.0|I have only recently been initiated into the Woody Allen movie world. I love listening to him... sometimes he is neurotic and tends to go on and on and on, but sometimes he reminds me of myself. I get so annoyed so often with the littlest things that I can really relate to some of his tirades. For example, in Annie Hall, when he and Diane Keaton are standing in line at the cinema, he gets so frustrated and annoyed with the man behind him in line that he cannot stop talking about it and obsessing about it. This is so like me it is unbelievable. I suspect a lot of people must feel similar feelings... maybe to a lesser degree... otherwise Allen's sense of humour would not be as widely appreciated as it is. Also of note is Allen's intelligent sense of humour. He makes references to people, things, places, that are not common knowledge... but should be. And you really have to know a little bit about everything to understand all his references. I don't even think it is intentional in his movies. You either get it or you don't. I love it.
B0000009SY|5.0|1979 was one of the greatest years in humanity. Arsenal won the FA cup, the Pope visited Ireland, Maggie Thatcher became prime minister and the soviet union invaded afghanistan. And to top it all, Frank zappa released some seriously great albums.Orchestral favorites, sleep dirt, sheik yerbouti and joe's garage. 4 christmasses in the one year. joe's garage is a big concept album which touches on many worthy subjects like personal freedom, religion,music [....] It is narrated by the central scrutiniser(frank), and there are many funny moments from him. Many concert favourites appeared on the album-keep it greasy, catholic girls,outside now and the immortal why does it hurt when i pee? There aren't any 'instrumental' compositions but there is a heck of a lot of great zappa guitar. on the bus is on side one, a majestic solo. most of the solos are xenechrony-different performances combined to form 'strange synchronisations' . eg the drums could be from one song, the bass from another, the guitar solo from another one still. but it all works in its queer little way. keep it greasy solo is beyond words, a treasure. As is the only non-xenechronous solo watermelon in easter hay, beautiful guitar tone and soloing. So anybody who says this album is all vulgarity is not telling the full story. Yes, there's a lot of toilet humour, but what fine toilet humour! Most of the song titles speak for themselves. also we have innocuous sounding titles like catholic girls and sy borg. and the all time classic 'stick it out' the first half of which is in german. Am i allowed to say 'fich mich, der miserabler hurensahn' ? For the english translation, buy this great album, now-you won't regret it! Thank you.
B00004X01U|5.0|i have always enjoyed most of madonna's music but prior to this album i had never actually owned one of her albums (except the immaculate collection of course). her energy at the grammys inspired me to purchase &quot;music&quot; and i must admit that i am really impressed. the album is short (10 songs) but it is so creative and funky. some of the songs are just really fun with hot beats (great for dancing or working out)while others are really impressive and i would dare say inspiring. From &quot;nobody's perfect&quot; and &quot;what it feels like for a girl&quot; to &quot;impressive instant&quot; this album is one that you can just put on and let play from beginning to end. madonna is a brilliant artist and business woman. even in her 40s she can still make twenty somethings like me dance(this chick has transcended time). i absolutely love this album...and if you generally like madonna you will probably love &quot;music&quot; too.
B00004YWEA|5.0|AC/DC's Back in Black was released as Geordie vocalist Brian Johnson replaced the band's former frontman and rock legend Bon Scott, who had died months earlier. The album itself was released in the summer of 1980, and the band itself, knowing that all was riding on the album, was overcome with fear. Back in Black went on to sell over 17 million copies in the United States alone, and AC/DC went on to sell over 80 million albums in this country, and for good reason. They are a fantastic rock and roll band, nothing more nothing less. On album after album they deliver the same simple, loud, head-crunching brand of rock and roll that has earned them the right to be called legends. Some people may criticize that the band has never changed, but if you listen to Back in Black and their other albums, you'll realize that that is a great thing. This remastered version is far superior to any previous release, I recommend cranking up that bass during the song Back in Black. Every song on this album is excellent and enjoyable and there is simply not a weak track anywhere. From the opening toll of the bell in Hell's Bells, to the ending of the last track, Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution, you won't be able to stop rocking. Post-Back in Black releases were fantastic as well, but this album is truly a peak in their career. A great place to start if you want to get into a great rock n' roll band.
6305137293|3.0|Many sequels do not live up to their original.  In this case, Halloween 2 (The Nightmare Isn't Over), is quite respectable.  Though it's not quite as shocking as Halloween (1978) was, it still delivers what fans want.  You have to like the fact that Jamie Lee Curtis returns, and Donald Pleasance, but the movie mostly takes place in a dark hospital, and most of the suspense has been lost.  This film will be dumb for non-Halloween fans, but for Halloween fans, it's watchable.
6305971099|4.0|Halloween 5: the Curse of Michael Myers, is definitely watchable for anyone.  Whether you're not a fan of the series, or a die-hard fan, this film is a must-see.  Series fans might not like Michael Myers mask in this entree, or how the Myers house has changed dramatically, but other than that, everything else is great.  Danielle Harris is terrific!  This time she shares a telepathic bond with her uncle, so she knows &quot;who's next!&quot;  I definitely recommend this movie for any horror movie buff.
B000023VR6|5.0|I got this cd about a year after its release, but its still amazing even after that long time. The entire album is filled with great songs. My favorite are the watcher, forgot about dre, still dre, and the next episode. I had always liked all of those songs, but it was until i heard whats the difference that i knew i had to get this album. It shows why dre is both the best producer and a great artist. I only hope that it doesnt take him this long to make a follow up to 2001.
0553296981|3.0|The diary of a young girl is the diary of a jew that is forced into hiding during World War II.  Anne Frank's diary is an ok book , but i didn't really care for it.  It starts off with some pictures of Anne Franks life.  Also some journal entrys but in another laungue.  The introduction is done by Eleanor Roosevelt.  The book is about 283 pages long.  The diary starts off on the date of Sunday the 14th of June in 1942.  This also is the date of Anne Frank's birthday.  On her birthday she gets the diary as a present.  She then learns on the 2nd of September that her family along with a friend of their dads must go to live in a secert annex.  This book gives a full discription of  the annex.  It also shows how it would of felt to be in that position.  So i say read this book to find out how it ends.
B000001FC0|4.0|This is a fine creation of the 80's, with many classic songs.  But we must not overlook the fact that the best song on here was not even released. It's name: &quot;The Working Hour.&quot; Check it out it is haunting.
630310696X|5.0|This movie is indeed very touching.  It really brings the AIDS crisis to life and raises many questions.  Hopefully one day we will have some more answers.  Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington are superb in their roles.  It is very interesting to watch as Washington becomes more accepting of the lifestyle of homosexuals and the advent of the crisis of AIDS. What is also a nice in this film is the support Andrew Beckett(Tom Hanks) feels from his family regarding his discrimination battle.  There needs to be more positive movies showing family support today.<br /> The music of Bruce Springsteen and Neil Young fit in perfectly with the scenes of the film.  People often overlook Neil Young's song and normally I do not like Mr. Young's music.  However, this song is truly on a par with Springsteen Award Winning song as it amplifies the mood of Andrew Becket's fuenral perfectly.<br />Overall, this is one memorable movie from the 1990's and it can be appreciated by almost anyone.

B000056PWV|5.0|REAR WINDOW is probably the perfect susense-mystery.  Hitchcock includes everything in this very classy thriller with a involving romance between two compelling and enduring actors.  With humor, style, directing, script, visuals, and thrills, this one leaves you with such a satisfying feeling that it is impossible not to smile- and think about the thought-provoking visuals and themes.   Jimmy Stewart plays a man who is restricted to staying in his apartment due to being in a wheelchair.  With a socialite girlfriend(the charming Grace Kelly) and a &quot;wise&quot; physical therapist(a endearing Thelma Ritter), Stewart investigates the strange happenings going on in the apartment across from his.  As his interests grow, the trio goes through many hardships to satisfy their curiousness and prove their shocking theory.  The movie is absolutely well-paced, the structure and plot/character-development becoming more and more familiar and interesting.  Alfred Hitchcock wonderfully directs this film.  He had worked with the elegant Grace Kelly once before and had many meetings with her to talk about this film.  It was a pleasent surprise when he offered her the job of Lisa in REAR WINDOW.  Alfred Hitchcock was the master of suspense and the avant-garde.  Hitchcock was a very influential director, which he showed in this movie.  Almost all the shots originate from Stwewart's apartment.  Watch for him winding a clock in the musician/composer's apartment approximately half and hour into the movie.  The music is done by Franz Waxman, the great composer of SUNSET BLVD., THE PHILADELPHIA STORY, Hitchcock's own REBECCA, and BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN.  Story by Cornell Woolrich, script by John Michael Hayes, and costumes by Hitchcock's staple designer, Edith Head.  This was one of Hitchcock's most ingenious thrillers.  This movie is also one of wit and subtleness.  Stella, my favorite character, has two of my favorite lines- &quot;We've become a race of Peeping Toms. What people ought to do is get outside their own house and look in for a change. Yes sir. How's that for a bit of homespun philosophy?&quot; and &quot;When two people love each other, they come together - WHAM - like two taxis on Broadway.&quot;  Buy this movie and experience a classic film that overachieves almost every aspect a good drama and comedy suspense should do- will satisfy everyone from the thrill lover to the analyzer(a great film to pick apart like many other Hitchcock films), and from the people who want fun to people who want meaning and depth.  Look for themes, but enjoy this Hitchcock vintage classic.
6301955595|5.0|There's so much you can say about this work. Vivid characters, colours, and situations that practically leap off the screen into the theatre next to you. A wonderfully quirky, really very original story you only see the archetypes in after they've gone by. Graceful low-key cinematography that turns slums and sideshows into an eerily beautiful netherworld, countless images that look like you could freeze them and hang them as inspirational totems for cults we have to hope don't exist. Jodorowsky paints with a heavy, vibrant brush, but it's the perfect tone for this primal-yet-humanizing tale.<br />But I should post a warning. As far as I'm concerned, my first viewing of this film was one of the more worthwhile two hours or so I've ever spent in a theatre, and I think based on my experience that this sadly neglected wonder deserves every bit of word-of-mouth promotion it can get. But I'm betting it's not to everyone's taste.<br />So this is my advice: if you found Storaro's green and red/jungle foliage and human remains canvasses in Apocalypse Now unsettlingly beautiful the first time you saw them, and wondered momentarily whether still prints were available for hanging before realizing what you were actually suggesting to yourself, here's a film for you. If you found Delicatessan's celebration of the paradoxical beauty hiding in human ugliness and stupidity a bit too sanitized for your taste, Santa Sangre's rather murkier depths await. You will love this work.<br />If, on the other hand, you have no taste for painters who work best in human blood as opposed to oils, and/or don't appreciate a bloody carnality mixed in with your religious metaphor, you will quite probably hate it with a passion that exceeds my affection. And I don't really blame you or judge you for walking out early. It takes all kinds.<br />Either way, fondly or with revulsion, you will remember it vividly, ten years later. I can say this confidently, as that's how long it was from the first time I saw this film to the day I wrote this review. Don't say I didn't warn you.
0385334206|5.0|this was the first of vonnegut's novels that i read, and i can safely say after reading a few more of his books, that breakfast of champions is truly the quintessential vonnegut.  while his other books are all wonderful reads, this book is simply his most powerful work, in terms of social commentary and his own brand of keen wit and sarcastic brilliancy.  this novel touches on many relevant topics and at times i was in fact blown away.  i don't understand how some other reviewers could criticize this book, unless they simply took it for it's face value and failed to open their minds as to the genius layed out within its pages.  i would definitely recommend this book to any fans of great contemporary literature.
B00003CX6P|4.0|This film is an all around must see, for the beautiful cinematography alone.... Paltrow and Damon are really good and Jude Law deliciously bitchy and bad.  This film is a dark psychological thriller, and also black comedy. You will cringe and laugh and be freaked out by this strange film.
B0000042MY|5.0|I had never before bought a soundtrack for a movie that wasn't a musical. This was an exception. Who couldn't help but buy this CD? It is simply one of the most beautiful movie soundtracks of all time, as it perfectly conveys the romance, urgency, and adventure of the movie. It resonates and soars, capturing the essence of the film.<br /><br />Beautifully orchestrated, tracks one through nine were composed by Trevor Jones, and his use of drums, brass, and strings to convey the sweeping saga of the movie is masterful and full of powerful, pulse pounding emotion. Yet, at the same time the music is often poignant.<br /><br />There is a seamless transition to tracks ten through fifteen which were composed by Randy Edelman and are likewise beautiful, but lighter and more ephemeral in tone. The music is more hopeful and mellow, yet at the same time wondrously melodic.<br /><br />The collaborative efforts of the two composers have produced a timeless masterpiece. This is a CD to treasure.

B000002GQE|4.0|A unique and magical meld of pop and classical strains make for an unusually compelling CD. The symphonic orchestration of the Moody Blues' music extends their range, and somehow it all works.<br /><br />Though some of the music on this 1967 release may now seem pretentious and pedestrian, such as the poetry which is, in fact, somewhat trite and sophomoric, the rest of it is quite sublime. Two tracks in particular make this CD well worth having, \\"Forever Afternoon (Tuesday?)\\" and \\"The Night: Nights in White Satin\\". These two tracks are quintessential Moody Blues.
B0000062Y2|5.0|This album, though having pretty bad sound quality, it really one of the best recordings of Jesus Christ Superstar.  It features some of the best performances of all time in the roles. Ted Neeley, though not being the best singer the role of Jesus has ever had, conveys strong emotion in the songs and can send chills is &quot;Gethsemane&quot;.  Carl Anderson is sublime as Judas and makes you feel for the character in a way that only himself and Murray Head have done before or since.  Yvonne Elliman and Barry Dennen *are* Mary Magdelene and Pontious Pilate.  Enough said there.  The rest of the cast are also excellent and you often forget the sound quality because you are sucked into this brilliant rock Passion.  This album is entirely worth buying and you are sure to cherish it for years to come.
B000001FZK|5.0|Talk Talk were dropped by EMI after a row over their previous album, the equally brilliant SPIRIT OF EDEN.  They turned to Polydor's jazz label, Verve, to release their final album, but executives on the label must have despaired when they realised they had acquired some of the most uncommercial music ever recorded by a rock band.  The album was deleted within three months!<br />Fortunately another label has stepped in to rescue this extraordinary piece.  Talk Talk had already entered into studio lore for spending a long and expensive day recording a large brass section, keeping only the sound of a trumpeter clearing spit from his mouthpiece.<br />This is dark music, set to Mark Hollis's lyrics about sin and redemption.  I don't bother too much with words personally -- Hollis never makes it very easy for us to follow what his fragile voice is singing about.  The music is simply tremendous: spiritual, improvisatory, overflowing with ideas.  This is Hollis's LOVE SUPREME.  It is in the same vein, but in my view much better, than Radiohead's KID A.
B00004SYWZ|5.0|I have to totally agree with Majorsky.  This album sounds best in the car with the volume turned WAY up!  The first time I listened to it was with the volume down and I HATED it. You just cannot appreciate the excellent production of this record (an element that was missing from the last two a-ha albums) without being able to hear it.<br />I'd heard about this record via some European music sites that I frequent and thought that with that much &quot;buzz&quot;, it must be a good record.  This is the best a-ha album to date.  I really like it a lot. There are a couple of songs that don't appeal to me (they are towards the end of the album), but by and large a very mature, excellent piece of work.  I was pleasantly surprised to say the least!<br />I've been a fan for a long time.  It's especially nice to see Morten Harket doing some writing.  His two songs are among the best on the album.
0140177396|3.0|Let me make a declaration: John Steinbeck was a genius and a brilliant writer; however, with &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; he simply fell short. Although it was extremely well-written in Steinbeck's signature simple style, the novel was just too brief for the plot resolve itself. The resolution seemed forced and rushed. Despite this, Steinbeck did fit in an amazing amount of character development in just over one-hundred pages. I would recommend &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; over &quot;Of Mice and Men.&quot; I would also strongly urge readers to shy away from &quot;The Red Pony&quot; and &quot;The Pearl,&quot; also by John Steinbeck. READ &quot;THE GRAPES OF WRATH&quot; INSTEAD!
B00004X01U|5.0|People who write Madonna off as a has-been are wrong. They've been even more wrong about the way they slagged off her newest creation, the single &quot;Music&quot;. Music was said to be boring, a rehash, and downright quirky.<br />Yes, Music IS quirky. That's what makes it fun! Music was a real oddity on the ears when I first heard it. I couldn't wait for more. <br />I do have to admit that I was slightly disappointed in the album when it did finally arrive in late 2000, but I was expecting the same kind of tracks that the single had promised. The album itself grows on you. It is not an easy thing to just listen to and go &quot;hey wow, this is the hottest stuff in years&quot;. Listening to it in the right mindspace gives you the kind of good vibrations that will make you want to listen to it again and again.<br />The track Runaway Lover continues along the lines of the &quot;Ray of Light&quot; album. It divulges more about Madonna's own experiences in her own life (even if she may not agree). I Deserve It is a very slow number, retrospective I think is the right word. Nobody's Perfect continues on the lines of the first track, Music. Off-beat, electronic, manufactured, very apt for the song. <br />Don't Tell Me is a strange convergence between Ray of Light and Music. What It Feels Like For A Girl is very much a Ray of Light track, Paradise is more a Music track again. Gone finishes the CD off with a slow Ray of Light style number.<br />All in all, I'd say that Madonna has once again succeeded to make herself a success. The fact simply stands in the numbers, and in the popularity of her music.

6303921248|5.0|Imagine being a teenage girl in a family of five daughters. The time is nineteenth century England, and women's independence would not even be part of one's vocabulary. The only key for future happiness would be through a good marriage, but even then one would have to stillsuffer through the long hours of embroidering handkerchiefs and fire screens. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" depicts the story of true love through such obstacles and scandalous hurdles. Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle bring this classic novel to reality with the directing of Simon Langton.  Miss Elizabeth Bennet (the second eldest of five daughters) is a clever and sensible girl. She is not drawn into the false fantasies of marriage as her peers are; instead, determined to marry for true love, and if that does not find her, then to become a happy and amiable spinster. Sometimes, though, she forms her opinion of others too quickly, such as her admiration for the poor Mr. Wickham. She assumes that true hardships he faced, and that one person especially should be in the blame. What she does not realize, is that he embellished his ill treatings, and forgot to mention how he caused his own misfortunes through scandalous actions on his own part.  She also cares very much for her elder sister, Jane, and Jane returns her close affection. If Jane ever suffers from love or illness, Elizabeth is there by her side. For example, when Jane catches cold on her way to visit friends at a neighboring estate, Elizabeth trudges through the muddy English countryside, just to comfort her sister. Improving her education and entertainment with reading is but one of her many cures for idleness, and many an idle day can be found during the rainy season of England. Mr. Darcy, a very wealthy young man, is the friend to a new renter of an estate next to the Bennets' house. Being used to luxury and higher class society, he finds his friend's new country life tedious and unworthy of his attentions. At a local ball, he finds no woman handsome enough to even tempt him. As arrogant and conceited as he seems, he does have kind feelings and vast knowledge, but alas, what good can it be if a thick layer of pride is his skin?   \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" takes place in the vast, rolling countryside of England. Being filmed in restored historic houses of that time adds to the reality and beauty of the film. The film itself is a light romantic comedy that will just take your breath away. It starts with a couple of young, wealthy single gentlemen coming into the neighborhood to rent a large manor. Every neighboring family with a young daughter of around one and twenty is ecstatic, and who would not be if marrying into good connections and wealth could secure so much happiness. The Bennets, a family of five eligible daughters, are very excited, and hope to win the two men's hearts. So, they make sure their acquaintance is made, and then hope for love to take it's path. The whole family is certain that Mr. Bingley is on the verge of proposing to Jane, but unexpectedly, he leaves to London, and it seems he will stay there for the whole winter. Jane is devastated when this occurrence takes place, and Elizabeth has little hope of having Mr. Bingley as a brother in law. Mr. Darcy, the other young gentleman, is quickly disliked by all of the Bennet family because of his disgustingly proud manner. What they don't know, is that under his pride, he is madly in love with Elizabeth. Elizabeth, after meeting Mr. Wickham (a young military officer), takes an even greater dislike of Darcy upon being informed by Wickham of Darcy financially depriving him (Wickham) of money that was rightfully his. Little does she know, that Wickham's account of this happening is not the same as Darcy's. Then the youngest Bennet, Kitty, performs a scandalous event bringing shame to the whole family. Will Jane and Elizabeth ever marry happily?  \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is beautifully filmed. From sweeping countryside scenes to busy London streets, itis all so real, and beautiful. Period costumes, make up, and equipment all bring the story to life in the English charm. The actors and actresses are also cast extremely well. They all fit the parts so perfectly, and truly make you believe that you are there with them. I still cannot believe that Jane and Elizabeth are truly not sisters, for their attachment and actions towards each other seemed to be filled with so much love and respect. Also, the light piano music sets the mood for a fun and enjoyable tale.  Even though the movie is just under six hours, I felt a yearning to know how the ending develops the rest of the character's lives. But since Jane Austen ended it at the same point, one's imagination, I suppose, is the tool for any curiosities at the end.  All in all, I would say that this is a most pleasing film, if not my favorite. The sweet storyline, charming English scenes and excellent acting would recommend itself to anybody able to be swept up in a movie for almost a good six hours. Out of four stars, I would give it four. I was moved by the luscious story, and will always recommend it as a fun and definitely worthwhile film.
B000001F9E|5.0|The received wisdom is that Thin Lizzy recorded two masterpieces -- this and LIVE AND DANGEROUS.  This was also the band's first commercially successful LP.  Three years earlier their epic rearrangement of the Irish drinking song 'Whiskey in the Jar' had  enjoyed chart success, but although the band had subsequently gathered a large following on the concert circuit, they didn't seem to be able to record a decent LP.  It looked to Phil Lynott like they could end up playing 'Whiskey' for the rest of their lives.<br />Bruce Springsteen had already captured the mood on the other side of the Atlantic -- what Lynott called the romantic street-fighting thing -- and Lizzy were writing about much the same subject.  For me, the stand-out tracks on this album were, and still are, the duelling guitar tracks at the end of each side of the LP -- 'Warriors' and 'Emerald' -- somewhat akin to what Allen Collins and Gary Rossington were achieving in Lynyrd Skynrd.  (Gary Moore, by the way, used to be Lizzy's second guitarist, but he got into too many knife-fights with Lynott and the other guitarist!)<br />The track that earns Lynott's family the most loyalties these days is the first single from the album, 'The Boys are Back in Town', used in the UK's 'Gladiators' TV show.  'Jailbreak' and 'Cowboy Song' are also great songs.<br />Whenever the Brits compile of the 1,000 best rock albums of all time, JAILBREAK is always in there.
0875847706|5.0|I have been going through a real soul transformation over the past few years and I have read a lot of self help books but the Art of Possibilities has absolutely sent me into fast forward. This is truly a facinating book. The authors captivated me from the first page and kept me to the end. Not only have all my self made boundaries been smashed but I now listen to classical music with a new sense of appreciation. In fact the book reminded me of listening to many of my favourites.  I can't thank the authors enough for what the two days of reading has done for me. I will never be the same. My possibilities are endless and I am extremely grateful for the insight.
B000007RYQ|5.0|Okay, I'll admit that this CD is not for everybody (you'll notice a stogy traditionalist in an earlier review who gave it 1 star - ignore her).  However, what Uri Caine has done with this CD is not only brilliant, but appropriate.  Mahler pushed musical boundaries in his time - I think he'd appreciate knowing that his music has been updated once more.  Expect surprises, keep and open mind (turntables and Mahler may seem odd at first), and you will (rightfully) worship this CD!

B000007491|3.0|Have you ever wondered why none of Supertramp's greatest hit compilation CDs ever includes a track from this album?  It's not the label, as Supertramp have stuck to A&amp;M throughout their career.  Have you ever wondered why this album has only ever been available in the US on import? Supertramp's debut album has never been released in the US -- not on CD, and not even on LP. There's a reason for that -- it's a really lacklustre album. And yet on Amazon it gets an average five-star rating.<br />Having disbanded after their first two albums flopped, Supertramp only came good with their third album CRIME OF THE CENTURY, which is a classic that deservedly earned them a very loyal fan base. This fan base was prepared to buy everything that the band subsequently produced, but was tentative about delving into the band's back-catalogue. These were the impecunious 70s and we were just schoolboys then.  A friend took the risk of going back one album: INDELIBLY STAMPED had a vaguely appealing pair of breasts on the cover, but the music provided convincing evidence that going back a further album would be a waste of our limited financial resources.<br />But this album has some merit. Track #4, 'Words Unspoken', sounds much like same-period Genesis, i.e. a bit like TRESPASS. 'Home Again' could have been a Cat Stevens number. The instrumental on 'Nothing to Show' pre-dates the final track on Manfred Mann's ROARING SILENCE by five years. Elsewhere the band sounds like Yes's TIME AND A WORD. There are shades of Traffic, and even Kingdom Come's now-deleted GALACTIC ZOO DOSSIER.  In short, they sound like just about every other white English 'progressive' band of the era. As one of the other reviewers here notes, it is only Davies' and Hodgson's distinctive voices that tell you that it's a Supertramp album.<br />The album disappeared without trace, and shortly afterwards, Hodgson and Davies replaced Palmer (guitar) and Miller (drums). By 1973, Supertramp had spent their time &quot;bombing up and down the M1 -- the main North-South motorway in the UK -- in a Transit van and playing Johnny B. Goode as an encore&quot; according to Rick Davies. Their label, A&amp;M, was losing faith after the first two albums nosedived.  Fortunately Hodgson and Davies persuaded them to let the band record just one more album, and the rest is history.<br />Hundreds of better albums than this were released in 1970.  This is for Supertramp addicts only.  It's an informative historical document showing how Hodgson and Davies kept the faith, yet changed their style to create something infinitely more distinctive.bombing up and down the M1 -- the main North-South motorway in the UK -- in a Transit van and playing Johnny B.

B000056VIY|5.0|Not only does Jennifer Lopez look extremely hot, but she sings incredibly hot. I was reading some of the previous reviews and they were saying that she is the Spanish Madonna. I do not agree with that statement. I think Lopez is very unique in her own way. She is a celebrity you can't compare anyone to because she can sing and act! &quot;Love Don't Cost A Thing&quot; is probably one of my top five songs right now. It has the coolest rhythm, beat, and sounds. Also if you are getting tired of &quot;Love Don't Cost A Thing,&quot; then my second favorite song is &quot;Ain't It Funny.&quot; That song is hecka cool! Also &quot;Play&quot; and &quot;Walking On Sunshine&quot; are fun also. JLO is DEFINITELY worth the money.
B000001IPL|5.0|This was the Offspring's breakthrough album that delivers some of their best work (and that's saying a lot).  Every song on this CD rocks and there is not one bad one among them.  Self Esteem, Come Out and Play, and Gotta Get Away were the big songs that sold the CD, and all three are excellent.  Bad Habit is road rage at its best.  What Happened to You? is a fun, upbeat song.  Nitro and Genocide deliver aggressive instrumentals.  Besides being good songs, Something to Believe In, It'll Be a Long Time, and Not the One also have deeper meanings in the lyrics, which has become a hallmark of the Offspring's music.  The bottom line is that this album is a necessary addition to the collection of any music fan.
B000002A3T|4.0|Pink Floyd has been called stoner music, but it is anything but. Many of their songs are very thoughtful, and deal with problems of the western world. One of the themes of &quot;The Division Bell&quot; is communication, or lack there of. &quot;Keep Talking&quot;, the best song on the album, deals with the inability to open up to people, the frustration of not being able to simply talk. &quot;Lost for Words&quot; is another song dealing with the same problem, but this time, not being able to solve relationships. Pull these themes in with the timeless sound of Pink Floyd and you have music that can be enjoyed for millions of years.
B00000ILDE|5.0|Scary. Thrilling. Original. Exciting. Intelligent. FUN. Not for weak stomachs or weak hearts. Very, very entertaining. The effects are still first-rate now, 15 years later. And the DVD provides bonus material that gives a real depth to the production.
B00004XONN|5.0|Three years ago, while browsing a now defunct music store, I was persuaded by friends to check out Radiohead's last album. Having resisted the guitar-drenched indulgences of most modern rock bands, I was dubious. But by the middle of the second song, I knew I would buy the album. It was precisely at the moment when the wild progressive guitar jangle and electronic combustion of the song 'Paranoid Android' gave over to a minor keyed lament of digitalised voices. I was teleported, not to a different world but right into the disparate anxieties and uncertain calm that exist under the surface of the present.<br />And that is to say, three years later, Radiohead has done it again. Kid A is a more restrained album that is so fiercely abstract it almost appears to be a masturbatory experiment by a band which has forgotten how to make music. Almost, and therein lies its genius.<br />Borrowing their album title from the name of a software that uses children voices to read out text files, Radiohead's songwriter Thom Yorke seems to be carrying on his personal journal on our search for happiness amidst the wired landscape of the new millennium. The most exquisite part of the execution is the potent irony and cynicism in the lyrics, though they are mostly incoherent and indiscernible. In this way Thom Yorke's fragile and synthesized voice can be found bleeping and droning among other digital pulses on the first song: &quot;Everything in its right place, Everything, Everything, Everything in its right place, There are two colours in my head, There are two colours in my head, What's it you're trying to say?&quot; The song seems to lull us into the perpetual unrest within the monstrous utopia that we humans have designed for our own habitation.<br />Employing gamelan in 'Kid A', a waterfall of freejazz horns in 'The National Anthem', a whale-like loop in 'How to Disappear Completely', catatonic industrial dance beats in 'Idioteque' and a cascade of harps in 'Motion Picture Soundtrack', it feels like Radiohead is trying to create the sensation of pure tranquility in the midst of a violently inhuman cacophony; the hidden track at the end of the album almost sounds like the peaceful dischord one might hear as one sits belted in on a plane plunging downward into inevitable devastation.<br />If you have heard the last two albums, The Bends and OK Computer, you would find that Radiohead's latest is another step in the same direction; meaning you may not understand or even like it at first, but with time, you will. Like the sleeve art, the songs in Kid A resist simplistic analysis. Take a plunge, and let the whole album engulf you in its disjointed layers of electronica, unexpected instrumentations, and the drowning voice of the only living android in the world.
B000021XR5|4.0|I bought this album about a week ago with much reservation...However, I really liked &quot;Sour Girl&quot; and knew that I wouldn't be able to get it out of my head unless I heard it about a million times. I bought the album, thinking that I probably wouldn't like it, but decided I would give it a chance. I immediately liked No Way Out, MC5, and Atlanta, then I became enamored of Sex and Violence, Glide, and I Got You. Now I'm really into Church on Tuesday. The first three songs of the album (Down, Heaven and Hot Rods, and Pruno) are ok and will most likely grow on me soon. That's the thing about this album- the first time I listened to it, I wasn't all that excited about it; I figured I had just wasted money on a cd that I would never listen to. But I was SOOOO wrong! This is a great album, even if you're not typically into this kind of music. (I have a broad range of musical styles that I like: The Carpenters, Lenny Kravitz, Fiona Apple, most musicals, and early Mariah Carey.) This album will catch you by surprise as to how much you'll like it, even if you thought that you wouldn't. Get this album!
B000051VQR|2.0|I bought this CD on the assumption that a lot of the songs would be like Minority, which is a great song.  I was surprised to learn that this CD is softer than its predecessors like dookie and insomniac (which I strongly recommend).  There are only a few songs on this CD that I found particularly good: Minority, Castaway, and Deadbeat Holiday.  Misery is also a good song, and it shows a different style from the others.  The rest of the CD is simply mediocre.  The new sound of Green Day just doesn't work as well as the heavier instrumentation in earlier songs.
B00003Q438|5.0|This is probably my favorite DVD. I'm a long time fan of the movie and this edition makes it even better with all the extra features. A must-have for any s.f. buff.
B00005176F|5.0|I have been a fan, since they came out with the single, &quot;There's No Other Way&quot;. The band has finally come out with not just a very good and worth it album, but also affordable for the masses; unlike their costly Live at the Budokan, or also the Limited Ten Year Anniversary Box Set, which there were only 7000 ever made, that thank goodness, I have. But I am not here today to discuss the historical albums Blur has produced, but to tell you about this so called, BEST OF...<br />There is this new single song, Music is My Radar, I am glad it's almost sounding like the music of the band's early beginnings. I miss those days. The rest of the album contents are classics. The beautiful, &quot;The Universal&quot; is included in the package. Then there is the song that was supposedly written about the break up of Damon Albarn and Elastica's Justine Frischmann, &quot;No Distance Left to Run&quot;, which is by far the most touching song Damon has ever sung. There should have been more songs from their sophomore album, Modern Life is Rubbish that were included, like Sunday Sunday.<br />But guys, as with every other musicians in the world who are coming up with a Best of....you might as well get this one from Blur...as only musicians who have changed the world forever I think has the right and honor to have a &quot;Best of&quot; album. It won't fail you!
1586210912|5.0|This book is so inspirational.  I absolutly loved it.  I would recommened this book to anyone with ideas of self-improvement.  The format of this book is great for all types of readers.  I am very anxious to read the next book.

B000003S28|5.0|This was a second Eno album I bought and over the years it has become one of my favorites.  It's a soundtrack to sentiments of wonder, bliss, melancholy and obliqueness.  Although the sequencing of the tracks on the album is something to get used to, once it's under you skin it makes perfect sense.  Not Ambient really, I think the tracks are etudes; exercises in harmony, timbre, and in this light Eno is the Great Fisherman who reels you in via intuition.  Classical, low key, playful and sad.  Thank you, Brian.
1570429596|4.0|I first started out reading the book, but I got frustrated because the author did not get to the points fast enough.  Not wanting to waste my time, I rented the audio version of this book.  What a relief.  I enjoyed much more listening to Rich Dad, Poor Dad than reading it.  The book is really a story that can be listened to during your commute.  At this point, I will use the book as a reference book for review.
B00004STDN|4.0|This DVD version of Cliffhanger is excellent! It has a great Dolby 5.1 Track that is certain to please! The film itself it a great all-around action movie. I definately recommend picking it up.
0767827716|5.0|Don't cross this Fury, or it'll be the last thing you do. Good story (of course, it's King), and riveting drama.
0553565915|5.0|This is a Must Read! I loved this book and have given copies and recommended it at every opportunity. It is a quick, easy read and believing that when I die I will be in heaven with Christ, I still held on to fear.  Not any longer however.  I have an incredible peace about my life and about my death.  This book has 'cemented' my relationship with God and given me the ability to look at the bigger picture and be more loving and more forgiving. I followed up this book with the authors next 2 books and read them in order of publication.
6304383827|5.0|My favorite movie of all time. I really love it. Gwyneth Paltrow is briliant.
B000002O4S|5.0|When I was 6, I saw Back to the Future for the first time.   After that, I came to love special effects and film itself.  Soon after, my parents bought a CD player (when they were brand new), and one of the first titles they purchased was this one.  The first major track you hear is &quot;Power of Love,&quot; by Huey Lewis and the News.  The track was a billboard charter at the time of the film, and it's rhythm and beat are still catchy.  Along with this song are &quot;Time Bomb Town,&quot; &quot;Heaven is one step away,&quot; and &quot;Back in Time.&quot;  But what really energized me was the &quot;Back to the Future Overture,&quot; capturing the Alan Silvestri theme that is probably as well known as the Star Wars and Indiana Jones themes.  The final 5-6 tracks contain music from the 50's, as well as a short but sweet audio of Johnny B. Goode.  I rrecommend this CD, as well as Footloose, for that great mid-80's feel.  You just can't get good movie soundtracks like this anymore.
0440219078|5.0|When I was a teenager, I wonder why I can feel the world I'm not sure it's really exist.  We have the power of imagination which makes me feel something we can't really see, hear, touch, and somebody-we-care-for's feeling.<br /> It's sometimes painful to feel something.  It makes us to love somebody and love, whether it's successful or failing one, brings us heartpain.  If we want to avoid such heartpain, we must avoid love and feeling.  But if we would do so, the world would turn into a colorless one and music would be lost.<br /> This story tells us what would happen if we avoid love and feeling and try hard to abolish all these memory connected to love and feeling.  <br /> Just imagine, there's no memory of love and feeling.  You have the power.   And look around the world you exist in.  It will look beautiful to you.
B000002JEV|5.0|This collection is an essential addition to anyone's cd library.  About 15 years ago or so I heard the last four tracks on disc 1 (Communication Breakdown, I Can't Quit You Baby, You Shook Me, and How Many More Times) on a vinyl LP (yes - that would be plastic!) entitled The New Yardbirds - Live (Oops! that would be a bootleg and illegal!).  It's nice to hear the rest of the sessions from that era<br />The entire set is raw and energetic, most arrangements are very similar to the original recordings.  The anti-&quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; crowd who complained about &quot;The Song Remains The Same&quot; version will note that the BBC Sessions version (disc 2)is about 10 minutes shorter - The guys decided not to go to San Francisco.<br />The bottom line for this set is to buy it, it's some mean, hard-rockin', throw-down blues!
0743204018|5.0|Both &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; and &quot;Tis&quot; are marvelous works, and both are also told by one of the amazing storytellers of our time. McCourt has the abitlity to make the miserable almost seem magical. His open account of his early life in these two volumes serves to inspire, and also, certainly, to entertain.
078322737X|5.0|I'm not sure what it is, but alot of films that deal with the past and nostalgia (Back to the Future, Forrest Gump) have held a fascination with me.  Just the differences, no information age, cars that looked cooler, and the styles and music weren't as grained down and commercialistic as today.  American Graffiti was a film I had heard about quite a bit (being a Star Wars fan), and it was last fall during the early morning hours that I sat down and watched it.  Well, the people who love it are not kidding: it really is a great film!<br />     Taking place in Modesto, CA (a nod to George Lucas's hometown), we begin at sunset (redone for the special edition, the once overcast sky is now ablaze in orange and blue) at Mel's Diner.  Here, we meet Terry, Steve, Curt, and Curt's sister  Laurie.  Tonight is the last night before graduation, and some of them are wondering what the future holds for them.  As the sun sets, Steve and Laurie begin to question their future together (Steve wants to go to the East Coast for college, and Laurie is unsure of their relationship), Terry is loaned Steve's car, and picks up a cute blond (he manages to convince her that the car is his, and that he is of legal age to buy alcohol!), and Curt spends the entire night, tracking down a girl in a white Ford T-Bird(one of the most intriguing plots of the movie!), as well as getting into some fun trouble with a gang of teen punks.  The plot also includes John, almost the image of the teenage rebel, who cruises down main street in his bright yellow hot rod (with his THX1138 license plate), and Carol, the only girl out of a carload next to him that wants to ride with him.  However, John did not know that she was 13!  But, the play off of John's toughman compared to Carol's &quot;I know everything, I'm 13!&quot; attitude is great dialogue.  In a slightly cameo role, Harrison Ford plays cowboy hat-wearing Bob Falfa, driving a 56 Chevy, cruising for a drag race with John.      Lucas does an incrediblejob piecing these teenager's stories together, with everything taking place from the dusk of one day to the dawn of the next.  As you watch, you almost wish the night would never end.  The town seems so small and almost intimate, it's an entitiy in itself, from the downtown crusing streets, all the way out to Mel's Diner.  Right now, there are some parts that words just can't describe what I mean about the film.<br />  But, I can't say enough about the soundtrack.  I hadn't enjoiyed a timeline soundtrack since the 2-CD set of Forrest Gump.  All the music is great, not a bad song in the bunch.  The music fits in the entire film's continuity, being croadcast by The Wolfman, a radio entity that almost everyone has an interpretation of who he is (but only one of our teens finds out, but I'm not going to say which one).      The film was Lucas's first major hit, and it almost did not get made.  If you can believe it, Lucas worked like a dog on this film on the tightest of schedules and budgets (the same  type of mood on Star Wars almost led him to a total breakdown).  But, out of the complexity of his work came this hit.  Almost none of the studio executives had confidence in it, except for Lucas, his friends, and Francis Ford Coppola (a man who is credited for helping Lucas in his early days).      DVD is the best way to experience this film.  In terms of teen movies, I'd choose this hands down over the 90's films being released today.  Instead of a picture cranked out by studio execs leaning to make a buck, Lucas made Graffiti with his past and nostalgia in mind.  It truly deserves to be seen and heard.
B00000J6AG|5.0|I had heard of Moby through my intrest in electronica and electronic music in general. I had been exposed to his music hear and there (more recently due to his foray into music scores/soundtracks), but for some reason something always held me back from really exposing myself to his music and buying an album. Then a while back I picked up my first Moby album &quot;I Like to Score&quot; because it was basicly a collection of all the music I had had of his through his scoring/soundtrack endeavours. It's a decent album but didn't thrill me due to the fact that most of the music on it I already had or heard.<br />When &quot;Play&quot; came out it sat on the shelf for a long time before I picked it up. Everytime I went to the record store I would look at it but never get it. I'd read reviews (Rollingstone Magazine made this album out to be one of the best albums ever made; I scoffed), and eventually it was those reviews that finally prompted me to pick up the album.<br />When I first played it, I wondered if I had made a mistake as the first few tracks played; they just didn't hit me right. Good thing I have this philosophy of letting an album play a few times before formulating an opinion, because the best albums generally take time to grow on you. And that is exactly what this album is; one of the best albums I have ever heard. It's wonderfully varied in style yet always remaining pure Moby. This album's pretty near impossible to classify as fits into several different genres and yet seems to create it's own at the same time.<br />This album belongs into any true music lover's collection.<br />Note: There is a Double CD version out there with a full disks worth of bonus tracks if you can find it. I was a little annoyed that it came out after I bought the single version (which took me a while in the first place) so I figured I should mention that before you buy the single version.
B000000W9Z|5.0|Bowie's fans are the most devoted in music, but you don't have to be partial to appreciate this masterpiece.  Unlike embarrassing 1960s \\"concept albums,\\" 1. Outside contains an open-ended story and a strange world (partly derived, I think, from Bowie's beloved 1984 by Orwell).  To go with this, the atmospheric, thickly-textured songs have a depth and relevance almost never found in pop music.  \\"It's all deranged - there's no control\\" speaks to the world of 1. Outside and our own increasingly oppressive reality.  To add to this, songs like \\"I Have Not Been to Oxford Town\\" and \\"I'm Deranged\\" have an AOR-friendly lyricism that will bring you back to the album time and again.  I have seen web sites completely devoted to 1. Outside.  Here's hoping DB continues the trilogy as promised....
0684864835|5.0|In the highly acclaimed &quot;Angela's Ashes,&quot; Frank McCourt tells the story of his heartbreaking childhood and how he struggled to survive and dig himself out from under his circumstances. If you have not read this or &quot;'Tis,&quot; I recommend that you do so immediately.
0786915749|5.0|The minute I started to read this book, the action took me in! Within the first 25 pages there was a battle. This book is action-packed, humerous, and serious in some parts. It has the basic good vs evil plot to it, however, Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman were able to draw it out into a wonderful series of books. I highly recommend this book to ANYONE who likes the fantasy genre. If you love this book (which I find it hard to believe if you don't), then you'll love Dragons of Winter Night (book 2), Dragons of Spring Dawning (book 3), and possibly even Dragons of Summer Flame (book 4). READ THIS BOOK!
078322740X|3.0|Housesitter is an awful rewrite of the charming 1941 movie It Started with Eve. Unlike Deanna Durbin's character, who is honest and likeable, Goldie Hawn plays a pathological liar no decent person could respect. In fact, the whole plot of the original has been so cheapened that it's hard to accept any of the relationships between characters, or the final outcome. The two movies share a cast of characters in similar roles, and even humorous scenes like tripping over a living-room chair, but the wholesome quality of the original is totally lost in Housesitter. The film's only saving grace is the superb acting of its well-picked cast. The story line, though, has been shamefully distorted. I would expect a remake to improve on the original, but comparing these two films saddens me to think how far American screenwriting has deteriorated in the past 50 years.
B00000JMQC|5.0|One of the best films of all time, Disney's sequel to THE WIZARD OF OZ is a scary, deliciously malevolent story of a huge scale.<br />Fairuza Balk, in her film debut, plays Dorothy, who is still troubled from her last trip to Oz, losing sleep and driving Aunt Em (Piper Laurie) and Uncle Henry (Matt Clark) to distraction.<br />A sadistic doctor, Worley (Nicol Williamson), and a ghostly assistant (Jean Marsh), say they will &quot;cure&quot; the girl with a machine.  They really are going to use electro-shock therapy on her.  At the last minute she is saved by a mysterious girl, falls into a swollen river and wakes up back in Oz.  But Oz has mysteriously changed.  The Yellow Brick Road has been ripped up, Emerald City has lost its lustre, and all inhabitants have been turned to stone.<br />Dorothy finds that Oz is now ruled by the evil Nome King (Nicol Williamson) and the head-hunting Princess Mombi (Jean Marsh).  Will she survive her return to Oz?<br />David Shire's music is wonderful, performed by the London Symphony Orchestra.  Although RETURN TO OZ is a Disney film, it's not recommended for young children.<br />A modern classic.
6300214826|5.0|Ok...almost everyone agrees the first 2 hours of this movie are amazing.  It is not a war movie, it is a movie about a journey (both physical and symbolic) in which one man finds that man's true existence is the heart of darkness.  As for the ending...it is certainly unconventional.  But it is extremely successful,  from the books on Kurtz's table (two precursors to Eliot's &quot;The Waste Land&quot;) to the omnipresent orange light (hell??).  If you got nothing out of the ending, perhaps you should read Heart of Darkness.  If you're still unimpressed, read Nietzsche's &quot;Beyond Good and Evil,&quot; for Kurtz is the argument against the Nietzschian superman.  A powerful story, in both movie and novella form.
0694006300|5.0|I remember reading this book as a child, and at 20 years old, I still find this book as amusing and fun as I did when I was 8. My favorite thing about this book is its fantastic illustrations. The illustrations truly &quot;bring the book to life&quot;. Any child reading this story will be captivated by the image of the adorable mouse and his escapades! I feel that children can relate well to this story; not only does it illustrate how they can find new friends in unlikely places, but children can also relate to the little boy's hairy predicament - making a mess! This tale makes children use there imagination, and is perfect for any child who loves a good adventure and loveable characters. In addition, the story line is exciting and enjoyable for readers of any age....afterall, if you give a child this book, they might just want another!
B000002J1O|4.0|As the ... review reveals, this CD was 'overlooked' by the 'Lamb' for sure.  This CD is the ultimate 'transformation' CD between Genesis's 'underground sound' and 'broad appeal'.  To me, this classic clearly bridged the early Genesis 'sound' to something that the general public could digest (and I mean that in a non-selling-out way), and the result ended up being 1 track that was the first Genesis song to enter the top 40 (Wardrobe).<br />Overall, this is a Genesis classic that I am sure most true Genesis fans like me already have - my message here is that this is one Genesis CD that you should listen to, buy and appreciate, as post-Gabriel Genesis was great too, but just not as clever and compelling as SEBTP....<br />To expand on that, folks that hope to get something like 'Invisible Touch' here should stray away...this is early Genesis, and by comparison this masterpiece just might satisfy some fans like me who simply want more great prog-rock in the wake of an era where songs that exceed 4 minutes are considered 'wank-fests' or 'over-self-indulgent-crap'... So, if you can handle some long, great compositions by the masters of art/prog/rock, get this CD like NOW!!!<br />Cheers from a 42 yr old who still loves ALL of Genesis....
6301942647|5.0|This Film is one of Mr. Kurosawas best. Yeah, I know i watched almost all his films and liked some, wouldn't see others, but this one is like watching moving art. The sequences are supposed dreams of the master himself,and are brought to beautiful life by those guys at Industrial Light &amp; Magic. My favorite one has to be the &quot;Peach Orchard&quot; or the &quot;Wedding of the Foxes&quot; wich is also known as &quot;Sunlight Through Rain&quot;. Personally I would never see this movie dubbed. Finally, this movie is very inspirational to anyone who is artistic and reasonably a conscious human being.

6302859204|4.0|The Travis Walton story is one of the more interesting, and maybe believable, of the alien abduction stories. I remember when the story came out in the seventies it sure got a lot of coverage in Arizona. I've hiked the White Mountains area, and it sure is beautiful, but I never ran into any aliens-- knock wood. At least not from outer space. This movie treats the story straight-faced and it kind of drags in places. Better pacing was needed. As a film, it really did not generate the spooky paranoia of say, Communion. It's worth a watch, though. Travis Walton himself has his own webpage for the curious.

B00004T9UF|5.0|In my personal opinion this album is absoutely amazing,there is no other word that could describe it. And I exaggerate not, with it's edgy phrases and limit pushing language it deffentaly gives you a wild ride. Of course with it being under so much contraversay it just makes me want to listen to it more because i think that it is very rare that you find a CD by an artist that will push the limits and tell you what he really thinks, no matter what others may perceive his lyirics as this album is definately akeeper.

Es el disco en que Mingus plasma con singular belleza los &quot;desplazamientos&quot; y &quot;condensaciones&quot; de su entera humanidad.

B000002U84|5.0|All of the songs are great. Simon LeBon's voice is irresistible, well, hold on...I'll go through all the songs... &quot;Rio&quot; is as great as the video is, with a sexy tinge. &quot;My Own Way&quot; is fast and upbeat, leading to &quot;Lonely in Your Nightmare&quot;, which sounds, at first, mind you, like the Cure, but as the whole song begins, reminds me of the Beatles. Next, comes the classic &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot;, and who can forget the teasing laugh in the beginning, and then to have the great guitar intro? &quot;Hold Back the Rain&quot; sounds like HLTW, but with a different beat and tone. &quot;New Religion&quot; is an interesting song, with a subtitle above in the booklet of &quot;A dialogue between the ego and alter-ego&quot;, which means that while Simon's lead singing in going on, he's also singing other stuff during the time and between. My other personal favorite on this album is &quot;Last Chance on the Stairway&quot;, which is romantic, with Simon's vocals, and the words give me a dreamy sigh, with such lyrics as &quot;'Cause when all the curtains are pulled back, we'll turn and see the circles we traced,&quot; or &quot;...baby dance with me.&quot; Also, &quot;Save a Prayer&quot;, which is another romantic song, despite the insinuations of one-night stands. Last but not least, is &quot;The Chauffeur&quot;, about a quick romance, which sounds more classical, but gradually gets a more traditional beat. All together, an excellent and must-get CD!
B0000507QH|3.0|The plotine is basically about a philosophy professor,an unsympathethic womaniser who has the desire to do something with his life. He meets a young woman, who was a model for a painter, who died while they were having sex, he doesn't get along well with her yet he has this physical connection to her. His obsession with her and her inability to respond to him make him resort to violence, he wants to break up with her and yet he cannot. Can a person love and despise another at the same time? This film explores that premise and utilises a lot of gratuitous sex and nudity ... Overall, it was a thought provoking film and I would only recommend it to any fan of French Cinema.
0767849493|3.0|Let me start by saying that I think Kevin Smith is perhaps the single most over-rated director of my generation, so anyone drooling for another review from a Smith-adoring sycophant should stop reading now.  I got so annoyed with &quot;Clerks&quot; that I walked out before the end, and when I did stay for the end of &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; I wished I hadn't, it was so beyond contrived.  &quot;Dogma&quot; was the first of Smith's films that I actually liked, but some of the worshipful reviews I've read of it on this site are just plain disturbing.<br />Smith likes to try to shock us, usually with what another comment on this site referred to as &quot;d**k and f*rt jokes.&quot;  The effective moments of &quot;Dogma&quot; saw the characters thinking within the logic of Catholicism as presented by the movie and producing problems and jokes from within that space (for example, Jay's response after Rufus has painstakingly elaborated Fiorentino's divine heritage: &quot;So, she's black?&quot; That was a perfect one that registered the biggest laugh of the night with the audience I was in).  The far more prevalent moments were simple applications of the tired &quot;d**k and f*rt jokes&quot; to new targets, be it the Church, organized religion in general, etc.  When the film first does this, it rightly offsets the seriousness and grandeur of the religious, but when the film does this for TWO HOURS STRAIGHT, I get a little bored, a little annoyed that Smith doesn't seem to know when he's made his point.  So he just keeps on making it, and keeps on making it.  And I quit finding it funny.<br />Fiorentino was woefully misused, cracking sarcasms when she should be full of curiosity, fear and trembling, rendering her otherwise beautiful moment of self-doubt utterly unbelievable and unmotivated (and almost, well, hokey), but the Wonder Bread Boys Damon and Affleck are actually really good, as is Rickman.<br />One final word to those who see in &quot;Dogma&quot; a critique of organized religion: Let's not forget that this supposed critique is a film whose very premise (articulated by Loki and Bartleby themselves, at the movie's outset in the airport) is that the Catholic Church speaks for God.  Can you critique as outmoded and fallen an institution whose very status as divine authority is required by the plot structure of your critique? I don't think it works.<br />Let's see &quot;Dogma&quot; for what it is, a pretty good comedy.  But let's not fall into the sandtrap of calling a movie deep just because it talks its way around religion.  Other films have engaged religion far more credibly, and those are the behinds we should be kissing.
0440219078|4.0|I think this was a wonderful book.  It takes all of your 5 senses and restricts them to a black and white cutout of the perfect world.  Then it takes that cutout and breaches it through the mind of Jonas and the Giver, making the discovery of color, smell, hearing, etc., as wonderful as it was the first time you learned it.  As Jonas learns everything for the first time, so do you, and you don't know what will happen next.  This book will take you on an everlasting thrill ride as you look into a world that has never been but could be, and how a world without freedom would look.  So, open your mind, and open this book! :-)
B00000JPYQ|5.0|this band is probably the most unknown, great hard rock band of the 70's and 80's with phil mogg and michael schenker you have two of the greatest in their roles of singer and guitarist....smart lyrics...great melodies and riffs.....any cd is fine...but the live cd puts them in the forefront of great live cds and band of the 70's this is a very very cool record
B00004ZD69|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST RECORD THAT I HEARD IN MY LIFE. GODSPEED MUSIC IS VERY GOOD AND EMOTIONAL! IF YOU CANNOT LIKE THIS BAND, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IS REAL ART!
B00003CXHJ|2.0|My first major complaint with this film is that when I went to see it in the theatres, the movie studio made the house turn the sound ALL THE WAY UP for added realism. No what this meant for everyone? Louder sound than a heavy metal concert. There were people literally running out of the auditorium during the film because it was so loud. I am totally serious! I don't know if every screening across the country was like this, but I had a hearing problem for the next several hours. I am 20 years old, and love loud music/movies, and even I found this to be absurd.<br />And beside all the historical facts that are twisted and removed just to make this film seem believable, it was not that well acted either. I think the producers were trying to make a sub flick that compared to earlier classics, such as &quot;Run Silent Run Deep&quot; that they told the actors to ham it up a bit, trying to equal the star power of that classic. But with lightweights such as Matthew McConaughey and Bill Paxton leading the troops, expect some major stretches in talent here. <br />The plot, about a Navy submarine crew that attempts to board a German U-boat for intellegence purposes, ends up stuck on it after their own sub gets sunk. The next 10 hours(at least it felt like 10 hours when watching it) involves the McConaughey trying to lead his crew back to shore, but they become chased by the Germans, and you get the SAME SCENE OVER AND OVER AGAIN. It is always about holding the sub together after a &quot;near miss&quot; depth charge and evading the entire German Fleet. <br />I recommend that you do not see this movie, it is not even worth the rental price. The sound quality, when it isn't turned all the way up, is impressive, but that is the only bright spot.
B00000JXZ7|5.0|This is a disc of classic recordings. The Bruch works are played with dazzling virtuosity and hot fire that is the Chung trademark. But there is poetry and inner emotion as well. The Scottish fantasia I love especially in this CD, as it really sounds like a fantasy. Chung plays with great imagination and adds meaning to the notes (while many other performers can play with passion, the structure of the piece goes nowhere). This is something Chung can do magnificently. Any piece she tackles has meaning and structure. Even in the Berg concerto, a work I found confusing before I heard Chung's performance, she was able to grasp the intention of the piece fully, so I was able to hear what she was saying and what Berg was saying in the work. The concerto is played with no less energy and fire, although it can sound a little tired on repeated listenings. But the rapport between soloist, orchestra and conductor is really something. They play the pieces like chamber music: they talk to each other and respond back. Kempe is a conductor I have always admired, and here he exceeds my expectations. The balance of the interpretation is just right, although sound-wise the violin is a little too forward. But that is no reason to not enjoy this recording. But I suggest her later recording with Klaus Tennstedt on EMI for the concerto.  The Mendelssohn is the real gem in this CD. For once this overplayed work sounds fresh. This was recorded 8 years after the Bruch in Montreal, with the Montreal Symphony under Dutoit. The acoustics are more generous and forgiving thatn on the Bruch works, but again the violin is too forwardly placed. This was especially apparent in the original CD issue of the work, coupled with the Tchaikovsky (her second version. The first was with the London SO under Previn), but thankfully the remastering has reduced the forwardness of the soloist, although not enough to say that the balance is perfect. The performance is completely void of sentimentality, just pure(in the fullest sense of the word) emotion. Chung appraoches the work with just the right amount of lightness that is required in Mendelssohn. Her phrasings are simply fun. She really sounds as if she is having fun with the music, especially in the delightful finale. That sense of fun is transmitted onto the recording and to the listener ultimately. As the Kellogg ad for the cereal &quot;Just Rught&quot; says: It's Just Right. The CD is at mid price which makes this a bargain.
B00001NFCY|5.0|I hold nothing but the upmost respect for Creed, for they have burst themselves onto the mainstream with great sounding music, clean lyrics, and a fun atomosphere. I recommend this CD to anyone who likes Pop/Rock. Higher and Arms Wide Open are two very good songs on here, and many more deserve equal air time on the radio. This band knows how to make music! I play their music constantly, and they deserve all the credit that has been given to them. Very rarely do you have a talented group making a CD with ALL the tracks on them decent! This is one disc worth every single penny. You will not be dissapointed!
B000001U3K|5.0|There's a very good reason why this album isn't played on the radio.  Despite a generation of, if you listen to certain &quot;conservatives&quot;, loosing morals (sure, there's been some, but not much), or if you listen to certain &quot;liberals&quot;, social progress (sure, there's been some, but not as much of it is as 'progressive' as some prefer to think)...this album is STILL too edgy for radio.<br />If &quot;Walk On the Wild Side&quot; were released today, GLAAD would put Lou Reed up with Eminem, and John McCain would revile them both. If anything does, this record proves times don't change.<br />Oh, by the way, musically it's great stuff and it's a blast to slip some songs onto mix tapes.  There's nothing quite like somebody getting into &quot;Walk On The Wild Side&quot; or &quot;Perfect Day&quot; and then it hits them what the song's really about!  Definitely should be a part of your collection.
B000002AS3|5.0|this. is. a. great. album. astounding, when you realise that this is their debut effort. this is one rocking album and i can't say there's anything that i don't like in it. songs like 'live forever', 'supersonic' and 'cigarette and alcohol' are just about the perfect songs to drive to... they are full of chords and stuff, and i personally find that oasis music are the most beautiful of the brit bands. i also fancy 'married with children', a slow track and sounds like their later songs 'cast no shadow', wonderwall' etc. unfortunate that this album are generally overlooked and overshadowed by their 2nd release (what's the story) morning glory and that's a shame. there are surprisingly a lot of strong tracks here, including the above mentioned, as well as 'supersonic', 'shakermaker', and 'columbia'. the other tracks also complement the general feeling of rock'n'roll'-ness of the album. an excellent debut and to miss this would be a great shame indeed.
0671799320|4.0|...'Hydrocarbon Man' rocks on. 'Rock Oil' and the 'Age of Oil' are two descriptive phrases that Yergin uses to 'bookend' his epic story - 'The Prize'. He starts with a vignette about how rock oil - a black, sticky substance found in the backwoods of northwest Pennsylvania and used as a folk medicine came to be made into an illuminant (kerosene); one which quickly supplanted whale oil, camphene and 'town gas' (a distillate of coal) as the preferred means of lighting one's home. Yergin concludes with the prospects for the future of us -'hydrocarbon man' as we continue with our dependancy on oil.<br />From the opening pages it is clear that Yergin is an authority on the subject. We have not travelled more than 10 years along the 150 year history of oil and yet we have already learnt it's origins, it's ancient and alternate uses, the products it was competing with, and we have met some of the early inventors, entrepreneur's and explorers. <br />There are three themes that Yergin develops throughout the book. Firstly, the story of oil is the story of capitalism and modern business. The province of Fortune 500 companies, multinationals and the underpinning of wealth in the industrialized west. Certainly, from as early as the late 19th Century, with the emergence of Standard Oil as the first multinational company (a subject Yergin devotes a fair amount of time to),- it's hard to refute this claim. Yergin does recognize that the late 20th Century was less oil lubricated and more computer chip driven, and it's obvious to all of us that this trend will only intensify in this century. Indeed from the time the first edition of 'The Prize' was published (just before the Gulf War) and even since this edition came out in 1993 -things have changed quite a bit economically. In 1990, seven of the top 20 Fortune 500 Companies were in the oil industry. Today you have to extend the search further, and even then only come up with Exxon-Mobil, Enron, Chevron and Texaco.<br />The second theme he highlights is the role oil had in strategic global geoplolitical decicions and disasters. He lays at the feet of 'oil politics' the Japanese decision to bomb Pearl Harbour and Germany's invasion of Russia. Typically in a classic example of the irony that history is famous for, the eventual defeat of these two empires was also due to oil (actually the lack of it). There are of course other more recent strategic oil wars - what was the Gulf War and the unprecedented United Nations stand against Iraq if not a defense of the 'blood supply' for industrialized nations? This revised edition of the book makes it quite clear that Iraq if successful in it's swallowing of Kuwait, would have been the most powerful nation in The Persian Gulf.<br />The third theme is more sociological and forces us to deal with questions not of history but of our future. Yergin states that we have become a 'Hydrocarbon Society' and thus we are 'Hydrocarbon Man'. What characterizes us as this new species? Basically that our cities, politics, economics, values - in fact almost all things material and of importance to us are lubricated with a concern about oil. This used to be seen as a universal good - but no more, There are some of us, Mr Yergin says, including himself, that are concerned about this dependency - It's impact on our behavior, our health and our environment and our ability to sustain our way of life.<br />I agree with other reviewers in that more could have been said on some issues such as alternative energy sources, the economic and environmental arguments for and against our continued reliance on oil and the spin off activities and other associated industries such as plastics and chemicals. But, in fairness to Mr Yergin, there is so much that you can and should say, especially when you find that it is taking you over 800 pages to say it. For me, as a history book on the oil industry, it's certainly long enough but more importantly - good enough.
B000002BBY|5.0|the truth is that i had this cd first, then only 'definitely maybe'. but it is a great sophomore effort fer oasis. i know that they are infamous fer their behaviour than anything else, but it doesn't make this album any less wonderful. the thing is if noel and liam could only stop making a fool of themselves, then maybe they could actually make a reality of their boast that they'll be the greatest band there is. really, this album had showed the public what the gallaghers are capable of. my favourite tracks has to be 'don't look back in anger', a track that even one of my anti-oasis friend admits that it's a bloody excellent; 'wonderwall', another great track and 'champagne supernova', a personal favourite. other singles like 'roll with it' and 'some might say' are also strong tracks that makes this album really enjoyable. what i love about their song are the fact that the lyrics are really, really superb (thanks to that genius noel) and liam's rockstar demeanor and voice certainly suit the lyrics and haunting melodies of their creations. the fact that noel's a dyslexic doesn't hamper him from producing his best materials here. oh yes, the other tracks in this album are good too, especially 'she's electric', which is weird, too put it mildly...i don't care if there are people who laugh at the oasis' obvious fascination with the beatles, and i feel it is fitting if they would love to emulate their idols. i mean, it's a great ambition and good fer them that they are trying to achieve it. overall, this is an essential cd to have, and i think the most accessible of all what britpop has to offer.
0452282152|4.0|I truly enjoyed this book.  The story is not what I expected at all.  The view from maid Griet's station in life brings out colors, drama and a rich sensuality I did not expect.  Living and learning from a master is a rare priveledge.  The story is simple /dramatic and exciting.  I couldn't put it down.  I so loved Griet's awakening to color and all the revelations that come with that...learning how to see. <br />There are some very interesting characters.  The book is meticulous and well researched.  But you don't feel that while reading because the author is a truly wonderful story teller.<br />Enjoy!

B00004WIBW|4.0|I'm not much into horror, and I only watched SLEEPY HOLLOW because my sister made me. To my surprise, I found myself enjoying the film. It was a bit gory and I did hide my eyes in a few parts, but it shouldn't bother most people too much, except for those who hate blood, like me. The story itself was fascinating - so fill of twists and turns that it had me guessing pretty much the whole way. I'm not a big fan of Christina Ricci's acting, but she did an impressive job, as did actors Christopher Lee, Miranda Richardson, and Ian McDiarmind. The characters were beautifully portrayed, and even though some had relatively little screen time, they certainly made an impression on me. All in all, the film was well-crafted and presented - a great story for anyone who enjoys a little suspense.
B0000004V2|5.0|I first listened to this album when it came out, in 1989. 12 years later, it has withstood the test of time -- I still listen to it, I still count it among one of my favorites, I still fervently recommend it. Words don't do it justice -- magnificent, epic, monumental, transforming...just plain perfect. I hope...no, I expect that, 12 years from now, I will still be listening to this, and introducing my kids to the band that never quite got off the ground.
B00004Z400|5.0|First off, I'd like to say that this is the first Deftones album I bought. I haven't got any of their other stuff, so I can't make comparisons. In a way, this is a good thing, because my opinion can't be influenced on what the other albums sound like, like so many people I see on this page who whinge on about &quot;this doesn't sound like the Deftones at all, cos it doesn't make me want to mosh!&quot;.  To that I say, bull. Deftones change and evolve, like any other band, and surely this is evident by the many styles on the album, if anything! Anyway,here's my song by song review:<br />1:Back To School (Mini-Maggit)- Very aggresive and (gasp!) tuneful track. Chico really pumps out everything he's got into this one - rapping and singing surprisingly go together well. But the best part? The excellent sing-along chorus. Great single material. PS: Listen to Pink Maggit afterwards, and note the contrast. 9/10<br />2: Feiticeira - Hard track to review, since it does sound brilliant, but there's nothing really to distinguish it from most of the other tracks. That said, the group do exert themselves in this song about kidnapping - and it is the Deftones, so it won't be bad easily. Catchy chords and intro, but just somewhat average. 8/10<br />3:Digital Bath - Another good single, with the first notable change of pace for the band, as they start to add some ambient touches throughout the song. Some quiet touches from DJ Frank Delgado enhance this song a good deal. The strong riffs seem to complement this clever, but not startling, change into alternative, Incubus-style rock. Good work. 8.5/10<br />4:Elite - ...which is all blown away in this screamer of a track. If the Deftones are spreading out to their soft side, this track makes it evident that they're also spreading out to their Slipknot-esque side too! Chico completely loses it during the course of this song, and the stunning guitars and drumbeats'll blow the moshers in you into the next dimension. If you're playing a shoot-em-up game on the Internet, this track makes the perfect soundtrack. This track won the Deftones &quot;Best Metal Performance&quot; at this year's Grammies, and rightly so. Not only artistically brilliant, but an excellent mosh song too! 9.5/10<br />5: RX Queen - Just to make sure that everything's in balance, this quiet relaxing song will certainly calm you down from the previous track (or maybe not). Another ambient-rock style song works it's way into the track listing, and it's one of my favourites. It has some great words (that most of you will probably find unintelligible!), and a sweet little chorus. Guaranteed to make you feel sleepy. 9/10<br />6: Street Carp - A good off-beat intro to the shortest song on the album. At the beginning, I expected this track to be one of the best, but halfway through loses it a little. Also the only track on this album with any swearing in, but most of you won't be interested in that. 8/10<br />7: Teenager - The quietest, most relaxing track on the entire album. A great little track, with the whole band displaying a somewhat scary sleepy side to them! Good words, great music, 9.5/10.<br />8: Knife Prty - Another single, and it's good to mosh too as well, though not as heavy as Elite, or Korea. The thing that distinguishes this track is that there's a female voice singing an amazing little tune in the middle of this, and Chico complements this perfectly. Heavy guitars hit home the message once more - Deftones rock. 9/10<br />9: Korea - Oh man! Another metal track, and Chico once does his vocal cords damage by screaming out the puzzling lyrics as loud as possible. Not quite as heavy as Elite, but good too, with some inventive bass, chords and beats, and another track where Chico can find the room to sing as well as scream. Good stuff. 9/10<br />10: Passenger - The best track on the album. That's all that needs to be said. Simply a man's love song to his partner, but with Maynard James Keenan from A Perfect Circle helping Chico out with the words. The trick with this track is to keep quiet as long as possible...then let rip with the guitars! Ending with some very quiet and gentle piano, this is truly great playing, singing, and drum hitting from all involved. THIS NEEDS TO BE A SINGLE! NOW! 10/10<br />11: Change (In The House Of Flies) - A great single, with some haunting melodies bouncing off the usuallly good guitar playing. This adds up to the fact this is another ambient-rock style tune, but better than all the others because there is a lot more sensitivity to the quiet side of things as well as being loud, but not noisy. Chico keeps calm for the majority of the song. For the majority, though! 9.5/10<br />12: Pink Maggit - The song from which Back To School developed. Much more relaxed and laid back than it's descendant, it floats over the first few minutes, before transporting into a slow rock melody. While Chico sings the chorus from Back To School, the rest of the group play out some slow, relatively quiet chords, ending with a lovely little heartbeat noise. Considering that Back To School was excellent, and this has the same tune but slower, I can't award this anything less than what I gave Back To School. Anyway, if it ain't broke, don't fix it! 9/10<br />The Enhanced CD is great too, you get a Pac-Man style game. If you complete all 6 levels, you get to hear &quot;Elite&quot; on Day 1 of rehearsals.  It's a fantastic album, so don't think otherwise until you've heard it all. This truly deserves a place in your Top 10. Hopefully it still will be when Limp Bizkit are in the bargain basement. So I end with saying, GET IT NOW!
B000002G60|4.0|Suzanne Vega has always been known for her quirky songs and production. This CD is no exception. The production of this CD is what makes it such a pleasure, the use of a variety of instruments in a style that will remind you of the Beatles' Abbey Road. Every song is good and this CD will slowly crawl inside your head and make you realize that Suzanne Vega is really good. When listening, try &quot;Caramel&quot; (tr#3), &quot;Headshots&quot; (tr#2), &quot;Thin Man&quot; (tr#6), and &quot;No Cheap Thrill&quot; (tr#7).

B000002MFE|5.0|I have always believed that Clapton is &quot;the best rock guitarist&quot;. This MTV Unplugged Concert gives us Clapton's greatest hits in an acoustic style. It is an excellent recording which showcases Clapton's guitar playing and vocal styling in a different context than his usual. Due to the fact that the audience knows so many of the songs, the performance sometimes feels like a sing a-long but as a whole this a lot of fun. It feels like you are there. That is part of it's appeal.
6303614493|5.0|Happy to say that I'm a proud owner of this movie on Laserdisc. What makes this a damn good story is the special effects is fully loaded with every move. And with THX mastering, this movie is worth the buy!
B000002GOZ|5.0|Bryan Adams uses the Unplugged session to its greatest potential. Bryan Adams has been around for years, and you will recognize just about every song on this CD. The first time I listened to this, I realized that I had forgotten that Adams is such a good songwriter. Adams takes full advantage of the unplugged session to display his mastery of the guitar. Bryan has surrounded himself with some superb musicians (some of which are from the Julliard School). His songs are showcased with strings, mandolin and uillean pipes which add to some outstanding arrangements. Sound quality is excellent. This might be the best of the Unplugged sessions.
6302038308|5.0|Groovey is all one can say to describe this classic movie. One of the few good things to come out of the hair metal, techno cheese pop 80's. It's a funny interesting horror movie. Bruce Cambell's one liner's never get old no matter how much you here them. The FX weren't very good but hey it was the 80's what do you expect. If you like smart @$$ humor and good horror movies invite some buddies over and watch Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn!
0385484518|5.0|In a world which offers so many &quot;words of wisdom&quot; books dealing with positive thinking and the significance of life, I didn't think I'd find one so fresh and simple as &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie.&quot;  Instead of packing a book full of quotes by philosophers, theologians, historians, or the Dalai Lama, author Mitch Albom (a much celebrated sports columnist) chooses to just simply recount a series of visits with a dying man.  Instead of a lecture, this is a story about a real relationship; instead of a book you can't put down, it's one that will make you stop and reflect . . . often.  The tone is, at once, both sad and uplifting.<br />&quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot; is warm, thought-provoking, and very easy to read.  It made me think often about family and friends, and about a TRUE teacher named Morris Schwartz, the likes of whom we should all one day have the good fortune to meet.  I give this my highest recommendation.
6302732778|5.0|A splendid film: Powerful, hypnotic and transcending both the Noir and Sci Fi genres.  The visuals and the score by Vangelis are powerful, intense and sublime.  The opening scene depicting a dark, futuristic and decadent vista of LA in 2019 is expecially strong, and this effect lingers upon subsequent viewings. The title score resonates through my being as if acquiring a tangible presence, and could almost be sniffed or tasted. Aesthetics aside, the central theme in this film, and to a lessor extent Philip K Dick's &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep&quot;, is what defines human? The replicants in the film are treated like mere machinery, yet express a greater humanity than any &quot;human&quot; characters.  It is a question that buries deeply into the viewer's mind and explodes like a stick of dynamite...
B000002KOQ|5.0|I discovered this album when I was about 10 (6 years after its release); my mother threatened to break it because I kept moving the needle back to the beginning several times a day, day after day.    Joni Mitchell was the first singer/songwriter to take my brain beyond the literal into the more complex world of symbols, metaphor and personal mythology. Among my favorites, &quot;Blue Boy&quot; -a sensual song of forever-to-be unfulfilled longing, &quot;Rainy Night House,&quot; &quot;Willy,&quot; the title song, &quot;The Priest,&quot; and &quot;Woodstock,&quot; -- I love them all.    This album has a seamless quality to it as well - one song blends beautifully into the next with the exception of a couple of spots like &quot;Big Yellow Taxi,&quot; which is thrust jarringly in between &quot;The Priest&quot; and &quot;Woodstock.&quot; Eventually my album became so decrepit from wear that I memorized the songs with their skips. It was wonderful to have it transferred onto CD so that I could have the lovely whole once more.
0060987464|4.0|This book is very good. Manson shares his life's experiances with us and lets us know that he went through some hard times before he got to where he is today. The book though seems like it is missing something though. But overall a great book.
B00003CXDG|4.0|If you saw the first one you deserve a full return on your money. Or watch this one and you will see thanks too John Woo (God Bless him) that this is the way Mission IMposibble is supposed to be done. Oh Yeah how Hot is &quot;Maya.&quot;
1878424319|5.0|I have read many attempts to distill the lessons of the universe. This one really speaks to me.  If I learn nothing else in this life, I will have done well to know and heed these simple statements.
6304493681|5.0|Great on VHS and even better  on DVD wit all the unique features. Great story and animation. One of the few Anime I would highly reccomend. You will be blown away trust me.
B000001FRY|5.0|Released in 1980, &quot;Boy&quot; was America's first glimpse at the 4 Dublin rockers who would eventually redefine rock and roll.  As the opening track &quot;I Will Follow&quot; begins, The Edge gets right down to business, launching his guitar into a full-fledge attack with a sound that keeps your foot tapping and head rocking the rest of the CD. <br />My personal favorite track is &quot;Out of Control&quot;, a song about a boy waking up on his 18th birthday (Monday monring/18 years of dawning) and realizing he doesn't know what he wants to do with his life or where he's going. It's a common theme that runs throughout the whole CD; a Boy searching for who he is and trying to overcome his hardships in life. And it's done with a lot of energy.
B00003CXE7|5.0|What can I say? If you havent' seen this you ar missing out. Great story from begging to end and the soundtrack is beautifully orchrestrated by Hans Zimmer. Tons of blood guts and gore. Crow is a Badass in this movie. IF you liked &quot;BraveHeart&quot; or the &quot;Patriot&quot; you will enjoy Gladiator. &quot;On My Single Unleash Hell&quot;
0446310786|5.0|&quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;&quot; is obviously one of the best American novels of the 20th Century.  It is the story of a young girl, Scout Finch, growing up in Alabama during the 1930s-40s.  She lives with her brother and father, the often referenced Atticus Finch.  Her father has been appointed to represent a black man being tried for allegedly raping a white woman.  The novel deals with the Finch family's persecution for Atticus's role in doing what he knows to be right, and specifically, how these events affect Scout's view of the world as she grows up.  <br />The picture Harper Lee paints in &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is of an honest, noble man and his struggle to raise his children as a single parent in the impoverished Deep South of the early 20th century.  They live in a neighborhood of several eclectic personalities, from the brooding, misunderstood Mrs. Dubose, to the mysterious Radley family.  The Alabama Ms. Lee portrays is a beautiful rural arrangement of small towns and counties, with many wonderful, honest citizens, who are unfortunately overshadowed by the hateful actions of others.  <br />&quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is one of the most beautiful stories I've ever read, and it left me occasionally saddened, but ultimately proud of my homeland, the American South.
B00005A3KS|5.0|Completely hard-core action scenes all through out the movie. In my opinion one of Keanu's best movie besides the Matrix.
B0000039LE|5.0|Usually when you think a movie is scary when you are a kid, isn't the case when you've grown up.<br />But not with 'Halloween'.<br />This movie will keep you looking in your car before you get in; keeps you looking over your shoulder.  You cannot help but get goosebumps as you watch this.<br />The mood is perfect, the music is perfect, and the storyline is perfect.<br />Get this one, you will not be dissapointed.
B00003CXN4|5.0|Traffic a USA (Yeah that Network on Cable) studios film. At first Iwas not impressed about the movie when I first viewed the trailer, but it doesn not do the movie any justice at all. Traffic has around 3 stories running in it and intertwines together perfectly together. It is sorta like &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; but about drugs.
6302508878|5.0|King Kong is truly a classic in every since of the word.  Though it may be kind of slow starting off, when Kong shows up, it more than well makes up for itself.  <br />The special effects in this movie is better than almost anything you see today.  And this was 1933.  They didn't have all the computer equipment that we have today.<br />This one is a true classic.
B00003CX8J|4.0|Thank God they didn't screw this one much too. ONly problem I jave i if you are a big comic fan like I am the movie really doesn't do the comics justice. I was really impressed with the cast they brought the X-Men to life. I can't wait to see the sequel and I hope they come out with one.
0553106635|3.0|I did like this book, though I preferred the other two in theseries. Usually with writers I like, I get more into the series as itgoes along.  Instead, I found myself wishing the Martin would get alife and start letting something, ANYTHING good or cheerful occur. Itnever really did.<br />I remember when Steven Bochco started with HillStreet Blues, things just got more and more depressing to the pointwhere it was difficult to watch. It has happened with each of hissubsequent long running tv shows. Martin is similar, perhaps becausehe, too, is a television writer. The occasional dark strike in fantasyfascinates me.  Relentless stuff like this only depresses me. Where'sthe glory? Where's the heroism? Can't anyone ever get a break in thisworld?<br />Still, Martin is the best of the Big Guys writing today,showing far more ability that Goodkind, Eddings, or even Jordan, whoat least grasps the concept of good AND evil. Mercedes Lackey andElizabeth Hayden hold their own with him.  All in all, I guess I canrecommend this book, though I would wait for paperback...
B000058983|5.0|First, let me say that again Rhino Records has give us a sonic masterpiece. The power of the music is clear, and upfront. As for the music, it is some of the most beautiful, sad, insightful, and so intelligent that it sounds as if it was recorded today. This again proves that with all geniuses, there is some madness, such as Mozart, or Syd Barret, and Arthur Lee is no exception. The music he made with Love is an uncomfortable glimpse into the inner turmoil he was going through. While the lyrics are unsettling in their revelation, the music is majestical. The acoustic guitar provides a canvas of stark beauty while the orchestra provides the expanse. This is music that has to heard to appreciate, beacause all the accolades and words cannot provide the depth and the pain of these songs.<br /> From the eleven originals to the seven bonus tracks, Arthur Lee lets us feel his alienation and the pain of being of mixed race, of the personal demons he fought,or of the darker side of the City of Angels during the Summer of Love. About the only thing that could compare at that time was the debut album by the Doors. But the music encapsulates the words and carries it far above any thing you`ll hear today, because it is from his heart and head, and therein lies the power. This is essential.
B0000057C5|5.0|hey y'all,  if you are thinking about buying this cd, do it!!!! it is the most awesome cd... and in my humble opinion, the best that rammstein has done yet!
B000003MZU|5.0|Juan Luis Guerra and his group 440 were one of the biggest acts in Latin music throughout the nineties.  Listen to this album and you'll understand why.  It's little short of perfect.  Juan Luis is a native of the Dominican Republic but honed his musical skills at Berklee and Columbia.  He achieves a great mix of local energy and authenticity with polished accessibility.<br />The lyrics are infinitely imaginative.  Okay they're in Spanish, but they handsomely reward a little dictionary work and they're a great way to learn the language.  The catchy Bilirrubina hilariously hijacks a bunch of medical terminology to describe feverish feelings of unrequited love, while Burbujas de Amor (Bubbles of Love) sketches some outrageous but touching imagery - \\"I wish I were a fish . so I could blow bubbles of love wherever you want.\\"<br />The tunes on Bachata Rosa are all excellent, from a variety of upbeat danceables to some sweet, poetic ballads.  The arrangements are no less inventive than the lyrics - all that study certainly paid off.<br />If you like contemporary Latin music, then you're virtually guaranteed to like this one.  Highly recommended.
B0000028RR|5.0|NOw this is an awsome album back in the day when Rage wasRage. MOst of ther new stuff isn't that good. This is a good quality of music with the driving guitars and lyrics that zach,tom,tim, and brad put out on the album just makes it a masterpiece. This is a must have album along with Evil empire.
0792156684|1.0|This is so realistic. An old lady still deeply in love, with some kid she spent one night with more then 70 years ago. Does this not make sense to everyone. I mean she only had a husband and family, 'course she'd still remembers the guy. Let's see other problems? Too many horrid acting for one (Leo's best scene was when he looked like a frog sinking down down down...) The only good actor was the computer generated one who bounced off the propeller. Don't waste you time.
B00001QEE5|5.0|This is a wonderful book. Poetic and a brilliant read. What touched me most about this book was the part about John Huff. The reason is it was so very real. The emotion Doug felt was heartfelt. I know because I read it just as one of my best friends was moving away. It nearly moved me to tears not an easy task. Then there is the Lonely One. A chilling character that you never actually know. Yet the fear of the mother is felt by you. The question is this. What did everyone find so confusing? It is obvious that they either have never read Bradbury, or are incredibly daft. Yes it tells different stories, such as the middle aged man and the old woman, with lime-vanilla ice. But confusing? Never. Were one story stopped another picked up rather easy to understand. My recommendation, if you don't wished to be touched by Bradbury's jawcraker and poetic masterpiece, and never want to feel, then ovoid the book. If you want to go back in time and feel the joy's and sorrows of what most of us have left behind then buy it. In the words of Bradbury himself in the beginning of the book. &quot;The wine still waits in the cellars below. My beloved family still sits on the porch in the dark. The fire balloon still drifts and burns in the night sky of an as yet unburied summer. Why and how? Because I say it is so.&quot;

B000053GTF|5.0|I've been dying to get this for about two years now. If I could rate Sony I would give them a zero for teasing fans with phony release dates. But I give the DVD a perfect 5 even though there were some things I didn't like about it. First, they really should have used the &quot;Because You Loved Me&quot; video instead of a live performance. She performs it fine but at the end of the song she stops it and talks to the audience. That's fine if you're in the mood to watch a concert tape but not for a music video collection. Also, they should have used the video of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; instead of the live performance. Peabo Bryson's voice is a whole lot better than Terry Bradford. The last thing that bugs me is that they included the single version of &quot;It's All Coming Back To Me Now&quot; in with the rest of the videos. I'd MUCH rather watch the full version. A video as beautiful as that should be seen in it's entirety. They should have put the single version in the bonus material and the full version in with the videos. Other than that I have never enjoyed Celine's videos so much. Seeing it with a DVD quality picture is a real treat. And I absolutely love the new videos like &quot;If Walls Could Talk&quot; and &quot;Live For The One You Love.&quot; Celine's videos are always so beautiful and that's why I could not wait to get this. Now if they would only make a volume 2 and put the rest of her videos on it.
6305364613|4.0|Once bitten by this visually incredible film, I felt not the need to escape into ignorance, as many who rated this movie with minimal stars did, but embrace the chaos that makes every tantalizing moment delectable and effulgent.  Yes, may it not be the best film ever made, but neither was Titanic.  Stunning imagery and lucid romance made both successful, and both fiction.  While William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet may not have the scope of Titanic, or the believability, one of, if not the best, plays ever written was caught within a delicious trap of stunning imagery that brought to mind thoughts of a mindtrip.  Acting, moderate, writing, tantalizing and decadent, and imagery absolutely consumable.  Take a copy home, and perhaps the serpent shall wait to bite you.
B00004XONN|5.0|I didn't expect this to come close to their 1997 odyssey &quot;OK Computer.&quot;  And it doesn't--it goes to the opposite end of the spectrum.  But the quality is just as good. Whereas the first one dealt with more straight-forward rock, this quieter, more oblique record alternates between organ and synthesizer backdrops.  In fact, the only one on here even vaguely resembling &quot;OK Computer&quot; is track six, Optimistic.  Starting off with the rhythemic organ pieces in Everything in its Right Place, moving on to the disjointed slurs of Kid A, and finishing with the beautiful harps in Exit Music for a Film, this album takes us on a thoughtful, disconcerting, quiet, exhilerating journey.<br />Mind you, it may be too weird for some, too disjointed for others (that's the only conceivable reason it lost Album of the Year; it was too contemporary).  Some people simply can't get into it.  But for those willing to make the journey, it proves to be the most soulful, original, thought-provoking album since...well...since &quot;OK Computer!&quot;  No album this year will lead you deeper or take you higher.  And that's why it's the best album of the year.
B00003W8NM|5.0|A film that truly takes advantage of the unlimited options available through DVD.  Along with the standard additions to a good DVD (director's commentary, deleted scenes, sound options, etc.) it adds numerous additional options.  FX commentary on the special effects, 4 different commentaries of the film!! (director, director &amp; actors, etc.) and many more features that aren't normally put into DVDs.<br />The film itself is a great piece of cinema.  Edward Norton, Jr. is one of the greatest actors today and does not disappoint with his performance in this movie.  Brad Pitt, Helena Carter and others perform excellent acting jobs in this memorable film.  A film that explores the &quot;doldrums&quot; of 24/7 consumer life; ignore the sometimes unrealistic fiction (ie numerous law-breaking acts with no police reaction, the Fight Club's contacts in every business in the city, etc.) and enjoy the film for the great piece of cinema it is.  An ending that ranks right up with &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; as far as surprise finishes.
B000002N3J|5.0|I'm a big Madonna fan and I love this Cd.It has some of her best songs on it like &quot;Live to Tell&quot;,&quot;Oh Father&quot;, &quot;Take A bow&quot;, &quot;You'llSee&quot; and &quot;This Used To be my Playground&quot;.If you're looking for upbeat dance songs try,&quot;True Blue&quot;or &quot;Erotica&quot;.These are her slower and more orchestrated songs.
B00004YA66|4.0|Frequency is a movie that entertains, thrills, and stimulates, but all that can be ruined if you think too much about it. Dennis Quaid plays Frank Sullivan, a firefighter killed in a fire in 1969. Thirty years later, his son, John (played by James Caviezel), finds his father's old ham radio. Through the miracle of the Aurora Borealis (how many of THOSE do you see in New York?), they manage to talk to each other through the ages. Through this communication, John saves his father's life, but he changes history so that a famous murderer is back on the lam, and he is going to kill John's wife. So far, so good. But soon after, inconsistencies pop up. All in all however, this movie is a fine story that was short-changed in the theatres. I would recommend it to anybody who likes these kind of cross-time magical movies.
B00004RHZU|5.0|pink is really kool. i dont have the cd but i really want it.
0452282152|2.0|This book entered my house at the same time as The Red Tent. Like The Red Tent, it is a modern telling of a historically significant woman's point of view. Unlike many many many authors (Thomas Hardy and William Makepeace Thackery come to mind), neither the author of Girl with the Pearl Earring nor The Red Tent manage to convince us that they have any grasp at all of the era of which they write, nor do they, either of them, allow their greatly elevated heroines to experience the pitfalls of normal human beings. Oh, so noble, so talented, so clever, so circumspect. <br />Mostly, this book seems constrained and constipated. I for one really dislike the modern writing advice of continually paring down one's prose until it's practically a novella--you know, making each word count. Who the hell cares if a book is a 800 pages long? Give me some good social critique and a boat load of characters who have some depth and I'll read an encyclopediadic series. Viewed through that lens, Girl With a Pearl Earring is just the briefest sketch of what may or may not be an interesting novel. As it stands, it holds one's attention for, oh, about the life span of a may-fly. <br />Oh, alright. Read it for the lovely descriptions of Vermeer's paintings, as told to a blind father by his dutiful daughter. Read it for a little bit of sexual tension, and I mean just a little. No bodice-ripper here. The best thing about this book, honestly and truly, is the cover, and Chavalier can't take any credit for that. <br />My very best advice is to check this book out from the library. If you spend your hard-earned moola on it you'll only get gratification from saving one of your friends from spending money, since you will surely pass it on rather than hoarding it jealously on your bookshelf.
B00004Z4WR|1.0|I should have been gone from the theater in 60 seconds instead of sitting through this nonsense.  Cage and his crew attempt to steal a number of cars over the course of an evening in order to keep Cage's brother from getting killed by this cheesy gangster with a terrible accent.  From watching the previews, I had expected some neat car chases, but I forgot the first rule that movie previews, like your local recruiter, lie.  Cage of course overacts, and the rest of the characters are just annoying.  I've never seen the original Gone in 60 Seconds, but I'm sure that it's better than this trash.
B00003CXP0|5.0|My boyfriend and I were devestated after watching this film.  For thirty minutes all we could do was stare at each other, and not say a word.  I have never felt so emotionally drained after seeing a film as I was in this one.  Darren Aronofsky introduces us to four flawed yet likeable characters, and then steps back and lets them do the damage all by themselves.  A film about despair, lonliness, broken dreams, and people's inability to connect, even when they are right there next to each other.  Eleen Burstyn deserves and oscar.  And the rest of the cast and crew should stand up and be proud of one of the most amazing cinematic works I have seen in a long time.   THIS is why movies are made.
B00003CX8J|5.0|In a day when comic-to-film adaptations are usually severely lacking, X-Men shines above the rest.  Fans of the comic will be pleased to see that the characters in the film aren't all that different from those in the Marvel comic.  There are of course some liberties that the filmmakers took in order to keep new fans out of the dark, but all-in-all, the comic-to-film transfer was very satisfactory.  There are some great actors in the film, most notably Patrick Stewart as Professor X and Ian McKellen as Magneto.  The film does a nice job of introducing the characters, and of laying details of their individual histories.  The storyline was reminiscent of the stories written by Chris Claremont, and not the pathetic excuse for a comic that Marvel is currently publishing.  X-Men is a film that can stand on its own, although the director left it very open to sequels.  Hopefully they are not long in coming.
B00000AFDW|3.0|It safe to say that Paul and Gene are responsible for most of what Kiss records. What gets my attention is that that there is probably more than one Ace Frehley running around in New York City. The real Ace has a deep voice and sounds like either Tony Martin of Black Sabbath or Ian Gillan. Tunes like Psycho Circus and Within are distinctavely Ace Frehley's Riffs and Within was sung by all three original members. Bruce Kulick never played in that key with his years in Kiss. The drums are probably from a studio musician which Pete will not credit for. It is doubtful that Eric Singer or the deceased Eric Carr can phathom drumming like that as is evident in often described as a stale Kiss when money and greed dominated the minds of Paul and Gene and left the public wondering as well as their label if any attention was given to their sound. I found the drumming to be one of the highlights of the record along with Peter's ballad. The song Into the Void doesn't sound like Ace Frehley from the seventies. As far as describing themselves musically dead, traces can be found as one song is practically a copy from a prior song on the same record as jealously within the group becomes more apparent. It's time for the orinigal four to take their make-up off, as a threshold in their careers has been reached and to progress forward as musicians as some progression is demostrated on this LP.
0553269631|5.0|I think that you would be making a grave mistake if you were to read this novel without reading Carson McCuller's &quot;Ballad of the Sad Cafe.&quot; For in the &quot;Ballad of the Sad Cafe&quot; she gives a concise defintion of what love is. She sets up the lover/beloved relationship. It is this relationship between lover and beloved that motivates all the characters in &quot;The Heart is a Lonely Hunter.&quot; Each Character feels another character &quot;gets&quot; him. That they understand. Mick treats the mute, Singer, as her own personal God. Biff secretly loves Mick. All of these relationships can not adequately be understood without reading &quot;Ballad of the Sad Cafe.&quot; It might be that Carson McCullers didn't fully understand her view of love when she wrote this novel. She was, after all, only 23. But when you combine &quot;The Heart is a Lonely Hunter&quot; with &quot;Ballad&quot; it creates an undeniably accurate portriat of what love really is. McCuller's tell us that love does not always fit within the framework of society. Love does not always come in traditional forms. Her view of love may be pessimistic. She may feel that love always ends in sorrow but, at least I feel, she gets to the essence of what love is.<br />When you walk away from &quot;The Heart is a Lonely Hunter&quot; what will most strike you are the characters. Most likely you will see yourself or people in your life portrayed in the novel. That is the novel's strength. The characters may be freaks but they are huantingly similar to yourself.<br />Most criticism you will see levied agaisnt McCullers is that she ends with such a horrible view of the world. But, trust me, if you look hard enough you will find a more optimistic ending. It may take some digging but McCullers does end the &quot;The Heart is a Lonely Hunter&quot;, not happily but with some optimism. I would tell you how it is optimistic but then I would give away the ending.
B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix is a film that has a very personal meaning to me. That obviosly I can't go into details here, but I will tell you this, buy the ticket and take the ride. Everytime i watch this movie I notice something new. I view it at least 3-4 times a month. For those of you that have seen it and beleive in it, you know where I'm coming from. Those who haven't you are missing out on what is a Landmark in story telling and in movies period.<br />Thank you!!!
0385486804|4.0|WHEN I PICKED THIS BOOK, I HONESTLY HAD NO IDEA WHAT TO EXPECT. AFTER GETTING THROUGH THE FIRST CHAPTER I FIGURED THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE AN ADVENTURE STORY ABOUT A YOUNG MAN WHO GETS LOST IN THE WILDERNESS. I WAS ONLY HALF RIGHT AS THE STORY IS MUCH MORE. IT IS REALLY A PSCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF A YOUNG TRANSCENDENTALIST. IF I WERE TO PICK AN AUDIENCE FOR THIS BOOK, I WOULD SAY THAT IT IS ENJOYABLE TO READ FOR MOST ANYONE ALTHOUGH I HAVE HEARD OF SOME INSTANCES WHERE PARENTS GET UPSET BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT IT GLORIFIES REBELLING AGAINST ADULTS.
B0000508U6|5.0|This is one of the best albums around, all of the songs are provocative and fascinating. Coldplay's rise to fame from UK to America has been amazing, and they have many great single imports that are just as great. This acoustical sound is pleasant and unique. The lyrics are amazing, and all of the songs, from the extremely short but powerful Parachutes to the haunting Trouble, are excellent.  Here is a band that will achieve greatness.
B000050XEI|4.0|Enya has been a powerful songwriter that musically stirs one's thoughts into deep contemplation.  With most of her work, the listener will bask into the wonderment of emotion and ideas as your mind and heart are musically captured.<br />Her music crosses time as I have imagined myself in another place, in another time.  It further transcends geography.  I'm a European and now live in the United States.  Listening to Enya can spark thoughts on the Grand Cayon to the Alps or over the Pacific into the Volcanos in Hawaii.<br />This CD is better than &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot; but not quite as good as &quot;Sheppard Moon&quot; or &quot;Watermark.&quot;  It is however, still a great outing as she once again brings life to the contemplative side of music.  Her ability to provide celtic sounds and classical movements into life is beautiful.
B00000K19E|2.0|&quot;The Matrix&quot; is one of the weirdest movies that I have ever seen, by a country mile. A good bit of it is believable, but not when Neo gets shot twelve times and is alive just because some girl kisses him. This hit asks the question &quot;Gee, are we living a life every day that is a part of our imagination? Gee, are our REAL bodies in a deserted cell, lying motionless like a catatonic patient?&quot; The special effects are especially good, but having the same gun-toting quackers in expensive suits with handguns make this more like a lost effort. Parts of the science of this are interesting like the spoon(it bended, Keanu didn't balance it on his nose), but it shows Keanu and Lawrence in something that appears to be a fight with the mind, himself, it doesn't intrigue me or make much sense to me. Keanu, the only movie that you actually acted in was &quot;The Devils Advocate&quot;. This movie is as overrated as Alexei Kovalev and the end of it...well, there really isn't an end after the phone is hung up. The proposterous question isn't answered and everyone just walks away from it.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Princess Mononoke, the beautiful wolf girl. The humans are destroying the forest which contains the essence of life, the forest spirit. many people say that anime has no characterization or storyline, well this film proves them all wrong. THIS IS A MUST SEE FOR ANYONE WHO ENJOYS FINE FILM.

1878424319|2.0|I have read many spiritual authors and after reading the reviews of this book I decided to give it a try. <br />The book has a lovely cover and a lovely premise I just found that it did not ring true for me. I ordinarily do not leave reviews but I thought it might be helpful to give a counterpoint to the lavish praise of this book. <br />I found this prescription for happiness not only simplistic but also a denial of the human condition. I don't even think I'd like living in the heaven that Ruiz describes. Some of his ideas are thought provoking, perhaps even disturbing if a person was to take them to heart. <br />Not for everyone.
B000050XEI|2.0|This isn't to say I don't like any of Enya's cds. In fact, 'Shepard Moons' and 'Watermark' were great. But this cd offers nothing new, original, unique, or intriguing by a long shot. And I'm sorry but 34 minutes of music on a cd that took over 4 years to produce yet fails to offer anything new, tells me there aren't a whole lot of new ideas being presented on here. However, if you're a fan of Enya or celtic/etherial music, you *may* be suprised to learn that there is a whole lot more to this genre of music than just Enya. <br />I'd recommend buying albums by Emer Kenny, Clannad (especially &quot;Landmarks&quot;), The Blessing Tree, Secret Garden, 2002 (especially &quot;River of Stars&quot;), Maire Brennon (Enya's sister whom I think has a better voice) or Sarah Brightman (especially &quot;Eden&quot;) for starters.<br />I'm not knocking Enya as an arist - she's rightfully sold millions of albums - but I do think the novelty has worn off a bit and &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; is nothing more than a watered down re-hash of all her other albums. However, for some, Enya is all they know when it comes to this kind of music and so musical standards aren't set so high. But mine are, and &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; falls short of being a great album.
B00004T9UF|5.0|I never listened to rap before Eminem came out.  I find his rhythms and rhyme scheme to be fascinating.  I believe in total freedom of speech and if you don't like the lyrics, don't listen.<br />...OOL LYRICS TO SONGS, LISTEN TO &quot;IM BACK&quot;. MARSHALL MATHERS IS A COOL SONG TOO. HOPE YOU ENJOY THE CDg there money on a cd with innoproperite lyrics, and making him that much more rich.  He doesn't care about you.  He will do whatever it takes to make money.  He has led so many people down the wrong path in life. With his money he is probably going to spend it on drugs, beer, and other stupid stuff.  Why wouyld you buy something that has lyrics that talk about sex, voilence, drugs, and more.  Well hope you don't buy his cd.  Peace out.lad-about drugs of course<br />Amityville-em and his pals d-12 rappin it oy here<br />Kim-This one is truly a very strange song this is about eminem trying to kill his wife Kim and his hate for her.<br />Criminal-crazy last som stands out alot<br />I like this album just give it a chance to sink in and you will like it too forget about how people diss him and say hes not talented. It's goodan awesome beat.<br />The Real Slim Shady:  Ahh, the  'friendly&quot; radio song.  It's a good single, but the happy-beat doesn't  fit in anywhere on this album.<br />Remember Me:  Another &quot;EM going off  track.&quot;  It's a bit slower than usual, but yet another song that makes  this a great CD.<br />Im Back:  Em is mad.  He thinks that you forgot about  him.  Overall, a good-to-fair tune.<br />Marshall Mathers:  The personal song.   Em talks about his mom, and Kim.  It's a great slow song.   &quot;Slow?&quot;  Trust me, it works., beautifully.<br />Drug Ballad:  Em's  &quot;love song.&quot;  He mixes hip-hop choruses into it, and this is this  time's &quot;Cum On Everybody.&quot;<br />Amityville:  I don't particularly  care for this song, but it's good enough to not skip.<br />Bitch Please Part  II:  Guests galore.  It hits hard and fast, with the most straight-rap vibe  in this whole album.<br />Kim:  A funny-in-a-weird-way song.  His  &quot;Na-na-na-na-na&quot;s in the beginning is priceless, and so are the  lyrics.<br />Under The Influence:  Whoa.  Em starts out talking to  Halley-Jade, and then...........Whoa.<br />Criminal:  The perfect closer.  A  potential single, you'll love it.<br />As for the skits, Public Service  Annoucement 2000 is basically a continuation of the first album's intro,  Steve Berman is one where he pokes fun at a record-exec, and Ken  Kaniff............let's just say, he got ICP back.  <br />Em is angry at  SOMETHING.  You can hear it in his voice.  He yells, kicks, screams, and,  ultimately, gets his message across.  And in the process, he makes one of  the finest rap albums ever made.
B0000021RB|5.0|If you grew up listening to huge Chicago radio hits in the 80's like &quot;Stay the Night&quot;, &quot;If she Would've been Faithful&quot;, or &quot;Look Away&quot; (which were not bad songs at all) then I think it's time you start realizing what REAL CHICAGO MUSIC IS! This cd is with the band at it's best with all 7 original members of the band (Robert Lamm, Walt Parazaider, Terry Kath, James Pankow, Lee Loughnane, Danny Seraphine, and Peter Cetera) who made a gentlemen's agreement in 1967 devoting their lives making music together by forming a rock n roll band with horns, have accomplished that with their first cd CHICAGO TRANSIT AUTHORITY which was the first album to successfully release a rock n roll album with horns and stayed on the charts for 171 weeks setting the record (at that time). <br />This album released huge hits such as &quot;Beginnings&quot;, &quot;Does Anybody Really Know What Time it is?&quot; &quot;Questions 67&amp;68&quot;, and the old STEVE WINWOOD HIT &quot;I'm a Man&quot;.<br />For all of you 80's CHICAGO fans back then it was ROBERT LAMM who pretty much wrote and sang lead on most of their songs and not of PETER CETERA. When the 80's came it sort of became vice-versa. PETER CETERA didn't write anything on CTA but sang lead on &quot;Questions 67&amp;68 which was his only lead vocal on the album but it was actually a good performance and also if you 80's CHICAGO fans didn't know PETER CETERA was also a bass player and his playing was well recognized on this album unlike those 80's albums where it was synthesizers.<br />Also for you CHICAGO 80's fans, CHICAGO has a horn section too. And back then it was focus of the band instead of strings and synthesizers. In fact that was the whole reason why CHICAGO was formed and it showed on many songs on the album.<br />The other reason this album was huge success was because of the late Tery Kath who played guitar. Kath sang lead on &quot;Introduction&quot; and &quot;I'm a Man&quot; but his guitar playing just dominated the album in songs like &quot;Poem 58&quot;, &quot;South California Purples&quot;(my favorite), and &quot;I'm a Man&quot; just to name a few. Kath also recored &quot;Free Form Guitar&quot; which in my opinion is proof that he belongs in the same category as JIMI HENDRIX. KATH throughout his career was an underated guitar player(probably because CHICAGO'S music has changed over the years from hard rock to ballads that there was no room in their style of music anymore for his notorious guitar solos)I like to think that if KATH was still alive he would've either left CHICAGO and work on a solo career or take over the band once again and start doing like they did back in the days.<br />There are NO bad songs on this album and it's a shame that CTA was the only album &quot;CHICAGO&quot; came out with that was all rock and no ballads. I think even today in the year 2001 CHICAGO could still make another album like that. They do have their entire horn section left and their conscience keyboardist/vocalist/songwriter ROBERT LAMM. I think with those 4 left from the original 7 and who they got now in the band today it could happen.
6304806418|5.0|This is an entertaining movie, but it is not the true history of Evita. I hope people will remember that. Also, in regard to this movie's suggestion that, and a certain fellow reviewer's calling it a &quot;historical fact,&quot;: there is no evidence WHATSOEVER that Eva Peron was ever a prostitute. Just another example of one of the many myths, completely unfounded by the slightest bit of evidence, that have sprung up around this incredible woman.
6304913176|3.0|On the surface, Starship Troopers appears to be mindless SFX: good-looking youngsters drafted into a gory sci-fi war against space bugs. Not unlike an arcade-style videogame?<br />Beneath the surface, director Paul Verhoeven has adapted an anti-war novel by Robert Heinlein, and reprises anti-fascism themes from &quot;Robocop&quot; and &quot;Total Recall&quot;.  <br />In Starship Troopers, a one-world militaristic government uses 50's style propaganda to brainwash over-hormoned, idealistic high school graduates (and drop-outs) into signing up for interstellar military duty.  The enemy, we're told, are otherworldy bugs hell-bent on destroying planet Earth. Early on, we get filmed reports of Earth being devastated by major asteroid attacks. The result: Earth's government launches a full-scale space war, and our young heroes engage in graphic &quot;mano-a-mano&quot; mayhem with the bugs.<br />Yet it's never made clear who started the war, or why, or who is really attacking whom. Indeed, the asteroid attack on Earth is never confirmed; it's only reported on giant outdoor TV screens. For all we know, the reports could have been made up, pure propaganda pieces, intended to get soldiers fired up with hate and revenge. The viewer is led to suspect, and is tantalized with clues, but nothing is ever explained in this film.<br />Deliberate ambiguity is both the strength and the weakness of Starship Troopers. The movie does a good job of letting you know what it can feel like to be young, brainwashed, and sent into battle. On the other hand, since there's never an &quot;aha!&quot; moment where everything is explained, viewers are left with no sense of closure.<br />Overall, this film actually packs a thought-provoking message. As in real life, ordinary people don't have enough information or time to think before they plunge into war -- or, get plunged into it by cynical leaders with unkown motives. But we're used to films exposing and explaining, and we're accustomed to plots where our heroes suddenly &quot;get it&quot; and then rebel against the system. On that account, Starship Troopers doesn't deliver, and therefore the message can get lost in the heavy-handed satyre and violence.
B00004TJKI|5.0|If I'm not mistaken, ANATOMY OF A MURDER is the first Otto Preminger movie which has the honour to enter the DVD market. With Billy Wilder and Fritz Lang, Otto Preminger is one of these german or austrian native directors who built the legend of Hollywood after having left the nazi threat in the thirties. The interesting trailer of ANATOMY OF A MURDER you can find as extra feature on this DVD will give you the opportunity to hear the german accent of an Otto Preminger presenting the main actors of the film to the american audience of 1959. A curiosity for the 2001 movie fan.<br />ANATOMY OF A MURDER is a masterpiece which has really well stood the test of time. Almost three hours of projection which you won't regret thanks to a perfect screenplay and to outstanding actors such as Ben Gazzara, George C. Scott and naturally James Stewart. One can consider this Otto Preminger production as an adult movie for the audience of that period, the word &quot;anatomy&quot; being considered as a metaphor or to the letter. So the evocation by the court of Lee Remick's rape is not censored and described with words one would have hardly imagined in the mouth of a movie legend such as James Stewart.<br />The modernity of the movie can also be observed in the way Otto Preminger manages to desanctify the &quot;court movie&quot; genre. Just imagine that after 165 minutes of suspense, the director doesn't judge necessary to let the audience hear the final conclusions of James Stewart and George C. Scott,the prosecutor. Totally stupefying.<br />As bonus features, you will enjoy the trailers of ANATOMY OF A MURDER, PHILADELPHIA and A FEW GOOD MEN, incomplete filmographies of the principal actors, three vintage advertisings and different subtitles. The most interesting bonus feature is a photo presentation of ANATOMY OF MURDER that includes numerous features of the director at work and a musical backgroung of Duke Ellington.<br />Now, be advised that COLUMBIA TRI-STAR has decided to present you this movie with the artistic butchery of the PAN &amp; SCAN process so one of the most important scenes of ANATOMY OF MURDER , when George C. Scott tries to stress Lee Remick by standing right in front of her so that she can not see the signs of her lawyer James Stewart, loses a great deal of impact.<br />A DVD for your library.<br />Or for the garbage can as soon as the widescreen version is available.resent you this movie with the artistic butchery of the PAN &amp; SCAN process so one of the most important scenes of ANATOMY OF MURDER , when George C.

B000002UJQ|5.0|Obviously this &quot;voidness&quot; character is void of musical taste.  OK Computer is a work of genius.  As a whole, the album is more cohesive than any album by any band could ever hope for (with the exception being Pink Floyd), even with &quot;electioneering&quot;.  But when you look at the songs individually, if you are sensitive to beautiful music, you see the songs far surpass anything, by anybody (in the amorphous &quot;pop music&quot; genre, even Pink Floyd), ever.  If you consider yourself a fan of &quot;good songwriting&quot;, and you didn't find anything special about this album, I highly suggest you give it another try.  But, I reiterate, there is more to this album than incredible songwriting.  See for yourself, if you are not blind.
B00004T9VY|5.0|There are many great albums I own from the sixties and seventies.  This is the only one that I totally wore the grooves off and had to buy the CD . . . so far.  Not all at once but slowly over the years I wore it down.  Truly, there's not a bad song on it.  People only tend to argue about which they like best.  It's too bad it didn't make VH1's top 100.  I agree with the positive reviews above except I would recommend this over any greatest hits even as a starter.  Cat Stevens albums are indivisible.  As a song writer and introspective lyricist Cat is in rare company.  I honestly believe people buying it now will enjoy hearing it again twenty years from now; I have seen it bring tears to people reading the words for the first time.  Cat Stevens introduced a zen quality to music that has yet to be duplicate.  I give it my highest recommendation.  If you enjoy it half as much as I do it will rank among your favorites forever.
0425152251|4.0|Let's face it--philosophy can be rather dry.  If you think of the author's main objective: to write a novel focusing on the history of philosophy.  That any writer could pull this off is impressive enough, but also consider that Gaarder over-layed the philosophic lessons with a fairy-tale mystery.  The result is a very informative book that is also entertaining which should keep most readers interest engaged throughout.  Needless to say, unless one is inclined to the musings of philosophy, one should look elsewhere for their fictional enlightenment or escape.  My main suggestion is that the author might have considered to update the cosmological worldview of the universe by commenting on Albert Einstein's theories on relativity, and to have given some practical applications on those theories, which are mind-boggling and quite interesting in themselves.  Anyway, SOPHIE'S WORLD is an excellent premier for students of Philosophy 100. Also, translator Paulette Muller english translation is well-done.
6301562143|2.0|First thing - I'm a huge batman fan, and like many others I was waiting for years for the dark knight to get the sort of motion picture treatment that had been so great for the man of steel. I admit that I was caught up in the incredible hype machine that surrounded this film when it came out - I bought the t - shirts, posters, key rings etc. I went to see it at least five times and loved it every time. I could see it wasn't a perfect movie, but hey - that's BATMAN up there on the screen!!<br />Returning to Batman many years later without the euphoria, hype and anticipation, I have sadly had to draw very different conclusions. It is a very average movie first and foremost. The story/plot has a processed, manufactured feel to it. The script probably went through the hands of a dozen movie executives who all had their own `ideas' on how to improve it. A perfect example is the scene where the Joker sees a picture of Vicki Vale and suddenly becomes obsessed with her for the rest of the movie. It feels so forced and unreal - a phoney way to create a three way tension between the main characters. Another sickening example is the way in which the Joker is tied to Batmans' origin story. The result of such manufactured, unnatural writing is a movie that plods from one scene to another without any cohesive, organic flow, and ultimately tends to bore.<br />With the exception of batman himself (played admirably by Michael Keaton), all of the other characters seem to fall into two categories - forgettable (Vicki Vale, Alfred, Commisioner Gordon) and irritating (the Joker, Vicki Vale's reporter sidekick). I remember thinking that Jack Nicholson was really great as the Joker, but after repeated viewings, his performance seems to have the whiff of Jar Jar about it.<br />I hate the way it looks. It is often described as a `comic book come alive'. I just think it looks fake. `Superman: the movie' was set in a real world setting which, I think increased the sense of wonder when something extra ordinary happened. Batman's costume is a classic example of style over substance - it looks great in still shots, but in motion batman plods around like Frankenstein's' monster, totally paralysed and unable to move his head from side to side. The Batman I know is an incredible gymnast who can swing through the rooftops.<br />Its' biggest crime is the complete lack of respect it shows to the source material.

1878424319|3.0|The Four Agreements is brief treatise on how people create their own realities, and what they can do to improve that reality.  Ruiz offers a blueprint for treating yourself justly and lovingly without trying to change other people.  There is much here that is very good practical advice - especially the suggestions to cultivate some distance from your thoughts and other people's words and to replace old &quot;agreements&quot; with new beliefs about yourself.  In fact, there's really nothing mystical or too &quot;out there&quot; in this common-sense book, and I see little, if anything, that would offend most Christians I know.<br />The book is sometimes too obvious and too simplistic to be ultimately satisfying, however.  When I read it, I kept thinking that this book embodies some of the worst characteristics of New Age writing.  The writing is often stilted and the chapters repetitive.  The book would be better had it been edited more tightly.
B000050XEI|5.0|Being a fan of Providence brought me to Enya!  The February 16th episode featured 'Only Time' which I LOVED. At the time I did not know who sang this, and the credits rolled so fast I was unable to catch the artist.  It haunted me for a week, until I got on Amazon.com and found Enya (a favorite of my husband's). A Day Without Rain and Watermark is now the beginning of my collection and they are both worth buying. This type of music can relax, refresh and just set the mood!
B00003CXE7|2.0|&quot;Gladiator&quot; the much hyped, Oscar nominated flick was ninety five percent lame in this reviewer's opinion.  This seemingly endless film gets two stars only for the presence of the late great Oliver Reed (who has played much better roles), and decent costumes and fighting sequences.<br />Gladiator tries to be a Ben-Hur or a Spartacus but instead succeeds in being only boring and laughable.<br />Comodorus's character was particularly inane, and it is impossible to believe that all those soldiers couldn't bring down Maximus-great soldier or not.<br />The film's plot, if you can call it that, is totally uninvolving. I found myself completely uninterested in the plight of Maximus, and the killing of Maximus's son and wife was just predictable and lame.<br />I kept checking my watch to see how many more interminable minutes were left. Avoid at all costs, if entertainment is your aim. If you enjoy plotless films with lots of fighting and strange incest subplots by all means pick it up.
0452282152|3.0|I so wanted this book to be good! Unforunatelly, I was mildly dissapointed. I am even not sure if the author conducted a serious research on the topic. She stated that she read two books on Vermeer and used the catalogue from an exhibition. Is that all?! I sincerely hope she did go to Holland though. I say the story is &quot;flat&quot; because there are no layers, there are no changes in pace, it's (almost) monotonous, the characters are not defined well... The only character in the book that was more developed is that of Maria Thins. And the only &quot;intense&quot; moment was when Griet was left without her cap. The relationship between the master and his maid is strange. They are in love but he behaves like he doesn't care about her a bit.(?!) One more thing that caught my attention. Near the end, Griet talks about her second venture to the house saying:&quot;...two girls, lined up as their older sisters had been ten years before when I first arrived.&quot; Well, she says that in the year 1676. She first arrived in the house in 1664. Little more than ten years I think?<br />It could have been a great book. I hope the author will read these comments and think about what she can do to improve her storytelling.
0790736233|1.0|This is one of the many books that never survived the transition to film.  The director concentrated on special effects (which are impressive) but completely ignored the more important elements of character and message. <br />Jodie Foster does a respectable job, given the script, as Ellie Arroway.  The rest of the cast is entirely forgettable.  In the novel, the character S.I. Hadden is terribly important to the philosophical debate.  He is reduced in the film to a bit part, and a kook.  <br />Sagan's novel is an elegant debate between Science and Religion.  Both are given the respect and skepticism the righly deserve. The novel is brilliant in its observations about the orthodoxy of both.  The novel's characters are rich and fully developed.  The film fails miserably. <br />The novel is less a sci-fi story than a rich debate of philosophy.  The film is nothing more than sci-fi special effects.  Several important characters from the novel are &quot;rolled into&quot; a single, rather pathetic, character of the film.  <br />Perhaps the most egregious sin the film makes is creating a sexual relationship between Arroway (Jodie Foster) and Palmer Joss (Matthew MacChaughay).  This NEVER HAPPENED in the novel, and it completely destroys the intellectual content of the novel.<br />The film was originally supposed to be made by Franscis Coppola.  In the year or two prior to Sagan's death, there were some legal problems, and Coppola lost the rights to the film.  Instead, it was made by Robert Zemenkis.  Zemenkis destroyed the novel, and create a most mediocre film.  We can only wish that Coppola had the chance to make it. <br />Skip the film. Read the book.  The book is an elegant dialog between Science and Religion.  The film is just a movie. The only thing worse they could have done in the movie is cast Tom Hanks.
B00000J7SO|3.0|Bob has confounded folks over the years, losing fans, gaining new ones, shedding those fans and their perception of him as he embarks on a new creative influence, always lunging forward, for better or worse. Bur nothing he has ever done in his tumoltuous career, not his forlay into christian, or his boozing cynical burn-out rock star laziness of the mid-1980s is as confusing, cryptic, and downright bizarre as this album &quot;Street Legal&quot; from 1978. Changing of the Guard, Senor, Let's Talk This Over, and the last track are amazing and strange works. But Bob's use of imagery is right on, graphic in detail, even if I have no idea what the hell he is singing about. There are some downright awful songs: Is My Love in Vain is just a peek into the cliche, watered down lrics of his meltdown period in the mid-1980s, and No Time to Think is just slogans turned round and round without any real meaning. Then there is New Pony, which is a great rocker. All in all, it is an odd and interesting album, not exactly a classic but one that has left Dylan fans scratching their heads in confusement.   Isn't the joy of listening to Dylan the permanent head-scratching that happens after one of his records finishes up. If so then Street Legal is up there in this seminal tunemakers vast body of work, do I dare say cannon. Plus, who can resist Bob's nasal twang backed by gospel singers.
0800141660|5.0|I first saw this movie back in 1996 on a trans-atlantic flight from Italy to Toronto. While mostly everyone else on the plane was sleeping, I was bored and decided to take a chance on watching what I thought would be yet another boring, stiff, English movie. I couldn't have been more wrong. Three minuites into the movie I was already laughing and smiling in my seat. For the next two hours I was swept into the glorius tale of two very different, but very lovely sisters. Unlike other British movies I have seen, I found the dialogue easy to comprehend and the subtle humor very funny. Every aspect of the movie was magnificent. The writing, acting, directing were all superb and you couldn't have asked for a better cast. Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet were amazing and perfect in the roles of the two Dashwood sisters. They were surrounded by a magnificent supporting cast, every actor performing his/her role to perfection. By the end of the movie I was bawling and smiling at the same time. The woman beside me thought I was nuts and I had to excuse myself to cry my eyes out in the bathroom. Back home the following week I purchased the movie and have since watched it too many times to count. The movie is firmly situated in my top three favourite movies of all time. It is truely a stunning and amazing movie.
6305508550|5.0|I don't know what sorts of jobs Mike Judge's work history includes, but if none of them were low-level (re: peon) white-collar jobs in large corporations, I'd be truly surprised. Office Space does nothing less than epitomize the life that anyone who has every worked in 'cubeville' can more than relate too.<br />Peter, our hero, is the everyman: five years (or so) out of college, a software engineer at the heartless Initech corporation. Every day, he trudges to work to battle with cliche-loving co-workers, eight different bosses (none of whom listen to a word he says), grey cubicle walls as far as the eye can see, and absolute apathy for his work. His friends Samir and Michael Bolton (yes, the name is just a coincidence) live in much the same world of bland mediocrity. What does Peter _really_ want out of life? To do nothing...to relax, sit, and not have a care in the world.<br />Help for Peter's malaise comes from an unexpected source: his nasty soon-to-be-ex-girlfriend who takes him to a hypnotherapist to help him get a bit more satisfaction out of his life and employment. Instead, Peter leaves the session cured a little _too_ well--Peter now intends to fully live out his dream of doing nothing!<br />Thus, Peter begins his assault on corporate America, skipping work, pursuing a new flame, and cleaning fish at his desk. Samir and Michael, pushed around by Initech for the last time, join him in his glory with a 'fool-proof' plan for funding their life of laziness. <br />This movie is much like the 'Dilbert' cartoon strip brought to life. Anyone who has ever worked as a nameless paper-pusher (as I did for three years out of college) behind those grey cubicles will find _Office Space_ an absolute hoot. While the DVD doesn't have many extras, the movie alone (and sitting back, doing nothing, and enjoying it) is worth the purchase.
B000001G6W|5.0|The Ninth has had so many different interpretations, and I think it is impossible to name one performance &quot;definitive.&quot;  But that said, this recording is the one I keep coming back to.  If you are like me, and consider Beethoven a synthesis of both the classical and romantic ideals, this CD is the one to get.  Karajan is very articulate and precise, but also fiery and emotional.  The finale has all the romantic thunder and joy, but never out of control.  The last 2 minutes have to be heard to be believed.  In response to the other &quot;great&quot; performances of the Ninth, I find Furtwangler to be hopelessly ostentatious and his extremes of tempo annoying.  The ninth recommended by Amazon, Bohm/Vienna, has the opposite effect: stale classicism that leaves me bored.  I think Karajan is the happy medium, and this is definitely his best recording.

The Grammy winning version of &quot;The Call of the Ktulu&quot; is enough reason to buy this DVD.  The piece was written for an orchestra.  It was originally performed with 2 guitars, a bass, and the luckiest set of drums in the world.  It was majestic.  With the SF Symphony, it sends chills through the spinal fluid of the most jaded listener.  As for the rest of the selections, you will never be able to listen to them in the same way.  The original versions will always be accompanied by the wonderful SF Symphony soundtrack burnt into your mind.  These 5 men that have performed in this group since &quot;Kill'em All&quot; will never receive the respect and &quot;critical&quot; acclaim they deserve from the Illuminati and Cultural Elite in this country.  However, there are millions of &quot;normal people&quot; who will continue to buy their music, cheer them at concerts, and vote for them to receive awards.  These &quot;normal people&quot; have made METALLICA the soundtrack for their lives.  The &quot;normal&quot; know what we like.  We know when people give 300% on every recording, every video, every concert, every public appearance, and every fan club decision.  We can tell when months of planning went into a 2 night gig in their hometown.  We will spend our money on this concert.  No fan will ever regret one penny spent on this.  As usual, it is cutting edge.  It has never been seen before.  It will never be seen again.
B000002UZ4|5.0|This album contain all of the songs when Pet Shop Boys were at their peak, it contains from their very first hit song, West End Girls to So Hard, which I see as an early 90's classic, and along the way you are treated to classics like It's a Sin and Heart. It is late 80's - early 90's pop at it total best!!!.
B00004XONN|4.0|Well, first of all, i would like to say that Radiohead is hands down the best band of the late nineties. I have been a fan since hearing &quot;Creep&quot; while on Holiday in Germany. I really think that everyone in here who is critiquing Radiohead and saying that they aren't groundbreaking are right. They are BRILLIANT and INSPIRED musicians, they aren't breaking new ground, they are leaping over it, showing us where music will be in 10 years. Atomosphere is everything in this record, and i for one would recommend it to anybody that wants a GREAT mood album. This album resembles closely Pink Floyd's &quot;Meddle&quot; in sheer audacity, however it has fast become one of my favorites. Not as good as &quot;OK Computer&quot; but thats like saying that the Beatles &quot;Abbey Road&quot; isn't as good as &quot;Sgt. Pepper.&quot; A great album by a great band. Loved it.
0060922583|5.0|This book will really get you contemplating !!!  The Holographic Universe is a new &quot;Theory of Everything.&quot;  Most models of the natural macrocosm need to reject paranormalism.  (hence the use of the word NATURAL)  This model has room to let in just about any phenomenon.  A bit like, &quot;You name it, and the holomovement explains it.&quot;  There's even some room for synchronicity =)  It will be opposed by the more conservative scientists but the model is actually alot more sufficient and satisfactory than their own Cosmologies.  I think this book is going to be met with loads of skepticism by the higher authorities. But judging by Talbot's writing, he doesn't seem too affrighted by this matter.  Perhaps they won't be opposing holographic hypothesises in general, however a physics book about NDE's, UFO's, Stigmata and Mysticism.. to his own personal werewolf transformations and trickster poltergeists.  Things like this shall certainly feed chuckles to a skeptic's belly, but I really hope that before they dismiss them they realize the implications of the Holographic Universe Theory.  That in it, a  reality comprised less of solid objects traveling in space &amp; time, and more of ghostly holograms of energy sustained by processes that are at least partially connected to human consciousness, miracles ARE possible, even &quot;natural&quot; (and I suppose therefore not actually 'miracles' in the religious sense) The broad purport is that our brains mathematically construct objective reality by interpreting frequencies that are ultimately projections from another dimension, a deeper order of existence that is beyond both space and time:  The brain is a hologram enfolded in a holographic universe. I found the latter portion of the book pertaining to dreams and OBE's as fascinating, and how remarkably these things were described in comparison between the traditions of the ancients in their own writings and philosophy.  I really must recommend this work to just about anyone for a brand new alternative perspective on the nature of &quot;REALITY&quot;   !!!!

0790751089|5.0|Life isn't always full of sex, drugs, profanity, and action, and we can't expect every movie to be a no-brainer like most movies in the mainstream continue to be.  That's why true movie connoisseurs appreciate a work of art with true moviemaking ability when one finally comes out - the Bridges of Madison County is unmatchable.  This movie brings back a time when life was simpler and the music was good.  Clint Eastwood has captured that certain quality and ambience that is characteristic of rural life.
B000003S1A|5.0|This is one of King Crimson's finest works. It is certainly more focused than anything before it and nothing since then has quite hit the nail on the head the way \\"Discipline\\" does. My only minor complaint is that it's a bit too short, clocking in at less than 38 minutes. Listening to this recording is like looking at an M.C. Escher sketch with your ears! You have to focus beyond what is obvious to get the full hypnotic effect. \\"The Sheltering Sky\\" is in my top five favorites from this band. The guitar work is like nothing I've ever heard before or since. At times, it's just mind boggling. This propelled King Crimson into the 80's. It has an 80's feel to it, but still sounds fresh 19 years later. One can't deny the obvious Talking Heads influence. That has much to do with the fact that Adrian Belew had just left a stint as an extended member of that band. Fripp himself had also contributed on the Heads' \\"Fear Of Music\\" in 79, so it's fair to say that both bands were an influence on each other. There is also an undeniable similarity between the voices of Belew and Byrne, though Belew is a much better singer. One listen to the beautifull \\"Matte Kudasai\\" is proof of that, and this new remastered version also contains a second version of that piece that was originally on the vinyl editon. All in all, this has all the elements that make up King Crimson at their best. Hard dissonance countered by other pieces that are soothing. This type of contrast is an element that has been somewhat lacking on later releases, though they still provide us with some of the most creative and challenging listening in rock music.
B000002UA7|5.0|I'm 19 and had never heard of Kate Bush until I saw her on vh1 listed as one of the greatest female singers.I bought this album along with some others and I was blown away to hear something so different from the usual stuff they put out there.
6304493681|5.0|I wasn't familiar with Anime or Manga, Japanimation and one of my friends wanted me to see this, With a lot of hesitation,reluctance and with nothing better to do I sat down to see this. On first viewing I found it Intriguing,Mesmerizing, Interesting, Philosophical and incredibly Disturbing. The main character in my mind was so life like that I wanted to find her somewhere..a Major Kutsanagi in our midst.<br />This film is incredible cinema and just goes to show how talented people can make the most if. Not for everyone ,some might find it boring,others might find it too long. But it is interesting nonetheless and if the first 10 to 15 mins intrigue you...your going to love this. I noticed some of Mamoru  Oshi's shots that he has directed animation wise are direct rip offs off  Ron Frick's Baraka, another great film. Baraka is a film of illuminating essence in its own right and I think Ghost In the Shell comes increasingly close. ranks highly on my list.
0684874350|4.0|It's been said that the English made the Irish speak English and the Irish taught the English how to write it. McCourt continues this gift for sure. In fact he stretches the reader's belief in some of his tales, especially in the stories about Theresa Carmody and Mrs Finucane. Sad to say, at the end, Mccourt has not been able to overcome his bitterness.

B000002J1O|5.0|Opening with Peter Gabriel's arching a cappela vocals,&quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot; represents early Genesis at thier strongest and most assured.After four increasingly confident but still rather amaturish albums (and a poorly-recorded live effort),the band took a huge leap forward,both in lyrical expressiveness,and musical cohesion.Gone were the clunky attempts at fusion-y,showy instrumental overkill of past efforts,replaced here with a beautifully organic,and astonishingly evocative sound.Individually,as well,the performances display a remarkable refinement:keyboardist Tony Banks finally finds his voice on the album-closing &quot;Cinema Show&quot;with a dynamic,sweeping turn;elsewhere,guitarist Steve Hackett imbues the epic &quot;Firth of Fifth&quot; with a bracing lyricism.Even drummer Phil Collins,who is always solid, finds new depths of inspiration on this record with his subtlest,most inventive playing.Vocalist Peter Gabriel's work is perhaps the most surprising.On earlier efforts his ambition always out-reached his grasp;consequently,his lyrics and concepts could occasionally come off as a bit ponderous.But on &quot;Selling England&quot;,he strikes the perfect balance between intellectual reach and artful expressionism,while still throwing in some of his patented absurdist wit,as in the winking satire of big-business fat-cats and thier territorial wrangling in &quot;The Battle Of Epping Forest&quot;.The album as a whole is thier most eclectic,as well as thier most consice;extended,complex narratives(Firth&quot;,&quot;Epping Forest&quot;,and &quot;Cinema Show&quot;)are rounded out by the likable acoustic folk of &quot;More Fool Me&quot;(Collins' debut as lead vocalist),and the off-beat pop of &quot;I Know What I Like&quot;,the band's first hit single.On this record,the premier Art-Rock band of the Seventies achieve a sound and creativity that,unlike most efforts of similer bands,adds up to much,much more than the sum of it's parts.Evoking verdant glens,misty hill-tops,epic journeys,and vivid tales of humorous foibles,&quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot; is not only Genesis' masterwork,but also stands up to the best of any group's out-put.
630522577X|1.0|This film is an embarassment of riches, from every point of view.  Unfortunatly, it has &quot;too many notes!&quot;  Being released at the same time as the great &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; it can only be compared, and between the two, the only one which doesn't date is the great &quot;Mary Poppins,&quot; primarily because of it's star, Julie Andrews. &quot;Mary Poppins is a superior film in every aspect.
B000002J29|4.0|Hard-core Gabriel-era Genesis fans(such as myself) may feel a bit of trepedation going into this album,as it features early classics such as &quot;Supper's Ready&quot;,&quot;Firth Of Fifth&quot;,and &quot;The Cinema Show&quot; performed with Phil Collins handling the vocals for the recently departed Peter Gabriel.Well,rest assured,Collins does a more than adequate job;lacking Gabriel's theatrical flair and idiosyncratic charisma,he nevertheless delivers a dynamic,assured performance.Musically,the band is as strong as they ever were on record.Those used to the studio versions of these tracks will be shocked by the muscle and drive the band displays on the lengthy instrumental passeges,and the infectious bounce on the poppier tunes.On a personal note: as a long-time Genesis fanatic,the first time hearing this album was a rapturous experience.I was too young in the Seventies to hear them live in thier glory days;all I had was thier studio albums.Then I heard about this live album and gave it a listen.The first track I listened to was &quot;Firth Of Fifth&quot;.the performance was great,but what really moved was at the end,when the crowd erupts in cheers and applause.I nearly broke into tears.It was like suddenly being surrounded by thousands of new freinds.In the context of classic Rock music,this is simply a solid live album by a competant band,but for true fans like me,&quot;Seconds Out&quot;is a God-send.

630439845X|1.0|I guess I'll have to join the ranks of the &quot;great unwashed&quot; who just don't appreciate films like this.  I read where Ada was suppose to be so complex-not speaking and playing the piano well makes a person complex?  I didn't think she even gave her new husband a chance (plus, what husband (even nowadays) is going to haul a piano up a jungle mountainside...they're a pain to move from one room to another!).  All in all, I found this movie to be annoying.  I liked Anna Paquin-she was very good, but one little girl doesn't a great movie make!
0385470819|5.0|I love this book. That's probably the best way to put it. I really love this book. <br />As a courtroom drama, it not only confronts the issue of whether or not we can take justice into our own hands, but also racism and child rape. It really makes you look inside yourself... maybe not me, as I'm not old enough to have children yet, but if you had a child that was raped, what would you do?<br />This book makes an especially strong impression on me because I want to be a lawyer someday. I don't think I would want to be a &quot;street lawyer,&quot; but just the same it tells me that being a lawyer isn't necessarily a peice of cake. <br />As of now, this is the only Grisham novel I've read. But I can truely say that I will be reading more soon.<br />Read this book. You won't regret it.
B00004XPOZ|5.0|I know a lot of people have said that, but in this case I really have to agree. These movies have been my all time favorites for about four years now, when I first saw them. I've had a lot of favorite movies in the past, but none of them did Star Wars justice in terms of characters, story and music.<br />I'm not going to go on about the plots because most of you already know them. But I have to say, unlike many of you, I was glad this was re-released because I never owned the widescreen versions of these but now I realize they are visually better than the standard format. <br />Like many of you though, I do wish they would release this on DVD but it didn't really matter to me at the time because I hadn't owned a DVD player when they were released but now that I have one I will count the days until it's released on DVD.<br />As for the Episode II stuff, it wasn't really worth the wait but it had it's moments, especially with the anecdote of Anthony Daniels talking about what it would be like if C-3PO found out Darth Vader was his father.<br />Anyway, great movies, great release, it's just great. 10/10
038533348X|5.0|Having read many of Kurt Vonnegut's novels, both the sublime (MOTHER NIGHT) and the ridiculous (TIMEQUAKE), I felt I was prepared for CAT'S CRADLE.  And, as usual for Vonnegut, all his usual elements are here: the purposefully simple prose, the distrust of established dogma, sex, religion, science, et al.  But upon finishing CRADLE, I was awestruck at my unpreparedness for the true mobilizing force behind the plot.  Rage.<br />CAT'S CRADLE is an angry book, full of loathing and despair for the construct we call humanity.  Vonnegut has always been one of the world's best moralists, but CRADLE finds him almost unhinged to the point of mania.  And yet, it is quite likely Vonnegut's greatest and most entertaining achievement.<br />The narrator, Jonah (or so he informs us), is an author bent on penning a novel which will encompass the day the hydrogen bomb was dropped on Hiroshima.  His research leads him to the family of Dr. Felix Hoenikker, a scientist involved in the invention of the bomb.  As he talks to the family, and other scientists, he becomes faintly aware of a fictional substance called `ice-nine', which had befuddled Dr. Hoenikker for some time.  In true Vonnegut fashion, this subplot is dropped until needed, as several years later Jonah meets up with the Hoenikker family in San Lorenzo, a tiny third world country with a bizarre origin and an unusual religion.<br />I don't want to give too much of the plot away.  Unlike several of Vonnegut's more recent works, the plot does play a large part of the novel's progression.  Suffice to say, the fictitious religion of Bokononism plays a large part in the story, as do insanity, death, power, Armageddon, clarinets, stone angels, and love.  And it all proceeds logically, especially in the context of the teachings of Bokonon.<br />Like the best of Vonnegut, the deeper themes only come to the reader after they are replayed in the mind.  Vonnegut's distrust of religion is evident as always, as Bokononism is based on the premise that all religions are lies, including Bokononism.  But Vonnegut doesn't simply slam religion; Science, as the alternative, is equally a cause for distress, as power-mad generals demand new methods of destruction from their scientists, and the scientists don't consider the possibility that perhaps some problems should never be solved.  Vonnegut finds no happiness in ignorance, but he finds none in knowledge, either.<br />Why, then, is CAT'S CRADLE such a funny book?  Any other author might have well been crushed under the weight of manic depression.  But not Vonnegut.  He revels in man's insanity, in man's arrogance.  Vonnegut cannot provide an answer; neither should he be expected to provide one.  He realizes that by delivering a soliloquy on a method to save us, he would become that which he despises the most: a preacher.  Vonnegut knows there are no easy answers.  All he can do is provide examples of where our current behaviour will take us.<br />CAT'S CRADLE is simultaneously hysterical and horrifying, a morality tale that remains as relevant in the 21st century as the day Vonnegut published it.  Anyone who believes they have the answer to mankind's problems should read it at once.premise that all religions are lies, including Bokononism.

0807126063|2.0|Three quarters into the book I wished I hadn't spent the time reading it.  It was fatiguing to read the same arguement over and over, nothing new develops about the characters, nothing made me want to finish.  I skimmed the last one quarter.  Maybe East Coast intellectuals can laugh at the antics of those silly southerners but here in the Northwest I prefer my humor more dry.
B00002MZ4W|3.0|I'm not going to echo the praise of the other reviewers here, though I do agree with most of it. Fiona Apple could develop into a terrific songwriter if she gets over a few crutches. First of all, if I may offer her some advice -- put down the synthesizers and back away slowly!! The overdone production threatens to crush every single song on this album, even more so than on Tidal. She's got some fierce piano pounding in here (&quot;On The Bound&quot;) but it's continually covered up with annoyingly fake orchestral effects. Fiona is now at the level where she can afford to get some real players on her album. A less organic songwriting voice would do just fine with the pop-and-circumstance production, but for this singer it drags her down. It really reduces my enjoyment.<br />Secondly, her style really needs to be freed up a little. You can feel the constraints on her verse-chorus-verse-angst-Angst-ANGST pattern. Anytime she breaks free of this, she really shines. &quot;Slow Like Honey&quot; on her last album is an example, &quot;Paper Bag&quot; is the closest thing on this album. It's the only song where she really sounds like she's having any fun with it. For another thing, the bridges in her songs are almost invariably better than the actual verses -- &quot;Fast as You Can&quot;, for instance. The song suddenly breaks loose in the middle, in a truly sublime moment.. and then it's back to the last verse, and a noticable downshift in energy. <br />The album is definately worth listening to if you're looking for an up-and-coming talent. I think she'll really shine in the future. On &quot;Pawn&quot;, however, she hasn't quite found her way yet.
B00000099Y|5.0|I reviewed this album when I first got it - at the time I considered Undertow to be better since it was more consistenly heavy. But after having it for a couple years now I realize that this album is much better. There is much more emotion in every song on this album. If you haven't gotten this album yet and you have any other Tool albums, go for it.
B000002MG1|5.0|This album is one of those albums that marks a certain time period of your life.  You remember when you were 13 and automatically you remember that this was the album that you listened to all the time.  That is the way it is for me.  I bought this album when I was 13 and I listened to it all the time.  I would put it on and listen to the whole thing all the way through.  It was the album that caused me to go from a person who liked music to a person who loved it.  The album is obviously a pleasure to listen to all the way through.  REM creates a mood on this album that contains on it the deepest feeling melodies and lyrics of any REM album.  This music goes beyond emotional realms into a world of remniscience.  Remembering good times and sad times is an easy thing to do when you listen to something like this.  The song &quot;Nightswimming&quot; happens to remind of a time at College when I went swimming at night with some friends in a cold lake.  The song fits the memory perfectly.  I would highly recommend buying this album so that you may experience everything that it is.  I can't really comment on any song in particular because all of the songs are so, so good.  Some of my favourites on this one are: Everybody Hurts, Try Not To Breathe, Sweetness Follows, Man On The Moon, and Nightswimming. Buy this album so that you may have something to remember certain times in your life as I have.  There were many great albums that came out in the early 90's but this one has to be one of the best.  This is probably my favourite REM album.  It will probably be yours too, so please do yourself a favor and buy it.
B00000JT9E|2.0|Well, Slayers' newest live concert footage lacks energy compared to their shows in their sprightly youth, that's for sure. Kerry King looks like an idiot sporting his new Anton LaVey 'do, and a lot of the aggression that Slayer was so famed for is gone. A disappointment for hardcore metal-heads will be the appearance of ex-Skid Row frontman Sebastian Bach hanging with the bad boys and the one Venom cover (&quot;Witching Hour&quot;) was utterly butchered. Slayer was once a great band, but they just haven't held up the way Motorhead or the Ramones have. A little goofing off is shown behind the scenes, but most of it is low-energy concert footage. I tghink it's time they gave it up before they have no fans left.
B00004XONN|5.0|This album is first and foremost a beautiful album.  While many people either love or hate the new album by Radiohead most of them fail to realize that Radiohead is being extremely brave in offering something that is very different from their last album as well as all the other pop music out there.  This is not pop music.  This is anit-pop music.  Radiohead has re-invented itself by making an album that is so innovative.  Many bands have done work similar to Kid A, and I'm not discrediting them, but I doubt any band could do something like this as good as Radiohead.  This album will go down as one of the greats even though not everyone will acknowledge it.  Yes, this album is at the same level as &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; and &quot;Dark Side of the Moon.&quot;  This is a risky comparison to compare Kid A with Dark Side but I think as far as the band is concerned this type of album is like these two classic albums because it is something that is so different from anything else and that makes it comparable.  The album is very different from OK computer so it is hard to say which one is actually better.  They are both brilliant in their own way.  I personally feel that OK computer was more of an album you really felt emotionally wheras Kid A is better in the creativity of the musical compositions.  From the beginning of &quot;Everything in it's Right Place&quot; to the end of &quot;Motion picture soundtrack&quot; Thom Yorke's incomparable voice paints landscapes of emotion that can change your mood immediately.  The album has a melancholic beauty about it.  Every song on this album is not the traditional song it is rather a bunch of sounds that are put together to form music.  Think of Pink Floyd in the Dark Side of the Moon.  The band uses computers extensively on this album but does not abandon there traditional sound on every track.  I like that the band used computers and other things they have not used before because they do it perfectly.The album really does not sound synthetic or like Techno music it sounds like the computers they used were just another instrument that they had to master in order to express themselves.  I also like all the tracks.  I like every single song on the album.  They all come together to form a complete cohesive unit that happens to be some of the most creative music to come out in a long time.  Bravo! Well worth five stars and well worth buying.
B00004ZEQX|5.0|For me this is definately my favourite Fulci film after Zombie. Its a bit more conventional as a pose to his usual outrageous horror. The dubbing is dodgy for the two children but all of his films have pretty bad dubbing. The one thing that this film has that some of his other films dont is tension. Especially in the scene when the celler door gets open. It also in my opinion contains some of his most controversial graphic violence from any of his films.   For the money that I paid for this I was very happy as this is the most uncut english language translation with all of the gore intact. Allot of people moan about different running times in these italian horrors. Particulary Tenebrae and phenomena. The scenes that werent included in tenebrae where never even recorded in english.    Diamond have transferred the japanese laserdisk very well and the colors are good throughout. My only complaints are that the film is in mono and that its only split into four chapters.  Anchor bays version will probably be a better print with a 5.1 soundtrack but ill stick with my plain jane version.
0380788624|5.0|I recently finished reading Cryptonomicon. I can't say when I have enjoyed a book as much as this. It has been a VERY long time. The story flowed well, and the mix of present day and WWII settings was very artfully done. This will probably end up being the most enjoyable book I will have read in the past few years. I now know that the rain and cloudy skies of the Pacific Northwest have been put to good use, driving authors such as Neal to produce good literature that I can eventually discover and read, then write obscure reviews via email on them which may be read, by a handfull of the intelligent few on the planet who still consider reading a pleasure! Disappointing to me, as I have just finished it. Good thing for me I haven't read Snow Crash or his other works yet!<BR>**UPDATE ** it's been a year and I still think highly of this book!
B00003CXDG|2.0|I gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1, because I am assuming when I fell asleep wathcing this in the movie theater that I missed something incredible.  I would not reccommend this movie to anyone, maybe if it is on HBO and you are flipping through the channels and have nothing else to do, you could watch maybe 25 minutes of it, before getting upset and turning it.  It is hard to beleive how bad movies can be, and still make so much money.  I wonder when people are going to help each other out and tell them not to waste their money on certain movies like this.  <br />D
B0000024JA|4.0|After taking the time to listen to this album recently I found myslef disliking Tical 2000 all the more because Method Man is definitely capable of groundbreaking work. I would have given this album 4.5 stars if I could because it is nearly perfect but not quite.  The RZA influence is evident in the grimy but appealing production style.  All of the tracks are solid but Bring the Pain, What the Blood Clot, and especially Release Yo' Delf stood out to me. Buy this album but please do not get confused and buy that Tical 2000....

Scream 2 is about the survivors from Scream. New characters were also added to the list. In the movie, Sidney, with new boyfriend Derek(when I saw this movie, to me he was a suspect), Randy, and some of their friends get attacked by another killing series. For those of you who never saw this, I don't want to tell you everything, because I don't want to give out too much info. For example, I don't want to tell you if there's one/two killers, and/or who it/they are. All I'm gonna say, is this was a great movie! And I think you'll like it. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE SCARY MOVIE!!!!!
B000002WU9|5.0|I don't know why the Wu-Tang has so much difficult realizing that RZA's creative touch usually guarantees a strong album. Rae's solo album demonstrates this trend.  Every track is strong but Criminology, Glaciers of Ice, Ice Cream, and Heaven &amp; Hell stand out. Verbal Intercourse is the shining jewel and is considered by many,including myself, to be amongst the top hip-hop songs of all time. This album's merits clearly justify it's purchase.
B00004XQ83|5.0|This is, bar none, the best movie soundtrack I have ever owned.  I have never much cared for country music, but I can't stop playing this CD!  Even my kids like it!  My son (7) walks around singing, &quot;In the Jailhouse Now&quot; and my daughter (4) loves &quot;In the Highways.&quot;  I have seen the movie several times (loved it even more than the CD!) and I noticed that there are at least two recordings in the movie that didn't make it on the CD.  Can we have sequel now please??  I'm hooked on this music now and I need more!!!  (By the way, I really like the way the songs are arranged in the order they appear in the movie.)
B0000029GA|5.0|I don't understand the recent trend of people saying that this album is overrated because the lyrics and production come together to form a masterpiece.  Too bad that Nas completely fell off after this record, but anyway NY State of Mind, Lifes a B***h, Halftime, and Represent all have more merit than most albums have in their entirety. The World is Yours is probably one of the most brilliantly executed songs of all time.  Once again this album deserves continued commercial support. Maybe Nas will come to his senses.
B00003CXP0|3.0|This harsh film demonstrated one thing to me: people need to have a purpose. The over-riding theme was that none of these characters had anything to drive them; they had nothing to think about other than what was missing in their lives or how to get attention. If the older lady had a plot of land to work or some children to teach, or got out and exercised instead of sitting in front of a tv all day long, she would have felt a lot better about being &quot;old.&quot; How sad that the only thing worth living for was the chance to get on tv. How sad for the other characters to live only to seek out more drugs. I love you Harry. If I heard that one more time, I think I would have to lose it. Instead, I'm going running! Thank God, there are SO many wonderful things ANY body can do!
B000001FYZ|5.0|This album shows how good hard rock can get with high flying amazing solos and great lyrical work and i dicovered this while staying up all night one saturday night in the summer of 1999. (12:00AM)It was gonna be another one of my late night being alone and rockin out sort of nights and I had chose one album to rock out to and i picked Crazy World. Now when i started listening to it the sound of it hit me like a ton of bricks and i ended up listening to it 6 times during to period of 12:00AM - 5:00AM, never really wearing out my likeing to it but sort of memorizing every word that Klause was singing.(5:00AM) I saw the sun was creeping up on the horizon through the living room window and at the time I was listening to &quot;Send Me An Angel&quot; and at that very moment me opening my eyes and seeing the sun and listening to that song at the same time created a feeling so powerful that i bursted into tears. With every good album i listen to i compare it to crazy world and no album comes close to the power to this great album had on me.
B00003CXE7|4.0|Gladiator is a fine film, even for those not who are not action movie buffs. There is plenty of gory action, but (dare I say) it is &quot;tastefully&quot; handled -- Scott doesn't drench the screen in blood and guts and body parts, though he does enough to convey the nature of war in the day.<br />Where Gladiator falls short is in shortcutting some important elements of the story. While the characters are detailed, there isn't much depth. Detailed exploration of personality is sacrificed to keep the narrative rolling along at all too swift pace. And the transitions are swift.<br />But I am not complaining too much. It is an enjoyable movie but not an inspiring one.
B000002572|5.0|Admittedly, you either like arena rock or you don't. Styx, REO, Journey, and the rest owe everything to Boston - all because of this album.  Boston was truly a one-hit wonder group, except their &quot;hit&quot; was an entire album - certainly one of the most musically gifted of the generation.  Criticize it if you like for being simplistic, or for being repetitive, or for playing childish lyrics - but realize that you are criticizing the intent of the album.  This is not a concept album, nor is it intended to be.  Pink Floyd or Led Zeppelin could never play the contents of this album.    And that's the sheer beauty of it.  The guitar work throughout the album is nothing short of spectacular.  Tom Scholz has clearly worked meticulously to produce the best possible sound - listen to the vast differences between Foreplay and Long Time and then realize how well they fit together despite it.  Brad Delp could not sing in any other group, but he doesn't need to, as his voice harmonizes perfectly with the music itself.  But the overall style of the music is what gives the album its legendary status. There have been few albums in history as listenable as this - Led Zeppelin IV or Who's Next are the only two others I can think of with no poor tracks.  This constant level of quality is maintained by the poetry inherent in every track - every song on the album slowly builds to a musical climax, drawing the listener into the song and making it nearly impossible to turn it off.  If you've never heard this album, or simply write off Boston as one of *those* bands, I encourage you to do this: sit down in a location with few disturbances and just listen to &quot;More Than a Feeling.&quot;  I dare you not to like it.
B00004XONN|5.0|When Schoenberg brought out his twelve-tone system in composition in the early 1900's people were saying that he was mad and that this wasn't music - just random notes on random instruments. Others were saying that this was the future of music and he was a genius. In 2001 there is still a spread of opinions on atonality and serialism. So what does this have to do with Kid A? Well, Kid A (along with other such albums people compare it to) are the modern equivalents of this. Listening to previous Radiohead releases and Kid A will make you wonder whether it is the same band. And obviously there will be people that say it is fantastic and others say it is crap. There will be people that say that it will make sense in 30 years time (which I disagree with completely). People will say a lot but in my opinion any review of this album is completely useless to anyone else because you will need to gain your own perspective. Buy this album - listen to it a few times and ask yourself if you understand, if you can hear what Thom is saying to you. If you hate it - sell it, it's simple. But don't throw it away after 20 minutes because you don't 'get it'. Kid A is about more than that. I think it is a brilliant album - I know that people say that other bands would have done this better but the beauty of this album is that Radiohead did it. I can hardly imagine Aphex Twin bringing out Ok Computer. Some songs like 'Everything In It's Right Place' and 'Motion Picture Soundtrack' are unbelievable in their effect. Buy this album.
0800129806|5.0|It was a really good movie apprpraite for almost any age.  There was no foul language or sex.  It was a very action, fighting movie.  I would reccomend this to anyone... SEE IT!
0060922583|5.0|i have not even finished half of this book and i am already in awe of this holographic paradigm.  perhaps it is because i have always been wary of the confidence we put into modern scientific theory.  i am quite certain that we are far from a &quot;complete&quot; theory of physics, and that we may never find an end to the dynamics of the universe.  anyone who feels that science is a ladder you climb to get to the top, you probably won't even try to read this book -- and i think that is probably a good idea.<br />never have i learned of such a unique and simple explanation for so many phenomena i have heard of, and some that i have witnessed myself.  because of this, i hungrily progress through this book.<br />i have a comment on a review posted by &quot;Joseph Pierre,  Author of THE ROAD TO DAMASCUS: Our Journey Through Eternity.&quot;<br />he mentions that the 'analogy' of how a hologram is produced confuses him somewhat.  i think that this is an inaccurate interpretation of the meaning in the book.  i believe that the analogy used is not to the production of a hologram but how the &quot;illusion&quot; of a 3D image can be perceived from a seemingly random interference pattern.<br />i believe the lesson to learn is that what we SEE as reality is in fact an ILLUSION created by our brain, which inputs the interference patters through our senses and interprets them into what we see as reality.  this is similar to Plato's analogy of &quot;The Cave&quot;.  however, since this is only an illusion, any theories of physics that we base on it will only be explaining reflections of the true physics of the universe.  thus, we can never fully explain all phenomena with such a shallow perspective.  if we ever want to understand what's really going on &quot;out there&quot;, we will have to explain it in terms of its TRUE fabric, and not in terms of the reflection of the fabric that we THINK we see.<br />thus, there is not necessarily a &quot;reference beam&quot; of the universethat is split and reflected off of a cosmic object.  this is taking things too literally.  rather, the universe is a sea of interference patterns, and sentient life has the unique ability to interpret the patterns into perception.  in a sense, there is no laser that creates the original image, but our brains are the laser that creates the illusion of a 3d reality out of these NATURALLY occuring interference patterns.<br />best regards, dave
B00003CWTH|5.0|The first time I saw this movie, frankly, it shocked me. However, it was so hypnotic that I could not stop watching it.  Many viewings later, this movie has become one of my favorites.  The story is great; the actors are great.  It shows how a group of messed up, strung out people are connected with one another.<br />Paul Thomas Anderson is a great director and writer; this movie showcases his talent.  Tom Cruise is wonderful as the sex guru; I didn't know whether to laugh or cry in some parts.  Julianne Moore is one of the best actresses out there today.  I usually don't like to listen to Phillip Seymour Hoffman (his gravelly voice irks me!), but he is also wonderful in this film in an understated role as Phil, a male nurse.  Melora Walters, John C. Reilly, and Jason Robards also have wonderful roles.  There are so many excellent actors and actresses in this film, it is hard to name a favorite performance.<br />The soundtrack is excellent also; the music of Aimee Mann cuts to your very soul.
0449227421|3.0|<BR> The plot is predictable and the characters stereotypes, but it moves fast and keeps you turning the page. If you need something to read on a long flight that won't strain your brain too much, this is it. <BR><BR> However, if you're a Ken Follett fan you'll find that this book is not one of his best. And if you haven't read a lot of Ken Follett try &quot;The Man from St. Petersburg&quot; or &quot;Pillars of the Earth&quot; (if you're up for 1000+ pages) rather than this one.<BR><BR>
B00000JJQK|5.0|First things first, I'm 14 years old and my dad got me listening to the Beach Boys/The Beatles/Elvis/Otis Redding...<br />This is one of the absolute best CDs I have ever heard, the songs actually mean something and were written by Brian Wilson while he was probably on some drugs or something... If you read through the book, it tells you some interesting things about the Beach Boys and I even read somewhere that Brian Wilson was trying to make an album like Rubber Soul and one of the Beatles (I forget which) said that Pet Sounds was the best album they ever heard. I also remembering that this album really flopped when it first came out because it wasn't their usually surfing sound, but not it is considered a classic!<br />So now the Review really starts-- Wouldn't It Be Nice- One of the most famous songs on the album about a young guy and a young girl waiting to grow up so that they can always be together. It is a really good song with some music... The man was a musical genious!<br />You Still Believe in ME- The song begins with horns and bells and stuff because it was once called In My Childhood... I really like this song, the lyrics are very good. They said that they had to pluck strings with many different things until Brian got it the way he wanted it... This song is one of my favorites!<br />That's Not Me- It's a song about looking back on something that you did and thinking &quot;that's not me, I didn't do that&quot; I think this one is my absolute favorite... My #1 favorite song ever...<br />Don't Talk (Put Your Head on my Shoulder)- A very slow song, but I like it nonetheless... This is sung by Brian Wilson himself and no one else... I love the fact that after he says &quot;listen listen listen&quot; it sounds like a heart beating... Brian Wilson is a musical genius!<br />I'm Waiting For The Day- I love the drums in the beginning... I love the song because the voices sound so great in this song, even though Brian Wilson didn't like them, I thought they weregreat. Plus, the drums sound really good in this song! In fact, this is probably my second favorite song, really! &quot;I'm waiting for the day when you can love again... he hurt you then, but that's all done, I guess I'm saying you're the only one&quot; is a great part of the song... I love it!<br />Let's Go Away For A While- This song is an instrumental... I love his instrumentals because it shows that he was indeed a musical genius... He had to make everything absolutely perfect in this album before he would put it on... This song is really relaxing, too.<br />Sloop John B- A really great, famous song... I like the story to the song, too. It's a really good song... <br />God Only Knows- Another really great, famous song! I think that it's a beautifully written song and I love the percussion in the background... I love the part that goes &quot;If you should ever leave me, life would still go on believe me, the world could show nothing to me, so what good would living do me? God only knows what I'd be without you...&quot; It's a really great song, all of their songs you should play many times to listen to the words and then to concentrate on the music in the background!<br />I Know There's An Answer- said to have been written as &quot;Hang on To Your Ego&quot; which was some LSD thing, they changed it to &quot;I Know There's An Answer&quot; to make it lyrics the whole group could agree... I like how they talk about people who drip through the day and waste all their thoughts at night... &quot;I Know there's an answer, but i know now but I have to find it by myself...&quot; As for every other song on the CD, the background music is amazing! <br />Here Today- I love the beginning... &quot;it starts with just a little glance now, right away you're thinking about romance now, you know you outta take it slower, but you just can't wait to get to know her... a brand new love affair is a beautiful thing, but you gotta be aware of the pain it could bring&quot; It's a greatsong about love that could be here today and gone tomorrow... The background music in this song is really good, it has those nice percussion sounds that I like! &quot;Keep mind love is here, today and its gone, tomorrow its here and gone so fast&quot; They write such awesome songs, the stuff today can't mach it!<br />I Just Wasn't Made For These Times- I don't quite understand Brian's feelings for these songs. He doesn't quite feel like he fits in during those times. He doesn't think that he was made for those times and he's looking for a place where things pretty much just won't go wrong. Again, there are unique percussion sounds in this song and I have no idea what he even does to get them to sound just like that. It's sensational!<br />Pet Sounds- Another instrumental which was made to send to use for a James Bond movie, but they never sent it in and retitled it. There are more unique drum sounds and I read that they were made by drumming on two Coca Cola bottles, which is something quite unique and quite different. I love that!<br />Caroline No- This song is about how when someone loses their innocense, things seem to change and that magic about that certain person just isn't there anymore. It also expresses his wishes to go back to simpler times like when he was in high school. This song was written so that I could understand the meaning of this song really easy... I love how the beginning is, the drums sound great! They always do... I love the part &quot;Where did your long hair go, where is the girl I used to know, how could you lose that happy glow? Oh Caroline no! Who took that look away, I remember how you used to say, you'd never change, but that's true, oh Caroline you... break my heart&quot; I love this song, it was written so beautifully and it adds some things to my opinions on growing up and all this things. This song was released as a single under Brian Wilson's name because he is the only one who sang this song. There is train tracks and his dog barking at the end to make it sound good and it is the end of the CD...<br />Hang On To Your Ego- &quot;I Know There's An Answer&quot;'s &quot;twin song&quot;... It's the original version before the changed lyrics that is a bonus added to this CD. I like this song as much as &quot;I know there's an answer&quot; but it's a little different like &quot;hang on to your ego, i now you're gonna lose the fight&quot;. Very odd lyrics because I don't quite understand that part...<br />Then it goes into the rest of the tracks again only they are digitally remastered.<br />It all depends on your own personal opinion whether you prefer the Beatles' Rubber Soul or the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds. Either way, I would still listen to the CD or buy the CD to listen to it to compare it yourself and figure out which of the two you prefer. If you ask my opinion, this is the better of the two CDs, but it would be best to listen to them both and compare for yourself... Artists today are absolutely nothing like they were back when my dad was a teenager! I prefer all of the older artists to anyone today!<br />I hope this CD review helped you and I want you to get out and buy this CD!
1573221562|4.0|From the beginning, AFFINITY creates a mood of watchful caution: nothing is as it seems. Unclear whether asked to suspend belief and enter the world of the spiritual, the reader awaits the author's direction. If such a plane exists, is it real or fraudulent?<br />It is 1874 in London, at Millbrook Prison, where we meet Margaret Prior, a lady &quot;Visitor&quot; come to offer solace to the female inmates. Miss Prior has been ill, recuperating slowly since the death of her father, determined now to turn her energies on the less fortunate. Millbrook Prison is a huge ediface of gothic proportions, towers and tunnels and geometric patterns leading to the stark chill of individual cells. The greater part of each day is spent in isolation, the inmates given hand-work that they might earn their keep.<br />Almost thirty, Margaret Prior is on the threshold of spinsterhood, studious and well-intentioned. Her sister, Priscilla, is about to be wed. Then Margaret will be alone with their mother, as brother Stephen has married Margaret's former dear friend, Helen. These two women are closer in temperament and sympathy than the family ever suspects; Margaret must discipline herself at family gatherings, lest she gaze too often at Helen, or with naked longing. In her heart, she grieves deeply for this loss.<br />Miss Prior is interested in the lives of the women prisoners, their crimes, their hopes. She visits frequently and many become familiar, and each time she stops last at the cell of Selina Dawes, a spirit medium, jailed for fraud and assault. Selina seems a gentle, if lonely soul. Miss Prior is her solitary visitor, besides the spirits that whisper encouragement every evening when the lights are extinguished.<br />This is Victorian England at its apex, when women of Miss Prior's class are considered innocent and in need of comfort and protection. When Margaret forms an attachment to Selina, as of course she must, she keeps her thoughts to herself, speaking only through the pages of her diary. Margaret starts to entertain the idea that Selina may truly consort with the spirits, opening her mind to such possibilities, even as she receives her nightly sleeping draught, dreaming of Selina. The obsession appears to be mutual. Selina calls Margaret &quot;Aurora&quot;, says she is her &quot;affinity&quot;, two halves of one whole.<br />On January 20th, Miss Prior visits Selina a final time as they have chosen this night for Selina's escape. With assistance by her &quot;spirits&quot;, Selina promises to come for &quot;Aurora&quot; before the light of dawn. For her part, Margaret has made secret preparations: passports, travel arrangements, clothing, adequate funds.Whether the escape occurs, how it happens, and the consequences create the tension that brings AFFINITY to life on each page. Ms. Waters virtually beguiles the reader, leading slowly through a twisting maze, as she leads us to the ending of her masterful tale.ges of her diary.

6304288433|1.0|i know whoever is reading this review right now is probably saying that i am nuts but i tell it the way it is and the way i feel. halloween 2 ,after an awesome 1st 1, was very boring if i may say so. michael myers followed loari strode to the hospital to try to kill her and kills many more along the way. this movie may have some story line goin for it but not an entertaining film at all. its a continuation of part 1 and picks up right where the 1st 1 left off. mike got shot by dr.loomis and got up and walked away and halloween 2 started. this movie had the stupidest ending and michael's weapon of choice was a little scalple. come on now..mike, you can do better then that. from the kills to the setting to the crappy score(corney music) in part 2 this movie was all around pathetic. as much as most say this is a great movie , i say it isnt i think it is a big fat borefest..thats my story and i'm stickin to it.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|This is easily one of the best records I have brought during the last couple of years, and certainly the best I purchased in 2000. I expected to hate it for the simple fact I am not a real fan of female angst in Alanis Morrisette style, but was astonishingly surprised.<br />Fiona Apple has the most beautiful voice, and her sheer capacity to alternate styles is amazing. She can playfully hold a tune as is evident in 'Paperbag', or captivate in true ballad form in such songs as 'I know'. Of course, there is angst there, we couldn't expect anything less, but somehow it never gets old.<br />I later purhased 'Tidal' and whilst that is also a grand record, the roots of 'When the pawn..' span deeper. She is simply amazing, and think after listening to the first three songs on this album, 'Paperbag' and 'Get Gone' (my personal favourite) I have no doubt you will agree. I have yet to meet anyone who doesn't.<br />One of the best choices I have ever made in terms of album purchases!
B000056MOD|5.0|As long as you overlook the continuity aspects of the Highlander movie franchise, then this movie isn't really that bad. Personally I like all the Highlander movies-- even including Highlander 2 (the Renegade version that is), and the TV series is a classic as well. <br />Now, on to End Game: I thought it was good, but then again I'm a big fan of Highlander... some of my friends, however, really hated the movie-- they aren't fans though. Obviously they either had problems with the continuity or they plain old just don't get Highlander. Overall it was an enjoyable movie for me, and an above average one at that. So, I'd be really happy if Duncan MacLeod appeared in at least one more movie. I think they should have Amanda in it too because they have good chemistry together. And of course don't forget about Joe and Methos. If they do make 1 more movie, then they should at least resolve some of the present issues at hand-- Adrian Paul can't play the Highlander forever and niether can Elizabeth Gracen. Anyways they could always start another TV show. How about a movie that takes place in outer space or something... or how about they discover that immortals are really hybrid aliens or something (which was hinted at in Highlander 2: The Quickening)...<br />Now that Connor is dead (he'll always be THE Highlander to me), they can concentrate on one thing and not both. Hopefully, they (the producers) won't make any more conflicting storylines and characters, it would be nice to have a fresh new immortal created...
B00000G3Q4|5.0|A classic Basically this is a low budget horror. BUT it has a difference, it is superbly directed, absurdly written and purposly hammily acted. But unlike a lot of other low budget horror fare from the early eighties this one can actually be bloody creepy at times.<br />Although not as well made as Evil Dead two, and with much more annoying characters, it still stands as a VERY violent, darkly funny film.<br />Also this showed that Sam Raimi can direct, on a miniscule budget he produced some spectacular camera work, and for a cheap horror that is very odd, as usually the direction isn't always great.<br />See it if you can stomach it...END
020530902X|5.0|The Elements of Style is more than just a concisely written review of grammar and usage lessons, it is a tribute by E.B. White to the wry spirit of his former English instructor, who illustrates style and grammar lessons with droll examples and commentary:  &quot;In ordinary composition, use orthodox spelling. Do not write &quot;nite&quot; for &quot;night,&quot; &quot;thru&quot; for &quot;through,&quot; &quot;pleez for please,&quot; unless you plan to introduce a complete system of simplified spelling and are prepared to take the consequences.&quot;  This book is more in the spirit of a humorous and inspirational series of essays about writing, like Anne Lamott's &quot;Bird by Bird&quot; than it is like a grammar or style guide (except for the fact that it *is* a grammar and style guide, and an excellent, classic yet modern one).  Everyone says it's a &quot;must have&quot; for writers but more than that, buy it for its delightful brevity and wit... a refreshingly clever and intelligent style not often seen in instructional texts.
B0000039LE|5.0|halloween was probably the most popular horror movie of all time. ask almost any1 what is their favorite horror film and you will usually get the answer of halloween. 1 night a young 6 year old boy decides to kill his 16 or 17 year old sister. and gets committed to this hospital. then he escapes and goes back to his home town (haddonfield) to kill some more but really is only after 1 person in particular but kills any1 else who will dare get in his way. whats the significance of this 1 person? no1 really knows. but this killer ,michael myers, is pure evil on 2 legs and will not stop at ANY costs. do you believe in the buggy man? well after seeing this movie you might have second thoughts. halloween is a classic film that scared the daylights out of an entire nation. and will frightfully give you a good time watchin it. so sit back and be scared , cuz the buggy man is right in your tv screen. this film was such a great movie and really 1 of my favorites.
B000053GTE|5.0|Celine's All The Way A Decade of Song and Video is a collection of 17 of Celine's videos/live performances. Although not all of Celine's videos are here, it covers a wide range. From the empowering The Power of Love, to It's All Coming Back To Me Now, Im Your Angel (with R Kelly), If You Asked Me To, etc as well as her new songs in video form, like Thats The Way It Is, If Walls Could Talk, Then You Look At Me, Live, I Want You To Need Me, etc. There are various live performances, such as Beauty and the Beast (sung with one of her background singers), which I would have liked to see in original form, Because You Love Me (which I would of preferred to see as the original video), those were both taken from her 1997 Memphis concert. There is also some live performances from her 1999 All The Way Special, the songs being The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face and All The Way.<br />An added bonus is the inclusion of Misled, which didnt make it onto the CD and cassette of All The Way. My only complaint about this video collection: unnessesary live performances, replacing the original videos, and the missing videos not included on here, the songs not even on the cd/cassette such as Tell Him (with Barbra Streisand), Immortality (with the Bee Gees), Water From The Moon, etc. I didnt find All The Way to be a really complete Greatest Hits package, but maybe with The Collectors Series we will continue to see her hits appear in collections on cd. <br />This is a nice career video retrospective of Celine Dion's career. A must for fans!
6305841861|5.0|A sequel equal to or better than the original!? Well, to be fair this is just a much a remake as it is a sequel. When I say remake, they tweeked the first of the first, geefully ignored it, and added some blantant comedy.<br />And it works.<br />Bruce Campbell and his girlfriend again head out to a remote cabin in the woods and mistakenly awake evil that is out to get them. <br />This is a superb example of horror-comedy. It isn't over the line to become unintentionally stupid and still packs some scares. It's not as violent as the first (it's kinda hard to upstage a woman being raped by a tree), and it's easier to take since it's being played for laughs.<br />I can't quite recommend it to everyone because some are sure to be unrightfully offended or grossed out by the film. But to me, this film is just great fun, easily amongst my favorites.
B00000FZ1V|5.0|&quot;Ghostbusters&quot; was one of my favorite films growing up, and it still holds a special place in my heart today. And in addition to that, it's a really great movie; possibly one of the funniest comedies of all time.       <br />&quot;Ghostbusters&quot; is the tale of Dr. Venkman, Dr. Stantz, and Dr. Spengler, (Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd and Harold Ramis)who all are researchers of paranormal psychology at a university in New York. When the university downsizes, they are let go, and are forced out onto the street to fend for themselves. So, what do they do? They start a &quot;ghost-busting&quot; business in New York City. What's so great about this movie obviously isn't the story, it's the characters. Our three heros are so compatible and play off of eachother so well, that I'd watch them doing almost anything. The film also stars Sigourney Weaver and Rick Moranis.      <br />The DVD of &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; is truly exsquisite and one of greatest DVD's out there. Among many special features are theatrical trailers for &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, &quot;Ghostbusters 2&quot;, &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; and &quot;Stripes&quot;. The DVD also includes about three documentries: One from 1999, one from when the film was first released and one just about the special effects. All three are very informative and interesting, running at about ten minutes a piece, give or take. Another great feature on this DVD is the scene-to-storyboard comparison. The scene that this feature highlights is the scene in which Murray, Akroyd and Ramis persue, and are persued by the ghost eventually to be named &quot;Slimer&quot; in the hotel. This comparison is quite interesting. The best overall feature on this DVD though, has to be the feature-length commentary by actor/co-writer, Harold Ramis; director/producer, Ivan Reitman; and Joe Medjuck, the associate producer of the film. Besdies being funny and informative, what's so special about this commentary is that the silhouettes of the three commentators can be seen at the bottom of the screen (optionally), much like &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000.&quot; Other features include ten, fun deleted scenes, conceptual drawings and a trivia section. The animated menus are great too!   <br />This is a great movie and a great DVD, especially for a Bill Murray fan. This is an essential for any DVD collector.
B0000508U6|1.0|COLDPLAY is like a less energetic version of Oasis, with yodeling thrown in. Maybe I'm too tainted or bitter to give it it's due, but PARACHUTE is just a step away from STING singing on that lame Jaguar TV commercial. Sure, the lead singer's heart is broken, but it comes across like an After School Special when compared to TREMBLING BLUE STARS or PEDRO THE LION. This album is so inoffensive and milquetoast, I'd consider giving my copy to my 55 year old mother, who'd easily enjoy it more than I would.<br />Don't fall victim to the hype...Coldplay is a weak, mushy bore. If you like Julia Roberts movies, this CD is probably for you.
6305827079|5.0|This has to be the greatest video I have ever seen and I have loads of them!  What I especially like was the fact that more time was given to performances and actual &quot;Elvis&quot; time, and less to interviewing screaming fans who just say &quot;I love him, I love him&quot; that is in so many of the other tapes.  I loved him, too, but would much rather the time be spent on him than talking to fans if I'm going to watch a video about Elvis.  To me, though this was much more personal insight into what went on at rehearsals and before and after performances.  I felt like I was at a concert, which unfortunately I never got to see live. Thanks so much for making this video available; it was on a cable channel, but not on our cable carrier.  I was so devastated because I wasn't going to get to view it; then a friend found it here on Amazon.com and I snapped it up immediately.  I'm really glad I did - I love it!
B000056N8X|1.0|what where they thinking when they made this movie. it completely ignores the movies, and the characters are weakly portrayed. the villian was horrible, the broad was a bad actress, and worst of all it didn't even have the music the 1st movie and the tv series did which added the great atmosphere to those. the only redeeming quality is that you get to see connor, duncan, methos, and joe again. Any of the two or three parter tv series episodes would have made better movies than this. this is just weak i expected more out of this movie. so you should rent this movie instead of making my mistake and buying it!
B00003CXBK|5.0|First off I would like to address an issue many people have with Japanese Animation. Much of it is trashy, silly, sexually overt rubbish targeting sexually deprived teenage males. I can see why many people steer clear from anything classified as anime. I urge any potential view with these concerns to open your mind and watch this film.<br />If I could only recommend one Japanese animated film this would definately be it. Hayao Miyazaki is often referred to as the Japanese Walt Disney. If you see his other films (which are all excellent) you can see why, however this film does not fit that role.<br />Princess Mononoke despite it's fairy-tale-like sounding name is definately not targeting a younger audience. This movie is for adults. While some of the scenes may be a little to strong for children, that's not to say there is anything lewd or obcene in the film, but the story is a drama written for the adult mindset.<br />I was fortunate enough to see this film in the theatres where I was left amazed and speechless as the credits rolled up. This movie is simply fantastic. If you are speculative, I urge you to rent a copy at your nearest video store and watch it with your full attention. Then come back here to write your own review as you place your order for your own copy.
B00004TDRD|4.0|Jaws is one of the best known movies of our time. It was once the highest money maker, too. And still, after 25 years, everybody knows its name. It has become a classic film that will be associated with film-making forever. Despite its mediocre special effects--mainly the shark--the film is still very impressive. I have seen it many times, and bought it as soon as the 25th Anniversary Edition was released. The film looks great and the sound is amazing. Also, there is a second tape filled with interviews with Peter Benchley--the author of the book--Steven Spielberg, and a lot of actors who worked on the film. <br />I won't go into the plot because everybody knows the film. But if you haven't gotten it yet, pick up the new edition. It may cost you a little more, but it's well worth it. There are deleted scenes and bloopers, and they're all quite funny. <br />But I would like to issue one warning. When this film was released, there was no PG-13 label, therefore it is rated PG. However, compared to movies made today, this is more like a  PG-13 film. There is some violence, language and plenty of blood.
068484267X|5.0|This is in my opinion the best book ever. It sows the true essence of poverty in the home of Irish-Catholics. Frank McCourt has outdone himself beyond the beyonds. This book has deeply touched me and is the only memoir i have ever read that i can actually say i won't forget. I recommend this book only if you can handle depression. It made me cry quite a few times, and if you can't handle that, then i don't recommend this book. I Commend Frank McCourt for his WONDEFUL addition to my home library.

B000000OEI|5.0|Watch this movie... LOUD! Pay attention to how the musical score really carries the emotions of this film.<br />In a day where most film score try to be subtle and hide in the background, Hans Zimmers score melds with Tony Scott's film like two lovers having foreplay continually staying on the brink of climax. But the climaxes do come, and when they do they are very satisfying.<br />I'm a bit disappointed by some of the reviews this CD has received. Have people forgotten that this music was written to accompany a film? I hear complaints that the tracks are too long or that there is dead(?) time in the composition. Hans Zimmer certainly didn't write this score to appease an MTV audience. If you need something with constant movement and don't understand the point of the ambient parts in a piece like this, I have some really good Trance CD's I could recommend to you.<br />If you are the kind of person who likes to listen to a score away from the film or appreciate classical orchestration in general I cannot recommend this CD enough. This is one of the best examples of Hanz Zimmer's work (and he has many great examples; also see the scores for Backdraft and Gladiator). If you call yourself a Hans Zimmer fan, you aren't until you have this CD.
0195067142|5.0|This is a very good book. Why ? Because it is an honest account of the transition of everyday young men into those men who can do the toughest jobs that their nation requires of them.<br />&quot;Sledgehammer&quot; to his buddies, tells of the good and mainly bad times of the First Marine Division. Mud, constant risk, brilliant officers and idiot officers, support between small groups to achieve a larger objective - it's all in this book.<br />I suspect in spite of all the horror, he has left some out as just sometimes you can see how some of his leaders are so stupid in their orders (when he knows the impending disasterous result from previous failures) that more expedient short cuts were applied.<br />You feel for these guys by the end of their 62 days of constant rain, mud, digging foxholes to find rotting corpses at the bottom of the hole, and hidden, constant and deadly Jap fire on Okinawa (and over 20,000 casualties) when some rear echelon officer orders them to collect all the brass shellcases and bury the dead Japs.<br />Get a copy, read it and get as many others to read this as possible. Then we will continue to appreciate the debt we owe these guys.
B000001GLK|5.0|It's beauty, and strong. The strong thing is not his physical aspect, that is in the mental and moral space in his music. How can strong boy look beauty? It's his magical talents.  At first time, I could not perceive his deeper expression, but as time has passed, I could get that. It's a real music and remarkable talent. If I didn't meet Beethoven's his concerto for Piano, I probably would not be aware of one of the Beethoven's masterpiece. I Really want to put this Pollii's great teasure in my mind forever. I actually felt the magic of this music and want to share it. Therefore I recommend this one as one of the Beethoben's Greatest Piano concertos.  Thank you, And God bless you all who listen to this one...
B000002GQE|5.0|One thing has to be said- each singing member contributes two songs each, and they are all VERY GOOD pop tunes. Individually each songs stands up- they are really hard Not to like- and the lyrics are quite good- a feature of this groups first batch of records. Listen to the lyrics of Ray Thomas's &quot;Twilight Time&quot; or  &quot;Another Morning&quot;, Pinder's &quot;Dawn Is a Feeling&quot;, and Hayward's &quot;Tuesday Afternoon.&quot; The lyrics matched with the music evoke a mood, present a statement or message, and are impossible to forget. The arrangements are innovative, example- &quot;Nights&quot; with a superb arrangement highlighted with an unforgettable-there's that word again-flute solo. And all the songs are braced with a nice rock foundation of drums, bass and the all important 60's instrument- the tambourine. Four lead singers, featured solo or in group vocal accompaniment, not unlike the great American band-a contemporary of the Moodies at the time-the Byrds. What else can one say-all the hallmarks of a great rock band. Of course one would wish the CD programming allowed one to skip right to the songs, wrapped as they are by orchestral arrangements of the songs. But that's just griping. Note- Try to find the 45 version of Nights. The deleted &quot;Voices in the Sky&quot; CD had it and it is far superior to the album version. The original 45's flipside was &quot;Cities&quot; in superb mono sound- far superior and actually quite &quot;spooky&quot; compared to the stereo mix found elsewhere.
B000001GLK|5.0|It's too beautiful. His music has been beautiful, now it's graet. At first time, I was very disappointed by his light touches in No.3 of Beethoven, but I soon perceived his real truth. He drew the big thing, not small thing, and I didn't get the great one. I want to put this historical treasure in my brain forever. As Pollini exists in my mind, I can enjoy the life with music. I really recommend this one as one of the best to you woh like music.
B000002GQG|5.0|A friend of my older brother had this record in 1968 and I briefly remember examing the cover and the yantra. I didn't have a chance to hear it as &quot;Switched on Bach&quot; was being played on the hi-fi, and I was heading out the door. Then in 1970 when I heard &quot;Question&quot; on the radio, which I immediately liked, they mentioned the group was the Moody Blues. I knew then that I had to buy their records. Out of the 4 Moody Blues in the record bin, &quot;Lost Chord&quot; had the wildest cover, and I was, of course, &quot;familiar&quot; with it. In what would become a ritual I waited until evening and laid on the floor with headphones on for a test spin. What occurred was pretty memorable- after &quot;Departing&quot; I immediately recognized &quot;See-Saw&quot; had been played by our late night AM radio jockey, Roy Cooper. This was when AM DJs were allowed to make they own playlists. I never knew the title, and hearing this on my record was akin to finding some lost jewel or something. Then &quot;Legend&quot; came on and again-deja vu- I heard this on our FM radio station, as well as on a local TV car commercial advertising custom paisley car tops of all things. When &quot;Travel&quot; came on-another FM favorite-I just couldn't believe that all these great songs had come from the same group! I was pretty impressed. The sequencing was pretty smart. One side had two of the four vocalists highlighted, and side two seemed to say-you haven't seen nothing yet-here's Justin Hayward. And to start side 2 with &quot;Voices In the Sky&quot; was just superb programming. Troughout the album all members are treated as equals-but I can't help noticing Haywards nice 12 string work. Sure the sleeve is 1/5 the size it used to be, and the Yantra isn't included anymore, but thats what used record stores are for. 30 years later I still get a charge out of this record.

0517122707|5.0|&quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; is not even questionably the greatest novel ever written in the realm of comedy. It's not an attempt at greatness, not a shingle thrown at the moon - it's the kind of thing that you read and have this tremendous pang. This sadness that you never get in a book - you know it has to end at some point and that's by far the worst realization. The only bad thing here is that it ends at all.<br />What JK Toole accomplished here is beyond reason. What's worse is that you read it and know the pain he had in not seeing it heralded in every bookstore in his lifetime. Toole's rash and sad decision to end his own life is the best argument against suicide I know of. This man was a genius beyond anything we have now. He lacked the faith and certainty of that. The result is that we were robbed of such a possible body of work that the world will never know. The only close comparison is that of Keats whose &quot;name writ in water&quot; was a tragedy to a literate generation of his time. As gigantic and lush as &quot;Confederacy..&quot; is you never put that aside.<br />That said, this is a Sheherazade of a tale. I suspect that Toole had no idea what he was planning for Ignatius, but that he wrote it as he found it. And what a formula. From the Big Chief tablets to the hot dog cart this is a book that has no equal. It sits in my bathroom rack of books and I just pick it up and read a page and laugh. It's THAT good. Every page is a mystery of writing skill, Toole's characters are vibrant and fully alive always, none resembling the other and they sing when they get going which is immediately.<br />Reading this means you will never be the same. &quot;The Night of Joy&quot; bar will be a place you want to get a drink, Constantinople a word you actually use. More than anything, you'll be lucky. There's not a thing like this book - nothing even close. Oddly I just read Jon Stewart's &quot;Naked Pictures of Famous People&quot; which was heralded on cover and by friends as &quot;hilarious.&quot; Please. I don't know how he made a career.... Idiocy in the aught years is heralded as funny. Not likely.<br />Read this book and realize how we have since the late 1950's when this was written, devolved into a true &quot;Confederacy of Dunces&quot;. The book means more today than it ever did.and by friends as &quot;hilarious.&quot; Please. I don't know how he made a career.... Idiocy in the aught years is heralded as funny.

B000001Y42|1.0|After buying Significant Other and loving it, I was eager for more, so I bought this. This album is a lot different than their other two albums. To a guy who is into rock for the most part, this album is basically a lot of distortion and yelling. The only song on this album that I like is &quot;Faith&quot;, I'm embarrassed to say. I'm not a wussy Guster fan; I liked every single track on Significant Other. The music on this album is simply different than the newer stuff.
B000006TRV|5.0|I've heard them all - the songs are weak, the good ones are few and far between, the storyline is incoherent, it was good to listen to when one is 12, etc. It is only after listening to The Wall over many years that one can appreciate it's true message - one that is cynical, dark and brutal. <br />The Wall is not totally dissociated from The Who's Tommy. Both are rock operas that are darkly thematic. If the good songs are few and far between in the Wall, then this case is exacerbated in Tommy, where we only see the occasional flashes of brilliance. Both stories are equally coherent (or perhaps incoherent) and both are equally ambitious. However, The Wall is lyrically and musically superior, with infinitely better production values. And you can thanks Roger Waters (and Dave Gilmour) for that. <br />Enjoy the Wall for what it is, not for what you want it to be.
B000031XBQ|5.0|Don't get me wrong--I really like them. The music and the vocals are mostly superlative. But there is one problem with Abba that may have effected their popularity in the United States: dumb lyrics and concepts for songs (I refuse to see &quot;Mama Mia&quot; -- it looks kitsch, from the TV ads. Also, it isn't sung by Agnetha or Frida, so what's the point?) So, I recommend this album to anyone who doesn't speak Spanish.  That way, you can just listen to the music, and not be bothered with childish rhymes like: &quot;See that girl, watch that scene, dig in the Dancing Queen&quot;.
0804115613|4.0|This was an excellent read!  In 1985 two women meet and develop a frienship. Through this friendship, Ninny Threadgood takes Evelyn Couch on a journey of past times. Ninny, a woman in her eighties, and Evelyn, a middleaged woman, meet often in a nursing home to share treats and conversation.  Ninny spins the tale of her home town and it's inhabitants.  She tells stories of love and hurt, happiness and hardships.  Evelyn who feels lost and uncertain embraces Ninny and the Whistle Stop adventures.  The journey is equally important to both women. It allows Ninny to remember and embrace the past and aids Evelyn in creating her future.  <br />The tale is of an old railway town and it's cast of characters.  The reader will be swept away into the lives of those that live in Whistle Stop and surrounding area's.  This a very funny and touching novel.  We witness and experience many hilarious antics and corageous acts of love.  Flagg does an excellent job at creating realistic characters with much depth and dimension.<br />I am so glad that I discovered Fannie Flagg!  I highly recommend this book!
B000056MOD|2.0|I saw this movie at the theater when it came out, and I also rented it as soon as I found out it was available to rent. I am a big fan of Highlander, but this movie left a lot to be desired. I would rate it about the same as the original version of Highlander 2. First of all, I hate it when the legends are distorted or overlooked to make a movie. Am I the only person who realizes that it was shown in the series that Duncan was never married? When he asked Tess to marry him he flashed back to a time when he remembered being told he would love many women, but never take a wife. I remeber it well as it was in the episode where Tess was killed. As for the &quot;new&quot; ending for the video release of this movie, I thought it was just as bad a the theatrical version. If, and hopefully when another Highlander film is made, this just leave another storyline which will be forgotten or changed. If history repeats, the next film will be a great movie. Look at it from this point of view, the first film was wonderfull, the second (well, you know), then Final Dimension was a great movie, and now End Game(again, you know). In all honesty, I will purchase this move as soon as it is reduced in price to go with my collection, but as I say , it will not be one of my favorites. I am a true Highlnder fanatic, so I hope you apreciate my honesty.
B0000026J6|3.0|With the windows open and sunglasses on, this is enjoyable music.  Cohen's deep voice and simple arrangements are good for autopilot cruises but they don't hold up as well under scrutiny.  Some of the ballads are just a bit too simplistic, he hits a few vocal clinkers and the lyrics are occasionally trite.  Nevertheless, this is good music to be alone with your thoughts to or just to watch the scenery fly by ...

0440224764|5.0|This is a book about a lawyer who pretends to die in a car fire.  He takes someone's already dead body and replaces it for his and runs away.  He watches his funeral from a tree and then steals 90 million dollars from his firm.  He had just learned that the firm was ripping off other companies and their total revenue from it was exactly 90 million dollars.  So pretty much the lawyer was taking stolen money.  He ran off to Brazil, with a new identity and a new life.  He had lost over 100 pounds, and had a different name and spoke almost perfect Portuguese.  It was hard to find him but they did it.  Unfortunatly, the group secretly hired by the lawyer's firm found him first and almost tortured him to death.  The FBI interfered and Patrick, the lawyer survived.  He had major burns from the electricity on his chest and thighs.  Patrick had given away the name of the woman who controlled his money, and now all they had to do was find her.  It was quickly known that she had skipped town.  They spent extra money to find her, but they never did.  This story has many more twists and turns that you could have never expected.  There are mutiple double-crosses and unexpected angles on something new.<br />  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes mysteries, and anything with non-stopping action.  In this book it is impossible to guess what happens next.  It is just so interesting to see all the different twists that the story unfolds as it goes on.  You might expect a perilous ending, yet he ends up without  a sentence at all.  Everyone get out here and read this book!

It makes a wonderful gift to that someone special.<br />Incidentally, I would wholeheartedly recommend anyone who has never been to Mackinac (pronounced MACK-a-naw) Island to see it firsthand. Venture away from the fudge shops to see why Mackinac Island is one of the more popular romantic getaway destinations. It's a truly memorable experience.
B000002G7E|5.0|This album is bizarrely addictive, and the kind of records that one wishes more bands had the gumption to attempt.  Everything on here sounds like it was recorded according to the rigorous &quot;whatever we feel like&quot; regimen, and that works more than it doesn't. I even think &quot;The Gift&quot; would make for a neat video if any band dared cover it (and if MTV2 dared show an eight-minute video). And &quot;Sister Ray&quot; is a delightful descent into noise lunacy that never comes close to boring. It's practically a live track.  The one sadness is knowing that this is the last album recorded with John Cale, and that from then on the band would inevitably on towards a pointlessly commercial sound.  Poor Velvets. They saw the Promised Land, but...
0385335482|5.0|Writing a truly humorous novel is, I have to believe, very difficult to pull off. Heaven knows, I've been disappointed often enough. CONFESSIONS OF A SHOPAHOLIC, by Sophie Kinsella, is a rare gem.<br />Rebecca Bloomwood is a single, twenty-something English lass with a serious problem. She shops beyond her means with a vengeance, blithely ignoring, sometimes discarding unread, the concerned letters from credit card issuers requesting payment. (The demands are very genteel, of course. Her creditors are British, after all.) Yet, she'll go into a panic at the prospect of losing the opportunity to buy a $540 designer scarf at two-thirds off. Ironically, Becky is also a financial journalist for the magazine \\"Successful Saving\\" - she advises readers on strategies for increasing their personal nest eggs.<br />Becky has every good intention of paying her debts, though spending an additional $300 in a single day on Stuff is not extraordinary. The fun of this book is watching her escape from impossible situations, or hemorrhage money, despite every scheme she devises to either save or earn more income. Between chuckles, you just want to slap her out of exasperation - for her own good. Two examples ...<br />Determined not to spend a Saturday on frivolous shopping, she decides to visit London's Victoria and Albert Museum, admission for which she thinks is free. (Save money and absorb culture, all in one go.) Unexpectedly faced with an $8 entrance fee, she purchases the $24 season ticket. Then, after trudging between exhibits, which, disappointingly, have no price tags attached, she discovers ... the Museum Gift Shop.<br />Hoping to land a banking position in the City, she sends off a suitably embellished CV to a high-powered head-hunting firm. So impressed is the agency with her professed abilities, including a totally fictional fluency in Finnish, that its representative, unbeknownst to Becky, arranges an on-the-spot and surprise meeting between her and the recruitment director for the Bank of Helsinki. (\\"I can't wait to hear the two of you talking away in Finnish,\\" chirps the rep.)<br />This book is particularly delightful because Becky is so endearing. OK, so she rationalizes away reality, and is shallow, immature and irresponsible. However, she's not a bad, malicious person, nor is she hard-core dishonest. She's actually quite pleasant - a most agreeable person with whom to spend the day ... well, shopping. For these reasons, I rooted for her all the way to the end, at which time my faith in her essential goodness was justified. You go, girl!r for the Bank of Helsinki.

6300271285|4.0|Having recently watched this musical remake of Little Shop of Horrors, my curiosity about its genesis lead me to its progenitor.  I hadn't realised that Roger Corman's original was intended as a comedy, but indeed it is a study in absurdity, all fully intended.  It is impossible to say whether the more recent version or the original is &quot;better&quot;--they are simply different, and each amusing in its own way.  I prefered Rick Moranis's Seymour to that of Jonathan Haze, but Jackie Joseph's Audrey had funnier lines and was less pathetic than Ellen Greene's, whose voice almost had me climbing the walls.  What really surprised me was that the comic touches I had thought were signatures of the Saturday Night Live/Second City crowd were all in the original: the sadistic dentist and his masochistic patient; &quot;Pain&quot; magazine, &quot;Feed me!&quot;, and more.  Futhermore, the original had other absurd characters and scenes that didn't make it into the remake, including Seymour's mother, a hypochondriac whose home cooking is all flavoured with medicine, and a parody of Joe Friday from Dragnet.  But Audrey II, in his technicolor, Muppet-y greatness, is much more a sassy, commanding presence in the all-singing 80's version.  Steve Martin's role as the sadistic dentist was considerably expanded, and to great effect.  Both Bill Murray and Jack Nicholson were equally good as the masochistic dental patient. And even though Fred Katz's score in the original was noteworthy, the songs by Ashman and Menkin (these are the guys who later gave us the songs to Disney's The Little Mermaid!) in the remake are terrific.  My favorite is the suspenseful &quot;Suppertime.&quot;  My only quibble was that I had some trouble making out all the words to the songs.  Howard Ashman is a great lyricist and so it's a real shame.  Otherwise, I enjoyed both Little Shops, as did my entire family, and we recommend them both for your viewing pleasure.
B00003CX8J|5.0|&quot;X-Men&quot; is a Great Movie (4 Stars) made even Better (5 Stars) by this Brilliant Special Edition DVD. The Extras are to Die For, (deleted scenes that you can insert into the film, Hugh Jackmans screen test and a making of that isn't just an extended Trailer) and the Box is one of the Greatest Ever Made. (tied with &quot;Fight Club&quot; which is also a Fox release)<br />Aussie Hugh Jackman assures his International Success with his Wolferine, a Leader and a Loner, Tough and Vulnerable, he conveys it all. For a film about a comic book, that is alot of Character Development. The Rest of the Cast are also Great and they Embody their roles wonderfully. Bryan Singers Direction is Suitably Good and he sets up a Sequal well by leaving alot of Unanswered Questions.<br />A Franchise is assured after this ones Box Office Takings.
B000058T5E|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I have followed Jeff from the days of the Tridents through to &quot;Who Else.&quot;  Jeff, who looks younger than ever, is becoming quite prolific in his old age.  Jeff released &quot;There And Back&quot; in 1980 and then kept us all waiting some 6 or 7 years for his return to form.  His true return to form did not happen until the release of &quot;Who Else.&quot;<br />Jeff has done the whole fusion thing and needs to reinvent himself again.  I think Jeff is quite complacent fixing his old hot rods these days and does not see a reason to &quot;mess&quot; with the formula.<br />Jeff works best when you feel he is about to go off the edge and make a major mistake - which he rarely ever does.  Jeff is the king of all British guitarists.  I miss the Jeff of old and especially the Yardbirds days; the last time Jeff really showed what he was capable of doing in a short tasteful solo.<br />I have already rushed out and added this to my Jeff collection.  How about a few bars of &quot;High Ho Silver Lining then Jeff?&quot;
B00004Z4WR|4.0|The Preview shows Cars, The Preview Shows Action, The Preview Shows Laughs, We Get All Of That, and Still.. People Complain. This film is about Good, Uncomplicated Fun, like Virtually all of Jerry Bruckheimers films, and I loved Every Minute of it.<br />Nicolas Cage is as Good as Ever as Randell &quot;Memphis&quot; Raines, as Ex Car Thief forced out of Retirement to save his brothers life. Angelina Jolie is a Little Underused as Sway, Nicks Love Interest, she looks great and Smiles alot, so she has performed her service. Another Bruckheimer Trademark is a Supporting cast to die for. Here is No Exception. Click on the &quot;Cast List&quot; button and prepared to be blown away by big names.<br />There is More fist and Gun Action than I expected and Less Car Action than I expected, but that suits me fine, as I prefer Fist and Gun Action. Everything Technical About the film also Clicks. It is a Perfectly Polished film in every way, plus a Hell-of-alot of Fun.
B000002546|5.0|This CD blew me away 25 years ago, and still does today.  Despite the number of 'guitar heroes' (whom all of which I admire very much) out there, 'Blow by Blow' was THE one to get the guitar-rock-fusion thing going. <br />This CD is FAR from dated - it has hooks, jumps, jams and all sorts of other stuff to put it ahead of the pack.  Beck, already a 'classic guitarist', outdid himself on this one.  The variety of tones and intensity on all the compositions are awesome.  'Freeway Jam' is a classic, as well as the mellow 'Cause we ended as Lovers' - just these 2 are worth price of admission.  'Scatterbrain' and the other gems on 'Side 1' displays Beck's ability to make his way around a guitar like no guitarist could...<br />This has to be one in your collection if you are a 'guitar-rock' fan (eg Satriani, Vai).  Even if you are not, this CD would appeal to the non 'guitar-rock-music' fanatic...

What More could one ask from a Monster Movie.

B000001FS3|5.0|I  can hear Then Joshua Tree 1000 times a day, This is the best album ever! Just hear 'Red hill mining town' and you'll see that you gotta buy the album...! This album pushed U2 to the edge of the hall fame of music of the music...! Don't have it? Buy it!
B000002J2B|4.0|25 years later, this CD still captures the magic of Genesis at that time.  Like others noted, this is Bank's fave, and I can see why.  The beauty of this disk is the maturation of the progressive sound they were honing in the Foxtrot and Lamb days.  There is not the quirky shifts in tempo and mood that the early Genesis displayed (don't get me wrong - I LOVE that stuff!), but a more 'evenly'  constructed set of music.  When I first heard 'your own special way', I thought that Genesis might be 'blessed' with their first 'radio-friendly' song - something I am not sure if they wanted, but here it was for the picking.  <br />At a time when prog-rock was being overshadowed by punk and southern rock, this was a hard sell!  Either way, the overall flow of this CD is really one of their best post-Gabriel-and-we-are-still-progressive moments.  As much as I love 'Trick of the Tail', I feel that this has more depth in the pure 'progressive CD' sense.  'Trick' really focused more on the songwriting that the music that went behind it. 'Wind' kind of wavers ('wuthers?') between the pure instrumental aspect of Genesis with a generous sprinkling of solid songwriting - more akin to 'Selling England by the Pound'.<br />Any fan of the pre-pop Genesis will love this CD, and due to the fact that some of their more 'accessible' songs are here as well (Your own special way, Afterglow), even a Genesis newbie will get some enjoyment out of these classics in spite of the other compositions that take some 'getting used to' (especially if your first Genesis CD was 'abacab' or 'Duke').  Not a CD to be panned, or missed!
B0000214F0|5.0|I love this movie maybe even more then Gladiator.I think Peter Otool and Mcdowell both out did them self's here.
6300214044|5.0|I've always thought that cinema is supposed to provoke, challenge, disturb, and otherwise shake us from our mundane little lives.  No film does this better than &quot;The Elephant Man,&quot; one of the masterworks of modern cinema.  There are maybe a handful of films (and I've seen thousands) that I can honestly say are without flaws - this is one of them.  Why &quot;EM&quot; didn't win the best picture Oscar is beyond me.  Likewise, why John Hurt and David Lynch didn't win their respective Oscars is beyond me.  But the Academy wouldn't know a good film if it tripped over one.<br />Anyway, &quot;EM&quot; is profoundly moving, elegantly photographed, and rich with remarkable performances.  Rarely do movies elicit a lump of emotion in my throat, let alone tears.  This film managed to do both, and on more than one occasion.  I wouldn't expect today's film-going public to appreciate &quot;EM.&quot;  Not enough car chases or explosions for most people.  And Jim Carrey's not in it.  But those of us left who still appreciate film as ART, or appreciate the stunning power of a truly great performance, or the splendid touch of a truly great director, need look no further than &quot;EM.&quot;  It is one for the ages.
B00000K31Q|4.0|As far as teen movies go, this is one of the best. Julia Stiles is sassy and smart as Kat, although the writers have set her up with some akward dialouge, and she comes off sounding a bit affected. Larisa Oleynik is perfectly cast as the too- cute Bianca. Her tounge-in-cheek perfectness adds a lot to the story. Heath Ledger, a personal favorite of mine, is funny as the 'bad boy' Patrick Verona, a part which Ledger makes the best of, dispite it's limited range and convenient and unexplained transformation in to a 'good boy' about halfway through. The rest of the cast (Andrew Keagan, Joseph Gordon-Leavitt) are effective in their roles. All in all, a pretty good movie.
B000008H1U|5.0|While I do not place &quot;Crest&quot; in the list of my top 5 Tull albums, I do think it falls somewhere comfortably in 6th or 7th place.  Considering Tull's huge output, that's really saying something.  Basically, &quot;Crest&quot; was a nice recovery from the miscalculation of &quot;Under Wraps&quot; and features some of the band's finest instrumental interludes, melodies, and poetry.  While I am not a big fan of drum machines (and this album is loaded with them), I still think &quot;Crest&quot; manages to maintain a warm, human sound that is greatly enhanced by Ian's deep, gruff voice.  And yes, it does feature one of Tull's greatest songs in &quot;Farm on the Freeway.&quot;  Powerfully executed, with a devastating middle instrumental section, &quot;Farm&quot; stands with the best of Tull's classic tunes.  &quot;Budapest&quot; is another wondrous piece, and &quot;Said She was a Dancer&quot; features a particularly memorable and heartfelt melody and a resounding poignancy and sadness.<br />I've seen many Grammy shows with various music industry-types bemoaning the fact that Crest won the 1989 Grammy for best hard rock/metal album.  Taken purely on artistic merits, it was indeed the best hard rock album of the year, far superior to even Metallica's heavily-favored &quot;...And Justice For All.&quot;  So Grammy folks, quit whining and suck up to the fact that you got your butts whipped by the one and only Jethro Tull.
B00004RHZU|5.0|I never thought that I would be a real huge pink fan until I got this CD.  I couldn't believe how much I loved it.  She is an awesome artist and everyone should listen to this CD its the best.  The lyrics are great and the messages are even better.
B00003Q438|5.0|I enjoyed the original theatrical release, but always felt the plot needed some filling in.  (who would have thought some idiot editor would cut critical information, dialog?)This DVD included 28 minutes left out the of theatrical release, totally changes the whole movie.

B000056N8X|2.0|A glorified TV episode with a few special effects.  Potential was there to really crank it up but they just fall short.  One would think that after 400 years you would amass a wealth of knowledge and talent.  Speak many languages, blend into different customs.  They should have done this on multiple locations with different fighting styles of different cultures.  Guess I should start writing my own scripts.  Buy something else.

I'd recommend it to anyone who likes a good mystery book.
B000002LUB|3.0|Dehumanizer actually sounds like a Black Sabbath record, not like a bunch of guys backing Ronnie Dio, my least favorite Sabbath vocalist. Geezer Butler can catually be heard playing something on this one, and the sound is a good 90's update while still retaining the Sabb integrity.You might ask why is this better than 'Heaven And Hell'? Well, all of side two were throwaways on that one. 'Mob Rules'? Half baked followup to a mediocre one sided album.'Live Evil' The little troll one destroys the Ozzy classics,proves he's the most annoying front man alive, and even Ian Gillan could and did sing those songs and &quot;Heaven And Hell&quot; better live( I have a concert recording to prove it!!!), despite being a part of a travesty like 'Born Again'. Not classic, but better than any other post Ozzy effort.
B000058T5E|5.0|As daring as &quot;Happenings Ten Years Time Ago&quot; in 1966, &quot;Truth&quot; in 68, &quot;Blow by Blow&quot; in the 70's and &quot;Guitar Shop&quot; in the 90's, &quot;You had it coming&quot; is once again a bold breakthrough. Jeff is as bright, fast, creative and melodious as ever and this time goes beyond with a &quot;style&quot; that I can only recognize as classic. He finds new moods, colors and passages that happily makes me feel that we will have more of his music to come, with that same aura of urban soulfulness, passion and perfection that once characterized him with The Yardbirds and then on everything he's done. On You had it coming, he plays at last his own material and includes the most extraordinaire version of rolling and tumblin' ever. I once thought that he should join Jimmy Page to try to ignite  those virtuoso days of old again. After &quot;Who else&quot; and &quot;You had it coming&quot;, the surprising consequence, I don't think Jimmy Page could be a match anymore. I could see Jeff on the two dates he gave in the Warfield in San Francisco and I don't have words to describe the easyness and absolute control he displays with his incredible talent. God save Jeff Beck for a long, long time.
B000002UJQ|5.0|OK Computer epitomizes perfectly the feeling of dislocation that many people feel (felt) during the turn of the century and even now.  It has obvious precedents with the grandiose albums of the 70's, but far surpasses them.  The album it is most compared with is &quot;Dark side of the moon&quot; by Pink Floyd, but the music, lyrics, and especially the singing are far superior.  There is no self-indulgent David Gilmour fret-wankery involved, Jonny Greenwood keeps his guitar playing at a textural level only,which gives the album a stark immediacy, and Thom Yorke's lyrical anxieties are far superior to his previous and subsequent work.

The buggers want to destroy the earth and almost did the last time they attacked. So Ender is pulled off to battle school to be trained to fight in the army against the buggers. Card describes everything in such detail that even though it's written in third person, you still feel like you're experiencing everything with Ender, feeling his feelings. Everything in battle school seems so real even though it's just a fantasy to us. Meanwhile, while Ender is at battle school, his brother and sister or working on a 'project' of their  own. When you finish Ender's Game you woun't be able to wait to read the next book.
B00003CXN4|5.0|To say that this is a film with a message would be an understatement, because it comes across so emphatically clear and succinct, and it is this:  To wage a war against drugs, you must first come to terms with the sobering fact that the enemy is often a member of your own family; and how do you wage a war against your own family?  A sobering message?  Insightful?  Indeed.  And, when you consider the implications of it all, devastating.  Ponder that awhile and you'll begin to get a sense of the futility visited upon those who would attempt to rectify a situation that affects practically everyone everywhere sooner or later, either directly or indirectly; and it is just that situation that is addressed and presented with no-holds-barred by director Steven Soderbergh in his brilliant, hard hitting film, \\"Traffic,\\" starring Michael Douglas and Benicio Del Toro.  The film examines the trafficking of drugs between Mexico and the United States, and the long-ranging effects thereof; and Soderbergh tells the story through a number of perspectives, which effectively presents the \\"big picture\\" of the drug trade and the subsequent impact it all has on the lives of so many people.  <br /> Probably the most telling perspective in terms of futility is that which is shown through the eyes of Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas), a judge who is appointed the country's \\"Drug Czar,\\" and given the task of \\"making a difference.\\"  It's a pivotal character inasmuch as it is through his involvement that so much information is presented, not all of which is anything new, but when taken within the context of the story has a tremendous emotional impact.  Through Wakefield, not only is the unbelievably far-reaching problem of illegal drugs illuminated, but the attitudes of all of those it touches on all levels, from the heads of the Mexican cartels to the kids who use and abuse the product made so readily available to them by the drug lords.<br /> A man of principle and high ideals, Wakefield begins by educating and familiarizing himself with all facets of the drug trade.  He quickly learns that although he is far from naive in terms of the reality of what he is dealing with, he actually has no concept of the depth and scope of it, like how much better equipped and financed the cartels are than the U.S. Government, for instance.  Another troubling aspect of the story involving Wakefield is the lack of respect accorded him by the young people with whom he comes into contact, not only in his official position, but simply as a human being-- especially by his own sixteen-year-old daughter and her \\"friends.\\"  Unfortunately, it realistically reflects an attitude prevalent within a wide faction of our society today; and it's one of the strengths of the film that it can so succinctly capture something so distressing, something that should be of monumental concern to everyone, for it's an integral part of a larger something that touches us all.  Also realistically portrayed is Wakefield's reaction to all of this; the helplessness born of the limited ways of combating what he encounters is extremely well realized and conveyed by the film, and it enhances even more that already overpowering sense of futility.<br /> From the Mexican side of the border, the story unfolds through the perspective of Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro), a veteran of the Mexican Highway Patrol; and it's from his side of the fence that we begin to understand the ramifications of the politics, money and power, and ruthlessness that so empowers the cartels.  In these segments, the dialogue is in Spanish (with English subtitles), and Soderbergh uses a tint to the film that lends a visual sense of detachment to the action; it's almost like watching an old newsreel, which gives it an air of authenticity that works because it's incorporated with the emotional substance that ultimately provides the real impact.<br /> The superlative cast Soderbergh assembled for this film includes Don Cheadle, Luis Guzman, Dennis Quaid, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Steven Bauer, Jacob Vargas, Erika Christensen, Miguel Ferrer, Amy Irving, Tomas Milian and James Brolin.  An important film of gut-wrenching implications and staggering emotional proportions, \\"Traffic\\" evokes a sense of futility and loss (especially in the final scenes) that is, at times, overwhelming.  It makes you realize just how huge the drug trafficking trade is, and how any efforts to eliminate or even contain it simply pale in the light of it's enormity.  It's like a terminal cancer, spreading and eating away at the fabric of our society; a disease that reduces the value of human life to the barest minimum.  It's a movie that will affect everyone on a different level emotionally, depending somewhat upon personal experience and frame of reference, but there is no doubt that this is a film that will create a lasting impression on anyone who sees it; but be prepared, for this is powerful drama that elicits a sense of hopelessness which-- I'm sure for many-- may hit just a bit too close to home for comfort.
B000000WJZ|5.0|!!!YOU HAVE TO GET THIS ALBUM IF YOU HAVENT DONE SO, IDIOT!!! <br />how can you say your an grunge and/or indies dude if you don't even own this album. this album is the ultimate grunge album (right next to pearl jams TEN and nirvanas NEVERMIND). Siamese Dreams is an 90's classic , SP classic , rock and roll classic , and a simple classic (yes classic is over rated today).<br />The tracks are simply awsome. nice, emo, fat distortion, with awsome lyrics. All tracks are done to the best. from intro of Cherub Rock to the outro of Luna. from heavy Silverfuc to ballad Disarm. This album is simple great. the only thing that is a miss is Space boy, sorry never listened to it for years. <br />well well well well worth your money. Pumpkins best. Indies and grunge classic. get this album get this album (who would hate it, pop hiphop people?)
B00004SCX6|1.0|When I first heard &quot;Opps I did it again I thought it was somebody impersonating Britney and singing &quot;baby one more time&quot;. All her songs sound the same, she sings over the same drum beat the backing instruments hardly change.

B0000024SI|5.0|This album starts off with it's best known song, &quot;Like a Rolling Stone,&quot; and starting even at that high level, the quality never goes down.  Songs like &quot;Tombstone Blues&quot; and the title track stand out as being masterpieces, both musically and lyrically.  In fact (why carp?), ALL the songs stand out as being masterpieces.  Simple in their musicality, complex in their lyrics, each track is seemingly more incredible than the last.  The final cut, &quot;Desolation Row,&quot; is an eleven minute tour through a place where a whole host of unusual, symoblic characters live.  With it's beautiful melody and intricate lyrics, &quot;Desolation Row&quot; is a perfect ending to Highway 61 Revisted, an excellent album in all respects.

B00004Y62T|5.0|When young Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) is casually mistaken for being an alumnus of Princeton, he is sent on a mission to retrieve Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law), the son of an influential New York tycoon, from his extended sojourn in Italy. The promise of cash in hand and the inscrutable allure of the Mediterranean immediately seduce Tom, who is struggling to pay his bills in various jobs. But Tom is not all he seems: multi-talented and gifted with a frightening ability to mimic other people's voices, he arrives in Italy, having carefully crafted a plan to ingratiate himself in the company of Dickie and his fiancee, Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow). In particular, Tom appeals to Dickie's ecstatic love of jazz. Together, they form a bond that is seemingly fraternal, yet incipiently homoerotic.<br />It would be a shame to ruin the film by going on with the admittedly thin plot. Suffice to say that the increasingly unwieldy relationship between Tom and Dickie quickly embroils Tom in a spiralling pattern of murder and lies. What is amazing is that Tom and Dickie's relationship resonates throughout 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' yet is never made explicit. <br />People will either love or hate this film. That's fine. One thing is certain: once 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' was denied by the Academy Awards, its subtle multiple layers were condemned to oblivion by the majority of filmgoers. Like Tom himself, this powerful, endlessly beguiling film is not all it seems: it's not an action movie. Nor is it a mystery thriller, for we always know who the killer is. The film derives momentum not from a cracking  narrative but from the complex poetic symbolism with which director Anthony Minghella imbues his tantalisingly lubricious images of the Italian coast. Just as the desert in Minghella's 'The English Patient' bespoke the sexual and emotional longing of its characters, Italy embodies the suppressed, turbulent raptures of this film's equally tortured characters. Italy is not all it seems, either: bodies are constantly being turned up, by land and by sea. More Sophocles than Hitchcock, the film charts the vagaries of Tom's Italian tour to what seems like his inevitable downfall.                     <br />Boasting a gorgeous jazz and orchestral score and wonderfully three-dimensional performances by Matt Damon, who plays Tom as an awkward youth constantly being surprised by the clamorings of his inner desires; Jude Law, who is astonishing as the petulant and intemperate Dickie; Gwyneth Paltrow, Philip Seymour Hoffman (as Tom's camp rival for Dickie's affections) and Cate Blanchett (as a spoilt, delightfully ditsy daughter of an American textiles-company owner), 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' makes you think long after you've left the theatre (or the lounge room). Above all, it's a film about identity: for as Tom discovers, no matter who you pretend to be, or say you are, you are nothing without a strong sense of self. Here's the final secret of 'The Talented Mr. Ripley': this modern tragedy is a modern classic.
0790734060|5.0|This is an absolute great film.  The music of Mozart is among the best classical music in history.   This is a movie about obsestity to the extream. Salieri is obsested with Mozart to the point of wanting him dead.  He geniusly befriends Mozart and the mind games begin.  Pretending to be Mozart's dead father, Salieri slowly drives Mozart insane.  With his mind games and people constant pounding at Mozart's door wanting their finished music, the life in Mozart is slowly ebbed out of him until he can no longer survive.  He dies, overworked, with no money, and burried in an unmarked grave.  A tragic end to one of the world's best and beloved composers.
B00000JY1X|2.0|A monster of a c.d. created almost in it's entirety by Stephen Merritt.He writes the songs,plays most of the instruments and sings on most of the tracks.He does get help from four other vocalists,each one with their own distinctive style and merits.So if the object of this c.d. was to prove that he is a prolific songwriter then he has certainly proved his point.But as people always say quality should always be more important then quantity-and it is on this note that I think this c.d. ultimately fails.<br /> Firstly I have to say it's very difficult review a c.d. with so many songs.It's a triple c.d. and like the title says it has 69 songs-which mainly concern love and romance.The style of the music is very hard to descibe as there are so many different sounds and influences on this c.d.It goes from sounding like Nick Cave or OP8 one minute to sounding like very bad early synth pop of the late seventies,early eighties.Added to this you've got songs with a country,jazz and soul influence-so all musical tastes and genre's are catered for.Lyrically it goes from the very humerous to the just plain daft.It's the only c.d. I know which has songs which relate to so many aspects of the animal world-from headless chickens to songs about what bunny rabbits are most famous for.Add to this you've got cuckoo's,boa constrictors and zebra's to name but a few.<br /> It's very hard to pick out stand out tracks here.There are quite a few excellent songs-enough to make one excellent c.d.But far too often I found myself with the remote control in my hand flicking past several very weak songs-that to be honest can be quite irritating.The great plus point I would say though is that there are so many different songs that I'm sure many people would have differing views on what are the best songs-so there is something on this c.d. for everyone!But all in all I think 69 songs (Which range from being just over a minute long to the longest song which doesn't reach four minutes)is just too muchfor the listener.Maybe if you've got loads of time on your hands or are a castaway who just happens to have brought along a diskman,with an endless supply of batteries(probably better then talking to a volleyball!)-this c.d. maybe for you!!
B00003CXDG|4.0|Mission Impossible 2 is a cool movie and awesome action which is what keeps this movie going- plus there are many unexpected surprises: The masks!  This is a good thrill ride and all but i've seen the plot too many times.  I don't get how anyone wouldn't understand it.  Some Einstein look-alike makes this virus and this antidote to cure it and is trying to make some bucks with Demeetree (Tom Cruise- Magnolia, Eyes Wide Shut, Top Gun).  But he is tricked by Sean Ambrose, another agent, and Ambrose steals the virus and tries to make 30 million pounds.  So Ethan Hunt, (Cruise), goes out to stop him in high speed, ulitmate shootout form.  VERY DIFFERENT from the first Mission Impossible- it's not as confusing and there's a lot more action in the movie...  The plot which is old news like in such film's as Wolfgang Petersen's OUTBREAK and Steven Seagal's THE PATRIOT is about some virus that can kill you within 20 hours and has slipped into the wrong hands- Boring- if only it would have been different in that aspect of plotting it would have nearly been perfect.  The acting was great- but i woulda liked to have seen some in place of Ambrose's girlfriend- or Hunt's girlfriend-(Either way) should have been someone talented like Nicole Kidman or Patricia Valasquez, maybe even Jennifer Lopez or Carrie Anne Moss (Trinity- The Matrix).  The directing you could tell was far more different, from Brian DePalma (Mission To Mars) to John Woo (Face/Off, Broken Arrow).  Woo for this film used this slow motion a lot which for a few scenes was just too long like when the two (Hunt + Girl) were spinning in there cars over that cliff-like road.  That kinda stunk.  The masks- how would hunt know to bring all of those and everything- like at the near end when he was in that cave place underground and was facing Ambrose's ally- it really caught me in the theater when I found out that really wasn't Ethan Hunt that died.  Well, anyway this movie is pretty good so you should see it if you're anaction fan and like seeing a typical plot repeated.  Rated PG-13 for Action Violence, Very Brief Language.  123 min
B000051VWW|4.0|I have to say I was never one of Sade's biggest fans.Okay like millions I did buy and enjoy Diamond Life,but after a while I found her songs to be a bit bland and always sounding the same.Maybe it's because she hasn't done anything for 8 years and even though the overall sound is similar to what she has done previously-I can't help but I like this c.d.<br /> The start helps enormously.From the first laidback,mellow chords of \\"By Your Side\\"-this c.d. has grabbed my attention.It's just a beautiful late night tune-and it's just so catchy-you find yourself humming this as you drift off to sleep.The pace and mood of the c.d. hardly changes at all-party music it ain't!It's totally designed for a late night chill out time.Apart from the songs of romantic optimism there are also songs of great hurt and sadness in the romance stakes that is.Song 3 \\"King Of Sorrow\\" and the amazing song 8 \\"Every Word\\",illustrate this.In fact the latter with it's Red Hot Chili Peppers guitar riff at the start and it's feint Euro vocoder vocals it's my favourite song on the c.d.Song 4 another about \\"a broken heart\\" has the heavy bass and drums of Massive Attack-an excellent song.Then the more optimistic and upbeat song 5 \\"All About Our Love\\" is also really magnificent with a killer catchy chorus.So we're 5 songs in and the high standards of excellence have been maintained all along.<br /> The next song \\"Slave Song\\" shows a welcome change of lyrical content and it's an issue Sade touches on in song 9 \\"Immigrant\\" also.Unfortunately while these may have the best lyrics on the album,I just didn't think the actual tunes were as good.The reggae riff on \\"Slave Song' is also a nice change,but I do think it's one of the few weak songs on the c.d.<br /> The Sweetest Gift is such a simple,short and very uplifting song.It's the shortest on the c.d. but the sentiment comes across so well,when all it needs is Sade's excellent voice and one acoustic guitar.The title songs has a guitar and rhythm to it which isvery reminiscent of Finlay Quaye.It's not one of her better songs though.Finally the closing track is just so hauntingly beautiful with an organ and a piano that would be so suited to a smokey late night bar.It finishes off this album superbly.<br /> So after Sade is back and it's a really superb return to form for her.I'm not surprised this c.d. has done so well chart wise.I would totally recommend this c.d. to all.
6305603847|5.0|I don't want to contribute a lengthy deconstruction of every aspect of the film, but I do want to make a few comments that I feel very important to add concerning The Wall.  I would like to say that the editorial review of The Wall is absolutely incorrect regarding the conflict between Parker, Waters, and the animator.  From the documentary footage it is very clear to see that it was very much a collaborative effort that Waters' felt did a very good job of putting his twisted yet meaningful thoughts into cinematic perspective.  I found this DVD which included not only the classic film, but also wonderful commentary and documentary footage, to be an incredible success.  This is a must for any Pink Floyd fans who are wanting to see a little bit inside the mystery of Roger Waters and into the mentality behind the creation of the album, The Wall.
0784010501|5.0|5 Stars for Madonna and her concert footage, it's great! The only down thing about this DVD is that the gray scale footage is kind of &quot;funny&quot; ...meaning something doesn't quite seem right about it, but nothing to get in the way of enjoying the film. The concert footage is outstanding as well as the sound. Makes you really feel like it's live. Show's you how much preformers such as Madonna go through, and what they put everyone else through. The story line of this documentry follows Madonna around the world of her famous &quot;Blonde Ambition Tour&quot; and shows whole concert footage of &quot;Express Yourself&quot; &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; &amp; &quot;Holiday&quot; as well as parts of or Madonna talking trhough &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; &quot;Vogue&quot; &quot;Live to Tell&quot; and a few others. Great for any Madonna fan or someone who likes music.
0671034065|5.0|I have been reading Linda Howard's novels for many, many years. This book was the best one yet. It was laugh out loud funny! This book reminded me a little of Jennifer Cruisie's style. I hope that Linda will continue to write humerous novels. Many of her earlier works were dark, with the hero or heroine having some sort of emotional problem. I like this type much better!
B00004XOWM|1.0|I heard Rollin and My Generation and liked them. Then I heard Hot Dog. First i kinda liked it, thought it was catchy. Then, halfway through, I heard them make fun of 'NIN - Closer.' Thats a great song from a great band. Dont mess with it.
6304609825|5.0|I bought the widescreen VHS version of Sleeping Beauty about 4 years ago, and it was the first time I had seen any Disney movies on widescreen video.  With an aspect ration of 2.35:1 (I think) this movie has a cinematic feel to it, especially in the scenes with Aurora and the Prince dancing at the lakeside.<br />This movie is just such a classic.  Unllke alot of Disney movies before and after, this one is not so bubbly and happy, in fact it's kind of dark at parts.  When I saw it as a kid, Malevalent scared me alot!  With the widescreen aspect ration, the sharp classic animation style, and some wonderful music and songs (taken from Tchaikovsky's Sleeping Beauty Ballet themes), in particular, &quot;Once Upon a Dream,&quot; this movie is one you should definitely add to your collection!!<br />Oh, I forgot, they don't make it any more (at least not the widescreen version) and it's not out on DVD yet.  Hopefully they will come out with it soon, in widescreen, and with some good extras, like the short documentary at the end of the VHS version.  A true classic!
0780626966|5.0|I got this boxset for my birthday and although my mum and dad were weary of the pricetag it was definetly worth it. For your money you get 7 mostly brilliant films (2 is awful) and the first and seventh have a brilliant audio commentary track. The eighth disc is the icing on the cake its just loaded with extras. It takes at least a week to just watch the films never mind watching (and finding) the extras
0783225857|5.0|This has got to be one of the most incredible pieces of moviemaking ever created.  Of course movies cannot and almost never will match the books they are taken from but this movie is still one of the best ever.  The acting was truly sensational and the story will lift your heart and leave a lump in your throat, as it should.  I've owned this DVD for going on a year now and have watched it at least 15 times since then.  And in that time, it still enthralls me just as it did the first time I saw it.  There have been many attempts over the years to make movies such as priceless as this one (and quite a few have done very well) but I think this one stands alone as a testament to the wonderful talents of some very gifted actors, writers and moviemakers who will leave a powerful legacy for others to live up to.
6304602898|5.0|I'm a sucker for dark comedies. I'm a sucker for horror films. I'm a sucker for movies with lots of inside jokes. In other words, I'm dead center of Joe Dante's target demographic.<br /><br />This movie has it all. It starts out like an homage to \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\", then things start getting weird. Amid lots of cool cameos and typical Joe Dante background action (always watch what TV's are playing in the background of any scene in a Dante film), the film begins taking an ominous turn.<br /><br />Adeptly, Dante keeps his options open far past when you'd expect him to have to commit, so you're over halfway through before you know for sure whether it's going to be funny or creepy. The decision is signaled with the comic execution of the show's least likable character. From there, it's simply the funniest film ever made.<br /><br />I especially love the cameos - Chuck Jones, Steven Spielberg, Robby the Robot, the Time Machine (check out the background action in *that* scene!), \\"Show White\\", and the list goes on. The casting of both major and minor characters is perfect, with lots of recognizable veterans along with Joe Dante regulars such as Dick Miller. The deliciously evil mayhem of the gremlins themselves leaves no icon of popular culture untapped.<br /><br />Many have claimed that the sequel was better, but I have to disagree. For me, the contrast between the Capra-esque backdrop and the \\"What type of film is this?\\" treatment are what elevate it to greatness. The sequel lacked both qualities. It's also not going to be as popular with critics who like to be able to categorize any film within the first 15 minutes.<br /><br />I can't recommend it highly enough! I'd especially recommend it as the ultimate anti-Christmas movie for when it's late December and you're getting really burned out on forced cheerfulness.<br /><br />Update:<br />Ok, after decades in the top spot, Gremlins has lost that honor to the Lord of the Rings trilogy (which I consider to be a single movie). Still, I've been watching movies for a half century plus, so 2nd place isn't too shabby! It still holds the record as the film I saw the most times in a theater - I paid for 12 tickets before I figured I'd caught enough of the gags going on in the background or periphery.<br /><br />Later update:<br />If you consider the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy as a single film, or even the complete series of  \\"Babylon 5\\", they have supassed \\"Gremlins\\" as my favorite. But \\"Gremlins\\" remains my all-time favorite single film - i.e. watchable in a single sitting.century plus, so 2nd place isn't too shabby!

B00000IOSU|5.0|Sarah McLachlan's music is pioneering and this CD contains some of her best songs. I've noticed that some of her songs sound remarkably like some X-Files tunes, especially the opening few seconds of &quot;Possession&quot; which almost sounds Mark Snowish. The lyrics of &quot;Building a Mystery&quot; could be made into the unoffical Fox Mulder anthem, you guys notice that? Also, on the X-Files movie soundtrack there is an exclusive McLachlan song &quot;Black&quot;. All things considered, I've come to the conclusion that she must be an X-Files fan.<br />About this CD, in particular, then... okay. The music is great. Sarah has made waves in the music industry that parallel those made by Cher and Jewel and Alannis Morisette. She has a beautiful, lilting voice and songs with lyrics and moods that stretch the gamut from happy and upbeat to pensive and brooding, to grieving. But you all know that already. <br />The only thing that bugged me about this CD is that it's a live recording, but then again, I should've read the back a little bit more carefully
6305079811|3.0|Well, shoot. Here I was, just itchin' to write a review about the Flash Gordon movie. I was gonna let you know about it being the kind of cheeseball film that shouldn't be taken seriously at all, but is still fun to watch. I was going to go into the so-bad-it's-good acting performances by most of the cast. Throw in my fond childhood memories of this celluloid silliness, and my outlook on the whole shebang would've been complete.    The only problem is, it would've looked pretty much the same as all the other customer reviews for this flick! I wouldn't exactly come off looking very original. So if you really want to get the gist of what this film's all about, just read some of the other customer reviews, and ignore mine completely. They'd be no more or less accurate... or different... from what I'd have written.     Thank you for your attention...    ...'Late!
031286504X|5.0|Nothing Matheson has ever written has disapointed me (what can I say, all those rave reviews aren't just a smoke screen) but &quot;I am Legend&quot; is different because it is a landmark in the vamp genre. In a world where so much garbage is pumped out into the public and passed off as literature it's nice to read something of substance, something gothic and dark and big enough to make you forget your life. The plight of Neville in this gem made me forget my own worries, and Matheson's unique use of the English language allowed me to visualize that plight in detailed horror. If you enjoy the works of Stoker and Rice, but haven't read Matheson, you don't know what you're missing.
0061003697|5.0|I've read a number of Agatha Christies, and this one is by far my favorite.<br />The charactes are all three-dimensional. Even the smallest characters have a personality and emotions. The mystery is baffling, and quite challenging for those readers who try very hard to figure out the mystery. The addition of Colonel Johnny Race is a great one, and he's a good temporary replacement for Captain Hastings.<br />The solution will blow you away. It's absolutely wonderful. A good mystery should leave you wide-eyed and thinking about the solution for a good while after reading it, and that's exactly what this one does. The solution is perfectly satisfying, unlike some other Agatha Christies (Cards On The Table, Sparkling Cyanide). <br />This is one of the longer Agatha Christies, at 307 pages, but it's well-worth your time. I absolutely reccomend Death on the Nile to anyone.
0451196716|5.0|Yes, I know how many people despise the ending to The Long Walk.  But I'm here to tell you that out of all King's works, it's the most brilliant ending he's yet committed to paper.  I know most people look for more closure once they reach the ending, and they want a &quot;happy ending.&quot;  If King would have gone this route, as so many of you seem to wish, I would have been extremely disappointed.  He took an unconventional, downbeat approach, and I'm glad he did.  It gives the novel that much more power, at least to me.  In case you didn't get it, Garraty didn't survive long enough to claim his prize.  The &quot;dark figure&quot; who &quot;beckoned, beckoned in the rain, beckoned for him to walk, to come and play the game&quot; is obviously the figure of Death, and the game which he wants Garraty to come and play is the game of death.  When he finds the strength to run, he's obviously running to meet his death.
B00005214X|5.0|Yes, I am a time traveller!  And George Harrison is my pilot.  I had thought about this album for years, but didn't think I'd actually buy it.  Well, I caved in and did it and I sure am glad I did!  It is WONDERFUL to hear these songs again so many years after I heard it first on vinyl when they were first released.<br />One word of caution:  These are LOUD CDs!  And I mean VOLUME wise.  Maybe it's the CD player in my car, but these two CDs generate a lot of sound, much more so than other CDs I've played and I've played MANY MANY!  But, that's not necessarily a bad thing nor does it mean that the remastering is defective.  To the contrary, they are well, well done.  Your mileage may vary!<br />Without question, this is the finest album done by any of them in the post-Beatle musical era.  Certainly the most in terms of sonic arrangement and diversity.  It will stand for a very long time as the showpiece of George Harrison's talent including the new tracks that were included.<br />A brilliant work and worth owning.
B0000508U6|5.0|What a incredible record ! This album in my opion is a instant classic. There are very few new albums I buy , I don't like rap the Britney's you get the picture. COLDPLAY is a talented band . They will go far.
B00005214X|5.0|Finally...All Things Must Pass remastered.  We've waited so long. There are few albums more worthy than this one.  Why, you ask?<br />First, it contains Harrison's strongest, most focussed songwriting.  The final year and a half of Beatledom for George was both very good and very bad.  Certainly, he was extremely frustrated with his role in the Beatles.  he was feeling overshadowed by the egos and songwriting of Lennon &amp; McCartney, feeling stifled by McCartney and George Martin in the studio and pissed at Lennon for numerous reasons.  George dealt with it all by working with other musicians and expressing himself by writing songs that expressed his philosophical/spiritual beliefs.  <br />It would be the greatest group of songs he would ever write.<br />He would assemble the greatest core of musicians he ever assembled.<br />He would hire Phil Spector to bring it all together.<br />He would make, by far, his grandest and greatest album.<br />From one point of view, the album is flawless.  Certainly, the songs never lag, and the musicians always deliver inspired performances.  George is in fine voice, and Spector knew how to use that somewhat limited voice to fine effect.  However, the wall of sound is, at best, a matter of taste.  In my opinion, the brilliance of What is Life is somewhat obscured by the famous &quot;wall&quot;, and Wah-Wah is all but buried in it.  A part of me can't help but wish that Harrison would have given in to tempation and remixed it.  I know he was worried about changing the &quot;sound&quot; of a classic, but I point to Lennon's 'Imagine' as an example of a remix that sharpens, but does not dramatically change the sound. Of course, on that album, Spector stays away from the infamous &quot;wall&quot; except for the pedestrian I Don't Want to Be a Soldier Mama.  But, on that song, I can actually hear all the instruments with some definition for the first time.  The same could have been done with a remix of ATMP.<br />OK, so I got that outof my system.  I am still thrilled to have this release.  Derek &amp; the Dominoes play like their lives depended on it.  The extra tracks are worthy; particulary Let It Down, which is just flat beautiful.  And, no matter what folks say here, do not overlook the jams.  There are some inspired moments, and, as jams go, really keep your interest.<br />Essential listening.
0684833395|5.0|To be honest with all you gentle readers, I don't much admire War novels, nor do I stand by the title of my review. Generally, I believe War is truly Hell.<br />But last Winter, in the grips of a bout of quasi-depression-for-teens following a move to the most FLAT province in Canada, I truly thought I was in Hell. An e-mail friend suggested Catch-22 to use up edgy cabin-fever time. Now, let it be known that my attention span for most novels dwindles quickly, especially if the book is slow to pick up. While significantly slower to get 'into' than most of the writing I chase, Catch-22 sucked me in, like Alice down the rabbit hole. It is sharply funny, engaging, and chock full of delightful characters. The main character is a thinker; a young man disheartened by war and his own mortality. His name is Yossarian, and since reading this novel, he has stood out in my mind as being one of the most...sculpted... characters in the history of literature.<br />Put simply, this book is a satire about World War 2. Coming from a kid sickened by the very idea of war, I can say that this book is worth whatever bills you have to fork over for it. It's not about war, per se, but more about the human condition. In addition, it made me laugh a few times, something that only a few other works of fiction have ever been successful in accomplishing. I finished this book feeling oddly... renewed. If you're looking for something 'new' (or, so old it's new) and engaging, I heartily recommend 'Catch-22' by Joseph Heller.
B000059TPN|5.0|A friend of mine wanted to buy the DVD 2 years ago but I told him not to buy it because it doesn't have much extras, and some day, they'd release a better DVD than the previous one. Ha ha ha! At last, it's about that time to have this Criterion Collection DVD in my hands. Great actors, great action sequences and great music! A worthwhile addition to your own collection.

B000000OPU|5.0|I know I have 6 of the 9 songs on Peter's &quot;Shaking the Tree: Sixteen Golden Greats&quot; cd but I had to have &quot;So&quot; since &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; was on that cd. I have always loved that song &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; from the classic '80s movie &quot;Say Something&quot;. I wished it was included on Peter's &quot;Shaking the Tree&quot; cd but alas it wasn't.  Peter is now one of my favorite artists. Who else can blend world, pop, rock and funk and make it  his own sound? &quot;Mercy Street&quot; is my very favorite Peter Gabriel song. The song is a 4 and a half epic that  sends chills down my spine. Daniel Lanois's production is top notch. I definitely see how &quot;So&quot; was listed as one of the 100 greatest albums on VH1. It is a definite classic.
B00004X01U|5.0|While the title track reeks of cool retro-electro beats and a memorable chorus, the album itself is nothing quite the same. As engaging as Ray Of Light, Music continues to show Madonna's greater interest into deeper and more mature issues.<br /><br />On the excellent next single What It Feels like A Girl, Madonna laments how the (male-dominated) world has treated women and imagine what it would have been for her if she were a man. On the vocodered Nobody's Perfect, Madonna sings about how no one can be perfect and she is vulnerable to making mistakes too. The concluding title Gone sees Madonna saying &quot;Selling out is not my thing.&quot; How true!<br /><br />For someone who has stayed resilient through the changing musical landscapes over the last 20 years, Madonna has kept herself at the forefront of music and fashion. Despite raging critics at times, Madonna has proven time and again that her music is relevant yet listenable.<br /><br />It was unfortunate that the Grammys didnt realize the gem of Music by not giving her the Record of The YEar. How the Academy works is fumbles me sometimes, but it may be true that great music needs no awards at all.
B000002BHE|5.0|For me this is Celine Dion's best release.Many of the songs which she is renowned for are on this album.In 1996 I was Celine Dion crazy,and it was largely due to this magnificent album.I could not help constantly falling in love with that excellent song &quot;Falling into you&quot; on this album.&quot;Make you happy&quot; is also a wonderful track.The first 4 songs are really,really brilliantThe remaining songs on this album amazingly maintain that excellent standard of the first 4 tracks.It is a really wonderful blend of good lyrics,excellent music and a tremendously beautiful voice.Celine Dion was absolutely brilliant on this cd and those of you who have never heard her music,I highly suggest that this cd becomes your first in what will  I am sure become a really big Celine Dion collection.She really is in my opinion the best female singer in the world.
B00004ZD69|5.0|WOW! If you're looking for beautiful music this is the band, this is the album. I could try to find the words to describe it... but i'm afraid i couldn't do it justice. Listening to this CD an unweary listener could lose themselves in the music. Godspeed you black Emoporer is indeed an odd name for a band as beatiful as this. The only unfortunate thing about this album is that after you listen to it, and you wll listen to it all, you find yourself wondering what you could possibly put on next. There is nothing i've heard save radiohead and other bands of that level talent that could possibly follow this CD up. I am personally very greatful that i found this CD, and suggest very strongly to anyone who hasn't heard this CD, or this band, that you pick it up. Listen to it when you have time to lay back and absorb this amazing instrumental masterpiece. And their Canadian... you can't go wrong
0375501851|4.0|As I read this novel I continued to be astonished that the author is only 24 years old. That was almost bothersome at first; that someone so young could enter the personas of middle-aged men of two different nationalities, and that she could do it with such confidence. <br />If this isn't quite a 5-star novel, it is still an amazingly accomplished debut. It's literary, has depth of character and purpose of plot, and wraps up with a smooth and satisfying ending. <br />Mary Higgins Clark and Danielle Steel readers probably won't like it; this novel takes a little work and persistance. If this is her debut goodness knows what her next endevour will be. She's definately a writer to watch.
B000006TZ8|5.0|Comeing off the dissapointing sales and acceptance of &quot;Modern World&quot;, The Jam knew they had to regroup. This album could've easily made or broke the band's success, and as we know, there was no breaking going on. Weller's lyrics grew with maturity and the shift of his focus from his girfriend to actually writing well thought out songs made this album a triumph, not just for the band itself, but for brittish bands in general. Also present here is one of their best cover songs bar none : David Watts by The Kinks. This album deserves a place in the record collection of any fan of Mod, Britpop, or just plain good 80's rock and roll.

If you've not seen the movie DO NOT READ THIS as it will blow the story for you.<br />Criticisms and logic-flaws of Deep Impact.<br />1.

Wow! I wonder why none of the thousands of other amateur astronomers with powerful instruments missed it, not to mention the hundreds of observatories. Oh well I guess they just weren't looking in the right spot. So now we are supposed to believe that the ONE LONE astronomer who calculated the comet's trajectory is the ONLY ONE who worked out that it was on a collision course - duh!<br />2. Here we are one year later (if they are close enough to be seen by a backyard telescope, most comets take only a few weeks to pass by the earth and circle the sun, however this one takes a year ...) and apparently NO-ONE ELSE has twigged that there is a 2 kilometre chunk of ice heading for us ... so the President decides to keep it a secret. But then after he does announce it to the world, not much happens. In reality, people would immediately start panic-buying. Within a few days ALL the shops would be out of stock. People would stop going to work to protect their families as the survivalist &quot;it's us or them&quot; mentality sets in. Society collapses very quickly under these conditions, the utilities collapse, marshal law is established for a while until the military chain of command also caves in. Religious revival, rioting, looting, anarchy on a global scale ... money would mean nothing, the stock markets crash within days ... but in the movie this did not happen until just before the comet hit ... strange ...<br />3. The Russians (bless their little hearts) come to the rescue by SECRETLY (oh yeah? How do you hide a spaceship the size of a battleship in orbit?) constructing a shiny big new spaceship with a TOTALLY NEW AND UNTESTED NUCLEAR FUSION DRIVE IN ONE YEAR! A kind of turbo spaceship, probably made out of bits of the scrapped Mir. If the Russians can't even build a measly new trailer-home-sized module for the new international spacestation in several years, let alone a completely new propulsion system (where the hell did they test this thing?) ... well you be the judge. I'd rather believe that it was powered by Yeltsin's vodka stock.<br />4. The gung-ho Yank crew with token Cool Russian behind the wheel (piloting the ship like he was driving his Lada through Moscow traffic) race off to blow up the comet (didn't anyone bother to tell them that even if they did blow it up, all the pieces are still gonna be travelling at the same speed and in the same direction? Look guys, listen up, I'll say this just once, what you gotta do is ALTER ITS DAMN COURSE - NOT BLOW IT INTO A MILLION LITTLE PIECES, ALL TRAVELLING AT THE SPEED OF A BULLET, THAT WILL COME RAINING DOWN ON OUR CITIES LIKE A COSMIC SHOTGUN BLAST!) but instead  of flying PARALLEL to the swirling ball of ice, the stupid twits fly RIGHT UP ITS TAIL! Well I suppose if Yuri or whatever the driver's name was, is used to dodging all those potholes in Moscow, then a few meteors spewing out from the comet's tail is a piece of piss! Pity that this damaged the ship though.<br />5. So after they finally detonate the cool nuclear explosives and split the comet into 2 big bits instead of millions of small ones, they retreat and lick their wounds wondering what to do now that they have failed. They argue about not having enough fuel to return to the comet and have another go. Excuse me? Did I miss something? Aren't they travelling at the same speed and direction as the comet? Only further away to avoid the shockwave of the blast - even though in space there is nothing to propagate a<br />shockwave ... it would only take a minor course correction to return them to the comet. Ah but we need all that unnecessary drama don't we? Or do we?<br />6. So finally the small bit impacts in the Atlantic with the predictable VERY BIG SPLASH. It would've been nice to see this from the crew's perspective - the panic in their eyes as a  second later as they ploughed into the pillar of lava that would be spewing up from the miles-wide fissure that has opened up in the continental shelf (which the computer animators completely forgot about) - right behind the REALLY BIG BIT as it dug itself into the crater left by the first bit. Research please! Who consulted the astronomers? Fire them!<br />7. And what was all that tosh the Prez was spouting about survivors being able to come out of their nice warm cavern to the surface in TWO years? Try 10,000 years mate. There's a very good reason the dinosaurs are only in the museums and computers. The dust cloud would cover the earth for at least that long, the temperatures at the equator would be minus 20 within a month, and you can forget about finding any food. All plants and animals (and people, except those living near volcanic hot springs) would have died from the volcanoes and earthquakes and choking fumes and volcanic dust and ... oh you get the picture ... that would shake the planet for hundreds of years after ... But that wouldn't have been much fun would it? It would have been more believable to have Superman leap out of his wheelchair and push the comet into the sun. But he's just never around when you need him is he?<br />© Peter Enright Moscow Aug. 1998
B00003CX7L|5.0|Check out the end credits.  Pixar provides out-takes from the making of the movie.  Wait a minute; out-takes from a totally computer-generated animation feature?  Exactly, and this extra little bit of fun and humor speaks volumes about the creativity and overall pleasure Pixar takes in the wonderful work they do.  A fantastic movie for both adults and kids, expanding on the original, but much more than your typical Disney knockoff-sequel geared only to make money.
B0000508U6|5.0|I have never felt compelled to write a review until I listened to Coldplays debut lp &quot;Parachutes.&quot; Every song on this incredible cd sounds so heart-felt and genuine, you can't help but feel somewhat uplifted. I can see the comparison some people might make with Radiohead, but this album more than holds its own.       Even if you are one of those few people that would consider buying a cd for one song, &quot;Yellow,&quot; you will be more than pleased with the rest of the cd. From &quot;shiver&quot; to &quot;trouble,&quot; every song is as good if not better than the previous one.
B0000508U6|5.0|In a music scene with very few truly gifted artists, Coldplay debuts with an album that I believe is one of the best of the year. Parachutes exhibits a cohesiveness that is rarely seen these days outside of bands such as U2 and Radiohead. There is a definite theme to this album, and Coldplay gets a lot of mileage out of it.<br />The lyrics, although they sometimes sounds a bit trite, are also brilliant in songs like Trouble and Sparks. And if you're looking for melodies, this album has some of the best. Yellow and Shiver are sure-fire radio-hits; catchy songs with substance. The music and words definitely convey the feelings of loss and longing that permeate the album. ALso, the singing is nothing short of astonishing; the lead singer moves in and out of falsetto effortlessly.<br />Coldplay's influences are varied, including Dave Matthews, Nick Drake, Pink Floyd Oasis, Radiohead, U2, and maybe even a bit of The Cure. Not too shabby as influences go. The only minor problem is that the influences are sometimes a bit too apparent, but for a first effort Coldplay definitely hold their own and create a new sound. <br />In summary, the album flows beautifully and has some wonderfully crafted songs. It hits on a lot of levels and hits hard (especially if you've just gotten out of or are having trouble with a loved one). In short, go out and buy the album, because it's definitely worth 50 minutes of your listening time.
B00000K19E|3.0|I just bought this movie and hoped the hype was worth it.  I wasn't disappointed.  It's pretty cool but don't leave your chair or you might be totally confused.  The effects are great but the acting could have been better.  I am not impressed with Keanu Reeves....can't get passed the Bill and Ted thing. There are better movies out there, but this one is worth watching once to form your own opinion.  My favorite part of this film was the camera work.  It is far from traditional. The story itself was thought provoking but could have been told better. Overall, I've always liked this idea for a movie.  For those of you who gave it 1 star, I can't believe you haven't seen worse, but then again, just as I am, everyone is entitled to their own opinions.  Last thought, remember people....these are movies....that's all.  Watch them with an open mind and you might find that you'll enjoy them more. Last last thought....never watch a movie with great expectations, you'll be disappointed....and never trust a negative review, you might miss a movie you would really like.
6305311463|4.0|Ok,it is not the best plot out there,it is not perfectly acted (especially Liv Tyler,who didn't even act) and there are many logical errors in the script.Also too many American flags in the movie,as if it is trying to convince us that if the world needs to be saved one day,you know who would do it for you...(that is the usual case with Bruckheimer movies,I haven't seen one without a flag on it yet.Even in &quot;gone in 60 seconds&quot; he could put one somewhere in Cage's office)<br />But as the producer Bruckheimer repeatedly says,he makes movies to entertain people and Armageddon does it perfectly.And as it is said in the booklet of the DVD,it is very well directed really,with an amazing visual style..Michael Bay is the perfect director for this kind of movies,he really delivers (in The Rock as well)<br />The extras,are not bad but I would say there could be more deleted scenes.The music video and stroy boards are very good.<br />I recommend this DVD if you are not looking for a very suspenseful story and great acting but if you are a fan of disaster movies.As a matter of fact it is one of the best disaster movies ever..
B00000K0EA|5.0|To start out, I think that Pierce Brosnan is so much better at playing 007 than Roger Moore and Timothy Dalton.  Sean Connery is the best, but Brosnan really shows the suave sophisticated debonair personallity that Bond is known for.  And I enjoyed this Bond movie a little more that GoldenEye.  He did show that personallity in GoldenEye, but he didn't show it enough.  This one really brings it out.  And on top of that this movie is one of the best and most action-packed Bond flick ever.<br />I know that everybody just loved GoldenEye, but for some reason, I didn't love it as much as everybody else did.  I mean I liked it a ton, I just didn't love it.  I think that it really has alot of the Bond action, but I just don't love it for some crazy reason that I don't know.  But Tommorow Never Dies I love, there is a ton of action that doesn't stop.  I admit, the plot wasn't as good as GoldenEye, but it the action is too good.  Like the opening seen at a terrorist trade-off when he escapes in a jet after a cruise missle has hit, and who can forget the car (which can be remote controlled by his phone) seen.  Plus, there was alot of unexpected action (Whis Bond is known for) and undercover action.<br />So basically, this movie was a gigantic action seen from start to finish.  And I am very dissapointed in any Bond fan who hasn't seen it, go right now and go get it!
B000000HTO|5.0|It's worth buying this album just for 'My Room (Waiting for Wonderland)'. Here's the good news....it's all great. IMHO it's their 2nd best album behind the Aerosol Grey Machine. Bye the way 'Godbluff' is fantastic aswell. Hey, get em all!!
B000056VIY|4.0|I own this C.D. and I like it! I especially like the songs &quot;Play&quot; and &quot;Love don't cost a thing&quot; I don't think her C.D is all THAT bad. I enjoyed her other C.D. &quot;On the Six&quot; and so I tried this one out and bought it! I like the music, it's very easy to get stuck in your head. And if you do get it stuck in your head, it's not one of the songs where you say, &quot;Gosh, you know I hate this song, I wish I could forget it!&quot; It's one where you say, &quot;I LOVE THIS SONG!&quot; Some of the songs on the C.D. I wasn't very empressed with but most of them are very catchy and tasteful!
B000002MP2|5.0|This is the best Punk album ever.  It starts off high with Burnout which is a manic song about how punks feel these days.  The albums best track, Basket Case, is a truly wonderful song showing despressing overtones and a very claustrophobic atmosphere.  It's most important track, however, is When I Come Around which defines life around us.  The album ends with F.O.D.  which stands for F*** Off and Die. It is a great, mostly acoustic track about growing old and looking back on your crazy days.
B000002GJH|5.0|Some of these reviews blow me away- primarily those which expect this to be Pearl Jam (which I don't believe was even Mookie Blaylock yet), or Soundgarden.  I can definitely understand confusion from people who are used to having their processed, refined 'Grunge(tm)' foisted upon them by way of a slick corporate marketing machine, but this also ain't that.<br />What it is would be 5 people grieving with instruments on a soundstage (well, 6- if you count Eddie Vedder's tag-team work on 'Hunger Strike' and background vocals elsewhere, which equate to little more than a cameo), putting it all on their sleeves while remembering their fallen comrade and lamenting his chemical Achilles' heel.<br />I would definitely agree that this is some of Chris Cornell's best work to date.  It's a purely emotional and hauntingly beautiful experience- but if you prefer your music belt-sanded to a smooth finish and polished to the point of reflection or are just another Eddie Vedder fan looking for more of the same, then you might want to look elsewhere (or try the Creed album?).  Cornell's point would probably be missed on you.<br />I'm on my 4th copy of this CD now (2 wear-outs and one theft- not counting the industry cassette I had back in '92 and  wore to dust), and it only keeps getting better.  Here's my 5 stars- I only wish *those* 5 stars (and maybe even the sixth) would get back together sometime without requiring another funeral to do so- and give us a taste of what it's like *after* the healing process.
B000051VQR|5.0|Although I have nearly the entire Green Day collection and they are all very good Warning has to be my all time favourite. The songs are much more melodic and there is more variety, class songs such as Minority, Warning and Misery are what makes this album such a success. This album is so far the best of Green Day's and is a must-have for anybody that likes Green Day or Rock/Indie/Punk. GET IT NOW or suffer the consequences!
B00004TWZF|5.0|Luc Besson proves himself a veritable master director who captivates the audience/viewer with unique, fascinating, and stunning filmography.  The acting as a whole is compelling and believable.  Eric Serra composes a phenomenal sound track worthy of anyone's collection. Two reasons for which I considered a less than 5 STARS rating: 1- there's enough tragedy in real life which is why many people watch Movies. &quot;Happily Ever After&quot; would have been great; 2- in this movie Rosanna Arquette is perfectly obnoxious.
157270182X|5.0|There are very few novels that can guarantee five good laughs a page and chuckles during all the spaces between, but the Bertie Wooster/Jeeves novels of P.G. Wodehouse fill the bill. It is even jollier when a good British comedian simply reads the novel to you, as does Jonathan Cecil in the Audio Partners release of the 1938 &lt;The Code of the Woosters: Jeeves to the Rescue&gt; (1-57270-182-X).<br />  Here on 6 audiocassettes with a total running time of 7 hours is one of the stories you might have seen dramatized on Masterpiece Theatre a while ago. Oh, you know, the one about Bertie having to steal a cow-shaped creamer from Sir Watkyn Bassett for his Aunt Dahlia. Along the way, he becomes entangled in the on again, off again engagement between the newt-loving Gussie Fink-Nottle and the simpering Madeline Bassett, Roderick Spode who heads the Black Shorts (since all the Black Shirts have been bought up by an Italian of the period) and harbors a shameful secret), Stiffy Bynge who wants to marry the local clergyman H.P. &quot;Stinker Pinker,&quot; and the local Constable whose helmet has been pinched.<br />  The plot is simple at first and then, as in any good farce, rapidly accelerates into the complexity of a Baroque French clock and with about as much socially redeeming value. We simply sit back and marvel at the mechanism as (to carry on the analogy) Wodehouse's puppet-like characters perform their intricate movements around the hapless Bertie Wooster who not for the first time in these stories tends to lose faith in Jeeves just as that master of intrigue is at his brainiest. All this in the inimitable Wodehouse upper-class British twit jargon and a world every bit as real as that of Damon Runyon and W.S. Gilbert, providing you accept certain premises.<br />  Jonathan Cecil was very badly miscast as Arthur Hastings in two or three Poirot films in which Peter Ustinov played the sleuth. Here he is a gem, reading as he does every word of the novel and acting out every character, male and female, in a different voice. His reading, Wodehouse's literary style and plotting, and all the rest made 7 hours on the exerciser pass pleasantly quickly.<br />  Highly recommended even for more relaxed listeners.every character, male and female, in a different voice.

0440219078|5.0|The Giver is a very appropriate book for the study of folklore because it shows a fictional way people live their lives. The community is an excellent example on how fictional this story really is. If the reader reads this story they might think this could be a real community somewhere on earth.  The book does not have families that live in houses. They have family units that live in dwellings. To me dwellings are considered where animals live. Another thing that is fictional is people asking for release. This day and age you can't just say I want to apply for release because I am too old or I can't handle this job. Also, you can't just kill a twin baby because it is smaller and it might produce problems with the family. In this day and age you have to deal with things as they come to you. The community that Lois Lowry created for the reader is very fascinating and creative. She has an excellent imagination. There were a couple of questions I kept asking myself as I was reading the story. Who would want to become a birthmother and give the baby away after she was producing her own children? Why would they have ceremonies for kids becoming a 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. and not a regular birthday? Why would you want a child that has already been named for you? Wouldn't the family units want to name it themselves? Maybe the community has it's reasons for these types of crazy laws they have but if they knew the way the world worked today I am almost sure they would want to live their life a whole different way.
0553266306|4.0|The Day of The Jackal, writen by Fredrch Forsyth was writen in the 1960s. Algeria had just been liberated after a long bloody war over it. This angered many politicans. Most of them formed a secret orginization known as the OAS. This orginization had many views against the hipocracy in France. But most of all they blamed Charels DeGaul president of France. After many failed attemps at killing DeGaul the OAS was running out of funds, morail, and most of all people. Many of the members of the OAS told authorities about its opperations. So the new leader decided to do the most ratical thing they could think of which included hireing an assasin from the outside. The one and only man who would be up for such a job was known only under the alis Clark Duncan. He was a tall Englishman. He had  blond hair and blue eyes. He was a master of disgises, forgery, gunsmithing, marksmanship, poisin, torture, and hiding his tracks. He would be paid by way of bank robberies. He would create the smallest light weight gun ever made. He would come to forge hundreds of fake documents that would help elude the police with. And through the course of the story would kill eight people by way of stabing, shooting, hanging, poisin, and torture. For nine months he would heckel the French authorities. And would not stop until the day he pick for the death of Charels DeGaul. His identity is breached by the French Forien Legion but still chooses to continue with the opperation. He sneaks into Paris on the day of liberation, a French holiday in which DeGaul would give a speech in open day. Possing as a war veteran that would be reciving an award that day, he snuk in to a hotel across from where DeGaul would be giving the speech he hide in wait for three days. I have thought a long time to the question: do you recomend this book, and I have decided that I would recomend this book to anyone who can handel the sometimes hard to follow techincal terms, mostly in French, that slow the books story consideribly.ribly.
B0000524CY|5.0|This is a very disgusting movie.  Some of the scenes (especially the new ones) make you want to vomit.  This is NOT for anyone under 17.  I just don't remember the original being this gross.  Also, I could be mistaken but I think they actually deleted some scenes from the original for this one too, like some scenes that explained a little better what was going on.  This one seemed to be a little choppy and didn't flow very well.  Some of the details seemed very sketchy and hard to follow.<br />Most people already know the story, but here's a summary.  A 12-year-old girl becomes ill and is possessed by an evil spirit, a sick monster who &quot;claims&quot; to be the devil.  Whether he is or isn't Satan is speculation.  It torments the single mother who tries every known medical solution to no avail.  When she finally calls on a psychiatrist/priest to examine her, he concludes that she does meet the criteria set by the Catholic church to receive an exorcism.  An experienced exorcist is then called in, and with the original priest, they attempt to cast the demon out of the girl.<br />This is as realistic as a horror movie can get.  Maybe the best horror film ever made.
B0000024IE|5.0|This landmark CD is impressive to me for many reasons.  Public Enemy introduced their version of hip-hop in 1990 with &quot;Fear of A Black Planet&quot;.  The world is different because of it.  The bass&amp;drum forms a funky rhythm that benefits from volume.  Each of the songs finds a uniquely satisfying groove.  I find myself compelled to move when I listen to this CD.  The &quot;ministers&quot; enunciate with clarity and lock-step with the beat.  This is a talent which separates the great ones from the also-rans, and too few in this genre hit the mark.  For me the most compelling aspect of this performance is the serious lyrical content.  They are intelligent and socially conscious.  &quot;911&quot; is the hit.  I also like POLLYWANACRAKA, and BURN HOLLYWOOD BURN.  If you are interested in hip-hop music with a seriously heavy funky beat or in music with serious lyrical content, this CD will be interesting to you
B00003CXP1|5.0|After being shown endless drug-propaganda films in high school (&quot;Gee, Jimmy, I don't think we should hang out if you're gonna do that stuff.&quot;), it's no wonder so many teenagers use drugs.  I've never used heavy drugs and I can't say this is the exact effects of them, but it's very convincing.  There's nothing sugar-coated here; it is very disturbing and dark.  <br />All the elements that made Pi a crossover success are here; hallucinatory camera effects, well-developed characters, and even Sean Gullette himself.  The movie's best moments aren't even the ones that center around the main character, Harry.  Instead, we are most enthralled by the side story of his mother, Sara, played by Ellen Burnstyn.  She has addictions that are just as strong as her son, the only difference is hers are politically correct and socially acceptable.  Instead of heroin and coke, she is controlled by sugar and diet pills.<br />The movie doesn't have a happily-ever-after ending, as is such in the real world.  The movie never goes into prententious satirical-land, either.  It's just an unrelenting vision of the effects of drugs. If schools insist on trying to control others' lives, they should show this movie instead.
6300182266|5.0|A fantastic pilot to a series that had many ups and downs and got cancelled before it got a real chance to find its footing.  Thankfully, there's been a very recent announcement that Battlestar Galactica will be coming back thanks to Bryan Singer, the director of The X-Men.  Maybe soon it will finaly get the chance to live up to its potential.

B00004XQ83|4.0|Not normally a fan of old country western music, I was very impressed with the music on this CD.  I don't normally buy a soundtrack after watching a movie, but I made an exception to purchase this soundtrack.  I especially liked #15: &quot;In The Jailhouse Now&quot; and #16: &quot;I Am A Man of Constant Sorrow.&quot;  I didn't care too much for the instrumentals, #14: &quot;O Death&quot;, and #6: &quot;Hard Time Killing Floor Blues,&quot; thus the 4 star rating.

083351895X|2.0|I bought this version (as a gift) thinking it would complete my sister's Dean Koontz hardcover collection nicely - when it arrived I nearly died.<br />Its about the size of a mass market paperback, has cheap printing (text isn't even aligned right on the first 50 pages), and a cover that looks like it was scanned off the real thing and printed on a piece of wet cardboard.  It felt so bad that I thought I might damage it just by holding it...<br />Sure, go buy the book yeah but not THIS VERSION!
B000021XS0|5.0|An excellent piece of music. It's good from beginning to end ans it really draws you in. Not to mention the fc=act that this band is made up of some of the most talented and respected people on their respective instruments. Buy it now.
B00004Y635|5.0|I think Scream 3 was a great movie. It was scary, cool, and funny at some parts. I think Wes Craven did a fantastic job making a Scream 3. I also think it would be cool if he continued to make some sequels. EXCLLENT JOB WES CRAVEN!!!!!!!
0967984602|5.0|I don't know if I'm ever going to build an earth oven, but this book is a great deal of fun.  The illustrations are beautiful, and the writing seems designed to democratize and demystify the process of building an oven and, even, of baking bread.  The illustrations, including photographs of ovens, make you think about an oven as more than a tool next to the fridge.  The book has been on my coffeetable for about a month, and is likely to stay there for a while, because I find myself picking it up and leafing through it whenever I have a few free moments, and have been surprised to see that rereading is even more fun.

0679720200|4.0|Okay - I somehow managed to make it past high school and college without ever reading The Stranger.  Being an English major, I'm not quite sure how that happened but nevertheless it did.  So, whilst in the bookstore recently, I had to pick up a copy. I had prepared myself for a boring read but I was pleasantly surprised to find a very good challenging story.  <br />The first thing that really jumped out at me was Camus' writing style.  It took time to develop a knack for reading the short, abrupt sentences.  The feeling was akin to sitting in traffic - from 50 miles and hour to a full stop repeated over and over again.  But I warmed to the style of writing and soaked in the language, the story and the setting.<br />I now understand why this is considered by many to be a cornerstone of European literature.  And I highly recommend reading it.  Its not as daunting as the literary world leads you to believe.
B000009QPE|5.0|I have to admit, they probably couldn't do it any better than this. Reign in Blood's lightning-fast, insufferably brutal delivery pauses at just the right moments to allow the listener a half-second of respite, and then its off into the speed-metal gore once again. The lyrics are either great or ridiculous depending on your point of view, but who cares? The focus is really on the technically precise guitar playing (faster riffs have never been heard) and the outstanding drumming. I couldn't listen to it all the way through the first time I heard it; it was just too intense. Having built up my stamina, however, I can say that 29 minutes of ultra-violent thrash is a pretty welcome thing on those not-so-happy days.
6302990114|5.0|Having been brought up more or less on the works of Agatha Christie, I was a little more than excited when the films started coming out in the 70s/80s. The added extra was that casting included such luminaries as Bette Davis, Maggie Smith, Mia Farrow, etc,etc &amp; the to die for Simon Mac Corkindale...as a teenager this was more than I could hope for. The film was stunning, and, unlike the stageplay, true to the book. The performances (B.D ,Angela Lansbury, Peter Ustinov, David Niven et al) are superb...all in all one of the most entertaining films I've seen....better than Murder on the Orient Express.... The only drawback, as I remember, was that when it came out, I deliberately abstained from reading the book.I was in the cinema queue with my mum whem I heard some complete to@@er coming out of the cinema say &quot;Oh I didn't think it was '***********' who dunnit&quot; Spoilt it a bit, but never mind....!
0399226907|4.0|this is a great book for young children.  The illustrations have a unique style, that are accurate and follow the text very well.  The book helps the children ask question such as&quot; How much can he eat?&quot;, and &quot; I wonder what he'll eat next.&quot;  the story maintain an even flow, of building on what happened in the page before hand. The book takes the children on wonderous adventure making them think what food will he eat, and how much more will eat before he is full.  It also follows the sequence of nature to add to the children's learning.
B000003TAW|5.0|This album is absolutely awesome. Every song on this album is great.  These guys captured a time period when angst music was just about at it's height.  It happened to be when I was a freshman in highschool.  This album sounds like an album that was written for kids in highschool who are struggling to survive in a tough adolescent world.  The songs are filled with the kind of things that alot of highschool kids think about-girlfriends, surfing, alienation, popularity, and loneliness.  This does not mean that it is an album for highschool kids it just means that it reminds me of when I was in highschool and how it fit my life so well back then.  Anyone can find something in this album that they can relate to.  The style of music that Weezer plays is a punk rock angst-filled style of catchy tunes that even my Mom likes.  They are like a mix between The Beatles and Nirvana, or The Cars and the Ramones.  These guys know how to rock.  They certainly convinced Rick Ocasek he produced the album.  Some of my favourites on this album are Undone, My Name is Jonas, Say It ain't so, and The World Has Turned and Left Me Here.  But really you can listen to all the songs and be blown away.  This is the best debut album of all time.  I hope you buy it.  It will make you happy to listen to it.
B000058983|5.0|Sometimes, impassioned reviews through a site like this one can jar the memory and lead a person back to a favorite lost album.  This was the case with me and Da Capo, an LP long ago left behind.  Now, I have the pleasure of seeing my kids, 17 and 20, respond to this music.  This isn't postmodern pastiche rock, ala Beck and other talented borrowers and adapters, but rough and immediate music from the golden area of this form.  For fun, try to pick out the chord changes for Anmoreagain, a haunting song.
B000035P80|3.0|After watching this, you will never want to see another English hotel room again.  Most of the film consists of Dylan playing odd bars of music while his hangers-on laugh at everything he says.  You will not find out a whole lot more about him.  A little dull and disappointing.
B0000025VU|5.0|This is a less-religous album than the ones before it but still there is much of Mr. Dylan's Christian beliefs to be found here.   The song &quot;Jokerman&quot; is now on his third greatest hits collection and for a good reason: it is one of his greatest songs.  He has some things to say about this world we live in much as he did with his more famous protest songs from the 1960's.  In particular his comments about the morality of today and how it is maybe less now is a strong statement.  I admit I am not always doing things how God would want me to but still I try very hard! : ) Another special thing is how Mark Knopfler (from Dire Straits) produced the song to make it very smooth.  Sometimes the way the drums are barely audible is strange (this is how you can tell the record was not made in the 1970's because they always had many drums then) but it was a good change for Mr. Dylan who very often made songs that sounded too rough, like country yodelling people.  The guitar solo is so clean that you can almost feel your mind clearing up and emptying out all the dirty things because of it.  I know this is what was intended by the artist because I feel that emptiness everytime I listen.  You will need to turn up the volume though because the drums are so hard to hear.  I hope you will listen to &quot;Infidels&quot; and consider who you are and where you are.  Make sure you know the answer!
B0000069NM|5.0|Few albums are equally enjoyable while dancing, reading, or making love, but this is one. What's more, focused inspection reveals a handful of treats and treasures. I've always been a Scofield fan, but it took A Go Go to hook my wife. A strong introduction to a fabulous guitarist with a unique sound and playful rhythm. ... Oh, and the backing band - a la mode por la pie.<br /><br />Update: We listened to this album during the birth of EACH of our two children, at my wife's (indisputable) request, right through and beyond the final moments of birth. It was the perfect mix of energy and gentility, for those occasions as for so many more. Thanks intimately, John - you helped make something magical and beautiful, even moreso!
B000001AJG|5.0|I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS REAL!  I HAVE NEVER HEARD ANYTHING LIKE THS, NOT EVEN LYING FACEDOWN IN THE GRASS IN THE VIRGIN ISLANDS!  I THINK STEVIE WONDER MUST HAVE AMAZING HEARING TO COMPENSATE FOR HIS BLINDNESS BECAUSE THIS TRULY IS THE MUSIC OF PLANTS!  YOU CAN ALMOST SMELL THE GRASS!!!  HE IS REALLY LISTENING AND FOR US ALL THIS IS A WONDERFUL THING!  NOW WE CAN HEAR WHAT HE DOES!  THE USE OF THE SYNTHESIZER ON THIS RECORD IS AMAZING!  COMPARED TO FUNKY STEVIE WONDER FROM JUST LESS THAN 10 YEARS BEFORE &quot;SECRET LIFE OF PLANTS&quot; THERE IS SOMETHING SO MUCH MORE BEAUTIFUL AND SUBLIME TO THIS MUSIC!  I HAVE NEVER FELT SUCH THINGS IN ALL MY LIFE, EXCEPT MAYBE AT HIGH ALTITUDES!  GOOD FOR SLEEPING OR THINKING ABOUT MANY THINGS IN ONE'S LIFE OR THE WORLD IN GENERAL.  YOU WILL THINK SO TOO!
B0000560RV|3.0|When I read about this album, I was so fascinated that I had to immediately go out and find it.  Well, I found it, and it's pretty good.  That said, it's not exactly the kind of thing that is going to transport me to the next world.  Most of the other reviews hammer home the notion of 'beauty' on this album, and it really does have its moments of breathy, post-alternative smooth groove and lethargic bliss.  It's not really ambient in the same sense as ambient-techno or trance, but it is rather spacious.  It's the kind of album that sounds great when you're drunk or high out of your gord, and sprawled out on the floor in front of the stereo, just losing yourself in the big guitar effects and ridiculously cooing vocals.  And for that situation, you won't find many albums as good as this.  But for all its gooey transcendence, you can't say the music has just a whole lot of depth, and anyone looking for intellectual substance (or even good old alt-rock attitude) beneath the layers of treated reverb and pseudo-impressionism should probably look elsewhere (try recent Boredoms).  I'm not overly disappointed by the album (and in fact tried out my little stone drunk theory just last weekend!), but I hope Sigur Ros fine tunes their focus for the next album and releases the megabomb you can almost see coming.
B00000064G|5.0|Its ashame that so many people bought this cd and are now interested in nick drake because of the VW commercial.  If a given mood is peace, calm, and a bit of melancholy, this album is the ticket.  Pink Moon is a masterpeice made through shear struggle.  While suffering through Major Depressive Disorder, Nick managed to make an album that transcended his own problems, to reach the masses that cared to listen.  The sound is elegant and fragile. The lyrics are reminiscent of great romantic poets like wordsworth and shelley.  This album is for those who don't want to be hip because of a peachy marketing, but those who are willing to look into nicks other work and appreciate them on the same level.
B0000009S3|5.0|hot rats is a great album no doubt about it. it is even better than were in it for the nomey' but just, it also has a scarry photo of zappa(R.I.P) on the photo of the cover. there is six songs but they are all briliant, especially peaches, &quot;willie the pimp' and gumbo varations, green genes is very good too but the other two aren't that good. The best song on the album is peachs on reglia because of the melody ad instrumention. It is also a nice tune. Frank does a couple of great guitar solos, willie the pimp is a huge monamental solo and gumbo varations a shorter solo but very efective too. there is also some very efective guitar notes on the other songs, especially son of green  genes and the end bit of the camel song, a big long note like in oh no but even longer. however the camel song is quite an oddball arangement so its hard to like but its not as bad as everyone says. little umberelas is a nice tune and jazy  with some flutes played by the great ian underwood who played loads of the instruments. others players on the album include sugercane harriss(R.I.P) the great violiner . he has a monster solo on gumbo varations but even thought it is good playing it is a bit self-indugent and overstays its welcome by a few minutes,a hassle because we have to wait for it to finish to hear the guitar solo. the base player is called max benett and he has his moment of glory  on 'the gumbo varations' a punchy little solo before the tune ends. then we have captain beefhart on vocals on the song about willie the pimp. he sounds like howling wolf but he is white, he was a great friend of frank zappa and they worked on another album together in 1978 called 'bongo furey'. the lines he sings are very good, and 'hot rats' is one of the lines he sings on 'willy the pimp' and the album title. other trivia things to include are 1 it was recorded on 16 track , it was one of the earliest tracks to use this machine. 2 it is dedicated to dwezeel zappa who was born the day it was recorded. 3 it has john luke ponty on vilon too in an early apearance (another great album to check out is 'king kong john luke ponty plays frank zappa tunes' from 1969 including king kong and 20 small cigars and george duke on piano)4 it was zappas 1st real solo album without the mothers of invention. the only mother of invention to play on it is ian underwood who plays nearly everything else. 5 this album was a hit in holland. 6 lots of people who hate frank zappa love the album 'hot rats' because it is easy to listen too 7this is considred by many people as the best jazz-rock album in the history of all time 8 there were 2 more versions of peachs on reglia by frank zappa in different albums, fillmore 71 and tinsleton rebelion 1981 both live songs. (peaches III) 9.the same year frank zappa prodused captain beefhart and the magic  band in the trout mask replica. this is a wierd album with 30 songs, but it is a briliant album too. Frank even does some vocals on 'the blimp' and you hear him laughing. legend has it that captain beefhart  wrote every song in one day but this is feirsly contested by zappa and the band. but it is a great album some people say it is even better than hot rats its so good. 10. .....you should buy this album .thank you.
B0000508U6|5.0|This is candy for your ears.  Emotional sounding riffs, rich but subtle bass lines, and a singer with range beg comparison to The Church and Radiohead.  Don't expect much radio airplay for any of the tracks except &quot;Yellow,&quot; but this is an album worth buying; the only thing wrong with it is that the experience only lasts 40 minutes.
076783819X|5.0|Finally there is an action/thriller type movie where the plot does not depend on a machine gun to do all the talking. This movie has an original and intelligent plot, and has a great cast. It is a very dark movie, and in the end leaves an almost depressing and hopeless feel to it, but the message that it leaves is very true and very real. The plot is full of twists and turns, all unexpected, and Tim Robbins exucutes the role of a truely twisted character very well. Although this is a great movie, i can see how some who like to feel that everything is alright, and like to feel a sense of closuer do not like this movie, however it is a great movie if you can take it.
B000001FBS|5.0|I have been a fan of this band for 25 years and have always been disappointed in this album's lowly place in KISS history.  Between 1973 and 1978, KISS was completely devoted to hard rock music (much the way the Beatles were writing strictly 'boy loves girl' tunes in their early career). Finally, like the Beatles, it was time to mature and grow musically. Unfortunately, the bulk of the KISS Army turned their noses up at such growth. This was terribly unfortunate for two reasons: first, because those fans missed out on one of KISS's finest musical efforts ever. Secondly, and most tragically in KISS's history, it scared the band into never venturing off into musical growth and unchartered territory again.  As a result, we had the extremely talented Gene Simmons (writer of such very musical tunes as 'See You Tonite', 'Mr. Make Believe', and 'World Without Heroes') writing by-the-numbers crap songs about groupie sex on every album for the next 15 years.  What a shame, because KISS was clearly ready to write songs of lyrical depth and musical complexity as is evident on this terrific album. Unfortunately, KISS backed down due to major criticism and resorted to playing alot of generic-sounding, uninspired formula rock through the 80's and 90's. KISS's next album &quot;Creatures of the Night&quot; was the last great KISS album the band ever made. Listen to &quot;The Elder&quot; and enjoy what might have been.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I've been a hardcore anime fan for a long time now and have seen almost anything you can name and I must say that this has to be the best I've ever seen. Hayao Miyazaki is a great director and this is a masterpiece. One thing that makes this movie so good is that you almost forget its animation when you are watching it. A great movie for long time anime fans down to those who have yet to experience Japanese animation. BUY THIS DVD, you won't regret it. :)
B000002G87|5.0|This is a beautiful album - full of emotion, heartache, and angst, a rock album of this quality is a rarity in this day and age.  Eric and Dwayne are rock legends, and you too will not be surprised after hearing this album.  It's one of my top five albums of all time.  Not to discredit Jimi Hendrix (the Master), Stevie Ray, or others whom have covered &quot;Little Wing&quot; in their time, but Derek &amp; the Dominos version of this classic song on this album is glorious.
B000005IRG|5.0|This is one of my personal favourite albums, and one of the great rock albums. Not a bad song on the album, they're all great. There's so much to admire. The songs are simple enough but their is a lot of great playing. Especially the tom verlaine guitar work. Prove it, Torn Curtain and Marquee Moon are my favourite solos. The singing is edgy but effective. I don't have a clue as to the lyrics except for Venus, one of the verses refers to 'richie'-the original bass player ( i read about that one on a web site ). Richard Lloyd plays a dynamite solo on 'see no evil' and a couple of other good solos. There is some very nice drumming by Billy Ficca. And Fred Smith plays bass. Just treat yourselves people and listen to this great music. Thank you.
B0000029AP|4.0|This cd is great! It is an oldie but a goodie. My favorite song is &quot;Walk This Way.&quot; It is a great song to rock out to. Its a fun and entertaining cd altogether. I definately reccommend it.
B00000DQSZ|5.0|The case can be made that TEE is Kraftwerk's best song, although it doesn't really stand out on this collection of perfect songs.  Kraftwerk somehow analyzes the sounds of industrial Germany and spits out a beautiful, unhurried permutation of them.  One could construct a music appreciation class around this album alone.  Best if listened to on vinyl....
014100018X|3.0|This book is the story of Vianne Rocher, a single mother who is quite eccentric and opens a choclate shop in a very conservative small village.  The local priest is quite nuts and sees her as a disruption to his devout congregation.  There are lovely descriptions of chocolates and some surprising turns in this story.  A pleasant read, nothing too complicated. Don't read if you love chocolate and are on a diet.
B00004WC6J|5.0|I knew of Japan for years, but with no big interest. I obviously was missing out! The way I heard or re- heard the name David Sylvian was when I was looking about on Amazon. He was a recommendation on one of the list-manias. I looked him up for some reason and listened to the samples. Well needless to say I RAN out and bought the CD. It hasn't left my cd player for days now - if there is a heaven - this is playing on a loop
B00000JMQE|5.0|Not matter what anyone says...this is one incredible movie.  If you have ever read one of L. Frank Baum's Oz books you know what I mean.  The movie looks exactly how Mr. Baum depicted it one hundred years ago.  It is turn of the century chic.  I am well aware that the movie deals with some pretty dark themes and images;  a real movie witch in Mombi, Dorothy on the verge of getting refried brains, and those terrifying gnomes that pop out of the wall...but hey-that's life.  The actors in the film all turn it out!  What a great job!  Ms. Balk really works it in hyper drive, creating a great Dorothy.  Give the girl credit-she did have to follow Judy Garland!  I was so happy to see the return of the ruby slippers, and I was overjoyed with the special effects.  The Scarecrow, Jack, Tik Tok, and the Gump looked exactly how I pictured them when I read the books as a little kid.  It is amazing.Now if you have a DVD player, then pick this one up.  If not then buy it on VHS(widescreen!), cause this is one absolutely amazing and very touching film.
B00004WGAK|4.0|Got the Widescreen version of One Eyed Jacks from Diamond Entertainment a week ago. Its great for 6.99. No extras though but didnt expect any. Maybe one day Paramount will release it and it will be better but for now if you dont want to wait, get the Diamond Entertainment version.
B00003CXDG|3.0|Call me crazy but I'm one of the few people who actually liked the first Mission: Impossible film.<br />True, it was criticized by both audiences and critics for its supposedly confusing plot but the way I see it, good spy thrillers keep the audience guessing instead of revealing everything in the first 10 minutes.   But if MI1 suffered from too much plot, the opposite problem exists with MI2.<br />What little storyline there is here is utilized solely to propel Tom Cruise from one elaborately staged action sequence to another.   To director John Woo's credit, some of these scenes are breathtaking.   My favorite is the car chase between Cruise and Thandie Newton's jewel thief/love interest. This isn't a high octane chase as much as it is a tango dance with souped-up automobiles.<br />One can understand why Cruise wanted to make this &quot;Mission&quot; a little more audience-friendly and Woo was clearly happy to oblige.   But one of the film's biggest failings actually lies with those same action sequences.   Some of the fight scenes are so over the top they can't be believed.   <br />Call it post-&quot;Matrix&quot; fallout if you will but I'm a little tired of elaborately-choreographed fight scenes where the heroes perform feats of strength and acrobaticism that are impossible for anyone who isn't from planet Krypton.<br />You can accept that Keanu Reeves' Neo is able to leap horizontally 50 feet through the air while also firing his automatic. This is because a film like &quot;The Matrix&quot; establishes early on that most of its action takes place in a virtual world where normal laws of physics do not apply.   You CANNOT accept that Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt can leap 10 feet vertically from a motorcycle moving at nearly 100 miles per hour and collide with the villain without sustaining injury because MI2 clearly is supposed to take place in the real world.  In the real world, you try that, you die.  Pure and simple.<br />As for Woo, it's time to concede that Hollywood has spoiled him.   As enjoyable as this film or say &quot;Face/Off&quot; may be on a surface level, stack those films up to his Hong Kong movies like &quot;The Killer&quot; or &quot;Hard Boiled&quot; and they don't even come close.<br />MI2 is ultimately like most of Woo's Hollywood output, slick and fast-moving but devoid of complexity and emotional depth.<br />As for the DVD, on a purely technical level it looks and sounds great.  It's also loaded with enough extras that fans of the film will probably consider it a must have.   Most notable, is the hilarious sketch comedy sequence from last year's MTV Movie Awards and featuring Ben Stiller. <br />The huge box office this film earned pretty much guarantees there will be an MI3. But next time Cruise and whoever he picks to direct will need more than pyrotechnics to accomplish that mission.
B000000HTM|5.0|If I had arrived at my secondary school (Oundle) one term earlier -- in Summer '72 -- I would have been able to see Van Der Graaf in concert there.  (I believe they were doing it as a favour, as one of the band members was an old boy of the school.)  Of course, I wouldn't have appreciated much of it, but it's a matter of regret, all the same.  Within months, the band had disbanded.<br />I've known this record for 28 years, and my appreciation of it has shifted over time.  (It is even possible to get bored with parts of it, I swear, after about the thousandth play.)  The bits that first caught my teenage ear were the riffs, particularly that saxophone fog warning on 'Man Erg'.  But there aren't that many riffs - which is why I said that I wouldn't have enjoyed a VdGG concert much at the age of 13.  And you need to give this album several listens to begin to discover what it is about.<br />It was VdGG's most traumatic album, mixture of bad-trip visions with moments of blissful revelation.  The band had rehearsed the album, by the way, at a haunted house in Crowborough (England), which was used for the fantastic inner sleeve photo.  Part jazz, part classical, part psychedelia, it pushed recording and mixing techniques to their limits.  Phasing, for instance, involved running two stereo tape machines slightly out of sync by resting a heavy ashtray on one of the tape reels.  The mixing, according to Hammill, often involved six pairs of hands, so was effectively a live performance.<br />This is an extraordinary album, like no other on the planet, though I like to think that Radiohead's KID A and Talk Talk's LAUGHING STOCK were headed in roughly the same direction.  VdGG's other classic, GODBLUFF, is already deleted, so it's hard to judge how long any of their wonderful material will remain in the catalogue.
630414542X|4.0|Christopher Lambert and Sean Connery star in this interesting sci-fi/Fantasy story set in both the present and the past.  Conner Macleod of the Clan Macleod is a Scotsman born in 1538, and he cannot die.  He is an immortal, through the ages he has blended in with society to wait for the &quot;gathering&quot; when all the immortals will come together to fight for the prize.  The prize being master of the realm of earth.  It has an interesting prospect, but sometimes the film is bogged down by incredibly cheesy special sound effects, way too overdramatic.  When Macleod faces off against his arch-enemy Kerigan, or something, the swords make a way too overdramatic &quot;chinging&quot; noise when they contact.  Oh well, it could have been better.
0441172717|5.0|I give Frank Herbert's DUNE five stars not because I belong to any small group of overzealous supporters, but because it is honestly one of the finest science-fiction novels I have ever read.<br />DUNE combines the best of &quot;golden-age&quot; science fiction. (space opera, emperors, genetic supermen) with the technological believability of the 60's New Wave . Although Herbert's writing is plodding and stilted, the reader is ultimately kept reading to learn more about the byzantine politics of the Imperium and the wonderfully portrayed environment of the desert planet Arrakis.<br />Another reason the book deserves notice is because it is appealing to all ages, much like the works of Mark Twain. I read DUNE for the first time as a 10-year old and again ten years later, seeing the plot from a different angle but no less impressed with Herbert's world building.<br />Granted, a lot of people are going to be put off by the prose, but the plot machinations and futuristic-but-feudal society make the book fantastic. And the setting is extremely original. As the reviewer below pointed out, the planet is really the main character.
B000001DU5|5.0|When most people think of &quot;Tears for Fears&quot; what likely comes to mind is the song &quot;Shout&quot;, or maybe &quot;Everybody Wants to Rule the World&quot;, two huge 80's pop hits.  While I loved both of those songs, the band was far more diverse than that.  This CD is a collection of the bands greatest hits, and every track is worth the price. There is a wide range of music and messages.  Their early work, which includes &quot;Pale Shelter&quot;, and &quot;Mad World&quot;, both contain powerful lyrics at the heart of the duo's attempts at coming to terms with their childhood issues. The songs both still sound fresh today, nearly 20 years after being recorded.  &quot;Change&quot;, another song from that first album is typical 80s Rock and Roll, new wave style.  I especially like their later work including the soulful &quot;Woman in Chains&quot; with Oleta Adams sharing the lead singing, and the Beatles inspired &quot;Sowing the Seeds of Love&quot;. Another gem is the deep &quot;I Believe&quot;, a beautiful song.  Both Roland Orzabel and Curt Smith are talented musicians and have excellent voices, and the band has some other great hidden talent in Nicky Holland, and Oleta Adams, both of whom put out great solo discs. Overall, this CD is a collection of one of the high profile 80's bands best work.  Great music, with lyrics about a mile deeper than most of the new wave 80s fluff.

B00000I07R|5.0|Keep The Faith is the album that awakened me to Bon Jovi.  I can clearly remember waiting for the first track &quot;I Believe&quot; to begin and being completely taken aback at Jon Bon Jovi's soaring vocals.  This album produced very successful singles such as &quot;Keep the Faith&quot; and the amazing &quot;Bed of Roses.&quot;  However the song found later on the album is the true masterpiece.  &quot;I want you,&quot; although sounding very simple turns out to be a very poetic ballad.  &quot;I never wanted the stars, never shot for the moon...I like them right where they are, all I wanted was you.&quot;  This song has helped me through a number of hard times in my relationships.  It alone is worth the price of the CD.
B00000G3Q4|5.0|EVEN THOUGH IT WAS LOW BUDGET, THIS MOVIE WAS SO AHEAD OF ITS TIME. A BUNCH OF FRIENDS GO TO A CABIN IN THE WOODS. THEY FIND THE BOOK OF THE DEAD AND A TAPE RECORDING OF A RESEARCHER THAT WAS TRYING YEARS BEFORE TO DECIPHER THE BOOK. WHEN THE BOOK IS READ ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE!! THE WOODS COME TO LIFE AND A WOMAN IS ACTUALLY RAPED BY A TREE!!! IT IS VERY SAD THAT THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, WHO IN MY OPINION COPIED THE MOVIE STYLE OF THIS, GOT ALL THE HYPE AND MONEY AND THIS MOVIE ONLY OBTAINED A CULT STATUS. A MUST SEE FOR ANY REAL HORROR/GORE FAN.
B000007T1M|5.0|i have tons of CDs in my collection, but to say the least, this is the best CD i have. it has nothing to do with their onstage performance or how they sound so insane. it is that they are a political band that make up for the loss we all have suffered when Zach De La Rocha left Rage Against The Machine. Besides the awesomely twisted mind of Serj Tankian, the live show is awesome and they should be coming out with a new CD this summer. I CAN'T WAIT!!
B0000025RI|5.0|I know a lot of people say dr dre's album the chronic is the greatest rap album of all time but, i'm hear to set the record straight. Thriller is the best rap album of all time. It paved the way for other rappers like NWA,Snoop Dogg, and 2Live Crew.If it weren't for the greatest rapper of all time Michael Jackson rap wouldn't be where it is today.So go buy this album
B000002UAU|5.0|This Album Was A Turning Point In Music.Most Rock Bands Were Influenced By This Album.And I Can See Why.The First Song'Sgt Pepper'is pretty good.its a good intro.the next song is 'with a little help from my friends'one of the cd's highlights.'lucy in the sky with diamonds'is fantastic.the next9 songs are very good.and the closing track 'a day in life'is tied with 'lucy...' as the albums best track.it also has a quite surprising and unexpected ending.
B00004STPT|5.0|This soundtrack has got to be the best in the last decade. I don't fore-see this soundtrack being surpassed in the near future. The music is very touching and takes you back to the movie,(assuming you've seen it),reliving every moment of sorrow and struggle. The &quot;Gladiator&quot; soundtrack is well worth your money, it should be the next CD you buy. Believe me, you will be more than satisfied.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|even though you have heard the songs contained on this cd hundreds of times, make that thousands, the songs sound as fresh and new as when you first heard them. from the opening track love me do, with lennons ecohy harmonica, the magic comes back. the remastering is one of, if not the best, i have heard. this can be heard especially on love me do, lady madonna, i wanna hold your hand, penny lane,let it be, and the long and winding road. this new sound and 27 songs on a single cd make this cd a bargain. remember, this is not a greatest hits collection, just there no 1's, but to hear them all on one collection in order of release, it is a showcase of their growth as musicians and lyrists. great sound, great music, great bargain.
B000056VIY|1.0|I think this a awsome album because it show where the hispanics heritages will go and will be.  I think this is the beggining of a good feature for j-Lo
B00003CXBK|5.0|I am NOT a fan of Japanese animation. Sure, the pictures look great, but can ANYONE truly explain such &quot;immortal works&quot; as AKIRA and GHOST IN THE SHELL?  These films seem to be extensions of comic books, and, while flashing beautiful animation, completely avoid the hassle of telling a story.<br />That said, PRINCESS MONONOKE is NOT your typical Japanese animation. This film tells a simple fairy tale, in a not-so-simple manner.  With excellent action, beautiful renderings, and a complexity of character that few American animations have ever approached, MONONOKE assaults the eyes and mind of the viewer. Even the English dubbings don't get in the way, although I do recommend watching both the English dubs AND the Japanese just to experience the differences.<br />As much as I have wanted to love this genre, I have never found anything nearly so good as PRINCESS MONONOKE. It is a freakishly well-done exception to the norm, and is, in fact, one of my favorite films. Even if you hate the stuff, see this film.
B000050XEI|4.0|This is Enya's most earthy-sounding release (to contrast her spaciest one, Shepherd Moons), reminiscent of a garden party.  Perfect production and vocals (a little too perfect for some), the main flaw is the bit of predictability, (also found on the former The Memory of Trees).  The lyrics are sometimes about more down-to-earth topics such as relationships to alternate with the more recently typical \\"stars are shining ... follow your dreams\\" types of sentiments, but much of the latter in some spots (and due to the shallow surplus on her releases anymore) has definitely hit the unsatisfactory limit of \\"Hallmark card\\" appeal for me.  A Day Without Rain is a quick listen, but certainly worth it to me for ONE BY ONE and LAZY DAYS.
B000056VIY|4.0|I really like J.Lo.  The music is upbeat and fun.  This CD is  just as good if not better than her first cd because it has better sounding Latin music.  It is a really good workout cd.  The upbeat tempos keep you moving.
B0000020C4|5.0|I love Les Mis and thanks to this CD I found it!  It has the best of the people who performed it and the video is great!!
B000051VWW|3.0|Sade's sound is soothing indeed, but she needs to do something about the steel guitar strings you hear in a few of the songs. Every time I hear the guitarist's fingers scratch down the strings, it makes me want turn the CD off. There are many good aspects about this recording, but I just had to voice my one concern that keeps this one from being a great work to my ears.
0553106635|5.0|When reading the books of George R.R. Martin, one gets the impression that he planned every detail, every chapter and event from the beginning - how else to explain such absolute genius in plotting and structure?  I was left shaking my head many times in disbelief as Martin upped the tension even more, all the while seamlessly resolving loose ends from the first book.  Also interesting is the way he uses parallel events in 'A Storm of Swords' -- weddings, trials, betrayals, to name a few. This book is, however, one of the most depressing I have ever read: 'Storm' is relentlessly brutal and almost agonizing to read in places.  The reader struggles on, not knowing if his favourite character will survive another chapter.  Every character, from nameless inkeeper to prominent protagonist is expendable, it seems, which actually lends the series a sense of danger not to be found in other fantasy.  Quite recommended - but be forewarned.
B00005214X|5.0|Some odd years ago during the Beatles &quot;Anthology&quot; mania, George had done an interview with Billboard magazine where he first boasted of the &quot;reissue&quot; project and a new studio set (!) to be jumped on.  Well, I waited... and I waited...and it's finally here! Well, it took me three weeks to get (a lot of the stores I shopped at just didn't have it, the small stores did go figure...) anyway...it was worth the wait! The sound was gorgeous, the intro of &quot;I'd Have You Anytime&quot; was pristine, I asked myself how did I put up with the original cd release I bought years ago? &quot;I Live For You&quot; was good...I found the other bonus tracks to be quite nice as well.  I wasn't overly impressed with &quot;My Sweet Lord 2000,&quot; I guess Beatle baby liked his original.  Yes I am a big time Beatles fan.<br />Okay, George said the rest of the catalog would be forthcoming.  I am envisioning or hoping that the single &quot;Bangladesh&quot; and it's rare flip &quot;Deep Blue&quot; would appear on the reissue of &quot;Concert For Bangladesh...&quot;  It would also be good to hear more of George/Eric Clapton's work, As we all remember, Eric had just come out of his &quot;plunge,&quot; and the rest was history for Slowhand. The &quot;Living In The Material World&quot; cd should also be a treat, reissue yes...let's hear the &quot;Miss O'Dell&quot; flip side on CD...it's a riot.  The &quot;Dark Horse&quot; reissue needs to have the flip side &quot;I Don't Care Anymore&quot; plus more of George's work with the LA Express  (what a band they were!!!) &quot;Extra Texture&quot; definitely needs sprucing up on sound quality...when George moved to Warners the sound did improve as years went on.  When George recorded his &quot;Somewhere In England&quot; set, it was refused for release and Warner Brothers asked George to cut four tracks and put four new ones in...those four tracks should be released on some reissues now....&quot;Zig Zag&quot; and &quot;Lay His Head&quot; were two of them, they were on some flip sides.<br />&quot;Cloud Nine&quot; was a masterpiece, I don't know how you could improve on that, ditto for the first Wilburys album.  Yes, give us the stuff from the vault.  Collectors want it...and it puts the bootleggers off somewhat.<br />&quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; is a great premier for a novice on the music of GH...the album does have it's share of winners...bravo George!

6305949638|4.0|The acting, scenery, dialog, technical effects of this film deserve the highest of kudos. I only add my &quot;two cents&quot; as a cinema perfectionist.  One flaw grabbed hold of me and caused a slight distraction.  Because of my age and the area of my upbringing, ie. southern california, I know that the drive-in movie did not come about until 1949 and certainly not earlier in coastal maine.  So, the scenes at the drive-in should have been reasearched a little further.  Other than that, a very, very  fine movie.  Caine was supurbe, if, for no other reason, how he managed to supplant his delighful cockney accent with the new englander non-accent that he chose to use.
0743201140|3.0|&quot;Concentrate on talents, not weaknesses&quot; is a major takeaway the authors' first book, First, Break All The Rules.<br />Now, Discover Your Strengths deepens that message with a web-based inventory to identify basic talents. My inventory didn't reveal any surprising talents. Rather, it took personality traits so pervasive that I wouldn't even have identified them as strengths and brought them to my attention. I've already been able to use the information to understand my successes and failures in work and personal lives, and am using it to help craft my future direction.<br />The book itself is quite shallow. It gives you one page of detail on each of the major strengths, and one page of bullet points on &quot;how to manage someone with this strength.&quot; There's disappointingly little on how the strengths impact other relationships. How do I work with my BOSS? How do I work with my peers? How do I make my relationship work? How do I find someone with complementary talents (how do I figure out which other talents I *want* to work with?)<br />Though the authors say that it's the interaction between different strengths that create the richness, they don't spend much time delving into how strengths combine beyond a couple cursory examples. Certainly in my case, it's been the interaction between my strengths that has been most powerful.<br />The strengths are truly pervasive, and the authors limit their discussion to a shallow discussion and narrow application.<br />The book seems mainly an excuse to market the web-based inventory, which you're allowed to take only ONCE for each copy of the book you buy. You can't even buy more licenses without buying the book (a nice little trick to push book sales and probably get the book listed as a best-seller, when in fact all people want is the web-based inventory).<br />So while I'd love to loan the book to a friend, or buy licenses to have my clients take the inventory, the need to structure it all as the purchase of dozens of books makes the whole venture seem much less worthwhile.<br />The inventory gets 5 stars from me, the book gets two stars, and the marketing trick of one survey per book gets a whopping ZERO stars.dozens of books makes the whole venture seem much less worthwhile.<br />The inventory gets 5 stars from me, the book gets two stars, and the marketing trick of one survey per book gets a whopping ZERO stars.
B000058983|4.0|A little skimpy on extra stuff, (maybe the vaults were drying up) but it sounds fantastic. Very gratifying for those who suffered through the muffled sound of previous CD issues. The instruments are crisp, distinct and fly out of the mix amid a nourishing bass bottom. The best way to hear a unique, unsettling and ravishing album that is as fresh and fascinating now as it was in 1968. If you're unfamiliar with Forever Changes, words don't really do it justice. You really have to listen, but imagine an attitudinal street punk melodically crooning an individualistic, outsider's view of Summer Of Love-LA over complex grooves stuffed with gorgeous strings, Mariachi horns and lacerating '60s guitar, and you're close. A mood like no other.
B00000IAU3|5.0|5 stars......soulful, touches deep inside your soul you never thought you had!!!
B00003CWL6|5.0|I found this movie painfully real, and that's what makes it so good.  However, without Spacey and Beninng, the movie would probably be worse. We have to realize that there is more to the movie than a story - actors, director, screenplay writer, etc. When you're judging a movie, you judge all of that. I find everything in the movie phenomenal, and that's what earns it a five-star rating. There are plenty of movies out there that didn't make it just because they didn't have good actors. Do you think &quot;Casablanca&quot; would have been such a masterpiece if they went with a first choice for main actor(Ronald Reagan), who refused the role? I am not clear why would people who find this movie &quot;disturbing&quot; give it a one star rating only? Just because you a) pretend to not understand something; or b) understand, but choose to ignore something, doesn't make that bad ...
0767817710|4.0|Being that this film stars Russell Crown AND Leonardo de Caprio in their Pre-Megastar days, I feel that this film deserves another look from it's critics, maybe now you'll see it for what it is.. A Revisionist Setting his sights on the west, much like Sergio Leone and Robert Rodriguez, only their visions fared better Critically and at the Box Office.<br />It is a Daring Film from a Daring Film maker, The Acting is Top Drawer, with the 2 actors mentioned about as standouts. If you still haven't seen it, see it now, if you saw it and were displeased, give it another go.
0930289234|5.0|If you only read one graphic novel, make it The Watchmen. Great example of the New Wave of Comics - dark, psychological storyline, humanly flawed superhuman characters, and some great plot twists that take you on a great ride as the chapters tick down to the ending.<br />The artwork is stylishly done, not too experimental, but the real star here is the story of how several over-the-hill superheroes don their uniforms to discover the murderer of a fallen comrade. The subsequent discoveries about themselves and their former allies makes great drama, and the pacing is great.<br />If you're REALLY not interested in comics, you should try it anyway. If you hate superheroes, that's okay, it's not about that. And if you like graphic novels, superheroes, and a great story, then what are you waiting for? You've probably already read it. Read it again.
B000002P6R|3.0|Face Dances was the first album the band released with their new drummer, ex-Faces member Kenny Jones.  Mr. Jones was an excellent choice as he is a first rate drummer.  The problem with Face Dances doesn't have to due with Mr. Jones replacing Keith Moon, it's that the band was slowing down and the songs aren't as good as many of their other releases.  The decline started on their previous album, Who Are You, where there were several disappointing numbers.  About half of Face Dances is made of substandard songs including &quot;Cache Cache&quot;, &quot;Did You Steal My Money&quot;, &quot;How Can You Do It Alone&quot; and &quot;Daily Records&quot;.  That being said, there are some great songs as well.  &quot;You Better You Bet&quot; is a great song as is &quot;Another Tricky Day&quot;.  &quot;Don't Let Go Of The Coat&quot; is a solid number as is &quot;You&quot;.  The band was no longer consistently great, but they still showed flashes of their greatness.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Gladiator is a fantastic movie, the story, extra features (on the dvd) and characters are all great. It is a little bloody, so not for the squeemish. The action scenes are very well done. However this movie should not be used as historical reference, although the characters were all based or were real people in Rome, the events are false. The visuals are a true treat, and the soundtrack is one of the best I have heard. If you are unsure, rent it, but I would suggest buying it, because you'll want to watch it again and again.
B000002P2W|4.0|Who By Numbers opens with as good a one-two punch as any album in The Who's catalog.  &quot;Slip Kid&quot; is a defiant call to arms, in which the band rocks their way through their induction of soldiers into their war.  Pete Townshend was struggling with an alcohol addiction and &quot;However Much I Booze&quot; is an intensely personal account of his situation.  The song skitters along with some excellent herky-jerky drum fills by Keith Moon.  The rest of the album contains some other dealing with Mr. Townshend's demons like &quot;Dreaming From The Waist&quot; and &quot;How Many Friends&quot;.  John Entwistle again contributes another fine song in &quot;Success Story&quot;.  &quot;Squeeze Box&quot; was a big hit and one of the most popular of the band's career, but it's a little trite and not one of their finest efforts.  The album was their first since a Quick One that doesn't have a concept or common theme running through it and while it isn't as good as those albums, it is still a superb album.
B000002TQV|5.0|This is among radioheads best work. The guitar chourds in the start of (nice dream) are unbeliveable. The best songs on the album by far of my point of veiw and hopefully yours are High &amp; Dry, Planet Telex, Bones, nice dream and the one and only My iron lung.The Guitars are the thing that makes this cd so great.

B000002OVJ|5.0|The Who's Live At Leeds shows why the band is among a handful of the most powerful live bands in the history of rock.  The original album only contained six songs, but it was a forceful assertion of the band's power. The cd reissue adds eight additional songs and they give the listen a more complete picture of what a Who show sounded like in 1969.  Songs like &quot;I Can't Explain&quot;, &quot;Tattoo&quot;, &quot;Summertime Blues&quot;, &quot;I'm A Boy&quot;, &quot;Substitute&quot; and &quot;Happy Jack&quot; have a fire and passion that explodes out of your speakers.  The closing one-two punch of &quot;My Generation&quot; and &quot;Magic Bus&quot; is full, kick out the jams rock and the band shows that they could and would rock harder than anyone else on the scene.
B00004Y87O|3.0|It's been almost a quarter century since Halloween, and though John Carpenter has yet to recapture that success, he has been making some very entertaining movies since then.  Escape from New York is a perfect example of the kind of well crafted escapist fare he's been providing us for the past twenty-four years.  Teaming with Kurt Russell for the first, and arguably the best, of their collaberations it's a rock 'em sock 'em action adventure that's sure not to disappoint.<br />Russell stars as Snake Plissken, a reluctant hero who's hamstringed into making a daring rescue of the President of the United States (Donald Pleasence) after his plane crashes on Manhattan Island.  You see in the future crime rates have tripled, so to ease the overcrowding of our prision population New York has been quarentined from the rest of the country and used as a mass penitentiary to house the most violent offenders.  You can imagine the chaos it sparks when Air Force One is hijacked, taking a nose-dive on the Big Apple as the President winds up in the hands of it's savage occupants.<br />Adding to the tension, the President has twenty-four hours until a summit meeting aimed at ending a potential nuclear war with the Soviet Union and China. In short the fate of the world rests in the hands of an outlaw, Snake, and he's none too happy about it.  That's what makes him such an interesting character, that he's not your typical good guy but is cast in the role because of his Special Forces background.  To recruit him the secret service lodges explosive charges in his body which are set to go off right around the summit deadline, thus giving him the proper motivation he needs to successfully complete his mission.<br />After flying into the city, he lands on the Empire States Building and beging his search for the President only to discover he's being held by The Duke (appropriately cast in the role is the voice of Shaft Isaac Hayes).  He's called The Duke because he rules over his legion of followers as a king would, which goes to show you can find structure even in the most unlikely of places.  As he holds the Prez hostage in exchange for amnesty, Snake launches an all out war to retrieve him with the help of a former partner called Brain and his busty girlfriend, Maggie, whom he meets inside.  Together they hatch a hastily put together plan which inevitably goes array, as plans tend to do in these types of movies.<br />The action moves along at a swift pace, maintaining itself for the duration of the film, which keeps things pretty lively.  There's little chance you'll get bored here, though the special effects do look rather dated by today's standards.  The moody atmospheric tone is unsettling and should keep you on the edge of your seat for the hundred minute run time.<br />Adding a few laughs is Donald Pleasence who's always a hoot, you should remember him as Dr. Loomis from the Halloween movies.  As for Kurt Russell, his performance as Snake is one of the most memorable of his career, which naturally led to a less satisfying sequel titled Escape from L.A.  One of the reasons the follow-up was such a letdown was because in the original Snake isn't cut any breaks.  He's got to work his way out of every chase, fight his way out of every dark alley and think his way out of every corner.<br />Another reason I found this so refreshing is that Snake's not one of those sweaky clean action heroes bulldozing through pages of dialogue like they've actually got something to say.  Kurt Russell's character is more complex, and I suppose old fashioned, in the way he keeps to himself and isn't always chiming in with witty punchlines like we've become accustomed to seeing from the Stallone's and Schwarzenegger's of the world.  Trust me, it's a real treat.
B000002OX7|5.0|Who's Next came out of the failed Lifehouse project that Pete Townshend had envisioned as another rock opera and follow up to Tommy.  The cd reissue contains a couple of tracks like &quot;Water&quot; and &quot;Naked Eye&quot; that fit into the Lifehouse concept but not into the feel of the Who's Next album.  The resulting album is arguably the finest of the band's career.  It contains several anthems that have become classic rock radio staples.  &quot;Baba O'Reilly&quot; with it's barren synth filled landscape and rolling fiddle finish perfectly captures the song's view of teenage wasteland.  &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot; is a powerful, anti-establishment song about shaking up the status quo.  Roger Daltry's scream at the end of the song is one of the most famous of all-time and adds the right amount of anger and outrage.  &quot;Love Ain't For Keeping&quot; has a crisp acoustic guitar that Mr. Townshend plays as powerfully as any electric and &quot;The Song Is Over&quot; contains elements of one of the unreleased songs that appears &quot;Pure And Easy&quot;.  John Entwistle contributes another strong composition, &quot;My Wife&quot;.  The standout song on the album and possible the finest in their career is &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot;.  A deeply confessional and personal song, Mr. Daltry perfectly captures the pain and anger that Mr. Townshend filled the song with.  The song starts off quietly and slow and then explodes into a rant filled finished.  A true work of art.

B0000062FL|4.0|Abraxas together with Santana(I) and Santana III rate as essential listening. These three early albums highlight the latin rock/blues played originally by Carlos and the band. I heard Santana in this period in Australia and the live sound matched the recorded output. Black Magic Woman, Oye Como Va, the last part of Incident at Neshabur, Samba Pa Ti (live was unreal) in particular are magic. I personally think Santana III is best, followed by Santana I and then Abraxas.

B00003CXPC|5.0|Stephen Daldrys latest effort has no car chases, no explosions, no special fx, a minimal amount of naked flesh, takes place in the most unscenic of english industrial towns, is unbelievably sappy in parts and which has the dreariest looking cast of characters ever seen in an english picture since 'George &amp; Mildred'. So why I had to ask myself did I leave the theatre 10 feet of the ground feeling so good about myself and ready to give the human race one more benefit of the doubt.<br />This is unabashedly one of those feel good films of the year and dosent pretend to be otherwise. The simple plot of young working class lad with striking miner father who shows a penchant for the ballet to the squeamishness of his father and brother has been well documented by other reviewers better than me. The exceptional performances by Jamie Bell as the budding dancer and Julie Walters as the burnt out cynical dance teacher have received all the credit that is their due.<br />Undoubtedly the story is flawed in some parts to allow for heterosexual tastes. The scene that proves Billys straight as an arrow who just wants to dance to prove to homophobics that not all dancers are poofs. Just one minor complaint that dose not add or detract from the story.<br />Billy Elliot is up against some big guns at this years oscars. Gladiator, Traffic, Erin Brockovich are all commendable efforts which will receive their fair amount of kudos this year, and Jamie and Julie will no doubt lose out to Russel Crowe or Tom Hanks or Julia Roberts But for all that I still place it in the top ten of my personal best list. Its been a long time since I felt so good leaving a cinema...I dont want to lose that feeling.
B00003CX6P|3.0|It's as suffocating as it is breathtaking.  The direction is tight and enchanting; it's as if Minghella were filming each shot to make up an artsy slide show about his vacation to Italy.  Damon plays a psychotic so realistically that he forgets he's an actor playing a part...  It's almost too convincing, and there's no room in the script to compensate for it.  It's not a bad movie, it can't possibly be -- everything is handled so meticulously and obsessively that it would score perfectly on an aesthetics exam -- but it ends of draining the film of some of it's mystery.  Jude Law, Phillip-Seymore Hoffman, and Gwyneth Paltrow all give the performance of their careers.  And pay close attention to the scenes inside a night club, it's a true triumph in contemporary cinema.
B00004X01U|5.0|YET ANOTHER MASTERPIECE FROM THE ULTIMATE DIVA HERSELF.  IT IS AMAZING HOW WITH EVERY ALBUM SHE PUTS OUT, IT SHOWS HOW SHE'S GROWN, CHANGED AND MATURED OVER TIME.

1558908366|4.0|This is the kind of film that you should watch if you're in a stroppy mood. It will lift you up and raise your spirits. It's certainly no magnificat as far as movie-making is concerned, but it does have a charm about it. Julia Roberts is a tour de force as far as her role is concerned. There is no other actress who could've played her role with such vitality and vigour. Richard Gere is just as impressive - but what else could you expect from these two stars?  The soundtrack also makes this movie worth watching. My personal favourite is Roxette's 'It must've been love' - not only does this track characterise the entire film, but it also has an unforgettable imagery about it.
0679420401|5.0|I don't know how anyone could read this book and not give it a five star rating.  The true test for me of a &quot;great book&quot; is one that stays with me -- one I can't stop thinking about long after I've finished.  I read this book for the second time in my life a month ago (first time was in high school many years ago), and I'm still haunted by the suffering endured by the Joad family.  The interesting thing is that Steinbeck wrote this book in 1939 at the height of the injustices being fraught upon the migrant workers in California.  I'm sure it wasn't popular then as it brought to the forefront the corruption of some powerful people in America.  It also spoke to the conscience of every American which eventually led to political reform in California.  After reading this book, I did some research into Steinbeck's motivation and learned that he was haunted by the plight of California's migrant workers to the point of obsession.  To fuel his anger, he would visit the migrant camps each day full of their dirt, disease and hungry people and then return home to write about those people responsible for these conditions -- people he considered to be murderers.<br />Steinbeck concentrated on the circumstances of one family, The Joads, tenant farmers in Oklahoma until they were forced out by the larger companies who wanted their land back.  With dreams of luscious grapes and peaches in abundance waiting to be picked, they loaded up their belongings and began their journey on Route 66 headed for Bakersfield, California.  They began their trip with a bevy of colorful characters led by Ma and Pa Joad.  It's amazing how much power Steinbeck gave to Ma Joad -- years before women had any right to a voice.  Unfortunately, just as the Joads were heading out, so were thousands upon thousands of other families.  This would ultimately lead to supply and demand.  There would be too many workers for the few jobs available and, consequently, people would be agreeing to work for peanuts just to be able to feed their families.<br />Steinbeck's writing is astounding as the unrest of the migrants builds to a crescendo and just as the dust has risen in Oklahoma, so will the voices of the poor migrant workers.  Steinbeck says, &quot;In the eyes of the hungry, there is a growing wrath.  In the souls of the people, the grapes of wrath are growing heavy.&quot;  It is just a matter of time before their wrath is unleashed and you can feel it in every page you turn.  He says that, &quot;Our people are good people;  our people are kind people.  Pray God some day kind people won't all be poor.  Pray God someday a kid can eat.&quot;  I don't know how you can read some of his words and not get teary eyed.  But sixty years have passed since the writing of this book and there are still migrant stories to be told and kids who have no food to eat yet sadly the world continues despite its injustices.<br />I won't kid you into believing that this is an easy book to read.  The first 150 pages are so slow going that I almost had to put it down.  But I kept on going just as the Joad's kept on going and I'm certainly glad I did.  We could all take a lesson from their quest for survival and their quest just to be able to eat the next day.  Their determination, in light of all the obstacles they had to face, is truly a lesson to be learned.  You feel a sense of accomplishment after reading a book like this -- I know I did.ts just to be able to feed their families.<br />Steinbeck's writing is astounding as the unrest of the migrants builds to a crescendo and just as the dust has risen in Oklahoma, so will the voices of the poor migrant workers.

B00000IAU3|4.0|Like most, my first experience with Dido came as a result of the non-stop radio play &quot;Here With Me&quot; received.  As with many overplayed radio hits, I chalked the song and artist up as being one-hit wonders and wondered myself when I would get a break from this record.  Then fate intervened and I for some reason ended up buying No Angel.  Fate can be a good friend at times! This is truly a masterful CD.  Overall, the CD doesn't offer a lot of variety in musical disposition or attitude (it's a LOT of scorned lover music), but Dido plays her tune well.  <br />Radio overplay aside, &quot;Here With Me&quot; really is an outstanding song.  Other favorites on the CD include &quot;Don't Think of Me,&quot; &quot;All You Want,&quot; &quot;Thank You,&quot; and &quot;Take My Hand.&quot;  A jammin' CD, in my eyes, in one that can pack at least five amazing tunes--Dido does this and more.  The jewel in this CDs crown is &quot;All You Want.&quot;  The track spins a tale of a lover scorned by a cheatering man, but still trying to get him back.  However, the true beauty of the song is found when the last chorus section is broken up a bit by a change in the refrain (from &quot;All you want is right here in this room&quot; to &quot;All you want is right there in THAT room).  Okay--so I'm a sucker for well crafted lyrics, but the actual music is more than easy on the ears too.<br />Musically, I think her greatest risk, which also proved to be her biggest pay-off, is found in her final bonus track: &quot;Take My Hand.&quot;  This song is a mix of Rave, House, Chick Music, and intense feeling.  Be sure to hear this in the bars soon, and maybe even on the radio.  Overall, her sound is an amalgam of Fiona, Portishead, Sara McClaughlin, and [I hate to go here, but...] Jewel.  I cringe a bit in making comparisons, because their is something truly unique about her style.  In summation, it's more than worth a listen.  I have personally known NOBODY who has purchased this CD and been sorry about it.  I know I wasn't.
0553106635|5.0|The Starks words 'Winter is Coming' seem to advance in this volume. Winter and a Storm. I'm not sure though if the storm is one of swords, but many heads are chopped of or blackened by poison. It would be a disgrace for this masterpiece to betray who's heads, sorry..<br />Although some storylines sadly came to an end, I must admit that I have been laughing most of the time. No matter how dark the pages were: the humor got darker along. How? Well, Martin understands how to write from the thoughts and feelings of the character instead of his own. All characters are very distinct persons, not seperated into one pile of good and one of evil. They are different because of their history and life: even when the reader doesn't know all these facts. But things slowly become clear: in ' A Storm of Swords' we learn a great deal more on for instance: Lysa Arryn, Littlefinger, Tyrion, the Kingslayer and countless others.  Speaking about Others: They are coming......<br />One character makes this volume 'The One To Read': Jaime. He and his brother Tyrion (of whom we already knew he could slaughter a man with his tongue) are the most interesting fantasy-characters I know of. Things get really interesting when Tyrion meets The Black Viper of Dorne (read for yourself!).<br />I sincerely hope that the dragons will dance on Westeros soon. 'Hurry, and marry Lord Snow, Daenerys!' Only then we can sing a true song of Fire and Ice.

0790749815|5.0|After the galloping overture (and a brief glimpse of Cinemaestro Hitchcock missing a bus), we are plunged into the world of adman Roger Thornhill (played by Cary Grant) working out a last minute itinerary with his girl Friday.  &quot;In the world of advertising,&quot; he explains &quot;there is no such thing as a lie .... only expedient exaggeration.&quot;  He arrives at a dinner meeting with some clients, excuses himself to make a last minute call, and before he knows it is mistaken for a government spy named George Kaplan ..... who doesn't really exist.  Before he can comprehend what is happening, a team of thugs pour a fifth of bourbon into him and put him behind the wheel of a convertible headed down a coastal cliff, which he miraculously survives, but has to somehow explain to the police.  He has even more explaining to do later when, in his attempts to figure out why this has happened to him, he ends up pulling a knife out of the back of a U.N. diplomat in front of hundreds of onlookers and a press photographer.  Expedient exaggeration indeed ....<br />Hitchcock's North By Northwest basically set the standard for all suspense/action films to come out of Hollywood.  It is the perfect story of a man in an already barely-managable life being thrust into an out-of-control one, just by being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Before he knows it, he's a tool of a government agency, being used as a playing piece against espionage kingpin James Mason, along with romance interest Eva Marie Saint, reluctantly caught between two manipulative interests while trying to preserve not only his innocence, but his very identity.  In the course of it all, he has to evade a killer cropdusting plane (&quot;dusting where there ain't no crops&quot;) and high class thugs who chase him and his lady charge down the faces of Mount Rushmore.<br />If there is a theme, or moral of any sort, to this classic tale of intrigue and misplaced identity, it would have to be: when you are caught in the middle, which side do you choose?  Especially when neither side is overly concerned with your survival?<br />The digital transfer of this treasure of a film does it proper justice: it is like watching a new film set in the period (early 50's) that it depicts.  The Bernard Herrmann score crackles with energy and sounds best at high volume.  The restoration team is to be applauded for their efforts in maintaining the life of a film that feels still very much alive today, with its plot twists and subtly subversive messages about the manipulative nature of societal forces.  The main thing that set Hitchcock's work apart from other filmmakers of his time was its extremes of entertainment and thought provocation: his attitude, in other words.  Even in a lighthearted work such as this, you had something to take home with you.  Definitely a film worth owning.t in the middle, which side do you choose?

B00004WF68|3.0|Mr. Fantasy was an exception to the marketing ploy used by US record companies during the 60's. Most companies would repackage albums (a la the original US releases of both The Beatles and the Stones back catalog)and try to get more from less by loping off songs to create &quot;new albums&quot; (which is how the famous butcher cover came to be on The Beatles' Yesterday and Today). When Mr. Fantasy was finally released in the US (a month or so after its UK appearence)most of the weaker tunes by Dave Mason were cut in favor of the band's strong selection of singles. The net result was an album with 12 tracks instead of 10 and a rearranged running order that markedly improved the album.<br />The Mr. Fantasy CD shares the same basic flaws as the original album. Bill Levenson opted to release both the mono UK original and stereo US original albums separately. His decision makes sense as both albums sound remarkable different after their &quot;plastic&quot; surgery. Heaven Is In Your Mind (the US version of Mr. Fantasy) is the stronger of the two. The running order evens out the tone of the original album. The inclusion of Paper Sun and Smiling Phases only improves the album as both songs were catchy material. They probably would have made the original album if they hadn't been released as singles.<br />The sound quality on both these albums is spectacular and a surprising improvement on the the UK CD (which combined both the stereo Mr. Fantasy and mono release for Heaven is in Your Mind). While that CD benefited from 24 bit sound, the use of Sonic Solutions No Noise process homogenized the album. The result was an album that sacrificed the original album's sound for a technological sheen. Reissue Producer Levenson wisely chose to have this remastered and resequenced.<br />So you do get more for less although in this case it's an improvement unless you're on a budget. Levenson has added the mono tracks from the film soundtrack Here We Go Round The Mulbury Bush and the mono single mixes for both Paper Sun and Smiling Phases. The two albums have minor differences for example some of the mono tracks run a bit longer and feature slightly different mixes from the stereo ones (similiar to the Beatles' catalog up to and including the White Album). In fact, Mr. Fantasy runs longer than Heaven even though it has one less song on it.<br />I'd recommend picking up both for hardcore Traffic fans and those not on a budget. The only complain I have is with the liner notes; they are still full of mistakes (some of them unintentionally hilarous). I'm surprised they weren't corrected from the UK notes. They are still pretty informative without resulting to overkill but it would have been nicer to have an explanation as to why the UK and US versions of this album ended up so remarkably different (aside from the fact that Dave Mason had left the band by the time this was released).<br />Levenson made the wise choice of splitting these distinctive albums up and adding the bonus tracks. Levenson has also done an outstanding job on the band's second album (Traffic). The UK edition had some important bonus tracks (kept for the US release although they are the US mono single mixes)but the producers saw fit to include the Mulberry Bush tracks as bonus selections. While that was a nice extra (especially since they weren't on the Mr. Fantasy UK CD)they were out of context (as they were recorded prior to the first album)and don't quite fit. Levenson and his staff have done a terrific job in a very difficult field.<br />I'd still recommend HIIYM over MF as it is the stronger of the two albums.no single mixes for both Paper Sun and Smiling Phases.

B0000027I6|5.0|There are no much words to say about this CD, i only can tell you that Roger did it again. If &quot;The Pros and cons...&quot; was great in composition and Clapton´s guitar work; this one is excellent too, in composition and Jeff Beck´s guitar work. <br />Roger is still in perfect form. If you liked &quot;Pros and cons&quot; and &quot;The Final Cut&quot;, you will love this album.<br />This is the obligatory reference from Roger´s post PF era.
0688172377|5.0|Waris Dirie is from Somalia, home of some of the most beautiful women in the world, many of whom become supermodels like the famous Iman and Dirie herself. This book is a story of her desert semi-nomad life, the story of the horrifying practice of Pharonic circumcision of women that she suffered, and Dirie's escape from several oppressive situations ultimately to a better life.<br />The practice of female circumcision or FGM (female genital multilation) is not well-understood by Europeans and Americans. The practice, though not ordained by the Koran, is common in parts of Islamic Africa. It may have had tribal origins before some of the lands became Islamic. Dirie gives a blunt description of the primitive practice that leads to the death of many girls and to constant pain and suffering for those who survive it.<br />In addition to the story of FGM, Dirie also tells how she escaped her engagment to a man she didn't know, how she got to London to live with relatives, only to escape virtual enslavement and ended up working at a MacDonalds. From there, fame and success.<br />This book is written well, in a plain but well-told style. In addition to enlightening people about FGM, it tells a story of great courage.
B0000025ZF|5.0|This is one of my favourite albums, it contains all that i want in a recording. <br />Roger invited Eric Clapton to play the guitar, so, we have in this CD two of the greatest genius in the story of rock, Roger in the composition and Eric (as always) with an excellent guitar work. <br />The rest of the band was formed by (another genius) Michael Kamen, Ray Cooper and another talented musicians.<br />This is a must in a progressive rock collection, you will love it since the first time you listen to.
0440219078|5.0|The Giver, definitely qualifies as one the better books I've read.  It gives a very strange twist on an explanation for our societies imperfections.   Though the novel is never associated with a specific time period, it is a good implication to the way things could be later on.  I'm not a huge fan of Sci-Fi literature, but when you can finish a book in less than a day, you know you've found a good one!
6305428298|5.0|I'm so glad I rented this DVD!  This is such an endearing, charming little film.  Part of it is a very sweet (but not too sweet, if you know what I mean) love story between two very likeable characters, and part of it is the story of two rather shabby, not-so-nice characters who are still very interesting and believable--thanks in no small part to the strong performances of Michael Caine and Brenda Blethyn.  Jane Horrocks's singing is wonderful and the centerpiece scene of LV's triumphant performance really sparkles--I'm glad the sound quality on the DVD is so good.  The only slight negative to the film is that, as an American, I sometimes couldn't understand what LV's mother Mari was saying since her Northern English Cockney accent was so thick.  This was also true of the more minor characters of Mr. Boo and George.  Fortunately, on DVD you can turn on the subtitles feature for a quick &quot;translation&quot; into English!  I liked this movie so much I watched it twice in a row on the spur of the moment--it's only about an hour and half long.  To top it off, the ending is quite inspiring in an understated way and I plan on buying the DVD and making it a permanent part of my collection.
B000056N8X|5.0|This is the best movie of the saga of the Highlander. I saw it with many reserves because I've read many negative reviews but when I finally watched both versions of the DVD (on the same night) I was left with a satisfying and positive feeling. Adrian Paul was excellent, \\"Kate\\" (Lisa Barbuscia) is the best feminine character ever (in my humble opinion she is better than \\"Amanda\\" even) It was great to have those brief cameos by \\"Methos\\" and \\"Joe Dawson\\". Kell was a very \\"good\\" villain. My only complaint is that the make up department couldn't achieve a younger look for Christopher Lambert. This movie captures the same feeling and magic of the TV series. Kudos for the producers of this great movie!.
0743201140|4.0|Strengths Best Focus for Change<br />  The Gallup Organization (the pollsters) have been doing a systematic study of excellence for the last thirty years. They interviewed over two million people about their strengths and found that each person's talents are enduring and unique and each person's greatest room for growth is in the area of his or her greatest strength. Gallup's report, by Marcus Buckingham, author of \\"First, Break All the Rules\\" and Donald Clifton, is called  \\"Now, Discover Your Strengths\\" (Free Press, 2001).   When most people think of changing they focus on their deficits. This is usual to our culture, but not as helpful to our self-improvement as focusing on our strengths. The survey calls strengths the activities that we consistently do near perfectly, without much effort or thought. Strengths grow out of our talents, naturally recurring patterns of thought, feeling, or behavior that can be put to a productive use When these natural talents are combined with knowledge and skills, our performance is outstanding.   Most people don't know where their real strengths are because they don't think that whatever comes  easily to them is as important as what requires struggle. In fact, people often feel that \\"everybody can do that\\" when thinking about their talents. They don't realize how unique their own combination of talents, knowledge and skills can be. Others deliberately suppress their natural talent because of social pressures.  We can change our level of knowledge and skills, but if the natural talent is not there we will never be great at what we are trying to learn. Learning to do what we have no talent for helps us go through the motions, but can never help us give a great performance.   Talents are revealed by looking at what we yearn for, what we can learn most rapidly, and what positive activities bring us the greatest satisfaction. These areas are clues to our natural talents. \\"Now, Discover Your Strengths\\", guides the reader to a web site where a 30 minute questionnaire analyzes your instinctive reactions and tells you what your five most powerful talent themes are. This survey is an excellent way to clarify who you are and where you need to focus your energy. The book is aimed at business people but the web site test would be helpful to everyone from teens up.  Unfortunately, the strengths profile is only available one time to one purchaser of each book, a policy that discriminates against library readers or people who want their whole family to read the book and take the test. This policy feels mean spirited. I guess the policy makers didn't have the talent of &quot;fairness&quot; or &quot;inclusiveness&quot;. Nevertheless, the test results may be worth the price of the book.
0767819462|5.0|One of the films that launched Julia Roberts into superstardom as an actress.  Here's a situation that so many of us can relate to; children from a previous marriage are torn between their natural parent and a new stepparent.  This film has a wonderful blend of funny and heart-wrenching moments.  A precociously good performance is rendered by young Liam Aiken as &quot;Ben&quot;.  This is another film that has to be placed on the &quot;don't miss&quot; list.
0790729652|4.0|Tim Burton does an excellent job at updating Bob Kane's crimefighting superhero to the late eighties.  This film renders a much better description of the comic book dark knight than any movie or TV show released before this one.  Michael Keaton does a great job in his portrayal of our hero.  Jack Nicholson has had a long, distinguished, and enviable career in films; his performance as the supervillian Joker has been considered by many to be one of his best and most memorable.  Overall, enjoyable by the average summer matinee movie junkie.
630577241X|5.0|AFI's (American Film Institute) top 100 films in 100 years (1998) gave Charlie Chaplin 3 spots (Gold Rush 1925, City Lights 1931 &amp; Modern Times 1936).  An incredible accomplishment since these are Silent Classics.<br />Charlie Chaplin created the infamous &quot;Little Tramp (Derby hat, goose mustache, bamboo cane &amp; very large shoes with the shuffling duck waddle)&quot; character who starred in all but two of his movies.<br />Chaplin owned his own movie studio by the age of 22.  He produced, wrote the scripts, directed, starred and did his own stunts in his movies.  <br />With &quot;Modern Times&quot; add writing the music to his talents.  The eternal song &quot;Smile&quot; epitomized the theme of this machine age satire.<br />In summary this silent (digitally restored picture, sound effects &amp; musical soundtrack) classic &quot;Modern Times&quot; is a great picture to watch. Chaplin pokes fun at the industrial age of machine &amp; automation.  He believed the true motion picture was to be a visual experience not a talkie.  This was his message to the audience.  To challenge our ability to see the humor and drama unfold through his eyes.<br />One classic scene where Charlie is swimming through the large gears &amp; machine sprockets like taffy shows us the great imagination &amp; genius of Charles Chaplin.<br />Paulette Goddard (Chaplins wife at the time) plays the post depression poor girl.  Indeed his greatest leading lady.<br />This is the movie to experience the genius of Charles Chaplin.
B00003CXFU|3.0|&quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; is one of the three films nominated for Oscars that i have seen, and I don't see this one taking home the statue. Okay, so it was a true story, that doesn't make it a great film.  I guess my expectations were too high as I had heard that it was a great film.  Julia Roberts was good as the title character, but I had no sympathy for her.  It seemed as if as soon as Erin had a real job and was out trying to get PG&amp;E, her family seemed to not matter much to her.  This is just what I got from what I saw on film.  I am just very surprised at the academy this year, for including this film in it's nominations.  In my own personal opinion, I don't think it is deservant of it.  Nor does Julia Roberts deserve a Best Actress Nod.  There was nothing stunning or awesome about her performance.  It was decent. The movie is worth a rental fee, but i wouldn't buy it.
B000056N8X|4.0|OKAY, FIRST, THE MOST BLATANT MISTAKES. THE RULES OF THE GAME CLEARLY STATE THAT ONLY ONE-ON-ONE COMBAT IS ALLOWED. THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN EPISODE 1 OF THE SERIES. THE FLORING IN CONNOR'S ROUND ROOM RADIATES OUT FROM THE CENTER IN THE ORIGONAL MOVIE. IN ENDGAME, IT GOES STRAIGHT ACROSS LIKE CONVENTIONAL FLOORING. DUNCAN VISITS CONNOR'S RUINED ANTIQUI SHOP TEN YEARS AFTER THE EXPLOSION, AND THE BARRIER TAPE IS STILL UP, THERE IS NO DUST ON THE FLOORS,AND NO INDICATION OF VANDALISM IN NEW YORK CITY. LASTLY, WHEN DUNCAN IS SHOT, PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE SHELL CASINGS EJECTED FROM THE BAD GUY'S REVOLVER. NOT ONLY ARE THEY FROM AN AUTOMATIC, AND INCOMPATABLE WITH ANY REVOLVER, BUT THE PRIMERS ARE MISSING FROM THEIR BASES! FOR ALL OF YOU NON-FIREARM FOLKS OUT THERE, THE PRIMER IS WHAT MAKES THE CARTRIDGE GO &quot;BANG&quot; . ALL THAT SAID ,I STAND BY MY PREVIOUS ASSESSMENT OF THIS FILM. THE MARTIAL ARTS SEQUENCES ARE SOME OF THE BEST I HAVE SEEN IN MOVIES IN A LONG TIME, THE ADDITIONAL FOOTAGE ADDS TO THE ENJOYMENT AND ACTION OF THE STORY, AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS FILM TO ANY LOVER OF ACTION/FANTASY MOVIES. IF ENDGAME IS, INDEED, THE END TO THE HIGHLANDER SERIES, THEN MR PAUL AND MR LAMBERT HAVE LEFT US WITH A FINE PIECE OF WORK.
B000002J09|1.0|This mostly ridiculous and overblown record marks the end of Led Zeppelin's usefulness.  With only a few worthwhile exceptions, the tracks on this album represent the musicians attempting a level of art they weren't capable of reaching, and the results are spectacularly crass and mindless.  Yet, had the album been full of black dogs and rock and rolls, it would never have been able to offer all the public-friendly tripe that made it such a hit machine.
B00000K0DQ|5.0|Dead Man Walking is a rare gem of a movie.  Based on the bestselling novel of the same name by Sister Helen Prejean, three-time Nobel Prize nominee and noted death penalty activist, the movie follows Sister Helen's spiritual, philosophical, and emotional journey as she acts as a spiritual advisor to a prisoner on Louisiana's Death Row.<br />The film opens with Prejean accepting the position, not knowing what to expect, and continues with her harrowing personal journey as she meets the prisoner she has been corresponding with, the families of the prisoner's victims, and the lawmen involved both in his arrest and his incarceration.<br />Dead Man Walking isn't simple bleeding-heart propaganda, and truly shines because the film - like Prejean's wonderful book - refuses to take the easy way out.  Writer/director Tim Robbin's script gives equal time to both sides of this divisive issue, and trivializes neither by compacting tense, emotions into sound bites and bumper-sticker philosophy, which is what happens all too frequently in movies that pretend to be &quot;deep&quot; and &quot;meaningful.&quot;<br />Deciding where one stands on any philosophical and ethical issue is never an easy decision, and Dead Man Walking takes that path of discovery and truly gives it its fair due.  The film leaves the viewer with more questions than answers, but does take a rather anti-capital punishment stance towards the end, as the main character begins to from her opinions.<br />Dead Man Walking is as fine a piece of filmmaking as anyone can ask, with excellent preformances all around (Sarandon won a Best Actress Academy Award for her portrayal of Prejean).  The death penalty is not a simple issue, since it taps into some of our rawest emotions; it is one thing to sit in a classroom and debate, or form an &quot;ethic&quot; based upon reading a book, and quite another to face the person that raped and killed your daughter or son, mother or father, brother or sister.  This film is complicated enough to wrestle with that issue and come out as a shining example of the level of thought that can go into one production.<br />People expecting easy answers, propaganda, or re-affirmation of their point of view shouldn't watch.  Those who are interested in a layered piece of human experienced universalized, Dead Man Walking is highly recommended.d enough to wrestle with that issue and come out as a shining example of the level of thought that can go into one production.<br />People expecting easy answers, propaganda, or re-affirmation of their point of view shouldn't watch.

0192100300|5.0|Emma is basically a darling snob. She has a kind, loving heart, and really wants to do good, but makes a tangle of everybody's lives, including her own. I'm sick of flawless, shallow, empty heroines, so Emma's faults and conquering of faults endear her. The unabridged book is slightly complicated (such as old-fashioned language) but if you savor it slowly it is well worth it. The plot is clever, sweet, funny and leaves a satisfied, warm kind of glow in the pit of your stomach. The perfect ending makes you want to cry. Don't spoil THIS novel with any trashy sequels.<br />             TRY WATCHING the Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeremy Northam &quot;Emma.&quot;

0792151712|4.0|Despite the unimaginative script and mediocre acting, there is simply something about this movie that's enjoyable.  Perhaps it's the undeniable chemistry of its young leads, or the credibility of the disaster against which their story is set.  Overall, Titanic was able to live up to its commercial hype, and the compelling story of the disaster which could have been prevented is enough to keep me watching this video again and again.
6300273199|4.0|Why anyone would want to watch a roadcrew assembling a stage is beyond me but once you fastforward that, and get to the part where Bon grabs his beer before heading on stage, it is absolutley powerful stuff. He is a combination of Brian Johnson and Robert Plant in his heyday...a wild rock and roll throwback that lived for women and booze. He lived fast and died hard, and I truly believe he had no interest in growing old, so he was called home after a hard night of drinking. All AC-DC needed that night was a stage, and the music is raw and hard driving...the Angus &quot;show&quot; is highly amusing and he plays his tail off, while Bon sings his off....highly recommended.
0060245867|5.0|Laura J. Numeroff's picture book, If You Give a Mouse a Cookie, illustrated by Felicia Bond, is a classic for children.  The book tells the story of a young boy's encounter with a demanding little mouse.  When he gives the mouse a cookie, he unknowingly sets the mouse off into a tirade of requests.  Each demand is directly followed by another more curious demand.  The mouse asks for a pair of scissors for trimming his hair, to be read a story, to put a picture on the refrigerator door and many other odd things.  Eventually, the story comes full circle.  The mouse, thirsty from all the activity, asks for a glass of milk and you can imagine what might follow! If You Give a Mouse a Cookie is an excellent picture book for young children.  The plot is very appealing to a young audience.  It explores the world of &quot;what if's&quot; and presents experiences familiar to its intended readers such as being read a story and drawing a picture.  It encourages its audience to make predictions about what the mouse might demand next. Not only is the plot appealing to children, but the illustrators are as well.  The illustrations correspond beautifully to the plot and aid in developing the characters.  Although the mouse and the boy are not described within the text, we learn a great deal about them through their pictorial depictions.  The illustrations create for the reader a sense that hte mouse and the boy are both very friendly and warm, even if one of them may be somewhat demanding!  The plot of the story is also complemented by the illustrations.  Within the text, we are not explicitly told how the boy is reacting to all these requests, but we see in the pictures the exasperation and fatigue he is experiencing.  The illustrations also enhance the mood of the story.  The tale is very lively and fun and so too are the pictures provided by Bond. The colors utilized are bright and inviting and the lines are realistic, yet free. Numeroff's style and language are a perfect matchfor the children's interests and age levels.  She utilizes a good deal of repetition which young children tend to enjoy in a story.  Additionally, her vocabulary is consistent with that of three to seven-year olds.  Sentences are not too difficult, but do go beyond entirely simplistic construction providing children with language development opportunities. Overall, If You Give a Mouse a Cookie by Numeroff is a very worthwhile child's picture book.  It provides opportunities for children to improve their language development.  Additionally, it encourages children to explore possibilities and make predictions. However, it is most importantly an extremely fun and humorous book for a parent and child to share.
B0000026WD|5.0|To be straight this is a great album, his best no doubt, it's far more adult and agressive. almost all of the songs are very strong. The best include Give in to me,Keep the faith, will you be there and Jam, and the beautiful she drives me wild. If you don't like Micheal Jackson or you havent heard his stuff listen to this!

The rootsy, folk-influenced sound balances fairly well with the pop-type sounds as well as the beginnings of Lennon's delve into psychedelia and painfully obscure lyrics.<br />The highlights are all over the place, from the kick-start rock of my favorite cut, &quot;Drive My Car,&quot; to the Eastern-inflected &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; to the pop ballad &quot;Michelle.&quot;<br />Rollicking, quick-moving numbers take precedence on &quot;Rubber Soul,&quot; evidenced by songs like &quot;You Won't See Me,&quot; &quot;The Word&quot; (which is &quot;love&quot; if you don't know by now), and the bouncy &quot;What Goes On.&quot;<br />But soulful thinkers are also here, the most effective and beautiful of which is &quot;In My Life.&quot; Gently flowing guitar licks and a light backbeat make this one of the true pinnacles of the album. <br />This was the turning point in the Beatles' career. Like it or not, they would never be the same after this album. But both Beatles factions (the &quot;Hard Day's Night&quot; fans and the &quot;Come Together&quot; fans) could unite in their appreciation of this gem of a record.
B00003CXE7|4.0|There's lots of spectacle here, and a reasonably compelling story dealing with honor, love, and revenge. Joaquin Phoenix is outstanding as the villain, and certainly deserves his Oscar-nomination. <br />Yet, I must say that when I saw this film last summer, I ate my popcorn, enjoyed the picture, then went home and quickly forgot about it. The film did not linger, and I had no desire to see it again at the theater--possibly because I followed it up with BEN HUR, an infinitely better Roman epic. <br />GLADIATOR is undoubtedly one of the year's best, but if the Oscars are just, it will not beat CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON... which is, quite simply, one of the finest films in the history of world cinema (AND which has far better swordplay).
B0000524E5|5.0|I thought this movie was not only entertaining but gave a great message to everyone especially young women trying to make it in the music buisness.  I really liked the moral that being portrayed in this film.
B000056K04|5.0|Well, I must admit, after hearing the first single, i Did it, back in january, I was less then enthused about the new album.  However upon hearing the whole album a couple weeks ago, I must say I was totally off.  Be prepared, it is a new sound for the band, however you can sense the fun they had in making the album.  The tracks are short, but there is a tremendous amount of music packed into each song. Its hard to pick a favorite song off the album because they are all too good.  There is a fullnes about the songs. Some fans may like it and some may not, but as a long time fan of the band, I must say I think its some of their best work yet. Cant wait till this summer! Peace love and dmb - Happy listening ya'all - Kat
6303471714|4.0|This is the only workout tape I've seen that actually got me enthused. She is realistic because she knows you can't be able to do all the things she does the first time out. She rests and drinks a lot of water between sets which is good. I would definately suggest this tape for a beginner.
B000000H3W|5.0|I picked up this album the other day at my job because I was looking for something different. I had heard of Sepultura before but never any of their stuff so I thought what the heck. From the opening drum beats of Arise, I was sold. The band kicked out song after blistering song. And the drum work was phenomenal; something you would expect from Dream Theater or Blind Guardian. This baby has it all; speed, ferocity intensity and even a little melody. And in the realm of thrash, rivals Reign in Blood. So don't hesitate, buy it today.
B000056K04|4.0|Being a DMB fan for some years now, I, too, was apprehensive about the new sound.  But, I was first in line to buy the album nonetheless.  DMB's new produducer, and thus new sound is not the easiest thing to swallow for the typical fan.  Obviously, this CD does not have &quot;#41&quot; or &quot;Ants Marching.&quot;  After taking this CD home and giving it a quick listen, I'm not going to lie.  I was disappointed.  The songs seems like they were looking for way to end at 4:30 minutes so they could get play on the radio.  I thought that Dave had sold out.  BUT, after listening to it more today, I have come to appreciate the new sound.  While, I'll still listen to his older albums for his older stuff, I'll surely keep this one in my player for some time to come.  If you are a &quot;TRUE&quot; DMB fan, get this album!  But, I'll warn you, you may have to listen a couple of times to appreciate the new sound.
1558216847|5.0|Without a doubt the most amazing story of human survival and endurance that I have ever read. The only story that comes close is the crew of the Endurance shipwrecked in Anarctica for over a year and the subsequent boat trip by Captain Shackleton. I cannot recommend this book strongly enough. It is a stirring reminder of the stark difference between the men of their generation and the men of ours. We are such collosal wimps! These men were amazing, and you will be staggered by their courage and strength.
B000002LQR|5.0|This is one of the most listenable CD's in my extensive collection.  Every song is well-crafted, funky and easy to groove to...highly recommended.
B000005PRX|4.0|Same dark vision and atmospehre as the 1989 original, but the cast of characters is somewhat different. I liked the first one a little better. But the little penguins, with rockets strapped to their backs, are awefully cute and give this movie an extra star in my book. Everyone delivers are solid performance in this one. But I don't know, if I find any of the characters likeable anymore, maybe not even Batman. It seems too much like a comic book (which is of course the source of all this: characters seem to be interested only in fighting each others.
044022165X|5.0|This is the first book by John Grisham I have read. This book has well deveolped characters who are so easy to love and hate that it seems as if Grisham is writing from his own experience.You grow attached to them as if you they were close childhood friends. This novel also has a well formed plot. The setting in Memphis, Tennessee is so vividly described that I could feel the mid- July sun beating down on my neck. After finishing this book I ran out and bought &quot;The Street Lawyer&quot; which also promises to be another work of art by Grisham. Over all this book is really worth the time spent reading it. I strongly recommend you buy this one it makes a great addition to any bookshelf.
076783819X|4.0|The acting in this film was first rate, natural and believable. As a college professor myself, I bought the character played by Jeff Bridges, whereas in most other movies the actors who portray intellectuals come across just pathetic. I bought Tim Robbins' character, too. The ending of this film is the major element that sets it apart from the happy-go-lucky standard Hollywood servings. I did not buy the FBI character, the partner of Bridges' slain wife, he comes across as a stereotype. I recommend this movie.
