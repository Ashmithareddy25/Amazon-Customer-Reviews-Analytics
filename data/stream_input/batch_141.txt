B00OU67Z80|5|I am very please with the powerful light output of this item!
B00R1T74NE|5|Matched perfect with my cars paint...and it is 20 years old
B000O3RSK8|5|ARP bolts and studs are always top quality, very fast shipping!!
B00CO2MKJQ|5|good fit, heavy duty material
B003UWY4C0|3|I'm looking towel they make its hard  ithink the. Tad 103 is great 😌😐😏😎😍
B003UT5VKW|4|2 year old Toyota with grey cloth seats.  I seemed to have to go over, and over and over again to remove the lightest of stains.  Had better luck with Blue Corral upholstery aerosol spray.  I am happy with the end result but, hands are blistered and shoulders hurt.  Not sure if the product worked or I worked harder??
B00HD9VV8Q|5|No issues here. Installed it with ease. Have had it for a few months now and can't complain. Looks identical as my passenger side mirror.
B004YTP062|5|fit perfectly
B002UCYRYQ|5|great
B008JCW9GY|4|All pull no push?
B00280B5W2|5|Good product that performs as advertised.  I have purchased these before and have never been disappointed.
B00EINJIF8|5|OK
B001P11SCM|5|I am just writing this review now (8/07/2015) although I have had this brake in my truck for over 3 years.  Still works great.
B00DYSDSJU|5|Excellent.
B00PWW6RNU|5|I'm pleased with my tough seat covers that fit tightly on my front '02 Chevy Silverado pu seats.  Only difficulty was getting the head rests off to install, and that was a Chevy issue!  Definitely better than any I was able to find over the last several months in stores.
B00JBQR1N8|4|Bought this replacement because my original sustained a crack thus leaked fluid. This was an exact fit. Installation was fairly easy. It came with a pump, 3 feet worth of hose, and low fluid indicator. A competitive price in comparison to others.
B004JB0K38|4|They came fast and look cool, I had to open up the holes a little to make them fit properly.
B00GIER7GM|5|Traveled 2300 miles round trip with 4 Harleys in an enclosed trailer. This product performed just as it was stated. All made it safe & undamaged.
B005RR3NI2|5|Really good lights. Lights work well & gave my car a really nice look. Gets lots of compliments
B005EMOPU0|5|Fit perfectly in my 2003 X5.  Works just as well as the original, which broke, likely due to metal fatigue which is an issue with the original carriers in these cars.
B006QH552E|5|GREAT PRODUCT FAST SHIPPING 5 STAR QUALITY
B000BROATE|5|Perfect
B0010GFRP6|5|Worked great and solved the emissions code problem.
B000COS0PG|5|Good product
B0002Z9NFG|5|Rajah dat
B008R08SM2|4|The gusset prevents the seat cover from separating but some sort of grommet should be considered to limit rain into the backrest bracket cavity made on installation. It is pretty important to cut the foam at the angle to attach the support brace underneath. I'm not a very experienced hobbyist and would say this was perhaps 3 in difficulty on a scale of 5.
B009F10S3Y|5|Nice and easy install.
B000KITSMI|1|Doesn't fit 2001 ford explorer.
B000CQOIT6|5|It was perfect.
B00XZ70V5O|4|These fit really well and look really good.  Thick heavy plastic and it looks factory.<br /><br />I took off a star because one hole on each side didn't line up.  This isn't a big deal because you can drill holes easily.  Just annoying; but read the forums and you'll see everyone has this problem with these liners.  They are still super heavy duty and cheaper than factory.
B00J5SYMI4|3|Love it for cheap do the same thing  than the over price ones
B004NBCAMI|5|Exact same product sold in the national auto parts store for two thirds the price.  No issues.  Repaired the AC myself and it works great.
B00CNXMUL4|5|Beautiful and well made!
B00BDO48XM|5|This is a product I love to hate. There, I said it. It's a pain to work with. It's tacky, a bit sticky and a tad hard to remove. I've tried all methods and it's just a fact of life with this product. Why 5 stars you ask? Because it's worth the pain of putting it on. It makes paint shine like crazy, it soaks into rubber trim and protects it very well and last but not least, nothing can stick to it. It's the most hydrophobic product I have ever used. I'm talking, drive in a nasty rain and when it stops raining, it'll look like you just washed your car. The durability has been about 4 months for me, give or take. If you're willing to use a little elbow grease, you'll reap the reward. I'll continue to buy it.
B004NOSXN0|3|The brush itself is fine. It serves its purpose. However, if you are going to sell an item that may be different than what is shown in the picture used to sell the item, you should let your customers know. If I buy something depicted in an image as being black, but know that there is a chance I may receive something that is lime green with pink hearts all over it, I won't feel quite so deceived. Also, get your sh*t together and learn how to properly package things. The box arrived totally destroyed, bent and crushed so much that there was a hole in the cardboard on one side. A single crumpled piece of brown kraft paper was in the box - utterly useless. The other item I purchased with this brush was in the same box. With almost nothing between two two items, they were not protected from one another. I essentially purchased a new brush with already bent bristles.
B00540GOMY|5|Great product wished the instructions were a little more clear but otherwise very pleased!
B001P11SCM|5|easy to use had no trouble when towing trailer
B002OUPFOU|5|looks good on my vintage camper
B00Y1960C8|4|Wish it had more versatility to make it more custom for our vehicle but overall, well worth the money spent.
B00JH25QY2|5|Yup.
B001RM9YKW|5|work great  was easy to put in car is running smooth thanks.
B002YQV18S|5|Awesome, great, love it
B00696Y74O|5|Perfect solution to a really frustrating problem. The old VW TDI's accepted a large truck stop nozzle, not any more. If you try to fill at the random fuel station without this device you will get fuel all over the ground. Good item.
B004QHI7NK|3|Had to send back.Not what I needed.
B000CM0WU4|1|Indicated I wanted a passenger mirror. Things do not appear classes than they are. It's a driver mirror. Used anyway. Read fine print .
B009EABAVA|3|The mirrors fit perfectly but the images in the mirrors are slightly distorted.
B00E5PYUXE|5|I bought my first set many years ago and fell in love with them the first time I used them. Excellent on a trip.Also works great on my daughters booster seat. Keeps her safe as well as keeping the seat belt from rubbing her neck. We don't get in the car without them. Keep one in my purse at all times to use when riding with someone else.
B000WYAQFI|5|Works great.
B004LH8COO|5|Good deal, and nice service, cant ask for more....
B007K23WEW|2|Had to drill weep hole to drain water out of lights
B0031I2SMQ|5|We could not be happier with the new brake job. The rotors are smooth and easy to install. They arrived quickly and in great condition. Happy to have saved so much money by doing brakes at home.
B0037AICKU|5|Just like the original. Would recomend
B0052SF0LO|1|Bought 4 units,2 quit working within 2 months.
B0035RZ280|5|Works great!!!
B006H34BUY|5|My dad told me many years ago that you should always have a good duster in your car. That way, when you're stopped, you can always keep your dash area clean and sparkly! This is perfectly made with good materials. Therefore, you want to get two of them to cover your house and car... You won't be sorry!
B0009GZNHA|3|Very close fit but feels rather flimsy compared to original OEM filter.
B000C5CEKC|1|This doesn't lock in place. Checked...then checked again to make sure it would fit my car. Then I spent 2 hours with 2 other ppl to see if I was crazy. Nope...just a piece of junk.
B0076QWIB0|5|Works good and was easy to install
B001PP4TY2|5|Thank reached and wonderful Diablo<br />Fit Grand Cherokee 2015
B00O99SAOG|5|This set made my jeep look awesome! Great customer service from the company. I would recommend this item and seller for sure!
B004RNR9QY|4|I bought two of these for myself and for my mom. All 4 kink badly, but I expected that for a drinking hose. They are lightweight and easy to connect.
B0041MTABS|5|Product was fair priced and delivery met my needs
B00C1YI2XA|5|WOW these are INCREDIBLY bright.  I mounted two of these inside a 4x8 box trailer so I could see inside when working at night, it's practically like daylight inside now.  VERY happy with the purchase.
B00JEQLM1W|2|Too small in the way it is built.  The Bluetooth didn't work at all even when charged.  The helmet itself sounds like a jet engine when you ride with it on your head.  I would recommend to anyone buying a helmet especially for the first time to go down to the store and get a helmet that fits you correctly.  That way your comfortable and protected...
B001GS0D8Y|5|I ordered this for my cousin in New York where it rains and snows and to say the least he loved it. I live in the desert so personally it would have no real use to me other then it being a fancy thing to add on the car. Aside from that, the product came as advertised and it fit his 2014 Ford Edge Sport very nicely. It made the car look sharp as well.
B000J43EKU|5|Little awkward when opening and rolling it up. Fits windshield nice.
B000CZ34CO|5|Worked out great
B003IDH2IE|5|Great
B009S9RURU|5|Arrived on time.. Looks great
B001UCGHZ4|5|Very good item strong compressor
B000K03VX8|5|Be warned, you might have to use a C-Clamp to push in the brake piston before these will fit. Had to purchase one and push the brake piston on my car back with a piece of wood.<br /><br />Mazda 3 2011.
B003BZD08U|4|does what it is supposed to do
B00DM9XH3I|5|Will continue to buy it next time.
B000C2WF9A|5|fit my 2011 ford fiesta
B00NS6W5H4|5|As advertised, shipped and delivered on time. Perfect fit.
B006TMKB98|5|Perfect Fit
B000RN2AHQ|5|bigger than i thought, sturdy and padded. Magnets could be better however
B00G1Y3B3W|5|Awesome levers
B00SGFZCTA|5|Very nice for the amount you pay.
B004A0AFM4|5|worked perfectly...Installed in 5 minutes....
B007ZLLJUM|1|To big for my foot :(
B004ZF3KA8|5|WORKS GREAT EASY INSTALL!
B000BZ6VUC|5|Good Product, Nice Fit
B003XNGLJU|3|It is hard to tell if it works effectively but so far I haven't hit another deer.
B004I0XLRW|5|The original Toyota replacement was $140+ on the ones I could find.  This one was $40.  At first I didn't believe the face was glass due to the price but it is.  The beam pattern is slightly different from the original.  I recommend replacing both headlights with the Depo if you are going to replace one, in order to get consistent lighting on both sides.  Seems to be good quality with very little difference to the original, other than the beam pattern.  It seems to extend further out than the original.
B00PQZPMYI|2|Said it also fit a Prius . . and a Ford truck (from another review).  And I have to install it using scissors to cut out holes.
B00XWEMX1K|5|awesome product.
B005FG5V3K|5|Looks just like the original.
B00513G82U|4|This trunk works fine and the most important think is my wife loves the back rest.  Make sure you check all bolts and nuts.  I lost the top of the hinge in the first 50 miles as the bolts weren't tight from the factory.  I notified the seller and 2 days later I had a new part at no cost.  These are good people that stand behind what they sell.
B00W46BAI4|5|Very easy to apply to the car window
B00B7M1MAW|5|The mats came a bit slow, but they are a perfect fit and match the description listed. I would buy from this seller again.
B000C9LOHW|5|Perfect fit for my 2008 Chevy Silverado 1500 flex fuel. No leaks (knock on wood)
B008BWGK6M|3|Screws are a bit short and rusted after one year. After 1-year the bike rack has worked well. Will be replacing hardware with stainless steel parts.
B00O6WPVXY|5|Works great - just make sure that you you remove old seal on base of primer pump house or it won't fit. duh.
B00KTHZUJU|4|Great spare key - doesn't replace original
B000B8LKZ0|4|this product fits great and is just what we needed to finish the job!
B004VLEBD6|5|Came fast, was about the same price as other websites, and after a few months of being on my MDX I haven't noticed any deterioration or abnormal wear. Ride improved a LOT after replacing my 180k mile original set,
B001445IZ8|5|Followed the You tube instructional video regarding cutting tube to the correct length as well as running motor to bring up temp of oil prior to extraction and it worked perfectly for my Jeep JK 2013 3.6L.
B005NLQAHS|1|Despite the manufacturer's claims, the product is just as unreliable as the ones based on the defective China chip.
B001S4OYZE|5|Well, what can I say? The injector works perfectly, nothing wrong with it.
B00KGIDA12|5|Perfect fit and great price.
B008F8Q8K0|5|Factory Fit, Pre adjusted but 5 minutes later they were set where I like E'm .... Better than I expected happy with My Purchase!
B00BITPZKM|1|The unit's electrical receptacle was too large for my plug.  I had to file down the sides to make it fit.  After that it worked.  However when I contacted Amazon about it, they gave me my money back for this unit without having to return it.
B003J9SRZO|5|Great decal. Looks good and arrived quickly.
B0006302OU|5|love it
B007P74BZG|5|Great quality and shipped faater than expected.
B00700E8QA|5|Great, very easy to apply
B00D3XU9IO|5|Great, thanks for changing the color to orange.
B0015YD3AY|4|Vinyl a little thin... fits good... looks good.
B00IICIT1E|5|Great!!!
B00HTV2DQC|5|NEVER REPLACE A DRAIN PLUG AGAIN.
B0002UHVJG|5|Easy to install does the job
B001GH1P6E|5|JUST AS DESCRIBED.
B003S6F3IC|5|Had to purchase this due to the window not wanting to go up or down.  Easy to install and it came with instructions as well.  Absolutely trust worthy product
B00CR9WVPE|5|Good filter big improvement over stock
B00GMNUOM8|5|Fits great. Looks awesome.
B000E1DTG2|5|Works perfectly to extend the hitch allowing us to attach our bikes to the back of the pickup w/camper.
B00B5WEEL8|1|DID NOT FIT 06 MB ML350.  HAD TO RETURN AT MY COST
B003Q2LDHS|5|Very fast shipping and excellent quality helmet.
B005QRQGC8|5|Fit and finish are good. Arrived quickly and seems to be made for the long haul
B001TI5IIQ|5|This stuff worked pretty good. I had rough and yellowed head lamps on my 2000 Dodge truck and I looked up a cheap way on how to improve things. I looked on YouTube and people were using tooth paste.... yeah TOOTH PASTE!!!<br />Long story short, it didn't work. Then I saw a video on YT about this product and I was like.... pfffft what do I have to loose, I'll try it. So I took my time and used the three different sand paper pads, used plenty of water (you can use the spray bottle with liquid that comes with kit also) and the lamps looked very good. I would say if factory new was 10 on the scale of 1-10, after I was done I had an 8.<br /><br />After I was done with sanding and polishing, I cleaned everything nice and dry and used the sealant pad so the sun light doesn't mess with the plastic and turn it yellow again. My only gripe is that I wish they had more than two supplied plastic sealer wipes because with this kit, you can do multiple head lamps. You might be able to use some kind of UV resistant clear coat spray on the plastic head lamps after done sanding and polishing...I'm not sure though, but I don't see how it wouldn't work... research it.<br /><br />Over all, this is a good product and for $10 (what I paid) you really can't go wrong. Before you buy new lamps, try this stuff, you might be surprised and save yourself some money by not having to buy new lamps, unless you are gonna upgrade to LED with halo or something.
B00B5EX0X4|5|Smooth cable works great
B00CJFLOKY|5|I threw a check engine light on 2011  Hyundai Accent , misfire on cylinder #3 , bought  (4)  Delphi GN10330 Ignition Coils, and (4) NGK  BKR5EIX-11 Iridium IX Spark Plugs , I replaced the coils , plugs and it runs GREAT!
B001U6DMSK|1|Complicated to put up.
B0027XY6FS|5|Love these Air Filters - solid construction and fit perfect in my 2007 Hyundai Santa Fe.  Will be back to order another when the time comes.
B00JA3BMDW|5|Works well, needs minor calibration out of the box to make it more accurate but overall worth it.
B0009H52AC|5|Fit just fine
B00H8IXL5S|5|All lights worked and the daughter is happy with the new acsents to her car.
B00BQC7JNW|5|I use this thing everyday in my truck. It fits really well. It feels like little massage fingers while I am driving. I had to cut two holes in it to have it fit properly with the buttons that are one the shifter but all is well.
B008QR1ASK|2|These cloths are very thin. Dry they work ok but when wet, they don't pick up much.
B000CGVQCS|1|These do not fit a 2002 Isuzu Rodeo LS.
B00TDOGY04|5|Perfect. Amazing
B00IUV846I|5|Works great no problems.
B001GN6QQW|5|Great
B0108NBANE|4|it is good but I did an overkill..should have done a class I
B00540KPS8|4|Works ok. Paper bags would probably be better.
B00HRMQB8E|3|Same issue as everyone else, totally dead. Will not charge. I loved this light, but 10 months later.......looking for replacement,  any ideas appreciated.
B00009PGNS|4|Worked great on a long road trip.  Only problem was when hotel employee accidentally turned switch to 'heat' and we didn't notice.  Pop cans exploded and cool foods cooked.  Just be careful with switch.  Size was good for two people.  Maybe larger size would work better for larger families. At least we found out the heating feature works well.  Very well.
B001GCOB6K|5|My girlfriend got these boots for me and I have to say they are one of the best boots I have every had... great quality leather construction ..look awesome and feel great... they run a little big  but I have a wide foot so its not a problem for me... best $40 she spent...yes I was lucky enough to get them for $40.
B00IQHOSJI|5|ok
B0000ATZCE|5|Easy to set up, seems very strong, and works easily.  I set up my own combination in less than a minute.  The &#34;lock&#34; portion comes with a plastic cover to reduce exposure to the elements, which is great as I use it to secure a kayak to my dock.  So far, I am very pleased and will update this review only if I encounter longevity or wear issues.
B00LHK6W18|5|Love how sporty and expensive they look!  The shipping was prompt.
B00631E14Q|4|Pretty good top for a soft top. It does its job of keeping the sun off, but the place to put your phone and keys could be a little better. I sat my phone in the pouch and the edge of the velcro came down a little, but it never pulled much even with my phone in it riding.
B00XAS6M3I|5|I have a Tahoe with the third row of seats in the back.  There are two cup holders for the middle two seats but none for the back seats.  How dumb!  Do they not think the people in the back would ever want something to drink?  Thankfully, someone was thinking about those people when they invented this Zone Tech Cup Holder because it works great!  It attaches easily to any window and can be adjusted to wherever you want it.  It fits pretty much any size of drink and does not allow it to spill.  I am going to have to order another one so the other back passenger has one too.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who needs an extra cup holder in their vehicle.  I received a discounted product in exchange for my unbiased opinions.
B000CODH0O|5|use them all the time they work great
B0009IBJAS|5|Functions as supposed to do.
B009LL6Z9Y|1|Recieved a falty one and never recieved a replacement when I sent it back
B00008RWA0|3|It is very small.
B00DX8AVP0|4|Just received belt. Looks like bottom belt but no where does it say Erlandson on it. It says GBOOST on belt. It is made in the USA.
B003V57NUQ|4|I really thought the way it was worded that there was enough hardware for 2 kayaks.  There are only two mounts, so one kayak worth.  Other than that, fairly solid.
B004809YBE|5|Quality 30 Amp cord for RV.
B00MGSC2IW|5|Just what I needed didn't have to send back and get another one
B0031XULHK|3|Is OK!!!!
B003D4K9TC|4|To big, gave it to my nephew. He loves it.
B00OM3F04W|3|i thought i had purchased a differant product.  these open from the side,not the top.  i would have preferred a top opening.  the lights make this a good purchase, as they function well for brake lights.  i did not understand how the keyway worked, and had a struggle with that, until i realized the cover has to be pushed sideways as the key enters the lock.  it was frustrating trying to push the key into the lock until i learned to push the key sideways going in.
B006NK6JN8|5|easy to install
B006QMII1Y|5|Got this for my husband to put on the back of his 2009 Fit to prevent scratches/scrapes from loading/un-loading as well as from the dog entering the car from the back. It was easy to install and looks great...seems to do the trick.
B00OQXYVG6|5|Exactly as pictured. Nice product.
B00M9MYPYO|1|Do not buy this product!! Comes out just black! Get a better brand.
B005J6JRMM|5|This makes fastening my seatbelt much easier.  Only problem is that it disables the &#34;seatbelt unbukled&#34; alert.
B0000AYD4H|5|Worked perfect. Best to use some sharp scissors to cut.
B003X9TLUK|5|now it moves on its own as it should...
B000CP8EYW|5|Great engine oil, it truly reduced engine temps. Attended Sturgis 2015, did all the runs around the area.. Engine oil is holding up great so far.. Real test will be today, heading home and going through the Vegas going to be in triple digit temps..
B00JIIZCM6|5|I used Leather Nova Conditioner on both my Audi and Mercedes-Benz leather interiors. All I can say is WOW! I first used your leather cleaner and then treated them as directed. After letting it sit a couple hours I wiped the excess and was amazed at the depth and sheen…like new. I plan to try it on a few other leather personal items soon.<br /><br />Thanks for the great products.
B000E4NBPS|5|Looks factory and easy to install.
B000I1DJDG|5|Worked great cleaning up my leather seats before I classic coated them. Make sure to wear nitrile gloves.  I did not the first time and it will dry out your hands if you don't.
B001C6Q63G|5|Took 2 minutes to install.  Just good practice to keep vehicles operating well.  Saved $$ too....always good!
B00LSS9Q4O|5|Febest wheel bearing is excellent.  Absolutely no noise after replacing the bearing on the Prius.  Hint to DIY'ers, the OLD bearing is supposed to unbolt and slip right out, but it's often seized in there.  You will need to really bang it out from behind or use a 20 ton press to get it out.  Heat helps as the knuckle is aluminum and will expand more than the steel bearing you're replacing.  Also, to get to the 4 bolts holding it in you will either need a thin wall 14mm deep socket or dent in the axle dust shield to fit a regular socket.  Luckily, I had a thin wall socket that I used for my BMW spark plug changes I also purchased on Amazon last year.<br /><br />Also, for those who need to remove the knuckle to press the bearing out and have problems getting the castle nut back on the tie rod end (keeps spinning), fear not.  You can either have someone clamp the tie rod end to the knuckle as tightly as possible or you can lower the car with a jack stand under the tie rod end, just until there's a little weight on it.  DO NOT support the entire car on the tie rod end.  The spinning bolt is tapered and will &#34;secure&#34; itself when fully seated in the knuckle.<br /><br />Lastly, before working on this, set your parking brakes, put wheel chocks, leave door unlocked, windows slightly rolled down, trunk latch covered (so it can't close), disconnect the battery (pulling the two positive wire connectors is sufficient), and you will prevent your brake piston from shooting out of the caliper while you do this work.  If that happens, look forward to a dealer/mechanic visit as a computer is required to properly bleed the brakes after that, due to the computer actuated brakes.
B004ADWABK|5|Perfect fit and looks great
B0098B4RUQ|5|Fixed a long standing annoying problem. I cut the button portion out so one can see the buttons
B000CRO4IK|5|Works perfect
B006H34BUY|5|I got it to pick up the dust in my car - dashboard, steering wheel column and the deep recesses of the dashboard. Dust clings to it and I'm really happy with it.
B000O0M824|5|just like it came with the truck
B009Y7MJVS|5|This is exactly what I needed to hang my ez pass when traveling in a rental vehicle since many rental companies don't provide an ez pass holder.
B00YNR3CVU|5|A nice quality sticker. A great seller.
B00Y5LKD20|3|Yes met my expectations like it
B000EPRCAC|4|worked well
B003SJ2B8O|4|I never got the 30W draw it's rated for, no matter how carefully I aligned it with the sun. Perhaps the air wasn't clear enough. But for ease of use and sturdiness, it's excellent. I with I could afford to chain four of these together to ensure power independence while camping (I have to use a CPAP) as it seems overall the best deal - unless someone can point me to a solar panel that costs less, is as robust, and consistently draws at least 20W.<br /><br />It's a *little* heavier than I would like, but it's not marketed for its weight. It can be handled a little roughly without being too concerned for it, and that matters.<br /><br />I used it at Pennsic to charge my Yeti 400 and peaked at 19W draw, usually getting more like 15. But aside from the first day, I didn't try to keep it aligned well.
B007SQ29XK|2|Wouldn't fit on my 93 honda civic eg hatch B-swap. Flange was tio wide for it to connect to my  headers.
B006WQSXSW|5|Great product and price.
B003WGM4TY|5|Not only is this part a direct fit, but it has a light for the buttons the original didn't have.
B004FN0GDY|5|Wow I wane expecting these for another week!  They for here so quick. . Nd they looked incredible on my car.  Perfect fit 2006 chrysler sebring touring
B00CGGXQV6|5|easy to install looks great
B006JXVVPU|5|Returned to you. Did you credit my account?<br />Did not fit.
B00029J3YI|5|Great
B000OUX9PO|5|excellent tool at good price.
B00Y78OI5O|5|It fits like a glove.
B00M3R5P58|1|Absolute junk - I wanted to try something cheaper than the Brohn gear.  This is junk.  VERY cheap material and very uncomfortable. I will say they were good about refund!
B00F6N8Z6M|5|They're a great replacement for the originals.
B000CC9BR4|5|Perfect for what i wanted
B005KVLX50|4|Works good a little floppy use it to haul kayak
B005R4FBZS|5|This is the second one I have purchased for my vehicle. It fits perfectly, and the first one lasted 8 years.
B001LHVOVK|5|Nice to have works as should
B00EEKO99K|5|Works perfectly. Exactly as advertised
B00W4D892C|5|Top quality
B005S09XUA|5|Worked well
B000C7ZVQ4|1|This was the wrong sensor.  Buyer beware this does not fit a 2002 Toyota Camry 4cyl.
B004MDQN3Y|4|Works well
B000QIQU5K|5|Perfect.
B00KPWBDZY|5|Received today for my daughters 2015 Jeep Wrangler Sport (2 door).  Amazon lists it as not fitting, but they fit (and look) perfectly.  Easy bolt on installation, took only a few small metric hand tools.  Completely installed both sides after about 45 minutes by myself.
B000ALDQ8C|5|These fit my Motorhome winnebago and the price was great.
B000KJPTHU|5|I used to take a long highway trips pretty often, this stuff cleans the front of my car very well.
B00NB3JFSG|1|Honda says don't use, crappy stuff
B00H2VTGZK|4|Was just what I expected! Great product Great costumer service! If you email them ,a very nice person actually email you back in a very quick Manner. In pictures the tape looks amazing,  not as bright in person but however still looks great when car lights hits it. Only con is it doesn't actually my Kawi green but I can defiantly live with it! Great job customtaylor33
B001KXN3YQ|1|Does not work.
B0019IA99O|5|This insulator appears to be constructed a bit simpler matter than what was previously installed in the truck. However it fell very sturdy and the spacing between the holes was correct. I'm unsure whether it contains metal like the OEM one, but again. it feels strong regardless. Be sure to check all of the insulators on your vehicle since when one fails, the others are put under more stress and are more likely to fall apart. Most vehicles have 2-4 insulators. Also, don't forget to check the Walker website to make sure you're purchasing the correct part for your vehicle.
B00412UIPA|5|Good worked perfectly fine
B00840JOWS|1|The plug is for a later model dodge ram, doesn't fit 98-01 models
B00L40ZQGS|4|Good little fan. It puts out the air and sits well wherever you put it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the  on/off knob is so large, rounded and awkward you cannot turn it with one hand unless the fan is wedged where it can't move. I've only had it on high, even though it's 2 speed, because it's so hot right now. I lost all but low on my van's front AC. I bought this fan to help circulate the cool air from my back AC to the front of my van.
B0045U144C|5|Worked like a boss! no problems or issues at all. Installed in my 2014 Dodge Eco Diesel 1500. I love being able to remove the laptop mount when ever I travel with the family.
B0023VHBVU|5|Fit my 2007 Honda Civic EX Coupe perfectly, as expected. The only noticeable difference is that there are words in the bottom center of the tail light that do not appear in the image, I believe it is a brand of some kind. Not visible unless you're looking for it. Looks fantastic, easy install, matches the original. Cost less than half what the local auto parts stores were charging.
B00WKS07WQ|5|Works great, fits great.
B00BTLEIIY|4|The backseat cover did not work because there was no place to put the straps.  But the front looks great.
B009AA5R0Y|5|Great deal easy to install
B000N9I2ZI|5|Very good
B000V9POYW|5|Performed as advertised
B000GBD2X0|5|Fit 2001 Cruiser. Easy to install.
B00REJX30Y|5|Works pretty great very happy with it
B00FKPJJNY|5|Awesome Dome light. It's very bright and lights up the interior very well which could be a bit of problem during night. But overall I was very satisfied with the product. It was very easy to install and came with enough connectors to be installed with any cars I guess.
B0039538RK|5|Fit perfect. Very happy
B00E5OUOCQ|4|Exactly as advertised.
B0002JMEJ4|5|was just what needed
B00K3GBRQ2|5|These are crazy bright is like daylight when I back up. Lights up half my field no joke
B000AME50Y|5|it works.
B00GOQXTTS|4|Comfortable although  chin strap could be longer
B00C1Y0NFU|4|Cool
B002UC8SNC|5|Really takes the hassle out of flat towing. I can totally hook up my jeep in less than 5 minutes and you don't even know your towing.
B009FO11TQ|5|Very good quality and a great price
B0002KO3Q0|3|GOT THE CLAMP TIGHTENED. VERY BASIC TOOL .
B004W92GA2|4|Love the keychain!
B002UC6P6E|4|Second time I've ordered these. a good solid product. fit for the job.<br />One small concern, though.. the &#34;blister&#34; packaging isn't well sealed, and small parts (screws, the catch) seem to fall out in transit.<br />I did have to return one*, from my last order, because parts were actually missing. This time around, there were some rattling around loose in the mailer, so check the bottom of the bag carefully.<br /><br />*When I did return the product, the supplier was helpful and immediately shipped a replacement with no problems
B000JJLVNM|5|Alignment tool works awesome
B000CKPHY2|3|Solid product BUT:<br /><br />I drive an 08 TC, and this will trigger your check engine light. In fact, the only gas cap that would fit properly is the official Toyota brand cap. Don't even bother with third party brands.
B001445IZ8|2|I only give this pump 2 stars because it did work to extract my oil.  However, after roughly 20 strokes of the pump, the handle came off in my hand and the barb that is supposed to hold the handle on the metal shaft cut into my finger prettty deeply.<br /><br />As much as I wanted to like this product because it does work fairly quickly, any device the breaks AND injures me on the first use is not going to stay in my tool shed.<br /><br />I'll move on to another alternative and chalk this up as a lesson learned
B001NAP2E0|5|fit the 4tec engine perfectly.
B000PGVZ30|5|Be sure to wire correctly. I purchased both female and male plugs thinking wire connection would be alike but after studying the diagram it requires different wiring. Best way to wire is to plug both into each other and Compare Where all colors and ground wire match.
B00260YJ9K|3|Works well but very fragile design on mounting tabs, easy to break.
B00UG52P7U|3|I thought they'd be a little wider.  iPad only fits if I take it out the protective cover that it is normally in.  Nonetheless, the kids like them.
B00KWMG4A6|3|They are for sure heavy duty. There are easy to follow &#34;cut&#34; lines. Just not my style.
B00S9KIMBM|5|Great
B00JY94Y3C|5|Arrived on schedule. Very easy to install and they look great
B00589S032|5|MADE IN CHINA ITS OK GOOD FOR KEYS AND PILL FOB
B004SMUPPG|5|Perfect
B000C6ZZNO|5|A
B000UK6OGE|5|part was just as expected, fit perfect too, thank you
B00MAO1K4E|5|nice, but the picture look better
B00THB05DU|1|NFG
B00JN6JOI6|5|Works as expected - good quality for good price.
B005SMUORO|1|I picked the socket that fit the best and it did not work.  Used some penetrating oil, let it sit overnight, and it still did not work.  An open ended wrench did the trick to remove the sensor though!  These don't work as well as I heard/expected them to.
B000C91A0I|1|poor steel! this will rust out in about 1.5 years! I am selling my car so i will replace again but if i had to do it again would buy the OEM one from GM since that lasted for 12 years on my car. If you plan on keeping your car for over 3 years than it is more than worth it to buy the OEM product. if you not believe me than buy it and you will see.  also for my 2001 cav it is not the exact fit but will work with a little bending, it also does not fit as tight in the grommet as the original OEM
B000XSGKYO|5|Used this to put a freeze plug in at a very sharp angle. It put it in completely and straight in two hits with a hammer. Didn't even realize it was already fully seated till I pulled the tool back out of the way!
B00SBZRR8O|4|Recommend! Pump has no problem pumping fuel from gas can on the ground and the fill tube to my John Deer lawn tractor (about 2.5 ft.).  It is fast enough & so far no problem with one exception - the auto shut off does not always work when filling my lawn tractor.
B00ABYVT64|5|Good quality.
B005PZMKZI|5|Fit like a glove on my 2015 Chrysler 200. The color is perfect too.
B0091DJWV0|5|Reads and clears ALL codes on my 2002 Land Rover Discovery 2, INCLUDING the 3 Amigos!
B008FYKU5I|5|Durable and fit perfect
B000MKC6LO|5|Perfect
B00CO8UH2W|1|did not work. was not the correct items for the garmin 3587 gps
B00L84828Y|5|Exact fit change out. Extra wiring not required
B004I0JA2M|4|Worked Fine
B00ITL578M|5|Good fit great item
B00H58W59Y|1|Not for the filter size, any way UI will keep
B00QFYCK7Q|5|Fits well on my 01 raptor 660. Solid cover.
B003EP52BU|5|does the trick
B00UIVYWKK|1|Reverse light bulbs where the wrong size
B003L2ZQ9E|5|I recently tried Royal Purple Full Synthetic Oil and you have to use a fully synthetic Oil Filter. This fits that recommendation perfectly.
B00FH8P1DG|5|Works great on my 2015 Kawasaki Teryx4... Love it!
B00B4L0IGA|5|Grab much better.
B00BFUG3EG|5|Awesome stuff, a little bit goes a long ways.
B000CMHVG2|3|ok
B002MCVGB6|5|An outstanding lubricant.
B004B8EUI0|4|Hey this worked! I had some scuff marks on the inside of the door, from my big feet when getting in an out. Nothing seemed to shift them despite not seeming very deep.But this worked.
B003VBJHEK|5|Perfect replacement in my RV
B00B3HXWFO|5|Use to clean leather after SEM soap and before painting the leather with classic coat.
B007ZLLN1W|5|SMOOTH RIDING
B00QEXRES8|5|Exactly what I expected
B000C57KPQ|5|SMOOTH
B00332GNDK|1|I read all the reviews, saw it was made by westin so I thought it was a good buy. I followed directions EXACTLY.  When they came in the mail the first thing I noticed was some of the double sided tape was loose.  Stuck it back on and continued with install.  Within a month one of the rear fell off and the other rear was ready to fall off also.  I then looked an the front windows, both were loose so I removed them.  I wish we could give them a zero star review,  Very dis-satisfied!!!!  The problem was the tape didn't hold, rear the tape came loose from the deflectors, front came loose from window channel.
B00NFSWESK|5|LOVE 'EM, LOVE 'EM, LOVE 'EM.  Surpassed my expectations.  REALLY LIKE those lenses.
B000C5I2YO|5|Don't put it off: Installation is faster than a good hotdog goes down at a county fair. Buy it!
B00EZ9PK48|4|Looks and sounds great. Polished tips looks great. Over the axle pipes did not fit good. Had to cut and get extra pipe ext. but the kit had enough clamps for the extra mods. Not a project for everyone.
B00SI6NPS2|1|Low quality.
B0005JOBRO|5|This is what professionals use for detailing. Stop looking and just buy it.<br /><br />I've tried everything in the way of spray shine and back to black sprays for plastic trim and rubber. This just works. Extremely well. It's not greasy and it lasts for 2-3 months, which makes it very reasonably priced.
B00I87FQIS|5|A1A
B000BUU5YA|5|I recently used the Camco adaptor at a location without the 30 amp hookup my RV is equipped for. It worked flawlessly and we were able to use electricity from a regular 120 outlet. The adaptor is easy to use and both the color and size make it easy to find. For any RV owner with a 30 amp connector this is really a must have item.
B000JZY5ZW|5|Works great
B000A835AY|3|The cleaner wipes work great but the Protectant gave me some trouble. After using it, the surfaces look streaky.
B00CZ1BS1C|1|this item is lightweight and doesn't meet HD standards. also the size was different then the advertisement.
B0079QRRRM|5|Super backpack. Just what I need'ed. 👍🏻
B000KZ20HG|5|Very happy with product.
B006H34AE6|5|the absolute best for getting up dog hair!  this is so simple and so easy.  I use this daily.....takes seconds to clean the dog and cat fur from anything.
B00CH586VG|4|I just wish it was prime but everything else was fine
B009AQTOP2|5|Just installed these lights on my truck...  Very bright and durable for the money I spent...  These lights are worth the money and more, a definite buy if you are in the market for an aftermarket work light...
B00V1OIL14|5|Good  deal  quick strong works great
B003D4KA32|5|Great tip for Scion Fr-s.<br /><br />It looks really great!!<br /><br />Highly recommended!!
B00407WNE0|5|Took me 5 minutes to install.  Look great.  Watch the youtube video and is simple.
B002PV0XRM|5|Works perfectly! Why pay more; O'Reilly wants $75.00 each not a set.
B00ZF9ZUVA|3|Wasnt the right door handle
B000C2EAB6|5|love the set
B00406YG0K|3|It had some rips in the fabric upon opening the box but it wasnt worth the wait to send it back for a replacement since I needed it to help keep my face warm for my job.
B001MU292O|3|Difficult to install boot on spark plug. Not able to feel when the boot is security locked. I would not buy again.
B0002SRCMO|5|works very well
B00GSAUHB8|3|I have a Honda Fit and this is too small, I recommend you get the large size unless you have a tiny windshield.  It's easy to fold up, but a hassle to put back in the sack. I just store it in the door pocket, when the weather cools down I'll put it in the sack to store for the season.
B001QT9KO6|5|I got this for my 99 Ford Explorer. Keeps my coolant levels stable.
B00CMR79H6|5|Completes my set of floor mats. Vacationed at the beach and this thing saved me a lot of hastle with sand. Great investment and the ti tire tread pattern is cool.
B002DU3TTO|5|looks good and worked with my solar panel
B0058EK88M|4|These mats are for my 2015 Honda CR-V, they worked perfectly for the price and looks good in my car. I would buy them again when needed.
B00CEXKB8M|5|Fits perfectly on 2013 Nissan Pathfinder SV, don't know why couple of reviews talking about fitment problems. Received on time. Installed in less than 25 Min.
B005FNKFYS|5|Works on my storage container in the truck. Looking to buy their hitch version soon.
B008S9QUGI|5|Love it very much, I highly recommend this item to those who do not have a lock on there tailgate.
B00S1N6X9K|5|This fit perfectly and only cost pennies compared to other options!
B00EJY0DJG|5|It's a standard size bike plate frame, heavy duty, it's going on my Goldwing.
B006W2EKHE|4|This item was purchased for adding lights to a camera for my 3D Printer. The lights work great with the right color of white to make the objects pop off the 3D Printer.
B000EQD7IW|5|Fit in my 2000 Toyota Camry LE 4-door. So far so good.
B0012TZ04E|5|keeps me cool and feels great.
B011JNQBO0|1|Didn't fit for crap bolt holes do not line up at all the hose is about 2in to short I have been fighting this product for 3 day to make it work!😡 and to top it off they didn't even put the silicone in the box
B00WCB96XC|5|This is my 3rd purchase of this beautiful US flag and I love it. I'm LAW and ORDER man, not to mention a Vietnam War VETERAN. This sticker will be placed on my FORD CROWN VICTORIA POLICE INTERCEPTOR.
B00H2UQAXM|5|very good quality, delivery in France without problem !
B00U6HOFSU|5|Decent for a cheap sprocket
B000CIXOYE|3|Overall quaoity is good and Bestop customer service is first in class.  The passenger door pins did not matchup.  I called Bestop and they are sending a replacement.
B003ZZM1FY|5|Loved it!!
B000EQXOVM|4|My window works great now with the new gear kit.
B009T0BVWS|5|Great fit on a 03 wrx, easy installation, mailed out and arrived sooner than indicated and was exactly as shown in picture with no missing hardware. Extremely easy to tell which side is which, as seen in photo.
B001PPBSMI|5|Well made. Easy to install. Performance is Great. Much less bushing deflection . Rear wheels Stay truer under Hard cornering.!
B00NAUL218|3|did not use the product.
B00BVDX76E|2|Great decal
B00BJJZ5XS|4|Mirror fit perfectly in place of the stock mirrors and plugged in the the power mirror plug. They don't feel extremely sturdy, you have to be careful when tightening the bolts. They are a major improvement over the stock mirrors.
B00G620ZVU|4|Seems to be a quality product.  I am just installing these as supplementary off road lights on a Jeep WK.  The beams were specified as 30 degree and are definitely a tight 30 degree.
B000N2XOHQ|5|Installed in a 66 Comet 289, works like a charm!  Highly recommend.
B001AV7SFS|5|Fit perfectly on my Bmw E60.
B008L617D4|5|ok
B0057B5PD4|5|Great mirror. Works perfectly. The defrost even works on my Taurus that didn't previously have defrost mirrors.
B00LQHR9GE|1|One was today I went out and turned on the light bar and this is what I got. Only have had it on the truck since June. Pisses me off
B000R8F47Y|5|GREAT tool for a ladies packing a truck!!  :)  It works great!
B00KTHZVFI|3|As other reviewers stated...this key doesn't fit smoothly but you must force it into a 2014 Chrysler T&C.  Not sure if I trust it as an everyday key but okay as a backup if you lock the keys in the car...
B00RRCHND6|2|Returned it.  Wouldn't stay open when not full.
B00PTQOF4W|2|Light super bright but all beat up with paint chipped off not even gonna bother to send back
B00CWKMD5Q|5|Easy to install and look good.  Bought them because they were washable, but it will be some time before I have to test this.  Gave my old little sports car a boost.
B00F6AQUQC|5|No problems when installed
B00JQYLLEU|4|good quality and good quantity.  as described.
B00F8FVOB6|5|The products fit perfectly, no complaints at all.
B003LM9EWO|5|very nice product!!
B00YBFXQEW|3|Well I don't know what makes this so special to priced so high but since I spent several thousands on my generator I figured I would go with the recommended oil. I don't run the gen excessively so this will last a while.
B009ZCL6SY|5|fit great , have not used the jet ski yet
B000LNBLTK|5|Do the job just as fine as snap on and matco they are all the same
B000GVD0S2|5|Just used it on a 5 day, 1,500 trip and it was great.  Easy to detach and carry into the motel, and easy to attach and leave again in the morning.  A really fine product.
B00BD5WETQ|5|Took my dealer 3 hours to program these seat heaters after I installed the kit myself. One must factor in that cost with the price of this kit. Otherwise it is of great quality and i recommend it
B000F79Z7M|5|Great product and easy install....before you remove tape backing, do a dry fit to see how the line up.
B00BJLQ3JG|5|Very pleased! Looks exactly like the pictures and the price was very reasonable!! Will definitely be shopping here again!!
B002NAMJHC|3|Nice product only issue I had to change plug to headlight
B00L3N8HRQ|5|fit perfect , looks nice , works beautiful , love it !!!
B00EEQVB7M|5|On time not destroyed
B003SS62PS|5|I lost all but low speed on the front AC in my van and it's 100*. I Bought this fan and clipped it in the middle above my windshield. I also bought a different style of fan to help circulate the air from the back AC (van has front and rear AC's) to the front. After I get the worst of the heat out the air circulates well and cools the whole van.. While it's cooling down I aim it on myself. Then I usually have to aim it away because it does such a good job. It gets used several times a day, 5 days a week and I've had no issues with it.
B00WAOS1BY|5|The product was easy to install and everything went perfect during the installation.
B000PEQMNA|1|We got to use our Rola cargo carrier for the first time this July 2015. We drove from Houston TX. to Orlando FL. Our first trip to Disney World:)At our lunch stop in Louisiana, we noticed one of the plastic support bars had ripped through the material and was sticking out of the back of the carrier! At each stop after that, we checked the carrier. Each mile we added to our trip, added more holes to the carrier! Along with the holes, came ever increasing noise from the roof top. At one point it sounded like hail in our otherwise beautiful sunny day. We did make it to our resort without loosing our belongings on the side of the road. On our return trip, my husband decided to go ahead and try the carrier again since our SUV was already so full. He said everything was strapped down and secure. It wasn't long before we had (hail) on the roof again and worried that everything was going to flying into the car behind us. By the time we reached Pencicola we had had enough! We pulled into a hotel parking lot and chucked the whole thing into their trash dumpster! We obviously do not recommend this item.
B009X20S94|5|As usual great product by RI .. This kit will fit a Poison Spyder bumper perfect ..
B00SQYQMTK|2|Did not work as advertised.  The device itself seemed to work fine.  The app seems to be the problem.  It says it is for I phone 5 but you can't read all the info on the screen.  I would recommend buying one from a reputable auto parts store.
B00YVMGZXY|4|Mat was very nice, storage bag is cheeply made
B00DWVNBIC|4|this is used for auxiliary lights, it fit great in FJ cruiser original placement, one tiny thing the color is Green, and it really doesn't match anything in the dash, it was supposed to be same color oranegish led light as the rest of the panel.
B00VPHZPB6|5|As advertised.
B00IZTE4WI|5|Good size for my husbands big hands!
B003G60P0A|3|Couldn't really tell any difference with it installed.
B005WK2BXW|5|use with Fel-Pro OS30831, if over 150 K mi. consider all new pan bolts
B00CRL97JA|5|nice tank without leaks, gasket is thicker than most competitors and spout has another gasket unlike others and has a distance long enough to get to hard to get to places, like tail lights and racks.
B00MO1B7BO|5|Great product. Was easy to change and works great.
B002P8JL7I|5|It worked perfectly!
B00KZD8ME8|5|Took less than five minutes to install both of them. Works great.
B00KOHHLTW|5|Excellent product, worth every penny to not have to pay the dealer to re-flash the ECM every time you make a change.
B0002V9IFU|5|Meguiar's has kept my red leather sofa and love seat in like-new condition for several years now, despite the dry desert climate and sun beating on them.  I usually give them a Meguiar's rubdown about every 3 months.  Highly recommend Meguiar's!
B0000AXPVD|5|Works heat for a quick cleaning of water spots and streaks.
B006HJ2R18|5|This stuff works great I own a tint shop so doing vinal wrap comes as a second nature and this stuff works good if you know what you are doing!
B00D7LTNW0|5|Pros: Makes wiping the car down fast and easy. The liquid is really slippery....probably making it less likely to scratch or cause swirls. Pretty inexpensive, you don't mind spritzing a little extra because it isn't costing you a small fortune. Leaves a nice shine.<br /><br />Cons: None<br /><br />Bottom Line: Works really well, love it for keeping my black car looking sharp
B000CPCO9S|5|Work great! Used them on an 86 Grand National. Old ones out, new ones in, just loosen them and start pumping.
B00EPOKCWI|5|These lights are just as described. They allow for better night vision. They come packaged as a pair for both headlights (which you would want to do when replacing you burned out OEM bulb anyway). Even if one burns out in the future, and I only need one to replace ...the cost of these is cheaper than buying just one of a similar type in an auto parts store.
B00KMH33R8|5|Great part well made
B00124WKOM|5|I received a sample for evaluating and all opinions are my own:    This was the first time I have used a waxing product for leather, and it did a really great job. I was nervous applying it. It goes on very liquidy and when it has dried, it looks like a dull film is the end-result. But, when I lightly buffed the wax, it became more polished and left a gorgeous sheen. I was so relieved, lol. It is a bit of a project, but I am happy with the end results. I ended up applying two coats for my desired sheen, using about half the bottle, but someone who already has a finish established might get more. If it feels tacky, wait longer before buffing. I ended up using more than one rag to buff the wax. Polishing the wax with very dry (lint-free) rags helped.    I needed to thoroughly clean my couch  and moisturize it first before applying the wax. The wax finish was like the final step I took to revive the couch's leather. I used the other products offered by European Leather to help. Their Deep Cleaner and Restorer. I am attaching before some before and after pictures. My leather couch ((was)) disgusting from my children spilling things on it!...and now it looks great.
B00HFMULA0|5|nice
B001UJH152|4|Fast service good product.
B00VNJ3J1O|4|Overall I love my new racing seats. They look awesome and fit perfect. Only complaint I have is, they came with NO instructions. So I had to rely on youtube videos for help (and I couldn't find any videos pf this brand or any application for my '98 Camaro) But it all worked out and they turned out great.
B00JUQFVX6|5|Very good product!!! Easy to install and fit perfectly in my car!
B00O2I5ILM|4|I went out and tried to put this on our 2001 Acura TL and it fit!  I had to pull down on it more and earlier I thought it would break the product but the &#34;pegs&#34; on the top of the mirror extend down more so it fit great.
B004158O26|5|Great deal and perfect coffee and beverage cups
B00E1JBQLS|5|Works great as a pet food and water tray. Protects the hardwood floors.
B00GUTGESM|1|They don't fit half the sizes listed. Ordered 6 bulbs and none of them will fit my '04 Passat sedan. If your bulbs need offset pins they won't fit.
B006GFPF30|5|I use this to keep a charge in the battery that powers the electric Minn Kota outboard mounted on my inflatable, which gets  us back and forth several times a day, to the marina a few hundred yards away from our mooring.  Almost indestructible and is easy to mount.
B004PC5FFE|5|Works great
B00LSFWE1O|1|Produced no beam, could not see the road only reflection off signs and lane markers
B003OBNTCI|2|Does NOT fix the 2010 Suzuki SX4 Cross Over 4 door hatchback rear window! Amazon ID's this as the correct one but the right blade is 10&#34; (Inches- 25 CM) on the 2010 model, NOT 12&#34;. Otherwise I'm sure it's a fine blade. All Anco's I've ever used have been great.
B0067UE4K4|5|Almost didn't fit! But my with my logic it'll work!
B006NEN81A|5|This worked perfectly for my husband's Tundra. Will buy another when this one wears out, it's his second one. They last along time so worth the price.
B00J97X2YG|3|Your window must be completely straight with no curvature to the opening for this to work.
B000NU1OQQ|5|Fast shipping! Exactly as expected
B00UMO6HZ6|5|GOOFIT Ignition Coil CDI Regulator Rectifier has a great voltage regulator that is definitely part of the package. You will find that your ATV can work its way through the muddy woods when you are using this great rectifier. You need to be able to keep the ATV on its feet. The key is to make sure that the ATV is able to make it past the warranty.
B00332GOAW|5|Fit great and looks good, I would recommend these.
B00JQXR25S|2|Looks good
B002Z2Z8F8|4|It works but is it really necessary?<br /><br />This product best fits between a spray detailer (I use meguiars) and a liquid wax (I use zymol). If you liquid waxed monthly, you might detail spray weekly and use this every other week. At least for my can, it wasn't pressurized well and you had to shake it a lot and wait. It is easy to spray on, drys and smells like a carnauba wax, and is easy to wax off.<br /><br />Pros: saves time, extends time between liquid wax<br /><br />Cons: too expensive, one can might fully do 2-3 small cars, doesn't last as long  as liquid wax
B0056JC4E0|5|OK
B0021QBB4A|5|Amazing bag!! Bought for my trip to Colorado. Lots of room for everything plus more. Loved having the cover to help keep 4wheeler dry.
B00XOSZY38|3|Great protection..but they run too small...I will have to modify...
B00B9F1ZSG|5|Great!
B00FKDGPEC|5|Looks great
B000E0V4JC|5|Quality hose, Killer price and fast shipping!
B00HE66TEO|5|great color match
B00JGP8I1S|4|Wonderful item
B003F036MQ|3|fine scented.
B00ADFB22M|5|It fits well and I don't even have a problem fitting it.
B00V4049K2|5|Got this product about a week ago. Have definitely seen a difference since using this and so have my guests that come in to my car. Great Purchase
B00AB2PBU6|5|Fit  properly!
B007LQHIX8|4|Works good on b&s intek engine for cub cadet 50in zero turn.
B00HC8UWCO|5|For the price its amazing.  To install you need to do some investigation on youtube, but I was able to complete it with little to no electrical knowledge and a can do attitude.  Dont buy the scorpio alarm at $350.  Buy this.  It works well.
B00D3P92XA|5|These are exactly as advertised and I couldn't be happier with them. As my child is learning to drive, other drivers are much more courteous with these magnets on our vehicle.
B0096B9XVQ|5|came in teo days got irt installed great price happy with our choice.
B00NP60URE|5|Works great!
B004AG8T44|5|It fits 95 BMW 318i Euro spec. Very quiet. Good purchase.
B00N43FNBQ|3|Everything else was perfect but the wheel covers do not fit at all.
B0083LB8V8|1|Crooks! Don't waste your money! It won't work as described!
B000EDUTOU|5|This level was easy to install.  It is very easy to see if mounted so as visible through the rear view mirror.  Great leveling aid.
B000BUQOEA|3|As a filter it worked fine, the resulting water was clean and good tasting.  I used this a a replacement filter in an older Camco RX90 filter.  I could not get it to seal completely.  Just a small leak but not acceptable over time in an RV park.  I tried to find a replacement housing, but i guess it is no longer manufactured.  I just ordered a disposable unit.
B008ZU4AP8|3|Runs big.
B005CLPRWI|5|It's a bit shiny, but cheap and good fix for broken door handles.<br /><br />I installed two front handles (left and right) in 3 minutes total! Do NOT follow YouTube videos. It's much easier than that. Absolutely no need to take off the inside door cover. Just remove the little plastic cover on the door frame with your finger nail, to expose the star screw. Use a T30 screwdriver to loose this screw. No need to take it out (and you can't take it out because some plastic things prevent it from dropping out). Insert your key into the lock and jiggle it, and you should be able to take the lock out. Then put in the new handle, then the lock back in, then screw the screw back into the lock. You are done! 2 minutes and easier than changing air filter. You can watch YouTube video to see what I'm talking about, but do not follow the videos.
B004ME8MZ0|5|Loos like a factory OEM part. snapped on firmly, not too hard. For the price it is a very good deal, I definitely would recommend.
B000E682CS|5|i sold the truck before i got it installed it looked complicated
B00M42CEG0|5|Very easy to install. Look similar to factory version. Nice addition to my 2014 F150
B000TYVLAU|5|the base and top switch section parts could pass for the OEM part, glad I bought it. Dorman has a new customer.
B002M7MU2A|5|Awesome replacement for spray cans. Where have you been all my life.
B00NHBYOA6|2|doesnt get cold enough. takes forever to get cold. need to start with cold items in order to have them semi cold. noisy fan.
B004A327QS|4|The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was that it had a minor amount of surface rust nothing that hurt their performance but still
B00118UA2I|1|First had water coming into them after having sealed the base. Second water again after sealing the base with silicone AND covering the screws. I did everything to seal these stay away!!!! Purchase OEM
B0001EXBPQ|5|love it good quality !!!
B00W4IDIGE|5|Installed the side skirts 2 years ago-still like new & no adhesion problems. DO THE PREPPING!!! Installed this today. Much nicer being &#34;Pro&#34; & that's saying a lot b/c the side ones are awesome. THE WIDEST AVAILABLE at this time. I'm an at home Detailer, 35 years now, & this product is among the very best quality & easy to install body trim their is, at this price range & higher. DO THE ALCOHOL PREP-UNTIL THE PADS STAY WHITE!!! If it sits low then you really should use self-tapping 3/4 inch screws & square washers (Round may bulge out if on or over the bend). Hit it with some long lasting rubber shiner, or paint it using Plastic paint, priming first with a Flex agent spray for flexibility (No cracking).  Simply GORGEOUS!<br /><br />Thank You EZ LIP :)
B007J553G0|5|great
B0089KNGNQ|5|Definitely much easer with  two people to get it sinked with the car. That said, with two people, after one fail, got it to work the second time. Took very little time! Get it, it works.
B00PF0HIG4|5|Great item,  quick shipping even though it came from China.
B00XZ9OHSE|5|Work excellent
B00JBJ3K3U|5|Very very nice !!
B00HW1TLYQ|5|Excellent product.
B001D9DP0E|5|Easy install, fit perfectly and worked great. Shipped fast.<br /><br />I only wish I had known about the higher upgrades before I'd ordered, but these are brighter than my previous ones anyway.
B00MZN6UBI|3|They don't work as well as expected, but they do help.
B004D0EAUE|5|Awesome!  This  starter already  has an upgrade contact in it.
B00F0VMMSW|5|Great price and easy to use and made the job so much easier. Paid for itself after one brake pad swap!!
B0073VRCNM|1|Did not fit my ford escape 2010 or my ford escape 2008. Really disappointed!!
B000BUTD9I|1|I took out of package and it was already ripped where it connects together on the fold.  It had a very strong chemical smell to it.  I would not buy again.
B00Y16E92O|5|Good quality
B0077BJRKE|5|I put this sticker above my inspection sticker and it's a great and simple addition. I tried to put it below my inspection sticker but it would block my VIN and i didn't want any trouble from the cops. But I've gotten lots of good laughs out of it.
B00BC3727S|5|Helmets fits great with true low profile. Inside is soft on the head and not heavy so its easy on the neck at highway speed
B005EPLJ9W|5|The price was right
B00IS92L8Y|5|looks good
B000BYB8D8|4|liked it
B00V3YT77O|5|Very satisfied with the quality, price & very fast shipping !!!
B001I1F11S|5|Love it!!! great kept dirt inside the liner
B00M0CBV9U|5|The RoofBag works as advertised! Money well spent!
B00FJW61AW|5|Fit nice
B002JBM9WA|5|Excellent lights,  Fit perfectly on my 2001 GMC Sierra.
B00FRHOC82|5|This is the best windshield wiper I've ever used for my car. It holds up great in the winter with the snow and ice in Minnesota.
B0087LME94|5|Very nice plate.
B00CEXKAK6|5|nice product easy to install
B00LPIA3T4|5|Convention
B004L38AL8|5|It is an exact replacement and arrived on schedule.
B00CNKQS7E|4|My daughter loves it!
B005D7F794|5|Wife pleasantly surprised with quality.
B00D9C2CDO|1|Takes in water and is not waterproof
B00X3KD2HW|4|Only problem I had is determining how bright they would be. They are fine for the need but a 'brighter than' or 'dimmer than' the standard old bulb would be helpful. Or a definition of what the name/description means for sure.
B000H0KMEC|5|A perfect replacement for the original H7 Osram bulb in my 2010 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter.  Only time will tell how its useful life compares .to that of the original.
B00504NF2G|5|Perfect fit for a 1996 Toyota Camry and performance feels better than factory, paired with new NGK wires.
B000760FWU|5|Work good
B00B4KVA68|5|nice sticker,well made and prompt delivery.
B000NOKNKA|5|Fit over my glasses nicely.  Didn't interfere with vision/visibility.
B004Z76HJ2|5|It wasn't exactly the part I needed but it was what I ordered. My mechanic made it work. Fast delivery. Thank u!!
B009SUJTY6|5|Great pair of gloves. I use them everyday
B000FFY8VC|5|Fits the old style EZ-pass nicely.  We got this one when the one I had on the car for 4 years broke from sitting in the sun and the pressure of being restuck every once in a while.
B0130RZISI|5|wow!!! I am impressed. this is the greatest thing ever. I am having so much fun with it and it is very easy to operate. I would recommend it to anyone.
B0124AS83E|5|These are fairly similar to that of the black ones. Like I said, the decal is big enough to be clearly visible in any car window when I held it up. Probably not from quite a distance, but if fairly close you should be able to tell the logo. I will be giving this to a friend who is an Uber driver because I am not one, I may become one in the near future, but not right this minute. I was given the opportunity to receive these for a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions are 100% my own.
B008G39CF2|5|Perfect and fast!!
B003XECS96|4|works great
B00L7TJK5Y|2|Purchased a set of these brake pads for my 2012 MB Sprinter a few weeks back from a different supplier so this review is only for the product, so fore i have found them to be less dustier, they are more exspensive then the OEM pads. However i am very surprised at how weak the stopping power is. It takes longer and requires more strength to get these pads to stop the van while it's empty. The fact that it has trouble doing so when the van is empty is quite concerning for me as i would hate to find out how much power i need to apply on highway with a van full of people. This will be my last of these pads. Maybe it will work better on a smaller vehicle but for now i will switch back to OEM pads till i find another brand.
B002PLJBN4|5|Super fast shipping great addition to the mattress,
B004XACFK6|1|It sucks not even a bright light not worth it at all
B001T8A8M2|5|Exactly what it said it was. Fit perfectly.
B00UX8D0RE|5|These are BRIGHT. But they are Flood Lights. A lot pf people would not prefer these because these don't have a focused beam of light. They are short range and can get diffused easily. Not recommended in Foggy weather. I actually had to put in two relays to control 2 lights each (I have 4 of them) and they tend to stall my engine a little bit when switched on. They are highly recommended for tractors, snow mobiles etc.
B002UC19OW|1|Would not remove black roof wash off...
B001LHVOVK|5|I wish I should have kept it, very simple looking but very effective tool.
B00F4PGZJG|5|Everything that was expected....wierd but no SNELL approval sticker. Am I behind in times? Thanks Amazon
B000UOBIZC|5|Great for our RV
B00SLQGW8Y|5|Excellent!
B00CH5UBYQ|5|Perfect for making anti-American, libtard heads everywhere explode when they're sitting behind you in traffic. Came out great on my truck. Marine approved. Have you given your 2nd Amendment a hug today?
B00E658PAW|1|Not at all I had to replace them after 10 days
B0051SO7JQ|1|I used the compressor one time and the end tip came off....making the compressor useless.
B00BWAO2VK|5|Great Price, Perfect fit on my 2002 F150. Packaged to prevent damage during shipment. Completely satisfied.
B007OW62V8|5|Simple install.  Why overpay your dealer for this part and the service when you can do it yourself in 5 minutes?
B005KVVOUY|5|Love it!!! Looks great!!!
B003YN9LBE|1|I seldom if ever have written a review such as this; no apologies for writing it.  I purchased this filter from another vendor.  Even though the Cadillac may be a small percentage of its use compared to other filters, I must say that although this filter physically fits my 2009 STS, it is constructed incorrectly internally for this application.  Had I not owned the factory service manual, I never would have known this.  Looking at the filter, the inlet is the threaded fitting.  In actuality, for the Cadillac, this fitting is the outlet.  What this causes is that you are actually bypassing the filter to the engine, even though you are filtering the return port to the gas tank.  I disassembled this filter to verify this statement, and I found a lot of debris in the filter.  I had also disassembled the original filter that was in the vehicle, and I found no such debris.  Correct or incorrect, this leads me to believe that the filter had a defect.  Please see snaps.
B00AQXF24A|4|They work good in My Riding Mower .<br />I have yet to use them in the dark .<br />My Neighbors are Lucky !!
B001B7BULO|5|Great replacement
B00VNBEBCS|5|The bulbs are 10x brighter than the stock headlights. I just bought the fog lights to go with!
B000630218|5|Looks great
B00R7HJ0BO|4|Had to work to get the net to attach to my Tuscon's anchors and I couldn't use the clips that were at the corners of the net at all but with a little work it will fit.
B00TA5ECJQ|5|I bought this siphon 3 months ago and I just now opened the package and used it on my snow blower. This siphon is fantastic! No problems whatsoever. I used to buy whatever they had at Home Depot. Those are cheaply made, didn't work, and always leaked. I finally decided to pay the extra money and give the GasTapper a try. No issues. Glad I bought it. Definitely worth every penny.
B00BY2OFQS|5|Easy install, quality product. Looks great on the Jeep and lets you get rid of that stock monstrosity.
B00KL3ALGO|5|These things work as advertised. They stick to the window and don't come off. They block just the right amount of light to ensure that the kiddo doesn't get roasted on longer car rides. Highly recommend.
B000KL1FJE|5|So glad I purchased these WeatherTech floorliners.  Recommended by both our automotive mechanic and body shop owner!  Very easy to install--fit right in place--look great!!  Much nicer than the plastic garbage bags I had put over the regular floor mats to keep them clean.  Perfect for the stuff that gets tracked into my vehicle because I work on a horse farm.  Highly recommend!  Great service from the company in quickly shipping them!
B004IJBV20|5|A great price with a great product!
B00XU34OG0|5|Super cute and protects my car's leather seats from the sun. Seems sturdy enough to last a while.
B00EA0ZB7I|3|Arrived before expected.  One light was not all that weather proof.  I am hoping it would last.
B000HEBR3I|5|Great product!
B00YFHINBW|5|item as expected
B0073J9732|5|Product works great and fast delivery
B004W8R824|5|very nice
B005OYPA3E|3|Both pads wouldnt fit into caliper with grinding one down a bit
B00UNTU3VO|5|Great car duster.  Gets all the dust and surface dirt off.
B000XV4EI0|3|Nice basic kit.  It could use some additional items in the first aid kit such as a CPR mask and possibly a thicker bandage ?
B009TC50LE|5|perfect!  super-easy install, works great, right price
B00SSWS6W6|5|excellent
B00WTIJY5S|5|Product was fine  entire experience was fine
B00JT4HB14|5|Love it
B0068ODC1Q|4|Great product
B0097M85AE|5|Excellent
B009XRQYI8|5|Very easy to apply.  Very pleased with the quality.
B000A6Z950|5|Perfect fit.
B00O0NA4M2|5|Perfect.
B000GKEXK2|5|Worked great.  Fits perfectly.  There are many foreign knock-offs of this product that don't fit well in the fuse socket because of poor quality.  You will not have that problem with this manufacturer.  I used it for a radar detector on my Chevrolet.  On my vehicle, the proper way to insert it was so both of the fuses inserted faced downward toward the floor of the vehicle, point down (or so the red wire comes out on the right side).  This is because the left side of the fuse socket of the panel is tied to the battery while the right side goes down to the protected circuit.  If this is inserted incorrectly, your device will still work, but won't be fuse protected like you think.  Incorrectly inserted will make both fuses in parallel.  What this means is that both fuses would need to blow open to stop the electrical current allowing for damage to happen.  I have a digital meter and  used it to map the &#34;add-a-fuses&#34; circuit.  If you hold the device so that the two fuse contacts are facing away from you and you are looking down so the fuses are facing you, the right side connections are common, or better said the side without the red wire are common.  If you remove a fuse on your vehicle and turn on the vehicle, the one contact of the empty fuse socket will have 12V and the other will not.  The side with 12V is where you want the common side connected.
B007QV5JVQ|5|works as it should
B00IT9MBV0|5|it looked perfect. and didn't peel or wear off
B003YCGLJK|5|I am so happy with these towels! I thought they might be stiff and very wrinkled after was washing but not so. They launder nicely, are very absorbent, and dry quickly.
B0009HYQ90|1|Two years using this product and the material is falling apart.
B000KKHR10|4|Looks like the ticket
B003EOZLEO|4|Bought these for a 2015 JKU. Bolts line up okay with new elongated holes. However, the &#34;U&#34;  shaped portion that fits over body mounts had to ground wider with an angle grinder to get them to fit properly. Would have been an easy install otherwise.
B004G488UU|5|Very easy to install and very strong adhesive. Great way to show your an Auburn Tiger.
B008BC8G7S|5|Fit perfectly, fast shipping, great price.
B00WTCSN5G|5|Fit excellent on 2014 Sprinter. Suction cups do hold. Makes a dramatic difference in keeping interior from heating up when used with a front shield also. Would recommend.
B00N3UHSVS|1|Did not fit on seat
B00CDJ8RLU|1|Arrived broken. The bit holders were broken and bits were everywhere. This is a POS. If you're buying for the bits and the driver go for it, but if the case has caught your eye avoid it. Its cheap junk.
B00GHRUC6M|5|Fit perfectly
B00DHGPVKI|5|All great expect shoes jj
B000E0T42G|5|Quality hose, Killer price and fast shipping!
B00BNVK14U|5|I worked as promised and came on time.  The box was a bit flimsy.
B00K1NS0PS|5|Easy setup if you know what your doing<br />Works great<br />Great product
B004RCOUP8|5|Looks great coming straight down and takes pressure off the hose attachment on my RV
B00FTB16M6|5|Great company to deal with items came within 2 days ahead of schedule, parts fit perfectly and with ease.
B00OUDD5M8|5|COOL
B00E7G0BU2|5|Fit good works well
B00G24AGDY|5|Great works good
B007FR3JVI|5|It was a quality kit. Shipping was extremely fast and the item was exactly as described.
B002JR949K|2|Too much money for a piece of plastic with 2 straps..... disappointed!
B00236XLA0|3|not really what I wanted.......did not realize I ordered this piece until it arrived
B004GYJFS4|5|Perfect fit for my 1997 Accord. Looks great too!
B0041U588Y|5|Yes
B002ZTNVTG|2|I love the perfect fit, just not the look.  They scratch/wear poorly and look very worn after just a short time.  They need to make these out of some other material that will hold up visually.  I'd expect better for the high cost.  This is my second set and both the gray and the black performed the same.
B0052XN2RI|1|Ordered for 2013 silverado that it said it fit,wasn't even close and clamp bolt broke as well.Did some drastic modifications to make work.Would not order again.It is 3 inches in diameter and the tailpipe is 2 3/4 inches go figure.
B001TXWNLQ|1|Don't buy it. The product just doesn't work
B003CVPPAY|4|Exactly what I needed for a roller replacement. I was having a problem finding a roller that matched the physical dimensions of the roller I was replacing and this one was a perfect match.
B00603DSGO|5|Very well made however the antenna is 20 degrees off  not 90 degrees perpendicular to the ground. Looks a little off however performs well
B001EAQTRI|2|No left side channel. Only right side sound from truck. Completely removed ground loop noise from the right side. But the left side would have been nice too. I will attempt to solder it for a fix. Too much a waste of time to send it back and wait for another.
B00155237W|5|Great Product
B0017ZGMIQ|5|Shines my truck right up with hardly any effort.
B008CSUTBM|3|They work okay, but they went out within a year, they do throw codes so beware of that! Otherwise they looked great!
B0067PUMXW|5|Actual size of hands. They are separated so they don't have to be placed right next to eachother.
B00B9IPCOG|5|excelente !!!!!!!!!!
B005CKFYEU|5|Fits perfectly help with the Florida heat
B00E9D4NES|3|The sticker for the back fit perfectly, the front however were a hair to short. I tried both in the set and they both had the same problem.
B0001UZUW2|3|The fly shooter doesn't work all that great, but it sure is fun.  Definately worth every penny on entertainment value alone.  :)
B000BQKBP2|4|Works good, exact replacement for original, holds tight
B00HTOB0NG|1|will not purchase againnnn..
B00VWJLOT4|1|Not good
B00GSAUHB8|4|The product fit my windshield fine. I just wish it was silver material on both sides.
B001PWA0IO|5|Best purchase yet. Easy to install. works like a charm. Lowers gate smoothly
B00032K3TS|5|Does what it's supposed to do.  Looks good on car.
B004HE09YC|4|Very easy to install. A nice value for the price paid. Would have been nice to have grease for the calipers included so be sure to get your own. Don't get them on the pads during installation.
B007CL8YQM|1|Absolute junk. Mounting holes were drilled in wrong location. Buy OEM. It will save you a lot of headaches.
B009K9ITY6|2|I bought three of them and not a one does what it said. I have a variaty LED lights and flasher just turns on and stays in a soled light. no flash no ON OFF ON OFF Just steady burn.
B00BTL9ZOG|5|Awesome light quality!!
B000CAINEI|5|Lifesaver ! in the ga hear anything helps, and this helps A LOT. I have no idea how I lived without it.
B00I9IP3X4|3|Bought them for an FJ Cruiser, not the best of fits but will do. Very clammy to sit on.
B0048J2OFS|4|excelente
B000C9SR90|5|Outstanding
B008PJCOX4|1|The timing and balance shaft belts fit so poorly. I could not use them.(looser than the old belts I was replacing) I hope the tensioners will last. The gaskets did fit, but I was left with an assortment of left over grommets and rings obviously for a different car. Save your money and time buy the right parts for your Honda from somewhere else! (ie. Dealer, Auto Zone, etc)
B000CSNK8O|5|These worked perfectly and look great!
B002F4N6UK|5|Seller delivered very quickly and I appreciate it greatly!
B000FQ1XNC|5|Fit perfect....thanks
B0018MITR0|4|Great for the car!
B009DK97TI|5|Very good!
B002NF0IQQ|5|OK, I understand. It's an air filter. Big deal. However, I didn't have to get out in this 100+ degree heat and go find a store and hunt for it. I bought it online via Amazon and it was delivered in a timely manner and was exactly what I needed. Well, I did install it myself in this heat, but saved a lot of money in the process and did wait until the day had cooled to it's low of around 90.
B00MNR8O3S|1|Gave me a old sticker that fell apart.
B006CRT72W|1|this unit has already broke 2 weeks before I could review it, but iam going to order 2 more next time to be safe I hope If they work the price is good
B000N393B6|5|Thank you
B005E5LAKU|3|Seat is great but this add is very misleading. Your buying mustangs vintage not wide vintage. This company advertises it as a vintage wide so you think your getting the wide vintage.
B00P2D3VZG|5|nice bright white, i used it for tag light
B00NO5OMQG|4|Worked as expected, shipped quickly, fixed the leaking carb issue i was having.
B00HJ6O4A0|4|It's good. good price and recommended to purchase
B0081S5IP0|5|They are great, heavy plastic
B00SLKQ2YY|4|These are great.  I had to buy larger washers. the ones it came with were too small and were being compressed into the poly running board.  But they look great.
B0052UFS6O|5|easy programing exact same replacement . save 60.00 over the dealership
B00KTIUG5C|2|Bought these for me and my girlfriend on our 2003 Escape. Both worked fine for the first couple months then mine started working intermittently and the range seemed to become shorter and shorter. Tried using it one morning and it would not work. Bought new a battery and tried re-syncing it to the vehicle but nothing worked. My girlfriend's seems to be working still...for now at least.
B001AXGT7O|5|My husband loves it.  Now we can go down some old dirt roads with the boat and get into those hard to reach lakes.
B004HYSIUY|5|A nice product. Easy to install. Fit perfectly.
B003CH1ZF2|5|OHIOelvis is the king my husbenb looks great in it
B00JAXXD2U|5|Fit the harley perfect
B00U9YZ2AA|5|Awesome fits perfect my cadillac escalade 2002.
B008M5KPDM|4|Look great and replaced the broken bolt. Perfect alternative to buying factory replacements that would just snap again.
B008ECCBFS|5|The tailgate handle fit perfectly. Easy to install. Very satisfied with this order.
B0062IJOJ2|4|Easy to install.  look and work great.  I pit silicone around holes that I drilled to prevent water / salt getting in.  Could also use spray paint. instructions were not difficult to understand as other posters have mentioned.  I put these on 2007 Chevy 3500 quad cab and they worked fine.<br />Install time was 40 mins on 1st one ( doing layout and research).....  20 mins each on the other 3.
B005DUN2NE|4|Super easy install, no slip, pretty comfy for the price.
B00CGGXQV6|5|Great cover for the money. Keeps water out.
B005FKOLI2|5|Fits great on a 2000 Subaru Forester L. Braking feel is improved and requires much less pedal pressure to stop the car. These replaced regular pads and rotors so if you're on the fence about slotted and drilled rotors definitely go for it. The kit also contained slide pin rubber boots which is a nice bonus I've never seen from other pads.
B00DPIDYHU|5|Excellent for my needs.
B000FUNZF2|5|Royal Purple's gun oil seems to work great, we'll see if it holds up in the field and prevents rust!
B007YPRIWM|2|The alphabet &#34;A&#34; is not in the official style.
B000BYGD5Q|5|Fit my 1999 Camaro Z28 perfectly.
B00BCRMAAS|5|I ordered these Oxgord seat covers for the sole purpose of protecting my car seats. I installed them see in a 2013 Camry by myself. I am female, 54 and have a bum arm. It took me about an hour. Front bucket seats are super duper easy. The back seat took longest, but installation was still fairly easy, just time consuming.  I am going to enjoy these seat covers and as you can tell from the pics so is BB. I can take the covers off and wash them too as needed. Now if I had full use of my arm I could have done a better job, just take that into consideration when you see my photos.  I received my Oxgord seat cover set at a discount in exchange for an honest review.
B0001WW37U|4|This is useful for keeping my ps2 game collections
B00HC9K1FQ|5|Nice mats
B00J5J1HPY|3|Works as intended, but about double the price it should be. Should have been supplied with an $800 unit
B00GO7EA7W|5|Exact replacement for 05 honda rancher pretty easy to change aswel
B001P92HVU|5|the idem was as expected great I would buy from this seller again thanks
B003XNGLJU|4|Well, I like the idea of this product though I have no way to know if it works or not. The good news is that I haven't hit a deer.
B008K5ZUT8|5|better than original
B005EPLK4G|5|eliminates the need to add another switch for aftermarket fog lights
B003NGHX4O|5|Worked well on f10 m5
B00B7RBDMO|5|The stabilizer kit worked perfect, it was easy to install, and it did exactly what I needed it to do, which was firm up my steering.
B004940ZNK|5|Fit perfectly on my Saturn 2007 Aura XR. Took me ten minutes to find the tools in my disaster of a garage and another ten minutes to swap out the bad indicator. Need a 9/32&#34; socket to remove the three bolts under the steering wheel and the trim pops off easily around the wheel. Fitting the trim back is the hardest part, but just wiggle jiggle it in place and its fine. Don't forget the steering wheel tilts and telescopes so you can juggle it as needed too.
B00PV37ZEA|4|The velcro does not stick to the carpet.  The size and sturdiness is wonderful.  I wish there was a lid to close it.
B000GAOT88|3|Looks great, lights up. Wish it was metal cause I broke it on my first outing.
B00TUNSOMO|4|This is an easy spray-on way that's simple to use. Spray on, spread with a cloth, wait for it to dry, wipe off.  It does leave a glossy finish that beads water nicely, but it does not fill-in or hide swirl marks.  You'll also need to use some effort to remove the dry polish - by hand works fine, an electric buffer is a lot easier.<br /><br />For a small boat this is fine - I'd say one bottle will handle an 18 footer.<br /><br />It also works well as a finish coat on fiberglass spas, hot-tubs and showers.
B003CLLX5K|3|It says Harley but it is an off brand helmet.
B001RLTTT4|5|work perfect
B00SH1U4T6|5|Good quality
B00KGETCHW|5|Rubber mats what can I say?
B003BG6JU0|5|Nice item
B008A431MC|5|I have a JKU on 37s with about a 4 1/2&#34; lift and wanted to get more stability when daily driving.... I did both front and rear and wow what a difference, I don't feel like I am going to roll over anymore and feels a little more stable on the road
B000BUQOGI|5|Just what I expected and ordered. Thanks.
B00K2SLS7O|5|Excellent - Item delivered on time, was as described, great customer service
B003E3OG4Q|5|Everything was fine , but prime link was cleared and shipping time was extended. Saw the extension before completing order but wanted anyway.
B001GJ3FIS|4|Works great for the price.  I've had nicer ones in the past but paid more money for them.  This one certainly gets the job done.
B003R2YLLC|4|I've had it for a few weeks and it fits perfectly and did not create problems when travelling with a front seat passenger. However, it is wrinkling quickly and hope this does not cause it to weaken rapidly...
B00144EIBI|3|Returned this one and bought the MWR75 as the rough-in hole is 2&#34; in the dash and the MWR100 is larger.
B00AQ48G06|5|fast delivery. exactly as described.  followed Utube video. fairly easy to install.
B00MS3LJNE|4|Looks great. fairly easy to install. took about 10 days to get delivered.
B00AESWZ7O|5|nice
B001P29VY8|5|Good price and works well even with the heat from the headers.
B008XN7SM4|5|The plastic covering is thick, hard and smooth. Seems durable. Also a plastic insert to protect the cap portion of lug nuts.
B00J2N4DQS|2|Doesn't Stay on the sun shade well and doesn't hold sunglasses well. Save your money.
B004I0FJEU|5|Fit perfect. Kinda a pain to replace, but got it done in an hour with the help of José on youtube. Would buy again in a heartbeat if another frisby hits my turnsignal.
B00VZ5O442|5|Barefoot Graphic did a great job with this design and with customer service response. Had a little hiccup, but they took care of the problem promptly. Now, for my opinion of those who reviewed this product, give it a bad rating, without buying it. They need to mind their own business. Don't write about your political correctness junk on this review section . If you don't like it, don't buy it. I'm sure there is a &#34;BUCK FUSH&#34; sticker somewhere on Amazon.
B00AESZEUO|1|Real smaller than I expected
B00230R2JW|4|It's a chain and it works good. I used it on my go kart and it seems to be working great
B000C6205K|1|Gasket in picture is not the one in the box. Misleading
B00C3OFFRY|5|I have an issue with these burning out continuously. Buying them at Home Depot just became too expensive but I love the under-cabinet lighting and wanted to keep them.  Bought them here and they are cheap enough I can replace them without too much guilt. And they seem to be holding up better than the others I had been buying. Will buy again.
B00VEDWKVY|4|Very happy with it  super bright but it does not come with a wiring harness but really easy to make one and you can't beat the price. Super fast shipping got it in 48 hours . Very pleased
B000IZ4ANA|5|Part works well after install (2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee). It was easy enough for my 10 year old daughter to help me with most of the work, using guidance from online video walkthroughs.<br /><br />Window goes up and down at the same speed as my existing OEM part on the other door.
B00CD6VV7A|5|Great replacement part for the stock shocks, which were worn out. They are a little firmer than the stock shocks. Put them on my 2006 Hyundai Elantra GLS in November 2014.
B003YC844K|3|Still awaiting the shipment of the device these work in...<br />3 stars for the concept... more later
B001UCBT4S|4|Sqeeky when cold
B00E1ETJNU|5|Had trouble finding a front license plate bracket for my new 2015 Ram 2500 with blackout package.  This one fit perfectly because the Ram only had 2 mounting holes on the top.  No more bent license plate after coming out of the car wash.
B00IDHLYM0|4|Worked great on my 86 Johnson 70 hp. Fits in stock hole locations, no drilling.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Used in South Florida and so far passing the test and expectations
B00VDQNELW|5|we don't burn our skin as much ! but if I'm driving and its not raining  my tops back!  not the highest quality of neoprene material, it's not wet suit material!
B007EERKIA|5|Beautiful! I have no complaints and was order again.
B0043YIFGU|2|It doesn't get one star, because it will work...with a lot of effort and frustration. If you can see in the picture how the hoses are wound, they never unwind. If you slide them down where you need them, they just curl up and the end is up out of the liquid. You have to try to hold the lower hose in, keep that hose plugged into the pump (it wants to fly off with every stroke), and hold the body so you can push and pull the lever. If you counted, you realize you don't have enough hands to do this. So I try holding the pump shaft down, and keep the hose connected, with my foot, while holding the hose in with one hand and pumping with the other. The outlet hose won't uncurl, so it goes flying around and up with each stroke of water expelled. I bought mine at Walmart (some pump) for $10 or so, but it didn't include the black hose pieces and tips, so maybe there is something about those parts that makes it better. Even so, I suggest trying a better one with good reviews, even if it costs $20 to $30. Also, check out the water cannons, water blasters in the water toys area. I've seen good reviews for that.
B007UHPRAE|5|They are so cute and fit perfect in my car. Mazda 2!<br />And it keeps my car cooler &<br />It protects the dash from sun damage!!
B001LHVOVK|5|Life saver, so far has saved me over $500
B00BYHFWQK|5|no problems
B00FI7X2SW|2|Warning: This is not a &#34;Land Rover Genuine&#34; part as advertised.  It is an &#34;Allmakes4x4&#34; part.  While it does fit the Land Rover Discovery II, it is a very low quality item.  I specifically bought this because it was supposed to be a genuine Land Rover part to replace the existing Allmakes4x4 blade I already had.  The Allmakes part lasted about one month before the rubber insert was shot.  If you absolutely cannot find a different brand for the DII, this will fit, but it's a terrible part.
B00EBIH73U|5|OK
B008BLGV62|5|Worked well
B0006IX87S|5|Great
B0028JJTQC|5|Love this ashtray! I use it in my convertible so ashes don't get blown around. Works great!
B00MQADJI2|5|Sturdy, Beautiful plate for my new  Black Jeep, complimented my license plate beautifully , Love it<br />I did get Black plate screws with caps to complement the plate
B00P5YOU3O|5|perfect for what I bought them for great quality
B000E4VH68|5|fit perfectly.
B00N42YNMW|1|This tail light did not work for my tao tao 110 it has three wires instead of two like the original one on the 4wheeler. Check your wiring it would have been helpful if this was stated in the item description since my 4wheeler was listed.
B004M08FBK|4|Just right
B00L89H8ZC|3|It's a rack. A little cheap made for the price.  Other than that, it's a rack.
B000KE0DCG|3|It was okay. A tight fit,  but it works8 and looks nice. I thought I was getting covers for the console included but not the case. I also had to cut the top to get them over headrests,  mine do not remove.
B004SNLJJ6|2|Two stars: The product is amazing. The ASV shorty levers are solid and responsive. Wouldn't buy any lever again. However, I accidentally bought the wrong lever. Silly me. I re-ordered the correct lever and started a refund for the incorrect. The seller didn't pay return shipping AND charged a restocking fee. Seemed a bit excessive. But maybe Amazon Prime has just got me spoiled. I wouldn't ever order from &#34;RaceCrafters&#34; again. But if you like wasting money they're great!
B007SZBAF4|5|Purchased for my Mazdaspeed3. Fits perfect. Customizable and even when on full recirculation, gives an amazing sound.
B00O7X01O6|5|Exactly what I wanted. Came in original Kia packaging
B00M78820I|5|Much nicer than I expected! For the price I paid I expected a product of lesser quality.  It even showed up a day early!
B002UC4XJ0|5|works as it should
B004GFTC0E|1|Lights came out worse than when I started. Don't waste your money. If I could give this product ZERO stars, I would
B0010E3IXG|5|The valve fits 2004 Jeep Liberty 3.7 very well - clicks right in, turns, locks in place. I'm on my second one, the first one did well for a few years, no leaks anywhere, no oil in the air box.
B00A9HM3MM|4|Product worked exactly as described.
B00NLN8H4Y|4|Looks great works even better
B00C50NI5W|5|easy install.
B00EHIPBFK|1|One of the bulbs is the wrong size.  Despite same number. Rectify this please.
B007Y86KTG|5|Fit perfectly .And worked like a charm. Would buy again.
B007FISJ08|5|just what I needed
B00F2ZH9UW|5|Nothing more to add at this time
B004SHB4VK|5|These are really great, love the look!
B000E7SY16|5|Usefull
B0046BLGZW|5|Awesome floor mats for my GMC Sierra!
B00L3NM4CK|4|Shipping was fast. Everything installed easily. Only slight issue is that the 3k bulbs are more green than yellow. I am keeping these installed, and i would buy this brand again in another color if I was looking for HIDs in the future.
B011C0JGSS|2|Wrong picture the hooks i got today has equal sizes on both ends ie small i will have to bend them bigger my self
B001ABMSGW|5|AFE filters are great.  Have them in all 3 of my cars -- all 3 are super high quality fit.  Really helps to have better air flow, especially for air-hungry turbo/supercharged engines.  Granted I live in a non-dusty area (pacific nw) but I rarely have to clean them or worry about them.
B00P8ZAR6E|5|This was a great purchase for my rig. I have this mounted on my bumper. This came when it was suppose to, installation was pretty easy as i routed it to an overhead toggle bank, as you can see in the pictures the difference in brightness and illumination.<br />1rst is reg headlights, 2nd is high beams, 3rd is highbeams with LEDs, 4th is just LEDs.
B00X8SVVQI|5|Been using this for some time now and love it.  I've had 3 devices charging at a time and when finished it still has juice left in it.  The price was right at the time and with more and more of these chargeable devices becoming part of our lives it seems sensible to have one of these handy when you aren't near a charger or electrical outlet.
B00LVFISBQ|2|4 bulbs didn't work when I received them but they are super amazingly bright.
B0065LTR98|4|I could have used my credit card or reward cards instead, but nothing wrong with the product itself.
B008EFTSTC|5|For the price, it's great. I put the two vehicle ones on my car, and I've gotten lots of looks and laughs. I put one on my rifle and the rest on my ammo cans. I do suggest that you let the sticker stay on whatever surface you place it on, for at least a day before you peel off the non decal plastic. The adhesive backing on the lettering isn't very strong, so placing them on ammo cans (metal ones aren't too prone to this, versus plastic ones) will taking some patience with making sure they don't peel off with the backing. Other than that, a very good addition to any ZORT person.
B005DTWWEU|5|great product.
B00OH13Y9M|1|Defective; all four were flickering within hours of instalation.
B008HIT07G|5|Great item, fast shipping!  Thank you!
B00HYQU2LA|5|All as expected.
B00WAVM3X4|5|So cute! I love them! They shipped quickly too!
B008YFTB4E|5|Awesome
B004LACI64|5|These lights look awesome on my Triumph Tiger, really bright and compact, so far so good
B00HWI209M|5|Awesome
B009DLX6NU|5|Great product. Would buy again. Thanks
B004XRQ44M|5|I ordered these for dad, he loves the scent, I like the price...
B005FI51EM|5|Nice , looks classy
B009NOZ4RI|1|i received fake leds
B001JT14SI|5|Just what I needed!
B0002TDUW4|5|(JOB TIME + SANDING ROUGHLY 5-7HOURS DEPENDING ON HOW FAST YOU WORK)<br />You will need more sandpaper than what thwy give you in the kit fine grain will work perfectly. As the box sys dont leave any gloss showing on painting surface it may not bond well after 1st coat wait 2 hours to let it dry and get sticky then put on second coat use it untill theres nothing useable in the can. When dries its tough and professional looking
B005K79I60|5|GREAT INEXPENSIVE UPDATE
B00AJF9OJ4|4|good
B00JLBD36C|5|Look great!
B00L5U33HQ|4|Made well nice color
B00M9NXUHG|3|Not much success with the first use but I expect to do better the next time. I've learned you should first mow and kill the cover then wait for good rains to soften the ground, without that prep the discs won't cut and the force on the hitch/frame is excessive.. I bent the 1/4' plate on my after market receiver and needed to stiffen it after my first attempt on unprepared ground.
B00375JBL4|3|Not as effective as expected.
B00W5MG8XY|5|This tire pressure gauge works well for it's main purpose, and appears to do a decent job on the other things it offers. Pressure readings are quick and accurate, without any jumping around trying to find the correct reading. It's a bit hard to read the display when you have the valve connected, but the reading stays on the backlit display for a few seconds so it doesn't cause any issues.<br /><br />Both of the LED flashlights could be a bit brighter, but they're only being powered by 1 AAA battery so it's understandable. The seat belt cutter has some flex, but the screws might need some tightening. Also, it appears that it might be a bit difficult to get a good angle when using the window hammer, but I don't believe that you need a lot of force thanks to the sharp point.<br /><br />The tire pressure LCD is powered by a button cell battery (included), and the flashlight and backlight are powered by an AAA battery (not included). All of the features that this tool has are things that you should keep in your car, and now you only have to purchase and keep one thing rather than having to spend money and possibly lose/hassle with them individually.
B001FOBPU4|5|Great cover durable quick delivery
B00B1F0INW|5|For me, this is a must-have accessory that I use practically every time I go the store. Easy to install, the top simply hooks onto the plastic hooks in the trunk and bottom has two clips that attach to the metal lash points on the floor of the trunk. The stretch netting will accommodate putting paper grocery bags in lengthwise to allow it to hold more bags and preventing them from sliding around. 2015 RAV4 XLE.
B005J6VF7C|1|Was not impressed with this product. It was hard to work with and was already wrinkled when it came in. I'll never buy this product again. It did come in on time.
B00B9F1S1K|5|very good
B007GCDM46|2|Worked as a Verizon FiOS replacement battery for 10 months and then expired — the Verizon box is now beeping again so I have to replace the battery. I know this battery is cheap but I expected it to last at least a couple of years.
B00ATP9Q38|4|Looks like it will last for awhile in the sun.
B00JRE38EA|1|Nice bright light, but what the heck, only 5 out of 10 works. Yes, I know it has a + and - side, so that is not the problem.
B000COBXPA|5|The item was as described and arrived when it was supposed to.
B0067UG68W|5|Product performed and fit perfectly. Service and shipping was excellent.
B003RAI23M|5|Perfect fit , can carry cold beverages and munchies on my atv.
B000Q71N8K|5|NOTE: It is VERY easy to plug the power cord in wrong. I didn't realize that was a feature as none of the reviews talk about it and there is only a small line in the description. It gets HOT. I have the melted shredded cheese to attest.<br />Also, completely my fault for not paying closer attention.<br />That said, if you put cold food and/ or drinks in it will keep them cold. I've kept milk, veggies, and fruit in it for a long weekend and all was well. Don't expect it to cool off room temp food, but it will definitely warm up cold food/ drinks.  Great for traveling, if your hotel doesn't have a fridge etc. Fits fine in the back seat of my sedan. Buy the extra cords, you'll probably need them.
B001341K92|1|Not worth the money
B004GZSHSC|5|Saved me tons of $$ over buying it locally.
B00PM3AXCU|5|Fast delivery, arrived before expected, installed perfectly, and working like a dream!
B00CMV922M|5|I'm satisfied with the quality, my car feel like I've changed all my front end parts. I recommend this product if your are looking for your money's worth.
B0009XXN4S|5|Worked fine for my 2002 Chevy pickup.
B00XNRZDIG|5|Shipped quickly and was a perfect fit
B0085TKJ5E|5|Works like a charm, very sturdy all alum. construction. Have on a hybrid bike. Thanks.
B008Y7R4M8|5|bought one from auto parts store here lasted one day quality in this one far exceeds the other one and was less expensive.
B00GDXIQMC|5|Great Graphic!
B007P4V7A6|5|Works well and easy to install.
B000BNZPT2|1|Does not fit my 2009 Dodge Ram 1500 slt

B004ZF39T0|5|Best HID's I've ever had
B0006IX7TW|5|Best little fan money can buy.  Helps keep the air circulating around the camper fridge.
B0013ERRSK|5|This is an absolute must have when traveling with your pet.  I also attend a lot of workshops and this is an amazing waterer for a crate that may get jumped around in.
B00X69TV6Q|4|They are well painted
B006GG68N0|4|Very pretty but had a hard time installing.
B00JRHI1LM|5|So comfortable, would definetly buy again when it's time to replace!!!
B000WJ5I8S|5|I installed the jets and they worked great. I would buy from them again. Great customer service. Thanks
B000RGYTF4|5|Nice shield.  Great fit.  Works well on my husbands Softail Slim.
B00JK2WK9I|5|Quick and easy worked perfect
B000YJAIUY|5|Very cute product! The metal is nice and thick and heavy and only time will tell if the paint holds up. It is a keychain, so it will receive a lot of handling and abuse, so I'm hoping it won't chip or get damaged too soon. I'll update if it does.
B010L7N8H8|4|works as noted. i just wish they were in other sizes. otherwise it's just fine.
B00HQBXIXW|4|Great looking Fuel Door ( See Photo).  It was a little more difficult to install than I thought and so here are some tips that I hope help. I installed this Fuel Door on a 2014 Chevy Silverado High Country.<br />&#62;Make sure you use a newly sharpened or new 5/16&#34; drill bit.  The rivets are  thicker than you think.<br />&#62;Keep the gas cap on to prevent any of the shaving from the drilling to get into the gas tank.  Vacuum all the shavings around the cap and shroud before removing. It has to come out with the existing door since it is attached to it with a tether.  You also have to be careful removing the tether from that old door so that you don't cut the loop.<br />&#62;You might have to remove the two screws holding the shroud to help you remove the existing door.<br />&#62;I suggest you take a small brush and coat the drilled out rivet holes with a metal primer.  This will help prevent it from rusting later.  You can get a quick drying primer at your local hardware store.<br />&#62;The adapter is not too hard to put on but I suggest you put something under the area you are working to catch any of the nuts or washers that might fall if you are all thumbs like me.<br />&#62;I found the best way to install the washers and nuts on the door studs is from underneath the vehicle with someone outside holding the door in place and handing you the washers and nuts as you need them. The nuts are 9mm<br />&#62;As the instructions say, you can attach the gas cap tether on the lower stud of the door between the metal and plastic washers.<br />Enjoy !
B0049D9OLK|5|So far it seems to b a good primer base coat. Works for deep scratches and chips down to bare metal.
B004HMBK5G|5|These work awesome.  No more neck choking seatbelts. I had a set for my old car and now bought a new set for my new car.
B00062YYSG|5|1976 Jeep CJ7 V8 - Best bang for buck upgrade to any small diameter ford dizzy, you must upgrade to HEI style wires.  Now when im ready to swap to a full HEI Dizzy my wires are ready.
B003XGYDE2|5|not bad
B002OR2EYW|5|operated as stated!
B00IPL1MYY|2|They went on easily. Within 2 weeks plastic mounts broke
B00KHUQAY8|5|This was alittle hard to put on the steer wheel  because it was tight. However, once you manage to place this on the steering wheel, it fits like a glove. Looks very nice and elegant. The shiny crystals are a nice touch. I noticed however when driving and when you turn the steer wheel your hand actually feels the crystals and it tickles the hands. Otherwise, great purchase.
B000C7VYBK|5|Great radiator thicker and better built than my stock one. bolted in and had no problems with hoses truck is staying cool now! 1995 Dakota SLT 4x4 3.9
B00750O3TM|5|These have lasted almost a year. I have daytime running lights so these are on every time I drive, the key is to get a decent ballast.
B00BD52OSW|3|problems with the fit , not extreme problems, yet problems
B00L84CW1M|4|Very nice for the price.  The overall quality is not up to OEM, but satisfactory for such a significantly lower cost and fit correctly with no install issues.
B003NHH6LI|5|Good product, easy install.
B007RZ23KQ|5|I installed this sticker on my passenger side visor mirror thinking that the females who would ride my Focus ST would heed the warning and discard all tight-fitting clothing. This has not been the case. Most ignore the sticker and those who read it just laugh. I am disappointed and alone. :(
B002BW3L7E|1|was not white, more of a tan color.
B0052PXO38|3|I like it as it is a great idea, garage floor saver as well as good on our hot asphalt lots and sandy spots in FL.  But it broke upon second use! ;-(
B00761ZPD8|4|Cute:)
B00SIDSPGC|1|Nothing but a shell. No real use for it. Very disappointed.
B005DUK90S|5|these bulbs are very good
B00RPIAVDG|2|I don't know which country this made from, it's so cheap and engine still running well. I hope this parts will last?  Well it's 1 Month & 1 Week later, Engine acting up & running rough. Parts failed with PO101 - Engine running rough. I guess not much you can expect for this kind of price
B006YLO52S|4|Works great!!  Kinda hard to use because it is so sticky. I put on the floor of my new KW. To do a good job you need two people. But I would definitely recommend, very happy with my results!
B00DW954UC|5|Makes setting up that much easier
B00QHBVYKQ|5|love it so easy to apply
B002QGVW3K|5|This item was a perfect fit replacement for original bad battery in a Coleman Rechargeable High Performance Pump Model #2000001881 (with date code 11/2008).  Before ordering I made sure that the dimensions listed matched the dimensions of the old battery.<br /><br />The price I paid ($11.87) was almost 1/2 the price of a similar Lithonia battery sold in a well known home improvement store chain.<br /><br />Battery was pre-charged and I haven't yet done a full re-charge. Will update later if I find any issues.
B006BBHEJW|5|Awesome smell, will definitely buy more 😊
B001SLENP8|2|Started ripping already
B00E1TRDCE|5|Nice deep tone and power
B008H3YIV4|5|Second unit, using 3 of these to build a control circuit that will replace a zapped controller.
B0066TB9FE|5|It's a tail light assembly guys,  The only question to ask: did it fit? and, did it work?  Yes to both.
B006QC36K2|4|Good value, but no instructions provided.  Thank God for internet.
B00HZOC480|4|Very nice floor mats that fit excellent. They are slippery, more like a plastic like polyethylene than rubber. The biggest issue I had was the cargo tray. It being so slick allows things to slide around but also the tray is unnecessarily notched for the 3rd row seat belts prevent you from storing anything up against the side in the cargo area
B006LO4L6I|1|Batteries worked ok for 1 week, then they both overheated and bubbled the casings, now they do not hold a charge for very long any more,
B0063CS8F8|5|Arrived on time. Easy to install. Fit well. Perform as expected. However, remember that any time you have a window open, road noise increases dramatically.
B003YMRO1Y|5|They fit nice and work as needed. Easy to install
B00R8L82WM|5|Fits our '15 CRV perfect.
B00NJ903MY|5|Perfect fit for my 2013 Toyota Highlander fog lamps.  Super white light that's at least 3x brighter than conventional bulbs - enough to finally being able to see the fog lights lighting to the immediate front and sides when on. Highly recommended.
B0027Z6CY4|5|Good product
B00KX8G15M|1|I've had 2 tickets since installing these. They will randomly either hyper blink or the outer bulbs on either side won't work. I can't afford another ticket so I, taking them out. Call me disappointed.
B004VF48YO|5|easy install, werorks great, no more cranking or saying blank blank, i forgot to put down the antenna.  thank you much,
B00BJJZ5Y2|4|Fits perfectly in the holes for the stock mirror. It doesnt feel particularly sturdy, so be careful tightning the bolts. You have to remove the door panel and the speaker in order to get to the plug. It looks great and vastly improves viewing area over the stock mirrors.
B00BTS1BVE|5|Great little plate.  Lot's of comments.
B00TPXO6NA|1|These suck!! The ropes are shredded beyond use right out of the package. I managed to recycle the hardware by simply using better quality rope, but even now one of the ratchet hooks is starting to split slightly. Only in use a couple of months now. Suck! Suck! Suck! You get what you pay for, particularly when it's a knock-off China made product. Future buyers beware.
B000COC7ZU|5|If you are changing valve springs with the heads on the car you need this tool.<br />I have did the springs on my 86 Grand National with this and it worked great. I suggest a good air compressor for this though. I have a little 3gal 100psi max pancake compressor and it BARLEY was able to keep the pressure up. I wasn't sure what psi to run so I went with a 100 and the compressor ran  constantly . Then In between cylinders I would wait to build pressure again. But that's a compressor issue, the tool its self is great.
B001DBVOXW|5|Decent quality. They put a sticker over the actual manufacture's bar code/label and put their small spectra sticker on it which is funny. Can't beat the price though and so far so good!
B00BD5GYNI|5|Great fit
B006573SBK|5|I wish I'd got one of these years ago.
B00JFI6Y4O|5|Very nice product. Installed flush and attached securely. LED's are plenty bright for daytime use.
B000GZIENY|5|Awesome. Quality
B00BSO3JK0|5|They lied its not for my 9-3.
B006CPJ02G|5|got them fast and they where easy to putt on until I went to add a sissy bar than it got a little difficult but it was still good.
B005CLNWGQ|5|Exactly what I ordered, fit perfectly and works great.
B000MX1IC4|5|Sweat! simple to install, fully charged! great product!!
B001P6GONU|4|The instructions to change the combination were very small print. We had to scan it and print a larger copy with our scanner / printer. Aside from that, there really isn't much to complain about with this. As a notary, I can keep my log book and seal secure and with me at all times, and my ink for thumb prints fits in one of the small pockets very easily. Lots of pockets for files, so mine doubles for classes I teach as well.
B00FFAUOPG|4|It did the job!  Worked fine.
B00OQXYKLW|5|Just like the picture
B001PNAPOW|5|Works well with the jeep, remember to reset your computer eny time you change a sensor on your jeep. I hard these sensors were the same as OEM and I am pleased.
B001GPX3RA|5|Very nice tag.
B00LCDMB0Q|4|very nice product if you follow directions properly. Only wish that they were more size specific. Not a fan of the big overlaps between sections.
B003CXHREY|5|Perfect fit...high quality...thanks
B000EDST1U|2|too thin
B0066QVM3Q|5|it fits 95 BMW 318i. No more red faulty lights.
B00Y1HSHHG|5|great price
B00VP67C7C|5|great
B00E3BRS9I|3|It worked just fine, thanks to the several different adapters that were provided.
B008B5X5GC|5|Half the price the dealers wanted and a perfect swap for my 2009 Chevy Traverse. Easy install, don't let the dealers charge you to reprogram, just needs to be installed and than follow the relearn procedures found in your owners manually. Easy fix! Saved me tons of money!
B004L439FE|4|As described
B00136OJZ2|5|ok
B00URR4O5I|5|Great stuff like this product very much.
B010LIHXAA|5|The product is as described. Delivery time and price are excellent.
B00VR6ZXAS|5|Good design and well made.
B00K1KNCOK|4|Not bad for the quality but note they aren't as bright as I expected.
B001G8KABE|4|Fast delivery and easy installation
B001R93K0K|5|Awesome, great, love it
B001KSGJKQ|5|Worked perfect.  Fixed my cruise on my '08 GMC pickup
B003UT3S6Q|5|Sonax performs as advertised. My 10-spoke sport wheels have never been this clean since I bought the car two years ago. And the best part is that the wheels stay clean long after using Sonax. Be sure to spray Sonax on dry wheels. Watch the spray go from iridescent green to red. Then rinse the wheels. Fabulous! No more bruised knuckles from scrubbing in between the spokes.
B004B2GL6U|5|Great product
B0052LIMWU|4|Works good, thought I ordered the one with ceramic beads, I received the one with wooden beads, I'll see how long it lasts, the color is already wearing off of them.
B00DILTFP4|4|It's very nice to be able to buy wiper blades online and be assured it will fit your car. (I did get this one for free through the Vine program.) It fits my Honda CR-V nicely and leaves the windshield very clean. But why are they sold in packages of 1? I have never had a situation where I only needed to replace one blade, as they are always installed as a pair..
B0002SQYTG|5|Incorrectly identified by Amazon as a &quot;Dial Tire Gage (sic)&quot;, it is really a pencil-type.<br />An excellent and wonderfully compact Tire Pressure Gauge.  Compared its readings with those obtained from my Accu-Gage instrument, and they differed by only one half (1/2) psi..
B009902XR0|1|What a rip-off. The pad shredded in a single use.
B00D9C2CDO|1|The poor review isn't for performance, it's for the misinformation about this product. As soon as I opened the box, there was a manual saying that the bag was treated with chemicals known to cause cancer and birth defects, so you have to wash your hands every time you touch it. Also, it said it was not waterproof although the description online clearly says &#34;waterproof.&#34;  These things should be available in the description before you buy it, not after.
B0009TO4G8|1|This item did not meet my application - wrong type and don't make one for my 200 HP merc outbd.
B001PYG46O|4|This clutch master cylinder works like the OEM one, but it has three little issues that I didn't like.<br />* First being that it's squeaky.<br />* Second the black cap doesn't stay on (suppose to snap in place, but doesn't hold)<br />* And third; where the clutch line attaches to doesn't mate too great when your using a braided stainless steel cable because of the ridge around this spot, it messes up crush washers.
B0016KHD8A|5|Great fit. No more messy grease. Works great
B00J2CHYZQ|1|One of them quit working in the first five minutes!
B008FCCY04|5|Like it!
B005C57H7M|5|aesthetically pleasing and very ergonomic. Super comfortable and a great price. Shipping was very quick.
B00W46VD2W|4|Good clear light!
B00IORGVAO|5|Makes a noticeable difference in wind deflection on my 2015 Suzuki GW250 and looks good doing it! Perfect fit and finish to match the bike quite well. I wouldn't mind if it was bit taller to deflect from the helmet area a little better, but to keep the sleek look, I can understand why it's not. I will purchase Puig windscreens for any future bikes that might need one. Great quality and easy to install!
B00BUHM4B0|5|Fit perfect
B0017L93ZE|3|It fits a 1997 Wrangler Sport with a 5.5&#34; Rubicon Express longarm lift.  It is more restrictive than the Borla it replaced.
B0013REXSO|5|Awesome product
B005KLSPP6|4|Comfy grip only con is that it seems to leave your hands a tint of black at the end of day from the rubber.
B00029XHZ4|1|First one I got, one of the horns didn't even work. Second one I got, horns were WAY out of tune. Sounds horrible. I wouldn't recommend buying. Maybe find another brand, that's what I'm going to do.
B000JFJMGO|5|Good test product
B00EPYDYGE|5|I put it on my 2011 F-450, only gained about 1 mpg pulling a 40' fifth wheel camper but sure did gain low end power. Install was easy but what the typos in the instructions.
B00AMPJ4Y6|5|It fit very well and easy to install.  Just one month so far so good
B000BRQ0TW|5|Worked great for sealing the tubing in my outdoor fountain.
B0068O17UO|5|Awesome shock very stiff
B000XBCURW|5|My hot tub cover reaches 145 degrees F in the sun and this keeps it soft and looking great. it is also wonderful on the plastic and rubber on my cars.<br />.
B00AC6Y7UG|5|Perfect size for my trip. I like the large clear plastic top. I put my solar battery bank and I can charge my devices on the road. One draw back is the sun reflection from the clear plastic could be irritating. Over all, it is a very good tank bag!
B004TAZ6K6|4|Fit alright didn't think you would have to cut pieces out of the mat to make it fit. Overall it does it's job. Would like it if it was thicker and felt a little more heavy duty.
B0006ZFRQG|5|I bought two lifted a concrete walk and poured cement under it worked great lifted a lot of weight
B00TGK6QVC|1|very very small.
B000NJ4DO2|4|Very useful for keeping out the afternoon sun. It is a bit shorter than our awning, but that's fine as we can move it one way or the other as needed. It's a bit heavier and more awkward to manage than I had anticipated. Putting it up is a two-person job.  I know that some people say they leave theirs installed and roll them up in the awning. We did that once and felt it had the potential to damage the awning motor so don't do that anymore.
B00JXS39VC|5|Got on time and it bolted right up to my winch bumper. Works flawlessly.
B00BD3G2IC|3|picked the front end up 2 1/4 inches and leveled out the ride. rides good but lost that sporty feeling
B0040AE7WS|5|Looks great
B00IGYHPI2|4|Works almost as good as the genuine. I totally recommend this product.
B00O7CLV1O|3|Was ok. Not much in the tubes. Starbrite marine grease seems better. Adheres better than lucas and thicker.
B00BITL9JS|5|Perfect fit for 1996 Toyota Corolla at a nice price.
B001RKH7FS|5|Works well.
B0031ZDU62|5|worked great.  buy a whole set for less than the cost of two  OEM&#62;  worked just fine.  If you have a customer that needs more than 1 coil,  just replace the whole set.
B003XET6JG|3|Plating comes off easily exposing copper below
B007QBTN8Q|5|Despite that amazon says this does not fit my vehicle, it does... like a glove! This unit did not have the little tube that hangs off the back of the motor housing. I have just installed it so I cannot comment on the longevity of the unit just yet, but spun real fast and started my engine right up!<br /><br />After determining that my starter motor was faulty, this product saved the day! the price is great and the part works!
B000772HVQ|3|nice, but kind of expensive
B00QLGDZ0Y|5|We got a good product. We got it shipped to us faster than expected. We were able to get our Ducati up and running the same day.
B00O83OQJQ|5|Excellent!!!
B0002Q7ZSM|5|Everything worked perfect and was very easy
B002UC18HU|5|difficult to remove old control valve - had to adjust angle for new valve, but works great
B000OCHF2A|5|excellent tool....excellent quality
B000C8T86M|5|works great
B007H2PZ72|5|I love it, and it's comfortable.  I not only use it when I go out; but, also around the house, inside and out.
B00GD2HYQW|5|works great
B00DW4YLLK|1|This spout is terrible!<br />The black cap cracks easily.<br />The thin rubber seal that is supposed to seal the spout tight tears easily so it leaks without it.<br />The spout itself will take you 20 minutes to pour 5 gallons of gas from the container - veeeerrrry sloooooow!!!<br />I bought myself a funnel, and pour gas from the gas can without using this spout.  I just need to find good seal caps without spouts to seal the cans for transport now and throw these PoSs away!
B002RLCOBS|5|Perfect choice!
B00353PWAW|5|love it
B009FUF6DM|5|I bought these to use as burp rags. They were a cheaper alternative to diaper cloths, and they have been wonderful! So absorbent and have held up very well.
B0008F671S|1|Not a directly bolt on ,you will have to drill your step bumper
B000BGK2QA|5|This was exactly what I needed. It worked well. I was very satisfied.
B0081T3PP4|5|Worked really well
B00BMPENV4|5|Very good quality thank you
B00S7NX0RW|4|Yes, they are rubbery unlike the popular competition and the fit is good and medium weight as you might expect.  Overall quality is good for the price.  Now that has fulfilled 90% of the good questions - the tags fall off but that's no big deal to glue back.  Some white residue but rub them down.  It's too soon to talk about wear and elasticity in the wintertime - Minnesota, yeah.  We need these things to keep it clean.
B00QHENFKK|5|makes quite a statement for such a little item.  Love it
B000NWA8M0|5|Did what it needed to do. Not faulty like the original switch in the Saturn L300.
B009AA2FAY|5|I had the infamous &#34;service air bag&#34; light come on.  Rather than just changing one sensor (that was indicating as bad),  I decided to changed both front sensor while I was at it; I saved $350 (total cost) from what the dealer wanted to replace just one sensor.  It took me only 45 minutes - start to finish and problem solved!  The replacement sensor looked identical to the OEM.  NOTE: be sure to remove the battery and / or ABS fuse(s).  If in doubt as to which fuses to remove, remove battery cable from battery and wait at least 20 minutes for any residual power to drain - you don't want an airbag to go off and then spend $1000's in repairs.
B00J5CVMLU|2|product is just ok..didnt really clean my car surface nor leave a shine ,especially tree sap..Not very effective on wheel cleaning either..I'd not recommend
B00E1WT64O|5|This is beyond perfect. I've had a lot of complements from friends and strangers I've found taking pictures of my jeep.
B000COVXDM|5|Any fastener taken off may just become very important, so, keep it all until you're finished. The Product is strong: incomparable to the OEM. If these came as original equipment  I wouldn't be typing this ......
B0016KH1XM|5|works great. keeps boat from rolling
B00MHJUM1Y|5|It fits my Mazda well and I really enjoy it. Very fun
B000VL1TIA|4|Pretty much as expected. They're a little big but do the job.
B00JQ26CUK|2|Not what I was looking for
B00NRPKTLU|1|Burnt out in a day
B00J6FD1SI|5|Awesome Pads !
B00371YNYS|5|Fixed the overhead light. Not a problem.
B003K5S4NW|5|Very useful as the car wash never seem to get my glass clean and this finishes the job for me
B00BUSOKBQ|5|Works great easy to install. Still working great!
B005MZZ99A|5|Love it!
B00K7VE2VK|5|As advertised. Simple/easy to use. Cleans well. The spray bottle format comes in handy for quick touch-ups too.<br />Just get yourself one, and pick up a spray bottle and a bundle of microfiber rags at your local Pep Boys, then go to town.<br /><br />On a side note, I usually get soaked when I wash my car at home(I'm a klutz); not with this, since you just don't use water as much as one would with a hose.<br />Of course, there's no run off going back into our water supply, so it's better for the environment, if you care about that stuff.<br /><br />Wish I had found this a while ago.
B00EDQ1Z6K|1|Blew out the first time they inflated with no load in the vehicle.
B003P64XU4|1|Note:  after six months:  these do NOT rotate in the wind!  They don't suck up any fumes; they DO allow fumes to escape through a pretty large unobstructed opening.  But look at it:  a  wind vane determines direction, there is no reason for it to spin!  However when a gust hits the opening it makes a groaning sound, like a wild animal grunt, LOL.  So it is Not Silent.
B000182E5K|5|Shipped fast, all hardware included, Great Quality!!!<br /><br />The install is a piece of cake.  The pre-installed tape allows you to line it up and hold it in place while you put in the self tapping screws.<br /><br />Just a friendly tip:  Get yourself a small drill bit (about 1/3 the size of the screws provided) and drill the 4 wholes (already pre-drilled on the visor) first.  It eliminates the risk of stripping screws or cracking the visor.<br /><br />Entire install took me 7 minutes as I had the drill and the bit waiting.<br /><br />I definitely recommend :)
B000EQ2PP8|4|These do not fit 6 lug 2nd Gen Tacoma's. The Akebono ACT906 does fit six lug Tacoma's though.
B003FBV8ZW|5|Best moto glasses deal Ive found.  I bought second set
B00HWIB0FM|5|My husband is renovating an ancient golf cart.  The &#34;La Cucaracha&#34; horn was the perfect finishing touch!!
B003VEZSAO|5|I saw one of these on the road today and it cracked me up. I doubt the man driving the van actually meant he was a cuckold and his wife sleeps around, but you never know. As long as everyone buying this understands what a &#34;hot wife&#34; is, no harm done. I do wonder how many are blissfully unaware of what they're telling the world. Five stars for letting people stick this on their cars! Very entertaining, and I thank you!<br /><br />P.S - Tell your wife I said hello.
B00YJIB7WE|1|The only thing miraculous about these probes is that they worked as long as they did: about one week.  The black water tank probes have a plastic sheath over the actual brass probe up until about the last 1/8 of an inch.  The probe itself is just a brass nail.  The liquid in this tank will very quickly corrode the tiny exposed part.  As well, they are very difficult to remove.  After some time, they will become almost impossible to remove.  I just cannot recommend these for a black water tank.  In my opinion, there are too many design problems with these things.  I should note that my monitoring system uses a 12VDC switch to ground to determine continuity. Perhaps a more adaptive resistance measurement system would work.
B00KUBKUQ8|5|Bueno
B00MG687JW|5|It did meet my expectations , I have not had the opertunaty to use it yet.
B00IOBQDTY|5|Very good
B00HHG910A|5|This works well but the batteries died surprisingly fast. I think they lasted less than six months, which is odd because I hardly ever used it.   Update: the seller contacted me within a couple hours of my writing this review and offered to give me fresh batteries and fresh product! That's more than generous customer service in my opinion! I look forward to my new product and I will tune in six months later to tell you if the fresh batteries helped.
B0002MA3OO|4|Husband was pleased with these.
B002OPYXDE|4|Seems be made well. I put on my cycle. Sitting on my seat couldn't look over it if I needed to. Had to cut bout 3 inches off the top. There was a better style I found later aft I had already ordered this one, $4.00 mo
B008G3KCHE|5|I was very pleased with delivery and fit.
B0009H51ZS|5|FRAM quality construction.  Fits perfect in my 2002 Toyota Tundra.  Will be back to order another when the time comes.
B00MK6I9LY|5|Nice i like it
B00L4TF32G|5|Worked Great.
B001L1MGDG|5|great product
B00IQWHI9K|5|Excellent product and price!!
B00029XI3A|4|I like this alarm
B000C5I4DS|5|arrived on time.. easy to install.... perfect fit.
B00HTVHYXY|5|just right
B00A2DW4HW|5|A very excellent product mad by eevelle,might be a little pricey but it is worth it
B002LBQ6R2|5|fit very well work great and gives great protection thanks
B00CLXZKRC|5|I give it 5 stars.  An excellent product.  It's not overwhelming! We love it and have given as a gift too.
B001DVROOU|1|Good idea poorly made cheap plastic.
B0068EQ7F4|5|fit the 4tec engine perfectly.
B000VJHPWG|5|Great product.
B000C55KXK|5|Exactly what I needed when my coil spring snapped in two(95 camry). I didn't want to go through replacing springs only as it would have cost almost the same and these things were easy to put on. Saved about $200.00  a pair from all the local auto parts stores!<br />Make sure you get engine specific I do think they are different ones for 4cyl vs 6 cyl.
B00BCRMBGQ|1|If I could give this product zero stars I would. I understand the price is cheap but defiantly don't throw away your money. Almost  impossible to install, smells, and very cheap material. I had to remove them after spending so much time getting them installed because they streach ed and looked bad after only a few days.
B00852MK30|5|Very solid mount. Worked perfect for mounting LED light bar on my ATV rack. I will buy again.
B0054YE8AU|5|just what i wanted
B00BV85HBC|5|All standard length fuses, great deal for a 60 piece assortment<br />They come in a nice plastic box also, keeps sizes separate and well marked in the lid
B00G35E0AW|4|Doesnt move around on the bar like some people said. Doesnt look water proof but im sure it will be fine.
B00IUV846I|5|&#60;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/xHub_4QOBz0&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&#62;&#60;/iframe&#62;
B004NV42PQ|5|great deal much cheaper than Motion Pro and same quality.
B00ZUZQM02|5|Great product. Should include at least one handle considering what you are paying for the kit.
B004BZML7U|3|Made installing my headers much easier. Stock dipstick would not fit back in. Tightening the header bolts down tends to pull the dipstick out of the motor
B000DZGP2Y|5|A nice water pump kit, at a good price....OEM kit double the price.....Quick shipping also!!!!!!!!
B002XM51CA|4|Nice fit and stay on while traveling as well. Have held up well in the weather and help to keep some of the dirt out of the trailer.  Would recommend them to others.
B00KIGQ2KS|3|The covers smell like new tires.  Once I washed them the odor disappeared some.  I used a lot of air freshener and all is okay now.
B001RBCU90|5|Thanks
B004PLICEG|5|Great seller would recommend using.
B00JIJ4LWW|5|excellent
B000C5I6H2|1|What appeared to be a good selection of different types of appropriate parts, nonetheless failed to include one suitable for my vehicle<br />Probably good, if you get lucky... but consider paying the extra to get exactly what you need.
B006VKIV68|3|Wish they were a little larger. Price could be better. Still look nice
B008GN21VY|5|Great part & fast shipping.
B009QLBDSW|5|Good product fast shipping
B00ABZD8CG|4|Really like however, be aware they are larger than the picture shows. About the diameter of a quarter. I was expecting more like a nickel.
B00FXWLD88|5|The item was as described and arrived when it was supposed to.
B000C0TBGW|1|DID NOT FIT!  Purchased it because there is problem with the AC on my Dodge 1999, Ram 1500, 5.2L V-8, and I wanted to by pass the AC.  This belt is 88.5&#34; long, and as it turned out, my truck needed a 90&#34; long belt.  The correct size belt is a &#34;Duralast&#34; 900K7.
B00N44P49G|5|Fit my 02 Sportster.
B00MBDM7BO|3|The levers in real life look a lot more orange-ish than they do in the picture on Amazon.
B00AQKITE8|3|Sticker didn't match picture. Picture shows black background. Sticker was reverse color. Which I prefer. :)
B000CMGXV6|5|Amazon is second to none!  I am totally satisfied with my purchase and saved lots of money buying a used but quality product from Fabtech
B001SIFPRG|4|Love them, however the Gas Pedal is a little wide for my application (SlingShot)
B001HATY36|5|Great product and fast delivery
B0038KT546|5|THEY WERE PERFECT THANKS GREAT PRICES ALSO
B00DV5JB6K|5|Worked out great..
B00VQX4O7A|5|Just put these on my 2011 Nissan Xterra Pro and they function perfectly!  I'm very pleased with this purchase!
B00XPTJ702|5|Great looking heavy duty easy to install product.
B00FSAV5LU|5|It's amazing!  Works great.  Perfect option for in-between full washes.
B00KTIZ2C4|5|I bought these when I bought a used Taurus.  Someone told me to go to the dealership to get a replacement key fob.  I called a dealership and they wanted a couple hundred dollars to replace it.  I was amazed when these arrived and my hubby programmed them himself.  You basically follow the instructions that are included...........so easy!  So worth the money!!
B004KED7RU|5|nice puller
B00PXMADPW|5|Perfect for our 2015 Acura MDX! Great quality and keeps everything in the back from shifting when taking corners. Especially with groceries!
B005ZWM0R4|5|Excellent tool! I have a 99 Jaguar XJ8 and needed to clear the check-engine light after replacing a faulty gas-cap. Device comes with a short manual. The software (downloaded from obdlink.com) is easy to use (I have Windows 7). It was very simple to view the error codes and clear them. The check-engine light is gone. Thanks!
B00DZ359RI|5|Was the correct size, came in a timely manner and ready to put in.  In fact the last battery in this moped was from the same company years ago!
B00TAGXQL0|3|Diameter of hose was too large seems to run slightly larger than the size you need.
B00IKSKQDU|1|i got an empty package in the mail.
B000NPNXOW|2|Not working for me.
B00192JGY4|5|I appreciate knowing how much propane remains in the tank.  Great product that was very easy to install.
B005FL2T3A|4|Seem to work very well so far, have only had them about a month. Very little brake dust . Definitely upgrade from factory brakes.Can not give them 5 stars only because I don't know how they will be with long term use .
B00PMN7PJO|5|It came earlier than expected and in vert good condition, the quality is also very good!! I really recommend it for any Hetalia fans!
B00657WL3G|5|Essential to achieving a good/durable bond!!!👍 A much needed tool to push our excess Rapid-Tac-Tac setting solution and resulting air pockets trapped between the decal and it's mounting surface. Not a real sharp edge but enough to move stubborn air pockets that will not press out. Smooth and flexible allows for a reasonable and firm pressure on the decal transfer paper without damage to the decal. Highly recommend!!!!😃
B002N5PO2Y|5|Works well
B010H0QV00|5|I was given a discount to purchase this item for considering a review.  This is a great tool that I leave in the console of my vehicle as a matter of safety.  Although its primary purpose is as a tire gauge, the tools that are included are quite handy and give you lots of bang for your buck.  The pressure readings are within a half pound of an expensive dial gauge that I have, and I think the seat cutter and glass breaker could be lifesavers.  The other tools are actually quite functional and of better quality than I expected.
B003ZWJLSM|5|This handle fit perfectly!
B00AIJY2ZM|5|I still don't understand why car manufacturers use LEDs as standard equipment. These Sylvania's are perfect replacements for the OEM bulbs. Not to bright just perfect !!!!!
B003VLBPJA|5|Dad loves his new tarp for the back of the quad!!
B00TEA5PZC|5|Perfect license plate frame, and can't see how anyone could steal it.. unlike others, all parts were there, however I used the parts supplied by Mercedes as they fit better and worked just fine with plate cover...
B00EL7D8I4|4|I Test ran it when I got it but not used it seemed to work great
B004BTGY10|5|Works great so far, been in about a month or so. Backlight is a little different, but is a pleasant light blue color. No complaints.
B00VOV59FA|4|Needed some adjustment but worked good!
B001EZ3SKY|4|preformed as expected
B00KY0MPH2|5|Works great
B00USJM0FQ|5|Great product
B000KYYMKK|5|Great remote, works just like OEM.
B000E63KD4|1|Was supposed to be a switch for a dodge and it wasn't
B00C5SQ1CQ|5|Fast service, good product
B001RKH7FS|5|This is totally awesome I bought this for my husbands truck because there was no console and he loves it
B00AC6YSD2|4|Doesn't look so good when it is not completely packed full. I personally not recommend Black. As it soak up so much heat, all my power bars and snacks are melted. If you have an under the seat exhaust, mounting could be challenging. Straps is not long enough to reach other alternative mounting points. End up I have to make my own straps. I bought it because the price is reasonable; otherwise, I will just buy a waterproof duffer bag.
B001EP28XW|4|As advertised.
B006ONRS9I|5|easy install looks great!
