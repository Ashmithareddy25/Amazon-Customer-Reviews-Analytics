B001LHVOVK|5|Works with my 2009 Ford Escape.  I've had two nagging, on again/off again indicator lights (check full fill inlet and engine light).  Used this device and determined the light had to do with capless fuel tank having some debris.  Use gas tank funnel to clean around hapless full tank and then bought a locking cap for the &#34;capless tank&#34;.  The used this device to reset those annoying indicator lights.  This $19.xx device saved me from having to go to the dealership and saved me some auto repair bucks - yay!!
B0056OFWVM|5|Not used it to many times yet but it sure beats having to pull and tie off the slack. I recommend it
B00029XGNM|5|Worked great, did the job perfectly, would recommend to a friend, it's real loud Nd super easy to install, great product
B002E02MOQ|4|Used this on my 2008 Honda Civic, applied it with a random orbit polisher as recommended, it worked great! Will follow it up with a coat of synthetic wax shortly.
B001O0GJK0|4|Excellent product in the exception for scratch Very easily, even when hand tightened.  My solution, Powder Coated...
B003NWSCBG|5|Awesome. Lights are bright, and waterproof. I dont think 14 pods are enough for my 2014 Superlow XL1200T, so I also ordered the 10 pod kit as an ad-on. They really make my bike glow. Installation was a breeze, about an hour. Plenty of wire, and easy to connect. Not only DID I buy again, but I will buy more in the future.
B001K7TZ6C|4|It's exactly what I was looking for. The only negative is that its not black. It's more of a blue black
B002BQJC0K|5|My son loved these gloves.  They are good quality and they came earlier than expected.
B001UEB2ZC|2|Not the sellers fault! Doesn't replace the stock lower line to my radiator on my 04 express 2500 4l80 as amazon has it listed to. Since my old trans lines are shot and I need the truck on the road and cant wait 2 days for the right part I had to re bend the lines to make it work. Typical AC Delco part. Top of the line! Just not the part I needed.
B00B0U4ERE|5|it is extremely comfortable and what I had hoped it would have been. However the logo is a little small
B00JPYIS4W|3|not bad rear plate barely fits on dodge car, bought factory touch up paint to get the correct blue. Otherwise the wife was happy with it
B009PP3KGC|3|They do the job, but if you are looking to add style to your vehicle, these are not the ones to get. They are very thin and look cheap. If you simply want functionality, then these will work.
B001EKCFTO|4|Works great!  I bought this thinking it was a finish line series, however it is the starting line.  Great starter gun.  If you want something better-find a devilbiss finish line.  I like the case.  keeps everything together and organized.
B005FYO4LW|5|Comfortable, stay in place, stay cool, look great. Haven't had them long enough to comment on durability as I have only used them for a few rides. I like the absence of velcro around the wrist. They slip on easily, don't scratch or bind, and stay on well. Grip handlebars well too. Got the orange color and they look sweet.
B0038YPF28|3|this-Carrand buffer- is not made by Carrand- It is made by turtle wax-they just have different stickers on the front.you oppose-look on other side it says Turtle wax CO.One beef,only got one pad says 3pads in the paperwork-Carrand.I payed about $ 26.00 with amazon-Walmart-$ 20.00 + Tax 10 %-the one I got from amazon works great.  Another beef,The foam pad is not worth a dam .Saw  turtle wax sticker,And though good at least I'm buying a product made in the U.S.A.- NO - WAY- MADE- IN CHINA.I EVEN HATE TIPEING THAT WORD- SO LOOK FOR ANOTHER FOAM PAD,MAYBE 4- SAVE ON SHIPING.GOOD LUCK
B003AVWOEG|5|I used these to fab mounts for the engine and tranny in my woods buggy. They held up perfectly during this problem even while Tig welding just inches away. I'm sure in service they will work great as well.
B000NN5V1M|5|Thank you Good item
B006CPMGEA|5|Worked exactly as advertised for my 2005 Toyota 4Runner. It came with a remote (with battery already installed), small key ring, and programming instructions. I've read people have had trouble programming their remotes but I believe it's more about the general convoluted nature of the instructions themselves, rather than bad instructions given. I followed the instructions exactly as they were written and my remote was correctly programmed on the first try. Would recommend this product for anyone looking to replace their remote.
B003NI1H6W|5|Product fit perfectly on my 2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo.  Works really well.  I can open the hatch only about 6&#34; and then let go and the lift supports take it up the rest of the way.  It takes some pressure to close the liftgate but that was expected.  Overall, great product.
B000BO54XI|3|This is a great little warm mitt. It does the job and the price is right. I don't expect it to last forever, but when it wears out,I know where to get another one.
B00306FOH0|5|Doe it run on gas and is it 4 wheel drive
B0056DJLOC|3|I ordered this thinking it would be pink because the description says PINK metal bike.  Although it is silver I chose to keep it because I like what it says. Disappointed that it is not pink metal as description says.
B004C4YRFO|5|a++
B00NARSW3M|1|Did not fit my car which was listed as one of the years it would fit. I refuse to pay the return shipping to China!!
B004SR7KCC|1|This product is not near the OEM product. It is made with cheap material. The motor make noise when it  run. It do not stop at any point when tested without mounting on the vent. It has rust in one part. Delivery was prompt and free, but as I am returning it I have to pay the return postage. It would cost me $6-10. So think twice before ordering it.
B00061SGZO|5|Well worth its money works like a charm
B004HEBN1A|2|Came damage
B00AWRFAHY|5|I wish I had discovered this earlier. I might have saved scratching my new windshield.
B00068WNZG|5|I've used this product for years on any plated sterling silver i have.  I have used many things before and came across this product and never used any but it since.  A little goes a long way, has an smell to it, rub it on and tarnish comes off with little scrubbing.  Would try anything else. I'm sold....
B002HSD19A|4|Good quality product. Really tough material. Only complaint is that they were extremely hard to put on. But look great once you put them on. Wish they had tinted ones tho
B0064BAGZS|5|perfect and no cons
B002NAKVOA|5|I had inadvertently purchased the wrong headlight set. This company was great to work with in getting me the correct headlight set and always responded to my emails quickly, plus the headlights are great!
B0013916XW|5|Purchased these before we actually owned the 2014 Jeep Unlimited Sahara. Simple install. Does what it is suppose to do.
B000E4D5QI|5|Great product, I had an accident and the Ford Dealership wanted $200.00 to replace it. I found it here and the product was great. No problems whatsoever!
B00DJ3D6LU|2|First of all this is feedback for the mfg more that the seller.  The product did not come with any installation instructions, NOTHING.  It did have a disclaimer about moisture getting inside the lens and how to prevent it, so I hope this is not an indication of bad things to come.  So it would be helpful for them to tell you that the low beam lamp is not included as it is stated on the Spider Page that is it and that you need to install it before installing the fixture.  Also no instructions on where to install the LED wires that are loose and I looked on the sypder page and they don't list instructions for the Elantra model, so I'm winging it off another model.  The other model does tell you to remove lamps from old fixture and put in new, but this does not work for the elantra.  More to come when install is completed.
B00QN62V0M|4|It is good
B00N6DBXG8|3|This is like glows instead of a direct beam.
B00J8WK54C|5|a1
B000C9RRA0|5|Installed on 82 El Camino with a V6. After just having bought the car, I wasn't really sure what was on it. For the price, I just like replacing things with what I KNOW is supposed to be on there. I wasn't getting any O2 codes, I just wanted to ensure the right part. Well, what was ON the car, WAS certainly a different part#. And after replacing, I saw quite a bit of difference in the dwell readings.<br />So for my purpose, just getting the right part on a used car, was important. In fact, with the price, I really think I could recommend replacing O2 sensors fairly often. I should also add that I purchased the O2 sensor socket kit quite some time ago and it has been worth it. It was a 5 minute job. I highly advise NOT waiting until you get a )2 sensor code, to change out your O2 sensor.<br />Nice purchase, fast shipping. ACDelco? Lord. What more could you want for your GM car.
B0002HRBSU|5|What can one say about this item besides it works as designed. I always keep a spare or two of these plugs in my Jeep to replace it when its insulating washer breaks.
B006JD4IJ6|5|the seat covers were great I ordered front and back and than come back and orderd for another truck they are great and I recommend to use these to save the original fabric. Good quality for the money
B001V3959W|5|Finally, some polarized glasses that actually fit and work!
B005EHNU8S|5|Wife loves these, keeps me from using her car though.
B000EDOTHI|5|Nicely-made and good-fitting cover for the portable Wave 6 (not the wall-mount).  We also use it when putting the heater back into storage for the summer. It's heavy enough to protect the heater from dings and dirt.  Too bad it's made you-know-where.
B004IAREGG|5|This kit works great and has given my truck a much more aggressive looking stance, and helped clear the larger tires.  Installation took some effort, but I was able to accomplish it in my garage with basic tools and a floor jack.  I DID have to have a complete alignment after installation, but that was expected.  No change in ride comfort, and only a barely noticeable reduction in cornering.  All in all I am very pleased with this lift kit.
B001O2ZT90|5|Great Product.Perfect for my needs
B000EBICMI|3|I measured my windshield before ordering and ordered the size based on measurements. However, the sunshade doesn't cover as much as I expected - there are gaps at the corners and between the two pieces in the bottom center due to the rounded corners of the shades. The material is also very thin and doesn't block light (and therefore heat) very well. I have subsequently ordered a one piece rollup Heatshield custom fit shade which I received a couple of days ago and it fills the windshield perfectly and it doesn't let any light through so the car interior is darker and cooler.
B008KZKAMK|5|So simple and easy to install.  It took less than 60 seconds to install.  The dealer sold me one that took an hour to get installed and would have been impossible to quickly removed.  This is exactly what is stated.  It fits my 2014 Hyundai Santa Fe Turbo and the quality is excellent.  Can't wait to use it.  It will be so nice to have things not moving when the car is being driven.
B0068ERFRS|5|Perfect for 2 up riding, Still not 100% comfortable for passengers to use, but an ergonomic improvement for my ZX10-r
B001RERISA|5|great
B008X02H9G|1|junk 7 month 6000 mile failed
B001V7T3WM|5|This decal is most life like , it is a  perfect representation of the picture. It also arrived ahead of time and in good condition.
B007V077Q2|5|Great quality.
B004ZHN5DS|2|I have a Harley branded 4x jacket that fits snug, real snug with the liner in it. Looking for a racing style jacket (and a bit of extra room), I bought this in 5x as I had read other reviews that First Manufacturing ran a size small. This is a terrific understatement.<br /><br />Pulling it out of the box, it looked great. Good weight and color. It also looked like it was for a kid. I checked the tag, it said 5x. I tried to put it on but it quickly became apparent that it was going to be a Chris Farley, \\"Fat guy in a little coat\\" routine if I continued. That is how very small it was.<br /><br />Using the Harley sizing method this is a large 2x ~ smallish 3x TOPS! The arms are also \\"skinny\\".<br /><br />The seller was Frontier Cycle via Amazon. They were great. The return was easy with no hassle and no restocking fee. My account was credited the next business day after the tracking said my return was delivered.<br /><br />It was a nice jacket, but very undersized. I would definitely buy from the seller again.<br /><br />Since I had to pay shipping both ways, it cost me $30 to try on a jacket. But, at least you can learn from my experience.
B00DPYB980|5|This car decal is huge and definitely gets a lot of attention. Great buy and definitely think everyone should buy it!
B00BUCD7XE|5|2001 fl70 perfect fit
B00NPIN8FI|1|One worked for one day and stop working!  Sent them back and do not waste your money!
B00FQ8U0YM|5|Easy to install and look great!
B003MRJ7AC|3|It's very very small and doesn't feel very solid. Doubt it will last long. Will post an update in like 2 months
B005VA1FAI|1|Didn't fit on my hayabusa as it stated it would. Highly upset w/ this product. Please read between the lines on these products, it's not very cleaf.
B00MSSTWPQ|5|Great side mirror visors, fit my son's 2015 kia rio perfectly! I recommend pressing the bottom of the placed visor on your mirror after you place them, and leave them for 24 hours, it worked for me.
B003HPLZUE|5|These work great when you want to use factory valve covers that wont fit because of beefed up valve train. I wanted to retain factory 454ss valve covers when i got new edelbrock heads. When installing roller rockers you will ned these spacers to retain stock valve covers!
B001AIZ5HY|1|Bought this earlier from Autozone to clean 1991 Escort GT headlights so decided to use this to clean my  2005 Focus headlights but did not perform as well with Focus as Escort I believe 3M must have changed product although it looked the same as before.
B002W53J6S|4|Good product
B001EP0GMW|4|My son and I got this receiver on in about 35 minutes.  The instructions were good, not great.  The instructions do tell you what size sockets you will need, which would have been handy if I read it first instead of just going at it.  The only part of the instructions I would have liked a little more info was which brackets had to be removed for the muffler (3 on my 2012 Town and Country).<br /><br />The receiver came in well packaged in heavy cardboard and was left by my garage so that was nice.  The receiver did have some limited bubble wrap around the tube, 2 pieces of paper wrapped around the sides which was nice when I jacked the receiver in place, instead of holding it, while I tightened the bolts.<br /><br />Overall, very pleased with it.
B001DRJ97E|5|it arrived in a cute but squishy package ready to install the box was in tacked in good condition also but the only \\"issue\\" i ran into was gettin the damn lid off lol it took a gently grip with the pliers to get it off but overall great part and does the job like she said it would minus the lotion..... >_>
B00KPQWR64|1|Did not work for my rv
B001NKCD2Y|4|Style, warmth and protection at a hell of a price. Everything I wanted.<br /><br />One complaint is that the two internal linings are complex to re-insert and even without them it can get bloody hot if you don't remember to fully open all vents. The other complaint is that the wrist snaps (both) ripped right out when trying to unsnap them but that was a cheap correction at my local leather shop.<br /><br />Regardless those are minor complaints. The jacket is well worth the price even for the extra fifteen bucks for new snaps.
B007WGEF7O|5|Works well for my money.  Does the job WITHOUT any problem when I had to change the water pump on my BMW Z3 Roadster.  Chrome-plated and durable.  I recommend it to anyone who needs to hold the fan pulley.
B001A1RLC8|1|Gloves ripped as soon as I put them on -- threw them right into the trash -- would not recommend
B001AI6ZFA|5|I put this seat on my 2008 V-Star 1300 and it made my bike go from cool to awesome. My bike has never looked so sexy. Although it's not as comfy as my stock seat, it still feels great. The wife and I sat on it for Sturgis bike week, about 1500 miles, and it did just fine. This seat will make any bike look great.
B000C2E6GA|5|That'll do pig, that'll do.
B004I9UFNQ|5|This was easy to install and works on a 2015 Ram 1500 without factory installed brake controller.
B003A14A3Y|5|This is a nice hat with a buckle for the adjustment in the back.  No Velcro here.  Good quality and well designed.
B000BRJOV8|5|I ordered this RV Propane Tank Cover but expected it to probably be low quality.  WOW was I surprised!  This cover is excellent quality and looks and fits great on our RV propane tank.  Thanks for such a quality product!
B008R5FJ4C|5|Excellent quality jacket. Perfect for long trips. Lots of adjustments. Looks great (I'm a Small). For the price, no way to get any better. Go for it!
B007WHX1KU|5|Very nice ashtray for pipe smokers.<br />Larger pipes sort of tilt over on the tray, but it's ok.<br />The cork knocker is very nice.<br />Big, hefty piece, well worth the money.<br />Looks great in the man cave.
B002PWJRWS|4|Purchased for my wife, to help her get into bed due to a bad hip. It has worked great due to the height of our bed.
B002DZJQ0A|5|Perfect for easy pass!
B0015FYQ90|5|Delivered as advertised and promptly
B003VZLJFG|5|I applied this product to my headlights and I was amazed in the difference--so was my Dad (he usurp the remaining kit).  I had a comparison photo to upload, but I didn't know how to blur out my license plate number. Definitely recommend this product.
B000NPM24O|4|Was torn between giving this product a 3 or 4 star rating.  I does do what is suppose to do but the instructions should be more informative on how to install product.  I had to call the tech guys to find out why after installing why the passenger side window didn't have enough power to roll all the way up and down.  Went through several steps only to find out that the line I had tapped for power needs to have a 30 amp fuse.  This is information I felt should have been in instructions.  Now the windows roll up and down fine.  Its not as fast as factory power windows but its not very slow about the speed you would do by hand if your not cranking fast.  Also felt there were a couple of plastic pieces that should be a little stronger.  All in all good product for someone that is not a car guy but has basic knowledge of how to install items.
B001QWZTZ2|5|as advertised quick delivery
B00C5KB4XA|4|For generic jetski cover, fits perfectly.  Very pleased with fit and ability to keep water and debris out during storage.
B002DMZA2G|5|This miniature is amazing.I have been a technician for about 20 years and I had used a lot of vacuum pumps.I received it yesterday,fill the oil and test it.In less than five minutes it reached 29 mmhg.I don't know how it works for other people but for me is an steal for the price.It worked great for an hour without hesitation.This thing never went overheated or spill oil, just it worked perfectly.I recommend it.
B0000AXY4D|5|This was a right hand side replacement light for my trailer. I spliced the wires and they lit up fine. If you have already cut the existing wire there is instructions on the back of the package to wire it correctly. I have fully submerged the light in water 4 times without and problems. Very good product, I would do business again.
B0049MX77S|3|After we finally got it installed, it wasnt bad. But the arm did not want to line up with the wing nuts on a 2003 Highlander. We ended up having to use an impact wrench to get it on, and even then we broke a bolt in half.
B000CB94SQ|5|Just what I needed
B003A9N2RQ|5|I typically wear an XL helmet, but I ordered a large after checking HJC's sizing chart and it fits perfectly. Make sure you check the HJC chart before ordering. I have a funny shaped head, but this couldn't have fit better. It has good padding and is comfortable even for long rides. The optical quality of the visor is very good and the helmet breathes well. I was impressed with how nice the helmet looked after unboxing. It looks like a much more expensive helmet. This is one of the best value helmets being both snell and DOT certified. I just took it on an hour long ride today and i couldn't be more satisfied. The visor didn't fog and the helmet was still comfortable.<br /><br />I noticed other reviewers saying mainly two negative things about this helmet - being heavy and too loud.<br />this helmet is definitely louder than my open face helmet. It may not be as light as a carbon fiber helmet, but it is not heavy at all in my opinion. In fact, it is lighter than my open face helmet.<br /><br />Update as of 5/10/13<br />I've been wearing this helmet for almost a month now. I've used it in light to moderate rain and no water got in. I only have one complaint and that is that it is slightly uncomfortable if you're wearing sunglasses inside the helmet for extended periods.
B004YID69G|5|Exactly the one for me. Know if I hit a wild hog it will give my truck a bit of protection.
B0086E2EVU|5|Was a grate deal
B00558ISB0|1|I bought this ítem few weeks ago and when I received it I realized that I was not the same Font style I ordered. Actually it was uggly. I strongly reccomend you NOT to buy it unless you are ok with any kind of Font style.
B000WPW08S|5|Very nice bag! Just wished there was something other than the strings to use to put it on sissy bar, but I still love it regardless! Delivery was very good!
B00FBQMUHY|5|Just as described.....thank you !!
B000BSYAX4|4|i dont know if its my truck or the hitch but the holes were off a hair and there was a space where 2 bolts go into the bottom portion of the bumper. when i tightened it all down everything was good to go. but because that space that was there initially either the hitch or the bottom portion of the bumper gave a bit and bent. and im talking just a hair. not really noticeable and i don't think it will effect anything i have to tow. it looks great. looking forward to giving it a workout. make sure you re-torque everything once you tow something with it.
B002MEJB1Q|2|Straps broke after a few months.
B002L7A64U|1|I have had these on my truck for 2 weeks, haven't even washed it yet and the black powder coat is coming off. These are JUNK, buy elsewhere.
B00DP2UYE2|5|WE BOUT THIS TIRE FOR OUR GRANDDAUGHTER SCOOTER, SHE LOVES HER SCOOTER, THE TIRE HAS HER OUT ON HER SCOOTER AGAIN, IF SHE NEEDS ANOTHER ONE WE WILL BUY FROM AMAZON AGAIN,
B0016LG0CY|1|Did not work on arrival.
B000E4722Q|5|This is slightly more expensive than the other OEM replacement BUT if you do the right research, aka go to the company's website, and verify the model number you need for your car, it fits very well. This is still a lot cheaper than purchasing a painted one from your dealer. I bought this for my father's 2001 Accord EX. To do this, use your VIN to make sure.
B00030DLEE|5|excellent
B004PX8BC2|4|After reading the reviews and looking a similar products I chose the Torin. This replaces a broken one in my Camry.  I'm glad it is there. Hope I never have to use it.
B001GS53XE|5|I've always loved the \\"Coexist\\" bumper stickers, but I didn't want to put a sticker on my car.  This magnet is perfect and you can't even tell that it's a magnet and not a sticker.  I love that it came in a 2-pack so I have a backup in case some idiot steals my magnet. (It happens)...  I am thinking to order some more for Christmas presents.  Thanks!
B004K9I25C|5|Direct fit 2004 suzuki eiger 400. This valve replaced the vacuum operated fuel valve that suzuki used.
B003LUPH2M|5|Great Purchase. Needed a new set of lights as the last set hadn't been changed probably since the wife purchased the car. Went into various stores to find the correct bulb type and order. The price of others and the color where much more expensive. These arrived very timely and meet my needs perfectly. Great light for driving at night.
B000GU5IH4|4|I got this cover for my new (to me) Kawasaki Ninja 500. It fits great and kept my bike dry during the whole season. Quality is great and fit is snuggle (I got the medium) Nothing to complain about. It does what it needs to do. I thing it was a good buy for the price.
B00348KSMK|5|I love this sticker. It applied nicely and came in perfect condition. I put it on my car window, which is perfect because the sticker backing is clear.
B00DGU98VS|5|Very good !
B004RH9UIA|5|Very good product with a reasonable price!!
B00AVQC01U|1|The top when screwed on will not seal  leaks on my feet no gd for 38 dollars
B00M9NJCU0|5|Nice seat
B001O07VI4|4|Good price, did the job.  Could have arrived sooner, though.
B001AYQZ86|1|This shade is only 24.5\\" tall. The description on Amazon says it fit windshield 32\\" or less. Actually it fit windsahields 26\\" or lees. Now I need to buy other size. You can not return because it is in molded package.
B009408LLC|1|not worth the money.  get a cardbord box
B009YCTIWQ|5|Good product does what it says it should.
B000C9RR1Y|5|Nice part has '555' stamped on the bearing cap.
B0033HR35M|5|Arrived as promised and looked great on the car!
B0031I1ZUW|4|Just got it today and it fits easily over my Honda Foreman 500 with room to spare. The elastic band seems pretty thick. The real test will be how long it lasts so I will probably update this in a couple of months.
B005ETNQW6|5|It fits and it works, can't ask for more than that. Word of caution, it the servo pulls in all the way the first time you start the car with this installed, you likely have the vacuum lines swapped.
B00DQQLX38|5|It is Excellent, I received on time and the quality is great work as It’s required and I will give 5 stars, it’s just Wonderful, better impossible, I was checking many different and similar of this one and I couldn’t find someone like this.
B003XWEO8Q|5|Excellent product, arrived on time as agreed. no defects or damage. estandares.el meet cost is excellent. I follow the internet loading problem
B0006GF5SK|4|OK  needed that too
B007HSLQBK|5|Looks as advertised, would recommend it
B004133B7G|5|The Dorman 521-109 (driver side fitting) shipped very fast. It fits perfectly on my vehicle (07 dodge caliber), and has been working great for several weeks now.
B0078UBIY2|5|These gears have met my expectations after the break in period there is no noise and they seem to be working properly.
B0019C4Z9U|4|Looks pretty good. Super light plastic. Is super shiny, so of the black already on your truck is dull it looks out of place a little.
B000NW6XEC|5|I had an issue with my 2007 Avalanche having a Service Stabilitrak and reduced power messages on the dash. I found out the message was referring to the throttle body sensor. In my case I had to order the throttle body kit and not just the sensor. I went to all the auto part shops in my area and they all were not stock and said it would be days before i would receive it on top of that they wanted $200+shipping. I went to online and ordered from Amazon. The cost was much less even with the Next Day Saturday delivery. The part took 20 minutes to installed and the problem is fixed! Saved me time and best off all money!
B0029V9DRY|1|I purchased this bag because it was large enough to hold a few sets of golf clubs. I live in MN. After one trip to Palm Springs CA to do some golfing the bag was in tatters with many holes. The fabric does not hold up under long trips at highway speeds.<br />I would not purchase this bag again.
B002E2UK8O|4|I wanted something yellow for the fog lights in my Subaru and gave these a try. So far they've held up well and are just what I was looking for. Having used other higher $ bullbs in the past these work every bit as good with 1/3 the money spent.
B00IWHIISY|4|Great vest  my only issue is that it runs small.
B0009IQZH0|5|Another fine product from Meguiars.
B00L931KJM|4|They work great so far no complaints. I use them for work and they do what they are supposed to. Mahew is a good name brand so I would recommend they if you need them
B001U3LZU0|5|What can you say it's Mothers at a great price
B00KC6I3ME|5|This sticker is just as described
B0092626AK|5|I've owned motorcycles for over 50 years.  They can be a very fun and fuel efficient way to run an errand.  However, you must have a place to put the &#34;things&#34; that you transport.  This rack was delivered with customary Amazon speed.  The instructions were clear and the only real complication was the drilling of two 5/8&#34; holes in the plastic rear fender.  Fortunately, the fender is stamped on the underside which marks the exact spot to drill.  I used a wood bit, as it is harder to find a metal 5/8&#34; bit/  Rack works great.  I have mounted a Buddeez Milk Crate Storage Bin  on the rack with straps that let me remove it quickly when my travels take me off road.
B00JLQMBXI|5|A+ service
B006JCOXP6|5|Bought this to replace the cheap plastic dealer frame that came on the front of my 2009 Xterra. It is easy to install, and it looks great. Decorative license plate screw covers conceal fasteners for the smooth Elite Styling Look! Comes with four screws and two caps.

B004EI6A8K|5|Works great, keeps the battery topped up all the time. Highly recommended if you need a battery minder!
B00GHR3L10|5|Good product
B000C36BJO|5|This thing runs smooth and is the quietest belt on the market period.  My belt usually starts squeaking after a few months after replacement, but this thing runs silent throughout its entire life.  Its a shame I can't buy them locally anymore at auto parts stores, but where retail fails, Amazon always has me covered!
B003L7DR8Q|5|So far so good.  Hoping this thing lasts at least a few years. Fit was very good and came with hardware
B007KLMW80|5|Got the item very fast and it was just as described. I installed it and it seems to be working perfectly. It solved my problem. Hi give them a high recommend based on my experience.

B006NZTZLQ|5|met my expectation... was able to bluetooth to my laptop and fix my bmw to pass smog....easy to understand the display...
B000JWI8C6|4|A title, seriously? Is this going in a magazine?    I installed a 13514 on a 2010 Xterra today. It is obviously well made, although I skinned a good amount of paint off the end flanges getting it on.    The instruction sheet doesn't give itself enough credit. When you look at where the hitch it supposed to go, it doesn't look like you ought to need to take the exhaust hanger off. They should have added something like \\"we aren't kidding\\" to the illustration. It has to go straight in, over the exhaust. On the '10, with the hanger disconnected, I still had to hammer a block of wood in to wedge the exhaust down far enough to get the hitch over it. If you've got a helper you can skip that step.    The bolts that hold the bumper on were pretty tight, I used an electric impact wrench with deep sockets to get them loose.    The factory bolts have the last 1/4\\" or so of threads rolled down in such a way that you might think you stripped them off, so don't panic when you get the first one out.    By the way, if you're trying to figure out much drop you need on your ball mount, it might help to know that on the Standard 4x4 xterra S model with stock tires, the top of the receiver will sit almost exactly 19\\" from the ground.    so anyway, if you're worried about rust, you might tape off some of the exposed spots on the hitch before you go to work. Other than that, its very nice. I like the step, the welds are impossibly good.
B00H7JWKBY|5|Nice! :)
B00BJOQ9GA|5|Nice
B0074BRQTQ|3|Cons-<br />1. The headlights aren't very bright compared to the factory lights on my 2013 F150 Platinum.<br />2. Had a problem with one of the wire connections.  Not one that I made but one from their headlight.  It was shorting out and made the led part of the light intermittent.  Had to cut out their connection and make my own.<br />3. Had a problem with &#34;hyper&#34; flash with the turn signals.  LEDs draw much less current so you need resistors to correct the timing of the turn signal flash.<br /><br />Pros-<br />1.  They look great.<br />2.  Install easily<br />3.  They knew how to correct my hyper flash problem and sent out the parts free of charge and quickly.<br />4.  Great customer service<br /><br />Not sure I would recommend since I sacrificed brightness for looks.
B000O0J0L6|5|Fit perfectly and delivery faster than expected.
B000E2682S|5|I've had this brand on other trucks. It installs easily and works great.
B007SNR4FG|5|Installed this bad boy into a Mazda3 while converting the system to be return. It fits perfectly into the basket, the stock filter fits and only requires a slight modification to the plastic protecting the 12V connectors to fit the surge tank…<br /><br />Makes a slight hum but that is only audible when the engine is off
B00IV7PT2S|5|Sounds great easy install fits almost anywhere under hood
B0009XQUKC|1|One of the fittings was machined wrong. The hole was so off center it compromised the sealing surface.
B00B9EY5CK|5|Awesome part! Fit right on, you guys rock!
B00SGGWGRU|5|exactley what i was expecting! matches my car perfectly.
B000N3H8FO|5|Absolutely solved the problem.  Used an aftermarket gasket previously and it blew almost immediately.
B002MBUBTA|2|Photo shows two bus bars, only one came.
B00DAL9908|5|Kids love this.
B006TO45AW|5|Better then factory part. Easy to install.
B00XLV0D84|4|Great work nicely
B00O83OQJQ|1|Looks good fits very poorly and water very bad has light has ruined my headliner and carpet
B000RXKR6M|5|This mitt gets used in the washing of a fleet of vehicles. So far it has stood up to heavy use and holds water and car wash soap very well.
B000XY01WA|5|pain in the ass to get on but once on, it looks great
B002X6DQV4|5|I haven't actually had the opportunity to use this accessory yet, but know it will be dependable when I do as other C-Tek chargers and accessories are all great items.
B000EJS9IM|2|This device will be likely be less than what you need.  My hope was to use it for camping.  The fact is that it discharges quickly while not in use. So mostly it is an expensive rechargeable flashlight.      I would not count on it to start a car.
B0041TQU14|5|Easy to install n works great.
B00BSFZQCI|5|As advertised.
B005O0175I|4|It arrived quickly and was an easy install. I thought that the mirror wouldnt stay in place with just the adhesive stickers but it didn't budgE.
B0082365AQ|4|Solid construction and easy to use.  Tires do have strong odor but should disappear over time and use.
B00GRSOJSS|5|Received the right item that I ordered at a good price and delivery was quick with no damage, will shop again. THANKS
B00AAVISH6|4|This is a preliminary review.  I'll try to remember to come back and provide an updated rating later.  The only issue I have with this battery is that the very top is recessed a bit, so the battery clamp/tie down on my 2009 Toyota Matrix didn't fit as snuggly as it did for the OEM battery that came with the vehicle when I purchased it new.<br /><br />The first battery shipped to me was defective.  The negative post had been pushed into the battery.  There was no visible damage to the shipping box, so I'm assuming that the damage occurred at the place of manufacture.  Amazon was very good about sending me a replacement.
B00RPQH8OS|1|Horrible. You would think for the higher price one would get a better product. The switch sticks and has to be removed from the housing in order to correct it.
B00042JSNY|4|The construction is good . Works well.  Design needs to be updated .Its not made in China so its worth trusting .
B005446ECA|5|best stuff for leather
B004UR39MU|5|i bought a much heavier camper and this was a great solution to the extra weight! and it is a good buy!
B0031HHA5M|5|Excellent
B00200CF2E|5|I purchased this grease for my sailboat winches. It applies well, and I liked that the white color allowed me to see where the grease was applied. After applying to the winch parts, the winches ran smoother.
B004LZUPC8|5|I used this to mount my ford sport trac bed extender. Perfect fit after few metal screws and washers , very quick installation. I am glad I found this product, I saved a couple hundred dollars mounting the aftermarket bed extender . I highly recommend it.
B001NOHER4|5|Fits Polaris 500  Sportsmen great.
B0081KM6Q2|3|good product really bright but it wont stay on the window the suction cups don't work as well
B002M3FZNA|5|dead accurate when compared to a $200 gauge I have access to.
B001O0TZQK|3|These pads arrived quickly and the order was correct. However, when I went to put them on my 2001 Ford Explorer Sport Trac they wouldn't fit into the slides. I had to carefully grind the tabs down until they fit snugly, but without binding. Besides that issue, I love these pads! They're quiet and they feel great. I give them 3 stars only because of the fit issue.
B000NCOKZQ|5|Nice to be able to buy additional connectors without having to buy a whole new unit.  I use these on all of my battery started &#34;toys&#34;.
B00KN0UOEE|5|This was recommended by the manufacturer of my tonneau cover. This is cheaper than the small bottles. I like it so far.
B0040CZ79S|5|These fasteners worked perfectly to replace all my missing ones on my 2004 Infinity G35. And at a much better price than the dealership.
B0002VAZA2|3|My husband said he just had to have these and the buffer to go with it to wax our cars regularly. So we bought the set... and he waxes my car once and then went back to hand waxing his truck... but I guess the pads were fine.. he just never thinks about what he really will use!
B002N5L9R8|4|I had to return the first one due to a defect, but it was replaced as soon as they were notified. The second one was okay.
B000ALJ4KQ|4|I had a few scratches on my vehicle- it drove me nuts. I bought this in shale green to touch up those eyes sores. I painted it on like nail polish. In 10 mins the first layer was dry. I added a second to cover the remaining white nicks. 30 mins- done. I mean you can tell that it was covered up, amateur job up close, but 5 ft away looks like amazing. it dried a slightly darker green but you have to search for the spots that I did cover. So I was pleased, However, I didn't put a clear coat on top because my vehicle didn't need it as well as my fear of a horrible discoloration. Overall, I am super happy with it.
B00JQI4H2Y|5|These are great.  I was able to get kayaks above the garage door to maximize the space in a small garage. They take a little fiddling to get the knots right, in the correct location and to get the straps adjusted.  The only complaint is the stupid metal buckle on the strap is totally unnecessary and can scratch a boat; I wrapped these with white electrical tape. I slide the boat through the straps without using the buckle. I would have preferred the option to get a buckle-free strap.
B002SJBXPC|5|I used these on my 05 Tacoma with 9&#34; of lift. Could not find a 12&#34; travel eyelet to stud shock. These worked great allowing me to use an eyelet to eyelet shock.
B00M3Q3EAC|3|The stock bulb is dull for night driving and burned the inner reflective lining. Looks great with an expensive aftermarket bulb.
B00HWEOAOY|5|these arrowheads are wonderfully put together,and very beautiful stones. i am sure a lot more work was put into them than what i was charged,and i will be buying more soon. communication with seller was excellent,and they got to me very fast!
B001HNWSKY|5|The draws in the steering wheel was awsome, really good shape, the colors are clear, maybe the union could have damage, but is not a big damage.
B005HR1V3G|5|the taillight looks great like the smoke color. easy to install. you will need to use your old screws to install it . look great at night thanks jw
B0034C3XG4|5|Wanted a mount for my three 100W lights. This was perfect for my 97 TJ.  mounted it up perfectly and the textered paint was an added touch. very secure and would definitely recommend to anyone wanting a two or three light mount for their jeep.
B000UUO38A|4|Great product saves time and easier on the hands.  The only thing I do not like about it is that when you tighten it to the rails of your trailer it cuts into the aluminum.  Needs some kind of plate to prevent from this happening.  I use a piece of rubber so I don't cut into the rub rail.
B00KNNPRVQ|5|It took a while to install, but after it was finished, it look great though not exactly OEM. However it did compliment the interior in terms of the fabric color.
B000EDQQHO|4|Cleaned the roof well.  I also used it on the awnings and it worked fine on them too.
B000CNBPY0|5|We bought pink shock boots for our teal and white early bronco and they looked great! Good color and quality.
B0027HYVN6|5|Fit in perfectly, very heavy duty (as thick as my skid row skids on my old jeep.) I used a floor jack to hold it place, then put the two bolts through the crash bar it attaches to, tightened the nuts down and... Boom, all done. Less than 10 minutes to install on my 07 JK x.
B00KTHU1QM|5|Great Item
B00E1ETJFS|5|Just what I wanted.  Fits and looks great!
B0041CDPQO|5|Great product! Easy to install and works great on my bike-now i can charge my cell phone or use a GPS on my bike. purchased this along with the battery tender junior. Received it in a timely manner, and product was as advertised. I would buy from this vendor again!
B00FJW6IKA|5|Great product prefect fitment
B00OBWKHRO|5|Shipped Fast, easy to assemble. Once I set the width to match the grooves on the spools I am able to get the bike on and off the stand by myself with no assistance.
B005CW9MUA|5|Great upgrade for stock TC88 inner cam bearings without the HD brand tax.
B00A93TU6I|5|A
B001MUDS2E|5|This shifter is a direct replacement for my 2000 zx6r,Installed with no issues and product has a nice polished finish.
B00CC2ZU4K|5|Awesome product awesome customer service! Now my 2014 silverado ltz texas edition outshines everyone elses truck! 5k white hids ftw! Losers keep buyin &#34;blue&#34; lights pfttt
B004O5IDHE|5|This bike rack far exceeded our expectations!  Excellent values. This was easy to assemble and set up. We were using a frame mount rack and our dual suspension mtn bikes were getting scratched. We haul 4 bikes often 5 consistently (one rides in bed of truck). This rack hauled 1- 16&#34; bike, 2 - 26&#34; ds mtn bikes & a 29er ds mtn bike set in a matter of a few minutes.
B00I9IP4TM|5|Great sturdy product. My neice will love em!
B00FOX5T6I|5|Solvedy problem, thanks
B00B8O3NYW|1|This is part Nº; 19320-PNA-003 for Honda CRV 2006, LX?
B009FRTV9U|4|Impressive!  Well made and lives up to the claims of being tough.
B00K16FPO4|1|Pretty disappointed with this, not what I expected from Armorall.<br />Fails to blacken or restore the plastics on our car for longer than a week or two at the absolute max.<br /><br />Save your money, there are better and cheaper products on the market than this.<br /><br />Followed the instructions and have tried to use a few times, same poor results.
B00DG8635O|1|It wasnt like iT was specified in the picture .It isnt what it was .I  had to do a special order from the parts store oreillys and they got the right one ..yes paid more but my girlfriends car is running now
B0015DU8O4|5|Great all around set will buy again if needed
B0063OR4GU|5|works great great price
B004GW5FEY|3|Got this to put my bell on my bike. But after looking at my bike, Found a better spot that did not require this device to hang the bell.
B002M3P828|4|I had searched far and wide for a car top carrier, lots of research and reading reviews. We needed a big one (for golf clubs) for our trip from MD to FL. First of all it packed a lot easier than I thought it would. We got a tremendous amount of stuff in it. I used the three straps provided, which worked fine but did slack up a little. I'm glad I purchased a couple extra duty straps that made all straps no concern. I taped the straps to keep down road noise. We did, however, run into a lot of rain. Perfect weather up to and after the trip, but lots of rain on the road. We did have a \\"little\\" leakage. Not much. We didn't put anything up there that couldn't stand a little water anyway. All and all, the carrier did the job, was well worth the money. We plan to use it again on our return to MD in May. I used someone's suggest to use non-skid rug pad on the bottom. We then used a sleeping bag mat. Everything worked fine there, no car damage. We lined the bottom of the carrier with misc. rugs we were taking, then 2 sets of golf clubs, utility ladder, 4 beach chairs, all of our misc. bedding, pillows, towels, comforters, vacuum cleaner and 4 couch pillows and lots of other stuff too numberous to mention. We did put some of the pillows and comforters in trash bags, glad we did. When we got here, we noticed some of the things were damp, nothing major. Very satisfied, I don't see how rain at 80 MPH could NOT get under the flap and through the zipper, so we're very satisfied. Would highly recommend, especially if you are hauling golf clubs.
B0089XOHYU|5|I bought this #3 leather milk for my new gucci bag. It came with a very useful sponge so that I don't have to buy an extra one.<br />The leather milk works very well on the bag and now I use it on almost every leather item of mine.<br />It's lightly scented, which is not bad for sensitive noses.<br />Don't use too much on leather goods. (To my experience, a portion of a quarter coins is good enough for an area of 1 ft²).<br />You have to be prepared to wait a couple of hours to let the leather absorb the milk.
B0046BLGZW|4|Great!  They look great and fit well a bit thinner that what I was expecting but definitely a good buy!
B003STZ6EK|5|Looks great at my front door.
B00RW4JAZ8|1|I was really disappointed, the product was cracked in 2-different places when I received them, they were really thin and fragile and did not fit right, I threw them in the trash. The biggest waste of $30.00. I rate this product as a zero.
B001AIZ5HY|5|I've been what I call \\"shining\\" my own headlights for years now, I've owned several cars that the headlights succumbed to oxidation of the plastic, an Accura, and now our 2006 VW Jetta. A friend of mine who knows anything and everything about cars, any car you'd ever want to know about taught me how to do it on my own with a chemical I wont mention here, and a sandpaper process that is no less than hard labor!<br /><br />I did purchase a \\"reptile with the shell wax\\" version that was very much manual labor at the auto parts store that rendered pitiful results..<br /><br />SO, being that I'm not up for an intensive fix using my old ways and the poor reptile version just didn't cut it for my headlights that look dingy and old on my not so old car I looked into this contraption and was very satisfied with the outcome, I actually was floored with the results, VERY HAPPY. Sorry I didn't take any before and after pics, I will if it happens again.<br /><br />Long version on what you're in for:<br /><br />1) Follow the Directions!<br /><br />2) TAPE THE AREA AROUND YOUR HEADLIGHT, DON'T THINK YOU CAN AVOID DAMAGE, OR THAT YOU'RE JUST THAT GRACEFUL! Tape your car for it's own protection.. over & double tape any corners as well the corners are very susceptible to damage from the spinning sandpaper your ability to maintain control of the spinning sandpaper.<br /><br />3) Follow the directions, follow the directions, follow the directions..<br /><br />IMPORTANT NOTE: I will tell you that you have to be EXTREMELY CAREFUL with the pads wearing, or melting onto your headlight if you don't follow the directions and caution with the speed of your drill, follow the directions precisely and you will end up with beautiful results.<br /><br />There are 4 or 5 steps to the process, (don't follow my directions from memory written here, this is a review, I'm not exactly sure the process without rewriting the directions for you here, SIMPLY READ THE DIRECTIONS THAT COME WITH THE PRODUCT)<br /><br />It works something like this, you begin with wiping your headlights with a household cleaner to remove any dirt or grime, then use a compound I believe, then begin with the sanding. The Orange Sandpaper pads, being the first pad you'll use, be sure you use broad and even strokes across your light, same with the White pads, keep it moving or they will overheat and scar your light (it defines this in the instructions, and is from experience very difficult to correct)<br /><br />White Pads tend to melt very easily, especially around curves, so be very careful to KEEP IT MOVING. It's expected and intentional to white out/haze your headlight with the sanding, make sure it appears evenly fogged over with a white haze. Yes, you might have the thought what have I just done to my car, no worries, Follow the directions, it will work itself out, my entire family was amazed when we were done!<br /><br />Then you'll move onto the black foamy looking pad and some water, a little smaller circles with that one will start to look like a headlight again and not a scary mess that might worry you. You'll continue the process as PER THE INSTRUCTIONS, using the compound rub (again I believe), various sand paper grits and the Sealant (if your kit comes with a sealant, if not purchase a sealant separately to ensure that you have a long lasting clarity).<br /><br />Diligently following the directions and about an hour +/- of meticulous work to ensure maximum results AND VIOLA SHINY HAPPY HEADLIGHTS!<br /><br />I will definitely purchase this product again should the need arise, and I fully recommend it to those who are willing and able to follow directions :)<br /><br />UPDATE: 11/23/11 This product worked very well, was a lot of work to get it done, and although the immediate result was shiny headlights, after only about 4 or 5 months the haze is creeping back in. It is now nearly as bad as it was before we used this product. It was done around summer, and the hottest on record inmy lifetime at that, and it could be the manufacturer of the headlight that makes it so susceptible to oxidation, but I do wish that after all that hard work we would have gotten at least a year out of it.<br /><br />Hope that helps you with your purchasing decision.<br />Thanks for reading!wish that after all that hard work we would have gotten at least a year out of it.    Hope that helps you with your purchasing decision.   Thanks for reading!
B0073WGP16|5|This is an exact replacement for the original part.  It arrived on time, installed easily and works very well.
B000GU0MMU|5|So far it has been used several times on a 3.5 Accord and the same engine in an Odyssey. No issues at all. I did do a comparison between pulling the plug and using the extractor. The extractor actually pulled a hair more than draining. Both done on level ground with same amount and weight of oil.<br /><br />Its just cheap plastic but as long as you are gentle with it, it should last a long time.
B004IY9HVW|5|Delivered on time and fit perfect
B00EAOIHQ6|4|Plus:<br />Smells there are none unless your behind a diesel or really bad exhaust.<br />Filters Allergens pretty well I do not sneeze as much now.<br />Just as easy to install as factory with only a little more effort as it is thicker than the original and you cannot squish as much to fit through the filter slot.<br />Made by a well know company.<br /><br />Minus:<br />Thick a little harder to install through the filter slot.<br />Thicker so when you have it on fresh air selection on your car the fan cannot draw as much air through, Recirulation works fine.<br />When it comes to replacement it will be hard to tell how dirty it is as the filter is drk gray.<br /><br />Over all its a really good product if you have allergies.
B007Y83954|5|Nice
B00B2AG2Q8|5|Very easy to install and we'll worth the money. They worked perfect when unhooked for the trails on Drummond Island. Aired down to 10 PSI and unhooked my sway bar links and the rocks, mud and trails were fairly easy to navigate.
B00BVL7M26|5|very good tool. much better than the usual kind you see
B001GMFISA|5|They do fit 2015 tacoma crew cabs...
B00G620ZVU|5|Great price n awesome product !!!
B005QWLENE|3|I was really glad to have found these. I had put a set on an old Jet Ski years ago and got all sorts of strange looks from people. This set looks like those, but aren't near the quality. I had read the reviews and decided to buy them anyway. The first thing I did was tear them apart and paint the insides black. Then I reassembled them with a product called Big Stretch. Then I put them on my Sea Doo with Big Stretch and the existing (but very poor) adhesive tape. Keep searching for a higher quality set with better tape.
B0063XQ4F8|3|ok..
B0050V10PS|1|When i recieved this product the 3m sticker are already peeling and it looks like an old item. I thought it was not working because when i pressed the test button on the package the LED did not light up. I tested it on my cars battery and it worked. So i began installing it on my car but it only worked for a couple of weeks and the other LED's are not lighting up now. Now the issue is i cant return this item since i discarded the package already and throw away the other components... it sucks!!!
B00BG3GWSO|5|Exactly what we needed to replace the taillight in our Mazda CX-9 at a fraction of the cost at local car part stores.
B00EHHS6C6|5|Great tools!
B003YNB2W0|1|Unit arrived with insufficient packaging that allowed the unit to bang around during shipping.  Installed anyways and lasted approx 20 minutes before becoming noisy.  (BTW - Master certified including AC since 1978)  Received replacement and it arrived with insufficient packaging even though I clearly communicated lack of packaging likely caused original failure.  Returned unit without installing and again communicated packaging issue.  No reply.  Received request for feedback so... provided same as above.  No reply.  Contacted Amazon chat and was told everything would be resolved however no case # or any other way to follow-up to confirm problem resolved.  Beware - critical mechanical items like this will likely arrive having experienced stresses that will impact (pun intended) the reliability of the item.
B000JZUR86|5|Great product at a great price. No issues after a year of use.
B000CSSNYU|5|Bought as a gift. Performed as it should.
B0013V6M7U|5|GREAT GIFT FOR A GOLFER
B001UGNJ60|5|Bought three sets and installed on my travel trailer. These increased the stability significantly. They were easy to install and the instructions were easy to follow. For people with travel trailers, I highly recommend this product.
B00U1PE8C0|4|A+
B000CFU4LI|5|Second set that I use for a plow truck to keep the front from dipping down when I raise the plow. Works well but I let out all the air in the summer and one sprung a leak, now I keep them with a little pressure in them and they work well. Cheaper than heavy duty springs.
B00MJU60NA|5|Perfect fit. Great price.
B005DUN00O|5|Cycle Care Formula M + Scotch-Brite pad + Terry Cloth towel completely removed oxidation on Harley front forks (which now look new).
B003NH7MQC|5|Good quality. Instructions online are informative. Perfect replacement part.Seems it will last.
B000JQQQKS|5|Great product - hold up well to continued use!  Assorted sizes cover a range of uses.  Recommend to anyone needing bungee cords.
B004SS8DCM|5|Great product. I would definitely purchase these laynards again.
B00327C222|5|Bought for my wife's Miata. She loves them.
B00CULEPDA|5|easy to install, works great, always know much juice is in the set of batteries.
B002UVH49C|5|love it
B0002KKIXC|3|I was trying to find something to take out an old Kool-Aid stain out of carpet in my new/used car. This particular one came recommended on the internet. It didn't work any better than anything else. No worse, no better. I had to use the hot iron trick instead which did pull up most of the stain.
B000CPI0R8|5|I used this on a  steel outside-facing door that was starting to rust.<br />The product is thin, almost watery, and a little goes a long way.<br />Clean-up is a cinch as this is a water-based product.<br /> Upon applying, the painted area turned a purple-black color.  I allowed 2 hours to dry and applied a second  coat.<br />To finish, I used a primer coat of Zinsser Bulls Eye water-based paint and top coat of Rust-Oleum, oil based, to finish the job.<br /><br />It's only been a couple of weeks since the job was done, but the door looks like new, and it was installed in 1982.<br />If rust starts showing through at any time, I'll update this review.  For now, I'm extremely pleased with both ease of use and final result.
B00AFVCMG4|5|Really I found a change in the a/c. So fresh and blow very nice.
B003VGQ4PU|5|My Son purchased a used Subaru Impreza that did not have fog lights. So I purchased these for him to install. He had some problems installing them not due to the product but his lack of knowledge. AutoLightsBulbs customer service went WAY beyond to help him and he got them installed due to their help. The product is excellent and the work great. Very Happy customer and would/will buy from them in a heart beat!!
B000BZEH3A|5|Good sensor. I have a 97 camaro and swapped in a 98 LS1 motor with longtube headers on it. I had to make extensions for the stock O2's, and was then getting the infamous \\"slow response\\" DTC. I purchased the Bosch 13111's and the code went away, and the wires for them are long enough that I didn't have to make extensions for the LT headers.
B004GEV59Q|4|Best solution and value, in my opinion, for my 1999 Honda Accord coupe.
B000ENOPPO|2|This stuff works good on bicycle tires after a puncture occurs.However,it clogs the air valve open and causes the tire to deflate or clogs the air valve closed not allowing air to inflate the tire.This problem usually occurs when adding air to tire.I've used this stuff for years and have had the same problems but one thing can help prevent this problem is to let the air valve stem set for awhile in an 8 or 4 o'clock position to drain the chemical away from the air valve but the tire air pressure blows the stuff into the air valve.
B000AS1XYO|4|Great product so far. My 97 accord blows smoke through the exhaust like crazy. After putting this in with thicker engine oil, the amount coming out is DRASTICALLY less and the engine does sound smoother. I will be using this often!
B0042F7ZLQ|4|Very good gauge, at first.  After a month or so it starts to become less accurate.  Maybe that's normal for this price...
B000C81L8U|5|Arrived quickly and was packaged well. I compared it to the factory part removed from my 2000 Acura Integra GS (LS) and could not tell the difference. Once installed it worked perfectly and fixed my fault.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Looks feels and operates exactly the same as the OEM<br /><br />Cons:<br />None. I didn't have any issues with it.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this seller to a friend.
B000C7S0TO|3|good
B004084DBU|5|Need in fitting
B002J7KCEQ|4|these work great for cleaning jewelry
B000AMLWH8|1|thumbs up
B00897OSRM|5|Cool
B009DJQCHO|5|Good quality
B000GU5IBU|1|I received the cover last week and used it a total of THREE times before I noticed a 5-inch hole along the seam.I don't know if it came damaged or it happened on its own.I didn't pull at the cover or anything since the covers big for my bike there was no need to.It stayed true to being waterproof (withheld through heavy fog/light drizzle), but I can't believe it ripped already!!
B001DRJ3NY|5|everything OK
B007P721OY|5|New good condition
B009NMH70M|5|Bought to Replace exact same one bought years and years ago.  We together, pulled the bench seat out of his Chevy Truck (slid it out) and it was much easier to install this cover that way.  Had to have a strong neighbor help him put the seat back though!  He is very pleased with it.
B001NYYQAW|4|didn't fix my problem with the car, but probably needed to be replaced at some point
B000CQHVJA|2|Advertised as a Walker part and shipped from Amazon, but NOT a Walker part.  A brand called Exhaust Mate, made in India.  It may do the job, but the product is not as advertised.  I have found that quality rubber made in the USA, Europe, Japan and Canada far outlasts the stuff made in China or India.  I have made the mistake of buying Chinese and Indian made tires, only to watch them dry rot within 15 months - something I have never had happen with Michelins, Bridestones or Continentals.  May end up using my 22 year old OEM Nissan Japanese made rubber hangers instead, depending upon their condition.
B002WGHNAU|5|I really liked my first pair of these gloves, although they only lasted one full season before getting a few holes in the finger tips.<br />However, I accept that as a trade-off to the fact that these gloves have allowed me far more finger dexterity than any others.<br />They may be a bit thin compared to others, and not so good in the cold or rain, but I'll keep buying them each season if necessary.  Under normal riding conditions in Alberta they are perfect.<br />The accuracy they allow me with my signal lights, horn, ignition, headlights, etc, is great, especially for the price.
B001G7WXO2|5|This product fits perfectly with my 86' Mercedes-Benz 300E, thanks to the active partfinder it was shipped in a bigger box with the original inside but with airbags to protect it during travel and it was perfectly described the part number and everything you want to know about a MBenz replacemnt part. I hope it lasts as long as the original part... may be another 20years
B00GSMXWOK|1|These lights are bad one of them the cover that protects the inner lights fell off when I bearly took them out the box haha they suck there not even bright do NOT buy these save ur money
B00AOAVCDK|4|This is exactly what I wanted and it functioned as noted in the add. I would recommend this to anyone.
B002ZTGLCK|5|Great tubing used it on my scooter watch the flow of fuel at all times great for freezing temps also!
B00F1IP0P6|5|This decal is well made and was easy to apply to the back window of my Honda Element. the white looks really good against the black tinted glass.
B001GJ3DZS|5|I've used on wheels as well as home cleaning! Quality.
B00NI73F7M|5|Overall good header. Installation was fairly simple just a few knocks on the cross member and your in. Also noticed some gains and more airflow. I'd def recommend this header.
B000143LHY|5|This is the absolute BEST product to eliminate odors.
B00N4U4G5S|5|Use this in our fire department and it has been working well for us so far. We have used this with several accidents already and it's holding up just fine.
B001TIZZVQ|4|Nice fit and functionality.  A must have for keeping your Jeep dry and preventing that musty carpet odor.  I would buy these mats again.
B00C253VMU|3|This product didn't cost much and the quality shows it.  The visor wasn't entirely painted on the underside and I had to fix the lining that was coming apart.  However, I decided to keep it because it was good enough for an extra helmet.
B000C7XVYI|5|This turned out to be what I needed, but I got lucky; be aware that there are two different switch lengths, and measure your old one.
B00SN9RCMY|5|Very beautiful. I use on my rear view mirror
B001FZNDXA|5|Really a great looking product. I didn't actually need this item as I have a hitch bar on my x-trail (ordered the wrong item), but it was so beautiful that I could not get myself too return it. It was actually much better looking than any of my original Nissan emblems and maybe even better in quality aswell.  So I cut of the mounting bolts/screws on the backside (not easy due too very hard steel) and mounted it on my petrol lid/cover with two sided tape. It sits there like a piece jewellery on the car.
B00OLZ2L0W|5|LOVe it!! Its authentic too I love cadillac!
B000A2NIVQ|4|We did some modifications and used this haul our Dahons 1900 miles last year.  It worked to hold our fold up bikes by the tires rather then the top rail (our bikes dont have).  Bikes are much easier to secure vs. a hanging type rack.  Could be a bit heavier duty for full size bikes and the adjustments could have knobs so you dont need to take wrenches with you.  Could come with adaptor to use in 2&#34; or 1 1/4 hitch.  Those items would make it 5 star but price was perfect for us to modify.
B003X3PQN2|5|I switched from powder, drop ins and other liquids to this product and love it.<br />We are full time RV'ers since 2006, have used a lot of different products but have found an excellent product so we'll stick with it.
B003XFUEYG|3|Still has a yellowish look
B008NA5DLU|4|Like the finish but hard to get off if you wait too long. Wish it lasted longer on the far too. Seem to have to reapply alot(every 3 weeks).I wash car 1x week (new Porsche) with gentle car or no soap.
B001JT76C6|5|I used this wire to connect my LED light strips to a power pack. 25' was exactly the right length. No problems.
B001EP29N6|4|I bought a number of these to install in my enclosed 6 X 12 trailer for tying-back furniture and boxes during a recent move.  The price was excellent compared to a lot of other products available, and the rings are sturdy and suited to my needs.  Of course, I had to buy hardware to install them, but why pay extra for included hardware that is probably not going to work in your particular application?  These aren't the most heavy duty product, but I think they probably do a good job of meeting their advertised specs, and have worked very well for me so far.  I would not have considered using these in a location exposed to weather.
B000ARPVOI|1|I bought this from Wal*Mart for about the same price. I put 6oz. in my 14.5 gallon Mustang after filling up. Since then my gas mileage has went DOWN, and I notice my car idling rough. I might have got slightly better responsiveness in between shifting gears, but that's definitely not worth the rough idle and worse gas mileage.    EDIT: I calculate my gas mileage every tank (fill up and reset odometer, use up tank, miles on trip odometer/gallons on next fill up), so I know exactly what I'm supposed to get. Over the past, probably 50 fill-ups, my gas mileage was very consistently between 21.3 and 21.7. After using this fuel additive it immediately dipped down to 20.4mpg. I very rarely use AC, so that's not what happened. The treatment just didn't work.    Also while idling now, my car starts to run rough til I give it some gas.    I would not recommend this to a friend. (plus the price-per-gallon of fuel is quite expensive)
B000NO7NC6|4|Great clip.  Fits perfectly in the Apple logo window of my Otter Box case.  This clip replaces the Otter Box clip that breaks often.  This is simple and works better that Otter Box clip.  Thank you.
B00C1GNGQG|5|Only 1 flaw. No lighting o well. Flexible though so bend it cops can't get plate ;)
B000VKVQCU|4|This car magnet works like most of its kind.  It is large enough in diameter that it does not fall off.  The colors are bright and vibrant, and don't seem to be fading much in the summer sun.
B0000DYV3N|5|Use when driving all time time.
B000RG9SRI|5|Well made
B002Y33C5Q|5|Exact replacements for the painted stock ones on your Jeep.  Shinny is a good thing for me, I have a lot of shinny stuff on my YJ
B003CG9PIC|5|Seems very well made for the price. I have not had a chance to use it yet but am really pleased with the construction... even if it is made in China :(
B000CMH31A|4|Product was mostly what I expected. Everything worked but I a was disappointed with mounting. I ordered this as a replacement for the the same model number that was damaged on a 12 year old truck. I ordered this and waited for it instead of buying a new bar at the auto store because I wanted the best fit and easy installation. The mounting holes are off by a 1/4 inch from the original requiring new holes.
B004QXUW3W|3|I usually use it at night when I walk my dog. It's okay not the brightest but for what I use it for it gets the job done.
B000GZAN0Q|4|I ordered these to do a complete strut replacement on a 2003 Hyundai Elantra GLS.  The work wasn't bad, but don't forget move over the rubber insulator on the spring seat bottom from your old strut because it does not come on this new strut.  If you forget, like I did, the ride will be very noisy with the metal to metal contact.
B00196QKBC|4|I am not a mechanic but with the guidance of a video on YouTube, I got this installed in an hour.  It works well.
B001KR1BQE|5|Cheapest place to buy this new pn Motorcraft filter so far. The dealers want over $12 a piece. I would think over time they will get cheaper. Most other Motorcraft filters are $4 or less at several retail stores.
B00HAP3DVQ|5|I got the part quick. Car feels great with this mount
B00JFWKM0C|5|Works great!
B005UGJ12C|3|They were great until I lost them off the bike after only about 5 miles.  Don't hang them on your bike unless you reinforce the small ring.  The small ring is not strong enough to keep the ball attached to the large ring.  They definitely will not replace the &#34;gremlin bell&#34; because they are not made strong enough to hang on the bike.  So sad, I did like them.
B004J2FD1G|5|fits like oem part in a mazda 6 04. it came with everything I needed. So far no problems with the new mount.
B001C95792|5|EBC Ultimax seem to be great brake pads.  They are well very made and not made in China.  In installation was very straight forward on my 07 accord V6 4door.<br /><br />The Ultimax are Semi-matalics, a little hard to find that info.
B003Z4BBSI|3|these do fog in the rain
B002CMGWWE|3|The product was as described. Shipping time was a little slow. My biggest complaint with this product is the cost. The yellow container is the most expensive part of this product which might have cost Fafco six dollars to produce. To charge a customer in excess of fourty dollars for this item is price gouging , greed, and basically taking advantage of a prior customer for buying their product in the first place. When it comes time to replace my solar panels in a couple of years that will be the first question I have. What is the cost of a repair kit? The local Fafco dealer would not even sell me one. Have to gouge me for a $75 service call for 15 minutes of work which I can do myself.Last nickle they will ever get from me.
B000OKT8RM|4|These are a good inexpensive replacement for RV faucets. I would recommend them. they seem to be of a good quality.
B0006VORDY|5|I bought this to boil crab but have used it for tons of things.  My wife is especially happy that we can cook bacon on the patio so it doesn't smoke out the house.  It's stout and breaks down for transport.  I'm glad I chose this one over the other &#34;royal&#34; one.
B00FGFVO2M|5|very good product
B000HZT89C|1|Received this DIRTY! Disgusting...its as if I wanted to buy someone else's trash!
B001THSTWY|5|Very quick delivery great fit. OE is slightly misleading as they are not MOPAR but they came with careful packaging and ALL the lights! The lights alone are worth $50. Great buy will be buying fog lights next.
B0076KBPNI|5|At less than 8 bucks was skeptical. works just as advertised with my google android HTC phone and free Torque app
B005FKUULO|1|Will not work for all models make sure before you buy.
B00INTQ3YC|4|Exactly as in picture. Good Buy
B008UDHEQ2|5|AWESUME
B002NAQJ8M|5|look great....work great.  good value!
B001CF5EHG|3|Threaded holes didnt line up with the provided template.  On my 2005 TJ I had to drop the fuel tank.  Smittybuilt could have been a heck of a lot more honest about the installation.
B00497DIZ4|4|arrived quickly, great price, just what I needed for my street rod
B005J92VHW|5|This is as much about the bulb as it is about how to put this in an Acura RL 2006 or 2005 to newer (Second generation RL).  Go to Acurazine where I describe the procedure.  Heck I will do it here again, just a quick copy and paste.    I ordered from Xenon Corp after reading the banter back and forth about one sku with a plus sign while the one from Amazon doesn't or vice versa, yada yada.  My bulbs indicated Made in Germany which probably doesn't mean anything these days except that the quality control is better and you don't get rejects. These are 4300K bulbs and from what I can tell, they look stock and I like things the way Acura's nature intended.    My passenger side was pink while the driver's side was flashing, dimming, blinking, the usual symptoms. I did the passenger side first but know that the driver's side gives you more visibility so if you want to see the clips which are holding the bulbs, start with the driver's side first. I did not remove the bumper as some RL owners have done.     Passenger side, get rid of all the plastic trim. Watch the video which shows you how to remove everything tell you get to the cap with the 24,000 volt warning label on it. [...]  In case Amazon doesn't let me copy the link.  The site is carcarekiosk dot com slash video slash 20...ghts slash headlight     Once you get the cap off, you have to remove the connector. It's a short twist CCW and now you are at the bulb connector. Look at the new bulb to see what you are dealing with. It is held in place with a V clip which terminate into two circles at the top on both sides of the bulb. You have to pry the left away from the bulb and towards you on both sides (it snaps out). The bulb can now be removed. Wear gloves or don't touch the new bulb when inserting it into the assembly. Pry the V clip on both sides to hold the bulb in place. Replace the connector, put the cap back on and count your lucky stars you didn't kill yourself. Honestly, I don't know what the fuss was all aboutbut do be careful and don't go prying any more than you have to. I don't think the connectors are exposed or Acura put in a resistor of some kinds so when you disconnect the battery, it discharges the cap quickly.  Also, save the bulb, it can be used to discharge a capacitor quickly if you ever need to do so one day.     By the way, I did disconnect the battery, fwiw and for good measure. Make sure you have your radio and Nav codes handy else the car will think you are a guest.     As for driver's side, remove all plastic crap. In my case, I also removed the battery and the air filter tray completely (including two hoses). While I was at it, the filter looked gummy so I ran to Autozone and took care of it too. Rinse, repeat.    Did I mention the bulbs work great?  If these fail within 2 years, I will come back and change my rating.  Hope this helps someone.
B008RME47I|5|I bought this bumper 1 year ago, it is a great winch bumper. I have had to winch my self out and there isn't the slightest movement or hint of weakness. It comes unpainted so you must paint it. I simply sprayed it with black spray paint and if i ever get a scratch (which I do) I can touch it up in seconds. The winch mounts low for good air flow and it has two D-ring recovery points which I have used to good affect. The bumper has great mounts that go far down the frame to make it rock solid. The mount also doubles as a steering box reinforcement point which helps support a naturally weak point on the Cherokee unibody. After I bought this bumper I went back to Nate's website and got his Cherokee roof rack which is also good stuff.
B000AMBOI0|3|This battery tester does exactly what it says it will do.  It is made rather cheaply and after about a week's worth of use the cables were they connect to the ends started to work there way a little lose but the tester leads still make good connection.  For the price this is usable and hard to beat.
B001DRHMPK|5|I'm using this exact model right now. So far so good. Recommended for all makes/models (which uses this specific size filter) under the VW group.
B00108B1C2|5|Made in the USA.  I look for parts that were made in this country.  They say it adds to the price, bull  everything is already overpriced.
B0007N56OU|5|I ordered the wrong color but my husband used it for his model cars and it worked out great. thanks
B00LBNL3VK|5|Nice and bright, really helps with in cab lighting compared to old halogens.
B0073G2N40|5|This is my second set that I got from Kensun, both installed easily and performed as expected, my high beam looks like a candle compared with the lows now. Very pleased, will recommend to anyone. Will buy for my other vehicles.
B006OCTWKM|5|looks great on my 2001 civic and fit nice and snug. I would recommend this to anyone with a 10x1.5 mm thread on their car!  Just want to follow up on my review and say that after having this shift knob for over 2 years, the color has not faded at all like cheap knobs. It is very durable!
B007JFHPQQ|4|Exact fit
B003RY53U8|5|A little big but keeps my coffee nice and HOT!!!
B004BCA9B8|4|Saves me a lot of time tracking down problems between trailer vs vehicle.  I'm still looking for a test unit so I can sit in the driver's seat & see the results without walking back & forth.
B0041QC5BG|5|I use it on a Nolan N43 with basic kit 2 and an iPhone 4. Works flawlessly with iPhone for calls and music and for bike to bike communication up to at least 200 meters.
B00NQEN0DG|4|I can only give a four star review on the compressor due to one of them going bad 6 months into its life.  Blew 40 amp mini ANL fuse so I installed another one.  Popped as soon as I put it in.  The other 2 compressors are still running good on the fuses put in during the initial install.<br /><br />I'm going to give a review on the compressor for my application prior to losing one.  I tow a 20 foot enclosed trailer with a lot of archery equipment in it.  Due to the excessive load on the tongue of the trailer i decided to put air bags on it to help out.  I bought 3 compressors due to the fact I am not interested in spending a long time changing tires on the roadside in south Louisiana heat.  I put them in my truck tool box and mounted a 7 gallon aluminum tank as well.  They will run an impact used in removing the lugs, on the truck and trailer. They have been very good up to this point with airing up tires, mine and strangers, and scaring people occasionally with the train horns.  I have a pressure switch for 150/175 on the tank and a regulator for the air bags and the horns and another for the air line fitting.
B00AQVCEPC|5|Awesome fit..
B000CI3QQU|4|Great buy. Tough to install but any starter would be in this car.<br />2 year warranty and roadside assistance, what can you say.
B00WUOM7XM|1|They are great. I would have given 5 stars but the grooves they cut do not line up with the body of my truck (not too noticeable). I also wish they used the same type of clips in the front as they did in the back to hold the fenders on, but they are still a tight solid fit. The instructions were lacking because you couldn't see the pictures and the sequential order was not numbered, but once I figured it out it was an easy install. They look great!  Edit: One of them shattered after a small bump of a human body hitting it, and they will not take it back.  Edit 2: Another one shattered from a deer. The deer was perfectly fine and walked away without a limp, but the fender flare shattered.
B00077U7QI|5|A great and quiet inverter
B005FJXN1E|5|Shipping was on time and all parts fit perfect onto my 2003 GTP. They seem to perform well but I am only a daily driver no racing here!!!! For the cost these are better than your OEM replacement and cheaper.
B006YWNPPA|5|The switches I ordered came on time and cost much less than others in the local store.  I want to replace the rocker switches on my boat because when I hose the boat down they often turn on.
B0001EVUC2|5|I would recomment it everybody who likes drive with open roof on highway and would like to hear what your wife say. It was very simple to install it on my roof on RAV4 (2010) and it is really working. I just had small issue with cover tape that was cut into two pieces and I was not able remove it in one hit as was described in manual. Pay attantion on this in advance and you will be able install it in 15 min w/o problems.
B007KBOKJO|5|This was a perfect addition to my classic 1987 caddy, great quality and sturdy...5 stars ***** Good quality and I would recommend..
B000FOL08M|5|Very solid bar and latch mechanism. Well-made feet grip the sides of the pickup bed securely. Can't go wrong.
B000AL8VD2|5|Recommended for any spark plug job.  I have been using this stuff for years and it just works.
B00FC220JK|5|As many others have said, these guys really are GREAT!  The kit I received was well packaged, of high quality and worked just as advertised.  The 55w is definitely the way to go, nice and bright.  Also, another review I read stated that the higher wattage shifted the color temperature to the warmer end of the spectrum and I found that to be true as well.  The 35w 4300k bulbs were factory HID white and the 55w 4300k bulbs were closer to a good set of standard halogen bulbs.  I got a set of 55w 5000k bulbs and they are perfect, very close to factory HID white in my opinion.  Great product and great seller!
B000BYB2J8|5|After spending over an hour trying to install so called \\"top of the line\\" wind shield wiper blades that I bought at Kragen, I gave up and came to amazon instead. I bought these Bosch guys for my Acura TSX as someone else said they were easy to install. Well, I can attest that I got both on in under 3 minutes!!  I'm so relieved that I can put my frustrating experience behind me and move on with my life (and get my refund from Kragen).   I used them once and they seemed to work pretty good, though I have no idea how they'll hold up long term.  For now, I'm just thrilled they are on and look nice.
B000E43BCQ|5|Item seems to be well made. A clamp wouldn't hold it in place. I had to weld it on. Product arrived in a timely manner.
B00EIRAB78|4|great does not take up space in car.
B005BNYV2Y|5|I purchased this brand as a cheaper alternative to my local big box store.  Unlike other reviewers I did not have a problem with this adhering to the applicable surface.  It has added extra safety and style to steps that I applied it to.<br /><br />Working conditions:  I applied this to a total of 4 steps in my garage.  The steps were first cleaned and then primed and painted with rustoleum brand oil based paint.<br /><br />Note:  I was worried about this product not adhering due to the other reviews.  I am a large guy and I couldn't get this stuff to move in the slightest after it was applied.  I am very satisfied with this purchase.
B000CITK8S|5|Excellent Battery charger. extends your battery life while maintaining a complete cell charge year around, if you want to charge a battery more than 6 feet away from your wall plug purchase the Battery Tender Extension cable its a perfect fit. this was my second purchase of the Battery tender charger in 4 years. Do not unplug your charger cable and leave the (+ end ) of cable lying on the ground or on metal item like a (wrench) always cover the chargers cord with the included cap as you do with your battery's plug end. this will prevent internally shorting the charger, as i did.

B000J2ERSK|5|This little piece of sparkle makes mowing the lawn less of a chore.  It adds character to the machine and puts a smile on others face.  It was easy to assemble and works like a dream
B004BTMJ0A|5|I was told to get a different switch at the local auto zone, but, this was the correct switch for my vehicle at a much reduced Amazon price! I've had it in now for about a month and there have been no issues with it! Once again, a satisfied customer, thanks Amazon.
B001O7PNNM|3|I have been detailing cars for many years and bought this product on a whim, mostly out of curiosity regarding its name, \\"Ultimate Compound.\\" It is strange that these companies will label some of their products as an \\"ultimate\\" version despite their inferior performance compared to some other products offered by the same company. Meguiar's \\"Professional\\" line of compounds is far superior. For the price, it does a decent job but don't expect to remove anything beyond very fine and shallow scratches (not effective for wet-sanding). It's better than a can of $5 Turtle wax compound, but if you want great results, go with 3M's Perfect-It brand that is not much more expensive.
B00E6A7E0E|4|nice and perfect on my car
B00629VX54|4|Instructions are not much, had to track down over the internet to find who really provided to find some customer service to explain where to strap on a commander.
B003SYE6CS|5|works
B004DZ6RSC|4|Installed on a Switchblade windshield. The mount that comes with the bag would have required drilling a hole in the center of the windshield, so I used the slots for the handle bar straps and removed two acorn nuts from the windshield bracket and put wing nuts on the bolts inside the bag. If you want a small, sleek bag, this is not for you. I was a little off-put by the size of the bag at first, but now I am glad. I put a glasses case, cell phone, charger, and summer gloves inside and there is still room. Velcro flap makes it easily accessible. Glad I got it.<br /><br />Update: The curvature of the windshield kept the bag from fitting flush against it, giving it a kind of \\"bikini bridge\\" look. (Google the term, for a laugh.) I gave in and drilled a hole through the chrome windshield straps and the windshield to make this a center-mount bag. It was a little work, but it looks a lot better.
B005MEZIYM|1|Looked nice at start of use but in less the one year, the chrome is pitted and flaking off. Would not recommend.
B000COCTXA|5|This washer nozzle kit is incredibly simple, very easy to install, and works great!<br />My Mazda had two-stream sprayers and the wipers often left streak marks. These new sprayers spray a wide fan of streams, covering most of the windshield, and the wipers do not leave any streaks.<br /><br />One advice on installation, as someone else had mentioned, point the streams towards the upper part of your windshield; when you are driving, the air resistance tends to push the streams down somewhat.
B007LICJ0S|4|Giving it 4 stars because it doesn't have 4 mounting holes. My license plate holder only has screws on the bottom, do I had to mount this frame upside down. Not too noticeable that it's upside down, the frame is sturdy, though. And the teeth are sharp!
B00KDRDWLE|4|Had a few issues with fit. Tuning Pros took care of it right away. They were very easy to work with. Will order from them again.
B006P89P2U|5|Yes I am
B0023VBHMO|5|Installed on a 2004 Toyota Camry with a busted tail light. Pretty straightforward to replace/install. Well packaged. No instructions included but pretty easy to find a guide online.
B000AM8BF4|5|First time user great charger easy good instructions
B001JK1A4K|4|I bought this unit to replace a similar single device which I have used for about ten years but now I'm parking two cars in my garage. Way back then I had been using the tennis ball system but since I often use my garage for projects, I got tired of getting hit in the face with tennis balls while walking in the gargae without the car there.  The first thing I noticed was that the new lazers seemed much brighter than the old ones. They are so bright that I get a reflection off the windshield onto the ceiling. I compared the lazer label to the old one and was suprised that they were both class IIIA.  With the old lazer I had never paid much attention to the warning to \\"install in a location inaccessible to children or pets\\".  Although I don't often have children in my garage, I do have a dog and the first day the dog went right to the red spot on the floor snd sniffed at it. I later found myself dodging the lazers like I was in a mission impossible movie.  To minimize exposure to lazer light I reinstall the new unit the same way the old one was installed.  I took the battery out and pluged the transformer into one of the light sockets on the garage door opener with one of those inexpensive screw in converters you can buy at a hardware store.  In this configuration the lazer goes off when the garage door opener light times out and you can walk in the garage all day without the lazers on.  When I want to put the cars back in the garage without having opened the doors I turn the worklight switch on until the cars are parked and then turn it off. If I had small children frequently in the garage I would be uncomfortable useing this product.
B00FOX5KEY|5|nice quality product
B00KX35HTS|5|awesome worked perfectly
B003ZJ2HMM|5|Fit very well installed easy
B00CLPVBYQ|5|Very bright and well built bulbs. These are a little on the blue side but that is fine with me.
B005ETCIO8|5|Wonderful product
B00CXYVKKA|5|My truck has a much darker tint along the edges.  I lined it up and stuck it on.  Not many directions but it took me all of one minute and 42 seconds to put it on.
B0010E3JUI|5|Didn't notice any change in odor in my car, but I really didn't have a problem to begin with. But it's cheaper than OEM and even some of the other aftermarket filters! Perfect fit.
B00HE1BQWY|5|worked great.
B000MJXQ64|5|I like this set,
B000CI3Q1U|5|Fits in my 1994 Jeep YJ with no problems.  This is a good upgrade to a higher amp alternator from stock.
B008JEPUB8|4|I LOVE my flower.  colors are perfect for my 'tinker bell green' bug.  I love how the top layer of petals have wire in them so you can manipulate the petals like you want.<br />The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wish the stem was just a tad big longer.
B00B2HHDH8|5|Just barely fits my 1998 Ford Taurus SE's side markers.
B00062YZXU|5|i was looking for baby shades for the back of my wifes 2013 accord. we needed something to block the sun for our 2 newborns and my 5 year old daughter. so i purchased this and could have done full windows but since im no pro at window tint i cut out 2 large rectangles to cover the back seat side windows and 2 smaller rectangles for the other 2 mini windows. then i cut a piece the width of the whole back window thats approx 3-4 inches low to block sun there. sprayed soapy water and wiped with a plastic card till there were no bubbles. looks like a pro installed the rear nice and even and the side rectangles look like they were bought perfectly. i still have enough film left to probably do 1 more window. its nice to have spare. if i bought all of that seperatly it would of cost me over 30 dollars. this was perfect and cheap, very professional looking.
B0049Z4TN6|5|My old blew out. Got this one at a good price now I got music again. Oh and the shipping was fast and easy.
B0046BI6ZU|4|The seat covers were my son-in-laws birthday present.  When he put them on his truck he said  that they are beautiful and he really loves fhem.
B000YCDUVU|5|I own a 2012 Ford Escape Limited and these fit almost perfectly (despite what Amazon says).<br />The one flaw I did find concerned the driver/passenger seatbelt bolt, located just behind both seats near the floor - the plastic mold wasn't engineered to compensate for this so it sticks out a little. Nothing major of course, but thought I'd point it out. Kudos to WeatherTech for making a great product though; highly recommend.
B0029TQDLA|5|So far so good.  I live in the south and our cars get very hot.  So far I a satisfied
B00EF2R5XO|1|Description states that it comes with a switch. Mine did not come with a switch nor any instructions or anything in print at all, not even on the manufactures web site. Supposed to come with 4 bolts to mount lights to the truck and came with 3. Also, as stated by another review, the plugs on the wiring harness didn't match up with the bulbs. Will send this back. This seems to be the norm with most of the things coming from China.
B000TYL7KY|5|No problem fitting cap to my 2005 F150.  With about 10psi, worked great.  Couldn’t be happier, easiest brake bleeding ever.
B003PYV73C|3|they fit good just thought i was getting a cover for the small middle seat as shown....you only get the 2 seats
B0064IU5FW|5|Just got mine. Absolutely love it... Shut off the MDS...runs way better. Increased throttle response have the cold air intake program and with the k&n and diablo sport I'm up almost 4mpg in my 300c with the hemi! My advice BUY ONE!!!!
B00042JSNY|5|Thsi works well and is up to the high quality standards of Hi-Lift products. I do not go anywhere without it and my Hi-Lift Jack. American made quality!
B003PJPU7G|5|My trailer hitch fit as described and I was able to install it with no drilling.  It is well built and performs as intended.
B00LSNMYZM|5|Happy with this item !
B008X02RK0|5|Purchased two of these for a 2001 Buick LeSabre Limited. Very good price! Very good product! Restored the original ride quality. The car hasn't handled this well for a very long time! I almost didn't notice that it had gotten as bad as it was, but replacing them was a great decision!
B00UT26T68|5|I was so surprised by this item!! A LOT of BLING!! It is very shiny and eye catching.  Although I just put it on my car it seems to be great quality and was very easy to install! Everyone seems to love it.  I am very happy with this item and will be ordering another one!
B000YYN0O0|5|Perfect fit for R53 Mini Cooper S. For sure best bang for the buck!
B00276J2ZE|1|Product did not fit application even though it is listed as fitting my Silverado. Return policy makes it more cost effective to re-sell the item rather than return it. This is an item that would be better purchased through a Prime seller.
B000K03V7Y|5|Works just fine for the appropriate set up. I had no trouble with it and it is a must to seal your pipes.
B00W6J08ZK|5|Very pleased with my purchase!  Great price, fast delivery, and easy to install. Highly recommend!
B00CA5PJ5O|5|If you have a 2012 Town and Country you MUST take these to the dealership to program. I talked with a locksmith and they told me they would not do it - that the way most locksmiths do it is a hack and they don't want to do that.  My dealership charged me $50 to program two of these and they even cut the valet key for me (only asked them to program).  They work well - the range isn't as good as the ones that came with the car but now I have two spares. The fit is tighter when you use them - you have to rock them back and forth a little - but again now I have four keys instead of two - and if one gets broken no big deal.  The service guy at the dealership thought these were pretty good too - I have the BEST Chrysler dealership of ANYWHERE.  I would buy these again - well worth the money!
B007TG7HXG|5|Good price for a great blade!
B0038B1H2I|5|Easy to install, 100x better then stock
B00620Z97G|4|Great front light for bike. Very bright and noticeable to traffic. A big downfall and potentially dangerous is that when the battery goes dead, the light quits cold turkey!  Even when fully charged and using at the lower setting, it quit on me in less than an hour!  Very scary and frustrating!  I will try installing new batteries with longer lasting ratings to see if that helps.  The light itself is great!
B0030VECMI|5|Love these filters and great price
B00FQ7O88M|5|This little gadget is incredible!  Plug it in, and it shows up as a wireless network.  I used it with my iPhone and there are several free apps that you can use to try it out.  I am evaluating apps to purchase right now.  I tried this on all three of my family vehicles and it worked great!
B00E1TYLNS|5|installed it on my 05 06<br />extremely satisfied with this product. great sound i love it
B0068FX8Z0|4|The weight is good and easy to lift front section up.  Good visibility.  Vents work very well.
B005D53EQ4|5|Just what I was looking for. I'm zip tying this to the rear rack of my Vespa for extra storage options - large or odd sized boxes, etc. It's exactly what I was looking for. The color even matches the scooter. And, it's made in the USA!!! Shipping was fair and prompt - although I ordered it from them directly. Very pleased. I'll post a picture when I get a chance.
B0041E1YEM|5|Works great and was easy to install
B0036ULEV0|1|Leaks when not connected to tire. Tried 2, first one failed completely.
B001LA4IWE|5|This sticker is easy to install and looks great on the back window of my car. Be sure to follow the directions though when installing. It installs on the exterior window. Would be nice if they made it so it installed on the inside.
B003VRJXRU|3|Was easy enough to install per directions but has a cheaply made appearance. Working well for now and hope it will last a long time.
B0039ILD42|5|This fits my 06 Honda Pilot perfectly, just like the OEM. It is holding up well and there are no funny noises.
B000NHUKJG|5|Lost the original one so was looking for a replacement. Amazon comes through once again. Got what I needed for a fair price.
B002PQMLSG|5|Perfect fit and look great.  Fast shipment and easy to install.
B0051AUHX4|5|Excellent product and super excellent customer service!! Thank you!
B0002SR4Q8|5|This works great on the very small filter on my 1999 Maxima. I didn't even have to take the splash guards off! Highly recommend!
B00802GXFG|5|This is a great buy! I highly recommend these kits from Kensun. They are very reasonably priced and function perfectly... ive never had a problem. The Instructions ar mediocre because of the translations from whatever language but they get the point across. The Kensun case they come with is cheap but who cares! It keeps the kits save from damages as they are foam padded.<br /><br />Ive ordered multiple kits from this company and only once did i have something damaged from shipment. As soon as i emailed them telling them about a broken bulb, the promptly sent me a replacement with no questions asked. EXCELLENT customer service.<br /><br />Look no further... these are great HID kits.
B000CMF1KK|5|Worked perfectly. ..
B00M1OUBES|5|Great product. Had need for it not long after purchase and it worked just as advertised. It's super compact and easy to store. Also versatile. I'd recommend this to anyone.
B000SOKE5E|3|Useful but all the fuel does not drain out - a poor design because of this feature.The large opening makes pouring fuel easy.
B002P8EMK4|5|The broken mirror was difficult to remove so it was delightful to have a non corroded easy to replace new mirror to install.
B00189ANBS|5|Excellent seat. As others have posted, the hight seems different, but is actually the same. The difference is the front of the seat is angled up. It will move your knees up and bring them closer to the steering wheel. Overall, much better than my original jump seats. My 8.5&#34; wide center console still fits and is about 1/2&#34; from the two seats and doesn't rub even when I am sitting in the seat.<br />Be warned, these seats are NOT cloth and vinyl, they are completely cloth, which I preferred anyway.
B000RNW5PS|5|I have a 2005 Chevy Silverado. The hitch was very easy to install no drilling, uses 2 bolts already in truck and 4 bolts it comes with. I would recommend this hitch to everyone
B000JK116I|4|Just making sure everyone know this is two mats, not one.  Listing is misleading.  Good heavy duty mats with deep channels.
B00RD4D9AO|4|Instructions sort of irrelevant but it was not too difficult to install. Didn't have an 18 mm socket. 19 mm too large. 3/4 &#34; worked fine. Go figure. Definitely recommend.
B0065RJ6IE|2|Purchased these from a vendor on Amazon in late 2011 (Nov), for my 2001 Lexus LS430.  After about six month I noticed my front end started shaking when I applied my brakes. When I took in for service they told me my rotors were warped and since they were drilled and slotted, couldn't be ground down, so they had to be replaced.  I wasn't expecting that, since I hadn't had these rotors more than 8 months.  I've contacted the vendor (Advan Racing), still waiting on them to address my request to replace or refund these rotors since they are still under their one year warranty.  I have had great experiences with Amazon any time I had to return an item, but since this is through a vendor selling on Amazon, well, I will have to let you know how this ends...............  I'm hoping it just a case of a rare single incident defect, if I get these replaced and don't have any more issues, then we'll know that's the case, however, until then I would recommend caution when considering purchasing from this vendor.<br /><br />WDJ Suffolk, VA
B0049EGWSC|5|excellent
B0015D4ZNY|5|Works perfect
B007TY62S4|5|I replaced a broken taillight on my 2008 Buick Enclave  with this product about 6 weeks ago. The light install was quick and easy (about 10 minutes), and it has worked great.
B001C6N580|4|It's a good filter, just not for a 2009. A good Wix # is 49570, and you get 2 in a pack. I ordered and returned a set of two of these before I found the right number on Google. The good news was that the 2-pack of 49570s was only ~ $3 more than a single 49001.
B0000UZ528|2|Poor quality. Not well designed.
B002P48O2U|5|These chairs are sturdy, comfortable, and serve the intended purpose (sitting at an outdoor table).  I would surely purchase again and likely will add more
B00K0VMXDQ|5|Impressed so far, but I haven't had to jump a car yet. Came 75% charged.
B000X9EGFS|5|This is the Godzilla of portable air compressors. It's big, weighty, and robust. Yet still small enough to be called \\"portable.\\" Everything about it is high quality and well built. I've owned a number of these things. They never seem to last. I'm thinking this one will go the distance.
B007IVRWPK|5|This worked out perfectly and was cheaper than what places in town wanted to charge me.
B00B1EXEP2|5|Fits as advertised and plug is factory.
B000CGHR76|5|This product was installed shortly after receiving it, and it is working as it was meant to.  So far so good.
B004FOR9VA|5|Good
B00C306860|5|Great product for awesome price!
B007P7461K|5|very good and reasonable price
B009TU9S9G|4|came with everything needed to installed but had trouble with the driver side..didnt have enough room for the bolts to go threw the brackets but i did a little bit a work on the bracket in my shop. an it went on perfect.. but besides that im proud of the huge diff between the stock in these aftermarket ones they about stick out another 4-5 inches when there folded down and hardly vibrates
B003ZJ2IQM|3|Chezp plstic.pep boys offered better quality for same price. 1st shipment,both front vent were damaged. Call amazon for replcemnt takes 2 weeks despite I am a prime member. Otherwise, the producf is ok, shape not really for sienna despite advertised. Will not recommend to others.pep boys have better quality.
B00JEPER42|4|The shackles were a little to wide so I added some stainless washers to it and it works fine I was also unable to install the front torsion keys looks fine with stock keys cranked but customer service is great and willing to help also very fast shipping
B00H8T3ZJO|2|Can't put the receiver pin in when the rear bumper is installed. You would think polaris would have been smarter on designing a hith that works with and without a rear bumper.
B004A2D4NY|5|Part was an exact fit. Works great.
B001GJ3E8Y|4|I usually like Mothers products, but to me this one's got a couple of fatal flaws:    1. It's too soft to really scrub a tire (except perhaps a fragile whitewall)  2. It's too big with bristles that are too short to effectively scrub a wheel.    I'm left thinking that this brush is stuck between being a tire brush and being a wheels brush. I ended up buying smaller brushes for my wheels and might still use this for tires, but it turns out it's a highly specialized tool that I'd recommend only for whitewalls and for someone who already has a wheel brush.    That said, the construction is good, the rubber surround prevents scratching during cleaning, and it's cheap.
B001TQ6DMS|5|Bright, compact, and well made, the battery pack was defective that I ordered separately, but they say that was the only one they had heard of, but back to this, after figuring out the shorts and wires on my old honda, this thing works great, tested it out on a ride back from ice fishing, and once I got it lined up the way I needed it (while driving, not recommended), I could see way better than my old lights could, and got mistaken for a new snowmachine pulling into town, the mount works great on the small light dash in between the handle bars and plug is just the right length to reach the optional power source near the front brake lever.      Once again, styling and useful.
B0022ZU1V4|5|The rain cover works very well and it fits perfectly and keeps the seat dry. I would recomend this product to anyone.
B0016I8E1M|5|If you're looking for a heavy duty, great looking carrier that doesn't look like scrap metal on the back of your vehicle, this is a very strong contender.  It's heavy when assembled, but that's kinda the point.  The receiver arm is longer than most, so you can walk between the car and the carrier, possibly even opening the rear door on many vehicles while loaded.  The receiver arm also puts the carrier up above the wheel spray, keeping cargo drier.  The added height may make loading heavy or bulky items a little more work.  But this is one good-looking, very heavy duty carrier.<br /><br />Note that the weight of the carrier in shipping may cause the internal cardboard components of the shipping box to break, resulting in a little scuffing.  I don't know how that can be avoided.  If the scuffing is bad, you may want to re-spray paint the carrier.  I figured the carrier was eventually going to be scuffed up from use, so didn't bother making a big deal of it.  You really only notice the scuffing when you put it together the first time.
B002J8UPO2|5|Got this as a gift for a zebra-loving friend! Cute, inexpensive, what's not to love with this cute little thing?
B008BVZMGW|1|did not work
B0013WF2PC|5|These wipes are super moist and will remove almost any stain in your car. I've used them for 2 or 3 years and ran out and couldn't find them anywhere. That's how well the wipe's work I have very light interior in my car and I don't like make-up smudges or grandbaby fingerprints or food like catsup, ect. The product I got was perfect
B00H34F2BI|5|I have a dark blue leather furniture set that's about 5 years old and gets used a lot. I was genuinely surprised at how well this Glacier Car Care worked. First of all, as soon as you open the bottle, you notice a great smell of oranges. The cleaner itself dispenses from a spout which makes it nice, no chance of losing the lid or dumping it over.....experience talking there. The cleaner comes with a glove with really allows you to rub it in. I did one section at a time and simply wiped the cleaner off after a couple of minutes with a microfiber towel. The difference was noticeable immediately! You could see the yuck on the towel.<br /><br />After cleaning my furniture, I followed up with Glacier Car Care Conditioner. This conditioner smells like leather. I loved that! It includes a microfiber towel which you wet and then apply the conditioner to. You work your way one section at a time until the area is covered. The bottle recommends letting the treated item dry for 1-2 hours before sitting on so I did so. My leather furniture looks brand new. It took me about 2 hours to do the entire set: couch, love seat, two chairs and ottoman and was so worth it! I am so glad I was given the opportunity to test these products for quality. I am looking for other leather stuff around the house to clean now!
B00480J4PU|5|It works perfectly with my 2006 BMW 325i.
B003BRYTU6|1|This trim ring looks great but after only 3 weeks the rhinestones started falling out.  At first just a couple but now there are less than 1/2 of them left.  Cheap junk from China no doubt.  However the other diamond ice accessories appear to be better quality and are still in good shape.
B004VIA0LG|5|this full body armor fits just wright.It settles on your riding t shirt excellent.I will buy one again if i need to
B001TFE38A|4|Good stuff but a but over-hyped. may buy again...
B001UOVYHS|5|Not too big not too small. Just right. Color is perfect. My Prius looks a little better than yours. ha. AND REASONABLY PRICED! boom done.
B008971VOK|4|The only think I disliked about it was that it had some scuff marks on it and there are no covers for the bolts to make it look just as nice.
B00G1RKS6C|5|Great size and price. Not too big,  putting this on my kayak
B001D0FMPO|5|Worked perfectly on my 88 range rover 3.5
B00LNDK5DA|5|Great
B00TWLIXU2|4|Works great... just wish it could be used more thane once on a single charge.
B0089Q9INM|5|This will fit the O'Neal Fast track II for anyone interested. Looks great, not too dark at night, but would keep the clear shield on you if you decided to go out for a long ride.
B0009I2OO8|5|I really thought I was going to have a hard time installing this harness, but it was easy. I had it in and working in no time!
B0015PK3AG|5|Item received in less than a week. This new addition to the toolbox will make the most time consuming step now one of the easiest
B007TB71GO|4|Holds the bike much steadier than a hitch mounted bike rack.<br /><br />The closer rack is a wee bit too small to hold my bike.
B0074OUTTC|5|Took the insides of my keyless entry and transferred it into the new pink shell within minutes.  It's too cute.
B000QR6XJ4|5|My wife and I love this air freshener.  We have used the Blue Magic citrus for many years.  Once we tried the lemon, we had a new favorite.  The lilac is nice, too, but we prefer the lemon.
B000V8VZ78|5|I love the smell of the stuff, it's not nauseating like most leather cleaners and it doesn't leave any streaks behind if you let it sit, the seats have been beat on and were very dirty and stained, now with a couple wipes they look amazing! I highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking to restore their leather.
B00IO7NCYM|2|Come on time but packing was not good. Rotors were banging around and got a couple of dings and small chips out of rotors.
B002GZ6SOO|5|Clear!!!
B001KSAT8E|3|The OEM filter sold by the Land Rover dealer is better constructed, has more pleats, and is made in Germany.  This filter is made in China.  The flaps on the side are shorter than the original.  It's not clear that this will cause any problems.  The size of the core filter is approximately the same as the old filter, which we purchased from the dealer.  It fits.  We'll use this filter in for now, but we'll purchase a different one when we replace it.
B001RZA3C2|5|I feel like this is too much to pay for something as simple as a kickstand but this is the cheapest one I could find. With that being said, it is really well made and fit like a glove. I have a 2004 Yamaha YZ450f. I would order again in a heartbeat vs having to find something to lean my bike up against every time I stop.
B004Y9XB22|5|Works well with my pocket portable devices with their OEM wall chargers where I do not have car adapters, or where special adapters are required.
B007HRN4N4|5|better than the orginal
B005FH1HRS|4|Definitely cool decals to put on your bike or scooter etc. I used these for my 5 year old's scooter but was not impressed with the quality of the reflection material ( not so reflective ). Besides that, all was as described.  Would definitely have given it a 5 star rating if it weren't for that minor detail.
B0073I3ON2|4|nice and clear, one downside no bulbs installed.
B002ZBWKAU|3|Small, takes a long time to inflate a car tire. Does okay on bike tires.
B000C91HHY|5|My husband installed this sensor in a 2001 Nissan Altima GLE. He wanted me to mention the fit is perfect and also to recommend the Lisle 12100 Oxygen Sensor Socket that you can find right here on Amazon because the socket is deep and you will not have to remove the heat shield off the exhaust manifold.
B004G9VIXE|5|My rear door had not locked automatically for over a year.  I found a youtube video on line showing how to install it.  30 minutes later I was done.
B000CM3I9G|5|Broke my original plowing , used it as my base , This new mirror was cut to exact fit and placed over the old with clear adhesive goop. Can't tell it has two mirrors together ,,great item .
B004J7IJAS|5|perfect fit
B00MF5FRV0|5|Worked great started 5.3 motor no problem
B009O4S1QI|4|K&N for this Jeep was a good boost to power and torque. Little noisy, but worth it. CA emissions equipment is a joke, so all you CA Jeep guys and girls listen up.
B0080DQIJG|4|Part has been installed over a month now with no issues
B00H5XFG9U|5|product is perfect.works great.
B00513G82U|5|Great purchase for the price. But needs to come with installation instructions.
B007Y85858|4|It worked great.
B00EJFH6YA|5|arrived as expected and worked just fine on the rest bench - I was unable to appreciate how good this little bar was until I put together a mounting solution to fit it into the inter cooler gap on my 5.0 f150 - I work overnights so I am frequently making lengthy trips in very dark areas where deer and other creatures like to wander across my path. This bar will light up three lanes of traffic (from the middle lane) all the way out to at least 3-400 yards .. I've always wanted something like this for auxiliary lighting but not enough to drop 500$ on a name brand bar. So far so good. Will revise rating if needed.
B005WTPC4S|5|Ok, so I've had my share of disappointments with wiper blades just like everyone else. It always seemed that at around 65 mph, my wiper blades would lose their effectiveness and leave a streak right at eye level on my windshield. I saw these and was hesitant to buy them because of the price, since I was expecting to be disappointed again. Well much to my surprise, these blades are awesome. We just had 2 back to back snow storms, and these blades worked the best of any I've ever had on my current truck, and my previous one. I was zipping along today and these blades did not leave a streaked area in my field of vision, in fact, no streaked area at all. I am very pleased with these so far, and I hope that for the price, they last awhile.
B00C8C7C40|5|My 05 Focus ZX4 was having an issue when accelerating.  It would stutter like it was going to die and the check engine light was on.  I bought this at half the price the local auto stores were charging and works perfect.  Easy replacement, no more stutter and no more check engine light.
B007ZDG37E|5|I love it! It looks very expensive!!!!
B009TAA6K6|1|Fitment of these mats is fairly good in my 2013 X3, but it's not perfect or even as good as I expected it to be. The back mat fits very well, but there is a major problem with the front passenger mat. The vehicle has a storage net on the right side of the bottom of the center console, down in the passenger foot-well. The net sits roughly 1 1/2&#34; from the floor, and the raised lip on the floor mat comes up over the net. Because of this, the mat does not fit flush against the side of the console.  Another shortcoming unrelated to fitment is the ability of the mats to stay in place. The front mats move around despite their quite prickly undersides. While not really a problem on the passenger side, the mat has bunched up somewhat around the throttle pedal, causing me some reservations about the safety of the mat. As it doesn't interfere with the brake pedal operation, it's probably not an issue.  As for the color of these mats, the tan is not a good match for the vehicle's carpet. This gives the overall impression that the mats are cheap or substandard, despite their significant cost.  All told, I regret not buying the slightly more expensive weathertech mats.  UPDATE October 30, 2015: After roughly 4 months of use, I've ditched the front mats in favor of the original BMW mats. The driver-side mat is always moving and covering the bottom of the accelerator pedal, and I no longer feel they are safe. A simple fix from the manufacturer would be to integrate a piece of velcro on the bottom of the mat to attach to the floor the way the BMW mats do. This is simply not a well-designed product. I would not recommend these to anyone at this price point.
B000C9QEF4|5|OEM, exact replacement. Awesome quality! A++++++
B0028NEWCO|4|My second pair of these I like them so much.  Very durable.  Make sure you like smaller fitting sunglasses.  They don't come with a case but or the price, get them.
B00FKHKQ0W|4|Easy to install and very sturdy. Mount jack with handle away to clear windshield washer. Would have 5 stars if it actually came with a lock.
B004L1ZOHI|2|Even with universal clips for the 2008 Ford F250 there was to much play with the brake pad in the OEM rotor. Probably a good brake pad but I went with CARQUEST Platinum and fits as good as OEM.
B00B6Z1LLK|3|Very tough to install.
B000RTG012|5|I highly recommend this light for any project you are working on.  In the garage is where I use it but you can use it in your storage room or your shed. Perfect!
B00IKQRCUC|5|Just what I needed. there was absolutely no way I would have been able to crawl under the car and install this myself. Had to have the car put on a lift. The mechanic also said there would have been no way they could have installed this unless the car was lifted. I only took 30 minutes to install - 20 minutes to get the car on the lift and back off again; 10 minutes to install the part.
B00EVC1HKA|5|They are very bright and were simple to install.  Considering the price and how well they work, I definitely recommend these bulbs!
B00AJVLHIE|5|Excelent piece!  And TH Marine is a great and safe place to buy all you need.  They will do everything possible to help you on whatever you need.  Thank you TH Marine!
B000SL4AA2|4|Perfect for adjusting pressures as needed, just what I was looking for
B00553WYT2|5|Great item would order from them again.
B001EOYIH2|5|Very pleased with the quality of this Curt Receiver, and while it did require drilling the frame of my vehicle, this was not difficult, and the resulting installation seems quite sturdy and is a perfect fit.  I have used other Curt products and been quite pleased with the quality, as I am with this product.
B000CFSL1I|5|i reside in a foreign country and brought a nice wrapped package home friday last, only to realize that the regulator is defective.<br />BUT IN ALL.....THIS IS A TRULY AMAZING PRODUCT, WHICH WAS SOLD BY A VERY GOOD COMPANY, HAD NO REGRETS ON BUYING THIS PRODUCT, ESPECIALLY FROM THIS COMPANY. I GIVE THEM A 10 STAR RATING.
B00JCHNDVA|1|Decal. Cheap quality. Won't last if ur in a state w hot, regular sunshine.
B001ABJMAC|5|Great product, easy to install and works the way it was designed. You do notice an improvement in performance and fuel economy.
B002IL3Q82|3|first of all. the gloves themselves are great. seems they will last a long time. i ordered a large/XL size. normally on an alpinestar glove (like the smx-2), im XL. these were a little big for me. im returning mine because of two things; i need a size smaller. and they sent me two right hand gloves, no left (hence why i gave it 3 stars). also one of them had a little scuff marks on the knuckle.<br /><br />the gloves are, like ive mentioned earlier, great. i might die the bluish grey part of them to black when i get another one :)
B009FNX2EO|4|Fit perfectly, easy to install.
B001P5SU24|5|I ordered two of these battery chargers because of price and quality. I use these on two deep cycle batteries and my 3-wheeler small battery. They are excellent and I would buy them again, very goood quality and very easy to use! THANKS! Smokey
B00F9TOCK6|2|When I got bra missing parts then when got parts there was still missing parts.it was 2 weeks before  I could install bra. Then after cutout for license plate. Two cords broke for securing the bra underneath bumper.not good
B008MAQNO2|5|Though I was a little apprehensive at first, I found this to be a great product and very easy to install. Follow the instructions step-by-step and you'll have no problems.
B000C36BIU|5|It's the best belt I have ever used. The grip is far superior to normal belts. Even when wet, it won't slip. The increased horsepower and gas mileage doesn't hurt either.
B004SCYMPA|5|Fit perfect
B000GTSB2O|5|These are the ones you want. I changed my stock bushings to these when I changed my Harley's bars.  Big upgrade.
B00ATGGZ2C|5|awesome classic sticker i get asked or acknowledges saying that's awesome
B00FT6C2O2|1|Very disappointed in the quality of this car cover. It is VERY thin and does not do a good job of protecting the car. It was a waste of money.
B002BG4WX2|1|I have a 2001 f150 5.4l I have a small leak I used the red angel in my ac and it didn't work at all it's a big waste of money says as long as the leak lasted longer than half and hour mines last 4 months I contacted them and I'm waiting on a response cause it says money back guarantee if it doesn't fix it I'll keep everyone updated
B003YDY7YK|4|The item was fine. It work great . The only thing was recive two days late due the deliver service. But everything else is fine.
B00AZ4Q9YM|5|Fit my truck right. what more could you ask.
B000CPJLQM|3|It does the trick if your trying to cover something,I used this on my rims for minor curb rashes and it works,just use it lightly so it doesn't offset the actual chrome appearance and no one will even be able to tell...although if you wash your car and wheels for cleaning be careful not to rinse the areas you sprayed to much,or you will have to do another coat of spray again...nothing major just a precaution
B000H0QS3G|5|I Ordered 2 for fog replacements, they worked as expected and are priced nicely.  Nothing more to say really, it gets the job done.
B0031I5U9Y|5|Perfect fit.  Good buy.
B008UAATDA|5|This set of leather care products stays handy when I need to clean my leather products. The #3 leather protector basically made my leatherbag waterproof. Water beads up and rolls off. Great for rainy Seattle days. Would recommend keeping a set handy.
B008DWGBPK|5|Fit perfect. Would recommend to all Amazon shoppers.
B00D5BX224|5|Arrived before expected and works great!
B00NO23YJA|3|Thanks!
B000QGJT7I|5|My Vstar 1300 with Bars looks great!!! I love it!<br />For removing old bolts you have to heat them. Yamaha using Red Loctite on bolts, easy to strip bolt head. After heat them (~300-400F) with mini torch ($25 from local hardware store) they are very easy to remove. Then clean tread!
B00B9SB3FS|5|These things are awesome!
B005OK402K|1|This product is not well made I bought 2 for our 13 hour car ride and they both broke after a hour;  in different spots.
B000BZZFV8|1|I don't know why I didn't notice the other reviewers comments. He is correct. The pads fit, but the anti-squeal clips are far too narrow for the stock G35 calipers. I wasted 30 minutes wirebrushing my old clips so I could re-install them. If I didn't need my car everyday, I would have sent these back. Infuriating and inexcusable.
B003V1DG9C|5|Everything works great now. Husband pleased with everything he bought from this dealer. He has a up and running 2 wheeler, and will purchase parts from this dealer again if the need arises. Do recommend to others. Thankyou
B000C2S85K|5|Fast Shipping and Quality Product! Direct OEM replacement on 2000 Jeep Cherokee (XJ) 4x4 Sport (4dr). No cutting required for correct length for me! Lube up the openings with antifreeze if you are having trouble pushing them onto the heater coil feed/returns; oh, and flush out the heater core while your doing this (you'll knock out some of the crud that prevents these Jeeps from hotter air in the winter) *Unless your water pump is crap
B00O97CWD8|5|Very nice!  Fit perfectly and look as they will last forever!
B0041TU2XQ|5|As good as original.
B005JXG89U|4|Good gloves, just not thick enough.  I do get a lot of raves!
B002P8IHDC|5|I ordered this mirror from Amazon for one half the price that all of the locals wanted. I'll admit that I was skeptical at first but when I got the mirror it was a perfect replacement and worked just great. Definetly will keep Amazon in mind for future needs.
B0056YR8TG|5|Very amazing quality.  Fits like a dream. 2009 Ninja 650R
B00AI2WCCY|5|Awesome light! Quality built with heavy metal case. I put these on my John Deere 825i! Night into day. I am getting two more.
B003FBV8ZW|3|Padding on these is basic and will recommend them for eventual ridding needs.  These don't provide full eye protection when riding fast, but given it's price they are ok for urban-short-slow rides.
B008YFI604|5|I use this in my !985 Jeep CJ-7. It helps remove some of the ethanol and helps the gas too.
B000RFUYQI|4|It get the job done, with my Air Hammer..
B00DSA45ZK|5|it fits my mini cooper but too small for the larger Honda civic window
B001AIZ5HY|5|Be careful not to scrath the metal parts of you car around the headlights
B00480FIMI|5|Doable and great lighting it gives longer distance vision compare to the genuine bulb used on my fj cruiser just great I like it
B0000UZ514|3|works as advertised for holding trash etc, not sure velcro on bottom really adds any grip to standard auto carpeting
B00DDYNUC0|4|Fits snug and looks great. Came in two pieces and they screw together and it slips and snaps into place
B002HRNP8S|5|Just what I needed. Works well at the back of the car keeping things in place. Use it for tennis racquets , balls etc
B00AOIM2CC|4|I have had this for several months and have had no problems.  I do have to redirect my wifi to it when next to my home and sometimes again after I have shut the engine off but I consider that a minor inconvenience.  It works well with Dash Command and other iPhone Apps.  Nothing fancy but so far a solid performer.
B00ESCV7IK|5|My 11 year old son bought them. He is really happy with them. Sticked a lot on his binder, some others on his bike.
B002M6P104|5|Wow great rollup cover great price.  Installed in about 40mins with the use of only  3-4 tools - 2 socket sizes and an open end wrench. Thats it.  very easy to do and works perfect with my Ramboxes.  Seems tight and secure.  Perfect fit and auto adjusting spring tensioners are nice feature.  Can be opened by pulling trigger on one side.  Profile is maybe 3/4\\" above the Rambox surface. Well engineered to make installation into the existing Utilitrac rails a piece of cake by just removing end caps and sliding 3 mounting flagnges along each side.  Very very happy and so glad I didn't buy the $600 mopar offering from the dealer - which sat up about 1.75\\" above the top rail and inferior material.  On a side note I was skeptical that the price and free shipping from Zig's was legit - well I ordered from them on a Wednesday and item was at my door Friday before noon! Pennsylvania to New Orleans in 2 days . Brand new in box and as promised - great service and friendly when I called.
B002XL2IEA|5|Quickly allows you to remove all water from your water lines for winterization. Simple to connect and use with air compressor. I then filled with anti-freeze just to be safe.
B000C7QHT4|5|This is the same model that my local autoparts stores were selling for 40-50% more than on Amazon. It has been on my car for months. No problems with it so far.
B00HK27HWK|5|fits perfectly. looks good. makes grille look like stock chrome. would definitely recommend this product to anyone else with a newer highlander.
B002P33KVQ|3|should come with more fittings (two 90° instead of just one).
B007VLFECU|3|When I put them in I was very happy with the color and the look it brought to my car, but one of the bulbs had all but one of the leds burnt out on the end cap piece.  I really didn't mind that a few were burnt out, you couldn't tell from a few feet away; after about three days the one with a few already burnt out went completely out... I guess I might should have went with more expensive lights from the beginning.  Because one bulb worked perfect, I gave three starts... I may have just gotten a defective bulb.
B003KVOK9S|5|If you are a true Ultraman fan you will like this decal. A lot of people will ask you...who is that? Let's get some attention to a good show from back in the day :-)
B000BGM7LS|5|15 minutes to install, Slides very smoothly, No leaks. Very sturdy.
B00BKEYBEQ|1|Not easy to use.  Finish did not last very long.  The results was less that I expected.  I will probably try something different next time.
B002R1N7H8|5|Purchased for a 2001 Chevy Extreme and it fit perfectly. Was installed in less than 2 minutes. Would recomend to everyone!
B000QUN7GI|5|On time & great price
B00JX47EU8|4|good deal
B000XQ9MGE|5|Quick shipping and product is as described.  One week after purchase my son's car battery died.  He used it with excellent results. The instructions on the charger were clear and his car started with the first &#34;jump&#34;.  I checked the battery indicator and it showed no loss of charge.  I am extremely pleased with this product!
B000H6P55W|3|This product was much smaller than I expected.  Could not put a tote, too tall.  Even boxes had to be small.<br />Although, it did keep items dry, and the straps held very nicely.  I was moving about 8 hours away and ran into<br />alot of rain, snow and wind.
B005CLP8XG|5|Great
B0013LDN7C|1|STAY AWAY FROM THESE. GIVEN THE TERRIBLE QUALITY AND SUB-PAR CUSTOMER SERVICE YOU ARE BETTER SPENDING YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE.<br /><br />I've been using these boot covers for nearly a year now and I have two main issues with them:<br /><br />1. They are of marginal quality. After just a few times of wearing them the elastic band under the heel on one of the covers came loose and was dangling. I cut it off for fear of it getting tangled on something on the bike. I do notice that the cover catches the wind more now that it is missing. More importantly though, after less than a year of use, the boot covers began to tear at the seam that holds the velcro. This issue leads me to my next problem.<br /><br />2. Nelson-Rigg customer service is a pathetic joke. I called when the elastic band broke on the bottom of the cover and they asked that I send them back to be inspected. Given Houston winters can be wet I asked if it would be possible to send a replacement in advance so I was not without boot covers. They kindly would do so but I'd be charged a fee in order to get an advanced pair. Keep in mind their idea of an advanced pair is I buy them online directly from them and when they decide to replace the defective pair they would refund the money (minus their 5% fee of course).<br /><br />The same issue occurred when I called about obtaining a warranty replacement after the seems started splitting. I would need to send in the covers for them to inspect them before they would replace them. If I wanted an advanced pair to use in the interim, I had to fork over the costs (which is fine by me) but once they decided to replace them, they would charge me a fee and refund the purchase.<br /><br />STAY AWAY FROM THESE. GIVEN THE TERRIBLE QUALITY AND SUB-PAR CUSTOMER SERVICE YOU ARE BETTER SPENDING YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE.
B005XEFADU|5|My husband uses this on our RV and he says it is the BEST PRODUCT for the Black Tank on the market!!  It is excellent!
B009DK1M4Q|2|The part fits the truck. I had it in a week from ordering it. I had to take it out of the truck after two days of use. The metal bracket on the back that pushes the lever down to open the door bent outward, so I bent it back, it lasted a day, and I replaced it again. I would not recomend this one to anyone , but I did order another of Amazon that did work.
B002SE1FBY|5|These are very nice.  They fit perfectly and seem like they will be durable for several years.  At this price, they had better last.  These won't slide around at all.
B007I6EXO8|3|It nice but it is started to come apart after a few months.
B007QFKKWK|5|Part was exactly as described, new and identical to factory part.  Price was very reasonable and easy to install.
B007L2JNT4|3|Mirror cover fit like a glove,were a big help towing only problem was holding  and getting in to position of ouyside mirror,once their was ok.was worth the savings as apposed to new mirrors.
B006MIXNXU|5|Good product, fast delivery.
B0002UEMZ2|5|I use this for a variety of purposes like auto care, firearms, household repairs, etc. It works great on all of them.
B00DU0DVZI|2|Bummer, beautiful detailing too fricking hot for a summer jacket. Excellent return policy.Is more a fall/spring jacket
B00FSCDI7C|5|Its very good
B00C43PLGY|1|cheap plastic will break
B000BQK5YY|4|It does the job but will not last, not sturdy enough.
B00J5KYSTA|3|Tried all the different ways to install, still got bubbles...
B0075RQQNQ|5|great quality, arrived a lot faster than thought. looks really nice.
B000A8MIE8|5|good cross reference on page , found what fit my car and ordered. arrived quick and fit my wheels with no problem
B0057YSRUE|5|Great product
B000M5YZKO|4|Nice tool for closed drum
B001D2E88Y|1|I love these magnets for the car to hold my cell phone, but this one didn't stick for some reason. Bummer!
B00JU65OP6|5|Item shipped very quickly. My girlfriend who lives in the hot Arizona desert has no complaints yet.
B009IE2R0U|5|Mobil always been a great product!
B001O07VI4|5|Very strong
B00681BDXI|4|IT'S NOT CONNECTED YET, BUT IT IS AS EXPECTED.....<br />THE SERVICE IS EXCELLENT<br />IT HAS ARRIVED IN FAST TIME ...<br />I THINK IT HAS BEEN MADE FOR MY CAR<br />BUYING THIS REMOTE CONTROL HAS BEEN GOOD AND USEFUL
B006P1RVTQ|2|Bearing are made in china. Not necessarily a bad thing but history shows poor quality. Could feel tapping as I rolled them with my finger. What can you do to mess up a hub? I got two of these. One was fine. The other one had messed up threads on two of the studs. Had to re-die them to get the lug nuts on. Could see where the thread pattern changed about a fourth of the way in. Looked like they might have tried to rethread the starting threads, cross threaded and only went a quarter inch on? Hope it will be ok.
B000OUUG9G|4|Nice set, but did not have the short pins I hoped for
B000OAZD8A|3|Good except it is yellowish.
B0015RFIA4|4|Use this in my F-350 diesel as the replacement element in Driven Diesel post-pump filter kit.<br /><br />Blocks down to 2 microns, and water, to keep my expensive injectors running well.  Amazon has about the best price around, and fast free shipping.<br /><br />This is a pressure filter, not a suction filter, so buy/install accordingly.
B0058DIDTY|4|Product was great
B004VTF1PA|5|They look nice
B00FQ0RH8W|5|Hyundai Elantra that would hard start after getting gas and a P0440 error. Switched this part out, error code was fixed and no longer hard starts after filling with gas.
B003CXXLUS|5|Great cover!
B00KTIQLXI|5|does what everything I needed to do
B005G9C6YS|1|Junk!!
B000OUX9R2|5|Wish I had purchased prior to changing all my ignition coils. Will share this light set with friends and family.
B000SOFLHK|5|Works great and as described. A must have for fuel that has been stored for any length of time. Great flow rate.
B001EOV492|5|This is great fits perfect and twice as autozone
B00DJBQ1SW|5|Great
B000C10E1W|1|I was trying to save money, and this boot assembled very well, but it only stayed on the CV Joint end for a few days.  I've been an auto and aircraft mechanic and installed the bands around the ends very tightly with perfectly clean surfaces, but the boot is too stiff to flex properly.  After spending $24 for the boot, I spent $75 for a new axle (Honda Accord) and installed it, which took the same amount of time as putting on the boot.  Nice idea, very poor product.
B00029WYDU|4|My husband likes this product and won't use anything else on his Ford teuck
B001G7O4U8|1|It does not fit Honda Accord 2000. Wrong part. It look like it belongs to a different car. Not OEM.
B001CTRKFQ|5|PIAA 9008 bulb is very bright, I have a 2004 ford f150. The factory bulbs were dim and yellow, I installed these bulbs Saturday and what a difference they make. I have problems seeing at night and now i see better and i love the white light with just a hint of blue, I just installed them 2 days ago so i dont know how long they last. 5 star for now, Im inpressed with the brightness.
B007Z4XFR4|5|nice grille
B0045LCU80|1|The product is wrongly displayed only received the 7oz. can and the two others are not part of the shipment.  The picture is deceiving it makes you think that it comes with the 2 other cans.  The can came in and worked for 15 seconds then stopped working.  I have used this product before and it is a good product but expensive from this dealer you can get a 13 oz can for $20.00 and paid this one $17 for a 7 oz..
B00164QO54|4|I've had it for 9 years now and it's always been great. Only complaint: latch gets sticky on a regular basis and has to be taken out to clean-up. Just regular use causes it too. Not a dusty or grimy environment.
B00IZK3XI8|5|Perfect to replace the original shocks Struts. Manufactured with high quality standars. I'm very happy with this product.
B005TTZNHW|5|On a JK even a 2&#34; lift using the stock track bar will shift the front axle over to the right by more than 1&#34;, making the steering very weird.  This bar made it possible to get the axle perfectly centered and cured the steering float.  It's easy to adjust and install, although the 1 7/8&#34; lock nut is very difficult to tighten after the bar is in place.  Better to get the length set, tighten the nut, and then install it.
B00EA6FB6I|5|Good quality fits well. Like the soft feel.  Easy to install. Wood buy again
B008VM0TLO|1|The provided straps undue themselves while driving.  I used zip ties to do the job but the zip ties can't fit in the same location as the straps so the base pulls up when the screen is extended for use.  Maybe they should use velcro reinforced straps to prevent them from coming undone - a very cheap fix to make everyone happy.  I would pay $25 for this instead of $69 with the current design. Installed in 2012 Subaru Legacy.
B00HQQRPWM|3|the needle light went out after a weeks use.
B0056R7INY|1|The quality is outstanding, only problem is... I didn't purchase it!!! But none the less it was shipped to me and I was billed for it. Not cool!!!!!
B00AWVGGDM|5|The rear bumper protector was delivered as originally indicated.  Arrived in protective packaging.  Was easy to install and has been on the bumper for about a month now with no issues.
B00KQPENMK|5|It was exactly as advertised and it works perfectly.
B00MJ44NR6|3|The sticky tape on wrong side . Had to use glue.
B008MC9JAK|5|Good
B005MZVMMI|5|these are very large cat heads and since my daughter loves cats I bought her a few different ones and she loves they I like that they are so large it makes them easy to find
B002G1UO7U|5|Fits perfect! Thank you. Co version from 12 to 134 a breeze.
B004GW5FEY|4|It seems to be quite sturdy, but will not know until it is actually utilized.  If I find it to not be as good as expected, I will update the review at a future time.
B000ALIRMW|5|Though I had some trepidation about removing and replacing the struts for my 300m's trunk lid, I need not have worried. It turns out the old struts simply slip off the pins holding them to the lid and the new ones slip on. The entire operation took only a few minutes.
B006BE0QEO|5|Works perfectly with very easy programing.  Great value over dealerships.
B004GCELR6|5|Perfect fit paid half the price from the dealer....
B002J854UC|5|Goes on smooth, with a hint of bananna.  Comes off clean and ultra shiny!  None better.
B000AAJSOE|1|Item does no work. The pump is not strong enough to create the suction to extract the fluid out of any type of container or oil pan. I wasted my money on this item.
B0042Z0E6E|5|Excellent product ,super fast delivery
B00LLLAKTS|3|Works pretty well. The magneto on mine was busted from the start so I soldered it and ran it a while longer before I had to order a new one. If tinkering is not your thing then this product is not for you.
B000BZI5II|1|I am done with Bosch front and rear blades. They always leave film, rarely fit perfectly, and don't offer much in the way of durability. Takes a pretty shoddy product to move me to bash it online, too. Frustrating.
B000KL32YU|5|Having used yet. I bought two of them. But know we are going to love it I hope. We seen some other campers with one and we decided we wanted to try it out. So I will up date when we go camping. We took it out of the box and stretch it out and it was 25 ft like it says on the package.
B004BC5EQ8|5|worked
B00418U0AM|5|Mickey fit perfect on my car, it goes along great with my disney themed car. and it was the perfect size and easy to apply.
B000P4UC90|5|What can you say about items like this? It fit like it should , and works it you have the skills to do it yourself this is a good part.
B00A4G2D46|1|Color was not a match and after trying to contact the manufacturer they said they would get back to me...that was several months ago. Don't waste your money.
B000IX3P06|5|Good fit for a replacement part. Quick service, reasonable price.
B004K3NW4E|5|The strut was easy to install on my 2009 JK, and works well.  The only problem I ran into was twisting the head off of one of the Tec screws used to hold the mounting brackets on.  Don't tighten them beyond firm.  The tailgate opens automatically when unlatched, and stays open until pushed closed.  The price is very reasonable.  One has to wonder why Jeep can't manage to install these at the factory.  C'mon guys, add $100 to the price to cover the strut.  Buyers will appreciate having the strut, and won't notice the minor cost increase.    The rear speaker needs to be removed in order to drill the holes for the mounting bracket.  This is simple, just three plastic bolts and an electrical plug.  I left the speaker out to gain more room in the back, and can't tell the difference in the sound quality from the stereo.  But then, I don't listen to music containing strong bass.
B008ZDYLC2|3|This is ok but the software doesn't work with my pc. I have windows 7 and it just doesn't work. I took a chance on this unit thinking it would interface with my pc but it doesn't. The only thing it does is read codes and clear codes. Way to expensive for what I get out of it. I wouldn't buy one again if I had it to do over.
B003WM09WW|3|These look good if you are looking to black out your lights, but one of them lets water in...when inspected closely, the mould for the clear lense is very crappy on one side, which is the cause of this problem.
B000CMJC3M|5|This headlight covers are awesome! I put this on my black 2000 Grand Prix with ease and it really gives it the blacked out look I am going for. Awesome product!
B006R34PB4|5|Very bright.  I used them to replace the malibu side walk lights.  Nice wight light and hopefully they will last longer
B003BQ70OE|5|Good prices
B0035YGLZG|1|Very excited to receive and seemed very simple to set up.  However after I hooked it up and flipped the switch to auto it just turned on.  Figured I must of done something wrong so took it apart and put back together exactly as the directions indicated.  Same result. No matter which position I out it in, besides off it just ran constantly.  After messing with it far too long I gave up and wrote the company.  To their credit they did get back to me very quickly but the advice given was a wee bit funny to me.  I was instructed to smack the side  of the box with a screw driver.  Maybe there was some solder splatter.  To my surprise it worked!! but only for a bit.  Now it randomly works when it wants to just turning on whenever it seems to please itself.  Concept is good but for the the money really should be fault free.  It will be returned.
B0040NINKC|5|At first I was skeptical to see these lug nuts so cheap, and although there were no reviews for this item I decided to give it a shot and I'm glad I did. They showed up about three days after I ordered them and each lug nut was individually wrapped and in perfect condition. The socket was also included. You CANNOT beat this price anywhere on the internet! Most places sell this set for around $90 and I paid $32 including shipping. To clarify, this set comes with 20 black lug nuts and 1 spline drive socket. My only complaint is that they didn't have them in any other colors.
B008B5X5GC|5|These worked great with my tire pressure system on my Suburban! 3rd one I purchased. Come in GM packaging while paying HALF dealer price!
B00BSK7Z86|4|I find this light to be very useful for my volunteer security job. Cheap and reliable. You cannot leave it on your roof though and go over 70mph. It will fall off. But other than that, I love it. Have had no problems whatsoever.
B0002STSTE|4|Works like stated but does not fit my snap-on sockets.  They are to thick.  Not even impact sockets, just made to thick and strong, Fits my Craftsman and John Deere sockets though.
B002HK2892|4|was as expected
B00B9FEW9U|5|Swapping the circuit boards was easy and there were no issues with fit.  I am so glad I found these.
B000CFQAFM|5|Its afe, enough said. I have a few afe products on this truck and in the past. It already had another brand intake on it when I bought it and ive had afe in the past and thought the current intake was lacking.put the new afe on and bam, felt a huge difference. Good quality and good fit, great gains.
B000M8IF1Q|5|Another Very well made product from CRC.<br />The CRC 5351 Brake Caliper Synthetic Grease dose the job it is made for.
B0074FUGGW|5|excellent jacket. love it.
B003L35936|5|very good
B000CITKCE|5|works great!
B002R8C178|3|Did not fit my BMW X5, the straps don't go under the seat. so it's hard to improvise on the fit. nice quality other than that.
B000G76PLA|5|Worked as it should
B00IOWINKU|5|Works great!
B001EAQTRI|5|I use this to connect a laptop to Yamaha THR5 amp. Had alot of ground loop noise before and with the PAC unit +90% of the noise is removed. It does a great job at a great price.
B0077D82OO|5|excellent item. fast shipping and they fit great. even got a personal phone call to from BORA to ensure i was getting what i wanted. will buy from again!
B000GU7I72|5|This  item fit perfectly over my 99 Honda Valkyrie which is fitted with windshield & saddle bags & is doing a great vjob protecting my bike from the elements.
B006E3SJZA|5|These are super bright leds I would recommend these lights to anyone o and the are a great value. A+
B000FQBWCY|5|My apologies for a &#34;late&#34; review.  I received the charger long before the expected delivery date which was great!  Charger is working well and it is very reliable.  It has cured my problem of having to let a vehicle sit for long periods of time without using it.
B000PAM9KO|5|Great product. Low price. Fast shipping. Can't ask for more than that. Thanks
B00JN64MF6|1|crappy, broke apart as soon as they were installed and pricey
B00BJFC9Z4|5|I use it for long distance rides on my motorcycle.  Filling it with half ice and half water works really well!
B008CFAVYA|4|Very nice!!
B0002JN2EU|5|I'm not sure if these even works, but i purchased this for my Toro Personal Pace lawn mower as I had some black exhaust on start up every once in a while, using this for about 10 lawn mows, i've not had the black smoke on start up.  can't tell you it's really doing anything, but it doesn't seem like it's hurting anything.
B005SWMU2Q|5|looks good
B001YIYANK|1|These are PLASTIC bolts. After having them in for 3 weeks I have already lost some and the vibration makes rattling sounds.<br /><br />Avoid this product.
B005FN207I|2|The front seat covers fit pretty good, but the back was impossible, I had to cut and sew areas to make it fit and it is still very sloppy and does not work with integrated seat belt for middle seat. Loops broke and I had a zipper break.
B000C2SKBM|5|I'm very happy with my new timing belt
B00342B4II|5|This was purchased for my 2013 Camaro 1LE.  It was fairly easy to install and works as expected.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend K&N.
B002P8TDAI|1|these mounts dont fit! even after stretching out a bit ,the screw would not go thru! its not good for chevy  impala!
B00US4JX4M|5|Perfect, in every way!
B000CN4XWQ|1|Unfortunately, my Derale 16738 also had a bad sensor as posted by other reviewers here.  To verify the failure of the radiator sensor, I bought a Derale 16720 and left everything hooked up, then hooked up my wiring only to the new sensor (which threads into the bleeder hole NPT threads in the water neck on my 1976 Ford E-250 Van with 351 Windsor Engine).  Fan worked just fine with the new sensor from the Derale 16720 kit and wiring left over from the 16738.<br /><br />I also confirmed both relays (which are the same in both kits) work perfectly.<br /><br />I would like to have returned my Derale kit to Amazon, but I was 580 miles away from home when the failure was confirmed.  Luckily I watched my temperature gauge carefully during the long journey.  Instead, I will keep both and use the spare relay to keep in my glovebox.<br /><br />Sorry but I cannot recommend the 16738 kit, due to what appears to be a systemic issue with their radiator temp sensors.
B00BQS6UA4|3|Same fit and finish as the factory factory uni; at less than HALF the OEM / dealer price.<br />Just don't forget to buy the rubber O-ring, which does not comes with this unit.
B001DCF6E4|5|My '05 Scion tC's lift gate supports started to fail in 2009 , and I let them go until I could barely manage to get the back open anymore. The lift gate handle broke off shortly after, and I wasn't even been able to get the back open for more than a year. When I found these StrongArms, I wasn't sure they'd work on my model, but they were so inexpensive I decided it was worth giving them a shot. They got here quickly, and once I finally got the back of the car open, I was able to install them easily in just a few minutes with a small flathead to pop the clips (you'll understand when you see them). Now the lift gate launches open with enough force to rock the car in a truly awesome way. I love my car again, and I have these to thank for it.
B000C5E3CE|5|Installed brake pedal pad as soon as I got it and fits perfect and looks original. Could have bought at a local parts house for same price but was placing an order with Amazon anyway.
B006G2JPJ8|4|This part really helped me out the only thing I didn't like was it was not the same color as my car when it arrived but no complaints so far
B00393NDHW|3|look great but don't last long
B008RZXWNM|5|Was easy install and seems reliable. Had it now for two months and never had any problems. Haven't bought gas in three months.
B007RINCE4|5|Theses are better than the ones that came with my frame. They are a good size andalready Assemblies.
B00SLYYJKY|5|Perfect fit
B00WH24LEU|4|it is what it is and does what its supposed to do  made inchina
B0084UIZNM|5|Great floor mats. Fit my truck perfectly and constructed from a nice material.  Easy to clean and protects my carpet from everything. The laser cut technology allowed the mats to mold to the contour of the floor giving it a seamless look.
B006BDWM4C|5|Worked like it should at a fraction of the cost from the dealership
B0054YGIZS|5|I have had these stickers on my Truck and Gator for more than a year and they are still in tact after many car washes and extreme weather. I think that proper cleaning and care in putting them on the glass is the key. Lots of compliments on these.
B00HUXMGWK|4|Matched my vehicle perfectly. Needed to cover gravel ding.
B00M3NEBMK|5|Friendly Swedes offer  great stuff.  This balaclava fits perfectly.  It's a great underlayment for any weather or activity.
B000EQR6FM|5|Perfect fit great deal
B005N53AM2|2|Yup, I agree, it smells funny.  I've had it for about six weeks, and it still smells.  Otherwise , I really like it!
B002UZGCNC|5|This was a direct replacement for the filter on my 2003 BMW 325i. It was OEM quality.
B0012ATAZI|5|Really easy to install. Nearly tool free. Works great for 20 minutes worth of work
B00DOGJQYI|5|fit perfect,ford explorer 2003,i recomended for everyone need it,no problem for instalation,very easy.,very good for my car and soun dperfect with a new speaker
B000FW2MWW|5|The cable was a more heavy duty cable than i expected; i am pleased with the product. as has been the case in all my orders so far; the shipment was early.
B009NLMXNO|5|needed for light bar instulation
B00KCSA3LG|5|Great product ...able to demonstrate on my car  my support for the greatest &#34; rocker&#34; ever...thanks
B002H8FYTU|2|Sloppy cut job. I won't be using them again.
B008OAMLI2|5|I love it! It came on time. I wanted it for my scrapbook. It's such a cute sticker. I was very pleased with it.
B007UOYK9Q|5|Good quality, just wish I had ordered more.
B0036RFLR6|4|tough to figure out to connect it,but got it going works great
B00B1U6I54|3|I could not install this on my car because there is a welded hangar in the way so the unit cannot be screwed on as it hits the hangar as it spins around. The little short piece fit on though and has by itself stopped my CEL from coming on as it has moved the sensor far enough so it is clear. So even though the main unit did not work the little extension that came with it was enough to do the trick.
B00PUOQRK8|5|This works perfectly. I still have not washed it yet.
B001DX9E8W|5|Good Product
B0096J7VAI|5|While I wish I could find a higher-output T15 in red, this is more than acceptable for my 1997 F-150's high mount brake lamp.
B00029K20C|4|good product for a temporary fix.
B0068OCPKA|5|Sprocket works fine on my new Kawasaki ninja 300 the first gear is much longer now don't have to shift right to second gear two meters out of the gate.
B00IAHGJR8|5|Love the sound.1 hour to install, fit perfect
B0013Y3LQM|5|Awesome windshield great quality
B001PW9ZUI|5|I just got another used truck and this had to go on it. Works like a charm. No more slamming down the tailgate! Very easy to install and is a must in my book. Many newer trucks come with this now, but if yours doesn't, this works.
B00HHGRWWE|1|Here's my edited review.  After so much frustration with a shimmy in the rear of my vehicle I bought these replacement bearings, installed them but the problem still existed. Thinking it could only be the tires at this point I replaced all 4.  Problem still existed so at Discount tires suggestion I replaced the 2 rear rims. After months of frustration it turns out one of these bearings is bad.  For warranty they require a deposit and you eat return shipping. If Detroit Axle determines you damaged it by abuse you pay for the replacement too. At this point I'm not sure I trust that process so I'm buying a quality Moog replacement instead. Cheap part ended up costing me a fortune!<br /><br />Original Review: &#34;Wow I shopped everywhere and could only find 1 of these for the price of 2 you get from Detroit Axle.  They arrived quickly and were a perfect fit for my 1999 Dodge Grand Caravan.  Easy to install with just a few tools. I was impressed with the quality too.&#34;
B0085XV9JA|2|Well Made the best I can say about it but its the size to hold two tewlve ounce cups of soda its definately not even remotely useful for my purpose.
B0009YDQE4|5|Impressive quality for the price. Much better than going to the local auto parts store and paying 3x more for junk ones.
B007ED84XG|4|Gives my car some girly personality!  Keeps my car very cool in the hot summer sun, but the pink faded quickly.
B007TY2UFS|4|Was replacement mirror for a 1994 Toyota pickup.  Was very easy to replace.  Took about 5 minutes. looks almost identical to previous mirror.  Only difference is that finish is a bit shinier but that may be because the new mirror was not 21 years old.
B000TE46SY|5|Everything about this order was OK. The seller send it in time, the product is OK (for the money I paid for it and because I need it like hobby not for professional use) so ... only the USPS come a little late ... for bad weather in Dallas Airport. Recommend the seller and the product. Thanks.
B007PRTVUG|5|very pleased
B006N92WCQ|5|Same as OEM , good price, But UPS destroyed box, part was hanging out and hardware lost. good thing it was 1 inch dia steel
B000N9XF2I|1|This is NOT a spark wire \\"SET\\" !  It is only one single wire.  Please do not be fooled by the false advertisement of this product.
B005BWI9SC|5|A perfect fit. Better than the original.
B004SCYMWI|5|Replaced the original belt tensioner on our 2003 Mitsubishi Montero fine with no problems.  What more can I say but had to add more words to my review.
B002C9D9IW|1|The seller was great, got them in no time, was packaged great as well.  Sadly, the bulbs, i installed, and i went to work that day, got off that night. i literally couldnt see, i had to stop at advance and switch them back. also, 1 bulb was more yellow than the other.    Nothing against the seller, but i got what i paid for, quality/lighting wise
B000C6KM8W|5|Top notch filter, well made. fits like OEM. Good deal vs even local parts stores.Much better construction vs fram filters
B00LMHUZ50|2|Great value over dealer price. However had mine cut and programmed at the ford dealer. Remote start will not work on the fob but lock unlock and  panic do work so far. Key will start vehicle.
B008BR6UKI|5|Fit my 2011 versa perfectly.
B00AQKC7LO|5|Very Very bright  could use a dimmer.
B009KUEWJQ|3|if your wife doesnt know how to put her hub cap on correctly and loses it, this will solve the situation. i paid about 80 bucks for this thing and it covers the wheel so you car doesnt look like s*** missing a wheel cover.
B002YQ6HZ0|1|Decided not to buy, no nephews of mine will be caught dead on a scooter
B00COYNZJ8|5|Bought as a gift for my husband, he absolutely loves it! Works perfectly, he gets so many who stop and ask where he got it! An absolute must for any Star Wars fan who has a car or truck!
B000WJA5ZY|5|just as ordered thanks wish it would of had the ram ball end for the mount but they are cheap enough to order, I got them cheapest from West Marine
B005G9CN3C|5|These installed easily and are very bright.  We have some comparison pictures but they didn't turn out well, once we get some good ones I will post them.  Shipping was fast
B0080JCOCA|1|very fake emblem.  Don't buy this if you want quality.  It looks like a scan and print of a gold emblem and the ink has a lot of green in it.
B0001MQ7CW|5|Takes a minute to heat but works great
B002R0O6Z6|5|Excellent fits perfectly, better than the original, will purchase from this company in future.<br />Very satisfied with the product , and it came quickly
B00DDUWB7E|5|Was everything I needed and wanted it to be ! Fits my C6 '12 very well ! Love the rubber mat , hold groceries in place and even those unexpected spills :-/ !
B0016I7ZLM|5|Perfect fit.
B00T6PKK7I|5|I received mine via the kickstarter campaign. It's an elegant product. Well designed and simple to understand.<br />I look forward to the next product from PLX.
B00JR4D70K|5|Great product for automotive repair
B001FH5QQA|5|190 degree, not 180. Great thermostat, BUT it is a 190 degree F thermostat not 180 degree as described. It is, in fact, stamped 88 C and you can do the conversion. The Stant box is labeled 190, but the 9 looks very much like an 8, and the distributor mislabeled them with a 180 sticker. I knew what I was ordering because I went to the Stant website before ordering. My Volvo 940 actually came from the factory with a 190 or 195 degree thermostat, and 180 is an alternate. No wonder someone said their heater works better after replacement, since someone probably installed a 180 at some point.
B001U8QS9I|5|Quick delivery! They don't stay in place, as there is no strap for the crease, where the seat folds, moves when you get in or out of car
B009XOZD74|5|I got four different masks (two of these) for a family for Christmas as a sort of gag gift. They all seem to really enjoy them.. Especially here in the midwest! BRR!!
B000IYY4C8|1|parts  did  not  fit  my  car and  according  to  the page on amazon  to  make sure  it  fitted  thw car  it  was  the part  but  they  did not  fitted  .
B0083G3AXC|4|It is plastic and doesn't look like it would hold well, but it works well. Taking it off is not as easy as putting it on,  but you get the hang of it pretty quick.
B00INA090U|3|I was very impressed with my visor because I have trouble seeing when the Sun is really bright I am a senior and I find this to be very useful to me and I would definitely tell my friends about it so that they can purchase this as well thank you so much has been pleased with everything I received from you guys and definitely will pass it on I am so glad that I am a member Amazon
B0024NSLMA|5|great buy , easy fix
B009KUFCL8|5|They fit real nice under my tonue coverand the dont interfear with the 5th wheel hitch. i can leave them in when i tow my camper.
B000RFUYQI|1|Lasted maybe 2 hours of total hammering over the course of a month, head broke clean off while hammering straight. Don't believe there's any sort of warranty which stinks cause it was relatively expensive for what I got.
B00IXBM1NC|5|My car runs great and economy too.
B004A54O1W|5|These are the exact same thing that came on the car when it was new. I'm hopeful that they do not warp but time will tell. So far so good.<br /><br />RM
B002DZJQ0A|3|Came very quickly! For some reason they sent me 2 strips and then a few days later 2 strips. If you need 4 strips this could be problematic, but I only needed 2 strips.
B0051MYL8E|5|Great value for the money<br />Would buy again<br />Washes in washing machine with no problems<br />Must try<br />You<br />will not<br />regret
B000C59NC4|5|concidering my struts were gone , these have made a great difference, was told their are better struts, i,m satisfied
B00HS14CE4|5|Nice product it's amazing for my honda element it's best of oem product
B006G3SS8Q|5|Exact replacement at a fraction of what Volvo wanted for this part and forget what they wanted for the installation fee - they're crazy. It was very easy to install, took 10 minutes.<br />Simply knock out the locking pins that hold the old hinge and door on to the car with a small punch.<br />Remove the fuel door from the broken door hinge and clip the fuel door to the new hinge.<br />Line up the mounting holes on the car with the hinge nubs, insert and push the pins in to lock the hinge to the car.<br />Clip the spring back on and your done. Simple and saved $$$$$$$$$$.<br /><br />-v-
B0002Z2MZ4|5|I've been cleaning/detailing my own vehicles since the mid-70's. I've tried almost every product known to man. Every gimmick product. Every 'better than sliced bread' product.<br /><br />Then I got a bottle of Cockpit. I'm super impressed with the shine free finish. Plus I don't have to worry about nav or audio screens.<br /><br />My only quibble is the smell. It could be a bit more 'citrusy' for my tastes, but thats just me.
B000EH0ORI|4|Very nice and useable could be longer. Had to attach a short hose to the end of it.
B00D8DR0AO|5|LOVE IT! I like how I don't have to use so much water and it works well! You don't even need a lot so this bottle will last awhile!
B00LFIJ4DK|5|nice , locks great on my black hood, everything is good quality, make sure u check the trunk and hood size, some bmw the hood and trunk are same size ,this is the set for the different size of hood and trunk... hope it help...
B0067EX5OQ|5|Much smoother on the top end. There is a slight loss on the bottom end but its negligible. Well worth the purchase.
B00BVB5V0Q|5|Good switch for he price. easy to install.
B00068AJPM|4|Great car wash soap
B0088BX0IM|5|Nothing to complain about.  Real easy to install.  I would recommend this product to a fellow rider.  Glad I ordered this!!
B00FBKS8ZI|1|Having problems with ballast
B004HPSI6M|1|USB cable was NG
B009LN7PT6|5|Part fits perfect works as suspose to,very fast shipping would from this supplier again!!
B001EOV46K|5|Good, snug fit.
B0087XOTWW|3|Its ok but i think they are rather cheap. They flick when my dome light circuit is cold. not sure if its because of the product of if i need to add some resistance to my circuit.
B00FRHOLK6|4|I hear that it works great!
B00823J9NG|5|I bought three of these for different bikes and their disc locks.  These work just as well and are of the same quality as the $8 ones but half the price.  What else can you really say about a lock reminder cable.
B0013T7OL0|4|The cushions look very stylish in our car! Comfortable,also as we have cloth seats in our vehicle it was difficult to exit the car, with the lumbar support cushions in place the problem has been solved. Just stitching on one cushion was not sewn properly but was a minor problem.
B005G6J3EM|4|It's so beautiful, it looks good, I for Mac.<br />For me 11 inches, just missing a little bit of needle eye (only 4 mm).<br />Great quality, with cheap sticker is very thin and can be easily peeled off.<br />: Thumbs up!
B001RLTZC0|5|Installed, used for couple of thousends miles already, no issues at all, better engine starts, MPG seems to be the same, overall happy .
B0009IK61G|5|On a motorhome trip from Georgia to Alaska, I found it difficult to find replacement wiper blades for the older style wiper arms on our rig. We were unable to find wiper blades anywhere besides RV specialty stores at a premiim price.  With these adapters I can grab a new wiper blade at almost any WalMart or parts store without paying too much.
B0039ILD42|1|The size wasn't close to the right size for my 2008 Honda Accord. Local shops matched the size no problem.
B009JXVKOO|5|I e-mailed the company from the UK to make sure this would be compatible with my application. They were really quick to respond, and based on this I placed the order.<br /><br />The parts turned up really quickly, shipping was not to back either, given that they were sent to the UK.<br /><br />The part 100% does the trick on my 2004 Dodge Ram 1500. HID's work faultlessly, there is no flicker, and the lamp-out light is no longer illuminated on the dashboard.<br /><br />Top marks go to this company, they make for a really easy transaction.
B0034RZHHM|1|It's just the same as the chrome on I bought that fell apart after two weeks, just different packaging. Made in China, no further explanation needed.
B0034ZHTPC|5|My son wanted this for his old chevy when he turned 16.  Seems good quality.  Just about the right size.
B002AMAXNA|5|Haven't needed to use it yet, but it seems well built to do the job
B0050BK1G2|5|This is fantastic for vehicle windows!!! Although I did not order with rain repellant I am satisfied with the product and results.
B009EA8QAI|4|Perfect oem fit, they also look great on the truck they'll help a lot when towing. Although they do have some vibration in the mirrors it's not bad at all
B00B8X1YG2|3|For the price this is a decent jerry can.  The breather screw is bound to get lost and render this can far less useful but the included nozzle is nice and the can itself is nice and sturdy.
B00OZX6LII|2|Not a precise fit. Quality cheap, gaps on install no way to get around it.
B000EVYGV4|5|Ok tutto perfetto
B000CRI3YG|4|So far we've only put this to use on a very thin layer of ice, the kind thats resistant to wiper blades.    When held at the proper angle this tool was up to the task and removed it cleanly unlike some cheaper tools that may remove it in fine streaks.  I have little doubt that it will be useful for thicker ice and snow.    Wish I had one of these when we lived on the east coast.  We very rarely get thick windshield ice here in NE Wyoming.
B00G4SSGU8|5|Effective, comfortable, durable, cheap, and you get 2 for one.  This is the seat belt pad to buy.
B000TMMD86|5|i didnt want to get the rear mats but i am glad i did. u never knwo when u need it. its nice to have solid protection.
B00267PZUK|5|this tool is worth every penny of the price, it worked perfectly and quickly.<br />when I broke three plugs on my 06 f150 I was freaking out, I didn't know what I was going to do, then I found this tool online<br />the first plug I removed with this tool was a little unsettling with all the crunching sounds but it came right out.<br />the next two went alot quicker with more confidence.<br />just take the advice of other reviewers and use plenty of oil and anti sease
B0011NMM2Y|5|A definite need/back-up when working with the headlight assemblies
B009AA2FAY|5|I was able to install both front sensors in under a half hour in my 2005 Chevy Avalanche. I started the truck and the airbag light turned off instantly. Easiest DIY project that I've had in a long time.
B00CCZ14JW|4|Great shield at an affordable price, rocks might chip the tint, oh-well... Nothing's perfect! But I would totally get a different color, in addition to the gold color I got.
B001NZQIDE|5|I used this adapter to wire a Tekonsha Prodigy in our 2014 Explorer Sport.  Simply plug and play installation, and it works as it should.
B001684X76|4|Porsche recommends this if you are not driving at least 5-6000 miles per year.  If car sits 4-6 days often it is a must.<br /><br />This was half the price of Porsche dealer price.  Works great
B002NS8Z2C|5|Don't waste your time and money buying the cheap knock off ones! These are worth every penny.
B00DCG6ZO4|5|Gorgeous and well-made leather keychain.  Thank you!
B000WOZSGK|5|Worked as they said
B0012WHBSO|5|great product!! i have used it on my 16 in. tires and it has worked as intended. would recommend this product.
B0009H51LC|5|perfect and fits jeep xj 98
B004OSZ2X4|5|Good quality starter fast shiping
B000FRLO9Y|5|Worked great as I was able to de-sulfate the battery in my Lincoln. After doing that the battery lasted me antill I thought it went bad again but it was actually the starter that caused the slow cranking. Also used it to revive an Optima battery I thought was dead. Also charges my batteries faster than the smaller battery tender that I had before this unit. Def would recommend this unit iver a battery tender as it has more uses.
B003IS3HV0|4|I needed this stuff to refinish a pair of my cole haan shoes.  Worked great.  It is a lot though.  The bottle has enough to do 100 pairs of shoes, so I guess I'll have this stuff forever.
B004TBQXX4|5|Nice touch for Caddy. No more dripping
B0028095GA|5|98 Honda Accord fit great, easy install.
B0002U2V1Y|5|I'm one of those crazy people that love to clay bar their car, it works well and there's plenty for several car cleaning days.
B00AO6HU9O|5|Very comfortable helment.  It has an excellent finish.  The extra large helmet fit my extra large head perfectly.
B0041U8ZU2|5|fit great
B005KLGYTU|1|No instructions or mounting hardware were  with the shipment. So far not real impressed. Three wires not labeled as to, which wire goes to where.
B009E9LOEE|5|Work great easy to program
B00E1XZ20K|5|I love these. They are just enough pink to be girly and enough black to keep the dirt off of the actual floor. I am pleased with this buy.
B004VRJTMI|5|I love these things! They are small ( just toss them in the car) nothing dangling from the mirror, and the last for weeks. lots of fragrance choices
B00EDPY4GY|5|I installed these bulb in my 2013 Camaro 2SS/RS replacing the original OEM DRL bulbs. The quality of this light is much whiter and brighter than the original bulbs and is a closer match to the halos and headlight color temperature.  The installation was 5 minutes. There are three torx T15 screws in each fender well. Turn the wheels to the opposite side of the car, remove the three screws, pull back the plastic fender liner, grab the bulb in the housing and rotate counter clockwise and the bulb comes out. Press the tab on the plug that goes into the back of the bulb and pull it out of the socket. Installation is the reverse. Very simple and very fast.
B007AEI3O4|5|I could not get the unit to operate initially until I connected it straight to the battery. I cycled the unit several times prior to installing it into the door and it seemed to be working alright. The next day the regulator got stuck in the fully open position and the motor solenoid was extremely hot. I hope that I just got a bad unit and will ask for a replacement Update - I received the replacement 2 days after making the request and the new unit operates beautifully. It cam with the window carriage mid-position in the well lubricated track versus the first one that was all the way at the end with no grease. I was extremely grateful that they sent the replacement without requiring me to send them the old unit first. I changed my rating to 5-stars based on my satisfaction with the operation of the replacement and the prompt and courteous customer service I received :)
B00DNLJC8E|5|Slingshot Racing gave me good customer service and the product I bought was very good. Buy it for your Ducati !!!!!!!!!
B005H12H8A|5|worked great!!
B0047RV8WG|5|I bought these and other sizes to replace the hot bulbs in my RV to use less battery power and create less heat.  I did read that some people thought these where a purple color or didn't shin the same color consistently.  I bought 18 or so of a variety of output and yes they look slightly purple but that's what LED bulbs look like.  I also didn't notice any real color or shade differences even with different output of bulbs.  They are more expensive that incandescent bulbs but the use almost no energy and very little heat.  I would recommend them in RV use or whatever project that you may have.
B0041G3G32|5|Great ! Easy to install ! Ever since I put it on it has been so much easier to get into the back of my truck. This is better than the newer trucks that have the bed step built into the tail gate because the plastic they use over a short period of time the plastic breaks off. This step is very heavy duty
B004RCOUP8|4|Works well and does what it's supposed to.
B00GJKPR7Q|5|Good stuff
B0002NIKUW|2|I bought the key ring for a Betty Boop fan, but when it came, I changed my mind on giving it. The metal ring itself was extremely tarnished and even though I know I had just purchased it, it looks too old and used to give as a gift. One day, maybe i'll use it myself. I give it 2 stars because Betty herself is fine, but it's purposeless and just another item in my junk drawer until i decide to use it. Not really worth the gas money and time to return it.
B005V0EYRE|1|The picture shown indicates the connectors that are needed.  The battery received has a different red connector which does match nor fit.  The battery cannot be returned so I am therefore at a loss.  I purchased this battery 2 years ago and received the picture shown.  Not this time!
B000H7XJKO|5|Purolator Pure-One oil filters are the best. Bosch owns the brand and is a well respected name in the industry. The new textured surface is a great feature which allows for easy tightening and removal of the filter.
B007HROIRU|5|This item replaced my 20 yr old one on my Charbroil Master 2 Grill, Model 150-03. The old one simply broke after years of service. Initially I was afraid to purchase this sole item because on the grill itself stating to replace the hoses & the regulator along with the propane connector. I went to the local Home Depot & their rep said that I need to replace everything to avoid a fire. That meant trashing the grill & buy a new own altogether.<br /><br />Well this worked just fine. I just followed the instructions. I do intend on buying a new BBQ grill but in the meantime I still will use the tried & true Charbroil grill
B000JSPC42|2|Wrong information about this product fitting my car was posted on website. It was meant for old model Honda and I have a Lexus SUV.<br />No problems with the exchange, received free postage to send it back and I was credited for the item, so that was good.<br />It was just a hassle. Put up the correct info already!
B005SEK9IQ|5|Very nice oil and great price. I will be ordering it again. I got better mileage then with mobile one.
B002MEP0I4|5|Had the pleasure of replacing this mirror on my 2012 Silverado 2500 HD due to personal stupidity.  As noted in other reviews, there are no instructions, but many good videos on YouTube made this a 20 minute project.  The clips that hold the wires to the door frame were a bit misplaced, but i snipped the ziptie and moved them down 1/4&#34;.  Fit fine after that.  This was an easy project, very inexpensive compared to OEM parts ($500), and the part worked great.  The servos were smooth, the blinker worked, and the heating element worked fine.  I have been driving highway speeds for over a week and have no noticed any vibration at all.  This is a fantastic buy and an easy project with a little help from youtube.  I would highly recommend some non-marring plastic tools to help remove the door panel.
B000ET9SAA|2|it does what its suppose to but i just don't like it, the last time i used this type of stuff it was alot better as far as the plugs
B000BEXWVY|5|Great product.
B002IYJUES|5|Fit in the car nicely
B00E1SKMQY|5|Factory quality replacement, nothing fancy,.  Replaced some old rusty replacement rotors, these are definitely better quality.  Plus for the price you get ceramic pads too.  Paid about half for them here when I priced other sites, and that's a whole lot less than the local shop would charge.
B0026J0XGO|5|Perfect fit
B00BV6ERME|5|excellent
B00D9BFR8M|2|ok for what I payed
B004DRVJRO|5|The new headlight assembles enabled me to see much much better at night than before. They are very simple and easy to install; only took me about 8 m
B00877DBKY|5|Fit right on my bike
B001PS8K4Y|5|I hike the A.T. year round and tis cup has been a staple in my pack for years. I highly recommend it to prevent burned lips and campfire ash from getting in your drink.
B002MY8GT4|5|This product did not disappoint.  Clips in the back to secure, elastic covers mower completely, even with handle folded down.  Flexible nylon, and water proof.  Definitely recommend this one.
B0013LEREU|5|Installation went well. Motorcycle performance is noticeably better. Great product.
B003PA07DC|4|Well priced replacement strap. As a used car dealer, it's amazing how many of these we have to replace.
B00MZWQMTO|5|Outstanding product. As described.
B004Q7D3AM|5|Im going to keep this quick.  I have installed and used Warn, Superwinch and Mile Markers.  I have seen the Mile Markers fail a few times on the trail.  I have never seen a Superwinch or Warn fail out on the trail.  I have had a lot of Warn owners give me shit over owning a superwinch because it was made in China.  If you want a very good winch you will not go wrong with a Warn or a Superwinch.  If you are the kind of guy that has to own only American like Warn then buy the Warn. If you are the kind of guy that wants a very good product and save money to buy other parts for your jeep then you will not be let down by this superwinch.  I have never had a problem with a superwinch in the 5 years that I have used them.  I have never had a problem with a warn in over 10 years that I have used them.  I would buy the best I can afford with my hard earned money.  They are both very good products and I will continue to buy and use both.
B00HC16AP4|5|Well priced and doesn't scratch the key area.
B00D44TNZ2|5|It worked perfect at half the price!
B006DY67DQ|5|These are great readers! They are easy to carry, even in a shirt pocket.
B000GZLKEO|5|Fast Service. Work good. Like the fact there are set screws to keep in place. Installed on 2015 Rubicon.
B005C1Y9D6|5|We bought a new 2014 Honda Pilot which had the factory yellow interior lights.  This kit comes with all the lights necessary to change out, and dramatically changes the cars appearance.  It gives the car a much more modern feel, and gives of a nice light.
B00HVGG94W|5|Excellent,  just received it and immediately put in my car seat. I have a car with so called &#34;sports seats&#34; which equal to heavily bolstered park benchs. They're not comfortable past 30 minutes, saw these reviews and ordered it. Difference is day and night in comfort! I ordered the larger size for better seat coverage. Only negative is that it adds height to seat so be sure your seat has height adjustment. I highly recommended it!
B000CEZTC8|5|I looked up the Bosch Wipers OEM for my BMW 740 iL and the local Auto Parts Store had them for over $120. I Verified the product OEM Part # and this was the same Bosch product for 1/2 of the price. I have ordered them and the arrived in two days :)<br /><br />I Installed the wipers on my BMW and they fit perfect and look good also. My BMW is looking brand NEW and in the rain they work excellent!  Just ordered another rare item for my BMW and looking forward to making my car like Brand New!<br /><br />Thank You Amazon<br /><br />Mike Siedliski
B0073RYG1W|2|Barely a few months and a light went out. Pretty crappy device at least not durable. It's awesome while used and all working well.
B00KHA14GW|5|This does a good job. I got the 10-15&#34; for my Mossimo alligator 500. It fits perfectly but did have to be fully extended to be long enough between the roll bars. Easy to load and unload both rifles and shotguns. Holds them securely. Very sturdy. Glad I purchased this. Would do it again.
B0017J3XMU|5|I purchased one these antennas when they first came out years ago when I was still living on the east coast and very active on the Ham bands on digital,SSB,SSTV and CW. This antenna worked wonders for me using the automatic antenna tuners and manual tuners in my shack and helped me to work several bands. The great thing I liked about was I never added the additional radials and I always had the match needed to work the 10m band quickly with out worry. Before moving back home to Illinois I made sure to give to a a great friend that would enjoy as much as I did.<br /><br /> Rob aka N1ZW
B000CNB3U6|5|good
B006LO4L6I|4|The batteries are great. Same size/fit as the original batteries, last a long time (my daughter rode her scooter on our 3 mile run up and down hills and still had plenty juice left over).<br /><br />4 stars because it wasn't a simple plug and play type of swap. The connector didn't fit right, I used wire strippers and electrical tape to hard wire directly to the battery, and we were in business. To me still worth the savings, I recommend!
B001R5D66M|5|Arrived quickly and made our 02 Ram look brand new. Just remove the extra plastic tab at the top of the assembly that is not on the OEM assembly and lights fit perfect.
B001G3Q3O2|5|Quick delivery with manufacture quality.
B000CF3W1W|5|It worked great with my Mazda and I did not have any problems with the product. I do recommend this product.
B003XPDUN8|2|Not sure where the custom fit part is.  The bolt pattern and the molded portion of the mud flap didn't fit the truck at all.  I simply took a drill and made it fit.  After adding a few new holes to make it tight, it looks decent enough, just not the \\"custom\\" fit Husky claims.
B001EOV492|5|Just bought a 2002 Ram 1500 a few months ago and needed a ball mount for my &#34;new&#34; truck.  This was perfect.  Easy installation, looks great, very functional!
B000S2SS3Q|5|Fits my 2002 Chevy Avalanche Z66!
B00068XCQU|5|Item as described! cvpnj.com
B0068C1P9Y|5|Excellent quality. Always happy with amazon.
B0058UPPXO|3|it came with a dent in it. but we fixed it.
B000ETPA98|5|What a cute, funny and hilarious emblem. My mom put it on her car and it's been there ever since. This was a definite hit!
B001RUH8ES|5|I don't usually write reviews, but I was so happy with this product, I had to! We have a beige microfiber couch with a ton of stains. I tried the alcohol and brush method several times and it didn't work. I considered hiring someone to clean it, but that was insanely expensive. This stuff did the trick! Completely got rid of stains. It did make the couch a little bit less soft truthfully, but this was well worth it considering I was ready to get rid of the couch if nothing worked. It smells when you are first putting it on, so do it on a day when you can open the windows...I keep going in to look at the couch because I can barely believe how clean it is!!
B001G06FP2|5|First tried this product from a sample packet included in another auto glass cleaning product. Was so impressed with it that I ordered two tubes.  Applied the product beginning May 2012, it's now late August 2012, and rain still beads off.  Great product, particularly since very little product goes such a long way (use it sparingly). When driving at hwy speeds, you virtually don't need windshield wipers. Extremely easy to clean-off bugs, etc. from windshield since using this product. Totally recommend this product.
B005R3SSCM|5|It works as advertised.
B0068FW22U|5|Very fast shipping and great product!!!!
B006G14FK8|5|excellent value
B00BMU98AK|3|These won't stay on and were a waste of money
B009BNFIY0|1|The product itself is what you see.  However when you go next to a curb or in my case a car wash guide rail the extended size of this makes it hit the rail and snap the top of your vavle stem off.  Not only do you end up with a flat needing a new valve stem in my case it destroyed the low air sensor too.  A $120 fix for that mistake.  Be warned!
B000S0KXQ8|5|Nice
B00DULUN0S|5|Love this company's product line. I do a lot of detailing both on motorcycles and a lot of high end vehicles. This bag is my perfect take it and get the job done bag!
B000JZSPBM|5|Works as good as the OEM product at 1/4 of the cost.  Installation is quick and easy.
B004KMKCIO|1|This product is very small. Almost any cup and bottle fits. The plastic quality is bad and it bends with some weight. Just small paper cups fits.
B00N4GZ8NQ|1|Broken in box. Hassle to get money back.
B00BOFTOP2|5|Thank you
B0094JVLWO|5|Good
B001FCAY8U|5|Heavy duty hitch extender.  It can raise or lower the connection point approximately 4 inches.  It came well packaged.  Excellent quality, and made to last.
B00BAZCK6G|5|Sadly they were the wrong bulbs for my fog lights on my car. but quality of them look great. i cant say much about brightness. etc since they dont fit my car.
B00GHRYQFK|5|Fast shipping and replaced broken original lights. Fits just like oem parts
B000NCOKZQ|5|Read about this product and the easy of installation.  Was exactly what I needed to be able to connect various devices.
B0024NSP12|5|I cannot tell you how delighted I am with these headlights - who knew you could find such things on Amazon.  They arrived in ONE day.  Due to time restraints and not believing in struggle  (although I am a  &#34;do it yourself&#34; kinda person quite often). . .  I opted to have my mechanic pop them in,  took about 20 min.  He discovered a melted light socket on my car that required replacement . . so I really  did need his expertise.  Like others have said - -Instant face lift for my 2001 Eclipse Spyder.. . . for the same price it would've been for a temporary &#34;buff&#34;.  Thank you guys !!!!!  (p.s. I live in so. California, which isn't too far from their headquarters, that's why delivery was in record time. )
B00MGFAH6E|5|I really like the helmet, it's very light. I get lots of compliments on it. I use a nylon head piece to wear under it so the helmet fits better. I had a Shoei before this one, but I like this helmet just as much. Taking off the shield is hard as hell at first, but you get use to it.
B001TZBQ0S|5|nice and soft..just what I was looking for'
B003CMIH2Q|5|These are the sweetest accessories for my lil Kia Soul. It makes people do a double take and follow close to read it and then back off a lil fearful. Lol
B007UT9TYW|5|I bought only one set from amazon and realized that I needed to do the bottom pins after I had the door off so I went to Auto Zone and the only pins they had were made of brass for around $10. After putting the ones in from Amazon with no problems what so ever and using a helpful review from Richard W from Ca. I was surprised that the pins from Auto Zone were so cheap and looking at them they seemed like they were good quality...WELL, I was wrong because I didn't even seat the pin in the bushing and the pin snapped like a twig with very little torque. Don't really know if it was a defect but I guess you get what you pay for. SO moral to the story buy these from Amazon and save yourself time and aggravation.
B0002SRJCC|5|Proof that you don't need to spend a lot of money to get what you want
B00HRJRMQC|1|sorry this item is junk.  jell core broke and leaked all over my computer chair and rug.  do not buy.
B004ZF3EAY|5|These HIDs are great! they shine really bright and if you're like me and want a brighter wider range with your headlights these are for you. install was quick and easy. although the book included does seem confusing you can find a video on youtube like I did. one down side is that the brackets provided require you to drill holes so I took a different approach and used double sided adhesive which works good if not better!
B000CSC5MG|4|These are awesome gaskets.  I only wish they included things like new injector o-rings but overall, great product.  Don't buy into GM telling you to use their thicker gaskets.  Those are still plastic.  Use this set.  Well worth the cash.
B00OJOYKEK|5|This is awesome because of its convenience.
B005MF1232|4|Didn't hold up to me hitting a pole but better it than my bumper
B001V8U12M|5|Perfect solution.
B008BRJ5FA|5|Easy to swap out on my 2010 Wrangler
B008JHLHCQ|5|Just as advertised. Easy installation. Fellow Auburn Tigers will be honking at you and gesturing within hours of your applying this handsome frontplate.
B000E6LEIC|1|worked great the 3 times I used it but after a week long trip it refused to recharge so now a great paperweight but very pricy for the 3 times I used it<br />sadly it just out of warrety
B003DUFCGQ|5|I have had this for almost 6 months now and i have no complains about it, i have put it to the test being winched out, being used as a winch point, it has done great for me and looks great, cannot beat the price i payed more for it but well worth it    i had to use a little force to get installed but thats about it
B001N77XIG|4|none
B007MSC0YM|4|So far I am completely satisfied with the solid stainless steel lug nuts. They look and feel just as I expected. I am interested how they will stand up over time especially this winter. Should that be a positive experience then they will get a five star rating.
B00COOQNGU|5|Pretty awesome lights definitely would purchase again and again for my other cars<br />thanks
B001D530FS|4|This was a gift for someone else, but he loves it
B0014B9RYE|1|I saw there was a crack and slight bend in the metal backing plate, but I installed anyway after hammering the bend flat, as I really needed to get my truck through inspection.<br /><br />It failed.  Crack in the surface.  Duh on me.<br /><br />I ended up going to advance and getting their pads, so I wasted my money and time and did the brakes twice.<br /><br />I won't buy brakes mail order again, not worth the savings.<br /><br />These are wagner and should be top notch, and probably would rate 5 stars if I didn't receive damaged items, so yes I'd buy wagner any time, but not from amazon.<br /><br />I give myself 1 star for installing them, knowing they were damaged, but, like I said, I needed to try to get the stupid thing through inspection.
B000FJS1RA|1|Won't fit much of anything today, except maybe an iphone. Does not fit my galaxy s4 frm samsung - probably only fits 4&#34; or less
B0016ZU382|5|I've purchased three sets of these wiper blades now.  They have been long-lasting and do an excellent job cleaning rain and snow from my windshield...better than any others that I've had yet.  They cost a little more than standard wiper blades, but they are more than worth it.  Plus they look great on my Mercedes!
B003172AAW|4|Yes y whil recommande this product . Look god easy to install. The price is ok and the time to receive to.Tank you
B00080QHMM|5|Nice compact gauge
B005FI5BBA|5|There is nothing wrong with this product at all, it looked amazing on my car! I had to return it though because apperently it covers up my state name and it's illegal over here, so before you buy this item just beware that it will cover up some info on the license plate!
B008G2YMEY|5|Quality product and fast delivery.
B003PC1KC2|5|Look awesome on my jeep.  Seem to offer more protection than I had thought they would.
B009DVZ5IY|5|The service was e cellent as always. These chargers are outstanding, we have 4 of them now for our bikes.
B00LLMUPOM|5|Quality parts and fast shipping.
B004XISIK4|5|Great tool for Fatbikers.<br />Way more accurate than using standard bike pump guage.<br />Pressure guage is very good, but it not suitable for taking on rides.<br />Presta slip-on is good and has not started to leak yet, unlike many pump clamp-ons.
B0021GI47M|3|nothing special.
B0063CU6GM|5|If the hood shield even prevents one small windshield crack or saves some of the paint job from the front of the hood it will easily pay for itself. Very easy to install. Highly recommend. Fit the front of my 2012 Civic Ex perfectly.
B0083H4SMI|5|Works great!
B00EIIS9H6|5|Great item fast shipping!!
B00651CLCS|2|Got bad re edition but still worth a shot as I think it is hit or miss because it worked on my friends jeep a lot better than mine.
B004ZF44NA|2|I wasnt going to post but just got an automated email asking me to post my review.<br /><br />1st Set Purchased: the power transformer was bad in one side, found out after one hour of taking off bumper and bolting everything in. I checked the first one i put in, worked, continued with second one, it didnt work. So i swapped the headlamps, and sure enough it worked on other side, was it was the power unit that comes with it.<br /><br />2nd Set Purchased: tried the first side, worked, put the second side in, not working. Found out it was the bulb, as i swapped everything and the bad bulb followed to the other side.<br /><br />3rd Set Purchased: why am i still buying thsi god awful brand? i dont know, but i have the third one now and will update once i put them in.
B004XG3KT0|5|Fricken massive!!
B00062YOKO|5|Quality filters at a competitive price. Filters were shipped in an expeditious manner and were well packed. Meet the need and then some.  Good buy.
B003Y323NC|3|Good display and camera is great as well I've had to reboot the program twice and still did not correct my issue edge is going to send out another one after I pay for another one then they will refund my money for the second one but I'm not sure if it's gonna work yet
B0015RDL7Q|1|Did not fit a 06 Ford Focus ZX5 SES, possibly due to defect.  There's a metal tab on the bottom of the mount that interfaces with the with a little notch in the top of the transmission.  The tab was 180 degrees from where it should have been.  Part returned for refund.  Ordered a different brand from a different website that had a picture where you could see the location of the tab.
B00EYTXHDA|5|This is an excellent replacement for my 1076 bulbs in my Forrest River 5th wheel RV.  No heat and very bright.
B007Q8LVFC|4|So I 5'10 at 225lb. I got the medium because according to the size chart that would work for me, it was right. As soon as I got it I tried it on with a hoody. It was tight in the chest and under the arms. But that was because I still had the lining in. Once I took that out it fit much better. I actually wore it today to ride. I was very stiff. The calor felt kinda sharp when rubbing on my neck. The padding in the forearms make them feel kinda tight too. But that will go away with time I expect. Also the padding on the back is just that, not a hard plastic like the shoulder and elbow pads. I'm thinking to buy a separate harder back piece to replace that. The waist doesn't taper like in the picture. Oh and the velcro where the zippers are on the sleeves will scratch your hands up a lil. Hope it helps.
B00AYKHWWU|5|Sadly, I admit I backed out and hit our garbage cans in 20 below weather resulting in a crack in my bumper. I thought I needed to take it to an auto body shop until I realized it was plastic. I ordered this replacement part through Amazon at a reasonable price and it arrived quicker than expected in the perfect shape and color. My husband and son were able to take the front of my Highlander apart and add this new part within an hour or two. My car looks much better and I was so pleased we could fix it without having to take it to a shop.
B000CB6CMC|5|so far, so good
B001L9VTKE|5|It came just on time and it was perfect, I instantly put it on my car and it hasn't budged since.
B004UQH044|4|The product is well made and the instructions for the installation were well written.  The filter element is huge.<br /><br />I can't quantify any performance increases but I did see a very slight increase in MPG, went from averaging 13.5 to 14.<br /><br />One thing I was not prepared for was the noise.  Under hard acceleration it has a nice, aggressive growl but under certain situations it creates a loud droning (at low RPM if you push the accelerator down to just above where the transmission would down shift).<br /><br />Overall a good product, but be prepared for a little extra noise.
B00429YAA6|1|It started ripping within the first few days I had. Pretty disappointed.
B00HQ0X0WC|4|Works well
B009PL5T7Y|3|Not waterproof. The pinky on left hand gets wet quite easily. Not visible damag on the glove
B007GR8AXO|4|1st one I received was deffective as the collar on one end was not seated correctly but so far I like the new one.
B00BA03MTK|5|The lights look great and fit perfectly. It came with instructions on how its supposed to be wired. You need some basic knowledge on how to do wiring. I thought it was an easy install. It took me about an hr total from tearring down, testing the lights, cutting and crimping the wires and putting the pieces back together.
B0051XHV0I|5|Hard to contor over very curvy pieces, but the look is way better than the cheaper look-a-like stuff, the 3-D texture makes it look real when the sun hits it, and feels like un-polished real carbon fiber. absolutly love it, kind of a satin finish, which its suppose to be. I used our electric stove to heat it as I formed it onto plastic parts for my sport bike.
B00D7HZ6FC|5|This works well.  I recommend purchasing one of these with the kit that allows you to charge four separate batteries. When kit is purchased you must follow the instructions.  You can charge / maintain four similar size & condition batteries.  This is very useful for storing quads, motorcycles and other power equipment over the winter. The pulse charging technology is proven to extend the life of your batteries.  If you want your batteries to be alive come spring time, buy this set up.
B005XEGKPW|3|Very disappointed they don't fold toward the front of the truck like the 6.0 mirrors
B0055LAPQ8|5|Thank u the product works great and the installation was very easy.<br />I will be buying some more lights from u in the future
B004N6NUA4|4|My '05 X3 did not come with any factory fog lights. Recently while replacing the valve cover gasket, I noticed that the fog light wiring harness was pre-installed so on a whim I bought these to see if I could get the fog lights to work. Build is a little flimsy but they fit snugly and lit right up as soon as I had them plugged to the wire harness. There was some weird smell at first that went away after about 5 minutes of continuous use.<br />Do note that they do not come with the mounting screws or the fog light cover trim but the halogen bulbs provided are good with a bright white light in the 4000K range. Also that these will only fit the first generation non-Sport X3 models (2004 - 2007).<br />I have them on for a few months now and for the price, these are excellent alternatives to OEMs if you are on a budget or have a high-mileage car like mine.
B00062YQXE|5|I put this on my Suzuki GS500 when I did a rejet on the carbs from stock, and it is fabulous when used on this bike. Note, it's ONLY for when you move to bigger jets, otherwise you will just lean out the bike, which is already too lean as is from the factory, and it will not be good for the engine. This unit fits neatly over the carb intakes in place of the air box, which I tossed. It helps improve the performance by allowing more air in along with the extra fuel, and it adds a really nice low growl to the exhaust note, especially with an aftermarket exhaust. Go check out the GS500 Wiki for info on the mod. With Amazon's free shipping, this is the best deal you can get on this product. Much easier than the pods to install, and cooler too IMO.
B004L9E5TS|5|Perfect fit. Good looking jacket. Nice pads in shoulders and elbows. Sober look whether u wear casual or sport. I recommend it.
B007MUY7I2|5|Exact replacement for what I needed. New lifts seem stronger than the originals they replaced.
B00CP4UZ8Q|4|very good customer service and the lights work well. Lights are smaller but still get the job done.
B001TWD5KU|5|For the money, a very good product! Cannot believe the light these put out.Good side illumination, as well as down the highway..
B007N6LUBW|3|Don't know why they look used... Don't feel that durable either. It's what i wanted, just wish they looked knew..
B001BJY5N2|3|It works, but it squeals quite a bit.  It's been on the car for about three months now.  The squealing is not so ear piercing anymore (seriously- if anyone was anywhere in a parking lot they would jump sky high when the car started), but it still makes a slightly less terrible sound every time we start up the car.
B005C57IB2|5|I was having troubles with my 07 grizzly 350 it would start bucking when trying to give it throttle. Replaced the sensor and now everything runs as it should
B000UVUAFO|5|Just got item. Arrived quickly. Hoping it lives up to its consumer reports, top scratch remover title. Original box that is was in was smashed up inside the bubble wrap envolope but everything is included and undamaged inside. No need to take a star off for that. Looking forward to using it on my black car..and everyone who has owned one knows the troubles i refer to. Cheers.
B00INCWJI8|5|This is the best penetrating oil on the market.
B000Z0HVHA|5|I've had no problems.  This extension cord feels solid and the end connections make without any problems I've had no issues with power getting interrupted to any of my devices.
B000HEBR3I|1|I bought this thinking all the pumps in this price range were the same.  THEY ARE NOT! The problem with this particular pump is the switch mechanism on the top and the battery compartment.  The switch did not work when I first got the pump, so the company sent me another switch. That worked okay until the battery compartment came completely off of the pump.  I tried to tape it back together, but it did not work.  I had this for about a week before it fell apart on me.      I recently purchased the original terapump and that works fantastic.  The switch on the top of the pump is a push button instead of a on/off switch and definitely better made.  It does not feel cheap like the other pump.
B00CASDZKC|5|Good stuff. It fit on my Honda Odyssey, large seats. The picture does not explain how the protector is being held up at the top. I would expect that the latch is held up by the two metal things that support the headrest.<br />I'm ordering a second set.<br />Also, keep in mind that this is for a pair of car seats, you only need to order one set per car.
B00AFVE4CO|5|I change my air filter evey 6 months on my M3. Each time I pull this filter out I think that it can go for another 6 months for sure. Good quality and fits perfectly.
B000C9GYOA|5|Worked great!
B003Z9T33I|5|Great fit, super easy to put on, stays on solid even at 90 mph, great add on.
B0039KZFSA|5|These floor mats look absolutely perfect in my 2002 E46 330i.  They came clean and with new floor mounts.  It was a great improvement to my interior.
B000FE07AE|3|D'oh... title says it all.<br /><br />It's a beautiful cover, custom cut.  I just wish I had gotten the right one!
B008EMSJQI|5|Excellent quality ! Arrived right on time!
B005LXYKZ2|5|Arrived quickly as always with Amazon.  Install it in about 45 minutes and window is good as new.  It has a good strong motor on it, unlike some I've gotten before that would work but the motor was very weak.
B00RSOLXFM|5|Super effective air purifier for my car. Very pleased with product and service.  Thank you!
B0009JKI6I|4|I ordered one of these and one of premium graphite coated and will see which one lasts longest. I does a good jop with very little streaking. I use rainex liquid on the windshield also, I think it really helps prevent beading...
B0073WEZU4|3|AM reception was poor after replacing the stock antenna with the Stubby.
B0030430KK|4|Works well
B000CQBFF6|4|like Original.
B000C5SGCC|5|Very good fast ship And fit on my Honda Civic
B000630B1Y|5|I have used these air filters for 3-4 years. The initial cost is painful but after that it is cost free and fairly easy to clean the filter. I like the fact that the filter can be used over again.<br />I first bought it because someone said it would improve performance and gas mileage. I did not notice any difference, however. But my car runs well, I can clean the filter anytime I think it needs it and the only cost is the cleaner and filter oil, which are relatively inexpensive. So after about the 3rd filter cleaning verses filter replacement I feel like I am saving money and getting a better product at the same time.<br />I have put these in all of our cars and in my street motorcycle.
B000GU5PGI|5|nice deal
B000IXSF42|4|Very well made product. Easy to install... just be sure that you let it heat up to be able to stretch it!<br />Once it's on, you need large hands to grab it. It will almost double the diameter of the steering wheel. Comfortable for me, but too large for my wife's hands. I was first concerned that it may slip in a panic situation, but no chance of that. It really bonds well to the wheel with it's non-slip interior surface. Since I am the primary driver of this vehicle, I am very satisfied with this cover...it works for me.
B008HY12EO|5|Graffics looked great and quality was good quik service
B0081BYMXG|5|It was exactly what I was expecting.  Thanks<br />My husband is a taz nut and he wanted something to put on his truck this is perfect.
B000C9829A|5|yes viriginia, there are two thermostats on a duramax.
B005947TVU|5|Excellent.....works well
B001GJ9JPQ|1|I bought this because I could not find the great Fire Hose Spray Nozzle that I had bought from Lowe's several years ago, there is no brand name on it either! Rats. This may be the same type, but several things are much lower quality:<br /><br />1. The blue stream adjuster bell is plastic, not rubber. One of the great things I love about this type of nozzle is that when I drop the hose, it hits softly, thus protecting the moving parts inside the nozzle from getting bent. This is a soft plastic as opposed to firm rubber.<br />2. The nozzle I bought from Lowe's has a stream adjusting bell turns about 345° (just less than 1 full turn) and the stream changes evenly throughout the full 345°. The Viking turns about 540° (1.5 turns) and the stream does not change much for 200-250° of that range. This leaves the user spinning around that bell looking for the stream or spray type that may not even be achievable with this nozzle.<br />3. There is no pressure stream, since the 200+° of stream does not restrict enough to create much pressure. The valve only creates a stream with a minimum of pressure. This means that I can only wet things that are within 19 feet, where as with my Lowe's model I can shoot out to 42 feet -- with spray or stream. (Yes, I measured.) 200° is just more than half a turn and most of that stream won’t reach 12 feet.<br />4. The spray ability for the Viking is very limited. There is very little range of spray; either you get medium pressure in a 5-foot circle at 10 feet or you can stream or dribble.<br /><br />My Lowe's &#34;mystery brand&#34; is 5 years old and I am confident that it will last for 20 more years. This Viking just feels like it won't make it to 2015. Anyone giving this cheap thing 4 or 5 stars has no point of reference or is the kind of person who gives 4 or 5 stars to McDonald's. Take it for what it's worth.
B000JFMGPS|4|Got this on a fz6r and it doesn't get in the way and holds enough for my daily needs... Not very comfortable laying down on it though they should have back it backwards wit the rain cover towards the rider so when u tuck in u aren't against the stiff edge but other than that it's great and hold on wit no problems.
B004ZZVO2E|5|Fit well and easy install. Tightens up the steering feel a bit, but it's not a night and day difference. Def worth the cost though!
B00IGQ0BRC|1|Unfortunately, this sensor was not good enough to solve the problem. The car was able to run with it, but it did not allow hard acceleration. As soon as I replace this aftermarket sensor with the OEM Mercedes part the car runs flawlessly. You get what you pay for. Lesson learned.
B00E0NSL54|2|I used this yesterday on my new car, but it didn't do the trick, left film marks everywhere, i had to go over all of my windows<br />with a damp cloth...however i did use it on my MAC desktop & it worked..<br />i'am going to give it 1 more try on my car next week, if it doesn't work then i'll just use it for the computer..<br /><br />David A...
B00HF3I6YM|5|It was just as pictured and fit in where we needed it to fit and got the machine running, and still is:)
B000GTYUUG|5|It was exactly as advertised and worked perfectly. It contained all of the necessary parts. It arrived quicker than expected.
B003YA5DKK|5|Got this lanyard for my daughter because she just got her license and wanted to keep her keys on one. I thought because it was so colorful she wouldn't lose her keys and she always loved the princesses.
B004DRYIKO|5|Fit my Protege5 perfectly. They look great. No complaints.
B003M8A4AI|5|Great product. Just sad that they decided to discontue it. Everytime I find something that works, they take it off the market. I am bying more of these bottles.
B0068FYF20|5|Arrived as expected and worked well
B000CPCQB4|3|Bought this a month or so ago, it turns out its gloss finish,not matte black, and frankly feels like something you picked up from the dollar store. Thought i would break it trying to put it on. Plus it took longer than any other item i purchased to get here so i didn't even want to waste my time returning the damn thing. Just cut my losses and moved on.
B00ABV9QCQ|2|These clips don't keep the door panel from slipping off the frame.  I was hoping that I would be able to use several of these to fix the door panel problem but they didn't help.
B0075JYPNM|1|wouldnt attach to window...waste of money
