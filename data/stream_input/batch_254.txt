B00003CXC7|5.0|One of Hitchcock's favourites of his own films, REAR WINDOW is up there with the master's best, including VERTIGO, NORTH BY NORTHWEST and PSYCHO. James Stewart has one of his best roles here as L.B Jefferies, a photographer who busts up his leg and gets stuck in an apartment with nothing to do but stare at the neighbours. Voyerism, wit and suspense are all well played and along with Jimmy's great performance, there is the amazing Grace Kelly and Ramond Burr as the surly neighbour who may, or may not have killed his wife. Franz Waxman's musical score adds a tense layer of gripping suspense, with one of the scores where the music is the 5th character. Everything about the film is brilliant. What other film could you mention where every line is classic? Stella: 'Let's go down there and find out what's buried in that garden.' Lisa Carol Fremont: 'Why not? I've always wanted to meet Mrs. Thorwald.'<br />If I could give this more than 5 stars, I would. It is one of the most superbly-crafted films of all time.
0425170349|4.0|Tom Clancy has written a master-piece. This is an excellant thriller with amazing technological applications. I slightly down rated because of the profanity.
0783225849|5.0|An undisputed classic, PSYCHO is the mother of all horror films. Released in 1960, the master's most macarbe film was seen by audiences as tasteless and vulgar, now, 42 years later, it's seen as one of the great lessons in suspense. As Hitchcock himself once put it, \\"The trick is to pull the rug out from people's feet\\". Indeed, in what other film before or after do we see the supposed leading lady get killed 20 minutes through? Throughout the film, themes of fear, paranoia and horror are all displayed to maximum effect. Benard Herrman's terrific score is perhaps one of the most memorable film scores ever composed. Imitated to death, the notorious \\"shower scene\\" with sharp violin strings and high percussion culminates in one of the most amazing sequences ever put onto film. Other nice touches include the introduction of \\"mother\\", Arbogast's demise, and a hinting to Hitchcock's next film, THE BIRDS. Forget the sequels and Gus Van Sant's dismal remake. PSYCHO is one of the greats.
B000059XYM|4.0|I really liked this movie. The humour is black and extreme with some really funny scenes. The pace is quick with no slack or bad bits. It cruises along effortlessly with good performances, scripting and acting. It reminds me of just how ridiculous and formularised these horror movies really are. Some of the jokes are really bad taste ( think Me , Myself and Irene) so if you like that sort of stuff this ones for you. It takes a swipe at almost every stereotype, the virgin, the jock, the homosexual, the cheerleader and the ejaculation scene is unexpectadly wild ( as is the dick in the ear scene). Laugh yourself silly.

B000067CPX|5.0|In their most recent release, \\"By the Way,\\" the RHCP guys demonstrate that even though the times have been hard, they can still manage to control their environment. <br />\\"By the Way\\" is a calm and soulful album. Beatlesque at times. Specially whith the 70`s style synths playing in accompaniment, just as a bebop or motown chorus would do (this does not define the album as that type of soul-full music)while the backup voice sings in a melodious high pitch second on most of the tracks.<br />In the songs you can really appreciate Frusciante's and Flea's talent, for the composicion of the songs lies mostly on their hands; The guitar leads the way for the voice while the bass surrounds and adapts to the compass hovering whilst it puts them together, for a great result. Even if the tone of the record swings as their mood does, stability can be felt.<br />Sound quality is compromised on a couple of tracks for feeling. Most of the record has an old-70's-ballad production feel to it, allowing for the tunes to mellow and fill the ambient (you get more involved in them) while the rest of them dominate, by having a little more punch. The title track and \\"Can't Stop\\" are in the latter category, while \\"I Could Die for You\\" and \\"Dosed\\" are on the first. A couple of songs reside in a different plane, with mixed styles and funkier guitars.<br />Even though some could say this release is not as good as \\"Californication\\" it certainly should be considered as a masterpiece in a different category... This cd explores a different area, one where things are seen in a more hopeful way... This is a definitive hit... and proves that the RHCP can still kick [bottom] while still being gentle.<br />If you dont own this album, go ahead and click and get it now... you will not regret it.
B00004WGAI|4.0|what can i say he was brilliant i wish i could say the same about zelah clarke, she was not the idle jane. too old, jane was just 18- she look 35 if she was a day, jane was very slight- she looked 14stones in weight and i wanted to put my hand into the tv and ring her neck because she was spoiling the wonderful acting by timothy dalton, he was beyond perfect, he brought edward rochester to life for me, i started reading the book 20 yrs ago &amp; timothy was ideal for the part.<BR>the only other fault is that it finished rather lamely ie: no kiss no smile etc
B000069AUI|4.0|I was a huge fan of Coldplay's Parachutes when it first came out, and in the midst of my teenage angst I felt I could really associate with what they were saying. So it has been with great anticipation that I've been waiting for \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head,\\" and I finally got my copy yesterday. So far I've listened to it about three times all the way through, and it gets better each time. It is clear that this is a different Coldplay then the one you hear on \\"Parachutes;\\" this is a more mature and devoloped band. Musically they have grown and adapted new styles, primarly a new complexity and depth to thier songs that comes from the introduction of new instruments. With a few exceptions this new sound works. Most notably the opening track \\"Politik\\" beats the listner over the head with its droning drum bashing, and \\"A Whisper\\" has a similarly erratic rythym to it. But it is the remaining nine songs that really shine. The quiet, subtle sound of \\"Amsterdan\\" is reminicent of the debut album, but progesses into something alltogether different. The title track is a lyrical masterpiece, and the track \\"Warning Sign\\" will move even the most stoic of people. Be advised that this is not an album for the drive to work; rather it is one to be listened to and appreciated in the comfort of a dark room.
6303921248|5.0|wht else can i say?<BR>I've watch the video over and over again buy it watch it travel back in time <BR>well done actors directors and anyone involved it was brilliant <BR>thank you for giving it to us
B000069AUI|5.0|This album is as magical and brilliant as their first, 'Parachutes', although less hypnotic and moody. 'A Rush of Blood to the Head' carries you through the mind of its writers, who obviously have been dealing with a new addition to their lives: fame. There are up moments, down moments, moments that make you want to be a rock star, and moments when you just can't do anything but sit quitely whilst the tears dribble down your cheeks. The song 'The Scientist' is one of the later, reminding you of love tragically lost. Chris Martin's voice delivers an amazing amount of emotion, especially in the first minute and a half of the song, such that you can feel your heart welling up and dropping to your knees. The song 'Clocks' is one of those that you want to drive around listenting to over and over again, with it's pulsating piano and rhythmic bliss. 'A Rush of Blood to the Head', the title track, is a deeply visual, moving piece that represents todays confused, desperate society beautifully. My persoal fovorite track is 'A Warning Sign'. Chris Martin has allowed listeners into his head and to feel his pain. This track is beyond beautiful; so emotional and genuine it almost seem too private and intimate a peek into Chris's life. Alas, the albums first single, 'In My Place', is by far one of its happiest tracks, giving you hope and a new side of Coldplay. The production of this track is top rate - a perfect base line, drums that follow the emotional pull of the song, and, as always, Chris Martins sailing, watercolor vocals that melt my heart.
B00006EXDM|5.0|Whenever an album is newly remastered, a reviewer has to take in both the customers who are buying the album for the first time, and those who are buying their third or fourth copy.<br />I'll start with the former.<br />This is one of those few, special, greatest hits sets that is, in every way, perfect! Most best of's always leave off important tracks and have moments of worthless filler. Others are made obsolete by better, more complete sets. Not Hot Rocks. Merely because it covers only the best, most famous, and most influential songs of the 7 years when the Stones were at their peak, mountains above the rest of rock and roll. (except the Beatles, Dylan, and Hendrix). Sure Not Fade Away, The Last Time, and 2000 Light Years (among others) were fine, but how can you say they aren't dwarfed by the looming presence of every song on this album? (Which includes Time is on my Side, Satisfaction, Paint it Black, Let's Spend the Night Together, Jumpin' Jack Flash, Sympathy for the Devil, and Brown sugar)<br />In conclusion this is a perfect sampler of everything that was great and magical about the Rolling Stones, and remains great and magical today. Words can not describe the greatness of the songs in this album, so I can only say this, I can only say that you are not a rock and roll fan until you are Stones fan. So for everybody who wishes to sink their teeth into the glory days of the Rolling Stones, Hot Rocks is the place to begin. (Note: While you're at it, get Exile on Main Street and Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out as well.)<br />Now for those who already who need a reason to buy this again.<br />Most everyone who collects music knows how badly one can be screwed out of well-earned money by remasters. (i.e the Ozzy Osbourne \\"remasters\\" released this year) Not this time around. You will never Rolling Stones recordings that sound so fresh and clear. New musical bits are brought to the surface for the first time in years. (Most notably on Honky Tonk Woman where horns and new guitar licks can be heard for the first time) And all those classic old songs now sound sharper and more distinct than ever. You can hear those wonderful guitar riffs, drums, and bass licks (oh those wonderful Bill Wyman bass licks) like never before. (i.e. Brian Jones' sitar on Paint it Black is at last brought to the front of the mix, and you can actually hear two different guitars on Midnight Rambler). It gets even better for those that have bought SACD players, for on the SACD layer it sounds even more incredible. It almost sounds as if you are sitting there in the studio watching the Stones make the master takes. And for those that think this isn't worth buying, because all these songs are on other discs, think about this; you won't be hearing the original Brown Sugar and Wild Horses sounding so good for a while.<br />So in conclusion anybody who is anybody owes it to themselves to buy the new version of Hot Rocks. New fans get a sampler of some of the greatest music ever made, and the older fans get the best sounding glory-day Stones you'll ever hear. The Rolling Stones Remasters is one of the best (if not the best) of its kind. It is definetely worth checking out. And Hot Rocks ain't a bad place to start. Get it today!
B000063DIH|3.0|I own almost every Maiden album and I have to say this one really disappoints me. If you try to like it, you will....but only for a short time.  Since there aren't very many fantastic songs here, your not goin to come listen to this over and over again like their first seven albums.  <br />Be Quick or Be Dead- The hardest song on the album. Murray has a good solo in it but Bruce's vocals are raspy. A-<br />From Here to Eternity- I personally like this song, especially the chorus. Murray has another impressive solo. (His is first and Janick takes over at the end.)  A-<br />Afraid to Shoot Strangers- If you really want to know this is the only reason for me to listen to this album. After the first four minutes the guitars explode into a frenzy of solos. One of the most beautiful ballads Maiden recorded in the nineties. A+<br />Fear is the Key- from here on the album is basically dull escept for a few parts here and there.  This track holds the worst Maiden guitar solo ever. Just weak overall. Ugh.  C<br />Childhood's End- A good song, especially the instrumental part in the middle.  Not anything that special though.  B<br />Wasting Love- This is the supposed prequel to Dream of Mirrors which I think drags on. Very soft. This song is decent like the above.  B<br />Fugitive- saves the middle of the album. Lyrics are good, and so is the tune and beat. Worth a listen. A-<br />Chains of Misery- another good song like above. Kind of a cheesy chorus but the solos are good. B+<br />Apparition- Awful.  Ah that's too harsh a word. Not good. Very cheesy as you can tell by the first five seconds. Intersting part in the middle but that's it.  C<br />Judas My Guide- memorable chorus but I really don't like Maiden's sound on this album.  B<br />Weekend Warrior- better than The Apparition but really nothing special.  The first ten seconds make you think this a good song until the verses.  Horrible lyrics and verses. I didn't know this was about soccer until someone told me. So bad.C<br />Fear of the Dark- finally a decent epic to close the album.  Better than Mother Russia but not nearly as good as Rime of the Ancient Mariner, and to me even To Tame a Land. It is a very memorable song though.  A<br />Well if you are a maiden fan I would buy it.  You will probably disagree with me the first month or two you have it but then agree with me.  I cannot recommend this to anyone else though.  If you want the best songs from this album and you don' want to get into Iron Maiden (why would anyone not want to?) then go buy the 27 track version of The Best of the Beast.
B000002JS6|4.0|The guitar is certainly what makes this a classic.  How can anyone forget the great opening of the title track?  Of course Brian Johnson's voice is unmistakable.<BR>All in all this is one of the classic albums of the Heavy Metal era, if not the definitive album.  Anyone who can't listen to the tital, or you shook me all night long, should be found unAmerican.
B000002LGQ|5.0|Like a Prayer could very well be Madonna's most important album; marked by maturity, honest emotional content, superior musical form and style, and overall quality, it is a remarkable achievement by an artist whose earliest work was dismissed by some as throwaway pop.  Perhaps no other album I own starts off as strongly as this one.  Like a Prayer and Express Yourself make one heck of a one-two punch.  This is the Madonna I like the most--brave, strong, unafraid of controversy, and willing and able to rock your world.  Personally, I found the controversy over Like a Prayer and its video to be quite overblown, but it certainly did nothing to hurt album sales.  The gospel background vocals gives the song a powerful, full sound that only reinforces the driving beat and mass appeal of the song.  Express Yourself is a Madonna statement song--Madonna knows all about expressing herself, and the song does inspire you to be yourself and let others know what you are thinking.<br />Love Song is a song I can take or leave.  At the time, Prince and Madonna were pretty much the king and queen of pop music, and it was really something to hear them team up on a duet.  Unfortunately, the song has little substance, and Prince overplays his peculiar, distinctive voice and style.  Till Death Do Us Part is, in my opinion, the best song on the album.  It has meaningful, important lyrics, yet its tempo makes you tap or sway along with the music; it almost moves too quickly, achieving a perfectly vibrant, energetic pace, and the chorus is just wonderful.  Promise to Try is a slower song with beautiful lyrics and a graceful sound, offering yet more proof that  Madonna is a real singer with great vocal skills.  When Cherish was released as a single, I heard it so often on the radio that I eventually came to dislike the song; listening to it again now, though, I realize how great the song really is.  Cherish strikes me as possessing a certain air and spirit of 1960s pop music. It's definitely an uplifting song to listen to, with a strong \\"feel good\\" quality to it.<br />Dear Jessie is another example of Madonna's new sound and style on this album.  The music itself is rather subdued, placing the song's emphasis on Madonna's lyrical stylings;  this calming track is the kind of song I imagine Madonna would sing to her children at bedtime.  For emotional content, the striking Oh Father tops the list on this CD; it definitely sounds like Madonna is singing this one right from the heart.  The flow between verse and chorus is striking, and the whole song is a delight to listen to.  After a string of slow, emotional tracks, Madonna decides it is time to get the place jumping again with Keep It Together (although even this song carries a strong message).  Spanish Eyes is another poignant song of beauty and wonder.  Act of Contrition is a weird way to end the album, but I like it.  The harmonic dissonance of the Like a Prayer choruses, electric guitar riffs, and free-style lyrics is refreshingly different.<br />This is a really deep album of great substance.  For me, this great asset became somewhat of a vulnerability, though.  Hearing songs such as Oh Father and Cherish over and over again on adult contemporary radio stations sort of led me to believe Madonna had lost her edge (despite such evidence to the contrary as Express Yourself).  In terms of musical structure and delivery, Like a Prayer is vastly superior to Madonna's previous albums; I easily recognize this fact, but, in general, I prefer the fun dance songs of earlier years to the poignant, beautiful music that typifies this album.an uplifting song to listen to, with a strong \\"feel good\\" quality to it.<br />Dear Jessie is another example of Madonna's new sound and style on this album.

B00000K3G8|5.0|This is one of the great live albums ever released.<BR>The newly restored version with the extra track only solidifies an already top notch album.<BR>This showcases the talents of David Byrne and the Talking Heads, and clearly shows why they were the best American band through much of the '80s.<BR>Highly recomended for anyone who likes the Talking Heads, or anyone who is just looking for a fun album.
B00003CXXO|2.0|I'm sorry, maybe it's just me but I can't helping stating that this has to be one of the wrost movies I've seen in my life!<br />Can you say boring? Can you say doesn't make sense at all? The first 30 minutes of the movie were O.K. But it went downhill after that. This movie is a prime example of a director attempting to make a deep movie with a meaningful lesson but failed on all levels. I don't recommend this movie unless you want to go to sleep or you don't have anything else to do.
B000002UC5|4.0|While perhaps Paul McCartney better selling albums (Band on the Run) or more daring albums (Ram), McCartney is perhaps his the best album Paul has done since the Beatles split.<BR>The album has easily the best song Paul McCartney wrote in his solo career.  Maybe I'm Amazed is a classic.  One of the great songs of the Rock n' Roll era.  Rolling Stone named it the #50 song of the era.<BR>The rest of the album is just fun.  Mostly Paul experimenting on playing different instruments, and doing the songs he wanted to do, but never was able to (Junk, was meant to be a beatles song, but was rejected).<BR>This finds Paul playing all of the instruments on almost every song (Linda contributes a little), and is a refreshing change of pace from the over produced albums (Let it Be) at the end of the Beatles career.  Recomended for anyone just getting into Paul's solo work, it is a good introduction.
B000002JSV|5.0|Well, 1978´s POWERAGE has something unique here, a raw, crisp, energetic and clear sound. The lyrics were their best ever, before or after, courtesy of a inspired Bon Scott.<br />All the nine songs are great, no fillers here. IN their recent DVD SITFF UPPER LIP, they even played UP TO MY NECK IN YOU live.<br />This is the first record by new bass man Cliff Williams, and the last that production team George Young and Harry Vanda would produce, before joining back with AC/DC in 1988´s BLOW UP YOUR VIDEO.<br />This this the typical stuff of which rock legends are made. POWERAGE is rock legend. A bunch of guys in their twenties (Except Scott), recording immortal rock music.
0790736942|2.0|Since I was a kid, I have heard people all over say time and time again that THE EXORCIST is &#34;one of the scariest movies of all time.&#34; I've never been a huge fan of horror, but in order to improve my cinematic horizons, I have been watching a lot of schlock and horror lately and finally viewed THE EXORCIST. My impression: what in the world is the big deal? Outside of superb acting and some neat special effects, THE EXORCIST isn't that great. The writing is terrible and contains loads of dialogue that when found in other movies is referred to as &#34;cheesy&#34; and &#34;unimaginative.&#34; The movie moves at an incredibly slow pace, so much so that I almost fell asleep fifteen minutes into the film. The movie makes hardly any explanation of what is going on or why (I know this is a film that's supposed to make one think, but good thinking movies give a foundation from where people can begin to form their assumptions and ideas; this movie has no such foundation). The film has several major plot holes. The ending is predictable (come on, who didn't know the priests were going to die in the end?). The film paints Christianity in a negative light, picturing it to be something leftover from the Medieval Ages. And lastly, the movie really isn't that scary.<br /><br />I guess that the reason so many people find this film so frightening is that they think something like it could happen to them. There must be a lot of people out there who are totally unsure about their salvation and the state of their eternal souls. Something like what happens in the movie would not happen to someone who is a Christian. Of course, Biblically speaking, it probably would not happen to an innocent (young child) either. Watching the movie, I got the idea that Linda Blair's character wasn't all that innocent. Even before she becomes possessed she hints at sexual promiscuity she has been involved with and some of her earlier actions with her mother and servants aren't all that innocent either.<br /><br />I will admit that the acting is done well and some of the special effects are pretty cool. However, other than that, there really isn't any reason to see this film. I find it difficult that it is held in such high regard.her.<br /><br />I will admit that the acting is done well and some of the special effects are pretty cool.

B000069HKH|5.0|Bruce, America thanks you from the bottom of our heart!<br />Words really cannot express the magnitude of emotions that you feel when listening to this album.  I have never, ever, ever heard a CD that is so rivoting!!  You find yourself singing, crying, praying, and dancing.  <br />This music fills all the voids that people might be experiencing in terms of their response to Sept 11, 2001.  The music &amp; lyrics bring hope and revival to your heart.  Bruce gently takes you into the depths of human loss; but then wonderfully lifts you up into the heights of heaven!  <br />You better buy a few copies 'cause you'll either 1) wear out your CD by playing it so much  or; 2) want to give copies to all your friends, family, and even your attorney!
B000067CPX|1.0|This band used to be called Red Hot Chili Peppers. But with this album all all pepper has gone, it's just soft, all songs are melodic and softly romantic.. very nice but there's nothing hot... its perfectly boring.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay has not only managed to accomplish the impossible, they actually excelled at this, their highly anticipated second album.  If writers put everything into their first book, musicians have a more difficult lot in life:  meeting everyone's expectations following a brilliant debut.  A Rush of Blood to the Head is everything you could hope for and more.<BR>The vocals are beautiful, Chris Martin demonstrates excellent range of music and emotion.  The addition of strings and keyboards bring a new depth.  The guitars and harmonies do not disappoint.  This is music you can hear and feel.  There has been a fair amount of airplay of \\"In My Place\\" and \\"God Put a Smile Upon My Face\\" (thanks triple J) but the rest of the cuts on this album, though less familiar for now, are just as good.  A great CD, I highly recommend it.
B000050XEI|5.0|I wish I could tell you all how much I enjoy this album!<BR>I'm not a music reviewer or an expert by any means.  Just an everyday gal --you know, the kind that has to do a thousand things in just a few hours?<BR>Listening to this collection \\"grounds\\" and re-centers me.  I listen to it daily while I work. It brings peace to my chaotic day and inspires further creation.<BR>I enjoy a wide variety of styles of music, and I continually find myself coming back to Enya and her work.<BR>Tracks like Wild Child and Only Time are two of my favorite.<BR>If you buy it I'm sure you, too, will enjoy the work of this unique artist!
B000002JSZ|5.0|Such an underrated album.. I can´t understand.<br />The production, (by AC/DC itself) is raw, dark, there´s a different tone here, it´s hard to explain. THe lyrics continues in a downhill ride in terms of quality, but all the riffs are strong, precise and clear to listen. Jus tlove this album, even knowing that it was recorded in the middle of serious conflicts between Malcolm and Phil Rudd.<br />The 10 track are great, but the best, in my opinion, are GUNS FOR HIRE, RISING POWER, BEDLAM IN BELGIUM and NERVOUS SHAKEDOWN. Also, this was the last album in which Brian could really scream with the top of his lungs and sound efficient, instead of annoying.
B00005JKL8|4.0|This is a very entertaining and visually pleasing film, one that will capture your interest and propel it along for the almost two hours of the movie. Yet it is really just an escape movie that happened to be released in the aftermath of the 911 events, and so capitalized on the pent-up feelings of patriotism everyone was experiencing at the time. As a thinly disguised although highly fictionalized representation of an actual case of an American flier rescued after evading the Serbs for several days during the Bosnian police action, this might have made some sense.<br />Yet the depiction of the Serb ground forces as brutal and conscienceless bogeymen is a bit overdone and not very accurate; most of the Serbs treated downed American fliers with consideration and in a very friendly manner. Of course, had this been depicted as part of the Kosovo effort, the scenes depicting the Serbs might have been more accurate. As it stands, however, the story is hardly representative of the reality on the ground during the Bosnian campaign.<br /><br />Still, taken at face value as action entertainment, the movie isn't half-bad. Yet as anything like serious drama it has too many implausible elements and too many coincidences to hold water. So, while this is no \\"to Hell And Back', it is an exciting escapist excursion you will enjoy watching. The scenes filmed on the carrier are especially graphic and well done, and the shots of the planes coming off the deck are breath taking.<br />So too the aerial photography is very well choreographed and accomplished, and the action shots of the plane being engaged by ground batteries fairly realistic in its technical details. The cast is quite good, with Owen Wilson playing the downed flier and Gene Hackman the Carrier skipper who is trying to get him back. This is good stuff to wile away a Saturday evening as long as you don't take any of it too literally. Enjoy!
B000002UAU|5.0|Suffice it to say that this album, although one among many great ones by the Beatles, is arguably the \\"must have album\\". In its day it spent more time at the top of the selling charts than any other Beatles album (15 weeks!) and that was not a fluke. I am not going to cover all the same ground that has been covered in a million reviews. It is inconceivable to me that anyone could not love this album and just about every song on it.  Both quantity and quality here. Enjoy!

B000005PW0|5.0|This first in the series still remains my favorite. The characters were new, diverse and above all believable, while the gags were fresh, creating a colorful merry-go-round of laughs. In addition, the characters are mostly all likeable and evoke empathy. Sure, there's a lot of slapstick and the humor gets a bit crude at times, but I love it still as much as I loved it then. Very enjoyable light entertainment.
B000069AUI|4.0|there are mixed reviews about the new Coldplay album, Rush of Blood to the Head. But since when do i listen to music critics anyways ? the negative reviews are moaning that it isnt deep enough, that their Radiohead influences are still apparent, that it isnt ground breaking enough. They say these things in so many words, but this is the message that they are trying to put across. <br />Well Allison thinks that those remarks are music snob [nonsense].<BR>When someone puts out a record it doesnt have to be genius, it doesnt have to change the world. There is nothing wrong with<BR>making a record that people simply like to listen to, with lyrics that are meaningful without sounding pretentious or abstract.<br />I feel confident in saying that I have excellent tastes in music. And I listened to Rush of Blood to the Head 3 times in a row last night before finally going to sleep at 3:30. And guess which record I played first thing in the morning?<BR>Bottom line : A Rush of Blood is a lovely follow up to Parachutes.... if you enjoyed Coldplays first album - then i recommend picking this one up.
B000002H6C|2.0|As 1991´s METALLICA was dubbed the BLACK ALBUM, 1988´s AND JUSTICE FOR ALL should be called THE FLAT ALBUM: \\"flat\\" being for its flat sound, uninspired production, horrible drums sound, total lack of bass.<br />IN this album, Metallica had great ideas, but Ulrich and Hetfield began to show the world who rules Metallica with an iron hand, by giving new bass player Jason Newsted a \\"hot\\" reception, by simply practically erasing the bass parts from the final mix!!! It´s awesome: a metal album where you can hardly listen to the bass guitar!!<br />That put aside, Jason himself says this album is terribly bad and that he would prefer to record Elvis songs than something like this. Ok, it´s full of time changes or whatever, but they hardly work in benefit of the songs.<br />Best tracks are Blackened, One and TO live Is To Die.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay has made a major leap from their previous album,Parachutes; and that is saying something.  Sounding like a hybrid of U2, Radiohead, and Pink Floyd, Coldplay has crafted some exquisitely beautiful songs with a strong sense of urgency on a \\"Rush of Blood to the Head.\\"  The chiming guitars and plaintive singing of Chris Martin on \\"In My Place,\\" guarantee this will be one of the most popular songs of the last half of the year.  Other songs like \\"Clocks,\\" \\"Amsterdam,\\" and \\"Warning Sign\\" are incredibly distinctive and immediately catchy.  This album will only get better with repeated listenings.  In addition, they may have helped revitalize headphones with this album.  All the sonic acrobatics and incredible singing and musicianship will be best enjoyed in a dark room with the headphones on.  Enjoy at your own risk.
B00003CXE6|2.0|I can't say that I hated this movie.  It just didn't particularly engage me.  It is a movie that can't decide what it wants to be...is it your typical summer action flick, with lots of blood and gore and special effects, or is it a political thriller, full of scheming, machinations, treachery and betrayal?  This movie tries to have it both ways, without success, the result being that it is supremely boring much of the time.<br />It is pretty obvious early on, after a nice big battle scene to open things up, that we have a tried-and-true story of revenge underway.  The unbelievably heroic Maximus is betrayed and his family slaughtered by the evil emperor, blah blah blah...it is obvious that a showdown is brewing.<br />So why don't we get to the showdown already?  Instead, we get blah blah blah...Marcus Aurelius blathers a bunch of gobbledy-gook and nonsense to Maximus about restoring the Republic (oh sure!)...blah blah blah...we find out that Commodus is evil and corrupt, but all he really ever wanted was his father's love and approval, blah blah blah...the emperor's sister has had the hots for Maximus all of this time, blah blah blah...the senators are frustrated with the emperor's indifference to administrative affairs, blah blah blah....oh god just make it stop.  None of this blah blah blah-ing is of any real substance, so you just sit through it, waiting for the next gory fight scene.<br />I enjoy movies that have plenty of dialogue, and some of my favorite movies have not a whit of violence in them.  But the massive amounts of dialogue in this movie do nothing to propel the plot forward.  It only bogs the movie down.  Trying to make the characters multi-dimensional in what is, in essence, a live-action comic book, in fact makes the characters only look all that much more ridiculous.  Don't try to make Commodus look \\"sympathetic\\" by portraying the conflicted nature of his relationship with his daddy...who cares?!?  He is merely a plot device, like so many Shakespearian villains.  He does not need to have his motives explained.  So don't explain them, again and again.<br />Even the fight scenes left something to be desired.  Why not just stick a bunch of cardboard figures in the stand and a stuffed tiger in the arena?  The technology certainly exists for making better special effects than this, for crying out loud.<br />When my wife brought the video home a second time I popped it in and started to watch it.  Without realizing it at first, I fast-forwarded through one combat scene to the next.  Ultimately, I realized that this is truly the proper way to watch this movie.  It should take you only about 35 minutes this way.  How efficient!<br />Never mind the appalling liberties that the movie took with historical fact; I think we all have come to realize that no movie is going to be particularly faithful to the historical record, especially where Rome is concerned.  With movies like this, the viewer is not looking for a history lesson (I hope), but it would be nice to have some decent pacing so that we don't die of boredom between the fight scenes.earian villains.

B000062YB1|5.0|After 1986's \\"Reign in Blood\\" cemented Slayer with the metal elite, they're 1988 follow up \\"South of Heaven\\" received mixed feelings from die hard \\"Reign in Blood\\" fanatics.  1990's \\"Seasons in the Abyss\\" mixes both album's styles: \\"Reign in Blood\\"'s fast paced extreme metal and \\"South of Heaven\\"'s heavy melodies.  The album starts off with \\"War Ensemble\\", a song spinning lyrics about propoganda used in wars, followed by some insane solos by Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman.  \\"Spirit in Black\\" is a highlight here as well, while the chilling \\"Dead Skin Mask\\" is inspired by the crimes of crazed killer Ed Gein.  The catchy chorus of the song and the chilling ending featuring the child crying to leave give the song an unexpected impact.  \\"Skeletons of Society\\" is a song written soley by Kerry King, and shows off his songwriting talents and different ranges of Tom Araya's voice.  This has quickly become one of my all time favorite Slayer songs with its' catchy chorus and blazing solos.  The ending title track is reason enough to buy this album, everything about the song is unbelieveable.  By the time the chorus is over with and the guitar solos start, your thrown head first into it and Dave Lombardo's frantic double bass drums.  That track alone shows how much Slayer matured musicallu and lyrically since they're 1986 breakthrough.  All in all, \\"Seasons in the Abyss\\" is in my opinion Slayer's best album, and one of the finest metal albums of all time.

B000002JS8|5.0|Altough AC/DC was doing great by the end of 1978, ATLANTIC RECORDS always tought they needed to change their sound a little bit to break through commercially once and for all.<BR>So, they decided it was time to change things and, for the first time, AC/DC recorded their new album outside Australia, and without George Young / Harry Vanda producing. Atlantic assigned to them, firstly, producer Eddie Kramer. Things did not work out with him, however, and they moved to London to record with hot producer Robert John \\"Mutt\\" Lange (now Shania Twain´s husband).<br />And Lange operated a miracle. The sound changed, but without selling out, and the band was capable of rock and roll with all their ferocity and simplicity, but with a more focused approach. The backing vocals got better, Scott sung like never. (only the lyrics, in my opinion, became weaker and less diverse than albums like POWERAGE and LET THERE BE ROCK, for example).<br />HIGHWAY TO HELL is simply about ten of the best rock songs ever recorded over the face of Earth. All of them are very good, with the favorites varying according to the listener. And, mostly amazing, it does not sound dated nowadays.<br />After Scott died, the band and their managers knew that he was virtually irreplaceable. His particular vocal style, his humorous malice, his simple but catchy lyrics, his experience (the guy had 33 at the time of his death): it was imposible to find all that in another singer. <br />But AC/DC had to go on. Music was their profession and their lives, of course! So they hired another singer who, at least, had also a particular voice: Brian Johnson. And Lange produced another miracle in BACK IN BLACK. But that´s another history...

0060900075|5.0|On that fateful day, 4 May 1953, Aldous Huxley, novelist, philosopher, poet and world famous intellectual, drank a glass of water mixed with silvery white mescalin. As Humphrey Osmond, a Canadian psychiatrist, specializing in schizophrenia, wrote, \\"It was a delicious May morning in Hollywood, no hint of smog to make the eyes smart, not too hot.\\" Osmond had supplied the drug to Huxley for the experiment, and acted as 'observing recorder' of the historical event.<br />Huxley had high hopes for the experience, and believed that the drug would in fact admit him into the world that Blake painted and tried to describe in his poetry; and also possibly transport him into the mystical world of Meister Eckhart. The reality of the situation exceeded his hopes - as Huxley wrote in ~The Doors of Perception~, \\"I was seeing what Adam had seen on the morning of his creation - the miracle, moment by moment, of naked existence.\\"<br />~The Doors of Perception~ is an important commentary from a man of rationality and science, attempting to investigate what some call 'Intuitive knowledge'. As a researcher and writer, he knew second hand these reported heightened states of awareness, had observed and dimly 'felt' these states through painting, architecture and art in general, but wanted desperately to experience them first hand. The book describes his feelings, perceptions and thoughts about the experiment.<br />Huxley writes that one of our basic universal human needs is to transcend our, at times, banal consciousness, \\"...the urge to transcend self conscious self-hood is...a principal appetite of the soul.\\" (P.54) We have been doing it and continue to do it since time immemorial. Our methods, however, particularly in modern times, has been destructive. He writes, \\"When, for whatever reason, men and women fail to transcend themselves by means of worship, good works and spiritual exercises, they are apt to resort to religion's chemical surrogates - alcohol and 'goof-pills' in the modern West, alcohol and opium in the East, hashish in the Mohammedan world, alcohol and marijuana in Central America...\\" (P.54) Unfortunately these sad and destructive alternatives have mounted since this writing, but the central message is the same. He goes on to say, \\"Ideally, everyone should be able to find self-transcendence in some form of pure or applied religion.\\" But, for the most part, \\"...the hungry sheep look up and are not fed.\\"<br />~Heaven and Hell~ is a sequel to ~The Doors of Perception~ describing or more so reflecting on the visionary experience through various means. Huxley also explores the understandings of other minds in their perceptions and cosmological notions expressed through art, and why they are impelled to express these notions. He also describes the dark side to spiritual insight of the divine nature: the dark, empty journey of the soul when overwhelmed by such experiences, manifested in mental illness such as schizophrenia.<br />This important book was first published in 1954, and has become a classic that continues to communicate the plight and experince of the human condition: concise and easy to read - an absolute must.West, alcohol and opium in the East, hashish in the Mohammedan world, alcohol and marijuana in Central America...\\" (P.54) Unfortunately these sad and destructive alternatives have mounted since this writing, but the central message is the same.

B00006GFAB|2.0|The recording industry is a mess and this is a by-product of a disaster. First I must say KISS is not alone hawking a greatest hits package these days. The \\"Essential\\" series is selling big numbers and Gene Simmons wants his piece of the Greatest Hits windfall of cash. With the normal shelf life of a CD growing smaller than Anna Nicole Smiths IQ, veteran bands are more comfortable milking their back catalogs than producing new material. Having said that, the Very Best of Kiss is a passable effort. For starters, I'm a little uneasy with the cover photo depicting the original line-up. Some of the material here is from the second and third incarnations of the band. A cover with their infamous logo would have been a better choice. The music is what it is. Nothing here is too complicated and it never was meant to be taken seriously. If three chords and a cloud of dry ice is your idea of a good time, you are standing in the lobby of the band that invented the genre of cold beer, large breasted women and mindless drivel rock and roll. That's not to say it hasn't been a profitable ride for Gene Simmons who is a walking ATM machine thanks to the marketing designs of KISS. This CD will bring back memories for fans that were teens in the 70's. New fans will undoubtedly have to choose between this and the DVD of backyard wrestling high jinx.
B000069AUI|5.0|I have to admit that when I first put this cd into my portable cd player and put my headphones on for my first listen of this album I was a bit hesitant to fall into the music like I did with the bands debut album 'Parachutes'. I ultimatly did not want a HUGE let down-seeing that most bands follow up albums are commonly viewed as there worst. I didn't really get drawn into the pulsating, steady beat of Politik (track 1) at first...but about a minute into the song I found myself really relishing the vocals and the repetitive instrumentation. The album clearly takes off after the first track though. IN MY PLACE is the albums first single, and in my opinion, is this albums \\"YELLOW\\". IN MY PLACE is an emotive, catchy song that sets the pace for this brilliant and stunning masterpeice of an album! Chris's vocals soar and flutter throughout the cd in ways that have really put his voice into a class of its own. My favorite track is THE SCIENTIST. The vocals on this song really pull at your heart and if you don't feel SOMETHING while listening to this song, then you should really start worrying! THE SCIENTIST is a very romantic, haunting love song and is the albums most lush, heart-wrenching ballad. The most catchy song on the album, in my opinion, would be CLOCKS. Lead vocalist Chris Martin really hammers on the piano in a way that is reminiscent of a cross between Tori Amos and The Cure (I'm not sure why-but that's what comes to mind folks)and the song is truly a brilliant and mind blowing creation. The albums title song A RUSH OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD is another deep and moving tune. This cd may take some time to get used to seeing that it doesn't quite have the same musical vibe that it's predecessor PARACHUTES had..but, this cd is definetly one of the best albums of the year and an amazing work of art from a band that I am positive will be around for a LONG time!<br />Also, check the band out live-I saw them in June and was blown away-They are absolutly flawless live on stage!
B000002H97|2.0|After AND JUSTICE FOR ALL, Metallica simply run out of ideas. That´s it. They just could not write great metal compositions anymore.<br />Let´s check my claim: AND JUSTICE.... was recorded in 1988. Since then, Metallica released only two studio albums with new material: METALLICA (1991) and LOAD / RELOAD (I´ll count them as one because they were the result of the same recording sessions).<br />In the span of 14 years, Metallica has released only two albums, and filled the gap with a live album with orchestra and a new covers-album....Smart guys...<br />So, altough the black album is hailed as a &quot;masterpiece&quot;, I can not forget the fact that it seems the point where everything fell apart for Metallica´s integrity and honesty. THis is the moment when they team up with producer Bob Rock to make real money, and they obtained it. THis is the moment when the songs began to sound the same, with that slow-paced drum beat and groovy riffs.<br />Like many other bands (and that´s natural), Metallica was not capable of releasing album after album of strong material. In their specific case, their run ended with MASTER OF PUPPETS (three albums) or, depending on your taste, with AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. The Black Album is good, but it was not about Metallica anymore...

B000069AUI|5.0|I don't normally take critics reviews of new music very seriously as they are normally way off base. However, the critical acclaim this CD has received is well earned. Coldplay has taken their music to new levels. This is the best CD to come out in years hands down. Chris Martin's vocals are mesmerizing and the lyrics are powerful. Personal favorites are: Warning Sign, Green Eyes, The Scientist, and God Put a Smile on Your Face. Not a fan of Coldplay? Not a problem, I wasn't either but you will be after just one listen to this CD. Simply put, it's superb.
B00006F83Y|5.0|Queens of the Stone Age might be the best rock band active today. \\"Songs For the Deaf,\\" the group's third album, is their finest to date. That in and of itself is no small feat, as both of Queens' previous efforts were excellent in their own right. Dave Grohl (former Nirvana drummer, now Foo Fighters singer) plays drums on \\"Songs...,\\" and his presence is most definitely felt. Homme and Oliveri, meanwhile, pieced together a record that works beginning to end.<BR>     <BR>     \\"No One Knows\\" is the first single. The song is very unconventional underneath, with a guitar riff generally foreign to this genre, but rocks nevertheless. \\"First it Giveth\\" and \\"Go With the Flow\\" combine mainstream rock sensibilities with a powerful, live-sounding production. The overall song-writing quality here is phenomenal. \\"The Sky is Fallin,\\" \\"Hangin' Tree,\\" (from Desert Sessions 7/8), \\"Do It Again,\\" and \\"Another Love Song\\" are all remarkable. Production is also very true to Queen's sound (I've seen them live). The end result is an album which in some ways reminds me of \\"In Utero,\\" by Nirvana, not so much for its style, but its substance.<br />     Anyone who likes rock music, be it Staind, the Vines, Linkin Park or Nickelback, should buy \\"Songs for the Deaf.\\" It may wind up being as essential as \\"Daydream Nation,\\" \\"In Utero,\\" and \\"OK Computer.\\" At the very least, its among the best of 2002...

B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay instantly made an impression on me with their debut album \\"Parachutes\\"; I knew these guys would go places right from its opening track \\"Don't Panic\\".  Then, I checked out some of the non-CD b-sides and EP cuts, which were equally good.  Now, with this sophomore effort, they have proven that they're in it for the long haul.  Every critical accolade which has been and will be given to this masterpiece is completely deserved; each track has had the utmost thought and care put into it, which results in a solid album all the way through.  The sound is undeniably Coldplay yet not a mindless retread of the first album--there is a logical expansion of their sound which is anchored by some of their best songwriting to date.  \\"Politik\\", \\"God Put A Smile On Your Face\\", \\"Daylight\\", \\"Green Eyes\\", \\"Warning Sign\\"...I could name them all, but these were definite highlights.  The production is<BR>smooth and soothing, yet the tracks defintitely come at you like a rush of blood to the head...I would recommend any Coldplay as a natural tranquilizer and salve for the troubled mind...they also have one of the finest vocalists to come out of rock in at least a decade.  There will be comparisons to Radiohead but the group definitely have their own sound (one I prefer, actually).<BR>In short, buy it now and make Coldplay the dazzling success they deserve to be.
B00003CXXP|3.0|The way I always look at this movie is that its divided into 3 acts: 1) adjusting to the family 2) on his own with Gigolo Joe 3) the aliens.  This movie would be WONDERFUL and deeply moving if it ended at the end of part 2 in the flooded Coney Island and just left out the whole Alien finale'.  It would have been a proper ending, and profoundly powerful.  Instead, when the audience is on the verge of tears, its time to reverse direction totally and create a totally different, ultra sappy ending.  Dear, god it was horrible.<BR>  Up to then the movie was fine.  I begrudgingly admit that Haley Joel acted wonderfully.  Jude Law stole the movie, and Spielberg directs with wonderful artistic flair.  Up to the end, it has the makings of a great film, but the ultrasap ending ruins the whole movie.
B000069KE0|4.0|Recently I reviewed Rhino's remastered CD of this album, as follows:<br />I have always loved most of the music on this album (though I do find \\"It Better End Soon\\" to be pretty tedious). I was hoping that Rhino's remaster would work a minor miracle with the sound, which was bad even on the original LP that I bought when it was first released. Alas, the latest version STILL sounds lifeless and flat -- a real shame, considering how well some of these songs ROCK. I actually wrote to Rhino and they assured me that the remaster was done from the original master tapes. I'm sure they did as much as they could to improve the sound.<br />Anyway, this disc is still worth having for the quality of the music alone. The creativity and energy in most of these songs is phenomenal. One great musical moment, often overlooked, is in track 4 when the horns blend seamlessly into Terry Kath's vocal for the final chorus. Sweet!<br />I'd like to give this four stars, but it loses one for its marginal sound quality. (end of original review)<br />Well, I just acquired the DVD-Audio version of this album, and to my great delight, it really is significantly better than ALL other versions of this album that I have bought. That includes the LP, which I always thought sounded horribly compressed and distorted.<br />This disc will never sound quite as clean as I want it to, but I think I have finally bought Chicago II for the last time. The multichannel mix really does open things up, and the whole thing sounds much richer, with deeper bass and less distortion. Thanks, Rhino!

B0000640SA|4.0|As a filmmaker, I found this to be one of the most original films of the last few years. In large part, this is due to the editing. The film works it's way backword, while the black and white footage progresses forward. The acting is great, and the character in the story is as confused as we are as to what's happening. This DVD version, like the Canadian bare-bones edition allows you to view the movie in chronological order of scenes should you wish or if you are still confused after the first viewing, but I recommend that you watch it the way it's intended first. As someone who's also designed and programmed DVD's, one feature of this limited edition is to be be either given high praise for it's design or extreme displeasure for it's navigation. To access anything on the 2 discs, you are presented the options for DVD navigation cryptically like a series of pshychiatric tests. Thank goodness for the Internet and it's multitude of websites that have mapped this labyrinth out for you. From a design-sense it's brilliant, but navigation wise, I can see why many despise this disc and the designers should have presented the viewers with an easy navigation menu system as well. It's worth the purchase, but check the Internet for navigation tips. I would give the movie 5 stars but the DVD's difficult navigation keeps the whole package at 4.
B0000584V3|5.0|Opeth is one of those bands that cannot be catagorized. It is heavy and dark, like death metal, yet the melancholic sounds that permeate the long tracks almost add a doom metal influence. I say almost, because Opeth is neither death or doom or just a compination of the two. Most of Opeth's songs are very long. They create an intense mood in the listener. All of Opeth's albums are good, and this is just the latest in a series of incredible metal albums from this Swedish group. My favorite songs are 'Bleak', 'Harvest' and 'Dirge for November'. You should pick this up if you like any type of metal, you won't regret it.

When i listened to the tape i knew that i didn't like Monster Magnet, but i fell in love with 'Gish'. That was the moment i started to follow the Smashing Pumpkins and i listened to 'Gish' a lot for the next two years. By 1993 i had become a huge Smashing Pumpkins fan, so it's needless to say that i bought 'Siamese Dream' on the day of its release in the summer of 1993. <br />It's 2002 now and it's been 9 years ago that 'Siamese Dream' was released and i must have listened to this album about 235,235,366 times since 1993. To me it's the best cd of all-times and the closest to my heart. Actually i am planning to buy 'Siamese Dream' for the second time as my copy has been completely 'worn off' over the years. I've never done that before, but i know 'Siamese Dream' is worth it. I'll keep my casette-tape of 'Gish' and my completely 'worn off' copy of Siamese Dream as nice memories to a band that have had a big influence on my life as a teenager.<br />(P.s. i'm sorry that my english is a bit poor at times)
B000021YQV|4.0|This L.A. metal band really has a unique sound. Their material is very original and unforgettable, and their performance is so good, that you will soon forget how unique their in-your-face sound is. My favorite tracks on the CD are 'Needles', 'Deer Dance', 'Chop Suey!', 'Forest' and 'Aerials'. Each song has a different style to it, and each is as enjoyable as the last. This is one of the few American metal bands I really enjoy listening to. You cannot compare their music to anyone elses. I take pride in the fact that there are a few American bands that don't go along with everyone elses' sound.
B000069AUI|5.0|...to make an album better than Parachutes.  <br />But they have done it.<br />Magnificent.<br />Absolutely magnificent.  More joyous than Parachutes, but every bit as powerful.<br />Highlights:  \\"The Scientist\\"  \\"Politiks\\" and \\"Warning Sign\\".
B0000640SA|1.0|This review is of the Limited Edition DVD, not the movie itself.  The movie is quite good, but unless you are fanatically devoted to it, get the &quot;regular&quot; edition, not this &quot;Limited&quot; edition.  First of all, the menus are enough to drive you crazy.  I like my menus to be simple and utilitarian; the menus on these DVDs are like a puzzle that you have to solve.  Sure, it's cute the first couple of times, but after that it just gets annoying - especially the ones on disc 2, with the special features (including the &quot;chronological&quot; version of the movie - but more on that below).  I can't stress enough how annoying these are.  Imagine if the remote control to your entertainment system had 85 identically shaped buttons, with no labels on them.  That's kind of how the menus on these DVDs are.  I watch movies to relax; the Memento Limited Edition DVDs are more like a chore.  Trust me, if you're just a casual fan like me, you will not like it.<br />About the chronological version of the movie - yes, it is indeed on Disc 2.  You can find out how to access it by trudging through the puzzling menus, or just looking it up on the internet like I did.  Let me say this: THE CHRONOLOGICAL VERSION OF MEMENTO IS NOT NEARLY AS COOL AS IT SOUNDS!  This version was the reason I bought the Limited Edition, and there are a number of problems with it, beginning with the fact that the only buttons that work during playback are &quot;Pause&quot; and &quot;Stop.&quot;  That's it.  No fast forward or rewind, no slow motion, no subtitles.  Believe me, this gets annoying real fast, especially since the movie begins with the complete end credits - rolled in reverse.  Three minutes never lasted so long (and remember, you can't fast forward through them).  Plus, the chronological version hasn't been re-edited or re-cut, so the scenes appear exactly as in the theatrical version, with the last few lines of each scene repeated as the first few lines of the subsequent scene.You would think they could have put in a little effort to make the transitions more seamless.  And it's not like watching Memento in chronological order is absolutely necessary to understanding it; like The Usual Suspects, The Sixth Sense, and any other movie that requires the viewer to piece together information shown throughout the film, a second viewing of the theatrical version was sufficient for me to fully grasp everything. I didn't get a chance to explore any of the other special features on the Disc; it's just too much of a pain to try and find them.  <br />Bottom line: unless you are a huge Memento fan, save your money and buy the regular edition.  You'll be much happier.
B00000IMCW|5.0|Has to be one of the best all around, When i first saw this movie, It caught my eye ... Reason for this is, Movie's now a day's are ahww[...] They dont have that touch that artist finish..<BR> I hope that one day this movie get the attention that other sorry movies get...............<br />David McNish...<br />When there is no more room in hell, The dead will walk the earth..    &quot;Try to remember where that came from&quot; ...
B00005QHPQ|5.0|I had never head anything by Enrique before this album and I thought it was fantastic.  Very upbeat, difficult to sit still through, even in the car.  My kids think I have lost my mind, since I am much older than the usual fans' ages.
B000002WPI|5.0|Rza's beats are hard and gutter and the Clan flows over them with venom, no more needs to be said about this album, get it if you don't have it.....
6304696566|5.0|Along with Citizen Kane, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Vertigo, and Singin' in the Rain, John Ford's masterpiece, The Searchers, remains one of the best films american cinema has to offer. The DVD is adequate, but the movie so good it hardly matters, in fact the discs greatest asset is that you get to see the film the way it was meant to be with the widescreen transfer. A must buy.
B00005RFAI|3.0|Wow! This CD really impressed me at first. Pink has gone from an uninteresting, ordinary pop star to having her own style. The album is mostly rock, mixed with some pop. My favorite tracks include Don't Let Me Get Me, Just Like A Pill, 18 Wheeler, My Vietnam, and Misery. The only thing is, this album is just so damn depressing (w/the exception of Get The Party Started). In Family Portrait, Pink just spills out her heart a little too much. Some of the lyrics are actually quite funny, even if they're not supposed to be. As she's begging her father to stay with her family, she screams, \\"I DON'T WANT MOM TO HAVE TO CHANGE HER LAST NAME!\\" and then she pleads, \\"I won't spill the milk at dinner.\\" C'mon, you have to chuckle. In 18 Wheeler she actually fights back against her man who is \\"pushing her down\\". But come on, there's only so many times you can listen to this album without an, \\"Oh, please.\\"
B00005JKDR|5.0|This Movie(?) will knock your socks off and off any small person watching it. Every thing about it is terrific, and will need to be seen at least a dozen times to catch all the \\"one-liners\\" that are heard. Watch it, then buy it so's you can watch it again, and again, and again........ You get the picture.
B00004Y87O|4.0|I remember seeing thi smovie  over 20 years ago, and i had my doubts at first. (the idea of kurt\\"disney\\" russel playiong an anti-hero, and what's with soul legend issac hayes as the main baddie? would it be a musical or somethin? lol)<br />But under carpenter's direction,  kurt managed to pull it off and made a beliver outta me, the movie was very ambitous especially coming from a b-movie company (avco embassay)<BR>the specail effects,the chessy dialoug\\" call me snake\\" \\"i heard you were dead\\" and not to mention the cool casioesque synthersizer music. composed by the multi-talented carpenter.<br />The ending is one of the best parts about this classic flick<BR>where anti-hero snake plissken finds some kinda redemption and does a \\"f**k you\\" to the president and the other high ranking athourities. I think it was this movie  (not elvis) that helped<BR>to push russel further into the spotlight,and made people aware of his potentual. after escape, came the thing which was an even bigger hit. and so on.<br />my only gripe with this DVD was that the sound was still kinda mono and there were no special features other than the trailer,<BR>i would have loved to see the deleted scenes like the bank robbery, or the fight  with the indians on world trade center.<BR>oh well what do u expect from MGM? another movie co like warner home video wouldv'e bought out all the bonuses.<br />Now here's a sad irony of how life imitates art, in the begining of the movie u see a terrorist hijacking a passenger plane (air force one) then crashing it into a building, in new york nontheless.. that scene mirrors the tradgic 911 attack.what may seem like science fiction, may turn out to be fact.
6304675348|5.0|Scream is def one of my favorite movies of all time, it has everything, horror, people from small town, coziness and friendship.  I remeber seeing this movie in the theater and people were &quot;screaming&quot; at the right parts.  This was the only movie that I had been to that people interacted with.  I don't understand why the characters keeps making dumb choices, though.  Who would go to get beer alone in a garage at a party when there's a killer on the lose?  I think that this is one of the greatest mystery movies of all time.  The writters' could've foucsed on the main character going into hiding a little more than they did.  Just when you thought it was getting cozy, and she was hiding out it focouses on the killer again. Eventhough it foucuses around teenagers, it is still good enough go capture and adult's attention span.  I don't think any horror movie has been more talked about even years later.  I plan on buying this movie and putting it into my permeant movie collection.  This movie is def a classic, like Halloween was.  Scream will keep your attention from beginng to end!
1587990717|3.0|I bought this book based on a good interview  that the author gave on NPR. In that one hour interview he covered most of the main points in the book. I was dissapointed there was hardly any  detail on what to do to avoid the ways of being stupid the author filled the book with. All together the author leaves a very strong impression that much of what happens in the markets is just random. <BR>  The book holds more prejudice and arrogance than useful information, if you already understand basic probablity theory.  A theme in the book is that most traders don't really protect themselves from sea-changes and one time events becasue their basic methods for calculating risk are too simplistic.<BR>  The book is a quick easy read but it won't help very much in learning how to be a good trader. One man's randomness is another man's ignorance.  I would suggest a book like Richard McCall's The Way of the Warrior Trader is a good antidote to the attitude and lack of practical steps of this book.
B0000027D5|5.0|This is a wonderful look into Santana's jazz/spiritual Coltrane-inspired period. It really shows the transition from the classic Santana band to the newer band, including Tom Coster on keyboards. Carlos is unafraid to do anything, particularly with this band behind him. Some Chick Corea, some classic Santana tunes, a nod to Alice Coltrane (whom Carlos had recently release an album with) and her groud-breaking husband, the late John Coltrane. Leon Thomas adds some wonderful moments to this date. a must-have for Santana fans who want to know if Carlos can handle jazz as well as rock.
B00006AW2J|5.0|As you undoubtedly know if you're reading this review, on August 27 2002 ABKCO finally reissued the Rolling Stones catelogue on CD. While some entries are hit and miss, this disc is an unmatched success, and is one of the most delightful surprises I've heard in a while.<br />Apparently, ALL copy tapes ever used for production versions of this album (and this includes the original vinyl!) were running slow, and were made on incorrectly-calibrated tape machines. This is the first time the original master has been used, and the difference in audio quality is absolutely stunning. It really is *that good*, folks, and if you have any trepidation about upgrading your copy of this milestone album, throw it to the wind. You won't be disappointed.<br />And as an addendum, need I add that my estactic reaction above comes from the CD layer only? All of the Stones reissues are &quot;hybrid&quot; SACD discs; they have two layers, one that will play in normal CD players, and one that takes advantage of Sony's DSD-based SACD format. Apparently, the SACD format is another &quot;night and day&quot; difference as well.<br />In summary: excellent album, and an absolutely amazing upgrade. You won't be disappointed.
B00006EXCC|5.0|In the '60s, American record companies got in the habit of taking LPs from their British artists and lopping off as many as six tracks to create more product.  A pertinent example:  In the UK, \\"Aftermath\\" was the Stones' fourth album.  In the US, it was their seventh, and the second to be released in 1966 (a THIRD LP, \\"Got Live If You Want It!\\", would be released at Christmas).  This was accomplished by throwing three tracks out (\\"Out Of Time,\\" \\"Take It Or Leave It,\\" and \\"What To Do\\") and replacing a fourth, \\"Mother's Little Helper,\\" with the Stones' latest single, \\"Paint It Black.\\"<br />Now, thirty-six years after the fact, here comes the UK \\"Aftermath\\" in its first legit release in the US, on SACD no less, and in true stereo from start to finish to boot.  Like many of the other new Stones remasters, the sound is much crisper and more vibrant--the sound has a lot more definition, and some tracks (like \\"Mother's Little Helper\\") sound so good even on a regular CD player (like mine) that they justify some of the hype that's been flying around.  \\"Mother's Little Helper\\" and \\"Under My Thumb,\\" in particular, are so crisp and well-defined that they made my jaw drop on first hearing, after years of being used to the earlier, somewhat substandard CDs ABKCO released in '86.  Other details that stick out in my mind:  The marimba on both \\"Under My Thumb\\" and the long version of \\"Out of Time\\" (here getting its very first US release), Brian's vicious slide guitar on \\"Doncha Bother Me,\\" the strong lows of Bill's fuzz bass on \\"Think,\\" and the crisp, shimmering acoustics on \\"Lady Jane\\" (check out that dulcimer!) and \\"I Am Waiting,\\" which must be one of the best forgotten songs in the Stones' lengthy repetoire.  Even the cover is different (though in this, I actually prefer the US version to the UK).<br />You need to hear this album in its original track listing to understand why this album has been lauded so often and so loudly, and here's your chance.  Sure, the album has a few bummers (\\"Take It Or Leave It\\" and \\"What To Do\\" will never win any \\"Best Song\\" contests, but they'd have a good shot if anyone gave out awards for uninspired mediocrity), and the long jam on \\"Goin' Home,\\" while not being too awful, only reminds me that jamming ain't the Stones' strong point.  The rest of the album is strong enough to make those problems seem minor.  This may have been the best album released by any English pop/rock group in '66, and, yes, I haven't forgotten \\"Revolver.\\"
B000069AUI|4.0|This album has a little less creative meat than the debut album but still holds its own as a great listen. I miss some of the drum breaks building chords off Parachutes. There is just a different feel overall. This will prove that Coldplay has staying power. Keep it up guys!
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay can now count themselves among such company as Radiohead, U2 ect.   Thier sophomore effort goes deeper than 'Parachutes'.  Its much darker, a lot more creative and improves upon 'Parachutes' in every way possible.  Coldplay have created one of the very best albums of the year, certainly the best record to come out of the U.K. this year. Very highly recommended!
630529142X|5.0|First of all I always wanted to bring home a sleazy chick like Fairuza Balk played. She was sexy. Of course if I had a mama like Kathy, I'd be eating the world's greatest recipes (I ain't kidding! Those Gator burgers had my mouth watering). The movie itself is funny as Adam goes from serving 'high quality H2O', to leading a nothing college to a Bowl game.<br />Kathy Bates and Henry Winkler are both great. It was good to see Henry again in a big movie. I don't care about critics or other viewers, this movie had me rolling.
0380789035|2.0|...but I can honestly say, I don't &quot;get&quot; this book at all. I've made it to page 284 and I've finally set it aside for good.  The premise is good, but the pace of the piece is mind-numbingly slow.  Perhaps it is simply the fact that I do not find the main character -- Shadow -- interesting in any way. I think Gaiman is really trying to write the ultimate road novel, but there is nothing particularly exciting about the journey or about any of the people the main character meets.  The &quot;what is going on?&quot; aspect he is attempting doesn't work for me because of the pace and lack of an interesting hero; so, the suspense which he is obviously trying to build just becomes annoying. I wish I'd liked this book. But when everytime you sit down to read a book and you end up debating  whether to even read the next chapter...well, it just isn't a good sign. So, truth be told, though many consider Gaiman one of the new Gods of literature, I just found this book to be bland, boring and ultimately not worth the time to finish.
B0000683DH|5.0|In the wake of Robert Wise's \\"director's edition\\" of STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE, it was only a matter of time before Nicholas Meyer's STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN was awarded the same treatment. Half a year later, KHAN does indeed get the royal treatment with a 2-disc set loaded with extras and fan tidbits galore. The package includes a slightly extended \\"director's cut\\" of KHAN that restores a critical plot point (namely, the young cadet who dies in Scotty's arms is actually Scotty's nephew) and a few brief clippings of dialogue (mostly back-and-forth exchanges among the main cast); a commentary by Meyer in which he discusses both the film and his approaches to filmmaking; a text commentary by STAR TREK's long-time technical point man Michael Okuda that's packed with more fanboy knowledge than a game of Trivial Pursuit; cast interviews from 1982 (in which Leonard Nimoy wears a pink and white striped suit that makes him look like a pimp); three documentaries covering the making of the film; \\"A Novel Approach,\\" a documentary where TREK authors Julia Ecklar and Greg Cox discuss how KHAN's plot elements spun off into the TREK novels; the film's FX storyboards; and of course, the theatrical trailer. Let's look at each of these:<br />THE DIRECTOR'S CUT OF KHAN - the film makes a bit more sense now that the scenes establishing the doomed cadet as Scotty's nephew have been restored, and the restored dialogue adds a little extra kick to the proceedings (it's especially funny to hear Spock respond to Kirk's telling him about his son with a disinterested \\"Fascinating\\"). But the film is still as tightly structured and fast-paced as it's ever been; the added footage does nothing to slow the film down or to harm the story (although some nit-pickers will make the hilarious claim that the whopping THREE minutes restored to the film \\"butcher\\" it and ruin the pace-how can this be when the added three minutes are spread out over the whole film?). Rather, it gives it a bit morepunch. As for the look of the film, it's certainly a lot cleaner and brighter than most other prints, but even with the digital re-mastering, there's still a lot of visible film grain. Like STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE before it, KHAN looks its age regardless of the print quality. But this is a minor detail. Overall the film looks pretty good.<br />COMMENTARIES - both interesting and enjoyable. Meyer's regular guy vibe and insights into the making of the film are engaging, and Okuda's trivia-heavy text comments are a joy for anyone who thrives on knowing useless fanboy tidbits.<br />CAST INTERVIEWS - a unusual time capsule in which the film's leads plug the film. But let's face it; the coolest thing about this insert is seeing Leonard Nimoy dressed like a pimp. Spock in a pink suit is perhaps the greatest source of laughs you'll ever find.<br />DOCUMENTARIES - by far, the coolest of these is \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before,\\" which covers the stylish FX work ILM did on the film. The giddiness with which the film's FX  crew recalls their work on the film is enormously contagious. \\"Designing KHAN,\\" about the film's costume and set designs, is pretty good, too. \\"Captain's Log,\\" about the overall making of the film, is uneven though. Where Meyer, producer Harve Bennett, and Ricardo Montalban are discussing what went into the making of the film, William Shatner spends his time being a total wiseacre, either mercilessly razzing his pal Nimoy (\\"I think the death scene would have been better if we DIDN'T see him thru the glass!\\" and \\"Oh, he knew he was coming back, he set me up to think he was leaving...I'll get him one day!\\") or joking about how he used women's cosmetics to look younger. And Nimoy is no better, cracking wise about how much older Shatner is than he. (For those of you wondering, this is how they act around each other all the time.) The insight/clowning-around mixture simply doesn't jell. But to be fair, at least Nicholas Meyer is finally acknowledged as the author of KHAN's shooting script, not Jack Sowards as has been erroneously credited. \\"A Novel Approach\\" is interesting, but dry; it bogs down when the authors recite passages from the novels. The moments where they discuss how KHAN formed the backbone of their work and display their fan knowledge are the most enjoyable, even if the supertitles used during the film clips steer too much into jokiness.<br />STORYBOARDS - mind-blowing. We're treated to the conceptual sketches of the film's FX shots (including the combat sequences, which match those in the finished film almost exactly), as well as some terrific concepts for the opening title sequence and the \\"Spock monologue\\" finale that really should have been used in the film. Illustrated by the late Mike Minor, these storyboards read like a really good comic book.<br />THEATRICAL TRAILER - pretty dramatic for a teaser, and it gives a good idea of what the film was going to be.<br />Despite a couple of rocky patches, the \\"director's edition\\" of STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN is a worthy package to a really good film. Highly recommended.
B00006G8G1|5.0|I have been a loyal Maiden fan since 1984, I've been there through there good and bad times. I must say BNW is a return to their former glory i.e. Powerslave/SeventhSon, on different level of course, when you take into account the amount of competative Nu-metal band of the day. I would sure as hell like to see some band attract 250,000 peeps to a show after 20+ years in business, not gonna happen. That just goes to show how Iron (Mr.Harris) Maiden has stuck to his guns and has become a successful business man, for what he believes in (Maiden Music and the fans) of course, not the flavour of the day ... and the commercial agenda of MTV.<br />Anyway onto to the DVD, if you don't have home theater system go out and buy one right now, you will thank your soul for the rest of your life, the sound mix on this DVD is awesome, all i can tell you, if close my eyes, i can almost feel the people around me, the bass and bassdrum slamming into my chest, it feels like i'm at the show literaly, to Mr. Kevin Shirley u r the eminence of audio engineering...You can genuinly tell that there are no over dubs of any sort. Everything sounds like it was recored directly from the amps/pa to the disc in true raw form the way a live band should sound. It even captures, the chord blunders in some of the songs that the guys made and you can tell who screwed up, amazing...<br />There is a slight audio sync to picture problem on the DTS track toward the end of the disc though, barely noticeable, i think you'll only notice if your a musician.
B0000029LG|5.0|The first disc a really great album of course but should have been left off this album. Not only would it have made it cheaper it just would have made more sense. I am not going to review the first album but the second.<br />This is apparently where his huge done fall began. What? Call this a bad album and you don't know good music when you hear it. Sure some songs could have been left off leaving us with 12 killer tracks.<br />Scream brings Michael together with his sister for the second time (first was she was a pretty young thing back up singer on PYT on Thriller.) The track is out of this world as the video for it shows. If you ask me MJ has broken new ground here with its' pulsating beat and chorus that makes you want to scream with it. Top 5 hit.<br />They Don't Care About Us is a great song with powerful lyrics. If you think Michael is too angry then your a bit of a fairy because this is top quality music if I ever heard it. Don't like it cause he's too angry you don't have a clue about music. Wrote and produced himself.<br />Stranger In Moscow. This is one of the best ballads he has ever done if not the best the only competition coming from Earth Song. Peaceful, calm and with a message. I could listen to just this song forever. Plus he wrote and produced it himself. No. 1 Hit<br />This Time Around shows Michael saying this time around he will be more cautious and considering what the critics and press did to him I think he has the right to take no Sh** as he states in this hip hop driven song which shows that Michael would be great alongside top mc's. <br />Earth Song has been called by a critic laughable. If you said that to my face I would punch you. This song is beautiful and Michael has a strong message he is trying to get across. Obviously it worked casue this was a No. 1 Hit all over the world and the video is one of the most requested of all time.<br />D.S. a heavy guitar driven song about Dom Sheldon? I just have one question who is dom sheldon. A bit of a filler but none the less a good song.<br />Money sees Micahel enter a bit of rapping himself. Similar to his style in Dangerous. This song is once again hip hop driven and written by the King himself.<br />Come Together is a remake of the Beatles classic and MJ does a better job than the beatles themselves did. This song was made in the late 80's but only available now. What a pity it could have been a hit when it was first made.<br />You Are Not Alone written by R. Kelly is a good love song. I didn't like this song until a few weeks ago when I realised that the end of the song shows how good Michael Jackson really is when it comes to singing.<br />Childhood. Hate the song but the lyrics have a deep meaning and I think he could have written another verse instead of dragging out the chorus at the end.<br />Tabloid Junikie is unlike anything I have heard before. It sounds like Michael Jackson back in the 80's but has been given a futuristic type effect. Aimed at the press. A really good dance track. Sometimes tough to understand what Michael is saying as he is going so fast.<br />2 Bad. I don't like the intro to the song but the song is brilliant. I especially like Shaq's little rap. I know he is not that good at rapping but his voice just gives the song a powerful song and the way it kicks into Shaq is unbelievable. Really cool and slick dance hip hop dong.<br />HIStory is an epic in itself. The song starts off with varying clips and then kicks into a really funky beat and the way Michael flows with it is exceptional. Then the chorus kicks in which is very different to the rest of the song but I guess it what makes the song so unique.<br />Little Susie and Smile I don't pay any attention to. Then again I have not really given them a chance. I've had this album for 5 years and I have listened to thest songs once or twice and didn't like them. <br />I don't know where critics are getting their MJ is over story from but it ain't from here, It ain't from Invincible and if the 5 songs on BOTDF are anything to go by it ain't from there either. Do yourself a favour and buy yourself this top quality cd. Even if it is a double cd you will hear what made Michael Jackson the King of Pop.
B00006AW2F|3.0|Until now, this has been one of the rarest and most sought-after of the original Stones albums.  Most fans of the group are probably only familiar with the four tracks which appeared on the Singles Collection (\\"Out of Time\\", \\"Try a Little Harder\\", \\"I Don't Know Why\\", \\"Jiving Sister Fanny\\").  These are also the most worthwhile tracks on this CD, which serves to reinforce the fact that many of the Rolling Stones' finest studio moments were in fact already released.<br />Several of early the tracks feature only Mick Jagger backed by some quality session men cutting Jagger/Richards demos for other artists (The heavily orchestrad \\"Out of Time\\" is the most famous example of this).  In fact, there is really nothing notable on this disc until Track 10, a stunning cover of Stevie Wonder's \\"I Don't Know Why\\", reputedly recorded the night Brian Jones died.  Other highlights include \\"Jiving Sister Fanny\\", a hilarious bit of southern boogie and \\"Downtown Suzie\\", a good natured acoustic romp courtesy of Bill Wyman (it really should have made the final cut for Beggar's Banquet).<br />On the down side, we have \\"Sleepy City\\" which sounds like a third-rate Beach Boys knockoff and a rushed, almost robotic-sounding take of \\"Memo from Turner\\".  The closer, \\"I'm Going Down\\", is a fantastic piece of rock and roll (originally recorded for Let it Bleed in 1969) ruined by a horrible mix which renders the vocals all but inaudible.<br />As for sound quality:  INCREDIBLE!!!<br />In the end, this will be a highly welcome addition to any hard-core Stones fan's collection (like me).
B00000K19E|5.0|one of the greatest movie made...it has action and everything else you might want in this movie. the special effects are phenomena. anyone who likes this movie will most diffinately look forward to the sequel
B000002UAX|3.0|Jimi Hendrix or Pink Floyd, the two most innovative groups/musicians in England during the whole pcycadalic scene of 1966-1970. By 1968, the beatles had for the most part exhausted their creative talents, which becomes evident when you listen to &quot;the white album&quot;.....indeed, it is more of the same. Personally, I think there is actually far more musical quality to be found on rubber soul. Having said that, there are a few songs on this album that certainly pass for good, amusing pop tunes, as well as one song, revolution 9, that does indeed constitute a revolution as far as pop music goes. But, having said THAT, why bother. That same year Pink Floyd released A SAUCERFUL OF SECRETS, an album with only seven tracks that easily  surpasses this album in creativity. The year before that they released THE PIPER AT THE GATES OF DAWN, which is a bit like Sgt. Pepper's, only vastly superior. Not to mention the mind blowing ARE YOU EXPERIENCED by Hendrix, released in 67'. But, buy the white album, I guess, I mean its not a total waste....its good to listen to once in a while. Just know that there is better music out there.
B00006FXB6|4.0|Easily the best rock album released in '02. Excellent musicianship, very cool songs. I'm a huge fan of their previous record (R), this one is right up there, if not better. You should buy this.
B0000027I6|2.0|This album is in my collection because 1) I'm a Pink Floyd fan and 2) There are a few great tracks here.  The rest of the album is pretty much unbearable to listen to.<br />\\"The Ballad of Bill Hubbard\\" is a great ambient track and serves as an appropriate opener with a haunting narration from (I believe) a veteran of World War I.  On this track as well as the thundering \\"What God Wants Part I,\\" Jeff Beck contributes some phenomenal guitar playing.  On the latter, his solos are seething and taunting as if he WAS a god.  \\"The Bravery of Being Out of Range\\" is my favorite song here, a harsh indictment against war mongers.  \\"Watching T.V.\\" is good, too.  These are the best songs.  \\"Perfect Sense, Parts I & II\\" are pretty  interesting with beautiful female vocals, but soon become kinda ridiculous and then ridiculously bombastic.  I really can't stand  the rest and it's true that Waters' cynical preaching can be tiresome, not to mention his weak singing voice.  I don't respect any artist who feels the need to diss other artists in their music and he unfortunately takes a mean-spirited jab at Andrew Lloyd-Webber (during an awful song no less).<br />Yes, we watch the world go by on T.V. and many watch war on T.V. like it's some kind of game.  Too bad this album isn't the fantastic indictment on modern life it could have been.
0767840135|5.0|I have been studying the Cirque Du Soleil productions for the past few months. Each time I watch this DVD, I see something new. The music, the athleticism, the choreography, and the lighting are astounding. Attention to detail is an understatement. Everything is so well timed and executed. You won't be disappointed. Buy it and enjoy.
B00005JKOI|3.0|5 stars for this CLASSIC '80s teen movie that pulls off something few teen movies can. It transcends the test of time.<br />0 stars for Paramount's DVD version of this movie. Like virtually all of Paramount's backtitles (just check out their release in September of &quot;My Bloody Valentine,&quot; &quot;The Tenant&quot; or &quot;Don't Look Now&quot;, they put NO SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS or EXTRAS on this DVD! What a monumental 'missing of the boat.' And what an insult to fans of this movie and DVD consumers!<br />Clearly, Paramount doesn't have respect for its own backtitles, preferring instead to put extras mostly on new movies released on DVD. What a shame. &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot; is 16 years old. Let's see if, in another 16 years, anyone remembers the new movies that Paramount chooses to focus on.
B0000683DH|5.0|As a major Star Trek fanatic here in Las Vegas NV USA Home of Star Trek:The Experience, I have to highly recommend Star Trek II:The Wrath of Khan (dir.ed.)or to us fellow &quot;trekies&quot; or &quot;trekers&quot; ST II:TWOK.  The added footage which was cut out of the original and now replaced along with the text comentary option from Micheal Okuda (when selected) made this DVD a MUST have to any Star Trek movie collection.  This version is so much better than either the origianl VHS video or the orginal DVD which was no more than a straight video to DVD transfer. All the extras that have been included on the bonus disk (disk 2) are well worth it. I have now purchased both Star Trek:The Motion Picture and now Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.  In November Star Trek III:The Search for Spock is scheduled for release as a &quot;Special ed. or Dir's. cut. I can hardly wait for that.
B000001FS3|5.0|Why do people love electrical storms? There's a certain spark in the air, a surge of movement that's out of our control, one that allows us to feel as though we are willingly partaking in some form of natural risk. By making the Joshua Tree, U2 took such a risk, and not just artistically or musically. Bono himself declared in 1987 \\"that the thought of people waiting for The Joshua Tree is ridiculous. It sounds as though it'll sell three copies.\\" I can see his point. At the time, it sounded like nothing else on mainstream radio. Instead, you had an album that sounded like it was derived from some kind of spiritual fall-out. It sounded too natural, too organic to compete with the artifice that was running rampant all over the charts at the time (and still is). No other album that I've heard embodies such an earthiness, while also revealing the other-worldliness by which The Joshua Tree has been designed. Like much of Leonard Cohen's material, for example, there is a spirituality found on this record that doesn't deny the physical. It's a spirituality that isn't afraid of getting its hands dirty. Yet, there is a stillness, a serenity on The Joshua Tree, despite the harshness and intensity that permeates the record. It's as if the album has indeed been woven through the eye of the storm -- as though the album understands and replicates, in an organic sense, the line Bono would pen years later on Achtung Baby in the song 'So Cruel': \\"Head in heaven, fingers in the mire.\\" The Joshua Tree lives these lines; and as is conveyed in songs like 'Red Hill Mining Town', there is a sense that, despite being \\"so cruel,\\" life is still worth \\"holding onto,\\" and sometimes is \\"all that's left to hold onto...\\" (Perhaps the themes of Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby aren't so different after all?) <br />From the opening hymn-like organ intro of 'Where The Streets Have No Name' -- as it glides effortlessly into a tidal-wave of relentless explosion -- to the sublime beauty of songs like 'One Tree Hill', there is nothing but perfection; a musically cinematic perfection of an imperfect world striving past the pain and desperation felt throughout this album, and into the metaphysical sense of joy. Songs like 'Running To Stand Still' work so well because one is placed right into someone else's world in such a manner that it becomes your world -- or at least in a manner that gives you the sense that it could be your world. The Joshua Tree takes you to the scene of the crime, the very place of confusion, where emotion splits into mood and allows you to feel fragments coming together again. This album doesn't just tell you about something; it allows one to experience it. There is something going on inside the texture of the album that reveals this. Bono's falsetto, for example, has never sounded the same before or since The Joshua Tree. There is a mystical quality about it, as though it has traveled for miles and miles through the wide open desserts, the dense political jungles and forests throughout the record. The listener is carried through real life images of American foreign policy ('Bullet The Blue Sky'), the desperation of drug addiction ('Running To Stand Still'), and the very real emptiness behind suicide ('Exit'); yet despite it all, in many of the very same songs you will find an undying, underlying hope, an urge to transcend the very darkness of this album into the silver light found on 'Streets'. Even a slippery little love song such as 'With or Without You' comes from somewhere else completely, the pain of it feeding the very need to reach past the flesh of this album. Nothing on The Joshua Tree sounds commercial, yet it is one of the most commercially successful albums of all time. <br />Somewhere back in 1987, U2 found the very breath of their ability and filled their lungs with it. The Joshua Tree is the sound of the exhale, the consequence of their risk -- the fallout of the mystical -- scattered across miles of terrain. And, on this disc, weare lucky enough to breathe it all in again -- to go, to quote Van Morrison, back \\"into the mystic\\" -- to, in a sense, actually take that breath back to where it came from: here, we go back into the eye of the storm, back into that stillness that can't be defined by the written word, but can be felt by the right music. Where does the music on The Joshua Tree come from? Some would say U2. Others would say, simply, ourselves. It may be that neither answer is incorrect. It could be from somewhere in the middle, from somewhere in that eye, where we face the music on all fronts -- where the storm of the album's landscape, and the music that flows through that landscape, become each other -- forming a sustaining tension, one that somehow continually dissolves and yet builds on itself. And so we are left feeling out of control, yet calm; sad, yet elated; disturbed, yet peaceful; and angry, yet somehow accepting. That's the paradox of The Joshua Tree, and also why it's the greatest album of all time.
B000002J1B|4.0|I lost touch with Yes after &quot;Drama&quot;. That album, fronted by the ghastly Buggle Trevor Horn, was where the well ran dry. I spent my youth enthralled by &quot;Fragile&quot; and &quot;Close To The Edge&quot;, both from the band's &quot;classic&quot; period. <br />Back then, I was hostile to &quot;Relayer&quot;. Bruford's departure was a huge blow for me, but more significantly, the musical texture had utterly changed. A certain warmth had gone, and in its place was a chilly, metallic futuristic jazz feel. At times the record is tough, even scary to experience (&quot;Sound Chaser&quot; is just astonishing). Listening to it now, I would argue that it is the band's most radical and daring experiment. They could, I feel, have taken this approach (verging on jazz fusion) much further in subsequent releases. The warmth returned in the very fine &quot;Going For The One&quot;. <br />&quot;Relayer&quot;'s searing, angular beauty stands alone in the band's catalogue. These days, I'm in awe of the sheer audacity of it. A terrible beauty is born.
B000069AUI|4.0|I really wanted to give this albulm 5 stars.  However this is not the perfect albulm.  It is however a great albulm.  Coldplay has managed to write incredibly personal songs that sound good and are meaningful.  It doesn't matter who you are, you will identify with at least one song on the albulm.  The band tackles deep issues of love and world issues while still helping you to relate.  The songs are wonderfully beautiful and all around likeable.  I recomend this albulm to everyone, no matter what styles you may like, you can appreciate this cd.
B00005YXZH|1.0|Yuck. There's no other way to describe this pile of garbage. If this is what I have to look forward to from Wilco from now on they might as well throw in the towel now while they still have some dignity left and leave us with the other outstanding albums they've done like Being There.
0316666343|5.0|What a beautiful book!  Thanks to Alice Sebold for this achingly brilliant portrayal of what loss takes away and gives back to the people around us.
B00005QY5Y|3.0|There's nothing special here. Just fairly  standard, mindless pop music. The next Bob Dylan? Hah. No comparison. Dylan is innovative, edgy and challenging, all things that Ryan Adams is not, at least on this album. Let's hope for better things in the future.
B00004W50T|5.0|When I first heard the songs on this album, I thought The Band had covered a bunch of old American folk songs in a rock style. Then I bought the lp, scoured the credits, and realized that they had written all of the songs themselves (with the exception of &quot;Long Black Veil&quot;). These songs sound like they come from the heart of Appalachia, or the Mississippi delta. They tap into some some timeless American musical vein that will forever remain fresh.<br />And the musicianship! Levon's drumming and singing throughout... Richard Manuel's achingly beautiful vocals on &quot;Tears of Rage&quot; ... the ragged but right harmonies of &quot;The Weight&quot;... Robbie Robertson's exquisite guitar solo on &quot;To Kingdom Come&quot;... Garth Hudson's manic organ intro to &quot;Chest Fever&quot;. And how about a round of applause for the unsung sixth member, producer John Simon. He was obviously an integral part of their unique sound, and now he should get the credit he deserves.<br />On this album, each member of The Band subsumed his ego to serve the songs, and they never again hit the perfect combination of relaxed, good-timey vibes with incredible rock 'n' roll energy. This is a record I will enjoy as much when I am eighty years old as I did when I was in college.<br />The bonus tracks are a nice addition. They practically double the length of the original album, and while their quality is not up to the original songs, they definitely add a lot of value to the package. Kudos to Capitol Records for putting out an excellent reissue. The liner notes are outstanding, and the sound quality is top-notch.
B00006GFAB|5.0|This is the best KISS compilation. A perfect introduction for those who are curious and a good mix tape for the die-hards. It's better than Smashes, Thrashes and Hits and Greatest Kiss because it goes longer.  All The way up to 1992.    The versions on this CD are the original ones.    Which means \\"Rock and Roll All Nite\\" is the live version from Alive.  All but one of their Top 40 hits are here (1978's \\"Rocket Ride\\" from AliveII is missing).  Also \\"New York Groove\\" is indeed the Ace Frehley hit from 1978.  KISS fans may find something missing.  A track from the 80's like \\"Heaven's On Fire\\" could be here, as could a 70's one like \\"Black Diamond\\".  One caveat:  their are NO liner notes here.  Just Album info for each song.  It would be nice if Mercury would put liner notes on one of these KISS collections.  At over an hour, though, this is a great introduction to the KISS legend.
0380977788|5.0|So far, I haven't read anything by Neil Gaiman that I didn't enjoy, and Coraline is no different. This is one of the most charming books I've read recently, and like everything else written by Gaiman, it is witty and funny, yet creepy and disturbing at the same time. And while Coraline was written for children, I haven't yet heard any adult complain about it. I haven't asked any kids what they thought about it, but I'm sure kids would have just as much fun as your average adult, if not even more (though maybe not as a bedtime story...).<br />Coraline is the story of a young girl. A bored, polite, smart little girl, who goes exploring on a rainy day, and obviously runs into trouble. A lot of trouble. But there's more to \\"Coraline\\" than that. Gaiman has a wonderful way with words, which never ceases to amaze me (and of course, causes me to ask myself how come I can't write like that), and his dark sense of humor and witty simplicity makes reading \\"Coraline\\" a treat for anyone (for example: \\"She might want something to love... Something that isn't her. She might want something to eat as well. Its hard to tell with creatures like her.\\").<br />You simply can't help but to fall in love with Coraline, and the entire book. And obviously, Dave McKean's artwork makes this book even more fun to read.
0767803434|1.0|Now I like action movies like the next guy and am not particularly demanding of them (Fugitive, Die Hard being my favs) but this one had me considering leaving the theater early for the first time in a decade.    The plot is so unbelievable that I couldn't suspend any disbelief. A 40-yr-old president taking on professional commando in his 20s for hand-to-hand combat repeatedly? Guns blasting everywhere in an airplane? It was also *needlessly* violent with execution-style scenes. Glenn Close was wasted mostly acting like an indecisive babbler.    On the plus side, special effects were decent and there was one clever move by the president.
B0000524CY|5.0|A good, scary film about demonic possession.  This is not a film about dead-teens, bloody ax murders, and naked nubile bimbos.  This is a horror drama with realistic charactors portrayed by wonderful actors.  The terror in the film is effective and works on many different levels:  There is the actress/single mom who doesn't know what is wrong with her daughter, there are the endless visits to the hospital which creates its own steril, cold horror, then there is the demon.  The story builds and takes its time, so don't expect some cheap-shot gruesome murder in the opening 5 minutes.  This is not a film for those with a 12-year-old mentallity who want to see bimbos & gore.  This is a film for those who have seen real horror films like \\"The Haunting (1963), The Innocents, The Other, Rosemary's Baby, etc.  The \\"new & improved\\" CGI additions were unecessary and all wrong.  The original cut was best but this is still a great film.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Ok, everyone knows Norah is the typical product of musical majors. She has a soft and whispering voice. She is nice and young. She sings sweet songs about love and loneliness. She is the daughter of Ravi Shankar. Everything about her is made to let suckers fall in love almost immediately. However, do you know something? I am that kind of sucker. I love this CD, and of course I fell in love with her after 45 seconds of \\"Don't know why\\". Now I am looking forward to see her performing in Europe. WOW
0345448898|4.0|What a tremendous trilogy! Quite original--daemons, beautiful witches, bears in armor...At the end, I cried worse than I ever had for any other book (I'm over 20 yrs old now and have read quite a lot of books). Was the ending the perfect outcome for our two heros...I'm still conteplating whether it is. But it succeeded in one thing--making me think about it nonstop for days.<BR>Another problem I have with this trilogy is the lack of breathers for our characters. Everything happened so fast and there was so little or no comic relief to offset the urgency and darkness of the story that it all became too overwhelming at times. <BR>But at the same time, the reason why I love this trilogy so much is because of the characters. I simply fell in love with Lyra and Will and it was wonderful to see them develop into the mature people they became.<BR>There is only one trilogy I know of that I love better--one that I've grown up with and reread over and over again and has stayed in my heart since I was twelve years old--and that's--no, not the Lord of the Rings--but Patricia A. Mckillip's The Riddle Master trilogy. And that alone says a lot about what I think of Pullman's trilogy.
6305508550|5.0|if i could videotape just one day at my workplace, it would be a perfect scene-to-scene copy of office space. never has a movie potrayed cubicle life more than this little gem. watch it. it is a movie you can relate to, and understand. Also has a strong supporting cast with good comedic performances which include a funny talking asian (ajay naidu as Samir Nayeenanajar?) and a gangsta rappin' white guy (David Herman as Michael Bolton?) and a sweet and subdued role by jennifer aniston. the printer scene is legendary.
0425107469|4.0|Watchers is some seriously fun Koontz. To add `with a heart' would be pointless because that describes everything he writes. Unfortunately `great' doesn't describe everything he writes but it sure does this one. <br />One of his early works, Watchers shows clearly the formula pattern Koontz employs in all his books. Yes, this becomes very tiresome later on in his career (though some real brilliance shines through later as he matures), but this story is fun from start to finish. The simple fact is that Koontz writes a great story. His dialogue comes from some other planet but is easily overlooked in most of his work. This guy loves to tell a story and he tells a great on almost every attempt.  His love, and inclusion in all his stories, of animals goes far to forgive him his few transgressions as a writer.<br />You'll cheer for these characters, race to end of the book, and then feel genuinely sorry you've reached it. This is bubblegum for the brain at its very best.
6305499365|4.0|Office Space, starring Ron Livingston and Jennifer Aniston and directed by Mike Judge (the creator of Beavis and Butthead), is indeed a very funny comedy about work and how boring it could be. For a straight hour and a half you'll be treated to a pure helping of jokes, each which will succeed in making you laugh. With pure Beavis and Butthead humor, Mike Judge's comedy is a winner and deserves to be seen by all comedy fans. Featuring a good cast that includes Stephen Root and John C. McGinley, Office Space is a comedy that you must go out and rent now! Satisfaction guaranteed. <br />Ron Livingston plays a character named Peter Gibbons, a computer guy who works at a company called Initech. He has eight bosses so every time he makes the smallest mistake, he is commented eight times. After several incidents, Peter becomes stressed and decides to go for therapy. When he comes out he decides not to go to work and start enjoying his life.  He tries to spend more time with his girlfriend (Aniston, The Good Girl) and only comes to work to wreck stuff and play games on his computer. However, this attitude lands him a promotion and some of his partners get fired. Anxious for revenge, Peter and his partners decide to perform a scam to steal money from this computer company. Every time the company transfers money, they will get a fraction of every penny. However, instead of the fraction of a cent they're supposed to get, they wind up with over 350,000 dollars. Now, they must figure out away to get themselves out of this situation and not get Gibbons fired.<br />I won't wreck the ending for you but this truly is a great comedy.  The performances are satisying.  Ron Livingston, who we don't see much these days, gives a very good performance as Peter and Jennifer Aniston provides us with a good performance as a waitress and Peter's girlfriend.  John C. McGinley (starring now in the TV show Scrubs) gives a star-making performance as one of Peter's bosses and there are several cameos by people such as Orlando Jones.    The movie is destined to become a comedy classic if people would just not miss it when passing the comedy section at the video store.  Maybe it is a bit over-rated but you still got to see it. Mike Judge is simply a comedic genius. The only bad part about it is that it didn't go on. Comedy fans, this is a must for you.<BR>A satifying and hilarious comedy!<br />Title: Office Space<BR>Actors/Actresses: Ron Livingston, Jennifer Aniston, Stephen Root, John C. McGinley.<BR>Director: Mike Judge<BR>Rated R for scenes of strong language, crude and sexual humor, and brief nudity.
0451169514|5.0|This should tell you something.....despite having, hands down, the worst final few pages of any King book IT remains the best pure horror novel he has yet written. While Bag Of Bones is (in my mind) the best novel overall, IT is the best in many respects. Never, ever have the fragile, bittersweet relationships between childhood friends been so beautifully painted by any other author I've read, and I've read tons. Oddly, miraculously, and suprisingly this portrait of childhood life is sprinkled like wonderful pure snow into an absolute inferno of horror. I mean this book will scare the hell out of ANYONE. Forget the appallingly pathetic TV movie that happened to have the same name (a sham of an adaptation).....this book will blow your mind, slam your back against a wall, keep you looking over your shoulder (literally), and smile (or sometimes weep) at memories it evokes of your own childhood friendships. <br />As powerful as a wizard with a wand or God with 7 days to kill, so is Stephen King with the pen. Bow down folks because there is no better and there will never be another.

The oblivious residents are preparing for a party, while evil is lurking about in a mist waiting to strike. Lock your doors, close your windows, and do not open the door for anyone.  The Fog is an eerie cinematic experience that will present some chilling moments.
1586210912|5.0|At first I was really skeptical about the claims of this book but after I read it, I realize Kyosaki makes a lot of sense. Itfs true that most of the information and advice here are quite general and broad; this book is meant for those who are just starting to take a hard look at their financial situation in life. Rich Dad Poor Dad is a perfect stepping stone for the beginner in the finance game.<br />Although I only read his book recently, most of the advice handed down in this book is what I have done in my professional life. I quit my job several years ago to form my own company and at the same time began investing and studying in different businesses. Although I can't claim to be rich I'm happy to say that I'm well off and my investments and my research paid off. This is exactly what Robert wants more people to think and do, go out and learn how business and money works. Work for yourself instead for others and learn the more practical aspects of handling your financial situation<br />I recommend this book to those who are interesting in making the first step to their financial freedom.
630460291X|3.0|If one were rating the movie itself, this would probably be a \\"4\\". It's not a bad retelling of the myth, though it does drive the historian in me insane with its inaccuracies. It has heart and it has cool treehouses and the neatest archery effects this side of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" (though impossible ones at times). It starts with Robin in a Jerusalem jail and adds in a black Muslim with a warped sense of humor. It has a blind man in it who has more courage than most sighted folks. It has Maid Marian dressed like a ninja trying to kill Robin (where DOES all that courage and martial skill go when the Sheriff's trying to rape her?). Unfortunately, it has a medieval birthing scene, and I just can't forgive the producer this -- it didn't add anything to the movie, and just squicked me royally. And then there's the acting.. or one actor's acting, anyway. Kevin Costner's worse at showing emotion than Keanu Reeves. Everybody around him is showing sadness, joy, hate, and the best he can come up with is a totally monotonous, non-emotional, deadpan delivery of stilted lines like \\"Did I offend you in a past life, Will Scarlett? What did I do to inspire such hatred?\\", in the face of Christian Slater's overwhelming, beautifully portrayed anger and grief. I don't know who convinced Costner that this would be a great way to portray Robin, but whoever did it needs to be reprimanded.<br />It's still a decent movie. But the DVD edition of it is clearly a rushed affair. There are very few goodies on it, and it is two-sided for no particular reason that I could discern. It's widescreen, which is nice, but that two-sided thing is irritating as all get-out. At least on VHS it doesn't make me get up and switch tapes!<br />I can't recommend this DVD edition, pretty much. Maybe they'll come out with a deluxe edition, or tweak it so it's just one sided or something. Till then, I'd hang onto my money.
0425107469|5.0|Love and hope is a common thread in Koontz' books, but it is never done better than in this one. Koontz is a master storyteller and wordcrafter of the first order.<br />Koontz weaves an interesting read about government conspiricies, a dog that can type on a keyboard, romance, and thrilling scenes of action and witty repartee.<br />Words don't do Koontz justice!!!
0790729644|4.0|Absolutely one of the greatest westerns of all time!  HOWEVER, the DVD leaves a lot to be desired.  For instance, it's practically impossible to figure out how to get to the menu page and the box implies that there are two theatrical trailers which [I could not find]!  Great movie but disappointing special features.
B00003CXZ1|1.0|This movie was one of the worse things I've seen since oh I can't even remember.  Best Described by the whinny words of Luke Skywalker, &quot;What a Piece of Junk&quot;  and the worse part is.  No one can stand up for this thing and say, &quot;She'll make .5 past lightspeed&quot;  Or anything else that is good.  The best thing the movie had to offer was a remix of U2's Elevation.

B00005JKES|4.0|Leave it to a Lynch project to bring out the obsessives. Who cares about the stupid pilot? I don't remember seeing it when the series was on TV, and that never bothered me. <br />Anyway, Twin Peaks was good stuff. Funny, well-made, and bizarre. Hasn't been anything like it since.
B00006FXB6|4.0|Contrary to most recent reviews of this band, I do not consider them a 'metal' band so let's just drop this label, shall we?  QOTSA have been refining this unique-but-not-so-new sound of theirs for several years now, and \\"Songs For The Deaf\\" sounds like the album they've always wanted to make.  This third full-length release showcases more of the sonic flexing heard on \\"R\\" than the dense fuzz of their debut, while still maintaining a melodic tension that they have certainly mastered in a style that is as modern as it is reminiscent. Phantoms of great 1970's bands float through here (Slade, Gary Glitter, Black Sabbath,) and I would compare this to some of the less heavy (Ozzy-era) Sabbath albums, all of which have merit. (And they got Dave Grohl to play drums - how cool is THAT?)  Sure, some of screaming bassist Nick Olivera's cuts flail with unrestrained angst (\\"Six Shooter\\") yet guitarist Josh Homme (a great singer, by the way) levels the playing field with several layered dreamy songs like \\"No One Knows.\\" Former Screaming Trees vocalist Mark Lanegan adds a stark dimension with cuts like the brooding \\"Hangin' Tree\\" whose taut loping snap sounds reminiscent of the Jesus Lizard (note the jazzy 5/4 time signature).  I'll enjoy listening to this with headphones, since Homme's production pays careful sonic attention to each cut, creating way too much personality to be lumped into the typical 'metal' category (which we all know it will - and has) with all the attendant tired adjectives.  The radio chatter in between songs lends to the stylistic variation of this material, while doubling as a jab against the scourge of commercial radio.  (Maybe \\"Another Love Song\\" will actually get some airplay?) I plan to play this loud and often so it can settle in deeply like their last great disc.<br />A friend watched the DVD and it has live tracks and interviews.  They will be touring with Failure's drummer Kelli Scott (who kicks ass) on the upcoming tour.

B00006AW2G|5.0|I just finished listening to the new remastered version of 'Let It Bleed' and I must say I'm shocked by how good it sounds.  I don't have the old CD version with me right now to compare but it sounds to me like it was recorded yesterday.  Unfortunately I don't have an SACD player to review the SACD layer of the disc.  From all reports it's supposed to sound better than the redbook CD layer by quite a bit even.  I highly recommend this disc to anyone just starting their Stones collection or even to someone who already has the old CD of this album.
0786867973|4.0|How To Be A Domestic Goddess is either a good bad book, or a bad good book.Others have said that they have found some errors in the American version.

However, they are unleavened.Yes, I really wish the American edition had not been rushed into print, and that the recipes had been more thoroughly tested.However, not all of the recipes are flawed.  I have baked for many years, and can tell when a recipe is seriously off.  So can most expierenced home bakers.  Novices, beware.Not all of the dishes are depending on precise chemical mixtures, so this book still has merit.I found the endpapers to be a highly funny, very satiric depiction of media derived &quot;domestic goddesses&quot; from the 1950s-60s in England.  These enpapers were misconstrued in England, as an anti-feminist statement.  They are not, they are meant ironically.Nigella Lawson does not order anyone into the kitchen.  She wants to invite you in to the kitchen, to play, to laugh, to socialise, and perhaps even to learn.
0792839730|3.0|My problem with this movie is that it tries to do too much. Operation Market Garden was a fatally flawed plan to end World War II by seizing a series of bridges with paratroops and rushing an armored column over them to attack Germany from an exposed flank. In order to depict this series of events, the attacks on the various bridges, the film is necessarily episodic. There is no unifying theme and no central characters, and is thus more of a documentary than a &quot;war movie&quot;. Not that it's a bad film: it depicts the events fairly accurately, is well cast and has combat sequences that hold up very well. I'm glad that it is in my DVD library, but, as noted, there are better films.
B00005JKL8|2.0|In short, it has some nice cinematography and a very nice CGI shoot-down scene. Otherwize it was technically off, and for me, it's hard to take Owen Wilson as an action hero. He's great as a comedic actor and I'd be interested to see him in a serious role, but this wasn't quite right. Gene Hackman is, as always, great as the hard-nosed (insert rank here) military man.
B00006AFUR|5.0|The debut album is really as good as I thought it would be.<BR>Featuring their single \\"Capricorn\\" the music is reminiscent of Tool and pink floyd, if only for its otherwordly hugeness.<BR>The songs are metaphorical, interesting and immense in the sense that they carry a musical weight akin to great soundracks almost as though you are listening to it in a space shuttle looking out onto Mars.<BR>I'd definately recommend buying the album its a great piece of work...
B00006GFAB|5.0|If you take a look at the list of tracks on this cd, and are already familiar with them, you'll think to yourself &quot;Allright, a rockin' cd.&quot;  That is true.  When you listen to it you'll think &quot;This is awesome!&quot;  And that is true.  And the cover is spectacular as well.  That's why I give it five stars.  However, for the diehard Kiss fans you will think &quot;Why do I need 'I Was Made For Lovin' You' for the 5th time in my collection?&quot;  Paul Stanley stated that the record company wanted this out, so they got involved.  The only thing I can think of is that they saw the success of The Beatles '1', and saw that the Who and Barbra Streisand had fair success with their recent 'hits' collections, and that Elvis and the Rolling Stones are riding high with theirs as well.  I have it to be a completist of my Kiss cd collection.  It is a good listen, as there are no bad tracks on it at all.  Kiss can be quit pleased with their work since 1973, as it has been quit an extrordinary ride for the guys.  To sum it all up, for the casual rock fan this ROCKS.  For the Kiss fan it ROCKS, but why did it need to come out?
6304712936|5.0|This movie is absolutely fabulous. A historical movie is very difficult to make, but this one was masterfully done. Never mind that it's probably not totally correct. This film will should go down in the annals as one of the most fitting tributes ever made.<BR>Obviously, this movie tells the story of Mozart, but it has a very unique approach--it tells it through the eyes of a man named Salieri, a contemporary of Mozart's. Sometimes jealous, sometimes awestruck, Salieri recounts the story of Mozart's life with a splendid display of raw emotion. The whole narrative is wonderfully infused with Mozart's own music, which adds greatly to the impact and emotion of the film.<BR>The acting in this film was great, and the costumes extraordinary. This movie definitely deserved all the awards it received.<BR>This is a wonderful movie that was rated PG, but now has a director's cut that has given it an R rating. Either way, it is very intriguing story about a musical genius. This film is perhaps as entertaining and brilliant as Mozart himself was.
0316666343|3.0|To me, that best describes this book. I, unlike most others, picked up the book, read the inside jacket and figured it sounded good. I must have missed all the media hype!! To me, this book was about lost relationships and regrets. Hopefully this won't sound corny but it made me think of what legacy I'd like to leave behind to those who love me and what I would like to accomplish before its over. I found the book long winded and a bit contrived while trying hard to be original. I put it down and picked it up several times. I didn't find it hard hitting or emotional until the last few chapters. I cried hard as I finished the book. But I really didn't expect that kind of response from me early or even mid-way through the book. The parts where she's in Heaven... well... I wasn't impressed. But overall I gave it 3 stars because of the ending.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I basically have a rule of three.  If I am reviewing the tracks of a CD for which I am unfamiliar and I like three of the tracks I consider it worth trying and buying.  A first time listener of Norah Jones made me an instant fan.  I bought the Come Away with Me CD and am captivated with each and every track.  Not a bad song on the album.  She may be a newcomer but her voice is hauntingly unique. . .possessing rich qualities of some of the best Blues / Jazz singers of the past.  I have gone back to buy more of the same CD to give as gifts.  Everyone I have gifted have also become instant fans of Ms. Jones.
B0000640VN|4.0|Kate and Leopold is one of those adult fairy tales set in modern times.  At least partially so!  Director James Mangold chooses to focus not on the story of time travel, as discovered by a<br />nondescript New Yorker bachelor who travels through a &quot;portal&quot; (Liev Schreiber, apt and amiable), but rather on the romantic events of the Duke he brings back with him to the future.<br />That Duke, Leopold, as played by Hugh Jackman, has traveled some 130 years in time, from late 19th century New York, where he lived as a titled British transplant, searching for love and wealth...and finding neither.  Naturally, in the most serendipitous of ways, he meets Kate (Meg Ryan), a marketing research exec, fiercely career-oriented, but as vulnerable underneath as Meg Ryan was in &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot; and &quot;You've Got Mail&quot;.  Unfortunately, her hairdo leaves something to be desired, and her choice in clothing is mannish and severe, but Ryan's charm makes Jackman's crush believable.<br />Your surprised that Tom Hanks has been supplanted by Hugh Jackman.  Hugh Jackman?  Nah...wasn't he a hairy super-hero in X-Men?  You'd think he was playing against type until you see his performance here.  He's marvelous.  Believable, confident, playing this role as Ben Affleck never could, Jackman gets the largest round of applause for making this movie a commercial and DVD success. He's immersed himself in 19th century manners, etiquette and deportment, but is still vulnerable and kind.  The movie plays for laughs somewhat, on his introduction to timeless Americana such as ketchup, Tater Tots, and scooping up the dog doo after you walk your monster dog in Manhattan.<br />If the real market research experts are watching, Affleck, etal., may never win another romantic lead again!<br />So, of course, there is the crisis, the separation, and eventually the film finds a way to end happily.  Bradley Whitford of The West Wing is terrific as JJ, Kate's supercilious and vain boss, and I love Brecklin Meyer as Kate's brother...he's thick enough not to realize that Jackman isn't just acting his historical role, yet bright enough to realize that he has just as much ability to be charming as Leopold, once he figures out how to lose the attitude.<br />I liked the film a lot!oss, and I love Brecklin Meyer as Kate's brother...he's thick enough not to realize that Jackman isn't just acting his historical role, yet bright enough to realize that he has just as much ability to be charming as Leopold, once he figures out how to lose the attitude.<br />I liked the film a lot!
B00003CXTG|2.0|Let me start off by saying that few things interest me as much as history, especially World War II.  I love war movies and usually enjoy them all.  This movie was an exception.  I was reluctant to go see pearl harbor at first, mostly because Josh Hartnett was in it.  I'm not a big fan of his movies.  However, I went because it was a war movie.......my mistake.  It turned out to be a long, drawn-out, sappy romance much akin to titanic(which says more than enough).  I slept through much of the movie and am quite glad I did.  The only part of the movie that merits any praise is the actual bombing of Pearl Harbor.  This scene was impressive, and yes, I was awake.  One other part that I liked was the scene where the crew of a U.S. vessel is trapped underwater after the raid, some good drama.  However,these scenes were sandwiched by the horrible love story.  Maybe rent it just for the bombing/dog-fight scenes, but for the love of God don't buy it.  You'll never forgive yourself.
B000002BMV|5.0|Like many others who visit this wonderful site and review albums, I have hundreds of CDs in my music collection--meaning of course that I love a lot of music.  If someone held a gun to my head and asked me to pick my favorite out of my entire collection, this one might be it.  In a nutshell, this is just about the greatest classic rock and melodic rock albums of all time!<br />&quot;Don't Stop Believin'&quot; still brings goosebumps to this day with its melodic and anthemic sound.  &quot;Stone In Love&quot; may be the ultimate Journey rocker with its crunching guitars and spine-tingling messages of youth remembered.  &quot;Who's Crying Now&quot; is an emotional, classic ballad with that all-time famous minute and a half mournful ending guitar solo.  &quot;Keep On Runnin'&quot; is a catchy melodic rocker.  &quot;Still They Ride&quot; is a mystical, emotional ballad/anthem.  The title track &quot;Escape&quot; is a fantastic, over the top hard rocker.  &quot;Lay It Down&quot; and &quot;Dead Or Alive&quot; continue the amazing hard rock.  &quot;Mother, Father&quot; is an amazingly emotional anthem.  Then comes the famous closing track, the beautiful, touching &quot;Open Arms&quot;.<br />For sure, Jonathan Cain brought a bit more of a &quot;pop side&quot; to this band that came out on this record.  But with Steve Perry's vocals at their melodic, piercing best and Neal Schon's guitar work expressing seemingly every human emotion in the book, the rock side is very much present on this album as well.  The blend of rockers and ballads is PERFECT.  <br />In a nutshell, you could not ask for a better rock record--in any era.  I went through two cassettes of this album as a kid and later got the CD.  Now I really need to get the remastered version of this CD.  Everyone from soft rock lovers to metal heads loved this album when I was growing up.  This is an absolute MUST-OWN for classic and melodic rock fans.  I cannot recommend it enough.
B000069AUI|5.0|Incredible!!! Best  album since OK Computer. It's that good and every song is a classic. While I may share a lot of Thom's world views it is nice to hear lyrics that are so positive.
B0000024JN|2.0|This album was supposed to be called \\"Don't be a Faggot\\" originally.  Does this say something about the mentality of the Beastie Boys at the time?  Not that we should blame them.  They've apologized, and they've gone on to create way more positive music and contributed to causes that more than makes up for this one album they made as young guys in the 80's.  <br />The question is this;  Why should we keep listening to a piece of music that is dated and offers no redeeming value whatsoever?  Why does this album continue to be a staple of parties and the soundtrack for every jock and frat boy in middle America?  I'm not uptight and I'm not a prude, but somewhere we have to take responsibility and stop filling our heads with ideas that oppress others.  <br />The one good thing about this album is that it brought rap to new popularity, and songs like Slow and Low or No Sleep Till Brooklyn certainly do bring back an era of 808 drum machines and goofy guitar samples.  But honestly, the Beastie Boys created much better music than this after the fact.  Paul's Boutique was more artistic, even though it still retained some of the sexism.  Check Your Head and Ill Communication were masterful blendings of urban style, culminating in a sound that cannot be duplicated and will never be topped.  Hello Nasty is a brilliant piece of pure hip hop, which totally destroys everything on this album.  <br />Check Your Head.  Enjoy the music, but think about what you're listening to.
B00000272N|5.0|Even though I say it's the worst of the 3 (which is a pity that Alice in Chains are \\"Over Now\\" for real) Alice in Chains cds, it's still supercedes any imitative copier band of these days like Staind or Creed. Gosh, just mentioning those unoriginal, uncreative, fiendishly short-on-ideas bands makes me hate them all over again. I digress. <BR>I find Dirt AND Tripod(AiC) better with the loudness, melodies, solos, guitar-ripping, and subject matter of the songs. That aside, Facelift delivers where you want Alice in Chains to deliver. It has long songs, furious and unleashed singing, and decent Cantrell solos. <BR>Drawbacks I find here are that most songs almost kind of repeat their predecessors, like they're abusing the same kind of song structure or melodies, which could get boring. But that doesn't mean it sucks. Since AIC are superiorly established for harmonies and somehow just knowing what kind of sound sounds good, the melodic diversity prevails in hooking the listener to their 1st cd's material. As well, since AIC are perhaps already born with the talent for song-and-melody writing, that repetition doesn't hold it back; rather gives more of what is wanted. <BR>The 3 singles are well-chosen except for We Die Young. Not that it's a bad song, but other, neglected songs on the album, could have made better videos/singles and caught more people to surrender to Alice in Chains. Songs like Sunshine, Confusion, Sea of Sorrow, I Can't Remember and It Ain't Like That and Love Hate Love far surpass it and are purely energetic, thrashing songs. Two songs on Facelift made me regret because they sounded frighteningly like they were made in the 1980s. Two being, I Know Somethin Bout You and Real Thing. They assault me to be reminded of those effeminate, soft, dancing and prancing 80s hair bands, with their melodramatic, flirty theatrics in those songs.<BR>Other than that, I award this cd a clean bill of health.  I actually didn't give this cd a chance until of late; you see Istarted liking AIC because of Dirt songs and not much later, because of Tripod songs. I was so amazed at the platinum quality of their songs on those cds that I was so grateful that there was a band who could touch that musical peak that I didn't want to give their earliest cd a listening opportunity, partially out of a bias that in 1990 grunge hadn't broken yet, but mainly out of a satisfaction with the stalwart that were the songs from Dirt and Tripod. But then Staley killed himself (died????) and with that problem, a doom for no more new AIC releases which pressured me to dig into just about every music they put out - before OR after. To clarify, that's why I award this 5 stars because I fanatically favor AIC, even with those flaws in this cd because they rose higher with Dirt and Tripod.
B000002J0B|5.0|This album is amazing, but after listening to 1 through 4, a bit shocking.  Some of the songs just don't sound like Zeppelin, and then you listen to the song closely and like a smack in the face, it hits you...these guys could just play any style they wanted and they'd own it.  The Crunge, sounds goofy as hell at first, but check out the timing!  Dancing Days puts a nice Rollerskate Arena filter on Robert and the results are just awesome, sounds so good.  And if anybody slanders the Ocean after you here it nice and loud, make sure to give them a piece of your mind, that song just rocks, it's just so good.  The Zeppelin was coasting after their huge previous release so they decided to have some unconventional fun and translated it perfectly into this LP.  You can almost see the Brown Bombers laughing and smiling, just enjoying what they can do.  I love it, you will too if you like great Rock and Roll with a bit of experimentation.

B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay is back indeed, and with a hell of an album, no less. Yeah, it's different from Parachutes, but it's a welcome change. That's right, they've changed for the best. There's still plenty of melancholy in The Scientist and Green Eyes and The warning sign, as well as more rockier Politik and Daylight. Overall this is one heck of an album and if you're a fan, you'll like it. For those of you who are afraid that old coldplay is gone, don't worry, it's still there, still sensitive and sad, just a bit more evolved. And, people from US, make sure you buy the right version of the album, e.g the one that has Amsterdam on it. Some US released albums only have 10 tracks. Pretty stupid.<br />Enjoy :)
B00006GA4C|5.0|It's great to finally see Grand Funk's best album back in print. The tracks are arranged perfectly. Opening quickly with &quot;Got This Thing On The Move&quot;,&quot;Please Don't Worry&quot;,&quot;High Falootin' Woman&quot;, and &quot;Mr. Limousine Driver&quot;, things then get very serious. The quartet of &quot;In Need&quot;,&quot;Winter And My Soul&quot;,&quot;Paranoid&quot;, and the cover of The Animals &quot;Inside Looking Out&quot; show what made Grand Funk special. Eerie sirens and radio noises mixed with fuzz bass, distorted wah-wah guitar, driving drumbeat, and screaming vocals make this a must have CD to complete your 60's collection. Haven't heard the added tracks, yet.
B000069AUI|5.0|I just picked up this album and I have to say that I am quite excited with what Coldplay has just produced.  Parachutes was an excellent album and A Rush of Blood to the Head is just another stepping stone for Coldplay.  Favorite tracks so far are daylight, warning sign, god put a smile on my face, the scientist, clocks, and amsterdam.....more than half the album which in my book is considered a \\"desert island\\" CD.  \\"in my place\\" still is in my head despite the heavy rotation on radio.<br />I would be shocked and disappointed to see any Coldplay fan rate this less than a 4 star album.  It's that catchy and good.  Only one downer:  I'm just sorry that Coldplay won't be coming to shreveport.  Anyone care to buy me a plane ticket to the Greek in LA??? lol
B000002LRX|5.0|Faith No More hit their peak here creatively in masterful style, despite theor previous effort 'The Real Thing' garnering far more commercial success.<br />Always a fresh sounding and entertaining band, here they produced a genre straddling masterwork that took the funk-metal blueprint which they were so instrumental in creating and grafted it to myriad other styles, most notably Heavy Metal, to create a supremely eclectic and bizzare, yet utterly compelling album.<br />Mike Patton's vocals really shine on this album, and he had always enjoyed a huge range before, Yet the mans influence is far more clear here: many of the songs deal with the most warped of themes, while Patton's twisted anecdotal lyrics add an enjoyably humorous and darkly disturbing quality to the record, often enticing us to follow him into the dark recesses of the human psyche which he gleefully inhabits.<br />Opener 'Land Of Sunshine', for instance, is in part comprised of lyrics gleaned from fortune cookies, against a backdrop of Patton's manic laughter and a quirky, descending keyboard riff. 'Caffeine' was allegedly dreamed up during a sleep deprivation experiment, and it shows: here we witness a more menacing, dense and claustrophobia inducing sound from FNM.<br />Elsewhere, 'Midlife Crisis' and 'Everythings Ruined' take a more straighforward funky approach and have more mainstream appeal: slap bass underpins Pattons unique rapping style and huge hooks draw us in willingly.<br />'Malpractice' and 'Jizzlobber', in contrast, are more dark and progressive, with numerous tempo changes, harsh guitars, bizzare samples and screeching vocals.<br />Essentially, this is a masterpiece, and no written words can fully do it justice. Any alternative or heavy metal fan should not hesitate to pick this up: it is a landmark recording and hugely influential, as well as being an immensely enjoyable hour with a talented band. There is something here for everyone though, so any music fan should consider it well worth the money.ey.
0446677450|1.0|This book could be retitled &quot;Buy this Book, Make Kiyosaki Rich&quot;.  This book is extremely short on details and designed to get you buy more of his products.  Also it's full of catchphrases so you think you are actually learning something worthwhile.  It's also interesting to me that no one has been able to find kiyosaki's &quot;rich dad&quot; anywhere.  Does this guy even exist?  Also what business did he sell to retire at age 47?  The fact that he doesn't give any details on this makes everything he says pure anecdotal nonsense.  <BR>If you buy illogical and poorly researched nutritional information books then this might be up your ally on personal finance.
B00003CXA6|4.0|A &quot;must have&quot; for any military or war movie collection. The script is based on Shara's &quot;Killer Angels&quot; and one should read that book as well as see this movie. The plot focuses on the battle, with no gratuitous romance or other extraneous scenes.<br />The cast is great. At times found it hard to accept Berrenger as Longstreet (I keep seeing him as the psychotic sergeant from Platoon) and as Jeff &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot; Chamberlain.  However, both actors do a great job in the film. I enjoyed Sheen's protrayal as a serene Lee. Shara's book paints a much less positive image of Lee focusing on his ill health. Sam Elliot is the one character I felt was misplaced. Although a natural on a horse, he severely overacted. Also I felt he was too &quot;Hollywood&quot; handsome to fit my vision of Buford, a general that died from disease not long after the battle.<br />The scenes relating to the defense of Little Round Top rank at the top of any war movie footage. The historical accuracy is first rate. The camera angles and editing are perfect. Except for the blood and smell of fear, you are there.<br />Not just civil war grognards can enjoy this film. I recently rewatched this with my wife, who is not overly interested in the war. She enjoyed the film and was inspired to take a tour of the battlefield.
0316666343|4.0|This book is a gem. Though I devoured each word as if it would somehow explain loss, death, the power of the mind and the connection between people, ultimately no higher meaning was given. The truth is discovered within the characters and whatever the reader comes away with is personal and precious. The writer expects, demands rather, that the reader work and come to conclusions on her own. I was disappointed and felt unfulfilled at the end, that all the ties were not tied neater, until I understood that that was the point. The writer provides the reader with the characters and the story so similar to life: nothing is easily explained, there are no pretty satin bows with which to tie things up. This tragic story finds a way to transcend it's horror by telling simple truths about life and relationships; a child's murder is juxtaposed with the telling of her first awkward kiss. Ultimately, the characters are real and unforgetable and that, to me, is the mark of a great book.
B00006FXB6|5.0|This is a great rock album.  For the Queens fan, I think this album is more of a combination of the sound of the first album with the quirkiness of the second album.  Dave Grohl's drumming is quite evident throughout this album and the music is quite varied with sometimes metal, sometimes rock, sometimes new wave...you get the idea.  I don't know if this album is better than &quot;R&quot;, but the difference is not that big as this album is a lot more meatier.  The DVD version is also fun to view; it has a few live performances as well as a behind the scenes.  Can't wait to see them in concert.
B000002UR7|5.0|I can't believe some of the reviews on here. People are comparing this to radioheads later work? Others are forgetting that this was recorded in 1992. This entire album rocks. Every song is good. The melodies are intricate and beautiful, the guitars create a beautiful wall of sound that just rips you in two, the vocals are poetic and take many listens to understand. I don't understand how someone can not love this album. I listen to it all the time, along with all of radiohead's other albums. I don't try to compare them, I enjoy them for what they are. Even today this album is stellar and is one of the greatest rock albums of all time. Nothing sounds quite like it. If you don't own it, buy it, and don't try to compare it to their other works, just relax and enjoy it.
0071373586|5.0|I didn't want this book to end, because the authors have managed to combine humor, with an \\"in-your-face\\" reality about getting into the prospect's mind.<br />They suggest we set both the \\"four P's\\" (product, price, place, and promotion) paradigm and the idea of being creative aside, until we have researched and know what segment we can serve on a superior level - the we must know where the competition is, and where the hole is in their attributes.<br />This truly had me thinking about many things.  Being a fairly new business, I had to overcome the idea that my business name really does not say what prospects will recognize as what I'm doing --- it was hard to see that the name, which I had chosen represented more about where I have evolved, and less about what I was in business to serve.<br />And once I accepted this, I was free to start asking people what they think of the new name that I have come up with.  I also objectively listened, while I allowed myself time to come up with what really is 5 syllables or less; something that communicates to my prospects the benefits that I provide.<br />I kept asking myself what is in the minds of my prospects.  And I saw more than I saw before.  Which has netted me, a profit in my business bottom line, today.<br />Another point that surprised me was that Ford is not doing as well as I assumed it is doing.  And my assumption was based upon the fact that of all automotive makers that exist, I have only read about the history of Ford.  I haven't read about General Motors.  Which I am sure that once I do read about GM, I will say, \\"Wow!\\"<br />A downside that this book has, as in many that I have read is that when it speaks of service, it's not talking about selling writing, speeches or consulting.  So the reader must ask herself how the wonderful lessons could apply.<br />Yet, I truly recommend that everyone, 18 and over buy this book, because this book provides tools in convincing the right people to choose what you are offering, on terms that are mutually beneficial.ng, on terms that are mutually beneficial.
B00004XQP4|4.0|Green Day is showing it's staying power as the best punk band of all time. A good mixture of switching tempos and messages, Green Day has come a long way. Minority, Warning, and Waiting are the best songs and shows what punk is all about
B00000IPAX|4.0|This album was great! Every song catches your attention. From humor (Party song, Anthem) to serious (Wendy Clear, Adam's Song) I will never get tired of it. Blink also mae the smart move to get Travis Barker to play drums. One of the best drummers out now. The only downside is that it was too short.

B00000427L|5.0|The true joy of this package comes in the way that Ashkenazy's beautiful and steady playing combines seamlessly with Previn's inspired conducting. It is almost as if the piano and the orchestra are playing as one instrument. Of course in a set of Rachmaninoff concertos, the most important are the 2nd and 3rd, and so I shall concentrate my remarks on these. Quite simple Ashkenazy's second is the finest I (or gramophone magazine) have ever heard. The tempos are perfect, the sound rich and the playing luxurious. Ashkenazy plays without a sense of his virtuosity which greatly adds to the artistic integrity of the performance. Indeed it is this which raises the level of the performance above that of flashier versions by Van Cliburn and Sviatoslav Richter. It is, however, the recording of the third that is most intriguing. I am used to pyrotechnical performances of this concerto (I have two by Horowitz and one by Argerich - the Horowtiz/Reiner is unquestionably the greatest recording of all), however, this reading of the work is notable for its lack of showmanship. Ashkenazy takes the work slowly, playing the long chordal cadenza, but he plays it so darkly, so powerfully. The work appears very different to the more &quot;virtuosic&quot; recordings, and is simply fascinating. The conducting of Previn is simply breath-taking as well. Never has the orchestral part had so much power. I have seen this work live twice, but somehow this recording manages to supercede the orchestral excitement of seeing a live performance. The crescendos at the end of the two final movements are stunning, and one simply has to take one's hat off to Andre Previn. In general, therefore, this collection would be very difficult to beat, as is well worth the asking price.
6305907145|5.0|This is, by far, my favorite Jane Austen movie of recent years - and I've seen them all. I loved the way it was filmed - with very witty and romantic effects: having the protaganist address the audience, slowing down the frames to build romantic suspense. I thought it was masterful. Also loved Frances O'Conner's performance. When I saw this movie for the first time I swooned! I have watched it many times since. It did not get as much press or exposure as \\"Emma\\" starring the well known Gwyneth Paltrow and I think somehow this affects people's opinions - many more seem to rave about \\"Emma\\" - but I found Mansfield Park superior. Perhaps it's because of the unconventional views of the film, choosing to include a view of the less priveleged. For me it was a combination of all these things - editing & film techniques, approach to the story, a well chosen cast - that brought this together so effectively. I just love it!!!
0385503954|5.0|McEwan's best book since \\"Black Dogs\\", \\"Atonement\\" is in one way quite similar: this, too, is the story of how another 'story' was written and why.  But \\"Atonement\\" is more ambitious than its predecessor and ultimately more successful.  There is just so much to enjoy here: the social comedy and undercurrent of burgeoning sexuality in a country house in the summer of '34; a rigorously researched and immensely moving account of war told from the twin perspectives of soldiers and nurses; and, of course, a plot full of the terrible menace for which McEwan is deservedly renowned.  Writers will adore this novel, too, for it is ultimately about writing - its limits and its power - in various forms: letters, fiction, testimony.  McEwan explores how what is said (and what is not said) has real influence on human lives.  His characters are brilliantly realised - the developing perspective of Briony from age 13 to 77 is magnificently done - and his prose has never been more beautiful.  \\"Atonement\\" is perfectly timed and structured, too.  When the final section delivers up its heartbreaking conclusion, you'll know it could never have ended any other way.  McEwan has had you in his thrall from the outset, and that's a wonderful place to be.
B000066F6H|3.0|If you like GARAGE ROCK for God's sakes PLEASE check out the Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965-1968 [BOX SET] & Nuggets II: Original Artyfacts from the British Empire and Beyond [BOX SET]!! These are the roots of all you hear on The Hives, The Strokes, Etc.... Nuggets is where all the original blazing fury and raw sound came from. GIVE IT A LISTEN you might be surprised to hear that all this was done even better over 30 years ago!!! Not to see that this is a bad CD in fact it's pretty damn good but go to the source for the best!
B000069AUI|5.0|Being a huge fan of their album Parachutes and thinking it one of the best albums' of 2001, I find it hard to believe that I find this album even better than Parachutes. Although this album may not have a single that will become an extreme hit such as \\"Yellow\\", I find the songs in it to be far more mature in emotion, unlike Parachutes which very much felt like the yearning of first love and loss (which isn't bad, but to hear it the second time would just seem as though the band wasn't creatively maturing and evolving.). Best songs: In My Place, The Scientist, Clocks(Beautiful piano work.), Daylight(this one just might be my favorite. Very cool sound to it!), Green Eyes (starting almost has a Mazzy Star quality to it.), and Warning Sign. And once again Chris Martin's voice puts the listener in awe.
B000069HJM|1.0|I purchased this album when it first came out, listened to it once, and put it away for a year or so.<br />Since I absolutely loved all of the band's other albums, up to and including &quot;Brother Where You Bound&quot;, I decided to give &quot;Free As A Bird&quot; a second chance. P.U. I couldn't even get through the album a second time. I have an almost pristine vinyl copy sitting in my attic somewhere that will probably never see the light of day again.<br />I was not surprised that it never showed up in a CD version for all these years. Bottom line: buy the rest, leave this one alone!
B0000019PA|5.0|So you gave up on acoustic rock after hearing all that teen-angst bullcrud that Staind and Dashboard Confessional put out? Think again! Jeff Magnum and the gang have put out their ultimate masterpiece here, one that indie rock geeks across the country can nod their heads to and say, \\"Yup, this is it!\\" The horns are great, the songs are great, and the cover is great. If this album was any  greater, it would have to be done by Radiohead. Yeah, you heard me. Radiohead. That's how good this is.<br />For those of you who don't know what exactly this mysterious \\"Neutral Milk Hotel\\" represents, I will tell you right now. Neutral Milk Hotel is a guy with a really messed-up voice who writes psychotic lyrics (e.g. \\"In the dark we will take off our clothes and they'll be placing fingers through the notches in your spine,\\" \\"Sweet communist floating on the steamy water, semen stains the moutaintop\\") accomponied by an excellent brass orchestra. While this might sound rather scary, it's actually really, really good. Before you dismiss this CD as garbage, actually LISTEN to one of the songs like the title track or \\"Holland, 1945.\\" You might (and probably will) love that song and want to buy this CD as soon as possible. Or you might hate that song and want to assassinate Jeff Magnum for writing such an aweful tune. Whatever the case, this is something that needs to be listened to ahead of time. <br />If you like unique music that is very original and gives you really (messed)-up dreams if you listen to it before going to sleep, you will love this CD. If not, you can go listen to Chris Carabba whine about how that girl he loved with all his heart stole his inflatable sofa and how much that depresses him.
B000060P79|5.0|its just a really good album i found that i could relate to it a lot
0553260111|5.0|I picked up this dandy after seeing the excellent Matt Damon movie.  As many have said, the book is a totally different story, but both are very good in their own ways.  The premise is the same.  Man loses memory and finds he has some disturbing gifts as he tries to regain said memory.<br />Ludlum's novel is chock full of suspense, thrills and kills.  The action seems almost non stop, but remarkably, there seems to be room enough for a well executed plot.<br />The story moves along with the action and Ludlum only lets the reader know enough to be only a couple of steps ahead of Bourne.  We find out pretty much as he finds out.  Another thing the author does well is put our hero (or is he an anti-hero?  You'll find out soon enough) into situations that the reader has no idea what he can do to get out of it.  And the really cool thing is that sometimes, even Bourne doesn't realize he's in these situations.<br />The pace flies and Ludlum ties the complicated plot together satisfyingly enough at the end that the reader is left happy, yet hungering for more &quot;Bounre&quot;.
B00003CXTG|5.0|this film, with its spectacular battle sequence, is not just a story about war, but about hope, fear, love, and above all friendship.  Nomatter how many times I watch this movie, it still moves me.  It made me feel the depth of this tragic event in a way I didn't think possible.  Undoubtedly, one of my favorite films.
0898159156|5.0|I wish every how-to book was this readable and informative. I'd tried growing carnivorous plants before, without much luck. Now I have seven that are thriving. I've even started some from seed, which is an accomplishment for me because I can't even start vegetables from seed. Thank you Peter D'Amato.
0812550757|5.0|Card Knocks another one out of the park!!
B0000584V3|5.0|I've owned this album for well over 2 months. I'm a relatively new fan of Opeth, and this is my first and only CD by them, and I assure you it is not my last. It's taken me these two months to simply organize my thoughts and find something to say. I think that it would be best if I just agreed with another reviewer on the site. If you read the review by Lord Chimp, you'll pretty much get a good idea of my reaction to Blackwater Park. In fact, it seems as though several people have undergone the same feeling of astonishment, wonder, and pride while experiencing the power of this release...<br />I dislike the majority of death and black metal bands. I find their rambling on about Satan and the reusage of medieval themes tiresome and even silly at times. The bands that use anti-religious or violent, sick, lyrics ala Cannibal Corpse/Gorgasm/Deicide have decreased the genre's credibilty in my mind. Taking into account the 'music' to go along with it: Overusage of the double bass pedal and blastbeats, grinding, tuneless guitar noise, and 'growled' vocals; I stuck to thrash, industrial, and \\"nu\\" metal as my preference. Well, I must say that one cannot remain close-minded forever. This melodic death metal movement is a promising one, it seems. Bands like In Flames, Hypocrisy, and Opeth, are something to behold... <br />I'm straying off topic, but Opeth toss every cliche of their genre in the gutter by rising above it altogether. Their usage of folk and acoustic guitars, melodic guitar lines, clean vocals, piano, and whatever else they can to add beauty to death metal, awes me. I doubt that the moniker of 'death metal' is even appropriate now. Their songs create a haunting, almost ethereal mood, so when you listen to them it transports you elsewhere. Perhaps a murky bog in the moonlight, an orchard in the spring, or a forest in Europe after a light rain. The lyrics are beautifully written, almost like poetry. They tell a story of love, but I haven't quite figured it all outyet...<br />\\"The Leper Affinity\\" starts off the album with a loud chime, and builds into an intense melo-death guitarfest, with Mikael Akerfeldt's growls augmenting the music perfectly. This guy has one set of lungs on him! Incredibly guttural, yet understandable. He puts Chris Barnes to shame. Then, in the song's middle, an abrupt, almost arbitrary segue into acoustic dreamland occurs. This pattern continues, until Mikael shows off his clean vocals. Amazing! This dude can sing, too! Few singers that I know of can make such a change. The only others are Kud from Mudvayne, Burton C. Bell from Fear Factory(Deman.), and the guy from Soilwork. The song ends with classical piano, and clocks at around 10 minutes...<br />The remaining tracks follow suit. \\"Bleak\\" has excellent melodic guitar lines, guest vocals, and an awesome Arabian melody. \\"Harvest\\" is an acoustic metal number, all clean vocals and a jazzy feel. \\"The Drapery Falls\\" is another 10-minute behemoth, with a tuneful first half, and some shredding vocals in the middle. \\"Dirge For November\\" has a melodic intro and a wonderful acoustic ending. \\"Funeral Portrait\\" has an almost sinister intro, a catchy guitar melody, and revisits the Arabian melodies. \\"Patterns In The Ivy\\" is a short acoustic guitar/piano duet that serves as a beautiful lead-in to the 12-minute title track--all death vocals, with many changes in melody and segues into acoustics very often. All concluded in a massive finish...<br />Opeth's Blackwater Park is an amazing 67 minutes of wonderous musical adventure, sprawled across eight amazing tracks. The singer has an amazing range, and the guitarists are constantly displaying their range without overplaying. The bass lines are throbbing and very audible(unlike most death metal), and the drummer is very talented. I look forward to purchasing Still Life, Morningrise, MAYH, and Orchid in the future. Opeth has made me rethink my opinion on death/black metal, and I now understand the talent required. Support this band and all others like it...<br />\\"Sick liaisons raised this monumental mark/The sun sets forever over Blackwater Park.\\" -Opeth
B0000640VN|5.0|Ah! The casting is the thing that makes this delightful romantic comedy work so well! Meg Ryan is at the top of her comedic form as is relative newcomer Hugh Jackman in this tale of star-crossed lovers from different epochs falling deliciously head over heels for each other despite all the differences supposedly separating them. For anyone waxing nostalgic about the lost values and manners from the past, the series of situations and gags involving exactly those characteristics in a wistful recollection of how charming and wonderful such luxuries as manners can be.<br />Alas, fellow travelers of the time continuum; we happen to live in a time almost totally bereft of any personal knowledge of the human comfort and shelter such social practices can bring to both ourselves and to others, of the ways in which a disciplined code of consideration of others and a corollary code of conduct act to smooth the social waters we must trudge through in our daily quest to make our livings, meaningfully interact with others, and find some semblance of meaning and purpose in so doing. Thus, Jackman's character acts to reaquaint Ryan's with the delicious luxury of time-honored cultural practices and dutiful manners, and she falls as much for the lost treasures of being treated with courtesy and consideration as for the man treating her with such unusual (for our time) deference.<br />The script is lively and entertaining, and the building of the romance quite believable and engaging, as well. The use of the difference in expectations and the differences in each of the principal's world view for comedic effect is also a lot of fun, and the intelligence and wittiness of the dialogue is unusual, to say the least. This is a well acted and well-thought-out thought piece disguised as a romantic comedy, and it works very well indeed. Two thumbs way up for this one! Enjoy!
0441009425|3.0|If this was Reynold's third or fourth novel, I would have been dissapointed. However, for a debut, this was decent.<BR>I don't know why people are calling this &quot;amazing&quot;, because it certainly was not.  Given how little the plot actually moved along, this book could have been 100 pages shorter.  I will give Reynolds credit though, for a first book, he had some interesting concepts and kept the reader intrigued enough (just enough) to keep reading.<BR>Not bad. I'm interested to see if there is an improvement in Chasm City.
1558216847|5.0|The other reviews cover the details of this amazing tale, and give speculation about its veracity.  I found it extremely hard to believe that, once they had passed out of Siberia and well into Mongolia, and had encountered friendly natives, they would still have the mentality of needing to escape at any cost.  It is hard to believe that even a desperate person, with impaired judgement, would set out on a journey through the Gobi desert with no water containers, and inadequate food.  Why wouldn't they have at least obtained some sort of vessel before embarking on that journey?  This problem continued to confound me, until the end of the book when we learn that the travellers went into an extended delirium upon their rescue.  Indeed, they were far from being in their right minds.  As retold years later, it would be hard for us to crawl inside their heads while on the journey, and the author conveys the information in too logical a format.  In fact, these guys were half-crazed on this journey, and bad judgement was probably more common than not.
B00006AW2F|3.0|Only a Stones fanatic needs this CD, but if that's you, this is an interesting odds and sods collection of outtakes, demos, and alternate recordings of 1960s material. \\"Out of Time\\" is a more \\"pop\\" version of the venerable Stones classic, that employs the backing track of Chris Farlowe's UK hit version. \\"Jivin' Sister Fanny\\" is a chugging rocker that starts out hot but goes nowhere in particular. \\"I'd Much Rather Be with the Boys\\" is the 1965-era  Stones trying to sound macho but coming across kind of, er, goofy. The rest ranges from good to execrable. The sound is, like the others in this reissue series, fantastic. Not high on anyone's list of Stones classics, but an interesting sidebar to their history.
B000021Y77|5.0|A great, fast-paced movie with intelligent social commentary. Not only is this movie an adrenaline rush, but it's also a visual delight. There are little visual cues to pick up here and there, for example the roadway that forms infin -- the Greek symbol for infinity -- in the opening sequence.<br />The actors are clearly talented, particularly the two leads. Even though Manni and Lola have very litte screen time together, their chemistry is evident throughout. Somehow, Potente and Bleibtreu make is incredibly easy to see why Lola would risk so much for her boyfriend.<br />But, having watched the movie I was left thinking: Wait a minute...if the homeless man used 700 marks to buy the bicycle --> then there is money missing from the bag Manni delivered to his mob boss --> who will surely kill him for this discrepancy. Is this supposed to be noticed, or am I obscenely obsessive and over analytical? Hmmmm
B00006AW2J|5.0|The remastered Banquet is a revelation. The auditory quality is absolutely beautiful, especially in SACD. While lacking the Surround Sound mix of many SACDs, the two channel stereo here is breathtaking. Listening to this album took me back to high school and college days, when vinyl ruled and albums had the ability to make magic in your head. I'm ready to invest in the whole remastered catelog - and I'm not even a big Stones fan. I hope Paul and Ringo pay attention to what's possible with SACD. The new version of Let it Be would be a great place to start.
0446677450|5.0|I don't understand why some people gave 1-star reviews to this book. I bought the book back in Feb/March 2000, and I gave it a 5-star review on April 26, 2000. It deserves as many stars today as it was two years ago when I first read it. <br /> If I had not read Robert's work back then, our 401k retirement account would have suffered huge losses in 2001 and well into July 2002. Thanks to Robert's inspiration, we have acquired so much financial literacy since then. We have learnt so much about the financial markets on our own to be able to make independent decisions--without depending on advisors or brokers. For example, we shifted our portfolio to money market and bond funds since last year. Unlike many of our friends whose 401ks are deeply in the red, we were UP last year. (But we have scaled back bond funds recently though.) <br /> Robert's books aren't perfect. He repeats himself frequently, and I doubt whether all he says about his rich dad or poor dad is necessarily factual. Nevertheless, you need to look beyond all that. What he says in his tapes and books has changed my life and financial outlook completely. Although we will not be rich anytime soon, we now have greater confidence and knowledge in attaining our financial goals. In other words, instead of blaming others, we've found the locus of control within ourselves. And that's what his books are all about. <br /> If you still haven't read any of Robert's works, don't put it off any longer. Keep an open mind and read them. Above all, don't be too picky with Robert's writing style. The bottom line is to get the message.
0060930349|4.0|I spend my summer reading the book, and Paul's unrelenting effords to uncover the mystic journey of the Republic were fascinating and satisifying. Organized loosely into five chapters, the book flows smoothly with intertwining themes. It's not a \\"balanced\\" and rigid text book, but a fairytale full of fahterly advice about morality and justice. And Stories about artists, architecture, writers, businessmen, politicians, scientists weave together a most colorful and fun-to-look-at USA hall-of-fame. BUT: Criticisms for FDR and fondness towards Reagen, though entertaining, seemed like sections from British tabloids.
020530902X|4.0|This book is a must have. Easy to read and full of simple but important advices. It works within days! With little effort, I already simplified and improved my English writing. It has gained in readability and efficiency. It's a good book to begin with, even - or particularly - for non native speakers.<br />4 out 5 because perfection is for gods! (:-)
B00005JKDR|5.0|Every so often, a film comes along that is simply too cute for its own good.  Such is the case of MONSTERS, INC.  The dramatic premise of the movie centers around the following dilemma:  what to do when your ace scary monster finds a kid too adorable to play Mr. bad guy?  Oh, my, Nietzsche would have been thrilled with this one...<br />The animation in this flick is spectacular.  Some of the sequences are sort of a cross between THE GRINCH WHO STOLE CHRISTMAS and DR. WHO.  Featuring the vocal talents of John Goodman, Billy Crystal and Steve Buscemi, this is a rip-roaring hilarious good time for the whole family.  Kids will love it.  Adults are sure to love it more!
0446678430|2.0|This was my first foray into the &quot;Rich Dad&quot; series. I decided to pick this up to see what all the hoopla was about. This book is long on concepts and improving your mindset and short on telling you HOW to accomplish the goal.<br />Kiyosaki drones on, frequently referring to his other books. After the first few chapters, I gathered that his plan is to invest in real estate and start your own businesses, but there is no substance to tell you where to start DOING any of these things. I guess that I was expecting more of a &quot;how to&quot; guide to achieve the end result.<br />Now that you know what you SHOULD do, skip this one and go find a nuts and bolts guide to real estate investing or starting your own business.
B00006AW2E|3.0|A major remastering project of this scope for a group as big as the &quot;Stones&quot;, should be done properly. Unfortunately, it was not. This is a great album, and I was going to give it 4 stars on that alone, this review will focus on the new remastering.  <BR>The disc is all in MONO.  That would be OK, if at least they told us. The quality of the record varies a little from track to track, probably due to various sources.  &quot;Heart of Stone&quot; is available in STEREO on Hot Rocks 1. &quot;I'm Free&quot; is on Hot Rocks 2, but still in MONO.  This info should be noted somewhere, anywhere on the discs, but is not.  There is no way for the serious collector  to know what version it is, until you listen.  This is inexcusable, as it will require buying extra cds with alot of overlapping of songs to get the whole collection.<BR>I am told there is misleading info on ABCKO's website that with a Super Audio player, you can hear this in 5.1.  None of the discs are in 5.1 format. This SACD sounds very good in MONO on a regular player, but is noticeably better on a Super Audio player.(Also in MONO)<BR>They could have included release and recording dates and the times of the songs as well.<BR>Its a good thing this is a great album with improved sound and  nice digipak, because the info is conspicuous in its absence.
0767817486|4.0|The only word I can think of to accurately describe this film. Midnight Express at its' core is an expose not of the Turkish prison system but of the brutality that man is capable of. Based on true events, Midnight Express follows the life of American Billy Hayes, who is caught trying to smuggle a small amount of hashish on to his plane. Needless to say he is caught and sentenced to serve time in a Turkish prison. Billy endures endless torture both physical and mental during his tenure in the prison. There is one particularly beastly guard who looks like James Gandolfini from the Sopranos; anyway this guard loves to whoop up on the prisoners, especially the Americans. The film takes you on a roller coaster ride of emotions with plenty of twists and turns. The film score is nothing short of haunting. The use of sound and music in this film add a whole other level of horror to an already hellish situation. Some film buffs might also notice Randy Quaid in one of his earliest film roles as another American imprisoned with Billy. Overall, Midnight Express left me with a sick feeling. It challenges the viewer to endure countless acts of violence and brutality and yet still believe in the strength of the human spirit. A must own for any serious DVD collector. Highly Recommended.

B000005JYE|5.0|Ok, since I started liking ABBA in the early 1990s, I had great hopes that the huge revival would convince the group to do some kind of new project together. But since ABBA won't do a tour for a billion dollars, I don't have hope anymore. I take all I can, I buy the old albums, the cover bands' albums, go see Mamma Mia!, get videos and the new DVD Collection to console myself. The light has not completely gone out, though because Agnetha Faltskog is working on a new solo album, I can't wait till she records it this fall. In the mean-time, I'll just cling on to the past of ABBA like listening to my favorite album : The Visitors. Although it doesn't have my favorite song (Summer Night City) on it, it goes into uncharted Abba territory with such dark gems as The Visitors, I Let The Music Speak and Like An Angel Passing Through My Room. The edition I'm reviewing is the one I bought in Canada a few years ago and includes the original Visitors LP plus 4 bonus tracks : Should I Laugh Or Cry (B-side of the One Of Us single), The Day Before You Came and Under Attack (Which were singles from the compilation The Singles--The First Ten Years) and finally You Owe Me One (B-side to the Under Attack single).  <br />I just want everyone who says that Abba is a glitzy 70s disco act to listen to this masterpiece which is probably the finest CD in my 300 or so collection. The songs intertwine perfectly and it marks the end of a group, of an era. I always feel melancholy when listening to it. ABBA is the greatest pop band that ever was and they have my infinite admiration.
B00005JKMQ|3.0|This is a tough movie to not be very enthusastic about.  It is the story of an American icon, his flaws and heroics on display for all to see.  It has a terrific cast, including Will Smith as Ali, Jon Voight as Howard Cosell, and Ron Silver and Jamie Foxx as the two men supporting the great champ in his corner.  So I want to really love this movie, but I can't.  The acting is terrific, but the movie does not move as well as it should.  The Director, Michael Mann gives us some interesting style moves, but I think fails to get us inside Ali. I guess if you liked his film Heat, you will like this one as well, because it is the same style of filmmaking.  I still think The Insider and Last of the Mohicans are his best work.  Smith deserved the Oscar nomination for his performance here and he continues to expand the expectations we have for him.<br />The disc itself is also not what it should be. A poor selection of extras is included with the movie.  It continues to amaze me that they release these discs without the extras that the public would enjoy.  There is an amazing amount of terrific items that could have been included about Ali, boxing, even the role of TV in sports.  My advice is, if you love the movie, wait for the special edition, if there is one, before you buy this.
0380789035|5.0|After discovering and embracing the Sandman books, I'm glad to see that Neil Gaiman is making it in the novel industry.<br />Cleverly written, original, obviously imaginative, this book is great, feels very strong and real.
B000069AUI|4.0|If anyone out there, like I was, expecting another albulm like their first and is going to be deeply disappointed, then again you may love it.  This made it hard for me to review. I Loved to chill out to Yellow, Parachutes,Shiver Sparks etc etc. I am listening to it again as I type the review.So there are no songs like Yellow. No real deep chilout songs with killer melodies and that fantastic voice. This is Coldplay doing Radiohead, or dare I saw REM.  It is good. But not as good as Parachutes.
B000069AUI|5.0|With their second album Coldplay has proved to us that Parachutes was not a fluke - they are capable of recording an even more amazing compilation with A Rush of Blood to the Head.  A Rush is an phenomenal recording rating up there with Radiohead's masterpiece OK Computer.
B000069AUI|5.0|So happy I was not disappointed by their new CD.  This is not a one hit wonder! Nicely recorded and lots of catchy songs with a message.

B000056HRZ|1.0|I received a blank tape of Casa Blanca from Amazon.com.  I did not try to view it until after the one month time limit, having no reason to suspect it would be blank.  Also, I would not have known the video was blank unless I removed the cover.  The system will not allow me to discuss this problem with a human being.  Therefore I am very unhappy with the service from Amazon.com.  Valerie Whelan
B00005M91K|2.0|As a great fan of that poem of pure cinematography Koyaanisqatsi, I bought and viewed Baraka because it had been recommended as being along the same lines.  Well, yes, some of the scenes (and the general concept) seem to be practically copied from Koyaanisqatsi, but in general, my reaction is that while Koyaanisqatsi is one of those rare works of pure inspiration, Baraka is simply a work of pretention.  It could be an emblem for the New Age generation, in its skin-deep grasp of spiritual traditions, juxtaposed on the screen simply because some visual aspect of the previous scene resembles a visual aspect of the current scene, but with no appreciation of the underlying meaning of what is depicted within the cultural context.  Even the sound track almost completely ignores any authentic musical heritage associated with the images shown.  Where the cinematographer of Baraka seems to have been attempting to portray continuity or perhaps universality of the spiritual life and its artifacts and rites, in fact the result is little more than visual punning.  It takes great commitment and devotion of years of study and practice to plumb the depths of any spiritual path, and no facile movie presentation of a string of pretty images like a smorgasbord of plastic hors d'oeuvres is going to reveal any important spiritual messages.<BR>However, like New Age &quot;fast food spirituality&quot; fare, while there is nothing there to be taken very seriously, hopefully some pretty and stimulating images (extraordinarily beautiful photography!) may inspire curiousity in some viewers to look into the briefly presented phenomena in more depth.  In this way, the movie may end up making a cultural contribution after all.<BR>The 2 stars are for the gorgeous photography, and the missing 3 stars are for lack of interesting (or any) content.
0767849493|3.0|As the opening to the movie suggests, \\"Dogma\\" is not expressly intended to offend but to look at things open-mindedly.  No one can disagree with the idea that it explores religion from a nontraditional perspective.  Two angels (Ben Affleck and Matt Damon) have fallen and have been banished to a place \\"worse\\" than hell...Wisconsin.  They discover a loophole which could get them into heaven, but this would ultimately make God falliable and destroy the universe.<br />The band of characters that seek to stop them include: the \\"13th disciple\\" who was omitted from the Bible because he was black; an angel who's working as a stripper; a pro-abortion lapsed Catholic who turns out to be in the lineage of Jesus; and last and definitely least, Jay and Silent Bob.<br />Many of the characters and ideas effectively make us step back and realize that \\"traditional\\" beliefs are full of assumptions and prejudices about how things are supposed to be.  However, I don't know if Kevin Smith was trying too hard to challenge EVERY possible belief or if he starting having a little too much fun at the expense of ultra-conservatives, but the theme suffers at the expense of excess.  There are simply too many new \\"revelations\\" thrown out; as the movie progresses, Smith seems to use the story less to question whether traditional ideas are correct and more to boldly proclaim that they aren't.  While I'm willing to admit some \\"traditional\\" ideas might be erroneous, I can hardly believe that Smith's concocted mess of explanations is more worthwhile.<br />The most overused characters of all are Jay and Silent Bob.  In this film, they are strictly one-trick ponies.  Silent Bob is...silent.  Anyone who remembers the show \\"Newhart\\" realizes that a silent character is hardly original.  Jay says nothing profound or even amusing; apparently, the fact that every sentence is chock-full of expletives is supposed to be side-splitting.  Okay, Jay's vulgar and Bob's silent; we get it.  We got it the first 20 times the gag was stuffed down our throat.<br />The idea wasn't a bad one, but it just wasn't developed as completely as it could have been.  At the end, I spent less time thinking about my faith and more time thinking about what was wrong with the movie.
B000067CPX|5.0|yes the chili peppers have toned down a bit, but that doesn't mean they sold out or went pop, no, they extended in to a more scar tissue sound and pulled it off quite well. this album lacks songs like By The Way, but that song is already so played out, so I'm glad. try it out, it's catchy and slower than past rhcp efforts, but that doesn't mean it should be skipped over!
B0000084J7|5.0|Everything that one may have read or heard about this album is true. Simply divine. I enjoyed and was challenged by \\"Talk Talk\\" but this is beyond that, another world. The only other album that would challenge, or should I say compare, no---share the same space, would be Scott Walkers \\"Tilt\\" Both are complete. Removed from classification.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Let me start off by saying that OK Computer is a major album, perhaps the best release of the 90's, and certainly one of rock's all-time best.  That said, this is not a CD that you will put on and fall in love with on first listen.  I remember it taking several listens before it really exploded in my mind that this was a superior offering of concept, lyrics and musical innovation.  It really kicked in when listening with headphones and the lyric sheet in hand. Many reviews here compare OK Computer with Dark Side of the Moon by Pink Floyd. Lyrically they share the same sceptical view of mankind, but musically they are quite different.  While the Pink Floyd epic was expansive musically, Radiohead here create a clausterphobic atmosphere.  Several of the tracks are catchy on their own such as the Paranoid Android, No Suprises and Karma Police, however this is best enjoyed as a whole album.  All of this is not to say that OK Computer is a difficult album, but that it takes time and effort to appreciate it on several levels.
0783225903|5.0|The title of the review makes this film seem like paradise, but as soon as watch it you will find that it's not.  It's basically a darkly humorous and daydream filled movie about government becoming too controlling by using fear and paperwork (lots of paperwork).  It is inspired by '1984', but it doesn't plagiarize because there are significant differences between the two and the most important one being that 'Brazil' isn't humorless like '1984.' Although the director is American he used to be in a Brittish comedy group called Monty Python, you may have heard of them. I say this because the film has very Brittish feel to it because many of the actors are Brittish (Michael Palin was even in Monty Python).  The production design also has the outlandish feeling of animation because the director mostly did the humorous animation bits for the movies and series for Monty Python. This shows up in many models that were built for this movie.  Most people can't get past this, but if that weren't enough the screenplay was co-written by Tom Stoppard who loves to do dialogue that includes language jokes that I think many Americans won't find funny.  Add to that the fact that it's 2 hours and 22 mins long.  Most won't be able to make it past all of that.  A friend of mine said that the film bored him even though he thought it was visually brilliant.  In my opinion the film needs that amount of time in order introduce you not only to this wacky and dangerous world, but to the dreamworld of the main character and how they become increasingly difficult to differentiate.  Despite all of these 'setbacks' it isn't a smart film and it doesn't take multiple viewings to understand the film, people just enjoy it and were willing to go through the 'setbacks' that other people can't get past. I personally don't even find it difficult to watch at all and enjoy revisiting the world that 'Brazil' offers, or least the one that Sam, the main character dreams up.<BR>    Also, I must note that theDVD features have just as many 'setbacks' as the film because they are very comprehensive. There are the usual things such as the trailer and the promo documentary, but there are other longer features as well.  A long documentary about the trouble the director had with getting Universal to distribute his film is included as well as long text explanations of the development for the script. Storyboards and many others are more than most can take, but if you're a student of film and find this one fascinating, then this is the best place to look.
B000002INJ|5.0|Modesty has never been a trait you connected with Manowar, and they are no doubt reffering to themself with the title of their 1988 album. <BR>The album is a definitive improvement over Fighting the World, and includes some of Manowars classics. Starting out fast and furious with Wheels of Fire, the album covers the whole spectrum. Over the slow hymns, like the crown and the ring and to storytelling, in The Warriors Prayer. We also see yet another bass solo by DeMaio, Sting of the Bumblebee, which reminds of Williams Tale from Battle Hymns.<BR>When released I was convinced this was Manowar at their best, that this, they could not beat. I was right at the time, only to be proven wrong when they released The Triumph of Steel.<BR>Some cd's contain a bonus track called Pleasure Slave. I don't really consider it a bonus though. I think the cd was just fine in its orginal version, and Pleasure Slave should have been left out in my opinion. <BR>But it is still a good album, one of the best powermetal albums released in the 80's, maybe one of the best ever.
0380977788|5.0|This story would be in the same genre as Alice in Wonderland.  It is a strange, dark novel that appeals to both the young and young at heart.  It is the story of a heroine who must go to another world to save her family and other children trapped there.  She is momentarily sidetracked by the appeal of this world where she can do anything she likes, and everything from the living toys to the plays of Miss Spink and Miss Forcible's (her neighbors) counterparts seems tailored to her entertainment.  The plot thickens when the door back to her reality is locked and the stakes for her soul and those of her parents are threatened to be trapped forever.  This is definitely an interesting story for all ages, another of Neil Gaiman's great achievements.
B000062YB1|5.0|This is in my opinion one of Slayers best albums. The music is a mix between the speed of Reign in Blood and the heavy sound of South of Heaven. The themes are more mixed now, Slayer not only concentrate on demonic possesion and demons. Now they also find their inspiration in real life horror like on War Ensemble. Slayer always had a bad reputation, and I have encountered being asked if I was a satanist for listening to Slayer(the answer is no).<BR>I think that alot of people put too much into Slayers lyrics. Yes they are shocking and provoking, but so are many movies. I have never seen anyone accuse Steven Spielberg of being a satanist after making The Exorcist. I don't think that Slayer themself take the lyrics as is. <BR>Basicaly I think that in most cases they are boys having a good time, playing evil. But they do it with conviction. Sometimes too much for some people. That said, Slayer are incredibly gifted musicians, with some of the best guitarwork in the business. Don't cheat yourself out of listening to Seasons in the Abyss, because it is a rare pearl in the metal collection

You won't regret adding this one to your collection, believe me!
B000002IU9|5.0|This is Manowars ultimate feat. Their most harmonic and most powerful album to date. Starting out with the Wagnerish, Achilles Agony and Ecstasy in 8 Parts, which is basicaly an opera, with everything that belongs in one. It is grand. It is loud, it is Manowar. <BR>The album is basicaly a lineup of great songs, it could have been a best of album, for all I know. Spirit Horse of the Cherokee, a hymn to the native american braves, a very catchy tune, that gets the blood pumping. Among other favourites are, The Power of Thy Sword, a traditional Manowar battle hymn, but so well done that it ranks among their best ever. The Demons Whip, a song that starts out slow, but picks up untill it reaches an insane pace. The last track Master of the Wind is propably Manowars ultimate power-balad, powerful, emotional, grand.<BR>The album is one long line of pearls, all you have to do is choose the one you prefer, because there are no flawed ones. This is indeed Manowars finest hour.
B000021Y74|4.0|Loud enough to shatter glass.<br />There are three keys to the success of this remarkable German language film (with English subtitles): originality of conception, crisp direction and editing, and two attractive stars to play the leads.<br />The stars are Franka Potente, who plays ruby red-haired Lola, daughter of a banker.  She is smitten with Manni, handsome young man played by Moritz Bleibtreu, who forgot to keep his grip on a bag containing 100,000 Deutsche marks belonging to his mobster boss.  He is to hand over the money in twenty minutes, but he lost it on the train. (It was picked up by a homeless man.)  Manni calls Franka and tells her the desperate straits he is in.  He says his only out is to rob a store.  She says no wait, she can come up with something.  What that something is is dear old dad.  She looks at the clock.  It's twenty minutes until twelve.  So Lola starts running to get to the bank and then to Manni before the stroke of noon.<br />If you've seen Truffaut's Les Quatre cents coup (1959) then you know where director Tom Tykwer may have gotten the idea of showing us a Lola who runs like the wind.  Truffaut used a sustained shot of his young hero running to convey an uplifting sense of freedom amid action.  It worked for Truffaut and it works for Tykwer.  Franka, running in nicely fitted pants and tank top (with her white lace bra strap discretely showing) really is a delight to watch.  And like Truffaut, Tykwer does not let us see the runner sweat.  There is a kind of effortless release, without any straining of our lungs.  It is like running in our dreams.<br />What Tykwer does with time is even more interesting.  He has Lola run from her home to the bank to Manni three times, each time with a slight difference in the early events, leading to differences in the events to come.  In the British movie Sliding Doors (1998) starring Gwyneth Paltrow, something of the same sort was tried with Gwyneth playing out two different permutations of her life based on decisions leading to differing scenarios.  I'm also reminded of the brilliant American film, Memento (2000) directed by Christopher Nolan in the way some of the events are played over again.  Here the scene as Lola runs by her mother on the telephone is the same three times, but then the differences begin.  It might also be said that this movie is the \\"many worlds\\" interpretation of quantum mechanics brought to cinema.  Or perhaps Tykwer was influenced by complexity theory in which a slight change in initial conditions can lead to large changes later on.<br />The story (or rather stories: there are three of them) strain credulity at times.  The awful things her \\"father\\" says to her in the first accounting seems too harsh and stupid to be real.  The co-incidence of Manni's spotting the bum on the bicycle in the third tale seems a bit too lucky to be believed.  And the allotment of twenty minutes of time in the three sequences was a bit off.  However some of the other events seemed to me to be plausible or at least very clever and therefore allowable in an artistic sense.  That the man in the ambulance regains a steady heart beat because she holds his hand is something this old guy can believe.  And the cops mistaking her for a bystander in the bank robbery seems like credible cop behavior to me.  And for those who think that the casino event was too much to believe, consider this:  Assuming that the roulette wheels in Germany have both a zero and a double zero, the odds against betting on the number twenty and hitting it on consecutive spins of the wheel are 1/36 times 1/36 which equals about 77/100,000 or about 1300 to 1.  It's a long shot, but nothing like winning the lottery.  Incidentally she had in the bag 115,600 Deutsche marks (her initial 100 marks x 34 x 34).<br />For those of you who haven't seen this remarkable film, consider this: it lasts 80 minutes, but it will seem like fifteen.  The \\"throbbing techno score\\" is haunting and there are some nice action sequences.  This is the kind of (R-rated, however) movie you can see with your teenaged son, although he would probably prefer to see it with his buds.e action sequences.

B000005RSW|4.0|Yes, Manowar pounds onward. I will propably catch alot of heat for uttering this, but I think that Sign of the Hammer is a great improvement over Hail to England, which I felt lacked some of the power you expect from Manowar.<BR>This time Manowar follow their old reciept, fast and furious metal, mixed with awe-inspiring hymns and exelent musicianship.<BR>Even for non-fans there can be no doubt of the technical exelence of the members of the band.<BR>The album starts out with All Men Play on 10, a good traditional Manowar tune. After that follows Animals, which I consider the albums weakest track. Thor(The Powerhead) is Manowar as we know them, fast, agressive, in-your-face metal. Mountains a Vietnam-hymn, and a traditional Manowar power-balad, is just as awe-inspiring as one would expect. The Oath and Thunderpick are good tunes too, although I feel that the title track and Guyana(Cult of the Damned) stand out here. Both I feel are Manowar classics.<BR>I doubt any Manowar fan would be disapointed in this album. It contains all the qualities that you would expect from the Kings of Metal

B00000DG1R|4.0|I bought the cassette version.  One thing that bugs me is that the songs are not in chronological order (other record companies are guilty of this too, not just Capitol).  Also, some songs such as &quot;Rio&quot; are the chopped-up single versions, not the cool full-length ones.  If not for these two faults, the album would  rate 5 stars.  Nevertheless, if you want the best of Duran Duran's stuff and don't want to shell out the buck$ for all their regular- issue albums, &quot;Greatest&quot; is the one to get.  Lots of good stuff here.  === Paul H! in AtasCal
B000002KMV|4.0|On the title track of his fourth album, Prince sings, \\"Am I Black or white/am I straight or gay?\\"  He's clearly mocking the intrusive nature of journalists, but even more than that, he's addressing our nation's preoccupation with race and sexual orientation.  It's a message that has relevance even more so in today's culture, and it's also proof that, in some respects, \\"Controversy\\" is ahead of its time.  But that's not to imply that this is strictly a message album.  It delivers his usual blend of rock and funk, which he would later master to perfection on \\"1999\\" and \\"Purple Rain.\\"  \\"Controversy's\\" other track of note is the sensual ballad \\"Do Me, Baby,\\" which r&b singer Melisa Morgan would later cover.  A slow jam that has Prince ooing and aahing throughout, it still holds up as one of his best songs.  Only on \\"Ronnie Talk To Russia,\\" a goofy stab at political commentary, does he stumble.  \\"Controversy\\" may not be among his classic albums, but it was an important step forward for this incredibly talented singer.
B00006FXB6|5.0|Queens of the Stone Age were already, without question, one of the best rock bands in years when their last album, &quot;Rated R,&quot; came out.  Now, with the addition of two great refugees of the Seattle music scene, they are approaching perfection.  Mark Lanegan, former lead singer of the dearly departed Screaming Trees, and Dave Grohl from the Foo Fighters and Nirvana are both on board this time,along with original bassist/singer Nick Oliveri and guitarist/singer Josh Homme, for &quot;Songs For The Deaf.&quot;  The album opens with the Oliveri-led &quot;Millionaire,&quot; a high octane screamer reminiscent of his songs from the previous album.  After that, the band's pop sensibilities shine.  &quot;No One Knows,&quot; the first single, has a beat that you cannot get out of your head, and Josh's vocals are almost beautiful on &quot;First It Giveth&quot; and &quot;The Sky Is Fallin',&quot; which sounds like the Beatles meet Black Sabbath.  After the ridiculously rude and heavy &quot;Six Shooter&quot; the catchiness comes back with &quot;Go With The Flow,&quot; &quot;Gonna Leave You&quot; and &quot;Do It Again,&quot; each a possible second single.  Grohl's distinctly heavy style of drumming is a great advantage, adding a dimension to the songs that was slightly lacking before.  Lanegan lends his wonderfully deep and raspy voice to &quot;Hanging Tree&quot; and the best track on the album, &quot;God Is In The Radio.&quot;  He also co-writes three songs, including the final track, &quot;Song For The Deaf,&quot; which harkens back to their self-titled debut album.  And let's hear it for a &quot;hidden track&quot; that is listed on the back cover of the CD.  Here's hoping that Queens will get the recognition that far less interesting and talented bands such as Limp Bizkit, Korn, The Hives and The Vines are getting.  Even if they don't, however, they will continue to put out fantastic albums that those of us lucky enough to like them will cherish forever.  (A quick notein reference to the DVD that comes with the album: Kudos to these guys for putting it out at no extra charge, and offering some insight into the songwriting and recording process.  I loved watching the part where they recorded &quot;Song for the Dead&quot; and when Dave Grohl sang background vocals into some sort of vase.)

B000069AUI|5.0|In what is perhaps alternative rock's darkest hour, it is refreshing to see a band return, and do things right (once again). Based on such songs as 2000's \\"Yellow\\" and this year's \\"In My Place\\" the public views Coldplay as just some sappy Brits, wailing out on an acoustic guitar. Parachutes was just that, a collection of thoughtful/powerfully-moving/beautiful songs. I love that cd; perfect for listening on a rainy night, but it just lacked the edge to blow you away. <br />Coldplay's achieves that with \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head.\\"  The things that made Parachutes such a success is here--brilliant, deep, lyrics and (lead singer) Chris Martin's incredible voice, but now instead of donning acoustics guitars and taking a backseat, the rest of the band, led by guitarist Jonny Buckland, rocks out. The finished product is simply amazing, producing songs that sing on so many different levels. <br />Although I imagine they hate being compared to them, I can say whole-heartedly that with this cd Coldplay has attained the level of Radiohead. <br />(Read: Radiohead as in an excellent band that mixes superb guitar work, with an incredible voice, and meaningful lyrics.) <br />Some tracks that stand out at the moment-<BR>\\"God Put A Smile Upon Your Face\\" (ignore the title)<BR>\\"A Rush of Blood To The Head\\"<BR>\\"Amsterdam\\"<BR>\\"Daylight\\"<br />Bottom line-this is the Coldplay album you can blast in your car.

B00005OAIE|5.0|One day I was listening to the radio and on came the song \\"No Such Thing,\\" by John Mayer.  I thought the song was brilliant.  So I looked him up.  And found more of John Mayer's songs.  Usually I don't buy CD's, since I can burn CD's for free.  But this CD is definitely worth the purchase.  Because I like all the songs on this CD.  All of his songs have a special meaning.  Their not just lyrics he throws together.  Usually the average person goes through at least one of his songs (which has a meaning).  I'll just give a few examples....  \\"No Such Thing\\" is about trying to figure out what you want to do with your life.  And it's hard to decide what you want to do when you grow-up, even through all the education.  \\"Why Georgia\\" is about in life you wonder if you're making the right decisions.  \\"My Stupid Mouth\\" is where you sometimes wish you could watch what you said, instead of making \\"stupid\\" comments.  \\"3x5\\" where you wish you could be with that special person instead of sending them pictures (3x5's).  \\"Not Myself\\" is a song where you want to show your real self to a person.  But you hide behind a fake persona, and you're afraid that the person will see the real you and leave you.  Those were just some summaries of some of the songs he sings.  I like the jazz/rock music style that he sings.  It's music you can listen to anytime.  And he is really talented.
B000068TP0|5.0|I became a Shakira fan after hearing Whenever, Wherever on the radio. I eventually bought Donde Estan Los Ladrones even though I didn't understand a word of Spanish...at the time. I still couldn't get enough, so I bought her MTV Unplugged DVD. The whole performance was fantastic. Shakira's English songs are good, but her Spanish songs are... on another level. The show opens with Octavo Dia, which is one of my favorites from DELL. It has great lyrics and a catchy melody. Si Te Vas and Donde Estan Los Ladrones are high-energy songs with rock flavour. The next song is the popular version of Ciega, Sordomuda, and it's awesome. Inevitable is a beautiful song and features Shakira displaying her guitar skills. Moscas en la Casa has a nice feel to it and is very well done, while Estoy Aqui is updated, sounding funky. Tu is my personal favorite of all the Unplugged songs. It's accompanied by piano and violin and she sings it with so much passion and emotion making it a very beautiful song. Sombra de Ti is another slow song that has a lot of meaning to Shakira. For the last two songs Shakira turns up the energy once more with a spunky version of No Creo and an extended Ojos Asi to finish things off with a bang.
B00000K501|5.0|I really enjoyed watching band as it is my all time fav. The pyrotechs are swee' and the sexual taunts are funny, to an extent =p. I would recommend buying it, even if you don't understand German.
B00005RFVL|4.0|As a self-aware &quot;snobby jazz type&quot;, I'm very ashamed to enjoy this album so much.  With that said, it's a wonderful, catchy, and surprisingly genuine album.<br />I was hesitant to enjoy anything by the rather reprehensible Robbie Williams, but he's simply too talented of a singer to ignore.  More important than his talent, of course, is how he swings--and while he doesn't have it _quite_ down, his voice is perfectly suited for jazz.  Every song is very catchy, with a wonderful big band backing him up.  With the exception of the Sinatra cover &quot;Somethin' Stupid&quot; (featuring a decent Nicole Kidman) and the opening track, the album is a lot of fun to listen to.<br />&quot;Ain't That a Kick in the Head&quot; is my favorite track, by a mile.  That and the Hart/Rodgers standard &quot;Have You Met Miss Jones&quot; are the great, swingin' big band tracks.<br />At the end of the day, this is a quality album with some good jazz.  Williams manages by vocally mimicking Sinatra, Bobby Darin, and others--but he does it so well that he deserves some credit.  4 stars worth.
B000069CWE|5.0|Right at the 'Opening', where you here this warm, thoughtful piece that features Phoenix (LP's bassist) on violin and cello with some piano at the end you know that this will be a unique experience. Heres a rundown of the other songs:<br />Pts of Athrty - A fresh new sound that is more aggressive and is much improved from the original!<br />Enth E End - Very cool beat taken from the piano at the start of the original In The End! M. Shinoda provided cool new lyrics and Motion Man also had a verse of his own....<br />Frgt/10 - At the start there is a beat then a violin with the chorus but then drives into a rap with heavy bass accompanied by Shinoda's cutting lyrics. Chali 2na also has a very affective verse. The one part that comes after the chorus in Forgotten is warped with terrible voice that is one of the few flaws on the album.<br />P5hing Me A*way - Starts out very powerful, then slows down until it starts rising to the climax of the song with a very emotional and terrific chorus! Well Done!<br />Plce 4 Mie Haed - Kind of a techno beat at the start but then gets into focus with a good rap and its basically the same lyrics after that except for the verse with Zion.<br />X-ecutioners Style - Starts with scratches and bits from Forgotten and One Step Closer, and Black Thought provides the lyrics.<br />H! Vltg3 - Very cool beat and great lyrics from Shinoda! Also Pharoah Monch was great and his rhymes were excellent! One of the better tracks!<br />WITH>YOU - Starts out with a fresh riff and Bennington screaming (really cool start)then goes into the verses and choruses which are about the same. Then you get a rap thats very reflecting and finishes with a piano tune...<br />PPR:KUT - Pretty cool beat, but kind of wierd. Good lyrics from Shinoda and the rappers and a good bridge modified from Papercut't original one.<br />Runaw@y- Not bad, and the first verse is lame, but finishes quite well. Harder than the original.<br />MY>DCMBR - Cool start with the piano but itsquite different from any other song and its more R&B but Bennington has a great voice...Remixed badly though...<br />By_Myslf - Really cool and original song. The guitars where excellent and the song overall was great!<br />KYUR4 Th Ich - Starts out with a warped but familiar beat with extra sounds added in... Near the end it sounds like the scratches from the Pop Tarts commercial! Listen to it, its very close! It ends with a accented voice saying 'Mr. Hahn' (you no Mr. Bond?)<br />1Stp Klosr - It takes 2 minutes to really start the song but it was great! Korn's Jonathan Davis provided a verse and backing vocals at the end! Great!<br />Krwling- The last (and its fitting) and the end to the CD. It starts with the strings from the Opening and it carries that throughout the song. There are clips from Crawling, then a warped xylophone tune from Crawling then goes to Aaron Lewis who was fantastic. He did the chorus and backed up Bennington on the other Choruses! They screwed up his voice in the verses with effects that is the other flaw in the CD...<br />Just AMAZING, you HAVE to get it! They are true music geniuses!
B00005JKNF|5.0|For my money, no director working today knows better what to do with a huge ensemble than Robert Altman. Regrettably, he didn't win the Oscar this year for Best Director which remains a bit of a mystery (pun intended) to me. \\"Gosford Park\\" is arguably his most ambitious work to date. To some viewers, the film meanders quite a bit for more than an hour, flittering back and forth between the frantic work pace and never-ending preparations of the downstairs household staff and their employers lush, opulent living and activities upstairs, all during the course of a shooting weekend in the English Countryside. The standout performances include a devilishly spoiled Maggie Smith (whose character as she puts it 'hasn't a snobbish bone in her body') and Kristin Scott Thomas as the lady of the manor whose icy demeanor is off-putting to most but quite attractive to young fellow posing as a servant (a sly and witty Ryan Phillipe). The murder mystery, it has been reported in the entertainment press, wasn't actually added to the film until about 6 weeks into the shoot but you would hardly know since the gradual buildup to that crescendo is so brilliant and almost off-handed! After watching this terrific cast of A-list actors scurry about thier daily activities and then settle into a game of bridge, Brandy, conversation and music (provided by the dashing and alternately grating Jeremy Northam at the piano) a blood-curdling scream from the study snaps everyone from their selfish state and thrusts the film forward to a surprising and satisfying finish. I won't give away more than that (in case you haven't seen it yet) but I will say that there is another tasty little subplot involving two downstairs service people (a magnificent Helen Mirren and Clive Owen). Special kudos to the set designers and costume department for a job well done and for some of the most lush cinematography in recent film history!<br />Brilliant.
0316666343|5.0|I read this book over a month ago and simply can't get it out of my mind.  This book crosses genres and my 21-year-old daughter loved it as much as as I did.  It takes something really special to make a book about the rape and murder of a teenage girl into an ultimately uplifting story. Highly recommended.
B000001EXR|5.0|Clearly a solid all around effort. I don't think that this album is an effort to copy any particular style, as some people would want you to think. Nor do I believe that this album was released in any effort to &quot;cash in&quot; on any style that may have been popular at the time, as some Kiss fans seem to think. Does it sound different? Yes. It's heavier, and darker than anything they've done before. Does that make it bad? No. It's not illegal for a bands' sound to evolve over the years. <br />Granted, this isn't &quot;Love Gun&quot; or &quot;Rock and Roll Over&quot;, or even &quot;Destroyer&quot;. But those albums came out in the 70's. Read that again. The 70's. So, yeah, forgive the guys for trying something new. As for the tunes...<br />&quot;Hate&quot;, &quot;Rain&quot;, and &quot;Master and Slave&quot; are clearly the hardest songs on here. Fast, hard, heavy, for three in a row, not a bad start.<br />Things slow down a bit for &quot;Childhoods End&quot; and &quot;I Will Be There&quot;, the latter being included in the box set. Not bad tunes, just slower than Kiss is used to. <br />&quot;Jungle&quot; was the single, but the radio version is radio length, this one broods for 7 minutes. I think they had a hit with this one, why it didn't take off, I don't know.<br />Tracks 7 through 11 are ok, solid tunes, but no standouts.<br />&quot;I Walk Alone&quot; is the final track, and guess who is singing? None other than Bruce Kulick, and doing a fine job of it. It makes me wonder why he hasn't sung lead on any other songs. A bit sad considering that this is the last studio album from this lineup.<br />Anyway you slice it, this is a solid effort, both for old time Kiss fans, and newcomers alike. I would reccomend it more for those that have never heard Kiss, or just know them after the make-up came off, this is clearly their best work of that era. If  you're an old timer, and feel that Kiss should have stayed the way they were, you might change your mind after a few listens of this.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Bottom Line - The Strokes are the future of rock music as we know it. More specifically glam rock.<br />The comparisons to Pearl Jam are fair; although they don't sound like Pearl Jam, they have the potential to go down in rock history.<br />The Strokes' sound is very unique. Catchy basslines are mixed with rather simple drumbeats and some nifty guitar playing. And then, there's Julian Casablacas' vocals. They sound as if they are being filtered through a cell phone or a crackling intercom.<br />This sort of innovation gives The Strokes a truely unique sound. The first track, 'Is This It' is rather sleepy and seems to set a tone for the whole album. It seems as each song progresses, The Strokes become livelier. Casablancas is practically screaming (in that muffled, static sort of way) by the time you reach the final track, 'Take it or Leave it'. What I'm trying to emphasize here is The Strokes' ability to create very different sounding songs with the same basic formula. <br />This is an album that should be in everyone's collection. Watch out for this New York quintet - The comparisons are true.
B00006GFAB|4.0|The aptly titled \\"Very Best of Kiss\\" is just that. The best. As a huge Kiss fan, I am tempted to buy this. The only problem being, I already own all of the original CD's that these hits came from. There's nothing new here, just the old favorites, plus a few post make up tunes. <br />Maybe it's just me, but it seems a little odd to release a \\"greatest hits\\" hot on the heels of a box set. An expensive box set at that.<br />I could rail against Kiss for putting out inferior product based on song selection, but why bother. Some of my favorites are missing (\\"Shock Me\\", \\"Black Diamond\\" for starters), but shame on Kiss for not putting \\"Domino\\" on here. I think that a 2 CD set covering more of their later stuff (Anything off of \\"Carnival of Souls\\" would have been a nice addition) would be a more fitting retrospective for a band that has been around for nearly 30 years.<br />Don't let that stop any newcomers, this is the best of, no if's, and's, or but's about it. These are the songs that made Kiss famous, served up all at the same time. You could spend a small fortune buying all the CD's that have these songs, but if you're new to Kiss, this is an excellent introduction.
0930289455|5.0|The Killing Joke is, without a doubt, the finest work that involves Batman. <br />The story goes like this - The Joker, in a desperate attempt to get someone to see things from his point of view, shoots Barbara Gordon (daughter of police Commissioner Gordon), paralyzing her. Then, he takes the Commisstioner and tries to turn him insane. And, as usual, it's up to the Batman to stop him.<br />Maybe the most entertaining aspect of the book is the backstory it weaves. It shows the Joker, pre-accident, as a stuggling comedian unwittingly brought into a robbery. Using elements from the famous 1950's Joker origin story, 'The Man behind the Red Hood', Moore and Bolland make the Joker seem tragic, in a maniacal sort of way.<br />The dark story Moore writes meshes well with Brian Bolland's detailed, linear artwork. Bolland makes every character look remarkable, and his rendition of the Joker on the cover has become one of the most famous Joker images in history. <br />You can't call yourself a Batman fan if you don't own this. Heck, you aren't much of a comics fan at all if you haven't at least read the story. This is ESSENTIAL for EVERYONE'S collection.
B00005JKNF|5.0|A wonderful, complex, charming film. I've seen it a dozen times and still catch snippets of conversation that i'd not heard before. <br />Anyone who loves a good murder mystery, a good british film or a just having a good time should see Gosford Park!
0789723107|5.0|We've all see examples of good web design and of bad design. For a while it was everyone with a computer had a web site, so we were sick of the flashing doodads and the moving pictures. Now it's time to settle down to serious business.<br />Krug takes us through basic lessons on web design for usability in easy to digest and follow examples. Short chapters and extensive graphics of examples drive his point home in plain language. The book is not about the code - it's about what the user sees and how he or she navigates and operates. His lessons are no-nonsense and should be shouted from the highest mountain. Quick load, thought out arrangement of items, don't make the user think. His \\"secrets\\" are so obvious, they just get lost sometimes in the flash (and the Macromedia Flash).<br />Reading this book is an investment of a couple of hours that will help you look at web sites in a new light. If you have a web site you can't help but think about how your site stacks up to examples.  It doesn't hurt either that he so extensively uses Amazon as an example.
B000031WD9|1.0|Dirty teenagers. They should just give up. That one nerd ruined a perfectly good apple pie. I was disappointed. Don't touch a flute again. This movie is so raunchy that even a monkey covered its eyes. I was happy with Shannon Elizabeth's Oscar-worthy performance, but the rest of the cast, c'mon! Eugene Levy is hip homey. Guys don't play lacrosse or sing in choir. The Kama Sutra was meant for foreigners. Being a perfect 'A' student, I was upset by watching this distasteful display of today's youth. Insanity!
B00005JKQZ|4.0|This is an excellent movie, however, it is not truthful.  For example, the loving, caring, supportive wife depicted in this movie actually, in real life, left her husband only two years after he had schizophrenia.  They only recently reunited.  I was extremely disappointed to discover this.  Also, in real life, he did not see visual hallucinations--he only heard voices.  I guess this is typical of Hollywood to take a true story and twist the truth to make it sell.  Excellent movie, but certainly disappointing in the above mentioned areas.
B00005JKDR|4.0|Kids have always loved monsters, and both kids and grown ups will likely love MONSTERS, INC., a surprisingly witty fantasy that finds the citizens of Monster World popping through closet doors to collect screams--screams that are converted into the power that makes everything from cars to televisions sets run in Monster World.  And Sully (voiced by John Goodman) is the top scream-gatherer at the factory... until he accidentally allows a human child to wander into Monster World and runs afoul of a jealous co-worker's plot to unseat him from the top spot.  The humor is surprisingly sly, and there's plenty for all generations to enjoy.<br />Although TOY STORY was impressive, Pixar's computer animations have come a long way since then, and MONSTERS, INC. is memorable for both design and visual depth.  And the Special Collector's DVD has a large package of bonus material that will appeal to any one interested in how the film was created.  But there's also plenty on the \\"pure entertainment\\" side.  The bonus material DVD includes the extremely memorable and hilariously funny animated short \\"For the Birds,\\" a very enjoyable animated short \\"Mike's New Car\\" (featuring characters from MONSTERS, INC.), and a tour of the scream factory from a new employee's point of view.  There are also some games that will appeal to the youngest viewers as well--in fact, the bonus material has so much to explore that it will keep both youngsters and young at heart busy for quite a long time.<br />But the actual movie is the important thing--and it looks and sounds absolutely great on this DVD, which gives you the option of seeing it widescreen or full screen and hearing it in surround sound.  It's all beautifully done, and fans of animated film--and especially of computer animated films--will find this well worth the bucks.  Recommended.
B000002LTV|4.0|That is a good album to listen when you are doing some tedious jobs. However when you are free and boring, if you listen to this CD, you will be even bored. There are not much 'content' in the songs. They just 'play' the notes instead of playing music.
B000065V1V|4.0|Soy un seguidor acrrimo de Bowie desde que conoc &quot;Let's dance&quot;, y le permanec fiel durante todos los ochenta (su dcada ms floja) mientras escuchaba sus viejos discos y miraba sus pelculas. Luego vino la reconciliacin, con el afortunado experimento con Tin Machine, y tres obras contundentes: &quot;Black tie, white noise&quot;, &quot;Outside&quot; y &quot;Earthling&quot;... una triloga de cinco estrellas y media: tres clsicos de los aos noventas.<BR>Pero, por desgracia, Bowie afloj el paso con &quot;Hours&quot;: una coleccin de canciones correctas pero demasiado eclcticas, interpretadas con ganas pero sin carcter. Luego, cuando vi el especial de A&amp;E (donde present &quot;Heathen&quot;), mis esperanzas se renovaron. Al escuchar &quot;The angels have gone&quot; y &quot;Slowburn&quot; cre que el nuevo Bowie haba vampirizado la sustancia correcta para renovarse.

Lo malo de Bowie es que, desde muy temprano, nos volvi muy exigentes con su msica.<BR>Me di cuenta, para empezar, que &quot;Heathen&quot; contiene dos categoras de canciones: las maravillosas y las de relleno.

Entre las segundas, la peor es, sin duda, &quot;I would be your slave&quot; (con su ritmo bobalicn y repetitivo).<BR>En conjunto y en resumen, &quot;Heathen&quot; es un disco hermoso, con algunos momentos de verdad memorables. Para ser justos, debera calificarlo con slo tres y media estrellas, pero Bowie es Bowie y, de puro cario, le regalamos la otra mitad...

B000002A3T|5.0|This is a reluctantly resonant pink floyd crawling out of the woodwork after a much berated \\"momentary lapse of reason\\". and after one hearing of this album, the listener is relieved that they are back.not because they have managed to stir up all the trademark trappings of delusion and pain that typified their earlier works but because there is a curiously new and glowing pulse to the division bell right from the surreal earth sounds that start the album rolling,all the way to the ineffable pull of the guitar passage at the end of the last track, \\"high hopes\\". water's absence from this cut is obvious as the songs and the lyrics do not spiral down stairways of cultivated depression. the band has positively aged,gilmours's voice is soothing and cuts through the complex,beautifully layered fabric of guitar work. the album chimes ambiently with thoughtful and precise musical arrangments and has a nice, dawn-like freshness to it.there are undertones of hope and light in the face of the <BR>inevitable but approachable crux of disillusionment that follows communication break downs which incidentally is the album's theme. \\" i took a heavenly ride through our silence..\\"..wonderful lines from one of the high points in the album,\\"coming back to life\\", a track that never fails to move me. \\"what do you want from me\\" grows on you with its bluesy,grinding sound and so does the very graceful,airy \\"cluster one\\" that precedes this track. \\"maroonned\\" echoes feelings of isolation and despair, classic floyd signature? the album's strengths come alive in side two with a rush of energy and a febrile calm to \\"take it back\\". <BR>note the classic instrumental opening on this song and the quiet elegance with which it seamlessly flows into \\"coming back to life\\" and of course the liberating drum and guitar interplay that takes the latter into orbit. \\"the only thing we need to do..is make sure we keep talking..\\" is the seemingly simplistic essence of \\"keep talking\\", once again falling back on the thematic peg on which the production's entire range of sound, sentiment and image hangs majestically. \\"hig hopes\\" puts a new spin on this undercurrent by eminently transforming the flashes of incident, human bafflement and subsequent reconciliation into a highy dramatic and almost operatic flow of feeling and musical intensity, the definitive post 80s floyd i would say. <BR>the whole album shines through with a tenacity that seeks to explore new ground, revisit some familiar territory, address a few bones of contention and ultimately get a grip on what it means to meet and fall apart with people. very listenable, friends, give the post-waters floyd a break and discover some really good pieces, alive with a clarity they have tapped after ages.<BR>listening tip: listen to this album while looking out at the changing colours of dawn.
0316666343|2.0|This book received a lot of pre-publication hype.  I was intrigued by the description of the plotline.  Upon reading the novel, I am still convinced that the underlying story was extremely creative, but Sebold's storytelling was lackluster and full of opportunities that she allowed to pass her by.<br />Susie (Salmon, like the fish) is brutally raped and murdered by her neighbor, Mr. Harvey in the first chapter.  Susie then narrates her tale from heaven, which is portrayed as a bleak, lonely place.  The heaven described by Sebold centers around material possessions, but Susie lacks the ability to interact for any extended period of time with her fellow deceased loved ones.<br />Nevertheless, Susie watches in isolation as her family, schoolmates, friends, and murderer react in the period following her murder.  Her parents' marriage falls apart, her sister becomes tough and prematurely mature, and a classmate she hardly knew becomes obsessed with her, having felt Susie leave Earth as she ascended to heaven.  Meanwhile, Mr. Harvey successfully hides her body and eludes suspicion by everyone except Susie's father.<br />Because Susie is separated from her family by Heaven, her description of events lacks an emotional quality and too often, her narration seems detached and heavy-handed.  For the most part, the characters are uncompelling, including Susie herself.  Perhaps the most compelling character is Mr. Harvey.  The author alludes to his violent, brief childhood but does not follow through.  The character of Susie's mother comes off as selfish, cold, and completely unsympathetic.  Her affair with a police officer investigating her case is also problematic.  The officer's loneliness following his wife's suicide is also referenced but again quickly dropped.<br />What creativity for Ms. Sebold to come up with the idea of the narrator following her family on Earth following her murder.  However, this book suffered from the author's self-indulgence and indecision.  Initially, the book seems to want to focus on the emotions of Susie's family.  Later, it seems to focus on the suspicion of and hunt for Susie's killer.  Either way, incredible loose ends are left hanging at the end of the book.  I felt unsatisfied with the resolution of Mr. Harvey and with the resolution of Susies' parents' relationship.  Like many much-hyped books, this was a disappointment.  It was especially disappointing because it could have been so good.
6300216543|4.0|I just have few comments about this movie... I really appreciated the excellent directing & the excellent performance by Al Pacino.  The turmoil Serpico felt as to wanting to be a good cop, but also knowing the shame of being assoc. w/the known to be corrupt police force was compelling to watch.  The pressure he was under was tremendous.  As some others have said, it WAS a real-life horror/suspense story.  When the other cops confronted him in the park I thought it was LIGHTS OUT for him!  I liked the part when he first met the bag-man, and he fooled him about the mouse who sniffed out heroin.  I knew right then there was serious trouble ahead for Serpico.  The understated, subtle, pressure-cooker acting from Pacino was the best!  <br />I just had a few problems-- the movie \\"did not age well\\" as someone else said--it had a tv movie feel.  But I still loved the time capsule effect of seeing NYC back then, and also the close-minded views of the cops vs. hippies & gays, and also how the free-spirit girlfriend ended up being \\"traditional\\" after all.  <br />It was also very confusing for me keeping track of all the cops & Serpico's allies.  But all in all I'm so glad I saw this movie!  Now on to Dog Day Afternoon!
B000068IEU|1.0|I just got through watching this movie five minutes ago. I didn't have high hopes for it, but I had no idea it would be quite as bad as this. Mostly I wanted to see Craven's first film because I thought his second one (\\"The Hills Have Eyes\\") was pretty good for a horror film (and for the low budget they obviously had).<br />I am sure the version of this movie I saw was censored (the MGM edition was all I could find), but more gore and violence couldn't ultimately make this movie more suspenseful or scary or BETTER as a horror movie in general. In other words, I cant say I have much desire to seek out the uncut version, much less pay for it or even waste another hour and a half of my time watching it. Hell, the only part of this movie I halfway enjoyed was the stupid cops which was totally out of place to begin with but was actually entertaining for one or two minutes. Also the music used in the movie did not make a lot of sense. You have two women being raped in the woods by escaped convicts and they're playing calm hippy music in the background. Im not against trying something new and experimenting, but this just ruined the effect I think Craven was trying to produce in these parts, namely shock and disgust. Instead the music was largely distracting and tampered down something you could make even more effective with the right music.<br />I want to say that this movie is *NOT* disturbing (at least to me) and if that is why you are curious about seeing it (as I was) don't waste your time, ... I see good reviews on here, Christ...did we see the same movie??? I saw the MGM version, that's what everyone else here is reviewing, unless they have seen some extremely uncut version where its almost a different movie I don't understand giving this film a second thought.
6304057709|5.0|A couple of weeks back, I saw the 1996 A&E production of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. Putting my \\"real man\\" self image at extreme risk, I admitted publicly that I enjoyed this most excellent film immensely. Pushing reputation even closer to the edge, I viewed the 1995 release of SENSE AND SENSIBILITY last weekend. (I need something to watch while doing the ironing.) The theme of both films seems to be \\"anxious females seek Princes Charming to rescue them from rural spinsterhood\\", which, on the knowledgeable authority of a good friend and Jane Austen obsessive, is common to all of the author's works. Feminists may cringe at that generalization, but there wasn't much in the way of bra-burning in the first decade of the 19th century when Austen was busy scribbling.<br />S&S opens at the side of Mr. Dashwood's deathbed, at which point he's leaving his entire estate to his son John (James Fleet) in conjunction with the latter's promise to financially provide for his half-sisters, Elinor (Emma Thompson), Marianne (Kate Winslet) and Margaret (Emilie Francois). Subsequently, though John gives lip service to generous support of his siblings, he's easily dissuaded by his selfish wife, Fanny (Harriet Walter). Soon, the three Dashwood sisters and their mother are tossed out of their Great House to live in a (rather large) cottage on a cousin's estate. With no dowries to back them up, the two eldest, Elinor and Marianne, are left to Fate and their own charms to attract men of means to wed. So, Elinor may or may not be favored by the younger of Fanny's brothers, Edward (Hugh Grant). And Marianne is adored by the socially awkward Colonel Brandon (Alan Rickman), but she only has doe eyes for the dashing Willoughby (Greg Wise). It's such a puzzle.<br />My opinion of S&S suffers from having previously seen P&P. It's difficult to be fair since the latter is by far and away the richer and more humorous presentation. Emma Thompson is, however, superb as the sensible sister who, while dealing with her own turmoil of the heart, must support the feelings-driven Marianne as the latter careens from one emotional extreme to the next. Alan Rickman is marvelous as the suitor tortured by the demons of unrequited love. On the other hand, I wasn't quite so impressed with Grant as Edward, who was painfully ill at ease in the presence of adult women. (A deer caught in the high beams comes to mind.) Normally, the unassuming shyness of Grant's roles is appealing, but this time it was a bit over the top. Either that or his Georgian-era shorts were bunched and his collar too tight. And because P&P is over twice as long as S&S, the script of the former could afford to include some minor personalities of cleverly done eccentricity. The costuming and choreography in S&S seemed a realistic depiction of the times, but I'm as poorly equipped to adjudicate now as I was for the same elements of P&P. One thing I can judge, though, is the English countryside that's like no other that I've enjoyed. Towards the end, there was the panoramic view of a wind-rippled, grassy valley sloping down to the sea, probably in Devonshire. I was so \\"homesick\\" that I teared just a trifle.<br />Because the pace of the story caused me to doze off for a couple of brief moments, I can't in good conscience award more than four and one-half stars. The review system of this site will round it up.ith her own turmoil of the heart, must support the feelings-driven Marianne as the latter careens from one emotional extreme to the next.

B00005JKDR|4.0|Disney/Pixar has created a homerun with their latest animated film. They turn the world of monsters on its head, with hilarious results.<br />Monsters James P. Sullivan, \\"Sulley\\" (John Goodman) and Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) work for Monsters, Inc. - a company that collects children's screams and turns them into electricity.<br />All is well until a child makes it through the closet door into the monster world. Then it's up to Sulley and Wazowski to try to get her back, and save her from the evil plans of Randall, the lizard.<br />The wise-cracks are almost constant in the film, making it enjoyable for both children and adults.<br />Parents do not need to worry about the monsters in the film. They are, almost entirely, humorous and non-threatening. There is little to be frightened by. However, I would caution parents that the characters frequently use the words: \\"stupid\\", \\"idiot\\", and \\"shut up\\".<br />The collector's edition 2-disc DVD contains a plethora of never-before seen footage on a separate 207-minute bonus CD.<br />It includes the animated shorts of \\"Mike's New Car,\\" and \\"For the Birds\\", the filmmaker's audio commentary, a sneak peak at Disney/Pixar's summer 2003 film, \\"Finding Nemo,\\" the Outtakes from Monster's Inc. and much, much more.<br />The amount of material on the bonus CD is unimaginable. It includes a tour of Pixar's animation studies, never-before-seen deleted scenes, a 3D location flyaround, hundreds of images from the Monstropolis Art Gallery, animation gags and a guide to \\"in\\" jokes from the film, an interactive game, and material about being an employee at Monsters, Inc.<br />If you're debating between the video and the DVD, definitely purchase the DVD. The picture and sound quality is superb, and the additional footage is worth the price.
B00005YW4H|3.0|I guess that I am unlike the many people here in that I did not buy this CD based on the comments of others.  Heck, I do not believe everything I read.  I like to experience things for myself.  I bought after listening to the first song (on an airplane).<br />It was not until I saw the many negative reviews, that I noticed the editorial review unfairly likening Norah to Nina Simone and others.  Clearly the editorial review was written by someone who had not listened to the CD.<br />As others have rightly pointed out, Norah is not a jazz \\"artiste.\\"  Norah's style is a blend of (real)country, blues, and a dash of jazz.  If you felt conned by buying the CD after listening to a song on a jazz station, I would not blame the musician.  Personally, I found the CD in the Pop/Rock aisles.  <br />Now the reason for the 3 stars:  nearly all of the songs have the same feel.  Only tracks 1 and 4 have any independence.<br />If you don't mind shelling out 15 bucks for two songs, this may be the CD for you (you can listen to 5 songs here at Amazon).  Listen for yourself.  If you like, you buy.  If it's not for you, move on down the list.
B00004U8H4|5.0|I started reading through the reviews of this movie, and over and over, I had to click on \\"No,\\" this review was not \\"helpful\\" to me, whether the person gave it one star or five stars. After reading about 20 of them, I was beginning to think that either everyone watching it just isn't getting it or I'm as whacked out as Patrick Bateman. My take on this movie seems to be completely different from everyone else's (although I didn't read all 300 reviews: maybe someone in here has my take on it).<br />First let me state my perspective. Judged by how many times I've watched it (about 10 times), this must be one of my favorite movies. I don't seem to be able to get enough of it, and my interpretation of it has evolved from bemused bafflement to a satisfied feeling that I really get it. Second, I did not read the book, and based on what I've read in these reviews, I'm glad I didn't, because I've been able to contemplate this movie without trying to relate it to the book, to contemplate it as an independent work of art that plays with the viewer's mind and challenges the viewer to figure this Patrick Bateman out. Those people responsible for it may have had some ideas triggered by the book, but this movie can stand on its own considerable merits.<br />Unlike some reviewers, I am not in the least attracted by the character of Patrick Bateman. I find him completely contemptible and repulsive, and to allude to a line from the movie, I have nothing in common with him. Yet he is fascinating to watch and I can't help laughing hysterically at his total emptiness and delusions.<br />Delusions bring up the point I want to make about this movie. At one level it is impossible to tell what is real and what is sheer delusion in Patrick Bateman's mind. What is really happening, and what is being imagined or dreamed by Patrick? Maybe he did kill a few people in this movie. But I can't tell whether he really did killed Paul Allen or whether this was merely one of his delusional fantasies. The movie surely gives enough examples of psychotic delusions on his part. Some of the things he says directly to women obviously were not actually said, because if they were, the women would have called for the bouncer to have him thrown out. As it was, they just ignore him. Some of the murders were utterly preposterous, as when he carefully aims the running chainsaw at the prostitute fleeing down the stairs and he throws it at her, stabbing her in the back when she is four flights of stairs below him. Come on! That never happened, even in the movie! Then the killing spree at the end OBVIOUSLY never happened! When he had the shootout with the cops, he takes a couple shots at them, never missing his human target from 100 yards away (do you know how hard that is?), and suddenly one of his bullets causes all the cop cars aligned against him to explode! Even HE is surprised, suddenly staring at his gun in disbelief that he could have done that with a single shot. This was such a string of carnage that it would have been all over the news and all the talk. Yet no one says a word about it when he meets with his associates the next day.<br />When he revisits the apartment where he had dead bodies hanging in every closet, the place is pristine and is for sale. There's not a word from anyone that an apartment was found full of mutilated bodies. Why? Obviously, because it was all in his imagination! After he breaks down and confesses to his lawyer that he just went on a killing spree, he lawyer laughs because it is so preposterous. Such a thing would have made the headlines, yet the lawyer thinks it's just a sick joke, and he saw Paul Allen in London the day Patrick was supposed to have killed him.<br />Yet there is ambiguity even here. All these Wall Street stockbrokers (every one of them younger than 30 and vice-presidents whose greatest status symbols are the classiness of their business cards and where they can get dinner reservations), all of them look and act alike andthey are constantly misidentifying each other. Was it really Paul Allen he killed (if he killed one of his associates at all), was it really Paul Allen the lawyer saw in London? It is impossible to say, which is one of the most amusing ironies of this eternally entertaining movie.they are constantly misidentifying each other.

B000002L80|5.0|Little Creatures is one of my all-time favorite CDs.  I know a lot of Talking Heads fans consider this album a little too pop-oriented, but I love every song on here.  This is particularly good music to sing along with, yet it still has plenty of quintessential David Byrne vocal sounds to distinguish it from non-Talking Heads music.  I still hear And She Was on the radio from time to time, proving its longevity as a quirky, fun track, but for some unexplainable reason, nobody ever seems to play Road to Nowhere anymore.  That was really the song that made me a TH fan, and I'll never forget the video with David Byrne running nonstop in the corner the whole time.  Stay Up Late is another cool song that got some air play in its day; it's not a song you would want your babysitter to listen to while she is at your house, but it's just a typically fun, unique Talking Heads song.<br />All of the remaining songs are almost as good as the single releases.  Give Me Back My Name, The Lady Don't Mind, Perfect World, and Walk It Down aren't spectacular, but they are quite enjoyable.  I especially love the chorus of The Lady Don't Mind, and the last verse of Perfect World features vintage David Byrne vocals.  Television Man comes closest to the earlier, more traditionally untraditional Talking Heads sound, and it features a great stretch of David Byrne vocal gymnastics.  As enjoyable as all of these songs are, though, none compare to the song Little Creatures.  It has a great flow to it, with interesting lyrics, and it shows how talented a singer David Byrne really is.  The entire album has a fullness and flow that most albums just do not have; I never skip any of the tracks when I play this CD.  This group's forehead-slapping music is great, but sometimes it is nice just to relax to calmer music such as this disc offers.  Clocking in at just under forty minutes in length, Little Creatures is not terribly long, especially by today's standards, but it is enjoyable from start to finish.  Some TH fans might consider this album a musical road to nowhere by this eclectic band, but in my opinion Little Creatures proves that the journey is often times the best part of the trip.inish.

B00006EXCC|5.0|Beautiful sound.  The Beach Boys made Pet Sounds for our souls; The Beatles handed us the only Revolver worth having; The Kinks fed us Face To Face as if it were a plate of fish and chips; The Who kicked us in the ribs with Who Sell Out and the Rolling Stones stroked us from head to toe with Aftermath.  It just doesn't get any better than this.  Now each one of these wonderful records has been beautifully remastered with great care.  <BR>These records popped right before we lost our innocence.  You want history this is it.<BR>Simply put you can't go wrong with Aftermath!
B00005QIPH|5.0|If you want to listen to a really really great cd you should buy The Strokes \\"This is It\\". Is is worth every 1/2 cent it costs!!!This is what real music sounds like!!
0451169514|3.0|My appreciation for this book was greatly influenced by its cumbersome length. I felt like I was trying to finish a 7 pound steak.  Sure it's delicious, but after awhile you just get tired of chewing.  Appearantly King never wrote a word he didn't like.  It took him four years to finish IT and I respect that, but I don't think anything would have been lost by omitting some passages.  Secondly, I was uncomfortable with the mature depiction of love and sexuality in his eleven-year old protagonists. I just kept wishing he had placed them in their teens.  Lastly, IT in it's pseudo-true form was a bit anti-climactic for me.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers is a must see for all Americans, young and old. With the WWII veterans who actually lived through this war and these battles commenting on the episodes throughout the series, there is no better a teacher for those of us who weren't there to be able to have somewhat of a sense of what the average American citizen had to go through for the benefit of all humanity. I believe it is safe to say that many more people, civilians and soldiers alike, would have died had it not been for these men and what they were willing to do for America and the world, and the world would be a much different (worse) place today had these men (and all other Allied soldiers) not been in that place at that time.  I can only offer my sincere thanks and gratitude to the veterans who fought for the greater good, and  to Steven Ambrose, Tom Hanks and all the veterans who came forward to tell this most important story to the world so those of us who came after can learn the many lessons that WWII has taught, and continues to teach, us.<BR>Suzanne Saenz<BR>Tucson, Arizona
B00006G8G1|4.0|La imagen , el sonido , el diseo , en conclusion un buen dvd...Para todo los amantes de maiden se los recomiendo...buena calidad ..lo unico  por lo que le pongo 4 estrellas y no 5 es porque en el disco numero 2 pensaba yo, que habria mucho mas behind de lo que esperaba , pero despues de todo es una muy buena compra!...no se decepcionaran....
6305350205|3.0|I read the book before I saw the movie. Alot was either not filmed or let on the cutting room floor. I'd be interested in seeing how much a director's cut would add back into a good story but a terrible movie!
B00000JPYD|5.0|This has always been my favorite Robin Trower album.  All the rest of his songs I like would probably fit on a 60 minute disc but that's not bad.  All the songs on here are good/great.  And some cross the border into &quot;great&quot;.  &quot;In this Place&quot; and &quot;About to Begin&quot; are two of my personal favorites.  &quot;Day of the Eagle&quot; almost sounds like Hendrix at the conclusion and &quot;Bridge of Sighs&quot; is a sound to behold even though it does get a bit repetitive at times.  If you're turning on to some of the old rock 'n roll look for this.  I was 18 when it came out.  Imagine that.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|This movie is sooo good! The casting is perfect, the score is amazing! The jokes are new and are refreshingly funny. The plot is solid which revolves around Derek Zoolander, international supermodel. Evil fashion designer Mugatu is hired by a fashion crime group to make a model assasinate the Malysian Prime Minister who will abolish child labor which will make the price of making clothes increase many times. After Zoolander makes a stupid mistake at the VH1 Fashion Awards Mugatu decides that he will be the one. He then brainwashes Zoolander to kill the Prime Minister when he hears the song \\"Relax\\". Zoolander would have killed the prime minister if it wasn't for competing supermodel Hansel who saves the day and turns Mugatu in. The film is phenomenal and I highly recommend it for anyone from 8+.
B0000041Z5|5.0|Brahms - one of the greatest symphonists the world has ever known.<BR>Solti - one of the SUPERCONDUCTORS of the twentieth century.<BR>This recording - one of the legendary recordings of Brahms symphonies. The best I have ever heard. This recording won 2 Grammys in 1979. Best Classical Album and Best Orchestral Performance. It is deserving of the 2 Grammys indeed. And small wonder that Decca decided to reissue the album.<br />Sir Georg Solti conducts with FIRE and POWER in these recordings. Decca's recording engineers have done a fabulous job in the recording. You couldn't tell the difference between this recording and Digital recording. FABULOUS performances. The incredible thing about this album is the price. At $28, this works out to a budget price of only $7 per CD. I VERY VERY STRONGLY recommend this set of CDs. <br />Brahms was considered one of teh greatest symphonists (after Beethoven). If you are a classical music lover, this album is a MUST!!!!
B000002KGT|5.0|This is a great album.  For years, I lived in denial of that fact.  I believed that Fleetwood Mac, especially Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks were pretentious, talentless and just plain annoying.  They are, but that does not take away from this incredible album.<BR>Every song on the album is at least a good song, many are great.  The Chain is the best album on the album, perhaps because it was the only one written collectively, I don't know, but it is absolutely fantastic.<BR>Other than that every other song is solid, deliverying everything you could want out of an album.  It flows beautifully.  The band knowing when to pick things up, and then turn it back down a notch.<BR>The song has many hits that would be recognizable to even a casual fan, as most of the songs on here were released as singles, and you could here any of these tracks on any classic rock stations today.<BR>The album ends with another classic, Gold Dust Woman.  It's a chilling song, and is the perfect way for the album to close.<BR>This album today is still one of the top selling albums of all time, ranking in the top 10, if not the top 5.<BR>Unfortunately for them, the Mac never lived up to this incredible album, but go out and get.  This is an essential album for any collection, no matter what your taste.
B0000024IE|5.0|I was a fan of the group when I first heard &quot;Rebel Without a Pause&quot; and &quot;Don't Believe the Hype&quot; from their second album, which I own.  I had to get their third album because I collect old school hits and the songs remind me of the good times I had in high school.  The duo Chuck D and Flava Flav lyrically promote Afrocentricity with humor and seriousness.  &quot;911 Is a Joke&quot; and &quot;Welcome to the Terrordome&quot; are their best hits on the CD.  &quot;Can't Do Nuttin' For You Man&quot; is also another hit song that I like.  Then again all of the songs on the CD are great!
B000002OX7|5.0|This is essential &quot;Who&quot;.  It is also essential Rock &amp; Roll.  This album is easily one of the top rock albums of all time.  This will always sound good, even over 30 years later.  The other reviewers have said it for me;  &quot;Bargain&quot;, &quot;The Song is Over&quot;, &quot;Mobile&quot;, these are some of the Who's greatest and there's more; &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot;, &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot;, &quot;Baba O'Riley&quot; (Teenage Wasteland), are all classic rock songs.  If you could only own one Who album, this would have to be it.  I just have one question;  Does anyone remember a song by the Who named &quot;Call Me Lightning&quot;?  I believe it was released as a single in '68.  I've never seen it on any of their albums or discs.
B00000JGHM|5.0|If you want to test your Surround-Sound and accuracy under fire power (pun intended), Chapter 32 is a must-test case -- gunfire as it should be (also try &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot;). The story is good (4 stars), but the professionalism of everything else boosts (4.5 stars).
B0000691TJ|5.0|Normally I might be a little cynical about these re-issue CDs. I bought every Ramones record on vinyl when I was a kid. Then I later bought them on CD, and it wasn't all that long ago. Now they expect me to buy them AGAIN? Is this just a record lable/conglomerate trying to squeeze more money out of a band that never really achieved \\"financial success\\" for them? I don't know. What I do know is that these new re-releases are worth every damn penny I paid for them. Each booklet is packed to the gills with great photos and informative retrospectives on what was going on with the band around the time the album was recorded. Best of all, they include outtakes, demo versions, B sides etc. Casual fans should think twice before buying, but if you consider yourself a \\"true Ramones fan\\" then you really owe it to yourself to grab these new re-issues. You'll get your money's worth.<br /><br />The best nuggets on the Too Tough To Die re-issue are the UK B sides to the Howling At the Moon single, which are a cover of the Stones' Street Fighting Man and Smash You, which was recorded during the TTTD sessions but almost sounds like a classic 70s Ramones song. Also, a demo version of Howling At the Moon, which is just guitar, drums, bass and vocals. It sounds so much better than the overproduced synth-heavy version that ended up on the album, it's depressing that they intentionally ruined such a great song. I was hoping the original UK 12 inch version of Bonzo Goes to Bitburg would be here, since it was a single that was released so close to this album, but hopefully it'll show up on the Animal Boy re-issue.<br /><br />EDIT Oct 17, 2013: Well, it's been over 10 years since I wrote this review... guess I can stop waiting for the Animal Boy re-issue. No worries, all in all I agree with whoever made the decision to stop at Too Tough To Die. It was all downhill from here.)
B00005JL3A|4.0|RESIDENT EVIL was a great Capcom videogame (with many successful versions) with a very simple plot: someone must do something in order to solve a mystery. In this basic outline, the character must cross many different spaces (each has its obstacles) and accomplish smaller missions, that help him to gather objects that lead to peaces of information leading to a final confrontation. Period.<br />The good thing is that the adaptation for Cinema of that basic game structure is reasonably well made. The result is this: a group of top-soldiers is sent inside a secret corporate lab complex where a lethal virus has been spread. They have a few hours to a) discover what happened, b) disable and neutralize the virus and c) get out.<br />Like the game, the complications rearrange the order of priorities and the journey is constantly being redesigned according to the new obstacles found. Like the game, some characters have secret agendas and everything leads to the high-powered action confrontation scene.<br />Put like this, it all seems cerebral, but don't missunderstand me: the film is very entertaining! If the story/screenplay design is (in this case) simple, it is because film is not for the cinemateque. It is pure (and good!) fun. It has a lot of rhythm, the cast is appealing, the characters are fine (in their game-like dimension) and the action makes you jump.<br />Even if you do not play the game (or even know nothing about it) you will understand it perfectly for the screenplay was designed for a wider audience. In this sense, the film is constructed so you'll get early on all the information that you need for the rest of the film.<br />I liked it very much and I believe this to be the best game-to-film adaptation ever made. It works even for those who did not play the game and it delivers a simple plot with lots of interesting twists and great action scenes.<br />The ending is begging for a sequel (but you know that already) and - I have to admit - it is a great ending (and it alone worths the whole film!). Great art direction (doesn't have much to do with the game). Good soundtrack.<br />The extras are fine and they're mostly on the technical side (why wouldn't they be?). Milla Jovovich is absolutely beautiful. Despite the fact that we are dealing here with game characters, I do think that Milla gives a great performance. Furthermore, I do think she is capable of taking higher flights in the future. Aside of that, she is someone the camera trully loves.<br />See it and have fun!g (and it alone worths the whole film!).

0316666343|5.0|I usually choose mystery and courtroom books as my genre.  I read a review of the Lovely Bones and decided to give this book a try.  It was written beautifully and the story was compelling.  The character were extremely well developed and the depiction of the growth of Susie's friends and family over the years was terrific.  I have recommended this book to everyone I know.
0060977493|5.0|I read this book back in the summer of '97. Now, that was a pretty (bad) year. I was loosing my job and my girlfriend, my sister was loosing her mind and my other sister lost a child. All in all - 1997 simply (was bad).<br />There was only one good thing about that summer: The God of Small Things. Every afternoon, I'd read another chapter of it in the park, then just sit contemplating it for an hour or so, surrounded by people more happy than myself.<br />The God of Small Things. It is simply wonderful. Such a mysterious, yet mundane and thouroughly believable intrigue. What prose! What wit! What genious!<br />The God of Small Things managed, by itself, to bring my life appreciation average for the year 1997 up \\"ok, after all\\". Well done!<br />I love this book. And I even feel that it is a love requited. It loves me back, I think.<br />Arundhati Roy has said she'll write no more novels after this. That's ok. The one she did write was so satisfying, so giving and so engrossing that she doesn't really need to serve up seconds. I'm well sated, and have no want for more. Thank you.
B00005Y228|1.0|this is one of the most annoying cd's i've ever been forced to listen to (by a cheesy disco-loving spouse). normally i love dance music but &quot;fever&quot; just leaves me cold. i guess the music is catchy in a poppy, bouncing up and down, shake your booty kind of way, but i can't get past the unbelievably insipid lyrics.  it's as if she took a book of song cliches and randomly pulled phrases out of it.  the only saving grace is that kylie is so obviously a one hit wonder and she will soon retreat to the other side of the pacific, never to be heard from again.

I am a huge fan of the comic book and I waited so long for the movie to come out, when i saw it, i couldn't believe how bad it was.  I hated it.  They critics went so easy on it. Kirsten Dunst made a horrible Mary-Jane.  Todey McGuire was a pretty good Peter Parker but [wasn't good] as Spider-Man.  This movie was a joke.  P.S.  The Green Goblin's costume was retarted and it [was bad].  Make it like the comic book.  P.S.S.   I hope the Hulk isn't this bad
B00005K9LK|4.0|SCREAMING FOR VENGEANCE, no doubt a classic album, cannot be rated five stars for one simple reason: a real classic five-stars album has all of tis songs from good to absolutely great.<br />But here in SCreaming we have the dreadful and awful PAIN AND PLEASURE, something so mean that I can´t believe Judas put it into a record.<br />I agree with a reviewer that said that, starting with BRITISH STEEL, Judas became more and more commercial up until RAM IT DOWN, where things reached a point where a total rupture from what they were doing was the only solution, and they did it with PAINKILLER (a great, but overrated album).<br />But this album here has his just bunch of great songs: Riding on The Wind, Electric Eye, Bloodstone and Screaming for Vengeance are fantastic tracks. As some other reviewers said, I also think You`ve Got Another THing COmin´is one of the worst songs of the album, very weak and overrated.
B000069HKH|5.0|Bruce Springsteen used to be one of my very favorite musicians, and his new album, The Rising, reminds me why.  This album, Bruce's first with the E Street Band in years, is as plentiful and abundant as popular music can be.  <br />As you might expect, the foundation of this album is Bruce Springsteen's stellar songwriting.  The Boss writes melodic, infectious hooks laced with universal and engaging lyrics.  This great songwriting is equaled by outstanding musical performance.  Bruce Springsteen's vocals are at their best on this album, and the E Street Band provides marvelous support for their lead singer.  Together this group plays like they're glad to be back together; there's an undercurrent of enthusiasm, sincerity, and soul that pervades the tracks on this disc.  <br />The Boss was touched by the atrocity of 9/11 enough to write music about it, and this album can certainly be cited in the annals of history as part of pop culture's reflection of our day.  I doubt I will ever forget the first time I heard Bruce perform \\"My City of Ruins\\" on television following the pernicious attack on the World Trade Center.  Like never before, Bruce Springsteen TRULY WAS the voice of the American people; his message collectively represented the anguish, love, sorrow, and hope that everyone felt during our unprecedented national crisis.  <br />If there was ever doubt about Springsteen's status as a rock and roll legend, that performance after 9/11 dispelled it.  For anyone who still needs convincing, have a good listen to this new album.  The Rising is America in 2002, and it's an outstanding compilation of songs from one of our greatest pop icons.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I rated this series 5 stars.  If I could, I'd give another 5 stars.<br />I can't recommend this collection highly enough.  It should be shown in schools to let the kids of today really understand WWII and the men who fought it.<br />Everything about this production is first class; writing, directing, cinematography and acting.  Saving Private Ryan was the training ground for Spielberg and Hanks to make this tribute to not only E Company but everyone who has been to war.<br />I had dropped HBO years before, but got a subscription long enough to tape all 10 episodes and the documentary \\"We Stand Alone Together\\" where you get to meet some of the real men from Easy Company depicted in the series.  After you see the entire series, you will know the men and understand how and why they react as they did in certain situations.  You also learn how arbitrary, painful, and senseless war is. This should win all 19 Emmey Awards it's been nominated for.<br />The book \\"Band of Brothers\\" by Stephen Ambrose (the basis for the series) is a great read as well and the series follows the text almost to the letter.  A tribute to Ambrose for writing a book that could translate to the screen completely intact.<br />This is a must for any DVD collection.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|For the first 1/2 hour, we seriously debated whether this was a Mel Brooks spoof or a serious movie.  Frankly, it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and this would be the type of movie I would like.  The actors could not sing (take a page from My Fair Lady and dub voices as necessary, guys).  We were shocked that anyone could sit through the entire thing.
B00005LMWI|3.0|Oh, boy, if they could at least get rid of that same old double bass drums present in almost all tracks...! With the passing of songs, it gets so boring and repetitive, you´ll feel a headache!! For example, in THE SPELL, they use normal bass drum, and the song is much more enjoyable.<br />The songs themselves are great, and KHan is surely a phenomenal lead singer, but to say that KAMELOT is different from those other hundred European power metal bands must be a joke! KAMELOT is exactly about the same stuff: heroic and epic lyrics, the obligatory one or two power ballads, orchestra and keyboard sound all aorund (what make it difficult to play the songs live with the same atmosphere), a song divided in two or three parts, a high-pitched singer, etc, etc. The album was even recorded in Germany, for God´s sake, the land of producer Sascha Paeth, the same talented guy who produces a LOT of European power metal bands!!<br />By saying they are not different I´m not saying thay are bad, much on the contrary: the level of musicianship is very, very high. Youngblood plays his guitar with passion, Khan does what he wants with his voice. Of course in this kind of band you can barely hear the bass player but, well, nobody´s perfect...<br />Overall, a great album, but not so much better than THE FOURTH LEGACY, as so many people wrote here.
0783229526|5.0|...Based on Hunter S. Thompson's book written of real life experiences. Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro play they're roles beautifully. Fear and Loathing is the all american dream. Its not just a \\"stoner movie\\". Its about the coulture of the 60's coming to an end. The amazing adventures that 2 hippies face while they go on a business trip. Theres a rainbow of pills, coke, acid, ether, weed, and of course, alcohol. All of which they keep in a breifcase. The beginning of the movie is full of snorting, eating, and mindless jabber. Once they get to Vegas, jounerlist Raoul Duke (Depp) and his lawyer Dr.Gonzo (Del Torro) have to go to a motorcyle race to write an article. Through the course of this crazy trip, they encounter lots of mishaps. \\"You can't park your car here\\" \\"I think its a resonable place\\" Its one of my favorite movies, and it always makes me laugh
B000069AUI|5.0|Totally agree with previous comments. Its a great album, great voice, great band, great songs. You cant NOT like it!<BR>Loved almost every song in this album.
B00006EXCC|5.0|On April 15, 1966, Decca Records in England issued The Rolling Stones' fourth UK album - AFTERMATH.  Featuring 14 tracks - for the first time all composed by Mick Jagger &amp; Keith Richard, it was a # 1 smash and showed that The Stones were up to the challenge of The Beatles and RUBBER SOUL.  What ultimately made it out in America that June was a very different version of this OFFICIAL and AUTHORITATIVE album.  &quot;Paint It Black&quot; - just a single in the UK, was shoved on in the place of &quot;Mother's Little Helper&quot; and then the US album was whittled down to a mere 11 tracks.  DO NOT buy the US version - the music is great, of course, but it is not how The Rolling Stones and producer Andrew Loog Oldham intended it to be.  THIS, finally, is the real article.  For the time (1966), at 53 minutes, AFTERMATH was a very long album.  The first half of it is like a greatest hits album (&quot;Mother's Little Helper&quot;, &quot;Stupid Girl&quot;, &quot;Lady Jane&quot;, &quot;Under My Thumb&quot; and the outstanding 11-minute blues work-out &quot;Goin' Home&quot;.  Brian Jones, picking up on George Harrison's use of the sitar, began exploring exotic instruments and AFTERMATH benefited enormously from them.  Sitars, marimbas and dulcimers abound here and Mick &amp; Keith made a real breakthrough songwriting-wise.  &quot;Out Of Time&quot; (in the second half) is also a compositional highlight, though it is a bit long.  However the last half does have its somewhat average moments with mediocre tracks like &quot;Take It Or Leave It&quot;, though they are still pleasant songs.  But the majority of the winners are to be found in the first half of AFTERMATH and those tracks are the ones which has secured the album's enduring legacy.  Even with the odd moment of weakness, the overall effect of the album is so strong that a 5 star rating is justified.  Not THE best Rolling Stones album, but a classic and their best THUS far.  As songwriters, Mick &amp; Keith never lookedback after AFTERMATH.
B000005RFQ|2.0|Whatever merits this album has, they were buried in the absolutely obnoxious production, the worst of Black Sabbath career.<br />For those who say this is great, I must remind you that Iommi himself confessed that this would be a new project, and not a Sabbath album, but the record company did not aloud it.<br />Also, it marked the beginning of the chair dancing that Sabbath would become, when led exclusively by Iommi.<br />As for the songs, TRASHED is by far the best. IT´s like a thunder on the roll, strong, powerful, like a snowball going downhill and sweapting everything aside!! BORN AGAIN is also very good.<br />The trouble, I repeat, is the production. no more comments.
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayers album is wonderful,get it.
B000066I6N|1.0|HUGE  FAN  OF  LED  ZEPPLEIN  AND  ROBERT PLANT,  THIS  IS  ONE  OF  THE  WORST  ALBUMS  I'VE  EVER  BOUGHT,  WHAT  A  WASTE OF  MY  MONEY
0060989157|5.0|I picked this book up becaue at the time, I couldn't find anything better. I was an 80's child and although I did like Motley, I prefered their more pop tours, like \\"girls, girls, girls\\" and \\"Dr. Feelgood\\", not so much the heavier rock like \\"Shout at the Devil\\". Id rather listen to (and look at) Poison and Bon Jovi. But who couldnt be in love with Vince, Tommy, and Nikki, anyway? So going into it indifferently, I opened the book and did not put it down until the last 430 long pages. Holy cow!! What a read. It is lewd and crewed, it is Motley crue. The book is set up different, each band member and occasionally a manager or a big wig from a elektra records will have there own chapter, it may be a small chapter or not, but its like they are talking to you directly, telling you there own expierences from the very first years of Motley to the present. And its funny how they have their own stories and disagree with one another, like who was the cause of this certain fight, etc.. But not so funny was so much info and hardship that they each expierenced in their own right. My God, who knew? Mick Mars is a skitzo, Tommy is starving for attention, Nikki is or strives to be the leader and Vince is a sex maniac! (Well they are pretty much all big time sex driven :) unreal some of these stories!!) The way it is written in their own words, litterally, you can actually hear it, for example, Tommy's chapters are filled with \\"dude\\" and \\"yo bro\\". But it is purly a book that you can no way put down, each chapter leaves you in suspense for what happened next in the tour, or in the lives. Be warned, if you have virgin ears (or eyes in this case) this book is in no way for you. The amount of talk about sex and drugs is the majority, and it is in no way proper. It is almost porn. It is just true to life and pure Motley Crue.
B000002KMY|5.0|Ronnie James Dio is a legend still nowadays for one simple reason, I guess... He was capable of being part in seven (SEVEN!...) consecutive rock releases that are heralded as classics today! Unbeliavable. The ercords were:<br />* THe three albums he did with RAINBOW (RITCHIE BLACKMORE´S RAINBOW, RISING, LONG LIVE ROCK N´ROLL)<BR>* The two with Sabbath (HEAVEN AND HELL, MOB RULES)<BR>* THe first two of his solo career (HOLY DIVER, LAST IN LINE).<br />So, by any standard, MOB RULES is classic. Its mood is fantastic, courtesy of Martin Birch again. We have Vinnie Appice here and, altough he adds his personal talent in a  amrvellous way, this unfortunately poited to a dark future for Sabbath, being forced to change a band member once again.<br />\\"TUrn Up THe Night\\", \\"Sign of the Southern Cross\\" and \\"Falling Off The Edge Of The World\\" are the gems here, but I like them all!!
B00003CXI1|3.0|Although they crammed a lot of details into the movie, the book is the book, and nothing can surpass the brilliant writing. As movies go, this one is very entertaining and wonferfully safe for children. Casting is brilliant, and the pace of the movie is just right. No luls, some nice suprises, etc. My only complaint is with the special features the DVD boasts. Many were on the website previous to the movie, and the die hard fans wanted something fresh and exciting to see. Where are the behind the scenes looks, and character profiles? Not on here!
B00006GFAB|2.0|How much money will it take before Gene and Paul are satisfied?  &quot;Greatest Kiss&quot;, &quot;You Wanted The Best, You Got The Best&quot;, &quot;Double Platinum&quot;, &quot;Alive 1,2,3...&quot;, &quot;Double Platimum&quot;, the box set.  Maybe you need this album if you've never heard Kiss before (yes, you 100 year old Australian Aborigine, I'm talking to you) but most everybody else should have had enough of the &quot;best of&quot; by now to last for the rest of their lives.  This album?  I'm skipping it and I think you should to.  Of course, that's just my opinion, I could be wrong.
B00005RFAI|1.0|Pink (more so than Brittney) is the utmost example of the puppeteer business of having a record deal.  Pink has a good voice, but the &quot;no one likes me, no one understands me&quot; act is irritating and tiring.  She tries so hard to be different, that it comes off as a pure ACT. Wasn't she R&amp;B before?  Don't tell me she's another Mariah coming out of her &quot;True&quot; shell.<BR>She name-drops too much, but I give her credit for effort in writing lyrics that TRY to be controversial.  If one is indeed so original and controversial, she wouldn't have to try so hard, and it would show!
B000006ZDQ|5.0|I´ll not compare Ozzy with Dio, old Sabbath with new Sabbath. I´ll just &quot;judge&quot; HEAVEN AND HELL&quot; for what it is: a master piece. Eight fantastic original tunes, each with its own particular feeling and atmosphere. Well, the lyrics by Dio are usual confusing stuff, but, whatever...<br />British producer Martin Birch pulled out another trick to add another classic album to his famous discography. In this period of time (1980) he was not working with Iron Maiden yet. He set Geezer´s bass well clear and loud in the mix, asdded a crisp and crystal clear sound to Ward´s drums and helped Tony to sound the best of his career ever. All that taken into consideration, the final result was a new band, not the classic Sabbath sound.<br />It´s a real shame to rock history that Dio would last only for two albums with Sabbath.
B00006G8G1|4.0|This is without question the best live show Iron Maiden has done since \\"Live After Death\\" was released in 1985. The only draw back for me was the song list. I wanted more classic and less recent. It has both, but the new songs like \\"Bloodbrothers\\", and \\"The Ghost Of Navigators\\" didn't need to be here IMO.....<br />To be quite honest, I've never seen Iron Maiden play tighter than this. B. Dickinson sounded great, the trio of guitars sounds much better live as well IMO. The stage is awesome as usual, and the crowd is one of the largest I've ever seen....<br />The quality of this DVD is top shelf, as is the sound and camera work. I was very happy after seeing this for the first time. Actually, as much as I hate to say it, I was expecting a bunch of old geezers struggling to stay on top of their form. What I witnessed, kicked me in the teeth!!!...Maiden has lost nothing!<br />This will certainly go down as one of the best live Heavy Metal performances you can buy on DVD today. Maiden is in top form here, and they've proven that they are the true \\"Gods Of Heavy Metal\\".....<br />\\"Rock In Rio\\" = 4 1/2 stars....\\"Live After Death\\" = 5.<br />UP THE IRONS!!!!
B00005ABIP|5.0|They have steel guitars, country-rock and 80s new wave influences, a brilliant trumpet player doubling on keyboards, bass lines that walk like the funky chicken, smart, almost-spoken lyrics and a social conscience with a sense of humor. They are Cake, and words do not describe.  This third release from the Sacramento-native band is less raw than Motorcade of Generosity and less angry than Fashion Nugget, but it stands out as the most consistently excellent album in their catalog.  Those who heard only the radio hit &quot;Never There&quot; might be surprised to learn that while it's similar to their other earlier radio-rotated &quot;Going the Distance,&quot; it's more of an anomaly in their overall repertoire. There's no disappointment in that, though - from the sweet, twangy, and lyrically brilliant &quot;Mexico&quot; to the raucous sing-along power of &quot;Sheep Go To Heaven&quot;, Cake hops gaps between genres and never fails to deliver a better mood.  If you don't like this CD, you'll find someone in your close circle of friends who will be happy to capitalize on your bad taste and take it off your hands.

0553573403|4.0|George R.R. Martin does a masterful job creating a fantasy world in \\"A Game of Thrones\\". This book is a great addition to the fantasy world and should be picked up by anyone who is looking for a good read. While this book is written more for adult readers, it is a book that can be enjoyed by anyone. It is pretty long (800+ pages), but the action, intrigue, drama, and suspense keep the book going from the front cover, to the back.<br />A few things that make this book appeal more to an adult audience would include:<br />1. There is a lot of cursing. The characters will use curse words quite a bit in some of their conversations.<br />2. There is a lot of sexual scenes in the book, many of which are highly descriptive and involve younger characters.<br />3. There is some highly descriptive violence. Many scenes go in depth in deaths and murders.<br />4. While not a reason for being \\"adult\\", but this book is very richly detailed. Some younger readers would have trouble following all the plot lines and sub-plots that go on throughout the book. I know I had trouble following some of the plots, and I have been reading fantasy books for a long time.<br />All in all, this book is a definate must read. Martin created a fantasy world that is so richly detailed and so realistic, that it actually feels like you could be interacting with the characters. This book pulls on the reader's emotions as well. You will absolutely love some characters, while you will totally despise others. You will be sad for some, and happy for others. If you are looking for a book to take your mind off of everyday life and pulls you into a world of its own, this is the one. Check it out.
B000021Y77|5.0|A photographer's film. Absolute art. Color, composition, story  &amp; soundtrack combine to make this an A+ film.
B000069AUI|5.0|when i heard the first cd it was great. i couldn't wait for the 2nd cd to come out. i bought it the day it did and i love it. all the songs, they are great. if you liked the 1st cd you'll love the 2nd. i strongly suggest to buy it.
B000069AUI|5.0|It's a little difficult to type this because there are chills running down my spine.  The rush of emotion that this CD brings always makes me marvel at the way Coldplay put the simplest riffs on top of mellow harmonies to create something so powerful.  They have mastered the art of word painting, where the music collides perfectly with the lyric's meaning.  This is not a CD that requires repeated listening; the brilliance is clear the first time around. If you have seen them perform live, you know their sound doesn't come from the art of production in the studio; they create it all themselves. I was perfectly content with their first album, and if their second one had flopped I would have been grateful for its single contribution to my music collection - but they have done more than make a mark this time - they have made history in my book!

B0000214F0|4.0|CALIGULA is an adult film with adult subjects. This is NOT for everyone to see - especially children and even adults who may be offended by this REAL historical persons existence. This movie is Malcolm McDowell. He shines in this feature from beginning to bloody end. The film came out in 1979 to very mixed reviews. The original release was later cut to achieve a strong \\"R\\" and most of the sequences that were cut were shelved and now released in their entirety. It was originally an \\"X\\" - for graphic violence and free sex - not pornography.<br />Directed by the Italian director - screen named Tinto Brass, the film takes you on a journey through the life of a very sick man. The film has quite a cast starting off with Malcolm McDowell in the lead role. In this production you can find the masterful talents of Peter O'Toole, Helen Mirren and John Geilgood.<br />The production value is very high and the costumes and set design are extraordinaire. TO think a man like this existed is sick. The film is not for the week stomach.<br />I liked this film for the performances and the production design overall, but the story is amazing and the details very clear. This is one you might want to rent before you buy. I bought it because I love the film moir&eacute;. (8-27-02)
B000066NW0|5.0|All I can say about this album is WOW!. I wasn't sure about buying the album but I got bored of complicated after awhile and wanted to hear more of Avril's music, So I bought her album. I would reccomend it to anyone, it's fantastic! Go Avril!
B000066NW0|2.0|Okay, honestly this album is not as bad as I thought it would be. However, the entire &quot;punk&quot; persona Avril claims to devote her music to is far from center. I'm not a fan of hardcore punk music but I have heard it and 'Let Go' is not that. Obviously this is female pop-rock, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with it in general, but when you want the public to percieve you as an alternative, rebellious, non comformist who despises top pop acts of the day..and then put out an album which has mainstream pop written all over it..you're just beggin to be criticized. Fellow female artists you could compare such as Michelle Branch, Vanessa Carlton, and Alanis Morisette do not present a false image musically or literally. Avril Lavinge will most likely become a success due to the part of mass media hype and industry appraisal...there's no denying it.
0553106635|3.0|I was reading this book over a friend's place and she asked me what the book is about. I told her \\"Death. Sex. Blood.\\" In that order. <br />There has been more explicit foul language and violence than in any other fantasy book and it is growing more and more with every book. Some find that realistic. I find it rather tiresome. If I want explicit rape and violence, there are always the late news on TV. <br />I wish not some many characters died. ... Who's left alive after all? ... Just good old Mr Dwarf making up for every goner. At least one face I want to see no matter how ugly he can be. <br />I bet you are wondering by now why I would read to the end such a book? Truth is, I'm curious. The good thing about is that you never know what happens next. Anyone can die. Anything can happen. You don't expect anything because things are going sooo fast. It's always keeping you on edge. Good guys die after all. But there comes the question who the good guys are. Every character is very deeply profound and complicated. There is nothing only black or white. There is always a little of both. This makes the characters intriguing and exciting. <br />I still reserve my right to be partial to them. I don't like Catelyn and I have to admit I'm happy I will read no more \\"Catelyn\\" titled chapters. But, on the other hand, there are too many names I wouldn't see as titles any more. <br />I rate the volume lower than the previous ones because I think the first two were better, otherwise, if I don't have them in mind, my mark is 4. Maybe it is because my expectations were higher. Characters, although human, sometimes make no sense. Robb chooses to preserve a woman's dignity by marrying her even if this means he would lose a war and many, many other would be raped and lose their dignity. It's like watching a chess tournament when a player sacrifises the queen to save a pawn.<br />I will still look forward and buy the next book. It's an interesting book and I don't quit on such.
B000069HK2|3.0|After hearing &quot;A Box Full of Sharp Objects&quot;, I expected the other songs to be more similiar, however they ended up sounding like a cross between Blink-182 and Hoobstank, which isn't a good thing for me. Don't get me wrong, The Used is better than both of those bands, but they just have that same tired sound that's so common among &quot;Rock&quot; music these days. That's not to say all the songs are bad, it's just that most of them sound so boring and cliche'. <br />However, there are definently a few exceptions such as &quot;Buried Myself Alive&quot; and &quot;A Box Full of Sharp Objects&quot; and a few others, but really, it just wasn't enough.<br />I honesntly wanted to give the cd 4 stars, but just couldn't bring myself to do it, even though I did enjoy some of the songs *immensely*. <br />Unfortunately, this is yet another MTV friendly band that I definently had high hopes for. I suggest you only buy this cd if you like bands such as Hoobastank. If not, then download the best songs and that will be that.
B000067CPX|5.0|Before listening to this album, I thought to myself, it surely can't be as good as Californication.  I thought they had peaked and were now going to put out mediocre albums to try and please their fans.  But I was so wrong.  This album is incredible in ever sense of the word.  No aspect of perfect musicality is compromised.  The lyrics are personal and moving.  The melodys play like those rare, polished, and now almost extinct pop songs, combined with the unmistakable funk and fast beats that always go along with the Peppers' tunes.  There is no reason not to listen to this album!  Songs like Don't Forget Me, the Zephyer Song, Midnight, and Cabron could make any other band incredibly successful, but with the Peppers, they just go in the large pile of perfection that we are always going to expect from them from now on.
B00001ZULV|5.0|This 78 minute disc is a 18 track collection of most of Genesis biggest hits.<br />Unfortunately a vast majority of the songs on here are from the period with Phil Collins on lead vocals. While I am a HUGE, HUGE fan of Collins this CD doesn't have enough of the music Genesis made during the 1969-1975 line-up with Peter Gabriel on lead vocals although it does have one track from Selling England By The Pound. This CD should've had less songs from the Phil Collins era so to make more space for some of the PG era songs. While this CD probably did a bad injustice to the Peter Gabriel era works this collection has the song Congo from the tragically underrated Calling All Stations. Including at least Congo from that almost forgotten gem at least does Ray Wilson some justice by at least having CAS not being cut out of the picture completely. For this reason I don't lop a star off the rating of this CD.<br />Another thing that keeps this CD a five is the rerecording of the Carpet Crawlers under the original line-up. You'll just have to hear it for yourself. I personally love it.<br />For a band that has had so many hits from the mid 70s through the early 90s this CD even with almost 79 minutes of music, doesn't represent enough of their best music. While I love just about every song on here this CD should've been entitled \\"Greatest Hits: The Phil Collins years\\". I do recommend this for the novice fanbase, the completists or die hard fans(I fall into this category). I completely disagree with those who said Genesis sold out when they suddenly became superstars. The way I view it, Genesis were an incredible band that got the notice and popularity they deserved. Unfortunately leaving so much of the Peter Gabriel era works off this disc is an injustice to the 30+ year career of this incredible chamaleon band.<br />The ultimate bet is to go out on a buying spree and buy all of Genesis albums.<br />These CDs I especially recommend: Invisible Touch, Selling England By The Pound, Trick Of The Tail, Calling All Station(BUY THIS ONE ESPECIALLY!) & We Can't Dance. All others I didn't mention are also must-haves too but the ones I mentioned I recommend the most.<br />This CD shouldn't be left alone either. It's worth having just because it's Genesis. :)<br />LOVE LIVE GENESIS!d, Trick Of The Tail, Calling All Station(BUY THIS ONE ESPECIALLY!) & We Can't Dance. All others I didn't mention are also must-haves too but the ones I mentioned I recommend the most. <br />This CD shouldn't be left alone either. It's worth having just because it's Genesis. :) <br />LOVE LIVE GENESIS!
B00005RY7X|5.0|This is the single most fun and happy album ever. Andrew W.K. is the only metal band I could ever picture playing on Sesame Street. People take him too seriously. They compare him to Zeppelin and Van Halen. These two genres are completely different. They took themselves seriously. I say Andrew W.K. should go on tour with Dio. I'd pay excessive amounts of money to see that.
B00006EXDM|5.0|I'm not an expert on the sixties era Rolling Stones<BR>but I was very familiar with the Hot Rocks collections,<BR>both this edition and the More Hot Rocks collection. I was<BR>very impressed with the mastering job on this to say the least.<BR>The '86 CD edition fell flat in a number of ways, this corrects the muddy and flat sound. This is probably over kill, but here's a number of thoughts on the tracks. Even if you don't own a SACD player, you hear a huge difference on a conventional CD player.<br />Time Is On My Side - This sort of represents the R n B side of this band. Great stereo mix of this track with a lot of clarity.<BR>Huge difference over the mono version from the '86 CD print.<br />Heart Of Stone - Another stereo mix, the lead guitar alone is so much clearer. the lyric just shows how edgey with tounges in cheek this band was back then.<br />Play With Fire - Same mono mix as before but with better clarity,<BR>check out the mix on that keyboard track!<br />Satisfaction - Of course their all time classic, great and welcomed stereo mix with the acoustic guitar filling the sound and clear.<br />As Tears Go By - A favorite, yet one of the reasons why people complained about why the Stones were imitating the Beatles too much during the early sixties. Even if it's a bit of a take off<BR>on 'Yesterday', still a great song. Same mono mix.<br />Get Off Of My Cloud - Great tune, seems imitavtive of what The Kinks were doing around that time. Much better mono mix of this.<BR>great lead guitar fill!<br />Mother's Little Helper - The Mono Mix of this, not that fake stereo mix from the '86 CD. Another classic.<br />19th Nervous Breakdown - Probably my all time favorite of their<BR>sixties era, the bass line is so much clearer on this mix, fantastic!<br />Paint It Black - Of course another classic of that time, this stereo mix is just wonderful.<br />Under My Thumb - This songs is one of the reasons why anyone could never accuse the Stones of being politically correct. J/K Not much of a difference between this mix and the 86' edition, still a major improvement though.<br />Ruby Tuesday - Great ballad, brings back memories, again simply<BR>reinforces why this remaster is such an improvement.<br />Let's Spend The Night Together - You can hear the left channel guitar so much better on this edition<br />The stereo mixes on the following tracks are just an major improvement, Jumpin' Jack Flash - Street fighting Man - Sympathy<BR>For The Devil.<br />Honky Tonk Women - Welcome edition of the stereo mix of this, the horns don't feel as cluttered as they did in the 86' edition<BR>which had the mono mix of this great song.<br />Again, different, yet not different are the remaining tracks -<BR>Gimmie Shelter - Midnight Rambler (live) - You Can't Always Get<BR>What You Want - Brown Sugar - Wild Horses<br />Everything has so much more presence and clarity, my only complaint is that I wish they had included lyrics with this<BR>remaster. Oh Well, You Can't Always Get What You Want, indeed.
B00005K3O0|3.0|Okay now that my Brady colors have been revealed let me say Marsha Mason is the best part of this. I bought this b/c of the great Anthony Hopkins but honestly, in this picture he is upstaged. Marsha Masons performance even rivals the great performance of Ellen Burstyn in the Exorsist. Still, the movie has a few too many weak points to be great. <BR>  <BR>Most notably, the courtroom scenes. This case would be thrown out, no doubt about it. The jury would have no evidence they could examine out in the open and even having the scenes in the movie sorely undermines the credibility of the story. <BR>  <BR>The husband is decent, a bit overbearing, now lets discuss Ivy. She has the serious look of someone who should star in this type of movie. A real odd look that is beautiful and yet ... well, odd. But the sound direction is totally off. The dubbing used here for her &quot;drop-outs&quot; is so noticable. Just about every line she has has been obviously overdubbed, and poorly, it comes off as a strange &quot;whine&quot;. Still, even with this Ivy/Audry has a sort of timeless quality about it. <BR>  <BR>Everything about the movie technically is good. The soundtrack has some spooky elements in it but never really approaches greatness. The dvd has a trailer (whoopie!) but nothing else which is a downer for anyone who owns Carrie. Still, it's the story I've always been drawn too when I think of Audrey Rose and the sort of ambiguous ending which I personally like, I think it's held up pretty well. If we could give 1/2 stars bump this to 3.5. Give me some interviews and a remastered soundtrack and this could be a 4 easily.
B00003CY6M|4.0|I don't remember exactly why I went to see this movie, but I'm glad I did. John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale do a tremendous job portraying people who meet one night but then part ways (half-intentionally) to see if fate will bring then back together years later. Sure it sounds like a boring, played-out plot on paper, but it all depends on the details and actions that define the movie, and overall everything works well. It's also interesting to see Molly Shannon not playing an \\"idiot\\". In fact, her character was one of the few people that had common sense. Anyway, this movie is great. Check it out.
B00005JKHN|5.0|This is, by far, my favorite cartoon ever.  It was the one I watched most as a kid and the one that I still think the most about today.  I know the DVD isn't released yet, but I have no doubt that high definition and widescreen will be enough to make it a superior buy.<br />What is perhaps the best about this movie is that Tchaikovsky's score is used instead of some odd Disney musician.  Don't get me wrong, Disney has turned out some wonderful songs over the years, but when the entire score comes from one ballet, there is a flow to the entire movie that other Disney films don't have.  The music seems to all be drawn from a common theme, not several seperate songs thrown together like it is today.<br />Furthermore, Disney's recent political correctness isn't present at all; Phillip & Aurora's fathers get drunk together, something that would never but put on screen today.<br />The characters are also very well drawn.  Even if it was all hand drawn and there are no computer special effects, I think that Aurora and Phillip are probably the best looking couple Disney has ever turned out.  The backgrounds are also lushly rendered in watercolors, not the computerized exaggerations so prevalent in \\"Hercules\\" and later films.<br />The horror and comic relief are great as well, strong and engaging enough even for the most mature audiences to still be enthralled.  Maleficent and the three fairies play at odds very well and I think that the charcters share some very deep screen chemistry, even for an animated movie.<br />That's what I like the most.  The film wasn't made for children; it is truly an animated \\"feature film\\" for audiences of all kinds and, though I like most of Disney's movies, none really can compare to \\"Sleeping Beauty.\\"
0316666343|2.0|I have just completed this book and it was a major disappointment. I am still trying to understand all the hype for this novel.<br />The beginning of the book holds a lot of promise but any interest in the characters dies about a third of the way through. I  had to force myself to finish the last 30 pages.<br />Don't waste your money on this piece of fluff.
0345350499|5.0|Holy cow! I was expecting a chick flick romance lust-in-the-dust novella when I bought this book at the recommendation of a friend. But it was wholly not what I expected.<br />First, the plot moves very slowly so as to keep one reading for a long, long time (I saw the movie first and thought the book would move as fast as the film). But it is very engaging and, as a guy, I found it an interesting illustration of a woman's point of view.<br />Furthermore, it is a decadent reteling of a story that has been used and abused over the years with Mort D'Artur, the musical \\"Camelot\\", the movie \\"First Knight\\", and \\"Monty Python's Quest for the Holy Grail\\". For such a common and often ill-respected story, Bradley truly performed a miracle and breathed new life into the plot.<br />It is a unique book and I don't think I'll ever read anything that comes close to the tangebility it posseses in it's storyline. The characters are all people we know very well and the book is an excellent parable about living with people who have other beliefs than you do. The philosophies presented are priceless and should be well learned, especially in the wake of rising fanatacism in the Middle East. Bradley has managed to write a timeless book that will deal with current issues facing man for years to come.<br />The book is not for everyone, though. Even though it is not strictly \\"fantasy\\", it still has its limitations with the audiences it can reach. If you're not interested in Arthur or British history, I suggest you check out the book before you buy it. Also, if you're used to faster readss (like I am with Michael Crichton, Tom Clancy, & John Grisham), be prepared for a long read. I usually finish a Crichton paperback in 3 days. This book took me over a week.  Also, be forewarned: this book has its \\"lip crushing kisses\\" and is at heart an epic romance as much as it is a fantasy and adventure. But's it's not nearly so graphic as romance novels are and the focus stays on religion, power struggles, and emotional love, not physical relationships.<br />In the end, it is a first rate book with unforgettable characters (and there are many) as well as lush descriptions of clothing, buildings, and places. Even though the genre isn't known for having many classics, I'd say that \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" deserves a place alongside \\"Moby Dick\\", \\"A Farewell to Arms\\", \\"The Scarlet Letter\\", etc. and should probably be on college reading lists.emotional love, not physical relationships.<BR>In the end, it is a first rate book with unforgettable characters (and there are many) as well as lush descriptions of clothing, buildings, and places.

B00005MP58|5.0|This is the first time I saw the movie.  It immediately hooked me on and I kept on watching again and again for the whole week.  Then I read the book.  My 6 year old son loves the &quot;argument&quot; scene between Lizzy and Lady de Bourgh.  I have to admit the picture in the VHS version is  more beautiful than on the DVD version.
B00005Y228|5.0|Kylie Minogue's &quot;Fever&quot; is a pretty good album.  I never heard it before I bought it, but am very pleased with it.  Since I received it, I have listened to it every night, and unlike most albums, I am not sick of it, and I'm nowhere near that point.
B000069AUI|5.0|I can't say that I was a Coldplay fan after their previous album releases even though I did, like the majority of the public, enjoy the ever popular \\"Yellow\\".  But this time I decided to give them a try and I can now declare that I'm completely in love with them!  Every song is loaded with emotions and heart.  Each song is worth taking the time to listen to simply because of: the quality lyrics that really say something and are not there just to fill in gaps, Martin's hauntingly feeling vocals lingering near the ears (can send goosebumps all over your body), and most importantly the wonderful collaboration of the guitars laying the foundation to Coldplay's trademark melancholic tune and atmosphere.  I found myself teary-eyed just listening to the guitars and piano play and almost cried when Martin's powerful voice took over.  Despite the sadness that emanates from their music, one can only feel a sense of indulgence and satisfaction after listening to them.<BR>This is the first review I've ever written although I've been a regular at Amazon for a while and have always read what others had to say...but this time, Coldplay's \\"Rush of Blood to the Head\\" has truly impressed me and I can't keep these my thoughts to myself anymore.  <BR>I can't decide which songs are better than which because I personally find each to bear their own share of value.  But I can say that I do have a few favorites from this almost perfect album - \\"Politik\\", \\"In My Place\\", \\"The Scientist\\", \\"Green Eyes\\", \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" and \\"Amsterdam\\".  I'm not an expert reviewer so I'll leave the detailed song analyses to others who are!  <BR>Last words: this album is definitely worth its price or even more so there should be no hesitating in getting this now.  Prepare yourself for a pleasure the ears, mind and heart will never forget.
B00005OWEG|3.0|What's all this ranting & posturing about which is the better version? Is Godfather is a better flick than Apocalypse Now? Is Apocalypse Now 1 better or worse than Apocalypse Now 2? Boys like to pretend they're tough, so we've always loved to play Cops & Robbers or Cowboys & Indians. The Apocalypse Now & Godfather films are fabulously entertaining & well-made,  but they're not really about warfare and they're not really about mobsters. They're about the fantasies guys hold dearly & desperately onto as our gender becomes extinct as the dinosaur.<br /><br />Apocalypse Now has a flaw that removes it from contention as a great film about war: the pseudo-analytical narration. Although written by the finest chronicler of Vietnam war events, Michael Herr, it's a weak device, one that works sometimes in coming-of-age novels, never in films. Maybe there's an opportunity for a 3rd version: Apocalypse Sans Voice-over.
B000069CWE|5.0|Many people say 'oh my god, thats lame its just remixed!?!' well, obviously they haven heard the album. Reanimation is awesome right to the core, as i said its not remixed in the traditional sense, this songs on this album almost sound new!<br />If you like Linkin Park then you will love this album, almost guarenteed. And cuz pp think its just a remix, they sell it for less! Great Buy, and i wonder why other artists didnt think of this first?!
0783219598|1.0|I rented this movie several years ago, played it on a VHS and regular TV and thought it was excellent. The story, cinematography, special effects, and setting are superb (and I'm 58 years old, not a kid). Recently I upgraded my audio/visual home theater set up to the tune of ($)which included a new Sony 34\\" widescreen HDTV (incredible). Building a DVD library, Babe was one of a number of DVD's I wanted to include. <br />Come to find out it has only been released on DVD in Full Screen (Standard) - 1.33:1 format, not widescreen. What a disappointment. Come on Universal Studios. Whoever made that decision, IMHO, is a dolt. Fire that guy and issue Babe in widescreen anamorphic. A beautiful film squeezed into Standard format, what a shame.<br />Some older films (DVD's), like Casablanca and Dr. Strangelove, I watch often on the widescreen TV, even though they are the standard aspect ratio. But these were originally produced in that aspect ratio, Babe was not.<br />In widescreen anamorphic Babe is without a doubt 5 stars. In DVD Standard it's not worth watching on a widescreen HDTV because what nags at the back of my mind is how beautiful it could really be.
0375707972|5.0|Schlink wonderfully introduces the reader to real characters.  While reading this book (parts during my street-car commute) I felt as if the characters could be my streetcar driver.  My neighbor. Schlink uses a seemingly unsual story to make us realize what we as humans ar capable of doing and how we as human often make mistakes when appraising others.  Despite these horrid capabilities and sad mistakes we befriend each other, love each other, and need each other.  The dilemma comes when we are forced (or feel forced) to justify one end of this spectrum with the other.<br />I was surprised by some of the negative reviews of this book. <br />For those who called it flat: I read &quot;The Reader&quot; in the original language (German: Der Vorleser) and must say that it was quite well written.  <br />When reviewing this book, several people noted their distaste for the relationship between a teen boy and an older woman.  My retort to this is simple: it happens.  The appropriateness of the relationship is not addressed directly by the author; Schlink does, however, acknowledge that this relationship at a formative point in the boy's live clearly affects his future relationships.
B000069AUI|5.0|Wow! Where to start.If you've liked or thought older Coldplay songs such as \\"Yellow\\" or \\"Trouble\\" were good and you think that \\"In My Place\\" is really good just wait until you hear the whole new album. From the first song \\"Politik\\" you know you are in for something special. And then fourth song , \\"The Scientist,\\"  First time I played it I cried. It's one of those rare, rare magical songs such as Pink Floyd's \\"Wish You Were\\" Here, \\"Under the Milky Way\\" by the Church or \\"Ocean Rain\\" by Echo and the Bunnymen. \\"The Scientist\\" will win a Grammy, mark my words. I'm so glad these guys are here. I belive they'll conquer the world as U2 did in 80's, because they deserve it.<br />Buy this CD for yourself and anyone you care about. (I bought 5 copies one for me and others for friends and family) AMAZING.
0440219078|4.0|...With an awesome plot but it was one of those books that leaves you sort of hollow and with a new look of what the world may become. You know your so engrossed in thinking it over in your head you walk into walks and can't talk for about an hour. A world without color, love and choices, is a scary thought. It took me only a day to read this mostly because it was too good to put down but also because I'm a very fast reader. Even if it is a very good book and thought provoking, I don't think younger kids should read it. It may not make a lot of sense to them and that ruins a story when you have to come back and read it later after a failed attempt. By now your probably wondering why I gave it only four stars. The reason is no matter how many times I read the ending I still wonder: What the hell happened?
B000002ADT|5.0|I have heard jazz played in many countries by many very talanted people.  But no one can play it and sing it better than Americans.  It is an American form of art and only American artists can feel the depth of it.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This CD is probably one of my favorites of all the CD's this year. It's cool and mellow. Perfect for relaxing to. Norah Jones has an amazingly beautiful voice. It is haunting, and sublime. it will be stuck in your head all day.
B00006AFUR|4.0|Just got this a few days ago after hearing the Capricorn single and have to say I am more than happy with the results of the rest of the album. The sound of this band is fresh and interesting and provides a nice counterpoint to all the lackluster Neo-garage rock that has surfaced lately. At least this band is concerned with(and it is an important concern)creating, new and interesting music that will continue to evolve the art form. This is a nice hybrid of heavy rock, electronic atmospherics and emotive song writing. A damn good start, this band certainly shows promise. Who knew Jared Leto was so damn talented?? I took a chance buying this, because so often these days you buy an album based on the strength of a single and you wind up getting burned, but thankfully this album is satisfying and worth a spin. Check it out, also would recommend the new Queen of the Stone Age Cd too, it rocks!!
B00005RYKV|3.0|It is kind of Takeshi movie. Violence, funny and try to be an art. I just don't feel anything after seen it. It happened all the time after his movie. It is hard to understand what he wants to do. He has such a reputation as a director, but I still can not get it. It's OK to watch. Not that bad. During the movie, I was not fallen asleep. I just want to say there are better Yakuza movies exist in Japan. Much better and much more. He doesn't have to make Yakuza movie. And also he hasn't reached the time to ripe yet about his talent as a director. One day, I hope he can make very best of his movie.
B00006879E|5.0|This cd is amazing. There is not a single bad song on here. Maroon 5 combines funk, R&amp;B, soul, and rock flawlessly. These  guys are going to be huge! Everywhere the band plays, they gain the entire audience as devout fans, and everyone who listens to this cd loves it. Look at the reviews! Maroon 5 are special; they have created an original sound, one that will sweep the charts fairly soon. If you need a comparison, they sound like a mix between Stevie Wonder, Jamiroquai, Ben Fold Five, and the Rolling Stones. By the way, they are unbelievable live.
B000069AUI|3.0|Coldplay is back with their new album, and it's everything everyone expected. A roller-coaster of rock, ballads, piano music, however, I found their second album is relatively lacking in the intuitiveness that the first album had.<br />Upon listening to the first three tracks of this album, it left me asking \\"Okay.. do you know any other chords?\\"<br />This is not to say that this is a good album, I gave it an average rating because that's, well, what it is: average.<br />However, if you were a fan of the first album, and want to hear more, this is a good buy in the hopes that they'll return to what made their songs on Parachutes great.
0671027344|5.0|There's something a little weird about Charlie. In The Perks of Being a Wallflower this 15-year-old high school freshman writes a series of letters to a stranger.  Charlie's first letter sets up several questions.  Why did Charlie make his teachers nervous last year after his friend Michael's suicide?  What problems does Charlie have at home?  What bad thing happened to his Aunt Helen?  Charlie concludes  \\"Some people really do have it a lot worse than I do.  They really do.\\"<br />Written over the 1991-1992 school year the remaining letters are instructive reading for anyone who has forgotten the hellish nature of adolescence. But The Perks of Being a Wallflower is misplaced as a young adult novel.  Although the protagonist is young, the themes of this book are adult, treated without any assumption of a happy ending or any other formulaic convention<br />Wallflower is a strikingly original novel.  Although the rhythm of Charlie's speech is reminiscent of Holden Caulfield (Catcher in the Rye), he seems to have more purity and a different kind of wisdom than Holden.  Some similarities could also be drawn between Wallflower and some of the works of Robert Cormier (in particular, I Am the Cheese).  But Charlie is a child of the 1990's, and although odd, he is sophisticated.  His observations about the struggles of the people are sharp and relevant to anyone interested in human nature.
0441172717|5.0|You may want to wait to read this book towards the end of your life because there is no better. Oh yeah, and there probably never will be. It's that good.<br />The complex and intricate world created by Frank Herbert will blow your mind with its creativity and uniqueness. I can only think of one other book that exceeds it for the detailed creation of another world's political and social structure, and that is the fantasy novel Maia by Richard Adams (Watership Down). <br />While the entire series is interesting, Dune is by far the best. A rich, compelling and thrilling story of House Atreides and its struggles with House Harkonnen for control of the desert planet Arrakis. Please ignore the two utterly disastrous attempts to bring this story to the screen and read this book. You will be amazed!
B000069AUI|4.0|the new coldplay is pretty bloody brilliant. it's pretty much what i expected to hear from them, and i'm not disappointed at all. it would have been better if they experimented more with their sound though, but it seems like the same formula worked for them well this time around. i love the first track, \\"politik\\" and it's message...and then there's the sweeping \\"in my place\\" (current single). \\"god put a smile upon your face\\" is one of the most optimistic songs i've heard from these guys. it sure makes me smile (haha). <br />the ballads are still my favourite though. \\"yellow\\" (their break-out hit) was so amazing, and they reach similar heights with songs like \\"the scientist\\" (\\"come up to meet you, tell you i'm sorry/you don't know how lovely you are...nobody said it was easy/oh it's such a shame for us to part\\") and \\"warning sign\\" (\\"and the truth is/i miss you so/and i'm tired/i should not have let you go...so i crawl back to your open arms\\").<br />the lyrics to the title track, \\"a rush of blood to the head\\" are so very powerful...and obviously inspired by september 11th. \\"he said i'm going to buy this place and burn it down/i'm going to put it six feet underground...he said oh i'm going to buy a gun and start a war/if you can tell me something worth fighting for\\"...<br />\\"clocks\\" sounds like something u2 would come up with, just the instrumentation i guess. and \\"a whisper\\" moves into the doves' region...one thing's for sure - these tracks are gonna sound superb live!
6301208773|5.0|ALthough there have been countless films to enter the action genre, Die Hard continues to be one of the ten best ever released. Few people can think of the name Bruce Willis without recalling this gritty tough-cop shoot'em up that helped to establish him as one of actions finest stars! From opening to end, it is one hell of an adrenaline rush! Sit back, cause action is going sky-high!
0441008356|2.0|This is another sci-fi book that I bought because the Amazon reviews were excellent.<br />Unfortunately, I am 200 pages into it after 2-3 months of working on it. It just doesn't beg me to pick it up the way some books do. It's sitting on the edge of my desk right now piled under 2-weeks of bills and junkmail. It's only on my desk because my wife brought it in from the kitchen when she was picking up.<br />I feel obligated to finish it and figure out what's going on, but it's almost like chinese water torture. There's so much stuff in it that doesn't contribute to the story and, after 200 pages, I don't feel like it's progressing towards a conclusion.<br />The biggest problem I have with books like these is the excessive technobabble and jumping back and forth between timelines, ships, locations, and even characters. So at this point, I don't even know who the main character is, or if there is a main character.
0312265859|4.0|Poor Stephanie Plum! She is always losing her handcuffs and needing to be rescued by some  knight in shining armor. Plum is probably the most inept bounty hunter in history. Her collars are always outwitting her or worse, stealing her car. <br />So why is this series always on the Best Seller's list? Because they are funny. Nothing is taken too seriously. Plum is teamed up in Hard Eight with Albert Kloughn (pronounced clown), Attorney at Law, Laundromat manager and bounty hunter wannabe. Looking for a mom on the run with a kid provides the backdrop for a hilarious tale of  the woman vs. the bad guys. Even though the outcome is never in doubt, Janet Evanovich's wry and wacky romp through a Jersey underworld where even Tony Soprano's dumbest associates would look like rocket scientists is a true joy to read.
B00006GFAB|5.0|You wanted the best and you got the best, THE VERY BEST OF KISS.<BR>The CD is the among the best and exactly what you would expect from KISS. The songs are excellent. All that can be said is, it is the Best!
B000068IEU|5.0|Wow.  That  is  all  I  can  say  after  watching  Wes  Craven's  first  and  best  film.  Very  disturbing  and  powerful,  Last  House  on  the  Left  gets  it's  message  across  and  doesn't  pull  any  punches  in  doing  so.  The  most  powerful  scene  in  this  movie,  and  perhaps  any  movie,  is  after  the  murderous  four  kills  one  of  the  hostages  and  watches  the  other  one  walk  into  a  pond  in  shock.  They  shoot  her  and  both  hostages  are  dead.  What  is  so  powerful  about  this  scene  is  that  if  you  look  in  the  killer's  faces  you  don't  see  pride  and  hapiness  that  they  just  killed  the  hostages,  but  instead  you  can  sense  that  they  know  what  they  are  doing  is  wrong  and  that  they  are  human,  but  they  just  can't  take  back  what  they  did  now.<BR>   What  is  so  great  about  LHOTL  is  that  it  doesn't  treat  violence  as  a  thing  of  entertainment  on  movies,  but  instead  it  treats  it  like  voilence  is  in  real  life.  It  is  raw  in-your-face  documentery  style  that  you  can't  turn  away  from.  It  also  shows  that  real  villians  are  more  human  than  movies  make  them  out  to  be.  And  it  has  another  message,  that  the  parents  of  the  dispatched  daughter  seek  vengence  of  the  killers,  and  after  they  knock  off  the  killers  that  stay  at  there  house,  they  find  that  their  revenge  is  still  no  better  than  killing  in  the  first  place.<BR>   The  DVD  is  also  great.  It  is  uncut,  only  the  DVD  so  don't  get  the  heavily  censored  VHS  version  or  you  will  end  up  kicking  yourself(  I  know  that  first  hand  ).  The   DVD  also  has  funny  and  entertaining  commentary  by  Wes  Craven  and  Sean  S.  Cunningham.  It  has  a  making  of  LHOTL  that  is  a  must  for  fans(  man,  Fred  Lincoln  has  gained  some  weight!  ).  It  has  some  outtakes,  but  they  have  no  sound  so  it  is  kind  of  lame.  A  good  introduction  before  the  movie  by  director  Wes  Craven,  Theatrical  trailer,  and  Forbidden  footage  which  is  good.<BR>   This  DVD  is  a  great  buy,  especially  reccommended  for  horror  fans.<br />4  out  of  4  stars.

B00006EXCC|5.0|This is the UK version of Aftermath that American audiences should have heard back in 1966 but didn't. The American version only had 11 tracks. For those of you who buy this version, &quot;Paint It, Black&quot; is not included here. It is replaced by &quot;Mothers Little Helper&quot;. There are three other tracks not included on the original American album. They are &quot;Out Of Time&quot;, &quot;Take It Or Leave It&quot; and &quot;What To Do&quot;. I bought the old Abkco CD back in 1994 and I thought that the sound wasn't too great. The sound on this CD is much better with less hiss, higher recording levels, and greater stereo separation. The only exception is &quot;I Am Waiting&quot;. This track sounds the same as on my old CD. That's a shame because &quot;I Am Waiting&quot; is one of the best obscure Rolling Stones songs there is and I was expecting that the stereo separation would be brought out and the hiss would be reduced but it wasn't. My guess is that the master wasn't located. I'll dock a half of a star for failing to improve &quot;I Am Waiting&quot;. Aftermath is still a great album. This really was the first time that the Stones went into the studio with an LP in mind rather than a bunch of singles (which all were great!) and tossed-off tracks.
B00006690G|5.0|I was knocked off my feet when i got this cd.  It is the best.  Tupac used to be my favorite artist but eminem has surpassed him.  This cd is unbeliveable. Every song is awesome!  I truely recommened it.  (I also recommened seeing him in concert!!!)
0060989157|5.0|WARNING! Picking up this book is like watching a train wreak. A tragedy you can't advert your eyes from. And since these ... are actually interesting you won't feel that you wasted your time. In fact I'm convinced that one day Mick Mars will ascend into the sky, illuminated by \\"little-baby-jesus-rays\\" and become a patron Saint to everyone who has had to endure the torment of co-workers from Hell! Bless Him and let him find the peace he so richly deserves. Amen!
B00006AW2J|5.0|Released in 1968, this is the Stones at their bluesy best--I call it their great comeback album because it is the first true Stones album since 1965.  By this I mean they got back to their R&B roots (with a dash of C&W thrown in due to KR's association with Gram Parsons) and do what they do best. Unfortunately, Brian's contributions were few, the songs he did contribute to are all the better for it! Here are several classics (that make this album) Sympathy for the Devil, Stray Cat Blues, Dear Doctor and No Expectations (listen to Brian's fantastic but sad slide guitar)--guess you could say this summed up Brian's status at the time. A great album for any fan--new or old!
B00005YW4H|5.0|&quot;Come Away With Me&quot; is a great change of pace considering the pulse of new music. The album has sections which are so understated that they fade into a whisper, unlike the recordings of screaming divas like Christina Aguilera and Celine Dion. The album is not traditional jazz, but Jones and her band manage to seamlessly blend styles together that might become messy and meshooga'ot when attempted by other artists. The Hank Williams cover is flawless, but jazz standards &quot;Turn Me On&quot; and Hoagy Carmichael's &quot;The Nearness of You&quot; should not be overlooked. Overall, a great lounge album.
B00006AW2L|4.0|This is the first Stones' album with all Jagger &amp; Richards compositions. Certainly not one of their best but a must have for true Stones fans. To really appreciate this album one must put themselves back in the time period it was devised.  Some truly revolutionary tunes here and classic Stones to be sure--Under My Thumb, the oftern neglected but great blues tune, Flight 505 (Watts and Wyman truly cook on this one) and some other fine gems round it out.  If for no other reason than to hear Brina Jones in his musical prime get this album! Brian makes these songs come alive with his vast and inovative musical abilities - he plays no less than 5 different instruments! My recommendation: if you are a true Stones fan--buy it (but then you most likely already have); if you only enjoy the groups newer stuff (1975 to present) or the &quot;AM&quot; Stones, pass it up.
B000002KBU|5.0|Funny as it is, I first got to listen to this CD after C.Crowe's film &quot;Almost Famous&quot;, that plays Joni's &quot;River&quot; in one of the scenes. Only yesterday I bought a copy of this album that was released when I was 11 (as the guy in that movie!).<br />It is a minimalist, timeless classic of songs that open up and mean so much to so many. In the age of overindulged, overproduced music Joni's Blue stands as an example of emotion evoking song writing and music. Lyrically brilliant collection of songs that you can listen all over again. These 60-70s singer songwriters really have a renaissance in sight.
B000069I1H|4.0|I was forced to watch this movie, I didn't want to, because I hate self-aware Hollywood &quot;insider&quot; movies, AND I hate Rene Russo.  This was a really funny movie, it was just original enough to keep me going and that was only possible through the very natural, and professional performances of DeNiro and Murphy.  Rene Russo, on the other hand, has the distinction of being the only female actor I can think of who chews the scenery in every movie she is in.  Rene Russo is a talentless twit.  This movie was very funny anyway.
B000069HKH|5.0|Since its release I have listened to &quot;The Rising&quot; everyday. First I was embarrassed by the the sound. Overproduced? After further listening I realised that this is the sound of &quot;E Street&quot; in the 00's. Songs are immaculate. Lyrics are strong, if sometimes repetitive. In all you get 15 classics to be. The ones that made me cry are Paradise, Nothing Man, Empty sky and You're Missing. The ones that sound happy but are not really that: Mary's place or Waiting on a sunny day. Thought provoking, lyrically and musically inventive. Own it. You won't regret it. Fans complain about poppy &quot;Let's Be friends&quot;. Do not. It is a happy song for people who have lost and will to carry on. CD filled with therapy, good lyrics and  music. What else can you ask for nowadays?
6301208773|5.0|Die Hard is an amazing action movie, an edge of your seat adrenaline filled thriller that made Bruce Willis an action star and John McTiernan the most popular director at that time.  From the moment a black truck is seen rolling into the Nakatomi building, you know you're in for two hours of pure bloody violence, including gunfights and hand fights.  This is perhaps Bruce Willis's trademark movie, one that he shall be remembered for long after he's gone.  The first time I watched the movie, I didn't move.  Not even for a glass of water or a snack.  I just sat there staring at the TV in disbelief, disbelief because I had just witnessed a fight that no movie today could match up to.  While today's movie are targeted more the popcorn teenage type of guys, this is an adult thriller, showing off that sometimes in the world of corny action, some true genius does break through.<br />Bruce Willis is John McClane, a New York cop who's visiting his wife in California. She works in the \\"Nakatomi\\" building, a gigantic skyscraper ruled by Mr. Takagi, a businessman. However, terrorists soon take over the building to steal the 640 million dollaes hidden inside a vault and kill the boss. They capture McClane's wife and round up hostages, killing anyone who gets in their way. Police are afraid to enter the building because the hostages may get killed and the terrorists are clever and know all of the cop's plans.. But it's not the end. For the terrorists did not capture one man. John McClane.  He's one of the least likely to be in his position.  But now he's the only one who can defeat the terrorists and save the day.<br />Yes, I must admit that Die Hard, like other action movies, is  predictable and is a basic one man against a dozen thriller. The good part about it though is that is has plenty of gunplay to hold your breath depsite the ending. The directing is amazing, the acting is great (especially Alan Rickman, who plays the leader of the gang, Hans Gruber) A spectacular motionpicture. Well worth buying though you should get the DVD cause it has a lot of special features.
B00005YW4H|2.0|Ms. Jones has a great distinctive voice. But everything else was a big disappointment. Hardly what I expected and heard before the CD came out.  Her music is not jazz.  I would never compare her in the same category as Diana Krall and Jane Monheit. Not even close!
6304602901|4.0|Steve Guttenberg stars in this 1984 comedy directed by Hugh Wilson and featuring Kim Catrall (TV's Sex and the City, Crossroads).  Guttenberg plays a man, not caring about life and doing nothing.  After he almost destroys a car he gets a choice: Go to jail or go to the police academy.  If he quits, he goes to jail.  However, if someone throws him out he will go back to his normal life.  And as much pranks Guttenberg pulls, he still cant get himself out.  Then he realizes that maybe being a police officer isn't the worst job in the world.  This was the movie that started it and that would go on to have five sequels.  Perhaps the first one of the series is the best one though it's the only one rated R.  It's a very entertaining movie with a lot of laughs.  My favorite characters were definetely Mahoney (Guttenberg), Hightower(Bubba Smith), and Barbara (don't know his name) who sadly didn't appear in the sequel, Police Academy 2:  Their First Assignment.
B000001Y42|1.0|This CD has always stunk. I bought this CD way before they hit big, and even hated it then. All my friends were like &quot;How can you hate it&quot; and now I'm the one saying &quot;How can you like it.&quot; Everyone's embarassed. At the end of Pollution, Fred yells over and over again &quot;FRED, SHUT THE F--- UP!&quot; I couldn't put it any better. Don't be fooled. This is not LB's only good CD -- they don't have a good CD.
6303257844|3.0|Speed, directed by Jan De Bont and starring Keanu Reeves, is indeed entertaining though I wouldn't put it in the category of action.  I believe that an \\"action movie\\" must have:<br />1.  A lot of gunplay<BR>2.  Some explosions<BR>3.  Fist fights<br />Speed does have some explosions though hardly any gunplay or fist fights.  It's more of a thriller than an action film.  Keanu Reeves plays Jack Travin, a cop.  He is always fighting his arch-nemesis Howard Payne (played by Dennis Hopper).  In the first fifteen minutes of the movie Travin and his partner Harry (Jeff Daniels, My Favorite Martian) stop an elevator from crashing and save everyone onboard.  Payne, who had devised this plan, is mad so he wants to get back at Travin.  So he plants a bomb on a bus, stating that if the bus goes under 50 miles an hour it'll explode and kill everyone onboard.   Travin gets onto the bus and tries thinking of ways to stop the bomb but unfortunately some passengers get into a fight and the driver is killed.  A passenger (Sandra Bullock, Demolition Man) takes over and now they must keep the bus at 50 m.p.h or else it'll be the last day of their lives.  This movie is very entertaining though a bit predictable and for more suspense, I recomnend the second one, Speed 2: Cruise Control.  I enjoyed this movie though I though it was a bit too long.  3 stars.
B00006AUIG|5.0|This movie ranks among my top five favorite suspense/thriller movies of all time (along with The Shining, Jacob's Ladder, Sixth Sense, and ... I can't remember the fifth but you get the idea).  If you enjoy psychological thrillers, the ones that really get inside your head, this movie is for you.  It seems to be a relatively low-budget film, given that I never saw it promoted at all, but that just makes it even more amazing that it's so well-acted and directed.  It draws you in and gradually builds the horror until you're on the edge of your seat.  I couldn't sleep for a week thinking I was going to hear that voice talking to me.  Highly recommended for thriller buffs who are more keen on psychological terror than on gore.
B00003CXAT|4.0|In 1993, the year that Steven Spielberg received the Best Director Oscar for Schindler's List, Steven Speilberg made another classic that would goon to have two more sequels: Jurassic Park.  Jurrasic Park is a great thriller about several scientists who find D.N.A and use it to create dinosaurs.  They invite several doctors, physicians, etc. to test them out but when the dinosaurs break out, the humans will become their prey.  And as one by one the people are swallowed and torn to pieces, the remaining must find a way to get out...before they get eaten.  Jurassic Park has amazing special effects and an all star cast including Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, and Samuel L. Jackson.  It's not very bloody and basically anyone over the age of 10 can watch it.  It's defintetely a classic and is much better than its two sequels.  I recommend it highly.
B000002UJQ|3.0|it's a good cd..i picked up on radiohead after their release of ok computer, and it started with an older song of theirs. i like their live stuff better..(eg no alarms the older version). it is not recommended to people that listen to music for..i suppose entertainment would be a good word. if you're fighting depression you might find some familliar things in there..i really didn't think it was shallow..<BR>it's good and not really supposed to fit everybody's tase. and also i really must be an ignorant because i didn't even hear of a hype about this cd.
6302765536|3.0|After Home Alone's success, writer John Hughes (Uncle Buck) and director Chris Columbus (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone) joined together once again to make the average sequel Home Alone 2: Lost In New York, which lived up to expectations though didn't match the wit and fun of the original. Though rumors stated that Macaulay Culkin, the \\"child\\" star of the first two Home Alones was getting too old to reprise his role, I believe Home Alone 3 changed characters because the audience was getting tired of the same old routine of seeing Culkin outsmart and defeat a group of idiots. I believe the audience wanted something new, which is also why I think they replaced the Wet Bandits with the other four villains as well as Chris Columbus as director. Though armed with a better script, Home Alone 2: Lost in New York does not succeed in being as perfect as the original because you'll keep asking yourself the same question throughout the movie: Haven't we seen this before? <br />In the sequel, Macaulay Culkin reprises his role as Kevin McAllister, the young boy who beat up two criminals and sent them to jail two years ago. The McCallisters are planning another trip and oh-this-is-unexpected, Kevin once again gets separated from his family. After misleadingly following a man that looked like his father onboard a plane, Kevin finds himself in New York City with his father's cash and credit cards. At the same time, the Wet Bandits who ae the two criminals Kevin put to jail two years ago (Joe Pesci, Goodfellas, and Daniel Stern, Bushwhacked) escape from jail. Kevin once again meets up with them (oh, what a coincidence) and once again it's up to him to stop them before they commit a gigantic toy store robbery. Armed with dozens of booby traps and weapons, Kevin forms a war zone in his uncle's big mansion and wages World War III against the robbers. Let's see, can you figure out who will win this time?<br />Once again, the movie is way too predictable and many of my Home Alonethoughs are similar of those of Home Alone 2's (Check the bottom portion of my Home Alone review) Though surrounded with an okay cast, Home Alone 2 once again succeeds in entertaining and being a completely thoughtless and childless film.<br />Movie: Home Alone 2: Lost in New York<BR>Actors/Actresses - Macaulay Culkin, Daniel Stern, Joe Pesci, Catherine O'Hara, John Hears, Tim Curry, Rob Schneider<BR>Director: Chris Columbus<BR>Time: 120 minutes<BR>Rated PG for childish violence and mild language
B00004XONN|3.0|good cd, a natural progression for radiohead. takes some time to get used to, especially the national anthem.take it for what it's worth..
6305537321|3.0|Breakfast at Tiffany's is a movie that seems untouchable in its high-gloss, 60s stylishness. But apart from the charismatic Audrey Hepburn who is mysterious and elegant as Holly Golightly, and the Henry Mancini soundtrack, facts have to be faced. Breakfast at Tiffany's is not a great film. George Peppard, for all his blue-eyed good looks, has the screen presence of a deep freezer and Mickery Rooney's cameo as the irate Japanese upstairs neighbour is terrible. I would say Breakfast at Tiffany's is a good movie for Audrey Hepburn fans and students of 60s style but unsatisfying for the rest of us.
B000002LRX|4.0|For years I sort of had this band written off as a catchy but ultimately kind of dumb funk metal band, as based off hearing lots of \\"epic\\" and \\"we care a lot\\" and very little else. But after hearing a bit of Mike Patton's stranger projects Fantomas and Mr Bungle, I realized there must be more there. A bit of research downloading mp3's and looking at reviews led me to this here album, and I'm glad it did. I've read this was a bit of a commercial failure upon release, but while there are a few things that probably alienated people who jumped in after \\"epic\\" from the last record (the piano based white trash character sketch \\"RV\\", the weird metal of \\"jizzlobber\\", etc), most of it's the catchy funk metal I was expecting but more intelligently written and with interesting twists, and I have no idea why it doesn't have a big hit single. \\"A Small Victory\\" has a memorable melody, with an interesting mix of oriental sounding keyboards and record scratches, and \\"Be Aggressive\\" is infectious and driving enough that I could picture it being played in football stadiums across the US, if not for the fact that it's an ode to, er, oral gratification. The cheerleaders in the chorus are a genius touch too. While there's still a few numbers that haven't really made much of an impression yet, for the most part this album is a perfect mix of pop sensibilities and sonic adventurism, and it's definitely converted me.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Two or three tracks makes owning this CD a worthwhile investment.  Lady Marmalade was easily one of the decades most unforgettable cover songs, showcasing four women in perhaps one of the most blatantly sexual video in a very long time.  I never saw McGregor or Kidman as pop stars before this visionary musical, and here they surpass all expectations.  \\"Come what may\\" and 'One Day i'll Fly away\\" reduces me to tears.  Ewan on the other hand brings my spirits up with his whimsical if not versatile pipes.  I tend to skip songs that never made it in the original film version, with exception of David Bowie's first cover of \\"nature Boi.\\"  All in all, a must have item for any \\"Moulin ROuge\\" fan.
B00000K501|5.0|Wow! This concert is incredible. All 6 members - Till, Richard, Paul, Ollie, Christoph and Flake give outstanding performances. This concert captures the effort, organisation and professionalism Rammstein have created. From the music to the vocals to the pyrotechnics and to the lighting, its all outstanding and show what perfectionists Rammstein are. This is a great buy and if you're a Rammstein fan you will not be disappointed.
B000069AUI|4.0|This CD is absolutely brilliant. If you liked Parachutes, buy AROBTTH!! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I don't love 1 of the songs to the same magnitude as I did for EVERY single song on Parachutes. If there was a 4 1/2 option for stars I would have given it that. Buy it.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Moulin Rouge ranks with my most favorite films of all time. The more one sees this film, the more they appreciate the superb quality and the hard work in introducing such a film into the culture. It's a bit highbrow, but what's wrong with that. It helps to know a bit about the actual Moulin Rouge and the story of Toulse LeTrec. Ewan McGregor, Nicole Kidman, John Liguizano,Jim Broadbent & the other bring this Musical to life. Baz Luhrman, keep up the good work and Thank You.
B00003CXDU|5.0|It wasn't so much that I wasn't a fan of Star Trek. It was more of a complete dislike for William Shatner in the lead role. I always found him a smug, arrogant actor that seemed to be giving the minimum amount of effort in order to garner a paycheck. The fact that he more or less has alluded to such over the years proves the point. The show itself was extraordinarily innovative for it's time, and it's too bad such a big presence had to bring it down. <br />Galaxy Quest captures everything I like and hate about the show perfectly. It begins by mercilessly slamming the situation of the former cast of the show, years after it's run on TV. The cast is reduced to getting paychecks by enduring fans at conventions who live and breathe what the actors gave up doing years ago. When not doing conventions, they have to endure fans who live and breathe Galaxy Quest as electronics store openings.<br />The most hilarious character at this point is Alan Rickman, who seemed to have a budding theatrical career that was put on permanent hold when the show's popularity became his destiny. The bad guy of \\"Die Hard\\" proves to be a great comedic actor as someone who would rather die than utter another of his Dr. Spockish sayings.<br />While I don't believe William Shatner ever showed the exuberance for conventions that Tim Allen does at the beginning, it does setup a temporary downfall that propels the rest of the plot. Allen goes into a deep funk when overhearing in a washroom how pathetic the whole cast is. This funk is only overcome when real aliens beam him up and he sees a chance to save the universe. Or at least revive his career.<br />The genius of the movie is how, once the rest of the cast is also beamed up, that we actually care deeply for the characters and start rooting for the good guys. Excellent special effects, especially with the unstoppable Rock Monster, take them deeper and deeper into a situation where they have to make serious decisions, while at the same time keeping their comedic edge. <br />While the veterans all do great work, my favorite is Sam Rockwell, who plays one of the superfans who happened to be an extra in one of the past episodes. At first he elevates himself to the stardom of the others by asking if he can sit at the autograph table with the main characters and get the 8 x 10's he has made of himself also autographed. But when the action gets fast and furious, he realizes that his role is usually to get killed off before the end of the plot. This anxiety is hilarious throughout the movie.<br />Oh yes, it's also great for all ages.
B00000JMOF|4.0|The film is based on the first half of Mary Shelley's gothic novel Frankenstein where Dr. Frankenstein reanimates life.  The being that he creates becomes a product of its' environment while continuing to learn through trial and error.  Unfortunately, its' errors become magnified by its' physical attributions, which causes unrest among those it comes in contact with through simple attempts at communication.  Whale's horror creation was made over 70 years ago; however, one catch phrase, &quot;It's alive!&quot;, that terrified audiences in the 30s, still produces chills in audiences today.  Therefore, regardless of age, the film still provides a tremendous cinematic experience.

014028009X|4.0|      Heroine: Average<br />  Bridget Jones is a wryly humorous, voyeuristic look into the life of a young thirty-something who is set upon improving herself while trying to balance her world on a set of conflicting beliefs.  On the one hand she purports to be a staunchly independent \\"feminist\\", and yet she is utterly desperate for a man to call her own.  In point of fact, Bridget and her other unattached cronies are all convinced that they'll die alone and will be discovered weeks later half-eaten by an Alsatian.  This desperation tends to drive Bridget into relationships with some real sleazebag losers, which, while doing nothing helpful for her self-esteem, does wonders for her dieting.<br />  Add to all this the fact that Bridget has finally reached that difficult point in life where she has to be the adult in her family.  She has to handle her dad's pitiful middle-of-the-night phone calls while her mum, who left home in the throes of an end-of-life crisis, plays at living a wild carefree life as a television personality with a new youngish boyfriend, all the while trying to throw Bridget at her neighbor's rich, newly-divorced barrister son.<br />  What worked for me:<br />    I totally relate to Bridget's neuroses concerning food and calorie counting, as I imagine millions of other women in the world do.  I also understand her worries about fitting into the world and trying so hard to present herself as someone who \\"belongs\\" appearance and intelligence-wise.  Bridget's attempts at self-improvement in those areas were funny but also terribly bittersweet.<br />  Though it sometimes seemed a bit much, the terse telegraphic writing style lent itself very well to giving the feel of reading someone else's journal.  And it was certainly fun trying to decipher those cryptic entries made when Bridget'd had a few too many!<br />  Size-wise Bridget was at best on the plump side of average, but she felt as though she was much larger than that.  When she managed to shed the \\"extra\\" weight, all her friends couldn't help but ask her if she was ill and where her bosom had gone to.<br />What didn't work for me:    <br />  The characters were more like \\"caricatures\\" as they were so incredibly over-the-top in many respects, and at times I found their antics and attitudes wearing. (Well, you know how the psychobabble goes . . if you don't like someone, odds are it's because she reminds you of yourself.  I am fervently hoping that this isn't actually true!)<br />Overall:<br />  A fun, fast read for those who want to have a few laughs and feel better about their own lot in life.  After all, things could be worse.  You could be Bridget!<br />Warning: coarse language and sexual references abound, and if you abhor calorie obsessions, then skip over the headers to each entry in this book.<br />If you liked \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\" you might also enjoy \\"Jemima J.\\" and \\"Having It and Eating It\\".hen she managed to shed the \\"extra\\" weight, all her friends couldn't help but ask her if she was ill and where her bosom had gone to.<br />What didn't work for me:    <br />     The characters were more like \\"caricatures\\" as they were so incredibly over-the-top in many respects, and at times I found their antics and attitudes wearing.

B000062XM3|5.0|Fight Club is my favorite movie of all time. It's got everything. Intelligence (actual intelligence), romance, sadness, comedy, and suspense (in a way). Ed Norton and Brad Pitt have such a chemistry, it's amazing. Two incredible actors together in one of the most twisted, yet awesome story lines. This is one of those movies that you either love, or you hate. Many times throughout this movie you don't know what's going on. I guess this is just one of those movies that you have to be really open minded about. Which is one of this charms. Watch it, and watch all of it, or you'll be confused beyond all belief.
B00005OAIE|1.0|Judging from this guy's rising popularity, there's plenty of room for squares. Dave Matthews should take this guy to court for ripping him off to the point of even copying his knock-kneed stage moves. If you enjoy Matthews (safe, bland music with lame non-sensical lyrics), you'll love this. How such bloodless, passionless music that sounds if it were made by a eunuch could have such a large female following is very bizzare.

B00005JLF5|5.0|I have been enjoying Star Trek for a long time.  I even enjoy watching the re-runs of the Next Generation and the original Star Trek series, even thought I own copies.  I really miss Deep Space Nine though.  I didn't mind that it was darker than the preceding two series or even (then) the newly unveiled Voyager series.  I know that even in this supposed wonderful future, not everything was easy or simple.  The Next Generation only touched on certain darker elements.  Deep Space Nine really explored those stories. I felt that Deep Space Nine was more intricate and raw than the others and that the cast was perfect with their moments of heroics and their falls from grace.  It is sad that it is so difficult to find this series anywhere.  I even started purchasing the VHS series through Columbia House, but it became too expensive and took to long to get a two-episode tape.  I believe that this series is in every way comparable to another excellent series, Babylon 5.  I would really love to buy the box sets of Deep Space Nine. I wish they would treat DS9 with the same respect TNG gets.
0446608955|1.0|I just wanted to ask, is there such a thing as zero stars rating, because if there is, that's what I'll like to give this book.  Everybody kept telling me how wondeful and touching this book was, but when I read it...  I was really disappointed because everybody, like EVERYBODY said it was really good, but I found it otherwise.  For one, I found this book extrememly unrealistic.  The chances of someone like Landon Carter liking Jamie is practically zero.  For another, I found it weird that even someone like Landon would marry a dying girl.  At they married when they were 17!  That's just plain weird.  Someone told me that Landon Carter says' if you know what I mean' too much in the book.  I found that to be true, and also, Landon Carter said' by the way' and, 'Anyway' a little bit too much.  I can't understand why the author left the reader in suspense at the end when he didn't reveal whether Jamie died or not.  The end was sort of an enigma.  But, as I said before, I didn't really like the book so I won't recommend it to anybody.

B00003CXTG|5.0|A number of friends who saw and didn't rave about this movie wanted more of a documentary; a &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; with modern special effects. I differ: I believe that each movie stands on its own, both technically, and, more importantly, as a story. I liked the earlier film, but its flaw was and is that it is more of a documentary. &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; may well be a misnomer for a great story that goes well beyond December 7, 1941, but if you can set all that aside, this is, from almost all perspectives, a really good movie. The characters are believeable people experiencing real world problems, and one cannot help but be drawn into the drama thus created. Both male leads do very well, but I thought that special praise goes to Kate Beckinsale for portraying a young nurse who comes face to face with horrendous loss of life and injuries and, as a result, matures as a character from dilletant to combat nurse.  It's a great job of acting. The story of two young flyers starts in their boyhood and beginning careers as Army flyers (There was no US Air Force then, just the Army Air Corps). One (Ben Affleck) flys in the Battle of Britain and is believed killed; his friend ( Josh Hartnett) and his fiancee (Beckinsale) fall in love, and the dramatic tension occurs when Affleck surfaces alive and well. The special effects are fantastic; I never got the sense of a computer trying to fool me, although military historians will note that some of the ships that blow up could not have been at the real attack because their radar masts didn't exist then. But one can always nit pick at details. The fact is that &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; has suffered somewhat in the press, but don't let that cause you to turn away from it. You are in for a stunning visual experience with this one. And visually and sonically it is all that we have come to expect of the DVD medium.

I know the stones have tons of demos and even intramentals (cause I have many on bootlegs).  This is just another money making attempt by LSE Mick.  Com'on guys, give us some value for our money, throw a few old tracks of something at us.  Would it hurt so much?

1881273156|1.0|I'll make this short and sweet.  Before I read this travesty, I was generally pretty happy with my love life.  I had had several good relationships with women, but then I read this and followed it's advice, and I have barely talked to a woman since.  Avoid this like AIDS.
B00003CXB2|4.0|Lawrence of Arabia is undoubtedly one of the most ambitious films ever made, and director David Lean deserves all the credit he received and more for having accomplished it.  The scenery in this movie is breathtaking, and there is plenty of it.  The huge armies of Arabs in realistic costumes, fully equipped and riding camels and horses, is also a spectacular feat.  The acting in it is also superb, the highlight of which being the great Alec Guinness in one of his best roles.<BR>T.E. Lawrence, better known as El Awrence or Lawrence of Arabia, was a very complex and psychologically complicated man.  This movie skillfully manages to show him as he really was.  He was a hero, yes, but one who was mortal, and prone to failures and flaws just as the rest of us are.  He is shown here in his true light (at least as close to it as possible--he was a mysterious man).<BR>The only reason for giving this movie four stars is that it was a little too long--at times it seemed to drag a little bit.  I think the scenes with Lawrence and company riding through the desert could have been significantly reduced in time without any detraction from the movie.<BR>Despite its length, Lawrence of Arabia remains one of the most timeless classics ever made, and ranks among the greatest epic adventures of all time.
B0000048V8|5.0|Settle down with your kids (of any age) and take a break from the frantic pace of the holidays with this delightful story.<BR>Very little dialog, but gorgeous music and animation, will tell the story of a boy's flight through the winter skies with a friendly snowman. My kids, age 3 &amp; 5, found it fascinating and very funny. However -- the ending is a bit sad, as we all know what happens to snowmen when the weather warms up -- so it may be wise to discuss ahead of time with more sensitive kids: What is snow made of? What happens to snow when the sun shines on it? <BR>Having said that, my kids didn't appear to be too bothered by the fate of the snowman. All snowmen come back each winter. We plan to watch this video each Christmas! Great for all ages.
B00005RYQO|5.0|I actually saw XXX before I saw The Fast and the Furious.  The main reason I watched it was Vin Diesel.  Okay, so he lacks some acting skills, but he has amazing screen presence.  The plot is almost identical to Point Break, Paul Walker sounds like Keanu Reeves twin brother.   I've only owned this movie a few weeks but I already have it memorized.  The only disappointing actor in this film is Michelle Rodriguez.  Is her only facial expression to scowl and wear her sunglasses on her nose?  She was not a believable love match for Dominic.  Either way, the car scenes were enjoyable, but quite unbelievable.  Whenever I'm feeling not up to par I just pop this movie in and I lose myself in 2 hours of pure entertainment.  I LOVE VIN DIESEL
0792101448|5.0|I've always been a western movie aficionado and when I first saw Once Upon a Time...I didn't want it to end.  I now have the VHS and am anxiously awaiting the DVD.  Please!  Make it available soon!<br />I play the soundtrack frequently.  It is some of the most beautiful music I've ever listened to; perfectly created for the film.<br />I doubt we'll ever see in our lifetime a finer western with such star-studded cast.  Truly one to see and enjoy again and again!
B000066F6H|1.0|I laugh every time I hear people proclaim this or that band as \\"punk\\". That ... music died a long time ago and people still want to milk it. Punk was about bad playing, bad singing, and statement making. The statement made was \\"We Suck\\". And just as so called \\"punk\\" bands before them the Hives fit that statement. The singing, if you can call it that is god aweful. The musicianship is non-existant. The length of the cd should tell you about the song craft. The amazing thing is that people are eating this ... up. So if you like garbage than by all means buy this. If you insist on proclaiming punk your music taste at least listen to the source like The Ramones, The Clash,..etc.
B000003B6J|5.0|The first five tracks of this groundbreaking disc are the most powerful in rap. Bar none. Period.  This disc is critical to the understanding, progression and growth of rap as a form of musical expression and art.  And because NWA spawned so many influential artists, this disk is critical listening for any student of rap.  <br />I am of two minds about the violent lyrics on this disc. I don't like the idea of violence, but I think its important to view the violence expressed on this album in the context of (1) what was happening in LA at the time of its release and (2) the fact that an element of rap is fictionalization and exaggeration.<br />If you are new to rap and just beginning to enjoy to the genre, I recommend this disc. It is an excellent entre both to the gangsta style and the talents of Dr Dre, Ice Cube, Eazy E, and the rest of the NWA Crew.
B000065V1V|5.0|After a few disappointing efforts, I'd have to say David Bowie is back.  This is sounding like many of his earlier albums and he is proving that he still has it.  His voice doesn't seem to have lost it and the people he has backing him up sound pretty good.  I'd have to say this is a pretty good CD.
B000068TPN|3.0|Mel Gibson was pretty good in his role in Braveheart, so I was expecting decent acting in &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot;, noting that this is a &quot;true story&quot; kind of movies.<br />But instead of the intricate details, superb script and acting of &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, we have here a childish plot and theatrical acting that made one feel amused rather than cry with the soldiers' families.  Can you imagine official US Army telegrams informing the deaths of the soldiers were left unattended outside the front door of the Colonel's house for his wife to pickup &amp; distribute, at her convenience, to the devastated wives of the soldiers killed in action?  The wind might have blown some of them away and those poor wives will never know that their husband had been killed. This is the level of details and authenticity you might expect from this movie.<br />This movie appeared purposeless and did not adequately portray the heroism of the true soldiers. Probably because it seemed so faked? <br />Basically, you get plenty of action and loud explosions, but not much more. May be the fault were not the actors' or actresses', but the director's?
B00004YZFR|5.0|Altamont could have been just as good as Woodstock when you look at the bands who were playing! Jefferson Airplane,CSNY,Flying Burritos and The Stones were are their peak back then.It all started so well with a good atmosphere being created by The Flying Burritos.Chris Hillman said years later that they had no political statement to make and everyone was having a good time.Then you can feel the tension as the Hell's Angels roll into town.Its bad enough watching the violence on screen and what starts off as a good vibe turns into a nightmare!<BR>When the Stones took the stage I don't think there was much they could do to keep the peace,when you look at the hate stares Jagger was getting he tried his best for some calm.If the Stones had walked off stage things would probably got worse!<BR>The last scene when they are scrambling into the last helicopter is just like a scene from Vietnam! The end of a dream!!!
0525946284|5.0|I am an a Patterson and Grisham reader and found Follett a nice change! This book kept my attention so well that I read it in one sleepless night! Great story line, interesting plot, wonderful writting! The best book I have read in a long,long time!
B0000062FL|5.0|THIS IS one of my very few DIDs. ( Desert Island Disks - If you only had a few to listen to, and were on a desert island ). INCREDIBLE ! The disk we are reviewing (cd) is very nice, worth the price, and the extras are wonderfull bonus's.  Gypsy Queen drives the wife out of the room but but I'm in heaven. Cannot recommend enough ! ABRAXAS is , I think, SANTANA at their best.
B00006AW2F|3.0|To all you diehard Rolling Stones fans (like myself)---> we've finally got an \\"official\\" CD copy of \\"Metamorphosis\\" available to us!!<br /><br />Of course, through years, it was possible to find \\"not so legitimate\\" copies of \\"Metamorphosis\\" on CD, but outside of that, the only way to hear this album was by way of the 1975 vinyl edition.  Indeed, until now, no \\"official\\" CD edition was out there......not even a cassette edition!<br /><br />All excitement aside though, the album really isn't that good.  The real draw for me is its historical importance to the Stones catalog and some of the rare tracks found on this compilation.  A compilation that is full of outtakes, demos and alternatake takes.<br /><br />I only give it 3 stars, since some of these songs should never have seen the light of day...('Family')..while others should be played regularly in Stones concerts...('I'm Going Down').<br /><br />So listen at your own risk if you are a passive Stones fan.  but for you diehards, you know it is your duty to buy this.
B00006AFUR|4.0|I'm normally a purist with rock music in the sense that I stay away from anything with synth or drum loops.  This CD has a little of both, but it still rocks incredibly hard.  There was a band a few years back called HUM.  If they crashed into Nine Inch Nails, flew to Mars, and recorded an album there, this is what I imagine it would sound like.  I started listening to this CD on the way home from work yesterday.  I was only about ¾ of the way through it when I got near my house, so I started driving around just so I could hear the rest of it.  I pulled into the end of my driveway as the last part of the hidden track finished.  I just sat there and looked around for a moment, and felt as if I had returned to earth from Someplace Else.<br />Don't let the fact that the main person behind this band (Jared Leto) is an actor keep you from getting this CD.  He's serious about music, and intends to be around a long time.  This CD is not just a collection of songs, but a musical experience.  If you want something a little different than a collection of songs about breaking up with a girl, then go buy this album.
B000069AUI|5.0|just when you thought nothing could top the amazing collection of songs on parachutes, coldplay debuted a rush of blood to the head, and now i can't listen to anything but this album. it is a definite must-have for ANYONE who appreciates beautiful music with heartbreaking vocals. it's such a masterpiece.
B00005JL1C|3.0|I love this movie.It is my absolute favorite from 1987-88. It made me a lifelong fan of the wonderful Mary Stuart Masterson and fans of Lea Thompson and Eric Stoltz too. Read the other reviews to see how good this movie is. However, the DVD was not what I hoped. It is wide screen but does not appear to be anamorphic. The color is good but not great, same for the picture and sound quality. However, for a DVD with a list price of $$$$ you expect SOME extras but you get absolutely nothing! No trailer, no deleted scenes, no making of feature, no director commentary no Easter Eggs No NOTHING! ZIP. NADA.This DVD is an improvement over the tape and LD versions I had before but could have been so much more. ... I give the movie five stars but the DVD only two with three stars overall. LW
B0000028M7|5.0|This album got me through high school.   Period.  Every tune on the album is so universal that they spoke to me in 1993 the same way the do in 2002.  Dealing with issues such as Vietnam (The Rooster), agony of drug withdrawal (Junkhead) or f'ed up personal relationships (Down In A Hole)...this album kicks you hard in the stomach and doesnt let up until you are gasping for air on the last track.  If you like the processed cheese bands out now like Nickelback, Creed, etc......buy some fromage....Alice in Chains DIRT.
B00005ASHM|5.0|I must admit that I was never a Beach Boys fan.  I just couldn't deal with those sappy surf songs.  There really didn't seem to be any substance to them.  There was relief and satisfaction when I was introduced to Pet Sounds.  While Mike Love wanted to stay in a commercial rut, Brian Wilson obviously wanted to evolve and evolve he did!!  His final Pet Sounds product turned into complete musical inspiration that still flourishes today.  The hopeful &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice&quot;, the moving &quot;Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder)&quot;, the unorthodox &quot;Sloop John B&quot; and the masterpiece &quot;Caroline No&quot; all add up to individual, unpretentious genius.  It's too bad that the other Beach Boys couldn't understand it enough to completely get on board.  Pet Sounds in one of the greatest albums EVER.  It belongs in every music fan's collection.
B00005JKG7|5.0|If you're a fan of &quot;The Fog&quot;, then you will love this DVD transfer.  The picture quality is much better than the VHS and the extra's are good additions.  <br />If you like the horror genre, but you've not seen &quot;The Fog&quot;, then you'll probably enjoy this flick.  It has all the scares and suspense without the profanity, nudity, and gore.  Plus, there's actually a story with decent acting instead of some contrived collection of events that puts together a mis-matched group of teens who have no common sense.
0805062971|5.0|\\"If you don't know what you want, you end up with a lot you don't.\\"<br />From the very beginning, Fight Club grabs hold of you and pulls you into its world and won't let go until you finish the book. Palahniuk's unorthodox and no holds barred writing style make Fight Club a gem that will leave an indelible impression on you, whether you like it or not.<br />Fight Club makes you put on your thinking cap and won't let you take it off. Palahniuk's black humor is razor sharp as it cuts deeply into our materialistic values and societal norms that we hold dear. His message - we think we own our posessions, job, and lifestyle, but in reality, they own us.<br />Anyone who needs a wake up call that will make you rethink your life's priorities, order Fight Club. I give it my full 5 stars and recommend it to everyone - it is undoubtedly the most original and provocative book of the 90's.
B000060P79|5.0|This is really cute music. It's not too poppy [like Good Charlotte- they're WAY too vocal-driven], but it's still really sweet [think of a better MXPX]. <BR>If youre a teen, youre bound to find some lyrics here that you relate to, and REALLY love. <BR>There are adorable pop-punk love songs, angry I-hate-parents tracks, catchy I'm-so-unpopular tracks, and moany [in the best possible sense] ex-girlfriend songs.<br />I'd Do Anything- This shows the musical talent of these guys. At last! A catchy pop-punk band with *gasp* talent! Pierre has a very cool voice, and if you listen to the lyrics, you'll just MELT! seriously... Oh yeah, and this has Mark from Blink182.. hmmm this song is delicious... nice guitars. <br />The Worst Day Ever- this song encompassed my feelings of the summer I'm having. It switches between rockin' guitars and slow singing, you can REALLY rock out to the chorus. They got it nearly spot on here. My only complaint about this album, is perhaps a few samey moments, but that doesn't stop it lifting your spirits in small doses.<br />You Don't Mean Anything- I'm guessing the dude is singing about his parents here, or maybe it's someone else trying to change how he is. This is an awesome individuality anthem. Great music, sweet, sugary, punky, spiky, loud... everything cool. \\"I'm sick of being pushed around, I'm not gonna change, you can't make me!\\" roar!<br />I'm Just a Kid- catchy, very catchy. Well, you all know this song, not the best song on the album, but still great. It's stuck in my head. superglue superglue superglue....<br />Well that's all I've listened to so far because I'm savouring evey sweet moment of this cd. And you'll want to aswell. Seriously, buy this or I'll hurt you!<BR> This is SO gooooood! Better than chocolate. This is amazing quality punk-pop. Good Charlotte on the other hand, is complete rubbish, so if you like them, buy this and you'll be addicted. It's contagious.
B00005U122|5.0|Then the stage, the cheering, opening with the first few bars of \\"In The Flesh\\", lights, slides, action and we are away. Waters in the spotlight at the rear and above the stage, wonderfull back up singers led by the amazing PP Arnold set the tone for the evening.<br />Waters joins the other members of the band at stage level for \\"The Happiest Days Of Our Lives\\".  Waters half yelling/talking vocals can be a bit grating for some but it suits his style and the mood of the song.<br />\\"Another Brick In The Wall Part2\\" begins with it's familiar opening.  Waters takes a bit of a backseat to the backup singers and the guitar work of Doyle Bramhall II and \\"Snowy\\" White with great affect.<br />Waters brings out the acoustic guitar out for a quieter moment with \\"Mother\\". Journeyman guitarist Andy Fairweather Low assumes the bass role.  Waters in the spotlight on guitar and vocals. Clear, strong vocals augmented by the female backing vocals.  Female vocal solo and the mood becomes a bit uptempo with Doyle Bramhall II on guitar.  Back to Waters and the whole band .<br />Lights, expolsions, keyboards \\"Get Your Filthy Hands Off My Desert\\"  begins, same acoustic instrumentation. A moving \\"political\\" song.  \\"Southhampton Dock\\" Waters really has a great voice for this type of song.  Emotions flowing, tight acoustic guitar work. <br />Jon Carin on acoustic guitar as well as keys on \\"Pigs\\" and \\"Dogs\\".  Graham Broad belts out the dums to Bramhall's electric guitar. Good to see some tracks from \\"Animals\\". Bramhall and White working tightly together to share the lead guitar work.  Fairweather Low content to take a back seat. Bramhalls vocals are good but not great. I feel he has been practicing the \\"guitarist grimance\\" in the mirror a bit too much.<br />A table is set up and Waters, Bramhall, White, Fairweather Low have a drink and a game of cards watched by the backup singers as Carin, Broad, Wallace continue on.  A nice way to have a small break.<br />Another acoustically driven song in\\"Welcome To The Machine\\", Waters voice sounds a little weak but it may be the mix.  The keyboard work of John Carin is becoming a real hightlight of this band now. Atmospheric, moody. <br />John Carin on Pedal  Steel leads us into \\"Wish You Were Here\\" with Bramhall and I wish I was there.  Waters and the band are tight and seem to be just warming to the occasion.  Close your eyes.  The magic of Floyd is still alive in another incarnation.  <br />Silence as the haunting strains begin \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\".  Snowy White absolutely nailed the guitar intro and Broad on drums then Bramhall set up the scene for Waters vocals.  The huge screen at the back taking on the image of the subject.  The \\"jam\\" sequence really let this bunch of talented musicians show their wares. This is a song that really moves me when I hear it and this is no exception.  One of my all time Floyd favourites. Waters finally talks to the crowd to say \\"That was for Syd\\"<br />\\"Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun\\" and Waters on acoustic guitar, Broad on drums  and the 3 female back up singers and the sax solo  really put a lot of feeling into this before the whole band getting into it.  Snowy White (he could be a young Gilmour) pulls off another great solo. With Waters back on Bass and Carin on pedal steel Branhall on vocals   \\"Breath (in the air)\\"  comes to life.  Carin doing backup vocals may have been better doing lead vocals on this.  <br />This leads up to \\"Time\\" and \\"Money\\".  Graham Broad on drums is having a ball on the intro.  This is what a lot of people have come to see and hear.  Floyd.  It may not be THE Floyd but this is not a tribute or clone band either.  Andy \\"The Librarian\\" Fairweather Low even comes out to nail an amazing solo as if to show the upstarts (Bramhall and White) that the old guys cam still do it.<br />\\"Pros And Cons Of Hitchhiking\\" has Waters in fine voice in his half talking half singing style but the back up singers of Arnold, Kissoon and Melvoin \\"make\\" this song.  \\"Perfect Sense\\" has the crowd on its feet and is probably one of the highlights led by Waters and Arnold of this \\"Anthem\\".  Waters brings out the electric guitar for  \\"The Bravery Of Being Out Of Range\\". <br />Swirling keys of  Carin and Wallace, bass and brushed drums begin the \\"cynicism\\" of  \\"It's A Mirace\\" for a quieter more sombre piece. Tight harmonies, keys and drums are a highlight  on the very moving \\"Amused Itself  To Death\\". \\"Brain Damage\\" and close your eyes again and your with Floyd, there is no escaping it and surprisingly (or maybe not so) this seems to be where Waters is the most comfortable.  <br />A bit of banter and  then into \\"Eclipse\\" I feel that Branhalls lead vocal bits would be better left to Carin. \\"Comfortably Numb\\", \\"Each Small Candle\\" round out memorable performence .<br />A great band, visuals, lighting, sound, songs.  Waters has assembled a very talented group of musicians and vocalists.  All the musicians were very competent but I feel that the back up singers led by PP Arnold added so much more to the overall sound of the performance in front of a very appreciative crowd.  Not a bead of sweat to be seen anywhere but this was a true performance of heart and soul.  You know when you have seen a great group of musicians.  They make it look so easy.<br />Not Floyd but they live on in the music.  Waters and crew really nailed this.  <br />Criticisms?  <BR>Maybe Bramhalls lead vocal  sections (and guitarists grimances) could have been left to Carin, but this is only a minor \\"blemish\\".<br />Highlights ? <BR>Pushing  >PLAY and being transported for a few hours of a musical orgasm
630416923X|5.0|This set is amazing.  There are enough reviews here that accurately essay the content on the 8 cassettes; any hardcore Beatle fan already has this anyway, or has at least seen it or has it on her wish list.  The more important issue is, why in holy hell is this set not available on DVD?!  Unbelievable.<br />PUT THIS ON DVD!
0792844890|1.0|This is, without a doubt, one of the worst movies ever made.  How Mel Brooks can make both Young Frankenstein (a true classic) and this dull, unfunny, horrible movie just boggles the mind.  Baby Jane's daddy was wrong, apparently you can lose your talent.<BR>I made the mistake of suggesting to a friend that we see this movie when it was at the theater - and he still hasn't forgiven me.  I haven't forgiven me.
B000002U82|5.0|I heard &quot;Money&quot; on the radio when I was a junior in high school.  I didn't think it sounded all that great but realized later they'd cut some of the best parts out of it.  Later on, in my senior year I heard large chunks of the entire album.  This was a never before experience.  Today, it probably doesn't sound as unique as it did then, but nothing has matched this for a pioneering sound.  It didn't sound like any of the rock &amp; roll I'd heard previously and to classify this as rock &amp; roll I would say was due to Pink Floyd being considered a rock band.  This album sounds like too many different forms of music to give it one specific classification but aside from that...hearing this and listening to the lyrics makes you think about life like you hadn't thought of it before, especially if you're 17 years old.  I finally bought this album at age 21.  Playing it from beginning to end, alone, in the dark, during a concentrated listen...made it a &quot;5&quot;.  I have this on CD now, I still like it but don't listen to it much.  Pink Floyd hasn't aged well for me like it has others but for its time it was great and one of my most memorable experiences during my high school days.
0380820846|4.0|This is a good read.  Which take the reader on a nice romp through Regency England.  I do have to say it was rather sappy when Colin kept asking Penelope when she changed and started to look so different.  He just was not getting why he was finding her so attractive...  He understands at the end with a nice segway into the next Bridgerton novel.  Can't wait!
B00005JKJA|5.0|Firstly, I would just like to point out that the &quot;ten clues&quot; reproduced by Robin Bell should be accredited to Director David Lynch (they're from the DVD) not to a magazine!<br />Right, on to the review...<br />Quite simply this is one of the best pieces of cinematography I have ever seen. Okay, so it doesn't appear to make a lot of sense on first (or second, third, tenth) viewing, but that is after all Lynch's genius.<br />You will find yourself thinking about this film for days afterwards, and each time you view it you will spot things you missed last time. The effect is to make each viewing of the film a new experience.<br />Besides the thought provoking storyline, and the clever imagery, the film itself is also aesthetically pleasing. The camera work lends a feeling of first person presence - as if you were witnessing the events first hand. The use of light, colour and sound is exceptionally evocative, and the film, though set in the present eminates a timeless quality.<br />In short...buy this film, otherwise you will spend a small fortune renting it again, and again.
B001JV5BIA|4.0|Mari Collingwood (Sarah Cassell) and long time friend Phyliss (Lucy Grantham) are two teen girls who are on their way to a rock concert and out for fun. Mari has just turned 17 and has a birthday coming up, but the two girls get lost in the city meet up with a trio of vicious crooks named Krug (David Hess), Weasle (Fred J. Lincoln) and Sadie (Jeramie Rain)kidnap them and drug them. The next day they sexually abuse, rape, humilate, torture and murder them for soon the parents find out and get sweet revenge.<br /><br />A vicious, cold-hearted and brutal look at the nature of crime from writer and director Wes Craven whom made a very nice debut with this grim shocker. This film caused a fuss back in 1972 as it was originally going to be rated X but got cut and earned an R rating for the film was very controversial yet made a fortune at the box-office. Audiences fainted during screenings and even made some people sick, David Hess steals the show as one of the sickest and vilest bad guys to hit horror cinema whom you wouldn't trust. The film was produced by Sean S. Cunningham (who would later do \\"Friday The 13th\\") and became one of the most influential horror movies of the genre that even Roger Ebert liked, sure the acting is bad and there's some un-needed comic relief. This movie is a kick in the groin that never lets go as it's a bloody yet nicely done and vile journey into the madness that is a powerhouse all the way that paved a big way for shock-horror.<br /><br />This DVD contains the unrated version which improves over the cut \\"R\\" rated version as it would make people feel unfortable. This DVD has decent picture and sound with some cool extras like audio commentary, a short film from Wes Craven, Deleted Scene, Never-before-seen-footage, Featurettes and a documentary on the film's legacy.<br /><br />Also recommended: \\"Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer\\", \\"I Spit on Your Grave\\", \\"Maniac (1980)\\", \\"Frontier(s)\\", \\"Driller Killer\\", \\"Inside\\", \\"House on The Edge of the Park\\", \\"The Toxic Avenger\\", \\"Cannibal Holocaust\\", \\"The Devil's Rejects\\", \\"House of 1000 Corpses\\", \\"Halloween (1978)\\", \\"The Hills Have Eyes (1977 and 2006)\\", \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974)\\", \\"Grindhouse\\", \\"Wrong Turn 1 & 2\\", \\"Hostel 1 & 2\\", \\"Faces of Death\\", \\"Scream\\",\\"The Midnight Meat Train\\", \\"Pieces\\", \\"Men Behind The Sun\\", \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre part 2\\", \\"Leatherface Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3\\", \\"The Untold Story\\", \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003)\\", \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Beginning\\", \\"Mother's Day\\", \\"Otis\\", \\"The New York Ripper\\", \\"High Tension\\", and \\"Borderland\\".\\", \\"Cannibal Holocaust\\", \\"The Devil's Rejects\\", \\"House of 1000 Corpses\\", \\"Halloween (1978)\\", \\"The Hills Have Eyes (1977 and 2006)\\", \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974)\\", \\"Grindhouse\\", \\"Wrong Turn 1 & 2\\", \\"Hostel 1 & 2\\", \\"Faces of Death\\", \\"Scream\\",\\"The Midnight Meat Train\\", \\"Pieces\\", \\"Men Behind The Sun\\", \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre part 2\\", \\"Leatherface Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3\\", \\"The Untold Story\\", \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003)\\", \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Beginning\\", \\"Mother's Day\\", \\"Otis\\", \\"The New York Ripper\\", \\"High Tension\\", and \\"Borderland\\".
0140433627|5.0|The image that most of us have when hearing the name \\"Frankenstein\\" is a huge lumbering monster with little or no intelligence. This is the image I had when first reading Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein or the Modern Prometheus.\\" Nothing could have been further from the truth.<br />The story starts with letters between a man and his sister over his choice to explore the artic region. While trapped in ice, this main and the crew of his ship meet with the infamous Mr. Frankenstein. From here, Frankenstein tells the horrid story of how is attempt to play God backfired.<br />His story starts with young Frankenstein first leaving his home and the family and friend he loves so much. He is headed off to a university to study the natural sciences. During his time here, his reputation grows until he is one of the most respected members of the university. It is by chance that he happens to stumble upon the secret of creating life from that which is lifeless. After many months of solitude in his labratory, Frankenstein is able to successfully create a living being. The problem is that his creation is too hideous to behold. Frankenstein immediately shuns his creation as does the rest of society.<br />From here, Frankenstein gives the long account on how the creature came to be his ultimate tormentor, shadowing him wherever he travelled, giving Frankenstein's heart no time for rest.<br />What surprised me most about this story was just how human Frankenstein's creation was. He learned to speak and feel emotions just like a human being. He did not start out as an evil creature wanting to wreak havok on humans. It was society's reaction to him that drove him to vile actions. Even his \\"God,\\" his creator, Mr. Frankenstein, had forsaken him. A lot of references to \\"Paradise Lost\\" by John Milton were thrown into the story which added an interesting parallel between the Judeo-Christian creation of man and Frankenstein's creation.<br />Before reading this book you should try to cast off any preconceived notions you have about Frankenstein. You won't find any dimwitted brutes in this story, only some extremely tormented individuals who are brought to the brink of madness.econceived notions you have about Frankenstein.

006016848X|1.0|I was absolutely appalled at the blatant sexism of this book.  It is nothing but a collection of tired old gender stereotypes.  The only thing good that can be said about this book is that Gray is impartial; he insults both men and women equally.  He focusses on the most superficial aspects of human behavior as if they were profound, innate, and of the greatest importance.  According to \\"Doctor\\" Gray, the secret to having a successful relationship is to resign yourself to the fact that your partner is petty and shallow and always will be.  This book gives people dangerously bad advice.  There are plenty of good books available on relationship psychology by knowledgeable authors.  Read them and avoid this book.  It is worthless.
0380977788|5.0|Nobody can drench a book in creepy, dank atmosphere like Neil Gaiman -- and it doesn't matter if it's a kid's book.<br /><br />And \\"Coraline\\" -- now being released as a movie -- is no exception to Gaiman's track record. It's a haunting little dark fairy tale full of decayed apartments, dancing rats and eerie soulless doppelgangers, as well as a gutsy heroine who finds herself in this ominous \\"other\\" world.<br /><br />Newly moved into an aged apartment, Coraline (not \\"Caroline\\" is bored. Her parents are too busy to do anything with her, and her neighbors are either insane or boring.<br /><br />It's the sort of relentlessly dull world that any little girl would want to escape from -- until Coraline does. She encounters a formerly bricked-up door that leads into an apartment in another world, which looks eerily like her own.  In fact, it's so similar that she has a taloned, button-eyed \\"other mother\\" and matching \\"other father,\\" as well as a chorus of singing, dancing rats and magical toys.<br /><br />At first Coraline is fascinated by the other world, especially since her other parents are very attentive. Then she finds her real parents sealed inside a mirror. With the help of a sarcastic cat, Coraline ventures back into the other world. But with her parents and a trio of dead children held hostage, Coraline's only hope is to gamble with her own freedom -- and she'll be trapped forever if she fails.<br /><br />Without Neil Gaiman's touch, \\"Coraline\\" would just be another story about a kid who learns to appreciate her parents. But he infuses this story with a dark fairy-tale vibe -- decayed apartments, dead children in a mirror, beetles, disembodied hands, monsters that cling to the wall with souls in their grip, and rats that sing about how \\"we were here before you rose, we will be here when you fall.\\"<br /><br />That dark, cobwebby atmosphere clings to the increasingly nightmarish plot, as Coraline navigates a world where the other mother has every advantage. And Gaiman's wordcraft is exquisitely horrible -- the other mother's hands are compared to spiders, her hair to undersea tentacles. And the fate of the other father is a magnificently ghastly thing.<br /><br />He even infuses poetry into the horror (\\"A husk you'll be, a wisp you'll be, and a thing no more than a dream on waking, or a memory of something forgotten\\"), and a fair amount of macabre humour  (\\"I swear it on my own mother's grave.\\" \\"Does she have a grave?\\" \\"Oh yes. I put her in there myself. And when I found her trying to crawl out, I put her back\\").<br /><br />Coraline herself is a wonderful little heroine -- strong, sensible, self-sufficient but still fairly freaked out about what is happening around her. The sarcastic cat is a wonderful counterpoint. And the other mother is the stuff of nightmares -- she's utterly inhuman and merciless -- who  \\"wants something to love. Something that isn't her. She might want something to eat as well.\\"<br /><br />Neil Gaiman creates eerie, slightly warped worlds like nobody else, and he does an exquisitely horrible job in \\"Coraline.\\" Just never go through the door.man's wordcraft is exquisitely horrible -- the other mother's hands are compared to spiders, her hair to undersea tentacles.

B000022TSH|5.0|'Chinatown' is, without a doubt, the best of Polanski's films This is an exceptionally well-crafted film with so many layers, and subplots happening that you must watch this film from beginning to end with no interruptions.<BR>Jack Nicholson stars as Jake Gittes, a private detective whose main specialty is spying on straying spouses. His services are retained by a wealthy woman by the name of Evelyn Mulwray who suspects that her husband is being unfaithful to her. What should be a simple case of finding out whether Mr Mulwray is being unfaithful or not begins to resemble an English maze in which Jake finds himself getting deeper and deeper in the middle of. He begins to uncover a labyrinth of corruption and lies, to a point where Jake has trouble distinguishing his friends from his foes. <BR>It also becomes apparent that Evelyn has her own agenda, and that she may be using Jake. But for what purpose is not initially known, but as the plot progresses Jake comes to realise how little he really knows about Chinatown.<BR>This film's intriguing title is actually a metaphor for corruption and deceit, Robert Towne named it so when a vice cop told him that he worked the Chinatown beat and did as little as possible, and about the corruption.<BR>Interestingly, this was the second film that Polanski made after the heinous tragedy he suffered four years prior. This is obvious by his dark, brooding, albeit realistic look at the corruption within the Los Angeles culture of the time. And he never attempts to gloss over anything.<BR>Polanski should have won the Oscar for Best Director for this film surely, but since when have the truly deserving ever won that accolade?
B00003CWL6|1.0|I \\"get\\" this movie. In fact, I \\"get\\" it so good, it hurts and I am beyond it.  This can't really be what movie viewers want to see?  The dark side of every-day American life?  Are we all that shallow and self-absored that we crave more salt for our poor pathetic wounds?  What is so original about the theme of this story and do we really need to see more of the ordinary, desperate, pointless, droll complaining of a regular, everyday American life?<br />This movie offers Lester's point of view of his life, a pompus bemoaning of a man in mid-life crisis, his marriage to an infidel-woman who has no original thoughts which he has grown apart from, his daughter who is too self-absored to care about her parents and instead is interested in the boy-next-door who happens to be (surprise) yet another drug dealer, and of course the boys militant, homophobic father and brain-dead, lackluster mother, and last but not least--the beautiful friend of Lester's daughter which gives Lester the usual, routine fantasies and takes us back to poor Lester's story.  'Round and 'round we go.<br />All sounds familiar, doesn't it?  Movie producers must think we don't get enough of it in our own lives!  They are certain that although we live it everyday, we want to pay to see more!  Been there, seen it, done it. Moving on.  We can all say that, can't we? Do we really want to see another movie about it? Come on!<br />I challenge you to try to image what other cultures think when they view this movie...look at those righteous Americans, who have so much prosperity, blessings, and everyday comforts, becrying another banal tale of sad, woe-is-me American lives!  If you believe this movie deserves the awards it received, then you really DON'T \\"get\\" it!<br />How ridiculous we are to create one story after another, constantly crying about our truthfully small problems, and then to create so much praise and bravado for them!  Wouldn't it be so much more \\"taking-the-high-road\\" to care about something else besides our selfish selves?  OK, there are tons of movies out there, both great ones and garbage.  But watch out for the ones that win for political reasons and not truly for the pure quality of the movie. <br />Yes, Look Closer!  There are hundreds of quality movies worth viewing with thoughtful messages worthy of great praise and a closer look!  We are surrounded by a whole world which knows true desperation and genuine suffering.  Those are the stories which make great \\"brain food\\" and have genuine potential for certain entertainment worthy of many great awards--truly holding meaning this time--or don't you \\"get\\" it?

Young American's desperately need to be introduced to this artwork. It will save a lot of growing pains, let me tell you!

B00005NI5Y|5.0|Somewhere along the line I bought that old saw about Dylan as deep and meaningful, the voice of his generation, the most important American musician of the past 50 years and all that.  Whether these images are true or not, they imply that the man has no sense of humor.  This is a crock.  In truth, he's been cracking jokes for years - he's one of the funniest men on record (sorry) - and few people  noticed because they thought he was speaking from the right hand of God or something.  Well, if this CD doesn't correct that impression I don't know what will - it's even got a knock-knock joke on it, for crying out loud.  Above all, this music is fun.<br />Not that it isn't serious, too - the Rolling Stones haven't sounded this good in years, and as for the cartoon stuff you hear on the radio these days, it isn't even within spitting distance of Dylan here.  The lyrics, too, have weight - when not spewing atrocious puns, the words call up deep values and deep pain on cuts like &quot;Sugar Baby&quot; and &quot;High Water&quot;.  Even on such otherwise hysterical tunes as &quot;Too Much to Ask&quot; and &quot;Summer Days,&quot; the old wisdom and lost love flash out from between the jokes.<br />No, when I say &quot;Love and Theft&quot; is fun above all else, I'm talking about Dylan's attitude.  It's himself he doesn't take seriously - he sings in every cheesy American style there is, from Tin Pan Alley to honky-tonk to minstrel show, in a truly astonishing busted-muffler croak.  He's America's court jester, the national con man, charming and roguish and totally unreliable, an impression that his Rhett Butler moustache does nothing to offset.  He looks like a river boat gambler getting ready to relieve you of your wallet and then have you tossed overboard, and he sounds like your crazy old uncle who can tell lies all night as long as you keep his glass filled.<br />Let's face it, Bob Dylan could never sing, even in his prime.  This, however, is just plain ridiculous.  And the most surprising part is that, even with the voice of a vaguely untrustworthy bullfrog with heartburn, he still makes incredible music.<br />Part of the reason for this is the fact that Dylan has evidently reached the point where he knows he can do whatever he likes, and he doesn't seem to care much whether people listen or not.  He's always disavowed the notion that his music could provide a basis for one's life purpose, but despite the disavowal he often seemed very conscious of his role as a generational spokesman.  On this album he's finally let that responsibility drop and started to have fun consistently, meaning be damned.  Like he says here, &quot;The future for me is already a thing of the past.&quot;<br />My only complaint about Love and Theft is my complaint about most of Dylan's work, even his best.  There's always the temptation to quote his best lines, and there are plenty of them here.  Doing so fails to address the one frustrating thing about Dylan; too often, his lyrics sound like collections of maxims instead of cohesive stories or ideas.  Once in awhile you listen to a Dylan song and say to yourself &quot;That's profound - what the heck does it mean?&quot;<br />Sometimes this works and sometimes it doesn't.  In his early career, Dylan's tendency toward that kind of fracturing in songs like &quot;Desolation Row&quot; worked partly because he functioned at a historical moment when the whole country seemed to be breaking apart and forming new shapes, so that fractured lyrics reflected what was going on at the time.  He had great bands then, as well.  Both of those forces are at work on &quot;Love and Theft&quot;; again we live in a fractured age, and again Dylan has a great band to play with.  After all, these guys have been with him for months on the so-called Never-ending Tour and they respond to each other almost before anyone does anything, they're so in synch (pun intended).  So, although it can be hard to follow the man's thoughts, the songs function very well indeed.  Besides, Dylan sounds as relaxed as he would if he and the band were kicking back on the porch, and who expects cohesion at a time like that?<br />Over the course of a long career, Dylan has proved that truly great art comes from practicing hard and then taking it easy.  It's a hard lesson to learn and a harder truth to believe, but actually Dylan knew it all along.  Back in the 60's some interviewer asked Dylan if he considered himself more of a rock singer or a folk singer, and he said &quot;Oh, I consider myself more of a song and dance man, y'know.&quot;  Pressed for an explanation, he said &quot;Oh, I don't think we have time to go into that right now.&quot;  Obviously not; it's taken him about 35 years to go into it, and &quot;Love and Theft&quot; is the result.<br />Benshlomo says, The truly great ones make it look like fun.unction very well indeed.

B000067CPX|5.0|As an older fan of some select RHCP tunes. I could never get into some of the more intense songs to justify buying each albumn that they produced. Greatest hits type offerings was my limit and even skipped a few tunes on those. However this for me is THE Peppers CD I've been waiting for. Its a master in my mind. Their musicianship just shines on this CD. Each memeber is clearly at the top of their game. The production is flawless and the creativity is amazing. Its a mature RHCP that comes through with something for older and younger fans to feast on. Venice Queen has got to be the best last song on any CD.   In reading other reviews I've notice a trend. I havn't taken this CD out of car machine for three weeks. Spooky!!! Wonder how it will sound indoors? Might have to burn a copy. Really its truly special. No throw aways on this one..Thanks guys ...Buy it and \\"All will be revealed my friend\\". Its ALL GOOD
B000067CPX|2.0|The decline of a once powerful, compelling and funky band continues.  This stuff is just a hair above Celine Dion.  If this album were any good, it would still be a top 10 Amazon seller.  I guess word spread quickly that it...um...well, uh...stinks.
B00006GFAB|5.0|A generous collection of nicely-remastered hits with an overwhelming emphasis on the 1970s. It's hard to criticize the selections (all the hits are here), although many Kiss fans will be able to cite their own minor omissions. Kudos to the compilers for including Ace Frehley's solo hit, &quot;New York Groove&quot;. This is now the best one-disc introduction to/summary of the legendary Kiss and a hard rock gem. Too bad about the skimpy booklet, though.
0312932081|5.0|I know this is heretical, but in terms of sheer enjoyment I actually prefer some of the sequels. The mood of _Ender's Game_ is a bit oppressive, and as a former homeschooler who has never fit in well to conventional peer groups I find the social world of Battle School frightening and even repulsive. Of course, that's the point--the book appeals precisely to nerdy people like me who identify with Ender's anxiety and isolation. We would love to think that, like Ender, we are brilliant heroes on whom the world's salvation depends. And that's where the book gains its power. It sucks us in by making us identify (in wish-fulfillment) with Ender's brilliance and his unique role in history, and then it clobbers us with the realization of the horrific cost of being a hero. _Ender's Game_ is the answer to the legions of juvenile books in which young heroes, \\"just like us,\\" solve the unsolvable mystery or stop the evil treasure-hunters or save the universe from the forces of darkness. Card says, in effect, \\"So you enjoy imagining yourself a hero? What if, suddenly, you found out that what you had been imagining was real? What if the heroic games you play really resulted in the deaths of millions, in the extinction of a sentient species? How would you feel then?\\"<br />Yet _Ender's Game_ is no simple morality tale. There's plenty of morality in it, but it can't be expressed in a formula (which means that the preceding paragraph is only partially accurate). Card brings this home in the sequel, in which we see how from idolizing Ender humans come to hate and despise him (ironically through his own writings and those of Valentine), and yet neither response really fits the reality of what he did.<br />For Ender cannot be reduced to a stick figure, unlike most characters in sf. The great strength of _Ender's Game_, the reason it is one of the greatest books of its genre, is the characterization of Ender. This is not without flaws (does anyone really believe, imaginatively, that Enderis quite as young as Card would have us believe? This will be a strength when the movie comes out, since the movie will almost certainly have to add a few years to Ender's age), but it is one of the great triumphs of sf, a genre not known for its characterizations. _Ender's Game_ is not primarily an adventure story or a novel of social criticism; it is above all the story of Ender's struggle to save his soul, to develop his gifts without destroying himself and those around him. Does he succeed? Read the book and decide for yourself.

0066620996|5.0|Jim Collins brilliantly displays his extensive research throughout his eye opening book, Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap...and Others Don't.  I really don't read much for leisure, but this book kept me interested until the last page.  It showed how to take a good company and make it great, by giving comprehensive guides for managing people and mostly importantly managing yourself in a work environment.  It used modern day examples of companys such as Walgreens and Eckerd, companies I have actually shopped at.  Collins and his team of researchers conducted detailed research among great companies and gave comparisions as to why each company succeded and why their comparision company did not.  If you plan on running your own business at some point in your life, this is a must read.  If you work at a company and hope to climb the latter to managament, this is a must read.<BR>This book takes a look at all aspects of a company and how each employee must realize their role and fulfill it.  He attributes that one of the most important aspects in becoming a &quot;great&quot; company is possessing a Level 5 Leader.  The term Level 5 refers to the highest point of a hierachial scale created by Collins, in which the leader embrasses the first 4 levels of the scale to become a caring and professional leader. He goes on to give strategies for guiding the company in the right direction, keeping the right employees, getting rid of the wrong ones, and putting the right ones into the right positions. Some of the main aspects he contributes to having a good company is Level 5 Leadership, finding the right employees and utilizing them in the right positions, being able to &quot;confront the brutal facts&quot;, understanding them and then being able to deal with them, embracing the Hedgehog Concept, providing a culture of discipline within the company, and lastely dealing with technology accelerators.<br />Read this book.<br />Its worth your time.

People need to just chill... in this life there is more than enough room for an addition band to praise.<br />Promising and Strong... wanting so much to be alternative but closer in skin to The Sundays.... if not the Carpenters...  A great disc.
B00005JKNC|3.0|In recent years, it would appear that director Darabont has never met a script he was willing to cut. The Green Mile, while entertaining, would've been much better had it been shorter. The same is true of The Majestic. It just goes on and on and on, an Energizer Bunny of a movie that finally feels as if it's never going to end. <br />Jim Carrey gives one of his solid, non-mugging engaging performances when the audience can actually care about his character, rather than marveling over the remarkable fashion in which he can contort his features. The stand-out performance is given by Martin Landau as the father who believes his war-hero son has returned in the form of amnesiac Carrey.<br />The movie is a paean to good old-fashioned American virtues, complete with a climactic scene where Carrey gets to give a rah-rah speech before the House Committee on UnAmerican Activities about true values--as close to mom's apple pie as you can get. While it's intended to be a reminder of a time (the 50s) that was supposedly kinder and gentler, the net effect is to make the viewer grateful for the present. As well, there is an extended scene when the town of Lawson celebrates Carrey's return with a great big outdoor party. Carrey and his former fiancee are invited to lead off the dancing to Acker Bilk's &quot;Stranger on the Shore&quot; -- a song that wasn't written until 1962. It's a little amazing that no one on the production caught this anachronistic goof.<br />This is a movie worth renting; it's definitely not an item to buy.

B00006FXB6|5.0|After getting hooked to these guys on Rated R and picking up QOTSA I must say the wait was long for this piece off fine plastic.  These guys are one of the few bands to churn out great rock with any hybrid junk on the radio.  I bought this Tuesday and it hasn't seemed to leave my player the entire week.  <BR>Millionaire, No One Knows, 1st It Giveth, Go w/ the Flow, Mosquito Song, &amp; Gonna Leave You, there's a lot tunes that just grab you at first listen.  <BR>This album demands long drives with the stereo peaked for performance.  Of course these guys are just as good through the headphones to catch the subtle nuiances going on behind the fuzz and rythym.  The DVD is a nice added touch but not a dealbreaker the bargain is in the album itself.  Great band, great music.

Although I thought the book might go in some other directions, and could have been a bit longer, I nonetheless thoroughly enjoyed it. I think it is a good sign when you feel a novel is too short, it means you wanted to read more!
B00006AW2F|3.0|I have heard so many terrible reviews for this record, that I feel I must vindicate this poor album.  First of all, for anyone who doesnt know, this is a collection of outtakes, alternate versions, and unreleased material released by the stones I believe in the mid-70's.  However, the material is basically split in half between the groups early period 64-66 and the beggars banquet/let it bleed period.<br />     The early material is mostly non-descrip filler,by the books blues and R&B make up most of this, for my money this is almost worthless material.  Some of the stuff from 66-67 has some \\"oh so pretty\\" lite-psychedelic touches, when the band was in there dandy whimsical faze, interesting, I suppose.<br />     The real meat of this album starts with track 8, The kickass cover of Stevie Wonder's \\"I Dont Know Why\\", I believe this was taken during the Beggars Banquet sessions.  They actually do the song better than Stevie!, they give it the Stones electric makeover, complete with horn section, definately a great lost gem, not surprised that they did not release it, I dont think a cover of something as contemporary as Stevie Wonder would have really gelled with on Beggars... or Let it bleed.. <br />      \\"Jiving Sister Fanny\\", now I dont understand why this didn't pop up maybe on Exile or something, but it is a wonderfully fun Stone-ified rock number by, Bill Wyman of all people!!   \\"Downtown Suzie\\" and \\"Family\\" both sound like Beggars Banquet era Stones, \\"Downtown..\\" having some of the whimsical flourishes of \\"Factory Girl\\", however is does develop into a great country-blues groove.  \\"Family\\" on the other hand is just bizzare, in the same vein as say \\"Sister Morphine\\", but no where near is comprehendable or interesting.<br />    The version of \\"Memo From Turner\\" here is much less interesting and sounds far more hurried than it's released counterpart.  It is just the chords played on electric guitar with straight rock drumming, lacks the funky drums and inventive slide guitar, not to mention Jaggers vocals that sounded like he was at least half way into the song, that made to real version so fun.  <br />    \\"I'm Going Down\\" is basically a mindless 1970 era Stonesy RAWK song, like a boring version of \\"Brown Sugar\\" or something, only with no hook and nothing to distinguish it from any other song. <br />     Pretty much an album for Stones fans only, others will love it or hate it.....good luck
0553573403|5.0|It can be so difficult to find a good quality Fantasy Series written by a great author. George Martin makes this quest a little easier with this first book. I have read several other books recently, with excellent customer reviews, that were absolutely terrible - no plot, spelling errors, etc. This is not one of them. There are no editing or grammar mistakes and the author's writing style is wonderful. Each chapter gives you a piece of the story from the perspective of a different character. The events that occur in this book are clever and oh so dastardly. I hate, hate, hate some of the characters in this book and I absolutely love some of the other ones. I have not read the other books yet, however, after half-way through this book I can already tell that this is a trilogy that I want to read to the end. So I just ordered the other two. I have noticed that many reviewers tend to give either 5 or 1 stars.<BR>I am not one of them. So when I give this book 5 stars you can trust me that this is a good novel.
B00005JL3A|4.0|The Genera of zombie movies has had many cogs in its wheel.  For example Day of the Dead, Night of the Dead, Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the living dead and so on.  Resident Evil proves that this formula can still work for an audience in the 21st century.  The biggest fault of this movie is what it doesn't use.  <br />These include 90% of the cast and its soundtrack.  It is a wonderful B movie and if it's a choice between this and Pearl Harbor rent Resident Evil.  I personally can't wait for the sequel
B00005JKOI|4.0|With the release of this film onto DVD, I finally have all of the 80's &quot;Brat Pack&quot; films. This is my favorite one of the genre, excepting only The Breakfast Club. We explore many facets of teen life in this film, from the rich/poor romance between Molly Ringwald and Andrew McCarthy and the peer pressure from the various &quot;cliques&quot; which so controlled our high school lives, to parental issues and unrequited love. While the major players deliver solid performances, it's Jon Cryer and Annie Potts who really give this film an extra push as the kid with the crush on his best friend and the odd older friend who often acts as a surrogate mother to Andie. The depth of feeling in this movie brings the teenage years alive as the characters struggle to find out who they are and what they want out of live. While some of the performances and scenes are a little over the top emotionally, I am proud to put this title in my DVD collection.
B00000ILBK|3.0|You loyalists will probably hate me for writting this but I think this is one of the weakest star trek movies ever made.  What I mean is with the exception of Star Trek 5 the plot is the most poorly executed of all the Star Trek movies.  <br />Some parts were great, <br />when Worf and Picard sang Gilbert and Sulivan<BR>As always, the space battles <BR>The Picard diplomacy tactic <br />Some parts were bad <br />Data and the children <BR>Tori and Riker getting their hormones messed with <br />Please be kind to me, I just didn't like this movie all that much.
B000009CEM|4.0|I was excited about this album when it came out because I was expecting more songs like those on Demanufacture, their previous album. When I got Obsolete, I was real into it for about a week or so, then my interest dropped off rapidly. I began noticing things about it I didn't like. One of my biggest complaints is the lack of synthesizers in most of the songs, which is what helped give Demanufacture a sci-fi feel that this album really should have had. Some of the songs near the middle of the album (Hi-Tech Hate, Freedom or Fire, and Obsolete) are very intense, but they all sound like the same song, and aren't particularly catchy. And the song Edgecrusher sounded too much like Fear Factory was making a move into rap metal / nu-metal territory. After not listening to the album for a while, I decided to give it another shot. Aside from a few flaws, it's actually a pretty good album. I still love Burton's screaming at the end of Shock, and Smasher/Devourer and Securitron are decent hangbangers that sound more like the Fear Factory I used to know. The last two tracks are my favorites on the album. Resurrection is a powerful, dramatic climax, and Timelessness is a bleak, depressing finale. All in all, it's worth getting, but I would still recommend trying Demanufacture before this one.
B00005JKJA|3.0|I always thought the bleeping out of the pubic hair was only for the Cable Channels ( family fare ). If a movie is rated R, it is sold only to 18 plus people, I expect to have a guarantee of a complete uncensored director's cut film. Unfortenately it does not happen again in this movie and the only frontal nudity scene is blotched out completely. I haven't found on the web a site that could warned us about this cheating on the customers.
630157401X|4.0|For now. Since they're comin out with a new indy adventure. but anywho.  This is a really great action/adventure movie.  It's got the Humor of Temple of Doom, and the Great action scenes of Raiders.  Put them together and u get a quest for the holy grail.  THere are a bunch of minor action scenes, so the movie never get's boring.  Along with the huge finale scene ontop of the Tank.  Every Indy movie has that moment that sends Shivers up your spine.  In this case, i get mine, when Indy puts a rock in the cannon which blows up one of the guns.  Then that army guy opens up the hatch, and he looks around and see's Indy coming up right behind him, and that moment the music just kicks in and makes it a really heroic moment.  anywho, yeah, this movie never get's dull, and has numerous chases...... <br />train chase - young indy is chased by a bunch of bandits ontop of a speeding circus train<br />boat - Indy now seeks revenge on the bandits in an explosive end<br />Boat Chase - Indy and Elsa are chased through the waters of Venice on speedboats from crazy men with machine guns.<br />Motorcycle chase - Indy and his dad are being chased by 4 motorcycle Nazi men<br />Airplane battle/Car chase - Indy and his dad are chased by nazi warplanes in a plane, but then they retreat into a car and are cahsed by them in an explosive finish<br />Tank finale - a giant fight aboard a tank, nothing get's better.

0316666343|4.0|Fourteen-year-old Susie Salmon was murdered.  Rather than that being the end of her story, however, it is only the beginning.  She has gone to \\"her\\" heaven and is now looking down to Earth watching her loved ones attempt to go on with their lives.<br />In Susie's Heaven, she lives in an apartment with a roommate.  She can go to the high school that she so longed to attend on Earth.  There are many dogs . . . because she wants there to be.  Susie can have anything she desires in her Heaven . . . except the return of her life and the experiences she would have had while growing older.<br />All she can do now is watch from above.  She sees the investigators trying to solve her case as her murderer destroys evidence.  She watches as her first love struggles with the feelings he still has for her, and a young girl she brushed past on her departure from Earth becomes obsessed with first Susie and then others like her.  And she is the silent witness to the slow descent of her parents' marriage.<br />Life goes on without Susie, but do those she left behind actually live or are they just going through the motions?  <br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Alice Sebold has chosen to tell this story from a very unique viewpoint . . . that of a murdered young girl.  In this way, the reader is able to feel not only what the \\"survivors\\" are going through, but also share in the emotions of a girl plucked from existence before she had the chance to really live.<br />The characters are given dimension and become easy to identify with on many levels.  That, matched up with the subject matter involved, makes this a story that will stick with the reader for some time.
0316666343|5.0|I am not normally a recreational reader...but when I picked up this book I could not put it down. What I thought would be a morbid tale turned into a moving story. Alice Sebold's depiction of a 14 year old girl and her view of the world couldn't be more accurate. This book is not only about how Susie saw her family deal with the pain of her loss on Earth, but how she also came to terms with it. I have loaned this book to 3 friends now and all have the same reaction. This book will bring you laugher, tears, and peace.

B00005PJ8I|4.0|Cast Away is the story of Chuck (Tom Hanks), a FedEx delivery worker who finds himself stranded on a desert island after his plane goes down.  On each end of the movie is the story of his life back in the \\"real world\\"; however, that story is somewhat undeveloped and underemphasized.  Before the crash he had just proposed to his fiance, and upon his return he finds that she is married with children (and on a side note, either time moved faster on the mainland or else his loving fiance was married and pregnant in less than a year after his disappearance).  I felt that subplot should have either been left alone or else dealt with in a more elaborate way; the ending left the movie feeling incomplete.<br />However, the heart of the movie involves Chuck's time on the island, and it is simply Hanks at his best.  Chuck is alone, trying to survive; every little task could mean the difference between life and death.  For Hanks, this means he must display the gamut of emotions about seemingly trivial matters with no other actors to help with the illusion.  I know of no other actor that could have me to the point of tears when a volleyball starts to float away from him.  No offense to Russel Crowe, but how he won Best Actor for playing a stoic, monosyllabic gladiator over this performance is one of life's great mysteries.  For fans of great acting performances, this one is highly recommended.
B000059XUI|3.0|(NB: This review was written for the earlier DVD release of Superman II, NOT the Richard Donner rerelease)    I recently had cause to revisit the early-80's classic that is Superman II for the first time in almost 20 years.  It was, in some ways, almost as good as I remembered.  The story line is better than most comic book films - with a heavy dose of irony offered by Superman's choice to renounce his powers just when his father's adversaries arrive on Earth.  The performances are, generally speaking, also good - Reeve nicely separates Superman from Clark, Margo Kidder is great as Lois, and Terrence Stamp's performance as General Zod is nicely calibrated.  Although the long-promised meeting between hero and villains is postponed until the last quarter of the movie, it delivers some delicious fireworks and a nice ending.    The movie is not without its weak spots, which are not hidden by the DVD.  Richard Lester's direction attempted to add some painfully unfunny sequences to the storyline - most agonizing is the strained humor of the \\"wind\\" sequence.  Also, the DVD preserves the choppy consistency of the film.  Some of this was unavoidable, given Marlon Brando's legal antics to prevent scenes he filmed from being used, but other scenes not involving Brando were needlessly cut.  There is no \\"deleted scenes\\" feature - in fact the special features offered on this DVD are pretty minimal.      This minimalistic rendering of the movie is a real disappointment.  Superman II has, at a glance, roughly the same appeal as its predecessor.  This DVD deserved the same care given to the special edition DVD of the original.    Still, since this is the only edition in town, as far as Superman II is concerned, it is worth having.  When one considers how much misfortune dogged the filming of this one - the change of directors, Brando's usual childish behavior (one wishes that the casting director had noted Brando's earlier stunts where the Godfather series was concerned, and cast someone more reliable), and antics by the producers which included bouncing checks and driving out Richard Donner - it is remarkable that the product of all this turmoil is a very entertaining film.  I'd love to see a special edition of this; until then I'll be happy with the one I have.

B0000687L5|5.0|I adore Tim Roth. After having seen him in \\"Pulp Fiction\\" follwed up with \\"Four Rooms\\" and \\"Rob Roy.\\" What a diversified actor with a talent for facial expression! He manages to capture whatever emotion the character is feeling with such conviction (and it never seems to matter what role he finds himself in) that you will find yourself feeling what he is feeling! Pain. Pleasure. Joy. Peace. Awe. You name it - he accomplishes it! Not many actors can pull that off - not in every role...Tim Roth can and does! I find him to be one of the most versatile, mesmerizing, and underrated actors today! Okay. With that said, now the movie.<BR>I caught this movie late one evening on the IFN channel of my local cable station. With so many cookie cutter, special effect hounds, and blockbuster type movies out there, IFN (independant film network) fills the void with clever, charming, and intriguing films...not movies...films! (Yes there is a difference!!!)<br />\\"The Legend of 1900\\" is a refeshing change from the summer of '02 actionfests! This is a simple movie with a simple concept with a profound message for us all delivered in a unique, clever, sentimental, charming, and deeply affecting way. Throughout the film the viewer is torn between two worlds as Roth's character grows. You want him to go, you want him to stay, you cheer for him all the way! You laugh with him, you cry for him. You see the impact this man has on the people around him and then you ache for the narrator at the end of the story! It's bittersweet to watch as this character becomes a man, faces his lonely life head on surrounded by people who love him, but don't really know him. All the while you are comforted by the impact he has on those around him.<br />If this isn't enough reason to see this film...here's another one. My 14 year old son is a typical video game playing, action hero worshiping, Star Wars loving, teenager who is also counting the days until The Two Towers and the Matrix open. He can't sit stillduring a movie unless it is action packed with battles, fights, and loud sounds... As he came down to say goodnight one evening he stopped to watch this film with me for a few minutes - he thought it was something to do with the Titanic. Knowing it was his bed time, he asked if it would be on again. We checked and found it was scheduled for two days later right after school. I didn't think he'd want to watch it...but also being a Tim Roth fan (he loved Four Rooms and Planet of the Apes) he remembered, watched, and enjoyed the film. Ah - a convert to my side! If my 14 year old kid liked it - you will too!
0767827716|5.0|Despite some opinions, Christine is a key movie to have in any horror collection.  Although, the ending should have been kept the way it was originally planned, instead of crushing Christine into a cube and ending the movie...  Haha - room for a sequal... The DVD needs more features, and they need to release a soundtrack and not a score.  There are some great songs in that movie, not only the oldies but the 1970's songs as well.. All in all, buy this movie - your thirst for satisfaction will be quenched with this movie.

B00005U122|4.0|This is a DVD from Roger Waters 2000 concert tour.  The music itself is about 2 and a half hours long.  It has the exact same track listing as the 2 CD set of the same name.  For special features, there is a very short biography on each member of the band, a gallery of still pictures and a 15 minute video of the group preparing for the tour.  The video isn't very insightful, except that it shows how well scripted the concert is.  Even the \\"thank yous\\" between songs are planned in advance.<br />The is a very good DVD, but it isn't the best concert DVD I have seen.  For instance, King Crimson's Deja Vroom is better technically, artistically and has better features.  In The Flesh does come in stereo or Dolby 5.1.  The sound quality is excellent.  The picture is high resolution, but the camera work isn't that spectacular. It doesn't give you that feeling of being immersed in the concert.  It is more like you are sitting in the back row. The camera focuses on the wrong parts of the groups and the wrong time.  Someone will be doing a solo, while someone else is featured in the video.  <br />But, the important thing on a concert video is how good is the music.  This is the second best live album put out by any members of Pink Floyd.  It is better than Pulse or The Delicate Sound of Thunder, and on a par with Ummagumma.  The best Pink Floyd live album is \\"Is There Anybody Out There\\".<br />The unfornate thing is that none of the best Pink Floyd live material is available anywhere.  They were simply amazing and creative during the seventies.  They were constantly experiementing with the material.  Dark Side of the Moon was originally played as a suite called \\"Eclipsed\\".  Later, the group did a 60 minute version of Dark Side of the Moon, where they really strectched out the material in amazing ways (not like the lame version on Pulse).  Animals and Wish You Were Here were first played in concert before turning up on record.  <br />Roger Waters has done a better job playing many of these songs on his earlier tours in 1982 (with Eric Clapton) and in 1987. David Gilmore's solo tours were better than his tours with Pink Floyd in the eighties and nineties. <br />There are some very good tracks on this DVD.  The real stand out is Set The Controls For the Heart of the Sun.  Then there are tracks that aren't that spectacular.  The studio versions of the songs from Amused To Death are much better.<br />In 1999, Waters got up the courage to tour again. He was worried about touring again because his 1987 tour was a moderate flop, only half filling arenas. But it was different in 1987. He had just released the horrible \\"Radio KAOS\\", which turned off many fans. Plus, Pink Floyd was touring at the same time. It turned out that Waters played more real Pink Floyd songs, and did them better, for the most part. <br />Now it is 1999. He just released \\"Amused to Death\\", which was the best Pink Floyd album since \\"The Wall\\". He had no competition from Pink Floyd, which hadn't toured in 5 years, and the word of mouth got out on how good his 1987 tour was. Waters rapidly sold out the small concert halls and had to switch to medium sized arenas.<br />In 1999, his show was around 2 and half hours (slightly longer than 2 CD's). In 2000, Waters modified his set list. He dropped some songs and added a few others and ordered everything so it would now fit nicely on two CD's. The change was for the better. He dropped some unnecessary songs like the Powers That Be, but some good ones like Another Brick in the Wall Part 1 and What God Wants. But he made up for it with adding Set Your Controls For the Heart of Sun (the best thing on the CD) and the new song Each Small Candle (which is about 8 minutes long). <br />For this tour, Waters has a good supporting band, of a guitar onslaught (three guitartists), keyboards, saxophone and backup singers. Some people complain because the guitarists don't sound like David Gilmore. Well, that is good. It adds new dimensions to the songs. When I buy a live CD, I don't want to hear a duplication of the studio song. When I want to hear David Gilmore, I will listen to the real thing.<br /> Waters does a nice job of playing the Pink Floyd classics, but he has done it better before. In 1987 he combined Another Brick in Wall Parts 1 and 2. Here he just does Part 2 by itself, leaving off the fantastic guitar intro from Part 1. His 1987 version of Welcome to the Machine was the best I have ever heard, with a very powerful machine driven beat. Alot of reviewers praise the version of Dogs, but I found it to be too close to the studio version to be anything special.<br />There are a number of winners on this CD. Shine on You Crazy Diamond is especially good. I like that he plays it as a complete piece, as Pink Floyd first did in 1975. The version ofMoney is refreshingly different. <br />In summary, this is a very good live DVD, but it could have been better. Too much of the material is too close to the studio version. Waters and Pink Floyd have played some of these songs much better in the past. The real treat would be getting Pink Floyd live material from the seventies. Before releasing Dark Side of the Moon, they had an experimental version called Eclipsed. After Dark Side of the Moon was released, they stretched it out to an hour in concert and played experimental versions of Sheep and Dogs called Raving and Drooling and You've Got To Be Crazy and were evolving Shine On You Crazy Diamond, with soaring keyboard solos.
B000066F6H|4.0|So this is the new face of rock? Or is it punk? Or maybe recycled 60's gen. Who punches Joe Strummer and he in turn topples Johnny Rotten? Well in this crazy mixed up genre world, the Hives have only one thing in mind. They want to kick your ass without messing up their finely crafted suits. And you should be proud. The Hives are not only a good rock band, they are the gems of the so called \\"garage rock\\" or \\"new alternative\\" era. With the rumored incestuous The White Stripes, the drunken masters of The Strokes, and the Nirvana-esque squeals of The Vines roaming the MTV airways, it's no wonder the Hives seem like an almost normal band. Sweden at it's best, the Hives' Howlin Pete and the gang spit and kick off at the mic, while dressed like attending a posh new-wave ball. And with 10 years of experience on the road, I'm surprised we didn't catch on sooner. With songs on Veni, Vidi, Vicious like \\"Main Offender\\" and \\"Die, Alright!\\", it's hard not to dance and jump around like you got a really big bug down your shorts. This record thrashes and dashes in under 30 minutes, but believe me, it's not as disappointing as it seems (for those thinking Weezer and the green album). One downfall, \\"Find Another Girl\\", will not destroy this record entirely. (It's a cover tune, just disregard.) So if you feel like getting smashed into your dresser for dancing in your skivvies to this better-than-the- rest band, by all means, do so. What's 4 or 5 bruises to excellent music that happens every 9 or 10 years?
B00006FDCD|3.0|....PSYCHE! Ok, enough of that. I, like many other people, agree on the fact that the book is much better than the movie, and to you, young reader, if you decide to go ahead and read the book, then i suggest you watch the film first. Why? Because you dont know what you are getting in when you start reading. In my case, i watched the film when i was about 11, and it scared the hell out of me. When i read the book, at age 18, i was somewhat prepared for the story i was getting into, it was still scary as hell, and made the movie seem like a 2 hour Bozo the clown special on how to scare the hell out of annoying kids. Therefore i recomend you first watch the film, so when you read the book, youll get seasures instead of a big heart attack. See ya!
0767903862|5.0|Bill Bryson is consisently one of the funniest writers around, particularly in In a Sunburned Country, as he stumbles his way around the great continent of Australia.  And he does almost literally go all around it, as well as taking several journeys into its dusty heart.  My only regret with this book is that I read it after coming back from Australia rather than before I began that particular journey.  I do not know that I would have changed any destinations, as the author is most hilarious and poignant when describing places into which one would probably never venture, but this book makes one appreciate the Australia that one encounters much more fully.  This book is recommended for those who have seen Australia, those who will see Australia and those who may never see Austarlia.  In short, this book will amuse and delight everyone, much like the wonderful country it documents.  During the day see something you can see no where else in the world and in the evening go to pub and relive the experience over a few pints, but first read this book.

If you do not own this album I order you to purchase it. This is an amazing records that everyone should own. Chuck Shuldiner is a God.<BR>              R.I.P. to the King!
B000069HKH|5.0|As a Brit I have lived with terrorism for 30 years (thank you to all those who gave the IRA money all those years).  So I come at The Rising with a more objective and less emotionally involved view than I'm sure many Americans do.  But this is a magnificent set of songs that stand on their own regardless of their obvious context and if there is no other artistic tribute to 9/11 (sorry Brit way round) then this will do for many years to come.
B000035Z1Z|4.0|In some ways this is your typical &quot;girl&quot; flic it has romance, comedy and a struggle to overcome a love obstacle.  Meg Ryan's performance is cute sometimes not believable and a little overboard but I find this typical of the comedic stlye.  However Kevin Kline shines as an actor in the movie.  In fact you can hardly tell it is him except on a few occasions when his grin comes through the character.  His character, Luc, a french thief adds a great deal to the movie.  He is definetly not the kind of person you would expect to see in this kind of romantic film giving this comedy a breath of fresh air from the now overdone Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks style of romantic comedy.  Well perfromed characters make this movie an enjoyable afternoon on the couch.
B00003CWL5|3.0|This movie starts off in a depressing vain as Lester Burnham comes to the realization that he is unsatisfied with the way his life has turned out.  This epiphany is the beginning of his midlife crisis.  He realizes that his wife cares more about her job and material things than about him.  In fact, he can't remember the last time they made love.  He hates his job.  And he doesn't know anything about his teenage daughter.  Worse - he finds himself attracted to his daughter's best friend.  He is determined to make some changes.  But is it too late?  <BR>Although Lester's story is the main theme of the movie, I found the lives of the other characters to be even more intriguing.  The wannabe-nympho Angela, the neurotic wife Carolyn, the rebellious, confused teen Jane, the supressed, dangerous, and strange Ricky and his overbearing father.  They are all great substories with hidden surprises.<BR>Excellent acting by Kevin Spacey, Annette Benning, Thora Birch, and the rest of the cast.  <BR>It's definitely not a feel good movie as it continues in its depressing vain all the way through to the end.  However, you will get a chuckle or two here and there.  All-in-all worth checking out.

Metallica demonstrates that they have the ability to write hard hitting, catchy songs that make you want to come back for more.  Metallica has an ability like no other to start a song well and carry it through to the finish.  They do not build you up and let down but instead they take a driving bass riff and a solid beat to create a powerful, well written tune.

This film was very well-done.  I loved how the most poignant scenes of the movie were shown in black and white, stripping down all of the polish and getting to the harshness of it all.  Some of what you see will stun you and some will appall you, but be that as it may, this is a very realistic film dealing with a very realistic problem in America.  Great acting by Edward Norton as the angry and anguished Derek.  Equally good work by Edward Furlong as Danny and Stacey Keach as Cameron.  And you'll just want to strangle Faruiza Balk, who's extremely believable performance in this film reminds us that there aren't just men heading the ranks of the White Supremist movement.
B000069HKH|4.0|No, Bruce Springsteen's latest album, \\"The Rising,\\"<BR>his first collection of original music since 1995, is<BR>NOT a time-warped, retread return to the wild,<BR>innocent, intense, wall of sound that defined his `70s<BR>and `80s glory days.  No, it is NOT a cousin to Side<BR>One of \\"The River,\\" his 1980 opus that carried a<BR>classic rock sound many long-time fans anticipated for<BR>this album - especially those who witnessed<BR>Springsteen's rock `n' roots revival in 1999-2000<BR>during the rejuvenated reunion tour with The E Street<BR>Band.  And the sooner that fact is accepted and this<BR>new album is given open ears and an open mind, one<BR>comes to realize \\"The Rising\\" is not the Springsteen<BR>album many wanted, but it may be the Springsteen album<BR>many needed.  This really should come as no surprise,<BR>as Springsteen historically has confounded commercial<BR>logic, rarely following up a  calculated commercial<BR>success with another.  <br />On \\"The Rising,\\" Springsteen no longer yelps about his<BR>own internal struggles or rages on far-reaching<BR>universal themes of injustice.  Instead, he<BR>compassionately examines the struggle of the<BR>individual, using a new, focused perspective while<BR>treading the familiar terrain of tragedy (\\"Empty<BR>Sky\\"), loss (\\"You're Missing\\"), grief (\\"Into The<BR>Fire\\"), isolation (\\"Lonesome Day\\"), insecurity<BR>(\\"Nothing Man\\"), hard love (\\"Worlds Apart\\"),<BR>redemption (\\"The Rising\\") and or course, the<BR>liberation of rock `n' roll (\\"Mary's Place\\"). <BR>Springsteen's rediscovered rock voice no longer growls<BR>in anger or frustration, it now whispers, questions<BR>and inspires.  <br />He's transformed from ranting tent revival preacher to<BR>consoling parish priest, interpreting the personal<BR>confessions, confusion and chaos associated with the<BR>aftermath of the September 11 terrorists attacks. <BR>Though the album is heavily influenced by this<BR>watershed moment in U.S. history, Springsteen is not<BR>heavy-handed inhis messages.  Unlike the recent<BR>overtly testosterone-pumped patriotic 9/11 anthems by<BR>Toby Keith, Charlie Daniels and even Neil Young,<BR>Springsteen offers a series of hymn-like songs<BR>concerned with the tragedy's humanistic effect.  He<BR>speaks from diverse viewpoints - victims, survivors,<BR>even the terrorists.  These angles are more difficult<BR>to capture, but they resonates with a lasting impact<BR>through Springsteen's uncanny ability to cut to the<BR>nerve of ordinary emotions, hopes and dreams.  And<BR>despite the 9/11 connection, these songs can also<BR>transcend the event and strike chords in our<BR>experience that have no connection with 9/11 at all. <BR>That's Springsteen true gift - imparting his songs<BR>with a versatility to be for the listeners what they<BR>need them to be.  <br />For all the differences in sound and presentation<BR>here, a close listen reveals hints of Springsteen's<BR>entire catalog.  The bright and hopeful \\"Counting On A<BR>Miracle\\" taps into the exuberance of \\"Hungry Heart,\\" <BR>\\"Lonesome Day\\" conveys the urgency of \\"Badlands,\\"<BR>\\"Nothing Man\\" echoes the introspection of the \\"Tunnel<BR>Of Love\\" album, \\"Further On (Up The Road)\\" the rocking<BR>hope of the \\"Born In The U.S.A.\\" album, \\"You're<BR>Missing\\" the longing lament that anchors \\"The River\\"<BR>album, \\"Paradise\\" sounds like it could have easily<BR>existed on \\"The Ghost Of Tom Joad,\\" \\"My City Of Ruins\\"<BR>touches the sentiments that dominated \\"Nebraska,\\" and<BR>the rollicking \\"Mary's Place\\" harks back in sound,<BR>vibe and content to \\"The Wild, The Innocent And The E<BR>Street Shuffle,\\" with an obvious dose of \\"Give The<BR>Girl A Kiss.\\"  <br />And despite these periodic similarities, \\"The Rising\\"<BR>really doesn't sound like any other Springsteen album.<BR>Producer Brendan O'Brien deserves the credit for this,<BR>by pushing Springsteen into new directions and<BR>experimentation.  And obviously, Springsteen was<BR>willing to be pushed and the risk pays off.   <br />Although, as solid as the E Street Band sounds<BR>throughout, this is more a \\"WITH The E Street Band\\"<BR>than a \\"AND The E Street Band\\" band.  Each member does<BR>get his or her moment to shine, but this is clearly a<BR>Springsteenian project.  At times, it hints at aspects<BR>of being a muscled version of previous stripped-down<BR>Springsteen albums, \\"Nebraska\\" and \\"The Ghost Of Tom<BR>Joad.\\"  <br />And even if there is some initial disappointment that<BR>Springsteen didn't make the expected rock record, the<BR>irony is, the best song here is \\"You're Missing,\\" a<BR>sorrowing, painfully poignant elegy of loss.  So<BR>perhaps, methinks this reviewer doth protest too much.<BR>   In the end, the album is a varied, challenging,<BR>affirming listen that snares snatches of Springsteen's<BR>past as it attempts to cut a road for his future.  <br />\\"The Rising\\" does not demand you be a Springsteen fan<BR>to enjoy it, but it does demand attention.  Those<BR>willing to invest the time and effort will be discover<BR>a beautiful reward.  Those not willing are missing out<BR>on the chance to hear one of rock's most important<BR>voices who somehow continues to find new ways to speak<BR>to us.  Bruce Springsteen is not that 25-year-old<BR>\\"Rosalita\\" rocker anymore, but his aging process is<BR>admirable - with grace and relevance.
B00005QXDD|5.0|I bought Tenacious D on the basis of one track that I listened to off my friend Mike's CD. It made me laugh myself sick and wake up my parents. A few months later, my faithful service as a customer to the BMG Music Service allowed me the chance to order it for free. So I did. I popped it in, and heard one lyric before I was laughing so hard I couldn't hear the rest of the song. I knew that I'd got my money's worth... well, you know what I mean... I did pay for shipping and handling, after all.... Bah... backed into a corner....<br />Well, needless to say, if you check my record, I don't review much music on this site. I mostly stick to movies and occasionally books. I could probably count on one hand all the albums I've reviewed, most recently James Newton Howard's score to &quot;Signs,&quot; which goes back to movies ultimately. I never stray too far from my chosen profession. But I decided to make the exception for Tenacious D. This is one of my absolute favorite albums. A collection of songs, satire, and humorous musings put together simply for the purpose of good old fashioned entertainment that makes you laugh. And if you understand who Lee is, and Dio is, you laugh even harder; you're in on the joke. But make no mistake about it: This music isn't for everyone. It's rude, crude, vulgar, profane, and totally hilarious. The satire is there for us to find, but you kinda have to look around a bit for it. It's sly, except for the last track, &quot;City Hall.&quot; But to simply call it satire masked in rude obscenities is to completely miss the intelligence of the album, which uses its satire very wisely and uses very well done music to communicate the humor in the lyrics even better. Anyone can write lyrics that are good, but without the music to accompany it, they suffer in the translation (i.e., the music of John Mayer. His two best songs had music co-written with a partner. Go figure...). Tenacious D has the entire package, the wide scope of instrumentation on &quot;Wonderboy&quot; being the best example. It's probably the best overall song on the album. But if you're looking for the most fun, listen to &quot;Tribute&quot; or &quot;Rock Your Socks,&quot; as well as the hilarious &quot;F**k Her Gently&quot; with its preceeding dialogue. The skits are just as funny as the music on the album, but Tenacious D is really all about the music, not just the &quot;Inward Singing.&quot; Not only do they make great music, but they also pay homage to great music. There's a lot more going on in this album than weird groin exercises and drive thru orders.<br />Bottom line: This is an album that puts out all the stops to entertain its audience. The more reserved ones among us will sigh at the profanity (it comes in great abundance) and mock the seemingly immature humor. The rest of us will look beyond the facade Tenacious D seems to put forth and recognize that Jack Black and Kyle Gass knew what they were doing when they made this album, and whether we like it or not, they're here to stay. And I for one, am glad.quot;Wonderboy&quot; being the best example. It's probably the best overall song on the album.

B00005LC1H|5.0|Anybody that has ever appreciated physical comedy must own this collection, even if you've never seen the show before. The quality is exceptional. Extra features are very nice. If you've enjoyed John Cleese in any other program or movie you must buy this collection.
0684800713|4.0|Hemingway is without a doubt my favorite fiction writer of the 20th century.  I have never read an author whose style matches his.  As his style, so his stories: unique and captivating.  This novel presented a look at life that has now passed away.  Why is this book good?  Because Hemingway describes feelings that occur in everyones lives.  Because Hemingway portrays so many personalities of society correctly.  This story is about life and circumstances mold our lives.<br />Cohn has been dominated most of his life.  He attempts to escape that domination and is crushed.  Boxing could not save him and neither could love.  Mike lives a blissful life without care of money or whether he has any.  He allows his temper to show, and it gets in the way of his happiness.  Brett is a women who cannot be satisfied.  She had a hard past, and cannot find happiness in the present.  Barnes is the one in control of himself.  He understands what he can and can't expect.  He is one who enjoys life.  Bill also understands life.  They understand not to be caught up in what others think.  They find people like themselves; people they can enjoy being around without making an effort.<br />The talent of Hemingway is exhibited in The Sun Also Rises.
B000002TQV|5.0|Believe me, it's hard to say something different about this CD than saying that this is a wonderful, fine record. Although it is possible -judging from some reviews posted here-, it's hard for me to imagine someone that doesn't like this. This CD is not a just a masterpiece: is a (mind) bending of every written / not written rules about music.
B000002LRX|3.0|Well I kind of just fell into purchasing this album at a local cd store before even hearing FNM's music. Which is probably why I didn't get too into it. This cd is alright, but definitly not my favorite kinda music. Little too mellow and 80's-ish for me. But if you're into the 80's punk style, this is what you want.
B00005YXZH|5.0|The previous review is obviously someone bitter from having to live in Morristown, NJ.  Believe the hype, this is the real thing.
B000069AUI|5.0|I just can't get this album out of my head.  This is great stuff.  Coldplay is gritty, emotional and downright groovin'.  Buy this album, crank it up, and go for a drive.  <br />My hopes were more that appeased by the quality of this album.  With the delivery of 'Rush of Blood', Coldplay stands alone in my book asthe elite band of the new century.  And if you saw them on Conan or Saturday Night Live, you know they deliver on stage as well. <br /> Now, to get tickets to a concert...
B000068QY7|4.0|For all of their occasionally stupid behavior and a couple of really weak albums, it's nice to have someone like the Gallagher brothers in a world full of personality and swagger-free bands. I can't say I'm -that- much of an Oasis fan, but this album is pretty damn good from start to finish except for the pointless instrumental bit near the end. The opener &quot;Hindu Times&quot; is excellent, although the main riff does sound a bit like U2's &quot;Even Better Than the Real Thing&quot;... but then again it's nice to see Oasis borrowing from some other band than the Beatles (hehe, only joking). For all it's cliche-ridden lyrics, &quot;Stop Crying Your Heart Out&quot; is an undeniable heart-tugging show-stopper, &quot;Better Man&quot; is a great dirty little number, and the rest of the songs are almost as strong and catchy. So, nothing particularly new, but then Oasis never pretended to reinvent the wheel and this album is full of great, solid rock music.
B00000AFDW|2.0|I made the mistake of buying this album having not heard any of the songs, and only being a faithful fan of Kiss. Yeah I think that new fans (people that started to listen to Kiss after the reunion) might enjoy this. It has all of the elements of classic Kiss, but it's missing something.<br />Do I think that the prime motivation for this was the money? <BR>Yes. Purely for cash. It's nice that the fans had something to go with the tour that was happening at the time, but this album doesn't age very well, mainly because this album wasn't very good in it's conception, and was executed poorly. <br />In retrospect, Kiss has made worse albums. &quot;Unmasked&quot; comes to mind. Peter Criss' solo album was weak, but at least an effort was made. &quot;Animalize&quot; was poor, but Kiss was playing catch-up, and was breaking in a new guitarist too.<br />Some of the tunes are catchy enough, but that wears off quickly. Based on the merit of the somewhat catchy songs, I rated this 2 stars. Other than that, not much here.

B000063DI9|5.0|This is a masterpiece, do not go through life missing out on the experience of this album.  My favourite song is Infinite Dreams, but the album, from start to finish, is a ride of sheer musical brilliance.
B00005OLY5|5.0|I can watch Willow over and over and never grow tired of it.  Its not just another story of good triumphing over evil despite the odds.  It is a story of redemption, and change.  Willow, a Nelwin (halfling), must overcome not only his size, but his fear and insecurities.  Madmartigan (Val Kilmer) must overcome a past of selfishness and thievery, to become a valient knight.  Sorsha (Joanne Whalley-Kilmer), must defy her mother, the evil queen, Bavmorda (Jean Marsh), and side with the forces of good.  <br />The story revolves around the baby, Elora Danan.  A prophecy fortels that Elora Danan will destroy Queen Bavmorda and bring peace to the world. So Bavmorda sets out to find the baby and destroy her sending the world into darkness forever.  Elora slips from her grasp, when a midwife takes pitty on the child and flees.  Before she is overcome by Bavmorda's peruit the midwife send the baby down the river on a small raft where she is found by Willow.  <br />Willow is given charge to return the child the Diakini, or tall people.  But along the way he is chosen to be the childs gaurdian on a much longer quest. Along the way he gains several companions, including two brownies (tiny fairies), a Sorceress who is stuck in rodent form, and of course Madmartigan.  The quest leads them to Tir Asleen, but the castle is under a curse.  The soldier from Nockmaar overcome them and take the baby.<br />Not giving up, our heros follow them to Nockmaar for the finally battle . . . But you have to see the movie to know how it ends :).  <br />Willow is an excellent movie for all ages.  Its clean, so parents do not have to worry about the content.  Its action pact and yet light hearted and silly.  Its not quiet Star Wars, but its still a winner.
B000065U1N|4.0|I saw this around the same time as a whole bunch of other war films, notably Windtalkers, We Were Soldiers, and Behind Enemy Lines and I can tell you that this is the best of the bunch. <BR>Black Hawk Down chronicles the true story of a covert operation in Somalia gone terribly wrong. The story happened back in 1993 and has a sad ending unfourtunately with Bill Clinton giving the order to withdraw the troops from Somalia. Any soldier who was there I believe would agree that it would have been best to stay and finish the mission. It probably was viewed as a sign of defeat on our part in a way that we retreated. Please get this and experience what war really is. The one negative thing I do have to say about this is that it doesn't give as good of a background story on the characters as the book did, but nevertheless, it portrays war accurately. Not as something glamorous. It is our duty to honor those who fight or fought in the military. <BR>War is hell, and in this it's accurately portrayed as such.
0064407667|5.0|Reverse psychology in its most freakish form.<BR>From the start of any of Lemony Snicket's books, on the back of his books, and throughout the pages, Snicket urges readers to put down the book and for the reader to pick up something happier. Who would have thought that a children's author would successfully convince children to keep reading his books by making his stories everything that kids, stereotypically, don't want to read.<BR>Spread like encyclopedic lice throughout his books are helpful explanations as to what some of the larger words he uses in his story mean. Soon our children will be using words that we aren't even sure as to what the meanings of them are.<BR>All in all Snicket's stories aren't really all the groundbreaking but are a delight to read simply for the author's commentary into the lives of the unfortunate Baudelaire children, and occasionally references to the author's own life.<BR>I strongly recommend these books for anyone who enjoys Roald Dahl's style of writing, both in his children's stories and his more adult short stories. Snicket grabs your attention and squeezes it until a passerby could easily mistaken it for an Italian zucchini.<BR>An instant classic for anyone who enjoys reading about other peoples woes.
B00006EXCC|5.0|Aftermath represents the first time Jagger/Richards wrote a whole album worth of songs on their own, and the result is a classic.  Their inexperience still shows on a few of the lesser tracks, but those results are still interesting.  And where they hit their stride the results are phenomenal.  <br />Unfortunately, in the original US release 2 classic tracks on the British version of Aftermath (Mother's Little Helper &amp; Out of Time),  plus 2 lesser tracks (What To Do &amp; Take It Or Leave It) were left off.  Instead, one classic track (Paint It Black) was added.  As great a song as Paint It Black is, it cannot make up for the losses.  For years, the only version of Aftermath avaiable on CD was this butchered US version.  But now - finally - the UK version is avaiable as well.<br />So what do we have?  Under My Thumb, Out of Time and Stupid Girl show the Stones at their misogynistic best.  Lady Jane and I Am Waiting are excellent examples of the Stones' softer side.  Mother's Little Helper well deserves its classic status.  Flight 505, Dotcha Bother Me and What To Do are solid, as is Goin' Home before it starts goin' on for about 5 minutes too long.<br />Of course, an ideal solution to the US/UK version issues would have been to merge the two - release the UK version with Paint It Black (which after all was recorded in the same sessions) as a bonus track.  A similar solution would have been ideal for the same situation regarding Between the Buttons.  But, still,  this a long overdue release, a great album, and the Stones' best before Beggar's Banquet.
B00005T7I1|5.0|Oh yes! One of the best comic book movies ever! Dick Tracy (Warren Beatty) is the detective in the long, yellow coat who nobody messes with! Ugly little Kid (Charlie Korsmo) disrespects the man and tells him to 'go suck an egg'! Ouch, that really hurt punk! After the pig Lips Manlis (Paul Sorvino, \\"Not da bath, not da bath!\\") suddenly disappears and his club is taken over by \\"Big Boy\\" Caprice (Al Pacino), Tracy becomes suspicious of illegal gambling. Breathless Mahoney (Madonna) is the club singer and she really does get in the way and interferes in Tracy's romance with Tess (Glenne Headly). Betrayal! Since Tracy's been having problems, the city goes rampant and \\"Big Boy\\" ruins it. He talks too much, tries to sing and wants Tracy. Good costume design and watch for Dustin Hoffman, James Caan, and Dick Van Dyke, yes! I watched this when I was about six and I still love it. You know Breathless can't sing, but that's all right (only flaw in the film). \\"Big Boy did it,\\" mumbled Mumbles, ha! Walnuts are bad for you, don't eat them. Don't play in cement. Be sure to give names to your children. Finally, how do you expect to see anything if your face is covered and you have no face? There's something to think about. Pretty much better than any 50's themed movie and almost a classic.
0345440900|2.0|Don't miss out on a lot of wonderful experiences with your baby! You will if you take Tracy Hogg's advice. <br />As a reviewer mentioned earlier, Hogg is dead-set against swings and bouncy chairs, and she also advocates that you not let baby fall asleep on your chest. This is one the most treasured moments in early motherhood! I had such comfort and joy when my baby fell asleep on my chest. <br />As a first-time mom, I read this book and was really depressed the rest of the day as I thought everything I was doing was wrong, according to Hogg. While you can pick up some tidbits from the book, I have a tough time recommending it to new moms.
1891252089|5.0|David Swenson's Ashtanga Yoga is the very best yoga book I have ever seen.  While there are other books out there that are good, this one is excellent.  The book is hard covered and seems to be very long wearing.  The spine is spiral bound and lays flat, which is excellent when you are trying to reference the book and go through your yoga practice at the same time.  The pictures are excellent and show as much as a book possibly could (of course a video or live instructor is always better).  Each pose is well described, with steps laid out clearly for getting into and out of the pose.  The book begins with a description of the principles of ashtanga yoga and then goes through the warm up, standing series, beginners series, and intermediate series.  It also includes several versions of a practice from 15 min, to 2 hours.  Even if you do not practice ashtanga yoga, this book is really an excellent reference for any yoga practicioner.  I highly recommend it.

Next thing I know, I'm in pure heaven! This movie has become one of my favorites, along with both soundtrack albums. It is a well-made, fast moving, one-of-a-kind film, truly unique. Highly recommend!!

B00003CY6M|2.0|I found it almost annoying that the premise of a movie would be that two people come together with great promise but the woman gets this feather headed idea to leave their whole future up to fate.  She is writing her name and address in a book she is going to sell to a New York City used books store so he can find her if the book ever finds its way into his hands.  His name is on currency that, if fate speaks, will find its way into her hands.  I like John Cusack a lot and Kate Beckinsale is a very good ingenue type.

B0000029AL|5.0|This album is undeniably one of favourite Aerosmith albums, partly because of its uniqueness when compared to the rest of the band's collection.  But mainly, it's short, raw, fast, bluesy and surprisingly full of musical range.  And while Tyler later refined his vocals, Perry developed easier-to-listen-to guitar riffs and the group became more accessible to the masses, this remains a gem of unpolished style.  A trait that's so hard to find, especially when it's as genuine as is evident here.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|THE BEATLES ONE should appeal to Beatles fans who have either everything (and want to keep it that way) or nothing.<br /><br />But BEATLES ONE is especially for the fans who have nothing by the band.  The single-CD THE BEATLES ONE costs less than the other choices in Beatles hits collections, PAST MASTERS VOLUME ONE/VOLUME TWO (two CDs) or THE BEATLES 1962-66/1976-70 \\"Red\\" and \\"Blue\\" albums (four CDs).<br /><br />Now, in terms of running time, THE BEATLES 1962-1970 \\"Red\\" and \\"Blue\\" albums could fit on two CDs. Yet for some reason that collection is spread out over four discs! Had it been properly released on two CDs, the \\"Red\\" and \\"Blue\\" albums would make THE BEATLES ONE unnecessary, as they have all the songs that appear on this new release.<br /><br />But then, even THE BEATLES 1962-1970 \\"Red\\" and \\"Blue\\" albums will disappoint fans hoping to hear \\"Twist and Shout,\\" \\"Birthday\\" or several other popular Beatles recordings not found on any hits collection. The Beatles' success seems too great for a best-of package.<br /><br />I don't want to sound complaining, but why was \\"Please Please Me\\" (the first #1 hit the Beatles had anywhere) left off THE BEATLES ONE? If there just wasn't room for one more song, I could have lived without \\"Love Me Do,\\" \\"From Me To You\\" or \\"Come Together\\" in favor of \\"Please Please Me,\\" the Beatles' first number one record.
B000067CPX|5.0|I am a really big fan of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and I have to say that this CD is a must-have for any chili peppers fan.  All of the songs on there are really good.  They have become really versatile with a few different musical styles, like the Mexican sounding \\"Cabron\\" to the ska sounding \\"On Mercury.\\"  I like the song \\"By the Way,\\" which receives a lot of radio airplay.  My favorite song on the album is \\"Can't Stop,\\" which is reminiscent to 70's funk.  I like the chord changes and the singing.  I also really like \\"Tear\\" because it has sort of a Beatle-esque sound like something off of \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" or \\"Abbey Road.\\"  I would highly recommend this CD to all chili peppers fans.
0060925000|5.0|Do not waste your time looking for Brahmpur on an Indian map: the city, simply, does not exists.<BR>Nevertheless, reading the pages of this timeless book, the accurate description will make it look much more alive than many a real one. Lata's search for a suitable boy is one of the few books able to capture the reader's attention ever since the very first lines. Set-up in post-independence India, far from the epic telling of Rushdie's \\"Midnight's Children\\"  or Vikram Chandra's excellent \\"Red Earth and Poring Rain\\" (published a few years later), this multi-layered novel, as it slowly unwraps the main character's adventures, offers a glimpse over a changing society, divided from the cultural and politic imprinting the British colonialism inevitably left and the slowly, progressive recovery of an independent identity, later leading to the splitting of Pakistan.<BR>Lata's journey across India, either real or virtual, and across her mind, the generation conflict between a mother and a daughter, sons of wealthy people dealing with poetry, handsome men with the only guild to belong to another religion, honest working guys, unfaithful wives, a restless political class, conflicts between old idols and progress are all part of this timeless fresco of a changing society.<BR>Using his visual skills, as well as a developed taste for sounds, as already shown in his debut novel (the award-winning \\"The Golden Gate\\", a novel in verse, on the heels of Puskin) and in the one which followed the present one (\\"An Equal Music\\") Seth masters this 1500 page long book literally hypnotising the reader, slowly and charmingly leading him to the very practical conclusion of a journey which will accompany you for the rest of your life.
B00000DRA9|3.0|Before I start, I should say the following: I am in the very first place a filmmusic lover. I collect and listen to filmscores of all sizes and styles. In the case of some movies though, the Very First Place is prepared for something else. Some overruling factor. Such is the case with this picture. Before I am a lover of this music, I am a lover of the book and a lover of the film itself. I hate the sequel, I hate the animated series, and I have assigned an exorcist to get the triquel out of my head. Over the absence of Ygramul the Many and over the \\"stormy\\" nature of the Nothing, I grief. I wished Gmork's conversation with Atreyu were more accurate and complete (as a side-note, that piece in the book counts as one of my all-time favourite reading scenes. The irony, the philosophy, the message - the power). Yet, the little kid did not mind all this when he saw the movie. In fact, the lad loved it. Years later, he still does.<br />When I read the costumer reviews on this score, I noticed a large amount of heaven-high praise for the composition and its role in the film-music world. My reaction was first one of wonder and then disbelief. As a collector and lover of moviemusic, my main motivation for buying this CD was nostalgia. The little kid, staring at the television-screen at Christmas or Easter - eyes popping out with marvel and mouth open with ensorcelled fascination. That is the true appeal of this recording: the memory and the melancholy. Not any supremacy on account of the music itself. Being a fantasy and science fiction aficionado, I have re-viewed this film at a later age several times. Hearing the music that was accompanying the images, I regarded it as too \\"modern\\", too \\"eighties\\" - \\"electropop\\". Not actually befitting the imagery nor the subtext. My lasting opinion is that this film would have done better with a full-blooded orchestral score. In consequence, I have always preferred to spend my budget on other scores before buying this one.<br />That said: the music is not that bad at all, if one listens in the right manner. Like watching a horror-film from the fifties and ignoring the bogus effects. I am unaware of the story behind needing two composers for this project, but I cannot say it improved the whole. Giorgio Morodor signed up for tracks 1-5 (including the title-song by Limahl, who incarnates my point on electropop in filmmusic), Klaus Doldinger for the rest (tracks 6-15).<br />Morodor's music is dominated by ambient electric guitar and floating synths. \\"Swamps Of Sadness\\" is spacey, mysterious - but strangely never sad or swampy. Atreyu's horse Artax goes to death, perhaps the most powerful scene in the movie - but hearing this music I cannot imagine that moment. Disconnected from the film, it is not bad music, but should one perceive it as thus? \\"Ivory Tower\\" feels like a wordless eighties pop song. \\"Ruined Landscape\\" is the only Morodor track that sparks up my imagination, and although I hate the beat and electric guitar, I can actually imagine flying over a crumpled scenery on the back of a luckdragon. Morodor's last track is his best though: \\"Sleepy Dragon\\". It is all but similar to tracks 2 and 4, but in this case, it matches the title seamlessly. Do not presume too easily that this is a compliment.<br />Luckily, Doldinger picks up from there. You might know him for composing the music for that German sub movie \\"Das Boot\\", which was also a Wolfgang Petersen film.<br />\\"Bastian's Happy Flight\\" is my favourite track of the album. It exuberant and powerful, it is the sort of music a film like this deserves. Too bad, it is synthesiser based, but when this theme occurs you can forgive and forget. (To the person who reviewed and complained this theme occurs several times throughout the score: that is what main themes are for, silly.) When it reappears in \\"Atreyu's Quest\\", it is noble and grand (strangely reminding me of Howard Shore's \\"The Fellowship Of The Ring\\"). When \\"Atreyu Meets Falkor\\" we fly along,and it closes the album with a truly \\"Happy Flight\\". That makes four times, which is not often at all in my opinion.<br />\\"Fantasia\\" is only fifty-five seconds long, but it is my second favourite track, because it makes me feel like reading a book and seeing the world inside beyond and between the ink and paper. It has that... transporting quality. After hearing \\"Theme Of Sadness\\", we have almost forgotten who Giorgio Morodor was. Beautiful woodwind, gorgeous strings. \\"The Auryn\\" does its job perfectly well: it grants us the wish for more enchanting music, and it takes away a memory. The final recollection of Mister Morodor is swept from our minds.<br />I wish Doldinger had composed ALL the music on this album. More than that, I would have loved a composer who did not use synthesisers...but I am starting to whine. As said, I bought this record for the small kid in my memory, who loved the movie so much that he went to the library and picked up the book (small font, four-hundred pages!). The azure and red letters - the way every chapter started with the next letter of the alphabet - the wonderfully trouble-free illustrations - the hoping that you would end up in Fantastica like Bastian, simply by reading that book. \\"Die Unendliche Geschichte\\" by Michael Ende still counts as one of my best childhood experiences. Let us not spoil that feeling by whining about bigger budgets for moviescores and by nagging about bad sequels.<br />Hmmm, one can hope, of course, for a remake with all the virtues of modern-day movie making. CGI- Falkor, Ivory Tower, Morla the Aged One and all the other creatures. Evil Ygramul the Many can be inserted. The rock chewer would not ride a tricycle. Oh well, with Fantasy booming these days, I will not be surprised to find myself in a theatre looking at an I-MAX screen, flying over the grassy fields of Atreyu's home-world.<br />However, that would be an entirely other story, and would best be told another time.<br />This one gets three stars for the music and two for the memory - minus one for Giorgio Morodor, minus one for Limahl.<br />Bram Janssen, The Netherlands.g, and it closes the album with a truly \\"Happy Flight\\".

B00005YJMX|5.0|I can't come up with enough superlatives for this film.  It is right at the top of the Kinski-Herzog ouevre.  Plus every other element is first rate as well.  Kinski plays the Bram Stoker Dracula character mostly by movement, shadow, light and gesture and he is brilliant.  He is otherworldy throughout and brings many layers to the vampire character, including melancholy blended with evil and feralness.  It is set in a town of canals with terrified townsfolk who believe the plague is upon them instead of a vampire.  But Lucy Harker, played by Isabelle Adjani, knows better and she sets out to vanquish the vampire.<br /><br />Her husband Jonathan, played by the wonderful Bruno Ganz, is foolish and under the vampire's thrall so she deals with him as well.  This is no Lucy that needs rescuing by all the males in the film. She's ready to take on everyone and indeed she does.  Adjani is deathly pale throughout but has never been more breathtakingly beautiful either.  The details of the period and place have been stunningly recreated throughout.  You are there for all intents and purposes.  You can also buy this as part of the newly released Herzog-Kinski boxed set.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

630018160X|5.0|As far as i'm concerned Bob Fosse is (was) the &quot;king&quot; of super high energy shows both on stage and film.  Coming from the stage i can tell you first hand that his way of dance is the most differcult to undertake, but beautiful Shirley MacLaine with all her high energy wisks you from one large production number after another.  If you enjoyed Broadway's &quot;Chicago&quot;, then you will also enjoy this Broadway musical transferred to film. My only complaint is i've been waiting for years to get this on DVD in it's letterbox form and 5.1 stereo sound. The one great thing about the VHS is that it is in 3-channel stereo and all the production numbers are in letterbox. After the numbers it goes back to full screen. In some respects that is better than nothing.  It's a wonderful cast and you'll see Shirley MacLaine at her VERY best.
0316666343|5.0|This book is both well conceived and well written. I like the way Alice Sebold presented the whole story within the framework of a fantasy, beginning in Heaven. To me, that's what makes &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; unique. And, if you can't get enough of &quot;heavenly&quot; presentations such as this book by Alice Sebold, maybe it's just me, but I think Norman Thomas Remick's book, &quot;West Point&quot;, is another such &quot;heavenly&quot; presentation to read after you finish &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot;.
B000067CPX|4.0|Well, the Chilis have all but abandoned their roots in the hedonistic funk of the 80's here, with almost all of the lecherous innuendo of old being thrown out of the door in favour of graceful melody. This, I should immediately point out, is not entirely a bad thing. The band have already proven themselves far more than funk-metal brawlers: Anthony Kiedis seems to have been born to sing on this album, with John Frusciantes haunting backing vocals adding a soulful twist to proceedings. Here, we have Beatles and even Beach Boys influences creeping in, resulting in the band churning out their most mature, polished and thoughtful work. The title track is a good representation of the entire record: low key funk with a chorus to die for, gorgeous vocal melodies which are utterly compelling and emotive.<br />Elsewhere, 'This is the place' and 'Dosed' would not have sounded out of place on 'Californication', while still following the new Chilis blueprint of more mellow, low key numbers giving way to a spectacular chorus.<br />The albums highlight however is undoubtedly the glorious 'Dont Forget Me', a true mastepiece which sees the simplest of guitar riffs from Frusciante overlaid with some incredible vocals from Kiedis and, predictably now, incredible chorus.<br />Later on, 'Cant Stop' lulls us with its fairly up-tempo introduction, before dropping us back so carefully into the new style Chilis sound that we do not even notice the transition.<br />'Midnight' and 'Tear' introduce more of the same while still keeping the massively high standard of songwriting in place, whilst 'Cabron' and 'On mercury' remind us of the Chilis genre sprawling talent, being as they are more bizzare sounding numbers.<br />Toward the end, the album seems to start sounding a bit similar, hence the loss of a star. Despite the genius of the songs included, a bit more diversity would not have been amiss. This aside, the record is a must buy if you like 'Californication', and while more established fans may grumble about 'selling out', the fact remains that you wont hear a more beautiful or triumphant album all year. As a long time Chilis fan, I was overjoyed by this release, no matter how far the band have come.<br />A must buy.mble about 'selling out', the fact remains that you wont hear a more beautiful or triumphant album all year.

B00006FXB6|5.0|I have never reviewed anything on amazon before, but this album is so astoundingly good, I feel like I must.  I like many types of music, from the Velvet Underground to  Funkadelic to Waylon Jennings, and from a purely musical standpoint, this album is of superior quality. As an added bonus, it rocks harder than almost anything I have eaver heard.  The music is easily as heavy as the hardest core bands such as Cannibal Corpse or Napalm Death, yet the tempo is slowed down significantly from those speedy, grinding type bands, and the result is something almost deleriously heavy.  My personal favorite is track 5 - A Song for the Dead.  If you like music - buy this album
B00005JKDR|5.0|I laughed, I cried (even though my 5 year old goddaughter got a kick out of me crying over it!).  Saw it twice in the theaters and I am 26 years old!  This is one of the best childrens movies I have seen in a long time.  So great and a must have!
0451167716|5.0|Mario Puzo really did his homework on this one.  Whether you like it or not, you will be caught sympathizing with the most powerful characters, and equally despising the enemies of &quot;the Don&quot;.  Don Vito Corleone is truly the most gifted godfather.  His wisdom and cunning intelligence is what marks his rise.  His son, Michael Corleone is the true heir to Donship, for this title is not lightly inherited, but a gift bestowed to the quick and the strong.  After reading this book, don't be surprised if you find yourself quoting: &quot;I'll make him an offer he can't refuse&quot;, or &quot;Nothing is better than a friend who underestimates your virtues, and an enemy who overestimates your faults&quot;.<BR>Truly a classic, though beware of the minor instances where the author ventures off to explain trivial things such as the Lucy Mancini problem.
B000069AUI|5.0|Let me first say that this review is written from the perspective of yet another Radiohead fanatic.  In another review, somebody said that AROBTTH is to Parachutes as Radiohead's OK Computer was to The Bends.  I had the EXACT same sentiment when I first listened to the album straight through, and was delighted to see someone else sharing my feelings.  In my opinion, this is no coincidence.  THIS IS THE ALBUM THAT WILL SOLIDIFY COLDPLAY IN MUSIC HISTORY.  I've always been looking for the new Radiohead (in artistry, not as a replacement, mind you!), with artists like Muse, Godspeed You Black Emperor, and Sigur Ros.  With A Rush of Blood to the Head, my search is over.  <br />Long live Coldplay.
0748662529|4.0|In Precious Ramotswe, Alexander McCall Smith creates a beguiling character. Precious  is a detective, the first female detective in Botswana and owner of the No 1 Ladies' Detective Agency. <br />Precious is a middle aged woman with a prominent posterior, whose self image and poetic praise of the simple things in life - like a dish of cooked pumpkin - are arresting to a reader surrounded by urban materialism and Western notions of attractiveness.<br />Through Precious, the reader is willingly enticed into a love affair with the landscape and values and people of Botswana.  <br />But Precious is far from a simple woman. The stories about the tragic life of her beloved father, her own disastrous marriage and move into the detective business are all enlivened by her capacity to find lessons from each painful experience.<br />It therefore comes as no surprise that she is a very successful detective. Helped along by her handy and hilarious &quot;how to&quot; text, her undeniable intellect and talent for nosiness, she is soon finding answers where others have not.<br />There are three books in this series and they are all wonderful. Each left me with a smile on my face and a desire to reread some of Precious' wry observations (favourites include those about the sad weaknesses of men and a number about the inferiority of neighbouring African countries) or her poetic descriptions of the world around her.<br />The mysteries - plus their solutions - are also satisfying.
0451204530|5.0|If you don't have trouble putting this book down, there's a problem!  It gripped me from the fly leaf!  It's a good old-fashioned thriller.  A man goes on a journey of self discovery because he's lost his memory while a disaster looms.  I beleive the book spans only a very short period of time and yet it keeps you literally on the edge of your seat!  I read the book and then listened to it on tape with my husband and I think it is equally entertaining either way.
0316666343|5.0|I picked this novel up at an airport yesterday having already heard something about it being good and just expecting something to pass the time on the plane. I would like to say that once picked up, I never put it down, but I found myself often having to stop to get control of my emotions (which was mostly silent tears running down my face). Afterall, I was in a crowded plane.<BR>I do not usually enjoy books that try to manipulate my emotions (a good example is that despicable Bridges of Madison County-ugh), but this book seemed to be so sincerely written and without guile. I was immediately transported to Suzie's heaven and could identify with her sorrow at missing out on life. Not many books are written from the perspective of the victim and there is not one of us alive today that can say for sure that heaven does not exist or that the dead don't live on in some way. Anyway, this is not a philopsophical review, I just wanted to say I found the book touching and unique. As for Suzies friends and family - I know of other families who have broken up after the death of a child and do not feel it is uncommon at all.
0767803434|4.0|The heroics of the president and the defeat of Communism and terrorism made this movie worth watching. Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman, even though they were strong enemies in the film, kept you on the edge of your seat with their heartpounding dramatics.<BR>This is a good film for bringing out even more patriotism and pride in our country and president, adding to the patriotism that was brought out by September 11th. I can compare this presidential film to THIRTEEN DAYS, the Cuban Missile Crisis film that came out last year (except that Air Force One wasn't based on a true story). I think Dubbya would be wise in watching both this film and Thirteen Days.
B000069AUI|4.0|This sophomore effort by Coldplay shows the music development of the band.  They still talk about heartache and hope.  These lyrics are complimented with infectious bass hooks and guitar riffs, interspersed with soft or loud piano and drum harmonies.  &quot;Parachutes&quot; gave a glimpse of what the band can do, much like &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; did with Radiohead.  And like Radiohead's &quot;The Bends,&quot; &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; shows Will, Gerry, Jon and Chris, with their different music stylings and influences, come together as four strong individuals with much to say while proving they have amazing talent.<br />From the loud and somewhat dischorded harmony of &quot;Politik&quot; progressing to the quiet and subtle &quot;Amsterdam,&quot; &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; shows Coldplay's musical range--we see the eastern influence in &quot;Daylight&quot; and the folk-country inspired &quot;Green Eyes&quot;--all the while maintaing their signature lyric ballad (&quot;Scientist,&quot; &quot;In My Place,&quot; &quot;Warning Sign&quot;).  <br />Why 4 stars?  Even with the strength of all of the songs, the album still gives a hint of their potential.  I'll leave the five stars until then.
B00000DCH9|3.0|It lacks the direct emotional and melodic appeal of 'Cold Spring Harbor' and it's not as good the albums he released after this but it's still not bad. Even Billy Joel's worst songs hold a level of craft that puts them across. A shame about the generic sounding production though.
B00006AFUR|5.0|All in all, the debut cd to the band 30 seconds to mars is one of the best cds that have come out in recent past.  With driving beats, insightful lyrics, its a fresh new sound in the pop sound that much of rock has taken on.  This is truly the one cd you should get if you buy just one this year (but who would do that??).  The songs Buddah for Mary, The Mission, Welcome to the Universe and Capricorn (the first single off the cd) truly stand out, but the whole cd is a true musical success.  30 seconds to mars is a must have cd for anyone who likes music.
0380789019|4.0|The storline is a bit bland to be honest. It feels a little too much like the entire setup of the story was forced to get the story to go to the places the author wanted them to go (London underground in this case). As for the characters, most of them are pretty well written, but i must say that I'm getting a little sick of books like this one where the protagonist is constantly whining about how much he doesn't know what he's doing, how lost he is, or how unqualified to be a hero he is. (This book's protagonist does all three for the entire duration of the book). The book comes very close to a really stupid ending, but the ending does in fact save this book. Overall this book is entertaining and the writing certainly keeps it flowing, but at the end of the day you don't feel like you've heard a new story, you feel like you've heard a pretty mundane story told, again.
B000069HKH|5.0|Like fine wine, Bruce Springsteen gets better with age.  His latest, &quot;The Rising&quot;, is a masterpiece.  The Boss has always been an impressive lyricist, but his newest effort is a magnificent work musically as well.  Having the E Street Band in your corner again makes it easy to be great I know, but Bruce's work on this cd is amazing.  Springsteen has mellowed a little and his work on this cd isn't as raw as some of his past efforts, but it works.  The entire cd is excellent with no weak songs in the group.  My personal favorites are &quot;Nothing Man&quot;, &quot;Empty Sky&quot; and &quot;Into the Fire&quot;, but all the others songs are top notch as well.  Do yourself a favor and check this one out.  Thanks for the effort Bruce.
B000050HTO|4.0|Bob Dylan has enough essential recordings to fill 3 CDs and more. But, lets face it, in 4 decades, Bob has had his up's and down's. This collection tries to pick some recordings from all periods of Bob's recording carrer, and unfortunately, Bob has had made some lousy albums and for CD 2 they did not picked the greatest songs and included some preety average songs, to represent some periods in his recording career. I am glad they included 'dont think twice', but I miss something like 'masters of war', 'with god on our side', 'its allright ma', 'a hard rain's a gonna fall', which show a side of Dylan that this collection fails to represent. On the other side, 'quinn the eskimo' and 'I'll be your baby tonight' although are some of his greatest hits, are pretty lame songs. But overall, CD 1 is as good as it can get. CD2 sounds sometimes like a collection of B-sides: 'if not for you', 'you aint going nowhere', 'forever young', 'jokerman', 'silvio', 'not dark yet' , 'everything is broken', could have traded places with 'license to kill', 'I believe in you', 'foot of pride', 'love sick', 'series of dreams' or include more stuff from the 60's, when he really pulled all the stops and changed the face of popular music forever: 'memphis blues again', 'just like tom thumbs blues', 'to ramona', 'hatie carrol', etc.

B00005JL3A|4.0|I wasn't expecting to much from this flick, Boy was I wrong the story was excellent and the way they used the monsters and zombie's was great, they didn't try to just fill the movie with blood and gore, the story they told was well thought out.  The ending awesome, left me wanting more and I really hope they make a second part.  It's a combination of all 4 video games and mixes really well.  Unlike video games turned movie's ( Street Fighter, Mortal Comabt and Tomb Raider) of the past this one is a keeper.
B00003CXZ1|3.0|Tomb Raider, considered in and of itself, is an entertaining action film with a confusing story and one dimensional characters.  It maintains, however, absolutely no allegiance to the video game which gave it birth. Director Simon West admitted that he wanted to distance the film from the game because Lara Croft is an interesting person all by herself, but this is way beside the point.  The point is, this is a Tomb Raider movie, so it should have remained loyal to the game.  When the costume designer was asked why Angelina Jolie was not sporting Lara's traditional duds, she said that was Angelina's decision, because she doesn't like bright colors.  Excuse me, but since when do the capricious whims of slightly crazy actresses determine how a multi million dollar license is treated on film?  I was very disheartened at how the game was completely disrespected in this movie, not only in the outfits, but in little things like names and character histories.   If, however, you're just looking for a good action flick with a very attractive female lead role, then Tomb Raider will fit your bill.
B00005ASHM|3.0|\\"Pet Sounds was a whale of an album during its own day, but it has been slowly surpassed over the past 40 years.  When \\"Pet Sounds\\" was released in 1966, it was indeed a musical masterstroke, an album whose lush orchestration forever changed the concept of pop music.  Yet there have been so many records released since that time that have gradually usurped this album's status as the definitive lush-pop album. \\"Dark Side of the Moon,\\" \\"Loveless,\\" \\"Disintegration,\\" \\"Daydream Nation\\"...all these albums display a level of invention and sound density that makes \\"Pet Sounds\\"  sound very dated, much more so than, say, \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" or \\"Are You Experienced,\\" two albums released at nearly the same time as this one.  And I know that some will say that those albums wouldn't have been possible without \\"Pet Sounds\\", but (to paraphase a Lou Reed lyric), 'what comes is often better than what came before.'    While its sonic marvels have dulled over time, \\"Pet Sounds\\" still boasts some rich melodies and beautiful harmonies, as well as some heartfelt love songs.  It is a very good album, one that often borders on perfection--I really like \\"Caroline No\\" and \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice,\\" but I can't give this collection of songs more than three stars because its style of pop music is now pass and clich, and there is no reason to elevate this particular album above so many others that are more innovative and timeless.  I think many critics canonize \\"Pet Sounds\\" just so they can gleefully (and wrongly) proclaim that there is an album better than those of The Beatles--\\"Pet Sounds\\" is a good pop album on its own terms, but it is not the 'greatest album of all time' that many believe it to be.
B00000IQC8|4.0|This is an excellent movie to which I would've given 5 stars to.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the DVD transfer.  The picture quality is not great.  They could've used digital filters to remove some of the graininess of the video.  And the audio suffers from a bad sync problem.  I've played it on a Sony DVP-NS500V, Intervideo's WinDVD 4, and PowerDVD XP 4.0.  The only player that played it without a sound-sync problem was PowerDVD.  It's not the fault of the players, but the disc itself.  This disc is the only one that played with sync problems on the other two players.
0316666343|2.0|I admit I'm one of those people who bought \\"The Lovely Bones\\" mainly from hearing all the great reviews. Well, I feel this book does not live up to the hype.<br />\\"The Lovely Bones\\" started off promising, but went downhill from there. The book jumped from 1973 to 10 years later too quickly. I agree with A Reader from Massachusetts who stated there seemed to be no mourning over the loss of Susie except for the Dad.<br />There were too many extra characters in this book that where unnecessary, especially Ruth. I felt she had no reason to be in the story at all. Who cares about Ray's Mom? What was the point of her character? Hal, Samuel's brother is another unnecessary character. I found it hard to believe a guy like Hal would be wasting his time baking with Susie's grandmother. Ms. Seabold should have axed these extra characters and spent more time developing Buckley.<br />I was really bothered by the end where Susie takes over Ruth's body. To me, that sequence just didn't seem to fit into this book.<br />I was expecting something totally different when I started this book. \\"The Lovely Bones\\" wasn't the worst book I ever read, but it certainly was a disappointment.
0393307050|3.0|Set in the year 1800 this story tells the tale of the adventures of newly promoted British naval captain Jack Aubrey and his vessel \\"Sophie\\". <br />This book was really hard to read and enjoy. The historical background is not explained in the book so it assumes the reader has a prior knowledge of the politics and state of European history at that time.  The English is difficult to understand with lots of most uncommon words, and other words which may then have been current but are certainly no longer.  The nautical terms are just as technical with a specialist knowledge needed to comprehend their meaning.  The one concession to the reader is a drawing amongst the author's notes showing the 21 sails of a square rigged ship with each one's name. If I had written this book I would have included more reader's aids including a map, maybe a list of key dates of historical events of that period and a list of definitions of some of those rare words. Certainly my regular contemporary dictionary was not of much help in that regard.  The map would have helped as at one stage the Sophie is sailing from Minorca to Alexandria but seems to be on a west by north west heading, surely the wrong way. <br />There are plenty of battles between various ships throughout the book.  There are French, Spanish and Italian warships but it only becomes apparent towards the final chapters who is fighting who. The battle scenes are well described with almost the equivalent of \\"hand to hand\\" fighting as the ships get close enough to shoot their canons and even muskets at each other. The great friendship between Captain Jack Aubrey and his ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin is a fine thread running the book which, along with the battles scenes, make the story just that little bit more readable.<br />I acknowledge that author Patrick O'Brian has rightly been acclaimed and awarded for his series of nearly 20 naval novels of the Napoleonic Wars. As one critic wrote \\"His depiction of the detail of life aboard a Nelsonic man-of-war, of weapons, food, conversation and ambience, of the landscape and of the sea is masterly. O'Brian's  portrayal of each of these is faultless and the sense of period throughout is acute\\". This is clearly the case, but the novel is hard work and I felt a great deal of relief when I eventually reached the final page. I also find Shakespeare most difficult to read and therefore seek out other writers for my entertainment. O'Brian falls into the same category so that has to be a fair comment on his literary skills.
B00005A46T|1.0|I don't know how anyone can bare to listen to this. You can't even figure out the lyrics and there is no cordination in the music. All I hear is a bunch of screaming, wailing people over junk guitar which plays one chord or at least it seems that way. Do yourself a favour and forget this album and go and listen to some true music such as Metallica, Ozzy, Alice In Chains, Creed or if you please Nirvana.

B000059ZT4|5.0|Full marks for going back to the original sleeve design (although strictly speaking the spine should read &quot;The Wailers&quot;, *not* &quot;Bob Marley &amp;...&quot;), and for the superb remastering job.  But the real joy here is in hearing the Jamaicam mix of the album, which, like many, I prefer.  And this is not me being a purist or anything as I was barely familiar with the album before hearing this version (which I bought for my brother's birthday).  So I played it all through with an open mind.  And the Jamaican disc is the one for me.<br />The maddest part is that the 2 songs Blackwell passed on are my favourite 2 songs!  If I'd have been Chris Blackwell, history would have been different I tell ya!  High Tide or Low Tide is especially beautiful - those harmony vocals are top drawer stuff.<br />Yes, this Deluxe double CD is about 3 times the price of the regular CD (over here in England anyway), but if you're a Marley fan, you gotta hear the Jamaican mix.  Really.  Simple as that.

B00005OB0A|5.0|Although I am quite partial to the disco sound of her previous album \\"Light Years,\\" Kylie Minogue does it again with this kick-butt album.  The single \\"Can't get you out of my Head,\\" is not even one of the better tracks.  Watch out for \\"love affair\\" and \\"fragile.\\"  These are outstanding examples of why Kylie Minogue is as great as she is.  Each album since 1994's \\"Kylie Minogue\\" has a individual sound and that is a rare phenomena in mainstream pop music today.  The remix of \\"Butterfly\\" is also wonderful.
630025111X|5.0|Maybe the best and most accurate of all the western movies. Very sad ending but very true to the time and place. This is one that will haunt you for a long time especially if you grew up in ranching country. The movie varies quite a bit from the book by Jack Shaefer but maintains the book's feeling well. The book's action takes place mostly in New Mexico.
2070513289|1.0|Someone please shoot me in the face, am i the only one who didn't enjoy this book. i read it last year in my 4th year honors french class, now up until the semester when we read this book, i had been a fairly good french student, i have family who live in provence, i visit them often and i had never made a B in french until the semester of junior year when we read \\"le petit prince\\" needless to say i made a C that semester. this was the dumbest thing i've ever laid eyes on...well besides a few girls i know. but who gives a merde about some little kid going from planet to planet asking a bunch of dumb questions, and be in love with a rose. im (upset), cause this made me totally lose intrest in french, and now that im a senior and in AP french...im not trying at all, this book is awful, maybe i should read it in english.......nah. oh well, c'est la vie

0767849493|5.0|I really enjoyed this film and found it very thought provoking. I am a Catholic and DID NOT find this film at all offensive.  The first time I watched this movie, I was a little put off by the excessive swearing but wasn't so bothered the 2nd time around.  <br />I found it very, very funny but also very thought provoking.
0786867973|4.0|I read this book from cover to cover in a single, lazy Saturday. The pictures are beautiful (like the delicate, classy cupcake on the cover)- that's part of what intrigued me to pick up the book in the first place. I appreciate Nigella's easy-going style and affinity for comfort foods. Like some other reviewers have noted - she's NOT Martha Stewart and that's just the way we like it!  <BR>Now, onto my \\"mixed feelings\\". I made two recipes out of this book before I had to return it to the friend I borrrowed it from. The snickerdoodles turned out like little rounds of dry sand that literally parched the mouth upon eating. I wasn't impressed, and I folled the recipe word for word. My second recipe, the lemon gems, turned out a bit better. Although the cooking time was much shorter than the suggested 20-25 minutes. The first batch was smouldering by the time my 20 min timer went off. Perhaps my oven isn't a true, even heat - but I use an oven thermometer just to make sure. <BR>I wish I had more time to make other foods out of this book, because I was slightly disappointed by the results of the two cookies I did make.
B000001EAQ|4.0|It's now been five plus years since the release of Pop, and one thing remains the same,U2. The lack of praise for this album is understandable, but only an impatient response would fail to sense, feel, even see the genius behind it. Pop for myself was an album that grew on me, i nearly detested it at the beginning, stating, &quot;this isn't U2&quot;. No, so what is? What is U2? Change. U2 has been able to trascend the ropes of rock and roll, and shift itself into a categorie all to its own. I'm not saying it will take five years for you to like this album, more like five months. This is my favorite album from U2. It's not an especially uplifting piece, but it makes you want to feel active in the world. My favorite track has changed numerous times, but currently its, &quot;If You Wear That Velvet Dress&quot;. This song clinches U2 for me, everything in one song. This album isn't a four its a four 1/2, definately an essential in the progression of U2.
B000069AUI|5.0|As a person who just saw the video of \\"trouble\\" and bought<BR>the cd. The first one was great! So then I go to their site<BR>and see that a second cd was to come out,I was a bit leary,<BR>But THIS NEW CD IS WONDERFUL!!! I like this band, with their<BR>dynamics(soft and low). The first song starts out with this<BR>rocking beat,then followed by the singers amazing voice.<BR>His voice has or I think even sounds better. This is one of those<BR>CD's that,when you want to  listen to something \\"different\\"<br />THIS IS IT!!! A great CD!!!
B00005QXXO|4.0|I really love this work, this is the way these songs were meant to be heard in the first place.  I really enjoy radiohead albums, but the live stuff is really just much more vibrant and full of character.  The only reason that I don't give it full marks is that it is a little short.  Cds can hold well over an hour of music, yet 40 min cds are still released.  What gives guys?
B00005JLEX|5.0|It's all been said before: millions of people are waiting, ready to draw their credit cards !<BR>Why THE most popular series in this part of the galaxy is still not released just boggles the mind.<BR>We're all dedicated to the mantra \\"serenity now\\" but this is getting ridiculous, especially when you think of all the -shall we say - lesser DVD releases that pop up every day.<BR>Why then isn't the entire Seinfeld series released on DVD?<BR>Anyway, it's probably a lawyer thing we wouldn't understand.
0780631684|5.0|This movie is a great thriller,I wouldn't consider it a horror film since it makes you pop out of your seat so I'll consider it a thriller,so it's not scary.It has got a great plot and great actors,it's got some great seens and some great death seens and a surprise ending.Great special effectes make this movie a succes.See it if you like horror movies or thrillers.O,just SEE IT!

B00000JCOV|5.0|not too many really heavy albums impress me the first time I listen to them. but this one though, got me hooked. the masks, and the stage antics, they are forgettable. But Corey Taylors voice is not. Wait And bleed pulled me in and so I bought the albumwhen it came out three or four years ago. I was ultimately pleased with the product. songs like No Life, and Liberate b/c personal favorites. I listend to it so much that i finally could pinpoint the only songs I didn't like. Tattered and Torn is where it gets weird and i don't like that one at all. and only prosthetics (which isn't bad, but isn't my favorite). aside from that i love the whole album. that doesn't happen to often.<br />but be warned, their sophomore set is [not as good].
B00000FC5H|5.0|Like another reviewer has posted, EWF's Greatest Hits is just that...all their hits in one cohesive cd.<br />This set is great for people who are re-discovering EWF like myself - who really only heard their popular hits on the radio, but never bothered to buy a single EWF CD/Album.<br />What is neat about this set when I bought it is that with some of the titles, I never knew... until I heard the song and said...&quot;oh I know this one!... &quot;didn't know they did this song&quot;!<br />It ended up I knew about 12 of the 17 track on here already, which was great!<br />Bottom line: Great funky tunes, R&amp;B classics, as well as nice soulful ballads. That's what EWF is and will always be... a shining star.<br />Get it!
B00005QG9J|3.0|I don't think too fondly of Morning View. I think it lacks the credibility of SCIENCE. Its as good as Make Yourself, which doesn't say too much.<br />Nice to Know you is a great track. And when I heard this track come slamming in,I thought I was in store for another good installation in the Incubus series. But I was wrong.<br />Circles is a decent song but it doesn't have anything that will make it stand out. And nothing about it is remotely memorable.<br />Wish you were here - this song is [bad]. Its another \\"Drive\\" just to make girls sing along with the music. Which is a waste of time. Brandon and the guys need to go back to the basics. They need to slam the music out with mroe feeling and not be so concerned with making the in-crowd happy.<br />Just a Phase - this is a good track but it takes a long time to get into it. and its not really that full of lyrics.<br />11 am - this is one of the best tracks on the CD. I enjoy this song because while it may be slow and soft paced, it reaches out and captures the listener. Its not really a love song b/c no one quite understands it when they hear it the first time. But a strong track nonetheless.<br />now heres where it gets bad. from here on out the track quality is poor. its like during the \\"Morning View sessions\\" the crew just sat on their ... and talked about ... \\"Warning\\" really has no feeling in it until you see the video. its a good song but its just anotehr one written to help Brando and co get ...<br />the CD winds down with Under My Umbrella which in my opinion is the best track. They pick up the pace and have great lyrics for this one. Aqueous Transmission is something new. Its a good closing song. I like this part of the CD the most. It relaxes you.<br />but it doesn't make up for hte horrible parts inbetween. If you want good Incubus, look to Science or even Make Yourself.<br />not this one though. sorry guys.
B00005UJOJ|5.0|This japanese reissue is a must have ,they have vastly improved upon the old Castle remasters.All of these Japan mini lp sleeve remasters feature a prescence and depth and warmth that you will never had heard on any Sabbath cd (or vynil) before. The live sound of the bass &amp; drums &amp; guitars are like being there in the studio with them.As far as musical content goes this is where heavy rock has it's foundations,never equaled or surpassed,a textbook of riffs for the next  generations of pretenders to the throne
B000003TAR|5.0|this album solidified the incredible musician that Kurt was. Listen to this record with an open heart and an open mind. All Apologies rings in my head hours after the CD has stopped. get this record. its their best, second only to their Unplugged CD.<br />bye Kurt, you're missed.
B00005K9QP|5.0|I will comment on the sound of this reissue,others have rightly proclaimed this as probably Clapton's best (tied with Layla) playing and I do agree,and now this can be heard so much better on this remaster.The vocals and guitar and John McVies bass have so much more prescence, and the depth of the soundstage is vastly improved over all previous versions I have owned,that it does not sound like a record anymore,on a good systemn this is the nearest thing to having been there in the studio with them in 1966.Highest recommendation to those who care about sound quality
B000000993|5.0|I bought this one last, a huge mistake. Undertow is usually the one that people go for when they say Tool. That or Lateralus. But to me Aenima is their greatest album. Followed by Opiate. Thats not to take anything away from this album. Sober is definitely the key track followed by Prison Sex. But to me the heart of the album lies at the end. Disgustipated. Many would say \\"oh this is boring\\". it is unless you actually listen to it. True the \\"cries of the carrots\\" are not your concern. But what Maynard wants is to get you to say something about it. whether it be bad or good. A long track that takes a while to get to. But the reoccuring \\"This is necessary, life feeds on life\\" line just doesn't get boring. Especially when it becomes louder and louder each time till the climax where it just ends.<br />A very good album. I recommend it first before you move up hte ladder. actually get Opiate first.<br />A must have for anyone that says they love music.
0446364495|5.0|I've read a lot of romances but this beats them all, by far.  Get ready to read until you finish and have a big box of Puffs (w/lotion) nearby.  I thought of nearly nothing else for several hours after reading it.  I love it, I love it, I love it!
B00005QXDD|4.0|This album is truly a great achievment for monkey boys Kyle and Jack. Tribute is indeed the &quot;best song in the world&quot; Even though it's mostly one chord! If you want a bundle of laughs and an o.k. piece of music then this is the album for you but if messing about with music is not your thing then avoid!
B0000027RL|5.0|Not many albums have enough intelligence and power to survive ten years of listening. It doesn't matter now what kind of a mass cultural phenomenon Pearl Jam once was, or whether you like the rougher and sometimes experimental material the band has released since. This album just doesn't fade. It's not really comparable to Nirvana, who were influenced by the Sex Pistols and the Pixies. On Ten Pearl Jam hardly borrows from punk at all. Every song on Ten combines furious vocals of incredible range with melodic grunge guitar, meaning slowed-down metal guitar with a lot of sonic polish. The songs capture Eddie Vedder at moments of self-doubt and rage, and for all fifty minutes the force of the music and the skill of the band transform his personal griefs into anthems that give comfort and catharsis.
B000069AUI|5.0|It seems the norm that whenever a good band releases a good album, their follow-up manages to be awful, while the band is happy that they have our money, yet are content with their 'musical creativy' and evolution as a band. Coldplay, nonetheless, manages to release another good album, possibly elevating their 'good' status to GREAT!<br />The songs on this album are filled with tremendous emotion one can feel, primarily acheived through the vocals and melodies. Who says a piano doesn't belong in rock music? At least it's something fresh in this corporate pop world. Making political assertions regarding fair trade in the aptly titled \\"Politik\\" (Humm, 'Cold' War imagery?, excuse the pun), socially-conscious songs are counter-balanced by personal songs like \\"In My Place\\" and \\"Scientist\\".<br />The songs here vary in tempos, ie musical speed, but the group's essence reamins the same: serious music by MUSICIANS (not MTV-aspiring acts). A Rush of Blood to the Head is seemingly a continuation to Parachutes, much like Radiohead's Amnesiac was to Kid A, but the musical evolution is evident, as in Radiohead despite sounding similar (you just have to look for it). A band like COldplay is needed nowadays: guys that show integrity in what they do.

0783225482|5.0|...<BR>Death Bcomes Her is NOT a wonderfully symbolic or brilliantly touching film.  But it is terribley enjoyable.  I could watch this dark and glamorous comedy about life, death, and immortality again and again and never become the least bit tired with the wonderfully placed articles that go with it: the beautifully relentless score, the wonderful comedic timing, or the impecable star power.<BR>This movie is worth seeing many times to come, so buy it, unless you're stuck in that dank dungeon.
B00006FXB6|5.0|I was lucky enough to receive a pre-release copy of &quot;Deaf&quot; and was literally blown away upon first listen. I have yet to be able to put this album on the shelf and for what it's worth, I save 5 star ratings for only a couple of albums each year and this is one of those albums (so much so, that I purchased the Limited Editin w/DVD). Dave Grohl was a brilliant addition on the drums.  He gels the band and infuses an incredible amount of energy into the production. The songs on &quot;Deaf&quot; are thoughtful, melodic, and of course heavy.  The cheezy DJ gags between tracks are authentically hilarious!<br />While &quot;R&quot; was a great album for the Queens, it didn't feel as if they'd quite hit their stride. Well, they have now. Hopefully this album will assist them in finally shedding the &quot;Stoner Rock&quot; moniker. Understanding thier lineage, the Queens just don't fit that bill any longer.<br />On to the Bonus DVD: I assumed that when purchasing the Limited Edition w/Bonus DVD that there might be an interview or a music video on the DVD but to my pleasant surprise there was a large assortment of ameteur behind the scenes studio and live out-takes.  Also included are a number of new live performances from the Troubadour in Los Angeles as well as some older live tidbits.  I highly recommend snagging the Limited Edition of &quot;Deaf&quot;.  The album is more than worth it and the included DVD is just extra frosting on an already tasty cake!
B00000IMCU|5.0|When you think about what the best horror movies of all time are a few should pop into your head. Carpenters Halloween, Pyscho, Friday The 13Th, and George A. Romeros Dead Series. This (next to Night Of The Living Dead, which cant be beaten) is the best zombie movie of all time. Writer/Director George A. Romero does an exelent job of creating a realistic, chilling zombie masterpiece. Other zombie movies pale in comparison to this one. This is fun to watch, and you feel like you become part of the story. The movie takes place after the dead have taken over earth (meaning this takes place pretty soon after NOTLD) and it is crazy. A team of 4 people manage to escape the zombies in a helecopter. They eventually find a shopping mall to stay in which they think is safe... or is it? This movie is chilling and the gore is great. They just dont make em' like this anymore. Hats off to Mr. Romero for this astonishing piece of horror art. You must see this movie if you havnt. You will not regret it. A waring: this movie does take a little bit for the plott to develop but once it does, you are hooked. Watch NOTLD then this.<BR>Regards,<BR>Dylan
B000069AUI|5.0|I bought this cd because i've loved the two singles from their first album &quot;parachutes&quot; and the first single from this one (IN MY PLACE).I just thought that i couldn't go wrong and i was not dissapointed.Musically and vocally,this is a really &quot;tight&quot; album of songs.It flows beautifully from beginning to end and begs for repeated listenings.My favorites cuts are IN MY PLACE,THE SCIENTIST,CLOCKS and WARNING SIGN.Any lover of great music will truly appreciate this recording.
0393312836|5.0|I read this book in high school on the suggestion of a friend. I have grown up a little since then and I have read a lot of great books since but through them all Clockwork Orange still would have to be my favorite. It is violent, yes, which is probably why I liked it so much in high school, but it has a sense of humor also. Probably the first dark comedy I've read.  <br />To tell the truth I had to read the first couple of pages over after figuring out the clever russian/cockney slang Burgess uses. I had never read a book before where the author trusts the reader enough to make up his own language, which what makes this book stand out in my mind. I have not come across another book since that lulls me into the story like Clockwork Orange has.<br />I don't want to get into a movie review but I feel both the movie and book are great which doesn't happen very often. If you like a happier ending with a brighter outlook you have the book and if want a darker ending you have the movie.<br />Through all the books I've read throughout the years this one is my favorite.
B000002J27|5.0|After Peter Gabriel said goodbye to Genesis they went through a brief hiatus without a lead singer only to have Phil Collins take over and fill in Peters shoes. Trick Of The Tail is Genesis' first album under the Phil Collins lead vocal line-up. This 1976 release is absolute one of the most creative albums under the Genesis catalog. Phils songwriting while a bit silly is really good and Steve Hacketts guitar playing on here is awesome. Not much radio friendly music is present on here. The only track in my opinion that sounds radio friendly is the title track(Track 7) but that's just because it clocks in at 4:36 long. The album cover sets the general mood of this album. The remastering quality is great. I once had this on record and to have this remastered on CD is almost like a sweater or towel being lifted off the speakers. In fact I must say that this CD was well ahead of it's time. I just love the morphing melodic structure of Squonk. I almost couldn't even tell if that was Peter Gabriel or Phil Collins at first when hearing this album because their voices were quite similar at the time. A lot easier to get into than the greyness of Wind &amp; Wuthering Trick Of The Tail is definately an essential recording. Invisible Touch, take a back seat for now. The music is well crafted and has firmer production that some of Wind &amp; Wuthering lacks sometimes.<br />My favorite songs are the rich and colorful Squonk, the title track and the instrumental Los Endos.<br />I'm probably among the minority who almost loves just about the entire Genesis all the way from the abstract prog-rock albums Nursery Cryme &amp; Foxtrot, to the Trick Of Tail through We Can't Dance and the incredibly powerful Calling All Stations.<br />Go and buy this CD. It's truly an essential album.
B000003TA4|5.0|This is probably one of the greatest CDS of all time. First off, lets just say the way this cd flows into eachother is amazing. Its one of the only cds where I can pop it in and listen to it without skipping a track. I guess from here I'll rate each song one by one.<br />Smells Like Teen Spirit - This song is massivley overrated. Still good, but overplayed and overrated. I still like it, but I usually dont enjoy it as much as the others.<br />In Bloom - Great song. Its got a heavy dark feeling to it. The harmonies are sick, amazing song,<br />Come as you Are - This song is a real mellow song. Dark, creepy, this song has a weird waterish feeling to it. This is something that would make Hendrix proud--Making a unique noise and feeling with a guitar.<br />Breed - Energy packed, high octane, mosh pit song. <br />Lithium - My personal favorite Nirvana song. Amazing lyrics about a man who starts questioning his religion, this has a great intro and verse, and Kurts scream in the chorus is great.<br />Polly - Acoustic song. Very mellow, soft, haunting, but not in that Come as you Are way. Simplistic but genius tune. An anti rape song, about a girl that was kidnapped and tortured when she was 14 in Kurt's hometown.<br />Territorial Pissings - Awesome song! Energy, mosh pitting, makes you want to jump around and smash a guitar! One of my favs.<br />Drain you - My second favorite. The wavy rythm makes this song great. I like the way the bass and the guitar compliment eachother in this song.<br />Lounge Act - I hated this song at first, but I need to say it grew on me. The bass line is very good, and the guitar work seems like icing on a cake, as the bass holds the tune. Good song.<br />Stay Away - Starts with an amazing Dave Grohl drumroll, and a Novoselic bass line, and blasts out into an awesome piece of guitarwork. Kurt screaming Stay Away makes you want to scream with him. This song is about all the jocks that picked on kurt as a kid and the whole poseur grunge scene to \\"stay away\\".<br />On a Plain - The \\"happiest\\" or lightest song on the album I liked this song from the start. Great tune, nice drumming, and an all around good song.<br />Something in the Way - Chilling, soft, acoustic song. 2 chords. Very relaxing in a creepy way.<br />Well, folks, there you have it. Thats a pretty accurate description of each song, If any of these sound good, check out the samples. Guaranteed you'll like at least a few songs on this album, enough to justify its purchase.

0684874350|5.0|Angela's Ashes has to be one of the greatest books i've ever read. it was written with so much love and candid honsesty. i laughed, cried, got angry, and laughed some more. Frank McCourt writes with so much detail and precision that you feel as though you are actually there in Ireland with him. Though at times you can feel his bitterness you can also hear his forgiveness in the way he writes. you grow up with him and by the end of the book you are sad to put the book away. Angela's Ashes is now one of my most treasured books. i don't let anyone borrow it for fear they might dirty it up. i do highly reccomend this and its sequel, &quot;Tis&quot; to anyone looking for a great and classic read.
B00005UEAR|5.0|Okay, let me get the first thing I have to say off my chest first. I'm yet another one of the people who really doesn't like The Glass Prison. It reminds me of Metallica, and I can't stand Metallica.<br />Okay. That having been said, the rest of Disc 1 is perfectly acceptable. Not super-duper-incredible or anything like SfAM, but good enough to remain in your collection. If they stopped there, this album would be more than acceptable.<br />Fortunately, Disc 2 and the title track make it nearly required that you get this album. I'd put SfAM over it, except that there were spots in SfAM that I didn't particularly enjoy, and there was NOTHING of the sort in Disc 2. Maybe I'm too easy to please, but I couldn't find anything wrong.<br />Get this album. Now. Put an extra mortgage on your house or rent out your car if you have to. It's worth it.
B00004SU5J|5.0|I just returned from Siena, Italy, where I walked the cobblestone streets and heard this amazing sound - St. Germain's Tourist.  The shopkeeper was knitting on a loom a sweater listening to this music, she could hardly speak English, but spoke the music language very well.  I couldn't wait to get home, and found the first &quot;disco&quot; shop to buy it.  Every track gets better than the last.  A real groove happening here on this CD. I haven't listened much to anything else since I have been home.  I rank this among my top 5 jazz cds (Freddie Hubbard's First Light, is still number one after all these years) Love it. P.S. I did buy a a sweater too.
0156907399|1.0|I found this book to be immensely boring. It has no real plot, and it defies almost every rule of grammar I have been taught. Many words were mispelled, and I had a hard time forcing myself to finish the book. After reading the entire book, I cannot recall anything about it other than Mrs. Ramasay's name. I don't know what any of the people who gave this book good reviews were thinking, because I would NEVER recommend this to anyone who I held even the smallest amount of respect for.<BR>DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK
B00005AR3G|5.0|We not only have the DVD but the books on CD as well.  We listen to it in the car and watch the DVD.  It is great when the kids pose and say BOOM BABY.  They really have fun with it.  The extras on the DVD was the selling point.  Even dad loved the game.
0316666343|5.0|I find myself recommending this book to more and more people. THE LOVELY BONES is like a symphony with not a note out of place. It's very well written and well edited. I appreciate all the finish work put into this, which is all too rare these days in publishing. Everything about the book is finely polished. And it is beautifully put together. The language reminds me of WHITE OLEANDER in which the author used words and metaphors in new ways to make us see in new ways. What an experience, to look at life and death from this whole new perspective. I hated to see it end. In fact, I found myself crying. I read it basically in one sitting -- I simply couldn't put it down. Such a good read! I can't get over how excellent this book is -- it's a fine, fine work of art that will last a long time in the literary world. Fun, tense, quiet, reflective, horrifying, sad, peaceful, joyful, loving. And it makes you think. And feel. And think again. An astounding book.
6304383177|5.0|The dialogue sizzles and Howard Hawk's direction is fast and furious in Hepburn's sole excursion into the screwball genre: it's great fun from beginning to end.  Susan Vance is an eccentric heiress with a wandering dog (he looks just like Nick and Nora's Asta) who steals a dinosaur bone from paleontolgist David Huxley: it's a vital bone which is the last needed to complete his reconstruction of a prehistoric beast.  Without the missing bone, Huxley will not be able to exhibit the creature in order to receive $1,OOO,OOO from donors needed to open his museum.  Huxley follows Vance to her Connecticut farm in search of the relic and runs right smack into  Vance's pet Brazilian leopard...Hepburn and Grant are superb in this delightful screwball comedy with a plot which could have been hatched in a mental institution. Director Hawks refused to have one sane character in the entire film and directed with virtually complete abandon, the results being blissfully, insanely hilarious. For those who are interested, there is a computer-colorized version.
B00004R7TP|5.0|I bought this album over 17 years ago, when it first came out in 1985. I can honestly say I have listened to it at least once every year. Each time, I seem to find something I missed the last time I listened. How many albums can you say that about?
B00005JKO3|5.0|This is a very solid movie with good acting and cinemotagraphy.

B00005NP04|5.0|Martina McBride is maybe the most powerful singer of all time.  When she sings holding a note, she sings it.  Her voice just sends chills down my spine.  The thing that really gets me about her, is that she's even more amazing live as she is on CD.  This has all of her best songs on one CD.  Here's a brief review for each song.<br />1. My Baby Loves Me ~ This song is really cute, really fun.  (Just like the video).  But it doesn't show her talent as much as other songs.  I still like it a lot, though.<br />2. Life #9 ~ This wasn't a real &quot;hit&quot; of hers, but I still really like it.  It's really fun, it's real country.<br />3. Independence Day ~ This song is really powerful.  It shows her talent in this song, but also her guts.  It's a controversial song, and I admire her for doing it because she wanted to.  It's a good video as well.<br />4. Strangers ~ This wasn't a real hit of hers, either, but I really like it.  Her voice is so beautiful in this song.  It's very powerful, too.<br />5. Safe In The Arms Of Love ~ This is a real feel-good song.  It's very visual.  Her voice sounds great in this song, too.  I like the video has well.<br />6. Wild Angels ~ This is one of my favorites of Martina's.  It's another feel-good song of hers.<br />7. Valentine ~ For some reason, this isn't my favorite song she does.  It's really beautiful, though.  The piano duet with Jim Brickman is really good.<br />8. A Broken Wing ~ This song is so amazing.  The way she holds the note at the end of the song is so amazing.  She sings it with a lot of strength.  This is one of my favorites she does.  The video's great.<br />9. Happy Girl ~ Martina does a lot of feel-good songs, and this is another one.  It's real fun, yet shows talent.<br />10. Wrong Again ~ This one wasn't a big hit, either, but I like it.  Her voice is beautiful in it.<br />11. Whatever You Say ~ Her voice is very powerful in this song.  I like it a lot.  The video's pretty good too.<br />12. I Love You ~ I heardthis on the Runaway Bride Soundtrack and it's really good.  Her voice is beautiful singing it, but it doesn't show all the talent she has.  The video's really cool, too.<br />13. Love's The Only House ~ This is when I started liking Martina a little bit.  The lyrics are really great and the way she sings it is amazing.  Her voice is very beautiful and powerful.  I like the video as well.<br />14. I knew Martina was one of my favorite singers when I heard her sing this at the CMA's.  I forget which year.  When she sang the part towards the end where she holds the note live, and sang it powerfully, I was blown away.  I started buying her stuff and paying more attention to her after that.<br />16. When God-Fearin' Women Get The Blues ~ This song is real bluesy, real powerful.  It's a fun song, but I got sick of the video.  It's better on the CD without the talking.  (#15 is just an intro to this song).<br />17. Where Would You Be ~ Man, can this woman sing!  This song is her latest hit and it shows her talent the most. It's probably my favorite of hers.  It's a beautiful song, very powerful.  And then when she sang it better live at the 2002 CMT Flameworthy Awards, I was even more blown away.  This song will literally send chills down your spine.<br />18. Concrete Angel ~ This song is very emotional and Martina's voice is gorgeous.  There's not much to say about this song except that it's beautiful.<br />19. Blessed ~ Not only is this one of my favorite songs of Martina's, but the video is a favorite as well.  This is another feel-good song of hers.  Very beautiful.<br />If you're a Martina fan, don't even think about buying it.  Just do it, I've listened to it tons of times, and I'm always looking forward to each song as I listen.

B00004SVID|5.0|Pink Floyd's 1979 smash hit \\"The Wall\\" has already gone down in music history as one of the most popular albums of all time. The innovative rock-opera told the story of an isolated rock star, and judging from Floyd's visually striking arena concerts since \\"Dark Side Of the Moon,\\" it was obvious that the tour for \\"The Wall\\" would be equally innovative. The proof of this came as bassist/songwriter Roger Waters placed his granduresque vision on the stage, building an actual wall between the band and the audience, expressing the noncommunication that comes from a life of stardom, adding huge inflatable characters, animated projections, and much more.<br />However, it's the surreal music of \\"The Wall\\" which ultimately supports the purpose of all these visual presentations, which doesn't make the lack of a DVD or home video too much of a disappointment (though it would have been a great compliment for the rest of the album). Nonetheless, \\"Is There Anybody Out There: The Wall, Live\\" is the supreme document of all the glory of the theatrical rock presentation. Though some consider it to be just another double live album that Pink Floyd tends to release during their no-studio-recording hiatuses (and they may be right), \\"Is There Anybody Out There\\" separates itself from other live sets \\"Delicate Sound of Thunder\\" and \\"Pulse\\" in that it actually has a point. The music within, recorded 1980-81 during the Earls Court performances, \\"The Wall Live\\" is a clear, atmospheric live recording, yet still packing the sterile punch of the studio album. Many of the songs, like 'The Show Must Go On' and 'Empty Spaces' contain additional or alternate lyrics, while some songs didn't appear on the studio album at all, like 'What Shall We Do Now?' and the instrumental 'The Last Few Bricks.' There are also many musical changes that add a new dimension to \\"The Wall\\" while still appreciating the original album. This is most notable in 'Another Brick in the Wall Part 1' and 'Outside the Wall.' Even announcements by the master of ceremonies are included, one at a slow speed to express the delusional mind of the main character of the musical concept. Roger Waters' vocals are also more maniacal throughout this telling.<br />It's a fact that \\"The Wall\\" has been exploited time and time again to reignite its fortunes, but \\"Is There Anybody Out There\\" exceeds them all (including the ill-fated 1982 film version). Aside from being the best of the \\"Wall\\"-revivals (although its purpose isn't very inspired), this live document is also no doubt one of Pink Floyd's most worthy live offerings, even though it isn't a new studio release fans have been praying for.nouncements by the master of ceremonies are included, one at a slow speed to express the delusional mind of the main character of the musical concept.

B000001IQH|5.0|Above line sung by Tim Armstrong, from \\"Journey to the End.\\" From an albumso punk, it recreates the genre. I recently had to push myself to work out but couldn't find anything to motivate me enough. Well let me tell you, this CD will get your heart pounding, and your body moving.<BR> It's silently telling you that this is what you always wanted to hear from punk music but never thought about. It's agressive and anarchist, but the lyrics always contain undertiones of strong family values, drug-free-ness, friendships, and territorial pride.<BR> I heard Tim's voice got that way from drinking too much alcohol. His oh-so-cool singing style-though not as cool or even very similar to Bob Dylan's-is closer to that kind of charm than anyone else I can think of. Lars sings clearly, angrily, and confident. Like Tim's older brother. My fave song is \\"Olympis WA\\" and \\"Roby Soho\\", though close seconds are \\"Maxwell Murder\\" \\"Roots Radical\\", \\"Journey to the End\\", \\"Junkyman\\", what the hell-all of them. But did I mention the lyrics are awesome too?<BR> These guys play and sing the way punk should: fast-paced, loud, with pride and attitude. Buy \\"..And Out Come the Wolves\\" and listen to feel alive. It'll make you feel human and give you determination you never thought you had.
B000002UAX|5.0|This is *the* Beatles album for indie fans, innit? Free of the myriad production tricks that adorned (and dated) 'Sgt. Pepper', this is the sound of music that is timeless and imperfect. Unlike their previous, more acclaimed effort, this is music that sounds like it could've been made today or in 1968. And while much is made of the fact that each member of the group was doing their own thing, expanding into new territory on this album, that's hadly a bad thing to my eyes (and ears). <br />Here we get John's most tuneful, bitter and crisp rock and roll in the potent forms of \\"I'm So Tired\\" and \\"Yer Blues\\". The searing indictment of \\"Sexy Sadie\\". The playful \\"Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except For Me and Monkey\\". The stream-of-consciousness tour-de-force \\"Happiness is a Warm Gun\\", which is maybe the best-titled Beatles song. The heartbreaking letter to John's dead mother \\"Julia\\". John may have broken all the rules of pop already with trippy psychedelic experiments, but here we get his best, most personal and musical *songs*. <br />And, of course, that bassist guy is on top form here too. Folky ballads that should be unlistenably precious manage to liven the album's darker moments considerably. Paul's ode to his dog \\"Martha My Dear\\" develops a memorably funky jive midway through it. \\"Blackbird\\" is an almost unlistenably-sad song, and one of Paul's career highlights. \\"Helter Skelter\\", \\"Back in the USSR\\", \\"Birthday\\" and \\"Why Don't We Do It in the Road?\\" all prove that the winged one could rock just as hard as anybody else on the planet. \\"Rocky Raccoon\\" and \\"Mother Nature's Son\\" are just a couple of his irresistable character sketches. \\"I Will\\" is simply a gorgeous love song. Macca's songs may not come from the gut like his partner, but that doesn't make his songs any less good.<br />As for George's songs, well... \\"Piggies\\" actually has some weird charm to it. It's stupid social commentary with hog effects. And I like it a lot for some odd reason. I've never had much time for \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", which features Eric Clapton and that should be an indicator of what it sounds like. I absolutely love \\"Long Long Long\\", and \\"Savoy Truffle\\" really  isn't bad.<br />Really, it's simple. Simply recorded, simply packaged, simply wonderful. It's an album you can lose yourself in, just due to its incredible sprawl. Writing a review for the white album sort of goes contrary to its entire 'concept', if you want to call it that. The sleeve was blank because the music was supposed to speak for itself. And speak it does.
B000069HKH|5.0|Like many others have said, this is one CD that I can't seem to remove from my player. I'm a long-time Springsteen fan, and had anxiously awaited this new release with the E-Street Band.<br />This CD exceeded my expectations. Each time I listen to it, I love it more. I saw an interview with The Boss on David Letterman where he said he thought this was his finest album yet.<br />I have to agree with The Boss on this one...
B00002Z88D|5.0|Many people keep telling that this album is another attempt by MetallicA to make money. Well.. if all they wanted was to make money, they would have easily relased a biggest hits album (with songs from MOP, RTL,...) and just waited for it to sell millions of copies. But they did what other Metal bands have tried and miserably failed... combining the classical elegance of Orchestra with the heaviness and speed of Thrash Metal.... And they succeeded more than anyone would expect.<br />MetallicA proves that they surely haven't lost their edje at all ! Take a look at the &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; live performance in this album.  MOP is not a easy song to play, especially live... and they have proven that they can still play as fast and as intense as they played during the 80's. The same goes for &quot;The Call of Ktulu&quot;, &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;, etc., &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot; sounds even better with the Orchestra as one might expect (In the same vein, they could have had &quot;Fade to Black&quot;  too on this album). The new songs &quot;No Leaf Clover&quot; and &quot;- Human&quot; are (relatively) slow and heavy.<br />I figured out that it is very difficult to listen to the entire album in one sitting, especially if you have high volume on your stereo system.... because there is so much of sound coming out the speakers that your ears can't take it anymore.. But isn't that how a MetallicA album is supposed to sound ?!<br />Some of the songs (especially the post Black Album material) doesn't sound good with Orchestra, but nevertheless this album is a good buy  for any serious Metallica fan !

B00006GFAB|1.0|Really, this has gotten out of control.  I am an avid KISS fan but I am still digusted by the way this band just (draws) money from it's fans.  Sure, they chalk it up to being something that only the record company controls (releasing this album).  However, nothing keeps the band from cashing the royalty checks.  <br />KISS fans - stay away from this one unless you really need yet another reason to have all the same songs under a new package.<br />If you do not own any KISS albums - you could start with this one.  However, Double Platinum or Greatest KISS would be just fine too.
B000069HKH|3.0|Bruce Springsteen's new record, The Rising, is a return to form for him and a truly magnificent record by nearly anyone else's standards. However, fans of \\"The Boss\\" may be left wanting more. Let's begin with the good news: First of all, the E Street Band sounds as powerful as it ever did. Band members wrap their collective chops onto these songs with a vengeance, lending them the power that Springsteen can only seem to muster with the E Street Band. (And the addition of a violin in the context of this record was brilliant.) Secondly, the band seems to drive Bruce to sing with the most incredible depth of feeling that he has ever exhibited on record. Finally, in my opinion, Bruce has created his most lyrically unified record, based, for the most part, around the effect of the tragic events of September 11 on people directly impacted by those events. The combination of the E Street Band, lyrical unity, and Springsteen's vocal prowess lend these tunes a surprising credibility and power, which will surely drive many listeners to tears. Now for the bad news: Too many songs on this disc simply sound alike (e.g., Counting on a Miracle and Waiting on a Sunny Day). And why does Springsteen need to use drum machines with the Mighty Max Weinberg standing by. This is a mystery to me. However, these faults are relatively minor. Let's just hope that this record portends well for the future.

6300216802|3.0|This is the first star trek movie between the Original Series and Next Generation. The movie tends to be drawn out especially the section were Admiral Kirk boards the Enterprise. Eventhough it is drawn out you do see how magniificent of a ship the original enterprise was. Out of all the versions of the enterprise, the first, Not Archer's but Kirk's, is the best. She is one beautiful magnificent ship. It is good to see how fast she can really go. The TV series does not show this but, the special effects in the movie version shows she is one fast ship.<br />The story centers around an annomaly that has entered the Alpha Quadrant. The annomaly is a large cloud that was first intercepted by three Klingon battle ship. This is the first time Klingons are seen with their full make-up with head ridges.You also hear the Klingon language for the first time. I don't think they spoke their language during the original series. The Klingon ships are destroyed in the cloud. Federation gets word about this anomaly and sends the Enterprise to investigate. The anomaly was created by V'ger or Voyager. Voyager was released during the 20th century and was rescued from space by a civilization of machines. Voyager then sets out on a quest to find its creator.<br />The movie was not the best in the star trek series. The special effects were quite good, especially when they get inside the cloud. The musical score was fantastic. Especially the music used when the Kilingon ships contact the cloud. The opening title tune will eventually becomes the opening music for The Next Generation series.
B000069AUI|5.0|As a relatively new fan of Coldplay i have to say that i was looking forward to this cd immensely. When i saw them live recently i was blown away by both Chris Martins' passionate singing and piano playing, as well as the crowds intense bond with the band and the songs. Only a few artists can invoke that in their audience. <br />They are really at the top of their creativity with A Rush Of Blood to the Head. Polotik, the albums opener, is a rousing and beat driven account that is unlike most things the band has done before. It signals to the listener that this is not your grandma's Coldplay!<br />The songs that follow are sublime and masterful. With David Bowie type guitars on DAYLIGHT and John Lennon emotions in The Scientist and Warning Sign, these guys are only on their way to the top.  <br />They can no longer be limited to the Brit Pop category. They are here to stay!
B000003S09|4.0|Someone calls this &quot;music after the Beatles&quot; and says that &quot;when the Beatles broke up, a lot of people in the music business lost their direction&quot;, and that &quot;this album was the first progressive rock album that went beyond 'Sgt. Pepper' with the exception of the 'Twelve Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus' by Spirit.&quot; In fact, the Beatles disbanded in 1970 a year AFTER &quot;In The Court Of The Crimson King&quot; was released. In fact, &quot;Dreams&quot; was released in 1970, also a year AFTER &quot;Crimson King&quot;. (I should call &quot;Dreams&quot;, by the bye, &quot;regressive&quot; rather than &quot;progressive&quot; rock; it certainly isn't worth remembering now.) <br />The Beatle's &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; was released the same year (1967) as Pink Floyd's &quot;Piper At The Gates of Dawn&quot;, Leonard Cohen's &quot;Songs Of Leonard Cohen&quot;, The Jefferson Airplane's &quot;Surrealistic Pillow&quot;, Cream's &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot;, Jimi Hendrix's &quot;Are You Experienced?&quot;, and The Velvet Underground's debut. None of these records, especially &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; had much to do with &quot;Crimson King&quot;, but perhaps their aura of experimentation encouraged it. It seems to me, on the other hand, that the 60's free jazz of Ornette Coleman and others probably influenced the ending of the song &quot;21st Century Schizoid Man&quot; and that the late 50's and early 60's folk revival probably influenced &quot;Crimson King&quot;'s lyrics, all but one of which are protest lyrics.
B000002U9W|4.0|Atom Heart Mother is the last in a string of Pink Floyd albums where the band was trying to find its niche.  Their experiments with sound effects, classical instruments, and lengthy jams reached their peak at this point and this album, although it has some very good songs and melodies, is more \\"interesting\\" than it is \\"good\\".  The opening track shows the band using everything INCLUDING the kitchen sink to create its soundscapes.  I mean, when is the last time you heard a lawn mower in the middle of a song.  But like most of Floyd's experiments, it works in a strange way.  The three middle songs are the best part of the album, especially Roger Waters acoustic piece \\"If\\", which really first shows Roger's obsession with madness and how it effects other people.  This is not an album for people new to Pink Floyd.  This is more for the die-hard fan looking for more steps in the band's development from pure psychedelia to art rock, and this album has plenty of examples of both.  If you own (and like)everything from Meddle to The Final Cut, you will probably enjoy this album, even if its just because you can hear the band in its embryotic stage.  Its kinda like looking at a picture of your kid when they are first born.  Its ugly, yet beautiful in its own way.
B00005QDW1|5.0|What is wrong with some people?? I think it's excellent that No Doubt have experimented with a new style- it's worked.<BR> The songs on &quot;Rock Steady&quot; are by far my favourites by No Doubt, I especially like &quot;Hella Good&quot; &quot;Underneath It All&quot; and &quot;Making Out&quot;. <BR> The reggae vibes felt on this album are amazing, the only song I dislike is &quot;Rock Steady&quot;- it's a bit too slow and boring.<BR> &quot;Start The Fire&quot; sounds very unusual as does &quot;Waiting Room&quot;, but in a good way.<BR> &quot;Rock Steady&quot; might be a misguiding title but the album is still one of the finest of 2002 (although it came out last year!)

B00000DQSZ|4.0|This album is maybe the best Kraftwerk album, and if not, because Man Machine and Computerworld are maybe as good as Trans Europe Express, at least the latter is more varied than the other two. <BR>Kraftwerk is one of the most influential bands of the century. Together with Tangerine dream, Neu and 2 or 3 other bands, they pioneered in the possibilities of electronics, creating a totally artificial world in which man and machine made a very interesting war. If you love electronic music, you'll probably know this band, very few things can be added. If by any chance, you haven't listened to this record, here is a review of its songs:<BR>The album begins with Europe Endless: a very interesting synthesizer intro opens the song, the volume increases progressively, until the beat starts, and the voice sings about a sort of rapid description of Europe. It's one of the best songs by this band. The Hall of Mirrors comes after. This is one of my favourite: composed only of a synthesizer melody which repeats itself along the song, the singer makes one of his best efforts on this song. The chorus is catchy, the song is more atmospheric than usual, with almost no beat. Showroom Dummies is more typical but also good, and maybe one of the best lyrics by this band, about dummies who get tired of being exposed and come alive and finally go to dance: perfectly example of a dead thing coming to life, another metaphor of Kraftwerk's music. It's very catchy, and shows the great differences with the previous album, Radioactivity. Trance Europe Express is one of classic Kraftwerk tunes, and deservedly so! The way the rhythm emulates the sound of a passing train is delicious. The references to iggy Pop and Bowie are also interesting. Later EBM and industrial bands such as Front Line Assembly or Front 242 have learned a lot from this song, among others. The song melts intop Metal on Metal: just brilliant. Both songs mixed make a perfect long journey. The title is quite expicit, since we hear metal against metal, and hey! it sounds like music! who said noise and music are opposites? they are only in the dictionaries, not in Kraftwerk's music. Franz Schubert is a piano song, romantic and beautiful, and a drastic change from the other songs. Endless Endless is just a sort of sample from the first song, and then the album ends as a circle.<BR>It's not that Kraftwrk's previous albums were not good, since Autobahn and Radioactivity definetely were milestones in music. But as a whole, Trans Europe Express works perfectly and better than both of them. Please, do yourself a favour and buy it.
B000002UA2|5.0|In this hastily thrown-together soundtrack to the rare French movie \\"La Vallee\\"  Pink Floyd stayed with the sound they finally perfected on Meddle and would later evolve into Dark Side of the Moon.  Without the lofty lyrical themes of their later albums, Obscured By Clouds is different than most Floyd albums in the sense that the sound is most definitely typical Floyd, but this is a disc that you can throw in your 5 disc player on shuffle without losing any effect.  Starting with two guitar filled instrumentals, the album then turns into a great example of Pink Floyd's ability to write a variety of different sounding songs.  The slow, piano tinged \\"Burning Bridges\\" and \\"Stay\\" are two of Rick Wright's finest moments, while the hard, driving guitars of \\"The Gold its in the...\\" is almost alternative-sounding.  The beautiful acoustic ballad \\"Wots..Uh the Deal\\" is probably the highlight of the disc while \\"Childhood's End\\" and the instrumental \\"Mudmen\\" shine the spotlight on David Gilmour's guitar.  \\"Free Four\\" is another highlight as Roger Waters takes a happy, upbeat chord progression and taints it with some pretty depressing lyrics about life and death, themes he would later elaborate on.  The strange thing is, it works, and gives a nice hint of the themes that would follow.  \\"Absolutely Curtains\\" is basically pointless, but I'm sure it makes more sense in the movie.  Overall, this is a great album that Floyd fans will love.  It is also probably the best album for the Floyd fan who can't follow the concepts of DSOTM, WYWH, Animals, and The Wall.  You won't hear any of these songs on the radio, but that doesn't mean this album isn't worth your time and money.  After all, it's Floyd!
B000002GA8|5.0|It's easy to look down your nose at the Model T when you have a Transam or a Corvette, or an SUV or truck for that matter.  However, in the day of the Model T, it was something to which everyone aspired.<br />So too we have an entire class of album that was more common and popular in the 70s than before or since, the story theme album.  Epitomized by Jeff Wayne's outstanding &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;, the story album is the concept album taken taken to an extreme, setting a story in a music framework.  Rick Wakeman tried several variants on this style of album, with probably &quot;Journey to the Centre of the Earth&quot; and &quot;Return to the Centre of the Earth&quot; being the most story-like.<br />With so few entries in this genre, by definition the few that are there are the best.  How fortunate that &quot;Journey to the Centre of the Earth&quot; really is good.  I recall listening to a vinyl version of this album often in the mid-70s, along with a large group of nerdy electronics technicians because the structure and uniqueness of the music appealed to us.  The synthesizers Rick Wakeman used were state-of-the-art at the time, and his skill was phenomenal.<br />As I listen to the music now, you could readily guess it is 70s music.  The riffs and arrangement have that 70s flavor.  Regardless, the music still retains its appeal.  There are so many influences in this music that it would be difficult to point out half of them.  Certainly Rick brought his Yes influences.  You could perrhaps feel a bit of Hendrix in spots, maybe some Moody Blues, perhaps even a bit of Isaac Hayes.  Throw that in with an orchestra and you have something that at that time was very progressive.<br />Okay, the lyrics are nothing to write home about.  They are simple, almost juvenile.  Fortunately they are not the main attraction, the music is.  The lyrics do tell part of the story, so you should still understand what the singer is saying.<br />Other than the other story albums of the time, and the more symphonic productions of Yes, the closest album I can think of similar to this in terms of style is The Moody Blues &quot;Days of Future Passed&quot;, which is completely different in concept.<br />Given the goal of the album, I think that the music is well-matched to the goal, not over-blown or pretentious.  However, recall that much symphonic music is by its nature overblown and pretentious.  Consider, as an example, Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture.  Definitely overblown and pretentious.  And who cares?  It's good music well done.<br />As with much of the music I enjoy, this album is not for everyone.  It is a niche album for those who like the fusion of rock and classical, with synthesizers and a story thrown in for good measure.  There are a variety of styles represented, including Rick Wakeman's unique style.  If you are still unsure whether you would like this, borrow a copy or download a portion from someone and give it a listen.  If Yes and The Moody Blues are your idea of exciting music, I'm betting this album will soon be on your list of good music.time, and the more symphonic productions of Yes, the closest album I can think of similar to this in terms of style is The Moody Blues &quot;Days of Future Passed&quot;, which is completely different in concept.<br />Given the goal of the album, I think that the music is well-matched to the goal, not over-blown or pretentious.

B000000OQF|2.0|What's so big about these guys??  \\"Appetite for Corruption\\" is cool for fifteen year old boys who are just discovering hard rock music....and even most of them will outgrow it.  This album does rock in spots, but I agree with an earlier reviewer who sagely claimed that this music is also quite predictable....and not very innovative, despite countless reviews that claim these guys breathed fresh commerical life and talent into late 80's metal.  My question is, by whose standards??  Sure the aura on \\"Appetite for Consumption\\" is a bit earthier than say, a Poison album, but is Axl Rose's singing THAT much more inventive than any other screamer in the 80's?  Slash was a talented axman, and Izzy was a great rhythm guitarist, but they were doing exactly what everybody else was doing back then, only with slightly better tunes.  So was G 'n R the Second Coming of rock in roll in 1987?  NOT TO ME!!  <br />The whole rock stardom thing also bugs me a bit.  These guys had to brag all over about their over-indulging everywhere, just like that other joke of a band, Motley Crue.  Real bands kept that kind of stuff on the low-down, completely hidden from public view.  Axl Rose and Slash acted like they were the only ones in the world who ever got drunk on a daily basis!!  <br />Hey, I used to dig these guys hot and heavy, and not just this record.  I owned all their crap, then eventually grew up.  This album is like a quick fix of something addictive; awesome for awhile, but eventually a drag and a nuisance, even a problem.  For some reason, I always feel silly when listening to Guns 'N Roses, whether it's this so-called \\"masterpiece,\\" or their later \\"Use Your Dillusion\\" guffaws.<br />PEACE OUT, AXL FANS!!!
B000002JR8|5.0|Considered by many to be the quintessential Pantera album, it's hard to argue that claim.  Phil Anselmo is at his absolute screaming best on this album spitting out hate-filled, yet somehow catchy, chorus after chorus.  This is also the album that cemented Dimebag Darrell as one of the greatest heavy metal guitarists of his, or any other generation.  The songs &quot;Strength Beyond Strength&quot; and &quot;5 Minutes Alone&quot; are the highlights on an album full of them.  This album can be described no other way than simply &quot;the definition of heavy metal.&quot;
B000062Y98|1.0|If you like great vocals.<BR>If you like great guitar playing.<BR>If you like great songs.<BR>Avoid wasting a cent on this piece of garbage!!!<BR>Let me explain. First the vocals are so overbearing, overdubbed  and anoying that if you want to hear any of the guitar you're out of luck. The solos are okay, but the levels are way too low to realy catch it with all the rest of the song noise going on.... The guitars in no way even come close to what Jason Becker and Marty Friedmen are playing.<BR>All in all this is the worst CD i've ever purchased.<BR>Stay away from this one.
B000002UEB|5.0|In the '80's metal movement Queensryche is often overlooked in favor of bands like Metallica, Iron Maiden, and Megadeth, but with their album &quot;Operation: Mindcrime&quot; Goeff Tate and company show that they belong in that elite group.  This album combines Black Sabbath with Pink Floyd and forms one of the greatest concept albums ever, inspiring later efforts by Dream Theater and King's X in their progressive metal efforts.  No heavy metal collection is complete without this album.
B00003CXAY|5.0|Koyaanisqatsi came onto my tv screen here in the uk 2 years ago at an un-godly hour, and I knew it was meant to be. I wondered where such a mind blowing film came from, wondered if I were imagining it, wondered how I hadn't heard of this unbelievable work before. So many people appear to be deeply touched by this film as you can read here. It is visually and musically simply stunning but the greatest, and most significant impact will be in your heart.<br />I would like to mention that if this film poses questions for anyone then the answers are to be found in the books of Krishnamurti. He is the most important philosopher/teacher to have ever lived. In his works you will find the ultimate truth, the world transforming solution. The feelings we (all seem to) have watching Koyaanisqatsi are only a glipse of the ultimate reality which can exist within us all only when we have understood ourselves. Know thyself. If you are beautified in the presence of Koyaanisqatsi know that reading Krishnamurti will take you all the way to the promised land...
B00006FXB6|5.0|If you think &quot;Corporate&quot; and &quot;rock&quot; are two words that should never go together, then you should thank God for Queens of the Stone Age, one of the few bands keeping rock interesting.  Although their first two albums were both terrific, this one is the culmination of all QOTSA have done in the past.  Indeed, &quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot; seems to be a combination of the riff-heavy stoner metal of the debut and the eclectic, experimental approach of &quot;Rated R.&quot;  The result: an album chock full of twisted guitars, trippy vocals, and eccentric song structures, sure to please even the most discriminating rock fan.<br />The album fires out of the gate with the roaring &quot;You Think I Ain't Worth A Dollar, But I Feel Like A Millionaire,&quot; which gives me an uncontrollable urge to turn my car into a one-man mosh pit.  From there, the goods come quickly, as the first five songs are all no less than terrific.  &quot;No One Knows&quot; and &quot;A song for the Dead&quot; boast two of the most likeably wacky time signatures in recent rock memory.  Much publicized addition Dave Grohl gets to show off his drum chops on the hard-driving &quot;First it Giveth,&quot; while &quot;The Sky is Fallin'&quot; combines a heavy riff and laid-back vocals to great effect.  Later, &quot;Go With The Flow&quot; introduces a pounding piano beat into the mix, and the result is just spectacularly infectious.  &quot;Do It Again&quot; and &quot;God is in the Radio,&quot; meanwhile, boast grooves so deep you could fall into them.  I know I've mentioned just about every song by now, but they're all just so damn good it's hard to single any out.  The guitars are great, and the bands multi-vocalist approach gives you a variety of sounds to chew on.<br />Now this isn't pop, and if you're the kind of person who forms an opinion about a song within one minute of the first listen, &quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot; might not be for you.  But with a little close listening, it's pretty easy to settle into a groove.  &quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot; is one of those rare rock albums that actually get better with time, and manage to hold your attention all the way through.ty easy to settle into a groove.  &quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot; is one of those rare rock albums that actually get better with time, and manage to hold your attention all the way through.
B00005QFE5|5.0|The Road Home is a beautiful, colorful love story within the framework of a later perspective.  Despite the subtitles, it takes just moments to fall in love with the story, the people, and the culture.  Even my nine year old girl was attentive and captivated.  What a clean, refreshing, impressive piece of work!  This is a treasured story in my personal collection.
B0000640SA|5.0|This is simply an Awesome movie from start to finish.  Well acted, well put together, well everything.  Just think about it...You would'nt even be living if you lost your short term memory, you'd just be this thing or freak wondering around hopelessly. Christopher Nolan also made the movie \\"Insomnia\\" which was just released in theatres a while back also well worth checking out. Enjoy.
B000069AUI|5.0|From the first song to the last this latest offering from Coldplay is stunning.  Every song has at least one melody that you will be singing over and over in your head.  Chris Martin, Coldplay's passionate vocalist, captures such true beauty in his voice alone that he could be singing a recipe and still bring you to tears.  Jon Buckland has really come into his own on this album and delivers wonderfully layered and harmonic guitar leads over most of the album.  His playing is very atmospheric.  I loved Parachutes but it left me feeling empty on alot of the tracks.  I knew this band had some(somewhat) upbeat songs in them which really come shining through on this album.  Some of my faves are \\"Politik\\", \\"In My Place\\", \\"Daylight\\", \\"Green Eyes\\", and \\"A Whisper\\" which is really amazing.  It reminds me of the Velvet Underground. So purchase this album.  And make the world a better place.
B00004Z459|4.0|Now buying this CD was a leap of faith for me. I had heard &quot;In the End&quot;, which I thought was Ok, if a little bit rappy. Points of Authority and Crawling I had only heard from the remix CD. But after purchasing Hybrid Theory, I have become an addict of the mix of rap, soft rock, and metal that Linkin Park has managed. The tortured lyrics, hard edged sound, and meaningful raps hooked me. The only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars is the poorly conceived first and second tracks, which wastes the talent of both Chester Bennington AND Mike Shinoda with continual rap.
B000002H33|5.0|master of puppets is the first and best metallica album i ever owned.i had been exposed to alot of metal before i heard this album.bands like van halen,judas priest,iron maiden,black sabbath. when this album came out in '86 i was 17 and i was curious about metallica at the time.... so i bought the album. it blew my mind. i had never heard metal this intense.it was like 'getting high' off of metal.i would listen to this album for weeks and never get tired of it. then i bought ride the lightning and became an even bigger metallica fan.and then eventually kill em all.but of the 3 albums puppets stood above the rest.and there are alot of reasons why puppets is so great.great lyrics, fantastic production (fleming rasmussen), and the music is incredible. the album cover is great too. hetfield's lyric's are intelligent and the subject matter is interesting,also. songs about cocaine addiction, the mentaly ill, war, gangs, religion. and there is one other factor that makes this album so great.the music is sincere. the music was not created to sell a billion copies. it was created because those guys loved what they were doing. and anyone who tells you that metallica at that time were posers and were not hard metal is full of it. some of the songs are so hard at times they are annoying. particularly songs like 'disposable heroes' and 'leper messiah'. to sum it up, master of puppets is one of the greatest metal albums ever recorded by one of the greatest metal bands

B00005JKNF|3.0|I've never cared greatly for those movies where they assemble a lot of name stars and give them each five minutes of screen time, and we're supposed to be impressed by how brilliant they all are in their cameos. I never became interested in any of these people, with the exception of Jeremy Northam's Ivor Novello, who had a charm that was utterly wasted among these well-draped icycles. Bored and desperate Upstairs or cheeky and snobbish Downstairs, they played to type, and the lesson that the classes were hopelesly intertwined was made clear within the first few minutes. It was not amusing; it was unpleasant, watching people be carelessly brutal to each other for two hours. The point of the murder seemed to be that anyone could have done it (it was easy to figure out who had) and no one cared. Nor did I.
B00005JKJA|2.0|Well, Mr. Lynch infuses this film with his trademark masterful cinematography, lighting, and sense of quiet menace, but the scene timing was, for this viewer, off. The acting by much of the cast, including the principals, was strangely wooden, ala House of Games. Curiously, the most effective acting for me was a performance within a performance when Naomi Watts auditioned for a coveted movie role. In most murder mysteries, the plot starts out confusing then gradually becomes clear. In this one, the opposite appears to take place. Two thirds through this film I found myself repeatedly blurting out to my empty livingroom ... I spent the remainder of the film hopelessly lost. I've read the previous reviews on this site and while I agree that art often needn't make sense, that's when your talking about lyrics, sculpture or a painting. These strike you and evoke an emotional reaction in a short, sharp chop. A movie however, is a story. And if you're gonna spend 2-1/2 hours telling a story you BETTER make sense and not leave the tellee feeling like you're pulling an Andy Kaufmann on them, cause that's 2-1/2 hours they'll never get back. I don't want or expect every movie to be clear as an azure lake in deepest summer, but I also don't want to have to cross reference written notes. There are doubtless many who will regard this film as a masterpiece, because, that courtroom observer guy in the movie \\"After the Fox\\" went wild over the Fox's Italian village Victor Mature masterpiece. I.....am confused. But then, Picasso and Pollock leave a groove in my hair too, so what do I know. It's MY money though, so I'm glad I only rented.
B00006AW2J|5.0|This is my favorite Stones album. I own 5 different imported vinyl versions and an equal number of CDs. But, now they've finally got it right for this SACD release.<BR>The album has never sounded clearer or had as much dynamic range. You will be able to hear instruments and voices that have been buried in bad mixes for over thirty years.<BR>I feel like I just heard the album for the first time - the recording is that good.<BR>Run out and buy this now. Truly incredible.
B00006GA48|5.0|An all-time classic is available on CD......this is a very<BR>underrated album.

The ocean<BR>sounds and string section at the end are now right up front and<BR>very clear......I've enjoyed this band for over 30 years and it's<BR>exciting that these classics are now digital......reviewer Linda<BR>should check in soon with her thoughts and I look forward to <BR>reading them......Linda, your taste in music is way cool and putting this disc on your Listamania was a smart move.....I recommend this disc to old fans as well as the new ones that want<BR>to know a little more about the band besides &quot;The Locomotion&quot; or<BR>&quot;We're an American Band&quot;.......5 stars all the way......
B00006AW2G|5.0|Finally, Stones CDs that sound good. Yes, this has all the warts we've come to know - some tape hiss, distortion - but it's as close to the fine imported British vinyl I grew up with as a teenager that we'll ever get.<BR>In fact, these recordings surpass the vinyl in many ways. Charlie Watts has never sounded better and I was actually able to hear some fine bass drum that was inaudible in previous versions.<BR>The guitars are crystal clear, vocals are in your face, bass is tight and clean.<BR>You will not believe the clarity of the vibes on Monkey Man - truly amazing.<BR>So should you go out and buy this? What are you waiting for? Run!
B000060MWU|4.0|If you are able to play Region 2 PAL discs (as I am), the German edition of Lost Highway on DVD is the way to go.  The English soundtrack is included in Dolby 5.1, and (unlike the Canadian edition) it's in W-I-D-E-S-C-R-E-E-N.  Another review of this disc convinced me to purchase a copy from Amazon.de.  Surpisingly, Amazon.de recognized my Amazon.com login!  And placing the order was pretty easy, even though my German is almost non-existant.<br />The picture and sound quality are good (though not exquisite), and the disc even has some extras - which, on Lynch DVDs, are usually scarce. The sound track does appear to be slightly out of sync with the picture, but that could be an artifact of converting PAL to NTSC on the fly.  What I wouldn't give for a multi-standard widescreen monitor...<br />The film itself is a dark psychological study similar in many ways to David Lynch's more recent Mulholland Drive.  It's about obsession, murder, guilt, secret identities, and the demons that often drive people to desparate, destructive acts.  Don't try to make sense of it the first time through; just go with it.  Then, on repeat viewings, look at it as a symbolic map of a man's mind stressed beyond the breaking point.  Apply a little Jungian psychology, and its meaning should, if not exactly come clear, at least brush past you close enough to touch.<br />Lost Highway is an underrated masterpiece of psychological horror, and not to be missed by fans of David Lynch!  C'mon, you can get through the German...
B000069AUI|5.0|You can tell that the music's changed a bit from the last album.  It seems to have a few more instruments behind it making it a little more up beat then the last album.  The lyrics are still strong and well written, if you liked parachutes, you'll love this album.
B000066NW0|5.0|ok this is not one of those one hit wonder girl arist songs/record, the record has a real punky happy vibe to it it is totally real and totaly more than what u would expect out of this kind of an album. She has a pretty good voice, well lets just say the average joe cant hit the high notes, she has some structure in her voice, All and all this ablum rocks, dont let go of it

B00005JA2B|5.0|This is one of the best prog metal albums of the 70's. This is one of those heavy rock records that you must own to be a fan of heavy metal. Kansas rocks hard. The electric violin kicks arse! Kansas was the only heavy metal band with a violinist! This album is rock with feeling and emotion. This is one of those records were you wonder if the band are humans or gods. Classic.
0312265859|1.0|OK, I'll probably irritate fans of Janet Evanovich but this book deserves a single star for literature and 4 stars for marketing. Ms. Evanovich can do better and I'm still waiting for her transition to a real writer. I'm getting tired of the same story all over again. Read any book ... the same story, Interweave chapters from any book,,,the same story. Same humor, same will she/won't she, same klutsyness, same car wrecks, same funeral scenes, same characters, same mistakes. Hohum, when will Ms Plum grow as a literary character? Probably never because this series is an example of marketing genius, not as an engaging mystery series. It is not that this book isn't a well written piece of fluff, it is just that the eight books are ALL THE SAME STORY. Please Ms Evanovich, move on to something better.
B00002E233|1.0|Go see the first Jaws movie if you like sharks.  But if you want to buy this movie, let us list the pros and cons of this film...<br />Pro: Some humor (from L.L. Cool J and his bird)and a almost believable reason to carry out research on the sharks' minds.<br />There was also a very shocking scene (with Jackson) that totally surprised me.  It was the only one to surprise me.<br />Cons: Bad FX.  I saw this on the big-screen and the sharks looked totally fake. And you saw them too many times, which just proved again and again how fake they looked.  Also the sharks' were able to do things no shark could do no matter how smart, like swim BACKWARDS.  And why Marko sharks?  We're talking about one of the fastest and MOST aggressive sharks in nature!  Great Whites would of been safer AND have large brains to begin with because of their size (for research purposes).<br />Also the computer generated FX was used way too much even when not showing the sharks.  Like a ripple in the water to suggest sharks moving under the water, WHICH ALSO LOOKED FAKE.<br />JAWS, in where our own fear was used to see the damn shark everywhere, plus great music, was ten times better.<br />Don't watch Deep Blue Sea unless you plan to use it for a Mystery Science Theater 3000 party night OR want to cheer on the sharks!
B00005NOOH|5.0|There is little to add to what already has been said about &quot;The World at War.&quot; But, having videotaped the series twenty years ago, when it first was shown on Thames Television, I am amazed by the quality of the picture. Created from new masters struck from the original film negative, the DVDs present an image that is pristine.
6303920713|5.0|To me this movie is excellent. It shows how if you believe in yourself and if someone believes in you than you can do what ever. Michelle Phiefer is very good in this movie and the rest of the cast members are just as good. It's a funny movie but it also shows and talks about serious issues that face young america. I should know. I'm part of young america. Anyways if you don't have this movie go out and buy it. It's worth it.
B000069AUI|5.0|this is a great album. i was really surprised when i started listening to the tracks on their webpage. a lot of you will probably disagree, but i think this album is better  then the bends, and even ok computer. every song is wonderfull. there's a lot of interesting drum beats. and chris has a hug vocal range. so that's good.
B00005JL96|5.0|This movie is by far the best animated Disney movie in years! I saw the trailer for the movie about 1 month before it came to theaters and I knew that i had to see this movie. The first thing that i noticed was the cute little alien who acted like a dog on earth. I also noticed that this was not going to be a cheesy movie like so many other cartoons. So when the movie came out, I saw it the first day it was released into theaters. The begining of the movie was very action and comedy packed 15 minutes. Then i saw the little girl lilo for the first time and noticed that she was the outkasted friend in the group of girls in her dance class, and all the while trying to deal with the problems of her older sister nani trying to gain custody of her. This whole sequence of the movie was rather tear-jerking and emotional and at the same time funny. Then when Stitch came into the picture, things began to heat up. The movie suddenly became funnier and sadder as the movie progressed. But enough of my talking, the movie was a very emotional one ane a definate for the whole family to watch.

B00006AW2L|4.0|Beggar's and Aftermath, the U.S version are my two favorite.  I have been waiting 15 years for these remasters.  Everything sounds great, except for Paint it Black.  Jagger's vocal sounds as if he's far away.  I'd like to hear some of your comment if it sounds different than the original.    **************  Update.  The reason that Paint it Black sounds different than the previous version (Abako)US from 1985 cd is because the version on this CD is in Stereo.  In fact, all the songs on this cd are in stereo.  The original 1985 cd was in mono.  I like stereo, but these earlier stones songs sound much better in mono.  In the end, this cd isn't an improvement over the old version.   I still prefer the US edition to the UK.
B00005LQ04|5.0|For those of you who want to know what Asia's (currently starring in XXX) dad did as a director here's the best place to start. A superb boxed set of the complete uncut Suspiria along with a great set of extras and the tremendous booming rock soundtrack that blasted out in quad in the theatre back when I saw it in 77. Today you are actually better off then I was in 77 since this is the actual uncut film which I didn't see in 77 and now it's in 5.1 instead of quad. Many people out there may find it hard to believe but the crowd in the theatre back then laughed at many parts of the film especially the ballet sequences and I remember Cinefantastique saying some pretty bad things about it. I think now in this fantastic package in a beautiful widescreen print and marvelous bold Technicolor complete and unedited this film will finally be recognized and appreciated as the masterpiece it truly is. And if you love this be sure to get OPERA and especially DEEP RED
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay, who got famous of the masterpiece of sappy-rock &quot;Yellow&quot; which I thought was actually a real catchy song with a good video to boot.  The rest of the CD was a little iffy, it was just too melancholy and meandering to light my fire.  Now here is AROBTTH, the follow-up, well its quite great.  Its a cohesive whole, that while melancholy, doesn't come off as whiny as the first album did to me.  &quot;God put a Smile on your Face&quot; is probably the best song on the album, its instantly catchy without being frivolous and strangely affecting.  I love the guitar part about a minute in, and then the drums kick in, marvelous stuff.  Politik is a grower, a piano rocker with Chris Martin coming up with some excellent vocal melodies.  Daylight is probably my other favorite, the beginning violin part or whatever instrument it is, its 5 minutes long but not a second is wasted.  I love it, love it, love it.  Very rarely, does music get me this excited.  I think Coldplay made an absolutely huge blunder by putting In My Place as the leadoff single, its probably the weakest song on the album, God Put a Smile on Your Face is the obvious single here, it would catapult this album into the stratosphere of sales.  I must admit to not being that taken by Coldplay in the beginning, but this album is seriously brilliant.  I'm not prone to overstatement, or at least I think I'm not.  So just buy it, its a rare major label rock act that doesn't rely on power chords for impact.
B00005JLHG|4.0|Michael Winterbottom certainly had no way to go but up after the dreadful \\"The Claim.\\" And so he does more than make up for it with the fiendishly inventive and entertaining, \\"24 Hour Party People.\\"<br />\\"24HPP\\" is based on the real life of Tony Wilson a Granada television personality (he hosted Britain's \\"Wheel of Fortune\\") who also had a real talent for scouting, producing shows for and recording new and talented bands like New Order, Joy Division and the Sex Pistols in Manchester, England circa 1971-1994. He was also a club owner who had a lot to do with the invention of the current DJ/Rave scene.<br />What makes this film so enjoyable is the tact that Winterbottom has adopted to tell Wilson's story: Wilson emcees his life both personal and professional in as droll and dry-witted, British middle class/bangers and mash way as possible. It's a hoot.<br />Along the way we are introduced to a myriad of 80's bands and their music mostly through actual live footage of the bands themselves. But it is Wilson himself as portrayed by Steve Coogan who is the revelation here. He's smart about music and his career but dumb about the realities of the music business. He's very much in love with his wife but doesn't hesitate to take advantage of the favors of music groupies. He wears suits, dress shirts and overcoats to meetings with his rowdy bands, who wear jeans,torn tee-shirts and make-up and sport scowls of miss-apprehension and distrust until Wilson speaks of his love of their music.<br />\\"24 Hour Party People\\" transcends it's 80's roots and becomes universal through the sheer joy, passion and love that Wilson and Winterbottom obviously feel for this music and it's milieu that has as much conviction and reverence for it's subject than do \\"Amadeus\\" or \\"Jail House Rock.\\"
B00004ZD69|5.0|Normally I hate people who give five stars to albums (and I also hate people who preface their reviews with \\"I never give albums five stars but...\\") but (D'oh!) I must admit I felt an inner protest at the sight of the average customer review of this album only being four stars as it truely is a phenomenal work. I don't intend to namedrop a bunch of other bands from other such fringe genres in an attempt to look sussed and hip, as I think this band stand apart as a completely unique, glorius entity and the merits of this album should not be demonstrated by comparing them with the merits (or lack of) of other bands.<BR>   Many people also go on and say \\"Such-and-such album changed my life and perspective on music\\" blah blah blah...this album no doubt has had a profound effect on me but that is merely the reflection of own my desires and hopes and came from within myself, (cliche as it sounds) salvation lies within. And indeed that is often how I describe the sound Godspeed make, the sound of disappointment, the sound of struggle, the sound of that fraction of a second before you cry out of pain, the sound of bliss, the sound of a spiritual placidity that descends on you from nowhere and imbues you with a sense of invincability, the sound of forgiveness, the sound of compassion...better stop because I could go on and the grammer police probably already want to arrest me!<BR>    This album is, no less, the sound of a spiritual odyssey. The first disc is the the more brooding, dark aspect of the album...however, without the decaying ambience of 'f#a#(infinity)' or the furious nihilism of 'Slow Riot...'. Instead, it is the sound of a survived suicide attempt, trying to make sense of the wreckage of a life that they only have themself to blame for. The awakening of responsibilty, a desire to find meaning and purpose but having to call upon all your courage and strength to not give in to doubt and take refuge in irresponsibility and self destruction as you once may have done. It is the sound of making a promise to yourself...no matter what may come. As such the gentle stirrings and nascent majesty that start the album soon give way to echoes of old doubts and fears. It is then that there is a vocal sample of a woman talking about God, and what it means to be with God, 'and when you penetrate to the most high God you will believe you are mad,you will believe you are insane' and sure enough the passage that follows throws at you all the demons of self-doubt and self-persecution that the mind can muster. It is the sound of integrating your dark-side, the pitch blackness that we all carry around buried deep from the surface, every weakness is exposed and beaten, every vulnerability is raped...pain and insanity must be endured in order to keep that promise you made to yourself what seems like an eternity ago. These are sufferings to break Jesus.<BR>    Then disc one ends. <BR>    Disc two begins on a less hopeful note than disc one, with a man reminiscing about how Coney Island isn't as nice as it was when he was a child, which aptly serves to describe the de-flowering of innocence that ended disc one. 'They don't sleep anymore on the beach' he wistfully remembers as the music begins. However, despite an inextricable sense of unrest, this piece begins with a definite sense of relief and something of an intimation of a solution...although exactly what still remains painfully absent. This anticipation grows as twelve minutes in the drums and eerie, screaching guitars drop away like redundant doubts and concerns as ,pounding beat by pounding beat, strength, vitality, and energy return, leading to (in a group noted for their powerful cresendos) a cresendo the proportions of a religious epiphany...the first disc was the painful initiation, this disc is most definately the fruits of those labours.<BR>    The first half of disc two can only be decribed as euphoric, what it means to be a fan of music just changed irrevocably. The second half in many ways recalls the ambience of 'f#a#(infinity)', but where before the mood was one of existential exhaustion, this time around the mood is hopeful (in the newly re-defined sense of the word), more maudlin for the 'you' that had to be left behind, than melancholy for the person you are. And with that, the album ends. With the sound of a dropped drumstick of all the mundane things.<BR>    Happiness isn't something you wake up with or win one day and never lose again, it is earned through hardship and sacrifice, and is kept only through continued hardship and sacrifice. Happiness struggles with self doubt, makes mistakes, and loses faith...happiness is a lifelong struggle, and it sounds like this.
B000066NW0|3.0|My friend got this CD and told me I should too. So I did. I liked &quot;Complicated,&quot; I figured her other songs would be similar. I wasn't disappointed by this, but I wasn't raving for her either. I'll tell ya what I thought of each song since I have some strong feelings on them.<br />1) &quot;Losing Grip&quot;--This is the first song and it grabbed my attention, to say the least. One of the more hardcore songs on the album. 7/10.<BR>2) &quot;Complicated&quot;--Granted, this song was the reason I wanted to buy this CD, because I used to love this song, but it is SOOOO over-played right now. I can't even listen to it anymore. But I still give it a 7/10 for a good song.<BR>3) &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot;--It's upbeat and fun, but that's about where the pros end. The lyrics are OK too, and catchy at best, but this doesn't exactly float my boat. (Hehe.) 5/10.<BR>4) &quot;I'm With You&quot;--OK...a more ballad-ish song, with some pretty good vocals and instrument stuff...but I'm not a fan of slow so I give it a 6/10.<BR>5) &quot;Mobile&quot;--I like the melody a lot, but the song itself is all right. The lyrics aren't leg-slapping original, but she can sing. 7/10.<BR>6) &quot;Unwanted&quot;--THE most hardcore song on this album. This is dark and hard, and I like it! She really can sing variety. 9/10.<BR>7) &quot;Tomorrow&quot;--This is good. It's slow, but I'm willing to look past that. She speaks the truth in this song, or, rather, sings it, and well. 9.5/10.<BR>8) &quot;Anything but Ordinary&quot;--This song hits so close, I could've written it. (But I didn't.) More of a pop feel, but that's OK; I live the lyrics and I love the song. 10/10.<BR>9) &quot;Things I'll Never Say&quot;--The beginning threw me off, and still does--TOO MUCH POP. But this song was OK. It's about thinking awful things that you could never say, which I relate to more than you know. 7/10.<BR>10) &quot;My World&quot;--OK, I CANNOT relate to this at all. I live in Albuquerque, which makes up almost all of New Mexico's population. We have a million people here; not a small town. BUT the song is catchy and it has some funny lyrics. 6/10.<BR>11) &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot;--I like what she did with the verses; she sorta talks-raps them. I think the chorus is so true, and I think that she can sing in a lot of different ways, which comes through here. 8/10.<BR>12) &quot;Too Much To Ask&quot;--Some parts of the melody are awesome, and the lyrics are great. It's a little slow, but I like it a lot too. 9/10.<BR>13) &quot;Naked&quot;--NOT an original concept. Sorry, but it's not. But she sings pretty well here. 7/10.<br />This CD is not bad at all, but not award-winning-worth either. You'll have fun listening to it though, so pick it up IF you're willing to look past her punk-rock and skater-girl image, and if you can stand that she seems to be just a more rocking Britney Spears; she can sing at least.
B00006F7XJ|5.0|30 years on and Camel are at it again. Camel have been one of progressive rock's unsung heroes, never actually attaining the heights of many bands of their generation. Although Camel moves their music more in the softer sector, since the album Dust and Dreams, the album still manages to exude a warmth via the lush keyboard filled production coupled with Latimer's mellow voice and his delicate guitar work. Like all the forthcoming albums after Dust and Dreams, also this  album has to grow on you, but if you let that happen, it rewards you with beautiful music to dream on and on and on......<br />A Nod and A Wink opens the album, sound effects setting the scene of a lazy summer evening, a steam train leaving a quiet country station as a hypnotic nursery rhyme tune meters out the time. The melody is carried by the flute in this beautiful opening section and precedes Latimer's dulcet voice. The tempo is picked up as the band joins in, the song develops through a series of lighter and darker passages..<br />Simple Pleasures, as its title might infer, is a gentle track, the opening section predominantly vocal with the instrumentation fairly subdued.<br /><br />A Boy's Life has also a gentle opening section. On this occasion the accompaniment for the vocals are in the form of acoustic guitars which act as a precursor for the other instruments. This song continues the underlying theme of the album, reflecting upon our young country lad as he views summers past and present.<br /><br />Next in line is Fox Hill . A jaunty song with a bouncing 12/8 feel, full of voice characterisation. The subject matter of this ditty being a fox hunt, our boy, high on his horse, and chasing the fox across the meadows - the music captures the mood of the chase superbly.<br />The Miller's Tale. A gentle acoustic guitar and vocal number with carefully chosen string, choral and woodwind sounds from Guy LeBlanc, played towards the close.<br /><br />The last track is called For Today, opening with an almost hymn like quality, led by piano, voice and light band instrumentation. The piece evolves, gradually unfolding with Andy Latimer's passionate guitar soloing.<br />Critics of the band have many times criticised the band for not being adventurous and bold, especially during the times when progressive rock was being ruled by bands that were taking rock music to the limits of pretentiousness, like Yes an all-time favourite of mine. Camel have almost always stuck to a musical formula which has won them numerous fans worldwide, like me. Again, Camel made an album that leads me to the unavoidable conclusion that they have created another emotional masterpiece.hymn like quality, led by piano, voice and light band instrumentation.

B00004Z459|5.0|Now this CD I like! A lot. Every single song rocks, and I love this CD to death. Linkin Park's mix of rock and rap is a blend of my two favorite music genres, so of course I love them. Every musician in the band is great, especially Mike and Chester, and the guitarist and bassist. The drummer's great too, and Mr. Hahn's a great mixer. This whole CD is full of hardcore, yet rap-influenced tunes that you could listen to all day long--and I do. Linkin Park is one of the only artists out there in the rock and rap genre that doesn't cuss ONCE on their CD. That has been a big factor in CDs of that genre in the past. But the fact that Linkin Park can sell without cussing is awesome. You will not be sorry you bought this.<BR>**This CD has won many awards for the songs off it, including a Grammy for \\"Crawling.\\"**
B00004Y6Q5|5.0|Probably the biggest compliment I can give this Soundtrack is that it is one of two movie soundtracks that I have ever bought.  The other was The Godfather.  I NEVER get excited enough over a movie's score to go out and buy it.  Even if I really like the way it works in the movie, I don't buy it.  In fact, under almost NO circumstances do I buy movie soundtracks, they don't usually do anything for me.  But I'm being redundant...<BR>When I saw Requiem for a Dream, the very first thing that struck me about it was the music.  When I heard &quot;Summer Overture&quot; in the first few minutes of the movie, I loved it.  LOVED it.  I knew at that moment that I had to buy this soundtrack, and only hoped that they had released one.  And that was before I had heard the best parts of the soundtrack, like Lux Aerterna, Meltdown, and Winter Overture.  But really all the songs on here are outstanding.  Yeah like many people said, they are all pretty short, but really that only makes you like it more.  Have you ever seen a movie that you felt ended way too soon, and you wanted to see more of it?  Well, that makes you just want to go watch it even more, right?  Same with this soundtrack.  The fact that the tracks are so excrutiatingly short makes you listen to them over and over.  The sound of that violin (you know what I mean if you've heard it) is so haunting, yet so beautiful, and yet again it is so damn catchy!  You'll have it stuck in your head for days.  You'll be whistling it as you go about your daily routine.  I personally often find it stuck in my head while at work, and when I get home I pop this CD in and can't help buy smile as I hear those first sounds of the bass of Summer Overture....  Trust me, buy this and you will NEVER regret it.
B000069CWE|2.0|Now I know this CD took A TON of talent to make. And there's no denying Linkin Park has that talent. They're a great band. But this CD is just remixes of the already great songs off of Hybrid Theory, plus some old songs. These songs really did not tickle me pink. The originals are a lot better. The only remix I found myself toe-tapping to was the remix of In The End. <BR>I bought this CD because I love Linkin Park, and that was enough for me. And though it took incredible mixing talent to make this, buy Hybrid Theory instead. The remixes are too weird for me. The originals will do you much better.
B00005JKHP|3.0|Ok, I have to say that I approve of directors cuts. This dvd is loaded with deleted scenes and finalized special fx that the director didn't get to finish the first time around. However I first must say that this movie bored me the first time in 1979 and it bores me now. Star trek isnt about watching 30 minutes of special fx of Vger. Its about the relationships of Kirk, Spock and the rest of the  crew. I personally prefer the versions of this movie with the extra dialog scenes added back in. Vger drags on and on. I'm one of the few that would rather watch star trek 5. Now the directors cut of trek II rocks.
B00004ZD69|4.0|I'll be honest - I only bought this CD after being a big fan of Mogwai for a few months, and was told that they're similar to Mogwai - Well, they are, but I really didn't like this CD at first.  Maybe I wasn't listening closely enough, but just recently, it has all really clicked for me; I really enjoy a lot of the music on here now because I pay such close attention to the instrumentation.<br />My favorite track on here is definitely track 1 on disc two, &quot;Sleep&quot;, but specifically I enjoy Part II, Monheim, the most.  Quite possibly the saddest song I've ever heard; though it builds continuously on this same sad theme over and over again, it eventually begins to sound uplifting after this big tempo change about 10 minutes into the track.  Remarkable that they can cause such a change in mood using only a tempo change, but no key modulation at all.  What I particularly love about this track is the &quot;voice&quot; in the background, which sounds like an opera singer with an amazingly wide vibrato, or something like that - Well, I ended up finding out, after repeated listening that it was actually a guitar, and soon after inquiring to tons of different GYBE fans online, found out that it's actually one of the guitar players playing his guitar with an electric screwdriver!  I'm surprised he actually managed to make it sound that good, and that convincing.<br />The only thing I don't really like about this CD is the amount of segueing they use - I enjoy segues just as much as any other post-rock fan, but this is almost overkill.  At least 15-20 minutes of this near-90 minute album is comprised of noise tangents and movements between songs.  I guess that's fine, but to me it seems like overkill.<br />Other than that, it's a great CD for people who are into stuff like Mogwai or Sigur Ros, but may take a few more listens for fans of those bands to get into this.
B000068QY7|5.0|Sure, Oasis borrows liberally, but it's all assembled so well, who could complain?  If you were interested enough in Heathen Chemistry to look at this review, you should just go ahead and buy it.
B00005RYL2|1.0|I love the premise of this film. I truly do. Random immortals are caught up in a game where they must kill each other by chopping each other's heads off, the last survivor proclaimed the winner. Later chapters with better attention paid to quality are excellent films and well worth a watch, but sadly, what should have been a great sci-fi film is an utter disaster in its execution.<br />First off, the casting. Great actors, but you really start to wonder what to do with their accents. You have a Frenchman playing a Scotsman, while the Scotsman plays a Spaniard, and it gets more muddled from there. Fortunately, the accents are completely mangled to the point where you can't distinguish them for most of the film, but I'll get to that later on.<br />Second, the soundtrack. You remember Flash Gordon, right? All Queen, all the time. Well, as if that wasn't bad enough, it's repeated for this film. Now I can handle a couple of Queen songs in a row, but I'm just not enough of a rabid fan to put up with it for an hour and a half without whimpering at yet another Queen song boring into my brain. Using one group for a rock-with-vocals soundtrack is something that should never be done unless you are making a film about that group, which will assure that only rabid fans are forced to sit through it.<br />Third, the direction. What is going on here? Cut scenes from past and present are sort of tossed together as if they were held in place only by duct tape, jarring the senses of the viewer. It's enough to give you a migraine.<br />Finally, the technical difficulties. The soundtrack is loud, the dialogue is hushed to the point of muffled whispers. Lambert has a soft voice to begin with, but with the sound so muted I missed half of what he said and had to rewind and try to read his lips. At least here is where the failure of the sound technician compensated for the misplaced accents. For half the movie you couldn't even hear the accents. The lighting technician apparently didn't show up for work, either, as half the battle scenes are so dark you can't really get an idea of what's going on, guided into belief that there's swordplay only by the sounds of crashing blades. Combine this with the director's poor choice of angles and even what is visible is of very little help in seeing any action.<br />It's sad that what on its face should have earned at least four stars was degraded by sloppy production to a waste of celluloid. Read a synopsis of Highlander and then watch the much better done sequels.
0312265859|4.0|I guess in all honesty the last thing this world needs is another review of this book. However, I think there are two kinds of people who are contemplating reading it - those who have read all the previous books, and those who haven't read any. Here's my advice to these groups.<br />If you have read all of the previous Stephanie Plum books, your going to love this one just as much because it's a whole lot more of the same fun and farce. If you haven't read any, then you should really go back to One For The Money, because if you start with this you're missing a lot of valuable information and very enjoyable reading.
B00003CXRP|1.0|This movie has a good thirty minutes which are entertaining and interesting. Then Tom Hanks takes off solo. Now I acknowledge that Tom Hanks is a good actor, but an hour of him on an island is enough to make your skin crawl with anxiety to either rescue him to get other actors on the screen or kill him off. Sadly, by the time he gets back to the real world, the story sinks into a mire of sap that will threaten the loss of your ocular mobility from over rolling of the eyes. I would assume that the intent of the film is to leave you with a wonderous sense of his spiritual change during his time of isolation, but instead, he just became a boring and slightly unbalanced twit.
B00004VVND|4.0|The ads for its initial release read, \\"Westworld:  Where Nothing Can Possibly Go Worng...\\"  And that sums the movie up, pretty well.<br />Yuppies James Brolin and Richard Benjamin decide to shell out the mega-cost for a week's vacation at Delos, the world's most elaborate amusement park, indulging themselves in the total environment of the old west in Westworld  -  guests can also choose to live their fantasies in Romanworld or Mediaevalworld  -  where everyone they come across (who isn't a guest) is a robot.  The robots are programmed to act like human beings, and are indistinguishable from them.  Yul Brynner, the robot gunslinger, regularly gets shot-up by the guests at the bar, and is as regularly patched-up again in the robot repair shop  -  his guns, like the rest of the robots' armaments, are unable to fire at a living target, a safeguard built into the devices for the guests' guaranteed safety.  Until the day, for whatever reason, Brynner's gunslinger robot beats the safety device, shoots Brolin dead, and goes on an unstoppable murderous rampage across the desert after Benjamin...<br />This movie is mostly just mindless theme park entertainment itself, until the last twenty minutes  -  but the buildup has a lot of humor in it, and the final payoff is really intense.  From the time Brynner guns down Brolin, you couldn't force yourself to run to the bathroom if you had to.  The musical score is alternately as western as you could ever hope to hear, and frighteningly, relentlessly mechanistic.  The film is gorgeously shot, well-acted and -directed.<br />Ironically, screenwriter Michael Crichton proved to be pretty prophetic with his theme park idea, even becoming involved in them himself  -  and more or less continued the same \\"theme\\" with his later Jurassic Park series.
B00003CXDZ|1.0|Reading some of the other reviews, I have to wonder if they have seen great movies before. If not, then I can understand their recommendation of this waste of celluloid for sheer lack of comparison to something entertaining and original. A vaste collection of derivation does not originality make, but this film fails to even copy well. The singing is horrid, the acting is worse, and nobody seems to have any idea what they're doing. Now I am a fan of most of the stars, but I seriously feel ashamed for them for there being such a record of the worst they could possibly do. The sets and costumes fail to be artistic and only come off as garish, reminiscent of a working girl on Hollywood Blvd at best and autopsy photos at worst. If you have a yen to see this film, do yourself a favor and stab your eyes with a fork instead.
B00005JKDR|5.0|From start to finish this movie is pure joy for the whole family. We start with a unique storyline in a part of the world where all of the monsters live and work. Their job is to come through the closet doors of unsuspecting children as they sleep at night, and scare them. The screams are collected for power that lights their world.<br />The glitch is the monsters are deathly afraid of the children and when one sweet child finds her way back through the closet, chaos erupts for our \\"#1 scarer\\" Sully, whose voice is creatively executed by John Goodman. The fun is fast and furious, as Sully, and Mike his sidekick, an eyeball with teeth and skinny green legs, performed by Billy Crystal, feel compelled to keep her safe from and evil plot that is lurking in the underworld of Monsters, Inc.<br />Wonderfully imaginative, with bright vivid colors, animation so sharp you can see each and every piece of fur on Sully as it ruffles in the breeze, and characters you will fall in love with. This DVD is a big-time winner for the whole family.  Kelsana 8/31/02
B001B1UO6W|5.0|Charles Lee Ray (Brad Douriff) is a voodoo obsessed homicial maniac known as the Lakeshore Strangler who is one of Chicago's most notorious criminals.

Mancini and Kerischner were inspired by films like \\"Trilogy of Terror\\" and \\"Magic\\" with Anthony Hopkins mixing it up with the whole \\"Cabbage Patch Kids\\" metaphore then adding some voodoo elements to create a movie unlike any evil doll movie before. The film co-stars John Colvin of the 70's \\"Incredible Hulk\\" fame and the performances are quite good including the sexy Hicks as the hot mother of a child who's terrorized by a doll, the special effects of it's time including on Chucky still hold up after all these years and has stood the test of time as it's still popular among audiences. The film has became a hit in 1988 as it was one of the freshest and most unique horror movies of all time with solid direction by Tom Holland (Fresh off \\"Fright Night\\") and of course some jolting terror throughout that plays as a non-stop suspenser that thrills to the end.<br /><br />This DVD is the stuff fans's dreams are made off! previously released in a bareboned full screen version with only a trailer, this DVD provides just the right stuff for horror fans.

0767903862|5.0|Bill Bryson is a familiar travel writer that presents his material with a personal gusto that keeps the reader coming back for more. He gallantly approaches Australia and it's inhabitants with an open mind and heart that spills over into his writing.<br />This book is the product of a bittersweet mixture of facts, statistics, and observations made during his wanderings about this vast continent. Bryson is quick to enjoy the simplest pleasures and chat up the locals with an ease that makes him likable to the people he meets as well as the reader. To put it in his words, this is a continent \\"packed with unappreciated wonders\\", and his writing places us right in the middle of it all.<br />I picked up this book after reading A WALK IN THE WOODS which was another excellent choice by this author.

B00003CXA2|5.0|\\"Forrest Gump\\" is a movie that is the winner of 6 Academy Awards including Best Picture. It is also one of the best 90's movies ever made! I remember seeing it in the theaters 8 years ago. The movie tells the story about Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), a slow-witted but good hearted man from the mid-1950s to the early-1980s being a college football player, a soldier in Vietnam, a ping pong player, a shrimp boat captain, and a runner. He fell in love with his childhood best friend Jenny(Robin Wright). The DVD is great with all the special features including the trailers, the documentary, photo gallery, and screen tests. If you own a DVD player, you must own \\"Forrest Gump\\" on DVD. I think you will not be disappointed.
B00006BTCA|5.0|This Interpol CD is excellent.  I'm not a big fan of 80s and 90s alternative like Joy Division, but this is the next step.  The songs have an excellent rhythm and propulsion.  Good stuff, and I think I'm hard to please!
B000066NW0|5.0|I bought this CD on the recommendation of my brother-in-law, who is also 41. Hard to image a 41 year old man recommending the music of a 17 year old girl, but I'm glad I took his advice. The more I listen to the CD, the more I enjoy it.<br />Avril has a wonderful voice, unique to her. This is one of my &quot;Feel Good&quot; CDs, something I can put in on the drive into work to get my blood pumping to the beat of her music. I agree with a previous reviewer, that although Complicated is a great song, it's hardly the best one on the CD, there are several that are even better, in my opinion.<br />What discourages me is that several reviewers here seem to have spent a great deal of time trying to tear this young artist down, seriously criticizing her work and talent, almost like they have some kind of personal vendetta against the girl. While I'm not suggesting they don't have a right to voice their opinion of the CD, it seems they have nothing positive to say, only negative comments. I can understand if there are certain songs a person doesn't like, or maybe they don't like the style of music an artist sings, but to say that Avril has no talent is the mark of a clueless person. If they're such an expert on talent, why don't they have their own recording contract?<br />I'm always trying to expose myself to fresh new talent, and have rather enjoyed the changes in my musical tastes during my lifetime. The world is full of artists singing different tunes, different styles of music, different expressions of their talents, that's what makes the world of music so incredible, the divirsity of it all, something that touches each of us in different ways...  my advice to the couple of individuals who previously posted... if you don't like her music, DON&quot;T LISTEN TO IT, but if I were you, I'd seriously do a bit of self-reflection and try to find out why you're so overly critical of a budding new artist, to the point of saying not a single positive thing in your review. This girl is following her dream. Even if you don't like her music, you have to admire her for that, something few of us are really able to do in life.<br />I look forward to what the future holds for this talented young woman, and the direction her music takes, and the enjoyment I will get from it.
B00005OWEG|3.0|Ladies and gentlemen sometimes a great movie needs nothing more than a re-release. I think Disney did it right in the past when they re-release movies after 20+ years like they sis with fantasia. This movie never needed to be reedited. I do not know what is wrong with just digitising movies to fix color and sound and then just doing a re-release. It seems to me that the directors have a death wish on there hands and want so destroy there greatest works! From ET to Star Wars when will it end? Listen I am all for directors cuts and extended versions but those are done as part of the movie release to DVD or Tape and not years after production. Let the greats remain great and ACOCALYPSE NOW is best apreciated in it's origional form! The Great movies of all time are great becuse of origionality and beauty they have origionaly. <br />Thank you!
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Fiona Apple is by far the best singer-songwriter of the 90's, rivaled only by Kurt Cobain and Jeff Buckley.  Her songs are more than just &quot;angry tunes,&quot; each are dexterous works of art with lyrics that convey a unique viewpoint on the world in which we live.<br />For women who love Alanis Morissette, Jewel, Sarah McClachlan, etc, you might be surprised by this CD and how it completely pulls a trick on you.  This is not music to heal to, it doesn't convey any kind of political or feminist message, and you certainly won't hear it on the radio...<br />Overall, it's music told from one voice, one piano, one songwriting brain, one perspective- that of a young woman struggling to find herself in a world that seems cold and harsh...who can't relate to that theme?  it's the theme that drives Catcher in the Rye, the Bell Jar, and many many works that have graced us during the past century...It's not for all tastes, but those who enjoy music and art that conveys the qualities of questioning vs. preaching, uncertainty vs. righteousness, and honesty vs. falsity, this album will hold special appeal.<br />The opener is a loud brash anthemic tune, &quot;On the Bound.&quot;  The first clue that this album might be great occurs in the lyric &quot;It's true/ I do/ imbue my blue/ unto myself/ I make it bitter&quot; and the crazy innovative wurlizter interlude that sounds like creepy circus music.<br />&quot;To Your Love&quot; affirms the suspected brilliance with a haunting bridge, more wurlitzer and the chorus &quot;Please forgive me/For my distance/The pain is evident/In my existence.&quot;  Such a painfully honest tune, with ingenius music to match the complexity and introspection of the lyrics.  <br />The rest of the album is consistent with tune after tune of painful yet beautiful songs that assess life as it is.  &quot;Limp&quot; and &quot;Fast As You Can&quot; providing possibly the only radio-friendly songs.  Speaking to an ex-lover on &quot;Fast As You Can,&quot; she sings, &quot;Fast as you can/Baby run free yourself of me.&quot;  <br />The closer is the tender, lovely &quot;I Know&quot; closer to Ella Fitzgerald than anything on the radio.  She sings it as if it's a bedtime lullaby and it's an odd yet perfect closure to the beautiful fury that has preceded it.  <br />When the disc clicks off, you almost feel healthy having listened to such an intelligent and amazing work of art.  I would categorize &quot;When the Pawn&quot; as THE album of the 90's.  Shamefully underrated, yet Fiona ultimately prevales and comes out the winner in the end.
B00006F1LX|4.0|\\"Pulp Fiction\\" wasn't the first movie whose mood grew from the pop songs that became its soundtrack. E.g., \\"American Graffiti\\" found motivation in popular music much earlier, providing a huge boost to '50s music nostalgia. \\"Pulp Fiction\\" helped fuel a popular resurgence of surf music, but more importantly, it was the film whose director spent a great deal of time discussing his music-inspired methodology. At the time of the film's release, Quentin Tarantino consumed numerous interview inches discoursing on his technique for drawing a film from his record collection.<br />For those who didn't hear or read Tarantino's explanation the first time around, MCA's \\"Collector's Edition\\" soundtrack (issued to accompany the film's DVD reissue) adds a 16-minute \\"interview\\" (actually, a non-stop monolog), as well as four tracks left off the original CD. The extra songs are terrific, but expanding to two discs solely to accommodate the 1994 interview (disc one contains the music, disc two the interview) positions this more for Tarantino groupies than anyone else.<br />Those interested enough to sit through Tarantino's self-aggrandizing film-geek commentary (at least, more than once) will have already heard what he has to say. Those who just want to relive the film, and enjoy the music, are saddled with an extra disc at added cost. To be fair, the price increase also covers royalties for the four additional track, but the addition of an entire disc to convey an eight-year-old 16 minute Jolt-fueled ramble seems like a vanity project.<br />The four additional tracks (The Robins' \\"Since I First Met You,\\" Link Wray's \\"Rumble,\\" Brothers Johnson's \\"Strawberry Letter #23,\\" and The Marketts' \\"Out of Limits\\") have been added to the end of the standard-issue track list. This \\"Collectors Edition\\" features the same running order as the original, with the same dialog clips (with the same lack of banding on several, making it difficult to program them out, should you tire of them).<br />Given Tarantino's method, the soundtrack necessarily captures the mood of the film very well. From the rush of Dick Dale's opening \\"Misirlou\\" through Urge Overkill's cover of Neil Diamond's \\"Girl, You'll Be a Woman Now\\" and the Statler Brother's \\"Flowers on the Wall,\\" this is equal parts film soundtrack and Quentin Tarantino mix-tape. What's odd is that the song order doesn't seem to match the movie. Perhaps as a mix-tape the album's producers felt the film's song order didn't hold up. This is a shame, since it reduces the listener's experience of the album as a film soundtrack (though, of course, a programmable CD player quickly solves the problem).<br />Original soundtrack (4 stars) - interview disc (1/2 star) + bonus tracks (1/2 star) = 4 stars.arantino's method, the soundtrack necessarily captures the mood of the film very well.

158234082X|3.0|I thought this book would be about what-you-should-never-know-about-kitchens-and-wouldn't-ever-ask. It does have that--most of it in a single chapter. The rest of the book is really about how the author becomes a chef.<BR>It's a readable autobiography, but if what you wanted were the skeletons in the kitchen cupboard, this is not it.
0783225733|5.0|There were moments of this movie that seemed so real.  I don't think that the awesome story about this Apollo mission was completely revealed to people on earth until the release of this movie.  When watching the scene where the astronauts are using the rocket motor from the lunar module to adjust their course back to earth, you really get this ominous sense that they are in this very tiny spacecraft between two very large planetary objects, in an even larger void that is our universe.<br />The commentary from Director Ron Howard offers a great ongoing behind the scenes making of the movie.  Part, but not all of the spacecraft scenes that the actors filmed were in a weightless environment, thanks to the NASA plane that astronauts use to prepare for being weightless.  There were scenes that I thought had to have been filmed while weightless, but were actually filmed using simple tricks.  I have no idea though, how a replica of the lunar and command module were put into that NASA airplane, and how they got actors and a director and cameras working together.  Only a dedicated director, crew and actors could have made that possible.<br />The other commentary track of Jim Lovell, Apollo 13 astronaut, and his wife Marilyn is a rarity among DVD commentaries.  There are few DVDs of such a monumental true story where real people from the story can relate these events to future generations.  If only this medium was available during George Washington's time.<br />Also included is an hour long documentary of the making of the movie, Apollo 13.  This is a DVD well worth owning.
B000056HRZ|5.0|CASABLANCA is the favorite movie of many fans for good reasons. They can really be summed up in the numerous Academy Awards and Academy Award nominations given to the film. The combination of superior direction, acting, cinematography and a superb screenplay doesn't come together in one package too often.<br />Bogart, Bergman and Paul Henreid work together beautifully. The supporting cast is incredibly deep in talent. S.Z. Sakal, Madeleine LeBeau and Leonid Kinsky are tough to beat. Is it possible that this is only Dooley Wilson's first film? Added to this mix is the veteran star quality of Claude Rains, Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet.<br />Few movies leave us with so many memorable lines such as \\"We'll always have Paris\\" or \\"Round up the usual suspects\\" or \\"Here's looking at you - kid.\\" In this respect CASABLANCA is reminiscent of THE MALTESE FALCON and GONE WITH THE WIND.<br />For the record the Academy Awards were for best picture, best director (Michael Curtiz) and best screenplay (Julius J. Epstein, Philip G. Epstein and Howard Koch).<br />The Academy Award nominations were for best actor (Humphrey Bogart), best supporting actor (Claude Rains) and best cinematography (Arthur Edeson).
B00006GA48|5.0|Well worth the upgrade!!  Not just for the vastly improved sound quality, a real booklet, liner notes, etc., but just for the live version of In Need.  WOW!!  One of the best live Grand Funk performances I've ever heard.  The alternate version of Mean Mistreater is just like the liner notes say, once you get used to hearing the organ alongside Mark's piano, you'll find it the definitive version.  Grand Funk's best album ever is now nearly 75 minutes, spend the money!
B00005JLDW|4.0|The special effcts in this movie will blow you away! They're so cool and realistic. The story line's very simple and maybe could've been made a bit more coplex but that doesn't really matter since that's not what you're focussing on anyway. The acting is good and the epic backgrounds an landscapes along with the cold look of the movie and the dirt and filthiness help to create an atmosphere of terror and hopelessness. Towards the beginning though there are scenes where they show the dragons destroying buildings and famous monuments and in that scene, there was a building that looked like a sky scraper and when it collapsed, there were crowds of people running through clouds of dust in the streets screaming. This looked too much like 9/11 and therefore, I thought it was a bit inappropriate. But this movie is great and I strongly recommend it if you like action movies or sort of medieval ones. Oh and one more thing, Matthew McConaughey is awesome as Van Zan!
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay's back, and better than ever.  With this album they really show that they've got power.  You need to go out and buy this album immediately, if you dont, you'll regret it.  Standouts include CLOCKS, THE SCIENTIST, GOD PUT A SMILE UPON YOUR FACE, POLITIK, and the title track
B000068PQ0|5.0|I love these guys but I haven't listen to them since &quot;Transmissions from the Satellite Heart&quot; many years ago.   I heard from a friend that this new album was great, so I got it and now I can't believe that I haven't kept up with them for these years...  This album is so killer, the electronics and the melodies, it's all fantastic. Get it now.
B00005QXXO|3.0|First, I'd like to say that Radiohead is my favorite band at work today, and I absolutely LOVE their experimental approach to composition. When I bought this live disc, I had no idea what to expect, so I just put it in my CD player, sat back, and listened to it all the way through.<BR>Frankly, I was dissapointed. Radiohead did exactly what anyone else would do: play the crowd favorites the same way as on the albums, and end the set with a \\"lost song\\" that never made it onto a record. But Radiohead isn't like everyone else, so why'd they approach a live album this way? For all their inventiveness in the studio, they come out onstage unable to reach that same level of invention. Sure, they play some of the songs slightly differently, but why should I listen to this record if I can listen to the same songs the same way on \\"Amnesiac\\" and \\"Kid A\\"?<BR>I never go to live concerts because I'm not going to spend good money to listen to something that I could listen to at home without the thousands of sweaty screaming bodies all around me. I would only go to a live show if I knew that the band would create new music onstage, music that had not been heard before. That's why my favorite live albums are the ones that feature improvisation: King Crimson's \\"The Nightwatch\\", for instance, or Tangerine Dream's \\"Ricochet\\".<BR>By now all of you loyal Radiohead fans that think you need to defend your favorite band are probably reaching for the negative voting button right now, but just bear with me for a moment. It probably sounds like I hate this whole album, but there are songs that I like: \\"Like Spinning Plates\\" is woderful: just listen to Yorke's voice, achingly poigniant. And that piano - wow. Brilliant. Or how about \\"Everything In It's Right Place\\", which sounds great in it's new arrangement. And the vocal coda really adds a new dimension to the song.<BR>I also like \\"True Love Waits\\". I always love it when deep emotion is carefully handled.<BR>So in closing I'd just like to say that this disc is not worth it's price, but by all means don't miss the aforementioned songs. Try to find a used copy for really cheap, or borrow a copy from a friend.
0812550757|5.0|At least I find it much more enjoyable. I'm intrigued by the review that found _Speaker_ darker than _Game_, because my impression is the reverse. Perhaps this is simply because I love the world of _Speaker_. I'm fascinated by sf that deals with religion, and _Speaker_ is in my opinion one of the best such books in existence. The tightly-knit Catholic society of Lusitania is presented in a way that avoids either sentimentalizing or condemnation. Card plays with secularist assumptions by setting us up for a conflict between the \\"humanist\\" Ender and the bigoted bishop, but then shows us the humanity of both characters and their mutual dedication to virtue, compassion, and the good of their neighbors. Indeed, in the end Ender is assimilated into the world of Lusitania, settling down on a planet for the first time after years of wandering among the stars. This is one of the central themes in Card's books--the vital importance of community, the ultimate emptiness of secular individualism.<br />The great beauty of the book, however, is its description of the \\"pequenino\\" society. \\"Anthropological\\" science fiction is a lively sub-genre, and one of my favorites. The trope of a savage practice that turns out to have a perfectly good reason is quite common in this subgenre (Poul Anderson, for instance, wrote a story about a society that practiced cannibalism; it turned out that they had to do so in order for their young males to mature sexually). Yet Card takes this trope and turns it into an unforgettable portrayal of a race both biologically and socially unlike anything we know. The piggies are perhaps Card's greatest triumph as a sf writer.<br />Indeed, this magnificent book is full of one triumph after another. The character portrayal is, for a sf novel, amazingly rich and lively. As usual, Card gives us large, dysfunctional families and then makes us love them. Novinha's family, of course, is important especially as the place where Ender settles down, in a sort of \\"Incarnation\\" (one _could_ write an essay on Ender as Christ figure, but I won't try). Yet they are lovable and interesting in their own right. <br />Interstellar politics does not play as much of a role here as in the next two novels; neither does metaphysical speculation. Those elements are certainly fascinating, but in the later novels they stretch the fabric of the plot to unwieldy dimensions. _Speaker_ is close to the perfect sf novel--indeed, its major flaw is that Card is unable to wrap up the story within the covers of one sequel, leaving plenty of loose ends to be wrapped up in later, inferior novels.

B000067CQK|5.0|This is a tremendous reissue of this legendary recording. As one reviewer argues below, sure, the tunes on both discs could have been put onto one disc; however, that would have destroyed the continuity of listening to the album from beginning to end, which is an experience akin to reading a great book. (It would be like stapling a few pages of an aborted manuscript to the back of \\"Moby Dick.\\")  I applaud EMI for keeping the actual album separate from the outtakes. And one cannot reasonably argue that the 2 CD format they have chosen has made the price excessive. Considering the price of new discs these days, the price of this reissue is really a  \\"2 for 1.\\"<br />The set also features extensive liner notes that do an excellent job at placing the recording in a proper historical and musical context. The pictures that are included with the text are wonderful. EMI has devoted ample time to make this reissue live up to the expectations of the public, and I must say they have done a great job. <br />The album itself is one of the real classic recordings in the history of popular music. There is little that needs to be said in this regard, so break out the red hair dye, put on the face paint, and stomp around the house in your large, puffy silver boots. Well, on second thought, that might be silly and scare the neighbors. Just buy the recording for the incredible album it is, since it is as good now as it was back in '72.
B000001DVD|5.0|This was the album that committed my loyalty to DEF LEPPARD. A young girl, laying on my bed, playing and replaying \\"Bringing on the Heartbreak.\\" I was a teenager with too many crazy hormones and Joe Elliott gave them direction as I thought I \\"looooveed\\" some accessible teenager (as Joe of course was not and too old for me or use to be anyway). The music rocks, feels and is real. This also describes the band. True DEF LEPPARD fans must own this CD. While they are all good from beginning to end, this is one of the albums that expresses DEF LEPPARD's soul and ideals as they began there ascent to success.
B000002UUX|3.0|Although I can't say anything bad about this album, I can't really think of anything great to say either. I bought this CD to complete my Megadeth collection, listened to it twice, and put back in the case, and back on the shelf. Yes, there are some high notes, but the rest is just average. <br />If you're new to Megadeth and want  some of their early work, &quot;Peace Sells...&quot; is a better start. <br />Old time fans will probably consider this album an underrated treasure, but I just didn't think much of it.
0345350499|5.0|In preparation for a vacation to Glastonbury, I picked up Mists of Avalon concerned that it seemed to be a rather ambitious read.  On the contrary!  I could not put it down and I breezed through the nearly 900 pages in no time at all.  Each page was captivating!  I wish it had been 9000 pages; for I was not ready for the story to end. The ONLY character I felt was not terribly well developed was Accolon, but it certainly did not dampen my enthusiam for this fabulous novel!  I immediately purchased all of Zimmer Bradley's Avalon series books.
B00004XQ83|5.0|The harmonies in the songs on this collection of music is absolute heaven to listen to.  If you like soulful, heartfelt, goosebump sound then this is the music.

I highly reccomend it, for anyone, not just kids. The only special features that are really worth it are the deleted scenes<br />Now, about the difference between the two versions. I accidentally got the full-screen version and was rather upset with myself, being a widescreen advocate. Then I came across a particular website. I can't post the URL but, search on google for harry potter dvd comparison and it'll be the first hit. Anyway, it turns out that Harry Potter was filmed in super35 film. That means that both the widescreen and fullscreen editions are &quot;crops&quot; of the actual original footage which is a larger area of view than either format. So, what all this means is there are things you can see in the fullscreen version that you cant in the widescreen and vice versa. You'll need to decide for yourself.
0789723107|3.0|Steve Krug's book is full of common sense for designers, managers and webmasters who will be responsible for designing and implementing an easy-to-use site. There's not a ton of information here, no \\"two thousand rules of web design\\", but rather a few very well-explained rules that when applied consistently should result in sites that are easier to use. Rule #1 is \\"Don't Make Me Think.\\" The author also reinforces some common sense rules like \\"don't break convention unless you know why you're doing it.\\" He also uses good examples to illustrate his writing, and point the reader in the right direction.<br />On the other hand, you will need to extend the information here with more solid information. Mr. Krug talks about how important white space really is, but there's no indication of \\"how much\\" white space is good, or \\"how to identify a convention\\". There is no methodology behind the common sense, so you'll need to create your own.<br />You can get through this book very quickly, and for those that make their living designing websites, I thoroughly recommend it. Although it won't serve as a reference manual, I think if it were read once a year by site designers, my life on the Internet would be oh-so-much-easier.
B000068CNX|5.0|Friends is an awesome TV series. I am so happy they are putting them on DVD. Too bad this is their last season.
0743442539|4.0|This is a well-crafted story with universal themes:<BR> -The necessity and the costs of moral compromise.<BR> -The ambiguities that cloud the atmosphere on both sides of our political lines-in-the-sand (even the Berlin Wall).<BR> -The manipulation and/or supression of human sentiment by liberal societies and authoritarian regimes alike.<BR> -The modern complexities that ultimately overwhelm personal choice.<br />Because of the transcendent themes and the expertise of the narration, this book will be read for many years to come.<br />Time, however, has eroded some of the plot devices which were employed once so perfectly by this redoubtable book.<br /> 1.  The use of the tribunal as a device of discovery now seems quaint and naive, if not actually medieval. Today we see \\"trials\\" as spin contests or campaigns of persuasion based on known sets of evidence.  Our trials are dramatic only for the jury; the rest of us already know everything about the case. Unfortunately, LeCarre relies heavily on the tribunal to unfold his plot.  Consequently, this thriller resonates today primarily as a courtroom drama plus aftermath.<br /> 2.  The Author's Message of moral skepticism is no longer thrillingly provocative as it must have been for the mass market in 1963.  The characters have lost some of their facination as representatives of \\"the way we live\\" and their fates don't hold us in as  much suspense as they once must have. The heavy-duty Author's Message passage runs two or three pages and is integrated into one of the  most dramatic scenes of the plot.<br />All novels are affected by time and this one, already, seems old.  Yet we still admire the  novel's ambitions and execution--and yes, discerning readers will enjoy its patina.<br />LeCarre's next book, A Looking Glass War, is more artfully made, I think, so I value it more highly, even if the story is not so gripping.  I look forward to reading some of LeCarre's more recent books.
B000001EAQ|2.0|I really tried to like this album. I got into the drums on \\"Mofo.\\" I dug the lyrics about God. I even cracked a smile when Bono sang about the Playboy Mansion. And then I took the disc out of the stereo and tossed it across the room. It made a popping sound as it broke into tiny pieces. Next!
B000002UVX|5.0|I just picked 'Band of Gypsys' because I wanted to listen to 'some Hendrix stuff'. I already had a best of compilation but I was far from content. The compilation had some excellent songs like 'Gypsy Eyes' and 'All Along The Watchtower' but I think it doesn't quite express what Jimi's all about. To experience the 'real' Jimi, 'Band of Gypsys' is exactly the right choice. Somehow I was afraid this isn't quite the kind of music I like but after the first listen I can make a conclusion: THIS STUFF IS TIMELESS!<br />During these 6 songs I was actually able to FEEL Jimi Hendrix' genius. My personal favorites are the legendary 'Machine Gun' and 'Who Knows'. I honestly think Buddy Miles adds some quality to the songs, especially 'Who Knows'. I feel it's not up to me to analyze the Band of Gypsys' musically and I know you don't need to.<br />I believe it's a must for (young) people to discover Jimi Hendrix, with more generations to come. Buy Band Of Gypsys and discover THE BEAUTY OF MUSIC!
1573225517|4.0|....that this could be made into a movie was sadly mistaken. As a book, this quirky but very realistic story works brilliantly. The top five lists liberally desposited throughout the book fit with the style, the characters make sense and all of them work well within this book's parameters. However, everything is lost in the translation to film. What is quirky and entertaining in the book is corny and badly done in the movie; what amuses and tweaks the mind of a reader turns off on the moviescreen. <br />Ultimately this book is a character study of its protagonist, Rob, and his search for happiness. Music is paramount to him, and everything revolves around it for him. This strains his relationship with Laura, his girlfriend and ultimately contributes to that relationship's demise. The book takes you into Rob's head, and into the head of the average 20-30something single man, with the noteable exception that most 20-30something single men don't make lists such as Top 5 80s Movies With Molly Ringwald! Overall, this is a very good read, and a very bad movie.
1563894696|5.0|Perhaps the best comic series I've ever read. So good that it forces even those who believe all comicbooks are stupid to pay attention. Better than most mystery novels of recent memory, and many mystery films as well. Establishes the graphic novel as a fine format for &quot;film noir.&quot; Worth reading more than once.
6305041156|2.0|This is a good action epic for the time it was made (the 1980s) but I wish that Peter Jackson (Fellowship Of The Ring) would remake it in English - he's our finest epic filmmaker right now and he could make this story both more exciting and more emotional (this version lacks feeling). Also, modern day special effects would allow for bigger battles and more realistic violence. Yet this version is still worth a look if you are into epic action movies like &quot;Braveheart&quot; and &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;.<br />Peace.
6305508550|5.0|Several points in the movie made me almost die laughing.  Funny as [anything]!  ... even on the 20th watching (seriously).  Very highly recommended to anyone who enjoys irreverant humor.
B000063V8U|5.0|This season has several of TNG's best episodes. Beginning with the conclusion to Times Arrow, Frame Of Mind, Ship In A Bottle, Tapestry, and Fistful Of Datas, the sixth season offers a wide range of creative thought. And in the middle of this creativity you find the two part Chain Of Command, which showcases the excellent acting ability of Patrick Stewart like no other episode. Jonathan Frakes in Frame Of Mind and Brent Spiner in Fistful of Datas also get the chance to expand their respective ranges. In Frame Of Mind, Riker is seen as something other than the cool, unflappable first officer. In Fistful of Datas, Data plays multiple holodeck characters most excellently. The only season I would rank higher than season six would be season seven.
B00006879E|4.0|Awesome album! If you like early Lenny Kravitz, Remy Shand, Stevie Wonder, or any other 70's soul, you'll totally DIG this group.

B00006CXSS|5.0|This has to be one of the best series i have ever watched. Two thumbs's way,way up for this unforgettable and breathtaking series a must see for anyone who is looking for a quality series to sit down and just watch.
0805062971|3.0|I came to this book wondering if it was going to be as good as all the overheated media hype and fluff had made it out to be. It was touted as representing the anger and consciousness of the X generation, and maybe it does. But this story about an alienated loser who creates a violent cult of similarly inclined young men who weekly beat each other up and then plot to destroy society's institutions, although perhaps not great, is still pretty good. It's also reminiscent of the movie, Crash, based on the J.G. Ballard novel, in its theme of a repressed and narcissistic culture of violence that lies just beneath the surface of our otherwise highly polished, technologically advanced society.<br />Since I saw the movie also, I thought I'd briefly comment on it here. Just as with the book, although perhaps not great, it's still pretty good. There are some good scenes in the movie, but some of them I would have done a little differently, which I think would have made them even better and more convincing, but maybe that's just me. I do like Ed Norton as an actor, though, and he is certainly one of our best up-and-coming young stars. All in all, it's a pretty good flick that does justice to the novel and with a fine performance by Norton, and I'd actually give it 3.5 stars if I could.
B00003CXCW|4.0|When i first think about suset bldv i think of the funny spoofs that carol burnett made of the film!<BR>then i actually caught it one early morning afterwork around 3 30 am and was drawn to it!..Great film!!!<BR>luckaly today many of todays aging actresses are still being offered award winning roles! and HAVENT gone int oobscurity!..and it was  norma desmend who got the final closeup befor all of them!<BR>its a wonderful dark film i put into the classics file right along with  What ever happened to baby jane? .iowa
B00003CXXP|4.0|This is not like your normal Kubrick film or your usual Speilberg movie its somewhere between the two. Its slowly paced giving you more time to think over the moral implacations of having a robot child which is too human to be ignored and too robotic to be loved as a son.<br />It is very much a film of three parts, the first section takes place mainly in Davids new home after he is adopted, the secound section takes place mainly in and around Rouge City where David seaches for the blue fairy. Sadly the third section of the film (which has a very difrent solarized look) isn't as good as the other two, after the cold drama of the last to sections this segment comes across as pure mush - it's not that bad, its just out of place.  <br />The movie's photography is amazingly good, as are Haley Joel Osment and Jude laws Performances. Jude Law oozes charm and karisma as Joe and the middle segment of the film in which he domanates is my favoret.<br />I was glued to my seat for the whole running time.<br />worth watching
1402521154|4.0|I agree with a previous reviewer with the recent abductions in the news that this a relevant and interesting topic.  I recently lost a good friend in a sudden accident, and this book made me reflect on that in a heartwarming way.  If you have lost anyone close to you it will be easy to relate to.  I also agree that it is a slow read in some chapters, but overall I enjoyed the characters and their journey after a life altering incident.
0763617105|5.0|This is a terrific children's book.  While the subject appears to be about baby owls, and it does cover a few interesting facts kids will like, there's more going on here.  The book really addresses every child's greatest fear, being separated from a parent.  The baby owls wake up and Mommy Owl is GONE!!!  They confer with each other on where she could be, and they get more and more worried.  But she returns at the end of the book, and assures them she will always come back.<br />The pictures are wonderful.  Unlike most other birds, owls lay their eggs 2-3 days apart so the babies hatch on different days and thus are different sizes.  My kids love how there is an oldest, a middle, and a youngest owl.  They also like how the oldest tries to reassure the younger ones, and how the youngest always says the same thing.<br />The pale-yellow type on black is also neat, reminding kids that owls are nocturnal birds.  The information says this book is for ages 3-7 but we read this to our kids before they were 2 and they loved it then and still love it now.
6305537321|2.0|Breakfast at Tiffany's is probably the most famous classic film amongst the younger crowds. Mainly because A) it has Audrey Hepburn in it and B) it's in colour.<br />Now an explaination for the two star rating. One star is for the music and \\"Moon River\\". I simply adore the music. It's the best thing about this film. A second star is for the cat. The cat seemed to be the only character in the film who knew what was going on.<br />Serious acting critics would hammer this film. The most important line in the film [which Audrey says] is rushed, overacted and looks rehersed. The character of Holly Golightly is a selfish, gold digger, yet she is sugar coated with Audrey's charm. She's a fake, a phony and she uses people constantly throughout the whole film. Audrey was not right for this role. She even said so herself. Audrey wasn't a fake. It's this film which makes her appear so. <br />As far as the screenplay goes, it's rather confusing. I couldn't make head or tails of Golightly's former husband's significance to the plot other than to make Holly look like an even worse person. And the whole mob involvment was even more confusing. The character of Holly is erractic. She makes desions without even thinking about how it might affect her later. She hurts Paul [\\"Fred\\"] because she uses him and he falls for her. It takes Fred to basically tell Holly that she is a big phony and a selfish, foolish girl to her face until she decides to change. <br />A lot of this film could have been edited. It wasn't very true to Truman Capote's novel either. But, on a surface basis, the film is a wonderful study in 1960s style, as a substance basis, the film is poorly written, acted and edited. Serious film buffs, you can put this on a 10 year waiting list. It's not that important to film history, as much as it is to fashion history.
B00005JKG9|5.0|Quite possibly the most powerful and entertaining film of the 90's is finally coming to DVD. If you are one of the unlucky people to have never seen this film you are a lesser person for it. Get it NOW! No special effects or computer enhancements here just plain talent from top to bottom. The finest writing, casting and acting in any film I have ever seen along with a unique visual style to boot. Unless you liked the Rambo series in which case do not buy this film.<br />Are you convinced yet? Go get it.
6301930827|5.0|Based on a cracking book by William PROCHNAU, this is one of the better films made about nuclear Armageddon, The film poses the question of whether the armed forces could play their role knowing that it would result in the end of civil society.<BR>A particularly good role is that of 'Alice',the USAF General in charge of the airborne command post 'Looking Glass'. He is played by James Earl JONES (who never fails to be more than watchable). <BR>Well worth watching, especially by any body who thinks a nuclear war is a. worth fighting b. winnable. Present incumbent in the White House &amp; politicians in the Administration, please watch &amp; learn!
B0000214F1|3.0|This film has quite a reputation behind it. judgeing from all the rewiews on this sight i was exspecting 2 1/2 hours or hard core porn and Violence. but its not as exstreme as it has been made out to be.<br />In fact its quite a good film - it has a story, and some great OTT acting from some great British hams.<br />The camera work and Score are a bit heavy handed with its crash zooms and over dramtic high cords, but its all in the spirt of the picture.<br />Over all I enjoyed this film. Even though its not the best Movie I've ever seen its no way the worst.
B000068TPN|5.0|This is an absolutely stunning movie, giving a better depiction of how the Army initially went into the Vietnam War.  In the early stages of this war, the Army itself was ready and willing to fight this fight.  This is not one of those earlier films, showing the later stages of the war where the Army was demoralized by the politicians and the poor leadership put in place by those inept politicians.  Mel Gibson gives another stunning performance of a true field grade officer, who was born to do what he was doing.  He again shows that when you want to make a film of epic proportions, he's the one you want in the leading role.  Along with the disheartening scenes of what happens to soldiers in a war, the scenes with the wifes at home receiving telegrams from a taxi were very painful and gut wrenching.  Being a soldier myself, I think it would be worst for my wife to get that kind of notification, than being the one killed.  Again, one of the best war movies of all time, and Mel Gibson should get an oscar for this performance.
B00006EXCC|5.0|Aftermath was always a highlight of the early Stones catalog. Thankfully ABKCO came to their senses and made the UK version (which I've always felt was a stronger album although a bit light on the singles)available. It's a better album for it. The sound quality is awesome but the packaging leaves a bit to be desired.<br />I personally dislike the digipaks. They're not as sturdy as regular CD cases and not as inviting as the replicas of the original LPs. Additionally, if the spindle breaks on the CD holder portion, it can't be replaced. Doesn't detract from this classic album. I personally would like to see this trend in reissues continue with both the CD version and SACD version on the same disc. It's nice to be able to play this on both machines.<br />The importance of Aftermath can't be overstated; this was the first album totally written by the Glimmer Twins. It's also one of their best. This is where the Stones cut their own path and left most of the British Invasion bands choking in the dust. Only The Beatles' Revolver, Dylan's Blonde on Blonde and CCR's trilogy of Bayou Contry/Green River/Willie & The Poorboys have aged as well have remained as durable over the years.<br />Regardless of the design of the case, this is classic music.
B00006G8G1|3.0|I have seen Maiden 3 times and I think that they are one of the best bands ever.  Rock in Rio is a decent DVD, but it is missing something that I can not put my finger on.  I think that the selection of songs is what is lacking from this DVD.  Its cool that they played quite a number off their most recent release, but the older tracks could and should have been choosen differently.  The older tracks are good, but I would have choose different ones, ones that have not been played to death on their previous live recordings.  That is why I gave it three stars.  Production is very good, camera moves to much around though.  It is worth adding to a collection.
B000068TPN|4.0|Don't give up on this movie after the first half hour. The director, Radall Wallace (writer for Pearl Harbor)has a tendancy for emotional movies, but this is so for only the beginning of this movie. The next hour and a half is pure action and gore that rivals Saving Private Ryan. Great war movie that will keep you glued to the seat.  Not many extras, but the \\"making of\\" documentary is pretty interesting. <br />Don't watch this movie if you couldn't handle the gore and bloodshed of Saving Private Ryan!
B000069AUI|5.0|Wonderful depth.  Bonus track.   Now that Coldplay is catching on, i hope that they will not be overplayed as most artist are.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This cd is one of the best. i love every song that is on this cd. she has an amazing voice and very original. it is a very soothing and relaxing cd. i encourage you to pick it up.
B00005JKNF|5.0|Hmmm...where to begin? Gosford Park is unlike any other film I've ever seen, and I think that's the very reason I like it.<br />The plot, at first glance, seems to be simple enough (in fact, it's oddly reminiscent of a game of 'Clue'): A man invites several guests from all walks of life, unacquainted with each other, to his English country house for the week-end. Everything seems to go along well enough, until the master of the house turns up murdered.<br />That is where Gosford Park's resemblance to your average whodunit stops. In fact, the murder doesn't occur till nearly 2/3 through the film. First, we get the chance to be intimately acquainted with the characters in the house: the upstairs staff, the downstairs staff, the kitchen staff, and the glittery 'upstairs' house-guests whose lives they make possible.<br />The story is told more in hints than in broad statements, which I find refreshing. The screenplay is by the talented Julian Fellowes (you may recognise him as having been the Prince Regent in the 'Sharpe' films) and flows effortlessly and wittily. My favourite character was undoubtedly Dame Maggie Smith's 'Countess Constance' - she's so much of a narcissist it's hilarious to watch. Helen Mirren also does a brilliant job as the housekeeper, Mrs. Wilson. There are so many other stars in this film it would be impossible to list them all in a review: the cast-list reads like a showcase of the best of British talent.
B00005JKCH|1.0|... From an artistic point of view this movie is garbage since it has no merits(*sigh* no I do not write this merely to impress, I fully grasp the concept of artistry as I believe any thinking individual rightly should). The gravest of all sins committed, even above that attrocious rethinking of the classic Green Goblin costume, is that the studios saw fit to assign David Keopp scripting chores on such a major motion picture. He is an unoriginal man likely to have a boring life since he sees fit NOT to imbue his work with any noticible personal touch, rather he seems content merely to regurgetate what he's seen in other movies ( and not doubt the tenets of screenwritting as preached in Robert Mckee, and Syd Field books).<BR>The screenplay is crassly, so stupidly, so utterly banal, and shameless one wonders if in fact the writer (writers I should say...) were fully conscious of their actions , intending  to pass this off as a malicious joke on the American public. You will find, thinkers, that there is NOT ONE single original idea in the whole of this expensive Xerox. One need not reach far back into the annals of film history to see from which works it pilfered thus I will not name them, having full confidence in your film memory.<BR> The direction is boring, as is Tobey Maguire in the lead. Kirsten Dunst resgisters, but only as a non-entity. Her character was sorely underwritten. <BR> The cacophany of sound that Danny Elfman passes off as a score shows how the poor the material is, since even the man who wrote the great score to Batman cannot work wonders without first being inspired.<BR> One more grave failing is perhaps the cornerstone of its appeal to the masses. Spiderman is an 'accessible' hero( unlike Superman who is perfect for ex.). The 'accessible' superhero is an awful concept since it DESTROYS all that is worthy in the hero by giving him flaws, the underlying message being one of reassurance to the average that they may continue about their way, complacent, unmotivated to strive for greatness, since even those men we laud as our champions share our same basic failings, and may be prone to caving into temptation at any given time. This is the anathema of nobility. Sadly, it's popularity has spread in our culture not like AIDS to which there have risen many pleas for a cure, but like a disease much liked in its giving both the great, and the small a common bond.<BR>  To provide a balanced review, I will write that on the plus side, William Dafoe is quite good as Norman Osborn, and is the only one in the cast who plays his role, however lousy, with something approximating true conviction. It is he alone that raises this movie 'several rungs in hell' for me; it is the only thing about this movie in which I do not find much fault.<BR> At this point you may wonder, \\"What did you expect? Shakespeare\\"? Yes. We all should, as a collective body demand only the very best in order to recieve it. Telling ourselves that we should settle for what we're given in order to not offend others, or simply shrugging our shoulders will lead only to our film industry's downward spiral( or rather continued downward spiral) allowing for mediocorities like this to arise like so many weeds, in place of say American Beauties, or Magnolias ( which are at the very at least have a view point dictated by their authors and not everyone else, a concept rendered beautiful by our society's protestations to even a single man declaring himself seperate and of an unlike mind)...
B00005R2BG|5.0|This is one of those movies that seems to be over too soon. It's a riot of color, action and music that really grips you even if you're skeptical about musicals. I loved the soundtrack, the use of popular songs like Bowie's &quot;Heroes&quot; for example. Moulin Rouge reminded me a bit of Victor/Victoria and it's equally good. There's drama, humor and a believable plot. The concert scenes are sometimes breathtaking. I am biased against musicals, but this is truly enjoyable and inspiring. Worth owning to watch every six months or so - it leaves one with a warm, happy feeling.
0790734060|5.0|Everyone here has said their piece, and with the exception of a few, I believe for me to add anything about how fabulous it is would seem, well, superfulous!<br />This movie is one of the best EVER made, a true artistic masterpiece! It captures Mozart's legacy, while also providing a look at the more harrowing aspects of being a composer. Whether true to history or not, this is a MUST SEE film for all Mozart, classical music, opera, Tom Hulce, and just everyday fans! <br />Mozart forever!~
B000002H6C|5.0|I, unlike many of you, love everything that Metallica has recorded up to this point in their career. However, there's no denying that their three post-debut, pre-90's albums are their best, and among the best material recording by any band in any genre, with only Iced Earth's material standing up to it.(within the more or less traditional heavy metal genre.) This is porbably the weakest of the era, and is definitely worse than Master of Puppets(which needs no more recommendation) but is still absolutely essential.<br />Everyone loves to talk about the lousy sound quality on this album, and it is definitely a problem, but it really isn't as big of a deal as everyone makes it out to be. Frankly, the vocals sound the best of any of the 80's material, with out question. The drums sound kind of weird, but better than they did on Master, especially the bass drums, which where essentially an indistinct rumble on Master. Sadly, the bass is as hard to hear as everyone says, but the guitars usually have enough power that you don't notice too much. I say usually, because 2 of the songs, \\"Blackened\\" and \\"Eye of the Beholder\\" end up being severely under powered. Come to think of it, the louder parts of \\"One\\" are also a bit too weak sounding, but other than those songs it isn't too much of a problem.<br />Some people try to claim the songs on this album are overly long and lack focus, but this simply isn't the case. They aren't as continuously compelling as the songs on the 2 previous albums, but they really never drag. Hammet shows why he is my favorite lead guitar player, with great solos on most of the songs, particularly on \\"One\\" and \\"Harvester of Sorrow\\". His solos, combined with Hetfield's constantly changing, frequently lightning fast solos keep even the longest songs interesting. Ulrich's drumming hit it's peak on this album. He was never one of the best thrash drummers, but he has good, intricate and powerful patterns on this album, with plenty of double bass as well. This album is also their darkest overall, both musically and lyrically. Hetfield's lyrics are easily his best of the three classic albums, and tend to focus on real world problems including war, child abuse, problems with the court system, bad parenting etc. Metallica maintains a good variety of textures and tones throughout the album. Delicate, dual lead parts from \\"One\\" and the title track contrast well with the straight mid-tempo pounding of \\"Eye of the Beholder\\" and \\"Harvester of Sorrow\\", which too contrasts with the thrashing fury of \\"Dyer's Eve\\" and \\"Blackened\\". They have lots of strong tempo changes as well, with only about half of the album being played at true speedmetal velocity. This is a good thing, mind you, since over an hour of that tempo would get tedious, and is essentially the way it was on all of their 80's albums.<br />This album has 2 weaker points, \\"Blackened\\" and \\"Eye of the Beholder\\".(Ride the Lightning had only 1, Escape, and Master of Puppets didn't have any, hence my determination that this album is the weakest among them) These are still 2 good songs, with much of their weakness coming from the production, but of course knowing that is the main problem doesn't actually make them any more enjoyable. The rest of the album kicks .... Pretty much everything else is a classic. \\"One\\" is probably their best song, perhaps the best metal song by anyone. \\"Dyer's Eve\\" is pure thrash power, and \\"Harvester of Sorrow\\" is their darkest, most intense song ever. The title track is more winding, progressive brilliance, like their two previous title tracks, and \\"To Live is to Die\\" is another great instrumental.<br />So, go buy this album.is album is also their darkest overall, both musically and lyrically. Hetfield's lyrics are easily his best of the three classic albums, and tend to focus on real world problems including war, child abuse, problems with the court system, bad parenting etc. Metallica maintains a good variety of textures and tones throughout the album.

This is a good thing, mind you, since over an hour of that tempo would get tedious, and is essentially the way it was on all of their 80's albums.<br />This album has 2 weaker points, \\"Blackened\\" and \\"Eye of the Beholder\\".(Ride the Lightning had only 1, Escape, and Master of Puppets didn't have any, hence my determination that this album is the weakest among them) These are still 2 good songs, with much of their weakness coming from the production, but of course knowing that is the main problem doesn't actually make them any more enjoyable. The rest of the album kicks .... Pretty much everything else is a classic. \\"One\\" is probably their best song, perhaps the best metal song by anyone. \\"Dyer's Eve\\" is pure thrash power, and \\"Harvester of Sorrow\\" is their darkest, most intense song ever. The title track is more winding, progressive brilliance, like their two previous title tracks, and \\"To Live is to Die\\" is another great instrumental.<br />So, go buy this album.
B00006AW2M|5.0|I already have a review for the original CD release of this album for Amazon, but the remaster of this highly underrated<BR>album was so important that I feel it warrants another review.<BR>In short--get it *now*.  \\"Satanic Majesties\\" is an album of such dense layers of sound effects that it really deserves the best possible sound quality, which is what it finally receives here.<BR>No matter what you think of the album, it sounds almost brand new, with a clarity, crispness and rich aural sheen completely missing from the original CD.  This is much closer to the original vinyl, and I would even say superior, since there are sounds I had *never* heard before...\\"Sing This All Together\\", <BR>\\"In Another Land\\" and \\"Gomper\\" sound particularly strong, with the stereo separation making it sound as if the entire band is playing in your living room.<br />I have always had a soft spot in my heart for \\"Satanic\\"--sure, it sounds nothing like The Stones, but that's part of what gives it its charm.  It certainly sounds almost nothing like \\"Sgt.Pepper\\", either, although it is clearly influenced by it. Songs like \\"Citadel\\", \\"2000 Light Years\\" and \\"Gomper\\" are much darker, heavier and more experimental than anything on \\"Pepper\\", and the catchy riffs and hooks *are* still there.  There's only one thing missing in the new CD remaster and that is the 3-D effect on the cover art, although the rest of the packaging is up to par.
B000059Z8J|5.0|The potential for disaster was huge with the big screen adaption of Superman, but director Richard Donner knew what he was doing here, and what we have left is a super epic of one of the most popular and recognized super heroes of all time.  Christopher Reeve was the perfect choice to don the red, blue, and yellow suit, and Gene Hackman's campy yet hilarious portrayal of Lex Luthor is fantastic.  The special effects, while may look a bit dated, still look pretty good and hold up today.  This Special Edition DVD is worth noting as well, the screen tests are great to watch, and sometimes just plain hilarious.  All in all, even if you don't like the Superman comics, you will find something to love with this epic film.
0789723107|5.0|Short and to the point, this book is the place to start for anyone involved in any way with websites of any type, from simple personal homepages to massive e-commerce sites. It doesn't require any technical knowledge, and it sets your priorities in order, particularly the importance of user testing (which, for low-rent developers, can be done even more cheaply than Krug suggests - just substitute paper-and-pencil for the video camera). Read this first, and once you've digested it, move on to Jakob Nielsen's Designing Web Usability for more detail.
0525946284|4.0|The story of this book is amazing, even if the story is true, it has parts that was invented by the writer, it has to many coincidences that definitely can't be real, but this parts make you keep reading all the time and wondering what will be on the next page.<br />The way that all the bad guys died is like an american movie, the worst they did in life, the worst they died, but that is part of the novel, you will never know if this part (the dead of the bad guys) is true.<br />There were two things that I didn't like, and of course you will never know if was true or not:<br />1) The husband of Felicity tells her that he love her and he will never had another affair, and at the first opportunity he decides to &quot;save&quot; his girlfriend and put in danger his wife's life, I said &quot;save&quot; because he knew (when you read the book you will understand) that his girlfriend and he will be dead after Dieter find his wife.<br />2) This point is why I put just 4 stars to this book, WHY? when a writer has an excellent book, an excellent thriller, an excellent everything, has to write the last chapter that does not has to do anything with the rest of book and that takes the smile from your face when you finish the book?
B00004XONN|5.0|I honestly cannot get past the first 5 notes of &quot;Everything In Its Right Place&quot; without giving it a 5 star review. I had no idea what I was in for when I first popped this into my CD player. By then end of the album, I gave this album MORE than 5 stars. More like 5 to the 67854785th power. I can't even explain this album.... all I can say is, buy it, listen to it from cover to cover with an open mind and avoid listening to it at 3 AM. It changed my life forever.<BR><BR><BR><BR>Still hard to believe that an album like this actually TOPPED the charts...
0451169514|3.0|I am a 15 year old reader and 'IT' was the first book by Stephen King which I read. It was amazing at first, totally living up to my expectations, until I read the last 200 or so pages. I wasn't put off by the great length of the book, in fact I loved books which allowed time to develop the characters and storylines. Initially, I was drawn into the world of the 7 children, and adults, battling the unknown horror of IT, and the book was a constant page-turner. The characters had depth and realism, and the monster was pleasingly frightening. The mystery of IT is the book's strengh. I turned the pages, impatient to discover what It is when It is finally revealed in its true form.<br />But the book could not maintain its high standard and began to fizzle out. One of the major downfalls of the book was King's portrayal of the only female character of the book, Beverly. I tolerated the character at first, enduring her whiny and irritating depiction. But when I read the disturbing account of the group sex in the sewers involving her and six boys, all around 11 years old, I just couldn't take the book seriously. I am not sensitive towards sex, but the account obviously served no purpose in the book and only degraded and insulted the previous splendour of the story. Not to mention the lame ending, involving the children fighting IT off by shouting at IT and an even lamer explanation of IT's origins, something about the Turtle vomiting out the universe(???). Nothing made any sense in the last hundred pages and it seemed like King had written it just so that he could finally finish the book. I felt that all of the important 800 pages of build-up were for nothing, and was deeply disappointed. However, the book, overall, is worth reading. But I suggest you stop reading three-quarters of the way through so that the story won't be spoilt by the ill-written ending.
0783225547|4.0|Dantes Peak is a top grade adventure film with good characters and brilliant special effects. The chemistry between the two leads is very good and the production values are outstanding. If only they could have edited out the one absurd scene where they drive across a lava flow. They wouldn't have gotten five feet and it makes the lead character look incredibly stupid to even try. But apart from this,the movie is eccellent and this DVD had loads of extras,including a 60 minute documentary and a commentary that isn't available in other regions.Well worth buying.
630460291X|5.0|The first time I saw this film, I was around 15 and I loved it. Now at 26, I am extremely annoyed to find critics complaining about the authenticity of the film and how unrealistic it was, Kevin Costner's accent and so on. The bottom line is : There probably was no Robin Hood so therefore you can make up any story you want and I, fortunately, am not one of those people who have their eyes stuck to the screen trying to point out every mistake, every pixel that isn't in it's place and every sound that is a little out of tune. I bought Robin Hood, on DVD, about a month ago, and it was definately worth the money I paid for it. In my eyes, at least, Robin Hood will remain a classic.
B000066NW0|5.0|I bought this Album after i saw the video for complicated on TRL and because i couldn't buy the single in Ireland i bought the album instead:<BR>1. Losing grip: This a really rocky song and completely differnt to complicated. i love this song because its really good to sing along to when i'm angry. 9/10<br />2.Complicated: when i first heard this song i loved but i don't think it's the best song on the album.9/10<br />3. Sk8er Boi: i love this song. it has a real punk rock vibe to it which i'm really into at the moment.  it's very different to the rest of the album which is also good. 10/10<br />4. I'm with You: this is far from the best song on the album. it's a slow song which kind of picks up towards the end. it's not really my thing although it is listenable. 7/10<br />5. Mobile: i like this song. it has an upbeat guitary sound and a catchy chorus that i was still singing hours after i'd finished listening to it.9/10<br />6. Unwanted: the first time i heard this song i hated it but each time therafter it grew on me and now i love it. it's kind of like losing grip but much angrier. i can really relate to the lyrics in this track which is probably why it's grown on me.8/10<br />7. Tomorrow : this song has good message about taking each day as it comes. The chorus is nice. 7/10<br />8. tracks 8,9,10,11 are my faves. Anything But Ordinary: the chorus on this track is so catchy. it's about being yourself. 10/10<br />9. Things i'll never say: this is my favourite track on the album. i can really relate to this song and this whole track is sooo catchy. i love it 10/10.<br />10. my world : this is another poppy and catchy song and my second favourite on the album. 10/10<br />11. Nobody's Fool: avril talks/raps the verses in this song. when i first heard it i thought it was a bit (bad) but the catchy chorus has made me grow to love this track. 10/10<br />i don't like the last two tracks at all. it might have something to do with track order because usually when i get totrack 11 i just turn it off or go back to the beginning again. i think everyone should have a copy of this album there's something for everyone on it. if you like Michelle Branch than you'll probably like this too as a lot of these songs have that sound.
B000002H97|3.0|This is Metallica's 5th full legnth disc. Alot of the <BR>early die hards were disappointed on this one. I know when<BR>it came out I was. However I'm of two minds on this disc. <BR>What's good about this: Better production than ...And Justice<BR>for All. ALOT Better! Good heavy guitar sound at points. The<BR>drum production is really good. James vocals are great when<BR>he does his traditional vocals. Kirk Hammett does some very memorable guitar solos.It's Not the most technical noodling but <BR>effective. This is catchy record, very catchy! Jason Newsted is actually heard on bass. The bad: Lars Ulrich is possibly one of my fave drummers of the 80's, by ...And Justice... it was Lars setting the standard of progressive drummers to follow beside Dave Lombardo(ex-Slayer),and other thrash masters. I don't think he has/or had the fastest feet on drums but possibly the most accurate and innovative. Then he drums on this record and he literally turns into the Phil Rudd(Ac/Dc) of drummers. So <BR>boring that he sounds dead. This is just not very original it just sounds like a simplified version of past lps. It shows a softer, kinder to the ears Metallica that reinvented themselves<BR>into something resembling soft rock at times. Best songs: \\"The Struggle Within\\"(reminds me of something off RIde the Lightning in the intro),\\"Through the Never\\"(interesting song,off kilter,but<BR>still catchy),\\"Sad but True\\"(heavy!)and\\"Holier Than Thou\\"(aggresive,good lyrics,this one kinda stands out.) There's<BR>alot that's seriously overplayed on here and I never quite understood what made this one of their biggest ones to date. I don't<BR>think it's their worst but it is the begining of the end for them.

0671799320|5.0|This book is nothing short of extraordinary. It takes you through a step-by-step history of oil not only in the United States but the world, and does so without boring you like some history books do. It gives you an intimate portrait of the leaders of the petroleum revolution, such as John D. Rockefeller, actually letting you see their personalities and how they operated. The Prize is the perfect title for this book, as that is exactly what it is.
B00005R2IS|5.0|Mel Gibson is without a doubt one of Hollywood's greatest actors, Mad Max was one of Gibson's first movies, & you can tell by watching it that his success since(20 years to be exact) has not spoiled him, In this he is Max, a cop of the future where society has broken down, & he is one of the last remaining cops patroling the savage streets, we learn that Max has a family & tries for the most part to be normal in a burnt out wasteland, the film begins with an outlaw named Knightrider who has broken loose & has killed a fellow officer, he is pursued by two cop cars, & is being chased, Max's partner Jim Goose soon joins the pursuit, but he & the two cars end up wrecking thus knocking them out of the pursuit, Goose then radios Max who the Knightrider will soon be approaching, to begin pursuit, which he does...with intensity, causing the Knightrider to crash & burn, he is killed as Max watches from a distance, what makes this film good is its direction, we see the friendship between Goose & Max that is as good as any friendship, Max's boss is interesting to watch as you can see he cares about his men, we are then introduced to the Knightrider's motorcycle buddies who have come to get revenge on those responsible, mostly the cops & Max himself, Toecutter, the gang's leader is fun to watch, he is without a doubt a humorous villian, you almost can't help but like him, as he talks poetically about the Knightrider, his loyalty to his fallen comrade is deep as he & his men soon terrorize anyone & everyone, thus bringing the attention of Max & Goose who soon arrest Johnny, the inexperienced member of the group, it is clear that a woman has been raped & Johnny has stayed behind awaiting capture, or has he, it never becomes clear, the rape has a vengeful effect on Goose who refuses to release Johnny after his bail has been set & he is to be released, Goose is soon restrained as Johnny agitates him, promising revenge, Goose is soon set up & is burned beyond recognition, Max feeling the loss takes time off with his wife & child, but soon he & his family are stalked by the group & his wife is soon confronted alone & intimidated, she escapes but she along with their child is run down, with the loss of his family & friend, Max becomes a lost soul & lone vigilante, who uses his wit & skill to exact revenge in his new Interceptor Police car, that has a turbo blast that creates unbelieveable speed, when Toecutter, Bubba, & Johnny are the only ones left, they set up Max & gun him down, Bubba soon attempts to finish him, but is killed instead, Johnny then flees the scene, as does Toecutter, Max then goes after Toecutter in a rather satisfying scene in which Max uses his Turbo power to pursue Toecutter in a tense scene that has Max with nothing but vengence in his eyes, Toecutter is soon killed as is Johnny, & has Max fleeing into the wasteland that would continue in \\"The Road Warrior\\" a great follow-up, this film had a cult following & it is a true gem, movies like this just don't get made anymore, & the original Aussie dialogue is much more surreal than the dubbed version, & Mel Gibson proved in this film the star he would later become, this new DVD is sharp & clear, & is definately a must for any Mel Gibson fan!!!!!
B000003TA4|1.0|This music is just yelling and screaming it's ridiculuos. and angry and not healthy for human souls. And really really loud, so loud it makes Led Zeppelin seem like Kenny G. Amy Grant, Elton John, Eric Clapton, U2 and Garth Brooks are much more talented than this loud garbage
0792844890|3.0|This very, very comedic movie is mostly trying to make spoofs of other classics. Everyone on the \\"good\\" side was a horrible actor. Their horrible acting job, suprisingly didn't make the movie funny at all. The only thing that makes this movie well worth your time is the subtle (and not-so subtle) wisecracks (some against other movies). 90% of the good jokes come from the bad guys, Skoob and Helmet. <br />Corny ending, bad acting... who cares? You will CRACK UP!!!!
B0000029GA|5.0|This album is a classic.  NY State of Mind is probably one of the best hip hop songs EVER.
B000002IZ4|5.0|When Stone Temple Pilots released Purple in the early '90s they, found themselves pigeonholed by the era: &quot;grunge&quot; (an unfortunate term) was the order of the day and STP were laid side by side with the likes of Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains and Nirvana in the music press.<br />Purple, the Stone Temple Pilots' sophomore release, was a huge hit in its day, becoming the unquestionable soundtrack for an era, several of the tracks instantly recognizable to this day. Audiences loved and love them. Critics, however, have been slower to catch up.<br />Nearly a decade on, it's clear that STP isn't and never was a &quot;grunge&quot; band at all; Stone Temple Pilots are a classic rock and roll outfit in the grand tradition, more Zeppelin than Vedder no matter how you slice it. And Purple, far from the pop-grunge fad it had been labeled, has aged better than most any other music of the era. With the spectre of the &quot;grunge press&quot; gone, music critics can now see what the fans saw all along: Purple is a modern classic, one of the greatest rock and roll albums since the rock and roll era began -- with playful, intelligent yet touching and reflective lyrics and a set of monster hooks and subtle riffs that make the album instantly listenable and eminently hum-alongable. There isn't an ounce of filler to be found on Purple.<br />Since Purple, the Stone Temple Pilots have continued on to produce a string of quality albums on the forefront of music industry relevance that the critics have increasingly warmed to, without once dropping a dud on the market. Purple remains the disc that really launched them, an album that defined a generation and found STP, one of the quintessential rock acts of our time, finding their voices.
6305508550|5.0|From Director Mike Judge, Office Space is one of the greatest comedies out there! Loved it so much. You relate to charactors, you hate the boss, Jennifer Aniston's charactor you fall in love with, and lets not forget Milton(Oh my God, Milton... he's the best charactor out of the entire movie!) Well directed and well acted and well casted. This movie is a must for ...everybody that works!

B00004T9UF|5.0|the next album from the infamous Emenem called the Marshall Mathers LP is the most straight forward and is probably most controversal rap albums of the century! The album is always ahead of everything(knowing that having homophobic lyrics will disturb many) and Emenem was always right about everything he said and was always dead on about his issues. Just a great album! for the people who liked his first cd... will love this one!
B0000507PC|5.0|The one and only reason I wanted to view this movie is because of Tobey Maguire.  So I put the movie in expecting to fast forward to just the scenes with him in them.  The more I watched the more attached I became.  The story is so compelling it pulls anyone into it.  The book wasn't so great but the movie is a MUST SEE.  I loved every moment of it.  I was even sad to take it back to the movie rental store in which I had gotten it.  So not even 24 hours later I had purchased the film.  It is one of the best i've seen.  Definately one of my favorites in my collection.

0738206679|5.0|The author explores the wide variety of social and biological activities that make up the world we live in.  Including among these, of course, is the ever ubiquitous World Wide Web.  The thread of the book, is his contention that there is a common theory of 'networks' that applies to all of these seemingly disparate fields.<br />  The author draws upon a wide variety of studies and research, including, but not limited to, his own.  It is fascinating to read discussions of how Hollywood actors are connected to each other, followed by a discussion of cellular biology, and realize that there is a rich commonality between them in how they connect and behave.  The author carefully and methodically takes us through example after example as he explores network theory, and its recent expansion due to new discoveries in the field.<br />  The books is very readable for those with limited experience in math and science.  For those that wish to go in more depth, there is a large body of footnotes and references.<br />  Highly recommended for anyone remotely interested in science and the connectedness of the world.  Maybe John Muir was right: everything *is* connected to everything else!
B00000F3KL|5.0|The presentation of war movies has over the decades changed from the early thirties and forties movies that focused on ethnic soldiers with clear personalities to more recent films which emphasize homogeneous soldiers who react collectively to a chaotic cauldron of gore.  SAVING PRIVATE RYAN began the trend of dramatizing American GIs in mortal and graphic combat with an enemy that differed from them mostly in the color of uniform. BLACK HAWK DOWN continues the evolution of filming up-close combat against an enemy that is far less civilized than the Germans in 1944.  <BR>     Most critics of BLACK HAWK DOWN describe the situation that led to the storming of the hotel that was supposed to contain Somali warlord Aidid.  Director Jerry Bruckheimer faithfully records the tragic collapse of the mission that was to last no more than 30 minutes.  Instead, the hundred or so Rangers and Delta Force soldiers found themselves fighting thousands of heavily armed Somali supporters of Aidid.  The movie is replete with countless technical images of cinematic virtuosity that place the audience right there on the screen.  Yet, as I watched BLACK HAWK DOWN for the second time, I tried to look beyond the experiences and viewpoints of the American soldiers, no mean feat there, since their actions against the Somalis and interactions with each other carried the viewer in lockstep with them.  Instead, I paid attention to the native Somalis, most of whom formed a collective and faceless foe who reminded me of the way that the Japanese in World War II movies and the Vietnamese in the Vietnam conflict were portrayed.  The Somalis were divided into two distinct groups: those street level thug types who did the fighting and dying and the upper echelon leaders who are etched as corrupt and evil betrayers of their own.  Consider the parallel scenes of the American capture of a lower ranking Somali warlord at the beginning of the movie and the later capture of an American helicoptor pilot by hordes of crazed Somali militia.  The captured Somali warlord was treated with respect and accorded unusual good care by his American captors.  His response is to show his petty arrogance by blowing cigar smoke into the face of his interrogators.  The captured American pilot is right away clubbed and mistreated before being released eleven days later.  These twin scenes capture the film's subtext that the American concept of war and warmaking is not shared by the rest of the world.  Our world of war is the Geneva convention.  The rest of the world, as symbolized by the Somalis, is based on killing as negotiation.  Massive losses do not deter them from killing us.  Nineteen American deaths were quite sufficient for President Clinton to pull American forces out of Somalia.  BLACK HAWK DOWN, then, serves to remind us that traditional American concepts such as the value of the life of one individual are not shared by many other cultures, and that in our haste and anger to lash out we must not forget that the film's oft repeated motto 'Leave no one behind' is all that keeps our sanity when confronted by such nonstop atrocities as our boys found that one day in Mogadishu.

B000002AGB|5.0|After being booked as headliners for the two great Rock 'n' Roll festivals of 1969, \\"The Who\\" were immediately re-booked as headliners for the 1970 Isle Of Wight festival. Over the previous 18 months \\"The Who\\" had released two milestones albums in the double concept album \\"Tommy\\" and the fantastically raw \\"Live At Leads\\". \\"Tommy\\" took on a life of its own and is still on Broadway as a stage musical. The film version starring Roger Daltrey by Ken Russel is a classic of its kind.<br />\\"Live At Leeds\\" showed the world for the first time what they were, a full throttled, full ahead Rock 'n' Roll band. \\"Live At Leeds\\" has to be in any true rock fans top 3 live albums of all time, and since the advent of C.D, has been released in expanded version, stretching it from its original 40 minutes to the whole show at nearly two hours.<br />So why would you want to get yourself a copy of a set recorded a year later?? Well, simple really, it's longer, better, faster, funnier and by way more furious, which, if you review the circumstances, is quite surprising. Everything that could go wrong at the Isle Of Wight had gone wrong. Fences were broken down to let the audience in free, and there were terrible fights between the heavies of the seventies, and the peace loving hippies, of the sixties, firmly marking the end of an era. John Entwistle had changed into his brand new stage gear of a black body stocking with a human skeleton painted on it, only to find that it was so tight he couldn't sit down. He had to remain standing for 4 hours before hitting the stage. This delay was caused by the band schedule running 4 hours late, so not going on at 11.00 p.m. as expected \\"The Who\\" didn't get on to play until 3.00 a.m. on Sunday morning.<br />Under these circumstances it's incredible that they turned on such a show. Bursting straight into John Entwistles \\"Heaven & Hell\\", \\"The Who\\" immediately demonstrated what magnificent musicians they were, and after a year on the road there wasn't a tighter band in the world. Although you maybe buying material you have bought before in one form or another, never will you have heard it in such magnificence. Don't think twice about shelling out for this. No other recording shows \\"The Who\\" in the entirety of their talents. Pete Towshend at his most explosive after the tragic loss of Hendrix, and Eric Clapton ,going into voluntary seclusion. He was probably carrying the mantle of most innovative Rock 'n' Roll guitarists in the world. Listening to him leading the band through the shattering Rock 'n' Roll medley at the end of the set is nothing short of jaw dropping. John Entwistle holding the whole band musically together with maximum Ox-ness. Keith Moon, at the peak of fitness after a year on the road, plays with an exuberance only he could summon up and few drummers then or since have hit the drums harder. Roger Daltrey had by now become the ultimate showman and his long fringed jacket had become The Who's trademark. He sung every song as if he'd lived everyone of them. How his voice was still in tune after two hours is a true wonder.<br />After this set \\"The Who\\" went back into the studio to record \\"Who's Next\\". The live set was completely revamped and this was the last time that the original \\"Who\\" were able to play the whole of Tommy live. What a monster the rather sterile studio recording became on the stage, Daltrey and Towshend bringing it to a shattering conclusion with \\"We're Not Going To Take It\\". After this it's a toss up between who is having a better time, the audience or the band, as they go into a 25 minute encore, swapping between classic Rock 'n' Roll, and their own compositions, brought to a conclusion by the sound of the band self destructing and destroying all their equipment. A great end to a great concert. Probably after six hours allowing \\"The Ox\\" to strip off and sit down. Rock music at its ultimate best.<br />Mott the Dog.ghter band in the world.

B0000636UN|4.0|Sheryl Crow is clearly one of the most talented singer/songwriters to emerge during the alterna-rock era of the early 1990s. (Who could forget the almost daily airings of &quot;All I Wanna Do&quot; on MTV's &quot;Alternative Nation?)  She's been missing for a while, but she's back with a vengeance.  And she's back showing she can still write good songs.  Her albums tend to mix radio hits  with more deliberative works, and this is no exception.   &quot;Soak Up the Sun&quot; is worth the purchase, especially since the CD version seems to be a little longer than what's been played on the radio this summer. It's become the quintessential song of the summer of '02, and a worthy one at that, with follow up single &quot;Steve McQueen&quot; showing this album has staying power.  The only complaint I have is there seem to be a few too many languid songs, which, while well-written can sometimes be a drag by their nature, unless you, too, are in a brooding mood.  But that aside, the clever, to-the-point writing we expect from Sheryl Crow is here. Her sound is still everything you'd expect it to be. And she's still gonna be around for a while, as the strong airplay of the hit singles has demonstrated.
B000002JNG|5.0|This is a very solid effort from Robert Plant.  Many of the songs here totally rock out while at the same time maintaining their own individuality.  No two songs sound the same - a great quality to be sure.<br />My least favorite song is the opener \\"Hurting Kind (I´ve Got My Eyes On You).\\" It´s pretty much a straight-up rocker, which is fine, but not so interesting.  If you love \\"Tall Cool One\\" or, say, \\"Radar Love\\" then you´ll love this one.  The next two are more interesting.  \\"Big Love\\" has a swinging swagger and \\"S S S & Q\\" rocks hard with attitude and pleading sexuality.  You might not want to play either in front of your girlfriend if she´s a die-hard feminist, know what I mean?  <br />From there we hear a beautiful, mostly acoustic number \\"I Cried\\" which also rocks out at one point.  \\"She Said,\\" \\"Nirvana\\" and \\"Tie Dye on the Highway\\" are all excellent, sophisticated rockers.  \\"Your Ma Said You Cried in Your Sleep Last Night\\" sounds like it might be a slight nod to Elvis, another with plenty of attitude and swagger.  \\"Anniversary\\" is a slower, synth-propelled song that soon builds with a drum march and guitar solo - very compelling.  The acoustic \\"Liars Dance\\" is one of the best on the album and recalls Led Zeppelin (certainly more than anything else on this album at least).  The last song, \\"Watching You\\" is quite intense with heavy synth, guitars, a forboding, steady drum pattern and Middle Eastern influences.<br />Plant´s singing is awesome throughout and his trademark sounds (righteous guitars, synths and female background vocals) are in full effect.  Excellent production, with not one misplaced note.  May be one of his best.
B00005RFAI|4.0|Pink hair aside, the artist known as Pink has managed to pen some very impressive to-the-beat songs that are sophisticated enough to prove you can't judge a book by its cover.  These songs are often very angry, yet set to catchy music and with strong production values. This is more than just sampling. And the songs range from telling someone off, like &quot;Just Like a Pill,&quot; to a child's story of begging for peace, &quot;Family Portrait. &quot; And Pink can even pull off an impressive duet with Steven Tyler.  I'm in my mid-30s and found this album enjoyable. I'm not sure how many other current releases aimed at the youth audience would be able to do that. It's definitely a keeper.
B000002J09|4.0|Most people buy this album for the seminal Stairway to Heaven.  And how can you not love it?  A beautiful flow from slow moving to catchy to a hard rocker!  Of course, a lot of epic songs were coming out back then (Hotel California, Light My Fire) but most any rock fan will list Stairway as the superior one, the Zepic.  If you've never heard it (which is quite hard) I'm not saying you will fall in love the first time you hear it, it takes multiple listenings before its magic is fully weaved on you and trust me, you will be humming it word for word before you know it.<br />Rock and Roll is also a classic, one I even requested at my prom.  Black Dog is a lot of fun (a great opener) and Battle of Evermore is cool.  So in short, the first four tracks are what make this album unique.  The latter half makes good background or party music, but I don't think is as great as the start.  People who had the original LP or cassette may disagree with me, but on the CD it is quite annoying for Stairway to be immidiately followed by the weird Misty Mountain Hop.  It is a bad transition.<br />However, the first half of the CD is truly legendary.
B00005OAIE|4.0|So several months after its debut and after the saturation play of &quot;No Such Thing&quot; on V-H1, I finally yielded and bought the CD, thinking it would be one of those albums where all the songs sound the same and it would have just one good song, it's smash hit single.  I was wrong. While the songs do share a common sound that evokes memories of Seals &amp; Croft or England Dan &amp; John Ford Coley, they do range in style enough to keep you thoroughly entertained.  I have no idea how old John Mayer is, but he's clearly wise beyond his years as these lyrics indicate.  Unlike many of the equally precocious alterna-rockers, these songs are able to dispense wisdom without a heavy dose of anger.  This is a very promising artist who, if he continues to get support from his label and programmers, can look forward to a long and impressive career.
B00000INEX|5.0|Before I had my beloved baby, I swore I would never ever use a video or a TV to babysit her.  ANd well, no matter how I rationalize it, Baby Bach is a video and I did use it -- a lot when I was so completely overwhelmed and at wits end during those early months.  My child would sit in her little Chicco mama sofa rocker and watch.  My daughter, who is now 6 months, loved this thing when she was 2, 3, and 4 months.  It was a part of my bedtime routine.  SHe was completely enthralled.  Completely.  Loved it.  Interestingly, I watched it myself, enthralled several times.   <br />Basically, this lady seems to have gone in her attic and gotten some used toys, videotaped them to music and put her two little girls in there every now and then for cuteness.<br />Now that I have some mastery over motherhood, I do not \\"use\\" this tape so much.  While my daugheter still watches it every couple of weeks, she seems now to be \\"studying\\" it -- not just looking at it.  But, she usually bores with it after about 15 minutes.<br />I will buy the others, too.<br />Buy it.  Baby will love it.
0316666343|5.0|An avid reader, I began reading The Lovely Bones ready to critique. But this critical gaze I soon lost track of, because  reading The Lovely Bones transcends clever language and even beautiful metaphors. It is an experience. It reads like a pofoundly adult fairy tale - the events that take place are not what we might call real-Susie's heaven, out of body experiences, and the more than perfect use of the icycle. And then again, it's oh so real -the quiet sad longing of Susie in heaven, the multi-faceted portrayal of the mother, the beautiful strengths and weaknesses of the Salmon family and even the death-obsessed Ruth. This play between the \\"real\\" and the \\"unreal\\", like the split between heaven and earth is both charged and calming where the mere act of being alive becomes a magical experience. A miracle.
B00000K2SC|2.0|I finally got around to watching \\"The Matrix\\" a couple of years  after everyone else.  I give it a mixed review.  The notion of manufactured reality was its strong point.  A weak point, however, was the film's anarcho-messianic theme.  In between these poles, there was a rather ho-hum formulaic plot, akin to that of, say, \\"Top Gun.\\"  I must note that there are strong resemblances to a film which I'll bet few Matrix enthusiasts have ever watched.  That is Alexandro Jodorowsky's \\"The Holy Mountain\\" (1973).  Just about everything in \\"The Matrix\\" that is disgusting to watch seemed borrowed from the Jodorowsky film, as well as Neo's transformation into some sort of messiah at the hands of a magus figure. (\\"The Holy Mountain\\" may be available on some web auction sites - check it out.)  The music at the end was good, but that's not to say I want to hear it booming out of some teenager's car every time he drives by my house.  Some rules, some walls are not so bad.

B000063DI8|4.0|Just because maiden didn't make a record as some fans wanted doesn't make it a bad album.  Maiden plays raw, and this one is raw, ofcourse, somewhere in time and seventh son are masterpieces, but NPFTD is a good jump back to the basics, the roots....  I'm a maiden fan, this one falls short compared to \\"Somewhere..\\", but only by a bit, with the exception of \\"the assassin\\", this album is good...really good stuff
B00005OAIE|3.0|I heard some cuts from a John Mayer CD and ran down to the  store to get my copy.  I bought &quot;No Room For Squares&quot; because it was the only Mayer CD offered and had the songs titles I recognized. I had been duped.  &quot;No Room ...&quot; has none of the feeling or definition of &quot;Inside Wants Out&quot; (which is the acoustic CD I had first heard).  The mix on &quot;No Room...&quot; is so schlocky it takes away all the effect of Mayer's great music.  I would definintely recommend &quot;Inside Wants Out&quot;, not &quot;No Room...&quot;

6305428050|5.0|Elisabeth Shue is Chris Parker, a normal seventeen year old who begins the night with an ordinary babysitting job, sitting two normal suburban children, Sarah and Brad. After her friend - Brenda (Penelope Anne Miller) -- calls from a bus station in the city (Chicago), stating that she has runaway from home and needs Chris' support, Chris takes off to the city with Brad, Sarah, and Brad's friend, Daryl. What should have been a 30 minute ride to the bus station turns into a run through the city as the group of four encounter car thieves, weird mechanics, and a place where nobody leaves without singing the blues.<br />         Adventures in Babysitting is THE fun movie of the 80s. Well, THE fun movie that doesn't contain little monsters, goonies, or Tom Hanks. As we follow the quartet through Chicago, we are introduced to hilarious scenes and crazy antics as they get themselves in the middle of a car heist, a cheating wife and her enraged husband, and many more. I must say that one of the biggest highlights of the film is the Blues Bar scene where Elisabeth Shue and the kids absolutely have to sing before leaving the bar. It's great.<br />         The films is full of great characters. Elisabeth Shue is vibrant as Chris Parker, the babysitter gal. Her interaction with the kids was great, and she handled her leading status with ease. Maia Brewton is little Sarah who offers a lot of the laughs in the movie. She was awesome - I wonder where she is now? Keith Coogan and Anthony Rapp (Rent! Mark in Rent! I love Rent!) are Brad and Daryl, and both stay true to their roles and make them entertaining. But did anyone else want to occasionally strangle Anthony Rapp for that laugh?! We also see the likes of a young Penelope Anne Miller and Vincent D'Onofrio in cameo roles. Although Miller's role is a bit bigger, and very hilarious. <br /> Although the DVD release is bare, without even a nice trailer to suit a fan, we do get a nicely widescreen anamorphic presentation with nice picture (Although there are signs of an aged film) and good audio. <BR>         <BR>         Adventures In Babysitting is definitely one of my favorite 80s movies. For the fact that it's a great, fun, and crazily adventurous comedy.
0790729350|5.0|Ok, the music is the greatest...it's true.  However,<BR>this chronicle reveals what was great about the \\"hippy\\" movement<BR>and the seeds of its undoing. Perhaps better than any social movement, the hippies were, for a while, successful in \\"deserting\\" capital.  Rather than take capitalism head on and butting heads, they just deserted and created an alternative space.  It certainly had the establishment frightened and probably came closer than any attempt since Post WWII of bringing a collapse<BR>to capitalism in the west (save, perhaps the events of May 68 in Paris).<br />However there were, so it seems, the idealistic hippies and the stragglers who later joined, exclusively for the drugs and free love.  These latter were operating in as much a \\"get over\\" mode as the greediest capitalist and had little if any idealism.<BR>This phenomenon is superbly described in Jay Steven's <BR>\\"Storming Heaven, LSD and the American Dream\\".<br />Very telling is an interview with a young man at Woodstock.<BR>He came to party and get laid.  He wanted \\"to do do his own thing\\".<BR>The journalist then asks the young man, \\"What about Nixon, he just wants to do his own thing, too?\\"  Silence.<br />A good follow up to this movie would be PT Anderson's \\"Boogie Nights\\".  Between the two, we can see how the lack of serious political consciousness among some of the \\"unidealistic\\" hippies combined with the \\"do your own thing\\" mentality entrained the Me generation 70s and the free-market corporatism of the 80s to today.<br />This film is a keeper!<br />Thomas Seay
B00006CXSS|5.0|These movies made my life stop everytime I watched them. The accurate portral of the WWII in every episod was incredible. The Bastogne episods were amazing to watch as it showed the soilders fight for their country in some of the worst conditions ever. Every episod was extremely well done and they all covered the most important aspects of the war. I have been waiting for this DVD for a long time. I only wish there were more then ten episods.
0380820846|4.0|I buy her books sight unseen.  This may not be the BEST Bridgerton story but it is still Great.  I laughed on the first page and did not stop.  Penelope and Colin's story is great.  They both have known each other for ages and Penelope has loved him since she was 16.  Now she is 28 and he is 33 and things just come together and they see each other how they really are.  This was a fun story and the characters were great.  You get to see all kinds of old friend and family and see how they have been changing and growing. You do not want to miss this one.  And oh you get to find out who Whistledown is.  I won't tell you who since that is half the fun of reading the story!
B000069AUI|5.0|I think it's next to impossible to capture the way music can move people with words.  So I won't even try to do that.<br />Let me say this about A Rush of Blood to the Head: It's a wonderful follow up to Parachutes.  In some places, it's brilliant.  In others, it's happy and an easy listen.  Overall, it's a splendid work of art.<br />You won't be disappointed.  Be sure to check out the track &quot;God Put A Smile Upon Your Face&quot; as soon as possible.
B000069I1H|2.0|The comedic pairing of Eddie Murphy and Robert De Niro at first sounds like a good idea. And the premise of this film, mocking reality TV, namely cop reality shows, is promising. But this film doesn't take advantage of its potential and instead recycles old jokes. <br />Every once in awhile, something begins to shine out; a joke begins to develop or a commentary on the manipulation of truth in reality television, but just as you think this film might have a saving grace it buries the good ideas with the same bad jokes and sight gags that have been done in countless other brain-dead movies. <br />Having Murphy and De Niro on screen, though, is fun at times. In fact, when William Shatner is thrown into the mix, mocking his T.J. Hooker character by playing himself, the film starts take off. But Shatner's screen time is short, and before you know it, the film returns to a clichéd comedy.<br />The action mixed in the film is also boring. There was no life or energy to these scenes. Bad guys shoot at cops, cops shoot back. Cars launch in the air and burst into flames. No emotional involvement, no heart in your throat reaction. Just action that made me yawn and check the clock.<br />The film also doesn't seem to know how it wants to portray the real world of police. It opens with De Niro telling a classroom how real cops don't have a lot of shootouts, and cars don't blow up from being shot at. But a few minutes later, De Niro lands in a shootout with drug dealers, and throughout the film lands in one big shootout, blow up scene after another. This schizophrenic visualization of police work is confusing. Yes it is a comedy and doesn't necessary need to be believable, but it set up the rules of the world it takes place and then shows a world breaking all those rules. That's not a sign of comedy genius, that's a sign of poor filmmaking.<br />Showtime is worth a one time viewing for Shatner's self mocking character and a few laughs, but is otherwise a below average comedy.

0316666343|4.0|I really enjoyed this book!  It is written from the perspective of a murdered 14 year old girl, not an intellectual adult, so what she thinks and dreams about are appropriate for her age.  Susie tells her story as a 14 year old might, going back and forth in time, sharing details important to her. The suspense held my interest, yet details weren't so graphic and horrible to cause me to want to put it down.  It's refreshing to find an author who is willing to keep gore and bad language to a bare minimum; there are some of us who prefer not to feel disturbed. I was slightly disappointed that details weren't wrapped up more tidily in the end, but it made sense since Susie finally realized she had to sit back and watch earthly life unfold without her.
B000002W9P|2.0|With a name like \\"Helloween\\" I was suprised at how un-\\"hellish\\" this album really is.  This is my first Helloween purchase (based on reviews here at Amazon.com) so I've no knowledge of the rest of the band's work.  Still, I knew not to expect Slayer or something more traditionally understood as \\"speed metal,\\" but the overwhelming  bounciness and bubbly, utopian optimism in so much of Keeper...I completely threw me.  Lyrically, songs like \\"Future World\\" and \\"I'm Alive\\" stand out as the strangest of the the bunch, with lyrics such as \\"we all live in happiness, our life is full of joy\\" and \\"You just need a friend, together we will sing along.\\"  Huh?  I can't avoid mental images of motivational speakers and 12-step groups here.  The big \\"Halloween\\" song is perhaps the most musically interesting of the bunch, but its lyrics also seem aimed at a grade-school audience (why are Charlie Brown and Linus, icons of childhood Halloween experiences, in a song about a Celtic holiday?).  And yet this album is somehow heavy metal.  Like I said, I find this all very strange.  The accompanying music to most of these songs, while \\"speedy metal,\\" isn't really \\"speed metal\\" - way too many major keys, an element that also sounded very strange.  Finally, there's been much ballyhoo in these reviews about Keeper...I being a concept album, and I was initially attracted by that idea.  However, if this is a concept album, I seem to have completely missed the concept since the songs certainly don't seem to go together in any significant way (lyrically or musically).<br />While Keeper...I is certainly not a *terrible* album (and I'm looking forward to hearing Keeper...2), it's not at all as powerful or interesting as I thought it would be.
B000007T1M|5.0|It used to be, I would walk around school humming or singing Suggestions to myself, and people would just stare and think to themselves, \\"What the hell kinda music is he into?\\"  Now, in the era of Chop Suey!, Aerials, and Toxicity, when every Tom, Dick and Harry sings of self-righteous suicide, I find myself longing for the \\"old\\" System, when they were at their creative peak.<br />Now don't get me wrong--in no way am I putting down Toxicity, but it really grew boring after a month or so.  This album is timeless.  Like Aenima or Lateralus from Tool, it's a CD that I can pop in and listen to any time and really enjoy it.<br />Back in the old days (2000), System of a Down were a band with almost no radio airplay, and a ferocious cult following.  I am pleased to say I was a part of System's fan base before they were world-renowned.  My brothers and I, we were the only people on our block who knew about the band, and that was the way we liked it.<br />Then along came Chop Suey!, and every teenage girl at my school was melting over Serj Tankian.  I found the song enjoyable, but not half as engaging or entertaining as any of the songs on their self-titled debut.  It didn't have the high-pitched guitar and vocal squealing of Peephole, or the raw emotion and energy of Spiders, or the outright fun of songs like Sugar and Suite-Pee.  In fact, nothing about Toxicity quite matches System of a Down's work on their debut.  Toxicity is System's way, I think, of selling themselves to MTV, whether by design or happenstance.  This album, it seems, was a kick ...of avid fans of TRL.<br />This was the album that should have launched System of a Down into multi-platinum, multi-award winning status.  I would recommend buying this album before, or instead of, Toxicity.  It's a much more engaging musical experience that you won't regret.

B000002UYZ|5.0|There have been so many Beatles collections over the years, but the two volume set issued in 1973 is still the ultimate greatest hits package.  This set covers the early and middle years of the Beatles, from the freshness of the early hits, to more adventurous numbers such as Norwegian Wood and Eleanor Rigby, to timeless power pop classics like Day Tripper and Paperback Writer.  No matter how familiar the songs may be, it's still great to have them all together in this format. Ignore the scrambled together collections of recent years, go for the Red and the Blue!
B00006F83Y|5.0|QOTSA mix music's past while reaching for the future.  The CD starts out with a \\"radio dj\\" talking up the new QOTSA CD its blasts forward with \\"You Think I Ain't Worth A Dollar, But I Feel Like A Millionaire\\" and then takes a vicious turn into the Beatlesque \\"No One Knows\\".  I love the different \\"dj's\\" talking in between the songs.  The sequencing on Songs for the Deaf is amazing.  I don't know if it's intentional or not but Songs for the Deaf shows the listener (me) a sonic landscape that touches on all things good in rock and roll.  Dave Grohl reminds us why he is one of rocks best drummers.  Mark Lanegan's voice sounds like it was flown in from hell.  Josh & Nick created a CD that is not only genre defining if someone asks of the whole \\"stoner rock\\" sound but also created a great metal CD that is heavier and dirtier than anything that has come before it.  These guys sound like they busted their Asses on writing great songs and were smart enough to let the guest on the CD go wild in the studio.  Major labels do not release music like this anymore.  Monster Magnet beware, the bar has been raised considerably high with this release.  Fu Manchu is no longer a factor, as they seem to be spinning their wheels with the lame CD's they have thrown out there as of late.  QOTSA gets my vote as one of the top CD's for 2002.
B00005JKNF|3.0|Gosford Park is an interesting movie, it has the Upstairs Downstairs class depictions (though not as well done as the mini-series), good character development and a murder mystery which seems to be incidental to the whole film.  Some good performances from all, especially Maggie Smith and Emily Watson, who stood out for me.  My whole problem with this movie is that it takes so much time developing characters and setting the scene that the plot suffers as a result.  I found the whole movie somewhat static, and it lacked direction and focus.  I have never been a fan of Altman's, another director could have done better with this genre.  It's a good film, it just cries out for editing.
B00006FXB6|5.0|Black Sabbath SABBATH BLOODY SABBATH; Nirvana NEVERMIND; Soundgarden SUPERUNKNOWN.  If you'd been searching for the next classic in this sequence, look no further -- SONGS FOR THE DEAF is the business.<br />I know nothing about this band, having bought the CD purely on the strength of reviews in broadsheet newspapers.  I have not been disappointed.  The DVD leaves me not much wiser.  But those shrieking vocals, the wailing guitars, the light humour of the Clone Radio theme running through the CD, and the general quality of the songwriting ...  You just have to buy this one, particularly in its 'Limited Edition' format.
B000002UZ1|5.0|No matter how much music I've listened to over the years, I always come back to the &quot;blue&quot; album, in my opinion the best greatest hits package of all time.  From Sgt. Pepper, to Magical Mystery Tour, to the White Album, Abbey Road and Let It Be, it captures the best of the Beatles' later more creative period.  This was my introduction to A Day In the Life, I Am The Walrus, Don't Let Me Down, and other songs which I didn't know at the time.  Many years later I have bought all the records, heard all the songs a million times, but there's something about playing this at the right time that makes this the one I would take to a desert island with me. (if I could choose only one)<br />Any collection which has Hey Jude, Let It Be, Get Back, Strawberry Fields Forever and While My Guitar Gently Weeps on the same album is pretty damn great no matter how you look at it, and there's much more of course.   Over the years there have been other much hyped collections, but the red and blue albums are absolutely definitive.

B0000636UN|2.0|Sheryl Crow definitely did not put all of her effort into this album. The only songs I find good are (in order of &quot;goodness&quot;) Steve Mcqueen, Soak Up The Sun, Diamond Road, and Safe And Sound. The rest of the album is so blah and mediocre it is painful to sit through. Her 2nd is definitely her best effort and this one is behind her first album which I thought could have been a little more crafted better. Anyway, there is always the future for Sheryl to redeem her music and talent.
B000002AZ8|5.0|Ok, shine is probably not the best word, but this definitely displays the groups genious.  I absolutely find this to be the best Pearl Jam album out there.  Granted Ten is great and even Yield is excellent, but this album was kind of a step into the deep end for Pearl Jam.<br />Lyrically, this is the same Pearl Jam that started with Ten and Vs., but musically, the style changed.  The sound was less commercial, probably on purpose.  The result is a lesser known album the demonstrates that Pearl Jam can be diverse.<br />What I love best about the album is that sound.  It is much more rough, yet it is more cohesive, and in a way more intimate.  This is how I would expect the band to sound live in my garage.<br />This album is not the popular Pearl Jam.  It is the creative Pearl Jam.  Listen to almost any of the songs to hear what I mean.  Granted there are some oddballs on the album, but that just adds to the greatness.<br />Conclusion: a classic underrated album that may be better off that way.  However, it is definitely worth owning maybe even if you don't own any other Pearl Jam albums.
0201485672|5.0|I had done refactoring before I had read this book.But I didn't know until I read the book that the technique I was using is called refactoring.Thus all those people out there who are code reviewers/analysts should read this book to get a sense of uniformity.<BR>Martin Fowler has done a very good job in actually putting down some laws for OO programmers.But all these laws can also be applied to other languages(apart from Java in which most of the examples are written) too.Waste of effort in coding unnecessary lines can be prevented by following some of these laws.Code maintenance can be effectively made easy.Thus redevelopment time can be cut and therefore cost of design changes can be kept low in the long run.Repetition of code can be checked.<BR>The book tries to bring to a form of template some loose comments about doing redesigning and rengineering of code.Another good thing about the book is that it tries to keep the examples simple and easy.Thus fundamentals are conveyed easily.Some of the examples can be confusing but most of them are crystal clear.I would recommend this book to both experienced and novice programmers.It is an essential guide to experienced ones because they can reengineer their attitude towards coding while the beginners can learn good things at the start itself.People who like me(I did refactoring in a project using Borland Pascal 7 for a billing application)have done refactoring before can read the book to discuss and open their mind to new ideas and maybe suggest some new good examples.<BR>I would suggest that refactoring be followed in most B2B,B2E,B2C,J2EE projects mainly.Refactoring under structured methodology may not be very useful to do as it might not be very necessary and may not yield the same return it does in an OO  environment.But still,good habits are not bad to follow whatever the environment is.

B00005BCOK|4.0|This is a good scifi movie. Ofcourse there is logic problems. But generally it is good. The screenplay is written by MichealChricton. The story is about an adult amusement park that consist of Westworld, Romanworld, and Midevialworld. The guests are serviced by robots. Everyone is safe until things start to breakdown, Much like Chritcton's Later Jurrasic Park. Yul Brynner is perfect as the determined maniacal gunslinger.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park is an amazing album that is very hard to describe. The theme throughout Hybrid Theory is a melancholy one, sadness and anger released in an urban sound. It isn't techno and it isn't rap/rock. It's original. It has some rap in it, but only to tell a story or show feeling. The \\"techno\\" sound is actually just away of showing a hybrid between the soul and the machine. \\"In The End\\", one of their best songs exemplifys this in a perfect blend of piano, scratching, rapping, guitar, and vocals. <BR>     <BR>     Don't compare this to bands that aren't even worthy of comparison. They aren't Limp Bizkit (thank God) and they aren't techno(listen to Moby and you'll see that their is a really big difference)their notes are thought provoking, their beat is riveting, and their lyrics bend the mind.<br />     Buy this album. As long as you don't have it your missing out on something that is different then this \\"pop\\" oriented society.
B00005MP58|5.0|I normally hate remakes but this one had to be made. What can I say that hasn't been said already. Colin Firth is a national treasure. Jennifer Ehle is luminous.  The great Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson don't hold a candle to these two. As for the two other British television remakes, &quot;feh, pooey!&quot; I doubt this will ever be topped by anyone!
B00005JKG9|5.0|These days, so many lousy films are mass-produced that when you<br />see a great film, it really stands out. This film fits that<br />description. It's all-star cast is in top form, including Kevin Spacey as the office manager, long before he became famous in<br />'American Beauty.' What's really remarkable about 'Glengarry<br />Glen Ross,' is the fact that it takes place in so few locations.<br />The entire film is purely dialogue-based. It's perfectly cast,<br />from Jack Lemmon, as the pathetic has-been salesman to Al Pacino<br />as the office's top-notch, hot shot salesperson. Although, he's<br />only in the film for around five minutes, Alec Baldwin absolutely<br />steals the film with his 'motivating the troops' speech. He's the<br />absolute personification of a complete self-centered elitist. This is not a film you'll just want to rent, it's a must-own film, which, believe me, you'll memorize line for line.
0452282152|4.0|Certainly Ms. Chevalier got the details of 17th century Holland absolutely accurate but the people she creates are for the most part terribly fake. Too many characters were merely plot devices and do not seem psychologically valid human beings. The child Cornelia is like a cartoon villain, for instance. She may have been thoughtless and resented Griet, but her behavior had more in common with the Alexis character in \\"Dynasty\\" than it did with a child of such tender years. The relationship between Vermeer and Griet, though never consumated, is kind of skeevy; shades of that teacher in Seattle who had two children by her 11 year old student. By the time Vermeer decides to paint Greit, I wondered why she agreed considering how much extra trouble and work it meant for her. By the way, the the girl with the pearl earring actually was Vermeer's daughter. That makes a whole lot more sense than this novel does.Vermeer turns out to be a real big creep, which I doubt was actually true in real life. Given that he had 11 children, the reason for the low output of paintings is not surprising. It's a lot of work taking care of so many children, servants or no. I won't ruin the ending by revealing it here, but it makes absolutely no sense given his overt indifference to the way she is treated in his household. The major portion of this very slim narrative is about Griet's cleaning techniques and her trips to the market to buy either meat or herring. Frankly, given the circumstances of her employment, I imagine that the real-life Griet would have jumped at the chance to marry Peter instead of haranguing herself for being disloyal to her master.  I'm sure sexy Colin Firth will do an excellent job of bringing Vermeer to life in the movie version, but I don't look forward to watching a 40-plus man come on to a teenaged Scarlet Johansen as Griet.
B00003CXB2|5.0|It's a wonder this film was made at all.  As Omar Sharif famously said (I'm quoting from memory, but this is close): \\"Say you are the man with the money at the studio.  Someone comes to you and says he wants to make a film that's four hours long, with no action, no love story, no women at all, very little dialog, and no stars in the lead roles, and you want to go to one of the most remote places in the world to film it.  What would you say?\\"<br />Fortunately, it was made, and stands to this day as the greatest epic ever filmed.  The dialog is indeed sparse, but memorable.  There's not a wasted word in this movie.  There is action, but it's not the focus of the film, this isn't an \\"action\\" movie.  O'Toole and Sharif were relative unknowns at the time, but this film made them international stars.  There is indeed no love story.  Lawrence is believed to have been homosexual, and that aspect of his character is hinted at in the film, but not really addressed (this was 1962, after all).  They did in fact film it in the vast, remote Jordanian desert, and that desert is as much a character in the film as any of the actors.  If there was ever a more beautifully filmed movie, I haven't seen it.  To say the cinematography is breathtaking is to fail to do it justice.  The DVD looks spectacular, you have to remind yourself constantly that you're looking at a movie filmed over 40 years ago.  The sound has also been remastered, and Maurice Jarre's score sounds glorious.  Don't listen to those who say Lawrence of Arabia is overrated.  It's impossible to overrate this movie.
B000002U8G|5.0|I used to say that \\"Wish You Were Here\\" was the best Pink Floyd album.. but then I get \\"Meddle.\\"<BR><BR>Meddle is definitely the best pre-Dark Side Floyd album, and it might even be their best album ever. It's so hypnotic, and beautiful, and the music they were hinting at with their previous efforts (Saucerful, Atom Heart Mother, etc) all came together perfectly on Meddle. <BR><BR>One of These Days is an excellent opener, and a very exciting one to boot. If Pink Floyd knew how to do something, it was to open an album. Nick Mason's growling, with Waters' menacing bass go together perfectly. and of course there's David Gilmour, who I absolutely idolize.<BR><BR>A Pillow of Winds is a truly beautiful song. made me weep the first time I heard it.<BR><BR>Fearless is a pretty damn good rocker! It's where songs like \\"Money,\\" and \\"Have A Cigar\\" came from.<BR><BR>San Tropez is the only song on the album Roger Waters, sang on, which is a good thing. It shows that Floyd was once a democracy before Waters became a creative dictator around the time of \\"Animals,\\" and \\"The Wall,\\" the latter being one of the most overrated albums of all time. It's very jazz influenced, like lounge jazz meets Sun Ra.<BR><BR>Seamus is HILARIOUS!!! It's a 12-bar blues riff about someone's dog, and even has Seamus The Dog howling in the background!! Filler to some, but it's good to actually laugh at a Pink Floyd song. The band did have a sense of humour!<BR><BR>Then there's the 23:32 minute closer... \\"ECHOES.\\" And it actually keeps you interested the whole way through. Something most of the 2 or 3 minute songs off the Wall could not do. It's very weird and trippy, but very reminiscent of an emotional nightmare. What a way to end an album off, let me tell you!  <BR><BR>If you're a fan of Pink Floyd, you MUST get this. Cough up a few bucks, and get yourself to a CD store, or buy it off of Amazon.com =). You will not regret it.
B00003W8NM|4.0|I came to this movie wondering if it was going to be as good as all the overheated media hype and fluff had made it out to be. It was touted as representing the anger and consciousness of the X generation, and maybe it does. But this story about an alienated loser who creates a violent cult of similarly inclined young men who weekly beat each other up and then plot to destroy society's institutions, although perhaps not great, is still pretty good. It's also reminiscent of the movie, Crash, based on the J.G. Ballard novel, in its theme of a repressed and narcissistic culture of violence that lies just beneath the surface of our otherwise highly polished, technologically advanced society, an interesting idea. There are some good scenes in the movie, but some of them didn't quite hit the mark. But Ed Norton is a fine actor, and he turns in an excellent performance here, and he is certainly one of our best up-and-coming young stars. All in all, a pretty good flick with some interesting ideas, some fine acting by Norton, and a dramatic ending, and I'd actually give it 3.5 stars if I could.
B000002IOY|5.0|Though the level of 'The Years Of Decay' was recently overruled by OverKill's latest studio release 'Bloodletting'. 'The Years Of Decay' was, in my opinion, the best Thrash album released in the eighties.<BR>Fast ... kicking Thrash with a punky attitude, that's what OverKill brings in timeless anthems like 'Elimination', 'I Hate' and closer 'E.vil N.ever D.ies'. But there's more, my personal favorite OverKill-song, the heavy, Sabbath-like 'Skullkrusher' is on the album and even a ballad; the title track.<BR>'The Years Of Decay' is simply an album any serious Thrash Metal fan should own!
B00003BDXG|3.0|I realize that this movie isn't all about violence, and in fact, is more of a parody of our culture's obsession with it. But by trying to be a profound movie about violence it goes over the heads of most viewers, who of course simply see it as another movie glorifying violence just like all the other violent movies out there. So in fact the movie fails in its chief goal, although the movie as just a movie isn't that bad, and might even be pretty good.<br />That having been said, I will give a nod to Woody Harrelson for his fine performance. There was speculation that Harrelson, being pretty much exclusively a TV actor up to this point, wouldn't have the kind of on-screen presence a big-screen movie requires. I'm not sure I even know what the pundits were referring to here, but I would say their concerns turned out to be unfounded, as I thought Harrelson actually did a very fine job in his part. And as for Lewis, well, she's easy to look at, and she gets a couple of terrific straight lefts to that guy's face which were pretty entertaining, when she was beating up the dude in the diner, but overall, I wouldn't put her in Harrelson's class as an actress.<br />All in all, not a bad movie, but I still have a problem with the message about violence, and which unfortunately turned out to be a non-message because of what people are really going to think. As I said, it's not a bad film, and as \\"just another movie\\" it might be pretty good, but I'm told by my movie pundit acquaintances that one is supposed to expect more from film genius Oliver Stone. I will defer to their superior erudition in that case and so only give it 3 or 3.5 stars.
B000002IV8|4.0|This album was about 5 bucks when I bought it, so I thought I couldn't leave the store without getting it.<BR>'I Hear Black' was often criticized for being too &quot;grungy&quot; or not Thrash enough. Though I understand people saying that, I wouldn't say that it's a bad thing. The desperate Heavy Metal of 'World Of Hurt' and the ultra heavy blues of 'Spiritual Void' still are on the OverKill-set today, but the album has other great songs, take 'Dreaming In Columbian' or the sensitive 'Shades Of Grey' for instance.<BR>For the Thrash fans there still are songs like 'Weight Of The World', 'Just Like You' or the Sabbath-like 'Ignorance And Innocence' (which are all at the end of the album).<BR>'I Hear Black' is maybe not what many fans expected from it, but it's the most varied album they released.
B0000029DD|5.0|I must start by saying that it is with much sorrow that I have to rate this album knowing that there will be no more brilliance created by the wonder of a man who we know and love-The amazing Jeff Buckley(Rip).<BR>This album is so beautiful it is almost painful.  Jeff creates moods that are so subtle and so effective, carrying the listener to places that music seldom does nowadays. I think that this is what music should be. A transcendence into a deep emotional passage through aural stimulation. <br />I can not go on without the mentioning of his voice. Not only did he have an incredible range, he had a voice that is so expressive it speaks for everyone.  He could go from a choir-boy falsetto to a heart-wrenching howl in an instant.  Jeff sang not only with emotion, but with attitude as well. His lyrics are so genuine and full of passion.  Such a tragedy for the young artist to have gone so soon.  This album can not be compared to anything else. It stands alone, and holds its head high.  The diversity in the song styles is amazing, and the instrumentals are astounding.  Every track is unique.  His (life-altering) rendition of Leonard Cohen's &quot;Hallelujah&quot; is reason enough to buy the cd-everyone is blown away by it-regardless of their musical taste. Do yourself a favor and buy GRACE.  It will change much in you.  You will delve into a world of despair, joy, romance and enlightenment. Even now, 8 years later, it is one of the best albums in its genre.
B000003T9B|3.0|'Feel The Fire' was a good first step voor OverKill. It sounds very raw and still very &quot;Maiden-ish&quot;. The album slightly bores me after a while, but songs like 'Rotten To The Core' and 'Overkill' itself are great classics. My personal favorite is still the closing Dead Boys-cover 'Sonic Reducer'.<BR>Like I said a good first step, but I myself would rather buy 'The Years Of Decay'.
B00005JKLZ|2.0|How could they have [messed] this up? They had the book to follow. What's worse is that it was received so poorly that we'll have wait another forty-two years, at least, before someone else attempts a remake. Yes, it is a movie about a guy who builds a time machine and travels into the future from the late 19th century, there are creatures called Morlocks and the time machine was made out of brass parts, beyond that, this film bears about as much semblance to the original as a tea leaf does to the entire East India Company, (Thank you, Douglas Adams).<br /> If there were no book entitled `The Time Machine' by H.G. Wells, I might have given it three stars, but because it plays so fast and loose with its logic and pacing that another rewrite or three might have been in order. Plus for a guy capable of building a device that can move through time with 19th century technology, he has about as much of a grasp of temporal causality as a concussed bee, (Again, thank you Mr. Adams). This fine English...er, American gentleman Alexander (Guy Pierce), an associate professor at Columbia university does all of this because his lady love Emma is meant to die. First she gets shot by a mugger, so he goes back in time to move her away from that event to a New York street corner away from the park. Where she promptly gets run over by a runaway horse and carriage. If that doesn't convince one that something is not meant to be, then nothing will. Bright boy then decides that since going back in time doesn't seem to solve anything, going into the future might.<br /> Right.<br /> The only problem is, that's already one-third of the movie. He travels ahead to 2032 where mankind has moved into space and are building vacation spots on the moon. Unfortunately, mankind is as capable of excavating land on the moon as our hero is at understand temporal causality. Mankind blows up the moon- cracks it right in half and gravity being what it is sends a lot of it crashing into the planet. Does ourhero Alexander go back in time to try and prevent this? No. Why? Probably because he's realized that he can't, so after a bump on a noggin that renders him insensate...more so, he's slung 802,701 years into the future. Yes, the special effects of the passage of time are nothing short of brilliant and the epochal time lapse is stunning, too bad it's in this dung heap of a film.<br /> He awakens under the care of an Eloi woman, Mara (Samantha Mumba) who is of course exotic and beautiful, which also means that she's doomed. As another reviewer correctly pointed out, for some reason they speak English 800,000 years from now. No reason for this, they do it to remember the past times. Just why they do it is never explained. The cliff dwelling Eloi are nothing but prey animals for the Morlocks, who we learn cannot stand daylight. We learn this only after we see them hunting by day. Next we meet big bad brain boy king daddy Morlock, played by Jeremy Irons, who is of course a telepathic/telekinetic god and has nefarious plans for our sumptuous Eloi lady. He has also learned where the time machine is, had it brought to his underground estate, and plans to use it. Of course if he was as smart as he appeared to be, he would know that going into the past is pointless and he could only effectively carry forward into the future.<br /> As much of a cinematic stinkburger as this film is, it does have its good points, few that they are. The Vox (Orlando Jones), the holographic computer that Alexander meets in 2037 at the New York Public Library is wonderful, especially when met 800,000 years in the future. He is sad, almost insane, contrasting the Eloi who have no knowledge of the past and no ambition of the future. The Vox remembers everything. The imagery is quite stunning, especially the beautiful cliff-side dwellings of the Eloi and have a wonderful organic look to them. Guy Pierce as Alexander is also quite likeable- he is heroic, compassionate and decent. Plus the Fellowship ofthe Rings Orc-like underground lair of the Morlocks is fantastic, as are the Morlocks themselves, despite the rather illogical premise of their existence, that of not being able to tolerate the light, yet hunting by day.<br /> So ten out of ten for purely visual quality, but the story is so lacking that it all but wrecks the rest of the film. The pacing is all wrong- the end meeting with the villain takes place in a single chamber within the Morlock lair- no drawn out conflict between the Eloi. Heck, I would have even approved of Alexander had organized the Eloi to fight back against them, but his meeting with the Uber-Morlock was just too short. Even in its current form, if they had explained things a little better, making it a half hour longer or just outright removed Alexander's reason for going into the future anyway- Emma's death and did it `just because' without the cathartic transformation would have been just fine.
B00006AW2L|2.0|Despite my two-star review, it is my firm belief that Aftermath is one of the best Stones albums. The thing is, this isn't that album.<br />Like the Beatles, the Stones were cursed with a bit of record-company duality; that is, their UK albums were often reconfigured drastically for the US. Aftermath, their first album of all-original songs, was hit harder than most, and this (its US configuration) is almost as disappointing as the US version of Revolver. It loses &quot;What To Do,&quot; &quot;Take It or Leave It&quot; and &quot;Mother's Little Helper,&quot; and one song (Out Of Time) is edited from its original 5 minute-plus length. Sure, &quot;Paint It Black&quot; is tacked on, but said song is availible on countless other discs. The track order is also changed heavily; what was once one of the longest and most logical of the Stones albums was irrevocably damaged.<br />For reasons known only to ABKCO, this bastardized American version was the only domestic US CD version availible for several years. With their 2002 remastering campaign, though, while the US version stays in print, the far-superior UK version has also been introduced. As both are priced identically, the correct choice should be obvious: the UK album presents what the Stones intended, has the unedited Out Of Time, and has several tracks not on the US version. <br />Verdict: Great album, but pass on this disc for the far-superior UK version (with the purple cover).

B00006AW2F|3.0|It's amazing what history can do to certain albums. Released by Allen Klein's ABKCO in the mid-seventies, Metamorphosis was savaged by...well, just about everyone at the time. Bill Wyman had apparently approached Klein with his own concept of a Stones out-takes collection (caled \\"The Black Box\\"), Klein turned him down, and Metamorphosis was the result; indeed, the album is somewhat infamous for its status as THE cut-out bin record. With its ugly cover and its bizarre focus on Mick and Keith's demos for outside artists, Metamorphosis was discarded almost as soon as it was purchased.<br />Something strange happened, though, which I suppose was inevitable. When ABKCO and London Records issued the Stones discs on CD in the late eighties, Metamorphosis--ABKCO's baby!--was pointedly not amoung them. Its unavailibility on CD suddenly lent it a near-mythical status, with the reams of \\"critical evalutations\\" that tend to follow something suddenly becoming unavailible (never mind that vinyl copies have always been easy to find!).<br />Now we find ourselves in 2002, with ABKCO finally releasing the long-out-of-print compilation on CD, putting an end to the era of endless CD pirates and variations. Is this the final word? Is this indeed a lost classic?<br />Heavens no. Hopefully, this recent re-release will finally allow people to take a rational look at the album, without the endless \\"what it could've been\\" sentiments AND the \\"but-it-isn't-availible\\" protestations. Metamorphosis is what it always has been; a decent collection of outtakes and demos, but not the best of what could have been put-out.<br />For one thing, many of the tracks are \\"The Rolling Stones\\" in name only. Mick and Keith wanted to play the Lennon/McCartney game of farming out some of their \\"less-Stones-like\\" songs to outside groups, so Andrew Oldham assembled a crack-team of musicians to record the songs, with Mick and Keith often being the only Stones present. The results aren't BAD, but it doesn't take a Stones historian to see why songs like \\"Some Things Just Stick in Your Mind\\" and \\"I'd Rather Be with the Boys\\" didn't show up on proper Stones discs.<br />The non-demo stuff is tasty indeed, though. \\"Family\\" (it of endless bootleg variations), \\"I Don't Know Why\\" and \\"Jiving Sister Fanny\\" are absolutely great. Even Bill Wyman--Mr. Stifled-by-Mick-and-Keith himself--gets a song entry, the curious ly-entitled \\"Downtown Suzie\\" (I'd love for someone to explain that particular title to me someday), and it's great fun.<br />A few criticisms. Firstly, it goes without saying that some of this (ESPECIALLY the demo material) isn't the kind of thing people return to after the novelty value has worn off; there IS better stuff in the vaults that could've been used. Also, while ABKCO sensibly reissued the longer, 16-track UK version of the album, it sounds like they just used the old 70s album master; there's some tremendously odd stereo processing going on in some of the songs, and bootlegs of this material often use cleaner (and wider!) sources.<br />Verdict: Finally availible on CD, wonderful. But if you never liked it, you probably still won't. Heck, it might repeat history, and be the first ever SACD hybrid cut-out!
B00005JKQX|3.0|I recently watched A Beautiful Mind with my boyfriend this last week. I watched it for a psychology class that I am taking. I was amazed by the acting in this movie. I was also astonished by this being a true story. In our society today, someone like John Nash would be crucified. His extreme knowledge would be dismissed. I believe that Ron Howard did an excellent job directing this film.
6305165912|5.0|Excellent performances by all. Comedy + Suspense + A big of Naughty This 'n That and you've got The Big Lebowski. A terrific treat for open minded fun-loving care-free individuals everywhere. For everyone else, much needed therepy. The first couple of reviewers hit the nail on the head and I couldn't agree more.
B0000048CP|5.0|The first thing that you hear coming through your speakers is the distant rumble of a thousand charging horses as the legions of Odin ride the skies over the frozen windswept Nordland. Kettle drums and a choir subtly enhance the experience before a cold, melodic acoustic guitar delicately initiates you into the journey you're about to embark upon. Quorthon gently croons a description of the night sky as the twinsun slowly fades and the many moons circle...<br />And then...AAAUUURRRGGGHHH!!! The drums kick in, the guitars rip into your skull like some huge chainsaw on steroids, and the riff begins it's epic march into \\"A Fine Day To Die\\", one of black metal's all-time best songs and arguably Bathory's finest moment.<br />However revered Bathory's first three albums are to my ears, nothing...I repeat, NOTHING...could have possibly prepared me for the epic sonic pummelling I would endure in this impossibly classy precursor to the Scandinavian black metal scene which would follow years later. 'Blood Fire Death' is, to my perception, the first truly modern black metal album, far exceeding the limited confines of the genre's previous efforts (only Celtic Frost's \\"Morbid Tales\\" and \\"To Mega Therion\\" came close, but this album, I think, much more captures the aesthetic of today's acts). <br />While admittedly much of the album is still comprised of ultra high-speed blitzcore (no blastbeat stuff, however...Napalm Death would invent it shortly after this), it's done with a sense of authority and style that makes it genuinely seem to BELONG there. Both \\"The Golden Walls of Heaven\\" and \\"Dies Irae\\" rocket along at a million miles an hour, but inject a large dose of thoughtfulness into the playing (the lead break in the latter is absolutely Yngwie-esque)...not to mention Quorthon's new lyrical maturity. The red-skinned dude with the pitchfork that he praised so heavily in earlier works is here referred to only in subtle innuendos (\\"The one with a number, not a name\\" or \\"the one with horns on head\\") and yet it's much more convincing. But it's the epic Viking stuff here that really steals the show, bookending the seven tracks featured here in a most epic manner. The album closes much the same way it opens, with the thundering title track telling the tale of going to war against all that's holy and pious in the world...choose your weapons and fall in a line, dudes!...and introduces elements that were way ahead of their time: melodic keyboards, choir vocals, warm acoustic passages, etc.<br />About the only track that falls short here is \\"Pace 'Til Death\\", due mainly to it's STOOOOpid lyrics (\\"Mirror, mirror, on the wall/I'm the fastest of 'em all\\"...PFFFTTTTT!!!! HAHAHAHA!!!! Gimme a break!) and it's dumb inclusion of a Venom send-up riff (\\"Teacher's Pet\\") that's completely out-of-step with the rest of the album's majestic, if somewhat pompous, epic vision.<br />'Blood Fire Death''s influence is immense, as Ihsahn of Emperor has stated in interviews (the fact that Emperor's cover of \\"A Fine Day to Die\\" is an almost note-for-note carbon copy shows that even the masters of modern day black metal can't improve upon some things), and deserves to be heard at least once by anyone who considers themselves a metal fan. Still to this day one of my all-time favorite albums, and one that I want placed in my ship of oak when they wrap me in my cape and lay my sword down by my side (yeah, OK, I know that's the next album, but I'm trying to be as eloquent as I can here!)...<br />(A tip for metal collectors: try to find the original vinyl LP version of this album, which is packaged in a beautiful gatefold sleeve that highlights Peter Nicolai Arbo's 1872 painting, \\"Asganrdsteien (aka The Wild Hunt)\\" and is gloriously worthy of the music contained within.)
B00005JKG7|2.0|I remember when this movie was released. People had high expectations because it was Carpenter's next film after his tremendously popular \\"Halloween\\", and it had the same writing team and some of the same actors (Curtis, Loomis, Cyphers) as that movie. Carpenter even did the score himself, as he did for Halloween. How could it miss? But it did. The reactions and reviews were mostly awful. I saw it in the theater and was really disappointed too. It wasn't terrible, but after \\"Halloween\\" we all expected something good from Carpenter and \\"The Fog\\" wasn't it.<br />Basically, (while visiting Stonehenge with producer/co-writer Debra Hill), he had an idea to make a movie about 'something scary coming out of the fog', but he found that constructing a whole movie out of this concept was a more difficult task. The film is very boring, and what little excitement there is is filled with horror movie clichés from the late 70's/early 80's: bodies falling from closets, obvious red herrings and setups, Jamie Lee Curtis screaming, and plenty of other passé ideas you've seen too many times before. The great actor Hal Holbrook must have needed money that year - he plays a priest, taken directly from \\"The Omen\\", complete with the constant dire warnings and foreboding looks toward the sky. Another irritating thing was the 'annoying little kid who can't act' casting syndrome - also found in \\"The Omen\\" as well as \\"The Shining\\" and countless other films. On the positive side though, the overall atmosphere and scenery are well done. Carpenter picked a sleepy little seaside town to shoot in, and it works well. Reminded me of \\"The Birds\\", a LOT. The music was ho-hum, not as special as the \\"Halloween\\" theme but not distracting either.<br />Carpenter seems to know this film was a failure, based on his DVD liner notes and commentary. He timidly writes \\"I did the best I could\\" and \\"enjoy it for what it is - a little exploitation horror movie\\". In his commentary, he sometimes points out his ownclichés, in a disappointed manner. I guess he doesn't want us to take it too seriously (apparently he doesn't), but even as an exploitation horror film, it fails. Still, as poor as this movie is, it looks like a masterpiece compared to the abominable straight-to-video duds Carpenter would make in the years after that. <br />Well, I already knew it wasn't a great movie before I bought the DVD; I got it mainly for the extras. I paid the money, and I got to see about 7 minutes worth of outtakes (actors flubbing lines); a couple interesting documentaries; some worthless storyboards, stills, etc, and the audio commentary by Carpenter and Hill, which was more interesting than the film. I guess it was worth it - the DVD is priced reasonably, the print and 5.1 sound are excellent, and there's enough extras to make a night out of it. Too bad the movie itself is a snoozer.
B00004XQP4|5.0|cool! i think greenday arnt maturer like every1 else sez but they sure r hott &amp; nice.  minrity is my fav warning song. i sing it wheneva im sad that my rents wont give me $ to shop at hot topic in the mall.<br />cheers!
B00005QDW1|5.0|What was i thinking?  I hated this album when i first heard it, but after a hearing it a couple of times, i think that it is a work of art.  Way to go No Doubt, you are one of a kind when it comes to your musical talents.  No one can touch you...Rock on..
B00005JKQZ|5.0|The best movie of the year and the best performance by Crowe, Harris and Connelly.  Crowe was robbed by a payback award to Washington who deserve it for &quot;Hurricane&quot; but not for&quot;Training Day&quot;<br />Well done DVD
B00000099Y|1.0|Finally I'm seeing some intelligent one-star reviews here. Not that there are any intelligent five-star reviews, but it's nice to see the other smart people who realize how horrible this monstrosity is. <BR>Well, that's knd of a bit much. It's not that bad, but it sure doesn't have any positive qualities. What poepl see in this scrap heap I cannot understand. I've followed some poeple's directions and listened several times; I've read the words; I went and saw the band live. None of it helped. The album got less entertaining; the words were nothing special, even subpar; and when they played &quot;Third Eye&quot; at the concert it was (if possible) even more irritating. The rest of the concert was good, though I could have lived without it. Basically, I see no difference between this band and Bush. Except that Bush can write a decent bubble gum pop song, and Tool cannot.<BR>Instantly forgettable. What you get when you apply an enema (See! They even had to make the wretched title more pretentious.) to a Yes/Black Sabbath cover band.
B00005OCMR|5.0|The word &quot;classic&quot; suffices beautifully.  But, entertaining and fun would perhaps be more descriptive.  There are very few experiences, if any, that are as exciting the second time (and subsequent times) as the first time.  Seeing this movie again was, indeed, just as exciting as seeing it for the first time.  I wish I still had the toys...
0553573403|5.0|Not many books make me anxiously await a sequel any more. This one did.
B000002J1H|5.0|I wholeheartedly agree with the other opinions<BR>about Awaken.Close to the edge is a mere warm<BR>up for this magnificant,uplifting work of art.<br />If GFTT was five times the price and only contained<BR>this track,I would still buy two copies.
0784011176|5.0|I saw this movie back when it was in theaters and recently bought the dvd.  This is a great story, centering around Ada, a woman that is mute and her daughter played by the talented Anna Paquin (now an X Men heroine).  Holly Hunter and Anna Paquin won Oscars for their roles and Harvey Keitel gives a performance that is Oscar worthy as well.  The music, the scenery and the acting all blend together perfectly making a movie that is appealing to all your senses. A very good film and well worth adding to your collection.
B000000993|5.0|To move from the E.P 'Opiate' to the album 'Undertow', released only a year later, is to move from a successful yet experimental foray into the previously uncharted musical waters which tool sail, to far more rounded, inclusive vision fully realised- a sound and style which would be expanded and built upon in tool's later releases.<br />The sound lacks some of the rabid intensity of 'Aenima' or the utter complexity of 'Lateralus', yet this remains probably Tool most accessible release. The bass sounds fantastic, guitars screech menacingly, and Tools cathartic, emotionally compelling anger driven sound is inaugurated.<br />Undertow constitutes a fantastically diverse collection of songs, from the biting 'Intolerance', which manically berates another soul, to the gentle '4degrees' which concerns opening without reservation. The slightly more commercially recognisable (and viable) 'Prison sex' and 'Sober', are two of the albums best cuts, as is the cataclysmic finale 'Disgustipated', which in a truly bizzare world attains the dubious honour of remaining a particularly bizzare 'song'.<br />Under the surface of the entire album a subtle 'water' theme runs, which was prefigured in part by 'Sweat' back on 'Opiate' ('Sinking deeper, its almost like I'm swimming'). This theme shoots directly to prominence on two tracks specifically-  which is fairly obvious when you consider their titles: 'Flood' and the title track, 'Undertow' itself. This underlying theme is intriguing and adds a cogent quality to the albums sprawling whole.<br />Maynard uses emotional imnsecurity and societys faults as powerful subject matter for extremely insightful lyrics and immpressive vocals, and hence the album is very intellectually stimulating material.<br />Well played, written and recorded, a joy to listen to, highly recommended.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I've seen a good deal about Norah Jones in the past few months but I've been lazy about buying her cd. The other night I saw the cd for a good price and decided to pick it up. I was very pleased with it. The whole cd is very mellow and low keyed, a wonderful cd to slow dance the night away with the special person in your life. The first track (also the first single released off the album) is my favorite but there are lots of goodies here. The more I listen to this cd, the more I enjoy it. I look forward to hearing more good stuff from her in the future. I highly recommend this cd.
B00005B36H|5.0|Since early morning on the day of its release, Lateralus has perplexed, delighted, compelled, excited and inspired me. It was obvious from my very first listen that Tool had delivered the goods in spectacular fashion. The sound may be slightly less heavy than Aenima, although Maynard has lost none of his spite, as the bile infused lyrics still remain.<br />The music is as complex, intertwined and dense as ever, with the 11 minute 'Reflection' showcasing a more mellow, progressive side to the jaw dropping songwriting and playing we have come to expect from this band.<br />Maynard is as vocal as ever, and the lyrics are as intellectually stimulating and challenging as ever.<br />'The Grudge' uses Saturns orbital cycle to suggest a likely time for self-evalution, while 'Schism' concerns much what it suggests, reminding us that 'Cold silence atrophies any sense of compassion' and urges us to speak and throw aside our differences.<br />Humanity and our nature are tackled with 'Parabola' and 'Lateralus', with the constraints of our bodies and the Fibonacci series being interwoven into each masterwork.<br />Elsewhere, 'Reflection' takes an almost Cabalistic point of view, as Maynard self-effacingly muses upon the fact that he should 'crucify his ego' before we 'pine away'.<br />The failings of others, a favourite Tool theme makes an appearence in 'Ticks and Leeches' as Maynard compares a person, or the record industry, or the music press, or obsessive fans to a blood sucking parasite. The deep meaning despite the ambiguity in the lyrics is one of the albums greatest strengths.<br />The instrumental 'Triad' closes the album proper on a thunderous note.<br />The playing is incredible, the themes intelligent, the production unsurpassed. This is the best album of last year, and another stunning addition to the Tool catalogue.<br />Highly reccomended.

B00005QG9J|5.0|I became an Incubus fan with their previous album and now own all three of them.  I don't even want to compare any of them with each other because they are all unique works of art.  This album is like a breath of fresh air.  At first I was a little upset about the lighter music, but the more I've listened to it, the more I've grown to absolutely love it.  Each song is wonderfully composed, which is something that can't be said about most rock.  The vocals have gotten better with each album.  I think if they had tried this album at the start it might have failed because of the vocals.  I saw them when they came to Portland with Hoobastank, and I was awestruck.  I've seen Pearl Jam, Metallica, Live, Bush and others, and Incubus was topped only by Metallica (who is the best live band I have ever seen).  What I realized is that Brandon Boyd is the best singer of any of them.  He has the ability to do whatever style fits the message, which gives Incubus great flexibility with their music.<BR>There isn't a single song on this CD that I don't like.  I'd give it a ten if I could!  Buy it!
B000063USY|1.0|bad movie. i dont care if my review was helpful or not, but this movie was one of the lamest excuses for a movie ever! if you want to see a good action type movie, see rollerball!
B0000639FE|4.0|The first time I saw this movie was just a couple months ago, and the reason was I didn't think it would be worth the effort to sit and watch. But...I started to take notice of Renee Zellweger, and the various roles she played. Even this movie which made her an instant sensation overnight. Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is the most miserable excuse of a human being who has the job of a sports agent, and he gets canned from his job real soon. But as he gets ready to leave, Dorthy Boyd(lovely Renee) finds the courage to wanna leave with him. Jerry's only hope in wanting to stay on top of the game is to stick with his one client Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr. who really steals this movie). Ultimately, it is a movie about finding not just a love and respect from other people, but with the person inside you. And in the end, Jerry truly does find it with Dorthy who completes him very much. Not the greatist movie of all, but yes it's very appealing.
0061092037|5.0|To those who have read Kane &amp; Abel, The Fourth Estate is a bit of deja vu. The plot is essentially the same. Two men - one a refugee from a war, the other an Ivy League-educated millionaire get pitted against each other and will not cease until the other man is driven out of business. The action is rivetting and makes the book a compelling page-turner.<br /> The book is actually based on real-life characters, and a few real incidents too. Readers will find it tough not to see the similarity between Keith Townsend and Rupert Murdoch.<br /> The way the story is woven is also reminiscent of Kane &amp; Abel, however the book does not sag one wee bit in action. I assign five stars to this book because that's the maximum!
B00003CXS4|5.0|Theres not really much to this movie except violence, snappy one-liners, and an incredibly humorous plot. Oh wait that would make it a good movie.
0451167716|5.0|The Godfather is, in many ways, not just a novel - it is an experience, after which your life will never be the same again. I have not the least of doubts in calling it 'the best, most influential and deep-cutting that I have ever read.' In its sheer departure from being just a general, run-of-the-mill tale about idolizing a particular individual, the novel presents to us with a ringside view of the workings of the Mafia, and more importantly, the lives of the people who are involved in it, directly or indirectly.<br />The novel starts off with a quote from Balzac - \\"Behind every great fortune, there is a crime.\\" That, in effect, sets the tone for the entire novel. Mario Puzo, the author, ruthlessly captures the travails of a New York Don, Vito Corleone, who is, to quote the words of his son, \\"not a crazy gunning mobster\\", and his family.<br />Puzo presents to us an entire array of different characters - be it the short-tempered Sonny, or the dreary undertaker Bonasera, or the ever-faithful Luca, the cool-headed Tom, the 'Turk' Sollozzo, or the pleasant outsider Kay Adams, each character enters our world, refusing to leave. We are impressed by most of these essentially evil people because the story is told in an entirely closed world (of crime) and so we tend to love characters whom we would, in the normal course, detest.<br />The novel is, basically, about just two persons, Don Vito Corleone and his son, Michael, who after refusing to accept his father's ways, finally comes to terms with the reality and takes up the 'family business'.<br />Puzo shows us why he is the great author he really is! The character of the Don pervades our thoughts more than most (or almost all) other fictional characters do. Though the nature of his business is violent, the Don is portrayed as a genial, kind and reasonable man. To say the least, the Don is someone whom `every son will look for in his father, every woman will look for in her husband, and any mortal will look for in an inspirational leader.' In fact, the Godfather is what every man aspires to be - a strong, powerful and wise yet cunning genius and family man.<br />I have not read a better novel - chances are, you won't either! Do not miss the Godfather movies too.

B00005JKCF|4.0|Spider-Man is the most exiting movie of the summer. It has action,passion,love,friendship and evil.Tobey Maguire puts on a roller coaster of a perfomance. It all starts when Peter Parker is bitten By a radioactive spider and before he notices it he is web swinging, jumping across buildings and saving damsils in destress but all this leads up to the final battle above the city with the Green Goblin. If you Had to pick Spidey's your man
B000002MP2|5.0|After hearing &quot;Welcome to Paradise&quot; in language arts one day (imagine a class you could hear awesome punk rock in), I bought this CD. I was anything but disappointed. This was in 1994, I think, and it rocks. Every song is so enjoyable, even the slow ones. It starts off strong, with &quot;Burnout,&quot; and ends strong with the bonus track at the end of &quot;F.O.D.&quot; And all the songs in between are awesome as well. Now I haven't heard all of Green Day's CDs, but I can guarantee this is one of the best. How can I do that? Because this is SO good. Promise.
B0000542D2|5.0|Just wanted to comment on Robert W. Moore's review. He mentions in his first paragraph that, <br />\\"Fist, before going on with my review of the film, let me point out, before someone complains about the DVD not being widescreen, that the film was shot in 35mm, which means that the DVD of necessity is fullscreen. Widescreen is appropriate only to films shot in 70mm. HELP! was also filmed in 35mm. So, please, no One-star reviews because the DVD isn't widescreen.\\"<br />Well not sure if he knows what he is talking about, widescreen versus fullscreen is not dictated by film size, rather by the type of lense used when the film was originally shot. Further this film is presented in the Widescreen anamorphic - 1.66:1 ratio. So I am really not to sure what he is talking about?<br />As far as the movie goes, well it is the best Rock movie ever.<BR>Think that says it all.
B00005QG9J|5.0|This is definately my favorite cd ever!

B00000AFWW|5.0|I'm not going to go into great detail about each song, but just say that almost every song on this album is at least solid, and some of them are all-time classics. This is definitely an album I can listen to all the way through without skipping tracks and I haven't (yet) gotten sick of it...it's got that great replayability factor going for it.<br />My favorite songs are &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot;, &quot;Malibu&quot;, &quot;Reasons to be Beautiful&quot;, &quot;Playing Your Song&quot;, and &quot;Petals&quot;. As others have said, the Corgan influence is very strong here, but that's all for the good as far as I'm concerned because the Pumpkins outrock just about anyone. If you had Billy sing instead of Courtney on &quot;Northern Star&quot; or &quot;Petals&quot;, you could drop them right into Mellon Collie &amp; The Infinite Sadness and no one would be the wiser. The only song I really don't much like is the 2nd track &quot;Awful&quot;. I almost like it, but its overly-poppy blandness annoys me. This must be one of those polarizing songs because a lot of people hate it and many say it's their favorite on the whole album...go figure. I usually don't pay much attention to lyrics, but on this album they do have meaning and resonance, and I actually found myself trying to figure out at various points what she was saying (the lyrics of &quot;Hit So Hard&quot; are interesting to try to interpret...it might not be as obvious as it looks at first).<br />Anyway, I don't give 5 stars lightly like many people do when they just &quot;don't hate&quot; something. This is a great, great album that should be in your collection. It's totally addicting. The production values are very good here, much better than the somewhat muddier-sounding Live Through This (also an excellent though very different album).  It will be a shame if Hole never does another album. I expect it will be as different from this as this was from LTT. I'd like to see Courtney collaborate with Black Francis (Pixies) or Johnny Rzeznik (Goo Goo Dolls) or Ed Kowalczyk (Live)...could make for a powerful combination. Since with Courtney's earlier work we have to assume she was basically &quot;collaborating&quot; with Kurt Cobain, and she had the Pumpkins/Go-Gos influence on this album, I think she's at her best working with others. Too much emphasis is put on who takes credit for writing a song, or if the artist is selling out or &quot;staying true to their roots&quot;, but if it's good it's good, in my book. And this is very good.
B000001DTM|5.0|This is the only U2 CD I own so far, so I can't compare it to any of their others, but I absolutely love &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;. There's a great mixture of slow songs (i.e., the ever-popular &quot;One&quot; and, my favorite, &quot;Love Is Blindness&quot;. By the time I've listened to this CD from beginning to end, I just hit the repeat button on this last song.), as well as fast songs (my favorites: &quot;Zoo Station&quot;, &quot;The Fly&quot;, and &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot;--all with distinctive beginning guitar riffs). Bono's voice, as well as his simple, yet effective song writing, are probably the most distinguishing qualities of the band, not to mention The Edge's terrific guitar playing.<br />On to the the booklet: besides lyrics (which is always a plus, since some CDs don't contain them), there are some great photos of the band, especially of the group dressed up in drag. Very amusing.<br />&quot;Achtung Baby&quot; is one of my favorite pop/alternative CDs from the 90s. Definitely worth a listen if you're a U2 fan, and even better to own.
B00000099Y|1.0|Thank you for writing that: I was in fact once hit in the face with a flying wrench! It broke my poor little nose. It hurt. But I'd still prefer that to listening to this horrid album. (Well, not really, but that sure sounds mean!) <BR>Tool is dark? How? They have no emotional output or specific point of view. They're lightweights. If Maynard kills himself I'll take him seriously. I take Kurt seriously.<BR>What's-his-name (Carey) is a decent drummer, I suppose, but he's nothing special. But what can you expect from someone who uded to play for joke bands like Green Jelly? Besides the fact that they move on to other joke bands?<BR>Maynard as a vocalist? He's not as bad as I've heard others say, but he makes no attempt to sing on Tool records, only on A Perfect Circle releases. I could name ten better contemporary rock singers (and songwriters) who are better right now. But I won't. I'm tired.
B0000560XI|5.0|This is a DVD-Audio title recorded at 96Khz with three groups of tracks: M-C, Stereo and what seems to be a DVD Movie of the making of the record itself. I have not watched the last one, and I only listened to the stereo track, but still it sound excellent.
078322804X|5.0|&quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; is one of the best 80's movies I have ever seen! John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd are awesome here! Belushi and Aykroyd star as Jake and Elwood Blues who want to raise the money by putting their band back together and staging a large gig. The DVD is great. The picture and sound quality are wonderful. The extras are superb including the documentary and the production photographs. If you own a DVD player, you must own &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;. I think you won't be disappointed.
B000002J1Y|5.0|This album is one of my favorite live albums of all time. I've been a YES fan only for couple of years and I've seen them live 3 times in 2000, 2001 and 2002 - but none of these shows could be compared with &quot;YESSONGS&quot;. I agree that sound quality and mastering are not perfect but I think this album has typical 70s' sound. All instrumnts sound so real and analog. I highly reccomend this album to all who dig good music. My favorites from the album are: &quot;Yours is no disgrace&quot;, &quot;Heart of the Sunrise&quot;, &quot;Mood for a day&quot; and &quot;Close to the Edge&quot;. Buy it - it's worth it.
B0000636UN|2.0|I've tried.  Lord knows I've tried.  But this cd just blows.  I can't decide if it's the music or the lyrics.  Or could it be both?  Sheryl usually rocks my world, but this time out she just fell flat.  Maybe turning 40 isn't all t hat cool afterall.
0345440900|3.0|Like many books you need to sort through this and take from it the ideas that appeal to you and discard the rest. There are some good tips in here, but there is also quite a bit of misinformation. I would recommend that you purchase other books on the topics you are interested in to find a balance. Some good ones are: The No-Cry Sleep Solution and The Happiest Baby on the Block.
B00005YXZH|5.0|From the opening percussion of &quot;I Am Trying To Break Your Heart&quot; to the final chords of &quot;Reservations&quot; this album grabs your attention and doesn't let go.  It's not background music.  It's not good in the car.  But if you sit down and listen, you won't be disappointed.
0783225970|5.0|This is one of the best mob movies ever.  I guess you can classify it as a mob movie because it deals alot with organized crime.  This movie tells the story of a Tony Montana a cubian refuguee thats wants a better life in america.  It talks about the ups and downs of his many accomplishments.  You can check out other good dvds on this website.  All of our dvds are wholesale and we sell to the public.

B00005YUNY|5.0|i was a little disapointed when yes said they were going to tour with a orchestra last summer , i thought ok just another yes tour without rick wakeman ,i dont want to go , well after i seen this dvd i,m the the one that made the mistake for not going , i picked up this dvd after a friend said you got to here them do the gates of delerium . what a show and sound -excellent !! the orchstra was a great addition to those masterful long arrangements yes had left way back in the 70s 5.1 surround even futhers the listening bliss in which you are transformed into right from the start with close to the edge!!! even the youthful female members of the orchestra are into it. a must for all true yes fans. ...
B00006F83Y|5.0|I loved the self titled debut, Rated R however did take me a while to get into and i still don't enjoy it as much as the first. The new album is almost a perfect mix between the two. Track 1 titled \\"millionaire\\" for short is a blistering metal juggernaut of a song that will leave you gasping, it's truly like nothing i've heard before. The rest of the album just gets better and better with exquisite melodies and guitar wizardry as it goes along. There is not one weak track on this album, the song writing has really improved. Much credit goes to Dave Grohl as the drumming is absolutely superb! It really adds that extra dimension that they were desperately missing on Rated R, where some of the tracks sounded very stagnant and incoherent. This is easily my favourite album so far of 2002.
B0000009RX|5.0|Hey, I am here to say this is one great album. If you are in anyway interested in getting into Zappa's music this is a good place to start. What can I say, pure genius. And I usually get mad when people say that about anyone, but its true here!<BR>  Ok one reason I want to do this review is to say to other Zappa fans if they like this they will really like a newer band called Ween, check out God Ween Satan or The Mollusk or anything by them. I'm 18 and I love Frank Zappa and I think Ween carry on where he left off, in the best way that they are completely original and equally strange. So buy this and check Ween out. Or just buy this!
1402511787|2.0|Reminds me of &quot;...a dark and stormy night&quot;. Enough said.
B000002U82|5.0|Being only 18, I must say that I am not a crazy hardcore fan.  Im a huge fan of Floyd but its not like I ever passed out or went insane at a &quot;Wall&quot; concert or anything, so yeah.<br />I bought &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; because of a friend of mine that reccomended it.  Being young, I have alwats listened to a lot bad music, punk and rap being two examples.<br />Whenever I hear good music, for some weird reason the music makes an instant memory for me and when I hear the same music again I am transported back to that memory or memories.<br />Dark Side of the Moon helps me to remember a part of my life that I can barely remember without hearing Dark Side of the Moon.  It was one of those times that you didnt want to end but it had to, and after the only thing that you had was memories.  This weird occurence though is true of all Floyd music with me, but we are talking about Dark Side here.<br />In a modern world of baggy pants and singles, its nice to just zone out with some Floyd without skipping tracks.  Listeing to a whole album without skipping any of the music, that is one of the things I love about Pink Floyd.<br />If you are young to &quot;Dark Side&quot; and especially if you are a new listener, then their are some things to consider.  One, you need to keep an open mind while listening.  Sorry, but their is going to be weird sounds and you wont find Britney Spears' voice on Dark Side of the Moon or on any Floyd music.  Two, try to notice that this album is almost THIRTY years old.  If you like it, then ask yourself how it compares to any other music released in 1973.  The answer is: it doesnt.  Third, you are either going to hate this record or it will become a part of your life.  Fourth, try and learn something about yourself when you are listening.  I guarantee that your girlfriend is going to hate it.  Well too bad!  You gotta take her to the mall every week so the least that she can do is listen to your favorite cd!  Plus, it is usually said that only &quot;smart&quot; people can actually appreciate Pink Floyd.  Smart AND patient people that is!<br />I have bought three different copies of Dark Side now because the first two have worn out.  Go out and buy your first, it wont be the last copy you buy.
B000002AH7|4.0|This disc combines classical and jazz elements. It's a good album, mellow, and enjoyable. It isn't the most accesible album to my ears, though the conventional wisdom says it was a little commercial.  I found this album is best listened to at a higher volume, because it's very dynamic, and the quieter sections are just as worthwhile as the louder.  I give it 4 instead of 5 because the same trumpet phrase shows up throughout to give it a \\"spanish flavor\\"... it gets to sound a little cliched.
B00006AW2M|4.0|There are some great songs (&quot;2000 Light Years from Home&quot;, &quot;In Another Land&quot;) among the psychedelic murk in the Stones' answer to the Beatles' &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. There are also a few, let's say, undistiguished numbers the Stones would probably just as soon forget. This new remastered edition delivers on the promise of spectacular sound, even with all the layers of spacey production, that makes this album an enjoyable listen even in its weaker moments.
B000002UWW|5.0|As a big RHCP fan, I had to have this disc if only to get \\"Show Me Your Soul\\", which is the best song in the RHCP ouevre.  I might quibble with the song selection, maybe add one here, take one out, but all in all this is a must-have, especially for those who don't feel like buying anything older than \\"Blood Sugar Sex Majik\\" .
B00003CX9E|5.0|It's truly difficult to come up with anything original to say about Citizen Kane, as it is one of the films that has been endlessly discussed, dissected, and reviewed over the years. To get to the point, though, there IS a reason for all this fuss. Admittedly, Citizen Kane may not be THE GREATEST FILM OF ALL TIME because that title really doesn't have any meaning - there are so many types of films that to compare them ALL in one category is ridiculous.<br />Nevertheless, as stated earlier, there is a reason why Citizen Kane has been ranked as it has. Although it is easy to dismiss Citizen Kane as no longer being as groundbreaking as it once was, this is a silly way to approach film. So what if it is no longer new technologically? Watched as objectively as possible, like any other film, Citizen Kane is very entertaining and has many obvious merits. For instance, the acting is top notch, as is the insightful, cynical script. Yes, the cinematography is good too.<br />Just in case there are people out there who aren't familiar with the plot of this film, it is a series of flashbacks on the life of Charles Foster Kane, a man who controlled numerous newspapers and a vast fortune. Many films dealing with tycoons have been made before and since Citizen Kane, but none have been able to deal with the topic as brilliantly as Orson Welles did in his remarkable debut.<br />Anyhow, it may be that Citizen Kane has aged some, and it is hard to identify ONE FILM as the greatest of all time. But after watching Citizen Kane with an open mind it becomes clear why people might rate it as such - from start to finish, this is a beautifully rendered, interesting, and amusing film. As far as unforgettable moments go, it's tough to beat ROSEBUD! So go see what the fuss is all about and enjoy two hours of classic entertainment!
B00005B36H|5.0|'Lateralus' is a GREAT album. My brother was so lucky to see them in concert. I'll take his word that I'll see them for myself in concert. The songs I highly recommend are 'Parabol', 'Parabola' (which are together in a GREAT music video), 'Schism', 'Lateralis' (which was edited to like four minutes on the radio, sadly), 'Ticks &amp; Leeches' (Which vaguely reminds me of The Deftones vocals), 'Eon Blue Epocalypse' (which would go great in a scene in one of my stories), 'The Grudge', and 'The Patient'. All of these are really great songs. My teacher and I sorely agree that Tool has evolutionized in music, making all of their albums very different, but all equally very good. So pick this one up. I highly recommend it.
B000053VAZ|5.0|Johnny Depp is a great actor, we all know that. This movie shows skills we don't get to see in his other films. He's even quirkier in this one than usual but that side of him is put to it's best use as the character Sam.<br />Mary Stuart Masterson does a good job playing a mentally imbalanced person and Adian Quinn is believable as the brother who 'needs her to be sick'.<br />I watched this movie the first time years ago with my older brother. The sweetness made him cry... and he was embarrassed but loved it anyway. I've watched countless times since.<br />It is the story of a mentally ill girl, Joon (Masterson), and her co-dependant older brother, Benny (Quinn), who losses a card game and has to take in the eccentric cousin of a friend. This is Sam (Depp). Sam and Joon enter into a relationship that threatens Bennie's control of Joon. It is more about the brother/sister relationship than Sam and Joon. It is complex if you pay close attention, but the comedy performance Depp gives makes it worth watching even if you don't.
6300184064|5.0|Gilliam's Brazil was released in at least 4 different cuts.<BR> <BR>In Australia the 142 minute directors version was released to the theatres, and that was the version with which I became familiar.<br />This VHS version is the 131 minute Universal release, which I believe is also the American cinema release,  and has about 11 minutes of material removed from the directors cut. It is hard to believe that a mere 11 minutes can change a movie so much, but this is a bastardised version of the picture. Not only has the content been altered, but the colour and soundtrack are not up to scratch on this video release. <br />Do yourself a favour, view one of the 20th century's great pieces of cinema on the directors cut DVD. It will be worth the extra.
B00005NGSD|4.0|Made in GER in 2001, Serial# 5-35147-2, Playing Time 48:18<br />I know most people will jump at the opportunity to grab this great album, especially since it was unavailable for the longest time.<br />BUT there's a slight twist here: sure, it includes 2 bonus tracks (\\"Suspender Love\\", the b-side to the \\"He's A Woman She's A Man\\" single, plus \\"Polar Nights\\" live, which was left out of the single-disc version of \\"Tokyo Nights\\" due to space constraints), HOWEVER this remastered version contains the EDITED version of \\"The Sails Of Charon\\"; the original Japanese pressing of this disc (released on CD back in 1989!) contained the FULL version, which is about 45 seconds longer.<br />So I saved a few bucks by avoiding the Japanese Remastered version (why pay more?). But I got a surgically altered version of my favorite track on this great album!!!<br />If that's unimportant to you, buy this version. But if you want the \\"original\\" full-length track, buy the Japanese re-issue... I simply HAD TO!!!
B000069AUI|5.0|Oh my. I honestly didn't think Coldplay's second effort could outdo \\"Parachutes\\" but with the fifth straight listening of the cd, they have so proved me wrong.  This cd had me right from the get go.  With their first cd, I loved every song, and that is the exact case with this album, only it's so much stronger.  <BR>Instead of beginning on a soft, light note like the guys did with their first album, \\"Politik\\" thrashes the notes with a harsh intensity that beckons the listeners attention.  I listened in absolute awe the entire time.  \\"God Put A Smile Upon Your Face\\" made me smile with glee while a few minutes later for \\"The Scientist\\" I was crying.  Not many musicians can bring me to tears that easily, but apparently, I have given up in trying to fight the battle with these guys.  <BR>While all of the songs are absolute gems, I think the ones that just stand out so much more for me are \\"Warning Sign\\" which also had me in more tears. Just hearing Chris Martin singing \\"when the truth is I miss you\\" does it for me. The word beautiful doesn't even do the song justice.  It doesn't do the album justice even!  Also, the title track is amazing.  It is so hard for me to pinpoint my favorite song on the album because they are all amazing.    <BR>I cannot stress enough how much I love this album.  I honestly think it may knock The Verve's \\"Urban Hymns\\" as my favorite album of all time.  <BR>The lyrics have improved, the music has improved.  Everything is beautiful with this album.  With all of the ... that MTV and pop radio is force feeding people, it's time for some real music. Resistance is futile people!  Coldplay is going to show us the way - and I am more than willing to follow them.
0316666343|5.0|I read a lot and have never read anything like this.  It is simply amazing and touching at the same time.  I loved Sebold's idea of heaven.  It is so simple, slow-moving and something I can hold onto.   Sebold also leaves the possibility that heaven is a process and not a final destination.  Always loved that thought. I also love how realistic and different the grief process is for every member of the family.  <br />Trust me a true original; do not miss this one.
B000000OSG|1.0|Weird, isn't it? GNR used to be a huge, gigantic, loud, big important rock band. Ten years later, it's hard to find more than 3 great songs on their magnum opus, Use Your Illusion. This disc,  #2 of 2, has exactly ZERO great songs. &quot;Pretty Tied Up&quot; is okay --- sounds like something off of Appetite for Destruction. The rest is really BAD.<br />&quot;My World&quot; is a weak joke. &quot;So Fine&quot; features some of the world's worst singing and lyrics. &quot;Breakdown&quot; isn't even halfway complete. I don't need an alternate version of &quot;Don't Cry.&quot; And &quot;Estranged&quot; sounds like Quiet Riot doing a bad impression of Queen.<br />I dig that cover, though. Very arty!
B00005QTAR|3.0|These DVD's normally pair episodes with some deep shared meaning - in this one, the idea is that peoples of past eras are largely ignorant and prone to find superstitious answers to solve life's msyteries  (In \\"Trek\\" lore, the inhabitants of the future are the technologically and ethically advanced descendants of savage and greedy fools - us).  <br />In \\"All Our Yesterdays\\", the Enterprise comes across the planet Sarpeidon - home to an advanced civilization that appears to have disappeared.  Their planet about to be destroyed by a supernova, the Sarpeidons left no hint of their escape.  Instead, Kirk, McCoy and Spock find a huge library cataloguing thousands of generations of the planet's existence (the best of times, the worst of times).  Perusing, though not entirely understanding the significance of the library and its strange librarian, Mr. Atoz,  all three learn too late that the library is actually the navigation center of a huge time machine through which the Sarpeidons have escaped to the past.  Unwittingly leaping into one such portal, Kirk finds himself trapped in a pre-industrial era in which he is branded a witch by typically ignorant natives of the time.  Spock and McCoy have it worse - vanishing into the planet's ice age (an era kept on catalog for prisoners) where they meet the lovely Zarabeth (Mariette Hartley - later to return as a sexy Terranian in Roddenberry's short-lived \\"Earth2\\" series, and also immortalized in a generation of Polaroid commercials).  In Spock's case, the metaphor for time travel is reversed - Zarabeth is a caring and loving person, but Spock's journey to a time before his ancestors cast out their emotions and their meat-eating diet has caused him to become a passionate savage.  (McCoy, however, does not revert to the primitive state of pre-20th century country doctors).  Falling in love with Zarabeth - also a future Sarpeidon sent to the past as a prisoner - he is willing to do anything to remain in the past with her (a specialsafeguard ensures her death should she try to return to the present).  The episode was later sequelized in the novel \\"Yesterday's Son\\" in which Spock returns to Sarpeidon for the son born of his union with Zarabeth, and confronts another sign of his wild days - Sub Commander Tal from \\"The Enterprise Incident\\".<br />\\"The Savage Curtain\\" was a more overt jab at those foolish primitives of our past - pitting the crew not only against simulacra of the evil past (barbarian warlord Genghis Khan, the warmongering Kahless who set the Klingon race into their bellicose ways, and Colonel Green, guilty of more recent crimes against humanity) but also against the naivete of our more noble ancestors - Abe Lincoln and the vulcan Surak.  Trapped on the world of Excalbia, the crew are subjects for that world's inhabitants to test the strength of good over evil.  Unsurprisingly, Lincoln and Surak aren't big on fighting at all, and are good's biggest liabilities.  The message of this episode is vague - is goodness stronger than evil because it does not measure itself according to strength?  Or perhaps the moral is that the lines between good and evil aren't so clear -but that was handled better in the episode \\"Errand of Mercy\\" in which both Humans and Klingons are kept from warring against each other by godlike Organians who play no favorites.  (Unsurprisingly, the Organians and Excalbians would meet years later in DC Comics's \\"Star Trek\\" monthly, in an issue titled \\"Errand of War\\".)  Either way, these episodes are Classic Trek at its weakest.
0784011206|5.0|The Rambo franchise began not as a mindless, flag-waving action saga, but as a thoughtful exploration of post-Vietnam America. Unfortunately, the second and third installments in the franchise were cheesy 80's action, which is how the character of John Rambo has been remembered; a cartoonish killing machine. Initially, Rambo was an innocent man, shocked by redneck local cops into reliving his Vietnam experience, and could not stop himself from reacting. Yet even so, Rambo knows right from wrong, prefering clear demonstrations of his military training in place of simply killing his enemies.<br />In this first film, impression was far worse than truth; Rambo kills no one, and the only obvious death (and later, an implied death in a car crash), are not directly caused by anti-hero Rambo. However, the film was (and still is), accused of being flooded with violence and killing.<br />If you take a moment and think past the stunts and the action, Rambo's search for place in a country unwilling to acknowledge his sacrifices is a poignant and striking portrayal of what Vietnam vets really faced upon their return home. No one wanted to think about the war, and our vets were a painful reminder to a nation's fragile ego that we had lost.<br />In the 1980's, acceptance gradually dawned, and Vietnam became a popular subject for movies. The movies became a sort of national catharsis, allowing us to heal through fantasies, such as a Special Forces vet going back to 'Nam and killing a bunch of VC, freeing POWs, and taking revenge in a typically red, white, and blue fashion. The second Rambo film and Chuck Norris' \\"Missing in Action\\" series are typical of the war as portrayed by Hollywood in the 80's.<br />\\"First Blood\\" was one of the first films to deal with the scars of Vietnam intellegently. That's right; an intellegent action film about the effect of the Vietnam war. Unlike the book, the John Rambo of the film is not so much a psychotic killer as he is a deeply hurt and emotionally damaged human being. The final confrontation and Vietnam \\"speech\\" are a wonderful, moving, and thoughtful commentary on the travesty inflicted on our soldiers by a thoughtless American public.<br />The cinematography and direction are excellent, and Stallone gives the best performance of his career as the troubled veteran. Great locations and action highlight one of the most important mainstream films of the early 80's.ly damaged human being.

B00005OAIE|4.0|Some of the tracks are a bit underdeveloped but have huge potential.  A bit like listenting to Eric Clapton's early work with Cream - it was vague, the lyrics weren't great, but the musicality was there, even if basic.  This kid obviously has huge potential and this is one CD we'll be listenting to in 10-15 years!
B000069HKH|5.0|The Rising more than lives up to its hype. I've relistened to the entire Springsteen oeuvre over the past three weeks, and in my estimation, in terms of sheer emotional power and mesmerizing music-making, The Rising is every bit the equal of Born to Run,  Born in the USA, or Tunnel of Love, great albums that also struck universal themes (and established Springsteen as New Jersey's pop Faulkner). Several tracks--the title song, Nothing Man, Empty Sky, Paradise, others--are indisputably great, and those that seem like familiar Springsteen efforts, like Waitin' on a Sunny Day, are very, very strong. (Like pizza at Seaside: when it's good, it's GREAT! And when it's not, it's still pretty good.) (By the way, all those early records, if you haven't recently discovered, sound as good today as on their release dates.) Compared to the current sides, Springsteen's earlier material--despite the famous musings on towns that \\"rip the bones from your back\\" and desolate images of \\"burned-out Chevrolets\\"--strikes me as several existential notches down from The Rising's life and death preoccupations. Ingeniously produced by Brendan O'Brien, The Rising is truly an album to live with, rewarding relistening and conveying measures of philosophical heft amid the walls and layers of sound and the impassioned lyrics. It's Springsteen in a new mode, literally rising to a higher level of concerns, with different sonic textures that show no fear of technology--although nothing here reaches for Radiohead or Bjork or other sonic adventurers. The beauty and power of the words (try to imagine virtually any other pop/rock writer taking on 9/11 with such intelligence), the passion of performance, and the rangy adventurousness of the music and the E-Street Band's accompaniment make The Rising my pick (over formidable competition from Wilco, The Vines, The Doves, Bjork, Ryan Adams, Lucinda Williams) as the year's best record.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I loved this movie in the theaters (saw it 3 times in one week) and I love it even more on DVD.  How is that possible you ask?  Well, this 2-disc set is simply jammed packed with monsterously good information and entertainment for the entire family.<br />Disc 1 - A smile immediately came to my face when the widesceen version played as a default (you can select the fullscreen version from the menu).  But the widescreen issue isn't as big a deal with PIXAR films since they restructure each frame of the film for a fullscreen presentation.  I haven't read any cooberating info but this seems to be the case with Monsters, Inc. too.  The only other options on this disc are a directors commentary (quite good, with minimal pauses) and an option to watch the film with an isolated sound effects track (very cool).<br />Disc 2 - After you've watched the movie it's time to delve into the worlds of PIXAR and Monsters, Inc.  The disc is separated into the Monster World which is aimed at kids and the young at heart and the Human World which offers much more depth and insight into the creation of the film.  The games offered in Monster World are fun and easy to learn.  Slowly but surely, games offered on DVD are getting better every day.  And lest I forget the Monster Handbook is a laugh riot!  There is a terrific tour of the new PIXAR studios as well as fly-throughs of some key sets created for the film in The Human World section.  This is also where you will see production art, deleted scenes, the original story treatment as well as a guide to the \\"in\\" jokes, original trailers, and much much more.  It will take a truly dedicated fan (and most of your day) to sit through it all in one sitting.<br />All of PIXAR'S DVD releases have been stellar and Monster, Inc. pushes the bar even higher.  By keeping the fun level high (keep an eye out for a wacky monkey) as well as separating the features into a fun and games section and a making-of section they have created a flawless DVD presentation and proved the old addage, \\"monsters lead such interesting lives.\\"tion and proved the old addage, \\"monsters lead such interesting lives.\\"
B00000634J|5.0|Beatles snobs and Lennon diehards will probably pick apart this CD for missing a few favorite tracks.  But those who, like myself, just want a one-stop guide to the legendary musician's work will be most pleased with this excellent retrospective.  All the key tracks are here: the quiet beauty of &quot;Imagine&quot; (one of the most influential pop tunes ever), the touching sincerity of &quot;Beautiful Boy&quot; (dedicated to his son Sean), the outright gorgeous &quot;Love,&quot; the signature anti-war anthem &quot;Give Peace a Chance,&quot; and the sap-free &quot;Woman.&quot;  Clearly, there is much more to Lennon than &quot;Lennon Legend,&quot; and those who gotta have it all should probably get his box set.  But for the casual listener who's looking for a pu-pu platter of the best of this visionary's solo work, &quot;Lennon Legend&quot; does the job nicely.
B00005LOUS|4.0|\\"The Grinch Who Stole Christmas\\" is one of those animated classics you watch every chirstmas to put you in the holiday spirit, or at least I do. \\"The Grinch\\" with Jim Carrey is definately one movie I will add to my list of must watch christmas movies (gotta love \\"National Lampoons Christmas Vacation\\")<BR>\\"The Grinch\\" has a different story line than the original to keep your intrest yet it keeps the same philosopy so you still have the sence of the old one.<BR>The people and their hair and clothes are amazing. The houses and all the props are done well and artisticly. I could watch the movie on mute just to see this but of course there are so many good lines to laugh at you can't do that. <BR>Bottom line 1-like Jim Carrey? 2-like the original grinch? 3-want a funny clean christmas movie? yes yes and yes = a must buy!
B0000683DH|4.0|I was slightly disappointed with the extras on this set.  I would like to have seen (heard, actually) additional commentary by Harve Bennett and perhaps from the cast as well (although Nick Meyer is a treat to listen to).  The new interviews reveal nothing that hasn't been covered in William Shatner's \\"Star Trek Movie Memories\\" book and there's only one trailer included (and not the one I remember, possibly a TV spot, with the great legend, \\"Somewhere at the darkest reaches of the universe a battle is about to begin...a battle between good and evil...between a warrior and a madman...between the awesome power of the starship Enterprise and the wrath of Khan.  For some it will be their first mission...for others it will be their last.\\")  Considering how successful this film was, it should deserve the same treatment ST:TMP Director's Edition scored.

B000002UAO|5.0|For me, reviewing ANY album by the Beatles is a bit intimidating.  But I will toss in my $.02 and declare that &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; is a tremendous album that signaled an important transition for the Beatles, who, by the end of 1965, flexed their songwriting muscles even harder.  A winning mix of folkish pop with some country twang, &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; has some qualified winners: listen to the sitar in the trippy but marvelous folk ditty &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot;; the bluesy rock of &quot;Drive My Car&quot;; and the introspective, self-reflecting lyrics in &quot;In My Life,&quot; one of Lennon's strongest compositions.  But my personal favorite is the often overlooked album cut &quot;Wait,&quot; which features lead vocals from both Lennon and McCartney.  Following this album, they would move on to bigger things including the 1966 followup &quot;Revolver.&quot;  I don't profess to be a diehard Beatles guru, but &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; is a must-have for anyone looking to start a collection of their work.
B00003CXXJ|4.0|I don't know of anyone who didnt like this movie. From kids who are 4 to adult of over 50. It's one of those movies that anyone can enjoy.<BR>The chemistry between Shrek (mike myers) and the goat (eddie murphy) is fantastic. Add a princess played by cameron diaz and you have the perfect trio. <BR>The adventure is a story never told before yet it seems framiliar. It's got some real funny parts and along with the ultimate leason that it doesn't matter what you look like.<BR>What else do you need? popcorn and a comfy couch and poof the perfect nite!
B00003CX96|5.0|I love this movie! I remember first watching it when I was about ten, and I liked it because I thought the dad was funny and the bike racing was cool. As I've matured, my views toward the movie have matured as well. <br />The dad is still funny, and the bike racing is still cool. That hasn't changed.<br />I know exactly what it feels like to want to change who you are because you haven't matured enough to realize that who you are is plenty good enough without having to be changed. I can identify with Moocher's line &quot;The time comes when we all have to go our own ways.&quot; No matter how close you are to the people you know in high school, everyone matures in different directions. Sometimes you remain close to your friends, and sometimes you don't. And there are times when your dreams have to remain the same, even if your idols change. And even your dreams have to include college sometimes.
B00005YUNY|4.0|No Yes fan should even think about not owning this.<br />I saw the show in London on this tour and it was truly awe-inspiring. To have this on DVD is a delight.<br />Were it not for two minor gripes I would have awarded 5-stars. Firstly, the mix in some places should have brought the orchestra more to the fore. Typically this occurs when Jon Anderson strums his acoustic guitar - hearing the backing would be much more lovely. Secondly and I hope it's not my DVD player, but the annoying animation icon won't switch off at the outset, despite you programming it that way. Accidentally I found the sub-title button does this properly, so there it is.<br />Otherwise Close to the Edge, Gates of Delirium and Ritual will blow your mind away. The world should be forced to watch and listen, for this is how music should be ...
B000069AUI|4.0|before buying this cd, I was honestly a little skeptical, thinking to myself, &quot;can this compare to 'Parachutes'?&quot; i'm not a diehard fan, but I really do love their music and have anticipated the release of 'a Rush of Blood to the Head' for some time. well, it has lived up to all my expectations and more. it is quite different from 'parachutes' in all the right ways. please buy this. there will be no disappointments. also, please disregaurd the review given on cdnow.com from the editor or who ever. it couldn't be more untrue.
B000068IEU|4.0|The story is about a couple of girls Lucy Grantheim and Sandra Cassel on their way to a concert but stop to buy some drugs. The drug dealers are sex murders and they beat and rape one of the girls and then set out for Canada. On the way, the car breaks down and with a weird twist they wind up at one of the girls parents house - the \\"revenge\\" begins.<br />The movie is extremely gruesome.<br />One of the makers of the movies is Cunningham, who went on to make Friday the 13th.
B000066NW0|5.0|this is an all out great cd....her lyrics express the way she feels, and you can also relate to them.  Some people may not get the meaning of some, but they all are sending some sort of message.  Most people don't or didnt like her because they hyped her up on the radio, but trust me, this is a cd worth spending your money for.
0140868445|5.0|Dylan Baker manages to give distinctive voices to the Joads and to each of the other memorable characters in this masterpiece --without obscuring the essential voice of Steinbeck himself.  This is a reading worthy of this magnificent novel.
1567184855|5.0|This book is so believable and has a lot of detail about the afterlife. Be sure to read this book first, then follow up by reading \\"Destiny of Souls\\" by the same author. I have read this book 3 times so far, and each time it changes me. It reminds me of why I'm here in this life, and there is a purpose for it, and that there is a reason for the pain and suffering. Reading this book is better than going to a shrink (for me.) Actually though, it makes me want to be regressed to learn what my blueprint for life is so that I can know for sure that I'm on the right track. \\"Journey of Souls\\", and especially \\"Destiny of Souls\\" have a lot of similarities to Robert Monroe's \\"Far Journeys\\" 3 book series. I also highly recommend Monroe's books if you are interested in the spirit world.<br />This book is not like those other \\"Life after Death\\" books, where a person goes through a tunnel, speaks to a guide or God or whomever and then has to come back. There is so much more detail here. It will trigger memories for most people about how it feels to be \\"home\\" again. Very comforting.
B000002H5I|5.0|At the time of this album's release, much more attention was given by the black  community to NWA's Straight Outta Compton and Public Enemy's It Takes A Nation Of Millions To Hold Us Back, but this debut release has aged far better than both of them.<br />     &quot;Behind The Wall&quot; is the most accurate description I've found of what it feels like to be a police officer answering a domestic disturbance call. The frustration at not beng able to really help the people involved, as well as the platitudes that often have to be uttered in place of honesty,-all these feelings are captured here with graphic accuracy.  Like a nightmarish tape loop, the cycle of violence sometimes seems to be endless.<br />     Like violence, racism is rampant in America today.  But we have to remember that there are many good cops on duty as well as those who embaress the job and themselves. Tracy Chapman takes a giant first step in the path to better cultural understanding with this incredible album!
B00000JCOV|5.0|This is the best hard rock CD! Slipknot is an assault on all of your senses. Well, maybe not taste, but oh well.
1573225517|4.0|This is the story of a 35-year-old owner of a used record store, told in the first person and in the present tense.  The main focus of his musings is his unsuccessful relationships with women, and the feelings of pain, rejection, and inadequacy that those relationships have produced.  <br />The first 25% of the book is wonderful.  No one I know has described with such painful accuracy the feelings of rejection and inadequacy that a MAN feels when a romantic affair breaks up.  There seem to be thousands of such books for women, but maybe men are too macho to publicly admit that it hurts.<br />The book is very well written, and it held my interest throughout.  Partly that was because Rob's main interest in life (besides sulking about his unfulfilled life) is rock 'n roll music, which has always been one of my main interests as well.  The characters are believable and well drawn, even if none of them are entirely pleasant.<br />But after describing the breakups of his previous relationships, Rob (the narrator and main character) begins to degenerate into an embittered, whining, older version of Holden Caulfield - which in my opinion is a stinging criticism.  He's rude, selfish, and inconsiderate, and blames his miserable conduct on how badly his love affairs have turned out.  I don't want to give everything away, but I think that at the end Rob is one of the most undeservedly lucky guys I've ever read about.<br />I expect men will like the book better than women will, but I could be wrong.  And in fact, women will probably learn more from it than men will.  I certainly found it worth my time, despite my annoyance at the self-indulgent main character, and it's an easy read. <br />Note: I haven't seen the movie which was based on this book, so my comments above are based entirely on the book itself.
B000068QY7|5.0|Well, Oasis are at it again and return to top form... erm, well I don't think they ever left to be honest.  Bad marketing in the US and occasional over production of songs (thats the critics talking- hell Be Here Now was the only cd to win a grammy!) may have kept noelie g's talents in the shadows. This album allows us to listen to someone other that noel take the pen and paper.  Liams three, Songbird, BOADC and Better Man are all excellent songs that differ greatly from one another, and happen to be some of the best on the album.  Noel has his say though, with his simply amazing Stop Crying Your Heart Out and Little By Little.  And to open it all off, the thumping rocker The Hindu Times.  If youre a fan - you already have it.  If you only know wonderwall and Morning Glory songs, then this will be something you'll love.  And if you dont know who Oasis are, try tracks four and six.
B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix will go down in film history books as \\"The film that changed cinema forever\\". True, films have done that before: (Jaws, Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Pulp Fiction et al) but the Matrix is different in that not only did it change audience's expectations of action cinema but also impacted on countless movies to date.<br />The film itself is the epitome of cool that stands out from the slew of unimaginative science fiction that Hollywood reels out, and with Keanu Reeves and Carrie Anne Moss making an unlikely duo in a post-apocalyptic world ruled by artificially intelligent machines, the film finds itself worlds away from admittedly second-rate sci fi cinema.<br />You could argue, as some critics did, that the film's plot is simply an excuse to hang cool effects on, but the premise slowly shapes into such an intricate plot, where machines have taken over the world (a popular idea for sci fi films, with this having similarities to Terminator 2) and then the small amount of snotty critics are silenced. What the Wachowski brothers have done is so imaginative that no film has ever come close to its intricacies and futuristic ideas. Add hints and nudges from Vertigo, classic Western films and Kung-fu karate films into the story and the amazing journey is made even more fascinating and involving.<br />The visuals incorporated throughout the story are absolutely amazing; with the \\"flow-mo\\" being the coolest visual effect those effects boffins have done since that water tentacle flowed through air in The Abyss. Imitated to death, the scene where Keanu's character Neo dodges bullets is nonetheless the pinnacle of uber-coolness. With thought provoking, mind-bending lines like: \\"It's the smell, if there is such a thing\\"; the film's script is peppered with fascinating lines concerning the very nature of \\"what is real?\\" Hence the clever advertising campaign for the movie's release: \\"Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is, you have to see it for yourself\\".<br />The Matrix has indeed changed cinema. Regardless, it's a great film, loaded to the retinas with out- of- this-world effects, great villians (Agent Smith!), great action set-pieces and awesome stunts from martial arts expert Wu Ping. And with the DVD (awesome stuff, everyone has to own this disc) and upcoming sequel in progress- The Matrix Reloaded, the Matrix is a film that not only has affected filmgoers everywhere, but has also leaked into the fan boy culture of the movie world. To quote Neo: \\"Whoa\\"./>The Matrix has indeed changed cinema.

0783226063|1.0|Don't get me wrong, I happen to like the work of David Lynch.....but taking one of SF's biggest epics short of Lord of the Rings is a daunting task.....and Lynch got daunted *real* bad!<br />Firstly, key pivotal scenes were completly left out, totally pissing off fans of the Book (I've read it at least 10 times)<br />Secondly, the addition of stuph not in the book (Weirding Devices & Heart Plugs) totally irked the hell out of me.<br />Thirdly, completely changing the whole reason why Emperor Shaddam IV moves against House Atreides is beyone totally inexcusable!<br />The TV version I switched off as soon as I saw Lynch's name replaced with 'Alan Smithee'.....how can you make something this bad, even worse by adding footage and the cheesey pastel drawings? It only served to further muddy the waters for those who haven't read the book.<br />IMHO, get the Sci-Fi Channel's mini-series adaption.....the acting's a bit stiff and it's not really much more than a Costume Drama, but at least the scenes us fans wanted are in this one!<br />I did get ONE good use out of this piece of tripe.....When I was working in a video store we woulod have a huge number of kids come in near the end of the school year and rent movies that were originally books.....We had one particulary obnoxious kid who came in *real* late and demanded we rent him a movie made from a novel<br />Well, I rented him this gobbler<br />Would you believe that the kid and his father had the CHUTZPAH to confront me about the 'F' he got on his book report?<br /> I told the father that there's absolutely no excuse for not reading the book and because his son came in so late in the game it was one of the only movies made from a book that I could think of.
B00003CXAT|4.0|Quixotic, white-haired Scottish billionaire clones dinosaurs and populates island with them.  Newman, his obese computer wiz, attempts to embezzle dinosaurs and in the process royally shags everyone over by completely derailing the security system which keeps the dinosaurs at bay, just before he is himself eaten slow and good by a newly-liberated dinosaur.  Dinosaurs run amok.  Dinosaurs continue to run amok.  Further amok running on the part of dinosaurs.  What's not to like?
B000005ALN|5.0|This is a deeply introspective peice. \\"Jesus To A Child\\" and \\"Star People\\" tell of George's-Mr Michael's past love and inner demons respectively. \\"Spin the Wheel\\" speaks of sitting around waiting on a cheating lover to come home. You may listen to all of this and discount it as drivel but you would be sadly mistaken. I think his pop/jazz/R&B/torch song style shows incredible development from Wham to this work. I would call this one best offerings to date. Too bad he did not tour allot to support this effort because maybe more people may have bought it. <br />

0316666343|5.0|This book grabbed me from page one, and I read it straight through.  It's a remarkable look at how each of us affects the lives of others.  The book had a couple of flaws but none serious.  I most enjoyed how the book showed the different ways each person grieves while not passing judgement on the differences. Lovely Bones portrays the peace and heartache of knowing that while we matter in space and time, when we die, others go on without us, albeit with a piece of us in their hearts. I highly recommend this book.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|I thought this was a good movie. OK, it may not be completely accurate, but no one could argue about Russell Crowe's top notch performance. I can't believe Denzel beat him out of the best actor award. He steals the show.
B00005TT77|3.0|I'm a little mystified here. Tribute albums are supposed to be about an artist intrepeting someone else's work in their own style. Otherwise, why bother to redo a classic? The best tracks on this tribute/soundtrack album to the film of the same name are those tracks that remain faithful in spirit but take the material into a slightly different direction. Two of Us by Mann &amp; Penn and Vedder's You've Got To Hide YOur Love Away do both and quite well. Many of the other tracks succeed for precisely the same reason.<br />There are a couple of flawed tracks. I have to agree that Grand daddy's version of Revolution snuffs the life out of the song. Lennon already did a slow version that was quite good thank you very much. Sure, the originals are classics but what keeps the material fresh is the ability to reintrepet this stuff in a contemporary style. I may not like all the selections but I appreciate the effort.<br />This isn't meant to be a replacement for The Beatles versions of the same songs. Instead, it was designed for fans of these artists, the film and Beatles fans as well. At worst it could do nothing more than spark more interest in the band and their history. At worst, it's a fine tribute album that never strays from what's important--a great song well played and sung.
B00004SYWZ|5.0|In a world full of really awful popular music being made by cutesy or trampy teenagers and excessively foul-mouthed rappers who are all style and no substance, thank God for this comeback album! There is not one bad song on this disc, and I like it more and more everytime I listen to it. Particularly good are the title track, \\"You'll Never Get Over Me\\", and \\"Little Black Heart.\\" If you liked all of a-ha's other albums, you're sure to like this one too, and I highly recommend it.
B000066JES|5.0|This is one of Manowar's best albums, period. It has songs that go into every kind of sound from their entire career from Call to Arms which has their trademark Pounding triplets (which Bathory and others later used) which they haven't really used too much since Sign of the Hammer, epic classical compositions on the scale of Kings of Metal, and speedy firestorms of pure metal like those found on the second half of Louder than Hell. All in all, yes there is almost a half hour of what many term \\"filler\\" but I found this section to be the best \\"Classical\\" stuff theyve ever done. I love the Elvis  \\"cover\\" An American Trilogy, it almost brings me to tears with its beauty and Eric Adams is the star of the show on this album. He sings better than he has for years instead of growling or grunting his way thru an album (like Louder Than Hell, which I also love but obviously not as much as this), and the production is a step up from previous ones as well. No bass solos or guitar solos (other than in the songs that is), just pure melody and power. It all concludes with \\"Fight Until We Die\\" a fast stormer. One new thing is that much of the album is in \\"D\\" tuning, kind of like some of Hail to England. I didn't expect an album of this magnitude during this stage of their career and I am honestly shocked on how good this release is. ...
B000066NW0|5.0|I visited the States over the summer and heard an Avril Lavigne song. My cousin had her album, and after listening to it I decided to buy the CD. It really is a great album - my faves are Complicated and Sk8er Boi but the others are great too. If you're not sure about buying it, get it - I'm sure you'll like it.
B0000687L5|5.0|great great movie,<br />I watched it in theatre pre-view in NYC about 2-3 years ago,<br />and for month waited to see it again.<br />touching,<br />beautiful, beautiful music,<br />great acting.<br />a must see.
B000001FN8|3.0|By 1988 alot of things had changed in the musical landscape. Newer but not neccesarily better production techniques were being used and everyone from Judas Priest to Yes were using more &quot;modern&quot; sounding things like drum machines or an &quot;echoey&quot; mix. Now the Scorpions are &quot;guilty&quot; in using some of these techniques on this album, and all songs seem tailored to be hits, BUT, this album is not without great songs that can match up to anything from &quot;Blackout&quot; or &quot;Love at First Sting&quot;. &quot;Rhythm of Love&quot; and especially the very inspiring &quot;Don't Stop at the Top&quot; can be definitely called classic songs. Good for the hardcore fan and some of the last truly melodious material they worked with.
B00005QIPH|4.0|The Strokes (along with the likes of The Hives and The White Stripes) are at the forefront of today's garage/college rock movement. The distinguishing thing about the above bands is the ability to touch base with the music's roots....in The Strokes case, that means the classic NYC bands of Television and the Velvet Underground. Much like those bands, this is adult music with a D.I.Y. approach that hasn't been seen recently since the heyday of Lo-Fi. <BR>Derivative? Sure, after close to 50 years of Rock'N'Roll, almost everything is. A breath of fresh air? Yes, it is, which is why it seems so different to everything else that's out there. This is old school punk rock, intelligently performed and brillantly produced. The material is solid and consistant. My only knock is the removal of &quot;NYC Cops&quot; from the US release in the wake of 9/11 (for obvious reasons) and the altered cover art by corporate wimps . The import of &quot;Is This It&quot; would rate a 4 1/2 to 5 star rating because of both's inclusion...seek it out if you love this record and want the complete work as intended by the band. <BR>It may be lost upon the Top 40 crowd, those who think a band has to have a DJ to be cool and nu-metal mallrats, but bands like The Strokes keep you believing in the true spirit Rock'N'Roll as outsider music that challenges and provokes. <BR>Revolution? probably not..since radio programmers will prevent this stuff infecting the mainstream any further than it already has, but in a music world filled with tired rap-metal whiners and talentless pop divas..they do make for a much welcomed change of pace.<BR>Rock'N'Roll isn't dead afterall...Thank God.
B00004S8X5|5.0|My parents bought me this album the year it came out in the UK (I think it was 1988, so I would have been 4 at the time) and I have loved it ever since. I played it hundreds of times, so often that it wore out two years ago (I had the tape) and I've been searching everywhere for a copy of it, and now I've finally found it. This will always be my fave album ever, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone.
B00005QW5X|5.0|Sure this movie has transvestites, glitter and rock-n-roll, but make no mistake... it is not a fluff piece.<br />There are many funny gags, and some humorous moments, but the topic at hand is very serious indeed. This is a very well done thought provoking film about where you've been and where you're going.<br />John Cameron Mitchell is truly a genius, and this movie is an inspiration to all of us who are looking for our 'other halves'.

0380789035|4.0|\\"American Gods\\" seems a little more celebrated than it deserves to be, but it is a great beach read. Gaiman's hero Shadow, about to be released from a long stay in the hoosegow with nothing to recommend him to the world outside but a facility with coin tricks, is easy to like but oddly passive. He finds himself a foot soldier in a war between the old gods of America (divine pagan immigrants from every culture, subsisting like down-at-heels landed gentry on declining scraps of belief) and the new gods of secular technoculture. The details are amusing, well researched, and sufficiently surprising to keep the pages turning briskly.<br />The thematic tag line is, \\"This is a bad land for gods.\\"  It's a peculiar thing to say about America, which not only has been, throughout its history, one of the most enthusiastically religious countries on earth, but which has also extended by far the warmest welcome to the widest variety of gods. What does strike a genuinely American note, and partially justifies the title, is the spaciousness of its unfolding. Shadow spends most of the novel on the open road, on one mysterious errand after another.<br />Gaiman is farming ground a bit like what Tim Powers has been working the last few decades: fantasies that traverse real world landscapes, and expose high-stakes occult conflicts roiling under  their skins. Gaiman is better at smooth pacing and dialog; but Powers is better at conveying the electric crackle when a serious conspiracy theory blows in, and at filling in the shadows at the narrative's edge with something more like myth and less like whimsy. Afficianados of Powers will probably enjoy this book; those who like this one should give Powers a try. Good starting points are \\"The Anubis Gate\\" or \\"Last Call.\\"
B000002TQV|5.0|This record amazes me as a hard rock fan (my favorite bands include Tool, Incubus, Smashing Pumpkins, etc.) because despite its mellow and at times \\"mainstream pop-rock\\" sound, it comes off as a work of genius because of the combination of great lyrics, beautiful melodies, and, of course, the lead singer's outstanding voice. I find this to be just as enjoyable a listen as OK COMPUTER or KID A, despite the fact that it's much less abstract and artsy.<br />Song-by-song breakdown:<br />1. Planet Telex: the lyrics on this song are pretty much meaningless (I read somewhere that the band recorded this song while drunk), but the music creates the perfect atmosphere to begin the record.<br />2. The Bends: perhaps the most radio-friendly song on the album, I sometimes wonder why this wasn't a smash single on pop radio while \\"Wonderwall\\" by Oasis took the charts by storm. Anyway, I enjoy the song, but it's definitely not the album's best.<br />3. High and Dry: a good acoustic ballad with interesting lyrics. Again, it's not one of my very favorites, but an excellent song nonetheless.<br />4. Fake Plastic Trees: another mainly acoustic song, but this one has outstanding lyrics. Delivers a rather sad message.<br />5. Bones: I have never really \\"gotten into\\" this track for some reason; it seems too much like R.E.M. to me, which is not at all the style I think Radiohead excells at.<br />6. (Nice Dream): this one just may have my vote for the best song on the album. A soft and \\"textured\\" song with an incredible atmosphere, the first half or so reveals an elated feeling, but this gives way to a grim ending. I am usually not an \\"arsty\\" type of person, so you know this song has to be powerful when I say my emotions flow along with the song as I listen =).<br />7. Just (You Do It To Yourself): my personal favorite of the three obvious pop-rock songs from the record. An incredibly catchy melody and awesome lyrics make this the band's best radio-friendly song of all IMO.<br />8. My IronLong: a song entirely devoted to slamming the popularity of their own 1993 single, \\"Creep.\\" A somewhat forgettable melody and lyrics that just don't belong on this type of album, along with the fact that I enjoy \\"Creep,\\" make this one of the less enjoyable songs for me.<br />9. Bullet Proof (I Wish I Was): it's a toss-up between this and \\"(Nice Dream)\\" for best song on the album. The record's softest song, yet the music itself on this song is easily the best of all 12 tracks.<br />10. Black Star: the third radio-friendly pop song. It's okay, but after hearing \\"The Bends\\" and \\"Just,\\" I sometimes get a little bored with this style by this point in the record.<br />11. Sulk: another good atmospheric song.<br />12. Street Spirit: amazingly, the generally upbeat mood of the record gives way to a miserable and hopeless-sounding closing track. The monotonous but incredible guitar riff is a perfect foreshadowing to Radiohead's tone in later records.
B00006F7XJ|5.0|I have heard the best CAMEL album of all time and it is not &quot;Mirage,&quot; &quot;The Snow Goose&quot; or &quot;Moonmadness.&quot; It wasn't recorded in the Seventies. But in its own sly way, it recalls some of the best elements of progressive rock's heyday, while steadfastly maintaining a contemporary sound. With &quot;A Nod And A Wink,&quot; Camel's founder and perennial guiding light, Andy Latimer, has crafted what must be regarded as his masterwork.<br />As one would expect, there are copious tasteful and melodic guitar solos. Some, such as the supple lead on &quot;Boy's Life&quot; are so beautiful as to elicit tears. Others are so mean and nasty, jabbing and lancing that they are like body blows. But the studious prog fan will pick out paeans to a time past, to &quot;the bands that ruled the world.&quot; Genesis is clearly recalled in &quot;Fox Hill.&quot; Pink Floyd and Camel of the Kit Watkins era are quoted in the closing anthem &quot;For Today.&quot; You will hear hints of Supertramp, some Alan Parsons Project, Moody Blues and Jethro Tull. And for the longtime Camel fan, there are many touches of vintage Latimer/Bardens style arrangements.<br />This album is a trip. Sound effects tell us we're going for a train ride through the English countryside. But the lyrics conjure up images of sleeping and dreaming, familiar territory for prog concept albums. Whatever the vehicle, Latimer, lyricist Susan Hoover and the Y2K Camel band comprised of keyboardist Guy LeBlanc (of Nathan Mahl), Denis Clement on drums, and veteran bassist Colin Bass weave a thoroughly captivating spell over the listener. Prepare to be entranced for nearly an hour while soaring, swooping, diving melodies and stop-on-a-dime time changes, floating flute, jaw-dropping guitar and always thoughtful, sometimes playful lyrics all conspire to take you back to another time. The album is a trip. It is a beautiful, awe-inspiring trip. I guarantee you will never forget your first listen.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|A younger generation does not know, or perhaps is not interested in, musical theater or musical films. But there was a time when great love stories, whether tragic or triumphant, and great drama was brought about through theatrics, film and above all, song and dance. The musicals of the early twentieth century, among them South Pacific, Carousel, The Sound of Music, The King and I, Oaklahoma and numerous others, combined visuals and great songs to carry out a genuinely beautiful story. Baz Luhrman, avant-garde artist extraordinare, manages to capture youthful and adult audiences with his MTV-style pop art movies (as Romeo and Juliet proved). Moulin Rouge is, in my opinion, a revival of a romantic musical. Only through great performances, such as Ewan Mcgregor's as Christian, the English poet lured into a romance with cabaret singer and courtesan Satine (Nicole Kidman), can such a musical be truly successful. The love songs, especially played during the scene in which Satine and Christian talk about the nature of love atop a crystal elephant, includes the hits from the 80's like &quot;Love Lift Us Up Where We Belong&quot; and David Bowies' &quot;Heroes&quot;, the signature song of the whole movie is &quot;Nature Boy&quot;. The red curtain opening up to reveal an old-fashioned &quot;cinema&quot; successfuly evokes the period, along with the costumes and the recreation of the Moulin Rouge, an 1890's cabaret nightclub that would be the equivalent of Vegas for Victorian gentlemen. The movie was a marvelous piece of art, and I disliked the fact that it did not get the prestige it deserved, such as Best Picture Award. I highly suggest you own this movie which is definately Luhrman's finest masterpiece. I am also anticipating a live-broadway musical version of Luhrman's Moulin Rouge. Think of the sold-out tickets !
B00006690G|5.0|ok first off Say What you Say is worth the price just to hear Dre dis that fruit Dupri!!!!! I love it. Til i collapse gets the honorable mension award, with White America cummin in a close 3rd. dont listen to the guy who gave it 3 stars this album even tops a burned cd with all your favorite songs!!!<BR>A MUST BUY!!!
B00005NP04|5.0|Martina McBride truly is the best singer in country music today.  I first saw her sing &quot;Where Would You Be&quot; at this year's ACM's and I fell in love.  I went to buy this cd and now &quot;Where Would You Be&quot; is my all time favorite song.  She sings with a power and emotion that you can't find in many other singers.  Songs like &quot;Strangers&quot; (which truly should have been a single) and &quot;Independence Day&quot; (her career hit) show you how she can totally sing different styles.  I also love &quot;Wild Angels&quot; and &quot;Valentine&quot; (with pianist Jim Brickman).  The only two songs I don't like are &quot;Life #9&quot; (I never liked 2-step) and &quot;I Love You (which was her most successful song- 5 weeks at #1 but it's a little too pop-like for me).  You can't go wrong with this cd, there's something for everyone!!
B00004W510|4.0|I love The Band!  I have the records and tapes and wanted it on CD.  What I don't like about this is all the extras.  I don't really want to hear the false starts. I find them distracting. I'd be perfectly happy with a CD of the original recording. This is more for a scholar of rock music than for general listening.
0792839749|2.0|The movie is so sugary sweet  that one really needs a shower and an insulin shot. The Sherman Brothers are almost as shameful as Andrew Lloyd Weber when they play that incredibly annoying title song over and over  and over again. As if we didn't hear it  the first  seven times. It is one of the annoying tunes you can't get out of your head. Please make them stop.<br />I'm a musical lover.  I saw the movie when I was 12 and thought it was pure  nonsense.  I remember everyone in school   called it Pretty Sh-tty Bang Bang.  So thirty years later  is my reaction the same?<br />Yea!  It's way too long and much ado about nothing. It takes 14 minutes for the opening credits to give us the back history of the car which really has no bearing on the story whatsoever. Hadn't the producer or director heard of editing??  This is what killed the film musical.<br />Dick Van Dyke is a ne'er do well inventor with two kids. Sally Anne Howes almost runs the kids over and come to talk to Dick Van Dyke.  Van Dyke rescues a car his kids love that is scheduled for the junk heap. He rebuilds it and they all go for a ride in it.   Van Dyke tells   a fantasy story  about Nasty Bulgarians wanting the car he has reconditioned. The fantasy story lasts two hours.  Boy did they take a wrong turn. <br />The fantasy story is not as interesting as the original story of the romance between Sally ann Howes and Dick Van Dyke and this fantasy story takes up about two hours  of the three hour movie. About one hour and 45 minutes of the fantasy needed to be cut. But I guess they thought it was cute. I'm sure they also thought the title song was cute. I'm sure they thought those cute kids could sing. <br />Sally Ann Howes has a perfectly annoying name--Truly Scrumptious. And those kids who can't sing (didn't anyone notice this?)  croon the \\"Truly Scrumptious\\" song to her. It made this twelve year old roll his eyes. The adult me had the same reaction.  Please make those kids  stop singing that awful song. It's enought to make one stop loving musicals.<br />Okay Dick Van Dyke is likeable enough but not as effective as in Mary Poppins.  He shines with the song \\"The Old Bamboo\\" ( the best number) and his caring for the kids.  Alas, he's railroaded by the insipid story and material. Someone also told him not to use an English accent although his kids and father have one. <br />Sally Ann  Howes is charming enough and perfectly cast in a part that Julie Andrews (the wise)  probably turned down.  She is railroaded by the material especially  that awful ballad \\"Lonely Man\\"  sung in an operatic style  that can not be appreciated by Musical theatre buffs, opera buffs  nor kids. Please make her stop singing it . Please make her stop twirling her skirt and running through the countryside. It isn't cute.<br /> I chuckled out loud at Lionel Jeffries'  travelling  song \\"Posh\\" which he sings  suspended in his cabin from a zeppelin while kidnapped.  An absolute highlight.  There is also some over the top annoying buffonery from Gert Frobe, Anna Quayle, Benny Hill  and the two kidnap men.<br />The magical Dee dee Wood and Mark Breaux who wonderfully choreographed Mary Poppins and Sound of Music  ( and recreated Michael Kidds  Lil Abner) are apparently at a loss here as there work is almost entirely hack. The Sherman Brothers really needed to rewrite songs instead of the awful  mish mash they have assembled here.<BR>A spoonful of rewrites could have made the score go down!<BR>Put that in your candy bar!<br />There is too much bad candy here and not enough substance. It isn't truly scrumpttious. It isn't Toots Sweet. It isn't cute. Run for your insulin.
0060977493|5.0|By far the most fluid, thick, and beautiful book I have ever read. It takes a chapter or two to understand what Roy is saying, but once you start to get it you never want to leave. It is the most joyous of sorrows, and the most georgous of filths. Not to be taken with a narrow mind, it is about the small things in life. The little beauties. If you get it, you will love it, and if you don't love it, then you don't get it.
B000002UB3|5.0|Again, I shall try to present my view of this album from my own historical perspective.  Arriving on the scene in the winter of 1969, Abbey Road came out when I was a senior in high school, having just been accepted into UCLA.  From the first listen, there was a certain sophistication, a world-weary, \\"been there, done that\\" feel to the music. This was especially true on the first side (as of course CD's were more than 20 or so years away), which featured a series of vignette-like songs: Ringo's \\"Octopuses Garden\\" and Paul's \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" typified the lot.  The single, John's lyrically too-cute-by-half \\"Come Together\\" backed with George's almost-maudlin \\"Something\\", also failed to impress.  Paul's \\"Oh Darling\\" at least had some rock-n-roll guts, and John's \\"I Want You\\" was powerfully haunting as it compared love to a drug and hinted at \\"sexual addiction\\" (an idea few had ever contemplated in 1969).<br />The songs on the first side might have been thought spectacular had they been produced by any of the Beatles' contemporaries (The Rolling Stones, The Who, Chicago, etc.), but by then, the group that had released Sergeant Pepper and \\"White Album\\" had given us a rather different expectation.  Fortunately, the album is more than saved by the brilliance of the second side.  From start to finish, this side crackles with intensity.  It has it all, from tender melodies (\\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\", \\"Here Comes the Sun\\"), to driving rock (\\"Polythene Pam/She Came in Through the Bathroom Window\\", \\"Carry that Weight\\", \\"The End\\"), but also there is a sly double entendre in much of the lyrical content.  \\"You never give me your money, you only give me your funny paper\\" alludes to the difficulties they were having at making a go as businessmen and the failures of Apple Records. \\"Carry that Weight\\" and \\"The Sun King\\" poke fun at the notion of being pop icons, while \\"Bathroom Window\\" hints at the nature of \\"groupies\\" (who probably didn't really exist until the Beatles).<br />The best thing about the second side, however, is how the music so effortlessly and seamlessly flows from one song to another.  I am hard-pressed to think of any other pop act who had tried this format prior. As has been pointed out, the song snippets were ideas that had been around for awhile, but the notion of putting them together (and in the order chosen) was pure genius.  It was almost as if, upon hearing them for the first time, you thought \\"yeah! That's how it should go.\\" The group clearly knew they were calling it quits, and wanted to go out as winners.  Putting personalities aside, a true team effort emerged.  And ever since that day, no rock act has topped the overall brilliance exhibited by the Beatles from Revolver through to Abbey Road.<br />A great enough album on its own, Abbey Road truly shines when placed in its historical context.  You must own it.
0316666343|5.0|A random savage act of violence literally eviscerates 14 year old Suzie (last name Salmon, like the fish) from her family, her friends, and her life in our world. When we first meet her in the opening of  The Lovely Bones, she is putting herself back together in her afterlife. As she relates her story to us, she watches her family and friends cope with her disappearance and the aftermath in the days, weeks months and years after, she struggles to make sense of what life and death is.<br />This was not easy to read: its not a romance, she's really dead, the afterlife is where she's at (there's no happy ending for Suzie). In fact, Suzie pointedly  says more than once that her afterlife is not everyones, that it is HER mind's imaginings of what her Heaven should be, with junctures of several like-minded individuals. It could have been named the 'Lonely Bones', because its themes are of loss, of loneliness, and ultimately, learning to live with yourself- however you are. It shows how separating life and loneliness is to humans (even to the dead), and how raw it can be as over time, even as you become used to it.<br />Alice Sebold has written a piece of fiction that drew me in, wrapped me up in it, and now, I think I'm probably not going to sleep well for a few days. For what its worth, I think its particularly interesting that I enjoyed and really delved into this book, given that I am atheist, do not believe in an afterlife, and ordinarily chuckle at stories involving \\"ghosts\\". This is definitely one of the best books I've read in a long time. The prose is literate, the imagery vivid and the characters are well defined. The story's purpose is finally revealed at the end. Some may find it dissatisfying, not understanding its underlying meaning.
B000002UAU|5.0|...but I may not succeed!<br />I'll start by trying to give my own personal experience about how the LP affected me when it came out that summer of '67 - - the much ballyhooed \\"Summer of Love\\"...<br />My family had just moved from Guadalajara to LA that spring, and I, who already spoke fluent English and was a big fan of US and UK pop music of the time (as would any 14-year-old girl), was trying fervently to find my bearings in my new surroundings.  It certainly helped that my new classmates and I shared an affinity and love for the Beatles.  We could even discourse how their music was really starting to \\"matter\\", what with the progression of sounds they had recently offered up: the much-overlooked \\"Help!\\", and of course the highly regarded \\"Rubber Soul\\" and \\"Revolver\\" albums that had already come.<br />But nothing could have prepared us for what was in store that summer, not even the single release that spring of \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" (though, in retrospect, that surely was a hint). Sergeant Pepper certainly taught the band to play, all right, and 35 years later, he still holds sway.  Rock Music was never the same after this watershed event, but not just rock.  I dare say that \\"Soul\\" (as it was called at the time), \\"Adult\\" (or Easy Listening), and even \\"Country\\" were profoundly influenced by the ideas offered up here.<br />Let's take the fact that, at the time, no single was released from this album, yet it was number one all over the world for months -- a fact that belied the marketing mentality of the time, that \\"kids\\" wouldn't buy an album unless it contained several \\"hits.\\" But even more, the boundaries crossed here - lyrically, musically - made it possible for so many others to do similar things.  There are overt appeals to consciousness-raising: George's \\"Within you, without you\\" (still in many ways the finest song he ever wrote, with haunting lyrics and instrumentation), John's \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" (such an obvious pro-drug message which fitso well with the times - and why shouldn't adults be free to experiment?), and of course, the tour-de-force \\"Day in the Life\\" (with its endless piano chord at the end, seemingly ascending straight to heaven), but these never seem preachy or dated.<br />Paul McCartney's exquisite lyrical gifts, which could often turn maudlin (as \\"She's Leaving Home\\" almost does - but the song is saved by the context it is placed in), are in rare form on gems such as \\"Getting Better\\" and \\"Fixing a Hole\\", while \\"Lovely Rita\\" is a lyric few others could even hope to carry off without sounding silly.  My focus on the lyrics also does not take away from the fact that all three of these songs are beautifully arranged, and remain bona-fide rock classics. Even Ringo shines on \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\" -- such a wonderful song melodically, harmonically, and lyrically: \\"What do you see when you turn out the light? I can't tell you, but I know it's mine...\\"  <br />The fact that I've not seen fit to mention the other tracks, \\"Mr Kite\\", \\"Good Morning\\", \\"When I'm 64\\", or the title track(s), does not mean I think they are lesser by any means.  Rhythmically, they all shine as well, especially Lennon's \\"Good Morning.\\"<br />I seriously doubt this album could be improved upon, at least not content-wise.  The sound may not be along the lines of what we've come to expect in 2002, but keep in mind it was all done on a \\"primitive\\" 8-track machine.  The artistry is hardly dimmed by these limitations, much as the same can be said for, say, Louis Armstrong's recordings of the 1920's and 30's. <br />Yet I can relate, in a way, to the inability of younger people to see this milestone of popular music in its proper context.  How can something from way back in 1967 have any relevance to today (yet it is hard to imagine acts such as N-Sync or Back Street Boys existing in their current form had the Beatles never blazed the paths they did), any more than Beethoven, Mozart, or even Duke Ellington would?It takes the rare young person who is willing to listen with an open mind, and also be willing to understand the historical context within which Sergeant Pepper must be placed.  If it is your son or daughter whom you want to introduce to your love of the Beatles, try this:  get a hold of some other big hits from the period (Lou Christie's \\"Lightning Strikes\\", The Buckinghams' \\"Kind of a Drag\\", Tommy James' \\"Hanky Panky\\", or even the biggest hit of the era, The Monkees' \\"I'm a Believer\\") and play them for your offspring.  Then contrast those with this album.  I think the message will come across loud and clear...
B000002AVF|5.0|&quot;Open Arms&quot; should be put another CD, along with her Endless Love duet, All I Ever Wanted, Music Box, All In Your Mind, etc. It should be counted among her greatest. &quot;When I Saw You&quot; is also quite well done. Far, Far, above some of her horrible ones. It is one her most beautiful EVER. Maybe Columbia should put out something like &quot;Mariah's Most Beautiful Love Songs&quot;.
B0000541VS|4.0|I don't know how to feel about this movie. I was reluctant to watch it at first because I had heard about some of the controversial things that happened in the movie. When I finally saw it for myself, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Even though there is friction about whether the horrfic things in this movie took place or not I still found it disturbing. I liked it don't get me wrong, but the movie doesn't really pick up until the four boys get shipped off to reform school. After they got there is when the nightmare really begins. I was totally disgusted when I saw how harshly Kevin Bacon was acting(I didn't know he had it in him). I felt so sad for the boys that I couldn't help but cry. After that, I got mad because I just didn't understand how or why people can be that cruel to children that they are suppose to be guarding and protecting. I could'nt believe they actually beat Rizzo to death (even though they didn't show the actual beating). That's the reason I loved it so much when Kevin Bacon got what he deserved. My heart raced through this whole movie. I just couldn't believe how Kevin Bacon just enjoyed and relished in the power he had over those young boys (not to leave out the rest of his ... pals as well). I guess Nokes (Bacon) just stood out the most to me because he was just plain sick. I must say that if this story was in fact true that the whole entire cast made me feel the pain of the people this sadistic trauma really happened to.
B00005OAIE|5.0|That being said, after hearing my brother say that the CD was selling big in his store, I picked up a copy. I listened to it, then picked up a Dave Matthews Band CD and listened to it. Then saw John Mayer in concert two weeks later and HE'S DAMN GOOD.<br />I don't see grounds for comparison. I'm sorry but I don't. Dave Matthews is an established artist. John Mayer is newer and has a sound on his own and it's great! I like it a lot. The sound is sometimes mellow, then upbeat. If anything the only song that can get on my nerves easily is My Stupid Mouth. But I LOVE the songs &quot;No Such Thing&quot; and &quot;Saint Patrick's Day&quot; with &quot;Neon&quot;, &quot;3x5&quot;, &quot;83&quot; and &quot;City Love&quot; running closely behind.<br />As for those who are reading the reviews and having a hard time deciding, grab a couple of his songs off of the net and judge for yourself. And try listening to him as John Mayer AN ARTIST and not John Mayer, some guy who's trying to bite off of Dave Matthews cuz sorry, you're wrong.
B00005V1Z5|2.0|I don't see what all of the rave reviews are about. 2 Stars is really being too kind. This movie was not funny at all. All else aside, I can't stand Ben Stiller.  He is not funny period. I don't know what I was thinking when I watched this movie because it was a total waste of time.
B00005N5S5|5.0|Almost eighteen years after its original release, &quot;The Terminator&quot; still remains one of the best science fiction movies ever made.<br />The 1984 sleeper hit that catapulted both Arnold Schwarzenegger's and director James Cameron's career to stardom revolves around a young woman who - unbeknownst to her - will play a stellar role in the survival of humanity.<br />The brilliance of the story lies with the fact that the horrid science fiction of a devastated 21st century world comes to the familiar nighttime streets of 1984 Los Angeles. <br />Arnold Schwarzenegger steals the show as the relentless seemingly unstoppable cyborg who will stop at nothing to accomplish his mission of killing Sarah Connor. Years from now, Sarah will give birth to a son who is to lead the decimated human race to victory in their future war against the machines. <br />A fascinating storyline, superb acting from all three main characters, brilliant special effects and spectacular chases through the dark moody nights of a seemingly hostile Los Angeles make for an absolute classic in its kind and a movie that no science fiction fan should pass up!
B000002J1H|4.0|The best song on this cd is definitely Turn of the century..excellent sound on the guitar. Awaken is a 15 minutes epic and takes a few listens to get used to but is really good. Going for the one fits well into the AOR radio thing back then(70's) as does wonderous stories. It's not a great cd but very good in parts.
B000002U82|5.0|ok, lets get down to the straight truth here - this is the best pink floyd album ever.  well, it is in my opinion at least.  i am a musician - i play guitar and i taught myself how to play this entire album (that is except for &quot;on the run&quot; which has no guitar) because of its beauty and subsequence.  it's a really groovy album, especially if you're new to pink floyd.  i was new to them once and gave &quot;dark side of the moon&quot; a listen - and it blew my birkenstocks off! since then i've become a real floyd-head! but anyways, dont waste your time reading all these reviews - trust me, this album was spawned from the dark side of the moon!
B000001ESF|4.0|The first part of this is a concept album the 2112 Epic. My favorite part of 2112 Epic is the opening instumental and the temple of syrinx. Outside of wrking man it is Rush's heaviest song. The vocal are a little rough at times, but it is a good song. The second side is just straight foward rock with the exception of Tears. My favorite's of this side are A passage to bagkok and something for nothing.
B000006TRV|4.0|i agree that &quot;the wall&quot; is a wonderful album - but yet, it is not my favorite. like that other guy said, it's hard to make a decision between this and &quot;dark side of the moon.&quot;  but, in the end i choose &quot;dark side.&quot;  no offense, but &quot;the wall&quot; is mainly the work of roger waters.  yes, he did drive the band to stardom and all that great stuff but you have to remember, roger waters is not pink floyd! so, you be the judge.  but let me remind you, there is some really terrific music on this album.  i would say it is definitely worth the money it is sold at.  so, go buy it.  (p.s. read my other floyd reviews!)
B00005JKLZ|5.0|I brought thi DVD Yesturday and I watched it twice in the same night just to get everything stright!,,<BR>       The DVD is supreb!<BR>     Creating the moorlocks and time machine are good and informitive<BR>        Deleted scene-  its 1 scence but its about 5 min to!...<BR>                <BR>   ...         Alough the movie dissapointingly does not leave a door open for a sequal but it i very advaced in technoigy.<BR>      It is my opion that this is something you can own!.
B000002U8G|4.0|i think &quot;meddle&quot; is a great album.  like many of the other floyd albums, it doesn't have many tracks on it but what it does have is power! it's not quite critically acclaimed as some of the other floyd works (i.e. dark side, wish you were here, &amp; the wall) but then again, it is also the first floyd album to break into the top 50 billboard charts in the U.S. (hehe, i'm reading &quot;saucerful of secrets&quot; right now - it's awesome).  it's got some great works in it - especially &quot;one of these days&quot; (what a great opener) which includes nick mason's ONLY appearance on lead vocals ever on a floyd album.  the rest are very good works as well, except for seamus (damn that howling dog - i guess the fans didnt find it as funny as the floyd did!) but anyways, i would recommend it even to the veteran floyd fan.
B00005JKWJ|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and I've already pre-ordered my DVD.  Take everything you liked in Blade and double it, this is Blade II.  The special effects are awesome, especially the end fight scene which will leave you smiling.  Everything about this movie spells &quot;winner&quot; as a sequal.  You won't be disappointed if you're a Blade fan.  Of course, of you're a real Blade fan you would have already seen this movie at the theater. ;o)  Get it now!
B000024D4R|4.0|this is a great pink floyd album, especially considering the fact that it is done by the four floyds themselves with no help from session musicians.  &quot;animals&quot; is artistic in its own right - inspired by george orwell's &quot;animal farm.&quot;  i love how it categorizes the human race into 3 different animals - totally genius! and if you're a real hard rocker (which i might add, i'm not) you should really enjoy this.  it's got some great jamming in it and i'd say is a pretty damn good follow up to &quot;wish you were here.&quot;  read my other floyd reviews as well!
038533558X|5.0|Finally, a writer who knows how to end a novel!
B000069HJL|5.0|Supertramp's double live album from 1980, &quot;Paris,&quot; is a wonderful live set, capturing the band at the peak of their popularity while they were on tour for their 1979 smash hit album, &quot;Breakfast In America,&quot; at a time when co-leader Roger Hodgson was still with the group. When you consider that the possibility of Hodgson returning to Supertramp these days is highly unlikely, &quot;Paris&quot; becomes all the more an important live document of the band, indeed. Many great Tramp classics are included in this live set, such as &quot;School,&quot; &quot;Ain't Nobody But Me,&quot; &quot;The Logical Song,&quot; &quot;Dreamer,&quot; &quot;Rudy,&quot; &quot;Take The Long Way Home,&quot; &quot;Fool's Overture,&quot; and &quot;Crime Of The Century,&quot; plus one exclusive song, &quot;You Started Laughing,&quot; not found anywhere else. Hodgson &amp; co-leader Rick Davies sing their hearts out and play their respective keyboards with great passion, and Hodgson also serves up some incredible fretwork on the guitar. Co-horts John Halliwell on sax, drummer Bob Sibenberg &amp; bassist Dougie Thomson have terrific interplay with Hodgson &amp; Davies, helping to bring the band's great melodic music to life in tremendous fashion. Just like on their studio albums, the band totally cook live in concert, too. And the album's remastering treatment here is quite a blessing, giving a clarity to this live recording that wasn't heard before. It's almost like being at the concert itself, sitting alongside all of those lucky French Supertramp fans.&quot;Paris&quot; is a fabulous Supertramp concert that you'll want to experience again &amp; again. If you weren't lucky enough to see the band on their most successful tour ever, then listening to this album is definitely the next best thing. Supertramp live in Paris...ooh la la! :-)
B000068IEU|1.0|After reading all the hype, I felt incredibly let down. Perhaps living in the early 21st century with terrorists who kill thousands with their cowardly attacks on civilians buildings has blunted my sensitivities and hundred of hours of watching various zombies, euro-demons and power tool wielding revenants has dulled my sense, but I found this movie to be somewhat tame. Sure, the vile murders in this film were the kind of evil that deserves to be eradicated and we occassionally wandered into cruelty and depravity, the whole undertone of the film kept being neutered by a comic relief sheriff duo.<br />I'm sure that this was really disturbing back in the 70's, but I felt the movie hasn't aged well. It is definitely worth watching as historical reference, but I can't say that it was really even disturbing. If this caused folk to flee the theaters throwing-up, I wonder what Hellrazor or Evil Dead would have done if we could have shown it to those audiences.
B00006GO9Q|5.0|Miles achieves somewhat of an ambient feel on this album, with lengthy tracks that stay in a similar musical space throughout (except of course for the brief statement of the title tune that opens and closes the second track).  However, within the mood that is set there is still a lot going on that is characteristic of a jazz performance, with memorable solo statements by Miles, Wayne Shorter, and others over a backdrop that is responsive to their ideas.  It's somewhat of a best-of-both-worlds approach.  Furthermore, as with most of Miles' music throughout his career, the music is truly timeless...the passage of decades hasn't diminished the initial groundbreaking impact of Davis' music.<br />As others have mentioned, the sound quality is significantly upgraded.  If you can afford it, I'd actually opt for the IN A SILENT WAY boxed set (which not only puts these tracks in their larger context, but has the original unaltered takes that were cut-and-pasted to form this album).  However, if you just want the key moments in Miles' career, then this CD is recommended!
B00000IOSU|5.0|The advantages of this collection are several: accessibility, song selection and recording quality.  Admittedly, almost the entire album pulls from her last two studio albums, with the beautifully sung and harmonized \\"Path of Thorns\\" as exception to the rule, so you can't call this the deepest collection of Sarah ever released.  With that said, both of those albums are classics and enormous steps forward for her as a musician, overshadowing almost everything she did previously.<br />Her most immediately likable songs are all featured here, in some cases sounding better than they do on the original, although not too much divergence from the original arrangements is heard (\\"Possession,\\" \\"Fear\\" being moderate exceptions).  For live performances where vocals usually suffer from singers not being able to hear themselves well enough, Sarah sounds good, especially working in harmony with her accompanying vocalists.  The band itself has never sounded better, benefiting from Ash Sood's extremely tight time and a new and hopefully permanent lead guitarist.<br />If you don't know whether you like her or not, buy it.  If you already liked some of her radio singles but aren't sure whether you want to invest in any of her albums, buy this and then go back to \\"Surfacing\\" and \\"Fumbling Towards Ecstasy.\\"  The tempos tend to be ten to twenty beats faster than originally recorded, and the entire band sounds like it's having fun.
B000068TPN|2.0|If you are thinking this movie is original forget about it.  I'll admit that the movie is very entertaining but the movie borrows liberally from just about every war movie ever made, and what's stranger is that it is a true story.  There are many scenes in this that will have you rolling your eyes at how corny it is.  We have one soldier who is dying who says the classic \\"tell my wife, I love her.\\"  What about predictability?  A guy says that his wife is having a baby and what happens?  He gets killed.  A woman receives a telegram from Western Union about her husband dying and what does she do?  She says the classic \\"No, no, its not true, your lying, no, no!\\"  Think about all those old war movies from 30 years ago and you pretty much have this movie.  Another complaint is about the violence.  The violence doesn't bother me, but the way it is handled does.  How many more times in movies are we going to have the scene where your talking to a guy one minute and then all of a sudden a bullet smacks him in the head?  The violence is almost comical, the people who made it want to you to think \\"how did they get that guys skin to fall off?\\"  Please, don't listen to the people who give this five stars, this movie will conjure up thoughts of certain story elements from \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and every movie about war in the past 50 years.

B000069AUI|5.0|I absolutely love this cd.  If you like the songs &quot;In My Place&quot; and &quot;Trouble&quot; from Parachutes, then you should like this cd.  This cd has one of the most beautiful songs recorded - &quot;The Scientist.&quot;  The lyrics and arrangements in this song are just amazing. I like piano and strings in music and love how Coldplay uses them in their songs.  Plus, Chris Martin has a great voice.  They also rock out more on this cd which is another plus.  Too many bands from England are making music that puts you to sleep.  This will definitely keep you awake.
B000069AUI|5.0|'A Rush of Blood to the Head' is a bonafide great album. It deserves to be included among the best of the year, in the same breath as Bruce Springsteen's 'The Rising,' and the jaw dropping Doves release 'The Last Broadcast.'<br />Their Grammy award winning debut 'Parachutes' delivered a lot of anticipation for a sophomore release. It too was a strong, gorgeous set. Coldplay's new release easily meets and exceeds expectations. In a day when rock albums have become collections of tired riffs and recycled melodies ready for FM radio consumption, Coldplay has developed a melancholy, yet shimmering and warm set blending consistency and vitality.<br />Attempting to address highlights on this album is simply lipservice. However, 'In My Place,' 'The Scientist,' and 'Warning Sign' are ideal check points throughout this album.<br />Altogether, plaintive piano chords meld with pensive guitar licks and Chris Martin's heavenly falsetto. Curious? You should be! This is one of the 'must own' albums of 2002!
B00004Y6OA|5.0|Originally released in 1980, Van Halen's third album, Women and Children First, continued on the winning streak begun with Van Halen I and continued on Van Halen II. WACF is the first album of theirs that cdan truly be considered 'experimental', incorporating acoustics to a greater extent, and also began Eddie's keyboard experimentation. The material on this record is consistently good, save for the annoying vocals on \\"Loss on Control\\", I really have no idea what Dave is saying there. The standouts would be the album's lone hit \\"And the Cradle Will Rock...\\" as well as the closer. the sublimely beautiful \\"In a Simple Rhyme\\". However, I would recomment you buy this fifth amoing Van Ha;en albums, after I, II, 1984, and Fair Warning...the material the band put out was just so good that an album such as this is their fifth best.

B00005R62K|5.0|After three records of rock experiments, Judas Priest found their sound with Stained Class. The music was considerably heavier than on previous albums, and was very heavy by the standards of 1978. The drumming, which had been a perennial weak point for the band, was improved tremendously with the addition of the talented Les Binks, who even cowrote Beyond the Realms of Death, arguably the record's best song. The weakest track here would be Savage, but not because there's anytihng wrong with it, it just fails to stand out in this collection of standouts. This is a truly great record and if you are a metal fan this is an essential...buy it as soon as you can.
B00005R87Q|1.0|I recommend you buy any movie but this. Don't waste any time buying, waiting for it to come in the mail, and watching this crappy movie.  This is a disgrace to movies.  I heard this movie was good, then i watched it.  It seems this movies plot was made by a crazy monkey who writes with his poop on walls.  Do not waste your good 20 bucks on this movie I beg of you DO NOT BUY THIS DISGRACE TO ALL THINGS CALLED \\"MOVIES\\"!!
B00003CXAT|5.0|Jurassic Park is a wonderful movie.  For it's time, the special effects are revolutionary.  Steven Spielberg's masterpiece is back, better than ever in this collectors edition filled interviews and behind the scenes documentary.  The story of this film is about Paleontologist Alan Grant(Sam NEil) and his partner Ellen(Laura Derf) are on a dig site when a helicopter lands in he digsite.  When they go into their trailer an old man is there(Richard Attenborough0 who says that he is opening up a park and he wants those two to endorse in his \\"projec''.  When they get to the island where the park is, they go on a cart to the park, and they see a...dinosaur.  <br />  This DVD is filled with 60 minutes of special features that include, direct hotlink to the Set of \\"Jurassic Par'', The making of Jurassic park, Early Pre Production meetings, Story Boards, Production Photographs, Design Sketches and Conceptional paintings, Phil Tippet animatics: Raptors in the Kitchen, Theatrical trailors: Jurassic Park, The Lost world: Jurassic Park, and Jurassic Park 3,Dinosaur encyclopedia, Production notes, Cast and Filmaker bios, DVD rom features including Live Web evnts.<br />  Jurassic Park remains one of my favorite movies of al time and it is a classic.  Grade A+!!!!!!!!!!!<br />  ~~~~~Dan~~~~
B000069AUI|5.0|I hope that Coldplay gets the recognition they deserve, because their new album is amazing. The combination of Chris Martin's voice with his haunting piano melodies makes this record refreshing compared to the boring &quot;hard rock&quot; bands you hear on the radio.<br />A classic...
B00003CXB6|5.0|The Lost World is a very interesting film.  It s loosely based on Michael Crichton's novel of the same name.  Mathmetician Ian Malcolm(Jeff Goldblum) gets a phone call from owner of Ingen genetics corporation John Hammond(Richard Attenborough) to come to his mansion.  When Malcolm gets to the mansion his grandchildren Lex and Tim(although in this film they only make one appearence) meet them at the mansion.  They have no idea why there grandpa called Ian.  When he meets John said that there was another island that has dinosaurs on it.  The place where the dinos were created...

0385503954|4.0|I would imagaine that the detail and history which inhabits Atonement may perhaps be a little unfamiliar to some american readers, but then again it is a world often visited by literature.<BR>The first part of the novel set in the english country house, portarys a vision of pre-war england which has been presented many times before, McEwan has put a little spin on this, but subtely.<BR>The second book dealing with the evacuation from Dunkirk was excellent, and the strongest segement, leading nicely into the penultimate moving back to england.<BR>The last part McEwan puts on his clever novelist hat again, and adds a quick sting in the tail.<BR>very much a playing with novels within a a novel and storytelling about stories, ultimately could have been more satisfying, but still an enjoyable book.
B00005JL3A|4.0|An enjoyable piece of horror-b-style film. Fantastic scenes and a nearly beautiful rendition of the video game. Although it may lack nearly many of the things that make the game, those who played this on playstation will take note of the more important things: kicking zombie ..., the unoriginal storyline, and the sure stopping end scene of what's to come. I personally loved it and not ashamed to admit it fits in the classic slots of films to see during a halloween fest. So invite your friends and get ready for some good old fashioned ... kicking-gun toting action.
0812548094|3.0|Ok, maybe my rating of 3 stars is a little harsh, it would be 3.6 if I could do that, but I tend to round down.<br />Don't get me wrong, this book was good.  It has all the great elements of the last book, but there were two fatal flaws in it.<br />1.  The story is VERY loose.  Not much that really matters happens at all.  It could've been half the size that it is, and I almost felt like I was wasting my time when I know that Richard won't be much further along when I stop reading.<br />2.  The way the dilemma was solved was craaaapy.  It must've been a total of 5 pages or so.  I felt cheated.  I felt like &quot;I read all this for a 5 page ending?&quot;.  I was expecting something better.  Not only that, it didn't seem very hard to do what he did.<br />To me, this book seemed more like a &quot;character development&quot; novel.  The characters become more in-depth and then there are new ones.<br />I really REALLY disliked that Goodkind got rid of Chase.  He was my favorite character from Wizard's First Rule (don't worry about me giving that away it happens early in the book).  I'm currently reading Temple of the Winds and Chase still isn't back, so I think he is gone, never to appear in the series again.<br />Not all is lost though.  After I finish this review I'm going to go and review Blood of the Fold, which was actually pretty good.  I'm giving it 4 stars.  And Temple of the Winds is, by far, the best book in the series (even better than First Rule!  I'm only like 1/3 into it though).<br />Read this book, but don't just give up on the series because the other ones are good.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Having a young child, we were waiting for this movie to come out on cable or dvd -- no chance of going to a theater yet! So we were delighted to receive an advance copy from an online store and Disney/PIXAR. We've watched the film at least six times in the past four days.<br /><br />The movie is terrific -- one of those films that children of different ages can enjoy AND adults can watch multiple times without going insane. This is the story of Monsters Incorporated, an energy supply company based in Monstropolis. In this reality, energy comes in the form of children's screams, and to that end Monsters, Inc. employees emerge from closets all over the world in order to collect a few GigaHowls and keep everyone's lamps and toasters running. The best scare team at Monsters, Inc.  is John &#34;Sulley&#34; Sullivan (John Goodman) and his assistant Mike (Billy Crystal).<br /><br />One evening after hours, a child gets through a closet door and enters Monstropolis. Not good, considering monsters are scared of kids and believe their touch is toxic. Over the course of the movie Sulley and even Mike become attached to &#34;Boo&#34;, risking health and careers to get her back to her home.  In the meantime, incorrigible adorable Boo is having a great time scaring all the big monsters.<br /><br />The film is incredibly well done, as technically flawless as earlier PIXAR productions, the Toy Story series and A Bug's Life, but even funnier.  John Goodman perfectly voices gentle, affable Sulley, and Billy Crystal creates Mike, a frantic egotist who is also optimistic and loyal.  In other words, with more depth than half the human characters being written today. The animation is stunning, and the story is lots of fun.  Nothing here to disturb little kids, and a lot to entertain them. The only part I didn't like much was the opening credit sequence, which was reminiscent of 60s bedroom farces, but that's what the Select Scene feature is for.<br /><br />There are two discs here. On Disc One you can view the film in fullscreen or widescreen format.  Audio commentary by the director and staff is available with the latter. English captions, audio and video optimizers, and sneak peeks at PIXAR's upcoming &#34;Finding Nemo&#34; and Disney's &#34;Lilo & Stitch&#34; are also here. Disc Two contains almost three-and-a-half hours of amazing dvd extras. There's an interesting 20-minute tour of PIXAR; a very funny bloopers reel (that also plays during the credits of the fullscreen version); storyboards; deleted scenes; recording studio footage; character design; trailers and tv spots; footage of the Hollywood premiere; discussion of tie-in toys; a poster gallery; two Monsters Inc.-related segments from Ponkickies, a goofy Japanese animated show; Peek-a-Boo, a game; a history of Monster World; a Monsters Inc. employee handbook; and an introduction to Monsters Inc.'s version of baseball cards called Scarer Cards. The 13-minute original treatment and several scenes from an alternative story are presented that are as funny as the one that made it to the screen.<br /><br />Our favorite extras were the outtakes; a new animated short, &#34;Mike's Car&#34;; the Oscar winning PIXAR short, &#34;For the Birds&#34;; fly-arounds of several movie locations; the guide to &#34;in&#34; jokes (eg, the appearance of Toy Story 2's Jessie when Boo is showing her favorite toys to Sulley); a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at the technical wizardry required to produce complex backgrounds, Sulley's fur, Boo's shirt and the city of Monstropolis; being able to watch a scene as it was done in storyboard, layout, animation or finished presentation; and a fun 4-minute clip with a few seconds of dialogue in each of the 30+ languages into which the film was translated. There's even a brief appearance by PIXAR CEO Steve Jobs.<br /><br />Packaging and foldout are nice, and include a contest entry form (to win Disney dvds), a free tie-in storybook offer, and a coupon book (for popcorn;Monsters Inc. tie-ins; Disney storybooks, videos and dvds; and Disney on Ice). With one exception we ran everything on our dvd player without a glitch, and could not be more pleased with this very funny family film and the many many extra features.<br /><br />Highest recommendation.and Disney on Ice).

B000068R88|5.0|This CD is the best one I have heard in a long time!! She is such a great singer and I love that she isn't like Britney spears!! I can really relate with her songs. I wish there were more singers out there like Avril Lavigne!!! You gotta get this CD!!!
6305078181|4.0|The sreen is black.  A wolf howls.  The main credits start to appear with the images created by Maurice Binder (of James Bond fame).  John Williams' majestic main theme sounds triumphantly.  From that moment, I realized -and I still do -that I'm watching a movie version of \\"Dracula\\" that would be classically romantic and terrifying at the same time.<br />Frankly, I may never understand why people are so critical about this version.  I mean, you have Frank Langella portraying a character that won him the Tony Award in Broadway, and he gives total charm to the bloodsucking count.  There is Laurence Olivier, who plays a Van Helsing that appears to be giving poetic justice.  I mean all the cast give a touch of class to this vision of Dracula.  And then there is John Williams' majestic music score, giving a chilling romanticism that's very strange in horror films.<br />Many people may think John Badham's direction has been sloppy, and the dialogue from W.D. Richter may be weak, but I don't care: I simply love this movie version, one of my great guilty pleasures.
B00003CXI1|4.0|The movie is a good adaptation of the book.  It captures the story and the spirit well.  However, even at over 2 and a half hours long the movie can't capture the intricacies of the original (book) storyline.  While the book is a children's story (according to everyone but Rowling) that is written well enough to keep the average adult reading, the movie has had to be simplified too much.  It ends up being just a kids' movie.  It's a pretty good kids' movie but it doesn't live up to the hype ... or the book
B00004Z459|5.0|Hybrid Theory is one of those CD's you never get sick of, no matter how many times you listen to it. Its one of the only CD's in my collection where I like every song on the whole thing. Here's a breakdown of the songs.<BR>1. Papercut: This is the first Linkin Park song I ever heard and it is the one that really set me of on Linkin Park. Cool song about going insane or something with one rap part and one rock/melodic part. 10/10.<BR>2. One Step Closer: This song is overrated. Its too angry (Shut up I'm not talking to you!!). Its about wanting to be left alone and being pushged to the edge (I need a little room to breath/cuz I'm one step closer to the edge...and i'm about to BREAK). Least favorite, 5/10.<BR>3. With You: One of the best. Really personal sounding with a good tune and strong lyrics. About an argument or something, kinda hard to make out the meaning. 10/10.<BR>4. Points of Authority: An okay song, my second least favorite. Its got a kinda cool guitar part. I think it is about control. Powerful. 6/10.<BR>5. Crawling: Very overrated. Kind of a weak song. I don't listen to it much so I don't really know what its about. You've probably heard it along with In the End. 6/10.<BR>6. Runaway: Good song, strong lyrics. Proves that Linkin PArk can sound melodic too. 7/10.<BR>7. By Myself: Real powerful song. From a semi-melodic voice to a scream, but still good. One of favorite. 9/10.<BR>8. In The End: A good song, but once again, overrated. Good rap/melodic combo. About memories and a lost time or something. Good change of style in last verse. 8/10.<BR>9. Place for my Head: Awesome song! I love the mexican guitar thing in the begining and how it blends into the rock/rap part. About someone taking advantage of the guy, i think. Not sure, but who cares??? 10/10.<BR>10. Forgotten: This is a really good song. Alittle happier than the rest. Rap style and melodic combined. Don't undertand what its about. 9/10.<BR>11.Cure for the Itch: Basically DJ Hahn chucking some mixed up rythms at you. Good change of style, great DJing. 7/10.<BR>12. Pushing Me Away: Good way to end the CD. Melodic and rappy at the same time. Strong lyrics and powerful song. 10/10.<br />BOTTOM LINE: No reason not to buy this CD. Each song has a unique intro so you don't hear the same thing twice. Ever. One of the best CD's I own. And I have never gotten sick of this CD, even though I listened to it a million times. Get it.<BR>D
B000068TPN|5.0|It is a known fact that Don King runs the Oscars and so this movie will be passed over for best picture nominations.  However, I believe in time it will be considered one of the great Vietnam movies.<BR>  Mel Gibson is phenomenal.  He never disappears in a character like Marlon Brando can, but somehow the characters he plays fit him perfectly.  Sam Elliot is also very good in this movie and reminded me of some of my staff non-commisioned officers in the Corps.<BR>  One of the reasons that Hollywood and the press have and will continue to trivialize this movie is that it depicts triumphant American fighting men in a war that both of those institutions have made a career of painting as evil, embarassing and lost. Blackhawk Down recieved a similiar treatment. <BR>  It is refreshing to see such a recent spate of movies that show the American fighting man in such a positive light.  Once again Mel Gibon proves that he does not make bad movies.  Look for him to become the Charlton Heston of this movie era.
B00000IN5G|4.0|Children Of Bodom is different to other grindcore/death metal bands. The music is much more tunefull. There are two tunes. A heavy noise and a great tune. The voice is awful but the music makes up for it. I have given it 4 stars because even though the music is good. It doesn't go very well with the carcass style vocals. On the whole I think it is the most tunefull grindcore band ever.

B00005JKDR|5.0|If your kids (or you) have ever been worried about what lurks behind that closet door, this is the film you've been waiting for!  Not only do you get to see a delightful conceptualization of the monster world, but you get to see how good things can be when you face the things that scare you.  Lovable fuzzy monster James P. Sullivan (aka \\"Sully\\") and his eyeball shaped side-kick, Mike Wazowski, are best friends who also to work together as partners at Monsters, Incorporated.  Their jobs consist of scaring children around the world, popping out through closet doors and doing their very best to get those boys and girls to scream -- because those screams keep the electrical power running in the monster world.  Mike handles the controls as closet doors drop down into special door holder portals, keeping an eye (literally!) on Sully as he leaps through doorways into the human world.<br />Sully is the top-scarer at Monsters, Inc., who garners praise from the boss and is often requested to demonstrate his scaring techniques to scaring trainees.  While other monsters might just look scary, Sully has mastered the art of leaping out and roaring to full effect.  Sully's career success incites Randall, another top-scarer at Monsters, Inc, to engage in plotting ways to surpass him.<br />Sully's world turns upside-down when an adorable little girl follows Sully  back into the monster world... panicking the Monster metropolis (who routinely \\"decontaminate\\" anything human which finds its way into the monster world).  Sully befriends the little girl, names her \\"Boo\\", and helps her find a way to get back home without being captured by the overly zealous human-decontamination teams.  Many surprising twists, turns, and sub-plots lead to a particularly satisfying conclusion.  This is one movie you won't easily second-guess, and the action scenes are spectacular!  The special effects are excellent and add a lot to the thrilling story... but what gives this film it's soul is the outstanding vocal talent of it's entire human cast (which includes John Goodman and Billy Crystal).<br />Besides getting an awesome DVD movie, this 2-DVD set includes some wonderful extras that are truly worth the money.  There is a very funny Academy award-winning short called, \\"For the Birds\\", a hilarious animated short made just for this DVD release called, \\"Mike's New Car\\", a special feature on the making of the original Randy Newman song \\"If I Didn't Have You\\", some very funny story board monsters, a wonderful game, a feature that shows how this story was originally written... and much, much more.  I have never seen a better special effects disc than this.nding vocal talent of it's entire human cast (which includes John Goodman and Billy Crystal).<br />Besides getting an awesome DVD movie, this 2-DVD set includes some wonderful extras that are truly worth the money.

B00006690G|5.0|Eminem proved why he is one of the best rappers in the game with <BR>this album. The Eminem Show is a awesome album and deserves 5 stars with songs like Cleaning Out My Closet, Hallie's Song, Without Me, and Sayin' Good By To Hollywood. Eminem shows that his lyrical skills top most rappers today. Finally the great part of this album is that Eminem is serious and focused, Eminem is no longer talking about boy bands and Britney Spears he is getting down to some serious business.
B000056HRZ|4.0|I first saw this movie over a year ago. I was at a friend's house, and she had some friends over. I got partway through, then she asked me to join her party. I served as a non-participating bystander until they all drank themselves to sleep around 1.30 or 2 in the morning - then I finished the movie. Despite the interruption, I thought it was a wonderful film.<br />The second time and the third time and every time since, I see it and think, &quot;This is so fine. I don't think I ever understood it before.&quot; Because there are so many characters and they all have their complex personalities and situations.<br />Ingrid Bergman is beautiful as always and wears some pretty interesting outfits. Look for the one with the appliqu&eacute;d hearts. At least they look appliqu&eacute;d. Humphrey Bogart bends away slightly from his &quot;tough guy&quot; personality and smiles in a few of the flashback scenes. Paul Henreid doesn't have a very big part, unfortunately, but he makes the most of what he is given. But in my opinion, it is really Claude Rains that steals the show here. He has all the good lines; he cuts a snappy figure in the French uniform; and he lends a charming humour to each scene he is in. Of course he is a womaniser (that just dawned on me the last time I saw it - yeah, I know, wake up), but... Anyway.<br />The music is also very good, and to use my mother's words, the &quot;groovy globe&quot; at the beginning is - well - pretty groovy.<br />Well, anyway, what I have to say, it's nothing new - I like this movie and I think it's one of the best Hollywood ever turned out. See it and enjoy Ingrid, Humphrey, Paul, and Claude.

B00005JKJA|5.0|I've no desire to repeat what others have written here in the 5 star category - all I can say is the power of the film is in the way it alters consciousness at the threshold of self-awareness...  I saw the film two nights ago and now my falling asleep, my half-awake stumblings to the bathroom at 3 am, waking in the gray...all invaded by Lynch's tragedy of self-destruction -- took my mind through an astonished vortex of shattered dreams and self-corruption.  Read the other highly rated 5-star reviews for the details I won't bother to repeat.  Naomi Watts completely blew me away.  Watch it and it weep.
B00005UKKF|1.0|I bought this DVD after hearing the top hits from Britney. I think the songs rock. But that's about all. I was ulterly disappointed with the performance from Britney. Let's face it, Britney cant dance. There is *no* rhythm in her steps and all her movement could be described with just one word - rookie. I'm not a dancer, nor a talented star. But I sure can tell you that Britney was simply too clumsy in all her moves. I dont know who was her choreographer, but I do suggest that they see how other top stars perform, like MJ. I watched this on a Saturday afternoon, and for the record, I fast forward 30% of this DVD adn still fell asleep towards the end!! If you're drawn towards britney's songs, I suggest you to stay as it is. Dont look at how she dance nor any of her performance in this DVD. I dont know about the rest of her other DVD, but this DVD of mine is gonna be out in ebay today.
078322608X|5.0|This new genre of &quot;twisted reality&quot; movies includes 12 Monkeys. I watched this movie for a second time when I bought the DVD, as I also have the Laser Disc. Upon second viewing, I was shocked at how much I had missed getting caught up in the plot twists and action. I read the reviews, and feel this important aspect of the movie has not been mentioned. The movie drops a lot of enigmatic hints, a la the Sixth Sense and A Beautiful Mind, as to what is real and not real. You really have to watch for them. For example: some of the things he remembers seeing in the &quot;future&quot;, he sees again when he goes back into the past, to places where he's never been. How are &quot;memories&quot; from the FUTURE possible? Especially when Bruce says he's never been above ground before! How can one have &quot;deja vu&quot; after travelling to the past? Even Bruce has a confused look on his face whenever one of these clues to his mental state are realized. Also the bit the previous reviewer mentioned about the lady scientist on the plane. Which did he see first, or did he see just one, and imagine the other. Was he really ever in the future? Is he imagining it all? The movie leaves it up to you to decide whether Bruce Willis is from the future and saves the world, or whether he's just crazy, and we are seeing this from a crazy persons viewpoint. It's done so subtley that getting caught up in the dramatic story, one can miss the clues. I didnt catch this upon the first viewing, many images Bruce see's in the story are repeated, so as to imply that Willis was imagining things, or was he? Also, in scenes where Madeline Stowe is convinced he's from the future, they are alone! If one removes the scenes where he's ALONE with people, the case can be made that the entire adventure is imagined!Also, he says he's not crazy, but he hears voices when he's in the hospital, and he pulls out his teeth, because they've got radio transmitters in them! And the voice he hears in his headis from somebody he meets LATER in the film for the first time. Or maybe he IS crazy and knew him before he imagined he was a time traveller! So did he imagine them?  The reviewer before me was left with questions about the scientist from the &quot;future&quot; being on the plane. This is the last clue they leave you with, and it messes with your head. If one watches the movie starting with the premise that Bruce is crazy, the movie is another movie!   UNLIKE the Sixth Sense or Usual Suspects, this movie does'nt give you the big dramatic payoff at the end, when you find out what the truth is. That big payoff made one want to see the Sixth Sense again to see the clues you then knew must exist.Monkey's just leaves you hanging.So you can enjoy it on two levels. This movie totally messes with your head. I'll save you some time: Bruce Willis is crazy and 12 Monkey's are the imaginings of a paranoid schitzophrenic. Or are they? By the way, voices helped me write this review ;)

B000065V3H|1.0|This is an excellent movie, and I would buy it in a second, were it not for the fact that it's only available in 'full-screen' (pan &amp; scan) format.  I want the whole picture!  Until then, i'm not buying.
B00006690G|5.0|Although I can't say that all the songs on this CD (\\"Drips\\" in particular), this is the best CD that Eminem has yet released.<br />I enjoyed every single song on the Marshall Mathers LP, but the violence and vulgarity of the CD turned me away from listening to it continuously, although it did add to the unique lyrics and sound of Eminem. But this CD, The Eminem Show, is so much more than vulgar lyrics (which he has cut down on substantially as compared to his last one) and greatly outshines the Marshall Mathers LP.<br />The song \\"Cleaning Out My Closet\\" is the most insightful song I have ever heard by this man. I love the beat, the lyrics, the song... He even successfully pulls off singing (although I have no qualms with the singing in \\"Hailie's Song\\" either) to create a unique song that is only Eminem's style<br />To me, Eminem is the definition of rap at its best, and this particular CD is well worth the money.
B000002GWN|5.0|This live recording, in my opinion, (and like the<br />majority write about) is one of several must have<br />collections of live music from the 70's. Joni seemed<br />to grow right before your eyes and never stood still,<br />what she did in 1970 was totally different just 5 years<br />later. It must have been difficult for her to try to<br />refine and still keep her fans happy with her brillant<br />mind always at work, always moving on.  This collection like so much of her material<br />is so hard to classify by words, uplifting and sophisticated and during a time of social unrest, her music, especially on this<br />live set really brought Joni's music and songwriting to life, as did Court and Spark, which preceded this set with its touches of<br />jazzy pop/rock<br />and really expanded my world and opened my eyes to where music<br />could be taken.  This is not for everybodys<br />taste but it sure was for mine. So many people love this or that<br />about Joni, she is hard to satisfy all her fans but this period<br />of time and the way she sang(right from her soul) and in peak<br />vocals just the best in my opinion,(much less shrill in tone), than some earlier work, a voice untouchable with very few<br />peers to compare. Buy this LIVE COLLECTION, its a period of time to cherish and revisit, she was so ahead of her time.<br />It will be very interesting to see what she comes up with in early<br />2003 taking so many of her earlier works as well as newer stuff to a double cd all<br />Orcestrated, and with that voice,(and many friends), like her material, always changing.
B00005JKG7|5.0|There's something about John Carpenter's films that are so much unlike Stephen King, Steven Spielberg or Clive Barker.  Carpenter leave's no room for humor.  He likes to terrify you from start to finish.  And, to make \\"The Fog\\" even more terrifying, the DVD version is like seeing this 23-year-old flick at a first-run theatre.  The picture quality and sound are AWESOME!  SO what's this flick all about?  I have always been terrified by fog.  I grew up in a town that was shrouded by fog most of the inter-seasons and it was like walking/driving with your eyes closed.  The fog in this film is filled with much more than a damp breathe of fresh air.  There is terror in the fog...a haunting memory of death and deception.  I give Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis, Janet Leigh, John Houseman and Hal Holbrook five stars for their perfectly cast roles in this horror classic.  Granted, it was released in 1979, but the DVD version is much better than many modern-made horror flicks.  Horror fans need to add this one to their collection.  The music, also created by John Carpenter, is reminiscent of \\"Halloween\\"...a heavy, solemn, freaky sound that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  I dare you to go into the fog.  I dare you!
0393312836|5.0|this book is very good although also very disturbing.  the book gives u the feeling of isolation and it really puts the meaning of being alone from the rest of the world into perspective.  If you like a lot of violence and a tough read then this is the book for you.  If you can get past the weird slang (which i found awesome) then you can pretty much understand the basic meaning of the book.  i think a constitution can be written from reading this book.  well this book ranks among my favorites including fight club and hannibal.  so if you like those books, i'm positive you'll like this one
B00005JL1C|4.0|This is a cute movie made in 1987.  This movie was made when teen movies were fresh and original not like now which they are vulgar unfunny and mean-spirited.  As usual John Hughes makes a great teen movie.  I won't give the movie away but it doesn't end how you will think it ends.  I suggest this movie there isn't much on the DVD but the movie is just great by itself anyways.
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer has a beautiful young voice. His songs are all very good and unique. I hate that people compare artists to eachother. Each artist is different. And if you don't care for someone's music thats fine but you shouldn't insult them after all their hard work. Anyways I think John Mayer is Brilliant. And you should definately buy his cd b/c everyone is talking about it. John Mayer ROX!!!
B000069AUI|5.0|A rush of blood to the head is actually better than parachutes.  It is a bit darker and heavier, but retains all the sweetness that can be expected of coldplay.  It is a rush of music to the ears...Great album!
0140186395|5.0|I am a voracious and selective reader and recently decided to read this book as a departure from the contemporary novels I generally read.  Steinbeck is a flawless writer!  His powerful character sketches especially of Cathy (Kate), and interweaving of the families' complex and profound stories provoke visceral and lasting impressions.   Steinbeck is hard to beat, in any era!
0671891634|4.0|I had read this book back near the beginning of the real boom time (sometime in the mid-90s), and rereading it now made me wish that I had paid much closer attention back then. Even though this book is extremely optimistic about the stock market and was written well before internet mania, there are probably 50 different sentences sprinkled throughout the book that would have kept me out of the market during the next few years and saved me a lot of money had I remembered any of them. When this book is slow, it can be really slow. But when Mr. Lynch does hit gold, it's the motherload. Indeed, the last three pages of the book, \\"20 Golden Rules,\\" are probably worth the purchase price alone (particularly since you can almost certainly buy this book used for less than $5 at any time). The last third of the book, where Mr. Lynch gives advice on investing in a number of different industries, ranges from incredibly useful to skippable, depending on what you already have some knowledge about.<br />I have two particular criticisms of this book. One is that, although Mr. Lynch's tales of his days running Magellan make it clear that he was selling only a little less often than he was buying, he doesn't give much advice about how to go about that side of things. Secondly, although the book starts off with the story of a group of elementary school kids who beat the pros, the rest of the book seems to contradict Mr. Lynch's implication that a 10 year-old can do this. Although this book is very readable, one can't help but come away with the conclusion that investing in stocks is hard (if you don't think so, you may living on luck). Mr. Lynch's main argument is that you don't have to be a pro to invest in stocks, but just about every story that he has about researching a stock includes him talking to the CEO of the potential investment at some point. I'm not expecting to be able to replicate that research technique.<br />Still, I'd highly recommend this book, and I look forward to reading his other well-known book, \\"One Up on Wall Street.\\"
0679735909|5.0|I read this book years ago when it first came out.  It was incredibly well written.  Very much a contemporary romance novel (not the 18th century term of the word), but so well written that it defies those trashy paperbacks that line the grocery store checkout aisles.  If you are looking for clever writing, intelligent adult dialogue, and a romance that makes you believe such a thing still can exist then read this book.
0792839749|1.0|First I have to say: I love this movie. That's why I would not touch this DVD with a ten foot pole. A trailer and a nice booklet is the best they can do? I don't think so. But what's worse: the movie is presented fullscreen, when in fact it should be the widest widescreen you've ever seen! I'm really glad I didn't throw away my good old faithful laserdisc collection.<br />Otherwise Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is a treat for the whole family. Dick Van Dyke is wonderful as always. Produced by Cubby Broccoli after a novel by Ian Fleming the movie features Desmond Llewelyn (James Bonds \\"Q\\") in a small role as a mechanic. Also look for Benny Hill and Lionel Jeffries. German Baddie Gert Fröbe (aka \\"Goldfinger\\") gives a wonderful over-the-top performance as evil Baron Bomburst. And the Child Catcher scared the living daylights out of me, when I saw the movie as a child. <br />Dear MGM-Lion, what were you thinking when you put this great movie on such a lousy DVD? Please give it to the fans in the correct widescreen format and with a few extra treats. The movie deserves this - and I think we deserve it too.
B0000640VO|5.0|If you have lost faith in film over the past few years, take heart.  This film is a keeper!  It is sweet, mesmerizing, and a sheer joy to watch.  Audrey Tautou is adorable!!! She will steal your heart.
B000002KBU|5.0|What a great collection of songs!  She really did put together a great album here.  Looking for a soothing evening?  This is the album for you.<br />Highlights on this album include:  &quot;My Old Man&quot;, &quot;Carey&quot;, &quot;California&quot;, &quot;River&quot; and &quot;A Case of You.&quot;  Brings you back to the days of great songwriting and great singing.  What's up with all the vocal acrobatics these days?  This is how music should sound like!<br />Joni Mitchell brings an honesty to these songs and really speaks to you through these songs.
B000066NW0|5.0|This album is probably one of the best I've ever heard. It's nice to finally take a breath of total anti-Britney-ness in a new artist after such a long time of having almost every new singer show up in the pop world trying to out-do Britney Spears. Avril Lavigne mixes punk rock with pop to make a totally awesome album that most people can relate to. Heck, even SIMON COWEL (or however that's spelled) said that she is the true American Idol.
B00004S8X5|4.0|Okay, kiddies.  FYI, Kylie Minogue has been around for quite some time.  I just knew that she was coming back!  &quot;Can't Get You Out of My Head&quot; is not what made Kylie big!  It is her first hit in the US since the mid-'80s!<br />On this album, the songs that were hits were the first 2 songs and the third was a moderate smash...but no one speaks French in this country unless you live in Louisiana or taking French as your language requirement in high school.  For your American listeners, these should be the only songs you know of hers, besides her current hits.  In the meantime, she's been a huge success in England and everywhere else.<br />&quot;I Should Be So Lucky&quot; is one of those happy songs that came out of the 80's.  You don't really hear them when they have those 80's flahsbacks on the radio.  Hmmm... I think I may have to call in a request.  Although, I remember as a child back then calling the radio station a year after her hits and requesting her songs and having the DJ on the phone say, &quot;HUH?  WHO?  NO, WE DON'T HAVE HIM.&quot;  And Kylie's a HER!  The nerve!<br />&quot;The Loco-Motion&quot; is a remake of the classic 50's/60's song by that girl group whose name escapes mymind at the moment.  (Wasn't it one of those Spector groups?)  Anyway, this is the BIG hit that she had.  You'd recognize this one!<br />This is a cute album.  The other songs are quite bubblegum-ish.  Cute pop tunes for background when you're not paying attention.
B00005ATQD|1.0|This movie should be avoided at all costs.  I started watching it and I turned to stone.  It was as enjoyable as watching Medusa.  Please, stay away!  Tom and Nicole are still in therapy over this thing.  All you artsy types are quick to jump on the bandwagon of anything that is strange and unusual.  Well this movie is not strange and unusual.  It is strange and ....!
0452282152|2.0|After all the great reviews of this book, perhaps I had unrealistic expectations...I read this book quickly, hoping that something, anything, exciting would happen.  Ultimately, I was disappointed.  <br />Throughout the book it seems as though the author is trying to build the readers anticipation for an ultimate shocking scene, a scene which never materializes.  I will give the author credit for building great characters; characters that you can truly like and dislike with good reason.  The characters were believable, but the plot was just not there.   My advice?  Borrow it from a friend or the library, but don't spend your money...
B00005BJ2O|5.0|When I bought the CD a year ago, I only bought it for Elephant Love Madeley, which I had seen on Vh1 earlier. But I was surprised. The first song, &quot;Nature Boy&quot; by David Bowie, is haunting and looming, and a very accurate description of Christian's descent into the Underworld that was Momartre.<br />The other songs are also great; Nicole Kidmans remake of &quot;Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend&quot; Ewan's &quot;Your Song&quot; which puts Elton John to SHAME, &quot;Children of the Revoulution&quot; By Bono are just a few.<br />The real jewel of the CD though, is &quot;Tango de Roxanne&quot; sung by Ewan McGregor, Jacek Koman, and Jose Feliciano. The Police's so-so song about a prostitute suddenly has new life when Koman sings the opening lines, followed by McGregor, singing in such a voice that you know his heart is breaking. Once you see the moive, you know that the song goes along witht eh darkest part of the movie, and is perfect for it. <br />All in all, the CD is wonderful, and so is it's companion CD, Moulin Rouge!2.
0375704027|5.0|After I finished reading this book in a single, frenzied session, I sat still,... devastated, for a long, long time.
B000063NPX|5.0|with its breathtaking visuals and sweeping story, \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" deserves to be at the top of the best animated films of all time, alongside \\"The Secret of NIMH\\" and \\"The Little Mermaid.\\"<br />The story and initial impact not affected by the musical sequence that Disney added in for the special 2002 release, \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" is the classic story of a beautiful, kind girl who finds a heart of gold in a hardened man whose cruelty earns him cursed to be a beast, until he can find true love before his twenty-first birthday, or he will be cursed to remain a beast for all time.<br />The story is impeccably written and the voice actors (Paige O'Hara, Robby Benson, Angela Lansbury, etc) imbue their characters with life, spunk and character. With its gorgeous animation, incredible voice acting, solid morals and flawless story; it's not surprising that it garnered a 1991 Academy Award nomination for Best Picture and won Academy Awards for some of the songs written.<br />My advice, see it before or when it comes out on the Platinium Edition VHS and DVD {...} to fully appreciate the love and work into creating this. If you like it, buy both the VHS and DVD. The DVD is especially to die for, because it features documentaries into \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", the original and new version of the film, both of which have been restored to their original brilliance; and other good stuff.<br />Buy it, rent it, I don't care, but see it. It is worth the money to relive this masterpiece over and over. Worth every penny.
044084181X|5.0|I really love this classic story, and reading it as a play allowed me to see it from a director's point of view.  Perfect for use in a school production, or children's roleplay at home.  Easy reading, simple for a young child to understand.
B00000IPAX|4.0|Blink may be sold out, but i still like 'em. This is their sellout debut but i dont really care. I like money too. Anyways, standout tracks are dumpweed, dysentery gary, and adams song. Most are great though, not much filler if any. Lots of ppl love this cd and i can see why, very catchy songs from these guys. I like the earlier stuff better but most prefer the new blink b/c theyre more &quot;popish&quot; songs i suppose. If you like these guys i also recommend new found glory or good charlotte. Basically all pop-punk type stuff. Back to the cd, good, but cheshire cat and dude ranch are better.
B00006G8G1|5.0|WOW!  This DVD is way phenomenal thru and thru (and it was only 15 bills at Best Buy)!  This is a shining example of how music DVD's should be done right.  It captures the essence of a live Iron Maiden performance as if you are there (well, almost), and the video and audio quality and shots are top-notch professional!...  The camera work and angles are 'you are there' real!...  The extras (about 50 minutes worth on Disc 2) are entertaining as well.  Iron Maiden was and is one of the definitive true metal bands to ever grace this planet, and continue to be an inspiration to metal afficionados and musicians the world over.  Moreover, they are appreciative of their fans, and like fine wine, seem to get better with age!  To see them in front of a quarter of a million rabid fans in Rio is confirmation that 'nu-metal' has NOT, and hopefully will not, displace the musical mastery of classic metal bands!  Incidentally, I am a 41 year young hard rock/metal fanatic, and this stuff keeps me young!  Long live Iron Maiden and classic metal!
B000003TAW|5.0|.  these guys are awesome. Every song on this cd is listenable. The guitars, vocals, lyrics, everything just fits. Dont be quick to judge b/c they have an odd name and look like a quartet of dorks, j/k, these guys make great music. I could listen to this cd all the way through for hours...all 10 of them, which is the only thing i dislike about the album, its a bare-bones 10 tracks long, making u beg for more, or at least i do. Standout tracks are my name is jonas, in the garage, and say it aint so. Recommended for anyone w/ taste in music.
B000066NW0|4.0|&quot;Let go&quot; is the debut album of avril lavigne, who appears in the music scene just like a rocket. She is young, came from nowhere and has already won a MTV award! I´m impressed with her talent. Things are going too fast for her! I really liked this album and I recommend it. It´s rock/punk and the lyrics are great. It is inevitable to compare avril with alanis, and I think this is good for her, at least now. <br />&quot;Complicated&quot; is a smash hit and it´s over played everywhere. So much that I´m sick of it, though I like this song a lot. The lyrics are about a girl who is tired of her boyfriend, who wears &quot;preppy&quot; clothes and tries to be someone else,acting like a fool. <br />&quot;Sk8er boi&quot; is the new single. very rocky. It´s like a modern tale about a young couple, the sk8er boy and the ballet dancer, who take different paths. He becomes a star on MTV and she stays at home, waiting for him.<br />&quot;I´m with you&quot; is a great rock ballad. I especially like the violins at the back and the lyrics are good as well. I bet it will be released as a single sometime in a near future (I hope so).<br />&quot;Anything but ordinary&quot; is another great song. The message is that even when we make mistakes, we want to be anything, but ordinary. The important thing is to be remember and not to be ashamed to try to make things work out.  <br />&quot;Things I´ll never say&quot; is a melodic song. Good lyrics, showing the desires of avril and every other girl of her age, with a little bit of attitude.  <br />&quot;Unwanted&quot;, &quot;tomorrow&quot; and &quot;losing grip&quot; are great rock tracks and make this album worth. Rock and punk fans will surely like it.<br />All I can say is that avril lavigne is a young and talented singer and may have a long career, just like alanis. However, I´m afraid she becames a victim of her own success. People are trying to show her as the skater girl, who wears baggy clothes and doesn´t try to be beautiful. Actually, people expect her to be the anti-britney, as if she needed that to become more popular and respected as a singer. I´m sorry, but this is the wrong way to start. <br />&quot;Let go&quot; is a great CD and it does not leave my CD player right now.
0451191153|1.0|this is comic book Nietzsche.  If you like this, do yourself a favor and read the source of this tributary.  That it is writ by an ex-patriot Russian she male should give pause to her(?) politics, and such an hyperbolic ad hominem attack is justified due to the juvenal nature of her corpus.<br />  That this is still read should make any thinker pray for death or roused to kill.  Gods!  Stifle the bile climbing my throat!
0380820846|4.0|Review for Bridgertons: Happily Ever After (since Amazon seems to mix up reviews for all Bridgerton books)... This book is a fun set of '2nd Epilogues' for each of the original books, for those who've read them.  Quinn provides a couple of pages of context - enough for those who've read the books to recall key elements, but probably not enough for those who haven't. No big surprises but fun to revisit the families.  Quinn even tried writing in the first person for one story, which worked well.
B000006TRV|5.0|The Wall is still quite an album, for a number of reasons:<br />#1: It Does Have Something To Say: This record dates from a time when serious rock musicians were well educated and constructed sophisticated, if misguided, arguments with their music. No matter that, as we grow older, we might think their arguments are wrong. at least they had arguments. Nowadays, the only thing that passes for ascerbic social commentary is Marshall Mathers. Keep it up, Eminem - you're our only hope!<br />#2: Yes, It's Excruciatingly Self-Indulgent, But So Is A Lot Of Really Important Art: No-one rapped Vincent Van Gogh for his stifling self-pity when he cut his ear off and painted his own portrait with a bandage on, did they? Did we smugly cackle at Tracey Emin's found-object sculpture of her own unmade bed? (Actually, we did, and rightly so. But Tracey is no Vincent Van Gogh, nor is she a Roger Waters).<br />#3: It's Desolate But Strangely Beautiful: Well, not even strangely beautiful; in some places, just flat-out beautiful: The luscious major progression over the choruses in Comfortably Numb, and *that* guitar solo; Water's plaintive lyrics, plaintively sung, in Nobody Home; the icy, barren angles of Don't Leave Me Now. It's affecting. It's hauinting. And, at least when you're seventeen, it *means* something about your own life which nobody else on the planet understands.<br />#4: It Doesn't Sound Like Anything Else. Not even any other Floyd record sounds like it. It's completely unmistakeable. Unique. Except for the bit that sounds like Survivor's Eye Of The Tiger.<br />#5: It's Funny. Yes, Intentionally Funny: In The Happiest Days Of Our Lives, we hear cane strike posterior,.... from the owner  of the bottom. The \\"oh my god what a fabulous room!\\" routine. The Trial - a witty (and very well drawn) caricature of Lloyd Webber.<br />#6: An Axe-Head's Delight: All students of the electric guitar should own this record. In Another Brick In The Wall (Part II), Mother, Hey You, and Comfortably Numb, you have five of the greatest guitar solos ever to land up embedded in polyvinyl. Doff your hat to David Gilmour (who also wrote and scored many of the achingly beautiful bits (see #3 above)).<br />#7: It's Knowing. On In The Flesh, the Floyd pretends to be a band pretending to be the Floyd. And the record ends with a truncated sentence... which is completed in the run-in grooves at the beginning. All frightfully self-reflexive. But that's all jolly good fun, in a pop record.<br />And if that weren't enough, even though it was an expensive double album The Wall managed, in the straitened financial times of 1979, to sell 17 million copies.<br />Now, can seventeen million Floyd-heads be wrong?ortably Numb, you have five of the greatest guitar solos ever to land up embedded in polyvinyl.

B000001E7V|5.0|Like so many other musicians, Tricky is absolutely full of himself. He believes his music a stop gap in music today that can only be acheived by his own doing. You know what, that's just fine with me. When something comes along with the style, grace, and depth of Maxinquaye, you have to give credit where credit is do. Even if the author is one stuck up [jerk]The first thing that is you must realize is that nothing is what it seems on this record. First perceptions of a song will change after a few listens to till you really realize the point of the song. This is where lies the genious of the record. Tricky makes intrigues you with a first listen, but makes you search deeper with every following listen, making it a record you will want to hear over and over(I had to dilerberately stop listening to this because other CDs of mine were getting neglected). The vocal interplay between Tricky himself and female vocalist Martina is sometimes angry, sometimes sensual. Infact, the whole CD runs through a variety of sounds and moods, all of the tracks maintaining quality all the way through. The sampled goods are always fitting and never out of place, with tracks being brilliantly textured and well arranged.<br />Tricky likes to think of him as the cutting edge master of trip hop(even if he hates that term). Whether or not that's true, he still knows craft and Maxinquaye is an excellent starting point anyone interested in the genre. This sits in well with anyone who loves Mezzanine but doesn't paticular like Blue Lines(or for those who like both, like me). Just don't let his ego get you down. This is one of the few albums that lives up to its creator's hype.
B00005T7I1|5.0|The DVD may not be fully loaded with extras or special features, but the outstanding picture and sound quality makes up for all of that...\\"Dick Tracy\\" is an incredible movie and can be enjoyed by everyone of all ages...Warren Beatty stars as Tracy; a tough detective who is determined to fight crime at any cost.  One of the main bad guys he is trying to get off the streets for good is none other than Big Boy (Al Pacino).  But Big Boy isn't going down without a fight, and is willing to put a stop to Tracy's career with his gang of colorful hoodlums...  I really did enjoy this movie, and it is a classic. There are still elements of danger and suspence...  The actors did a great job. Beatty is awesome as Tracy, but I have to say this; as always, it is Pacino who steals the show.  He is so alive and colorful in this movie.  Had it not been for his famous voice, you would've never known it was Al...Warren Beatty also directed the movie and did an awesome job at doing so.  Everything about the movie was convincing and believable. Had this project been given to someone else, chances are that the results wouldn't had been as good.<br />This is a movie that you can watch with your kids, being that the rating of the movie is only PG.  There is violence, but it is not graphic and is even really cartoonish at times.  There is some sensuality in it...As I said, the DVD isn't loaded with any special features, but the crystal clear picture quality and phenominal sound makes up for it.  The movie can be played in DTS, which sounds really fantastic...But the picture is the show stopper.  The colorful and dark settings really stand out like never before.  There is no way in the world that any VHS could do this movie the justice it deserves.<br />\\"Dick Tracy\\" is a great movie that continues to entertain people of all ages.  Filled with action, suspence, and a lot of humor, this movie does not disappoint.  If you have not seen the movie already, check it out as soon as you can.
B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix is a sci-fi, action-stuffed, hit hard movie! I totally recommend... Though it is not easy to tell what is happening the first time you see it, once you see it a second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, ect. time you totally get and luff it! Many people might think it's weird and it is... but weird is always best. ^^ The creators of this movie and plot are ingenius but still at the same time fun loving and unique. They love anime and wrote the whole movie on story boards in a sort of Manga style... The actors are so awesome! I think Keanu Reeves, Lawrence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss totally made the part... and they're outfits really pulled they're look together. I am excited to hear that the TWO sequals are coming out  May 15, 2003!! WHOOOO!! ^^ Wif the same actors and more! The Matrix Reloaded and The matrix Revolutions. It's back!
B00005JL8C|5.0|In French, with English subtitles, this film is a risky psychological drama about a well-respected music professor at a prestigious Vienna music school.  She's in her forties, wears no makeup, keeps her hair in a bun and dresses in the plainest of clothes.  As a teacher, she is severe and demanding.  She and her mother live together and their constant arguments include slaps and tears and reconciliation.  Her secret life, however, includes pornography, voyeurism and genital self-mutilation. When an attractive young man starts to pursue her romantically, she shocks him with her perversions. How this all plays out is fascinating and the eventual conclusion is inevitable, but along the way the audience is plunged into this very unsettling world.<br />Isabelle Huppert's performance as the teacher is absolutely magnificent.  There are a lot of close-ups of her unsmiling freckled face and dark opaque emotionless eyes.  There is a vague reference to her father being in an insane asylum; other than that there is no back-story to help us understand her.  Benoit Magimel, cast as her young suitor, has a difficult role as well.  During the course of the film, we watch him change before our eyes.  All the other characters are also well cast and give outstanding performances.<br />The director, Michael Haneke, kept the tension and erotic undercurrent strong throughout. There is a lot of classical music and scenes of recitals and piano lessons in a very rigid and upscale world. And then there are those scenes targeted to make the audience squirm in their seats. When all the elements are put together, the results are a film that will long haunt my memories.<br />The Piano Teacher is not for everyone.  But for those adventurous few who are willing to experience the different and dramatic, don't miss it.
B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix is a sci-fi, action-stuffed, hit hard movie! I totally recommend... Though it is not easy to tell what is happening the first time you see it, once you see it a second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, ect. time you totally get and luff it! Many people might think it's weird and it is... but weird is always best. ^^ The creators of this movie and plot are ingenius but still at the same time fun loving and unique. They love anime and wrote the whole movie on story boards in a sort of Manga style... The actors are so awesome! I think Keanu Reeves, Lawrence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss totally made the part... and they're outfits really pulled they're look together. I am excited to hear that the TWO sequals are coming out  May 15, 2003!! WHOOOO!! ^^ Wif the same actors and more! The Matrix Reloaded and The matrix Revolutions. It's back!
0451191153|4.0|Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead is an engrossing and challenging literary/philosophical book.  <br />At one level, the novel is a simple story, following the life of Howard Roark, an architect with daring vision and uncompromising standards who battles psychologically (and occasionally physically) with the world around him.  Roark dares to design buildings not for their aesthetic or functional purposes as defined by others, but rather for their prima facie, self-serving purposes--a goal which Roark (and Rand) believes is pure and perfect, for the human ego is the fountainhead of all progress.  In opposition to Roark is seemingly the rest of the world--charlatan characters who merely imitate and debase the pure egotistical nature of man.  Peter Keating and Ellsworth Toohey are the main antagonists, both of whom live parasitic, relativistic existences that run counter to Roark's objective philosophical purity.<br />At the second and more important level, The Fountainhead is an introduction to Rand's philosophy of objectivism, which exalts man's place in the universe and actively promotes egoism, capitalism and objective reality as its virtues.  Rand's characters are caricatures, as Rand exaggerates her perspective to drive home her philosophical points.  <br />Regardless of what one thinks about Rand's philosophy, The Fountainhead is an engrossing story that, despite its length, keeps the reader's attention throughout.  Readers will really have to think throughout the novel and will be filled with many questions and doubts at the end of the book as Rand makes a forceful and often persuasive case against modern American society.  <br />While I found Rand's philosophy to be a bit obnoxious and oversimplified, it did not get in the way of me enjoying this book.  Unfortunately, much of the debate about this book has been clouded by people's philosophical and political leanings.  The people who enjoy this book the most are those who go in with an open mind.  Whether you conclude the book in total agreement or utter disgust with Rand's philosophy is moot--readers will be better off for having read this intellectually challenging book.

B00005YXZH|5.0|Wilco's new disc is neither the greatest CD to see the light of day in the past year, nor is it a cacophonous travesty untrue to their Americana roots.  Instead Tweedy and the boys put some sonic mustard on fairly straightforward songs, yielding a very strong hybrid of alt-country meets Stereolab and Radiohead.  At times the songs are pop &amp; hook oriented (Heavy Metal Drummer, I'm the Man Who Loves You), others are electronica rockers (War on War), and yet others are dark and spacey (Radio Cure).  Overall the music reaches some beautiful places, though some may find it less accessible than previous Wilco albums.  I have to admit I got this CD on the recommendation of a friend, but had reservations because I was only moderately interested in Wilco's earlier work.  It took 2 or 3 listens, but then I really, really dug it, and now it's in my regular rotation.  <br />It's also mixed up with a great story about their label dropping them last year because they HATED the album and wouldn't release it.  Wilco resigned under an affiliate of the same parent label (which means technically the parent label paid for it twice!) and the band got the last laugh 'cause it's #1 on college radio right now.  Documented in the new indie movie &quot;I am Trying to Break Your Heart&quot;.  So the album is of some historical value as well.
B00005UEAR|5.0|You will not be disappointed with this album. It is similar in style to the previous album, Scenes from a Memory, but better. Those of you who are familiar with Scenes will remember that this album had 3 low points:<br />(1) Beyond This Life- The song is good, but the guitar and keyboard solos are pointless.<br />(2) Home- This song is too long (the verse part repeats over and over), ... and the guitar and keyboard solos are pointless.<br />(3) Through Her Eyes- This song was obviously placed on the album in the hope that it would appeal to a larger audience and be released as a single. But this song will put you to sleep.<br />On Six Degrees of Inner Turbulance, they avoid many of the mistakes they made on the previous album:<br />First, the guitar and keyboard solos on this album are all good.<br />....<br />Finally, there is no obvious single on this album. I find the beggining of Goodnight Kiss to be a little bit annoying, but this song would never pass as a pop single.
B000000OQF|5.0|When 'Appetite For Destruction' was first released, I was a 5th grader living in Atlantic Canada developing my own taste in music for the first time, independent of what my parents played in the house. I got my first dose of Guns 'N Roses around then, and became an instant fan -- they had it all to me: style, great music, and a spirit of rebellion. By 1990 however, my love for G'N'R had waned siginificantly, largely because a) my young ears were unaccustomed to the \\"n-word\\" being used in rock music [on G'N'R's \\"One In A Million\\" from the 'Lies' album] and b) I was more into R&B like Keith Sweat and Janet Jackson at that time. Plus, I got to see a drunk Slash and Duff curse up a storm (aired live and *unedited* in Nova Scotia!) during their slurred acceptance speeches at the 1990 American Music Awards. Not only was I turned off from Guns 'N Roses, but the largely seedy genre of Heavy Metal music in general...<br />Twelve years later, I'm at a point in which I can appreciate music for what it is regardless of genre. I still have my faves (Pop, Soul/R&B) but *great* music is always able to transcend categorization. The 'Appetite For Destrution' album is a brilliant example of this: musically, it has stood the test of time, and ripened into a magnificent artifact of rock music history. As a result of this, 'Appetite' has become one of the ultimate \\"bandwagon\\" albums of all time, meaning everyone and their momma extols praise and virtue for it. While other so-called \\"classic\\" albums may not always deserve this level of attention, 'Appetite For Destruction' most certainly does. Now let's get to the music itself:<br />\\"Welcome To The Jungle\\" is a hyper-adrenalized sonic assault that is my third favorite Guns 'N Roses song of all time (the other two are also on this album). But before I go on, I *must* digress. \\"You Could Be Mine\\" from the Terminator 2 soundtrack must have been written during this time period (which is #4 on my top G'N'R songs) because a lyric from that song is reprinted on the liner notes of this album -- and that would explain why that song is so brilliant as well...[End digression]<br />\\"It's So Easy\\" is notable for the lower vocal register Axl lays out on this head-nodder that sounds like it may have influenced the styles of Nirvana and *especially* Stone Temple Pilots (think: \\"Sex-Type Thing\\"). \\"Nighttrain\\" is a decent album cut that keeps the energy going, but it gets better with every listen. \\"Out Ta Get Me\\" is a song I remember from my younger days, and kind of reminds me of Def Leppard's \\"Excitable\\" (from 'Hysteria')...another decent cut.<br />\\"Mr. Brownstone\\" is a *great* song that communicates an apathetic (yet hopelessly compulsive!) attitude to the nth degree, and is easily one of the album's melodic (and thematic) highlights. \\"Paradise City\\" is probably one of the most recognizeable rock tunes ever (especially the Slash riff!), and always warrants a repeat (or three-peat) whenever listening to this album. \\"Paradise City\\" is my favorite Guns 'N Roses song of all time, and (to me) it marked the creative *peak* of '80s rock music hands down.<br />While \\"My Michelle\\" and \\"Think About You\\" are anything but filler, after a song like \\"Paradise City\\" they're simply \\"okay\\" songs one usually acquires a taste for. But the signature intro riff (which surprisingly hasn't been sampled yet!) to \\"Sweet Child 'O Mine\\" ushers in one of the best (if not best) rock love songs ever recorded. Passionate without being sappy, \\"Sweet Child 'O Mine\\" ranks as a close 2nd behind \\"Paradise City\\" as my favorite Guns 'N Roses song of all time.<br />\\"You're Crazy\\" is another adrenalized song that carries on the wild and rebellious spirit of the 'Appetite' album. Same can be said for \\"Anything Goes\\" and the last song of the album, \\"Rocket Queen\\". 'Appetite For Destruction', along with albums by Def Leppard and Bon Jovi, and television shows like the Transformers are some of the pop culture hallmarks of 80s currently experiencing a comeback. Thank goodness, because it's about time Axl (Starscream and Megatron rolled into one in my humble opinion) returned from obscurity.<br />Thanks for reading!back.

0452282152|5.0|The author so adeptly puts the reader in Griet's place that by the time Griet was forced to choose her life's path on the village star, I felt as if I was there making the decision, dizzy, flushed, torn by the choices. My initial disappointment over Griet's choice settled into a sad acceptance of the limitations of the time and place. It is the same with the fighting vegetables and the hair...the hope and suspense they triggered ultimately dissolved into resignation: Griet's own artistic eye could never be appreciated, and Griet's love for the only man who appreciated her artistic eye and for whom she would have let down her hair--literally and figuratively--could never be realized. Chevalier skillfully weaves into Griet's story an account of the Dutch master Vermeer and of the social mores in Vermeer's time, particularly the role of women of various classes. She also uses &quot;sight&quot; as a device in various forms--I haven't thought them all through yet, but it would be worth re-reading the book just to find all variations and their intents, e.g., the father's blindness, the amplification of sight via the camera obscura, the suitor's inability to see the blood, etc.
B00005OAIE|5.0|My taste in music varies and I don't buy a CD until I am sure I like more than one song on it.  When &quot;No Such Thing&quot; was released I was attracted to the catchy lyrics and infectious rhythms.  I had heard &quot;Your Body is a Wonderland&quot; a few times and absolutely loved it.  So I took a chance and bought the album.<br />I could listen to Room For Squares every day.  My favorites on this album are &quot;3x5&quot;, Love Song to No One&quot;, and &quot;Great Indoors.&quot;  Mayer has a creative way of writing lyrics and a unique musical style that combines blues, and rock.  I would recommend it to anyone and am trying to convert my friends to be John Mayer fans.
B0000025YL|3.0|Ok, hold on now, let's not gush too much about this album. Yes, this is a good 80's metal album, but to give it five stars is a bit much. (Can any 80's metal album garner five?)  What you get with this album is an above average and faster version of Judas Priest.  But this is not a bad thing.  Yes, the songs &quot;Fast as a Shark,&quot; &quot;Restless and Wild,&quot; and &quot;Princess of the Dawn,&quot; are above average cuts, but the rest of the numbers are adequate rockers at best.  The key to this album is that eventhough there are limited stellar tracks, there is not one bad song. Four stars is too high of a rating while three stars is too low.  A worthy used disc purchase.
B000067G3C|5.0|I really love this movie because of the plot, the acting and the stars. I recommend this movie to everyone. This is my favourite action movie.
B0000025YW|4.0|When listing classic 80's metal albums, this one has to be at, or near, the top of the list.  Continuing their heavier, if not faster, attempt to out \\"Judas\\" Judas Priest, BALLS TO THE WALLS is a superior follow up to the decent RESTLESS AND WILD.  The guitars are louder, vocals are grittier, and the homosexual innuendos more apparent.  The standout tracks on this album are the early MTV hit \\"Balls to the Walls\\", \\"Fight it Back\\", and \\"Love Child.\\"  There is really not a bad song on the album. (You might consider \\"Winterdreams\\" the only weak song.) This is a worthy purchase be it new or used.  It's hard, It's fast,...It's metal.

B00005JKDR|5.0|I wouldn't think it's necessary to say much about the story of this film -- to avoid boring people who have seen it, and to avoid possible spoilers for people who haven't (few as there may be).  Of course it's a five-star film.<br />And what could i say that hasn't been said already by someone, anyway?  I could say this film is wonderful. That it's genuinely heart-warming, and that it legitimately earns every single tear it jerks... and that the last shot is one of the most wonderful moments i've ever seen in this sort of film.  That the characterisations are spot on -- John Goodman's Sully and Billy Crystal's Mike are absolutely believable as roommate/buddies.  The computer animation is, as usual with Pixar, state-of-the-art (and, by this time, i think we can safely say that the technique is *not* just a passing fad).<br />The script is excellent, and the basic concept, that little childrens' screams, captured by appropriate machinery, power Monsteropolis, making scream collection of paramount importance (at least, until one big-hearted monster actually comes to *know* a child), is a very nice conceit on which to hang the story.<br />And that last shot...<br />But the DVD set -- ah, THERE is something to talk about... and that earns another five star rating.<br />I have had this set in my hands for a bit over a week, and i still haven't exhausted all of its possibilities. (I have found one easter egg, by the way; i'm sure there are more.)<br />DISC ONE:<br />Trailers, of course, for older films coming out on video/DVD, newer direct-to-video releases, and upcoming theatrical releases, at least one of which looks Impressive.<br />The movie, available in either widescreen or standard TV format.  The nice part here is that, unlike conventional films, shot widescreen, it was not necessary to cut off parts of the screen image to make the film fill the screen.  Instead, it was quite simple to merely have the computer make two versions of each image, the same width but to show *extra* space at the top and bottom of the frame to fill up the full height of the TV screen without having to cut anything from the width of the image.  I'd still watch it in widescreen, since that is the way the shots were actually planned, and the extra at top and bottom might alter the composition.  (I found it a bit annoying tohave to select widescreen or full;screen format every time i played the film.)<br />Sound is impeccable (there is a THX Optimiser on the disc), and, in addition to the regular track and the commentary track, there is a third track of nothjing but sound effects. (I would have liked another track or two -- say, one with commentary by Goodman and Crystal and other voice actors, and another with nothing but the music cues, maybe, but what there is is excellent.)<br />The commentary, by director Pete Docter, co-director Lee Unkrich and executive producers John Lassiter and Andrew Stanton covers a lot of odds and ends, including explaining places in the film where they had originally planned to something differently and why they changed it, explaining some of the tricky bits of the animation and some of the problems they encountered and had to solve during production -- standard enough stuff for such a commentary, but interesting.<br />DISC TWO:<br />Here's the good stuff.<br />More than i can describe, actually, though certainly i have to mention the two short films -- \\"Mike's New Car\\", created especially for this release, and \\"For the Birds\\", an absolutely hilarious short wich won the \\"Animated Short Film\\" Oscar for 2001, and richly deserved it.  One has the impression that its makers had carefully watched and absorbed every single Roadrunner cartoon.<br />There are \\"Outtakes\\", which are hilarious, even funnier than the outtakes at the end of a Jackie Chan film, which lead into the Monsters Inc employee play.<br />The main part of the disc is divided between \\"Humans Only\\" and \\"Monsters Only\\" segments:<br />Under \\"Humans Only\\", there aremultiple sections:<br />One about Pixar, itself.<br />\\"Story\\", about how the film's story developed, compared to the form it finally took, with storyboards and \\"Banished Concepts\\".<br />A \\"Monster File\\" with cast, concepts and a piece on \\"What Makes a Great Monster?\\".<br />A \\"Design\\" section (which includes a \\"Guide to 'In' Jokes\\")<br />An \\"Animation\\" section, which walks us through the entire animation process, as well as showing \\"Early Tests\\" and \\"Hard Parts\\" and finishes with a \\"Production Demonstration\\", in which the viewer can switch on the fly between several views of the production process from storyboards to finished scene (using the \\"Angle\\" button on their remote).<br />There is a \\"Music & Sound\\" section, which includes commentary on the sound design process and a demonstration of bunaural recording (have headphones handy).  I could have wished for a segment here on Randy Newman, his music for the film, and how he works with the Pixar people to produce such perfect music...  well, maybe next time.<br />And, finally, a section on the film's original release, including a visit to thepremiere, trailers and TV spots, and samples of things that had to be changed for other-language versions (there is, for instance, one sequence which had to be completely changed, because it involved a bit of pantomime which visually punned on an English-only word sound) and then gives us a really neet clip in which the action plays smoothly along with the soundtrack switching languages every few seconds.<br />The \\"Monsters Only\\" menu gives us a few things:<br />\\"New Monster Adventures\\", which includes \\"Mike's New Car\\" , a music video and material featuring \\"Monsters Inc\\" characters created for a Japanese TV program (I haven't watched this section yet, i believe it's an interactive game), and two interactive games created for this disc.<br />\\"Behind the Screams\\" is a section representing primarily the \\"Outtakes\\" and the \\"Company Play\\", also found on Disc One.<br />and, finally, \\"Orientation\\" is your welcome as a new employee of Monsters Inc.<br />I understand that this disc has some enhanced features for use in a computer DVD ROM drive, but i haven't experimented with that yet.<br />All in all, this is a Very Classy Package; well worth the price just for the film, and containing simply an incredible array of Good Stuff as well.<br />You Should Buy It.multiple sections: <br />One about Pixar, itself. <br />\\"Story\\", about how the film's story developed, compared to the form it finally took, with storyboards and \\"Banished Concepts\\".<br />A \\"Monster File\\" with cast, concepts and a piece on \\"What Makes a Great Monster?\\".<br />A \\"Design\\" section (which includes a \\"Guide to 'In' Jokes\\")<br />An \\"Animation\\" section, which walks us through the entire animation process, as well as showing \\"Early Tests\\" and \\"Hard Parts\\" and finishes with a \\"Production Demonstration\\", in which the viewer can switch on the fly between several views of the production process from storyboards to finished scene (using the \\"Angle\\" button on their remote).<br />There is a \\"Music & Sound\\" section, which includes commentary on the sound design process and a demonstration of bunaural recording (have headphones handy).

0385503954|5.0|I agree with some of the reviewers that the book was hard to get into...Too much detail,too much character analysis....  I stuck with it, however, and was amply rewarded.  We are too accustomed today to plunge immediately into the story; hence, the popularity of many of the current &quot;throw away&quot; novels.  McEwan bucks the trend and lays out the plot slowly. In doing this, he creates a memorable experience for the reader.

B000002C1V|4.0|So what if this doesn't sound like the 'classics' Meddle, Dark Side..., Wish You Were Here, Animals, or even much of its conceptual sister album, The Wall? This is just as 'listenable' as the aforementioned discs, with the difference being that The Final Cut dispenses with the spacey vibes and operatic grandeur in favor of a stark, confessionalistic approach. Composer Roger Waters has crafted probably the single most heartfelt and cathartic musical document since Lennon's no-hold's-barred Plastic Ono Band(1970). Even more personal than The Wall, the more despairing atmosphere and the lack of much of Floyd's previous reassuring spaciousness(Meddle, DSOTM, WYWH)and sound effects-layden heightened paranoia(Animals, The Wall)qualifies this as the distilled 'essence' of the band. This is Water's vision with guitarist Gilmour adding his emotion enhancing solos only minimally. Mason drums less than ever and Wright hadn't played keys on album since '79, and then only minimally. One would think that the minimalization of Mason and Gilmore, and complete absence of Wright would lessen the emotional wallop, but right from the first track, Waters shows his intentions are to move the willing listener with his on-the-knuckle lyrics and excellent use of musical dynamics. His pain-wracked, bitter, and scathing vocal performance(with some of his renowned dark humor thrown in)coupled with the majestic orchestra arrangements are the emotional wallop. This, of course, is why the other 3 members of Floyd don't feel much of it, because they no doubt resent Roger for taking so much control over the band while they were left to scratch their heads. Mason at the time said that they had made another album because, \\"We're not finished with each other yet\\". Yes, the antagonism was running high and Water's said that you could even hear it in his vocals. A pained album in many ways. Gilmore, favoring the less stark Floyd grandeur(as did Mason and Wright), did admit to being fond of 3 tracks on The Final Cut. But, seeing how it was always Roger who favored political themes and the human condition in his lyrics, its no surprise that he wanted to move beyond the early to mid '70's sound that made them so rich. It was an escapist sound, a smoothed-out music that wouldn't have developed that way if it weren't for Syd Barret Floyd psychedelia. Roger had had enough of the 'machine', and although what had come before was certainly viable, he was now concerned with stripping away all unnecessary grandiosity and, like he sings here, \\"Thought I oughta bare my naked feelings. Thought I oughta tear the curtain down.\\" This album's for those not   looking to be taken away(like the mood you normally associate with Floyd)but for those looking to be taken aside, and willing to examine the inside. This is, for all intents and purposes, a Roger Water's solo album in all but name, as they say. To illustrate Roger's conceptual continuity approach, play side 2 of Roger's Hitch Hiking album(which immediately followed The Final Cut)as soon as the final track('Two Suns In The Sunset')is over. Side 2 of The Pros And Cons Of Hitch Hiking begins with track 7 and even includes the theme of 'The Fletcher Memorial Home' from The Final Cut and, still in the same track(from Hitch Hiking), we indeed have proof that the \\"holocaust to come\\" that robs the driver of his life and kids in 'Two Suns In The Sunset' was a projection of his own fears. If you want \\"real\\", try listening back to back to Final Cut, On The Beach(Neil Young), Plastic Ono Band(John Lennon), and Over(Peter Hammill)for a harrowing, raw nerve-ish catharsis. Of course, there's the sequence of The Wall, The Final Cut, and track 7 on up from The Pros And Cons...try 'em both. If you've read this far, then I think you'll know where I'm coming from when I say The Final Cut is indeed the deepest. So deep, it cuts to the bone. Listen and the reason for the title ought to be quite clear. And no, this wasn't going to be a film. It already is, album-wise. Special mention: 'The Gunner's Dream and the title track. I think they would've made Lennon proud. Of special interest(or not), Rolling Stone gave this album 5 out of 5 stars, wiith the declarations \\"a superlative achievement\\"...\\"rock art's crowning masterpiece\\"...a life-loving hatred so bracing and brilliantly sustained\\". This ain't the moon, its the other side of the wall.
B000067G3C|5.0|This movie is a classic and everybody should see it. Sandra's part in the movie is very stupid. But alot of the stuff blows up. So that makes it to a good movie. I think Keanu could do better than Sandra. But that's okay the movie still rocked. It's the best Action Movie next to DIE HARD.
B000003S0I|3.0|I'm on my second listening of this cd today. I purchased it a little while ago and I seldom listen to a disc 2 times in one day but I thought I would give it another chance. LTIA Part 1 is just too long and completly different from <BR>Part 2! I really didn't think this cd could compare to In The Court of The Crimson King but I thought it might be close. NOPE!! Parts of the disc are really good but parts are also really bad. I had a choice of this or a few other Crimson CD's to choose from but I thought this would be the best because the others had Belew on vocals and I'm not crazy about a Byrne soundalike. Next time i'll get Posidion(their 2nd CD) I like Lake's vocals just a little better than Wetton's. Maybe i'll change my rating after a few more playing's. Their just seems to me that there's a lot of wasted noise on here that could have been put to better use. The first 2 minutes of Exile are really wasted!! Wetton is very talented on bass and his vocals are nice The second half of the disc is much better than the first half with Fripp soloing quite a bit. One thing I miss is the small use of the mellotron on this. Easy Money displays it some but the rest don't feature it too much. The percussion on this disc is so wild and sometimes useless. Bill Bruford would probably be quite enough without Jamie Muir.(Notice Muir was only around For this Disc) The Talking Drum is now playing and Santana would be proud of the progressions of the first 3 or 4 minutes of this!! This song does turn out as one of the better ones on here. The finale LTIA Part 2 closes out the disc on a high note but I'll stick with 3 stars for now.
6305176299|5.0|SPEED WITH KEANU REEVES SANDRA BULLOCK AND DENNIS HOPPER IS A GREAT THRILL RIDE DOES REEVES'S CHARACTER KEEP A BUSLOAD OF PEOPLE FROM BLOWING UP? I'M NOT GOING TO SAY JUST WATCH AND FIND OUT. DENNIS HOPPER IS GREAT TOO AS THE VILLIAN HOW PHSYCHOTIC HE IS JUST WATCH AND SEE YOU'LL SEE WHAT I MEAN. DON'T MISS SPEED OR YOU'LL REGRET IT.
B00006AW2G|4.0|I have all the new Stones remasters and the sound is very good and detailed. The music is great, of course. The problem is there is absolutely no annotating, no new liner notes, no new pictures, nothing to put these early albums in perspective. Abkco could have taken a cue from Rhino's recent Elvis Costello releases to see how a proper reissue campaign is done. But they didn't. A lost opportunity.
6305176299|5.0|Dennis Hopper plays an ideal psychopath. This is a perfect film. The conflict and the relationships among the characters is intense and perfectly acted. I'd recommend this film to strangers.
B00000JPH5|5.0|This movie stills puts a smile on my face. If you're a Muppets fan and a David Bowie fan this is movie is for you! This is a great addition for any movie collection. Especially if you have kids, nieces, nephews, and or grandchildren. I say buy it, buy it now! You'll be glad that you did.
B000067G3C|5.0|I really love this moviebecause of the plot, the acting and the stars. I recommend this movie to everyone. This is my favourite action movie.
B000001A3H|5.0|After the slightly lacklustre 'Wretch', which nevertheless harboured flashes of brilliance, stoner rock progenitors Kyuss undoubtedly found their stride with this remarkable release.<br />Proving they were capable far of far more than resuscitating the archaic stylings and sound of Black Sabbath came naturally here: this album largely kicked off the entire 90's stoner rock scene, and while some testify that this albums follow up, 1994's sprawling classic 'Welcome to Sky Valley' is superior, few records can match this one for sheer power and maturity of delivery.<br />This pummeling quality to their sound is inaugurated in quite spectacular fashion with album opener 'Thumb', a track which slowly builds from the initial strains of atonal resonance into a pleasingly soft guitar melody, before a massive riff, which shortly gives way to a truly outstanding chorus. Straight out of 'Thumb' comes the power chord opening of 'Green machine', which takes a very simple riff and erects a classic songs around it, complete with anthemic chorus and effective backing vocals.<br />The albums instrumental side kicks in with 'Molten Universe', an extremely havy offering which paradoxically seems to represent Kyuss' manifesto and define their sound, despite the absence of lyrics.<br />The consistency of the album continues with '50 Million year Trip' and 'Thong song', the former possesing wonderful lyrics and a beautiful instrumental conclusion, the latter appearing to be a highly humorous parody of the heavy metal sterotype.<br />'Apothecaries weight' and 'catterpillar march' continue the albums instrumental consistency in pleasing fashion (as does '800' and the mellow minute of picking perfection that is 'Capsized' later on) while 'Freedom run', 'Allens wrench' and the incredible 'Writhe' all exhibit Kyuss' excellent songwriting and playing once again.<br />A superb album. Dont needlessly worry over whether to buy this or 'Sky Valley': both are superb and either is an equally good place to start. Just rejoice in the fact that the band made 2 (in fact, 3) undisputedly classic albums.<br />Highly recommended.Just rejoice in the fact that the band made 2 (in fact, 3) undisputedly classic albums.<BR>Highly recommended.

0446608955|1.0|When I bought this book, it was so bad I decided to throw it away.  I do not recommend anybody to read this book except who think that there is such a thing as magic.  Nicholas Sparks, the author, has written other books that are good.  But this is his worst.  I would rather read picture books about Sesame street,than read this disgusting, revolting and dumb book.
B00000K31Q|5.0|FANTASTIC MOVIE!!!! I SAW THIS MOVIE OVER 20 TIMES AND IT'S NOT BORING, AND HEATH LEDGER IS SOOOO HOT ;)
0800141806|5.0|I  find it hard to sit through this movie in it entirety when it's shown on television. It is so raw and heartfelt. (Yes, Tom Hanks and the rest of the cast are THAT good!). Still, I rank this as one of the best films made in the latter part of the 20th century.  Really a must-see for all the reasons that make movies worthwhile.
6305176299|5.0|I thought that the bus scene was way better than the boat scene in Speed 2. Speed 2 is absolutley pitiful. Sandra Bullock did nothing in Speed 2 than what she did in the original picture. The idea of the bus no beeing able to go under fifty miles per hour was absolutley genius. I thought that one time where the bus driver almost passed out he was going to go under fifty.
B000069HKH|5.0|You don't need to be american to love Bruce Springsteen's music. I was 16 when I first listened to The Boss. \\"Darkness on The Edge Of Town\\" was the first lp of Bruce to be relesead on my country, POrtugal. On a trip to Italy, I bought \\"Born To Run\\". On another trip to France, I bought \\"The River\\". Since then, I listen to his music as I listen to a brother talking about our own problems of day a day life. Many of his song have helped me when I'm down: \\"Reason To Believe\\", for instance. Now, listening to \\"The Rising\\", my dreams of another great Bruce Springsteen album are fulfilled. I hope I still can get a ticket to one of his seven european shows. Long Life to The Boss!!!
B00000K31Q|5.0|I love this movie!!! 10 Things has everything you could ever want in a movie. I laughed at different times, I cried when Kat was reading her poem. And I couldn't wait tell the next scene.
B00006DEFA|5.0|Due to Constanza Mozart briefly baring her breasts while Salieri blackmailed her, the MPAA in its infinite and irrational wisdom changed the original rating of Amadeus from PG to \\"R\\".<br />This action makes absolutely no sense for in the treatment of this wonderful acted film.  This re-rating makes it off limits for high schools to present to students. Yet crude movies with lewd dialogue like \\"Goldmember\\" rejoices in its PG-13 universal access.  This doesn't make any sense!!!!  \\"American Pie\\" had brief nudity and a lot more objectionable verbage along with a lot of other movies aimed at teenagers and even young children. <br />I just don't get this at all.  Would a representative from MPAA please step up and explain your \\"logic\\"????  It would be greatly appreciated.
6305176299|5.0|Speed (1994) is the very best action movie of the 90s. It set a school for new action-films. As with old traditional fairytale- rules; the 3-times-must-happen rule is used here: First the elvator, then the bus and finally the subway scene. Although I think the subway scene goes over the top and is unnecessary, it is maybe the BEST action film yet produced. T H E CLASSIC.
B000069AUI|5.0|After winning one Grammy award (Best Alternative Music Album), two Brit awards (Best Group and Best Album), two VH1 awards (Best Kept Secret and \\"Big in Japan\\") and selling 1.2 million copies of their debut album Parachutes, Coldplay would have to do something miraculous to overcome the sophomore slump.  With their newest release A Rush of Blood to the Head, they show the world that they aren't going down without a fight.  When the album opens, with the heavy and resounding drums and guitars of \\"Politik\\", you notice the change that has occurred between albums.  Coldplay abandons much of the love and loss theme that was prevalent in their early work and its place is a slightly more joyful and upbeat sound.  The radio single \\"In My Place\\" follows this with equal strength, as does the entire album.  Not one ounce of energy is lost as the album takes you on its spiraling journey through the mind of a musical genius.  In a pop-culture music scene that is dominated by artists like Nelly, Eminem, and Linkin Park, a rock record emerges that gives hope to those of us who long for more.  The standout track is definitely \\"Scientist\\", where Chris sings in earnest, \\"Nobody said it was easy, No one ever said it would be this hard.\\"  The raw emotion that he puts into his music gives Coldplay that unique edge over most musicians in the genre.  My only complaint about this album is the tendency of some songs to sound similar.  However, with the caliber of songs that are on this record, monotony can sometimes be welcome and even intensify the musical power.  Finally the CD closes with \\"Amsterdam\\", where you are confuident that Chris Martin's vocals and energy have retained their strength and that Coldplay has once again delivered a near-masterpiece.
B00000K31Q|5.0|Julia Stiles carried the torch, leading the way for the rest of the cast to follow! The sexiest scene is when Kat (Stiles) is dancing on top of the piano...she's truly magical... And the movie is very funny.
B000000OR9|5.0|I had this album my senior year in high school.  None of my friends had ever heard of this fabulous band.  One of the darlings stole the album and I have been searching for 11 years to get it back.  John Sykes sang some of the most soulful, sexy lyrics of the time (this from a die-hard Poison fan!!).  The guitar work is other-worldly - damn near demonic.  The amazing bass playing is still unrivaled by anyone today.  Try this album.  There is really no way to put a lable on these guys, their music is totally unique, but fans of Company of Wolves and Badlands will love it.
B00000K31Q|5.0|i loved this movie because i am a sucker for that little hottie (whos name i have  forgotten) what a great voice, sense of humor and true knowledge of the understanding of love...
B000069CWE|1.0|... This album, other than new beats mixed in with the old music, is a complete waste of effort. There are NO NEW SONGS on this album - just half-witted remixes that will leave you yawning and reaching for the 'eject' button. While the songs in this may be slightly interesting if you have never heard the original album before, I would without a doubt advise you do skip purchasing this cd and go buy a coaster that is a little more affordable.
B00000K31Q|5.0|The movie was very romantic. The jokes were funny and it was great all around. It was a perfect retelling of &quot;Taiming of the Shrew&quot;. It was real to lofe. It is a really good date movie. I recommend it to everyone, who loves romantic and funny movies.
B00003CXRM|4.0|I just saw this movie for the first time. The music is, of course, one of the centerpieces of the movie, and it is incredible. If you love bluegrass and folk music, you will not be dissatisfied with the supply in this movie.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the portrayal of human nature, especially in connection with Christianity. Although the salvation and subsequent baptism of two of the main characters was admittedly quite shallow, the foolishness and hypocrisy of the third character was clearly shown, as in the end he winds up praying for a miracle, receives it, and then attributes it to physical forces apart from God's control. This is certainly a foolish action by the character, but the Coen brothers expressed it as foolishness, for which I am grateful.<br /><br />There are drawbacks, however. Since the movie is based on Homer's epic, the Odyssey, the producers had to insert a scene with the famous Sirens. They are by the water in skimpy, wet clothing, and seduce the three men. I would recommend fast-forwarding through this part. Also various unbiblical assumptions about the family and women are assumed in the actions of some of the characters, but they are really quite laughable, and I think the movie is still worth watching despite them.
B00000K31Q|5.0|As a 30 year old woman and a huge fan of Shakespeare I have only one thing to say about it: I LOVED IT!!! It was faithful to the original, yet fresh and fun. I think is the kind of movie that could get kids interested in old \\"Will\\".
B00005LMBK|2.0|The Gorillaz CD &quot;Gorillaz&quot; is not my personal favorite. Some people seem to like their disturbing lyrics and odd sound vibe. I will admit, there were a few times when I thought to myself, &quot;This could be something.&quot; But then again, there were many times when I paused the cd player to say, &quot;What do people see in them???&quot; More often than never, I paused the cd player to ponder over this. One of my friends loves Gorillaz, and me, being open minded, decided to see what he sees in them. I cannot. My brother liked them, so he had the cd. To listen to this cd, you need an open mind, and plenty of time to stop the cd player and say, &quot;What is appealing about them?&quot; I give this cd 2 stars, and say that I do not understand what IS appealing about the bad lyrics and bad singing. The beats are ok, but I'd rather them be set to another song.
B000008M54|5.0|It seems that everyone that writes a review can recall THE moment when they &quot;discovered&quot; the Waterboys.  Mine was in the winter of 1985 in the basement of pizza bar.  It was just the music video for &quot;The Whole of The Moon&quot; but I remember it as clearly as the day I first heard my future wife's voice outside my window.  It was one of those moments when everything around you stops and all of your senses, all of your imagination is captured by one thing.<br />Then I remember when I thought I had outgrown The Waterboys.  I remember thinking I was no longer interested in the moody, lyrical, depressing 80's alternatives.  I was ready for more improvisation.  More musicianship.  A more human range of feelings.  Then I heard Fisherman's Blues and I realized that I hadn't outgrown them; they were growing up in front of me.  Musically, they were showing me the way.<br />This is unquestionably the best live band I've ever experienced, and it was when they were touring in support of Fisherman's Blues that I first saw them. Back then I was with Phish (remember when they needed a little help loading the van)?  I was with Blues Traveler the night Bill Graham died.  I've remember meeting Carter Beauford (Dave Matthews Band) and Santana and others back in those days. There was Big Head Todd.  There was Greg Brown. There was U2. There was Widespread Panic.  They were all great musicians and great shows.<br />But you must mark my words.  This band tops them.  It is the only band that allows the music to overcome the salesmanship.  The experience transcends the commercial machine.  It is true, human, funny, tragic, folk, rock, blues, improv, and polished showmanship in a single show.<br />I hope you are able to experience it for yourself.
B00006690G|5.0|I HAVE TO ADMIT, AT FIRST I WAS DISAPPOINTED BY THIS CD...LIKE OTHERS I WAS EXPECTING ANOTHER MARSHALL MATHERS CD...BUT THIS WASN'T LIKE THAT.  BUT EMINEMS THING IS  TO NOT MAKE A CARBON COPY OF HIS LAST SONG OR HIS LAST CD, SO IT SHOULDN'T HAVE SURPRISED ME THAT IT WASN'T ANYTHING LIKE THAT.  I MEAN WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT THE \\"SLIM SHADY EP\\" WASN'T ANYTHING LIKE \\"MARSHALL MATHERS LP\\" SO IT SHOULDN'T SHOCK YOU THAT \\"THE EMINEM SHOW\\" ISN'T LIKE MMLP. THE FIRST COUPLE LISTENS OF THIS CD I WASN'T TOO IMPRESSED...BUT WHEN I TOOK THE TIME TO ACTUALLY SIT DOWN AND LISTEN TO THE WHOLE THING (NOT JUST SKIPPING AHEAD TO \\"WITHOUT ME\\") I REALIZED THAT IT WAS A GREAT CD.  I CAN LISTEN TO THE TRACK \\"BUSINESS\\" A MILLION TIMES IN A ROW. AND TO ALL THOSE HATERS GIVING THIS CD ONE STAR BECAUSE THEY ARE COMPARING IT TO HIS OTHER TWO CDS...I THINK THEY NEED TO SIT DOWN AND LISTEN TO THE EMINEM SHOW AGAIN AND APPRECIATE EM'S GROWTH AND IMPROVEMENT ON THIS CD.  AND TO ALL YOU PEOPLE OUT THERE CONTEMPLATING ON WHETHER TO BUY THIS CD OR NOT, I SAY THROW DOWN YOUR [MONEY] AND BUY THIS CD AND GIVE IT A GOOD LISTEN!
