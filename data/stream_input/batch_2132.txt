B003521R6G|5.0|How can you deny the movie Footloose? In a night of watching old dance movies, this one is essential. Bacon is great and Lithgow is pretty awesome (as usual).
B004BEMC6G|5.0|Great movie doesn't end the way you might think. Kept my interest at all times. Highly recommended. Great date night movie
B004JN1CW4|5.0|This is the only series that I have ever read more than once. It keeps me entertained and I really do learn something new every time I read through the series again. James Dashner is an extremely talented writer. I just hope the movie for the maze runner set to come out February 2014, sticks to the book
0061124265|5.0|Great book. Easy read! Coelho is a gifted writer. Read also &#34;The Alchemist&#34; by him also. You will like them both.
086571701X|4.0|This book is well worth the money for a beginner.<br /><br />I bought this book as a beginner guide in order to get a small apartment system up and running and it has been easy to read, easy to follow, and included all the information needed to start my system.<br /><br />I gave it 4/5 stars due to the second chapter which was entirely devoted to global warming and a global food crisis. There are many books on this topic and if I had wanted to read about it I would have bought a different book.<br /><br />Overall it was a good book for beginners covering all pieces of the system and how each piece works.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone thinking about starting aquaponics but would provide a warning about the global warming chapter.
B009CPJHY4|1.0|Slowest most dad boring film I have forced myself to sit through in ages.  Even then only did so under threats from my wife who, in the end, confessed she hated it more than I did.

B00632HWOG|1.0|I have entered two reviews today about your practice of extorting money for services that you are trying to get money from me. In both cases I have brought up cases to explain to me,they are unfair policys, that I feel are important. I did not buy this kindle fire to be taken advantage of.My questions are just and fair to any and all consumers of your product. If I pay my electric bill, I expect to be able to use ALL OF THE ELECTRIC POWER I WILL USE,NOT JUST ONE ITEM THAT USES ELECTRIC POWER.This is a complaint against your practices. If I do not have the use of all of my apps,then I feel that I should have a kindle fire that works correctly with out dunning me to purchase more apps that I should already have to work correctly work without problems trying to use MY KINDLE FIRE. ALLOW ME THE ANSWERS ON LINE,so I and others know what they are up against for their KINDLEFIRE TO WORK WITHOUT ADDING MORE PROGRAMS that they need.<br />Paul S Marrs.  Paulmarrs245@yahoo.com

B004VMVTNU|3.0|For over a year, this has been the best alarm clock app I have used, and is the most used app on my handsets. It has lots of features, is highly customizable, and is very light on resources. However, the most recent build (3.5.6p) features a revolving number interface, which has made this more difficult to use. It the past, I could easily type in a number. Now, the default is scrolling through numbers to set the hour, and then the minutes. If you have to adjust more than a few hours or 10 minutes, this takes more time, more finger motions, more presses, and isn't always accurate (it's easy to skip a number). Using the up and down arrows is more accurate, but may take even longer. You can click on the number to type in, however most of the time it thinks you're trying to scroll the numbers and doesn't register as a click. As such, it generally takes me twice as much time to set the alarm, and I frequently have trouble setting it accurately. While this seems minor, setting times is the main feature, and shouldn't be as frustrating. I've sent feedback to the developers, and I'm optimistic they'll find a way to fix this problem.
B006H5120E|4.0|I thought the 3D didn't add much but should not have been surprised. the movie was not made with it in mind, just added afterwards

B00AF6B22E|5.0|Not only is Washington at the peak of his powers, Zemekis has put together an amazing cinema experience -- highly charged drama, expertly woven with suspense, thrills and humor, a most satisfying cinematic meal, from soup to nuts. I'll be watching this one again and again.

B005LJKEXS|5.0|I needed this for my sons PS3 (When the charge runs out and he wants to continue playing) controller. Does the job, and when compared to another, this is the one to go with. I made the mistake of creating two different orders, and inadvertently ordered a second extension that turned out to be very shoddy. This one is even packaged nicely, but most importantly it is well-priced.
0307744434|3.0|The story of The Night Circus is brilliant. It really is. However the speed to which the book reads is so slow. The author is so wordy that I found myself skipping over entire descriptive paragraphs out of sheer boredom. All of the fluff even made me a bit confused at certain parts. With this aside, the storyline is great and very creative. You will enjoy the book, but you will also just want to get on with it.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This was the best story ever, I loved it!!  I laughed, I cried, I will never forget this book.  All I can say is wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!!!!

B009EEFTMC|5.0|90% of free amazon games are just not that good. This game is original and fresh. Good game. Nice work boys.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This is by far my favorite movie from Studio Ghibli.  This epic tale is full of adventure, beautiful artwork, and a moving story.  It incorporates a lot of more traditional elements of Japanese religion (I am no expert, however), e.g. many forest spirits.<br /><br />One thing I love most about Ghibli movies (especially this one) is the complex world they paint.  &#34;Good&#34; and &#34;evil&#34; are not black and white, heavily divided elements.  Rather, many characters do evil things with good intentions, and sometimes the &#34;good guys&#34; are full of hatred and darkness.  Far from being overly cynical, I think they speak truly of real life, where no one is entirely good or entirely evil.  And at the end of the day, Ghibli always gives a message of hope for redemption and reconciliation.<br /><br />A warning, however: this movie is rated PG-13 for good reason.  I think it would be great for High School and older because of the violence and (primarily) because the plot can be intricate and the messages more mature.  Just because it is a &#34;cartoon&#34; does not mean it's for kids!  This is a must see for anyone who appreciates fantasy, beauty, nature/ecology, or a good epic.
0156027321|5.0|Ive read this book in an english class in college.. I wasnt shocked when the word got out about this book, and a movie was made. As most of the time, the book holds better than the movie...
1451675046|1.0|My biggest complaint about this book is the subtitle \\"How we know what is really true\\".  I eagerly read this book to learn about \\"How\\" we know what is true.  While the book does present a broad survey of scientific theories and models, there is disappointingly little information about \\"how\\" these theories are known to be true.  For example, the discussion of fossils includes nothing about older fossils being deeper in the rock strata.  The discussion of the model of the atom does not mention the classic experiment of shooting electrons at gold leaf.  The chapter on cosmology does, at least, talk about red-shifts of galaxies.<br /><br />The second thing that seemed inconsistent was the presentation of myths at the start of most chapters.  They seemed out of place in a scientific survey book.<br /><br />There is a chapter which discusses the possibility of life elsewhere in the universe.  Given that there is no scientific evidence supporting extraterrestrial life, this chapter is out of place in a book discussing what is \\"really true\\".<br /><br />Finally, and this is mostly an issue of personal taste, I disliked the illustrations. When I read the other reviews, some people really like the illustrations and other people really don't like the illustrations.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I received this yesterday and I absolutely LOVE it~!!  It's exactly as I had hoped.  It fits perfect, looks like an antique book and feels wonderful in your hands!!
B005HSG3TC|3.0|This case is nice and lightweight and doesn't add bulk to the Kindle Fire.  Its simple elastic closing strap is not likely to break any time soon.  The case only holds the Fire in one landscape position, but it holds it there pretty well considering the simple nature of the stand. The power button, micro USB port, speakers and headphone jack are all easily accessible while in this case.<br /><br />We have had the case for two months now and it is showing wear but it is still plenty serviceable.  Although I don't like judging an item solely based on price, price still comes into play in determining if an item is worth it.  In this instance this case would be 5 stars if it was being sold for 15 dollars.  At 20-25 I might consider this a 4 star case.  At the current 35 I can only give it 3 stars.<br /><br />As long as you are looking for a simple, light case for the Kindle Fire (fits 1st and 2nd gen, but not the HD version) with no bells and whistles, this may be the case for you.  However, I would advise you to watch the price for a while before ordering.  I've seen this going for as low as 15 dollars during a lightning deal.

B003UBTX6S|5.0|I love books where in the first book, it's obvious who the main character should like, but the second book makes you question their love, and they always tend to add another character to twist it up. Just like in this book.
B004AQR24W|4.0|I thought it was going to be cheesy but the guys were pretty hot and i like tough guys and action and it kept my interest all the way through.
B009KHCT94|1.0|I bought this movie based on the trailer ... and boy was i disappointed. The trailer is ENTIRELY misleading.<br /><br />This film is SO STUPID it was painfully pitiful. I just came back from reading some of the reviews ... and can only shake my head. I guess the movie is SUPPOSED to be funny, or even perhaps campy ... but misses that intention by a wide margin. I have to be fair--it did have SOME interesting effects. But it was just SO STUPID that i just couldn't get past it. The movie was so PATHETIC that i couldn't even finish it. It only gets a one star rating from me because I can't give it ZERO STARS<br /><br />If STUPID comedy is what you are looking for, fine. But this movie is, by far, THE worst movie that I have EVER seen, bar none. Worse, by a considerable margin, than Red Sonya.<br /><br />And the CONSTANT \\"F%*$ing this\\" and \\"F%*$ing that\\" was more than I could bear. NOT something a responsible adult would let a child watch.<br /><br />Without a doubt, THE worst $12.99 that I have ever spent. I wish i could complain and get my money back. I truly am sorry that I paid for it.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I bought this game a couple of days ago and now it's FREE!!! Lol... It's such a good game that I really don't mind that I paid for it. I recommend this game to anyone that enjoys majong. Great game, great graphics, just plain great. Get it and enjoy hours of fun. &lt;3

B008XBCJ34|5.0|This is the most beautiful movie I've seen to date. The colors and content are magnificent in 3D. I first saw Avatar at the movies and was blown away by it, so I had to have my own copy. The copy I ordered from Amazon arrived swiftly, much sooner than I expected, and is just as beautiful on my big screen, 3D TV as it was at the theater. This package also came with a regular Blu-ray Disc, which is also beautiful, but personally, I prefer the 3D version. You can't go wrong with the set or the price. It definitely deserves 5 stars.
B000005B0U|4.0|Compared to the soundtrack tot he original Blues Brothers movie, this has more cuts featuring musicians than actors, cuts good enough you can hear them played on Sirius/XM's Bluesville channel.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|the only problem with this game is i dont have enough real money for the extra coins to play with.but the game is really fun.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series is engaging and cerebral.  Each episode is about 50 minutes uninterrupted and always concludes with something to leave you thinking and anticipating the next episode.  The official description is true to word and the acting is impeccable.<br /><br />Occasionally, the quality of the video will drop, but it usually does not last too long.  Purchase is seamless.  No substantial complaints.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It touched my heart and I couldn't stop reading great book recommended by my mother such great description throughout the whole book
B00AJLHUAS|5.0|I've just read a couple of negative reviews because some folks weren't excited about how the recordings sounded dated and flat, especially the vinyl version of this album. Here's another opinion:<br /><br />I'm of the mind that this album sounds great, but then I'm the type of guy who prefers a vintage car restored to all original specifications. When you start modernizing a classic vehicle with a CD player, after-market mag wheels, sparkly paint, etc., it just doesn't do it for me. I'm sure the production style was a choice of Ferry's to purposely disregard all the supreme technology available to him in the studio b/c if that was used this album would have an all completely different vibe. The way it sounds now, I can imagine it playing out of my 1940 Zenith 10-S-470. And that's about as perfect as it gets.
B007Q1VUFA|5.0|Enjoyed it tremendously.  It came quickly and I listen to it often.  Reminds me of 70's dead.  Looks like Phil Lesh rubbed of on Chris...

B0010SEMP0|5.0|This is the second book in the series and I would recomend you read the first book first! Like the first book this is sexy action, sprinkled with a good dose of humor. If you dont take it to serious you'll really enjoy this series! I have read all the books, including the spinoffs and they are all great entertainment. If you want deep, soulful beautiful stories I would give this series a miss. If violent action, feisty dialog and a god love story with some decent sexy bits rocks your boat.. Read this!

1554072840|2.0|If you want your child to think a pitcher or mug is a potty, this book is perfect. (Really. Husband used a pitcher with a handle as a vase... child said, \\"A potty for me!\\") While I like some of the concepts of this book (telling kids where pee and poop come out of), I can't envision ever reading the real text (or a child listening to it), and as some reviewers point out, there is no hand-washing... but I can make up my own story. I can't redraw the \\"potty\\" that looks like a mug or pitcher. (First time we read the book and our child saw the picture of poop in the \\"potty\\"--which looks like a mug--she said, \\"That's silly!\\" Then the episode of her thinking the pitcher is a potty... not working for me!) I do give 2 stars instead of 1 since my child has some (limited) interest in it. \\"A Potty for Me,\\" with lift-the-flap pages and a more modern-looking potty, is not perfect but much more useful for us than this one.

B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I especially liked the other Diary of a Wimpy Kid books, The Last Straw, Dog Days, and The Ugly Truth. I like this book a lot because this is kind of a realistic fiction book and reflects my past. I would definitely recommend this book to my sister Barbara.
B005FITIK0|5.0|This film was shockingly accurate as a character depiction of a severe narcissistic personality disorder. If you've ever read any of the literature on this terrible mental illness or by chance come in contact with an individual who suffers from this disease you will find this film relevant and informative.<br /><br />Charlize Theron has a very good take on Narcissistic Personality Disorder-(NPD). Her films \\"Young Adult\\" and \\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\" are Spot On character studies of persons afflicted with this awful impairment.<br /><br />This film is very educational and informative to students of psychology in it's depiction of a person afflicted with this personality disorder and what their life might be like. It is heart wrenching and shockingly tragic and sad. The emptiness and desperate search for emotion and stimulation is painful to watch.<br /><br />This film shows how Narcissistic Personality Disorder is almost akin to a sort of \\"Living Death\\" and the futile desperation to become alive as other people with families, careers, support groups, loved ones and all the other accouterments acquired from a fulfilling life.<br /><br />Such disordered individuals inspire anger, resentment and hatred to the uninformed. Once one understands the disorder and its tragic dynamics on the sufferers; one cannot have anything but immense pity and sorrow for such an unfortunate individual because their life will never be a happy one. Relationships with persons such as these are doomed to failure!<br /><br />I recommend this film to everybody who wants to learn about NPD. This is NOT a comedy!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love the game I was just getting bugged by the thing asking me to rate it what am I? your father?  lol

B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|Wow! Love, love, love it. I'm an old &#34;Metal Head&#34; at heart, so the fact that these two have become my favorite group would surprise old friends and if the younger me knew, he would probably come kick my rear.<br />What I like most about these two is that they make changes just about every album. They stay creative and avoid stagnation.<br />So far, I think this might be my favorite of their releases. I know it's a pretty drastic change compared to where they started out at, but this one is worth owning. Consider it a must have.

B00BUADSMQ|3.0|I love the Die Hard franchise. I liked this one, but this is one of the weakest in the series, along with Die Hard 2. The movie was too short and felt rushed. Bruce Willis's John McClane character didn't seem like the main star this time. It felt more like Jack's story, but John was just there to help him out, and to try to make this feel like a Die Hard movie. His classic infamous 'Yipee Ki-Yay' scene wasn't done too well. There were some funny one-liners and decent action scenes.<br /><br />Jack McClane is a CIA agent in an undercover operation in Russia. When John hears that he's in trouble, he travels to Russia to help him out. Jack's mission is to protect a political prisoner named Yuri Komarov from Alik and his henchmen. The McClanes must stop them from stealing billions of dollars worth of weapons-grade uranium in Chernobyl. This isn't a horrible movie. I'll be adding it to my Die Hard collection, but it feels very different and unlike the originals. If you're a fan, you might like A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD!!!<br /><br />P.S. Happy Valentine's Day

B000QCS8TW|5.0|The house didn't get cleaned for a week!  Martin's character development is excellent, the plot is rich, and the layout of the book allows for instant involvement in the story line.
B003B17YZE|5.0|And so the final installment in the Jimi Hendrix Experience trilogy delivers with a blastoff into the heavens and beyond. Quite simply a masterpiece. To listen to the three studio albums of the Experience back to back is a musical journey that goes beyond words. Peace
0439023513|2.0|As I had finished The Hunger Games and Catching Fire, I was very eager to read the conclusion of the trilogy. But in my opinion, it totally falls short of expectations. Katniss is really emotional and unproductive, spending most of her time in the hospital whining and whining. There aren't any intensified fights or adventures until at least 70% of the book (I read on kindle) (at this point I gave up tolerating Katniss's squeamish side). There are only fancy outfits, nice camera shots, very short scenes of Katniss doing something courageous but soly for the benefit of making a rebellion propaganda. If what you are looking for in this series is breathtaking adventures, bold fights (like myself) then you should just go on wikipedia and read the summary.<br />I'm sincerely sorry if this review is offensive to anyone.
B000P5FH3K|5.0|How does one rate a movie here ???  The movie is a good one, the shipping was fast.  That's about all I can think of to write here.  No complaints whatsoever.

B00A6D5GBE|5.0|I love guiding moon boy to his bed it is so fun!! It is sorda like eyes my water but not really it's so fun to go through different levels!
B007HACDLK|5.0|great book, i recommend to everyone interested on this kind of story, now i see the reason it's a best seller :)
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I Love that dang book so much it's so good and interesting then the first book this one is awsome
B008PV5G2S|5.0|This Movie had So Many Great Actors/Actress with a Great Story, Love , Hate, Sex, Jealousy, all twisted so well with the utmost Manners , Highly Recomended
B00785P2QC|4.0|its a cool game. its very addicting. I like it a lot. I haven't had any problems with it at all.
B006YG9HJE|5.0|I have been a fan of this series since its inception.<br /><br />Although it sometimes exceeds reality in the abilities of the characters to accomplish some of their undertakings. It is a source of good entertainment.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Pretty darn awesome game! I mean, I liked the first one, but I definitely felt some key aspects were lacking and the graphics also didn't have that much detail. But this changes everything. From the moment you download it, you notice immediately stronger graphics and performance and it makes the game immediately better. There are also other new areas in this game such as ropes and mine carts which make the game even more fun. Worth the download for everybody!
B003TSEEDY|2.0|The book reminds the reader about the years of high school and is very easy to read although a bit repetitive with some suggestions i.e. books and songs.
B006LSZECO|5.0|delivery was fast.  Thank you.  I also think getting right to the point is better than being required to type a required amount of words...
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Interesting to learn more detail about the man who influenced our lives in so many ways, during my own lifetime.
B007CKNX28|5.0|This CD is a tour-de-force. Great songs, great lyrics, perfect production, sensational and inspired guitar playing with hip,cool,uncliched licks. Wow! I would love to meet this guy. I am a musician who basically loathes almost everything I hear today. So much BS and rehashing of stuff. So boring. It takes me five seconds to teach my students their utube favorites. It almost makes me hate music. Yet, Jack White is an inspiration. What a massive talent. Coming from me who is an ultra cynic, believe me that this guitarist/musician is a powerful voice to keep inspired music alive. I am a product of the sixties, and a grouchy old guitar player, but this guy blows me away. He is better than the Beatles all wrapped into one. Very cool and hip. One day I hope to shake his hand.
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|Poorly designed - inserting the battery is an exercise in itself, and in terms of performance? Well, it just doesn't. Dead. Zero output. Even with new battery. It is pretty hard to design a microphone that doesn't actually work (you can use a speaker, earphone or whatever at a pinch) but Audio Technica seem to have proven themselves admirably capable.<br /><br />I tossed the packaging when it was delivered so cannot return it. A complete and utter waste of money. Lesson learned.
B00280LYIC|5.0|5 Stars<br />I loved this book so much because of the amazing quest and doing the capture the flag at night. My favorite part was Percy Jackson and his friends saving the three animals from those guys who work at \\"The act of Kindness\\" company because they were too cruel to the animals. Anyway I love this book and I hope the next book will be fun soon.  -Michael Dinkelman
B005LAIHCW|2.0|How did this film get so many stars? Boring, bad acting and same old tired story. Great for 15 year old kids, maybe. I turned it off after an hour. Just awful.
B00AH8U4OW|3.0|I chose this rating because it was still watchable, but it was the worst season of Caifornication yet. It seemed a lot more predictable than before and it seemed like they ran out of ideas. I would still recommend if for watching for hardcore fans of this series.
B000SEIDR0|5.0|Who knew?  Who paid attention.  How dumb can we be.  The truth revealed by a man who saw what was happening in truth and no, like myself,  believed that Congress's move to screw our food up was a good intention.  Haven't finished it but will....probably read more than once to get it to stick.  Hard to believe our government had nothing better to do.  Its a keeper if only to compare to what is going on now.  Still shaking my head.
B00BAHKQW4|5.0|Installed yesterday and nearly got fired because I ended up playing on the toilet for about three hours. I cannot give a higer recommendation than forgetting to get off the toilet.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I just didn't get it and I'm an artist of sorts.  So, try it.  May be better for you.  Don't know what I expected.  Perhaps I those grand expectations that seem to get me into trouble all of the time.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|The guy went through hell and came out without the inherent bitterness.  He made choices that we would be wise to make today.  History repeats itself if you forget what the history was. Ah, a prophet in me.
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|I loved the tv show and the movie is a nice closure or a series that should have been longer
B0028IDXDS|5.0|whoever invented these are a genious. My son loved them and are so cute. they are way easier to find when droped vs a regular paci. i think i have boughten about ten of them. unfortanatly, my son has grown out of them and has bitten a hole in the paci and no longer can use them. but anyone that has a baby who uses a paci needs to have one of these! you wont regret it, promiss! The monkey was my favorite, but they are all cute.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I'm a big Harry Potter fan and had to order this. It was way cheaper, at the time, then any other place.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent story! What vivid and beautiful imagery. Suzanne Collins, thanks.<br />I'm on the edge of my seat for the next book.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Enjoyed it. Not too hard not to easy :) happy me. Graphics are good enough and story line is not a bore.
B005J9ZDYK|5.0|Loved season one, and had to get season two right away.  Love that there is no dialog in the way, just tones and inflections.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|We have thoroughly enjoyed this series and look forward to seeing season 3, which is on TV now. We were able to get up to date by watching the first two seasons.
1423165691|5.0|One of my classmates brought this book into class because she received it as a Valentine's Day gift. I was so entranced by how the sketches were done in the book because all the sketches were so lively and inspires one to want to draw. There aren't any descriptions or credit on the sketches as mentioned in previous reviews, and it is slightly organized poorly, but to those who are looking for influence to draw and enjoy looking at sketches of some classic Disney characters, then I suggest this book. I was in serious art block, and one look through this book inspired me to start doodling one more to try to capture action like the sketches did. I was willing to pay the $50 for it, but seeing as how Amazon has it for $30, I seriously want to buy it even more now.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This game is really good it is practically grand theft auto on the kindle everywhere you go to have so much freedom it is definitely worth the money if you like gta and you would buy the console version for 20 dollars you should buy it for the kindle.
0891419063|5.0|I had to read this book for a WWII history class and I am so glad I did. It is a wonderful book about a young man in the Marines and he struggles with this inner conflict. Very good book.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|we love this season!!!! couldn't wait to get it on DVD and do not have cable so i love that we can watch it instantly
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I thought the book was hard to follow switching back and forth from reality to &#34;after death&#34; experience. At first the book<br />seemed interesting, but I soon lost interest and never finished reading it! it just didn't seem plausible to me at all.
B009FZFONO|5.0|it could be just my connection but i was very pleased with the streaming. no skips , pauses, or errors. the  only thing that is an issue for me is the hd picture quality for streaming. however i was very pleased to watch this series and would recommend.
B0091LS07E|5.0|Alicia sounds like an angel. Love the music from her.She comes across beautiful even for the older generation. Go girl!
B00005R24G|5.0|The best &#34;Sleuth&#34; ever made with  Olivier & Caine at their best!  A real thriller with a big  surprise ending!
B008TMA1LY|5.0|I can't even open it on my phone, force closes every time so I can't even see what the game is - galaxy s
B0018BB20W|5.0|The Moody Blues &#34;Days of Future Past&#34; is timeless!  It remains one of my favorites of all time! &#34;Nights in White Satin&#34; is beautiful!
1881273156|5.0|I think this book is excellent and necessary reading material for all. Ideas were presented in a clear concise manner. First time I read it was a copy I burrowed from a friend, before I even finished the book I knew I just had to get a copy of my own.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|I'm a big Gillian Flynn fan, and I am glad I read this book. However it's my least favorite of all of her work. I've been more happy with the endings in her other novels- they seemed deeper and more satisfying to me. I would make this at the end of your 'must read' list when you've run out of other options.
B0050PYNO4|5.0|With some references to other sci-fi movies, this one was fun and everything you expect in an alien movie and more.  Lots of comic scenes.  So much fun you'll want to watch it again and again.
B004J64QR4|5.0|If you have no watched this do it, its great, I love ll the songs and the story to it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|very cool game. I love horses and virtual games this combindes both I love it.. esspecially how you can care for them /too.
B001CDD84Y|5.0|Great movie, well done, funny, cool, catching, was a good rainy day movie to brighten the day, would watch it again
0792838068|1.0|This is the worst movie I have seen in a long time and I cannot imagine how it was even coonsidered for any type of mocvies awards. The Nicholas Cage character is awful - very difficult to make any connection with the character whatsoever.  The female lead role is also somone you wont relate to.  Absolutely ridiculous relationship develops with a laughably bad ending. A waste of 2 hours.
B001E75QGG|5.0|5 stars for sure. id ordered a bunch of movies, this one was ordered last. came first, excellent condition, a little nicer than explained. fast shipping, i got what i paid for. couldnt have asked for more.
0307472590|5.0|The book is accessible to an intermediate Spanish student.  Naturally, you will need to look up a word or two, but I actually read 15 pages without looking up anything.  Not because I knew every word, but because I understood more than enough not to want to put the book down for even a microsecond.<br /><br />Because I read a LOT, I purchase books by how many pages I get per dollar.  :-)<br /><br />The book is close to 1,000 pages and delivers on every page.  I can't imagine anyone not loving it!
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Most thought provoking book that I have read in a while.  I would recommend this to my friends, and anyone that is looking for thinking out of the box.
0061724335|5.0|The author says that although the book is written for young readers, he hopes those from 9 to 90 would enjoy reading it.  I certainly believe they would!<br /><br />I read the book because I was learning Spanish and wanted an easy book to start with which could still hold my interest.  Although I'm 65 years old, I certainly wasn't disappointed!!
B0053O89WY|5.0|The Big Bang Theory never disappoints. I don't normally buy TV shows on DVD, but this is one series I actually pre-order every year.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Bought this for my wife as an ebook. She really enjoyed it. She bought all 3 of them and bought them for her mother as well.

1400052181|5.0|This is a very well-written, informative, and overall enjoyable read. Great for the lab rat or science lover out there as it really brings to life the story of Henrietta Lacks and her HeLa cells. And it was more than just science; it was a very human story.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|This was a Heart felt journey that made me root for a happy ending.  Well written and enjoyed reading this book.<br />.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|The Big Bang Theory never disappoints. I don't normally buy TV shows on DVD, but this is one series I actually pre-order every year.
B0058SNI58|5.0|I'll make this simple.  I have flat feet and arthritis in my toes.  These are the only shoes that don't hurt my feet at all.  It's like walking on little pillows all day.  And they are cute enough to wear with suits or casual.  Highly recommend.
B003L77G6A|5.0|The Big Bang Theory never disappoints. I don't normally buy TV shows on DVD, but this is one series I actually pre-order every year.

B001DUDKEY|4.0|I liked it, but I have other favorites, I was a little distracted, so maybe I will watch it again...
1400049628|5.0|Exactly what was ordered.  Very easy to order, clear information and no problems with the order.  Was received on time.
B008WM4U7W|5.0|Completely enjoyed it. IP Man, Yea Man! Fact/Fiction I was a good historical perspective on Wing Chun Kung Fu and its transitional Sifu.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Exactly what was ordered.  Very easy to order, clear information and no problems with the order.  Was received on time.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It kept me interested and never wanted to put it down. The story was referencing yet beautiful, Nicholas sparks does it again.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Exactly what was ordered.  Very easy to order, clear information and no problems with the order.  Was received on time.
B0084AXZK0|3.0|The book is full of imagery, at times far to much.  I wish I would have read the book prior to seeing the movie.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|It's a great book read it.<br />If you're looking for a action packed book this is the book you're looking for.
0684857219|5.0|I'm not 1 much on reading but this book has got me hooked! Probably because I have a new found intrest in body building. I am very pleased with the fantastic illustrations, the history,nutrition guide and exercise routines provided in this awesome book. I highly recommend \\"Pumping Iron\\" the DVD with the 1 and Only Arnold Schwarzenegger!! O and it shipped amazingly fast! Thank you Amazon!!
B009AMAM9S|5.0|I saw the movie and I am in love with this movie, very thoughtful and can solve your current problem by realizing that life goes beyond what you see now.<br />\\"Body dies but energy flows\\"<br />It is just awesome and mind blowing.<br /><br />WoW is right word for this.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|Excellent book!!! Plenty of fantastic illustrations, nutrition facts and exercises. Perfect for a beginner or a seasoned body builder.<br />Thanks Arnold!!!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Great game! Does not take much thought which we all need once in a while! It happens really quick but it sucks you in and before long an hour or so has gone by!
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I love his books but why do they have to be such tear jerkers? My oldest daughter has stage four bone cancer l have been her primary caregiver for months I felt I had to be tough for her not cry well this book brought out the unshed tears I had suppressed all these months.  So I'm grateful I could finally release my anguish.  But he should write more books like Safe Haven that has good endings can't wait to see the movie tomorrow.  Real life has enough heartbreak give us more happy endings.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Awesome Story!! Hated for it to end!! I could almost see a movie playing out in my head for Lifetime. Would highly recommend this book.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I started this book once but stopped when the main character, Amy's diary started as I couldn't stand her. But there was something fascinating in the direction the narration was taking so I picked it up again and couldn't put it down until I was done. And boy, was I wrong about Amy - without giving any spoilers, I sure misjudged her.<br /><br />The very last lines of the book left me uncertain if/where/when it would all end. The overall plot resolution was dark and twisted, somewhat hard to swallow unless you see it as a allegory for how, in many marriages we all start as one thing, what we want others to see us as, then gradually devolve into our true selves or a resemblance to our true selves that changes to accommodate the manipulations of the other partner. We do this to each other - maybe not to the same sociopathic level as here. The concessions we make to maintain the marriage for whatever form of dysfunction we have been raised with or developed as a part of our nature or nurture and are destined to live out in our own pathetic lives.. This story is very very dark, but if you've ever been in a dysfunctional relationship, you'll \\"get\\" it.<br /><br />Some reviewers have mentioned the foul language, but I didn't find it to be unnecessarily offensive. Given the characteristics of especially Amy, her disrespectful, depraved manner of referring to men, women, and sexually related discussion reflects her level of contempt, and is an important element of her \\"voice\\" in the story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game its fun and it keeps me on my toes my biggest chalange is to fianly get to the end and not run intonanything
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Give it a shot, great story with subtle yet undeniable truth.  An experience that science doesn't want to accept and cannot explain.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is a wonderful, heart-warming, and entertaining movie.  I found the acting to be very good.  Ditto for the production quality.  It also has some very good humor in it.<br /><br />Some of the negative reviews here are simply unbelievable.  One person wrote that Courageous has nothing to do with fatherhood.  Say what?  Two of the main characters in the film are men who learn to be better fathers, and a good chunk of the movie is about how they learn to do that.  Someone else implied that only practicing Christians can or will enjoy this movie.  Such a comment says more about the mindset behind the review than it does about the movie.<br /><br />As one reads the negative reviews, one gets the sense that they come from a secular/anti-religious perspective and that they would bash the movie no matter what, no matter how good it happened to be.<br /><br />I've seen some B-quality-and-below Christian movies.  This is definitely NOT one of them.  No way.  As mentioned, the acting is very good, as is the production quality.<br /><br />For what it's worth, both of my teen foster sons, neither of whom is religious, liked the movie.  One of them saw it in the theater and thought it was good.  In fact, when we bought the DVD, he watched it a couple more times.  I was pleasantly surprised.  My other teen foster son, who is thoroughly secular, enjoyed the movie and in fact watched the DVD several times.  He was willing to \\"tolerate\\" the \\"religious\\" parts of the movie because he found the rest of the film entertaining.  And, by the way, the religious segments of the film are maybe 20% of the movie, and the rest is a mix of drama, comedy, and action--and even a tiny bit of romance.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|WOW! She has done it again, kept me on my toes. The heartbreak of this story is life altering. The love in this story is worth being first. GREAT READ!
B00846REIS|5.0|Liked it a lot. Good story line. Very good book. Loved it. Can't wait to read the next one. I like it
B001N1DPDE|4.0|This knife is a work of beauty, I love everything about it! It is heavy and seems indestructible, it has a quarter inch spine! With all that praise it sucks to say that the sheath is horrible. The blade part is made of kydex and is okay, it dulls the knife a little but not too big of a deal. The upper belt attachment part is the problem. It is made of real flimsy nylon and it make it a pain to pull the knife out and then when it is out the sheath gets real floppy and when you put it back in if you don't fasten the keeper around the handle the whole thing flops over and hangs sideways. I plan to find some way to modify the sheath to fix the problems and make this wonderful knife something that I can carry on the trail.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|They're great!!!! Another great collection as well.  Too bad they left off &#34;Tell Me&#34; and &#34;Mothers Little Helper&#34; from this 3 CD set.<br />Still a great collection. I would highly recommend it.
B00846F1YW|3.0|This game would be fine except there is so much conversing between the characters...blah, blah, blah. Yes, you can just click through it but why was the game designed to have all that? A simple, \\"hmm, what's in ths room?\\" Pop up and then (more challenging) games would have sufficed. I personally don't aporeciate the chinese and native american \\"meditation\\" techniques alluded to in the game, but again, you can just click right through them and it's not as troublesome.
B0090X4GLW|3.0|Loved the movie and wanted the cd for the fun songs, but the songs were not the same. The cd has different versions of the songs than in the movie, it was disappointing.
B001NAT05W|5.0|I think Halle Berry is really pretty & a great actress, I'll watch anything she plays in & agree that the movie is great.
0201633612|4.0|This book contains all of the standard software design patterns. The examples are good but can be vague at times. Otherwise, this book is a must have for software developers!
0783226845|5.0|I seen it several times n my life , but I wanted 2 make apart of my movie collection; so I did.
B0060ZJ7BC|3.0|Was sort of dark through out the movie, baseball movies should be bright sunshine, green grass, and blue sky. It was emotional when Billy rallied and interacted with the team near the end. It's not as good as Bull Durham or Field Of Dreams or Rookie Of The Year.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|The book kept me interested the whole time and put life in a new perspective to cherish what you have.
0785152458|3.0|The sequel to Kick-Ass feels a bit boring. It ain't as fresh as the first opus... Should rather wait for the movie!
B003ASLJK4|5.0|One of the best love story's yet and so true to what happens in life. Had watched it before wanted to own it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wow. I really liked this book. There were so many twists and turns to really keep you reading to find out how this crazy at times story ended. I totally recommend this book.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|This thing is the center piece to my movie collection. I love it, love the show and love that I found this here!
B009EJSQ3G|5.0|The remastering of the music and unreleased videos are fantastic and more of what we've come to expect from the Deluxe collection. Although ABBA were still finding their music groove, there are plenty of defining moments which can only be described as the unique ABBA sound. Mamma Mia, SOS, I do I do I do were all huge and deservedly so, however other gems like Tropical Loveland, Hey hey Helen, and the much underrated I've Been Waiting for You are too classics. The fade out to the later is pure ABBA with stunning harmonies and a haunting melody.<br /><br />And don't forget the gorgeous photos back and front....ABBA clearly had aspirations. A must purchase for all fans of pop music.
B000JQU4TW|5.0|Truly one of the greatest written pieces I have had the utmost pleasure to read. Wonderfully descriptive in every way.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I enjoy being able to play chess whenever I feel up to a challenge!  I also appreciate being able to set the game for my skill level.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|This cd has been my commute music to work, from work and during. I have learned every verse and ad lib on this album...yea its that good. You won't find a filler track on this album. Great to know talent still exists!
B0011UBDTK|1.0|I purchased this as a Christmas gift and now finding out from person I bought them for that ALL dvds skip...past time to return.  EXTREMELY UNHAPPY CUSTOMER.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I was lucky to find this for my granddaughter.  She likes to watch the beast and also to see how belle does tings.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's a fun game that a family or just u will love!!!!  Love YA guys ha ha ha lol lol
B00846F1YW|4.0|Awesome game. I used to play on my ds. I forgot how much I liked it. Glad I found it again.
0060833459|5.0|Don't read this book. I'll look like a genius when I apply the ideas Drucker shares, but only if you remain ignorant. :-)
1451613512|1.0|I stopped reading after chapter 4, \\"The Bomb.\\" I decided I could no longer trust the information he presented in the previous 3 chapters. I was 16 when the bomb was dropped. Oliver Stone wasn't born.<br /><br />Essentially, evaluating the decision to drop it depends solely on opinion not fact.  Stone starts with his preconceived opinion based on a view 60 years after the fact. It boils down to his unsubstantiated view that Japanese would have surrendered just as quickly without it. He offers his view that the Russian threat was more motivational to surrender than the bomb and that had we softened our \\"Unconditional Surrender\\" position, they would have surrendered with or without the Russian threat. He offers no evidence; there is none.<br /><br />All of his moralistic posturing obscures the fact that we were up against a brutal and fanatical enemy. He ignores the fact that Truman - for whose leadership Stone has obvious personal distaste - was the leader of a democratic country and was duty bound to consider the wishes of Americans. He supports his opinion by cherry picking after the fact opinions of some influential people. None of them tried to dissuade Truman. Their opinion doesn't reflect the opinion of the officer or enlisted men under their command, men who faced death daily. Stone, while describing the detailed horror of the victims of the bombing, glosses over the victims of the death march of Bataan and of the sneak attack on December 7. How many of those victims did Stone personally know? He is also very forgiving of the misplaced aggression of survivors of the bombing who kllled POW's. He didn't walk to school daily and see blue stars replaced by gold stars in the windows of neighbors. If Japan had the bomb, does Stone think they would not have used it.<br /><br />If using the bomb saved the life of one member of my family or any of my friends, it was the proper decision. We didn't start the war.

B002N5N4M6|5.0|What can you say except this is one of the funniest shows on TV.  Now I can enjoy it whenever I want to.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Hey, it's Bocelli.  He's got the voice, sings<br />songs you can understand, and is great to listen to.<br />Buy it.
B00AF6MF9I|1.0|Constantly erasing an hour or two of game play, playing this game is like two steps forward one step back. I've been playing for about three weeks, hoping they will fix the issue but nothing. Also I can only visit half my allies, the rest of the time the game fails. If you like to be frustrated, play this game.
B009V3KKXY|5.0|The ideas presented here inspire you to experiment with ideas. I'm surprised how I'm thinking of different ways I can implement these knots. Ans not to forget o mention,it's a stress reliever. Thanks JD. A fan:-)
B000ME5B30|5.0|Great eye opener. I believe it and everyone should do their part. This affects us all.I enjoyed the presentation. I will try to do better by the Earth.
B0063IH60K|4.0|You can just play this game mindlessly for hours!  It is a very fast paced game but so easy to play. Hours of enjoyment.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|That pretty much says it. Great show! Now if only I could come up with thirteen more words somehow. Hmmm...
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game was so awesome i completed it and the extras in one sitting. Well worth the $4.99 for the full game. Hints were very helpful and graphics and story line were great.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Great read about a boys survival at sea. Which is the real story? The story with animals or the story with humans? You be the judge.
B0074VTHKM|3.0|Good story but not really for me.  It's written for a much younger reader.  There isn't much suspense in the story line as all works out in a predictable way.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|This was for my mom and it was exactly what she expected. The typing is a little more difficult because of the screen cover!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As always, John Grisham is a master story-teller and very good writer.  His style is easy to read and the book holds the reader's interest throughout.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved this book because you find yourself rooting for the two to fall in love with each other. You think to yourself 'goodness c'mon.... don't you know she loves you?' Lol! I really loved this book.
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|Read Tom Sawyer as a boy.  It was good, entertaining stuff to read it once again.  Brought back some favourite old memories.
0061478784|5.0|I recommend this book to just about anyone who likes Fantasy, Adventure and just all the good stuff. Originally I did not know it was a book until my friend pointed it out when we watched Howls Moving Castle directed by Hayao Miyazaki from Disney. But the book has a lot more detail like any book that has its own movie. Its fun, exciting and you get to hear more of Sophie's thoughts. I truly recommend it, its good for kids and even adults. And if you have seen the movie and are considering buying the book, DO IT. Totally worth it! :)
B007SGLZP8|5.0|love the kindle books.  I love all of john grisham books.  I have them all but now I am buying them from amazon for the kindle.  does not take up near the room as the hard back books do.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This game was great and then I got the upgrade.  I had 115000 coins and 3 trophies and then I updated stupidest mistake ever.  It erased in all no trophies no coins. NEVER UPDATE!!!!!!!!
B008OOYALE|5.0|Great fun for all ages. My grandkids are always wanting to play with this fun game.<br />They can't believe how cool the dragons are.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|First and foremost, when I saw this in theaters I knew I was going to end up getting this on DVD the second it was released!<br /><br />What more can I say? One of the greatest endings to a franchise trilogy in a long time!
B001OQCV6K|4.0|I had very high hopes this would be at least as good as the first Holmes,but it was a bit to convoluted of a story,to much effort on special effects.
B008OFNWQ2|4.0|If I could give this backpack a 4.5, that's what I would do. I had the previous version of this backpack, and I can tell anyone that has had that one, that this one is basically the same thing, but without the silly flaps that were on the previous version. That alone will be enough for the people that bought the previous verison.<br /><br />It has a nice, very large laptop sleeve that is really just that, a laptop sleeve with a nice amount of padding around it. Roomy enough for my oversized 17 inch laptop and a first generation kindle in the additional tablet sleeve inside of it.<br /><br />Next down from that is a small compartment that I like to keep pencils and pens in, though it could be a nice glasses compartment.<br /><br />Next there is a big main compartment that can hold quite a bit. A bunch of books at the very least. Both that and the next down, smaller compartment have mesh bag type things on the walls that you can zipper closed. I like to keep my calculator in one of them. On the inner wall of the smaller compartment there are a bunch of small sleeves that I dont use, but I could see being useful.<br /><br />The outer vertical zipper is a surprisingly useful compartment. Its shallow to the point where you can't really keep much in it, but I like to use it for chargers or charging cords and whatnot. Things I want quick access to.<br /><br />There are two side pockets that can probably both fit a water bottle in each. They generally go unused for me, but they have been useful when the rest of the backpack is full.<br /><br />The last thing is a somewhat concealed zipper compartment behind the lower back padding on inside wall that would be on your back. That is small and would only really fit a wallet or something like that. Ive never used it, but its probably the safest pocket in the backpack for keeping something safe, other than burying something deep inside. In this area, there is a lot of padding all along the back that makes wearing it very comfortable.<br /><br />There are two straps between the straps that go over your shoulders that lie in the middle of the chest that you can buckle together. Given that the pack itself is fairly big, if there's not much in it or if there's a lot in it, I find these fairly useful in keeping the backpack on my shoulders nicely.<br /><br />Just as a sense of scale. When there's nothing in it, its probably only 4 inches thick, and it stays very straight because of all the padding around the laptop compartment. But when you need to put things in it, it delivers. A list of things I managed to cram into it the last weekend: 17 inch laptop, kindle, ps3 slim, 2 ps3 controllers, gigantic (probably 3x5x9 inch) computer power brick, 2 days worth of clothes, water bottle, power strip, a bunch of cords for stuff, and i think that was it. a bigger laptop might fit more, but most wouldnt get so small with nothing in it.<br /><br />My couple minor complaints are that there should be a tiny bit more padding underneath the laptop compartment. There is some, but I wouldnt want to drop my backpack on the floor with the laptop inside of it (though mine is fairly big and it might not be a problem with a smaller laptop). I would like a slightly bigger tablet sleeve (that I keep my kindle in) but for someone with the newer kindles or a tablet, it would probably be big enough, its just not deep enough for the old tablet with a case on it. I wish the shoulder straps were a little closer together, but that's really just because I'm slightly too small for the backpack; so if you're taller than 5'6\\", you should be fine.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|This is one of the best shows EVER!  The acting is phenomenal and the screenwriting is astounding...definitely NOT for kids though...It sucks you right in from the very beginning and keeps you on the edge of your seat with anticipation...
B007OWRBJK|4.0|Pete pretty much tells his story straightforward and un-flinching in details and his personal take on the dynamics of The Who. Much of the subject matter in the book is pretty much rock history and well known. But, Pete offers his take on  how it all transpired with his unique personal memories and opinion on events that have led he and Roger Daltry to where they are today. Worth the read if you are a Who fan.
B00729GQ0A|4.0|I am a bookie, I sit around waiting for new novels to be released, I stumbled upon this one just in time, tho I wished there was a follow-up, already waiting on me.....so for now, I patiently await the sequel.....
6304708491|5.0|It arrived promptly, and in the fine condition I expected.  I enjoyed it as soon as it arrived.  I highly recommend it to others.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Mr. Sparks did it again...writing a truly moving novel that is very relatable to many people's lives. I couldn't put it down. It kept my attention.

B00821OX98|5.0|Is this possible, anything is possible.  Has a great plot and holds your interest. Once you watch the first season YOU will definitely want to view the next.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Sorry that I did not see this on the big screen because this is an amazing movie.  Daniel Craig is the best Bond (and I love them all), has the best body and is the best actor.  I hope they can wrangle Sam Mendes into directing the next Bond, he is one fine director.  The movie was action filled, had great clever and funny dialogue.  I have not read any of the other reviews, I am sure there are lots of spoilers in them.  Leave at WOW.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Relive the adventure of the past. This is the classic adventure story from days gone by.  Long before there was science fiction there was pirates and swashbuckling on the high seas of the Spanish Main.  Return to the days of yesteryear and search for buried treasure,  try to outwit the likes of Long John Silver as you join Jim Hawkins on Skull Island.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I just got a Kindle Fire and downloaded Solitaire, which is my unwinding tool, and find it a pleasure to use.<br />Yes, there are pop ups, but they're easy to send on their way.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|The blu-ray version is crystal clear, making the animation seem almost like the characters are real. The movie itself is a timeless story that for our family, has become a Christmas movie tradition.
B003MC5N28|5.0|This book brings out the emotion in you. I would recommend this book to anybody over the age of 10.
B004R63MWQ|3.0|This is one of the most visually stunning movies I've seen in recent years. They bring the Grid to life in a really stylized, bold, and distinctive way with the blue/orange colour scheme and minimalist design. It looks superb and makes for some truly memorable action scenes. The soundtrack by Daft Punk is thrilling and complements the action nicely.<br /><br />But I figure they must have spent all the money on the technical side, and not left much to hire decent writers, because the story and characters are mediocre. The main character Sam Flynn can't seem to say anything other than lame one-liners and quips, and he's boring, as well as Jeff Bridges and Olivia Wilde. They just don't have anything interesting to say/do. The best character in my opinion is Rinzler who, ironically, doesn't talk at all.<br /><br />It's a shame as with an even okay script to tie the visuals together this would have ended up being a very good film, but as it stands it's just okay.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is a real good time killer. When you are bored the games are small, fun, and very much addicting. I defiantly would recommend it.
1609611543|5.0|Down at least 15 lbs in last two months doing nothing other than eliminating the wheat. Weight has just slowly slipped away and stays away. Although I'll likely always miss fresh bakery bread, I am not finding it particularly hard to stick to this diet. This book presents a good case for the why and wherefore to the medically trained, some was a bit over my head, but that's just my problem. Extensive research bibliography however for those who need the facts. Got started with this book and recipes in the back. I found the more recent Wheat Belly cookbook had a good introduction that suited me just as well and a wonderful array of recipes. You might consider just getting that if you don't need the in-depth research to convince you. Good luck! If it works for my, it can work for you!
B0078X2LKY|5.0|My girls and I love this book. My grandma used to read it to me and I'm glad I can pass it down.
B002MCJZHS|5.0|Being someone who began as a kid with pop and rock, then moved to extremes like underground glitchcore, it's nice to return to music that's lightly chilled without being boring. It's nice to get a good mix of live and electronic sounds. It's nice to return to something a little catchy without being cheesy. It's nice to come back to a dreamlike place familiar yet new. If you're not looking to bang your head or shake your booty, give this one a listen. You won't be disappointed...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game its so fun 1of my favorite games that I have the best game ever. you should try it

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I LOVE this game! I love having my own virtual horse.I was really excited When I saw it it the app store.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|I like this series mainly since the men and women who were there are being interviewed. At his point in time, the footage is available or has been seen often enough, but the interviews are what makes this series for me.
B000AYEIZY|5.0|I caught the live concert on Netflix and was greatly pleased with Cream's live performance and the sound coming out of my speakers. Cream fans will not be disappointed except for the exclusion of &#34;Brave Ulysses,&#34; &#34;Dancing The Night Away,&#34; and the wah-wah pedal on &#34;White Room.&#34; The highlight for me was the performance of &#34;We're Going Wrong.&#34;<br /><br />The great thing about buying the CD from Amazon was that you could AutoRip the CD immediately upon purchase and then download to iTunes. The onlly thing about this was that &#34;Badge&#34; was not included in the AutoRip but it did come on the CD when I received it.
1847371272|5.0|well written wasn't dissapointed...held my interest all the way through..gave you a since of what Russia is really like during that time..plan on buying the other two in the trilogy.....
B00013RC8O|5.0|Simple movie with small cast but rivetting to watch. Classic car chase from beginning to end. Enjoyed the commentary section by the director as well.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|Item came in time, which is always a plus. The package was totally sealed and complete. Enjoying every minute of this movie.
B00407PNY2|5.0|Has to be the number one classic car chase of all time, and the one that set the standard for all later movies.
B000001EL3|4.0|Though a tad over-produced -- there are too many non-musical sound effects thrown in here -- this band has never sounded better than it does here. Not only does the band sound tight, even precise but the acoustics are crisp and clear, giving the album some real depth.<br /><br />The songs are pretty solid too. The lead-off track Detroit Rock City, the follow-up track King of the Nighttime World and the third, God of Thunder, represent a tough one-two-three punch of rock n'  roll. The latter is probably the quintessential Gene Simmons tune too. Unfortunately though Detroit Rock City has about 90 seconds of sound effects before the song actually kicks in. Why isn't that a separate track?<br /><br />Great Expectations is yet another song that tries to use a children's choir to punch up the tune, while Sweet Pain is an ode to S&M. They are listenable, but not essential. Shout It Out Loud though is a good anthem in the Rock n' Roll All Nite mode though and the syrupy ballad Beth is affecting despite the fact that singer Peter Criss struggles to hit the notes. On second thought maybe it works because of that. It gives the song a certain earnestness and sincerity it wouldn't otherwise have.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|So romantic. Now I get what all the fuss was about Ryan Gosling. This movie has lived up to its reputation,I loved it.
B000001EL7|3.0|This was the 6th studio album they had put out in about 4 years. That's an astounding pace by any standard. So it's not exactly surprising if this isn't one for the ages. Still, this time around the band manages to come up with a few good rockers and one surprise. The title cut is kind of thing that the Spinal Tap guys were probably thinking of when they wrote their songs. Lyrically, it's so goofily macho that it prompts unintentional laughs although instrumentally the track itself really does rock. Hey, its Kiss. Either it works for you or it doesn't.<br /><br />Other highlights include Gene Simmons's Plaster Caster -- a clever ode to some famous groupies -- and Paul singing a surprisingly good cover of the Phil Spector classic And Then He Kissed Me. Aside from gender-switching the lyric, this is played pretty close to original -- and it works.<br /><br />Other songs don't quite work. Simmons's Christine Sixteen and Almost Human aren't bad but never quite take off either. Nor does an attempt to create another Rock n' Roll All Nite-style anthem with Tomorrow and Tonight. Ace Frehley does his first vocal on Shock Me, which is a good song, but the version here is pretty listless.<br /><br />This was the studio album to feature the full line up. It turned out to be the end of an era.
B00003CXWV|5.0|Blow is a top-notch film and pretty emotional as well. All characters perfectly fit and especially Ray Liotta is incredible. I can recommend to everybody.
B007M45PMU|4.0|I bought this album after seeing the band on Saturday Night and hearing Hey Ho repeatedly on the radio.  I am a fan of The Tallest Man on Earth and to me there are some similarities.  The Lumineers are either the leading edge in a new trend in popular music or they will be a flash in the plan.  The simple structure of the music and the sincere lyrics are refreshing in what seems to be a world that has almost completely gone ghetto.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Flynn gets it right and tells a good story in the process. Damn, now I've got to wait for his next one...
B004SUDQ4U|1.0|I have been a huge fan of this movie, and after my VHS tape was ruined, I looked for a replacement. My first attempt was with the  Directors Cut, I didn't appreciate the change in dialouge and the movie seemed to drag on. I recently purchased the 2- Disc Collector's Set. This set contained the Theratical and Director's Cut Version of the movie. When the Theratical version is played it is in German with English Subtitles. There is an option under the Langauge to change the Audio and Video. I set it to play in English with no subtitles. I Hit the Play button and the subtitle were gone, however the audio was still in German. I tried this several times with the same results each time. I found the same problem with the Director's Cut. I don't know if this was just a problem with the Disc Set I received or if it is a common problem with all of the Disc sets. I plan on purchasing it again from another source to see if this was an isolated incident.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Without giving the plot away, Mr. Washington is so good at playing his character that I am a little surprised his role wasn't nominated for any prizes
0937381888|5.0|This is an essential book for new brewers. John is a great guy and a good contributor to home brewing community. Buy it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I think this is a well set up basic calculater. I wish that it had different modes to choose from (scientific etc.) to make it more useful for higher level math classes. This would be awesome for me to have because I may forget my calculater but I never forget my kindle. Since this is well made I'm sure the additional modes would be also. If I had more capabilities it would be the best calculater app available!
B006MW3VC4|5.0|When I stream this series, I cannot get auido from my center channel? Anyone else? (it is NOT an audio problem on my end...) Other things come through fine in 5.1 from Amazon.<br /><br />Other than that--- this series/production is absolutely unbelievably AMAZING.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I enjoy this game because I am a crazy horse lady who is lonely and needs some way to pass time. Also the graphics rock!
B00000J048|4.0|This toy is highly education and is of superb quality.  My son is 3 and he is able to manipulate the pieces without any help.  There are limitations to what this toy can do when compared with the traditional blocks because of its varying sizes, shapes and edges.  However, my son is not fond of blocks, so he is sort of mesmerized by this.<br /><br />Since there are a lot of pieces of different size, I find storage to be a pain.  There are extra pieces of the small white connectors which is good since the toy would be useless without them.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My six year old came home loving this game after spending a weekend with her 12 year old brother, now at family gatherings she and my 60 year old uncle play together. It's not for everyone but there is no age limit to the crowd it attracts. A little educational, a little creative, nothing violent or lewd
B008MM9630|4.0|I like how I dont have to have a lot of friends to play this game!  I can play independently!  it is a lot of fun!  thanks for an easy and fun game!

141659521X|5.0|Ive been a huge Vince Flynn fan for a while. Was not a big fan of his last several books though, esp the last one Kill Shot. But he made a huge comeback with The Last Man. Awesome story, very entertaining. I would put it in my top 3 favorites of the Mitch Rapp series.
B002ZTIIXK|4.0|One of the better K.D. Lang's CD's that she had put out.<br />And of course the two Hallelujah's are simply wonderful.
B00873GRU4|5.0|This took just two days to read which is in record time for me. I loved every page and couldn't put the kindle down. I am always on the search for a novel that gets me totally engrossed in the story and makes me feel like I'm actually there with the characters. This has been definitely one of them. The start plunged me straight into the adventure rather than having to endure a slow paced beginning. The ending felt a little rushed but overall a highly recommended read!!!
B000GFLE86|4.0|Fantastic CD by Madelaine.  She has this mellow voice that is easy to listen to.<br />Excelent when one has gusts in the house.

B009FB3XTA|4.0|I'm not a \\"Twilight\\" hater, but I'm not really a fan, either. Didn't see the movies, and I wouldn't have bought the soundtrack if not for Ellie Goulding's \\"Bittersweet.\\" Still, I gave it a chance; after all, one of the most beautiful pieces of music I've ever heard came off a \\"Pokemon\\" soundtrack. And there was plenty to like here.<br /><br />1. Where I Come From- Great up-beat melody and interesting instrumentals, good (though sparse) lyrics. Unfortunately, the lead singer's high, thin voice detracts from an otherwise great song.<br /><br />2. Bittersweet- I'd be lying if I said I'm not biased, because I'm a straight-up Ellie Goulding fan-girl. However, I'm not the kind of person who has to have every single song by their favorite artist, and I wouldn't have dropped $16 for the CD if I wasn't absolutely smitten with this song. This song has a strong rhythm and melody, and Ellie's voice is auto-tuned into an instrument in the best way. Her voice is otherwise beautiful as always, airy with a husky undertone, and she stays strong even on the high notes. This song is enjoyably angsty, and the lyrics, while not her most original or profound, aren't cliche, either (save for a line or two). This song is all about sound, though, and I've never heard anything else quite like it- haunting, ethereal, but still able to get my blood pumping.<br /><br />3. The Forgotten- Greenday's entry is pretty forgettable melodically, but when it comes to lyrics, it's one of the strongest on the album. It's a poignant meditation on how we should embrace even painful moments while we can. The lyrics avoid becoming emo or pretentious. The lead singer's voice is fine, pleasant, even though he isn't really pushed by the song.<br /><br />4. Fire in the Water- A slow, dark, and haunting song with minimal instrumentation. The lyrics start out strong, but they veer into pretty imagery that doesn't seem to have a whole lot of meaning. That's not really a bad thing, because they achieve the purpose of making the song pretty. Kind of feel like they could have been better, though. But as with \\"Bittersweet,\\" this song is more about sound than lyrics. The lead singer has a beautiful voice, and the echo effects work well for the song. This song has a sort of ritualistic, almost religious feel to it, and makes me think of some kind of candle-lit ceremony.<br /><br />5. Everything and Nothing- Almost ties \\"Bittersweet\\" for my favorite song on the album. The melody, instrumentals, and echoing vocal effects and layering give it a beautifully dreamy feel (the vocals alone aren't remarkable, but appropriate for the song). It has kind of an 80s vibe to it, though I can't think of any particular song it reminds me of. I'm torn when it comes to the lyrics. Some of them have imagery which, like that in \\"Fire in the Water,\\" seems pretty but meaningless. On the other hand, the fantastical imagery contributes to the dreaminess. Also, some of the lyrics, though perhaps confusing darkness for depth, works well, and paints new pictures with old metaphors. It helps that the song seems to be about a more mundane topic than it appears at first listen. This is another one the likes of which I haven't heard before.<br /><br />6. The Antidote- A punk rock song with strong melody and rhythm. Slower verses build up to a faster-paced refrain, and it works. Sparse lyrics, and they're not especially original, but once again, the lyrics aren't really the point. In any case, they're perfect subject matter for the tone of the song. Good vocals, though the singer isn't especially tested.<br /><br />7. Speak Up- Melancholy verses build up to an upbeat, catchy chorus. The song has kind of an up and down motion that I like. Enjoyable melody and beat, and I love the instrumentals and synth. Good lyrics, and the vocals are fine. One of my favorites on the album.<br /><br />8. Heart of Stone- A slow, sad song, just vocals and piano. Some of the lyrics stand above others, but mostly, they're about what you'd expect from a song entitled \\"Heart of Stone.\\" Good melody, and there's a nice change in pace between the verses and the chorus. I've heard more original, but it's still memorable and doesn't remind me of other songs. The singer is good, but her voice doesn't do much for me.<br /><br />9. Cover Your Tracks- I'm not quite sure how to feel about this song. I like the melody, and how the relaxed pace builds to a more vigorous climax. However, though some of the lyrics are better than others, on the whole they're a little on the sentimental/inspirational side for me. I can just imagine hearing this on Youtube set to a slideshow of sunsets, hearts drawn in the sand, and couples holding hands. The singer seems to have a fine voice, but I don't like the throaty way he sings it; sounds like he's trying too hard to come across as sensitive. Definitely not a bad listen, though.<br /><br />10. Ghosts- Another haunting song that has an old, folksy feel to it. Simple, natural instrumentation the vocals contribute to this feel. Some of the lyrics are very good, but a lot of them are hard to make out due to the singer's high pitch. That kind of singing isn't usually my thing, but it works very well in this song.<br /><br />11. All I've Ever Needed- This one is kind of a typical love song and focuses on devotion and deep, deep love. The lyrics are good in places, though it tends a bit toward the cliche side. Good melody and vocals, and the simple instrumentation works for the song. Overall a good listen, not as original as some of the other songs on the CD, but genuine and real.<br /><br />12. New for You- Interesting pacing, and the melody is pretty good. I like how the minor verses build up to a major chorus, sink back into the verse melody, and rise back up into the chorus. A little overly sentimental, and the vocals don't do much for me (think Bruno Mars; in fact, I thought it might actually be him at first). Not much instrumentation, but it works. Not one of my favorites on the CD, but memorable enough.<br /><br />13. A Thousand Years pt. 2- A song about finally-fulfilled longing and bravery in love. Good melody, the piano works, and I like the vocals. Not the most original song I've ever heard, but... kind of a guilty pleasure? Didn't notice any difference between the lyrics from the radio version, though the male vocals are a nice addition.<br /><br />14. Plus Que Ma Prope Vie- Ok score, but I can't really remember much about it. I do remember that it's cohesive, though, and has a definite theme.<br /><br />OVERALL: \\"Breaking Dawn: Part 2\\" offers lots of original, memorable songs. Most of them are haunting and moody, but there are more upbeat tracks and sentimental love songs. Some have a lot of synth and effects (for some reason, several have echoey voice effects), while others are more minimalistic. I would call the overall feel emo, for lack of an equally appropriate but less derisive term. As far as I'm concerned, that's not a bad thing. While there aren't any songs here that I dislike, some are more average and drag down my rating a bit. However, there are some simply outstanding tracks out here that are well worth the price of the CD. Stand-outs include Ellie Goulding's unforgettable \\"Bittersweet,\\" Feist's \\"Fire in the Water,\\" Boom Circuit's \\"Everything and Nothing,\\" POP ETC.'s \\"Speak Up,\\" and James Vincent McMorrow's \\"Ghosts.\\" After this, I'll probably check out the other soundtracks.ou'd expect from a song entitled \\"Heart of Stone.\\" Good melody, and there's a nice change in pace between the verses and the chorus. I've heard more original, but it's still memorable and doesn't remind me of other songs. The singer is good, but her voice doesn't do much for me.<br /><br />9. Cover Your Tracks- I'm not quite sure how to feel about this song. I like the melody, and how the relaxed pace builds to a more vigorous climax. However, though some of the lyrics are better than others, on the whole they're a little on the sentimental/inspirational side for me. I can just imagine hearing this on Youtube set to a slideshow of sunsets, hearts drawn in the sand, and couples holding hands.

0142001104|1.0|I bought this book on a recommendation from a friend.  I don't think I'm gonna make it through it.  I actually think it's so bad it's almost funny.  The book recommends giving an A to all students and the people in your life.  I don't believe giving all students an A would work for me personally and I've not read any proof that it has worked for the author's students.<br /><br />Here is an example of what's in the book, which may enlighten you as to whether you would like it.  The author's father was fairly absent from her life and she grew up feeling unloved.  She decides to believe that her father would/did love her if he had only taken the time to know her.  She knows that when she was young she was just making up her reality.  Instead of growing up and realizing she really didn't know what her father felt she made up a reality she preferred.  Perhaps you have done this, made up a preferred reality.  I know in High School we would say that some guy who paid no attention to us would have preferred to go to a dance with us if he'd only known us.  Now we thought this was a joke, laughing at how we could rationalize reality in our favor.  Why make anything up?  The author could just make peace with the reality of not feeling loved doesn't mean you know what your father felt.  You can make peace with not getting what you want, and not having things the way you want them.  You can even give up wanting things to go the way you want....or you can tell yourself you believe the story you want to tell yourself.  If you are able to tell yourself and believe the story that makes you happy then this is a good book for you.  If you can only look at the author and say how your father felt about you has more to do with him than you, that you don't know how he felt or would of felt and that regardless of what he did/felt, did and didn't do has no bearing on your value on the planet than this isn't the book for you.<br />If you want to read this book I wish I could give you mine.
B00BESLHEA|1.0|Some how I found myself in a theater watching this steaming pile of poo!  I was under the impression that I was going to see a Tarantino film.  What I saw will forever haunt me.  All I can say is Russell Crow's breast! Don't do it!!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Holds your attention and is full of suspense .  Worth reading and worth the price through the kindle.<br />A must
B000UNYJXQ|4.0|I think we all should watch this movie...most of us here don't know how but our medical system is....most other country has very affordable medical or some countries are even free to see a doctor. we pay high tax in the US and still have to pay a lots of money to see a doctor... this has to be change.
B00A2H9LK6|5.0|I think many people will criticize this movie regardless, but I enjoyed it and honestly, I was thankful we even have it. I waited forever for a continuation of the first movie, even though it differs so much from the games. Revelation makes a very decent attempt to pull the movie storyline back towards the actual game storyline. This movie was noticeably not as &#34;big-budget&#34; as the first, but it covered a lot in the short amount of time allotted. I enjoyed the attention to detail, and it was basically done the best it could have possible been.
B007XH6BPG|5.0|This project may take a few spins before you can really appreciate all the creativity that went into it.  Steve Hackett's influence is all over this recording. At first I was expecting more of a 50/50 input of Squire & Hackett.  The more you listen the more apparent Squires contributions shine through.  I would love to see them produce another project together, perhaps with more of Squire's wonderful vocals up front.  I highly recommend you give this recording a try and play it more than once.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|I laughed, I cried, and at times I wanted to close my eyes but couldn't due to the lack of ability to read through my eyelids.  Reminded me of sleeping with the enemy, but was such a good read I didn't mind.

B00APUYN0I|3.0|I don't have much of a sensitive side but I watched this out of an obligation to my wife. I would have preferred to watch Ted again. But somehow actually liked this movie. The music wasn't great, I didn't hurt myself laughing, yet I was engrossed until the very end.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is highly enjoyable people should play this game. My favorite part of the game is when you can treat the horse.
B0065GC0PG|5.0|This is another book I've wanted to read for awhile, but couldn't find the time to get around to it. Now I'm really happy I waited, because the sequel is out and I don't have to wait to read the second book in this absolutely fantastic series! I can just click on over to Amazon, purchase Scarlet, and continue where the first book left me hanging.<br /><br />I didn't have any expectations of Cinder, to be honest. It's one of those books where I was, as always, completely sold on the cover and have wanted to read it because of all the positive reviews it had been receiving. Going into it I was just like, surprise me. And it sure did. The story, as suggested by the title, is a futuristic version of the much-loved fable, Cinderella, but not in the way one would expect. The author used the basis of the story of Cinderella, but cleverly gave it a life of its own.<br /><br />Cinder is a character I liked through and through. She represented everything I want to see in a character. No teenage angst, no drama, no relying on \\"the hot guy\\" to save her, and thank heavens, no tantrums. Seriously, I can't find anything negative to say about her. I also very much liked Prince Kai. Fine, I'll admit I might be a little smitten with him. But only a little, okay? He's a strong character and I genuinely liked how he and Cinder didn't fall into other's arms in the first half of the book. I think one of the reasons I enjoyed this story so much is because the romance is subtle and it slowly builds up, allowing the reader to gradually fall in love the same time both these characters do. I loved that the romance isn't forced in the reader's face and the author doesn't feel it necessary to continually remind the reader how \\"hot\\" Prince Kai is. She remained subtle with her character descriptions and gives the reader freedom to use their own imagination to fill in the blanks.<br /><br />The plot itself was brilliantly done. Though the basis of this story resembles Cinderella, there are so much more to it to not be a carbon copy of this terrific fairy tale. It is rather a combination of a darker retelling of this classic story, and the author's own creation, set in a futuristic setting where androids and hovers are the norm in a world in which a plague is killing millions of people, earth is divided into a handful of nations in the wake of World War IV, and the safety of the human race is threatened by a race of people with supernatural abilities, known as the Lunars.  The world-building was done superbly and although it is set in a futuristic world which we only see in movies, the author wrote it so well, it doesn't feel foreign to the reader. The villains in this book are not only Cinder's stepmom and stepsisters, but also the Lunar queen who is constantly threatening war against earth. The author painted the villains realistically and spent as much time developing these characters as she did with the protagonists.<br /><br />Cinder is a refreshingly unique read that transports the reader to a world where only the wildest of imaginations dare go. There's so much to love about this book, and it is clear the research for topics explored in this story such as genetics, mutations, and bioelectricity, were done thoroughly. After I finished reading Cinder, I couldn't stop thinking about it. If you have this on your to-read list, bump it to the top. If not, go get your copy asap!more to it to not be a carbon copy of this terrific fairy tale.

B00AKOB7CG|5.0|Like that it really is free and there are demonstrations for the workouts. Excellent on my Kindle Fire 7&#34; HD.
B00BAYLRNO|4.0|Though I do agree with the first reviewer that there wasn't enough character development before the tragedy struck, this is still an unforgettable viewing experience.  From the moment the tsunami hits it's painfully obvious that this is not going to be an easy film to sit through.  It's gut wrenching.  Now, I'm a hardcore horror fan before anything else and I can honestly say that there are moments that are extremely brutal and cringe worthy (and for you horror folks you might want to know that the director of The Impossible, J.A. Bayona, also did The Orphanage).  Beyond the brutality, however, is an amazing story based on true events that I will remember for a long time to come.  It's brilliant film making, even with it's flaws.  What it does well, it does exceptionally well.  I've seen almost all of the Oscar films this year (still have Amour and The Sessions to go) and I would put it near the middle of the Best Picture nominees which in my opinion it should be up for. Unfortunately, it only got the nom for Best Actress with a fantastic performance by Naomi Watts.  I can't even imagine the hell she must have been through in making this movie.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray, I'm looking forward to it.  Here are the current confirmed extras.<br /><br />Audio commentary with director J.A. Bayona, writer Sergio G. Sánchez and producer Belén Atienza and María Belón<br />Two featurettes<br />Deleted scenes<br /><br />I was hoping for an in depth making of the film, but it doesn't look like that's going to happen.  I could watch hours on the making of the tsunami scenes alone.<br /><br />All in all, this should definitely be a Blu-ray to look out for.  It's easily one of the best films to be released on the format so far in 2013, and it's a movie that I won't soon forget.

0374531269|5.0|Someone in my book club suggested this book for our next read, and wow, what a choice!  As a privileged oblivious American, it's stories like these that shake my perception of reality and teach me the true definition of suffering.<br /><br />Even though this is a very raw and honest story, it's not a depressing read.  Somehow the writer manages to inject a very hopeful tone, despite his seemingly endless near death experiences.<br /><br />Go ahead, buy it.  You won't regret this purchase.

Do not buy this product or anything from MovieMars, its a waste of time and money.

0425263908|5.0|Wow. Where do I begin with this one? I absolutely loved Christian Grey in 50 Shades of Grey however I can honestly say that Gideon Cross has definitely bumped him down my book hero listing. I was skeptical when I read the blurbs on this series and thought, mmmm, maybe give it a miss. But I kept going back to the blurbs on Amazon and decided to download them. I am so glad that I did. Talk about hot!<br />I was wrapped up in these books from the time I started reading and could not put them down. I forgot about family and work and stayed up so late that I could put matchsticks in my eyes to hold them up.<br />This is one messed up couple however they work together to get their lives in order with a hell of a lot of missteps and hurdles along the way. More than a normal couple but fitting for the story. I was feeling anxious myself just reading about them. It¡¦s not a complete dominant/submissive book but it has the same lines. The book is very raw and at times quite animalistic.<br />Gideon Cross is one super, alpha man with a side of totally dirty. And he is rich and successful also. Who could turn that down? The first question out of his mouth to Eva is enough to sucker punch you into this story. And it just goes from there. To be so devoured by someone like him would turn anyone on!<br />The sex scenes are rich in description and details that will make you blush! I liked the story line also that went with this series. Some might find it not enough and maybe a bit over the top but overall for me I enjoyed the complete package.<br />So I will be forever crushing on Gideon Gross (fantastic name by the way) Now if only I could find my own Gideon I would be in total heaven º
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Can't wait for the next one! He leaves such great cliff hangers. Wish he hadn't killed one of my favorite characters...or did he? :)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great end to the series.  It keeps you intrigued and moves very quickly.  Couldn't put it down, but still has a happy ending.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I loved the first two seasons and looked forward to the third season.  I was not disappointed.  The action is fast moving with all of the twists and turns I have come to expect.  The season ends with a cliff hanger!  So, I know I will download Season 4 as soon as it becomes available.  I gave the product a rating of 5 stars because the writing is great, the acting is superb, and the video quality is excellent.  If you have already viewed the first two seasons, you probably have already downloaded season 3.  If you have not, I recommend that you start with seasons 1 and 2.<br /><br />I have been watching the action on my Kindle Fire.  Although the resolution on the Fire is not as high as on the Kindle Fire HD, it still looks great!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a great game if you want to pass time and the graphics are really good an's I love that you can play against your friends
0399160450|5.0|Tom Clancy does it once again, proving he is the master of the techno-thriller novel. This is a well written and well researched novel. It holds the reader's attention in a compelling manner. Easy to read action novel. A must for all especially historians and political scientists. Of great value to wargamers. Of general interest to the public

0385733577|5.0|I chose this rating because it deserved 5 star rating, there wasn't really anything i disliked about this book. My wonderfull best friend had this book and i started reading it at her house, got to the middle of chapter 1 and put it down and came home a bought it lol seems weird but i would deffinitely recommend to others that are interested in this type of reading.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|Excellent game very imaginative and compelling and addictive to play it is hard to put down especially when my daughter is in, we end up competing at rock paper scissors to see who plays it first
0765325950|3.0|While I have waited rather impatiently for this book, I have to admit that it seriously left way to much unanswered at the end.  I am dissapointed, that there was so much left up in the air, and I seriously wish that Brandon Sanderson should write 1 more to answer ALL the questions that were left unanswered.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I love this book because it is nice to read and I cannot even put it away from my hands. The story brought me into the world full of imagination and fantasy.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Just the right degree of challenge. You can just solve each puzzle or push yourself to be &quot;perfect.&quot; quietly enjoyable.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|addicting so much fun I am in love with this game it is spool realistic and I feellike I am Ianthe game
B0000067L4|5.0|I was talking with someone recently and had mentioned seeing Cream back in the day (I have photos from that concert dating back to the late 60's). That's when I decided to search out some of the old albums on CD. Needless to say, I pleased to have found it.

B0091TGWYE|1.0|It looks nice, but it's totally unfunctional!<br />It's sooo tight, I can't even get my phone out in time to answer a call!!! :(<br /><br />Good idea, but bad execution.
B002JVWR4A|4.0|love the series  The discs were in fine shape  The service was fast and was packaged securely<br />The price was right
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a joy to watch. I'm long past high school, but this movie certainly makes you think back of those times, the insecurities, that first real love... All the actors did great, and the movie is always entertaining. This is another example showing that you don't need explosions and special effects to have a great movie. Very highly recommended, and this has become one of my favorite movies. Thumbs up!
B009AMANBA|2.0|Lincoln (the film) is about as much fun as 8th grade civics (or geometry class if you count the Euclid lecture). Everyone in this film is either a pontificator or a wide-eyed admirer of pontification. Not even Tony Kushner, not even Daniel Day Lewis can make Abe or his stories (or backroom politicking) seem remotely interesting. Everything about the film is as leaden as a civil war toy soldier. Its clear that Spielberg has no idea what to do with real historical figures (other than revere them), but the real problem here is that the story is not an uplifting one, in fact its downright depressing, and so Spielberg's signature sentimentalism is all wrong for this material: what this film effectively shows is that the only way to ratfiy the 13th amendment was with bribes, threats, and trickery, so what is supposed to be a film documenting one of our prouder moments as a nation is actually a film that undermines that history/that notion of ourselves as morally exceptional. That is not Spielberg's fault, he's just relating the story here. What is Spielberg's fault is that he doesn't seem to know what kind of story he is telling nor does he seem to be aware that he is leaving a very important part of that story untold: the part African-Americans played in their own emancipation/liberation. We do not see or hear from any educated African-Americans like Fredrick Douglas. Instead we only see (mostly mute) black soldiers and house slaves and the way Spielberg represents the house slaves/servants would make it seem as though the film was made in another century and for audiences not used to seeing African-American subjects with speaking parts. Its vision of African-Americans is in many ways more problematic than the vision of African-Americans offered up by Tarantino, because at least the director of Django Unchained has never purported to be in the realism game. Still, Lincoln fails for the exact same reason that Django Unchained fails--its a movie more about the director's relation to movie history (and his preferred modes of storytelling/representation) than it is about history, and therefore its a movie incapable of commenting on anything or being about anything or generating intertest in anything outside its directors closed and limited cinematic universe. A great director, a great film, tells us something about the world, but with each Spielberg film and with each Tarantino film we can see that the directors are much more interested in movies (Spielberg is fascinated by 1940's films/aesthetics; Tarantino in 1970's films/aesthetics) than they are in real life, and so the films just come out as branded (and self-referential) products from Spielberg Inc or Tarantino Inc instead of as art objects capable of inspiring feeling and generating thought about the world itself. Both directors have obvious talents, but the limits of those talents are more on display in their latest works than are the merits of those talents. Spielberg is capable of making inspiring work, but here Spielberg is trying to be inspiring with a story that is more complex than his sentimentalizing aesthetic wants to allow.elation to movie history (and his preferred modes of storytelling/representation) than it is about history, and therefore its a movie incapable of commenting on anything or being about anything or generating intertest in anything outside its directors closed and limited cinematic universe.

B0049VZ222|5.0|Well if you have not seen the first season, it is a must buy before watching any other season on DVD or TV.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I do not own many Bluray discs, but all three movies for $28 is an awesome deal for the greatest Batman movies made to date. These discs are of very high quality and the sound is fantastic.
B0010SEMP0|5.0|I love the whole series.<br />For me the charactors come alive and I get sucked into their world<br />with them. Can hardly wait for the next book.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Love this app but cant update. I get an error message everytime. Please fix. Thanks for developing TuneIn its a great app.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think subway surfers is AWESOME. A friend recommended it to me so I tried it! It is a lot like, temple run... a warning too it updates a lot, like one week it's New York themed week it's Rio themed, which is cool and weird... O.o
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a ton of fun! It has several goals to reach both in game goals and personal goals (I.e.&#34;I'll make it further this time!&#34;) So it definitely gives you plenty of reason to keep coming back over and over. So fun!
B008HT4FUW|5.0|love it, even my husband watches it with me :) maggie smith hits it perfectly. i love that it is filmed at the actual castle.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Interesting n very entertaining .  These do leave a bit to the imagination which could appeal to a greater reading world.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This book has changed my life. I am loving myself more, which sounds trite, but is so key to being able to love others and allow myself to have the wonderful, full life I deserve. I am finally allowing time to write and draw, and my relationship with my spouse has shifted in wonderful ways.<br />If you are a doubting Thomas, at least read chapter 16 and 17. I testing those chapters out on my very scientific, linear friend, and she loved them, but she wouldn't read the rest of the book!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|theres a special talent required to appeal to the populace as when they read ,they can relate to the excitements and know that reading is probably the greatest thing .
B00846F1YW|5.0|the game is very addictive. I spent  most of the evening playing the first night. Cannot wait for more tasks to be added.
B007REV4YI|2.0|When you watch this movie as you most likely will based on the hype the key will be based on how you would rate it if it were the first bond film you had ever seen.  People WANT to like this movie based on it being a bond movie, this being a 50th anniversary and a few other nostalgic moments<br />(related to M, Bond's childhood past etc).  After the Dark knight dark movies are the new rave as well but once you see through all that you will then notice one of the most horribly written scripts in recent times.<br /><br />Its not even a question of taste its simple about ordinary passable IQ common sense and whats worse the story is about \\"intelligence\\" operatives.  Consider just a few of the incredible moronic moments of this film -<br /><br />SOME SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br />When a certain villian escapes it is known where he is going.  The people at the location the villian is heading to are informed before he boards a train to get there. high ranking government officials are present so security should be in great supply. The villian takes quite awhile getting there too.  Yet inexplicably they are all surprised by his coming a good many minutes later and he walks right though the front doors with little to no resistance.  Apparently in Bond's World local police are never informed by radio or cannot stop a few armed guys in direct view.<br /><br />want more?<br /><br />A woman sets up a romantic meeting on a boat for a time that SHE KNOWS the boat  will cast off into open waters with the next stop being the one man who will obviously not be amused by her affair and has killed people for less. Worse His henchman run the boat and Theres not the slightest attempt at hiding the romantic meeting either.Suicide by open affair was her wish?<br /><br />one more for the road?<br /><br />A couple escapes to a building from killers  who would now think they are dead but instead of laying low in the dark for protection they light candles in building which is on an open field and in clear sight of where the killers are  and worse one of them is a senior \\"intelligence\\" officer not some idiot amateur. Of course the killers see the light.<br /><br />I could go on for at least three or four more perfectly stupid things that either make no sense in the real world or make no sense for the character (one moment the villian wants to kill everyone at a distance with machine gun fire and the next has to do things up close even at great risk to himself -and within minutes of each other).<br /><br />Bond always has had suspension of belief in action, romance and slick gadgets but this goes way beyond that for no reason of entertainment (the premise is that the villian and Bond are the top two spies going head to head but  you don't get the sense the villian can even fight and they have no fight scene to speak of).  Its all just stupid writing. When you then couple this with the whole movie being driven by basically \\"My adopted Mommy done me wrong\\" character it was probably the worse Bond movie ever made.<br /><br />To all the rave reviewers on amazon and elsewhere.  BE HONEST.  Take away the Bond characters and place this story in another action/suspense film and it would not muster a 3 star rating by most.  Shucks without the Bond name this movie would have lost money at the box office.  Its the power of the whole James Bond franchise that creates these over the top good reviews nothing in the story itself.
B000FCKC4C|2.0|The flow of the story is not organized. I think.the book is intended or the religous mind. Bad for scientific mind. The good thing is the llanguage is simple and the sory is quite short.
B0091V6TF4|3.0|Purchased as gift for Christmas. Classic bond compilation tracks. Great for listening too at home, would not recommend it for the rush hour drive home. :)
B003ZSJ212|5.0|The orignal movies cleaned up great . Now my son is hooked on Star Wars . Sound quality is amazing .
0316067601|4.0|Pro:  Absolutely incredible story of a ture hero and an absolute nightmare of a situation.  Gripping scenes, good technical detail.  Inspirational story of endurance, faith, and both the good and bad things people do in wartime.<br /><br />Con:  If you expect a perfectly written literary masterpiece, adjust your expectations.  This is written by a military professional so get over it if it is not written in &#34;perfect style&#34;.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is the best gave I ever played,  EVER!!!! Ever since I found out about this game I couldn't stop playing it. The horses are all adorible any I love taking care af all of them. I'm alredy on level 11!!! I LOVE it and I defiantly recomened it.

B0091REZMW|5.0|Lots interesting graphics, although some are tough for my old eyes to make out...and I wish the dang diamonds weren't so scarce
B009CF7JDU|4.0|Different from most &#34;teen&#34; movies in that the main character keeps a dialog going with the audience so that you are &#34;part of&#34; the movie. Cultural quotes are still used today from this movie. While Ferris is not a kid I would want my kids to emulate the movie is entertaining and creative. The language used in the movie is the biggest downer and can become distracting as the cursing is a bit much....such is why it has the PG-13 rating.
B007BFSYMS|3.0|I use the Amazonian forest sounds to wake up slowly. It's  pleasant. However, it took me a long time to figure out how to get the program to work properly. It REALLY needs decent instructions. Despite what other reviewers state, there is a way to turn it off. There's  just no obvious way to do it.<br /><br />It also needs a better variety of sounds. Some of the sounds are exactly what I'd use this program to drown out (vacuum cleaner and traffic?).

B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Can be frustrating at times when your prize is near the edge and you have run out of coins - But that is part of the fun.  Just wait a few hours and come back to see more coins have re-generated.  I dont buy coins - too expensive. THIS GAME IS GREAT.  Try the Coin Dozer Seasons game as well.

B00A80SHFM|5.0|This CD is the next best thing to seeing the Movie!!  I guess seeing the Stage play would be right up there too.  This CD gets played at least 4 times a week.
0071752854|5.0|Fricken Awesome. I was the Sales Manager for the largest new home builder in the world and their top salesperson. I can't tell you how much I love this book!  Stop kissing ass and take control of your selling! I highly recommend this book to anyone that has to sell for a living - THAT MEANS YOU! And right after finishing the book, I sent my Notes to two of my closes friends so they could implement them in their own businesses. Make no mistake, this book should be the Bible of Selling!!!
B000NVIGC0|2.0|Bot this on the recommendation of someone I work with and THOUGHT I shared similar music taste with.  Don't get me wrong, it's not HORRIBLE... but it will likely gather a lot of dust on my shelf (I definitely have to be in the mood, or something, before I'll listen to it).
B009D7CP2M|4.0|Somewhat interesting story written through letters to the narrator's husband.  I did not get as drawn in as I thought I would though and even though I found the story disturbing I felt it lacked some sort of believability in terms of the main character.  Not the events mind you, but her reactions, thoughts, seem false.  Perhaps this is the point?
B008YWY0HK|5.0|My kids and I love this movie. Couldn't stop laughing on some parts. A must have for all Disney lovers out there.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I was expecially interested to read this book because Dr. Alexander is a neurosurgeon. His account of his coma is amazing. A great book.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app, it shows you exactly what has used your battery and the time you have left while doing certain things such as music, videos, etc until your battery runs out. Great app to have A+++
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Sucks you in right from the beginning of the book. Easy to fall in love with the characters and their emotional story.
B000OLRH10|4.0|Leonardo Dicaprio is great in this.  The subject matter is heavy but important - I'm glad they made a mainstream movie about it, though it is not completely factually accurate.
0812982622|2.0|This book came highly recommended by a friend so I was curious to read it.  I found the book long, tedious and far from compelling.  It had too much description and it was never clear what the central dilemma was for the main character.  I gave the book two stars because it was an adequate depiction of life from the point of view of a North Korean.  But it was not good story telling.  Very predictable.  The ending was cliche given the main characters' affinity for Casablanca.  This was a book I had to discipline myself to get through so I can discuss it at my book club.  If you don't have to read this book, skip it.  Plenty of better books out there!
0439023491|5.0|I have not read this but I bought it for my 13 year old grandson.  He loves this series so I bought the whole series for him.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is a fun game but not as good as temple run. The only thing that is not good is that you can't tilt your device to get coins.
030758836X|4.0|It took some time getting into this book. I almost put it down but someone at work told me to keep reading because it got better.  And they were right but you really shouldn't have to read a book half way through before it gets your attention.  I wasn't crazy about the way it ended but oh well. All in all, I consider it a pretty good book.  I have recommended it to other people but I warn them to keep reading because the first few chapters are pretty boring.
B006TTC5O0|5.0|Funny, thought-provoking, highly entertaining--the superb performances of James Stewart and Josephine Hull give the plot believability.  A very enjoyable movie!
0240815807|5.0|An an EDM artist with a record label, I thought that this book was going to be terribly academic and geared towards those who have no clue how to start mixing. I was wrong! This book has up'ed my game to a new level because of it's professional approach on HOW to mix music. If you are serious, yet have a bedroom studio BUY THIS BOOK!
B00AATV046|5.0|The excellent cast of characters make this one of the most unforgettable holiday-themed movies.  I'm so glad to have found it on DVD.

B008N9AAQ4|5.0|After seeing this as a rental, I can only say it's a must see. Fantastic... WOW. The 70mm film, 65mm negative conversion to digital is unsurpassed. Incredible.<br /><br />This was purchased and arrived in an undamaged shipping package, yet the Blu-ray case had loose plastic pieces and wouldn't close properly. A return was made with the replacement promptly shipped. It arrived in a padded envelope with loose pieces, again, in the case from the spindle lock. The case closes properly, but the second case is also damaged. Maybe it's the case quality overall.
B000JMKTLO|2.0|I had read Gone Girl and enjoyed it.  This book was not for me....it was disturbing and though I did finish the book I wish I hadn't bought it in the first place.  I thought the ending was far fetched and unbelievable.  I would not recommend to any of my friends.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It's very fun and addicting to play.  I could play it all day!  Like that I could play it on my phone like my computer.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Typically wonderful Sparks!!!  Very happy that I chose this read before seeing the movie, they always change the most important things.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This is great to fall asleep with.  Love the Waves sound the best.  Don't like it to be completely quiet when I go to bed, so this is great.  Nicer sound than the fan I did have on. ;)
B005TTEFRG|5.0|Chock full of action. I think Momoa did a very good job as Conan. I really enjoyed this movie. I say Buy It!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|It has a couple of different slightly different games.  Very addicting and hard to stop playing.  Could play for hours! ;)

0743270754|4.0|This is a very long book.  But the book is a great one.  It is full of information and insight into Lincoln and other people he knew.  For me some parts are a little &#34;too much information&#34;.  But for the most part this is a very good book.  I have not finished reading it as of yet, but I have already learned things that were not in the movie and things I had never heard before about Lincoln and this time frame.  Good Read....

Data transfer to my TC is great, using for Internet versus wifi not as fast? But overall does the job and way better then the USB Ethernet port I first tried. Way better..

B007L6VR6M|5.0|Everyone is entitled to their opinion, of course, and my opinion is that if you think this movie is boring, bland and uninteresting, then so are you.<br /><br />This movie hits it out of the park on so many levels. The characters are quirky and (exceedingly) human and the cinematography is gorgeous and static, letting you enjoy the story and the acting without being distracted by camera tricks. The story and characters speak for themselves. As a period piece, the costuming and set decorating are also spot-on.<br /><br />This is a film I can enjoy over and over again, along with Little Miss Sunshine, O Brother Where Art Thou, The Princess Bride and maybe the first Adams Family movie. Haha.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to owning the DVD combo pack.

B0017O1MIM|5.0|We all know that this is the most beautiful edition of this film ever sold for home viewing. The movie itself is a dream on my 50&#34; high-def TV. But I would like to take this time to take about the impressive packaging for the 50th anniversary edition. Clear plastic slipcover pulls off a white box, pull on fabric ribbon and a slide drawer inside the box comes out and reveals the book on top of the film cell(nicely carded) and the blu-ray case. The photos and description don't really give you a sense of how nice the book is, its not some little squint vision book the size of a DVD its a full 12&#34;x12&#34; a real coffee table book that is meant to be seen and read. Thank you for bringing this magnificent film to blu-ray in a BIG way. When this film is made available on digital memory cards I'll be in line to buy a new copy, but until that happens, this will remain the reining king of all other copies.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I absolutely love the series and must own them for future viewing when winters are long & cold. I would recommend all the series to whomever likes to expand their minds on possibilities of what could happen.
0345803485|5.0|Despite some of the bad reviews, all I can say is stick with it . Books 2 and 3 will tell you the story. You really have to understand the life of Christen Grey - that said, I LOVED the trilogy and hope there are more to come.
B001EN71CW|5.0|love me some Nathan Fillion.  Worst show to be cancelled ever.  I hope sometime adown the line they bring the series back with as much of the original cast as possible or at least another movie.  Must watch for any Sci-Fi junky!!!!

1593272200|5.0|I recently moved into a position requiring the use of a lot of programming using the POSIX standard, which I was rather unfamiliar with.  This provides an expansive coverage of that, as well as other nuances of the general programming environment requiring attention.  While it's not exhaustive, this is enough knowledge to get you off the ground very quickly and still be useful for reference.  A solid knowledge of C is required, but not a whole lot else.

1419701533|5.0|the diary of wimpy kid books are one of my favorite book because the book entertains me and makes me laugh,its also surprizing sometimes.
0553386816|5.0|I honestly did not expect these storys to be this good. Like just about everyone else that have reviewed this book, I like Fish Files the best, because it shows that, no matter how stagnant, and hopeless, and futile a situation you might find your self in, there just might be a very lucrative way out. The private practice attorney in the story has to deal with a low pay, no appreciation, legal practice, and an even worse home life. A very lucrative settlement offer that he keeps completely quiet from EVERYONE turns out to be the way out, and alot of readers can relate to every situation he finds him self in.<br />  Casino is also my second favorite, and undoubtably the most richly detailed of the storys. The main character extacting total revenge on the casino owner who cuckolded him, while at the same time making a ton of money through very deligent and disciplined gambling, makes him somewhat of an everyman, who beats the odds and the system, and who ends winning back his wifes affections, just like an old time movie.<br />  Blood Drive is a Murphy Law type of story, where a well meaning trip to the Big City by some young men who have never, or hardly ever, been there turns out to be terribly disiastrous, but also hilarious to the reader, experience.<br />  Fetching Raymond, and Funny Boy both have similiar themes of a forbidden lifestyle resulting in a tragic death, but the characterization,and hubris, and drama involved in both make almost as compelling as the first two mentioned.<br />  During the course of the telling of each of these storys, some very emotional themes are brought up, that really help to ensure the readers interest throughout, such as marital fidelity, and social climbing, rural poverty, and frustrating upward mobility, native American tribal loyalty, a mother concern for her way ward children, frustrated first love, and shocking violence in the big city, and many others. A rich tapestry is created, and I will probably like to come back to, atleast partially, reread some of these storys again.
0385344333|5.0|While part of me does get upset at Reacher's vagabond lifestyle, I can easily overlook it when I get engrossed in another one of his adventures.  Lee Child writes so well and Reacher is a good guy to admire so much.

0307957837|5.0|This is a trilogy that I couldn't put down. The imagination and creativity are remarkable. The movie does not even come close.  Religion, metaphysics, quantum physics, parallel universes, and fantasy are some of the realms that the author explores. Everything is brought to its proper ending without the feeling that there are &#34;loose ends&#34; but leaving the reader wanting still more. A truly fine achievement. There are, however, a couple of points worth noting. 1. I do not see this as a children's fantasy. I believe it to be too mature for children--the topics are at an adult level and are not presented in a format suited for children. Also, there is a lot of dying, some of it more graphic than a child should read. 2. If you have strong religious beliefs [particularly Catholic], the author is not kind to your belief system. He is a confirmed Atheist. However, if you can look beyond the criticism, you will find a story equal to anything written by Tolkein, Terry Brooks [The Shanara series], and, of course, J.K. Rowling.

B007V5CF5K|5.0|I actually puurchased it by accident, but it turned out to be one of the best hidden object game I have played. Simply couldn't put it down until I was finished.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|They changed the format, and since then it has been almost torture to play.  It was already very hard to win the crown in the tournament (I had been trying for over two years with no success) but at least you felt it was possible.  With the new format, I know I will NEVER win the red jewel I need, because on average I come in 150,000th in the tournament, and you have to be in the top 250.  Buffalo Studios acts like the 'coins' it gives out are real money, and have become more stingy with them.  They are also very unresponsive to questions about their game, like how some of the top winners in the tournament had more points than were mathematically possible........This really used to be my favorite game, but I am starting to hate it.  I hope they change back to how it was before the 'upgrade'.....................    **I will say that in the past week, the tournament has become more like the 'older' version, with more coins in the coin squares, etc.  However, they are still letting way too many people into one room.  But I will upgrade to 3 stars now (from two) because it appears they are trying to make some of it better after their 'upgrade'  ***I continue to think this game gets stinkier and stinkier.  Now you cannot even get good power ups without actually purchasing them with real money.  I have 3500 power ups and none of the 'rare' ones which, when this game was first introduced, never happened.  Also have been on several levels for more than one month and unable to get what I need to complete them without begging 'friends' which is crap.  I understand making it more difficult to finish a level, but over one month is just aggravating, no longer fun.  They have also lowered the coin pay off during the daily tournament.  The whole game is almost a joke now. People who just started playing probably like it....I did...but now I am just frustrated.  I understand that it is a 'free' game, but its not even fun to play for free any more.
B000FCKRDI|4.0|With that blunt comment from the wonderfully named Paisley MacPhee, Sebastian, Lord St. Vincent and Evangeline Jenner were married over the anvil - which sets up the story for the third pairing in the Wallflower series.<br /><br />I'm not sure if my inadvertently starting the series with The Devil in Winter put me at an advantage or disadvantage, by not knowing that Sebastian St. Vincent was the designated villain in the previous book, It Happened One Autumn. To be honest, I wasn't sure what to make of him at the beginning of the story - I was certain I didn't care for the way he initially treated Evie. But from the moment he caught her before she swooned from hunger and helped her down the stairs to his carriage, I sensed he wasn't the care-for-nothing rake he thought he was.<br /><br />My favorite part of the book, though I really did love the whole story, was the trip to Gretna Green and their subsequent marriage after the grueling two day trip in foul weather and freezing temperatures. All the way to Scotland, Sebastian took care of Evie in a way she'd never been cared for before, seeing to her comfort and keeping her warm - more often than not with his own body heat.<br /><br />From the sandwiches and wine in the carriage, to the hot bath waiting for his bride after their \\"anvil wedding\\", Sebastian made the whole ordeal as bearable as he possibly could for her. It was probably the first time in his life he thought about anyone else's comfort other than his own. He needed her hale and hearty, to be sure, so he could marry her and collect her inheritance after her father died. But her stoicism and refusal to complain about the deplorable weather conditions during the trip ended up making quite an impression on him.<br /><br />Then after consummating their marriage much more passionately than he'd expected they would - he'd always believed that \\"virgins were, as a rule, quite dull in bed\\"-the spark of fascination for his wife was lit in Sebastian and throughout the remainder of the story it continued to grow until he finally gave in to his feelings for her.<br /><br />For Evie, she had no idea of the turn her life would take when she insisted on seeing St. Vincent that fateful night to propose marriage. All she did know was she had to get away from her abusive family who wanted the inheritance for themselves by forcing her to marry her cousin, and St. Vincent needed an heiress to restore his family's coffers.<br /><br />So in exchange for the protection of his name and a substantial financial settlement for her own use, she gave him access to the wealth he needed. She had no illusions that their union would be anything more than a marriage of convenience and fully expected he would resume his life as an unrepentant rake once they returned to London.<br /><br />What she didn't expect and quickly came to depend on during the two day exercise in endurance to Scotland, was his consideration of her comfort. He had selfish reasons for doing so, and she knew it, but it didn't stop her from appreciating the care he offered her. It certainly didn't stop her from enjoying the physical passion of their consummation either, as it would be the only intimate contact they would have, by previous agreement.<br /><br />Once they returned to London, though, things didn't exactly go according to either of their plans.<br /><br />Evie fully expected Sebastian to deposit her at her father's club, so she could care for him in his final days. Sebastian fully expected to deposit his wife at her father's club to care for him in his final days, while he went on his merry way and waited for the news that Jenner had passed on. But it seemed the fascination he harbored for his new wife, and a perplexing possessive jealousy kept him with her and it ultimately changed both of their lives.<br /><br />As I am currently on my third reading of The Devil in Winter in less than a month, I can honestly say this is my favorite of the three Wallflower books I've read. Lillian and Daisy's stories fell flat to me after reading Sebastian and Evie's story. They had a deep and palpable chemistry together that I didn't feel in the other books and a current of longing and anticipation threaded throughout their story that I didn't sense with It Happened One Autumn or A Scandal in Spring.<br /><br />Lisa Kleypas seemed to put more care into this book because she was redeeming an irredeemable rake and a man who had kidnapped the heroine in the previous story. In addition, she was pairing him with the shyest of the Wallflowers and at first it might have seemed like a recipe for disaster because no two people were as different as Sebastian St. Vincent and Evangeline Jenner.<br /><br />But as the old saying goes, opposites attract and in the end, these two such opposite characters ended up finding in each other the love of their lives.

B00ATSBIIG|5.0|This app is everything that I had hoped that it would be- challenging, visually elegant, and compelling. The Patchworkz game is full of beautiful imagery, which runs the gamut from still lives to goldfish ponds. The speed challenges were easy in the beginning, but became challenging ... I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a relaxing yet challenging puzzle. I am definetly looking forward to upgrades and expanded puzzle packs!
B000FVNX2Q|4.0|I had to buy one of these for my finance classes. The professor suggested this over the TI business calc so I went with this. It works great, built solid but it is expensive for what it is compared to a graphing calculator. I know they do different things. This also uses a different input method that is foreign to everyone that uses any other calculator. I love math so I found this more interesting than annoying. I would only buy this and use this for finance stuff. It does a great job and once you get the hang of it, its easy. For regular mathematical calculations, I would rather use a cheap TI because you can view your previous calculations and it is easier to use.
1439102430|4.0|I started reading Kathy Reichs a few years ago because I loved the television series, Bones. While the show is connected to the series, the resemblances between the two are minimal. The only similarities Reich's character shares with the T.V. series is the name and the job. The rest is totally different. Personally, I like the book character better.<br /><br />The last two books in the series disappointed me, it kind of felt like Riechs was writing because she felt she had to, not because she was interested in the story telling, but Bones are Forever reads like Reichs older novels. I quite enjoyed it.<br /><br />I found this to be a very quick book to read. I finished it one the first half of the a road trip to Kansas and promptly passed it to my sister who hasn't read any of the books in the series. I found the cases to be interesting, though they involved dead babies which is always sad. The relationships were back to being interesting and woven nicely into the main plot, and the tension was fantastic.<br /><br />Bones are Forever led to a great deal of research and discussing of some Canadian serial killers which kept us entertained for the last half of the drive home.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I like the game itself, it's great if you're a horse lover. I just hate how much it costs to buy the extras.

1741750199|3.0|Garth Nix had a definite and compelling concept that people could wade into the river of death, making critical decisions correctly, least they be swept away. And his concept that some people are more magical than others can be believable. However by \\"Lirael\\" the serious failings in his writing are already becoming apparent. Countless sensual encounters with \\"Charter Magic\\" (never well explained), and \\"Free Magic\\" (ditto). Lots of voodoo mumbo-jumbo about which of seven bells is appropriate for a sorcerer task, when the reader can't tell Christmas from Cleveland on the subject. Lights flashing around, \\"sensations\\", random events, blah-blah. The reader is correct in thinking \\"Sabriel\\" and \\"Lirael\\" could have been among the great teen classics. Bluntly, they aren't, and from his later chapter books, it's clear Nix never really had a shot at it. He was successful because his wife is a publisher. End of story. Today's publishers, struggling against online distribution, are making more profound mistakes than they ever did when assisting literary quality was understood to be the litmus test of a publisher's worth.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have favorites . . . And villians--this is a well-thought-out grand revelation of the time period--and the goings-on downstairs definitely outrank upstairs.

B007KAJG3K|5.0|The sequel to \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" is just as entertaining if not more so than the original. I loved the humor and action in this film. It was shipped fast and in good condition even used.
B00005B6C9|4.0|so this is where the amazing journey of the brothers gibb ends. this album is not only sad to listen to because of the deep heartfelt lyrics but also because it is the end. i honestly couldnt ask for a better album to let the bee gees stop after. i realize that this album lacks a few features that the bee gees were known for like the three part harmony but i think its good that they did something different with their sound this time, it sounds very current with songs like \\"EMBRACE\\" and \\"JUST IN CASE\\" and \\"PROMISE THE EARTH\\". if you havent ever heard the bonus bonus track \\"I WILL BE THERE\\", i strongly recomend you take a look at that.<br /><br />i must say that i think robins voice sounds much better on this album than on a few songs from \\"still waters\\". dont get me wrong i love robins voice.<br /><br />with out a doubt maurice's voice is the most soothing to listen to, i really dont understand why they didnt use him more on solos.<br /><br />the bee gees went out with a bang! i only wish it wasnt due to maurices death that they had to stop, i feel barry will never be able to enjoy the success.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Take a bunch of superheroes and put them all in one film at the same time and what do you get? A billion dollars, that's what. One of the best films I have had the pleasure of viewing.
B000EXZI1E|5.0|ok, really, how are the bee gees not getting air time on this album, \\"PAYING THE PRICE OF LOVE\\" is one of the most exciting songs of their late career by far! i dont care if it wasnt sucessful under the hip hop genre. think about it this way, most of the sucessful hip hop artists who came in during the 90s were outlasted by the bee gees and i think there is a reason for that. to the critics who hate this song, get outta here, u dont know what ur talking about.<br /><br />just had to get that out of the way... this whole album is really very good. it has some of the most variety out of any of their previous albums i mean u got songs like \\"KISS OF LIFE\\" and \\"FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS\\" to songs like \\"PAYING THE PRICE OF LOVE\\" and \\"ANYTHING FOR YOU\\".<br /><br />i dont think theres anything to not like about this album other than what several critics say about it. i probably should buy a few more copys since i will most likely wear it out.
B00AH34AUQ|5.0|I would recommend this song to anyone who likes rock or metal or punk just like I would recommend the entire band of green day. I have listened to this song so  many times. #green day
B0025KVLUQ|2.0|well! honestly i feel that this would have been better if it were just a single of \\"HERE COMES THE SUN\\" its by far the only song worth having. i find it cool that the songs in the middle of the album are connected and lead into each other but there is nothing there worth remembering. i totally feel that songs like \\"MAXWELL'S SILVER HAMMER\\" and \\"OCTOPUS'S GARDEN\\" can both be added to the list of goofy beatles songs. considering the famous album cover which i love, to most beatles fans, this album should come out as a disapointment.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Loved the book and hero's ingenuity.  Distracted by typos, etc., in text but overall if you like hard sf I recommend it.
B0025KVLV0|3.0|now i love the beatles as much as the next guy, but i feel that the majority or their albums have maybe two to three songs worth having the album for, let it be was the same way. id say the three on this one would be \\"ACROSS THE UNIVERSE\\", of course \\"LET IT BE\\", and \\"GET BACK\\". songs like \\"DIG IT\\" and \\"MAGGIE MAE\\" are just on this to fill the album with the exception of the song \\"LET IT BE\\", this album is nothing to boast about....
030758836X|4.0|I was utterly disappointed with the ending of this book.  But on the heels of my disappointment, I was fascinated with a book I had never read until a friend suggested it................The Thirteenth Tale by Diane Setterfield (hope that author name is correct).  Check it out!!
B0041KVXLK|3.0|this is a good one, although i feel like the title song is a little uninteresting, i love what it leads into, \\"A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS\\" is a fun time song, one of Ringo's best. i love \\"LOVELY RITA\\" its sweet and innocent just like the beatles are known to be, i wish music today was innocent like this. \\"WITHIN WITHOUT\\" id say is a little strange but it is really cool, its not radio worthy but its pretty cool, \\"FOR THE BENEFIT OF MR. KITE\\" is just plain wierd, its interesting. i love the album cover, its packed with things to look at, this is a great album, its a classic and always will be remembered as such
B008Y5OW20|5.0|I LOVE the cd. My kind of music. I put the music on when it is chill out time. PERFECT!
B0025KVLTW|4.0|yes yes yes! i like this one quite a bit. there were a lot of odd things on this album, but these odd things are cool, \\"I AM THE WALRUS\\" is possibly one of the coolest songs they have ever come up with. this is another album in which all the songs are worth having.<br /><br />its a good one the cover is a little silly though.
B0049J3QF4|5.0|I never have seen the movie until now and I am glade I did. It was a funny movie. Great.
B000001EYW|5.0|the first thing i said when listening to this album was WOW!!!! this is a lot better than their disco stuff that made them known in the first place. of course it didnt get any air time because the 90s was all about the new punk sound that was hitting the air waves at the time. one of the big things i love about this one is the warm hearted vocals that come with the three brothers harmony. i downloaded each track of this album at various times until i basically had the whole album. (this wasnt really planned). the first one i picked up was \\"MIRACLES HAPPEN\\", this song led me to check out more songs from this album. what can a person say about \\"I SURRENDER\\"? this was incredible! the bee gees could have easily been hip hop artists if they were younger which is what music is all about nowadays, looks and age which has nothing to do with the ability to write and sing, the bee gees are perfect examples of the real deal.<br /><br />although i LOVE robin's voice, i wasnt crazy about his tone on \\"SMOKE AND MIRRORS\\" its one that has to grow on you, and it most certantly did.<br /><br />\\"I WILL\\" is most likely my favorite bee gees song ever, so many of us guys can learn from this song, letting someone you love who doesnt love you go to someone else is probably the hardest thing anyone could ever do.<br /><br />i think its safe to say, if i had my own radio station, this whole album would get air time...
B007FY9ZWI|2.0|This app is getting on my nerves lately because i try to play a song and it says &quot;Sorry , music player doesn't support this video file&quot;. Please fix.

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Good book- love Dean and his passion for life! Sky is so strong through the entire book you just don't know how he manages through it all- the book has you rooting for them from the first encounter!
0316228532|3.0|I'm only into the first few chapters and it's not really grabbing me.  I'm not sure<br />if I'll finish it.
B0001WGIBW|4.0|It was hard to fit them into existing tracks to make a cohesive system.  Too hard for the age group.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|THIS GAME IS FUN AND CAN BE VERY ADDICTIVE. CANT SEEM TO PUT IT DOWN. GREAT GAME FOR ALL AGES.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It was stupid my father bought this for me and I hate it so much it's so stupid I wish this could call people!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|This book grabs you and would not let you sleep. It then forces you to read book two and three...<br /><br />If you like reading a good spy thriller, this one is for you!
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Each chapter only let you into a few spots so it was too easy to figure out where to go next.  If you're looking for a hidden object game only it's fine but if you want more in a game, look for another.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I like all the different free puzzles.  its also nice to be able to choose the number of pieces and if you want to be able to rotate them.
B00992CF6W|3.0|its only for fat losers who don't have a life at all so you guys who play this game can for surely sick it. LOSERS
B009E3EXMU|5.0|The production quality is excellent, the songs are excellent; this band can still make amazing music.  It's surreal to see their &#34;old&#34; selves singing as well as their 40-year-ago selves.
B00A757EFW|5.0|Pac-Man is a great version of the classic arcade game. The only thing is that it is a little slower than the original. But, I don't care. IT'S PAC-MAN!!!!!!!
B002UZ5CHO|5.0|This documentary really opened my eyes to the disgusting things that happen in the food industry.  I am very careful about where I buy my food and what foods I buy.  I think EVERY single American should watch this documentary.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Nothing much to complain about. I enjoy that I can use it on my tablet so I can read books.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|You should play this game and it is good for the young ones and even if you don't have a horse it's like you have one.
B0091REZMW|4.0|this is a great game it's challenging and has enough different elements to keep you interested.  the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it assigns Sooooo many quests at one time and my little perfectionist brain wants to complete them all. there's no way to do that because when you complete one quest more appear. all in all I'd recommend this game to anyone who enjoys hidden object challenges!
B006BXTOFC|5.0|It is a great catchy album.  I love running to it and my husband enjoys listening to it as well.
0060751967|5.0|Just got started on the series and went for all the previous titles.  Enjoyable fun.  I am keeping them in my library.
B003Y5H5AG|4.0|and Neil Patrick Harris - how could it not be enjoyed?  Loved seeing the little blue guys in action again. :-)
B008S80OU2|5.0|The Columbia Albums Collection contains of some of the best intelligent hard rock music of all time.  The box set is an essential addition for both long time and new BOC fans.  For the fans that have been into the band for a while (like me), the results of the re-mastering alone make acquiring the collection a must – a noticeable improvement in the sound quality – especially when playing loud at home or in the car.  The 2 additional discs of rarities and live performances include never released music and concerts produced and recorded during some of BOCs most prolific songwriting years.  For the new fans, the collection provides a clear path to the universe of BOC to explore Buck Dharma’s bench mark setting guitar work, Eric Bloom’s distinctive and un-conventional vocal style and the band’s complex and visionary lyrics.  BOC is truly unique in rock and roll and this collection captures an awesome cross section of their music.
B004SBQAL0|3.0|Great movie with a good story line though it is a bit over the top with some of the scenes and concepts. There are a few parts that SCI FI lovers will see from other movies of the like.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This works very well on my iPhone 4s. It is the first app I use every day. I recommend highly.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Who doesn't love temple run? I mean really. This sequel is so good. They made really good improvements. I find myself playing it all the time. On my kindle and my phone lol! Just get it. You'll find out it was worth it. If your crazy enough to not like it just delete the app. No harm done because it was free!
0140177396|5.0|This item arrived on time and it was just as described! Highly recommended and great to do business with! Thanks.
B004FPE4DK|5.0|Beautiful, haunting layers of melodies and vocals. Similar to Bon Iver, Matthew & the Atlas, and the Middle East. Love all the songs, very happy with the sound quality. Also works as calming background music for working.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Good story line, development, and pace. It's always exciting when Harry \\"turns the corner\\" and goes for the finish. Easy read worth the time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is the best game and so addicting. I love  it. It's even better than temple run and temple 2.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Its very long which gives you much more to look forward to. Best in the series by far. Currntly reading book 4 which is not as good a this one.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Awesome game very creative but it would be cool if they put first-person shooter in there also it's fun game.
B003Q6BQPS|5.0|we had great fun putting this together and then taking it apart after christmas, so that we can reassemble it next year.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I really liked this book. I can't wait to read the next one.<br /><br />I fell in love with the movie and these are proving to be just as good.
B002OSAT7U|3.0|Quality of product was 100%<br /><br />There was about 3 songs I really liked, but the way a deadmau5 album is you listen to it front to back. The experience was great, nice driving music but not really dance worthy like 4x4=12 or &#60;album title goes here&#62;
B002VPE1WK|5.0|i like it. it´s light and looks good, but it doesn´t say &#34;camera bag&#34; all the time which might useful in some situations, lenses and camera and extra equipment fit. as for the tripod, i would have preferred to have the strips on top or on the bottom, so it is balanced out. and a 15 &#34; laptop does not fit in, which would make it perfect for my purposes.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Disappointing.  After reading Harry Potter with my grandson and enjoying them as much as he did this was not what I expected.<br />I think she should stick with  young adults books.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I couldn't put it down. It feels quite balanced. I only wish it would be updated with post mortem information.
0375507256|5.0|I think this book is a masterpiece. I don't normally care for science fiction but that isn't really what this is. It combines intellectual ideas, historical commentary, a deep grasp of literary genres and a style that is SO readable you can't put it down, even when you thought you weren't very interested in reading about how music is composed, or what missionaries were up to.  At times it was funny, at other times moving, and always enthralling. I am so grateful to my sons for getting me to read it.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|short book but a great easy read. interesting and written fairly to the point.I would recommended to people who enjoy his blog especially.
B0055SWM08|5.0|A well designed game that progressively challenges you as you advance levels.  A few neat tricks along the way.  Easy to learn and get hooked to.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is awesome, better than the first temple run. I'd recommend it to anyone. better graphics, BETTER EVERYTHING!!!! ANYONE THAT HASNT PLAYED DOESNT KNOW WHAT THEYRE MISSING OUT ON!!!!!!!!!!
0345803507|5.0|all three of these books were excellent,i recommend them,and I am anxiously waiting to see the movie :) i hope there are more books to come by this author
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|its fun to play but it gets frustrating when you play leave the game and back to find everything you worked on is no longer there. I cant tell you how many times this happened. also the little side missions I do them and don't get credit for it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When I first started reading this book, I have to admit I wasn't pleased... it takes a few pages to get into it. Once at that point, I couldn't wait to see what's going to happen next.<br />Very well written...<br />I gave it 5 stars because I though it was worth it.
1423151054|5.0|i don't leave a lot of reviews, but i have to take a few minutes to tell you what a beautiful collection of books this is.  these nine flip books are each hardbound with a cloth cover and come packaged together in a beautiful cloth box.  they are beautifully made -- for thirty-something bucks, i can't figure out how anyone is making any money here.<br /><br />from other reviews, i see hardcore disney aficionados are disappointed with the drawings.  i've seen the thumper scene before, but not in a flip book.  i loved it.  and it is a welcome addition to my library.<br /><br />each page is beautiful -- like a study of motion.  and i would recommend to this book to anyone who loves to draw.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this the best horse game out there the horses look so real and its free great game for those horse lover's out there u will love it

B008MM9630|5.0|This game is fun and addicting. I thought it was going to be boring and unattractive, but it proved me wrong.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is a good time waster for anyone that likes horses.  Lots of things to do and clean graphics and sound.

0802130208|4.0|The physical material of the book was good but the book itself was not to my liking/ Too much swearing and subjects which I find offensive
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game its fun and addicting never frezes up and its free if u want something fun and time passing to do I would so GET IT!!!!
B000001ELL|5.0|I've been listening to this album for over 20 years and it still has flavor. It's hard, heavy, funky with a little soul and disco seasoned in the mix. Ace finally steps up and takes the lead on the mic, with more leads on this album than Gene! This album also marks the first appearance of the unofficial 5th member of KISS, Anton Fig on drums. Ever song is solid, a true classic.<br /><br />MoPop
B004LROMSO|2.0|On the surface, it seemed like a great idea: an adult retelling of the Arthurian legends, with a cast of great actors, a huge budget and an attempt to deconstruct the familiar stories surrounding King Arthur and his court. But for a number of reasons \\"Camelot\\" didn't deliver.<br /><br />When King Uther dies, a power vacuum opens in his wake, out of which emerge two contenders to the throne: his legitimate daughter Morgan, who was taken from her home after her mother's death and sent to a convent, and his bastard son Arthur, conceived before marriage on Uther's second wife Igraine and fostered out in secret to a humble peasant family.<br /><br />Both of them have a claim to the kingdom, but extreme sibling rivalry ensues when Morgan decides the crown is hers alone. In Arthur's corner is the sorcerer Merlin, a manipulative trickster who has a number of ploys designed to strengthen Arthur's reputation among the people, though they're constantly hindered by Arthur himself, who often seems more interested in pursuing ladies than ruling a kingdom. On Morgan's side is her own wit, cunning and ever-growing magical powers. As she moves from one scheme to the next in her attempt to displace her brother, she calls upon darker and more dangerous magic in order to consolidate her claim to the throne - magic which takes its toll on her.<br /><br />It all seems a brilliant set-up, in which the writers propose to deconstruct the ideals that we associate with Arthurian legend and put a fresh spin on the well-known story. The show not only demythologizing elements such as the Sword in the Stone, the Lady of the Lake and the Round Table, but also tears apart the heroic image we have of so many iconic characters. This unfortunately, is where it goes wrong.<br /><br />In their attempt to play around with the archetypal notion we have of King Arthur, they end up characterizing him as a whiny, horny, gormless, deceitful creep - whilst still expecting us to root for him as the show's protagonist. His very first scene portrays him having sex with his brother's girlfriend in broad daylight in an open field (and being completely unrepentant about it afterwards) and later on he sets his sights on the fianc&eacute;e (then wife) of his most loyal knight. He trusts the wrong people, he makes dumb decisions, he throws temper tantrums, and at all times he seems completely over his head.<br /><br />Meanwhile Morgan, despite several questionable moral shortcomings, actually seems more suited to ruling than her brother - she's certainly more invested in the crown, eager to win the people's approval and aware of the responsibility of ruling. Watching her wiles and manipulations are perhaps the most enjoyable part of the entire show, helped along by the relish and charisma with which Eva Green plays her part.<br /><br />The writers decide to invert the famous Arthurian love triangle by having Guinevere married to a knight called Leontes and portray Arthur as the interloper. Not a bad idea, but it's handled terribly. The show would have us believe that Arthur and Guinevere yearn for each other with a passion that cannot possibly be denied - even though their interaction consists of two short conversations and a dream. They then have sex in a cave on the very morning that Guinevere is to be married to another man, and after she goes through with the wedding, Arthur pushes her up against a wall and demands to know whether her new husband is better in bed than he is. Wow, how romantic. What woman wouldn't fall for a guy like that?<br /><br />Now, a protagonist doesn't always have to be likeable - heck, sometimes they can be downright villainous. But to characterize Arthur in this way whilst still expecting the audience to buy him as a sympathetic hero just doesn't work, and despite the inordinate amount of time spent on it, his \\"great love\\" for Guinevere is about as deep as a paddling pool. You've heard of the saying \\"show, don't tell\\", right? Well, this show hasn't.<br /><br />Though the production values are high, and everything looks very sleek and glossy, the scripts leave a lot to be desired, with plot holes galore (Morgan kills her father by poisoning a communal bowl - so how come no one else died? And how could she be sure he would eat from it? That's in just the first five minutes of the very first episode) and plenty of clich&eacute;d and/or banal dialogue. When Arthur expresses his misgivings to Merlin, asking: \\"What if they don't accept me?\\" Merlin's reply is: \\"They must.\\" Wow, that's helpful. Later, Arthur says much the same thing to Leontes, and is told: \\"Trust your instincts.\\" \\"What if I don't have the instincts of a king?\\" \\"Perhaps you do and you just don't know it.\\" Great advice.<br /><br />Likewise, there is a clumsy attempt to blend gritty realism with contemporary values, which means that alongside gory fight scenes and explicit sex scenes, we have Guinevere spouting modern rhetoric, such as: \\"I'm not sure what love means,\\" and Arthur declaring that his kingdom stands for nebulous concepts such as \\"freedom for all\\" and that \\"no one belongs to anyone\\", principals which would have been incomprehensible to people in the Middle Ages, and which to sound trite to contemporary ears. The show could have picked one or the other, but having the characters pay lip-service to modern ideals whilst getting up to some extremely sordid behavior results in a completely garbled tone. We end up with a show as anachronistic as [[ASIN:B003TY2SUO Robin Hood]] or [[ASIN:B001LF347E Merlin]], but without the tongue-in-cheek winks to the audience. Camelot wants to be taken seriously, whilst simultaneously being remarkably silly.<br /><br />(And for the record, throwing in a few gratuitous sex and nude scenes doesn't make a show more mature, darker, or richer. In this case, it has quite the opposite effect: of people trying too hard to seem grown-up. Some of the shots are downright funny, such as Guinevere rising from the ocean in a sheer wet dress, revolving slowly so the camera can get a good look at her backside *and* her breasts).<br /><br />The episodes just sort of meander along without any real sense of forward momentum (some of the more pointless subplots include the knights bringing books from a hidden library back to Camelot, Guinevere going to visit her dying father, and Leontes/Morgan having some sort of weird encounter with a magical wolf in the forest that is never explained) and by the end of the series we're left with a cliff-hanger that will never be resolved thanks to the show's imminent cancellation.<br /><br />There are some good performances here and there - the aforementioned Eva Green as Morgan, and Joseph Fiennes who hams it up as Merlin. Peter Mooney is an appealing Kay (you'll be left wondering why *he* wasn't crowned king instead of his brother) and several original characters such as Sybil the mysterious nun and Bridget the sensible handmaiden have intriguing dynamics with main characters that should have been fleshed-out better. I was initially intrigued by the presence of Claire Forlaini as Arthur's mother Igraine considering almost all versions of Arthurian legend have her die in childbirth - but these writers don't bother to explore her relationship with her long-lost son at all.<br /><br />In short, it was a good idea that simply wasn't executed properly. The wrong characters are unlikeable, the dialogue doesn't sound natural, the plot doesn't go anywhere until the last two episodes, Arthur and Guinevere look (and sound) far too modern, and much of the stuff that happens simply doesn't make sense. Despite the liberal ideals that the show espouses, the women are ogled by the cameras in the sleaziest way possible, and Arthur's single black knight is naturally the first to be killed off in battle (and nobody even bothers to take his body back to Camelot or even give him proper burial).<br /><br />Arthur's characterization could have worked if the writers had been aware of it; if say Arthur was *meant* to be a loathsome brat that Merlin was struggling to portray in a positive light for the sake of public relations, with Morgan doing her best to expose her half-brother for his true self. With Merlin and Morgan as the real protagonists, the deconstruction of the legends could have been focused on their fight over this pawn and their attempt to gain control of the kingdom from behind the throne.<br /><br />As it is, the show attempts to have its cake and eat it too. I'd suggest giving this one a miss., revolving slowly so the camera can get a good look at her backside *and* her breasts).<br /><br />The episodes just sort of meander along without any real sense of forward momentum (some of the more pointless subplots include the knights bringing books from a hidden library back to Camelot, Guinevere going to visit her dying father, and Leontes/Morgan having some sort of weird encounter with a magical wolf in the forest that is never explained) and by the end of the series we're left with a cliff-hanger that will never be resolved thanks to the show's imminent cancellation.<br /><br />There are some good performances here and there - the aforementioned Eva Green as Morgan, and Joseph Fiennes who hams it up as Merlin.

B007BFSYMS|5.0|This app has a lot of different sounds, so everyone should be able to find something they like.  There are also free sounds to download.  Lots of rain, storms, and water.  Also, sounds like ceiling fan, vacuum, airplane, and street noise.  There is a feature that lets you set a time, or a length of time, before it shuts off.
B005FFW46S|5.0|This book was one of my favorites in the Discworld series, because it represents a culmination for Vimes. It's his &#34;happy ending&#34;, so to speak.
0151003084|5.0|I highly recommend this book!  It is a masterpiece by Edward Gorey.  Older children (over 6) will see the humor, younger kids will either not understand or get nightmares!
B004GEB9UQ|3.0|The book that really kick-started the paleo movement. By reading this book it really opened my mind and I started reading the other Paleo works. I think Loren's book is a little flawed and you'd probably be better off reading &#34;The Paleo Solution&#34; by Robb Wolf. His book is definitely reader friendly. HIs podcast on iTunes is pretty hilarious as well.
B00005JNS0|5.0|This is actually watchable / enjoyable for adults which is a huge plus! Dads get into it and even though ideally I would not have any TV for young kids. I just accepted that daddy bought it to help him get through a transatlantic flight. It worked.<br /><br />If you can avoid TV, I admire you. If you can't, this is a good option to save parents sanity on long trips.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|pretty cool. if your bored of the Terrain of the first. this is your temple. instead of a golden walkway you are in a village in the sky.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|Really enjoyed it.  First time that I have actually read it.  In the past only watched it on TV at Christmas.<br />Would recommend it to everyone for a Christmas read.
1589944607|4.0|I didn't realize there was a 3 player minimum when I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend. Whoops! So we haven't played it yet as not many of our friends are into board games as we are but it looks super fun!
B00766ZW8G|4.0|A very interesting take on a old classic.  Different to what I expected, but a very interesting read.  Would recommend it.
B001P06GX4|5.0|This is an easy game to learn but gets complicated when three or four players join in.  It is great fun learning how to both get your own tiles on the board and block your opponents.  The instructions (very few) are easy to understand and the game is fast moving.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Movies need to come out quick!!! Love this series could not put the books down can't wait to see if the movies will be as good!!!
B002L9N4DS|5.0|I bought this for my daughter and she was so happy with it.  One of her favorite movies and it looks awesome on blu-ray.
B0050DZ8J0|2.0|I guess it's true - you do get what you pay for.  This is just too limited in functionality too be tremendously usefully.  If you like apps that have limited usefulness, this app is for you.  Don't use this app - just go to the website.  That's fully functional!!!
B007REV4YI|3.0|Update: I watched it a second time and it seemed better. The bad guy was really well played, but Bond seems to still have lost his mojo. I suppose if you didn't grow up with he classic Connery Bonds, you might not notice. So I did up it a star, but I still don't feel like I watched a Bond flick.  (Better then Roger Moore, though!<br /><br />Now, on to the original review....<br /><br />Ever hear the one about the North Dakota farmer and his favorite hammer?<br /><br />He proclaims, \\"This is the best hammer I have EVER owned!  I've used it every day for fifty years!  I've replaced the handle four times and the head twice.  It's the best hammer I've ever owned!\\"<br /><br />That is how I feel about this film, only not in a happy way.<br /><br />When I want to watch a Bond film, I disengage critical thinking. I want fantasy action, impossible villains and (sometimes) women with weird names.<br /><br />But, noooooo, we have to change all that, don't we??<br /><br />Out of necessity, they have changed out the old familiar actors who played such iconic parts.<br /><br />But they also switched out the gadgets and instead say that things aren't done that way anymore.<br /><br />There are no hidden laboratories exploding and Bond ending up with some woman floating in a raft! Now he's more \\"real.\\" (Oh gosh, \\"what's his motivation?\\")<br /><br />Nobody ever yells (in some odd accent), \\"Keal Bond! Spectre was replaced by ??????  Where are all the guys in jumpsuits and white hard hats carrying machine guns and driving cleverly disguised golf carts?<br /><br />But worst of all, that \\"license to kill\\" guy has been replaced by someone \\"searching for himself, his roots, his inner Bond.\\" (Try \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\" if you really want a slightly less 2-dimensional 007 but still want all the silliness.)<br /><br />The hammer's handle and head have been replaced too often.<br /><br />Suggested viewing: Funeral in Berlin, The IPCRESS File, Blue Ice.

B00A2H9L2E|5.0|The first Silent Hill movie, frankly (in other words, in my opinion), did not feel quite right when it came to representing the video game. Sure, it got certain elements of the video game right, but overall, it felt forced in its style to appeal to the non-video game crowd.<br />This one, though, sticks more to the games. Specifically, Silent Hill 3. Hey, even Sharon/Heather looks EXACTLY like Heather from SH3, and that she spends a chunk of time in a mall like you start in the game adds good repute points for me to this movie. And that's not the only thing its gets right. Sure, it's got continuity from the first movie to keep the story straight, but the fact that it can keep continuation from the first movie and stick faithfully close to the third game in more than one breath (let alone for over half the movie) makes it deserving of praise.<br />I was just a touch worried that this movie would be a little cheesy like most sequels to any kind of movie would be, but I was relieved that the filmmakers (in every field with this case) learned from past mistakes and improved on everything and then threw in extra stuff that, surprisingly, did not make it feel bogged down in the slightest. Very good, clipping pace, even the \\"normal\\" scenes that help bring in characterization to each person, and the little subtleties therein, the extremely disturbing cult (straight from SH3 AND the first movie), even the nurses and Pyramid Head look exceptional. And, not to mention, the added bonuses of a Numb Body cameo (which looked jaw-droppingly excellent and downright chilling) and Malcolm McDowell as Leonard Wolf (and his great acting in quite a short amount of time), it all shwoed how much the filmmakers cared to appeal to anyone who loves not only horror in general, but also Silent Hill overall. Not to mention, they did an excellent job at one of the trademark signature subtleties of the game series- make institutional places (like school and church) become a total acidized nightmare. And the amusement park scenes? It nearly had me rethinking going to anymore amusement parks.<br />Strange questions getting shocking answers, a lot of very unique monsters (like the mannequin doll spider) having surprising twists to their behavior actually stunned me good, and the overall atmosphere within Silent Hill was nothing short of greatness, fitting for the film AND genre.<br />And from a certain line in the middle of the movie (no spoilers now!) and how the movie ends, I do hope they make a third that follows the footsteps of Revelation.e.

B00BEIYIUA|4.0|Eschewing the physics of reality, this film weaves a wonderfully fascinating tale of two young people in love. An astrophysics tale of Romeo and Juliet as the star-crossed lovers separated by a complex Escher-esque world of haves and have-nots.<br /><br />Jim Sturgess and Kirsten Dunst portray Adam and Eden respectively.<br /><br />Adam lives in the frigid, dirty, and dank oily world of Downbelow. While Eden's home is Uptop, a dreamlike existence of warm bright air and glittering palaces of light. Two planets who share every basic elemental aspect, but are divided by an unspoken social and fiscal chasm. But there are special places, natural features of great height, where the two worlds almost touch one another. A place like the Sage Mountains.<br /><br />A chance encounter between a thoughtful young boy and a young girl searching for her lost dog, accidentally bumping into one another at their respective peaks, begins a desperate dance as two halves of the same soul find, then lose one another.<br /><br />Like all children, they're born without hate in their hearts. Eden and Adam become friends. And as the years pass, become more than friends. Despite the monstrous illegality of their relationship, love blossoms in secret. Until one fateful day as the teen couple encounters a group of angry Downbelowers who attack the pair for their illicit romance. While helping Eden make her escape, Adam is shot. Losing his grip while attempting to lower her \\"up\\", the freefall drop ends with a sickening crunch. Striking solid stone as she crashes back onto her world, a widening pool of blood is the last image he has of her.<br /><br />Ten years pass.<br /><br />Now working as an electronics repairman with asides as an inventor, Adam unknowingly stands at the brink of a discovery that will revolutionize both worlds. Believing that his soulmate died on that fateful day, he goes through the motions of an infinitely empty existence. Until a pirated television program from Uptop catches his eye. It's her - she's alive. And he will do anything to again be with his one true love. Anything. Even prostitute his incredible creation to the corporate slave masters of Uptop's largest corporation, Transworld, for that single solitary chance.<br /><br />Finagling his way into and through Transworld - he's stunned and horrified to discover Eden doesn't know him.<br /><br />Nearly beyond words, he learns that the fall all those years ago caused blunt force amnesia; she has no memory of her childhood and teen years except when she sleeps and dreams.<br /><br />Undaunted, Adam undertakes the ultimate risk.<br /><br />The twin worlds' equivalent of a terrorist attack is to cross over without permission. A strictly forbidden act, permission is never ever granted. But he's going to cross over - repeatedly. His only hope is to encourage her memories to return by consistent re-association. But a Downbelower noticeably, and literally, stands out (up) from the crowd. As Uptop's gravity slowly burns through his illicit Up-gravity weights, Adam has to manage and mask his increasingly uncomfortable state while his custom bodysuit tips at the verge of combustion. And in a world full of Up citizenry, desperately has to avoid drawing public scrutiny to the fact that he's threatening immolation with every passing moment.<br /><br />Authorities from both sides are in hot pursuit, no pun intended, and closing in on the repetitious violator.<br /><br />A very entertaining romance for a 21st century audience. And, uncommonly, a good fit for both men and women, as this film captures the emotional aspects of a chick flick while carefully balancing the taut scifi and adventure aspects of a guy movie.<br /><br />There were a couple of very small weaknesses that prevents a full five stars, but this incredible visual feast is as strong a four as I can imagine.<br /><br />Movie Note:<br /><br />- Despite the fact the two planets share an equal orbit, I thought it cleverly profound that Director Juan Solanas never shows Downbelow as \\"up\\" when viewing the two worlds in the context of right and wrong, or even good and evil.at Director Juan Solanas never shows Downbelow as \\"up\\" when viewing the two worlds in the context of right and wrong, or even good and evil.

B001LF3YQK|1.0|Great concept but the product does not live up to the description.  Red button needs 2 hands to slide (it is not Quick or Easy!) and it does not snap closed securely.  The sides are not sealed tight when closed and the wipes dry out.<br /> I scheduled a return and thankfully Amazon just told me to keep this and refunded my money.  It is in the trash and Amazon saved the shipping cost by not having me return something that should not be resold.

B00A6HHJ9C|3.0|Steve is certainly going through a transition and he keeps a little more to the middle of the road this time around.Nothing wrong with that! \\"Creep Motel\\" sounds like he is channelling Michael Landau's voice and guitar,not a bad thing. I would prefer to hear a little more Piano work on the softer songs instead of Synths that date his work a little too much.The drumming on the last few albums has really been superb, and it carries on here.Steve respects his drummers, picks top line, respected artists and lets them loose a little. I could just have offered so many ideas for Back up vocals on \\"Right the Wrong\\", damn I wish I was a Producer. Tal's Bass on the song \\"Transition\\" is very poorly mixed, the major error of the album.Having Leland Sklar onboard is great, after hearing him absolutely Nail the Live Toto stuff so musically with only one week of practise like he had been in the Band 20 years confirms him as a Bona Fide Legend of Rock, period.I think what we have with Steve is a guy who works his Butt off to get where he is,and absorbs his influences very well,has his own sound and presents a Great product, I respect that. Not a bad effort at all if not as strong as the previous or an earlier release \\"Luke\\", which I thought was particularly strong.He is very busy though and only Methuselah knows how he fits in G3,Toto reunions and Ringo's All Star Band with his own stuff, apart from his personal shocks over the last few years.He is a legend and a very good effort like this slays most modern American Commercial Rock. Let us not forget Steve is ALSO one of the 2 or 3 Premier \\"No.1\\" seat Studio Guitarists in the last 35 years,so he has my respect and appreciation always.His playing and singing with Toto Live is just magnificent, a lesson for every Rock guitarist of how good you can get.I am unsure what Jeff Beck thinks of \\"Smile\\" , but I reckon it's quite Finely executed, maybe a little too much pre-amp Gain however but he does use high output Humbuckers. I think it'sa strong 3.5 , and I only give 5 to what I think are masterpieces.Finally, and it's not a Major issue, but there is a slight lack of Brightness in the Mastering in my view.

031620157X|5.0|After finishing this book, I could not help but be surprised that having been written by an author as a debut novel who is essentially an actor, it was so good. I purchased the book because I was a fan of Glee during its first seasons and a fan of Chris Colfer as an actor and individual because of his outspokenness about his sexual orientation. I had also seen many good reviews of it and when I learned that he had spent so many years working on it I decided to give it a chance. Honestly, I was not expecting it to be that great of a story but this novel completely exceeded any expectations I had at the start. It is very well written, and in such a way that captivates you until you find yourself reading it from start to finish. I personally could not put the book down and finished it in less than 24 hours.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading about the lives of different characters in classic storytellings after the \\"happily ever after\\", especially \\"The Evil Queen\\" from Snow White. This particular character especially touched me since I had never before read a fairy tale in which a villain's past was provided for the reader to fully understand the reasons behind a characters choices and way of being.<br /><br />However, I could not give this story a full five stars for the following reasons:<br /><br />First of all, I think Chris Colfer was a little confused about the audience it was supposed to be aiming at and the story got stuck somewhere between a young adult fantasy and a children's fantasy book. When you begin to read the book, the simplicity of the plot would make anyone categorize it as a children's novel, but as you further advance in the story you realize that although written mildly, some sexual/romantic insinuations can be discovered. I feel that Colfer should have been more clear about this and either excluded these passages or written the book in such a way that would have categorized it exclusively as a Young Adult Fantasy Novel.<br /><br />Another thing that disappointed me was the lack of character depth in the story. While reading the story I had a sense of a wonderful world, but was left wanting for more in terms of detail and character descriptions, making it hard for me to relate to anyone but the Evil Queen, which in my opinion was the only character who was portrayed at least a little bit as a relatable persona. I guess Colfer wanted to condense everything in as few pages as possible, but in doing so he prevented the development and description of all of the characters and the world.<br /><br />Even though many would probably disagree with me, I would not recommend it to children. The book is not in any way a sexual story or anything of the sort, but after you read it maybe you'll understand my opinion on this aspect.<br /><br />Either way, I enjoyed reading the book and I would recommend this book to Young Adults. I give this book five stars because I loved the way the story made me cry while maintaining it's lighthearted tone. When a story is able to take me for a ride with my emotions, I know that the author has done a very good job creating empathy between the reader (in this case me) and the characters in the story.
B000063DIH|3.0|My feelings with the Final Frontier are now known since I submitted a review for that album last night, but tonight... giving Fear of the Dark a listen for the very first time... I'm really happy Fear of the Dark is much closer to Iron Maiden's true creative edge.  The Final Frontier is much worse and shouldn't even be mentioned in the same sentence as Fear of the Dark (by a long shot in fact).  Still, my 3-star rating I'm giving is due to a few questionable moments.<br /><br />The title song is a total blast and probably the second best song here.  A pretty decent vocal melody and a ton of influences by the now relatively forgotten Wishbone Ash in the guitar solos (early 70's rock band in case you unfortunately don't know!)  This song is really melodic and a major high point for me.  As is \\"Afraid To Shoot Strangers\\" with an even stronger Wishbone Ash comparison in the opening guitar line (and perhaps Camel as well- solid comparisons I'm making here, guys!) The vocal melody is really good and not like anything the band has ever attempted before.  Really good stuff.  \\"Wasting Love\\" has lyrics worth paying attention to as well.<br /><br />However a few flaws come along, occasionally.  \\"Fear Is the Key\\" offers shades of Ian Gillan from Deep Purple fame with a voice that resembles the legendary Deep Purple frontman for one thing, but unfortunately, Bruce resembles the current Ian Gillan with all the vocal struggles we associate with him such as an inability to hit a higher (more likeable) vocal range.  \\"Weekend Warrior\\" is a solid AC/DC impression even though I think it'd be wise to separate AC/DC and Iron Maiden since they're not supposed to EVER resemble each other and should both be placed in a category of their own.  However, the two artists sound alike in this case.<br /><br />Regardless, Fear of the Dark is a decent album.  Not anywhere in the same league as Iron Maiden's classic 7 of course, but solid enough to recommend a purchase.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I was referred to this product by my Granddaughter, she thought I would enjoy it.<br />I have already suggested Pinterest to a friend and relative.
B00628CCQY|4.0|Let me tell you something- I honestly dislike lead singers that growl and rumble without singing an actual melody, and I hate this with a *passion*.  How is it then, that I like Blackwater Park, Opeth's supposed best album?  For one simple reason- the guitar riffs.  Well actually, you know how when you're reading a review for an album and people mention supposed influences of other artists when you're probably sitting there thinking \\"Yeah right, I don't hear so and so at all in their sound?\\"  Well *this* time, I actually hear slight bits of Jethro Tull in the acoustic playing and bits of classic Peter Garbriel-era Genesis in \\"The Drapery Falls\\" but mainly the music here is centered around gloomy and doomy Black Sabbath sludgy guitar riffs with a progressive rock leaning (though occasionally the guitar playing switches to another lighter soaring tone which I admire).  Normally, once again, I'm the guy who actually LAUGHS when people try telling me this stuff contains progressive elements.  This time I actually CAN make out what sounds like Rush or Dream Theater tendencies.  Basically Opeth succeeds at implementing a few different noticeable styles and combining them with loud heavy metal guitar riffs, whereas most artist fail miserably.  That *alone* is commendable.<br /><br />However, what makes Blackwater Park work for me is that the growling vocals are astonishingly enough, not a distraction in this specific instance.  It's almost a minor miracle that this is the case since, again, I *despise* growlers.  I believe actually singing is a better option 100% of the time despite the aggressive nature of the guitar playing.  This album is a minor exception, in fact, the ONLY case I've experienced thus far where I'm willing to make an exception.  Iron Maiden fans such as myself would adore this album.  As far as the complexity of the music, well I don't have any experience with guitar playing so I can only speak from the perspective of a music fan.  These guitar riffs are memorable.  So many times bands can't write memorable riffs but... not Opeth.<br /><br />Maybe this album *does* deserve to be one of the best of the last decade?  Either way, I take away one point because the best a growl singer can accomplish is not getting on my nerves, and this one succeeds.  You can simply ignore him and enjoy the riffs and solos (and the other occasional arrangements that pay homage to the classic progressive rock bands).  Amazing accomplishment and deserving of a high rating.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is the best book I have read in a long time ! I actually hated for it to end ! I actually got emotional at the ending !
B0076DELIG|3.0|This is a sold Connelly police procedural, though the ending is a bit improbable and maybe too bloody.  I see the need for some action in these books, but I find the working out of the mystery more satisfying.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|you use mine carts and zip lines its non stop fun but there's only four characters. loved it you should defentily get it
B0025KVLRY|5.0|Although it's not &#34;Meet the Beatles&#34;, it is the next best thing. Digitally remastered, and available on all my devices.What more could I ask for? Oh, and did I mention the albumn art? 'nough said.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think this app give as Achilles chance to care for and love a horse without having to pay a single dollar.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a wonderful book and very detailed. I love the layout of the book and the story itself. I loved this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
034580404X|5.0|Loved all three volumes. Started reading book one and it was exciting.  Book two was a continuation. All books are great.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|I thought that this dictionary was ok . I wish that you could be able to have looked up a specific word so it would make things easier. But I did like how the dictionary was clear enough so you would be able to read all the words. I would recommend this dictionary to all those hearty readers out their and I would also recommend this book to older people because the lettering was large enough so they would be able to understand but also make sure and see what the are doing but also be able to read and see the letters. I also do think that mostly all people would like it because it can teach you a lot of valuable things . Such as teaching a child how look uncertain word in the dictionary,and this could eventually lead to help your child be a better student towards others and it could lead to your student having a better education and future.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game. its easy to play and if you're old enough and care about your score, there is strategy involved. my highscore on arcade mode is 820:) it sometimes needs wi-fi to work because of the adds but I think that's fine.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|Only got to preview a few pages so far. Will furnish more review later. Can't seem to get pass the requirement for a review before I agent  to view the book
1401941893|5.0|It's a light message to think positively and you get a look into Miranda's life. I think it's a beautiful book written by an incredibly beautiful person. I know I've been thinking more positively since I started reading it. I would recommend it as a starter and then work your way up to heavier books.
0553381709|5.0|\\"Paperback\\", not \\"mass market\\" (which I've since given away) or hard cover (these are too big for a comfortable hardcover). Beautiful, glossy cover; nice large size, good typeface and paper — all my GoTs will be in this same format [I hope]. These books are meant to be devoured, folded over and indulged in, and this size/print beats all other editions!    As for the book: I don't give spoilers, but I will say it's the most heart-stopping and page-turning of the ASOIAF books ...so far. It's the book in the series that, even if GRRM screws the pooch and ruins the series (like TV's \\"Lost\\", or Jordan/Sanderson's \\"Wheel of Time\\"), this third book of Ice and Fire will stand the test of time. That's not to take away from the series as a whole, or especially not from the first two book (Game of Thrones and Clash of Kings), but just to say that ...s*** gets real in this book. It's highly re-readable, and every character and story is given good time (unlike, in my opinion, the next few in the series so far).    As time has passed since my first read, my meticulously-recorded list of ordered \\"favorites\\" at GoodReads.com has been invaded by very few modern books. (I like the classics a lot.) This book is one of those few which broke not only my Top 50 ( with #1 and #2 being Don Juan and Purgatorio — not everyone's favorites, I know, but books I've transcribed by hand out of appreciation), but knocked Gatsby off the Top 10. If I recall, Cryptonomicon (Stephenson) is the only other \\"modern\\" (last 20 years) books in my Top 20. (Not that I don't have a few questionables in my Top 50, but I pride myself in keeping my favorites free of pretentious-sounding literature that I didn't really like but maybe 'appreciate'; and quite honestly having plenty of what others consider \\"true crap\\" books that I've happened to find enjoyable, like Heinleins, crowding out normal \\"classics\\"). I love reading, and laughing, and having my emotions jerked around — Storm of Swords definitely moved from about instant favorite #40-somthing to Top 20, to knocking of Cat Who Walks through Walls (the \\"trashy Heinlein\\", as it's been reviewed here and at GoodReads), to slaying Things Fall Apart, and this year, to finally making it to #10 (Gatsby's former spot). Not sure it can knock of Brothers Karamazov; THAT might depend on GRRM's finale (if I live for another 40 years)! But ultimately, who cares: I'm setting this book between the Brothers K and Gatsby, and I really do love those reads; that's how much I like this book.    And I sincerely hope that GRRM gives us a #6 that is more similar to the first three books of this series, but I honestly don't think it's plausible. ASOS took the enjoyable-if-pedestrian material of AGOT and ACOK and shot the epic to the moon. I'm not sure GRRM could *do* this again. Excellent book. Belongs on everybody's bookshelf. [Maybe everybody over 14?]
B00A8ECU24|3.0|My daughter purchased nearly $10 worth of jewels in one day,. (before I turned the parental controls on).  She told me the next day that she needed more jewels.  Apparently, she went on a quest & when she was done her jewels had disappeared.  This is a common complaint about this game.  When I purchased more jewels for my daughter they never appeared in the game.  I had to call  Amazon customer service and they refunded the cost of all the jewels that we had purchased.<br /><br />Despite the problems, my daughter still loves this game. The HD graphics are beautiful.  Just be careful of the in-game $'s.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|And yes, we record, and BluRays can be a pain to navigate (compared to DVRs), but the show is so good you run through the discs quickly; no annoying navigation issues (compared to other DVDs and BluRays, yay!) and, unlike DVR recordings, I won't LOSE this. (The seasons take up a lot of DVR space anyway; when I know I LIKE a season, I'll buy it and rewatch it. And #1 was a seriously good season!)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers. To me it is very addicting. Once you start playing it is<br /> hard to stop. I rate this game five stars
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is a very meditative game. I hope you will enjoy it as much as I do. I really appreciate that it is free.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|An amazing book on so many levels! It's so satisfying to find a book that's a good read and also gets your brain working.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I enjoyed the plot twists and the characters. The story held my attention and although it seemed to drag occasionally it became apparent that it was necessary to advance the story.
B009E3EY38|5.0|I am watching the Blu-Ray concert as I type this. There are plenty of eloquent reviews about the perfomance, editing, etc, so I won't bore you with a repeat.<br />What struck me was the love between 3 brothers and the &#34;son&#34; they all believed in to take his dad's drumming place in the joy of their &#34;Celebration&#34;. The smiles on their faces as they share the special process of creating music together again for the first time in so many years is infectious. There is a special bond among survivors of loss and this is never more evident than here because not only did they lose their brother John and the legend of legends in drumming when he died, but they also lost their band, because, at that time, who could possibly fill John's shoes. So they did the wise thing in their opinion and let it go. Painful as it must have been. But here they also found John's spirit and his love in his son who got the opportunity to pay homage to his beloved father, but also the opportunity to create such happiness with his &#34;other dads&#34; and heroes in the process. I often wonder what was going through Jason's mind as he was there on stage, because he is a veteran of many stages and concerts himself at the time of this concert, but this was an opportunity of such epic proportions to explore his love of his drumming and his love of his heroes and, probably, the love of his family as well. At the end of the concert you can see him looking and smiling and pointing stage right and I wonder if he was looking at his mom and the rest of his family there to support him and celebrate with him for the accomplishment he has done that night.<br />This was more than just a concert. It was a catharsis, I am sure ,for John Paul, Jimmy and Robert to realize that they still had it as a band and it was also the opportunity to complete the Led Zepplin journey if they do. in fact, choose to make this the last Led Zepplin concert ever. We all like to go out on top and this is the perfect wayto do so, if it is the last one. Plus they also got to share this with the world through this lovely Blu-Ray DVD. I, for one, am so grateful to have the opportunity to see  and share in their joy of that night. I am sure no one will be disappointed with their purchase of this concert.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|The variety in Josh's albums never disappoints. Each listening brings a richer appreciation for every lyrical nuance and musical instrumentation. I have been, literally, a career-long fan and am really happy when the albums come out more frequently!
B002NT3B52|5.0|As a new dog owner, this book was great. It is somewhat technical, but it's not an instructional manual for how to train your dog. It is a detailed, well-referenced treatise on how dogs think. Very fun read.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I really liked this story. I think it's one I'll remember for a while. From a technical perspective it seemed realistic; no glaring physics errors (except I seem to recall one instance where it was cold and the text said it was 72°C. A typo?). I came to care a lot about the main protagonist (Watney) and the crew of the Hermes. It's just a fun story.
B0092QITO2|3.0|My kids loved it. But I still rather watch the Arnold one.<br />Why does hollywood try to redo movies all the time.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This app is awesome I love it so much. I'm addicted and so is my little brother. Great graphics!! This is a really good quality app, works great on kindle. LOVE IT!!!!! You're missing out if u don't get this app.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Its cute, it has great graphics and it never crashes. I personally, love this app. You are guiding a little leprechaun named Lep through multiple levels of fun. There are small insects/snails you can either defeat to get coins or leave them be to save the risk from losing a clover. Clovers are basically your life. If you get hit by the insects you lose one clover that you can get back by banging on a clover box. If you lose all three clovers, you lose one Lep life and must start the level over again. Each Level is harder than the first, so this game is sure to test your skill.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a lot fun! I recommend this game for all ages! Especially fun on Kindle Fire HE 8.9 screen!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great version no problems with it so far in my kindle fire hd. Just your normal solitaire card game. Fun!
B0095MVOMC|1.0|I bought this for my htc flyer. Had already played through the entire Hidden Letters game. This one, however, won't install properly. When i try to open it, i'm taken back to the appstore screen.<br /><br />Waste of my money.

B004GYY714|4.0|I love this app. I have been listening to it for 4 days straight. Stations are plentiful and I can even get radio stations 1500 miles away back home that I miss on this app. It gives you the ability to favorite stations. It also gives you the ability to favorite songs. Then the app uses your selections and recommends other stations you may like.<br />Reception is fantastic, seems like there are hardly any commercials.<br /><br />I was only a tad disappointed because I thought when I  &#34;favorite&#34; a song that it was allowing me to make my own playlist. But after I checked it does bring up all of the songs you marked as favorite but it won't allow you to listen to them; at that point you are only left with purchasing the songs. Other than that; I would have given this app 5 stars.<br /><br />Regards,<br />~ Holley Jacobs
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|enjoyed this game however it was very easy and supershort! definitely worth the 1.99 I paid for it tho. great story line.

B00992CF6W|4.0|minecraft pocket edition is a great app but needs to improve some things. first, cave systems. Jeb  needs to add these because making your own mine is getting pretty boring. second, the nether. aren't diamonds hard enough to find without using them on some almost useless machine? and third, the world. JEB YOU NEED TO MAKE THE WORLD JUST A LITTLE BIGGER!!!!!!! PLEASE I CANT TAKE BEING TRAPPED ANYMORE! but anyway great app fun to play on the go. truth out.

B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love the graphics of this game and all the new features it has. The only thing is, I am playing this on a Kindle fire and there seems to be a small delay for taking lefts and rights while running. Others than that, great game.
B005LAIHPY|4.0|This movie is easy to attack on many levels. Items like the fact that the aliens often just let the warships sit there and don't finish them off for long periods of time. BUT it's still a fun romp in which the navy saves the world! And in this day of endless antimilitary movies it's refreshing to see and promilitary movie!.  This one borrows from all the recent alien invasion flicks in many ways but it differs in that it's the Navy that's that's doing hte fighting. The part that probably drove some people mad was they way they used bouys to simulate radar and you had red strikes similiar to the GAME battleship. Still this movie runs very quickly and is full of action. the aliens are very humanoid in this flick and that may not be to some peoples liking. The blu ray looks great and this movie had a monster budget, which it didn't make back unfortunately for it's studio. Still The huge budget shows here and the film is a good way to spend a few mindless hours of entertainment. There is a made for dvd film called 'american battleship\\" that is also promilitary and actually features more fighting with a battleship against aliens!. That one is low budget but still worth watching if you enjoyed this film. Sure this is not great cinema , but it's fun cinema , and cinema that is very familiar to fans of modern sci fi.
B0050CJNJ2|4.0|Enjoyed the music.  Must admit I'm more of a popular music fan than country.  Would consider purchasing other of their albums, especially their big hits.
B009WO7NQO|2.0|Of course the game itself is fine but expecting an update for the Amazon version?  Keep waiting as usual.  they've been advertising the mynock level on the<br />.99 version for a month now but NO update on the 3 dollar version.  This will be my last Kindle for sure.  So sick of this.
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|Although some of the songs are not favorites of mine, enoyed the beautiful voice of this lady.  She definitely has a gift for music and deserves to be heard.  I have other CDs of hers and would like to hear her sing some more current hits.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This game reminds me a lot of the old school Super Mario games for the Super Nintendo, even the original. Love the game, look forward to more!
B008ZOHCKE|3.0|This app is pretty. I like the bookshelf and book cover design. It does what it says it does.  My issue is when you add/edit text to a page (on kindle fire) the keyboard takes up the bottom section of the screen, above that is the tool bar for the app and an ad!  half of the screen is consumed with stuff. the ad and the tool bar should be stationary at the bottom of the page and allow the keyboard to pop up independently.  this feature is annoying enough to me that I will use my original note taking app that is free and ad free! (Colornote)
0062082353|5.0|Kyle's story is on its surface one of America's most successful sniper. But underneath it is an example of the principle that valor in battle can earn the respect, if not the admiration, of even one's enemies. Thus the sobrique \\"al-sheytan\\"  from Iraqi insurgents might not necessarily be an insult. [[ASIN:B00ALIQ5E6 From Muhammed to Burj Khalifa: A Crash Course in 2,000 Years of Middle East History]]
B0091REZMW|4.0|Love this game..played it on Facebook and now on Kindle! Love that it isn't like other games that have ten levels and you are done.  You are never done with your quests!
0316224588|5.0|I have read almost all of Rankin's Rebus novels and find them always interesting and fun to read.  Usually I devour them in a couple of days, leaving the housework to wait until I finish.  This one was no exception.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Well the rating would have been a 3 but since the ending was so much better i came out to be a 4 not a 5 like the second book because it dragged on and on about how katniss wouldnt admit to herself about how she really felt about peeta and how his capture to forever till he was finally rescuded but the ended made up for it but ended to quickly
B008JFUTT0|5.0|This documentary moved me to tears. I bought both his original cd's and love all of the music on them. I ordered this dvd and will watch it again and again. Very moving and heartwarming! Highly recommend!

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great plot and story has a lot of passion! I love the characters. I found myself pulling fir their success.
B002S8AGZG|5.0|I live this movie and I've owned the DVD version. But I couldn't pass on the Blu Ray version of it! Definitely worth the upgrade! Plus, special features and directors thoughts was really nice!

B006MW3V6U|5.0|My wife and I are loving this series! We really connect with a lot of the characters and are anxious to see their stories develop. It's a refreshing change from the sensationalist media that we are flooded with here in the US. I highly recommend this series!

B00ABGEFWC|4.0|Very cute app. It has great graphics, fun mini games, and best of all tons of adorable pets you can unlock. The only problem I have with it is how long it took to install and start up. Also it has frozen on me before :( But overall a good app to have, and hey it's free! ;)

B009EEFTMC|4.0|I'm addicted only had it less than 24 hours! One thing that I experienced is left it on the you won screen for about 3 minutes, after starting a new game had, for the lack of a better description, lighting flashes across my screen after each match that literally obscured the screen. But I love it!
B00006LJ6X|5.0|I'm no good at writing reviews other than to say that if somehow you've never heard Chicago's sound, where are you? Thank you
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|Might not have purchased the CD had I realized how slick Amazon instant streaming music works. Had the music a minute after I hit the buy button. Very nice! Love Train, Drive By and 50 Ways are my favorite songs on this one.
B00005K9LK|5.0|After releasing five great albums in the 70's, British heavy metal legends Judas Priest made an even bigger splash in the heavy metal scene in the 80's with their 1980 classic breakthrough release \\"British Steel\\", which was my introduction to Judas Priest, and it remains one of my all time favorite 80's heavy metal albums in my CD collection. They would later follow that up with their 1981 release \\"Point of Entry\\" (which I also bought along with \\"British Steel\\" back in 2002 when I was 18) which of course was also another classic Priest album as well. Now anyways, this is Judas Priest's eighth full length album from 1982, \\"Screaming For Vengeance\\", and it is no doubt one of the best heavy metal albums from the 80's, and it was also a huge commercial breakthrough for Judas Priest as well, selling in excess of 5 million units worldwide and being certified double platinum in the United States and platinum in Canada. Not to mention that this is also the absolute best album in my opinion that Judas Priest have ever released, hands down. This album just absolutely rips, screams, shreds, and soars like an eagle on speed, and it definitely shows the band in top fine form here. Stylistically, \\"Screaming For Vengeance\\" showcases a more harder, and heavier sound than on \\"British Steel\\" and sees the band reversing their direction back into straight heavy rock after the melodically-styled direction that was shown on \\"Point of Entry\\". I also love the album art cover with the mechanical bird which is really cool. The songwriting and musicianship here overall is just flat out fantastic, I mean everybody is right on target throughout here. Leading the way of course is the one and only Metal God himself Rob Halford as he shows us exactly why he is the Metal God here as he displays his always ever so amazing vocal talents throughout giving without question one of his absolute best vocal performances ever. Elsewhere, guitarists Glenn Tiption and K.K. Downing both muscle out an unstoppable arsenal of awesome, muscular riffs and screaming, trail blazing, speaker shredding solos, and of course you've got both bassit Ian Hill and drummer Dave Holland who both do a fantastic job at providing a very monstrous rhythm section throughout the album.<br /><br />\\"The Hellion\\" is a short, but awesome instrumental buildup that leads into the ever so menacing and energetic \\"Electric Eye\\" (one of my many favorite Judas Priest songs)which is highlighted by busy fast riffing, pounding drum beats, menacing vocals, and killer solos, plus this song also features some of my favorite lyrics on the album for example: \\"I'm made of metal...My circuits gleam...I am perpetual, I keep the country clean\\". This song is definitely a true highlight, but there's much more. Next up, we have track three \\"Riding on the Wind\\" which is another awesome blazing fast rocker which starts off with it's famous killer drum intro and then shoots straight into another attack of fast, energetic riffing and screaming, winding solos, and piercing, wailing screams from Halford throughout, while track four \\"Bloodstone\\" is an excellent mid paced heavy rocker and another one of my favorites on here that starts with an awesome guitar intro which shortly kicks into a great catchy groove with both the bass and the drums soon joining in the fray as well. There's also some amazing vocal deliveries from Halford, some of his best I might add, and excellent soloing as well. This song is definitely another of my favorites here. The fifth song \\"(Take These) Chains\\" is another favorite of mine which starts with some cleaner guitar lines accompanied by Halford's melodic voice not long before erupting into a fantastic and catchy melodic rocker, and is later followed by \\"Pain and Pleasure\\" which is more slow paced yet it's another great monster of a song that features an awesome chorus, plus great slow burning riffage throughout. Elsewhere, we've got the ultra blistering and speedy adrenaline pumping title track \\"Screaming For Vengeance\\" that comes right at you with absolute heart pounding speed with fast drumming, lightning quick riffing and piercing solos, and Halford's wicked, lacerating high pitched screams and wails topping all of that. Another classic song of course we can't forget about is \\"You've Got Another Thing Comin'\\" which still remains one of Judas Priest's greatest songs, and the best song on the whole album hands down with it's simple yet catchy, driving, chugging riffs aided by a catchy, driving rhythm, and Halford's always amazing vocal deliveries. Not to mention that the chorus in this song is simply timeless, and the guitar solo always rocks my ears whenever I hear it, I just love it. Definitely a timeless classic for sure. Next, we have \\"Fever\\" which much like \\"(Take These) Chains\\" kicks off with some clean guitar lines and then turns into another great, catchy rocker, then followed by the album's closing track \\"Devil's Child\\" which features a very catchy chorus and a great solo thrown in as well. We're also treated with a couple of bonus track with the first one being \\"Prisoner of Your Eyes\\" which was a previously unreleased song recorded during the \\"Turbo\\" sessions in 1985, and an awesome live version of \\"Devil's Child\\".<br /><br />To put it simply, \\"Screaming For Vengeance\\" is without a doubt one of the greatest heavy metal albums to ever be released in the 80's, and also the best Judas Priest album ever in my opinion as I mentioned earlier. This here my friends is without question a timeless heavy metal masterpiece that still stands the test of time to this very day as it did when it first came out back in '82, and it also proves that music like this was made to last, and will never go out of style. I definitely recommend this masterpiece of an album to all fans of Judas Priest and metal fans alike...HORNS UP!!!g For Vengeance\\" that comes right at you with absolute heart pounding speed with fast drumming, lightning quick riffing and piercing solos, and Halford's wicked, lacerating high pitched screams and wails topping all of that. Another classic song of course we can't forget about is \\"You've Got Another Thing Comin'\\" which still remains one of Judas Priest's greatest songs, and the best song on the whole album hands down with it's simple yet catchy, driving, chugging riffs aided by a catchy, driving rhythm, and Halford's always amazing vocal deliveries. Not to mention that the chorus in this song is simply timeless, and the guitar solo always rocks my ears whenever I hear it, I just love it. Definitely a timeless classic for sure. Next, we have \\"Fever\\" which much like \\"(Take These) Chains\\" kicks off with some clean guitar lines and then turns into another great, catchy rocker, then followed by the album's closing track \\"Devil's Child\\" which features a very catchy chorus and a great solo thrown in as well. We're also treated with a couple of bonus track with the first one being \\"Prisoner of Your Eyes\\" which was a previously unreleased song recorded during the \\"Turbo\\" sessions in 1985, and an awesome live version of \\"Devil's Child\\".     To put it simply, \\"Screaming For Vengeance\\" is without a doubt one of the greatest heavy metal albums to ever be released in the 80's, and also the best Judas Priest album ever in my opinion as I mentioned earlier. This here my friends is without question a timeless heavy metal masterpiece that still stands the test of time to this very day as it did when it first came out back in '82, and it also proves that music like this was made to last, and will never go out of style. I definitely recommend this masterpiece of an album to all fans of Judas Priest and metal fans alike...HORNS UP!!!

B00BESLHEA|1.0|The only person I liked in this movie was the bad guy who turned into bronze. He looked like a bulked up Lee Van Cleef. The rest of movie was crap. Just thought it was funny the body builder who looked like Lee Van Cleef.
B005JE7XW0|4.0|The pacing was a little stop in go in this movie but it's still funny and keeps you interested throughout the movie. It's a fun satire on the horror movie genre and was enjoyable.
B000066C6F|5.0|Jamie Lee, John Travolta, Larraine Neuman, and Mary Lou Henner make this a terrific movie with a message.  Plus, such nice fit bodies to watch!
B00APUYN0I|5.0|I've giving it 5 stars because my wife, myself, and my 5 year old daughter all enjoyed the film. The pacing was fun and the chemistry between the cast and characters was fun to watch. The music added to the overall quirkiness of the movie, and we all caught ourselves trying to sing along.<br /><br />FUN FUN FUN movie to watch.<br /><br />**and yes, the shower scene was kinda weird to explain to the little one... I did my best to distract here. LoL!
0671510991|5.0|This is an excellent one volume history of both the practice of diplomacy and how it has influenced modern history. Dr. Kissinger does an excellent job beginning the volume with the conclusion of the 30 years war, which most historians regard as the beginning of the modern nation-state system and period of parallel modern diplomacy. While paying thorough heed to diplomatic history throughout the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Kissinger dedicates the bulk of his volume to events surrounding twentieth century diplomatic history, and I would say overall achieves a reasonable balance in the amount of time he spends dwelling on all historical periods. He also seamlessly blends his own personal autobiographical narrative into the events surrounding his own period as Secretary of State and the presidency of his immediate superior, Richard Nixon.<br /><br />I recognize that Henry Kissigner is a highly controversial figure and quite reasonable people believe him to be a highly amoral man whose personal history ought to be looked at in the most critical light. It is also impossible to deny that he served in the administration of Richard Nixon, who will be remembered for the corruption that surrounded many aspects of his own tenure in office. That having been said, I think that it is still possible to look at this book as an outstanding work of history that can stand in isolation from any of the historiographical controversy that surrounds the author of Mr. Nixon. Even for those who do not subscribe to the hard-edged realism of Mr. Kissinger, this book is still definitely worth reading for anyone, amateur historian and serious scholar alike.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|It was quick, it was witty, it was vulgar, and it was funny. Too me at least. But then again I can enjoy a Seth McFarlane show or two a night, and I don't consider myself a huge fan. But yeah, this is the kind of vulgar humor I'd engage in with friends when the wive's aren't around and... or with the Wifey... sometimes...<br /><br />Oh it's also can offend people, so take that into consideration.

B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love being able to create my own favorite music combos. The abundance of sounds available is really helpful in finding just the right ambience to set the tune for whatever mood you're in. Love it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is brilliant and fun with cool, funky music and choice of characters and hoverboards. The only down side to this game is the highly priced characters and the need to contact the amozen store when buying coins. All in all I would recommend this game to kids and teenagers as it is great!!!
B006ATJXQW|5.0|Although most of my question s weren't answered the book really shed light on dark places.I couldn't turn the pages quick enough

B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is super addicting.I like this game a lot. it reminds me of temple run but more in this century.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game how there are so much tours like Rio New York and more<br /><br />It's a awesome game it gives you a reason why the cop or Frankenstine or Santa is chasing you because the person that is running away is spray painting the trains
B000TGJ8AS|1.0|Here's what I'm guessing. One day on the set, Mark Harmon and Lauren Holly were reminiscing when producer David Bellisario heard one of them say, \\"Wouldn't it be fun to be in a soap opera again?\\" and Bellisario decided to oblige. That's the only explanation I can think of for this train wreck of a season, in which NCIS jumps the rails and darn near the shark besides.    The central conceit of Season Four is Director Shepard's strange obsession with a French arms dealer known - to his face, even - as \\"La Grenouille\\" (\\"the frog\\" - har har, geddit?). Never mind that the cringe-inducing pun fails to take the man's gender into account. Willing suspension of disbelief is stretched beyond breaking when the Director assigns Tony -- behind his supervisor's back and with a pointlessly thin cover name -- to woo The Frog's daughter Jeanne, who despite being French-born cannot seem to pronounce her own name. Hint: If you're female, it doesn't rhyme with \\"John.\\"    What conceivable jurisdiction the Navy's investigative body would have in Interpol's sandbox is never explained. And the teasingly revealed but long-seen-coming rationale would in real life be the stuff of televised Congressional hearings and serious jail time. Ridiculously, Tony's falling for his target - a mission aborter by definition - is inexplicably cool by the Director, who obligingly blesses a sexual relationship and even buying a place together (!), so long as Tony \\"really love[s] this girl.\\" The logical consequences for his cover aren't so much left to the imagination as simply wished away. No plot holes to see here, folks; move along.    Meanwhile, the story we came to watch is constantly put on hold while scene after saccharine scene of Tony and Jeanne's mind-numbingly predictable romance is thrust down our throats. Will Tony conquer his commitment issues?  Can the right woman transform a frat boy into the very model of domesticity? You are forgiven if your breath remains unbated.    All of this could easily be offset by stories that were otherwise as compelling and inventive as in previous seasons. But the writers are too busy insulting our intelligence to muster up any real suspense. It doesn't help that Scottie Thompson's flat portrayal of Jeanne will have you peering for the lobotomy scar. Or that Lauren Holly has the curious ability to over- and underact at the same time.    Save your money and skip straight to Season Five. This one is not worth owning.
B00AFEXRME|1.0|Let's do it laundry list style:  The plane crash: No way. Not possible.  A drunken cokehead pilot: No way it could happen in 2013. Any pilot who lived 10% the lifestyle portrayed by Denzel in this movie would be kicked out the FIRST time he was suspected (and then subsequently tested) of taking drugs. It would be one thing for Denzel to play the character as guy who did a line here and there, but to be in the gutter THIS BAD? Ridiculous.  The crash and pilot together: Yeah---RIGHT.  Toxicology report goes Poof: Yeah---RIGHT.  The Union guy: Now HERE'S one believable character, possible the only one. A union guy will try every gimmick to protect their union members.  Denzel is incapable of turning in a poor performance. In Flight his streak continues. It's just a shame he didn't a story to work with. Don't feel bad if you skip this one. Flight is a BAD, BAD movie.
B003Y74AZ2|5.0|I chose the silicone style case because I wanted to have a good grip on the phone and felt like smooth plastic would not do that. This case is super basic and very practical. Would buy it again.
030758836X|5.0|Gone Girl was everything I was expecting and more. My library had many more requests than copies and it was wonderful to be able to own, read and share this book.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|A great story with a well documented ending.  You can't help but wonder where the third book of the trilogy will end.
B007REV4T8|4.0|Great movie, but the extras advertised on the case weren't there.  Should have had: \\"Shooting Bond\\", DB5, Women, Locations.  Had trailers for other movies, and a short ad for the soundtrack CD.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I bought this for my iphone 4s... great ap and game. I bet it not long after I purchased it.
B0023AO5JC|5.0|Peter Lorre was honing his craft before he came to the U.S. and this is probably his best film performance, ever!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Grab a tissue while watching this!  True story about a dog that waits for his owner at the train station every day after the owner dies (Richard Gere).  True love.  A must see.
B009L7MD44|5.0|Since I purchased 16 gb iPad3 I was looking for an option to increase memory. Did lot of research around this and came up with two products. 1) Seagate Goflex Satelite 500gb and 2) HyperDrive FTPCloud. During 2012 Thanksgiving seagate device was priced around $100 but suddenly raised to $199. So I was inclined towards FTPCloud. Another advantage is you can hook up any external usb storage to FTPCloud. It works great !!! No configuration required at all. Just follow the instruction in the manual and you will be all set to use this tiny surprising device. Streaming is very fast.<br />Now they have ios app too. I am loving it.... I am using 1tb seagate external drive and battery lasts for 3.5 hrs which is not bad. I hope using flash drive you can save some battery too.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a very good book, really enjoyed it and am looking forward to the movie..plan on reading some books by Nicolas Sparks
B000A1SZ2Y|3.0|This lens does provide for some decent macro capability. You just have to make sure that your lens is a telephoto or you will get a vignette on your image. Since it attaches at the front of your lens, you can still use the autofocus of your camera (although the depth of field is so short that it probably doesn't matter). Some of the cons is that there is no filter ring so you cannot use a flash ring (very helpful with macro photography) and the expense. For about 1/4 of the price you can get some inexpensive extension tubes. Although the Raynox lens is much easier and faster to attach, the price is just too high given other alternatives.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|As a retired  CIA agent, Bruce Willis is trying to settle into normal life when higher ups determine he and several fellow operatives are RED- Retired, Extremely Dangerous, and therefore subject to permanent rest- thus begins a series of attempts to reduce Willis, his impromptu girlfriend, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich and Helen Mirren to gopher food. It has action aplenty, with Willis doing his Diehard-like best to avoid deletion by the CIA. It has wit with somewhat tongue in cheek flavor that makes it very watchable -
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a great and cool app. I especially love all the new features such as the mines and zip lines. Great graphics and animation!!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love it! it's better than the first temple run! the graphics are really nice. the only little problem I have is sensitivity. I have it on the kindle fire. other than that it's great!
B0013TTLDE|4.0|Nice, but I liked The Forgotten Garden better. To me it was a bit quiet. A book which I will not remember very long.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is to good of a game it is awesome. I would totally rate it 5/5 it is the best game ever and it is free it is so good. Just get this game it is so addictive.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Wish I could have read it in Swedish. Had to waio for the translation. Read with a smile all the time
B001UFQNF0|4.0|Using it for a fun project called The Brake Fast Club heh.  Took off one star because I have to learn to rewire this thing to all manual switches so the lights will stay on.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Hard to say what caught my interest, but i loved the story. I lived the book, in Australia as well as in England.
B0012GMUSQ|5.0|Peple are stunned to learn how great this EP is. With some.help from fellow Seattle residents Ann Wilson from Heart and Chris Cornell of Soundgarden this CD is fantastic. It only has 4 tracks on it,but each song will make a lasting impression on you. Brother is the first track followed by Got Me Wrong,Right Turn,& the last track is the beautiful but haunting Am I Inside. You will not be disappointed by this CD,it's amazing.
B004L86718|1.0|it used the f word every other sentence. slow story line. wasn't sure if it was a chick flick or a sports movie. I'm not sure if the writers knew either. the only thing that was good was that tom cruise was in it. and he was still super weird.
B008J05EL8|2.0|I really don't know why I did order this stuff that I did really use, because  I don't need it. I think I ordered it by mistake.
B0033PSH4U|5.0|Best Movie the love and admiration of a son and a father. Good vs. Evil! a must see movie for all ages
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I was playing because I just got to new York and I went to bed. When I woke up the next morning I lost all my coins and everything. I was really mad but now I am at Rio and I earned all my coins back by playing a lot. I just want people to know to be warned.
1441308660|5.0|Considering that the alternatives cost 4 times as much and weigh three times as much this is just a great value.  Unlike many other covers, this one fits in my (winter) jacket pocket.  I really don't need a cover that turns my kindle on and off.  I can push the button.
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|I think we should watch the movie for its content and rethink the event for its outcome.  The movie is Ben's best work.  The event was the CIA at its finest.  At one point, the CIA agent could have abandon the project and gone home on his own.  Not sure what the Iranians would have done at that point.  This is perhaps a story that should have stayed buried in the CIA archives.  Instead, it becomes one more excuse for the Iranians to hate the USA.  I liked the movie so well that I have ordered the blu-ray disc.....tag
B008DVJMAW|5.0|Great Album, great band, wish they had more music out there, hard to find their albums on CD.  Make More Music!
B009B8YZKS|5.0|We really enjoyed watching this online but the blu ray is way better.  Much more content than online too. :)
0743243153|5.0|Another book bought for a speacial friend needing it.  They have already read it and really liked it and couldn't believe the price I got it for.
B00BCWOFIS|5.0|Awesome! This show is definitely good. I love how the series has developed, and how Mike has grown through the season. The chemistry on screen with the actors is undeniably brilliant. The drama gets even better from Season 1. Definitely a must watch TV show.
B0051SDM5Q|5.0|I had loaned my previous copy of this book to my daughter--AND  SHE WOULDN&#34;'T GIVE IT BACK__ so I bought another one . Valuable Tool.
B00000G3PA|4.0|The story is kinda sappy, but if you love outstanding special effects, this a great movie. For the price....good value.
0593059824|5.0|I loved this book.  I read it in 3 days.  I love Sophie Kinsella's books.  It is typical chic lit.  I started laughing within the first couple of pages and was hooked.  I hate when these books are over.  If you just want a fun read, this is a good book for that.  If you are a fan of her books, you will enjoy it.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I thought this game was awesome once you got good at it but I have to say it can be .really annoying sometimes
B008Y2IU12|5.0|This movie was awesome. I received this as a gift. uploading this to the cloud is fast and convenient. thanks!
B006L9B6TI|5.0|What else can I say about this book that others have not said? But as I have learnt, &#34;No duty is more urgent than that of returning thanks&#34;, I feel oblige to write and say Thank You, Thank You, Thank You, Madam Rhondo Byrne for this great book.
0380002930|5.0|Watership Down is a surprisingly compelling story about a group of rabbits forced out of their home and made to find a new one, encountering hardships of various kinds and the usual archetypal heroes and villains along the way. The facts of the story are mundane in a human sense even while being important in a rabbit-ish sense. Yet, strangely, the story, characters, and developments are far more interesting than one might think they'd be, for being a story within the small world of rabbits. There's a significant amount of insight into people, their motivations, and morality along the way -- even if those &#34;people&#34; are rabbits in the story (distinctly rabbit-ish rabbits, at that). And the story is presented so beautifully, with excellent descriptions, backstory, and even legend and myth, as to be compelling even in the confines of a story about rabbits. I haven't read this book recently, but it continues to stick with me, both for having a highly interesting story and for presenting good &#34;literary value&#34;. Highly recommended.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|It gets a little boring after a while, but I do enjoy it.  I do remember playing these in our travels.
0756404738|4.0|TWMF continues the story of Kvothe begun in The Name of the Wind. Kvothe continues his education at the University, travels abroad on sabbatical (learning much more in the process), and returns to University a much-improved person (save in one respect). His sense of ethics remains as questionable as ever; but where it was iffily &#34;justifiable&#34; in some sense in the previous book, it becomes more malign in this book (and I am ignoring one outlier when I say this), and less of the sort of thing you'd let slide in a conflicted character. Put simply, Kvothe grows darker. This is neither intrinsically bad nor good as far as creating a compelling story goes, but it may make it harder to enjoy reading it.<br /><br />Pros: The writing's still enchanting. Kvothe's money woes subside (I noted this in my review of The Name of the Wind as beginning to drag in that book) and no longer take up so much space wearying the reader. The culture of Ademre is fascinating. The bits of &#34;fairy tale&#34; doled out throughout the book are always beautiful, each also seeming relevant to the plot. Fae truly does feel different from the rest of the world, as it should.<br /><br />Cons: In hindsight, some of the plots take up way more pages than it would seem they should, particularly if one considers what those plots actually entail. The writing's good enough that you might not notice it so much at the time. But still, this book lacks the concision and necessity of events of its predecessor. (Hopefully my evaluation of the book on these grounds will change when I can get around to rereading it -- I only borrowed the library copy, waiting for the mass-market paperback before I buy it. I'm currently rereading The Name of the Wind, and events and their ordering in that book retain that necessity on reread -- in fact they seem even more necessary.) In some ways we also don't learn a whole lot in furtherance of Kvothe's main goal of learning about the Amyr and the Chandrian -- a few bits, but very little knowledge of substance. There's a lot of sex that seems gratuitous (especially when it's introduced in Ademre, where the necessity for its introduction seems tactically incomprehensible to me). There's one passage in (Kvothe's) defense of the worldview behind this that it's pretty easy to take strong offense at (and the author has more where that came from, sadly).<br /><br />Anyway: not as unreserved a recommendation as the previous book, but still good. It's worth reading to continue Kvothe's story from the first book, for sure.but very little knowledge of substance.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Just by chance I pick this series up and now I can't put it down. I can't wait to hear more. It's an addiction.
0345404475|4.0|Let's first clear this up: this book is not the movie, and the movie (whichever cut of it you want to consider) is not the book. And I don't actually think either is worse for it. They simply focus on different philosophical questions.<br /><br />Rick Deckard owns a sheep. Except it's not a sheep: it's just an android. Earth has been so devastated by wars that most animal life on Earth is gone. (It's not so great for humans, either: some have mental capacity so diminished they're known as &#34;chickenheads&#34; forbidden to leave Earth, while the rest could emigrate offworld to live in luxury if they wanted. Why they don't is an interesting question.) To own a living animal is a luxury, so much of one that there's an industry dedicated to providing people with android animals as false status symbols. But Deckard's increasingly discontented owning a fake animal instead of a real one.<br /><br />Deckard has a chance of being able to own a real, live animal if he can &#34;retire&#34; six &#34;andys&#34;. Deckard's a bounty hunter tasked with killing renegade human-looking androids that have escaped offworld service. If he can retire these andys, he'll receive a bonus large enough to purchase a real animal.<br /><br />The story, then, is oriented around Deckard's hunt to retire these andys. Along the way we read about the nature of religion, what it means to be human, and the meaning of status. It's a quick read, but it'll leave you thinking.
1400069289|5.0|Excellent book, well worth the read. Case studies and practical examples make for an informative interesting read on how to make changes to your work and personal life.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I love the way he writes. The pacing is great, he is excellent at creating suspense and I love the twists. The character Mitch Rapp is awesome and everything is so real. Would recommend to anyone who likes great writing.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I really enjoy solving these puzzles.  You can even choose how many pieces are in the puzzles. The photographs are outstanding and enjoyable to look at.

B0051ANPZQ|4.0|Amazing book absolutely loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sooo inspiring. It felt like the characters were real. I would absolutely recommend it to all kids
B0058YPGSY|5.0|it was awesome.i would recommend it. to everyone good show all to gether. can't wait for season five to come up for sale.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|A fun and quick mind sharpening game, great for breaktime play or during television commercials.  Now if this game company can program a 3-D jigsaw puzzle game, that would be super fine.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|the driving got boring - plot was not that interesting or challenging.  I was not riveted to this read - it was not as challenging as other Reacher reads, but I am still a fan!
B001UV4XFG|5.0|This is a really good movie in the saga. I'd say that it is probably my favorite one. It's crazy!
B004FP1WX0|5.0|There has to be some mental condition that social media has found an outlet.It took courage for all parties to be forthcoming.
0792164903|5.0|I love this movie! It's perfectly done for the dark and dreary world of Sleepy Hollow and Johnny Depp did a great job.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|I wasn't a fan of the Star Trek franchise before I saw this movie but I actually really loved it and am super excited for the second one.
B000002J0B|5.0|What a beautiful album, and the follow-up to Zoso, or Zeppelin's untitled fourth Album, sometimes referred to Led Zeppelin IV.  Not quite a perfect disc, as the fourth entry on the first side \\"the Crunge\\" is weak, yet this is a Zeppelin filler though, so it is not at all that much of a detraction.  But all the other songs, all seven of them, were so well done as to be included on Jimmy Page's four CD Zeppelin tribute set in the late 1990's - a wonderful collection.  This is Zeppelin truly at the top of their game, striving out into new directions, and refining their music, moving now completely beyond hard rock, and not coming over like a lead balloon anymore!  How can Led Zeppelin IV be improved upon?  Purchase and find out the magic behind their fifth album \\"Houses of the Holy\\".  Btw, the second song off this album was also on the video featuring Robert Plant, on the group movie/concert release of the mid-70's (\\"The Song Remains the Same\\"), being, the \\"Rain Song\\".
0307887448|3.0|I had the audio book and that generally makes most books \\"readable.\\"  I got bored.  I didn't care about the main character.  I did enjoy the future world and the cyber world was neat but overall the book didn't reach me.  I've read other reviews that mention the anecdotes about 80s and 90s television and technology as a drawback but I kind of enjoyed that.  It was a pop culture history that offered some information.  I wouldn't pick it up again but some out there might enjoy it.  I'm sure a great many will.

B006AN78XS|1.0|This movie was long to get to the point, unrealistic and very boring in my opinion. I don't recommend watching this movie even if you are bored.

159308322X|4.0|The Moonstone is a huge, yellow diamond that originally adorned the head of a Hindu moon-god's statue in India.  It was removed by Muslim conquerors and then taken through murder and theft by the corrupt Col. John Herncastle in the 1799 British storming of Seringapatam.  Some fifty years later, Herncastle, who has been shunned by his family, leaves it as a legacy to his niece, Rachel Verinder.  But all during this time, three Brahmin priests and their descendants have continued to follow the diamond in the hopes of returning it to India.  For Rachel's eighteenth birthday party, Herncastle's nephew, Franklin Blake, is instructed to bring the diamond to Rachel.  At the party, besides Rachel and Blake who are in love, are Rachel's mother, cousins Godfrey Ablewhite and Miss Drusilla Clack, a local doctor Thomas Candy, and a world traveler named Mr. Murthwaite.  Three Indian jugglers have also come by offering to perform for the party but are refused.<br /><br />  Rachel wears the diamond at her party.  However, the next morning it is missing.  Several suggestions as to who took it are made--the three Indian jugglers; Rosanna Spearman, a maidservant who begins to act oddly and who then drowns herself in a local quicksand; and even Rachel herself, who also behaves suspiciously and is suddenly furious with Blake when he directs attempts to find it.  Sergeant Richard Cuff, a renowned detective from Scotland Yard, is called in, but the mystery remains unsolved and everyone leaves.  During the next year there are hints that the diamond was removed from the house and may be in a London bank vault, having been pledged as surety to a moneylender. The Indian jugglers are still nearby, watching and waiting.  Who took the diamond?  Will it ever be found?  And why did Rosanna kill herself?  The story is told through narratives by several of the parties involved, including head servant Gabriel Betteredge, Miss Clack, the Verinders' solicitor Matthew Bruff, Mr. Blake, and others.  T. S. Elliot called it \\"The first and greatest of English detective novels.\\"  The British Conkie and the American Edgar Allen Poe are credited as co-creators of the detective story.<br /><br />  The Moonstone has all the features that we usually associate with English detective novels--an English country setting, a bloody murder, a tragic suicide, a frustrated love affair, a bumbling local policeman, and a brilliant London detective.  However, this is not a \\"modern detective story.\\"  Rather than focusing on atmosphere and sinister villains, Collins emphasizes characterization and a simple mystery with its solution.  Forms of the \\"d\\" word are used in a few instances, and the terms \\"Lord\\" and \\"God\\" are occasionally found as interjections.  There are several references to drinking wine, smoking tobacco, and even using opium, although both the smoking and opium use are essential to the plot.  Also, the opium is spoken of more as a medicine, and the dangers of addiction are mentioned.  The only really \\"religious\\" person, Miss Clack, is slightly lampooned as somewhat of a fanatic, but the fact is that there are people who do self-righteously use their religion as a cudgel to beat others.  The book could be done as a family read aloud with some judicious editing or explanation but is recommended primarily for teens and adults as the subject matter and style of writing would probably not appeal to younger children.S.

B00B2V66VS|4.0|Much more challenging than TR1.  My kids and I love it.  We especially love the comments from the monster when we are eaten.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Everything is interesting and ideas you may not have ever thought of and there they are. Isn't the internet wonderful.
B000VUFJ4Q|5.0|This Deluxe Edition simply belongs in any avid Taylor fan's collection.<br />It simply is incomplete without it.<br />As expensive as it is to acquire these days, it is so worth it. Buy it!
B005MYEPXC|5.0|What can I say . . . I've seen it 6 times and we're talking about pulling it out again to enjoy.
076790382X|4.0|&#34;I'm a Stranger Here Myself&#34; is now on the shelf with my other volumes of Bill Bryson's books that I have enjoyed. Not as hysterically funny as &#34;The Lost Continent&#34;, it does have you chuckling throughout. It's enjoyable to see how an expatriot sees our often times quirky country.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so addicting...I started a month ago and now my score is 183350 and it is a easy/hard game but is so bomb.com
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Loved this book. It was very descriptive. The imagery took you to a different world. I would love to see this made into a movie.
B006IYG5HE|2.0|I really had high hopes that the Harry Hole series would be something I could get into.  It wasn't.  The story jumps around between different characters so much, it doesn't feel like Harry Hole is the main character at all.  I found it hard to follow.  I'm glad it was on sale.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Who wouldn't want to get the entire Star Trek original motion picture collection?  I am definitely satisfied with the quality and speed of service.
0782008364|5.0|Jennifer and Gina have always been two of my favorite actresses and this dvd was part of the reason why.  The were both awsome.  Thanks
B008JAGZDE|5.0|I have long been a fan of the American Pie series and this was just another great one.  No complaints.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|New kindle owner since January 2013;I didn't like the tiny battery icon on the kindle (or the WI-FI icon) either. I was happy to fine this free app on Amazon. I like all features,especially how long it will take to charge and an announcement will inform you(after set)to what % of charge left. I think this is a must have app.
B009ANP48G|4.0|I chose this rating as the flick is nice and the 3D bluray is also excellent. The digital copy works nicely
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Love this game. I can not stop playing it.  I highly recommend getting it.  Hours and hours of play.  Love it.
B005HSL626|3.0|fun for awhile, then your just repeating moves even though you go faster and faster. Maybe I'm too old (60) to keep up.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|U have<br />to b<br />uy cards after awhile. I throught its was free wrong. Not worth its were is the free cards at on amazon.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Great fun. My grandkids have it also and we compare how far we've gotten. I like the way you can zoom out so you can see the hole area.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is a great, safe place for Inventors to place their ideas. I feel safe keeping any of my ideas on this.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed the prose, but I found myself frustrated with two main characters. Is it believable that two such diverse people would have found enough connection to marry? They seemed selfish and only pretended to care for each other. I needded more of the plot to set up their initial connection before they fell off the marriage cliff.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|It is a very good game I like it very much I really wish it was  a part 2 it is so  mysterious I wish everything on here was free so I could play games like this all the  time I wish I had money though so I could get it uo really really wish I could
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This as is an average game at best. It's<br />A bit of a rip off even though it is free
B0036EH3WU|5.0|This set gives an air of mystery that truly mimics the series.  The UV light deal is more of a novelty than anything else but the DVD extras, including the hidden disc make up for it.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This was a great book, very well written. John Green has a nice way of making sentences, a rare talent. I loved Hazel and Gus' relationship because it was so sweet without being all mushy and crap. I really did enjoy this book
B00992CF6W|5.0|I buyed this game for my 10th birthday I tried to find minecraft games but I found minecraft games rated 1 and 2 then I found this and I suggest buy this game.tip:turn on peace ful mode on options to have no zombies on survival mode ps so awsome game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is saga great book very exciting and fast paced. I would recommend it to all ages. I couldn't put it down.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Slow start compared to the first, but it picked up well and was enjoyable.  Would recommend this book to a friend.
B00A4GXJD0|5.0|Love the new album Kid Rock has a diverse group of songs that fit different categories and range of people. My favorite song \\"The Mirror\\" I played it for my son age 21 & he down loaded the whole album. This was worth the money I spent.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I love A Capella singing. I had no idea it was being done like this. I had to keep closing my mouth at the incredible harmonies, aside from wondering if it was being synched or was live. It really didn't matter. Great story, real characters, such fun with the commentators (tongue in cheek sexism), and choreagraphy to knock your socks off. I have'nt ODed on a movie in a long time like I did on this one. Where is the fan club? I want to join.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|I got tired of this game in short order and wondered what the big buzz was all about!  Removed it from my device.
B009HELT3C|5.0|The original Men in Black was a brilliant, witty film, with astounding effects, fine acting, and a wonderful sense of humor. The second film in the series came close to the original, but the third might even pass it by. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones reprise their performances from the first two films, and  Josh Brolin puts in a fantastic performance as a young Agent K- he's got all of Jones' mannerisms and speech patterns down, and he even looks like a young Tommy Lee Jones.<br /><br />All the effects and the imaginative creatures that made the first two movies so much fun are still there, and the plot and dialogue are every bit as good as anything in the first two movies. This time, we're looking into the history of the MIB, the history of the 1960s, the space program, and the history of agents J and K as well. This is a delightful movie that will leave you feeling happy and perhaps longing for an MIB 4.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|A dynamic album that you can listen from beginning to end with out skipping any tracks. A must have for all music collections.
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|I really like Meryl Streep & Tommy Lee Jones, but this movie was kind of a dud in my book.  Both main characters where terribly cliched, the stream quality was abysmal which may have made the tediousness so much worse.  I'm not sure what others liked about it, it was not good!
B001FB4W0C|5.0|This is the best season I've viewed so far!  More humor than other seasons that I've seen.  I would definitely recommend.
B006IYG5HE|5.0|I loved this book from the first paragraph....the characters are people I liked right away!  This is my first Harry Hole book and I will read more!!!
B003XWFLTM|4.0|overall this is an attractive set, a reissue of recordings made in the 1990's in the beautifully resonant great hall of the moscow conservatory with DG's usual very high acoustic standards. it includes not only all six symphonies but the &#34;manfred&#34; symphony, and 10 incidental pieces, including &#34;the tempest&#34;, &#34;romeo and juliet&#34; and the &#34;hamlet&#34; fantasy overture, performed with exceptional clarity and precision by the russian national orchestra. the attention to inner parts and orchestral color is especially pleasing; this is the set to use when reading the orchestral score.<br /><br />&#34;precision&#34;, however, is not an attribute that one associates with tchaikovsky's esthetic, and i found this set had a deliberate rigor of tempo and phrasing that too often lapsed into the all-together-now manner of a marching band. for me the &#34;francesca da rimini&#34; symphonic fantasia was disjointed, without cumulative tension, and pletnev's strict tempo approach to orchestral climaxes and pivots often drained the rhetorical intent -- the emotional impact -- from the scores. the opening to the &#34;pathetique&#34; symphony is beautifully rendered, conveying resignation rather than despair, but the blistering scales in the strings in the finale to the 4th symphony are played with academic nicety.<br /><br />this is a great set to own for the incidental pieces, and for a transparent aural representation of the scores; for the conflicted passions and musical poetry that is unique in tchaikovsky's music, other recordings (janssons, mravinsky) would lead my recommendations.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|With all the other zombie and vampire books, shows, and movies out there, I thought that this was a unique, realistic, post-apocalyptic version.  The interview format allowed you to read portions at a time and piece together the bigger picture in your mind.  Obviously, not likely to happen any time soon but entertaining, nevertheless!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I couldn't put this book down, and it's a loooong one! Absolutely love the characters, the twists, the ending.  A great book to really sink your teeth into - fiction sprinkled with historical facts throughout.  A++ Mr. King!  I was actually sad when it was over - missing my friend, George.
B000000ISE|5.0|Everything you want from a superior pressed and mastered CD. Smooth sounding . A good recording source can result into this outcome, as long there is put love into mastering and production.
1400067820|5.0|This book is a must read for traders. In fact, I intend to give as presents to colleagues and risk managers.<br /><br />Ironically, almost everything the one-star reviewers say is true, but the great ideas are so thought provoking the book must be read.
B0017XD3OY|5.0|Will Smith is the Legend.  Ever wonder what it would be like to live in New York City by yourself?  Captivating.  5 Stars.
1449433251|5.0|We were so unhappy when Bill Watterson called it quits with this strip.  What a delight to read about the fantastic imagination of Calvin.  The Complete set has been a wonderful walk down memory lane and a way to share our favorites with our family.
B000SP1SH6|5.0|This is a classic.  I sometimes wish I could repeat a single day over and over and over again.  5 stars.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|I find it hard to believe now, but before New Girl premiered I really disliked Zooey Dechanel. I wouldn't watch anything with her in it and when my hubby said he wanted to give New Girl a try, I was filled with dread at the idea. Being supportive I gave in to watch it and I'm so glad I did. I was so drawn in by her character that by the end of the episode I was sold. Not too many shows have ever won me over from day one. I just love the cast so much, especially Nick, that I had to see what else would happen to them. I find it very ironic that by the middle of season two I have found Nick and Jess to be my all time favorite couple on tv or in a movie. I love the entire cast and care about all of them, which is not something that has happened to me before. I just hope now that Fox doesn't do something stupid and get rid of it. I barrel laugh often while watching New Girl and I look forward to seeing it each week. While it may not be for everyone(their loss)If you haven't seen it yet, I suggest you pick up season one and give it a try. I'm sure glad I did.
630529142X|5.0|This is the classic you must watch if you haven't already.  Adam Sandler is too funny.  That's high quality H20 and 5 stars.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Got this for free and love it!  Beautiful designs and colorful.  Easy to play and addicting!!! Full cube of fun which you play like 3D concentration.
B00000DHR0|5.0|I love Celine Dion! She is a wonderful singer and I've lost count of how many times I've listened to this cd.
0375836675|4.0|This was a gift but my girlfriend said that she heard great things and it seems like the book has an incredible story.
1451695195|5.0|Thank you Dr. Alaxander for sharing this profound experience with us.  Your testimony verifies what I have experienced and learned about Reality and the power of Spirit over the flesh and healing events that cannot be explained by the laws of the physical realm.
0375507256|4.0|My girlfriend loves the imagery in the novel, and cannot wait to see the movie now. It's a bit of a hard read if you're used to the more popular novels coming out nowadays, but worth it.
B007REV4T8|5.0|And by that I mean the film. Yes, Daniel Craig rocks and rolls in this edgy movie, but the story, the casting, the editing, the locations -- all work together to create a nail-biting film from beginning to end. Character arcs are clear--and impressive: Bond hits rock bottom and crawls his way back, physically and emotionally, after being 'betrayed' with one command by 'M'. 'M' comes full circle in her dealings with her 00's - having to face the wages of her decisions. So many cool new character interpretations--personally, the new direction the franchise is taking is spot on--for a change. This Bond rates with the best of the other Bond shows.
B006YTTVHO|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book because it reminded me how simplicity and focus can make almost anything better. I don't think it's that hard really, unless you consider yourself shy, but everyone can become a better listener! I know I will recall a few points of this book the next time I'm in a new social situation.
1616550414|5.0|I bought this as a Valentines gift for my Zelda fanatic of a husband. He has been like a kid in a candy store since it arrive yesterday.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absoulutly love this game!!! It is so addicting. It is like temple run but a million times better. The only bad thing a out thiss game is the adds. Every 2 seconds adds are popping up.
B00AJLHUAS|1.0|What in the world was Ferry thinking? This CD simply has the worst sound quality of my over 1000 CD's!!! It is HORRIBLE...if you value any sound quality over that of a tin can...DON'T BUY THIS!! I wish I hadn't!!! Heed what some reviewers are saying!! This is not authentic in any way, back in the day of origin it would have sounded wonderful when played live, why not capture that the way we now can?? JUNK!!!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great fun!  Good graphics! A good mix of hidden object and puzzles. Love G5 games!!  Hope to see more games like this soon.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I like watching the series and currently own all made. Will watch it over and over again. Good sci-fi show

B009JBZH54|5.0|I purchased this after Christmas at a great price.  This is a great collection that I'll be watching multiple times.  It has hours of extra material that I'll probably never even get around to watching.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|I started to click each star<br />I will recomend Amazon to my family<br />I loved this music and play it every morning as I go to work
B007SGM084|5.0|I could not put this trilogy down.  Filled with excitement , intrege, as  well as erotic.  A touching as well as an insightful read.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|My friends an I all love this game. It is super addictive and really fun. I love how cute and friendly the dragons look, and all of the really cool possibilities. I think it is a great game to play, especially if you have friends that play.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Another great Grisham book.  It is well written, keeps you reading and is worth reading.  As always Grisham keeps you in suspense and engaged.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I type 20 or more words as a testament to the quality or deliciousness of the consumer good and/or media product.
B000TU16GS|5.0|This was a great book and it was very interesting.  I can't wait to read the next books in this series.
B008OOYALE|3.0|Decent game, gets repetitive, and has some annoying bugs (daily reward for playing, supposedly, but it triggers randomly...played for quite a while, every day, and have never gotten the 'day 2' reward, and the 'day 1' reward triggers about once a week, if that) If you are a big fan of peaceful Dragons, give it a shot... but be prepared to either spend real $, or have little chance at the rare Dragons.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I have extremely tiny ears and can never find headphones that fit in my ears. If I do find headphones that do fit I'm constantly messing with it to keep them in when I run.<br />I'm a runner and I high recommend these, sound quality good, and they adjust on the sides. I also lift, and every now and then fix them but not like any regular headphones that I had.<br />worth the price. I was actually surprised at how cheap they are.
B0053O89Z6|5.0|Neil Patrick Harris is one of the most underrated comedians of our time. He is the sole reason that I watch this show.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutely love this game! I was the first one in my school to play it because a friend from my other school introduced it and everyone in my school is addicted now, including myself!
B0088X7YMS|1.0|I don't know how the makers of this film managed to top Starship Troopers 2 in terms of poor writing and poor executing, but they did. First off, they promised the return of Casper Dean and Neil Patrick Harris. Both backed out last second, leaving the voice acting hollow and unnatural. The plot doesn't make sense and the story doesn't flow well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely love this book! I've read all three and saw the movie as soon as it came out! Would recommend to everyone!
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|My 6 year old loves playing the dragon games. It is nice to have a game I do not worry about showing blood and gutts.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|This game is awesome! I absolutely love it and I love that there are blades and wallpapers you can unlock through achievements! One of my favorite games!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love how in one touch of the screen I can check the weather! One downfall, it repeatedly is not available or down.

0143038095|5.0|Delivered on time and good reading! My daughter read this for her sophomore PAP class and really enjoyed it. It was a good read.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I thought this book would have a good story line but it didn't.  It was weird and I'm definitely not reading the other two.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Amazing book.  A truly addictive read. Captivating story, likable characters, great concept that anyone born in the 70's will adore.  Being a geek also helps the enjoyment and ratchets it up to another level.  The classic gaming and movie/tv references from my youth made me smile.  Make sure you have extra hours carved out to finish the book.  Once you get to level 2 it's hard to put down!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this website, so when I found out there was an android app for it I was very happy! The only thing is that I wish when you clicked on a page, it wouldn't open an internet page.
B00012QM8G|5.0|This is a movie that I would watch over again and again. Everyone should see this movie at least once
B004GYY714|1.0|I couldn't find reception and the songs were not good! Definitely love Pandora a lot more! It was quickly deleted.
B001C08RHA|5.0|Extremely entertaining and a movie you can watch over and over again (which my son does).  It is very well done!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I'm completely addicted to this game! I play it constantly.  The only thing is that there should be a way to earn hints, and not just through buying them.
1936608898|4.0|Interesting read. The book really breaks the nutrition down so that it is easy to understand. It would be better if they had a few more recipes for readers who aren't very imaginative.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is my absolute favorite game ever! I love everything about it and it's extremely addicting! Would recommend to everyone!
0525953728|5.0|Very quick read. Puts you there, as the author recounts the actions of brave men and the operations they conduct.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I absolutely love this game! It's so addicting and I played it the whole way through in like 2 days.
B008NBEXZQ|5.0|How can you ever go wrong with Celine Dion. This album is flawless and magnifique. I do not speak French but her connection is Majestic. That is why she is Celine Dion, the greatest singer. It is  a MUST buy for a Celine lover, and/or even for someone who has passion to listen to an artistry of music. I definitely love listening to this album. Extra feature a beautiful 2013 calendar inside the CD. I love Aurore d'Estaing illustrations, so classy, fun, and elegant.
B007TXN4TK|1.0|didn't work very good on the kindle fire hd. was very disappointed with it. I deleted it from my kindle
B00447G29S|5.0|We have made it a Christmas tradition to watch the 2D video every Christmas. Now we have the 3D version which we played for the first time Cristmas 2012. WOW it is great. Look forward to playing it for grandchildren and passing on the tradition. The 3D version is breathtaking. Our entire family recommends it.
B00A757EFW|1.0|just not happy with this app at all. kind of hard to use on the kindle fire hd. I deleted it
034580404X|5.0|These  DVD's show some of the different side of life and love, and  what could be.if you only might dare
B00BC3IKWE|4.0|Total Life Forever is one of my all time favorite albums and Holy Fire is an excellent follow up. In my opinion, Holy Fire is actually a better album overall because where Total Life Forever's second half is stacked with quite a few lackluster tracks, all the tracks on Holy Fire rate from solid to amazing.<br /><br />This album is more poppy and melody-heavy than their previous albums, but they do a good job of injecting their trademark math-y playing style into each song to flesh them out. It gives all the tracks a layered and frenetic undercurrent that prevents the album from ever devolving into the average stale pop driven rock. This album is pure Foals, but broader and more mature.<br /><br />Holy Fire doesn't reach the dizzying heights of excellence that Total Life Forever did with tracks like \\"Spanish Sahara\\" and \\"Blue Bloods\\", and those unmatched heights will keep TLF at the top as my favorite Foals album. However, Holy Fire is a *very* close second.

1475143389|5.0|Really good book, packed with lots of useful information. Great nutrition advice. Excellent workout plans. Mike knows his stuff, and he's happy to share the knowledge and makes himself available to his readers via email/social networks. Very solid overall philosophy and approach to nutrition and weight-training.<br /><br />Can't argue with his success. There's really just one point I can't agree with and will have to investigate further for myself. He says soy is a bad protein source - but there's just too much evidence to the contrary out there - especially if you can find a reputable non-GMO brand (I get mine from the #1 natural nutrition company in the US). I use both soy and whey protein supplements (same brand) - and I've seen great results in the short time that I've been back into lifting. Now that I'm not lifting like a wussy (light weights, many reps) anymore, I expect to see even greater gains.<br /><br />He does promote heavy lifting (heavy weights, few reps), but older guys or guys just getting into or back into lifting might want to spend a few weeks at minimum to get to know their abilities and get over the awkwardness before jumping right into heavy lifting - so glad I did.<br /><br />This book is a must for any guy looking to build muscle - smart, thoughtful, safe approach to getting bigger, stronger, and leaner.

030758836X|5.0|I think I might have met someone that is certifiably insane. Not just a little insane but all the way cuckoo. So crazy that I want to get out of her head right now, rinse myself off, and then down some sort of medication to ease the pain that is building up like a ball of wax.<br /><br />And just when I thought I had everything figured out, I found myself traveling on a different elevator, headed to a different destination, and in the opposite direction. I realized I knew nothing. Possibly even less than nothing. It's like a light switch was suddenly flipped on, and I discovered I was standing in a bedroom when I thought I was standing in the living room, and in my underwear, no less.<br /><br />Without saying too much, I wouldn't read this book if I planned on getting married. Ever. And since I'm already married, I might start sleeping with the nightlight on, even though I've never been a nightlight kind of guy. It's that good. Literally.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn has human psyche nailed to perfection: those dark places that no one ever wants to talk about or visit, those demons that are stuffed in a closet, duct taped from head to toe, and then tied to a chair. It freaked me out, because it felt so real, and was as real as any piece of fiction I've ever read.<br /><br />If you like dark, psychological fiction, then you'll want to snap this book up faster than a piece of Ghirardelli chocolate. Just make sure to leave the lights on while reading.<br /><br />Robert Downs<br />Author of Falling Immortality: Casey Holden, Private Investigator
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I loved this book, and this was also another book that I ordered for my Kindle, the price was great as usual.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I absolutely loved this, and looked foreward to getting back to it, as one does with a good book.  I'm a bit perturbed, however, that &#34;they&#34; are playing games with the release of season 2.  I would highly recommend this to anyone, and have loaned it to two people at this point, with a third waiting. I watched &#34;The Forsyte Saga&#34; last yr., which was my first introduction to Damian Lewis.  He was such a cad in that, that I thought I would hate him in anything else I saw him in.  Well......He hasn't disappointed....at least so far.
0345803485|5.0|This was ordered for my daughter in law also for Christmas, and the price was great and it arrived quickly.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|Nothing to scream, hoop and holla about.  It was what it was and nothing more.  If you are bored and wondered if your missing something....take a change a watch it.
0345803493|5.0|My daughter-in-law is a big reader and this is all she wanted for Christmas, and it arrived at the time it was supposed to and that is a plus to me.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I'm not a big Denzel Washington fan, I respect him but I wouldn't break my neck to run to his movies.  This movie BLEW me away.  Brilliant movie..... and I will bow down and say he is a wonderful actor!  So worth seeing!  Enjoy!
B001BN1ZHW|5.0|I love music, any kind of music, from every country and culture, always have, played music for over thirty years. But I just can't stand musicals, can't stand them. Guys and Doll, Music Man, Grease, Evita, it doesn’t matter, their stupid. However, this is a completely different story. I bought the DVD, Blu-ray, and soundtrack. Great concept, directing, acting, and the songs are fantastic. Who knew Johnny Depp could sing.
B00AE2I4WK|5.0|You seen one dance movie... you've kinda sorta seen them all.  Wonder what it would be like to have a black or latin lead?  LOVE the soundtrack!  it's worth buying!
B009329ZF2|3.0|Well, it has many big boats, visitors from space, a beautiful blond, big guns, lots of bombs, even more explosions, lots of slow motion stuff happening, and a handsome hero. What more do you need?
B009NQKPUW|1.0|I could have lived the rest of my days happy and not watching this movie.  Love the cast......and that was it.  Wasn't really worth making, IMHO.  If it a free view and you have NOTHING happing in you life..... go ahead and watch it. (or clip your toenails instead)  lol
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Easy read; a little slow at points but well worth the read. I would definitely recommend if you're a Nicholas sparks fan.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|...........the whole movie you are waiting for some seriously crazy stuff.  Left me limp....until the last 45 mins of the movie.  So if you have nothing to do...... phase in and out...and then wake up for the ending!<br /><br />enjoy!
0375869026|5.0|This was a random choice for me and I could not have been happier. Such a fantastic read that makes you really think. It was emotional, funny and heart warming. Everyone not just kids should read this story and maybe the world can be a better place.<br /><br />One of the best books I have read in years!!
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|Okay I love the video games.  Loved the first movie.  Now I just yawn and ask, &#34;WHY.&#34;  I feel that they have lost sight of what the video game was all about and they are just making a movie to be a DVD.  Love the cast............. the movie was like, &#34; I'm going to the bathroom,&#34; as you returned... you haven't miss and a dang gone thing.  NOR do you care to rewind.....lol<br /><br />It meant well but I hope this is the last one.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|Ah man, just finished reading it and all I can think about is re-reading it! Absolutely fantastic, with a great sense of humor. I can see why it's a cult classic! I just wish i'd gotten to it sooner!
B007REV4T8|5.0|Daniel Craig was magnificent in this  film.  I think that this is his best James Bond to date.  Casino Royal was good but this is  the best
0345803507|5.0|Fifty Shades Freed, Book Three<br /><br />Loved the story and the characters. Well written<br />and spell binding. The Book two was also good.
B00006GFAB|5.0|What is there  not to like about Kiss.  They bring it to the stage and albums all the time.  They are great artist and bringers of true good old Rock and Roll
0345803493|5.0|Fifty Shades Darker: Book Two was a continuation<br />of the story of two people, both very messed up.<br />She was like a child, wanting to know everything<br />at once.  Kept me interested on how it would turn out.
B00004WEJZ|4.0|I have been a James Bond fan since Dr. Know came out.  Through the years I have seen all of them and have the DVD collection.  Never Say Never Again was one of the DVDs I did not have and I saw it on Amazon and  ordered it.  It came within the week I ordered and I played it when I got it.  The movie ran perfectly.  Although Never Say Never is not one of the best, it does complete my collection.  The seller  was great and I had a wonderful experience with my purchase.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I got this app and it was really fun.... until it started to not work. it just stopped working after I played it three times. but it was fun. until it stopped working.
B0015DROBO|4.0|This book had me on the edge sometimes and some of it was a little graphic compared to what I usually read but I liked it.
B008H6GH8I|5.0|This was a fairly good foray into the &#34;Resident Evil&#34; universe. These animated or CGI movies pay more attention to the actual gaming characters then the Alice character created for the movies. So continuity wise they would fit with the games then the movies. This movie arrived really fast and was packed extremely well.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|This game is a cute game with great graphics, so I gave it an average 3 stars. It simply isn't my style of game and it is hard for me to figure out what to do. There are no directions. Maybe there shouldn't be. If I was a kid, I could probably just know what to do with it. It does have some crude drawings that I still couldn't follow. Guess I am too dense. But the Angry Birds game did have moving illustrations, and I could figure that one out, so who knows?
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book was incredible.  Colleen Hoover's ability to get you in the character's head and feel every emotion is incredible.  This book was sweet, but real.... She didn't compromise the characters by doing what would make you the reader \\"feel better\\".  She was true to the character's nature that she had created and to what the real world consequences would be to certain actions.  I am completely blown away by this book and would recommend it without hesitation!
B003MC5N28|5.0|I must confess, I bought this book to test out my Kindle's ability to play talking books. I must say for this book at least, the audio is abysmal. There are a female and a male voice, and neither has any inflection at all. Well, I know the audio works, but don't care to use it.<br /><br /> As for the book itself, it was quite good. It is about a society where the highest aim is to be like everyone else, dress like everyone else, eat what everyone else does, and except for occupation, to do exactly what everyone else does. And you don't pick out your own occupation or your own mate or your own children; the state does it for you. Communism on steroids.<br /><br />Sounds dreary and it is, for a while. The young protagonist starts to see things most don't, starts to feel uneasy about it, and in the end, he goes off on his own to try to find a better place. There is a lot more I didn't tell you, and it IS a good book.
B0087EVHVW|5.0|don't bother spending the extra money on a i7 quad this one is more than you need unless you are a serious rendering fan. All games at max FPS runs like a clock and super fast. play a game listen to music and burn a cd all at the same time with little to no effect on FPS.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|this game is so much fun I love that u can mix so much things like lava and I think that it is so much fun
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I enjoyed every page, event, feeling, experience. Wow! Absolutely brilliant. I recommend this book to everyone! Male or female. Brilliant
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is so fun! I love to play it in my free time and really enjoy getting all the dragons leveled up! I 100% recommend this amazing game! :D
B005G4TJUC|5.0|my son loves this movie and thanks for the on time and it was in great shape thanks again  /
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Love it so much that I've been listening to it every day, several times a day. Taylor Swift has really poured her emotions into making this album. It runs all gamuts of emotion.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|this movie was so funny it was in great shape it was on time and  everyone love the movie thanks gain
