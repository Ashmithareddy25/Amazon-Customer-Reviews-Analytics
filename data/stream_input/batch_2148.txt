B007MDB6L0|5.0|My granddaughter and I watch it all the time. We both love it and recommend it! It's a great movie to share with a little girl.
B009MCRHH6|3.0|i'm not really a good person to rate this cause i am not very good at video games.  i did try and play it a couple of times but failed so miserably, that i have stopped trying...maybe i'm too old.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|temple run 2 rocks its fun a little hard but fun there is only one thing if you get it on the kindle fire after a few days it crashes but all you have to do is reinstall it other than the it awesome way better than the 1st one
B008MEM24S|4.0|where's my Perry is a very entertaining game.I just don't like how you have to pay like two bucks for extra levels
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great job of porting over this old classic !!<br />I recomend this app ,great way to pass a little time.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I love books about the underdogs.  Mr Grisham's heroes always come out on top.  The book is funny, but you learn a lot also.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|A story about life, purpose, faith, memories and meaning. Intuition can be so good for the soul. A great read.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|i am not on facebook cause i don't need everyone to know ANYTHING about me.  BUT i am on yellow book!!
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|ok so whenever I power down on the app its self and then turn it back on its screen turns black and when I exit it doesn't let me get back on!!! so frustrating
B0044XV3R8|5.0|The directors cut was a great addition to the film.  It wasn't just gratuitous visuals.  the added scenes gave weight to the film as a whole.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This set arrived promptly and was perfect!! I missed season 1 and watched this whole season in 2 days. Love it!!
B009IF82SK|5.0|funniest sitcom ever made. Sheldon makes the show great and also Penny and Bernadette are not bad on the eyes either
B005MYEPXC|5.0|Normally I'm not a big Woody Allen fan but this was a well written story and it did NOT include Woody in a role.  As someone interested in art and literature, I found the actors portraying the artists and authors were well suited for their parts and played them beautifully.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven is the kind of novel that captures your imagination and you can't put it down. There is enough action and intrigue to keep you captivated throughout. This book keeps the reader in suspense until the final page.
B0017SWSCW|5.0|A friend introduced me to Jeffrey Archer in an airport one day.  I have read many of his books since that day.  This book was another well written novel by a great story teller.  I will continue to read books by this author.  The characters are real, intelligent and full of life, it is like experiencing a journey with a good friend.
B001LXIDVS|5.0|Fun to watch the Back to the Future movies with my kids.  They seem to enjoy them as much as I did back in the day.
B0040I09RM|5.0|My friend had told me about this show a few years back as she became addicted to it from the beginning. I had been wanting to watch it and finally got around to doing so. I absolutely love it! The story lines are great and the actors are fabulous! I highly recommend this series.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|This is a excellent album no matter what. If you are a Josh Groabn fan you will definitely love this album. It's a really beautiful album.
0525952926|4.0|To take the vast topic of happenings during the century is daunting at best.  As Follett did in his first volume, he was able to take a world view of events and develop them using fictional characters.  He gives a real feeling of conditions during these times.<br /><br />If you were to use &#34;The Pillars of the Earth&#34; as the standard for Follett's historical novels, this wouldn't quite reach that level.
0062200399|5.0|My daughter loved this book! Would definitely recommend this to a friend. It was a great addition to my daugher's collection
B00846F1YW|5.0|great search game. you go through it quickly but there are lots of stages in the storyline. so you definitely get your moneys worth. I would recommend it to anyone and would pay $3
B004N6369Y|5.0|This is a great book, well if you are a fan of Danielle Steel, every one of her books is great.  Whatever one I am reading at the time becomes my new favorite.  This is another favorite, and typical Danielle Steel.  Does anyone write relationships and dialoge between people like Ms. Steel?  Great story, i really cared about all the characters, which is the gift that Ms. Steel gives us time after time.
B004QIG7CW|5.0|One of the few items on my daughter's list, this was a hit. It was also very easy to load to her iPod.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is my new favorite British drama. An excellent period piece that stimulates the senses and excites the same. Acting and costumes is excellent.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Not merely the best documentary of 2012, dare I say the best movie, period. As unique, unforgettable, and poignant a film as you're ever likely to experience.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is so amazing its addicting. Forget about temple run when u get this game. Love it love it love it!!!!!!!!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was one of the best new books for kindle i have read.  You can really get into the character and how he continues to overcome adversity in the face of almost certain death.  The human element is critical to this story.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I used a lot of note writing apps on my Amazon Kindle Fire HD Tablet, but Evernote is the best!  Why?  I seen great reviews of it online, I can edit, create, and delete my notes whenever I want to; the site is simple to use, and it is so much fun!  If you are looking for a note taking app, Evernote is the one for you!
B001NBEWN6|4.0|Though I had to read this book for a class I was taking, I would read this book again and again for myself. Arundhati Roy tells a story about real life that is unlike any other I've read.
B002WN35DC|3.0|Lo baje para leer con mi hijo pero aun no se entusiasma, hubiese esperado mas dibujos y que fuera mas ilustrativo
B003CRM6QO|5.0|Colors and sound pop from the Blu-ray like I had never seen on television or the old VHS. Extremely impressed at how vibrant this film is.
B0042JTDXK|4.0|I enjoyed this album, but not quite as much as some of the earlier ones.  However, he continues to be one of my favorite singers.
B00881VLCE|4.0|these puzzles are cool. I played for 4 hours the fist day I downloaded it. I love how you can choose the difficulty of each puzzle.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I read most of Follett's books and I liked them all.<br />This however is a wonderful book: very nice storyand intrigues, historically about right.<br />I'm looking forward to n).3 of this trilogy.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|The movie dragged on.but i have to admit he had me.it ended different where i thought it was going.the truth set him free.
B00000IQW5|5.0|Arrived on time, in good shape, wonderful date movie will use this vendor again.  Thanks for asking, keep up the great work.
B005LAJ17M|3.0|This is an awesome series, but my review rating concentrates primarily on the Blu-ray version over the DVD version. While I don't have the DVD 4-disc version, I would anticipate it would be an easier version to view. The 3-disk Blu-ray version loads slowly on my relatively new and updated Blu-ray player. If you have an older player, it may load even slower or you may need to update your player.
B005X5XIL0|5.0|Adrea Bocelli at his glamous and talented best. I would rather see him in the comfort of my surround sound theater at home. You are closer than any concert you could buy tickets. To go see in person. So unless I am going to meet him in person, I will continue to buy and watch his best concerts in the comfort of my family room.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I loved this book. The characters are so twisted and narcissistic that you almost hate yourself for enjoying the book so much.  I have read a lot of &#34;easy reading&#34; books from many of the most popular authors.  Many of these books contain a decent story but the writing is sub-par. Gillian Flynn certainly breaks the mold; her writing was interesting and captivating. I particularly enjoyed her extremely creative similes and metaphors.  I can't wait to read her other books
B001MSMULG|4.0|This was  a fun entertaining book to read. I love spy books an  this is my first about Massad. Can't wait  to read the rest of the Allon series
B0089XH38M|5.0|Have used on other electronics and have never had a problem, Would recommend it to others. Aiso like that it is free but still provides protection.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|just so I could drop use 4.9 on this book. I've read all of Rankin and, with maybe the exception of McBain he writes the best. I'd only drop .1 for the abrupt and complete end. Which probably actually matches the end of most real cases, but dang, I missed Rebus's angst over how his cases were never quite complete.
B0092QITO2|4.0|This is a much-improved story over the original Arnold tale. Great action and acting; a story that moves quickly and seamlessly. As this film had great action scenes, it would have been great to release in Blu-ray 3D.
B00127RAJY|5.0|this is a great workout! the whole workout is only 20-25 minutes and really gets you going! i have all her videos!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an amazing game but it is Mainly for older children between 7- whatever age but this game is very hard for younger people when my friends children that are 4 and 6 and found it really hard trying to figure it out
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Sad ending, but overall great book.<br /><br />I love how Nicholas Sparks has a  great mixture of love, mystery, thriller running through each of his books.  This was no deviation from his normal writing.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I am a mahjong fan and have enjoyed this version. It is simple which is good since I am a senior citizen. Would recommend it to other seniors.
B0000TB050|5.0|I want to see a concert at this venue!  The backdrop with the castle is awe inspiring!  Simply breath taking!  Cheers!
B0091ICDHU|4.0|Loved the poetry and emotion - def moved me. Some of the thought processes going on were quite repetitive though
B0015AARJI|5.0|We got it cheap because it was black friday. works great, just as expected. great value for the money. Its just another playstation 3 controller.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Good game. Excellent graphics. Easy to use. Love all the g5 games I have played so far. Some have many search and find puzzles in them. But overall fun games.
B000KMB5DE|5.0|Yes--get THIS book and THIS copy while you can.  This is the original translation by Katherine Woods which is the ONLY version to read....  I mean it--don't even bother reading the new translation by that 'guy'.  If you can, grab a few copies...<br />and give them away.  This book is a treasure.  ~DMM
0321344758|5.0|A very important read for web designers. Outlines the importance for a clean and clear design and offers helpful tips to implement them.
B00APUQT7I|4.0|That poor little rodent is still at it.  He's got so many problems but he pushes on and never gives up.  The rest of the &#34;herd&#34; is still there plus the addition of Grannie who is just too funny to miss out on.  Get the movie.  Entertain yourself.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|Dragging, presumptive writing that made you feel that the author  found another 'something' to tie his ends to his boring middle to end of his so called story.  I was disappointed i the premise and the ending. So Sorry
B002TLSSXO|5.0|I still havent seen a more nice looking utensil set. I am really proud of these, i use em daily and every time I remember how good they look =).
B0094BB4TW|4.0|it helps me keep in touch with my kids and grandkids. dont like the ever changing stuff when i get used to it you all change it but im hanging in there
B004GYY714|5.0|very easy to use with an enormous selection of options . ---- -- -- --- -- ---- -- --  - -
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is a good time consuming game. But, it's not as good as the orginal. Only because every run is just about the same. The orginal had different settings just about every time. And the Monkeys, well let me tell you....It reminds me of an ex boyfriend uuuuggghhh. The original ones are at least kinda cute. All-in-all it's a good game.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|I enjoyed the movie but it's definitely for the little guys.  I did enjoy it but I'm easy to please.  Buy it for the kids.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I chose the rating because of your choice of adjectives  I liked it  to love it is another thing!!!!<br />For anyone interested in life of the 50's and 60's it is well researched and right on.  It's an interesting story, keeps one into it and very readable.  Narrated like a conversation.  I recommended it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game, have it on my iPhone. I play it to get stress release. Play at least once a day.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Good stuff, Keeps me up to date on the weather around me so i can plan my day and evenings.
B009RH973I|5.0|This little case has saved my Kindle from damage on numerous occasions.  My grandchildren have used the Kindle with supervision and still managed to drop it on occasion.  The case has protected my Kindle.  I strongly recommend if you are going to buy a case to protect your Kindle, you should buy this one.  They come in several colors and work very well.  You can use your Kindle case as a stand-up or tuck the screen protector with the band.  Really convenient to use.
1452101248|5.0|Ottolenghi continues to make cook books which are excellent, his recipes and love of food are obvious it is a journey of love and I am glad I am taking it with him..... delicious , beautiful and exciting.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great story.  The characters are wonderful and they each have a unique addition to the story. Currently watching Season 3 and already looking forward to Season 4.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game is a cube shaped form of Mahjong. You can rotate the cube to see all sides and look for matches. I find it to be very entertaining.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love to read the bible, but when I cannot open a bible I can always put my ear buds in and listen to it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love looking at the different things and ideas. im a craft person and the things every body put on here is great.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|When dealing with high-end gear, saving a few dollars for a third party part is not advisable.  This adapter worked right away and I don't think I'll have to worry about it ever.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|As always, cons first.<br />1. They could have done with combining an enchanted Gwen episode in that particular arc.<br />2. There were some unanswered plotholes. The fisher king?<br />After that..<br />AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH<br />The actors were perfect. I have never come across a TV show with such great actors. All of them, even the minor characters had chemistry. *spoilers. You have been warned*<br />1.The Reveal was perfect. Arthur (James) and Merlin (Morgan) did it so well. Words cannot express how great that scene was.<br />2. Most people were expecting to get out their keyboards and flame away at the new actor who played Mordred. However, from the minute he stepped out, nobody had a complaint. Just like everyone else he played a very complicated character to perfection and headed up the nailbiter episode of the season-5x11. That episode made us all want to strangle the closest cute thing in reach. We were too bust crying our way through 5x13 to do any nail biting in THAT episode.<br />3. The finale. C'mon guys, we knew it would end that way. ALL shows to do with Arthurian legend do, although a little more closure would be nice.<br />4. There were so many awesome moments.<br />\\"I don't need a sword\\"<br />dang. I mean, we got to see Merlin throw Uthers ghost through a wall. You know you were cheering.<br />5. 5x09. There are no words. THE DOLMA!!!! Kudos to the actors not laughing their heads off trying to film that.<br />6. Dragoon makes everything better.<br />Overall, just watch them. So good, but so sad. We get mad because we love it so much!
B003DZX3SA|5.0|One of Disney's best with lessons to be learned no matter your age. And I got the movie 3 days faster than estimated.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Very efficient app. Tells you how much time you have left to read, browse the web, and listen to music. I like it.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Husband has not seen this movie. Once we sat and watched it together he really enjoyed it. Good to have.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|It's extremely bright and can lower the brightness.the settings are easy to understand, and their simple.it works great for me.
B001EC3JME|4.0|I use this with my UltraFire WF-501b and it fits like a damn glove! It's like this case was made specifically for that light, but a TON of lights can fit in this thing.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Secure elastic keeps the light snug<br />- Open bottom allows for the light to be operated while in the case<br />- 8-position locking belt clip allows you to aim the light any way you want while its on your belt so you can use it as a work light if you forget your head-light<br />- It absolutely WILL NOT become accidentally unhooked from your belt, ever.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- There is a slight \\"break-in\\" period, I.e., its a little tough to get a light into it when it's fresh from the package but gets a lot better after some use.<br />- The belt clip is designed in such a way that it makes it impossible for it to slip off your belt unintentionally, but it also makes it a little difficult to remove it when you actually want to! Takes some fiddling to get it off, but I'd say that's worth it for a holster that isn't going to fall off and doesnt require you to remove your whole belt to remove the holster.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|I purchased this book based on the reviews. There's four bucks I'll never see again.  I'm not familiar with the author or other work.  I just read the reviews and everyone raved about how wonderful this book was.  I have to say, I just don't get it.  Most of the plot of this book is SO depressing that I could hardy make myself read it.  The rest of it is so far fetched that I don't see how it got through the editing process.  I finished the book just to see if there would be any redeeming quality to the overwhelmingly sad, and just when you think it can't get any sadder story...But, NO, not really.  I spent so much time feeling sorry for the characters in this story and wondering why the author would put them through so much.  Not a fan of this book at all!
1593272790|5.0|The style is very refreshing, lots of inspiring ideas. A great read! Not for those that require detailed step-by-step instructions.
B005KAJPY2|5.0|I love this album. I was skeptical at first. Most bands that come out with an album years later usually no good, but this is the exception. V N V Nation has been one of my favorites for years. As a fan, I definitely suggest this album.
B009J2VR52|5.0|... is definitely worth the price. I suggest spending the extra money for the import version. There is a lot more value due to the extra tracks.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I thought this book was great. I think it can help people who feel lost in the world. I never would have predicted the ending either.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|This is one my son's favorite films. He watched this DVD as much as 20 times in the first week after I bought it!  So needless to say, the product was delivered as promised, in super condition.  Very entertaining and enjoyable for the whole family!
B005G4TJUC|5.0|Collecting the trilogy. DVD, as always was just like new. Enjoying it and looking forward to owning the other epics
1593272782|5.0|The style is very refreshing, lots of inspiring ideas. A great read! Not for those that require detailed step-by-step instructions.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I choose 5 stars because of its adventures and responsibility. It's not the real thing and I should know, but it's close enough.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I cannot find anything wrong with this album. From it's opening track &#34;Brave&#34; until the end of the album the music on this CD flow meticulously. Josh's best album to date.
B0063GORYU|5.0|i love it great easy to play no priblem easy  downloading will download more free games in the future good day
B003V1WTMM|4.0|Although this is not my favorite of her books, i found the story quite compelling. Pace was a little slow. Overall a good read; Ms. Morton does not disappoint.
B00AFEXRME|1.0|The DVD cover quotes TIME as saying \\"Flight Soars!\\" I would change that to say \\"Snores\\". The start of the movie is entertaining, but after the plane crashes just turn the movie off. The majority of the film is slow-paced and very boring. I had as much reason to root for the main character as I would for any other random drunk driver. If you want a fun Denzel \\"man vs. transportation\\" movie, watch \\"Unstoppable\\" instead.
1593272774|5.0|The style is very refreshing, lots of inspiring ideas. A great read! Not for those that require detailed step-by-step instructions.
B0001US8FI|5.0|This DVD collection was a gift for my father and arrived very quickly, on time, and in great shape.  I was extremely pleased with the price as well.  I would order from this seller again.  The gift was such a surprise for my dad and I am extremely pleased with the quality.  Thanks!!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I really enjoyed this series. The first book was slow, but the rest was great. This book was thebest of all of them. It kept me wanting to know more. Couldn't put it down. Read it in 11/2 days.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|I just bought all the seasons so I can watch them whenever I want. I couldn't be happier. :) Highly recommend.
B007HACDLK|5.0|One of his best, can't wait for his next book.  His books grabs you on the first page and does let go till the last word.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|Great music by Taylor Swift.  You can definitley hear her maturity in this album.  A must order for anyone who loves country!
B009OYSFDM|4.0|Interesting plot it reminds me of something else I've watched<br /> But can't think of what it is.  3 more words
B007Y4Z5LE|5.0|I Would not have it any other way great CD!!!! She blows me away I can related to every song
B005F9TQ9C|5.0|I just finished listening to Bob Dylan's \\"Self Portrait\\" & still love it after all the years since I first heard it (late '80s). Why? Because any album that is hated by so many for some of the most ridiculous reasons can't be all that bad. As one who owns a copy of each of Bob Dylan's albums from the first self-titled album to the current \\"Tempest\\", \\"Self Portrait\\" along with its predecessors \\"John Wesley Harding\\" & \\"Nashville Skyline\\" & especially its follow-up \\"New Morning\\" are favorites I never tire of. Another reason I like Bob Dylan & \\"Self Portrait\\" is he is not afraid to try different directions & challenge his audience. Whatever ridiculous \\"conspiracy theory\\" one might choose to \\"read into\\" the reason for the release of \\"Self Portrait\\" I think it is very simple. He didn't want to continue to re-record his most influential work over & over & just slap a new dust jacket & name on it. I really like Bob Dylan & his music for the same reason I really like the music of to name a few, Jeff Beck, John McLaughlin, Miles Davis, The Kinks, Fleetwood Mac, Jethro Tull, U2, Bill Connors, Steve Winwood, Genesis & John Coltrane. None of these artists got or get stagnant, aren't or weren't afraid to challenge their audience, & continue(d) to grow musically. How many could have predicted The Kinks that recorded \\"All Day & All Of The Night\\" would go onto to record \\"Celluloid Heroes\\"? Fleetwood Mac went from a hard rocking Chicago-styled blues-rock band featuring a three lead guitar/frontman with rhythm section line-up to a smooth, slick (sometimes too slick) top forty chick-rock band. My sister is a fan of the Buckingham-Nicks Fleetwood Mac lineup & she heard me playing a cd of Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac's late '60s blues-rock. She didn't believe me when I said it was Fleetwood Mac when she asked me what on earth I was listening to. Most music fans aren't aware the Fleetwood Mac that existed from 1968 to 1974 even existed. Fleetwood Mac's best material (my opinion) came fromthat time period & yet you NEVER hear it on commercial rock radio, especially \\"classic rock\\" radio. Miles Davis pioneered be-bop jazz in the '50s & early '60s, then went on to forge jazz-rock aka fusion in the late '60s & through the early '70s. He received even more derision for that than Bob Dylan received for \\"Self Portrait\\". John McLaughlin has played just about every conceivable style of music on both the acoustic & electric guitar, including an Indian/jazz hybrid. Jeff Beck is another who has done it all on his instrument & isn't afraid to try new things. What all of this boils down to is \\"Self Portrait\\" is hated & loathed because it wasn't what most had gotten used to & expected. Bob Dylan has released how many albums? If I wanted to hear \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\" or \\"Blonde On Blonde\\" ad infinitem through 40 or 50 some albums why would I buy the same album recorded over & over again? I would only have to buy it once. For those who like the same album repackaged over & over again please refer to AC/DC, Kiss, Bad Company, Slayer, The Eagles, or Aerosmith to name a few. \\"Self Portrait\\" is not perfect, but I would much rather hear an honestly made album that stands out in a large catalog than one that just blends in with all the others because there is no variety in the artist's catalog (AC/DC & Kiss have perfected this to the extreme). I recommend Bob Dylan's \\"Self Portrait\\" ONLY to those who aren't afraid to hear something different or not expected from a pioneering artist. You won't waste your money here. All others who want to hear only what \\"classic rock\\" radio & the music press think you should hear, stay away! You won't be able to handle this! (ha-ha!).<br />  Oh, & if you want to complain about a lack of paragraphing in this review, don't bother complaining. I won't care. The paragraph police are ridiculous too! (ha-ha!)
B00AFROVQC|1.0|Bad, bad, bad writing. The reviews at the top of the book description are all from other paranormal romance writers, a quid pro quo system, apparently. I hype your drivel, and you hype mine sort of deal. This book fails on multiple levels, the major failing being: the book stinks up the joint. I cannot tell you the specifics without ruining it for those intrepid souls who will still want to sip at this fountain of OMG, but at the end of the book a situation occurs and its resolution is totally ridiculous. The entire BOOK was ridiculous! Now for the parts of the book I DIDN'T like...
1609611543|4.0|Very interesting through first 50 pages, sounds like it may be truthful although many have shown weight loss with other zero carb plans. Need to finish the book and try being wheat free to test for myself.
B008NR90HQ|4.0|Perhaps no the best footage but it's always nice to see Gary play.  He really nails these tunes. A must for any fan but I'm guessing one or two plays will probably do it for you.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|I think this book had a lot of dignity. It really kept me hanging over my bed because it was so interesting. I just love this book! I chose this rating because it was really really good. I wouldn't say prefect because it's really old but it really is a big hit for today! I just absolutely loved it!!!!!!!!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like solitare. The game is fun and easy to play. I play it every day.  I mostly play it before bed to help me relax
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I find this to be a fascinating read.  I have not finished it yet, but I am sure I will.  This is a book of personal stories as well as history.
0805079831|5.0|Incredible, well written book. I like most Americans spent time working, providing for family in early 70's-80's and the news about Central and South American government upheavals was removed from my daily concerns. I recommend the book and say at least read Chapter 2 about our neighbors to the south and the history of our government/corporate influence which changed economic systems to a different insider club with great tragedy for many. I believe our government needs to support our corporate interests but not while forsaking morality for a false sense of stability.
B0072IVGZG|3.0|It's the cult and if you are a fan you will enjoy.  If your new to their music I don't think I would start here.
0199601348|3.0|I've come to appreciate the &#34;Very Short Introduction&#34; series as they are usually very informative and well written.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but I found this book much less enjoyable to read.<br /><br />Cartledge organizes his book by 12 cities, each representative of a period or place in ancient Greek history. I think I would've preferred the more traditional narrative that moves forward in time.  Neverthesless, that structure still could've worked for me but for the writing. I found it tedious. He loves his subject, and loves throwing in Greek words that no-one else would know, in the process forgetting that this is a &#34;short introduction&#34; designed to appeal to a broader audience than he normally addresses.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Loved it. Continuing the triumphs and failures...it reminds me of a serialized Legends of the Fall. I'm looking forward to the third season.
B003VANOFY|3.0|I picked this because I wanted a 7.1 surround sound headphones, and the price was a steal.<br />Pros:<br />-comfortable, can be worn for hours and hours with no pain.<br />-nice sound.<br />-nice microphone, works great on skype and other software that i've tried.<br />-not heavy.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-There is no channel options for wireless, meaning your router can interfere, making it unusable. This is the main issue with these headsets. Make sure you do your research before buying to know if you will have this problem.<br />-Sometimes there is a weird fuzzy noise. I can say this because I used two of these, and they both do the same thing. really annoying.<br /><br />Over all I would never buy them again, just going to use them till they break, and buy a better brand.
0064430227|2.0|This got great reviews so I tried it out. The illustrations are boring purple lines on white paper. We can't get past the first few pages in order to build up to the story. My 3 year old has never sat through it. Disappointed mommy.
B007N0REX6|4.0|I alway's like anything Slash is putting out.  It's always much better than you would think.  Miles voice get's on my nerves after a few songs.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Crikey it sure is a lovely show indeed!  What isn't there to like about it (other than Ms. O'Brien, of course)?
B006Z00M9I|2.0|The creepy factor has been replaced with the shock factor. However, nearly every other horror film uses the latter as its primary &#34;scare&#34; point. Thus, the interesting parts of the PA series are drastically minimized. What's more, it's rather obvious that the producers are revving up the Fonz' Norton to jump the shark due to the obvious limitations of security camera focused cinematography.
B00BHAVGQY|2.0|Hi everyone, this episode wasn't good and I didn't like the last one either, so hopefully they will better episode next week.
0395389496|5.0|Great story for the magic of christmas. This is a classic tale and must have for all kids and families.
B006CC0YB0|2.0|Like the other solo records, I tried and tried to get through it with something that really grabbed me.  Not so much.
1582701709|5.0|The secret is just fascinating. It helps bring greater  maening to my life. It is the book that opens my appetite for life's offerings and positives. It led me on the search for more of life's secrets. An Excellent book without question.
B009SJ3H8Q|4.0|The ending left a little to be desired, there was a whole lot going on in this season and I think they could have wrapped it up a little better.  Still a great series.
B001NLKT60|4.0|Very fast but no real resolution at the end.  I wasn't sure it was done.  Need to reread some parts.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|The remastering is great. The shows look like they were filmed 5 years ago instead of 45.  Lots of extras that are fun to watch. If you are any kind of trekie, you should get this. And I will probably be able to sell it used (after I watch them a time or 2) on ebay for more than they were new.
B00026YO36|2.0|Like the other solo records, I tried and tried to get through it with something that really grabbed me.  Not so much.
1416511946|3.0|Heroin addicts DO NOT sit around and journal. So understand going in that this is NOT a biography. It may be a good read, but accept it for what it is: fiction.
B004NELBPC|5.0|Some of the best variety of news and other entertaining reading departments I have seen. Even a Good News department.
B001I45UFC|5.0|This was a great book I lived it<br /> I liked it my dad liked it so yah<br />  Sincerely A.R.G. G.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I like movies that surprise me, and /or make me smile- this did some of both. It is worth watching.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I really enjoyed reading about the life people had to lead at that time in our history.  I thought the plot line was very creative in telling the story of how children, slaves, and women were treated during this time.  I had a hard time putting the book down.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Wonderful story taking on major issues about two people helping each other in surprising ways.  Suspensful and romantic at the same time.  Loved it!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is one of my favorites. Very detailed. Kept me hooked on. I never wanted to stop reading it.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|What else is there to say.  It goes on and charges my new Macbook Air perfectly.  Stays on too so it won't get lost.
B0056CUZRA|5.0|Lovedthe story line and  it kept my attention and interest all the way through. Interesting mixture of characters who grew throughout the book
B005IZLPKQ|3.0|It is 1945, and America is in the long, dark, night of the comic book soul.  Only a whirlwind tour through as many high-production movies as possible will save the day.<br /><br />It turns out, can you believe it, that the Nazis were more completely evil than we knew.  In a genuine surprise to Adolf Hitler (and don't you wish you also saw the look on his face when he saw it from his special, high-tech moving chair, hey hey!), a German ace has developed his own evil organization, Hydra, which audaciously makes the Roman, I mean Nazi salute with, get this, both arms, and this obviously makes them TWICE as completely evil as puny Hitler's henchmen.  (In the Broadway musical version, with choreography by \\"Hank\\" Himmler, they goose-step with both feet.  But that is not in this movie.)  They don't even say \\"Heil Hitler,\\" they say \\"Heil Hydra.\\"  That is how completely, and doubly, evil they are.<br /><br />The Uber-Red Red Baron has his own plans for world domination, and has kept all the wunderwaffen for himself, including stealth bombers (See Reality or Wonder Woman, whichever you prefer), pseudo-cyborgs (See that strange guy in Washington Square) in black space suits (see Star Wars), and the plan for attacking New York that even Adolf Hitler couldn't realize.  (The stealth planes with the curved-down wings are still secret however.  You're not even supposed to know about them either.  So keep your mouth shut.)  \\"Uber-Red\\" (see the Stargate Atlantis character \\"Oberoth\\") has been made into a super-soldier (See Stargate SG1) with the help of a German scientist who switched sides, so at last America stands a chance of having its own German scientist (See Ice Station Zebra).  Germany has all its wonder weapons, including, astonishingly, a super-powered square thingy (See the Star Trek Borg) and all America can do is use the German turncoat's uber-steroids to transform one, single, geek ultra-lite into one, beefcake, Greek hoplite (See Herodotus, but I think the book is better than the movie).<br /><br />Always keen to keep proper Capitalist priorities (See any Republican rage over \\"Freedom\\"), the US knows just what to do with a superhero: put him on a War Bonds dancing tour with crowds of thick-legged, tiny-breasted chorus girls, in an environment where nobody puts out, some kind of stupid boring Hell for Superheroes (See Cabaret, or just drive a cab on the night shift).  Meanwhile Big Red Baddie, acted by Hugo Weaving at the top of his craft playing supernatural elves (See the Lord of the Rings), moves to become Master of the Universe (See Frank Langela, at the top of his craft playing supernatural vampires in, in fact, Master of the Universe).  The recruiter is a soldier-girl named Carter (See Stargate SG1 again, that was where we learned that soldier-girls keep their genitals on the inside!), who hasn't yet thought of carrying even one riding crop.  Apparently you are expected to opt out of noticing that she has imperfect facial doubles and that her boobs get bigger as the movie progresses - obviously in this alternative universe, the Constitutional Amendment promising Equal Steroid Opportunity has finally passed, and hey, faces can be similar, right?  So what's your problem?<br /><br />Captain America has his own guys to recruit, including a Negro and a Frenchman (See Hogan's Heroes).  More of an action fighter than Batman and not as super-powered as Spiderman, Captain America, played by Chris Evans, is the stud David Duchovney wishes he was.  More intuitive than most evil types, Weaving's Red Skull is the apotheosis of makeup abuse (See Planet of the Apes).  But his metamorphosis into Redness is handled in an acceptably off-the-shoulder way.  (I really think I get major points for saying so cool a thing so incredibly well.)  In a cameo at the end Samuel L. Jackson \\"reprises his role as Nick Fury\\" (See Way Too Many Comic Book Movies), to explain why everything is so modern after Cap America wakes up in a hospital in a later era ofhistory than he crash-landed into in the act of saving New York at the end of his mission, and just when we think Cap's going to begin to figure things out and show signs of Capgras Syndrome, because the nurse doesn't quite look enough like his girl, this doesn't actually happen, because some smart film executive decided to make a plot theme out of the imperfect doubles.  (Probably only the Hydra fists were perfect doubles.)  (And the Goose-stepping feet in the Broadway musical that you claim you didn't know about.)  So Cap can't be surrounded by fakes of his familiars, they aren't them, they only look like them, right?  As Nick Fury, Jackson apologizes for the crazy drama, and that makes everything all right.  And I really hope this review closes the file on my interest in the First Avenger.  With the right steroids, any of us could be one.
0307887448|5.0|I am not an avid reader at all...most of my books are biogrophies or non-fiction...books about The Brady Bunch, Gilligans Island, Little Rascals...and bookss about the top grossing fils of all time...all pop-culture stuff.  I heard about this book, and my wife, who reads all the time, told me to give it a try.  And I am glad I did.  I couldnt put this down.  Took me about a week to finish, and I could have finished in one night if I didnt have to go to work...the story was great, suspensful, funny, heartwarming.  The pop culture references were hysterical, even if I didnt get ALL of them.  I was a child of the 70's and 80's so I really enjoyed the homage to some of my favorite things.  It really played up my alley.  If your not into reading, but love pop culture stuff, this book would be perfect for you.  Now if I can oly get some recomendations for other books similar...!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like this game so much it's fun for me even with<br />Pocketinvedider you can  there is an butt o n that says edit inventory<br />With different stuff like stone, cobblestone, and others that you might<br />Need in minecraft pocket edition

B004UJAOLM|4.0|This story was much more engrossing than I originally expected.  There were times when I couldn't put it down.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone, even those that don't usually enjoy classic literature.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|This is the second last Harry Potter movie in the series. It stars Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson. It is one of the best movies in the series. I highly recommend it to all Harry Potter fans.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This game has great variations of puzzles. Easy to use. Good fun. My daughters love it. Best seen on a tablet, but a phone is easily managed.

B0019FOC5E|5.0|If you liked the Movie or just like the music of ABBA - this is definitely for you!  Recommend it!
0385333846|4.0|This is an odd book. I finally read it a month back, and enjoyed it a great deal. I suppose there are two possible interpretations of the plot: a slightly magical interpretation and a mundane one.<br /><br />In either case, the book follows the reminiscences of Billy Pilgrim, who was a hapless young recruit to the US Army in WW2, swiftly becoming a hapless young prisoner of war in Dresden, surviving the firebombing of the city by sheer luck, going home, training as dentist, getting middle aged, and surviving a head injury in a plane crash. From his daughter's viewpoint his head injury unhinges him slightly and makes him have worrying hallucinations about travelling through time. From his viewpoint they aren't hallucinations, and he has always had them: throughout his life he has sometimes, without warning, jumped through time to a different point in his own existence, and then jumped back. Not only that but he has been kidnapped by aliens and kept in a zoo on their home planet. Is Billy right, or is he a damaged and deluded individual? We'll never know.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|This movie is one of the best Harry Potter movies. It stars Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson. It is the final movie in the Harry Potter series.  This movie pack has a blu-ray and DVD disc. I highly recommend this movie to all Harry Potter fans!
B005HSG3VK|4.0|I love this case. It is super slim so it takes up little to no extra room while traveling. Its lightweight and the stand on it is very nice. My only complaint is you can only use the stand on a horizontal axis, not vertically.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I dont hate you pinterest ...... I just hate the new update for you. Why does it keep force closing over and over again?! Please fix this in the next update. Before the update it was perfect. Now... sadly not so much. But I will forever love you pinterest. :) &lt;3
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This is a good game but it is not the most fun game I have played that is what I think of this game.
B000FS9FC6|5.0|This awesome and for the price, you can't beat it. Plays clear and was sent as if I bought it from a big box retail store. Would order dvds from sender again.
B009P5S11G|5.0|Love the instinct download giveaway!!!  Was available right away so I didn't even have to wait for the CD to arrive.

B007KOYEOC|3.0|Read the first one to see what the fuss was over. Only read the last one to find out The main character's background. Not a great book, but alright. I wouldn't read it if you are into great literature.
B002RVCD46|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like the effect of watching such an epic movie on a small screen, but it looked great!
B009O5CLZY|4.0|This game can be addicting. I enjoy the different levels but wish Sven could do more tricks. Has provided hours of entertainment.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|It is a fantastic album full of fantastic music! Special thanks to Jon Schmidt. Because of him i play now  the piano.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|It was a good game. Kept me thinking. Good graphics. Keep up the good work. Need more games like these.
B004XZR63M|4.0|It is a very useful reading, not only for materially-oriented people, but also for those who think money should not be the center of their lifes.
B00338QENI|5.0|our book club reads all kinds of books from new fiction, classics and current new fiction. This one was a hit.
1594744769|4.0|I'm going to try to get through this without any spoilers, guys. I do realize I'm probably the last person on the planet to read this, so worrying about spoilers is silly, BUT, just in case...<br /><br />This book follows Jacob Portman. At the beginning of the book, we meet Jacob and his eccentric Grandfather.  Abe, the grandfather, has spent Jacob's entire life telling Jacob fantastical stories about his youth. As Jacob gets older and starts to doubt in these stories, Abe's Alzheimer's disease advances and the family attributes his odd behavior to his Dementia.  It is quite touching and to, me, someone who's own grandmother has advanced Alz, very sad.  A very unfortunate accident sets this story and Jacob on a quest to find out the truth about his grandfather's past.<br /><br />I loved the cast of characters we get to meet in this story.  Each of them, even the bad ones,  felt fleshed out.  Their personalities and behaviors all felt \\"right\\" for the lives and experiences they each have endured in their lifetimes.  Abe, the grandfather, reminded me so much of my Pap.  Jacob and the way he almost idolized his grandfather, and his stories.  Emma and Miss Peregrine, I can't imagine them any other way than the way they were written.<br /><br />This book felt so different to anything I've read before.  Ransom Riggs used random \\"odd\\" photos he had collected, and crafted a story around them.  He used the photos to reinforce the story in the readers mind.  What it did was help build, somehow, a stronger connection between me (the reader) and the characters in the story.  It helped make them \\"real\\".  Photos aren't like illustrations, someone didn't imagine them and then draw them - they are real people, not imaginary.  The story fabricated around them may be a work of fiction, but the photos allow the mind to wonder, for however short of a time, \\"what if\\".  Really,  WHAT IF?<br /><br />In the end, this story is: a time traveling, historical fiction, action, adventure, horror, (urban) fantasy, thriller.<br /><br />In Conclusion:<br />I absolutely LOVED this  and I can NOT wait until book two comes out!  The story is fantastic, and... AND... the book is actually constructed beautifully, both the cover and the end pages, the only thing missing was deckled pages!<br /><br />Mom Notes:<br />This series is a little on the creepy side.

1451648537|5.0|Very interesting book. I respect Steve Jobs and it was a great experience to read about his life. The item arrived in a very short time. I am absolutely satisfied.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love the first one but this one is a little cooler my kids totally kick my but at its like their born with computer knowledge lol so fun for all but it can get annoying after dying all the time
0920668372|1.0|I know this is supposed to be about the enduring love of a mother, but it misses that mark and flies straight into the dark swamp of psychotic obsession. I read this only once when I worked in a bookstore and it has stayed with me for years and years. I still shudder just thinking about the ending. If Norman Bates were real, this book would be on his nightstand.
B0056CUZRA|5.0|The second in this brilliant trilogy was every bit as exciting and compelling as you come to expect from Ken Follet.  The worst aspect of reading this wonderful book is that you have to wait for the concluding book.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This is so fun. And as a child I love it but. .......I don't like how there is only 4people to choose from but other than that it's the BEST APP EVER!!!!
B00992CF6W|1.0|I don't like it but my brother loves it. You just build stuff with blocks. Now my brother only plays minecraft.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I really enjoy this app. I found it very Easy to play. Nice interface. Excellent fun app for a great price.
B00AC8ZJ6K|5.0|If you play the game it, its a must see... It brings the game ne go relief and background about scenes in the game. Pay attention to the names..
B0099116AY|4.0|...and that says quite a lot!<br />There is nothing new about stale marriages, but this film is anything but stale. All the nuances, the irritability, the indifference and so on, are well captured in this study of hope over experience.  Tommy Lee Jones is outstanding as the bored, somewhat awkward husband, more in love with his accounts than his wife - where routine has totally eclipsed any spark of romance.  Meryl Streep, while she never gives a sub par performance, nevertheless seems to flirt ever more with stylist mannerisms with every film that passes. This does not detract from her fine depiction of the frustrated and exasperated, dutiful wife, but certain of her expressions and mannerisms, like her special way of smiling, tend to repeat themselves from one role to another.<br />Still, that is only my own personal opinion, and shouldn't put you off this very accomplished film
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this game.  Graphics were great, makes you want to play the game until the finish. Very intriguing, makes the player think about actions made to solve the game. I love playing G5 games... great game.

B009EEFTMC|2.0|two matching cubes will pop disappear and you keep doing this until they're all gone  and that's about it.  you quickly grow bored<br />and on the challenge mode you start with two matching cubes  which disappear after you select them. The problem is that no sooner you have matched two cubes and more start popping up to the point you loose control because new ones pop up too soon. Uninstalled already
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Loved it. Can't wait to read the next one. Just as good as the first. Not only for youth. Adults love it too!
B0091REZMW|4.0|The game itself is pretty simple but can still be a challenge for your eyes to find all of the objects in the time limit. The little character stories are cute and entertaining.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|It could be a five also, I like the way they show how people adapt to the<br />world they live in...not so much the zombies, however, I like the detailed art work<br />on the zombies.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|Love the extended version. I bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it. Got it at a good price.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I love this story and I wanted everyone in my family to read it. I plan to read it again myself.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Yo dis book was mad crazy dough every thing you think is somethin nuts and like man it be fire
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I really liked this guy. Sure, it's a remake of Robinson Crusoe on Mars. Who cares. It's better than the first one. The plot moves right along, what I know of the science looked pretty solid, and the wisecracks were first rate! I've been reading sci fi for fifty years. I understand how hard it is to get all those things right.<br /><br />I want to see more by Andy Weir. Great first book. Five stars because I don't believe in this \\"five stars is only for classics\\" crap. There's plenty of classics I didn't like all that much.
B003274QH6|4.0|Excellent first season, definitely hooks you. My only comment is that it doesn't have spanish subtitles and I bought it to see with my girlfriend in Mexico, so for this I give it 4 and not 5 stars.
B0006ZE7G2|2.0|Not what i expected, i was giving this as a gift, and they were not happy with it. I will defendtly return this item.
B001TH16DI|5.0|If you always wondered what those old Star Trek movies would have been like in HD... stop wondering and buy the set.  Excellent job at cleaning up the film itself, and the soundtrack is great, too.  Well worth the $ , definately an enjoyable blast from the past!!
B004FRX0MY|1.0|This app does not work on my Samsung Galaxy S 11 phone. I called customer service and they had no idea what to do. One hour later I uninstalled it. I was unable to play any of my music in the cloud. Kept getting incident #151.<br />Fortunately itunes works great.
1476712042|1.0|I can not believe I wasted a long weekend reading this book!  It was without a doubt one of the worst books I have read in a long time.  The plot is bad. The characters are all one dimensional.  The book is entirely too long filled with endless boy gets girl, boy loses girl crap.  The editing is god awful. The whole book is just plain bad.  I can't imagine ever reading anything else by this author unless she matures and gets a better editor.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|When I finished the book I was upset with myself for wasting my time. I woluld not recommend this book!
0937381888|5.0|Excellent book..takes all the mystery out of it...if you want basic knowledge for your first batch..or dive in deep, you can do both.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I am very pleased with this app.  I purchased my Kindle Fire yesterday and this is one of the first apps I purchased.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love this game but it is slow sometimes. Other than that I play it every day. Awesome graphics too.
0307593312|5.0|This is a great Murakami epic, though ABSOLUTELY NOT for first time Murakami readers. Make sure you've read at least one other of his before tackling this one.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|Refreshingly different puzzle game with beautiful graphics! Starts off easy but becomes increasingly more challenging!  Nice music too! Highly recommended for any puzzle lover!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|After I got the notion of how to use Kindle... this cable is<br />helpful when the charging takes a long while
B0064BCNA4|3.0|It has good songs but I was expecting it to be bigger, also one of the keys is a note off.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A mind-bending psychoanalysis of marriage, replete with in-laws stories, vengeance, and parental pathos. A murder investigation reveals more than just clues about the missing Amy, it returns entertaining evidence to the reader about human nature and the status of our relationships. Gillian Flynn combines fine writing with stellar storytelling.
1567184855|5.0|I have read this book probably 5 times now. It helped explain some communication from the other side when my boyfriend died in 2001.
B006P96PAO|5.0|This movie moved me to tears and filled me with encouragement to live better.<br /><br />It is not a big-hollywood production and a little of the acting could be more polished, but it is an improvement over their previous films.<br /><br />The content & message of the movie far out weighs any minor shortcomings.<br /><br />I cannot express how much I love this movie or recommend it highly enough.<br /><br />A MUST SEE film for anyone who loves God & family...anyone who longs for a time when our society was more pure and upright.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I think this book was magnificent. It kept you wanting to read more just when you had to go. When you thought one thing was going to happen it all suddenly changed, in a good way of course. I highly suggest you read this! I absolutely loved it, and I hope you do as well.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Very good reading= The author did a great job researching the lives of people on a plantation and the interaction between the slaves and the master.  I love books that I feel like I know the characters and that makes me emotional.
0061992860|4.0|I was getting this book for a present. I expected the book to be regular sized. It's actually a pocket book and can fit in your palm. However, the information was very detailed. My boyfriend loved the present and said this survival book contains very important information even more than his other survival guides. Thus, don't judge a book by its size. Very satisfied with this purchase.
0307592731|1.0|Geez, where do I start, maybe with the back cover where the cfitics blurbs are. I kept thinking, \\"are they commenting on the same book I am reading?\\". I know these endorsements are cherry-picked, but I couldn't reconcile what I was seeing with what I was reading.<br /><br />In reading many of the reviews there was a theme of \\"at least she is a good writer\\". I did not see it. In any description of a long hike things are bound to get repetitive but referring to the trail guide by its long title was like a small stone in a ill-fitting hiking shoe.<br /><br />And to all of you disappointed that it was not more about the hike, it had an \\"Oprah Book Club 2.0\\" on my copy. The operative word is OPRAH. If you want a hiking book read anything by Colin Fletcher and if you want a memoir read \\"The Glass Castle\\". This book fails at both.<br /><br />The cringe-worthy in my title is about the way that sex is handled. I am no prude and kudos to the author for being honest but I did not get anything from the inclusion of this information other than a) wondering what was going to happen at the introduction of every male character and b) thinking that if this was a male narrator I would cringe just as much (if not more).<br /><br />There are very few books that I refuse to finish but this came damn close, hence the one-star.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|Love this game!get it you will love it! It is like temple run but more fun,and it is free!so get it!
B005K200NK|5.0|Great book by a great writer. Laura Ingalls Wilder's books whether autobiographical or semi-autobiographical give an amazing insight to this period in history. A fantasic read.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i love this it is awesome.this is so cool that i cant stop playing it. i play it every day if you haven't got it yet what are you wating for!!!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Blu-ray, 3D Blu-ray, DVD, Digital Copy, AND the Digital Music soundtrack download?? What more could you ask for - Amazon coming through with an amazing price - yep. Bought and watched repeatedly.
B000063V8U|5.0|Great Star Trek series, great cast, great plots- recommend to all sci fi fans, buy from here-fast delivery, great low price and quality, not the imitations!
B0080K3G4O|4.0|Would recommend to people who don't like self help books or who have exhausted attempting to find one that works.
B005YCZLT4|3.0|I'm the biggest fan of Laura Pausini, love her music and talents since I was a little girl, but I have mixed feeling about this CD. I feel it is too much 'rock' for my taste, a little too loud, and the poetry seems a little meaningless.  I still like it and continue to be faithful to Laura, but she could have done better.  (side note, I like the Italian version much better than the Spanish one)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game. Everyone should play it. Thank you for providing.this wonderful game. The only problem is it's too much like Temple Run. Love,<br />SECRET
B00957T6X6|4.0|currently reading through dance of dragons. really like the series, except book four. i can't remember anything relevant or interesting happening.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I bought for my wife and it made her happy then sad at the end. In addition, now one of my daughters has become addicted.
0307891372|5.0|You can do every quest in the game with this walkthrough.  It's the bible of Skyrim!  Game is a lot of fun with it.
B000089RVX|5.0|If you have heard any one of the songs on the album, you know their style of music. The entire body of work for Evanescence is just hauntingly beautiful.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|If your new or a year or so into lifting and your looking to shed some bodyfat and maybe gain (or just keep) muscle, I would highly recommend this book.  Also, this author actually will reply to your email, tweets, Facebook posts...  not something you find everyday.  Big thumbs up.
B003MYYJD0|5.0|This watch looks much better in person than on the website. The combination of the gold with the black, makes this watch perfect for both casual and more dressy occasions.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Without text to speech, the kindle app on the phone is useless. Even a free book reader has text to speech plugin interface to use IVoN. Amazon where do spend your research dollars?
B005COO1X6|2.0|Kind of silly...I like science fiction but I guess the end was just a little silly for me. Someone else might like it, I dunno. In general I love Stephen King stories!
B00013M6NK|4.0|My Nikon P500 camera indicates full charge until just before it is too low to work.  A second battery was necessary to keep me from throwing my camera a long ways.  I opted for name brand.  It works fine.  Now when my camera refuses to turn on, I just change batteries and take more pictures.
B003M98792|4.0|Every time I see this movie I am so taking back to the Grindhouse era. Sonny Chiba, The Street Fighter Series is another personal favorite, along with Battle Royale.
1481251880|5.0|Excellent read that had me from page 1.  A must read if you love gripping love stories with strong characters.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It does what it needs to do on my Kindle Fire. Could be a little improved to work more like my cell phone app.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is even better than the first temple run if you liked the origional than you will love this one :)
B0058VA2U4|4.0|As another reviewer below, I´m also more fan of the John Bush days - even though began listening to ´thrax on State Of Euphoria (my favorite maybe). Don´t know, just love how he´s voice matched the music, and also how it changed and modernized it (the band).<br />That said, gotta aggree: this is simply a freaking great metal album from the XXI Century.<br />Keeps the roots, you can see (hear, of course) all the origins, charcteristics from the  first albuns, there is the guitar and bass line that´s typical Anthrax, Charlie´s drums...but it doesn´t sound dated, or just a repetition from the past.<br />Belladona doesn´t tire our ears, he´s better than ever.<br />In resume: if you like metal, you´ll like; if you like Anthrax, you´ll love it.
B004LWZW42|5.0|Love this movie. Love the whole series. Dont know why gotta type so much for a movie but Im done.
0920668372|5.0|My son is almost two. We bought this book when he was about 15 months. He loves it! He makes me read it to him every night. He even says &#34;Book!&#34; and points at it. He starting to learn the words to the story. So he knows when I'm done with one page and he'll even turn the page when I'm done. I love this book because it talks about the mother and son relationship through the years. Great Buy!!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I played subway surfers for two days and I had about 30,000 coins. When I woke up the next morning I went to go get my kindle I had zero coins.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Good plot but too much<br />Narrative and interpretation by the writer I would rather the reader make their own interpretations based on what they are reading. The Lion was not written in thisbfashion
B0058VW36U|5.0|fun and educational game that uses problem sloving skills to win the game. I bought it for my son and for myself
0399226907|5.0|I loved this book when I was little. I'm happy to see that they are still making it and it is still a popular book. My son loves that it is so colorful. I love that the book is hard cardboard so it will not bend or fold easily. My son is very rough on books and until he learns how to handle them, I prefer to buy them in that material.
B00AJLHULW|5.0|From The Bio...<br /><br />\\"Robben Ford is one of the premier electric guitarists today, particularly known for his blues playing as well as his ability to be comfortable in a variety of musical contexts. A five-time Grammy nominee, he has played with artists as diverse as Joni Mitchell, Jimmy Witherspoon, Miles Davis, George Harrison, Phil Lesh, Bonnie Raitt, Claus Ogerman, Michael McDonald, Bob Dylan, John Mayall, Greg Allman, John Scofield and many others.\\"<br /><br />Ford's \\"All-Star\\" line-up on this new CD features organist Larry Goldings, drummer Harvey Mason Sr., bassist David Pilch and trombonist Steve Baxter.<br /><br />The vocals are excellent, sounding a bit like Boz Scaggs on \\"Oh Virginia\\" and \\"Fool's Paradise\\" oh so smooth, laced with a nasally James Taylor undertow. \\"The grain of his voice on the lone original, \\"Oh, Virginia,\\" establishes a seamless connection between Southern soul, New Orleans rhythm & blues, and country music and may be the finest song he's written.\\" I can't believe how much his singing has developed, definitely as polished as his guitar playing.<br /><br />Yes, he's back with a set of carefully crafted dynamic, new and highly original arrangements. \\"Bringing It Back Home' is the album I really wanted to make right now,\\" Ford relates. \\"I wanted to apply my perspective to the music that first moved me, get together with a group of great musicians and play what we were inspired to play at that moment, without any pressure or expectations. The results are really pure, and the most fun I've had making an album in years.\\"<br /><br />On this series of mainly cover tunes, his modern blues is infused with his love of New Orleans' R&B throughout. Especially on \\"Everything I Do Gonna To Be Funky\\" and \\"Fair Child\\", great cuts. I especially love the brass and organ accompaniment throughout.<br /><br />Covers by Ford of artist's material like Allen Toussaint, Bob Dylan, Earl King,  Charlie \\"Little Buddy\\" Doyle, and Michael McDonald to name a few.<br /><br />This is Ford putting on offer his considerable skills as a bandleader and song interpreter. His vocal ability is balanced by his instrumental talent. Ford makes it look too easy.<br /><br />This is Ford putting on offer his considerable skills as a bandleader and song interpreter.

0802473156|5.0|My husband and I have learned a lot. We are reading this for book club this month as well. Simple but powerful advice.
B00000JNO1|5.0|I love this old music compared to new music. That is what makes it classic rock. Thanks for making it available and keeping the price low.
B000000WFF|5.0|I had this album on cassette tape when I was little. My older brother threw it away because I listened to it all day. So I bought it again like 15 years later lol. I still love it!
0765325950|4.0|Let me preface my review with a comment: I did like the novel.  I do not, however, feel that it was an adequate ending to a grand epic.  Too many loose ends unexplained.  SPOILER ALERT - I will reference things that happened in the final volume, so don't read if you don't want to know.  SO..... Did the Tinkers find their song?  And if so, did it have anything to do with the Ogier?  How do the Seanchan Ogier survive without steddings?  Are the Ways cleansed?  Was Olver Gaidal Cain reborn?  Is one of Elaine's babes Birgitte reborn?  Does Fortuona have Matt executed?<br /><br />I could go on - there were SO many plot-lines that wrapping up all of them would probably have been impossible, and I rather get the impression that NOT wrapping up every plot point was actually the point.  &#34;There are no endings&#34; has been a theme throughout the novels, so Cadsuane's groan as she realizes she is about to be named Amyrlin against centuries of her avoiding it is fitting.  Matt's realization that he is about to enter a life-time of battles with Tuon is appropriate.  Do Perrin and Faile rule Saldea?<br /><br />All in all, a masterful work by Brandon Sanderson.  I cannot recommend his personal work too highly.  I am certain I will re-read the entire Wheel of Time, back to back, one day.  But not too soon.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very good reading..could not put it down<br />Can not wait to read the other two books.<br />Love the way she writes
B008PE9GSA|5.0|I'm a huge ZZ Top fan and I live in Houston. I have all of their albums for a reason, they are that good!!! This is a must for anyone who loves hard rock and Texas boogie.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|The first season is the best...second it great too but this first one is just amazing in all ways. So creative! I really recommend it!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|A fast moving game and a lot of fun I laugh when I watch my youngest Grandson he has a lot of fun with this game.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very hard to put down & even at the end there were still suprises! Women may enjoy this a bit more than the menfolk.
B000002P74|5.0|I love this old music compared to new music. That is what makes it classic rock. Thanks for making it available and keeping the price low.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is my friends favorite game and now it is mine too! I cant stop playing it it is so good!
B002M5E2DW|5.0|I recommend this book to everyone!  very uplifting, but in a logical way...the website is great too!<br />A must read and great for daily reference!
B000000W5N|5.0|This is the Stones at their best. This of course is just my opinion. For me the Stones last album worth listening to was Some Girls in 1978.
B000005B0U|5.0|Even though John Belushi was not with them, the Blues Brothers still did a good job in this movie. Good music and a lot of music stars are represented here.
B004G600A4|5.0|My daughter is a huge Disney Movie Fan... and she's 17!!! She loves Tangled and especially Ryder. Can't go wrong with this one.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|First of all, Danny DeVito is the most ADORABLE Lorax ever! ;-) That said, &#34;The Lorax&#34; tells the story of a young man with good intentions but a great deal of emotional baggage. The Once-ler means well, but he is caught up in the futile quest for his mother's love, which unfortunately, he never gets. What he does get, though, is a second chance brought on by an idealistic young boy in love with an older woman (which is all the rage these days ;-) That young boy, inspired by his heart's desire's love for trees embodies the essence of &#34;UNLESS.&#34; The two of them, with the help of the coolest Grandma ever, changed the world. KUDOS!!!
B005P4PAVK|5.0|Creative genius. I live with those kinds of people...and it is fun to watch it on the television, if only to say, &#34;that really does happen&#34;
B00006FR47|5.0|I love this old music compared to new music. That is what makes it classic rock. Thanks for making it available and keeping the price low.
B002ZG976U|5.0|I love Cam Gigandet (and Cher), this movie didn't get great reviews from the critics, but I love it. The music is great.
B000HAB4KS|5.0|I loved this movie because it showed the power of love. Notice how Neo actually flatlined in the matrix but Trinity's love restarted his heart and brought him back from the dead! God is Love!! There is no greater power!!! That said, I must also say that &#34;the truth is in the numbers,&#34; and that scene where Neo and Trinity went to rescue Morpheus was TOTALLY HOT!!! Finally, I will always have a soft spot in my heart for Agent Smith; he is so DELICIOUSLY nefarious!! I like villains ;-)
B005SAJJHM|5.0|Creative genius. I live with those kinds of people...and it is fun to watch it on the television, if only to say, &#34;that really does happen&#34;
B00A9T1HUO|1.0|Josh Groban's voice is a terrific instrument, but he should back away from writing his own material. I wish I had reviewed the cd before purchasing it, as there was but one track that I thought was up to his previous standards. Other than the operatic material everything else sounded like I'd been trapped in a medieval castle with an English balladeer. The melodies remained the same with different lyrics. Maybe he should take his voice and cut a cd of the standards.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Wow!  The second half of this book really had my head spinning!  I am glad I stayed with it.  It was interesting and thought provoking.  A thriller, yet cut from a different mold.
B0049J2CKE|5.0|This movie takes a really hard look at racism (or species-ism, as the case may be). Remy could be compared to a black person, a latino, a woman, or a gay or lesbian person. All of these groups have caught well more than their fair share of racism in western civilization. Enough is Enough! Ratatouille also takes a stab at nepotism; the restaurant owner's son didn't have a CLUE!!! Fortunately, Remy was able to channel his spirit and save the whole place. I especially liked the scene where Remy's dad brought the whole family to save the day when the chips were down (and they locked that nasty health inspector in the deep freezer!!)  That said, we can learn a lot from our rat friends (as scientists have been doing for years.) Besides, if we blow up the planet like some of the IDIOT POLITICIANS have been threatening to do, the rats will probably be the only ones left, anyhow. (But I REFUSE to let that happen... not on MY PLANET!!!!)
B001N3EZW2|5.0|Love this movie from the past. Very well done for the year it was created. Should be any sci-fi fans
B00746TURW|3.0|A bit improbable but a detailed look at a slice of midwestern life in the US it takes a long while to make the border!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|World of Goo rates on my list of favorite games.  I didn't think I'd like it just based on the name alone but it is a creative and addictive game.  My biggest complaint is that I ran out of levels to play.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Better than the first! The new features add a different aspect of play, making you work for powerups instead of just buying them.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|The motorcycle chase in the streets of Manila was heart-stopping! They must have gone into considerable lengths coordinating that scene in an Asian megalopolis!
B00A1EOBJQ|3.0|Songs sound bette while watching the show, dont stand well on their own. Poor recording quality in some songs, missing songs, would not purchase again
B0014E9188|5.0|Well the answer to that question can be found here! Someone shared this with me and now I share it with all. It is the summation of their excellence in musical manifestation. I haven't seen such concentration to expression since attending Yes shows. This DVD is produced with the intent of you receiving the highest quality musical experience. Buy it and you will share it, I promise.
0385720920|2.0|its a used paperback, I just thought good condition wouldnt come with a bunch of stickers on it and looking like itd be run over by something. lesson learned.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|The acting is great !  The stories superb!  And the cast to die for!  I have all the seasons on DVD  and am looking for to add Number 10!
0802798225|4.0|I just finished Perfect Chemistry and it was out of this world.  I started this book in the audio version in the morning on my way to work and finished it when I got home in the paperback version because I was hooked and just had to know how it all turned out.  I don't think I have finished a book in one day in long time but I loved this retelling of Romeo and Juliet that kind of reminded me of a more real version of West Side Story, where gangsters act like gangsters and don't break into song and dance.<br /><br />This story is about finding out who you are and breaking the molds.  It's a story about passion and love and fighting for the ones you love.  It is a story that made my heart break in parts and was somehow able to put it all back together.  This book is realistic, romantic and gritty because it does not sugar coat the lives of Brittany and Alex.  Alex is a gangbanger who lives on the poor side of town and Brittany is rich white girl.  They get partnered up in Chemistry class and well the rest is chalked up to chemistry.  I would recommend it older teens because well their chemistry sizzles right off the page and their were some scenes I had to fan myself.<br /><br />In conclusion, I loved  this book and relationships were very real and had me from page one.  I listened to part of this book and I have to warn readers that the narration is not that great. The male voice was ok but the female was a little grating but it is a good enough story that the narration did not detract from it.  I give this book a solid four laser pistols and will be reading the next book in the series Rules of Attraction.
B003VANOFY|4.0|They're very comfortable. On my small head, they're almost too big at the smallest level. I can generally wear them for several hours without them hurting too much.<br /><br />If you're buying them just for gaming, you'll love them. The surround sound is great. The G-keys work in Vent, but not in Team Chat. (Is that what it's called?) But I use them for audio books as well as gaming. The G-keys work in Windows Media and iTunes, so if I'm listening to a CD, it's great. I can pause my book (or music) while I'm doing housework so I can hear what someone is telling me. But if I'm listening to a digital book from my library (through Overdrive), that's not possible. Logitech says it doesn't support that type of application because it uses another application like Windows Media.<br /><br />The range is about 33-35 feet. I can go most places in my house, with the transmitter in the middle. It does tend to cut out a lot in certain rooms. Sometimes, moving the transmitter even a foot helps significantly.
B0052CK5PQ|5.0|Funny, smart, down to earth. I laughed and laughed. Drove my husband nuts with reading bits out to him (that is annoying).
B001QXZ81G|1.0|I was very disappointed that this was not playable in the us. I would recommend it for some one who lives in the uk
B00881VLCE|1.0|I got this app for free and I got what I paid for it!  Nada, zip, nothing. Does not work on my tablet. And it's not even a Kindle Fire!
1576875776|4.0|El envio llego en perfecto estado y en el tiempo estipulado.<br />Recomendable la compra de este producto, excelente relación precio calidad.
B004WKI204|2.0|UNTIL... the author starts writing about Saturday night live in minute detail. Such a shame as her memoir before that was a total scream. If you are a huge fan of hers, especially her Sarah Palin impression and you LOVE Saturday night live, then you are bound to love this. Me, not so much.
B006GHA9QQ|3.0|This sequel lacked the passion, the charisma, the magnetisim of the Movie Phantom of the Opera.<br />The chemistry between Christine and Erik just wasnt there in this sequel.  I had hoped to hear threads of the original music throughout the background but was barely noticible which led to a let down of the creshendo at the end.  Altough I will have to admit the ending was quite powerful.
B009A87X80|4.0|What a beautiful CD with a wonderful choice of songs. My brother-in-law has many of her albums and told me<br />the history of Eva. She had a beautiful voice and died so young. Very tragic!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|my kids and i luv this game so much, have it on both my kindle fires, very entertaining, thanx so much
B004JN1D2I|5.0|You never know who is going to die. There is a character for everyone to follow and identify with. You can almost feel the cold of winter.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I've waited to see this movie since the return of the king came out. It was worth the wait, one of the best movies I've seen in a while. Can't wait until it comes out to video so I can own it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|We really like finding a good television series. So far this has been one of the top three we have found with Madmen and Dexter being the other two. What happens with so many other shows, is the first few episodes are good, and then the rest are all the same format. Downton Abbey evolves and and keeps changing. The show takes place before WWI and continues on for three seasons. You get to know a great many characters, too many to go into. They are all interesting, with a few villains and I will say no more. We watched through Season 3, which we found on PBS and can't wait for Season 4 to start.  The wait will be until next year, but we will be waiting. You may need the first few episodes with subtitles, but after that, you will probably pick up the accents. No sex, no swearing, and only a couple of violent scenes, you will get to see great writing, unmatched acting performance, beautiful photography, and music at its best.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|Wasn't sure what to expect but what a wild ride. It amazes me that Nikki Sixx is still alive. Once I began reading, it was hard to put down. I too journal so I can understand how important this diary was. Definitely worth your time to read.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Adding the Pinterest App to my kindle fire, has made the website easier to navigate.  Now I can pin away.  Would definitely recommend getting this app if you are a Pinterest user!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game, it's so addictive!! Would recommend this to people who enjoy temple run and games like that!!! Have fun gaming!!:)
B008673ZAQ|1.0|I don't know how this series got compared to fifty shades, it was awful. I read the first one and wasn't impressed but wanted to find out about Gideon's past so I got this one. I only got to chapter 9 when I couldn't take anymore then skipped to the end to satisfy my curiosity. Sorry to write such a crappy review, but this book was not worth the money for me.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Movie and excellent packaging, I tried it and the product works perfectly, I'm happy with what I bought, people serious and responsible, highly recommend them
B0039TD7PY|5.0|This is an excellent cd.  Carole and James have never been better!  They seem to get better with age.  One of the best concerts I have ever seen was them touring for this cd in Boston!  Highly recommend
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|It's an okay game that I played for a couple weeks but more for the younger generation than senior citizens.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Not too.complicated and fun to run and gun. If you like a quick play game this is definitely a good free one to download
B008NEMN0K|5.0|Movie and excellent packaging, I tried it and the product works perfectly, I'm happy with what I bought, people serious and responsible, highly recommend them
B007REV4T8|1.0|I saw this film for the first time last night.  What an awful film - no plot, no real story, extremely slow and dull.  This was worse than Moonraker.  The only good thing was the credits at the end of a two and a half hour slog.  Awful just awful.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game so many different scenes and cool monkey also the zip line is awesome I hope a third one comes out
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book blew me away. I read it in 24 hours. I couldn't put it down. So much emotion and depths to these characters. I can't wait to read more from her. I just ordered her first two books.
B00881VLCE|3.0|If you cant finish the puzzle you cant save it top finish later. Nice photos for puzzles though and a good selection of free ones!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|this is a great movie i want one of those dogs loved it can't say enough about it makes you laugh makes you cry.
B004EQAVFU|4.0|If you only read the film's review splash, by Richard Corliss of \\"Time:\\" \\"A superb, poignant film about everlasting love,\\" and combine that with the rendered affection of the cover photographs (featuring the stars, Carey Mulligan and Andrew Garfield, and the sexy, come-on stare of Keira Knightly), expecting to be immersed in the gooey warmth of a Nicholas Sparks (The Notebook) love story, then you will be rudely surprised.<br /><br />While yes, \\"Never Let Me Go\\" is a love story, even tip-toeing into coming-of-age, it is hardly so in the romantic sense, and it is played out under a cloud of such darkness (a structure of the science-fiction, yes, Sci-Fi premiss which is the \\"secret,\\" to be discovered), that few of the rewards of love will ever be felt, not by the characters or viewers.  Instead, the ethical questions raised will remain, like the walking dead, largely because, in an economic sense, the injustice which is at the heart of this film, adapted from Kazu Ishiguro's novel, \\"The Remains of the Day,\\" is very much in play today, where the fruits of life, enjoyed with obscene excess by many while so scarce for most, sets a reality of disparity and insensitivity which makes it seem more than plausible that we're headed for the same killing fiction which cages the film's characters.<br /><br />However you may classify this film after you have traveled through its frames, you will agree that the hallmarks of excellent film making--screenplay, casting, acting, direction, cinematography, design, were all integral to the journey, even if the destination leaves you cold, disappointed, and/or needing a warm hug.
B007N85POS|4.0|It is a good game.  Some of the episodes are difficult, but keep trying!  Graphics are interesting.  Enjoy it much!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is addicting and if you have one hard set you cant solve - you will try for hours to get it right
B009RH9HDS|5.0|I got this case for my son for his Kindle HD. He is not hard on products but you don't just get your 11 year old a Kindle Fire HD without some added protection. He LOVES this case! It is VERY well made and fits the kindle like a glove. It is protective and easy for him to put into the resting mode to view his favorite movies etc.<br /><br />I love that it closes with the elastic strap and is cushioned very well. I can't tell you how great this case is made. Just buy it. Do not hesitate if there are negative reviews. It's a great case!<br /><br />The ONLY &#34;CON&#34; is when charging you have to have the case open. My Samsung Galaxy 10.1 does not have to be open for charging. This is just  small glitch in an otherwise great case.
B000QJM8Z0|3.0|It was an amusing book. I did enjoy it. But the movie was much more entertaining..I'm not sorry I bought it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Just read this John Grisham book and it's awesome...stay tuned til the end for a twist! Really, really good read!
B0086700CM|2.0|If you are a novice - you get frustrated quickly as you cant slow it down to learn. Would be better if they had several different lvewls for different players.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Intimidating when in book form. Great for kindle, so as to pickup reading whenever you can. It's a great read for the treadmill. Really helps to flesh out the characters on the show. I didn't find it difficult to keep track of the characters and story over the epic series,however 5000+ pages is a lot of reading.
B001NHNG64|1.0|The best thing about this book is the eye it gives into the lives of our crazed and frightened survivalists....He bores me...I wouldn't read another one...but , as we all know, different tastes...
0736092269|5.0|Purchased the 2nd addition couple of years back, this is the perfect addition. This book has a lot of new information.
B003O86FMW|5.0|That was unexpectedly good and an improvement on the first.  I guess I should see the movie then and read the last.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|one of the best, not disappointed in it at all he is a great writer read everything he writes. and got it SO fast over  kindle fire.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|All the way until the last five pages, I was ready to give this book only four stars. The writing and character development was very slow, especially with Jo and Carly,  and I found myself slightly annoyed the whole time because we never even for much of a description of either of them. You'll find out why in the end. So I withdraw my four star rating and raise a five star rating instead. It was a beautiful, and totally original story, and the way Sparks made you care about and sympathize with every character (even Kevin) made this story even better. I will, however, have to consult google on a few of my suspicions, because some things weren't very well elaborated upon. Enjoy this book and take something away from it.
034580404X|5.0|my wife showed interest in reading the series. she could not put them down in the evening. she still can not understand why there were so many negative reports about the series.
B000TEUSJK|4.0|Great movie!!! I lost my copy, and replaced it! I showed it to a friend and she loaned it out to someone. I think in total six of my friend have seen it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's great I play it almost every time I get on my Kindle if your reading this I recommend you get this game
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Has all the right stuff GOOD puzzle to figure out. Just VERY disappointing THOUGHT it was a whole game but cuts you off until pay for more.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book was a fun read. An easy romance,with the obscure hint of a heart.  It is worth the read and a nice way to relax in the evenings.
B0087IT8FK|4.0|The movie is  great however the movie I have in possession is in French which I was not aware of when I ordered it. I am looking forward to the one I pre-ordered which has the english subtitles. excellent movie for anyone!!!
B002Q1YDLI|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book. In the beginning I was beyond annoyed by the character Darcy, one if the main characters from\\"Something Borrowed,\\" but by the end you begin to like her. Enjoyable, interested in what the next book holds.
B002WN35DC|1.0|Sin ilustraciones! Compre la version para kindle muy facil muy rapido pero este libro esta incompleto sin sus ilustraciones. Hay algunos clasicos que es mejor comprarlos en papel. :(
B008NMT684|4.0|my son loves the trucks and. tractors!<br />its a little bit hard for him to get the pieces right iver where they should be but that a good way to oractice hand eye coordination! !

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator app is very easy and convenient to use on the Kindle Fire. The print is large and the applications are simple to use.
B000002TQV|5.0|Yep! These guys' beginnings are very interesting to listen to after hearing their experimental work. This is one of the best rock albums ever made! With songs like The Bends, Just, Nice Dream, My Iron Lung and Bulletproof...I Wish I Was. A classic work for everyone.
B00005JNS0|3.0|It has two scratches that make the movie pause for a few seconds.  Other that that, it is satisfactory.  It looks good.
B00BESLHEA|1.0|One of the worst movies I have ever seen.  I can't believe an oscar winning actor agreed to participate in this flith.  Maybe this RZA character should learn how to speak the english language next time he attempts to act in and narrate something for the public in the United States.  Horrible Horrible Horrible.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book starts slow but about 40% til the end it really becomes a book you can't put down. The ending both pissed me off and gave me a small chuckle. Definitely check it out.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay got a little uncomfortable with their status in the world when they made this album, they weren't sure where to go, it was their phase that every band goes through...&#34;what's next?&#34; After the success of Rush Of Blood, Coldplay went back into the studio and came out with a beautiful new take on their great songwriting. X&Y adds sweeping synths, distorted guitars, dark, thoughtful lyrics and a whole new vibe to the mix. A great album for anyone who wants to get into Coldplay, or for anyone in general.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|This whole book took my breath away. Totally mesmerizing. I would read again and again just to feel as loved as this girl was.
B000YADE04|4.0|Going back in time to the 50's is always fun and enjoyed the innocence of the era depicted! This one is a great movie for lot's of laughter!
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book is amazing and I can't wait cor the be rogue to be released. Anyone you likes fiction and an post apocalyptic story this is for sure one you will love too.
B0098VVMPO|5.0|In awe of this show, never has my heart pounded so hard from a show, amazing visual, every sexual act known to man, rivers of blood, plots, intrigue.  It has the sophistication suited for a king and sexual depricity the likes you have never imagined.  Not for the faint of heart.  T.V. has never looked or felt so good.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|it really is awesome but every time I hit over 1,000,000<br />my kindle fire will not let me play it the next time I get on it I have to uninstall it and install it every time
B00AUA67GQ|3.0|This didn't work for me I went to another option that does work. You should download the FREE version first and see if it works for you before buying the $9.99 version.
B0093WVND4|5.0|It's a humorous tale of a Fox and his friends escaping the evil farmers bogus bounce and bean. A laugh out loud comedy.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|The story was dragged out a little. Liked the story but thought it could have had a different ending. Good
B004123CO4|4.0|This book unveils the mysteries of using on camera flash. For most of us is pretty common to encounter situations in where the lighting is less than perfect.  With the techniques presented in this book you can get good pictures in where it was near impossible. The author's solution: balance your background to subject exposure... then bounce and flag your flashgun!  Everything is well explained but a few setup diagrams will make it even better.  Also the Kindle conversion makes it difficult to follow the reading because the pictures are out of sync with the info.<br /><br />All the techniques are non brand specific unless you go for remote TTL in where only Nikon and Canon are referenced.<br /><br />Great reading for anyone learning how to master flash photography.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a full-sized calculator that does what any other one will do but it logs you calculations in order.

B0056CUZRA|5.0|This is the first book I have read of Ken Folletts. So loved it and will be an avid follower from here on in. Keep them coming Ken
B00005J79J|5.0|This is a good album, but it's music from 1993-2000, not 1990-2000. The songs are well chosen and show off Ms. Brightman's voice quite well. I recommend this to any fan or someone just looking into S.B.'s music.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|It gets better as it goes on. It took me almost a year to finish it. I was reading other books in between chapters but it is a very well written book.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|Kept me on my toes a really exciting book. I loved it cause there were so many things you weren't expecting
B0026772N8|5.0|It's a classic and everyone must read this.  It applies to todays world as much if not more than when it was written.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Halfway through and I can't put it down! Riveting and very well written!<br /><br />I've already recommended to several friends and family members :)
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I love books that I can get lost in. This is one of those books. Interesting characters, covering a long span of years from Australia to England.
0425263916|5.0|A definate must read.  Gideon and Eva's story practically melts off the pages it is so hot!!!!  Be sure to read Bared to You first and get ready for a fabulous story!!!
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|I am surprised at the number of bad reviews this has received recently, it seems like a lot of people expected it to be something it was not. I never expected this book to be scary, I just thought it would be interesting and it was. Obviously the subject matter is within the realm of the fantastical, these children have special and unusual gifts but I wouldn't say that's all that the story is about, it's also about the complicated relationships between parents and children. It's a quick read and thoroughly enjoyable.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I'm so grateful for the Kindle app for iPod. I never buy books through iBooks because Apple has such a horribly limited selection and their books are almost always at least twice of what Kindle charges. Because of Amazon's low prices on their Kindle books, I have been devouring new books at an obscene rate. I'm grateful for the use, and grateful they copied their format from iBooks so you have a realistic page-turning feel. I was even shocked that as you turn the page, you can see the words printed through the back of the page you are turning, just like a real book might. Absolutely amazing devotion to detail. Did I mention it's free?<br /><br />However Amazon needs to put a button that will take you right to the Kindle store so you can easily and effortlessly purchase new books without having to navigate the Net on your little device to get there. Also the ability to have a link that lets you purchase the next book in a series at the end of each book would be ideal. They really need to maximize the ease with which to purchase new books.<br /><br />However, I'm extremely grateful to have this app.
B004DM0UII|4.0|I really love this app! It allows me to listen to my favorite NPR station from Philly even though I'm in LA. The apps shortcoming is its 3G &amp;4G performance. I wish it did a better job of caching and buffering the audio in order to avoid interruption. All in all I love the app and would recommend it to anyone.
B0085W09ME|4.0|A good tool to check available flights.  Also excellent to check alternate airports if that is an option for the traveler. Very intuitive in selecting airport code letters.
B0009MAP9A|4.0|I would tell any one to listen to this one it was great. Took me back a few years it did
0439023521|5.0|“The Hunger Games”, a book with much enthusiasm, struck me as a work of art within its context.  The story remains on a teenage girl living in a post-apocalyptic world.  The book explains how there is one very important event that happens each year known as the Hunger Games.  The games require one girl and boy to be offered up, to fight to the death until there is a lone victor.  Each district offers two as sacrifices and as punishment for rebelling against the Capitol in past years.  When Katniss’s sister is chosen during the reaping she eagerly volunteers in her place.  The book is a mix of a tragic love story yet gruesome in retrospect.  The book has many strengths, but strengths come with weaknesses.  It is wonderfully built with action packed scenes and also the small instances of sorrow.  The fight at the Cornucopia, the incident with Tracker Jackers(a poisonous wasp), when the small girl from District Eleven dies; All of these events are works of art nimbly crafted with a writers precise and measure.<br /> The book also has weaknesses.  It is told in mostly thought process, which may be unappealing to readers due to the lack of physical action.  It also has a small number of cheesy love scenes which may not appeal to the boy population of our country. I personally recommend this book to the ages of 12 and up because it begins to introduce a higher level of writing to readers.  For the ages 12 and below the book is not recommended due to the presence of non-kid appropriate scenes, gruesome detail, and romantic casualties.  I believe the author’s purpose was to create a story which entertained readers with combat, love, and sorrow.  The author achieved her purpose with high scores in my opinion, because of the way the book pulled me in and caused me to want to read more.  I believe that Suzanne Collins tried to create a book that focuses on what our world could be like in future years.  Also due to the amount of thought process given by Katniss, in times of distress (In the Cornucopia, and when she is blowing up the careers food), and when she slowly begins to fall for Peeta (In the cave when she kisses him, and when she calls his name after one of the announcements in the games) makes the book slightly unappealing for readers.  I, as a person who loves to read can sometimes tell when an author has truly made a book that can connect to readers.  I could put myself in Katniss’s situation, and could connect to the way she was feeling.  This caused me to enjoy reading the book very much, and I still enjoy reading it over again because of that element.  I do believe that Suzanne Collins achieved her purpose in writing the book, because it was vey enthralling to read and it caught my attention and pulled me into the book.  I have given this book a 5 star rating because of the statements that I have made above.  I truly believe that this is an educated story that uses grammar and writing techniques the way that they are supposed to be used.  It is a book that has influenced readers and has achieved the title &#34;A Great Book&#34;.  It is a wonderful and compelling story that has attracted readers across the globe.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Made the mistake of buying a cheapo the first time. This product is well worth the money. Fits my kindle snuggly and I have no worries about throwing it in my purse or backpack.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I never travel without checking this app first.  Plenty of pertinent info for 36 hours to 10days.  Many extras and alerts.
1451695195|3.0|I can't help but wonder if the visions and experience he had were not from the ecoli problem in his system
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love solitaire, I can play this game forever. l just never seem to get bored with it. l highly recommend this game.
B008WCP2PG|4.0|Good movie but could have been bette rwith more dialogue conducive the story of becoming a stripper.  Grat screen shots of the dancers.
B0013LL2Z2|4.0|I've always liked this movie despite farrah fawcett's bad acting.  Good plot, great music<br />(John Williams),Michael York, Peter Ustinov.  Special effects would have been better maybe 5 years later.  DVD had the usual pauses and freeze-ups, but DVD was still good.
B0026P3G12|5.0|For some one like her she has a beautiful voice. Loved it when she blew the judges away when she sang first time on television.
B004GYY714|5.0|This ws a great tool when I was in hospital recently and wasn't prpared to pay the rip-off prices associated with radio TV etc. There were no noises from my fellow sufferers either. Maybe it is just the hospital management's way of keeping wards quiet!
B008G33NFC|5.0|This is hours of excellent music, and at a low cost.<br /><br />Not only is the music superb, nut the recording quality is very good.  If you like Tarja and her band, this is a must-have. If it were a video tape, I would have won it out already.
030758836X|3.0|I had put off reading this book because the description of it didn't appeal to me, but since it had been on the best-seller list for so long, I wanted to see why.  Well I still don't see why.  The book is four hundred pages long.  I struggled through the first two hundred pages and was pleased when it finally turned around, but after awhile it got boring again.  I figured there would be one last twist at the end, but was very disappointed.  I would have written the ending entirely differently, but then I'm not a best-selling author.  There are much better books that never make it anywhere near the best-seller list.
B007SGM084|1.0|Bad. Bad. Bad. What a waste of time. While I was reading it I asked myself why  should I end this book finally j didn't. The main characters are simple people, sex addicts, with real shallow lifes. I still want to know why are women so in love with Mr Grey. I don't want to imagine the answer because being rich and good looking can't be it.
B008M87GJK|5.0|This does what it says on the can as far as news is concerned. My daughter in the USA uses this as her main source of news from 'back home'.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved this book . The love between Eva and Gideon is just amazing . I loved the connection the pull they had to one another . I didn't like that it ended lol . I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a sexy love story
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I was very drawn by the story. It was compelling.  It took a long time to read, but I enjoyed it very much.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|It's super funny. Couldn't stop laughing. Great comedy but not even close to being kid friendly. Totally recommended to anyone 18+.
1594744769|5.0|To say I enjoyed this book, is to put it mildly. Another victory for \\"judging a book by its cover.\\" The big visual draw is the photo on the cover of a levitating girl. This inside of the book is filled with many more just like it. It's a feast for the eyes!<br /><br />Onto the story. The author has taken these genuine photographs and weaved them into a fictional story. Every step kept me guessing and engaged. I found the plot interesting, the characters well-developed, and the conceit fascinating. A young boy is told fantastic stories by his beloved grandfather. As a teenager, he loses faith in the old man realizing none of the stories could be true. However,... I won't give anything away, but I'd say it's a definitely read.<br /><br />I'm depressed that I'm done with the book... I would love a sequel, but it could not be this good.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|And the love continues . Just beautiful is all I have to say . Can't wait for the next book !
B006LSZECO|3.0|I enjoyed this book, it had many twists and turns but the ending was not enough. Interesting and disturbing. It kept me reading but I want a more informational ending. Is there another book to this?
B007REV4YI|5.0|We injoyed Skyfall in the theater and have the complete set and wanted to add this it. we like the clearness and pace of the movie.
B001EN71CW|5.0|A highly underrated show that has grown to have a large following after it got cancelled. A great space-western that actually seems like a possibility. Originally owned it on dvd, and when this went on sale, I snatched it up.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|MY CASE HAS A WAVE OR BUBBLE IN THE PROTECTIVE SCREEN COVER WHICH MAKES IT HARDER TO TOUCH THE APPS AND IT HAS AN ECHO WHEN I AM TALKING WITH SOMEONE ON BOTH ENDS. ALSO THE BUTTONS ARE HARDER TO MASH ON SOME I HAD TO TAKE THE CASE OFF TO USE THEM. I LIKE THE SLIMMNESS OF THE CASE BUT THAT IS ABOUT ALL I CAN SAY THAT I LIKED. I TOOK IT OFF MY PHONE AND PUT MY OTTER BOX BACK ON. IT IS FOR SALE OR I CAN RETURN IT!
B007QPFGJW|4.0|This is my first Nesbo book......took me a bit to get interested because it just seemed like such a bleak voice....an inevitable descent into the evils of addiction...the inhumanity of those who seek to literally bleed the lifeblood of as many lives as they can reach.  The story spread out, plot and characters, in every direction, locations doubled back on themselves just as the characters and plot did.  I'll try another....these Nordic authors are dramatic, if a little matter of fact about sleaze.
B00AYB0SX4|5.0|Many twist and turns to this one! Enjoy the ride! we did! Unexpected thrill ride! Thumbs up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Popcorn and coke a must!!  :)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this whole trilogy.  I just wanted to keep reading and I liked how it was not predictable.  Great!
B009A87ZKG|5.0|This blu ray version is top notch and should be a part of everyone's movie collection. The music alone is worth the price.
B0095P29EG|5.0|I like this as much as Captain American, Iron Man. I would even go as far as Hulk but look forward to more.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|I expected more,but will hand it this!! Special effect I've never seen before!! Lots of action. Lots of blood!! Over 18 for this one!!
B0083P1QUM|5.0|As an author myself, Diana Lainson, I follow Patricia Cornwell and she is certainly one of the best fiction writers around. Here writing is exciting and believable and I always look forward to a new book of hers. Her settings are brilliant and I cannot put her novels down, I have to drop everything and read to the end. Then I review the book and read it again.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Please make  sequel about them having a baby! I did not want to reading it! Makes me sad it is over :(
B0094K1QR8|4.0|I liked it, I think a lot was of this was left on the cutting room. It's ok to make a movie longer if its good. They both did work well together, funny yet different. I liked it.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|This one moves fast!! The story and most of all the ending is heartfelt!! Lots of action and a laugh or two!
B009NPA3Y6|4.0|Just as 40 Licks was released to cover the Rolling Stones' 40th anniversary, it's time for a 50th Birthday set. \\"Grrr!\\" states the story of The Stones in multiple formats: you can purchase this album in 2, 3 or 5 disc sets. Way to market yourselves, guys.<br /><br />That doesn't take away from the power of The Stones and their often ingenious singles. The first CD alone is a primer for rock and roll history, with \\"Satisfaction,\\" \\"Jumping Jack Flash\\" and \\"Sympathy for The Devil\\" alone being the kind of songs bands would chew their hind legs off to compose...or even come up with a guitar lick as memorable. You'll also get a trio of the early, greasy Stones with \\"Come On,\\" a cover of Buddy Holly's \\"Not Fade Away\\" and Mick and Keith laying down some early blues with \\"Little Red Rooster.\\" It's the kind of early material most compilations tend to skip over.<br /><br />Disc two contains plenty of latter classics, like \\"Miss You,\\" \\"Brown Sugar\\" and \\"Start Me Up.\\" But it also reminds you why the band once titled one of their single disc sets \\"Sucking In The Seventies.\\"  It makes you stuck with weaker material like \\"Angie\\" or \\"Emotional Rescue,\\" along with the 80's material that was the band turning into a polished hit machine. Some of these songs hold up surprisingly well, like \\"Undercover of The Night,\\" but \\"Anybody Seen My Baby\\" could have been left off and I don't think I'd have noticed.<br /><br />Of the new songs, \\"Doom and Gloom\\" has serious swagger while \\"One More Shot\\" runs on fumes, really. But that still makes a whole batch of Jagger/Richards composition (along with a couple covers, like the aforementioned Buddy Holly song and \\"Harlem Shuffle.\\" And no-one keeps a beat like Charlie Watts. Like all Stones collections, you can't always get what you want (She's So Cold\\"), but sometimes you get what you need. Or depending on which set, what you pay for.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|DeMille has always been one of my favorite writers. The Corey novels never disappoint. The panther is a fabulous extension of the series. Love the humor and the suspense
B0095P3ULC|5.0|Seen it opening weekend and now in the dark of my living room with surround sound and 60&#34; HDTV. I can watch over and over.
B00AC8ZJPQ|4.0|I wonder on renting this one! But was surprised! Special effect good! Story line good! Overall better than expected! Enjoyed this one!
B0035G5IOE|5.0|I have my students read this book and then they get to watch the movie. Roald Dahl is very popular with children.
B00004TDTO|2.0|It took forever for it to arrive and, when it did, the plastic wrapping was torn and a section ripped off. Also the DVD was rattling around inside for the push button that holds the disk in place was broken and rattling around in it. Lucky that the DVD wasn't ruined. Movie is good, which is why I ordered it, but the service and state was bad.
B000641MB6|5.0|Nice to have this in my DVD Christmas collection.  We enjoy watching movies without commercial interruptions.  And, the grandkids like to see what Nana and li'l Opa have to watch.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|this movie if funny enough for even a girls boyfriend to watch it with her. trust me i was that guy. this movie is hilarious. entertainment for both sexes.
0446195529|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book because it has great characters returning for another ecapade. I like the author and reall all his books.
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|It was the movie that I was wanting to buy.  It comes with the Blu-ray, DVD and digital copy.  Fun!
B004NELBPC|5.0|I like how it basically gives you the headlines of each genre... it's not just something like politics, entertainment, etc. There's like 20-30 different sections to look forward too. Yeah some things don't work like the videos or something, but I honestly I don't mind because I like to just skim through the news, I don't care for a video or a clip.<br /><br />Highly recommended. There is a genre for everyone.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I cried so much. John Green, you never forget to be awesome. I need to go get some more tissues.
1419702238|5.0|I fought buying these books but if they get children to read then I had to submit. It is very popular in my classroom.
B000NTPDSW|3.0|The movies are, undoubtedly, some of the greatest movies in cinema history.  To have these movies on Blu-ray, and at a special price offered through Amazon is super nice too.  However, two things bothered me about this set.  First, the booklet, that came with this set, doesn't fit in the case or even in the box that holds the case.  Second, and maybe it is just my player, it doesn't hold the place of where the movie left off should you need to turn it off before finishing the film.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|What a great movie! It's so much fun and we watch it year after year! Finally had to buy my own copy.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I would recommend to anyone who really likes Solitaire.  And I have tried many ,many games.<br />thank you for the hours of fun.
B00122PUS2|5.0|A timeless classic that Genesis could never could repeat again. Phil Collins took them in to a whole new progessive world.
0061992860|4.0|If I could write a book about survival bag building this is exactly how I'd write it I was in the marines for six years in the infantry and I thought I knew everything about field craft but only with the gear that was issued to me  the first part of the book was a nice refresher in the beginning then it has little tid bits that I did not know here and there with web sites to Order things I wanted from the book the author really knows a lot and is good about teaching it if I thought I was prepared before but I'm even more so now if you get this book use a high liter to outline stuff you need or want
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This was a good book. Proves you can't help who you fall in love with! I didn't see the end coming, it was a nice little twist. I can't wait to see the movie!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Great read. Cool subject and storyline , went back to the time I was born. A lot of the props from my youth.
B009BJAPLK|5.0|This is a good and fairly original show, I like the longer length of the episodes.  I can't stop watching.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|Can't help but dance! Great movie!!! Watch with or without the kids! Highly recommended!! Great addition to our movie collection!
B008AK8FHM|1.0|Phone had to be factory rebooted. When I went back to Kendal the book wasn't in my library. Paid for serving I didn't even get to read.
B0072OFM28|5.0|It arrived on time and I was very happy with the service i got, plus this DVD is very entertaining.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love how this game creates a real since of responcibility and teaches kid how to care for animals. if you want a game all about animals here you go.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its an extreamly fun game... easy to navigate and figure out. my kid loves it. I don't know what else to write here.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun game. =)<br />I like horses so this was a great game for me. I wish there was more to it though.
B0007DFJ0G|4.0|I love this movie cause through out the movie Tyler is protraied as being two characters and does all these horrible things as one while seeing them trough the others eyes.
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|Not at bad as I thought it would be, good action and pretty good acting for the most part and not very long.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|great game to relax and enjoy. not incredibly difficult and nice that you can increase difficulty if one wishes to. I wish they wouldn't mark it free when it is obviously not. once you get sucked in to the story line the free part ends. just tell me outright how much it is so I can decide if I want to play it or not!
B0044XV3R8|5.0|I have every one of James Cameron's movies.  What can I say I am a fan.  I think they are all classics.  This DVD is a quality release that plays well on my 46 inch plasma.  The audio is incredible.  The special additions are also an added treat, although thankfully you can switch among the three different versions.  I hate when you can only watch a special addition.  That said I think I've seen each of the versions about two or three times and they are all fantastic.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|We were kinda skeptical being this is a remake, so we decided to rent from Amazon, loved the movie, may rent again!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I've read this book four times as it truly is wonderful. Such an easy read yet so insightful. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Very good value.  Lots of useful information. Gives a range of info based on different activities. Would recommend to all kindle users.
B003L77GG0|2.0|I loved seasons 1-5, from there the series takes a major nose dive.  This season isn't the worst, that honor goes to the shortened (and woefully written) season 7, plagued by the writers strike.  What really gets me going about this season is the obvious desire the producers had in cutting costs.  For a series that became popular for its action, the tenth season is all talk.  In season 1 & 2 you couldn't go two episodes without a car explosion.<br /><br />The ultimate betrayal for this -10 DVD season owning- fan was the finale.  As like the rest of the season, this last episode was basically Clark and Louis chatting for 42 minutes.  No huge show down, no huge anything.  This is what I get for ten years of loyal viewing?
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Finally got with the rest of the world and became a fan for this really very entertaining show. This is a must see.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|It is so nice to be able to sit down and watch a series at my convenience.  The acting was great!
B0060QM0AG|5.0|Read the series many, many years ago and enjoyed the 1st book of the series it even more that the 1st time. Will read the rest of the series again as well.  The books humor must get better with age, probably my age.
B002RB7VMA|5.0|Great voice and great music!  This is a great throw-back to the rat-pack days and Michael's voice is just pure butter!
B005TBWN0K|4.0|got it for the grandchild and he isn't really old enough yet. I like it fine though. Not an artist and makes me feel like I might be able to be one :)
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Overall, we loved it but the bear was a little scary for our 5 year old and 2 year old daughters.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|What a fascinating tale - but long!  I did really enjoy it but kept thinking I could have benefited the &#34;cast of characters&#34; in the beginning (read it on Kindle).
B009ME47H2|5.0|I needed something for my music studio, that would allow for the recording of my students' vocal and piano pieces so that they might critique their progress.  I love the ability to share the recordings, letting me shoot it off directly via email for them to study throughout the week-- EXCELLENT!!
B009RI4ZKC|3.0|It was okay. kudos to Bruce for going old and dumpy on this. don't understand why the wonderful Frances Dormand took this less than meaty role.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Funny and entertaining.  My husband wanted to watch it again.  Will consider purchasing it to add to our collection of movies.
B003ZHQVJO|5.0|Love the CD. This is a CD that you will like if you enjoy Kid Rock's milder music. Love the song Born Free
1595141715|5.0|This book is EPIC! It grabs the reader's attention and captures in a way not quite like any book. An extremely difficult to read book emotionally, but worth every penny spent!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I read it without having heard anything other than it was a popular book. Had a, hmmm, visceral (?) reaction to the racy stuff that I have since seen was quite common. However, the story stunk and really didn't end so much as go off a cliff. Didn't know it was a trilogy until that point. Perhaps the story actually made sense later on but I have no plans to find out. The titillation in this volume suffices.
B002EWD0I6|5.0|I would highly recommend this Series to anyone who likes family oriented television.  The characters are so well written you'd think you known them!  Very sweet.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was recomended to me by a friend and I have to say, I absolutely loved it. I think it shows and teachrs a perfect how hard life can be when you are growing up and what can be done to solve your problems. I highly recommend it to be used in a literature school setting- as a teacher, it could be very useful.
B0094LYTO4|3.0|Well, this movie did not really live up to its title. To me a movie can't really be a cliffhanger because we are watching everything in one straight shot. Doctor Who on the other hand was brilliant at just simply leaving the story hanging drawing the audience back the next night, or week, to see how the situation was resolved. Cliffhanger was not like that. It did not keep me gripping my seat and the only thing I was waiting for was for the bad guy Qualin (John Lithgow) to die and the movie to end.<br /><br />I could end here because to me there wasn't much in this movie that I have not seen before. The scenery didn't thrill me and the cinematography wasn't all that crash hot (unlike Bad Boys where it is brilliant). The reviewers seemed to have loved this movie but personally it may have been breathtaking in the cinema, but it was not at all breath taking for me. Stallone's character does not need a name because the character is simply Stallone. He is a very good actor but when directors cast him to be the typical brutal action hero then I am not really impressed. Tango and Cash was not Stallone and that is what I liked. Here he was a typical clich&eacute;d hero in a different role, where as he might be a cop in one movie, he is a mountain man here. No real point to it.<br /><br />John Lithgow and his gang of thugs are pretty poor. They are just too brutal and evil to really catch my interest. They may have been cool and calculating in the air, but on the ground in the mountains they are just desperate, sadistic, and just running around with signs on their back saying \\"kill me please!\\" John Lithgow puts it aptly in his line, \\"I guess you want to kill me, well take a number and get in line.\\" That is in line behind all of the audience who simply want to see him dead for being such a pathetic bad guy. Bad guys are supposed to have style and sophistication. They supposed to know what they are doing and have a goal in mind. They are also supposed to be intelligent, especially if they are able to pull off a mid-air heist such as the one the pulled in this movie. Lithgow is none of these, he even lacks the intelligence to know that you don't kill, or even intimidate your guides. You play it nice and easy. But if they were to do that then there would be little room for your stunts. Personally, I could probably rewrite this movie to make it much better.if they are able to pull off a mid-air heist such as the one the pulled in this movie.

B008QTV3X0|5.0|I was previously not a Clare Danes fan but completely am one now! The entire ensemble is great with fantastic writers.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|If you have seen these movies, then you can make your own eveluation.<br />If you have not seen these movies then consider that there is alot of mental torture, mind games done by the bad guys.<br />I am sensitive to violence, personal viloations as tourture, so I don't watch these films.<br />However, my husband really like them. So I got them as a gift for him.
B007FEFLTO|2.0|What seemed fresh and memorable in Book 1 becomes boring and utterly predictable in Book 2.  Of course Nazi Party members are creeps.  All of the characters seem to be one-dimensional caricatures inserted to move the historical record forwards rather than to be fully realized characters interesting as characters per se.
B00008CMR6|5.0|I love anything with John Wayne.  Wanted it in my collection to replace the VHS that I almost wore out.
B0068LYEHA|3.0|I have kept trying to get past the 1st few chapters but I just can not do it. It is kind of boring.
0800177975|4.0|The Last Action Hero Feb 18 2013<br />Another &#34;Big Arnie&#34; action movie, this one with some comedy! The nearly-2 hours moves quickly, lots of action and special effects! Usual bad guys die 20 times each!
B00475AYJQ|5.0|When I read Fantasy Fiction I want to find a good story, believable characters and for it to be well written. I got it all in this story. Hope the last book is published soon.
B003YWPN08|5.0|I've always loved this movie.  Wanted it in my collection to replace the VHS that I almost wore out. .
B009VB9VKY|4.0|I mean really, if they cut it just to his stage scenes I'd have the same review. The dude is hot!
B0028KF4M4|5.0|Each season seems to bring more drama and hightens the need to watch the next season! I can't wait to have them all on my kindle!
B00AKCJB44|3.0|There are some really good tracks on here but I can't say I'm in love with the entire soundtrack. It has some bright spots. I just listen to the few tracks I am in love with and move on through my music.

1476719071|5.0|I love Travis, Abby and the whole gang!!! I have this book on my Ipad but had to have the signed edition!! My hubby got it for me for my birthday!
B002QNBRXS|5.0|Man, I'm really addicted to this series. Funny trying to put his persona from the first couple of season into place seeing him as a father. He was great with Rita's kids but the sleep deprevation of a new baby is different. I was shocked to see them kill Rita off at this stage though. I wonder why!
B008OUSFVO|5.0|I admit I didn't give her a proper chance when I first listened to her or ran across her name. After I listened to some of her music however, there was no way I could ignore her talent. Her voice is new and fresh and it has range. Lots of her music and her ballads are very guitar-driven and I like that. Her voice is just something you have to listen to. It can be calming and it can be exciting. I definitely recommend this album.
0439023491|5.0|In my honest opinion, these books keep getting better and better. You'll definitely be hooked and craving MORE!! This book is definitely worth your time and money. In fact, all three books are!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Quick read and a very cute story!! Even better...it was free!! I may need to look up some other books from this line!
B005D63ICI|5.0|It seems he nearly gets caught in each new season. I wonder how many seasons they can keep the suspense going?
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Another great story by Gillian Flynn. The twists and turns keep you turning the pages. Ready to read her next book.
0439023513|5.0|The story just got better and better, IMO.  Unfortunately, I now have a void to fill now that all three books have been read.  I wanted to shed tears at the end of this book from mixed emotions.  It is truly an amazingly written book, and trio of books, and the characters and emotion are so strong.  You won't be disappointed in spending your money on this book, or the trio of books.  This is a must read!
B0030V0PEW|5.0|I work on IT business and the checklist manifesto is a day to day reality on IT operations. Really enjoyed reading it. I highly recommend it for those who want to establish checklist on their day to day work activities.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|The last book in the trilogy will ruin your taste in literature, it's so badly written. I may never read again.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|One of the better books I've read. Very interesting and believable perspective of family relationships in the mid 1800's in the south.
0439023521|5.0|My husband bought this for me and I had no clue what it was about.  He had never read the book himself but thought it would be something I would like.  Just so money wasn't wasted and he wasn't disappointed, I read this book I had heard nothing about.  I must have been living under a rock!  Once I started the book, I couldn't put it down!  Staying up way too late at night into the early morning hours... rushing through feeding the kids breakfast and other meals... I just couldn't get enough of this book!  What an amazing book.  I couldn't get the second book fast enough.  This book is definitely worth your time and money!  Be warned though... you won't be able to do anything else until you've completed all three books!
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|He's not my favorite 007 but it was very good! Nice twist at the end with M6 but in keeping with all James Bond movies...is she really gone?
B005K01VZS|5.0|I love Mitch Albom and this is one of his best.  How much do we know about another person? I cried at the end and was uplifted at the same time.
1451620829|5.0|Major KISS fan since the beginning, and have been disappointed about how they have been recently with them \\"moving on\\" with Tommy Thayer & Eric Singer in the Ace & Peter make-up, not such a fan since then...he really bares his soul and some things about Ace I think shouldn't have been mentioned and I don't understand why he is mad at him when he only told him the truth about how Gene & Paul were screwing him over...wasn't Ace's fault and he wouldn't have known it if Ace would have told him. But he does bare his soul and I admire him for that and will always love the \\"true Catman\\"
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Fringe, like Lost, leaves you with something to think about and a reason to come back and watch more.  I've already seen how the series ends, and have watched a few shows over the years, but I wanted to start from the beginning and watch it from start to end.  And, in case you are wondering, knowing how the series ends does not take away from my enjoyment in revisiting the world of Fringe.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|I have been using Plex for over a year on my Logitech Revue (very nice, under-rated media player), and grabbed the version for our Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34; without hesitation. This allows me to stream all of my avi, xvid, mkv, mp3, etc. files to my KF. Works great and is regularly updated.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I couldn't put  this one down.  I suspect this is story is true in a lot of our towns.  Though maybe not all at once.  You'll have to read this and decide for yourself.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I use this off and on all day long.  It keeps me in touch with my out of town family....
B0071BGOJC|5.0|Intriguing book - It shows the cards you're dealt in life can be tough, but it's how you play them that matters!
B005LAIH9K|5.0|I enjoyed the first 2 American Pie movies and maybe due to growing up I didn't enjoy the others that followed. I didn't see this in theaters but I decided to purchase this and watch it due to the number of actors who came back for this sequel. It far exceeded my expectations! It was so funny and lots of unexpected surprises too! It is directly tied to the first 2 movies, adjusted for their lives 13 or so years later.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Loved every word in the book... So well written and believable.  I would recommend to every adult and child to read this.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I don't normally read romance books but I was told this one was also suspenseful and a page turner. I really enjoyed this book. The three main characters were well developed and the story written in their three points-of-view was well done. This added to the suspenseful ending. Sparks truly portrayed the twisted and irrational thinking of an abusive husband.  Some reviewers have said that this book is predictable but there was enough suspense and unexpected twists to keep the reader interested. I have recommended The Safe Haven to friends and now I'm ready to watch the movie.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Laughing out loud while reading a book doesn't happen often....but in this book it happens every other sentence. Fey's voice, wit, personality and brilliant comedy shines.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Very entertaining and addictive. I have played the original Temple 1 Game and I find this one improved. Good fun!
0345529057|5.0|A great collection of books well worth the reading. This is also probably the most cost effective collection I've found yet.
B008K9SG9K|4.0|I was disappointed that it didn't come with the bonus track &#34;Cha-Ching (Till We Grow Older).  I'm not sure what version you have to buy to get it.  Other than that it's full of good tunes.
B001C3KCSY|5.0|At first I didn't like Kings of Leon, because of the over-played song &#34;use somebody&#34; . So glad I gave them a second chance.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|OK. Was able to use the product, however it was difficult to determine when the download was over. Otherwise ok
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|this whole series is awesome and everyone should buy this dvd because its so cool and awesome buddy boys yes.
B005R32L66|1.0|I have a coby tablet 7024 and this locks up on start up. oh well, it was free and I heard this was a problem but I wish could be fixed
B007EC27QM|5.0|Just swipe the memory bar in either direction and x squared, square root and more show up. Glad I bought it.
B000001EHS|5.0|This is probably the best list of Def Leppard songs. They are all the hits you hear and love all in one.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|gotta have this dvd set. its the most important movies ever made. i love them for various reasons. all good one.
143911000X|5.0|I bought this item for my boyfriend for V-day and he absolutley loved it! It was a hit with all of our coworkers too!!
B009YQJ322|5.0|This is the Judge Dredd movie that I've been waiting 30 years for (Stallone's train wreck from the 90's was not the movie I had waited for and does not count).<br /><br />A day in the life of a Judge. Brilliant!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book series is just so powerful .THE HUNGER GAMES is my obsession!I so can not wait until catching fire the movie mockingjay part one and Mockingjay part two come out eek so excited!!!
B000QFW7UA|5.0|Who doesn't love this movie? If you don't then you should kill your self now and do us all a favor!
B008Q0D9DG|5.0|This is a movie that I saw a long time ago but will watch it over and over again.  I love watching movies and this is one of my favorites.  I am glad it is in Amazon's movies that way I can watch it when I want to.<br /><br />The plot of the movie is funny as well as the movie itself.  It is a good movie to watch when you really need a  laugh because you will laugh with this movie
B004TJ1H3C|1.0|The incessent yelling, fist fights, bickering and crazy plot devices continue into the 2nd and (thankfully) final season. I didn't think it could get worse after season one... but it did. I haven't found myself YELLING at my TV  for a long time but the SGU crew made me.<br /><br />I can't recommend this at all.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I attempted to use my fingertips and thumbs on my Kindle before giving in and making the purchase of a multi-tip stylus. Very glad I did. I am getting much greater enjoyment out of my tablet.
B000053VAF|5.0|here's another Kevin Smith movie that everyone has to see. it is so funny and so true. get this one right now!

B00005JM1F|5.0|Totally awesome. Totally awesome totally awesome totally awesome today is Monday, this is stupid 6 more words left. Almost there...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like this game and play if often.  Took me awhile of practing before I was any good but it is very entertaining I would recommend.
B000IFQLLY|5.0|Every one should have this album if they love DM. I just love it and think its great that is why i got it.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Sanderson drops a sloppy right on G.R.R Martin's face while back-handing Tolkein with the TP.  When he finished all that he rounded up Hobb and Jordan and kneed them in the groin.  He doesn't even have time for some of the lesser writers, his mere existence puts fear in their hearts and has driven them to wetting the bed at night.  He makes all other author's look like pre-schooler's scrawling letters with finger-paints.<br /><br />Best fantasy book in existence.<br /><br />That is all.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I'm hooked on the books. The show is nice to offer up the imagery, but the scale described in the books is immense and the thoughts of the characters provides detailed insights.
B008IJTFYW|3.0|I lost interest quickly, even my five year old didn't want to play with it long.  It was very relaxing though!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Go Alens! Kill all the humans and take over the universe. Survival of the fittest at its best. Love the violence.
B00846REIS|4.0|Steamy, busy story.  Like the characters & the non fairytale style.  Can not wait for the next book in the series.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I had been recommended this book by numerous people, but was skeptical based on the mixed reviews on Amazon. Am I glad a read it? Yes. There was never a dull moment in the book and I enjoyed it. I'm just not sure how I feel about the ending...
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book was just as good as the first in its series! I can't wait to read the next one! Katniss and Peeta are definitely my favorite characters, and I'm anxious to find out what happens in the next book!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Wow!  Couldn't turn the pages fast enough!  I plan on using what I have learned to simply leads healthier lifestyle.  Thanks!!!
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|This movie was totally about sex, filled with nudity but oddly enough that was not what I noticed while watching. It was about helping a very bright, intellectually fulfilling man who was physically limited by an attack by polio, to find ways to access the sexuality he felt he needed in his life. The performances were so engrossing that you barely noticed they were nude! I am in the health field, have dealth with young men who have had similar problems, young women who have suffered severe strokes, one does not realize what an integral part of ourselves our sexuality is until it is threatened or the function is gone. It is a touching, beautifully done movie.
B008XG1X18|4.0|A little confusing wasn't.sure how to do things. It just gets thrown at you.  Like the different idea for men.,women alike!!!

B008N1V11U|3.0|My son (age 3) got it to play.  He used it for about 30 minutes then he has not been back to play with it.
B003F3FJQO|4.0|This book is just as good as the first, and I look forward to reading the next. This series is AWESOME!
B0042UEU8M|5.0|In short this is the underlying theme of the movie, it makes you think about the lines between real and what is real to you. Sweet, sad, funny and very well done with a good message.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Guys so worth getting it ! Get it! I'm gettin these new calculators . I don't think it s bad. It's great!
1582701903|5.0|I can say that this is an awesome book!  My perception has begun to change for the better after having read this work nearly three times.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really addictive.I play it everyday and I have a lot of coins. I recommend this game to whoever plays it.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|I love this series so much that when a ball game preempted it I paid to get to watch the episode I missed. I hope it stays around for a long, long time. The actors and the writers are doing an amazing job, it is excitiing and filled with unexpected twists and turns every week.
B00BHAVRDG|1.0|Every Monday after a new episode, it's the same old thing. \\"cannot connect\\"  Can't leave feedback. Can't download. It might be easier to just pay for the cable and watch it on AMC, and get rid of Prime, and quit PAYING for episodes that cannot be streamed or downloaded on MONDAY.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|I watched the whole season in 2 days and I don't normally watch very much television!  Some pretty interesting minds in the writers of this series!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I liked seeing Batman back in action, along with a few twrist and surprises.<br />The one thing I do not like was how long it tokk to pull the story together. Although, with understanding of setting up future Batman movies. I see that Parmount had to take this rout.<br />The end result is, I would recommand this film. Two thumbs up.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not put this book down, it kept me me wanting to read more. I was sad it ended but could not wait to start the next one
B000HA4WTI|4.0|I liked the movie of  speed and how the director showed the way of furious driving in this movie. This to me was a explosive action movie that I found enjoyable.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|The book was a very good read and held my interest.  My only complaint was the ending, it left you wanting more!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The calculator is very convenient. Large numbers are easy to see. It's also easy to operate. I highly recommend this app.
B008220C38|1.0|It is very unfortunate that the key takeaway for every screenplay of Anna Karenina is this subplot of Anna's suicide. If you haven't read the book, please understand the irony: one of the main reasons Anna Karenina (the book) is so treasured is because of Levin, not just Anna. Levin is Tolstoy's autobiographical attempt to express his own views and find his place and purpose in life. Time magazine, William Faulkner and many others declared Anna Karenina the \\"greatest novel ever written\\" partly because it is so fascinating to read through Tolstoy's inner battle. He works to reconcile his atheism with his religious background, his political and philosophical beliefs with his newly found roles of being a husband and a father. The book is Tolstoy's journey to find one's inner balance. It is as much about self acceptance as it is about those who failed to find piece.<br /><br />I keep rereading Anna Karenina mainly because the overwhelming sense of fulfillment at the end is so addictive. I never thought to consider this plot a tragedy until watching it on screen. Don't fall into the melodramatic trap of the onscreen soap opera. Pick up the book and enjoy an incredible study of human happiness.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|\\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" had been waiting in my Kindle for a couple of months. I guess I was saving it for just the right moment. My new Kindle arrived last week, and yesterday I finally read the book. I think my own dog has been wondering why the television hasn't been on much. And after reading this book I find myself wondering what he is wondering.<br /><br />I hate spoiler reviews, so I will stick with things like the wonderfully drawn characters, most of them likable and a few truly lovable. I knew nothing about the book before reading it, except a vague memory of someone telling me about the narrator. So each page was like opening a birthday present. The reminder to listen more instead of interrupting in order to really know the person and what they are actually saying. The wisdom gathered as a result of listening and observing. All this wisdom has been generously shared with me, the reader.<br /><br />The book is stunningly well written. I wish I'd had the restraint to read a couple of chapters at a time and wait awhile to continue. That way I could savor it and make it last longer. But no, I was so wrapped up in the story and the characters that I couldn't put it down until I'd finished it. But I keep going back and rereading parts. This is the kind of book that will stick with me. Thanks to Garth Stein for writing \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain,\\" one of the top five novels I've ever read. And I don't remember the other four.

B0052RDHTM|3.0|I'm also one of Ken Follett's fans, but \\"Fall of Giants\\" was not one of his better books. Perhaps he tried to pack too many history lessons into this book at the expense of character and plot development. I found it to be very tedious in places and was actually relieved when I finished this book. I don't think I'll be reading the rest of this series.
B000002HNR|5.0|The Doors and Jim Morrison are alive.......on this album from well over forty years ago. Very good recording that highlights the strengths and the uniqueness of the Doors. The band plays great and Morrison's vocals are clear and strong. On a good night they were excellent and they had a huge influence on music, then and now.<br /><br />The Doors were the greatest of the so called psychedelic bands of the 60's. They were really a \\"psychological\\" blues and \\"Art\\" band. Morrison started out as a poet and he goes right for the jugular. He didn't just sing about love and sex and rock and roll and good times, he was dealing with the big psychological issues of life....Freedom, the fragility of all life...and God, death and madness. Hard to believe sometimes that a group like this was so popular. Morrison was serious about his art and in this concert when he gets to the lightly played and sung part of \\"When the Music's Over\\" his concentration is broken by chattering people in the front rows .....he yells, \\"Shut Up\\" at the top of his lungs and then asks them politely to give the singer a break. He then goes into the rest of the song and the hurt, desperate screams of \\"Save us ...Jesus...\\" No question about it, he was looking for answers to this huge overwhelming thing called life. I haven't seen Stone's movie but I probably will one day. I was living in those times, going strong and loved the Doors, still do.......The Doors, a great team, a great band.<br /><br />I believe Morrison really suffered for his art and he thought drugs and alcohol were some kind of answer or at least a defense against the crush of reality. He saw through all of the lies of society and cultural reality and that can be a very fearful thing. He saw and felt the fragile quality of all life from the tiny butterfly to the giant lizards and dinosaurs, to man.....\\"a killer on the road , his brain squirming like a toad....\\"<br /><br />He was an artist.
B00AL1ONN8|3.0|It not T.I.'s best album but still worth a listen. I'm not a fan of the overall production on this album. The price ($3.99) you couldn't beat though.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|Disappointed.  Reviews were positive, but there was page after page of panting and lusting.  The storyline was really far fetched and unbelievable.  How many pages can be relegated to lust?  Sorry I took the time to read it.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I got this app off 4 shared. I love it. it was free off the site as well instead of. .99&cent;
B009JCL58G|5.0|I'm not an audiophile, nor do I typically listen to this type of music. However, having loved the movie Cloud Atlas and the score, I didn't hesitate in purchasing this. I find it very uplifting and relaxing at the same time. No regrets with this one.
B005DB7NHO|5.0|I bought One Direction's music and videos and I loved all of their songs. They sing with such beautiful harmony and I can't wait for their next album. I bought this eBook because I wanted to see if the boys are as down-to-earth as they appear in their videos. I certainly wasn't disappointed. The five angel-faced singers all have heart-warming stories, and the way they all wrote about their families was wonderful. It's great that the boys all get along and take care of each other. They are now more than brothers. The photos in this eBook showed up beautifully and in full colour. The pictures give an insight into their lives before they became One Direction. Simon Cowell couldn't have picked a more endearing, compatible, handsome group of singers than these five boys. He must be so proud of them. They are all exceptional!<br /><br />Harry:<br />Harry is such a fun-loving and entertaining lad, and his voice is absolutely fabulous!!!! When I first heard him sing, I stopped what I was doing to listen. I was surprised to hear such a strong voice coming from such a young singer. It's beautiful and unique, but he also sounds a bit like Mick Jagger. It was nice to read that Harry loves his family, and I love how he treats his fans. If you watch One Direction videos, you'll clearly see how he interacts with them. The fans adore him, and why wouldn't they? His face and his voice are captivating. The fact that he's not afraid to cry in public shows how down-to-earth and honest he is. He mentioned in this book how he used to sing Elvis songs. Oh, I'd love to hear 1D sing Elvis ballads. That would be cool. Harry also wrote that he once sang Brian Adams' song, 'Summer of 69' in a competition and won. That's one of my all-time favorite songs, so please, One Direction, sing that one. Harry is fun-loving, endearing, and photogenic, (like all the lads in One direction.) I don't think Harry will change with fame, I hope not because he's unique. I love his voice, and his personality, and I can't wait to see what he does in the coming years. Stay you, Harry!<br /><br />Liam:<br />The first time I heard Liam sing, I was mesmerized. He sings from the heart. After watching him in music videos and YouTube, and seeing how fit he looks, I was surprised to read that he only has one kidney. My heart goes out to him because as well as being ill as a child, he was bullied. He even learned how to box at twelve and got injured. So considering his health issues, Liam is amazing, a brave soul and a survivor. He keeps fit by running, exercising, and eating healthy, and not staying up late. Amazing. It must be hard having to limit his fluid intake too, especially with the lifestyle he now has to live, and with his exercise regime. He's so wise for such a young man, especially having to manage the stress that comes with being in a famous band and traveling the world, plus sleeping in different beds all the time. Liam, your rock!!! You're so sensible and you're an inspiration to young and old, the sick and the healthy. Love your hair, long or short, and your voice and looks will melt any girl's heart.<br /><br />Louis:<br />Not only does Lois have a wonderful voice, but he's a natural comedian. He makes me laugh. Like me, he always seems to be up to some kind of mischief. We have something else in common. We both come from big families and went to a primary school in Doncaster. Yay for Doncaster! I wish I could sing as well as Louis. When I was at school, I was informed that if I wanted to stay in the choir to compete against other schools, I'd have to mime because my voice was so horrible. :( So mime I did and I went to the Singing Festival. I should have received an Oscar for that roll, but all I got was a clip round the ear-hole for overacting and embarrassing my class teacher. :(  Louis looks as mischievous in his childhood photos as he does now. He has a handsome smiley-face and I suspect he's the one the others boys tell their problems to just so he'll make them laugh. I bet when Louis and Harry get together, they're a couple of rouges because they are close friends and seem to have the same sense of humour. I love practical jokes, and I've noticed Louis plays them on stage. LOL. (So have some of the others.) It's entertaining, so keep us laughing, Louis!<br /><br />Nial:<br />Nial is also full of fun and mischievous. He has a magic voice and is always smiling. I love his Irish accent! My dad was Irish. Nial wrote how The X Factor brought his parents closer together. That was cool. When Nial plays the guitar and sings, he looks so comfortable with it. I love hearing the boys play their guitars as they sing. Nial is also down-to earth, which is great considering how famous 1D is. He has an angelic face and a beautiful voice and though the fans adore him, he's not at all vain, which is sweet.<br /><br />Zayn:<br />What a fabulous voice Zayn has, and a face to match. His eyelashes are so long and when he sings into the camera, he looks so sincere.  There's no wonder Zayn has a sensitive, soft nature. He has three sisters and many female cousins. I guess they influenced him and he saw what girls like by being around them, and learned how they like to be treated. Zane wrote how he takes a while to get to know people before he relates to them properly, and how he likes girls more buy their personalities than their looks. That's such a nice quality to have. I'm so glad Zayn's mother made him audition that day. Thank you Mrs Malik! Zayn, keep being you! You're not only kind and humble, you have a Hollywood looks and a beautiful voice.<br /><br />It's lovely how the boys are so close. They apparently ring each other when they're away and say how much they miss each other. How adorable, they're closer than most brothers. Hopefully, they'll all stay together as One Direction forever. And because they all have Hollywood looks, I'm sure they'll end up being movie stars too. And if my Angel Series was ever made into a movie, (hey, I can dream too LOL), I would only like one of these guys to play the part of the hero, (the good angel, not the bad one.) I love One Direction's music. It's so romantic and uplifting. Their music videos are fabulous and now I'm a fan of their books too. Now I see they've been to Africa and are promoting Red-Nose Day. I'll have to go and check that out.<br /><br />Keep rocking the world, boys!

B005ZUR724|5.0|This game will provide hours of enjoyable fun to any person that likes Adventure games. This app has little issues. One of the issues is the gameplay, the game runs smooth and there aren't tons of hicupps. But the bad thing is the display. They aren't the best, simple as that. You have to understand that there are 700+ people using this RPG at any time. The display cant be extremely good because the app could crash.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Another great novel from the Master.  Loved the coverage of Derry.  Always know I am in for a treat with Stephen King.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Super fun, platformer that collects coins like a 3-D sonic or mario with over-the-shoulder view. Beautiful motion, great graphics, and smooth, fast-paced gameplay. Best game so far
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Great story. Vivid characters and action.  George RR Martin paints a world in which magic and wonder form the bedrock of a believable scene of love, treachery, valor and deceit.
B009K72G8I|5.0|Best season ever if u have never been into the clone wars u will never stop watching it after u see this season also DARTH MAUL IS ALIVE!!!
B007SGM084|2.0|It was a top seller for a while and with all my co-workers reading it, I read it too.<br /><br />It was very bad.
0743289692|5.0|If you ever need to be reminded of what one human being can accomplish, read this book.  I was fascinated from beginning to end.  This woman gives a new meaning to the word \\"courageous\\".  I was amazed by her life in Africa, the family's move to Saudi Arabia, her father marrying her off to a stranger from Canada, and her amazing ability to just walk away from her old life and her will to make a new life in Holland.  I work with spoiled teenage girls in Brooklyn and I would love to be able to require them to read this book.  The authors life will make us all put our petty worries in perspective.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|I really enjoy the book about when Reacher was still in the Army. The plot keeps you guessing until the end.
0802798225|5.0|This book has such great depth and explosive chemistry in it. This is about a blonde white girl, Brittney Ellis who everyone thinks has the perfect life and a Mexican boy, Alex Fuentes who everyone thinks is on hardcore drugs and an all around bad guy. When forced to work together on their senior project Alex and Brittney hate each other and Alex does everything he can to push Brittney away. But they soon realize they have much more in common with each other than anyone else and are forced to decide if they want to look past their skin color and the judgement they are sure to receive from their friends and family and test just how perfect their chemistry really is with each other. Simone has found a way to write about serious issues and the dangers of being involved in gangs and drugs in a way that is sure to get your attention. You will love the way Brittney and Alex overcome all the obstacles and barriers that are put up before them. This is an all out great novel that everyone should read.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I quite enjoyed the trilogy.<br /><br />The first book was the best, in my opinion.<br />The second and the third book becomes less exciting, respectively.<br /><br />The movie was a huge let down, so if you're thinking about reading because you enjoyed the movie I would suggest that you do.
B004SIIBGU|1.0|Tried to download on my Kindle Fire HD but, it will not let me sign in. Keeps telling me that I am using the wrong email or password yet, I use the same to sign in on my laptop with no problems. One of the main reasons I bought the fire HD was for eBay. Very disappointed...

B006ZZAMWK|5.0|cd with free digital download.

B00BESLHEA|1.0|An ego trip homage to Bruce Lee type films only with even worse acting, crappy fight choreography and hair. Finally RZA finishes the disaster with his ego trip. There was nothing original or interesting in this film. I attempted to watch it but just couldnt do it.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Chose because it was a free book, but turned out to hold my attention. Predictable but wanted to see how they got to the \\"end\\"
B0045XGRQE|5.0|Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark would light up any screen. The nerd tycoon is a radioactively hot mess of emotional issues, swagger, uncontrolled impulse, and good intentions, and Downey makes the viewer believe in and root for him. For the grown-up comics fan the film sticks close enough to canon, and adds the fun of visually-rich world- and character-building. Tony's Malibu home, Monaco,<br />and the World's-Fair-like Stark Expo are some of the more interesting settings. This is a full-tilt superhero romp. As such, it isn't likely to share a footnote with Fantasia or The Last Metro in the history of film. However, it is highly likely to brighten your day.
B007ZTLLMK|5.0|It takes skill! We all have fun with this game. I like that there is the option of ways to control the helicopter.
B000055Y0Y|5.0|One of my favorite Eastwood movies. If you like Clint you'll like this movie! DVD is widescreen. Just get it. You'll enjoy it
B005LAII94|4.0|Hurts some when hiking ankles raw not as soft as I thought on top part of the shoe. Bottom good and thick
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|First off, I am not much of a country fan.  I was talked into watching the show by some co-workers.  It didn't hurt that I was a big Heroes fan that Hayden was in.  Not to mention Connie Britton is gold in about anything she's in!  I expected the great acting and characters but what I didn't expect was the impressive music!  The duet &#34;Wrong Song&#34; is my favorite but the album has several great songs.
B00464CU7M|5.0|Just can't believe the talent, beauty, and grace that is rolled up into this one little lady.  She is a pleasure to watch and listen to - whether speaking or singing.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The story was very good and the writing was wonderful. It was a quick read and I would definitely read more from the author!
B009BJAPLK|5.0|Very good modernization of Holmes. A season is three  1.5hr &#34;movies&#34;. My wife and I burned through this season over a weekend. Couldn't stop watching it.

B002QE3CTY|4.0|i thought this book wasn't a bad read but yet i found myself skipping paragraphs because i didn't want to read the explanations. LOVE how they're telepathic. SO cool. ;)) wish i had enough money to get the second. what is the secondd book anyways?
B009X2CVXA|4.0|This book kept me guessing until the end. Lovely story, beautifully written but very sad. Great reminder how it was so different between the classes back then.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|I liked the book a lot and my son too it is a funny diary of a boy who lives a strange life
B006M7JCC2|2.0|Redundant throughout. Too much focus on self actualization. Not enough information on the subject to better help understand OBE by itself.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I have nothing but praise for both this book and the series overall. All I have to say is, you will not be disappointed with buying this book.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a really fun and entertaining app that allows you to play for hours and hours withouth getting bored! Once you play it you can not stop, you are ADDICTED to the well designed game!
B0000033RY|4.0|Soy únicamente coleccionista de música de los 60 y 70 y no conocía a Cactus.Me han gustado bastante y no me arrepiento.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|OK,  yes, I am a huge Star Wars fan (the good ones, not the crappy ones)., but this version of Angry Birds is fantastic. First of all, you are dealing with gravity. You have planets and asteroids in space and you can use bank shots or use the object's gravity to get your bird where it needs to be.Second, the special powers of the birds are a big asset, although I still haven't gotten the hang of Obi Wan. Great fun.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|It's funny and cute and it helps keep the kids entertained during trips whether they are long car rides or a short trip to the grocery store.
B008QE9XD2|2.0|Library rental. Subtley ironic and really bad soap opera? Definitely not comedy, supernatural, horror or romance. Nothing at all like the movie trailer would suggest.<br /><br />Lacks the love or revenge or any plot element of most vampire stories, or any real emotional connection period. Pretty boring actually. Oh yeah, he's a vampire, he's just pale, I sorta forgot.<br /><br />Depp's deadpanning is as if William Hung (American Idol super-reject) were playing the character of Charie Harper. But without the good hair and charming self-depreciation, or any talent, or supporting comedic actor.<br /><br />And the daughter... a half-second reveal at the end &#34;wait, I'm really  werewolf&#34;' and zero followup? WTH?<br /><br />I was once forced to watched Finding Nemo, which was completely sappy, and it was far far superior to this.
1451638450|3.0|I love Bujold's writing, well, except for this book.  I love the Vorkosigan universe, and have been gleefully reading about Miles for almost as long as I can remember.  I was sorely disappointed by this book, however.  Maybe because who I really want to read about is Miles. Maybe I just like more adventure?  Maybe because Ms. Bujold had her teenage nephew write this book?  It sure seemed like she did.  The entire first half of the book centers around Ivan lusting after women.  He quite modestly rarely does anything about it, but when a \\"shriveled\\" member enters the description within the first few chapters, I knew I was not in my usual Vorkosigan novel.  On top of the myriad of sexual musings, there is not alot of action, at least not on a grand scale.  More like lots of talking in Ivan's living room (while he thinks about sex.)  So, I will eagerly await the next Miles adventure, I think I'm done with Ivan.  Hopefully her next book will return to her usual style of writing.  The book gets 3 stars for at least introducing interesting characters from Jackson Whole.
0780624890|4.0|Now that the Avengers has infinitely raised the bar for what a comic book movie is capable of, it may be easy to look back on past films featuring our favorite characters and feel somewhat underwhelmed. However, Blade was and is vastly different from most other films based on Marvel properties, mostly due to its &#34;R&#34; rating, and thus I still greatly enjoy it to this day. Wesley Snipes was perfectly cast as &#34;The Daywalker&#34;, who has all of the vampires strengths and none of their weaknesses, not to mention some truly unique one-liners. This movie is a bloody-good time (I mean that rather literally) and I'll always remember it as the first successful Marvel film.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I really like sci fi shows and am so glad I found this series!! It is fresh and funny and really challenges the imagination.  One of my new favorites - I just can't believe it took so long to learn about it!!
B002CAWNEM|5.0|People are confusing their feeling for Beyonce with this movie. The movie was well shot and very believable. It showed the passion of married women and to what lengths a determined woman will go to get her man and a married womans determination to keep her man. The fight scene was awesome. Ignore the haters, watch this movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Good game, easy to understand. There are a lot of different thing to do in careing for your hourse. Good for all age groups.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Slow to start. Really found it hard to like or appreciate anyone. Good ending, closing all the loose ends. Well written.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I had not seen the very beginning of how it all began.  It is nice to be able to watch the program without commercials.
076790382X|3.0|After spending two decades living in England, author Bill Bryson moved his family (including English born wife and kids) back to the country of his birth, the United States. A British publication contacted Bryson about writing a newspaper column regarding his thoughts on returning to America and on the differences between American and British living. Bryson's book, I'm a Stranger Here Myself, is a compilation of those articles.<br /><br />This particular book has sat on my TBR shelf for years, way before I ever met Dan. It was gathering dust for so long, that I didn't remember exactly what it was about, until a few days ago, when I plucked it off of the shelf and reread the back cover. I then got excited and immediately started to read it, as I thought that it might be helpful with explaining some of the cultural differences that Dan and I encounter and a timely read before my March trip to England.<br /><br />Nope. Not really.<br /><br />I felt like only about half of the chapters were even relevant to the theme. A lot seemed to be about modern life (computers, transportation, globalization) rather than the differences between the United States and the United Kingdom. I think this is natural, as Bryson often reflected on his childhood in America, but he didn't bring about a unique or interesting perspective to the subjects.<br /><br />As with most collections, some chapters were more interesting than others. I found myself skimming through about a third of the book. It's a quick read, although I wish it had been more entertaining and engaging.<br /><br />This is not to say that I didn't find bits funny. One thing that I have learned through dating Dan, is that the sense of humor between Americans and Brits is very different. Obviously it's different, but what I  mean is It's different in a way that you just don't pick up on from watching movies and reading books, it's much more apparent when you are surrounded by it all of the time.  Bryson's years in England havedefinitely made his sense of humor less American and it comes across strong in his writing. I don't know that I would have picked up on this if not for having Dan in my life.<br /><br />As a fan of Bryson, I am sad to report that this is not one of his best efforts.<br /><br />Please visit my blog for more reviews and bookish things!
B003L77GH4|5.0|I love the series.  It is nice to be able to watch all of the episodes without commercial interuptions.  I hadn't seen all of the second season...nice
1451675046|5.0|My analytical-minded son is reading and discussing this book in detail.  I got the illustrated copy and he reads it every chance he gets.  Every day we get to hear about fascinating things he's discovered in the book.  If only there was a second volume.<br /><br />Now I'm searching for similar science books for children.  I would love to hear any suggestions.  He's a voracious reader and (as long as he's interested) we want to provide the best science books we can find.
B001V5CIHQ|5.0|Before I saw this movie, I was frankly sceptical.  The previous versions of Peter Pan that I had seen I had classified as dumb (the Mary Martin version) and kiddy-ish (the animated 1950's version).  I was delighted when I found that Peter Pan is played by a boy in this version, and my delight grew as I watched this cinematic treat.<br />I have read the original book by J.M. Barrie, and I greatly enjoyed it, especially the 'lost boys' angle.  Most of this movie stays true to the book, including some of the dialogue and personalities.  Aunt Millicent is a surprise, but a pleasant one.  Jeremy Sumpter as Peter Pan is perfect--he is the roguish charmer that I always pictured when reading the book.  And Wendy--I couldn't ask for a better actress!  Jason Isaacs was also delightful.  In short, I thought the cast was superb, down to the pirates and British elite.<br />At first I was taken aback by the childish romance between Peter and Wendy, but I was pleased; I had always secretly wanted their relationship to develope a little more.  And I understood why Peter had to return to Neverland, even though he had found something to love in Wendy.  I LOVED the moment when Wendy gave Peter the 'hidden kiss', and Peter turns pink and eventually shoots upward into the sky.  That's magic.  Your heart just can't help racing.  I also loved Hook's expression: &#34;Split my infinitives!&#34;  Oh, that made me laugh!<br />And when I finished watching it, I thought, &#34;This is how I've always pictured Peter Pan--the romance, the adventure, the paradox of 'growing up'.  Something that delights children but also appeals to adults.  It's almost perfect.&#34;<br />I say 'almost'.  If there's one thing I would change--there's quite a bit of bare skin in this production, if you get the point.  That would be the one thing that would make me hesitate to show this to my little sister.  I understood why the producers had Peter dress that way, to make him seem like a mythical character, not unlikethe Roman god Pan, but I wish he had a little more on for the sake of any little children who watch this movie.<br />Otherwise, I just love it, and I'll watch this often.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Use it less frequently now because I spent so many hours of my life just on facebook...find it more fun now ...because I made it so necesary...life went on by///love it but find I can leave it when I want to now!!!!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Works great for the many things I must keep up with. School, two businesses, church meetings and personal things like bills, appointments and grocery bills. I just downloaded so I need to learn more I'm sure.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|WOW, what an emotional and crazy book, i would of never guessed what happens in this book and give it up for collen hoover for writting another book that is excellent!!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app worked fine..then I get an update. Should work even better(worked great before)  if anything..right? Not so! ! Now keeps freezing and have to force close!! I have kindle fire and fire hd 8.9. Sure hope this is fixed on your end ASAP!!!!!! Very disappointing :*(<br />  Update: This app works great now..no more freezing up. Thanks...
B00AA0U05A|5.0|It is so delightful to hear all these old songs sung in a whole new way.  Everything old is new again.  I have been listening and singing these songs for years, and sung by many different artists.....Never like this.  Emmy has made them her own.  We especially delight in &#34;Object of My Affection&#34;. and play it repeatedly on the car radio.  M&M
B00B2V66VS|5.0|awesome game would definitely recommend to all of my friends. the graphics are amazing and the gameplay is absolutely superb.
0765325950|2.0|A long overdrawn book that leaves you wanting more.  Feels like fan fiction I could have read online for free on some fanboys web site. I really think Michael Moorcock, Stephen Donaldson or pretty much anyone could have done a better job.
B0011E9LBI|5.0|I like this movie when it first came out, and figured my kids would too. My sons very much enjoyed this movie.
0316044695|5.0|This book was amazing.  I have recommended it to many and they have recommended it to many more.<br />The story keeps you at the edge of your seat and you want to read it all at one sitting.  Amazing story about what they went through.  A very special group of men.<br />I heard that some of it may have been fabricated, even so the book was still a great read.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Does exactly what I need it to do.  Nice wake up options...love the dimmer and weather.  Use your screen time you for all night viewing
B009JNXK88|4.0|This was a great retroe style graphic platform game.  Almost like Mario but better.  I did enjoy the graphics and the game play.  The controls were a bit of a challenge, but doable.  Fun game, easy to play, lots of challenge, hard to put down.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book had me turning the pages. We read this for a book club among friends. We all liked the book, none of us liked the ending but the author did a good job at writing it so I am sure, you wouldn't like the ending. Lots to talk about!
B00683JK9K|3.0|This is a fairly good puzzle app, but extremely hard to use on a phone.  Maybe it would be better on a tablet.  The graphics are great, but controls are challenging.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was an unexpected find for me.  The story takes a tragedy in life and makes it humorous and real.  I laughed and cried. I would highly recommend this to any age group 12+.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I don't usually get sucked into books I can't put down, but this was one of them. Can't wait to read the third one!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Lots of sound options, great quality, sleep timer. Falling asleep soundly. My kids relax easier and the tone is really nice.
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|Ben Affleck's account of this incredible story is spot-on.  For those who remember the hostage crisis in Iran, it is a must see.  I was only 10 years old when this all started and almost 12 when it was over so I remember the yellow ribbons, the adults talking about it and seeing it on the news.  I also enjoyed the bonus material included with the movie (I got the digital version) with the real Tony Mendez and the people he saved.  Ben Affleck deserves an Oscar for this!!
B005P9SLES|5.0|I wanted to see if the new series could stand up to the original. It is different and starting with such an event filled pilot definately sold the new one. I am enjoying the new series a lot and will continue to be an avid fan. I can't wait for the start of next season as I will defintely attend the preseason launch as I live on O'ahu.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I have read all the Prestonand Child books...luv them all.  Can't wait until the next one is ready for print.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|I like the series it a man soap opera the plots the drama action it's very entertaining and addictive to watch you will find yourself wondering what's next when you thought you had everything figured out thrill ride.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I really enjoyed this 'spin' on the traditional Mahjong game.  Got me hooked right from the start as well as other family members.
0618918248|5.0|Loved the book, and more so, loved how Dawkins took the typical scientific approach and applied it to religion or as I like to think of it, the Religious Theory.<br /><br />The book is taking a comprehensive approach towards providing arguments and discussions that few have the stomach to discuss in a public forum.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|The sacrifice Chris Kyle made for his country, along with all of the other soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines, is put on vivid display for us in this book. His descriptions of his training and his battlefield experiences are written very candidly, it was the way it was and if you don't like it, tough. He doesn't hold back in his struggles with his family and that puts a real perspective that many people wouldn't understand unless they personally lived through a loved one's deployment. I read this book a few weeks after Chris Kyle was murdered and it was very sad to know his words would never be heard again. But he was able to write thus book about his life and his experiences that his family will always have and I am sure treasure. An American hero has tragically been taken way too soon. My deepest condolences to the Kyle family.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I think this book was  excellent because it combined fantasy and a good moral in one book. I would  recommend this to everyone.
B001GAOY5U|4.0|Just a short comment.  The 3D can be seen on a regular set and Blu-ray player.  It's the Old School Blue and Red lenses glasses.  It works pretty well on my 55&#34; Flat Screen, although the colors are somewhat duller than playing it as a 2D.  It comes with 4 sets of cardboard glasses which are small for my adult head.  I cut the ear hooks off a pair and taped on an extension and it worked fine.  Anyway, it is a novelty seeing the 3D, but with the new technology out now, I think you will have to buy the equipment to see it in the future and get an even better experience for it.
B00AHHODH2|5.0|Convinced this book is heading for the big screen. I was drawn into this masterful story from the outset. A detailed build up of characters and setting, and then it was off on a roller-coaster ride! A fantastic assortment of characters, great plot, darkly funny, cleverly done, and a real page turner. The ending......well, what a great twist (indeed, twists all through the book), an excellent ending! I will definitely read more from this writer...
B008QTVNUI|1.0|I admit I have been out of the weekly television viewing audience for a long time. Circumstances are that I have some time and desire for dull entertainment that does just that, entertains.  But when did we become so complacent about pornography?  Is it so commonplace that it is needed to satisfy our senses?  I'm not a prude, but I sure don't need to see envy gesticulation, mammary gland, and hand stroke to get the idea of the scene.  If this is what we need to feel entertained, we are in trouble.  I bought the first season, watched the first four episodes to give it a chance but am deleting it from my iPad. I won't make this mistake again.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|This is about familial wounds and redemption. A powerful movie Tom Hardy emotes with little dialogue and Nolte is great
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This a great series that provides great entertainment without a mature rating that so many other series strive for. It's about time. Thank you PBS!!
B001NEXEEG|5.0|A star studded lineup of actors/actresses who are on the down hill slide age wise but are on top of their game acting wise.  Who really shot Liberty Valance?  I'm not going to give away the ending (you're welcome).  This is an enjoyable film that never got the acclaim that it deserved when it came out and that's too bad.  Good story, very well acted, cast seemed to enjoy working together and shows what can happen in the future when the present shapes who we think we are.  I'm trying not to be too esoteric here.  Watch the movie and you'll see what I mean.
B00AFWEPVI|3.0|I liked it but it was all ways blurry.  And my kindle fire only has an inner camera so you can only take pictures of yourself.
B0086700CM|2.0|I downloaded this free game for my grandson.  It's not one that I particularly like.  But he likes it a lot.
B001N09BDS|1.0|I thought I would like it.  The topic seems interesting enough.  However the movie was way too long and incredibly, painfully boring.  I just wanted those hours back.  Really.  Don't waste your time.
0525953728|5.0|I am not a military buff by any stretch of the imagination. Yet this was hands down one of the best books I have read in a long time, and I am basing that solely on the fact that I could not put it down. I blew through it in a weekend and loved every second of it. Get it, enjoy it, and you can thank all the positive reviews later.
B005LAII94|5.0|My husband and I loved this movie!  Action packed, a great cast of characters too, but would recommend for adults only because of the nudity, language and drug use.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|very good lots of hours of great entertainment. arrived in great shape and very quickly.going to use these as I exercise!
B00AYB0SX4|4.0|This is a really enjoyable movie. But if you don't watch it until the credits start to roll and even after, you will miss some important things. Stick with it, it is worth it.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|For the most part, this was a good sequel. The story kept me entertained, characters were developed more, and it wasn't totally predictable. The things that bothered me were some slight inconsistencies in the actual writing and occasionally the storyline was really far fetched. I know this book is fiction and deals with the paranormal and fantasy, but a good author can make you believe things you know aren't true. For example, the characters go on this long journey telling no one where they are going but yet another character just happens to &#34;find&#34; them just before a huge altercation is about to happen, and it's not really explained how that was possible. Overall I did rate it 4 stars and I did enjoy it. I plan on reading the rest of the books as well.
B006903GX8|5.0|Wonderful insight to this intriguing series. A definite must read ,for those wanting g a behind-the-scenes look and a little more history. It makes one wish she could be a part of it
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love playing this game.<br />It's great fun. I have wasted a lot of time on it. I wish energy was easier to come by than having to buy or wait for it.
B0063GORYU|4.0|enjoy this version almost as much as the one i have on my iphone.. much fun for when i am bored
B007KLEHUQ|5.0|I love Phil Collins, have watched this several times. Great DvD and very fast shipping!! Would recommend getting one if You are a Fan!!!
034580404X|5.0|Great read! I was mesmerized by these books, loved the ending! A good set of books for the erotic romance reader
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Very good and useful I do enjoy the alarm better than my phone alarm this was a good app.<br /> I use I  everyday now.
0446547654|5.0|perfect valentine's day gift!  This guy is NOT in the dog house!  She hasn't put it down since it arrived last week.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|There is little to say that has not been said before, I got this for our collection at home. I am happy it came with the digital copy.<br /><br />Great buy.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|My husband and I were very pleased with the fast shipping, and quality of the product. Even though it is a &#34;used&#34; product, it was LIKE NEW!
B004R6JG7G|5.0|Let's not waste any time with a film review here. This is the best movie ever made.<br /><br />I know it. You know it. The American people know it. Why else would it be re-released in IMAX 3D 27 years after it's original release?<br /><br />Obviously, you don't need me to tell you if Top Gun is good. Just let me remind you of one thing: Whether you are a pilot at Miramar Fighter Weapons school competing for the Top Gun trophy or just a civilian watching Top Gun from the comfort of home, there are no points for second place. This movie demands to be enjoyed in the absolute best format available. The Blu-Ray has resolution so high you'll be able to count the beads of sweat on Cougar's forehead and sound so clear, you'll think Kenny Loggins is in your house.<br /><br />You may be able to enjoy a lot of your movies just as much on DVD, but we all know that this visual and auditory masterpiece DEMANDS Blu-ray.<br /><br />Your DVD copy is in the ladies room.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I loved the season 1 and 2 Limited Edition boxed set of Downton Abbey. Great behind the scenes. Does come with the additiona Christmas episode also. Great price!
B008Q08EG8|5.0|Loved it. This is a truly engaging story. Couldn't tear myself away from it. Now I know why it is considered a classic.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|This was the first book that I've read in a long time that I literally couldn't put down.<br />Would recommend to readers who have enjoyed Mary Higgins Clark's best novels as the pace, suspense and mystery in Gone Girl reminded me a lot of her style.
B00683JK9K|3.0|I only give it 3 stars because when it got fun I run out of puzzles. Then you have to Buy.
B009GIPDQS|3.0|Not John Grisham's best. I didn't like the main character at all so didn't really engage in the story. The Racketeer lacks the pace of what I think are Grisham's best books (The Testament, The Firm, The Chamber) and felt very ploddy.<br />Wouldn't recommend if you're looking for something to really get stuck into but if you're happy with something to just read a bit of at a time then this would be a good book for you.
0307891372|5.0|One of the best RPG's I've ever played.  Huge game world, great graphics, very good game-play.  Runs very fast on the XBox 360 (as it should).
B007MAETA8|5.0|My son in Humboldt who is 30ish gave his old man this CD recently.  May I say that this old man is 65ish.  Someone Speak For Me.  Love it. I listen to it most often during my lunch break.  His words<br /><br />  Show me something I can be<br />  Play a song that I can sing<br />  Make me feel as I am free<br />  Someone come speak for me<br /><br />Inspires me to do my art.  And in so doing to speak a little for those who cannot, will not.  Just these four lines some days are enough to get me off my butt and write.  Born And Raised indeed.<br /><br />Yes the young man can even reach the oldsters.  My, my.  Because this one can write.
B006903GX8|3.0|I really enjoyed getting behind the scenes and getting to know more about the people involved (both actors and actresses, the house itself and the crew.
B00BESM14U|5.0|This movie is honest, real, and makes you evaluate your own life. I love a movie that makes me think, yet also draws me into the story line. Amazing soundtrack as well!
B000002HK4|5.0|Originals and covers. listen to the influence as interpeted by the best. These guys make music enjoyable. The mixture of the big medley made my wife smile. Now that's an accomplishment.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|It was everything i remember when i first saw it in the theatre.The color and depth were terrific in my own living room.
0307719774|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift for someone I know who is a writer and creative thinker.  He really loved it.  It has some great thought-provoking questions for each day.  You can look back year after year to see how your answers to the questions may change.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I chose this rating because I've really enjoyed this product.  Just happened to see it, downloaded it and now I'm addicted.  If you love puzzles, you will like this app.  Would recommend to anyone who loves puzzles.  Easy to use.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I hope that everyone reads this fascinating account of this man's experience. Talk about a life changing event. This book will be a wonderful tool for all who will read it.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|My daughter downloaded this game, and it is a lot of fun. Very addictive game, we cna play this game for a long time because it is challenging and fun!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|excellent book, holds your interest, believable story.  Jodi Picoult was recommended by my daughter, as I am getting back into reading.
B001GCUNYO|2.0|I purchased this movie because it was strongy recommended by a trusted friend and I was buying another movie anyway, so i thought for the price I would just purchase this one rather than rent it since my frined had told me it was a great movie.  It was just ok, I probably won't watch it again and I'll end up giving away the DVD.  Liam Neeson is good in this movie and it's a good action movie, which I normally like, but the plot was just way too far fetched for me.  I also found the character of the daughter and ex-wife very annoying, as the daughter was just a whiny spolied rich girl that gets whatever she wants and the ex-wife seemed very mean unnecessarliy to the exhusband, which made it hard for me to find any sympathy for those characters.<br /><br />Probably won't rent or purchase Taken 2, even though I know others I love these two movies.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season is Amazing!!  Moments that make you hold your breath, its like an emotional rollercoaster that has you crying one moment and yelling at the t.v. the next.  It has opened up a lot of conversations in our family.  I have enjoyed having access to the shows as they come out without having to have cable tv.  I tell everyone at work about my new find with the options to watch this through our xbox, using amazon.  Thanks for making it accessible!
B000PC6A3E|5.0|I have seen all three of the Chris Nolan Batman series movies and even though all three are wonderfully written, acted, and filmed, I believe this one that starts the series is by far the best as far as plot.<br />Keeps you on the edge of your seat through the whole movie.  Good back stiry into why Bruce wayne becomes Batman and how (with the help of his friends Fox and Alfred).<br />Must see this one to fully appreciate the third one in this series with Bane.<br />Must own on Blu-Ray if you have a Blu-Ray Dvd player and are a fan of this Batman series.
0452295548|5.0|it gives such a good understanding.<br /><br />I recommended this book to so many people.<br /><br />I read this book about 4 years ago, still no other book beats this one.<br /><br />I think if I find about 5 more books like this, my life can be a lot richer.
B0072NWJRK|4.0|This true crime novel takes a bit to get things set up, but once they are, oh my how it sucks you in.<br /><br />My fellow librarians will appreciate the backstory of how this true tale was discovered by French. In the Afterword he states that he was digging around in some archives and stumbled upon a box of evidence that Pamela's father sent off to the government, which was never really looked at and just put away in storage and then into archives.<br /><br />So just what makes this true crime more fascinating than others? Pamela was the adopted daughter of Werner, and her adoptive mother died at a young age. She had been away at boarding school in Tientsin and was home for the holidays. Because she was born in China but was also adopted by British consulman, there is an interesting assimilation into Chinese culture going on in her life that we don't often see in Western novels. Peking itself featured the legations and white districts for multiple different white Western countries. This means that because Pamela was technically a British citizen murdered on Chinese ground both the Chinese and the British police force had to be involved and work together in the investigation. Officer Han and DCI Dennis certainly make for a unique investigation team. In addition, Pamela's body was discovered in the shadow of the Fox Tower, and this led to speculation about fox spirits, which in Chinese tradition show up as wily women. Of course quickly the seedy underbelly of Peking is implicated, featuring a multicultural bunch of addicts, dope dealers, brothels, and more, and naturally some of the classy elite start to be implicated into that underworld as well. Add in the fact that the Japanese invasion was encroaching and toss in the first rumblings of Communism, and it makes for a story that is impossible to not find fascinating.<br /><br />French unfurls the story well. He quotes only when it is fairly certain what was said, but summarizes scenes well. A clear picture of both Pamela and Peking are rendered fairly early in the novel. I also appreciate that he spent time at the end talking about what happened to all of the key players and discussing how all-encompassing the Japanese invasion were. I think what he handled best though was presenting people as individuals and not representative of their race or nation or even class. In a true crime as multicultural as this one, that is important. It's also nice that in a story that could have easily turned into victim blaming, which happens so often when the victim is a young woman, he eloquently avoids any hint of that.<br /><br />I did, however, feel that the beginning was a bit lacking. It took a bit to truly get into the story. A faster pace or a more clear this is where we are going set-up would have been nice. At first it felt like the rather dull story of some poor little imperialist rich girl. But that's not the story at all. The story is that of an adopted girl in a country where she just so happens to be the color of worldwide colonizers, but it is instead the story of a diverse group of people horrified by the brutal murder of a young woman by a diverse group of sick, twisted people. It would be nice if that was more clear from the beginning.<br /><br />Overall, this is a well-told, historic true crime novel that manages to avoid victim blaming and also embrace multiculturalism. It will be of particular interest to anyone with a fascination for Chinese or WWII history.

B003TSEEDY|3.0|Would have perferred this in a story format. Otherwise the story itself was good but not the best i read
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I have found this as addictive as other Mah Jong games and I love the idea it is 3-D. The only things I don't like are that there aren't any levels to it and the directions are lacking.<br />Case in point: right after matches there is this graphic &#34;flash&#34; of light before another match is allowed and I am not sure if the game is malfunctioning or it is some feature of the game. Given there aren't really any directions, I just keep playing through it.<br />As for other levels needed, I just think it could be more challenging to start with smaller cubes and unlock more characters in larger cubes as your time decreases in completing the puzzles. Don't get me wrong though, I will still waste considerable amounts of time with this nonetheless.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I knew it was a good story when I would find myself explaining the cliffhanger ending at the end of each &#34;book&#34; to my disinterested wife. For those poor souls who don't find reading enjoyable-I suppose there is a &#34;Wool&#34; screenplay already being developed for a future mini series.
B0042FZWC0|3.0|-which, to be fair, the author declares in the book. He also writes about his book definitely being for a certain demographic. I'm a first-genration college graduate and work with low-income, first-generation college students -- there wasn't really anything here for them. He talks about shelling out money for grad school being a waste -- we help our students get funding so graduate school doesn't have to equal more debt. He talks about ways of being independently bringing in income when in reality his wife was working a legitimate teaching job. It doesn't sound like he's ever operated without significant safety nets -- which is fine. There is good elements to this book and helpful information. He does address that he isn't writing about methods that will work for everyone but then writes as though they will. So, yeah. It's okay.

B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Skyfall is a very good flick, and certainly the best of recent Bond movies.  The technical side of the film was outstanding with great location and crisp video.  The script and acting was way above the regular action film.<br /><br />So why four instead of five stars......two and a half hours is a long time to sit through a movie I don't care how good it is.<br /><br />Still think the original Bond, with Sir Sean Connery is hard to beat, even though they are becoming dated.<br /><br />I enjoyed Skyfall, and it has some interesting twists and turns.  Enjoy !
B005LAII1C|1.0|Unrated....Unfunny. You have to have more than 3 funny parts to make a movie. I expected alot more gross funny from a guy that does gross tv. He must have given in to the Career advisors.

B007REV4YI|1.0|This is absolutely killing me. Its hard to watch Dvd quality once you have watched blue ray so of course I ordered this on blue ray. Got it on the release date (I cant say enough how much I love amazons shipping) tried to play it in my theatre room - IT DOESNT WORK!!!!!!! Totally disappointed at this point I called amazon and they sent me a replacement immediately (again I cant praise Amazons customer service enough). Received the new copy today and this blue ray doesn't work either!!!!<br /><br />After the second one I am certain this is not an amazon problem. What's the deal?????? Who is to blame for me having to watch \\"Dvd quality\\" instead of blue ray. If I find out who is to blame I will never be buying any product from them again and make sure anybody I know doesn't either.<br /><br />What's the deal? There has to be other people out there that this has happened to. I would like to hear from anybody that has got shafted like I did. There has to be something that can be done! Is this going to happen on other blue ray titles?
B00AO686L0|5.0|I just love this movie. It tells the story of an honest man trying to do right by the bad things &#34;big tabacoo&#34; has done to make a buck. Very well directed, very well written. Execellent movie for anyone.
B006MQRLSA|4.0|This movie was good and I enjoyed it, but if you fall for all the hype you could be a little disappointed.  I would definitely recommend watching it!
B006MPKD54|4.0|I'm a big fan of Michael Connelly and this book doesn't disappoint. Great characters, good storyline - once again Connellly delivers with a punchy text that keeps you up reading until the small hours to see whodunit. Bosch is his normal gritty self, although surprises those who don't know him with his cultured side. Although parts of the story were somewhat predictable, not all were and the storyline produced a slightly unexpected outcome. Nevertheless the story is well told, the writing tight and readers will enjoy this installment in the series.
B0073PZIYI|4.0|Rented this on a whim.  It was actually pretty interesting! Won't say the acting was top notch but it was entertaining which is what I was aiming for.
030759565X|5.0|Love the stories and the recipes! They are inventive yet practical.  Very attractively designed.  I did not want this book to end!
B004X4QW42|5.0|Great acting, great action.  Interesting story lines and characters. Just an all around good movie watching experience.  Donnie Yen is excellent.
B003VTZTU8|3.0|This book was a required text for one of my classes, and while I will say that it is one of the more interesting books we have read I wouldn't say that it is credible in all aspects. The author rants a lot and I found the author using a lot of the &#34;bad&#34; science techniques that he talks about in the book like &#34;cherry picking&#34;, or throwing out some outliers and not others. I would say this book puts a good emphasis on being critical of statistics and other &#34;sciency&#34; things that end up as fads and in the news. Overall I would recommend the book but keep an open mind as you read it.
B0068AWQQ2|4.0|So I've been disappointed by the remakes of movies from my childhood and teen years that have literally been butchered.  This was not one of them!  Colin was great as the vampire, the guy playing the main character was so normal and likable that you just couldn't help but root for him.  Even the flaky vampire helper and his girlfriend were great.

B0099114WO|3.0|The movie was good but not great.  When it ended I was a bit unsatisfied, wondering, &#34;Was that it?&#34;  I like the premise and the acting but the progression of the story was weak.  I would have liked to have explored in more detail the evolution of a man's thinking process from complacent to engaged.  But I must admit, I liked the ending despite the weak middle of the story.

B008HK3XYK|5.0|When I first got my HD Fire I spent more time trying to be sure I left it in a place where it wouldn't get scratch.  If it was set on top of a magazine or some other paper item I took the extra time to ensure it was balanced so it wouldn't slide.  Now I just close the top and set it down without a second thought.  Thanks for the elastic band that keeps it closed in my briefcase.
B00B2166BS|5.0|I am so glad that some company has gotten around to making one of these since Samsung and Google offer little accessory support for the flagship tablet.  This product works great with my Nexus 10.<br /><br />It snaps right in and charges quickly.  Granted, I have no idea how much quicker but I'm sure other users have done the analysis.  Plus it doesn't abuse the micro USB port constantly anymore.<br /><br />This is a must-buy for Nexus 10 owners.

B00A861QMM|5.0|So far this game has been fun. It's pretty simple  but it has a good story line and it's free. I think it's a Greta game for the value. I've paid a lot more for games of lesser quality! I'm not particularly fond of the games that have puzzles so hard you're constantly using the hint button.
0312430000|5.0|A &#34;must-read&#34; for anyone who wants to improve their performance and reduce errors.  Easy to read.  Very impactful.  Highly recommended.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I was expecting a lot from this book because of the great accolades the movie has received.  I haven't seen the movie yet, but the book left a lot to be desired, at least for me.  It was a little redundant, slow moving... about halfway through I didnt think I was going to make it, but a friend told me there were a couple twists, so I stuck it out.  Wow, exciting &#62;sarcasm&#60;.  Fairly predictable not to be redundant, but redundant.  My friend loved the book so I guess it just depends on how challenging of a read one enjoy's.  &#34;Go E-A-G-L-E-S.&#34;

1400052181|2.0|I did not read any reviews before beginning this book but I did know that it had received many rave reviews.<br /><br />As I laboriously progressed through it, I found myself wondering if perhaps this story needed a David McCullough to tell it and that the author was my problem. I now doubt even he could have saved it.<br /><br />After reading the entire book, I did turn to the Amazon reviews. I agree with the majority of 1 and 2 star reviews and feel that little has been left unstated by those reviews.<br /><br />Although I tried to imagine that Ms.Skloot must have had some sympatico with Henrietta's family, at most times I felt that her endless, detailed description of this dysfunctional group could have been intended for nothing other than to  ridicule them for her own benefit.<br /><br />If these people have been victimized, it has been by the author and not by the system.<br /><br />As several have already stated, the lack of footnotes is an abomination.
B00355L2TU|5.0|Simple, effective. I have never been able to find a workout as effective and efficient as this. I lost 8 lbs in 2 weeks without changing my diet! If you are debating buying this, stop and just get it. I promise you won't regret it. :)

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I Love to play this game nonstop it is so cool I like everything about the game and I hope other people do to.
B000VUCIZO|5.0|Very easy to read book. Pretty much the closer thing to have a live conversation with Wozniak. He is a very uncommon character and this book is a window through the highlights of his life. Very recommended if you are into technology or if you just are curious about early silicon valley stories.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is epic. I was just introduced to it a few days ago and I lobe it dearly. cant wait for the next one
B007REV4YI|3.0|It is a nice movie but give it a month and it is confused with the other bond movies. I heard Wonderful reviews. Yes, it is nice and Havier as the villian was good but eh. He runs over the top of a front end loader but you see the metal grate for his feet to walk over it. When did they start putting metal foot grates to do that... Couldn't they edit that out? Just okay... average bond movie.

B009UX2YAC|3.0|I liked it because you get to run and buy other players....... at some point it was suckish..... and just for the heads up it might freeze on you....
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Never bought from a genre of music quite like this before.  However, it was the best Christmas CD I have ever owned.  It was so lovely to listen to and feel the Christmas spirit in.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I came across this book by accident, but did not regret it one bit.  I read this book in a couple hours and I enjoyed every bit of it....
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I like trilogy stories because I love to follow a family as they travel through world events.  Winter of the World gave a good view of WWII from a human side.  Interweaving historic events into the story give a great reference point.. Can't wait for the final volume.
B009EEFTMC|3.0|The game play is pleasant enough, and the graphics are well done, but the music is incredibly monotonous. It's just a 4-chord progression ad nauseum. It seems to run OK but then crashes after several iterations of puzzle mode on my Xoom.
B005K17RU0|3.0|All of a sudden according to this app I've moved to queens ny and there's no was to eliminate this location
B009329Y30|3.0|Worth the time and money due to great storyline but I just didn't like the casting for the couple.  Loved the kid and grandmother though.
B006XOBFJC|5.0|The other reviewers have pretty much hit their critical marks in discussing this set.  All I have to add starts with echoing their steady, high praise.<br /><br />Basically put, this by now familiar (if not also, venerable?) set has Staying Power.  I first heard it when first released as a nicely boxed Eurodisc set of CDs.  I listened for a while, then deleted it.  At the time I was just having some difficulty with staying power of my own as a listener.  I liked the familiar, famous, vivid Wagner moments for sure.  But I found the long narrative stretches taxing.  I decided for the time being that since I was not a native German speaker, I probably would always find the Ring a mix of wonderful plus boring.<br /><br />So let me start right there.<br /><br />The first truly outstanding draw of this set is the orchestra, hands down.  The Staatskapelle Dresden is one of Europe's greatest, oldest orchestras, if not a world treasure.  It was located in East Germany behind the infamous Wall for so many years that its reputation dulled or dimmed.  But, for example, there simply was no musical reason for Dresden to be disrepected.  Go back and listen to Kurt Sanderling leading their Brahms symphonies set.  That one has had staying power, too.<br /><br />A close second to the orchestra's abundant excellence is the sound.  It is full frequency, widely staged, very nicely balanced with the singers, and just about as tonally rich and exciting sonically as any other recording I could name in the entire stereo era of recording arts.  This sound quality matters, because if a listener starts paying attention, you hear and realize quickly how to Wagner the orchestra was one of the cast, if not the most important continuing member possible of the various opera casts that would inevitalbly end up doing his operas.<br /><br />So sound quality and orchestra playing are two large foundations upon which all Wagner operas must rest for those of us who listen on sound carriers, instead of attending live opera.  Make no mistake, this set will help show off your big home rig as much as any other set of recordings, including a high resolution encoding like Super Audio.  Strangely enough, Marek Janowski has been contracted by one of the leading SACD labels (Pentatone, the high rez sound team from Universal/Philips in the Netherlands, gone enterpreneurial, off on their own), and his contract now includes nothing less than leading all of the Wagner operas in new super audio studio recordings.  So far as the Ring cycle goes, I would suggest Janowski will have a very hard time casting his super audio Ring with anything near to the consistent vocal quality that was used in this set.<br /><br />The bottom line vocally is pretty much what other reviewers have said.  Enough super star voices were brought into the mix to leave a positive, lasting, distinctive musical impression.  The three stars of the first act in Walkure, for example, have probably never really been bettered.  Who outdoes Jesseye Norman singing Sieglinde?  You may like other Siegmunds, indeed; but surely you cannot gainsay Jerusalem in this set?  Hunding, sung by Kurt Moll, is just as substantial, gruff, and frightening as any opera manager could desire to employ.  If you've latched on to Birgit Nilsson for Bruenhilde, as many listeners in the stereo era will have become convinced and attached, you will at first find Jeannine Altmeyer's soprano voice too light, though heard against any other vocal backdrop besides the completely unique Birgit N., she indeed holds her own.  Stop comparing Altmeyer to Nilsson, and you will give yourself a nice chance to appreciate her singing on its own considerable merits.  Heard from that other angle, I would join other reviewers in saying: Altmeyer does as much good with her voice, and inhabits the character of Bruenhilde well, all for the musical good.<br /><br />The remainder of the ring casts are strong, too.  Just catch Cheryl Studer glimmering there among the Walkure maidens!  Our Wotan is east Germany's leading baritone-bass, Theo Adam.  Yes, at times his voice does sound somewhat worn.  It might help to recall that Wotan as a god in Wagner's operatic pantheon is a complicated figure, and per his text, Wotan has plenty of passing moments in the Ring cycle operas when he is world weary and despairing of his own omnipotence, bound as he is by his own godly oaths.  If Wotan were to sound world weary, the end of Walkure when he is grieving Bruenhilde's disobedience and saying farewell to her, might not be all that surprising.<br /><br />Finally, in this release occasion, the affordable pricing of the set matters.  If you lament your limited  budget for whatever reasons, this set is just not going to break your bank, steal from your kids' college savings, or mean you can never again have a pricey night on the town with your favorite date.  The quality of the set, however, generally considered, means you will get more than you pay for, guaranteed.  What's not to like here?<br /><br />Now a post note, if readers will allow. I must say that I am not dissing all the fans of the late, great Birgit Nilsson.  Yes, she was truly impressive on discs, especially in Solti's Ring set.  Once and only once, I got to hear her live.  The Met was performing in Dallas, Texas.  A music lover gave the music department tickets, so a small group from our department was chosen to attend.  One of the three operas for which we got tix was Puccini's Turandot.  Sure enough, Nilsson was present, singing her memorable Turandot, partnered by tenor ..., conducted by Mehta.  The whole thing was brilliant and wild.  The company was performing in a huge, cavern of a building that was built in the WPA era to multiple use specifications.  Aside from Met performances, it served as a very large exhibition hall.  The hall was so large, in fact, that all the sound generated by all singers (soloists, plus chorus) plus the entire Met orchestra fiddling and blowing away furiously ... well the wall of sound simply rushed by all of us in the audience, then disappeared completely into the remaining expanse of the hall.  These were uncanny moments, with all the music rushing past and no return reverberation.  Except, that is, when Nilsson and the tenor lead were challenging one another in the Riddle Scene.  Then all that singing and playing rushed over us into the hall's emptiness, and only the resounding soprano of Birgit Nilsson was large enough to traverse the hall and return to us.  Chills. Musical shivers.  All around.  Next day we got to hear Sandor Konya singing Lohengrin.

0345803485|4.0|While it will never rival the great literary masterpieces of any century, this book achieves its objectives -- to entertain a certain class of reader and sell many copies. Kudos to the author for understanding human nature so well and providing a how-to sex manual to the hordes of brilliant and beautiful 20+year-old college graduate virgins seeking to expand their education into S&M and beyond.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Fan favorite,back in the day and just as good now, especially in BD. I recommend this to all Sci-Fi fans.Good scripy, acting and effects

B0063IH60K|4.0|I play a lot of solitaire, so am pleased with it.<br /><br />I play and watch t.v. during the advertisements, so is real handy.
B000TTRGUE|4.0|I got this based on reviews and discussions in forums and other sellers' review section. The premise is simple enough: These rate favorably in comparisons with Shure's ubiquitous SM58, at a third of the price. I myself wouldn't know or appreciate the difference, as I don't perform professionally, but they both sound similar through the same amp TO ME. And they are BUILT SOLID! And Behringer is a well known name in the music industry, so I think your safe with this one!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|so far so good, have heard the second book is better, will find out when Im done with this one.
0920236162|5.0|We just received this book and have not read it yet.  It was recommended to us by a teacher so it must be good.
B00632HWOG|1.0|This app was very good until the last update. Since that time I've lost the &quot;forward&quot; tab. Now he app is virtually useless. I can read and reply but not forward an email.

0802473156|5.0|I think that this book should be required reading for any couple about to get married.  For those that are already married, this book could save or better your marriage, assuming of course that that is what you want.  It's an amazing book for the men and women of the relationships.  It's a quick and easy read but so full of excellent information.  Read It!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|One of my top ten favorite games, maybe even top five! It is so much fun and is pretty adictive. I reccomend anyone to get this game :)
B002L4QP0M|4.0|Very well written. Liked all the plot twists, character development and scene descriptions.  I could see, very well, the words turning into pictures.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|One of the best Bond's ever. Sorry to see M go but Ray Finnes will make a greeat new one.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I think it's one of best books of Orson Scott Card as well. I have read it a few times now, it's amazing how it never gets old. A good story about Ender, a child that has the future of the humankind on his shoulders.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its a really good horse game so life like I just love my horse Iyanna :) spool cute and just amazing
B00BESM14U|4.0|The movie was great. I had problems with amazon movie player though. price could be cheaper but the movie was mostly worth it.
B00271HAK8|5.0|What a fun movie with great actors, they brought together a superbly written story..  It is such a cult classic and will always reign supreme!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Fun and easy to navigate. Lots of scenery changes, love the zip line. I think it's a little too tough to level up,but overall a great game
B0036UW09U|5.0|I loved watching this again, I hadn't seen it since it first came out in 76.  Great acting and interesting story.
B0071XO8RA|2.0|I bought this book because it was the highest rated sci-fi book on Amazon. It was really nothing special. I kept expecting it to get better, by  it just dragged on.
B003730LRY|5.0|I will always love this show and really miss the acting of Roul Julia, he was great.  Angelica Houston makes the best Mortica and they all acted well together.
B00B10DZQE|5.0|This is a great movie for the whole family. It is well made and tells an exciting and touching story.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Season 2 is just as wonderful as season 1.  It keeps you guessing what is going to happen next.  It also keeps you hoping that Mary and Matthew will get together as well.
B00APKG70W|5.0|I SAW THE MOVIE, DIRECTED BY MR. HITCHCOCK, AND MY BLOOD RAN COLD. I FOUND AN EARLY EDITION IN A TINY ANTIQUE SHOP IN THE TINY TOWN OF FRAZEYSBURG, OHIO. AND NOW  I HAVE A COPY ON MY KINDLE. IT'S NOT OVERKILL, IT'S LOVE.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I absolute love this game I like that it has levels almost. I really love the train car mode type thing
B00BEL4P9Q|5.0|FIRST, I LOVE PBS. NO COMMERCIALS, WONDERFUL WRITING FROM AUTHOR JULIAN FELLOWS. BUT... HE JUST LOVES TO KILL OFF CHARACTERS.  WHY OH WHY DID YOU KILL OFF MATTHEW????<br />I KNOW, IT THICKENS THE  PLOT, AND THE SHOW WILL WIN MORE AWARDS, BUT I WILL MISS MATTHEW...CAN'T WAIT FOR SEASON 4.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Good surprise for my fiance he was happy owning the set for such a great price and liked the little book that comes with it as well!
B003CFBQBW|5.0|Yes, I Loved all of the Soundtracks, I have them all, now.  Thank You.  I also have, all of the MOVIES, but one, the last one~BD-Part two~. One of your emails, said I would get It on~MARCH 4TH.~Leona.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|Arrived in excellent condition! Way sooner than expected!!! Have not had any problems I am currently on disc 3!! Excellent for girls nights in or just unwinding at home:)
B008SVS3FC|5.0|Like most reviewers, I love John Hiatt. He is the most underrated/under-appreciated songwriter in these United States. As much as I am loyal to Hiatt's work. I must admit that &#34;Master&#34;, &#34;SOM&#34; & Open Road, had me a little worried. After all he is cranking out 4 albums in 5 years. I thought most of the three aforementioned were showing John a &#34;little long in tooth&#34; Then came a renaissance with Dirty jeans / Mudslide hymns and Kevin Shirley. At first probably not the ideal pairing. (SURPRISE!) Albeit a little polished , But in a good way - instrumentally John and band mates sound GREAT!. Then Kevin tops it all by bringing back some of the fun with Mystic Pinball. I just love Bite Marks ( &#34;need no teeth to eat my beef&#34;) the &#34;Stonsey&#34; - You're all the reason I need. - Crunchy Blues of My Business and the ominous Wood Chipper. Great clever lyrics, Great music, all from the Great John Hiatt!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I can't wait to see where the next books take katniss!! I really had nothing but hope she would win the hunger games.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I love playing PC games, i was using a Microsoft Mouse which wasn't bad, but i needed a better more comfortable mouse with faster response time, after reading a lot of positive reviews, i went with Ainker Precision Laser gaming mouse, all i gotta say is am very impress with the customizations i can do to this baby! really accurate and precise!!! I LOVE IT!!!
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|Somehow I got bored with hearing about SNL and wondered where the &#34;funny&#34; went.  Tine Fey writes well and is obviously talented and bright, but needs broader content to hold the reader's interest.
B008476HBM|5.0|With author Jane Austen, how can you go wrong.  If you enjoy historical romantic fiction, you will enjoy this book.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Perfect calculator, nothing more to say. There are ads, but they are hardly even noticeable. I use it to check my son's homeschool math. Easy to use, easy to love and it's FREE! What else can you ask for?
0062103377|4.0|Pretty interesting and there was a few things in it about Bobby that are not mentioned or explained in much detail on the show, but again most of the book seems to be just a summary of the show.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly never disappoints.  Love Harry Bosch. Just when I begin to wonder how Harry is going to &#34;save&#34; Los Angeles again, he surprises me.  Keep 'em coming, Michael
0061367036|4.0|Not a bad little book. I was expecting more of an A to Z encyclopedia type thing with a listing of all the different monsters and stuff. This was more like a summary of the show.
B00B1MJ02K|5.0|This is a marvelous CD.  I am familiar with all of the songs and am enjoying them so very much.  I'm so glad to have it.
B004PR71JC|5.0|I like put this CD in my car, with my kids, they love the songs, are very funny!!!!! I recommend it!!
B0036TGT3E|5.0|Disney have delivered again with stunning packaging and terrific graphics. I felt like a kid in a candy store opening this to find little leaflets etc and then waiting for the DVD to start. Fantastic.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|along with everyone else who's watched this, I think its by far the best thing on television right now. watch it and see for yourself.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|love the app on tablet husband is learning to play it. makes it easy on the go when not able to get to main computer
B0067QPVJ6|4.0|The latest version of The Thing proved to be a worthy purchase. They spent more time in and around the alien spacecraft and the effects were excellent! At the end when she noticed the chopper pilot had his earring on the wrong ear was a great moment in the movie. Our heroine proved to be SMART all the way through the movie and noticing the out of place earring confirmed all that! The alien special effects were state of the art and believable! This movie is definitely one for any Sci-Fi/Horror fan! If I could have given it 4.5 I would have but the webpage wont allow half stars.<br /><br />Mike
B008XG1X18|5.0|everyone loves this site can get all the latest ideas and they are fantastic. my kids and nieces use this all the time
B005WUHAX8|1.0|For what I paid for it, this case did not even last a day.  My grandaughter, for whom I bought this product, was very disappointed with it.
B007REV4T8|1.0|This DVD did not come with allowing you to copy to your computer, nor any Big Special Extras. Very Disappointed in that, as I could have picked it up at Walmart for 6 dollars cheaper and gotten all those Extras.<br />Very Disappointed.
B0034G4P80|3.0|Anything with Anthony Hopkins in it makes me want to check it out. This movie was good. I liked the character developments and the overall character arcs - specifically how Thor takes up his mantel and how Loki decides upon his.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Okay, I know I am a fish swimming upstream here (against 7,000 positive reviews), but I feel compelled to agree with the reviewers who disliked this book.  First, let me say I never read book reviews on any website until I have finished the book, due to spoilers and persuasive reviews. However, after reading many of the reviews, I want to speak for my generation (Baby Boomers) and say that the extensive use of the F word and coarse nouns used to refer to both male and female genitalia is totally distasteful in any media.  I found that her course language distracted greatly from the unique plot.  All I could think about while reading this book is that I don't know of a single soul who talks that filthy (either Young or Old).  So, if her purpose was to write a realistic fiction book, it never rang true to me that it was realistic.  I also kept wondering how she could write an R rated book to leave as a legacy for her children and grandchildren (perhaps all the money she is making on this bestseller is a trade-off??).<br /><br />The most positive thing about the book is that Ms Flynn is a very talented writer.  Her plot was unique and intriguing and was the only reason I could finish the book.  Her subplots were also unique and intriguing, but began to be quite tedious about 80% of the way through the book.  Since this book was her \\"baby\\", no one can tell her how to write it, of course, but as many of the others commented, the ending did not match her creative writing for the majority of the book.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book to anyone due to the horrible foul language that Ms Flynn felt compelled to include.  And no, I am not a prude----it was just the way my generation was raised!!!
B004EPZ07K|3.0|I enjoyed the majority of this movie. I usually don't have an opinion about casting directors choices of actors, but I do believe a different person in the role of Hector would have made for a better movie overall. The screaming sections where Hector was changing - well, I can just say that when I re-watch this movie, I fast forward through those scenes because I get tired of hearing him scream like that.
B000000OAN|5.0|This is my favorite Queen album. Has been for years. Enough said. I need eight more words to get these people off my back. Done
B004LWZW42|3.0|I liked this installment of the X-Men just because it was X-Men, however, I believe the other movies were stronger in several different ways.
B00001OH7Y|4.0|I think this was my 2nd Bowie album that I bought after \\"Young Americans\\" and I sorta liked it so I bought it on compact disc. So how about that review? Are you happy now??!!!
B0063GORYU|4.0|Just like the spider solitaire game for windows...only in the kindle system.  It doesn't do anything else than that but what else are you downloading it for?
B006OAB3ME|5.0|This is really old school Paul. It was also great to watch them recording this at Capital Studios in Hollywood, California. Tada.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Great series - can hardly wait to share some of these amazing disks with a younger generation.  Sadly, this may be their best chance to see the world the way it once was!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book started right where the first book left off which was great!  I really enjoyed the story and recommend it to anyone looking for a good love story with excitement and intrigue!
B00846F1YW|4.0|A very addictive game and you will not know how the time has passed away. Have been playing this game for long hours. Also being a free app adds one more plus point to this.
B002OPZ37E|4.0|Was not what I expected but I still like it, I'm more into heavier music and this album barely had any on it, still a good album though
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run games are always addictive. This being free app adds to the various plus points this game has. This is better than the 1st Temple Run and has a lot of options. The graphics is also very good. I thoroughly enjoy playing this game even now after so many days.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|loved the story and fell in love with the characters ... would recommend this book to all! appropriate for all ages
B0028DRGDQ|1.0|This movie was so horribly bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad. Even by my standards. I want my time back.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|This book is one of the best--or perhaps *the* best first hand accounts of a war I've read to this date.  It does not glorify war, but it doesn't dispute it when necessary.  A few sentences at the end of the book express this more eloquently than I ever could.<br /><br />Those who think wars are cool and think they'd like to be in one should read this book for some sobering accounts of what happens in fierce battles and how war transforms men.<br /><br />Those who fought in war(s) to defend this country have my undying gratitude and respect.  This book made it more real what they had to endure so that the rest of us can enjoy the life we have.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It has pretty Nice graphics and is pretty fun so far. It is also pretty easy. Plus its free!  Ah
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book shows great courage and love for life and the world at the same time. All in all it is an amazing book.
B000S88JTS|5.0|This is the movie that got me into racing.<br />The Best. On any Sunday is an inspirational movie for all time.<br />Love it.
B007REV4YI|2.0|Where to begin?  Most of my problems are with the villain, his motivations and modus operandi.  But also:  weak title song, weak opening sequence, way too much Judi Dench (AGAIN), we're taken inside a casino but NO GAMBLING SEQUENCE (I want to see Bond beat the crap out of a bad guy at Chemin de Fer or Poker)...  Back to the Bad Guy:<br /><br />Javier Bardem was riveting in No Country for Old Men, but he is embarrassingly blah in this effort.<br /><br />He's been what? waiting for 24 years to get back at M?  Why is this &#34;list&#34; compiled in the first place?  Awfully convenient for Silva to come along and scoop up.<br /><br />WORST VILLAIN'S LAIR EVER!  This &#34;lair&#34; could just as well been the blighted landscape of the 1970's South Bronx.  Why did he particularly have to go this this excuse for a lair?  It's just some abandoned buildings and a few laptops.  WORST LAIR EVER!<br /><br />Bond said Silva's escape must have been years in the planning, but MI-6 just moved to that building a week before.<br /><br />That last 45 minutes or so in Scotland just DRAGGED.<br /><br />This isn't James Bond.  James Bond should amaze and astonish, not bore and annoy.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|I give it four stars...but it's nearly five. :)<br /><br />I didn't know what I would think of it going in. I was 75% sure it wouldn't be my new favorite movie - I like happy movies, and I knew (even without knowing the story line) that LesMis wasn't. But it was a chance to hang out with two of my best friends for an evening, while seeing a movie that a lot of people were saying was really good...so I went.<br /><br />What did I think? I'm still not sure. Some of it was amazing...some I didn't like nearly so much. But overall, I am not opposed to seeing it again someday.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it yet, please don't read this review...it'll be much more enjoyable for you AFTER seeing it. :) Skip to the final paragraph for my final opinion.<br /><br />On to my opinions. They are an utterly random assortment of the thoughts I remembered after the movie. So if you have something in mind I didn't mention...ask me. Oh, also? I haven't (this is embarrassing) read the book. Really. And right now? I do not have time for a book that size. But someday, when my life slows down a bit (does it ever do that again?) I will read it. Promise.<br />NOW. As stated, no order. Opening scene! Fascinating. Amazing. Unbelievable. That big boat being towed with pure man-power into a gigantic dock? I didn't think they built docks that size in the 1800s. Or boats. Ummm, ships. Either way. That scene...I really liked it. A lot. Incidentally, the song there was also amazing...\\"Look Down.\\"<br /><br />Before I continue, let me take a quick side-track about the music. Point 1: I know it's supposed to be a musical. Point 2: I loved some of the songs, and they're still running through my head - impressive. Point 3 (aka the Clincher): I thought there was too much singing. Every time I turned around...there was another song. Not that I was literally turning around...but, well, you know what I mean. For me, the songs got old after a bit. That being said, as stated, I really liked some of them! I'll come to more on that presently.<br /><br />There were six (count `em, six) dramatic deaths. Like I mentioned, I'm a happy movie person. Bright, cheerful, everybody happy, and not too much stupid romantic drama. So deaths really aren't my thing! And these! I'll say more about the rating presently, but I'd say the film definitely earned its PG-13 rating. It did end up feeling like person after person was keeling over dead...or falling to their death...or being shot...but I understand that that's the way the book goes and the movie must, of course, follow the book - I wouldn't wish it otherwise.<br /><br />My favorite female? Nope, not Anne Hathaway. In fact, Fantine really wasn't a favorite character for me. Stop! Side-track. We're going to talk about her and her character right here, right now, before we get to my favorite girl. I'm afraid I wasn't exceptionally fond of Anne as Fantine. Admittedly, I don't know what Fontaine is supposed to be like, having no prior experience of the story...hmmm. Anne has a lovely voice, to be sure, but...I think her personality, her character, they're meant for light flitty films. Her as a heavy tragic character? For me, it didn't really work. As to her singing I Dreamed a Dream...well, we'll come to that. (I made a list and am mostly going by that. ;)<br /><br />Anyway, favorite female. Was Eponine. Yup. For some reason, I really liked her...which sounds weird. I guess I connected a lot better with her than with Fontaine. Her song, On My Own, was amazing. Possibly my favorite in the whole movie. And she was my favorite character! I don't know what it was about her... But anyway. She was awesome, I thought. Her smile is so sweet! Even though she really is a tragic character, I suppose.<br /><br />Randomly, I wasn't very fond of Cosette either. As a child, yes, I liked her. Sweet voice, sweet girl. But once she grew up...I think she mostly just bugged me, somehow. Equally randomly, the whole scene under the city was amazing. And disgusting. Because sewage is. But equally amazing. That huge complex...wow. This scene, like the opening one, fascinated me. And also randomly, because this paragraph is the random one...those guns? Wow. Scary. My first thought when I saw them shot was \\"Ummm...dangerous! Those guns are dangerous!\\" Now, I'm not one of those most unfortunate people who has a fear of guns - on the contrary, I own one and enjoy shooting. No, that thought was because they fire and fire quite literally goes everywhere! Very dangerous. And I'm glad I wasn't shooting one. And that thought...it made me smile. Because the second part was that \\"someone's going to get hurt!\\" Which was kinda the whole purpose of those guns in the first place...<br /><br />This...is really long. I wasn't expecting to be quite this wordy. But I have days when I can rattle off an entire book without thinking twice - today, for example. ;)<br /><br />My other favorite characters? I take that back. They weren't favorites, not really. But I, again, was fascinated! They were most interesting, intriguing too. Know who I mean yet? That's right, Cossette's evil and scheming guardians, Messieur and Madame Thenardier. They were unbelievable. And dreadful. And very interesting. I loved...that's not the right word. I thought it was really cool how they stole from everyone. I mean, it was awful, to be sure...but also really cool.<br /><br />And now! A few paragraphs about the songs. Firstly, the one song I knew going into this film...I Dreamed a Dream. As y'all ought to know, Susan Boyle had great success with this one a few years back. Remember? If you don't, go look it up and listen. To be quite frank, I definitely prefer Susan's version over Anne's. In all fairness, I've loved Susan's for years. But at the same time, I think her voice was perfect it. Rich, strong, vibrant. Anne has a \\"sweet\\" voice, much higher and lighter. I didn't like it much, though Anne did a good job, I admit. I enjoyed the way that the song theme was worked into the movie a few other times...as stated, it was the only song I knew ahead, so my ears recognized it each time. :) I also \\"enjoyed\\" the extra verse added...extra only because Susan doesn't sing that part.<br /><br />The whole Painted Ladies song and scene...most memorable. Quite horrible, really, when you think about it...not in film terms, but just the conditions that they're in. And what's going on. But I don't think you'll find yourself forgetting it anytime soon! Rather disturbing. I can't imagine how much work the film-makers put into that sequence. Incidentally? Some of that was way too disgusting<br />for me. Just saying. (I'm referencing the teeth-pulling...more about everything else presently.)<br /><br />Two more songs I want yet to mention. The first is One Day More. Wow. That scene was just plain cool. Was it just me, or did pretty much the entire cast get to sing parts of that? It was so neat to see everyone that way! At the same time, I did find it a little disconcerting...all these people, all different places, all singing this song? I know, I know, that's what musicals do...still bugged me. The second song to mention is Do You Hear the People Sing? And THAT is the song that has been stuck in my head ever since. It's catchy. And sad. And amazing. [[Addition: 24 hours after writing this, as I quickly read over to proof it...just reading the title starts the song in my head! THAT is the sign of a good song.]]<br /><br />Now, the touchy topics...the PG-13 content. Like I said earlier, there was quite enough to earn it a PG-13 rating, I thought. Many of the dresses had extremely low necklines (no doubt accurate for the period and country and people) and there was some other stuff of that sort as well...I'd really rather not talk about it, so just go read about in on IMDB. And then there was also the gore aspect...the producers didn't skimp on the blood and gore and violence content. So be warned - this time period was very violent, and this movie portrays it clearly. Be careful.<br /><br />Overall? Enjoyed it and will watch it again.orked into the movie a few other times...as stated, it was the only song I knew ahead, so my ears recognized it each time. :) I also \\"enjoyed\\" the extra verse added...extra only because Susan doesn't sing that part.<br /><br />The whole Painted Ladies song and scene...most memorable.

B008476HBM|3.0|Honestly, I found this book pretty boring.  The premise of the novel is a big &#34;so what&#34;.  I really am not sure why this is such a classic and by people swoon over Jane Austen.
1475143389|5.0|This book is very good. It basically outlines and simplifies what I have studied all of my fitness life (20 years). However, now I don't have to second guess myself because of all the inaccurate non-sense on the web. The program is simple, quick, and very hard hitting if you do it exactly how it says. I love heavy, 4-6 rep lifting. The 4 warm-up sets, in addition to the 3 working sets, are great. (Only for 1st compound exercise of the day). I have never warmed up properly like this before. The diet is tough but makes sense. Decrease calories for cutting, increase for bulking. Simple, but this book tells us the break down of the nutrients we need, based on our goals and stats, and when we need them. I have gone through every book from Arnold's Bodybuilding books to Cross-Fit's training manuals. This is the one for me. It's both training and diet in detail. Good stuff. Thanks Mike.

I liked finding this because I was so very much expecting it to be a wait-until-marriage romance.<br />- I liked the idea of the \\"Lying Grace\\" which works even when passed from mouth to mouth. Had interesting implications.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />- Romantic dialogue made my eyes roll (But I'm not an adolescent girl, so I suppose I'll let that slide).<br />- The author proved she knows almost nothing about actual fighting in a few scenes, but particularly when she said (paraphrasing)\\"the bones of his nose were shoved into through his skull, and into his brain. Killing him instantly\\". This is an anatomical impossibility which should have been researched and removed.<br />- Plot moves kinda slow until she leaves the court. Then speeds up, then slows down again. Could have been about 50 pages shorter<br /><br />The Ugly:<br />- Sadistic rapist for a villain made me say \\"Holy crap, this is for 13 yr olds?\\"<br /><br />Verdict:<br />Not really my cup o' tea but this will be perfect for my niece in a few years. Especially since her parents are Christian Conservatives, so it will be good for her to be exposed to something different.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This book was very interesting and insightful. A must read. I myself might actually use some of this information to buy more personalized flowers for special occasions.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|According to my six year old little girl, it is Better than Temple Run 1. Lots of fun! Great game!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think subway suffer is better than Temple run 2 because it's fun you earn mystery boxes and ask those cool figure that why I like subway suffer and change the theme it would make it cooler do it every week
B009YX02T8|5.0|I downloaded all of the Twighlight soundtracks. Love them all. Makes me feel like I'm watching the movies all over again.
B005USZYDU|4.0|I rated this book four stars because it was amazing. Even though I said it was amazing, it wasn't amazing enough for me to rate it 5 stars. I will defiantly continue reading John Grisam books!
B00846REIS|2.0|I should have known any book written after 50 Shades, would be exactly like 50 Shades. Save yourself time and money. Series is just like 50 Shades, but with a Gideon insteand of Christian. Really? Gideon??
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is one of those mindless time killer games, I often play when I cannot sleep... it's fun and doesn't require any skill.<br />Recommend this for anyone.
B009NPKTN6|4.0|I was in love the moment i relized everyone was  actualy singing the songs! Tom cruize rocked, aleick baldwin was great as always and the guy who stared in the film has a awesome voice and looks better and better as the movie goes . But it also has a comedy feel too!
B005HSL626|5.0|This is one of the best game  I have ever seen it is just a little bit you know, addictive. But overall it is a amazing game

B009ZXT4BY|1.0|I hate it, it only gives you like three minutes for each world never buy it<br />Especially if you like making lots of progress in a short period of time.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was the best series that I have read in a while. Had a hard time putting them down. The whole family liked them.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is one of my favorite books by Nicholas Sparks! It's very different from his other books. I literally could not put this book down once I started reading it!!! This is a must read!!!!!!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love this on my Galaxy S III.  Although I haven't many books yet, I enjoy the texts I do have.  Give it a try on your android, you'll be glad you did.  Thanks Amazon, you're the best!
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I loved the characters and the twist of the story.. what I didn't like was Sky's behavior at times. She wasn't the kind of girl that I'd like to hang around but would enjoy watching herself make a fool of herself. I liked it and though it was okay but not really anything more than that. I feel as if the book is slightly overrated.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Most impressive.  I love this item with my computer/MP3 player, but added to my Galaxy S III, I am spellbound.  Try it, you'll like it.  Its easy.  Absolutely a five star item.  *****
B004PGO25O|4.0|This book is a rapid read and a good refresher for the tips the author originated in The War of Art.<br />I found that there was a bit of overlap--I own and admire his original--but this 'highlights only' version<br />is very useful now that we all have a waning attention span. Insightful and motivational.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|A good movie.  Intereresting concept.  I don't like to take surveys or respond to &#34;polls&#34; like this poll.  Just selecting the stars would satisfy me.  I wish you would stop sending me polls.
B00AA2ONDI|1.0|A truly terrible movie.  It was slightly interesting because it had a young Ethan Hawke and River Phoenix in it, but mostly, just bad.  Even the campy parts were too bad to make it worthy of any kind of a cult classic status.<br /><br />Put it this way: my 8 year old twins - who loved &#34;I Was A Teenage Dragon Slayer&#34; (another truly terrible movie) - both agreed that this was a bad movie.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|I would never bought the rental if I knew it was about an Alcoholic.  I don't need to see that, I worked with too many men who were to weak to resist drugs or alcohol - so it was not informational or entertainment to watch this movie.
0988178532|5.0|Awesome story, incredible characters, and something else make this a powerful book. Outview a gripping read, which only slows down long enough to let you experience the many mystical moments. The main character and his friends are on a quest without realizing it, and we are swept along as they desperately try to stay a step ahead of their pursuers. If you like metaphysical adventures then you will love OUTVIEW!
B0079XPUOW|3.0|It started slowly for me but as I got into it, the concept kept me wanting more of the story.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I thought this to be a cool app. Kept my attention and entertained me. Didn't seem too difficult to operate. Great game.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|Love this movie so much remember watching this when I was a kid! Now My daughter loves it too! Excellent condition!
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Since I can't watch TV on the nights Season 3 is on this is the only way I am going to catch up.
B000002IJO|5.0|Yep, Target didn't have JP Turbo when I wanted it. I settled for Dancin Undercover. Didn't care much for Dance at the time, but this album kicked my ass! The whole thing is great! Was a RATT fan before this. Enough Is Enough is Enough to buy it for. Do it!
B004HD61KE|5.0|This is one of my favorite authors. I have read 80% of his novels. These are exciting, cannot put down stories with great historical references. Leaves one with something to think about.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|Not really working anymore keeps telling me some strange error message that I don't understand  and then kicks me off so in the end it just makes me sad
B001E75QGG|4.0|I have never understood the criticism levied at this film, the fourth installment of the Indiana Jones series.  It's a film that I greatly enjoyed upon first viewing, just like the other Indy films.  But maybe my willingness to embrace new things has helped me here.<br /><br />So what are the complaints?  Unrealistic?  Sure, but all the Indiana Jones movies are.  The melted faces of part one are realistic?  The massive pillar of cloud surrounding the arc?  How about the mountainside/waterfall rafting in Temple of Doom?  What about the beating heart pulled from a chest with no incisions made - the same heart that spontaneously combusts?  Or a knight that is around 1,000 years or so old - you know, the one that has the cup of Christ but has still aged?<br /><br />The ultimate problem is that people are nostalgic in regards to these films and that causes them to be enlarged in their minds.  It also causes expectations to inflate unrealistically.<br /><br />Let's first look at the plot.  Like its predecessors, it focuses on the time it is set.  The original Indy films are set in the 1930s and are modeled off the adventure serials of the time.  It's also worth noting that the occult was en vogue at that time.  Take a look at the golden age comics of the time and you'll see that influence there.  But by the 1950s things had changed.  UFO's were in fashion and science fiction grew by leaps and bounds (also take not of that bent as comics went into the silver age and became more sci-fi).  So Lucas and Spielberg sought to make a more 50s style film to go with the era it was set in.  Sure the action gets pretty ludicrous, but it generally does in Indy films - and that's part of the fun.  But we hold the new movies up to our memories - especially our memories of the feelings we had experiencing the films as children and this new film can never live up to that because we're not kids anymore.<br /><br />If you go in hoping for that experience of 20 years ago (or longer) then yougo in with a weight unfairly set against the film.<br /><br />My personal take is that this is a good Indy film, probably the third best.  Better than Temple of Doom and behind Last Crusade and Raiders.  All four are worth your time and each offers a different experience.  But the adventure is there.<br /><br />Set aside your expectations and you might find you enjoy it.  Don't expect an Indy movie to be realistic - because none of them are.  This one is a good film.  It's fun, it moves quickly (shorter than Last Crusade and only seven minutes longer than Raiders and five minutes longer than Temple).
B000YJ54DU|4.0|I don't know why everyone is on a hate parade with this book. I have read the previous 11 Reacher books and thought this was just as good as the rest. While this book did have less characters and a small town feel, I thought the plot still kept me guessing throughout. For being one of the longer Reacher novels (550+ pages), I didnt feel like it drug along. I can see how some people might get bored because while Reacher does stick to his beat-em-up attitude, his outbreaks are spread out and occur less than in some of his other books.<br /><br />Either way, I feel this was a great story and a refreshing take on Reacher.
B004CEUEWE|4.0|Good fun suspense / heist movie with better than average character development and not as cliche in its structure as most.
1449415881|5.0|We buy these every year - Scott Adams never dissapoints day after day! The pointy haired boss keeps you in stitches and don't you just love Alice. Even though I have my calendars on all my digital devices, I will still always buy Dilbert's Day-to-Day Calendars as long as they remain available.
B0052UYJDC|4.0|Decent book on minimizing one's lifestyle. Tons of tips and inspirationals. Easy to read, comprehend and remember. Hopefully, this will get me on my path to minimizing and simplify my own lifestyle!
0062082353|5.0|I purchased this after I heard he passed away.  I am a fellow Texan and too bad I will never meet him.
B000YPUFA6|4.0|The RE series is getting better with each installment.  This movie is predominantly about how Alice comes across a roving caravan of some of the last remaining uninfected humans.  They are trying to find a way to a rumored safe city in Alaska.<br /><br />The action and special effects both take a step up in this movie from the previous ones and the Blu-Ray DVD transfer is done well.  The images really pop in Blu-Ray.  The disc has several special features that are worth watching as well.<br /><br />By this point in time, if you are a fan of the RE series, you will really like this movie as it is everything that you would want and expect and is done better from a production standpoint than was done previously.
B007AJFSJW|4.0|Never ever thought I would consider a Keynesian ideal, EVER!  This book changed my mind and if all the world comparisons are correct?  we are in fine shape.  Not a Liberal, but this is a good read.
B0046MOVD0|5.0|This is the best movie in the RE series, including the following movie RE: Retribution.  By this time in the series, the series has gained a fan base and the visual FX and budget have really been bumped up.  Some of the FX shots that were done are reminiscent of the first Matrix movie and work really well in conveying the video game feel of the movie.
0345803507|4.0|I enjoyed this book nearly as much as the first two.  One has to susoend any kind of reality, but that's what this stuff is for.  Liked the epiloogues.
B009MO5960|2.0|I don't expect a lot from the RE movies other than some relatively mindless action, cool set pieces, and some innovative cinematography.  I don't expect them to be heavy on plot or character development.  I don't mind some plot holes or having to suspend disbelief.<br /><br />That being said, this movie felt like a throw-together compared to the previous movies.  It was a real disappointment after the previous movie, which I thought was the best in the series.  This movie is essentially an escape flick in which Alice has to move through 3 or 4 \\"worlds\\" to make an escape.  It really seemed like a 20 minute movie repeated 4 times.  One larger idea, more completely executed, would have been much more satisfying than this jumble.<br /><br />The movie sets up for a 6th installment.  I certainly hope that the people responsible do a better job than they did on this 5th movie.
0345803493|4.0|This book, like the first, was a guilty pleasure.  The characters were familiar and I was enjoying the unfolding of their lives.  My on;y argument with any of the three books is the overuse of words like snarls, hiss, murmur, and peeking through lashes.  Bottom line is I thoroughly enjoyed this

B00BDNCXTE|4.0|this jgb show comes from a run of shows just before the dead started a long tour that began at the capital theater and ran for most of the rest of 1980. as the new series of releases come our way from the new jerry garcia.com organization we can only hope this is just the beginning of many fun and interesting releases from jerry's archives.  3/1/1980 is a garcia band show which finds jerry in fine form. his voice sounds great, and we get a special appearance from his very close friend and writing partner,, robert hunter. this small fact is one cool reason to give this show a listen. nice song list with an interesting variety of garcia tunes. some work wonderfully and some not quite, but still worth a listen. sugaree starts things off on a good note and the crowd is fired up !! for me, catfish john works better as an acoustic piece. just my preference. how sweet it is finds jerry and the band bouncing along together in a nice groove. simple twist of fate is a pretty song and jerry's singing and delicate guitar work highlight the more relaxed atmosphere at a jgb show.. sitting in limbo, is beautifully done and couldn't be better. that's alright mama, brings the crowd back to it's feet but has me brainwashed as a merle and jerry tune so it takes alittle getting used too.. deal,, mission in the rain,, that's what love will make you do,, harder they come,,russian lullaby,, are real highlights,, all played superbly .jerry's guitar playing is super throughout and the trademark of the jgb sound which is oh,so cool and different from what he does with the dead...these are some of my favorite garcia/jgb tunes... then we are treated to the hunter numbers,, very unique style. you will be pleased to hear this,, a special treat and it's my guess the reason this show was picked as the first in this new series. the cd ends up with midnight moon light and dear prudence which i loved and is pure jerry .. fantastic.. all and all a nice night of music with jerry and the band....another reviewer compared this show to the kean college show from earlier in the same week,, to my ears that show is just a bit better,,, if you don't have either show start there and if you want more from this version of the jgb,then i think you will want this in your collection!!reviewer compared this show to the kean college show from earlier in the same week,, to my ears that show is just a bit better,,, if you don't have either show start there and if you want more from this version of the jgb,then i think you will want this in your collection!!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Fun, addicting, easy to learn. pic it up its free for now. can not wait for more levles. 5 stars.
0765357151|4.0|This is an interesting book that focuses is on the mental aspect of survival rather than the physical ones.  Many people can survive with their guns, and freeze-dried food, but are they mentally ready?  The story follows the main character and how he occupies his time trying to find out what is causing the epidemic and eradicate those infected who are near him.  Low on action, but high on thought provoking and I found myself coming back for more!

B007IXWL2C|4.0|Fast reading, not my kind of life, but enjoyed all three books and have recommended them.  At some point I will probably read all three again.
1401324649|1.0|Can anyone remind me why this book sold over 2 million copies? This book was not funny at all, it was more informatial than hilarious.It did not hold my interest from the beginning and it got worse as it progressed.I will never understand the hype of overrated books, it just fails all together.  I did not want to read about the people that surrounded his life but I wanted to hear about the man HIMSELF! Not the people that helped him, if that was the case, then it should have been written by multiple authors.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this book but it failed on all levels.

B009EEFTMC|5.0|If you like games like Mahjong you would definitely like this one. Similar to mahjong you have to match pairs up to eliminate the board until empty. Unlike mahjong though the pairs could be blocked. As long as they're the same they can be eliminated, blocked or not. Since the pieces are in a cube you will not be able to see all the pieces but you can rotate the cube to the left/right or up/down to reveal other sides.<br /><br />There are two modes, the puzzle mode which I described above and the attack mode. This mode starts out empty and pairs pop up. It is our objective to delete them and see how far we go. Strategy on this one is to delete them before more and more pieces pop up. Unless you keep it under control you will mot be able to last long. It beclmes very tough! Great game!

1475972350|3.0|[[VIDEOID:moG9R1FRTOZXQ5]]Time Killer is a crime-thriller novel that is extremely graphic. The plot is intense and twisted and provides the reader with quite the chase. See if our detectives, Max Larkin and Jesse Fairlaine can catch the serial killer in time.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Really enjoyed the story line. I feel this type of warfare could happen. A little scary for the future outlook.
0393343405|4.0|For a being a semi-scholarly work about the era of renaissance humanism, Swerve reads surprisingly like work of historical fiction.  Engaging narrative flow kept pulling me a long while revealing lots of tidbits about both the 15th century and classical antiquity that I had not previously known.
B0061P2L5U|5.0|Most ppl know kids with peanut allergies or someone with gluten intolerance or even those with MS.  I know all of them and the ones with the severe immune disorders are on my husband's side!  For me knowing the info in this book will allow me to make health choices and lifestyle choices that can curb the possibility of these diseases happening to my loved ones.  It is outside the box for sure, and not everyone will even give it a chance.  But for me it's undeniable that there are obvious links to current lifestyle and diets and the prevalence of autoimmune disorders.  The worm thing, it really is mainly a great strategy by the author to pull you into the book (although his experience with it is true) so you can see all the dots he connects for us.  Although non-fiction, I could not stop reading it!

B000FC0SIM|4.0|The book is great because it manages to give fresh, useful and logical information for new writers as well as provide encouraging words without being drippy or overly sentimental. He recommends a few supplementary books which I've found helpful (eg. Warriner's Grammar textbook) as well.<br /><br />Personal stories of his upbringing/struggles and being a writer are entertaining and give readers insight, as well as providing some background to his famous works; it's like an autobiography and self help book in one.<br /><br />I haven't read many books on writing, so I'm not sure how it stacks up with others, but I've been recommended this book on a few occasions, especially from professional writers, that name it as a standard on the subject and I can see why. Read it and start writing!
B004X2M3N8|5.0|Excellent series! I like all the Doctor's, yet, this doctor is very refreshing and quirky (as are they all in their own way). It always fascinates me how each new Doctor has his own personality that shines through. Yet, each is different in a new and inviting way.

B00A3AYI50|5.0|&#34;Home&#34; was a home-run the first time Phillip Phillips sang it on American Idol.  It is one of those songs you know is going to be around a long time the first time you hear it.  But is Phillips a &#34;One Hit Wonder&#34;? His debut album suggests he is truly destined for stardom.  &#34;Gone,Gone,Gone&#34; is another great song, as is &#34;Wanted is Love&#34;.  In fact, every song is one I want to get to know better.  And Phillips includes a less traditional version of &#34;Home&#34; along with the &#34;classic&#34; it has become.
B009EP3C34|5.0|The Album is very well put together. There was a nice balance between fast-paced songs as well as slower paced songs. Over all it was a very good album I rank it up there with Lady GaGas first two albums. And that says a lot.
B001BKG9SK|5.0|I usually don't review music, because everyone's taste is different, but I will make an exception in this case.<br /><br />This is the best album I've heard in the last 10 years, maybe longer.  Gilmour puts on an amazing performance, over two and a half hours long.  Not only does he play his most recent album, On an Island, in its entirety, but he also plays basically the ideal Pink Floyd set list.<br /><br />He does the beginning of Dark Side, a full length version of Echoes (with Rick Wright), and amazing versions of High Hopes and Comfortably Numb.  He even plays the banjo and the saxophone!<br /><br />For me the highlight of the performance was when he whips out the old Telecaster for a blistering rendition of Fat Old Sun.  Nothing like the original album version, he transforms Fat Old Sun with an extended electric solo that he plays so straight ahead, as such in-your-face rock and roll that it sounds more like Don Felder than David Gilmour... I didn't think he had it in him!<br /><br />The musicianship on this album is at such a high level, and is so non-stop from beginning to end, that you just won't believe it.  David Gilmour is not a young man, but he still sings as well as he ever did, and amazingly, his playing has gotten even better.<br /><br />It's without question the best performance he's ever given.  More than that... listen to it, and I think you'll agree that it can be argued that David Gilmour is the greatest rock guitarist still alive.<br /><br />Amazing.

0547564651|4.0|Paul Tough's book provides an interesting and thoughtful discussion of the recent evolution of thinking about the elements necessary for children from more challenging backgrounds and environments to find ways to develop the traits they need to be successful in life.  Tough argues that elements we'd think of as parts of someone's \\"character\\" - persistence, curiosity, resilience - play an essential role in each human's life, and that experiences that help children develop these traits are a critical part of their education.  Environmental factors may create additional handicaps for children from backgrounds of poverty and dysfunction in developing these traits, but those who can surmount these - be it from inner strength or exposures to caring adults and experiences that offset the environmental disabilities - can flower in truly inspiring ways.  Much of the book talks about different efforts to provide disadvantaged children with these experiences - work at KIPP academies to develop \\"character\\" training, the chess program at IS 318 in Brooklyn, NY - and these chapters are absorbing and, again, inspiring.<br /><br />The last chapter of the book, \\"A Better Path,\\" provides an excellent (and brief) summary of how Tough's findings relate to other education reform initiatives, with Tough cautioning that none of these represent a \\"silver bullet\\" that can magically resolve the U.S.'s decline in educational performance.  That chapter alone is very useful in surveying where we are at this point and the prospects for different paths forward in trying to improve U.S. public education.<br /><br />That said, the book is a bit rambling and disconnected, and Tough doesn't detail how each of the studies and initiatives he describes interconnect into an overall argument (the dose of realism he expresses in the last chapter about education reform efforts suggests he's skeptical about cohesive arguments and narratives in any case).  The book provides an important reminder about the significance of character development as a component of strategies to help disadvantaged children surmount poverty, but doesn't pull that together into any strategy or formal program.
B004ZA9HB4|1.0|This app hardly ever works. I do not reccomend the purchase of this app. It consistently shuts down and will not keep interface with my TV.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My husband and I started watching these about a month ago.  We're now on Season 3.  We really look forward to the next episode each night.  We'll be sorry when they run out.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is truly a study in great lengths to ruin lives.  But it was suspenseful and I couldn't put it down.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|After the first two minutes I shut this movie off and would not watch any more. I thought Denzel Washington was better than that. What a piece of trash. Nasty language, a horrible attitude and some sleezy woman walking around naked and then mounting him. That was just the beginning, yuck!
B007GFDVEE|4.0|He had it done in about half an hour.  I did find it quite a bit cheaper at a local store, so will be sure to do comparison shopping more carefully next time.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|Entertaining & isn't misleading....though can become addictive. Even my kids ages 8-12 like playing it. Lags slightly when in motion but I believe it's part of the &#34;stick man&#34; persona.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|Kind of a cross between a kid and adult movie, maybe leaning more towards the adult side.  It was a great movie and hilarious.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is cool I wish it would be a little faster at the beginning but overall its a fun game that I think is worth getting
B009UX2YAC|5.0|we'll it is like temple run but just so much funner(and for everyone how said funner isnot a word here is a word that you'll like better
B0058YPL66|5.0|Was very happy to get, missed the first few shows.  Now everyone wants to barrow and watch over and over.  Love it!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I always liked the game Solitaire when I was a kid with playing cards but this is much better!  It is so fast and if you pick the winning hand option, it is a challenge to make sure you do win.  This is a fun game for any age and especially challenging when not being dealt a winning hand.  Also got the spider solitaire which is more than just a challenge--it is almost impossible!
B004P8JPS6|5.0|I love the whole Reacher series, the simple enigma of an ethical man in an unethical world--an intelligent man who doesn't just wish for justice but carries it out without regard to his own well being.  The concept of the character provides many fascinating, thought-provoking stories.  What's more, the stories are well-constructed and well-written and draw detailed pictures of the action and the setting.  This particular story is set in a small southern town whose economy is fueled by a nearby army ranger training center.  Major Reacher is sent to protect the reputation of the army.  His personal imperative, of course, is to first seek truth and justice.  A great read!
B000FC2OHA|5.0|Anyone looking to improve themselves and their lives will love this book.  Written in easy to understand format with many real life stories of people just like us who have turned their lives around, this book is very inspiring.  It gives a can do, positive attitude to the person reading it---making them want to make things happen and know that they can be successful if they just put these principles into place in their lives.  I would recommend this book to anyone, any age---it applies to young people, middle aged, and senior people!  Jack Canfield is a great writer and he has a winner in this book!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Nicely setup. very fun to pass time with. Almost as good as playing on a desktop. would recommend to solitaire fans.
B001NLL93W|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading the mortal instrument series & would highly recommend to anyone who likes this theme of fiction. My only drawback is the beginning storyline between Clary & Jace was a tad drawn out. I was definitely hooked though, no doubt. It vaguely reminded me of my daughter's long ago fave tv show Charmed. It takes a lot to keep me interested as I am a mood reader of usual, but this had me from book 1
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I read this book after hearing about the tragic murder of Chris Kyle.  I am convinced that this man was a true American Hero.  He admittedly had his faults as he struggled with his warrior side vs his family side, but we should all be thankful for heroes like him who sacrificed many things for our freedoms. I would definitely recommend you read this book.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|I really didn't care about this app you watch it and it leave's videos in you memory.  And I hope they make a main app for youtube on the kindle.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|It's nice to have Rebus back.  I was afraid I wouldn't ever read a new investigation by this man with troubles with authority and personal demons.  The writing is as good as ever.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The format of this book allowed me to submerge into the life and mind of Charlie, experiencing his life in a way that was intimate. It may read in a \\"flippant\\" way in that the prose is more along the lines of what a kid might write, but that's the point to me. It's an experience that is different than a typical narrative account in third person and even differs from some first person that doesn't get as up close and personal as this book. Well done and it does the job of revealing a teen's take on life. Loved it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this.  No problems.  Download on Kindle HD was fast and easy.  I play this one everyday.  I like how smooth the game experience is.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|A tad too much Corey &#34;wit&#34; but fun. Easy airplane read. Makes one wonder what really might go on in our agencies.
B000SGRONM|4.0|David Sedaris always delivers a great story. I giggled all the way through this book. Can't wait to read another!
B00AGOGOLE|4.0|My only complaint is that I had to purchase the application to activate the camera on my Kindle Fire HD.
B005M0R4X4|5.0|This is a wonderful series! Definitely a good purchase. Can't wait to wait series 3! I think that blue rays can be played on any dvd player regardless of the region i.e. I do not think blue ray players are region specific, so that's very useful when trying to see whether this is from the UK or the US.
B0086213XW|2.0|\\"Take This Waltz\\" is like a lollipop somebody left on the sidewalk: pretty in a bizarre way, but offending in its carelessness and vapidness.<br /><br />Here's the plot, boiled down to its essence.  A quirky, rather smudgy character named Margot (Michelle Williams), who lives in a sort of colorfully bohemian section of Toronto, dreams of running away with an intense young artist(Luke Kirby) who has moved in across the street from her.  But she is tormented by the idea of hurting her sensitive but lunkish husband (Seth Rogen).<br /><br />In the hands of a novice director, Sarah Polley, the result is a complete mishmash.  Let me list the ways:<br /><br />1) The film has no inner logic.  Instead, Polley just tries a lot of different approaches.  Cameras at calf level, then fast forwarding through a montage of scenes in a loft, and an embarrassing series of head-shot takes of a redfaced Seth Rogen reacting to Williams' infidelity, to give only a few examples.<br /><br />2) Shooting the movie in high-key only adds to the intensity of the hard candy colors that predominate.  Beware of this movie if you are at all prone to migraine headaches, because you'll think you are experiencing an \\"aura\\".<br /><br />3) All the characters in the movie perform as though they are living in a post-adolescent haze/hangover.  Polley could have been trying for a low-key ensemble movie like \\"Return of the Seacaucus Seven\\", but here the characters seem really immature and selfish even for late-twenty somethings.  The actors can't flesh out the roles because they seem stuck in rote situations with nothing to do.<br /><br />Last take: This is a plodding movie with a palette so sweet it will make your teeth hurt.  The only thing mildly intriguing about it is the quaint locale it is shot in. \\"Indie\\" movies are probably great vehicles for young directors to learn things, and I give Polley credit for trying.  But even measured by the wide latitudes given \\"indies\\", this film is remarkably and sometimes painfully self-indulgent.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book is very well written and I found it hard to put down. I chose the book because the subject matter piqued my interest. My heart went out to Victoria and the adversity that she had to endure growing up without parents to love her. It is sad to realize that thousands of foster children live this life.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I've never used the unbox player before, but the TV shows have great resolution.  My fiancee and I watch an episode every night.  It's much better than ordering and watching for the physical DVDs.  I love this show!
0307352145|4.0|I bought this for my introvert daughter who was extremely quiet in elementary school & still likes her private time.  The good news is that she was bright & talented enough to be accepted into a highly rated college where she could really shine & relate to lots of friends like herself.  Now a self-reliant, independent young woman working in a great job that she loves!  Parents, have faith!
B005COO1X6|3.0|Short enough so that you won't be up all night turning the pages.<br /><br />Stephen King has blessed us many times.  I wish I could say Mile 81 is great literature, but it's enjoyable.<br /><br />No explanation of where the antagonist came from or what it means, which is sometimes fine but here seems random and perplexing.<br /><br />Some characters worth getting to know, even some likable ones (although are all the adolescent boys in King's stories like Mark Petrie?).<br /><br />Story is definitely not worth more than $0.99.  I think I paid 2.99.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is frustratingly fun and addictive. Great for all ages. Never gets boring. Challenges you mind and also you quick reflexes.
0374275637|5.0|A book full of wisdom and beautiful insights! If you're into the Judgement and Decision literature, you'll already know a lot of what's in here - but nevertheless, this is a fantastic overview. Kahneman takes all of his and his colleagues work from many decades and puts it into this beautifully written tome that will be remembered as a landmark book for years to come. The thread is beautifully woven and there's a lot of continuity and consistency from chapter to chapter, which all nicely build on each other and lead you through vast amounts of different studies.<br /><br />The book has a lot of practical applications for business, management, policy making or just for personal well-being and good thinking... but other than these pesky brain gym books, or these boasting management books... this one is based on years of thorough scientific research.<br /><br />While most of the chapters are fairly accessible to everyone, there's a few chapters that require a bit of math affinity. But even if you're not into this stuff - buy this book... there's just so much wisdom in it!
B007UXSKMU|5.0|I liked this preview very much, and while it hasn't made the top of my wish list yet, it definitely made me add this movie to my wish list.
B008D30K7E|4.0|It was a very pleasant read.  You forgot that this kind of activity is not usual for the age!! and you &#34;rooted&#34; for the character and his antics.  A lot of &#34;smiley&#34; times throughout the read.
B0000029LG|5.0|I popped this album back in today for the first time in a few years and listened the whole thing through. I think the last time I did that was when I was around 11 years old. Back when I was young I really enjoyed the music and some of the lyrical content which now hits me on a different level now that I'm older. This really speaks of Michael's ability to reach all generations and ages.<br /><br />It's amazing how intricate his lyrics can be, throwing in vocabulary more than your average &#34;simple word&#34; lyrics and some real intellectual content to chew over and analyze. This album seems to be centered around politics and history, sociological issues (like in the song Little Suzie which creeps me the F out by the way,) that sort of thing. That simple fact... I mean how many artists these days even have a solid theme to their album? There's statement after statement but it doesn't feel like he's shoving it down your throat and it doesn't make you feel like you go through an ordeal listening to the album.<br /><br />As for the music itself... Classic Michael. Heavy bass and beats, complicated rhythms and intricate melodies, songs you can certainly dance to and beautiful melodies such as &#34;Earth Song&#34; and &#34;You Are Not Alone.&#34; It's MJ- You can expect good music.<br /><br />There are obscenities here and there for those of you whom it bothers but it's Michael, there's a point to them. He wouldn't throw them in for nothing.<br /><br />Overall an album that can stand the test of time and grow with the listener (well it did with me.) Every time you listen to it you'll discover something new in the songs that you didn't notice before.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Excellent clean reading.  It was sometimes hard to understand and that is why I didn't give it five stars.  Overall it was great.
B003ZJ70W4|5.0|wife loved this movie. Other reviewers didn't.Their opinion! Loved the difference in cultures to our own, would not go over there, but loved seeing the scenery
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book honestly is really good and I think there should be a whole series of books like this one because a lot of people in my opinion would love to read more about a \\"character with a secret\\"
B009XTF8KQ|5.0|We enjoyed this movie. Wife had seen a story on Syfy or something about this box and told me about it, when this movie came out I told her to get it. Even though it didn't follow the original story line, it was a great movie
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|LOVE it just what I needed.very happy with what I can do. I have no complaints. If you need a calculator try this.

B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is very realistic. And too much fun. I was addicted for the first hour and still am. I would recommend this game to anyone who wants to play a game to occupy time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The problem with a book this good is having to put it down to do things like eat and sleep. Buying book 2 now
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Great story about pilots on different sides of the war that fought hard but also with their hearts.<br />The focus is on the German pilot, his family, and their \\"anti\\" Party allegiance.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I love all of the Vince Flynn books, and this one was certainly not a disappointment!!!  I love the Mitch Rapp character.  I didn't want to put this book down!
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I think this is a tough starting novel but once involved you can't put it down.  It is wonderful read, adventure through characters and time.
B0058WFO06|3.0|I have been trying to follow Steven Wilson's career as much as I can since I learned of him shortly after Porcupine Tree's 'In Absentia' was released. Like many people that was, unfortunately, my first encounter with Porcupine Tree or Steven Wilson; I felt a bit cheated for not having heard them sooner. So now ai try to keep up with Wilson's various projects.<br /><br />Having very much enjoyed 'Insurgentes,' I thought that this album would provide equal enjoyment. Naturally there are things that irk me with most any album, 'Insurgentes' included. But as a whole I felt tha it was a solid record. When it came to 'Grace for Drowning,' however, my reaction landed on more disappointment than enjoyment.<br /><br />Here is what I will give this album which it absolutely deserves, 'Grace for Drowning' is very much a bold, daring album with an incredible amount of experimentation. Many, many musicians today would be frightened at the thought of such musical dabbling. For its complete originality this album deserves respect, and Wilson deserves to be recognized as the daring musician he is. With that said I can now say that with all of that praise sometimes it simply doesn't work for everyone, and this includes me.<br /><br />There are tracks that I enjoy and think are quite beautiful. The opener is a marvelous bit of somber and melancholy with a very gentle presentation. I loved that. 'Deform to Form a Star' is also a fairly obvious brilliantly written ballad-like song that is delightful to hear. Bit so mich of the rest of the record, for my own tastes, came off as a bit boring. With all that I said previously about daring musicianship that sounds a bit backwards, but that's how the experience was for me. And then there was the gigantic 'Raider II' which was a musical blessing for so many. What really destroyed this song for me was the strange decission to include a bit of growling. I am not personally a fan of any growling in musoc so that turned me off immediately.<br /><br />The bottom line for me is that this is not a bad record. It's got something for everyone. But for what it's worth coming from a fan, I felt that 'Insurgentes' was the better record up to this point. I can't wait to hear 'The Raven That Refused to Sing' so that I can hear what Wilson has come up with now.<br /><br />So listen to this album and decide for yourself. I really hope you do.
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|Perfect match for my new Olympus E-420 camera, a lot of room for my high quality pictures which is very convenient.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|While some of the words are a bit advanced for her to read, and when the characters interact she can not read fast enough, it gives me some quality time with her to help her read.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|shipped and recieved as advertised.  No thrills here, but the disk did work.  Heck, a firend of mine borrowed them and has yet to return them.
B002MW50KO|5.0|Love Dylan's music.  Young or old, Dylan touches the heart with his music.  I will treasure this CD.  Of course, it came to me in perfect condition.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have had a great time playing this game.  I recommend it to all. I spend too much time with it.
B001USHRCK|5.0|This was a favorite with everyone.  He has his sets displayed so you can go from one setting to another and sometimes combine environments.  All of the sets make up such a variety of environments that kids never seem to tire of moving from one to another.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Watching this Blu-Ray is like standing in the 5th row of the show--great set list and the band still rocks as hard as ever with Jason Bonham.  Well worth to money to upgrade to Blue-Ray.
B000002GXX|4.0|I had all the Eagles albums in LP or tape form but wanted to get them all in CD format
B005D81W5Q|5.0|I find I don't like a lot of Cameron Diaz' movies, but this was actually really funny.  I didn't know much about it, just rented it on a boring weekend, becauase I knew Jason Segal was in it.  Ended up watching it two days in a row and eventually bought it.
B000002GYW|4.0|The song desperado is what turned me on to the Eagles in the early 70's and just wanted to have the album again
0767827902|5.0|Based on a book, this movie features a young Jeff Bridges, Cybil Shepherd (she looks amazing), a heartbreaking performance from Cloris Leachman, and Ellyn Burston (I've never seen her in this type of role).  Nice coming-of-age-in-a-small town story that also touches on the subject of socio-economic class issues.
B000002GYN|4.0|I used to have this on LP and I new it was a good album so I wanted the Cd.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. I can't wait to read the rest of the books that go along with it.
1878424319|4.0|This book is a litlle too new age for my taste but there are many truths there.Worth a re-read to collect them.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Series 1 was awesome and series 2 is no less. As I said in my series 1 review, Downton Abbey gives an interesting look into an element of life in the early 20th century. The story lines are well crafted with well developed characters. Not to be missed!
B008LFY6NI|5.0|I love it because I love to draw. It changes the art it changes the art world. Get this game it's amazing, and I love it.
