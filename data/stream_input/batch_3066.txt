1623650003|5.0|In Paris, a young woman is kidnapped off the street and put into a van. The police know that they have very little time left before she is murdered and ask Camille Verhoeven, a detective to lead the case.  His own wife has been murdered and he has the best chance of capturing the murderer and saving the girl. We see the story from his point of view as well as the victim, named Alex Prevost who is being tortured before death.  One of the clues the detective must solve is who she is, because the killer takes his cue from the victim in how he tortures and kills her.  A book with many twists and turns.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|I have read quite a few YA books, probably more then I'd like to admit. I came upon the divergent trilogy hoping for something different  then the girl falls for her brothers best friends bad guy books I've  been reading.<br />I was immediately hooked. Tris is an amazing female lead (normally they drive me crazy i.e Bella swan)<br />This is not a romance book, there is some romance and it is not overwhelming. I haven't felt this good about a series since Harry Potter graced me with his presence 15 years ago.<br /><br />I give major props to Veronica Roth for what she did with the end of this book, it seems many people don't like  it, but she went with something that I've never seen happen and it was just perfect. I didn't expect  it, and those who say they did are obviously haters.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book if you looking for something different and something fantastic that keeps you on the  edge of your seat.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the Downton Abbey series many reasons: a phenomenal ensemble cast, great writing with many twists and turns, Dame Maggie Smith and her delivery of zingers and comedic timing, just to name a few.<br /> Season 1 the writing was a little dry. Seasons 2 and 3 the series manages to fire on all cylinders. The writing and acting are honed to perfection in seasons 2 and 3. I would highly recommend watching the series Downton Abbey. I like seasons 2 and 3 so much that they are a must have to my video collection. Enjoy.
B00005JOA0|5.0|I really enjoyed this one and the christian aspect! Loved Toby Stephens, wonderful actor! the main character was great to!
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|I can't explain what it was about this book that drew me to it so completely, but it has all the elements that tend to appeal - Slightly quirky, amusing, touching, heart-wrenching...and most importantly a narrator that I wish I knew personally. So often there will be a book with an interesting plot but with a main character I really don't care about, or worse one that is totally unsympathetic. Not so here. This is a must read, and I plan to make sure all my reading friends do so.
B001QW8QYS|5.0|An absolutely first-rate cast.  Could not be better.  Grand scenery, opulant costumes, but more than that:  the underlying peace of the faith of the early Church, even in the face of certain, excrutiating death.  Makes one wonder what we would do in such circumstances.
B00FLNRN06|2.0|Here's a classic case of Hollywood playing it safe and blowing the potential of what could have been a really funny movie. All the leads are talented and there were some funny bits, but the plot surrenders to sentimentality and can't maintain any momentum. I enjoyed Ed Helms as the drug lord, and Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn as the couple in the RV were funny but could have been funnier.  Really all these actors can be funny, they just need to be given something funny to say or do. Also, why do we need to have Jennifer Anniston do a strip club act? Audiences set such a low bar and must be so desperate for entertainment that a movie like this does well enough we're likely to see a sequel like The Millers Meet the Fockers or some such.

B001BMKOZW|4.0|In 2005, System Of A Down, who have long since established themselves as one of the best bands ever to emerge from the Nineties burgeoning nu-metal scene (even though to file them under said genre would be very misleading) more-or-less dissolved. But that in no way should imply that all -- or even any -- of the band members chose to take it easy, and maybe even retire during this hiatus, no matter how indefinite it may be. No, that band's frontman, Serj Tankian, debuted a solo project in 2007, and the rest of the members then chose to get together and form a supergroup by the name of Scars On Broadway a year later.<br /><br />Plenty of the same attributes that made System so great are present on S.O.B.'s self-titled 2008 debut, including Daron Malakian's simple, brutal guitar licks, and faux-British-accented vocals. But this record actually stands on its own in a lot of ways, too, as it fuses-in a much stronger punk influence while at the same time making heavier use of progressive-ish keyboard runs. Furthermore, that band's middle-Easter-flavored leanings and operatic tinges are completely over-run by typical modern-rock song structuring and hooks.<br /><br />The album can essentially be divided into two parts: The raucously hard-rocking metal songs, and the trippy melodic/acoustic ballads. Of the latter subset, it is \\"Funny,\\" with its lightly-plucked guitars, catchy, soaring \\"ooh\\" vocal refrain, and funny, kooky lyricism, the very proggy \\"Insane\\" (which boasts some funky-sounding bass lines), and \\"Babylon,\\" which has an epic vibe surrounding it (thanks mostly due to its epic-sounding keyboard flourishes), that seem to stand out the most.<br /><br />But these ballads are actually included seemingly only to keep the arrangements honest and unpredictable. But the record's heavy, metallic tracks actually trump them. For one example of this, see \\"Serious,\\" which is a hard-driving and propulsive set opener, and a hardcore-punk-inflected metal song that lays big, punk-tinged riffs over Motorhead-style speed punk double bass drumming. And it is probably \\"Cute Machines\\" that is the album's other biggest standout from a heavy point of view. This track sounds like a Queens Of The Stone Age outtake -- at least it would, if not for its inclusion of a few dissonant, throat-tearing screams and tight, technically-impressive drum fills (complete with surprisingly brutal blast beats) near its end.<br /><br />But the highlights do not stop there. \\"Stoner Hate\\" gives off a definite SOAD breeze, what with its \\"B.Y.O.B.\\"-esque off-the-wall zaniness, big riffs, eccentrically humorous vocals, and amusing lyrics; as does \\"Kill Eachother/Live Forever,\\" which definitely deserves to be a hit/lead single (thanks mostly due to its insanely catchy and memorable choruses). That band's influence also comes into play on later tracks, including \\"Chemicals,\\" which marries more of System's deranged sense of humor with a programmed drum beat, industrial-lite keyboard flourishes, weirdly X-rated lyrics, and choruses that are memorable, whether you want them to be or not. And \\"Universe\\" seems like it could be a \\"Mesmerize\\"-era b-side, too, in that it ties together some more of Serj's socially-political subject matter with hooky, \\"wah-wah\\" guitar licks.<br /><br />Other standouts include the excellent vocals and noteworthy lyricism in the super-somber \\"Wh'ring Streets\\"; the clean vocals that soar over the top of Black Sabbath-meets-Motorhead riffing and propulsive drumming in \\"World Long Gone\\"; and the album closer, \\"They Say,\\" which plays like a piece of full-on punk, albeit one that is tinged with another thought-provokingly political vibe.<br /><br />Although I suppose the same could be said for Serj's \\"Elect The Dead,\\" the music put out by Scars On Broadway isn't even close to being up-to par with the works put out by System Of A Down. But even if they ain't exactly System, they are the next best thing. And this auspicious debut makes S.O.B. well on their way to becoming a very good and important band in the nu/punk-metal world.o becoming a very good and important band in the nu/punk-metal world.
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|This is a terrible sci-fi waste of time featuring wooden acting by Will Smith and truly awful acting by his son. Entirely forgettable trash, poorly paced - whose idea was it that it would be interesting to have Will Smith break both his legs and spend the entire movie on the radio or lost in uninteresting flashbacks that add exactly zero context we couldn't guess at already. Some half-way decent special effects, but not really all that impressive even there. Why does it matter that they've crashed on Earth? It could have been Planet AZ-49c for all the plot impact it has. Not a single original plot element that I could detect.
1449305172|5.0|I read Running Lean right after I read Lean Startup by Eric Ries. So I was already on the Lean Startup train, but it was Ash Maurya's book that showed me how to put the principles to work. It's easy to read and very straight-forward. He provides tools and interview scripts for you to put into practice immediately. I was in the process of writing a book proposal and his own process for writing his book outlined in the book encouraged me to get audience feedback immediately by doing lectures first for free, then paid. Copying his process for sure played a part in me getting a book deal too! I started teaching a college class about designing MVPs for online products and made his book the required reading. It was perfect and Ash even provided my class academic access to his Lean Canvas tool. I can not recommend this book more, especially if you want to put Lean Startup principles into practice! Thank you Ash!!!!!

B007IXWL2C|2.0|I was happy with books 1&2, but this final book was disappointing.  What is it about a trilogy?  Couldn't it have wrapped up in just 2 books?  This book dragged, was full of useless emails between Ana and Christian, boring sex scenes...<br /><br />And please stop the mention of Ana's inner goddess and subconscious!  Enough!  It was kind of fun when it was sparsely used in books 1 & 2, but it was unbearable in book 3.  It wasn't cute any more.  Just drop it, ok?<br /><br />It was such a different feeling reading the 3rd book.  I had no problem putting it down after finishing only one chapter to do something else.  I wasn't dying to finish the book.  It wasn't a page turner.
B0009I7NNA|4.0|In 2003, soon after the release of the watershed-worthy \\"Waking The Fallen,\\" California's Avenged Sevenfold essentially blew out their lungs, with frontman M. Shadows (a.k.a. Matt Sanders) wrecking his vocal chords from screaming too much on previous, metalcore-leaning offerings. So A7X did what any long-lasting band worth its salt would do and improvised. And this meant trafficking in some surprisingly tuneful clean singing in place of all of the angsty, agitated screaming of old.<br /><br />As a result, what is produced is  a much more melodic sound with their third full-length release, 2005's \\"City Of Evil,\\" a record that has as much in common with traditional (metallic) hard rock than with any other genre (i.e. thrashy metalcore). And no matter how hard the band riff, here, the intensity level is always held in check by Shadows' harmonic pipes. Hence, \\"Evil\\" first and foremost sounds inspired by Guns `N' Roses, but does also allow some occasional Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Warrant, and Scorpions influences to shine through.<br /><br />The album kicks off in blistering fashion, with the opening \\"Beast And The Harlot\\" abiding by swift and fiery riffing, propulsive bass lines, and deft, forceful double bass thudding. The whole number, too, is iced off by gobs of melodically sweet, soaring vocal hooks, though. Track two, \\"Burn It Down,\\" then, with its crunching guitars, surprisingly deft and impressive drumming, and steady, bubbling bass lines, also plays like a full-on blast of old-school-esque speed metal -- at least it would, if not for gobs more insanely infectious vocal hooks and unforgettably catchy choruses. It doesn't forget to toss in a trademark A7X  solo, too.<br /><br />The record then drops its first couple of really accessible numbers in \\"Blinded  In Chains\\" and \\"Bat Country.\\" The former begins with a surprisingly rapid fire double bass drum intro, and from there segues through a deliciously harmonic, twin-guitar section and sweetly-sung choruses. It also tosses in some vocal stylings that could almost be described as near/pseudo rapping to go along with its chunky, crunching power chords and screaming solos. An excellent bass solo is also included, here, thus helping to further the song's status as being one very epic and intricate number, and one that clocks in at past six and a half minutes in length; but, of course, a gorgeous, spaghetti-western-flavored acoustic guitar breakdown also helps with this fact, as well. And the latter song (\\"Bat Country\\") is an insanely catchy and infectious song -- but hey, it is, after all, \\"Evil\\"'s lead-single, so you most certainly already know just how catchy it is, and likely have had it running through your mind all day on a couple of different occasions.<br /><br />But then Avenged Sevenfold storm back full blast with the surprisingly blistering \\"Trashed And Scattered,\\" which plays like a barrage of ferocious, machine gun-fast riffage. Indeed, the band's two guitarists enact a savage dogfight, here, with each one struggling against the other to get the lead. And the end result is a piece of full-on thrash metal that evokes Metallica's heyday. This track, which showcases A7X at their meanest, is then followed-up by \\"Seize The Day,\\" which showcases them at their most innocent. It is a gorgeous, if ultimately obligatory-sounding acoustic strummer with tasty melodic soloing and a very pleasant and hummable, sing-songy vocal melody that will engrave itself to your brain. It all makes for a very decent tune, even if it is one that isn't really worth more than one listen.<br /><br />\\"Sidwinder\\" is a gorgeous, strings and all interlude that would not sound out of place coming from a Soulfly record, as it is loaded with flamenco-sounding strumming and Priest-y guitar harmonization. But \\"The Wicked End,\\" with its Motorhead-inspired bass intro, really rhythmic, and darn nearly danceable groove, strong hooks, lovely guitar harmonies, and crystalline-sounding keyboard soloing, is an even bigger standout. (It is also noteworthy for featuring an epic, symphonic/orchestral-tinged outro.) And so is \\"Strength Of The World,\\" which finds chunky, booming, and certainly very sizeable guitar chops, catchy, Iron Maiden-ish gallop, and an honest-to-goodness hardcore-derived shout-along refrain offsetting Shadows' warm and heartfelt crooning and infectious, radio-ready vocal hooks really well.<br /><br />Next we have \\"Betrayed,\\" which would otherwise be too clich&eacute; and sappy sounding to be anything but skippable, but is salvaged by its use of a dueling guitar solo section which finds guitarists Synyster Gates and Zacky Vengeance trading off blistering thrash solos. And finally, the set closing \\"M.I.A.\\" builds well, from a minor-key melody to a brutal, rockin' metal part with propulsive riffing and some of the record's most visceral screaming. It is also highlighted by one of the band's all-time finest, and lengthiest and most wailing guitar solos, too.<br /><br />\\"City Of Evil\\" is dragged down by a ridiculously overlong playing time (seventy-three minutes, really?!), and a few too many spots of cheesy crooning and/or sappy guitar textures. But with those things out of the way, nothing else stands in its way of being a very good and even more satisfying record, and one that should appease to you if you hold both hard rock and metalcore in equally-as high regard.en bigger standout.

B000025JJ4|2.0|Let me start by saying that I am a HUGE Deep Purple fan.  I even like \\"Masters And slaves\\" for 5 songs on the CD such as \\"King Of Dreams\\" and \\"Fire In The Basement\\" for their Deep-Rainbow sound.  That said, my opinion is that \\"The Battle Rages On\\" is the worst Deep Purple CD for a few reasons which I will get to.  So the good with the album is that Ritchie Blackmore's playing is fierce and his riffs are probably the most unique to all the Deep Purple records.  The neo-classical acoustic intro to \\"Anya\\" is great and unique for Deep Purple studio albums.  What kills this CD is Ian Gillan's singing.  I love Gillan as a singer, but on this CD he uses only a small portion of his vocal range and sounds like he is whining on ever song.  It is so bad that on portions of every song it almost sounds like the vocal track was not intended for that particular song.  His vocal tracks sound disjointed from the songs.  It is really a shame considering what great music is on the CD, and what a great singer Gillan usually is.  So if you are really in need of some great new music go pick up \\"Perfect Strangers Live\\" or \\"Purpendicular\\" (with Steve Morse).  If you love Ian Gillan as a singer as I do, get Black Sabbath's \\"Born Again\\" album which features Ian Gillan on vocals in the finest vocal performance of his career and fantastic songs that rival the best of the Ozzy or Dio eras.
B003XT60KO|2.0|The title implies that this is a quick read, but it is not at all. Although much of the content is well received and thoughtful, I don't think the book really got to the point and stated it's case in a concise manner at all.
0812982622|2.0|This review goes out to all of you who, like me, slogged guiltily through 100 or more pages of this novel, then even more guiltily quit before finishing.  My clarion cry goes out to you thus: \\"Do Not Feel Guilty, O, Ye, Defenders of Character.\\"  Rare is the successful novel in which character finishes second to landscape (political, historical, geographical, technological, futuristic, etc.).  For me this novel fails to satisfy because political landscape overwhelms character.  It fails the most fundamental question of all fiction: why should I care?  Fifty or so pages in I fully get the point: North Korea is an oppressive, Kafkaesque regime.  But unless I really care about someone living and breathing and moving through that oppressive, Kafkaesque regime, I would rather read something else.  I can get the basic political point from the news.  In my fiction I want to experience living, breathing characters about whom I care.  (FYI, a couple of recent novels dealing wonderfully with characters first and political issues second: Vaddey Ratner's In the Shadow of the Banyan [Khmer Rouge atrocities] and Barbara Kingsolver's Flight Behavior [climate change]).

B009AMAJPA|4.0|Victor (Colin Farrell) is a lonely man. Born in Hungary and now living alone in a New York apartment room, Victor gets acquainted with a French neighbor, a former beautician Beatrice (Noomi Rapace). In the meanwhile, Alphonse Hoyt (Terrence Howard), a merciless crime lord Victor works for, is being threatened by an anonymous murderer who has just killed one of his men and sent his body in a box with a strange message attached to it. In the film you also meet Victor's friend Darcy (Dominic Cooper) investigating the death of Hoyt’s henchman, Albanian gangsters and Victor’s relative Gregor (F. Murray Abraham), who seems to know everything.<br /><br />“Dead Man Down” is a revenge thriller, where getting to know these characters plays out like a mystery. Unfortunately, things are a little too obvious for most viewers, and, moreover, the story sometimes looks too contrived. The international cast put together for the film is impressive, with Isabelle Huppert and Armand Assante, and action set-pieces are reasonable, though there are not many.<br /><br />This is Danish director Niels Arden Oplev’s first Hollywood-made film. He is best known for the original “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo” where Noomi Rapace played the heroine Lisbeth Salander, and like in his Swedish crime thriller, the director attempts for a character-driven crime drama.<br /><br />And “Dead Man Down” is a decent crime drama. The film’s character-based approach is a worthy attempt. I think it works thanks to the fine performances from the leads. Still – I know this is a matter of taste, but – with a little faster pace the film could have been much more engaging.

The twist at the end is one of the best I have seen.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very fun not like temple run no tilting involved at all.<br />Every month the theme changes.<br />Definitely worth the cost.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|I am very satisfied with the product, this is a good nightlight, it is not too bright, and the sensor is very sensitive, thus meaning the light work PERFECT. It is enough light to let you roam around on your way to the bathroom, Hence as mentioned the light stay on for about 8 seconds and switch off, but the slightest movement reactivates the light.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Truly excellent book. So enjoyable it was a quick read - found myself anxious even at points. I definitely recommend this series to everyone.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I loved this book it was so awesome there were so many Calif hangers it was so hard to put down this book my dad called me an examiner reader I read this series in a month and a week
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|Will Smith, Jaden Smith and M Night Shyamalan have gone too far with this vomit inducing Jaded turkey of a Smith vehicle! And how many last chances can M Night Shyamalan get? I mean, saying that this is the mans best film in years means nothing coming from this turkey of a director and Will Smiths son is wooden and his dad looks like he knows it! Embarrassing is not the word to describe this boring, plodding summer blockbuster about the smiths in the unconvincing CGI future with rubbish CGI animals and wooden acting ! Best avoided like bad breath!
B003WQT2YY|1.0|I previously was able to watch this movie I purchased on my Android Samsung Galaxy Note II, but now when I attempt to watch it, the Amazon site says playback is not supported by my device (which use to play this and other Amazon videos).  This change dramatically reduced my value and discourages me from purchasing any Amazon Video On Demand products.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I highly recommend this, I use it all the time, super easy to use, I love it, all different translations, it's just the BEST!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I'm embarrassed to say it, but this is one of my favorite games.  The graphics are good, they release periodic updates to the various scenes/levels, and there's plenty of challenges to keep me busy.  Oh, and my 4 year old son loves it, too!
B0091REZMW|5.0|Fun game. Love hidden object games. I recommend to anyone who enjoys these types of games. Very challenging and easy to level up too.
B003F48E4W|5.0|One of my favorite vampire movies of all time! Sexy, fun, scary, great to look at and good soundtrack. Very '80s!
B00785P2QC|2.0|Need notes and too much Facebook crap, don't want to buy the notes or any thing either.you know what I mean
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I really like this game. I just wish it had a little more instruction. cant get the pipe game to open and have all pieces and plenty of coins. it is very challenging.
B005MLP71Y|5.0|This is a great story that also demonstrates why we desperately need bees and why need to protect them.  My spouse and kids loved the movie, too.
B00F56AZK4|5.0|Great way to pass some free time. This app is only for those who are into jigsaw puzzles.Not complicated, not too easy. Really enjoying the different free puzzles.
B00915G6SU|5.0|The cases are still intriguing after 8 seasons and the &#34;team&#34; is great!  Gubler is the coolest!  Triplehorn works well with the team.
0143124544|5.0|This was the best book I've read in a long time.  I couldn't put it down and was sorry when the story ended...
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Simple to set up and works great with Netflix and YouTube!<br /><br />I like it so much that I have just placed another order with Amazon so I can stream to a 2nd TV in the house.
B005RDF2RG|5.0|If you haven't seen this one, why haven't you?!  My family has watched this one several times now and we still enjoy it.  Great humor for both little and big kids alike.
0316228583|4.0|The character studies are gradual but astute. The interplay of the Pagford politics is perfect depiction of small towns (British or American) with egos blurring purposes.  Probably lost minor subtleties as I'm American.
B00FF8OKJE|5.0|I love this game because it is fun and cool like the computer version but Better because you don't have to type in a email
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|A lot of fun and no kinks. Quicker to move through than Facebook app.  IT. gives you options on how you want to get to other levels.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|My oldest was too young when this came out and, frankly, I really didn't have much interest in seeing it.  Once he was old enough, and with the sequel about to hit the theaters, I thought maybe it was worth a watch.  This is a fantastic movie!  I don't buy many movies, but this was well worth the purchase.
8866135909|3.0|Looks Nice but, the pages are thin so if you use an inky pen you're done for. It's best to use pencil in this, eh, it's meh for the price. Do it or don't, it get's the job done.
B008JFUPOY|3.0|Disney and Pixar have released one of the most anticipated sequels, &#34;Monsters University,&#34; on Blu-ray and DVD. I have only one question after taking it in. How can a follow-up to such a highly regarded movie seem so stale when filmmakers had nearly 12 years to come up with a good storyline? What we get instead is an uninspired family-friendly rehash of &#34;Revenge of the Nerds&#34; and &#34;Revenge of the Nerds 2: Nerds in Paradise.&#34;<br /><br />Ever since childhood, Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) wanted only one thing in life. He wanted to attend Monsters University and become a great Scarer. His dreams are shattered when he meets James P. Sullivan, &#34;Sulley&#34; (John Goodman), and their competitive natures get them kicked out of the college's Scare Program. Now the two must find a way to work together and get themselves back into the running to fulfill their lifelong goals.<br /><br />&#34;Monsters University&#34; might falter in its story, but it excels with a fabulous audio and video presentation. The picture is clean and the color scheme of the film pops out at you. The Dolby TrueHD 7.1 surround sound puts the audience right in the middle of all the onscreen antics and noise you would expect to hear at a Scare School.<br /><br />There are plenty of special features for &#34;Monsters University.&#34; Audio commentary is provided by Director/Co-writer Dan Scanlon, Producer Kori Rae, and Story Supervisor Kelsey Mann. Eleven featurettes explore different aspects of the making of the film. Deleted scenes, art galleries, and promo picks are also included. Pixar's latest short, &#34;Blue Umbrella,&#34; is featured as well.<br /><br />Kids will love &#34;Monsters University&#34; and that's really all that matters. However, their parents might feel as if they're watching a watered-down children's version of &#34;Revenge of the Nerds&#34; or &#34;Animal House&#34; without all the dirty jokes. It's harmless fun for the kids but slightly tiresome for adults.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Fun and relaxing puzzle game. The graphics are a bit cheesy however the gameplay more than makes up for it.
B00622B3MY|3.0|While this is a good movie, it's just not quite as good as the first one.  Still fun to watch - my family enjoyed it - but you may want to set your expectations a little lower.  I mistakenly purchased this movie rather than rent it.  I'm not sure we've watched it a second time so I really regret not renting it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was the first book I've ever read that made me cry,In a good way. The tragedy in the near end was truthful. Of course it was sad, yes, but it showed that love goes on forever. \\"Some infinities are bigger than other indignities.\\" Thank you, Mr. Green, for this one  of a kind treasure that I have so far read 3 times and plan on reading many more. - Jamie K F
B00EVW0SA0|5.0|BEST MOVIE MADE! He is such a talented actor. I look forward to more of his movies int he future.
B00BWYFTNG|5.0|Very happy with the condition I received it in. I was excited to finally get the item and have it sitting on my book case.
B004C3DLJS|4.0|My family enjoyed this movie as we did 1 and 2. To me, it really says a lot that they can get the same actors to do the voices in each of the movies.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Great game but the kindle version stops at level 35 then wants money to advance.  The he'll with that play it on iphone, it unlimited.
B003LPUMHM|3.0|I am staggered by how many people have given this 5 stars.  Firstly yes it is very dramatic, emotional and thought provoking; but how is it proposing to solve these problems? It has no answer except more laws and regulation which will simply put more power into the hands of the private central banks.  Let me repeat that...more power into the hands of a few! What could possibly go wrong there?  If the free market system is allowed to run its course then these banks should be allowed to fail.  I have 1 rule for banks. 100% reserve! That includes the central banks.<br /><br />If the documentary had gone on to expose the central banks fundamentally flawed economic principles I could have given this 4 or maybe 5 stars but instead you have the IMF looking all angelic and the fed left alone which is very odd.  This leaves me very curious about whether this title is nothing more than a diversion with left liberal cover which seems to be the trend these days.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun but needs more levels.  Just got into it and it was over.  Wish there were more.  Over too quickly.<br />The other day, but I have to do. It will be able to do it, but it is. I will not have the same time as the first to
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good game, wish it would have more levels. First few levels are very easy, slowly they got harder, even last level I was able to solve rather quickly. I wish the levels would be a little more challenging.
0307352153|5.0|My book group choose this as a discussion book!  Very good discussion ensued.....great affirmation that introversion IS a valid and needed personality type in our culture!!!
B0063GORYU|4.0|Pretty standard solitaire game. Stable on my Kindle Fire. Nice way to entertain yourself while waiting  and bored. Nothing too fancy  and it plays easily. Ads are a little annoying, but what do you expect for free?
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|Susan Boyle has again delighted  with this wonderfully different Christmas album.  As usual, all naysayers expecting something \\"same old...\\" need to be honest and admit that this artist is just amazing in her handling of a song.<br /><br />O Come, All Ye Faithful with Elvis (via the miracle of technology) has surpassed my hopes.  No wonder this artist was one of so few ever chosen to lend her voice to his.  Sung for the benefit of Save the Children.  The One we come \\"to adore\\" and Elvis as well are surely delighted..<br /><br />The Lord's Prayer - Sung with the feeling and conviction of a true believer.  Special touches add to the feeling that this is far more than a performance of a classic but, instead, truly a prayer.<br /><br />Little Drummer Boy - Love the true voice and arrangement.  The  perfect placement of pipes brought chills and the artist's voice brings you to the stable wanting to bring your gift too.  Susan alwyas seems to \\"give her best\\" to the best messages.<br /><br />I'll Be Home for Christmas - Beautiful !  Made me wish I could be where she is going to be.  Wonderful backing singers remind me of when the best of the best served with famous vocalists.<br /><br />When a Child Is Born - Joining with Johnny Mathis on this song couldn't be a better choice.  Both artists thrill with their ability to use their voices to share heartfelt experiences and convictions.<br /><br />The Christmas Song - A delightful song with a message to accompany the upcoming movie, The Christmas Candle.  Expect numerous and excellent tribute videos of this after the movie is released.<br /><br />I Believe in Father Christmas - This song I had heard little before and am thankful to have Susan Boyle introduce it to me as it no doubt should be sung.<br /><br />Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas - Something about Susan Boyle makes you know she means what she sings.  Made me hopeful that \\"Next year all our troubles will be miles away.\\"<br /><br />Hark! The Herald Angels Sing -Again, great backing choir contributing but not competing with this lovely voice.<br /><br />The Christmas Waltz - A special treat.  By far the best arrangement of this song I have heard.<br /><br />In the Bleak Midwinter - Again...That Voice!  Perfect delivery of this sweet song.  I would  love to use this for a church Christmas program background.<br /><br />Miracle Hymn - Well worth the great anticipation of this original song from the film, The Christmas Candle.  The lyrics deserve careful study and repeated listening...\\"There are Miracles all around...Miracles yet to be found.\\"  No doubt many more hours of listening to this fine Christmas album will bring more good thoughts worthy of Christmas.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|THIS IS A VERY FUN GAME  IT IS VERY ADDICTING. I T IS A  VERY POPULAR GAME EVERYONE I KNOW PLAYS THIS GAME.  ONCE YOU START PLAYING IT YOU DON'T WANT TO QUIT.
0393343405|1.0|The Swerve may have great content. I wouldn't know. The first two chapters are so poorly written I had to re-read them several time. This was a Book Club book and the others had the same experience. So many good books out there I don't want to spend my reading time on ones that aren't well written. The awards are a mystery to me.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I was quite disappointed.  About a third of the way in I was thinking I shouldn't bother finishing it.  I ended up at home sick and cable was out so I finished it, still not worth it.  It's like the book was thrown together at the last minute, none of the new characters are likeable or developed.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The follow up to the story about the little boy who spent a terrifying winter at the Overlook Hotel exceeded my expectations. The Shining being one of my favorite books, I was excited about the prospect of a sequel, but cautious as many of King's books in later years disappoint. Sure, there's some reaches, but I was satisfied. King's characterizations are as good as ever and he is ever respectful of the sacred, or rather haunted ground he created over 30-years ago.
0385737955|4.0|The Maze Runner was a book filled with mystery that kept you reading until you figured it out. The vagueness was just the right amount, and i believe that without it the story would not have been structured the way it is. The vocabulary used painted such vivid pictures and created such strong emotions. Something about waking up in a place where the variable's are stacked against you and you're placed in life or death situations just draws in readers. There were some cliché's in the story which honestly didn't work out for me. The kind of survival instinct was very well planned out but it still seemed cliché; also the whole element of \\"we are being watched\\" was cliché as well. I think that it was very hard to have an emotional connection to many of the characters, i mostly had an emotional connection with characters aside from the main one's. I felt that they were more emotionally developed that the main characters, to me it almost seemed as the main characters were just figure-heads. Overall it was a great novel with it's rises and down-falls.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was my first Gillian Flynn book and i really enjoyed it.  It really really kept my interst.  The detail made this book great and pretty easy to follow.  I loved the mystery of it all and I kept wondering who was going to win the little battle between spouses in the end :o)  Good book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so glad this app made it to Kindle!  I've played it on Facebook and my phone but couldn't find it on Kindle. Now I'm happg
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Lots of fun. My daughter and myself have fun with this game on both of our kindles. Always something new on it.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|With the demise of google reader, this little app fills the gap very well. It takes your Google sign in and does a great job of managing your feeds.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was a good book...well written, unique and kept my interest to the end.  I think the thing i enjoyed the best was the new storyline....meaning it wasn't a repeat of the mainstream book these days.  I enjoyed it.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I thought I was disappointed at the end of the Hunger Games.....and then the Sookie Stackhouse novels.....this is so SO much worse.  You devote hours and hours to a series only to have the ending wish you never bothered to read the series.  I guess I'm one of those people who would rather escape into a book series that leaves you feeling good about life, or at least like there is some kind of justice or resolution.  I am so disappointed.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Have not yet installed it yet. Let the chips fall where they may, I will putt from that point , gladly...
B000065V42|5.0|Great Disney family movie night. Everyone will enjoy the storyline, and the graphics aren't that bad for the age of the movie. You'll grow closer after this movie, and your kids will hug you goodnight.
B00G3KGKNC|5.0|This is the quintensential tribute to Andy. There's so many emotions that flow through this effort from his band members and close friends. The fidelity is premium. Andy would've certainly been proud. Even though these guys have gone to other avenues in music, there will never be another &#34;Andrew Wood&#34;. As this record states, we all miss him . . .
B00BU9DXAY|5.0|You can't help but laugh while reading this.  Must read for anyone who loves a dog and has been loved by one.
B00EB6F1TY|4.0|I got this through Amazon Instant Video.  I really liked the story and how it was more about Tony Stark than Iron Man.  I own the first movie, not the second (I didn't like it as much), and wanted to see this.  It's good.  I would recommend.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|Being a big time trekkie, I remember my fellow fans complain that you never saw Spock go behind the screen, Malcolm of Firefly actually hits the head in one scene. This series breaks a lot of Star Trek rules, and yet, at times, has a touch of Bonanza in it. I love the character history and development found inthis one season. Like many, I now lament that there will be no more.  I like the story behind the name \\"Serenity\\" and I like each and every crew member, and some I even love.  This was a thoughtfully done show that could be lighthearted one moment and yet deadly serious about the true nature of man the next.  Western fans would love this as would Sci-Fy fans. Even plain movie buffs would enjoy the drama and twists found in this show.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love playing bingo here but I have trouble loging in at times or getting booted out by the server. Accessing recently purchased credits is sometimes difficult as well.
B000OCZD5G|5.0|Truly, one of the greatest films ever made, Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior proved how great a young Mel Gibson could be in movies. Forget his personal life and just sit back and enjoy the beginnings of a legendary actor's career. He became a legend for a reason.
B00FEX2ZFG|4.0|I bought this for Halloween movie viewing.  I saw it in the theater with some friends and really was freaked out by it.  I personally think the ending is kind of idiotic, but I love all the scares prior to the ending.  I like that it doesn't really show anything and you have to use your imagination.  The acting was good and there wasn't any gore that I recall.  That's my kind of scary movie!
B000BW7QWW|4.0|I don't know how or why I missed this when it first came out. Sure, by 2004 I had heard of it and brown coats. It is everything Star Trek wasn't, including part Western.  There should be more films for us to sit in the dark munching popcorn that are like this one!
1451666179|5.0|Allie's cartoon about depression is both pithier and more eloquent than anything by David Foster Wallace. I don't know if it's because she more depressed than he was, or just smarter. Her honesty is humbling.<br /><br />Her cartoons are SO great. It's more important just to say that than to say it cleverly. My friends and I were dancing with glee when we found out she had a book coming out.<br /><br />Allie is one of those people who are so funny, and so real, that I would actually rather she was just happy than for her to keep writing (although I would be pretty freaking grateful if she kept writing). And she can draw dogs with a track pad. A TRACK PAD!!
B001KX50BK|5.0|I don't care what people say about the &#34;questionable ethics&#34; in this film, you will never see real screen presence from ANY romantic lead today like we saw from Roberts and Gere in this wonderful, funny and iconic film.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is easy to use, as just a simple calculator. I use a ton and this is by far my favorite calculator I have found on my kindle fire.
B008JFUO72|5.0|I really like this movie because it is full of adventure and action.  It is really cool and interesting movie to watch at home.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves these kind of movies.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I saw the movie then I read the book, it makes you see nature in a different way,<br /> wonderfully beautiful!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Just a cute, funny story. I sat back and read it on a rainy day, with a warm glass of tea.  Had a few good laughs and could imagine a few of my friends ending up in this situation. Recommended for anyone who enjoys a good laugh.
B00FRMCYQ4|4.0|I didn't expect much from this, but it was surprisingly, well, exciting! I usually don't watch a lot of racing, yet Turbo put such an interesting spin on it that I instantly fell in love with the idea and the characters. It's definitely one of those larger-than-life stories that's also very simple and heartwarming. I'm a huge fan of Dreamworks, which is mainly the reason I gave this a shot, and they didn't disappoint. Although it might not be one of their biggest hits, I can see kids falling in love with the characters, especially those who loved Cars and A Bug's Life. It also really reminded me of Shark Tale, so if you loved that movie, you're likely to enjoy this too.
0399165274|5.0|This book is wicked good, I turned off the phone toward the end so I would not be bothered.  Gripping, a great story, well written, the characters come alive before you.  Strongly recommend to anyone who loves this genre.
B0000067L3|5.0|The penultimate album by the penultimate band, in the prime of their career.  No other album even comes close.  Period.
B000VLE3GA|5.0|need i say more very good album they are the stuff<br />i play it everyday and have it on my cloud player
B00CP4RZCU|4.0|If you like Zakk Wylde then you'll enjoy this set. A very talented band that won't disappoint. A live performance with many great songs.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|So far, I've only used it to stream vids from my laptop to the tv, so I'll only comment on that. Setup was super easy; just follow the directions. The hardest part for me was remembering my wifi password.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is as fun as it is frustrating!  Once you start playing, you absolutely can't stop!  The only downfall is the amount of time it takes to earn new lives.  Good luck!
1449305172|5.0|I think Running Lean is a must read for any entrepreneur willing to launch a business succesfully. Clear, hands-on and with very helpful tools.
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|Good book, suspense and love, but too much in French. Will read the next one in the series to see where it goes.
B000JML90Y|5.0|This is a must read book for any aspiring scientist new or old. Gives the reader a vintage and inspiring look at the development of Natural Selection through the eyes of the man who coined it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this is a terrific game. it is also addictive. I can hardly wait for a free moment to play. I also like the fact that you cannot move on unless you have completed the previous level.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Perfect for watching online content on my TV.  I love that it has CEC support and will turn on the TV and change inputs when I cast something from my smartphone or laptop.  I hope to see more functionality and apps added in the future, like for instance the ability to cast the photos or videos on my smartphone to the TV, but given that this device only costs $35 and adds smart features to my otherwise dumb TV it definitely deserves 5 stars.
1449305172|5.0|Very practical business book either for begginner entrepreneurs or pros.  It explains a more efficient and modern way to create a successfull business when short on resources.
B00AFPQF8Q|5.0|The best 3D film I ever seen, one of the best fantasy film made out of book. The way movie ended made me mad, now I really hope to see john carter 2 soon in 4D ;)
B00699XMCO|5.0|This is a good idea to write  books about animals.You should have $999,999,999,999,999,999,999,888,888,888,777,777,777,456.98989895867542825383537368887777!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />That's a lot of money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love this book
B00ERH15WY|4.0|This is a great Christmas album, with straight-up punkish versions of some terrific Christmas carols--and \\"American Jesus\\" to punctuate the album with how they really feel.<br /><br />Unlike the first reviewer, I have no bad associations with Christmas or other religious music. I was very happy as a Christian, and still love much of the music. As Tim Minchin says in [[ASIN:B00AHI77UG White Wine in the Sun]], the lyrics are dodgy, but the music is quite good. Why not enjoy it? I can imagine whipping up some nog, putting this CD on and dancing around the Christmas tree with reckless mosh pit abandon.<br /><br />Happy Birthday, Baby Jesus. Myth though your story certainly is, you inspired some excellent tunes.<br /><br />And gawd bless you, Bad Religion, for stepping out into some truly--for you--fringe territory. And for confusing the hell out of just about everybody with this thing...which is as punk and anarchic a thing to do as I can imagine.<br /><br />It's probably worth noting, in this context, that Irving Berlin, who wrote \\"White Christmas\\" (track 4 on the CD) was a secular Jew, so there is precedent for making great holiday music despite not sharing in the deepest sense of the holiday itself.<br /><br />The music is pretty much what you'd expect as a Bad Religion fan--tight, fast, with great harmonies (it opens with a truly lovely riff on \\"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing!\\" that would not be out of place in a church--until the moment the buzzing guitar and pounding drums kick in).<br /><br />Speaking of drums, one minor disappointment: \\"The Little Drummer Boy\\" could have done with a small drum solo. Nothing epic--BR drummer Brooks Wackerman is a wizard time-keeper at breakneck pace, not Neil Peart--but a few riffs and fills would have felt completely natural on that song, rather than the martial \\"rumpty-tump-tum\\" thing throughout.<br /><br />With that quibble aside, back to praise: this is, for all I can tell, an unironic love letter to the great tunes that the festive season has given us...has given us ALL, including we atheists who like the story, as a story, but don't believe a word of it.<br /><br />Cheers! And if there is no god to \\"bless us everyone,\\" as front man Greg Graffin (and I) actually think, then let us bless each other.
1582701709|5.0|This is a wonderful book for anyone trying to change their life for the better. No gimmicks or program you need to buy into. The author outlines the correct steps in order to do this. It is well written and full of knowledge.
0063120046|5.0|I read it many, many years ago and enjoyed revisiting it.  It brought back memories of my younger years and fantasies.
B004J2TPSI|1.0|Did not work with my Gen 4 iPod, and the charger broke the first time I pulled it out of the unit.  Piece of junk.
B00CNQ7HAU|2.0|I wanted to give the new Grisham book a read after all the hype as ,&#34; his best ever.&#34;. Wow, what a let down.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I just finished completing every level.  I love this game.  Extremely challenging and fun.  A great time passer.  I highly recommend it.
B009GEYX5E|4.0|I got this for a Polaroid my dad recently found after not using it for twenty years - it's still in perfect working order - and the ones that developed turned out beautifully. Two didn't develop, though - not sure if that was just an error on my part, although it was the second and fifth I took, and the others turned out fine, or what.<br />All in all, nice pictures, if a bit pricy, especially coming with two defective pictures.
B00CHVIPP2|5.0|Great movie. Had a family Movie night and this was a total hit. Would highly recommend! My kids wanted to watch it again and again!
1936608898|5.0|It literally changed my life!!!  I've been in chronic pain for nearly 15 years, and since I started this eating plan my pain is gone!!! AMAZING!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Could not put this book down.  Loved how all the characters meshed within the story.  Did not expect the ending, though.
0345529057|5.0|got them for my husband for our 1st anniversary, and he hasnt put them down since. thanks again for the great deals I only buy books from amazon
0439023513|5.0|I enjoyed this book, but overall I have to say that the author could have developed Katniss better. I was always wondering why she never showed anymore emotion than she did. But, this book was well written and tied up all of the loose ends. Even if I hated some of them. You can't please everyone.
B009JCL58G|5.0|Incredible movie, you've got to stay focused-no falling off to sleep here-the movie can be tricky to follow in places but the storyline and characterization is outstanding, not to mention the added special effects. The soundtrack compliments this in a big way, and I feel is one of the better releases for  2013.

1883217040|5.0|Fantastic book. Answered a lot of questions I had. It is better laid out in terms of sequence than the jazz piano book. The sequence oh this book introduces things more smoothly and in an integrated fashion. There is a lot of the same material as the jazz piano book but there is data in the jazz piano book which is not on thus one (more specific to pianists - like data on chord voicings) and there is data in this one on improvisation, repertoire and practise routines they is not in the piano book. When I went through this one several points about scales and modes I had misunderstood finally clicked.<br /><br />The great thing about these books is they don't oversell some &#34;method&#34; of &#34;learning jazz quick&#34; and they also do not over complicate things. The basic information is all there and after that it is just up to you to practice and explore and learn for yourself. Don't expect to read it cover to cover and be able to play jazz. It will be a matter of taking these principles and working on them in practice day after day. But I would say this is one of the best launching pads to take off from in terms of encompassing all the basics of Jazz.<br /><br />For the pianist, I would just buy both of his books and go through them in parallel or go through the chapters on scales and modes from this book first.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Great movie. Had a family Movie night and this was a total hit. Would highly recommend! My kids wanted to watch it again and again!
006202406X|2.0|So, if you're at this point you've probably read through Insurgent. And I mean, what an ending, right? I knew something was up, but that was farther than what I expected. And it was exciting! I couldn't wait for Allegiant to come out, I was checking every day to make sure I had the release date right because I was dying to find out how the city handled their issue. And I probably should've left it there, because Allegiant did a 180 and thoroughly destroyed my anticipation. When you finally learn what the true issue is, it's a stretch. Why the author felt the need to try to take her novel to the next level (when it was heading in a perfectly exciting direction) is beyond me. But okay, I understand wanting to be original and trying to make a dystopian novel that's a little \\"different.\\" I learned to accept the new plot twist and tried to become passionate about it... buy holy moly. I've never been so tired of the word 'damage' in my life. And I'm sure you will, too. Still, that's not enough to warrant a two-star review, because those things are relatively minor. I've read a lot of disappointing reviews giving the book 1 star because of the depressing nature of the ending. After having read the book, I don't really understand what they mean. It's inspiring and there's plenty of closure. Unless accidentally stepping on an ant makes you cry for a week, you'll learn to be fine with the outcome. I promise. The thing that pushed me beyond my limit was the amount of gushy lovey-dovey crud between two of the characters (surely, if you're looking at reviews of Allegiant you know who I mean, but just in case I won't spoil it for those of you who haven't caught up your reading). Is it really necessary to kiss every time you see each other? And not just that, the characters are teenagers. It felt incredibly uncomfortable and disgusting, frankly, to read some of the things going on between them. I know for some people, that's an element that is desired in a book, but it's not thatway for me. It felt like Fifty Shades all over again, but it was so uninteresting and unnecessary. The endless bickering gets old quick, and the steamy makeup sessions get old even quicker. At some points in the book I forget that our protagonist is a teenager, but geez, sometimes her companion really throws a fit like one and it's hard to forget they're so young. I know the book is for young adults, but surely even they're annoyed by the senseless lashing out and emotional instability of some of the characters. It doesn't even make sense when they decide to lose their marbles.<br /><br />I could've handled the plot twist. I could've handled the lack of sentence development and even the nature of the ending. I just can't handle this trilogy, which has been so much about society, to suddenly fall apart in the last book. The characters unravel, and only Tris retains some semblance of normalcy by the end of it. Everyone else sort of falls apart and the story focuses predominantly on a love affair that's, to me, pretty insignificant relative to the other plots in the book. There's not really a good resolution to all the mental abuse I put myself through to finish the trilogy, and for that I'm giving Allegiant a two-star review. I hope that for some of you, these things don't bother you. And I hope that when you finish Allegiant, you don't feel as void of any satisfaction (good or bad, remember that I actually enjoyed the 'depressing' ending) and you find the resolution to be sufficient. It just didn't happen for me.

B00F1CRSKM|5.0|I first had a taste of Arcade Fire when my brother was playing their debut album \\"Funeral\\" in his car.  I had no idea who they were, but I liked their sound.  I finally found out it was Arcade Fire and I immediately bought my own copy.  It turned out that the song \\"Wake Up\\" was also getting commercial exposure in movie trailers and Super Bowl ads during that time too.  The album was a masterpiece as a whole.  I found out that the band was comprised of many musicians and I loved it.  Then I checked out their second album \\"Neon Bible\\" and it was more of the amazing baroque indie sound but much darker.  Though the album is my least favorite of theirs, I still love it to death.  Finally, \\"The Suburbs\\" was released and it was their first number one album.  It was also just as good, if not much better than \\"Funeral\\".  Beautiful music.  It won Album of The Year at the Grammys and I was so happy for them while most people were confused at who they were.  They really deserved the win.  Now, 3 years later they release viral videos and graffiti ads promoting a new album.  Then they released the music video for the lead single and title track of the album \\"Reflektor\\" featuring David Bowie.  It was a different sound, but a very great song.  I think Ive listened to the song at least 10 times a day until they released yet another lyric/music video of the song \\"Afterlife\\".  It was in my opinion even better than \\"Reflektor\\" and the video was just perfect.  I just couldn't wait for the new album.  Well it has finally arrived and I could not be happier.  I thought they wouldn't be able to top their last album, but I think they might have with this epic double disc set.  Here is a track by track review.<br /><br />Disc 1:<br />1. Reflektor:  The beginning tribal drums remind me of The Rolling Stones \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" a bit.  Then the song turns into an indie rock disco track.  Many immediately compared the sound to LCD Soundsystem, who's frontman produced the album.  At first Ididn't think the chorus was great, but then as it was repeated more and more it became so infectious.  The way Regines and Wins vocals intertwine is magical.  Regine also sings some verses in French beautifully.  David Bowie gives a haunting guest vocal.  Favorite lyric is \\"Thought you were praying to the resurrector, turns out it was just a reflektor\\".  Great song to start off this great album with.  10/10<br />2. We Exist: The song immediately starts with a bass similar to \\"Billie Jean\\" with some sexy \\"na na nas\\".  The vocals are so smooth.  This is probably Arcade Fires most groovy song.  It was first played live on Saturday Night Live, but I'm glad I can finally hear the studio version.  3 minutes into the song the synths take over a bit and the vocals become more calm.  The last 2 minutes of the song get even better.  The songs bass will definitely get you moving.  10/10<br />3. Flashbulb Eyes: At first I thought I wasn't going to like the song because of its short length.  But I'm glad I was proven wrong.  This is a groovy trippy song.  The instrumentation of this song is amazing.  I can see this playing at a parade in a forest at night in Haiti.  I wish the song was at least a minute longer though.  It does lead into the next song rather smoothly.  9.5/10<br />4. Here Comes The Night Time: Another song that was played on Saturday Night Live well, but I'm glad to hear the album version finally!  The song starts out quick before slowing down into a groovy dance beat similar to The Killers song \\"Believe Me Natalie\\" just slightly.  The synths really give this an 80s feel at times.  Nearly 2 minutes into the song it turns into a slightly different sound with playful keyboards.  4 and a half minutes into the song things pick up pace in beautiful fashion similar to in Funerals \\"Wake Up\\".  This change in pace makes you feel like youre in the middle of a celebration in Haiti with Arcade Fire at \\"night time\\".  See what I did there?  The last minute of the song is a perfect sing along to end the song with!  10/10<br />5. Normal Person:  This song is like a rocking sister song to \\"Modern Man\\".  This is definitely Arcade Fires most rock n roll sounding song.  There is a perfect guitar riff that permeates the song throughout.  It is destined to become a classic guitar riff that will be covered over and over again!  This is going to be a great concert song to get the crowd hyped.  Regine also has a haunting vocal part during the bridge.  The ending has a really quick fast guitar part that I kind wish was used more!  10/10<br />6. You Already Know: This hand clapper of a song is really feelgood.  This song took me a few listens to get into, but its worth it.  It really gets better with repetition.  The chorus sounds the best toward the end of the song with Regines backing vocals!  Great song about seizing the moment!  9.5/10<br />7. Joan of Arc: The song starts out with a punk rocker spirit.  Then it turns into an anthemic song for the road.  The drums have that \\"We Will Rock You\\" spirit just a bit.  Regine showcases more of her French vocals, but not as good as in the title track, but still good!  The chorus seriously gets better every time I hear it!  This song might become a grower for most though.  There are some nice guitar moments sprinkled throughout the song, especially toward the end.  The song ends abruptly with silence to end the track.  Great way to end dico 1 of this masterpiece. 9.5/10<br /><br />Disc 2:<br />1. Here Comes the Night Time part 2:  The silence from disc 1 leads into this sequel to the previous song of the same title.  This calm electronic song is very relaxing, especially toward its end.  Great calming start to the second disc.  9/10<br />2. Awful Sound (Oh Eurydice): The song starts out with the tribal drums before a sexy Bass starts up.  There is an apocalyptic sound to the beginning, but 2 minutes into the song it starts to sound more uplifting and beautiful.  There is something very emotional about Winsvocals, especially considering the Greek story of Orpheus this and most of the album is inspired by.  3 minutes into the song it gets even more beautiful with added backing vocals from Regine!  This is a very experimental epic and beautiful song.  This will sound great live.  10/10<br />3. Its Never Over (Oh Orpheus):  This song is more dance-y after the heartwrenching previous song.  This might instantly be one of my favorite tracks of all time.  The guitars and dance beat are just infectious!  Regine is more prominent in this song and she does more of her French vocals.  The chants of \\"Hey Orpheus\\" are typical Arcade Fire and remind me of \\"Neighborhood 2\\" just a bit.  There are nice horns in there too!  Near 4 minutes into the song Win and Regine compliment each other vocally so perfectly!  The final minute of the song is very very chill.  Probably the best progressive indie rock song ever.  10/10<br />4. Porno:  This finger snapping song is very synthbased in a great way.  As many of said, this one sounds like it could've been used in the Drive movie soundtrack.  This is a really really sexy song.  The sexiest song from the band.  I mean the title already hinted at that though.  Win gives some of his best vocal performances too.  Honestly this one sounds like it was produced by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails.  That is a compliment!  Great different song for the band.  One of the best as well.  10/10<br />5. Afterlife:  This is my new favorite song from the band.  The dance beat and the U2 Achtung-Baby-esque guitars are amazing and catchy.  The music video works so well too using clips from the classic movie \\"Black Orpheo\\", which I now need to see!  The subject of this song is touchy and very emotional.  The chorus is one of the best from the band.  If I was in charge, this would be the next song of the year at the Grammys!  I don't know what else to say.  Just perfect and timeless.  11/10<br />6. Supersymmetry:  The title sounds like something \\"Muse\\" would do.I had two feelings when I saw the 11 minute length of the song.  I was excited for epicness, and I was also hesitant at having to sit back at a possibly boring track.  I ended up somewhere in the middle of the two feelings.  Luckily, this track is far from boring.  In fact, its one of the more exciting songs from the band.  Very beautiful vocals from both Win and Regine symmetrically.  The song is very relaxing at the start with some 80s synths.  The U2 inspired sound is also present.  3 minutes into the track it starts to pick up the beat and get more anthemic and gorgeous!  The vocals also come to a halt turning the song into an instrumental the rest of the way.  At first this might sound off putting considering the length of the song, but I promise you this is one of the best.  Halfway in it seems to fade out, before slowly fading back in again.  It takes a while but the song ends with the last 4 minutes or so being a spacey sound.  It is said this is a hidden track, but I don't hear a real track.  I just hear ambient spacey noises.  I honestly wish they wouldn't have wasted all that time, but some will think its really artistic while many will call it annoying and pretentious to end the album this way.  I think the first 5 minutes make up for the last part of the song.  I do think if there were a movie based on the album that the spacey ending would fit well, but not for casual listeners.  10/10 strictly for the first part of the song.<br /><br />So I may sound biased since I gave most of the songs on the album a perfect score, but I'm confident that this is one of the best albums released in the past 10 years.  Some are saying this is Arcade Fires \\"OK Computer\\"/\\"Kid A\\".  I somewhat agree.  I might get a lot of disagreements for what I'm about to say, but I think this was much better than both of those Radiohead albums that seem to be brought up whenever an artist experiments nowadays.  This is Arcade Fires \\"REFLEKTOR\\".  This album has so many textures and layers that one will discover with each repeated listen.  I already keep discovering new things in the songs I didn't hear before.  As many have stated, the album does have a more dance-y feel to it.  It works really well though.  If there was any doubt that Arcade could surpass their \\"Suburbs\\" or \\"Funeral\\" album, this is the answer.  This album is almost too good.  This really is epic.  At over 70 minutes long, you really have to get settled in to really enjoy the album, but its worth it.  I won't be surprised if this album sweeps the next Grammy award season.  This will be analyzed by critics for years as one of the milestone albums of the 2010s decade of music.  Do yourself a favor and get this album if you like good music.<br /><br />P.S.  For those of you who didn't know, there is a hidden track in the beginning of the album.  Rewind past the beginning of track 1 and you will be treated to a 10 minute treat that I'm sure many of you will enjoy.

Honestly, more excited for the movie than I am for the remaining four books, which will probably go unread.  However, if this is your genre, you'll probably love this one.

A+ for casual LGBT+ representation, both in \\"Allegiant\\" and \\"Insurgent\\" but wow did this book make me CRY. I cried from The Big Thing through the end, then for another 20 minutes after that. I'm crying right now. Everything hurts.

B00005MNP7|5.0|This was a great band that were around before I was born. And it's a good thing that their music still holds up 30+ years later. This album, \\"Eat to the Beat\\" tends to get lost in the shuffle since it's stuck in between their breakthrough album, \\"Parallel Lines\\" and the avant-garde \\"Autoamerican\\". And I find that really sad because I think \\"Eat to the Beat\\" is a flawless album from to start to finish. No filler here, I promise. What makes this album so special is the variety. You get a little bit of everything: their signature new wave cuts, sassy, sweaty punk, glossy but sophisticated pop, their first stab at reggae, and even a sweet, gentle lullaby. \\"Atomic\\", \\"Accidents Never Happen\\", and \\"The Hardest Part\\" round up the new wave juggernauts. \\"Atomic\\" has always been one of my favorite Blondie songs. I like the strong undertone of electronica running through the beat and there's great drumming from Clem Burke. \\"Accidents Never Happen\\" is a song I have soft spot for because I like keyboardist Jimmy Destri's songwriting and catchy melodies. \\"The Hardest Part\\" is just pure fun, love the raw edginess. As for the punk songs, I think these songs are quite brilliant. \\"Living in the Real World\\" is full of cynism and the title track is hyper and I love the harmonica playing throughout the song. And just to clarify something, when Blondie was first starting out, they were a punk band before they ventured in to new wave terrain. But if you want to know the song that I think is the BEST track here is the punk gem, \\"Victor\\". Oh my god, this song is insane! Debbie Harry's scream is out-of-this world good, actually it's scary how good it is. I can't stop listening to \\"Victor\\" - (love the guitar riff and endless chord changes) you can feel Debbie's anguish and desperation when she belts, \\"I don't want you to go, please don't leave me alone!\\" And now we dive into the pop gems. I think these next 4 tracks I will discuss are the highlights here. They are beautiful, complicated, and heartbreaking. The opening track \\"Dreaming\\" is so romantic and well...dreamy. I adore this song and the lyric: \\"You asked me what's my pleasure, a movie or a measure? I'll have a cup of tea and tell you all my dreaming, dreaming is free...\\" There's another Jimmy Destri penned track called \\"Slow Motion\\" which sounds like a 1960's girl group Phil Spector-inspired song. It's bouncy, breezy, and the hook is irresistible. The \\"meat and potatoes\\" part of the album includes \\"Union City Blue\\" which packs a hard-hitting emotional punch to the gut and \\"Shayla\\" written by Chris Stein. \\"Shayla\\" could be Blondie's most underrated song. Just thinking about the lyrical content makes me want to weep. It's about a lonely, hard-working girl who feels hopeless and isolated: \\"Years of fear were in her way, lost in space and down she came...\\" \\"Shayla\\" in my opinion contains Debbie's best vocal. But to be honest, this whole album proved Debbie could sing her butt off. Her voice was rich and her personality was so fiery, how can you not love her? And it didn't hurt that she was so photogenic (that girl had killer bone structure). Debbie was also a great songwriter as well, on this album she co-wrote 8 out of the 12 tracks. So not only was she drop-dead gorgeous, she also had a brain too. But back to the songs! \\"Die Young Stay Pretty\\" has Blondie experimenting with reggae and Debbie encourages us \\"to live fast, 'cause it won't last...\\" \\"Sound-A-Sleep\\" is an unexpected, angelic lullaby that will surely cure anyone suffering from insomnia. I also wanted to mention there are 4 bonus tracks (ALL live versions) which in include: \\"Die Young Stay Pretty\\", and the rest are covers. The first cover is the Four Tops' \\"Seven Rooms of Gloom\\", David Bowie's \\"Heroes\\", and Johnny Cash's \\"Ring of Fire\\". As you can tell, I love \\"Eat to the Beat\\". This album is digitally remastered. The sound quality is awesome, and there's a short essay written by producer Mike Chapman which gives the listener some helpful insight about the making-of this album from back in the day. I highly recommend this album. You won't regret it. Enjoy!nsight about the making-of this album from back in the day. I highly recommend this album. You won't regret it. Enjoy!

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Warning:  Only play if you have lots of time...super addicting and lots of fun!  Graphics are good and music is inspirational!
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I was surprised to hear songs I'd heard on the radio but didn't know that Kelly was the artist.  Nearly every song is great.
B00EQ25DMI|3.0|I'm an avid ABBA collector and have bought all the special editions to date and this one I'm sad to admit is a pretty poor effort on Polar's part and really appears to be solely a money grab. It really does ABBA no justice. Some of the other special edition CD/DVD's have ranked from superb to average and it begs the question why Polar gave so much tender, loving care to some but not all? The production values in some were outstanding and the DVD's featured alot of content, in some cases over an hour, but this Ring Ring \\"special\\" edition gives you only 14 minutes with 4 videos. I repeat that, only 14 minutes and one of the videos is a Ring Ring version that has an Agnetha \\"stand-in\\"! I couldn't believe it. They explain that Agnetha was very pregnant at the time and ABBA was under pressure to release a video for the album of their best song and that most people had never seen Agnetha and wouldn't know the difference. That may well be true given it was ABBA's first album and they were relatively unknown but of all the other Ring Ring videos out there that include Agnetha why did they have to pick this one? I suppose being a seldom seen video makes it a collectors item and I wouldn't mind if it was one of many videos included on the DVD but when there are only 4 videos (one being a sleeve gallery only) its unacceptable. The other videos are People Need Love that Agnetha is actually in and a video of Benny explaining the Ring Ring songs sound and how it came about. Thats it folks. The CD itself of the album also disappointed but I must have gotten a bad copy. The sound was overly saturated with bass and impossible to listen to at a normal volume without massive distortion. I got a replacement copy and that seemed to fix things and confirm I had a defective one. Anyway, it was ABBA's first album and outside Ring Ring most other songs will be obscure to most unless they are ABBA fans. I must say I enjoyed it quite a bit though. I didn't realize this album was never released in the states. I looked at my vinyl album collection and sure enough its true as it wasn't among my ABBA ones so this was the first time I had ever heard the album so this was a treat. I think it is quite good overall. Some songs were poor but most were not. The album was like a mix of '50's and '60's type songs blended with the early '70's. This CD by far has the most songs of all the other special editions but most are different versions of Ring Ring in other languages and then there are several Swedish songs that were not ABBA songs but are somewhat fun to listen to just to hear them sing in their native language. I can't imagine most people will listen to them more than once. All in all I was disappointed in this collectors special edition but mostly because of the poor and limited DVD content. As stated before its hard to understand why all the special editions vary so wildly on their quality. One has to hope when the 40th anniversary of Waterloo in 2014 is made into a special edition, likely in time for the anniversary, they give it the due it deserves since Waterloo cemented their future stardom. I suspect it will be the best special edition they make and I feel pretty confident but given how up and down the special editions have been who knows?
B005LAJ22Q|3.0|This one was better only had a glitches here and there not like the first season an the third season rip off
B00821OX98|5.0|It starts off a bit slow but only because they are trying to build a larger story.  After sticking through the first few episodes, I was happy to see this series moves at a reasonable clip.  I love the world they set up as I can see many of the events actually happening.  Overall, special effects are OK but the story and characters are interesting.  There are a few annoying moments/characters, as in all series, but the story as a whole makesn it worth it.
B00FH3Z91A|2.0|Good design but I was expecting better quality from a $40 case. Purchased a $9 case  for my Note 3 and the quality was better than this one.<br /><br />The $9 case -  [[ASIN:B00EXIWSLE B00EXIWSLE]]
B000W9399S|3.0|The Color of Magic is the story of an incompetent, cowardly and cranky wizard and his sunny and strangely lucky companion. So wildly improbable it is impossible to suspend your disbelief, which I suppose brings you in on the joke. In my opinion, it would have worked better as a short story. Once you get it, it just becomes silly and a bit tedious. I won't be reading any more Discworld books.
B0049P1VHS|1.0|Burnt pirated copy that had glitches on every single episode not happy won't buy from amazine again seeing season three is even worse brand new my arse poor infuriar copies more like it
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book was beautifully written.  I thoroughly enjoyed both the story and the writing style.  I borrowed it from an online library, but liked it so well I will purchase so that I can reread it again, and I don't reread many books.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you Kindle for getting this free game.  I really enjoy it and played it on my iPhone, but now I Can play it on my kindle.  Great game, hours of fun for all ages
8866135879|5.0|Despite years of trying to use digital calendars, I found that I really missed having a paper calendar. This one is compact and has an elastic band to keep it shut. It fits even in my small purses and is unobtrusive but still has ample space to write basic info about appointments, calls, numbers I'll need for those conference calls, etc. There are 8 lines for every day, so there's ample room for multiple events/reminders/needed pieces of info per day. There's a notebook that slides in the back and a pocket, both handy for keeping up with little bits of information until I can transfer them later. It's making my life much easier!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great insight to the world of a sniper. Loved hearing about the actual battle scenes. Would have liked to hear more traininig stories, but 5 of 5!
B00AFROVQC|2.0|The story in and of itself is a good one, but the writing and characters are all over the place. I found this book very repetitive. The same phrases were used over and over again, and I don't care for that. I'm fine with reemphasizing a point, but there were simple words or phrases that I felt were overused. The characters, especially Thor, are inconsistent. One minute he's strong-willed and the next he's unsure of himself. I felt like every emotion he experienced was just over the top and not believable. And there were other characters who had the same problem. I didn't give it one star because I liked the world the author created. It was unique and different. But everything else was just a mess for me.
B00ELOOYZI|4.0|It is a good game-- harder than it looks. The only flaw that I can see is that the game tells me I am using an outdated version, and need to update to the most current one. Yet, Amazon shows no updates for it. Still...<br /><br />This is a challenging little game.
B003U4UNPK|5.0|I was one of the very few people in the country that NEVER saw even 1 episode of LOST when it was on Prime-time.  I would see the advertisements and nothing on those ads appealed to me.  Well one day I was on Amazon Prime searching for something to  watch and as I scrolled past the icon for Lost I saw JJ Abrams name and since I have loved most everything he's been involved with I thought I should maybe check out Lost.  I thought what the heck, I'll spend a few minutes looking at the 1st episode, can't hurt and I can just turn it off if it's boring.  Well - less than 10 minutes into the 1st episode I was hooked and I watched the entire series and was very sad when I'd watched the last one because  there was no more.  BUT I am very glad I never got hooked on it when it was on TV because I would have hated having to wait each week to view the next episode and the summer breaks would of been awful.  So if you are like I was and never saw the show and you love story lines with twist and turns you'll like this.
B009X01C64|5.0|Cases are hard to find for HD 8.9 but this one is a winner.  The case is easy to use, turns easily from landscape to portrait, and turn it again to charge it while the case is closed.  Very nice quality leather.  I would recommend this product without hesitation.
0767919408|5.0|I've not yet finished this book, but already I can hear Mr. Bryson's storytelling voice wrap me like a warm blanket as he sets up the summer of 1927 with stories from across the globe.  There is nothing he does not touch upon--aviation, scandal, murder, etc! I only have enough time to read it before I go to sleep at night, but it is such a great part of my day!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I was thrilled to hear this book was coming out. A Time to Kill is one of my all time favourites and now I have two. Keep writing Mr. Horsham!!
1567184855|4.0|Whether the stories recounted about people who have under hypnosis traveled to other lives are true or not, there is a comforting sense that life is meaningful and that death is a part of a cosmic plan in which individuals grow and learn.
1476727651|5.0|I listened to the audio version of this book, and ran the battery down on my iPod several times because I couldn't stop listening. This is King at his storytelling best, as he weaves the continuing story of Danny Torrance into a seemingly new story that eventually picks up many of the threads of \\"The Shining.\\" King is a more mature writer these days, and this book is richer and deeper for it. The references to AA ring true and show that sometimes the experiences of real life can be more horrific than any supernatural ghost story. But there is plenty of the supernatural here - from Abra Stone- a young girl with the Shining to Rose the Hat, the leader of a murderous band of seemingly innocent RV enthusiasts. The secret to their longevity and their wealth is the fact that they must survive on the horrendous pain, suffering and death of children who possess the Shining. We encounter this group, the \\"True Knot\\" at the scene of tragedies, such as 9-11, as they breathe in the \\"steam\\" generated by death and suffering. But their main nourishment is children - children like Danny Torrance was, and Abra Stone is.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Love this game. It has cool graphics and the best working and realistic weapon action i have been able to find.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I have always loved the movie so I decided to try the book. I'm really glad I did. It's a great story and develops the characters much more than the movie does.
0375869026|4.0|My 10-year-old granddaughter LOVES this book and re-reads it. I also liked it, although not so much as she. It presents quite a realistic view of middle-schoolers, some kind and compassionate, some unsympathetic and insensitive, as well as a group of adults who vary in their ability to adjust their thinking and tolerate the unconventional. What does it take to change the mind-set of a group of fifth-grade kids? The answer is interesting. The story is told from several points of view, which makes it a bit more sophisticated than most middle-school novels. I found the ending a bit over the top, but that's probably just my innate  conservatism coming out. Overall, though, the book was not sentimental or manipulative, and it offers a good lesson in acceptance and human values.
B008JFUNNM|3.0|This is a heartwarming tale of a Somali pirate who finally realizes his dream of coming to America.<br /><br />Throughout the movie he says to himself, if he is strong and believes in himself (paraphrase), everything will turn out right. And it does. Kind of.<br /><br />OK. Seriously, though. First, be aware that this film may be a whitewash of the real Captain Phillips; his crew says they in fact warned him repeatedly about entering pirated waters, but he ignored them. And so on. I don't know whom to believe, but just FYI.<br /><br />Second, the good Captain does things which don't make sense. He ignores the warning of his crew that the first encounter will be followed-up, and they should haul, er, butt. He says if they do, they'll run into other pirates anyway. This decision allows the pirates to catch up. Then, after telling the crew to hide and under no circumstances be captured to be held hostage, he stays on the bridge and ... is held hostage.<br /><br />Third, he is constantly saying things to his captors which would probably irritate them rather than calm them down. Look for these nuggets. I cringed each time.<br /><br />Otherwise, this film is suspenseful, not exactly action-packed, but thrilling nevertheless. This is due in no small part to the actors who play the wild-eyed pirates, looking scary as all get-out. You see how they're recruited into a ruthless, greedy pirate ring, constantly demanding and yelling and threatening. You feel a bit sorry for them.<br /><br />They say they're forced into this life because of big fishing boats which get all their fish. I don't know if this is true or not. But they apparently use this as their excuse for violence and theft.<br /><br />You get to see how comedically useless the \\"non-lethal\\" defenses of a big ship are against pirates - they blithely weave in between water jets and shoot open pirate cages.<br /><br />And we sympathize with the crew, who complain that they are unarmed against dangerous thugs. We can pontificate all day about how un-nice it is to have armed security on ships, but I guarantee the day you spot a skiff of armed criminals on course with your ship, you'll be wishing you had a bazooka - certainly after watching this team of khat-addled goons.<br /><br />You'll see the full force of the US Navy swing into action to rescue this one man. And you'll make no mistake - these are the good guys. And consummate professionals, carrying out what seems a convoluted plan (what's that with making big wakes, stopping the tow, etc.?).<br /><br />There is more waiting than I had expected. There is Jason Bourne Jerky-Cam in the lifeboat, which might make you seasick. Nothing actually happens a lot of the time there, just some threatening and panicking. The Captain's interactions with the pirates there seem somewhat random and without any real plan, except to apparently antagonize them more.<br /><br />There is a semi-happy ending, as the pirate team lead, Muse, makes his way to the United States.<br /><br />I enjoyed it, but it's not a five-star movie to me. This is partly due to all the hype around it as an action-packed thriller. Maybe 3.5?tificate all day about how un-nice it is to have armed security on ships, but I guarantee the day you spot a skiff of armed criminals on course with your ship, you'll be wishing you had a bazooka - certainly after watching this team of khat-addled goons.<br /><br />You'll see the full force of the US Navy swing into action to rescue this one man.

B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|Once again, Dave Eggers makes an almost fantastical story, and delivers a believable, mind-bending, scorching application to modern day issues.  Profound in ways that make one question their own seemingly meanless responses and actions.  If I could &#34;zing&#34; it, I would.
0670024856|2.0|I enjoyed Eat, Pray, Love, and I loved the sound of a book about a 19th century female botanist - it seemed to me that with Gilbert's writing and that subject matter, the book couldn't go wrong. Unfortunately, I'm putting it down half-way through.  It reads as if the author began writing with no plan whatsoever for the book, and then just made things up as she went along, with no particular logic or unifying trope. The book is almost picaresque.  Every time the plot really gets bogged down, which is pretty often, a new unbelievable character is thrown in to try and save it.  Although things do happen in the book, it feels like nothing happens; kind of the opposite of Eat, Pray, Love, in which really not much was happening, but it felt like a lot was. Despite a subject that seems like it could give rise to insightful, quirky, mind-tickling riffs, the book is heavy-handed, at times a bit precious, and simply dull.  I'm happy that a lot of people seem to enjoy this book, but sadly I'm not one of them.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The Husband's Secret by Liane Moriarty is a well written story.  Only problem I have with her writing is the use of fowl language.  Adds nothing to the story, just keeps me from fully enjoying the book.  For someone who can weave a story as well as she does, she doesn't need dirty words!
1612680003|5.0|I gave it 5 stars. The physical shape of the book was perfect. unused and undamaged. Thanks a lot for the quality product. As for the info! Best book on the market for getting started on your financial education ventures!

1603425381|5.0|This is another very nicely written book!  And, I highly recommend this and any book written by Edie Eckman!  Ms. Eckman's books make a nice addition to my collection of crochet books!
B008Y1RTUG|4.0|Good Dialogue between most Characters, with the exception of snow white (Stewart)who's acting ability is suspect anyway as far as I am concerned. Stunning special effects with excellent character acting.
B00ET820FC|4.0|Paddy McAloon is back.  Like Prefab Sprout's last release - 2009's Let's Change the World with Music - Crimson/Red is written and performed entirely by Paddy (sorry, no Wendy this time around).  In fact, the overall sound and feel of this album is very similar to that of Let's Change the World with Music, although the keyboards that dominated LCTWWM have been replaced with acoustic and electric guitars, and the keyboards take a supporting role here.<br /><br />The opening track \\"The Best Jewel Thief in the World\\" is a winner, but the lush production on this relatively uptempo song is largely absent from the rest of the album, which is generally more spare and subdued.  The lyrics can be a bit over-sentimental at times (\\"Grief Built the Taj Mahal\\"), but this has been par for the course with Paddy in recent outings, and there is a stronger sense of wistfulness running through the songs.  Paddy revisits some of his favorite themes, especially the power of love and music.  The songs have the intricacy, complexity and craftsmanship that you would expect from him, and the showtune-like feel lends them a timeless quality.<br /><br />After several listens, my personal favorites are the above-mentioned opener, \\"Adolescence\\" (an odd paean to youthful passion somewhat similar in style to \\"Meet the New Mozart\\"), \\"Billy\\" (a jaunty song about love, music, and...trumpets) and \\"The Old Magician\\" (a sentimental and melancholic look at an over-the-hill magician - self-referential, perhaps?).  \\"Devil Came A Calling\\" is a folky take on the old story of the Devil offering Paddy wealth and women in exchange for his soul, but while it is pleasant enough it doesn't really break any kind of new ground lyrically or musically.  I think the second half loses momentum a bit, but any criticisms I have are minor.  I am more than satisfied with Crimson/Red as an album.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you liked Let's Change the World with Music, you will probably enjoy this latest offering from Prefab Sprout.  Even if you were hoping for another Steve McQueen or Jordan: The Comeback, I don't think you'll be disappointed.  Crimson/Red is a solid and enjoyable effort, and it is head and shoulders above the majority of what passes for songwriting today.<br /><br />Track Listing:<br />1.  The Best Jewel Thief in the World<br />2.  List of Impossible Things<br />3.  Adolescence<br />4.  Grief Built the Taj Mahal<br />5.  Devil Came A Calling<br />6.  Billy<br />7.  The Dreamer<br />8.  The Songs of Danny Galway<br />9.  The Old Magician<br />10. Mysterious<br /><br />The disc comes packaged in a jewel case, but the liner notes do not include the lyrics, which was a disappointment.<br /><br />By the way, I ordered my copy from cdjapan for about $26 with shipping  and I got it last week.

B000002J1Y|5.0|This has been bought by me numerous times. I had a copy on vinyl in 1973 when it first came out and it still sounds fresh even today. This was like an introduction to Yes and it basically is a live album of their best stuff at this time. The song selection is great  There's not a dull moment or a lull in the performances. They still sometimes use the Firebird Suite excerpt at the beginning of concerts. Many of the songs differ slightly form the studio versions mostly with extended portions. The best thing for me however was that of all the compilations of Yes this one has the best song selection and performances are unmatched anywhere. This a great perspective and retrospective of an influential band and it's flawless from start to finish.

This is by far the best book I've read about how to start a company. &#34;Running Lean&#34; is as close as you will get to a &#34;follow the directions&#34; book about the mechanics and thought process for starting a company. This book breaks down lean startup methodologies into actionable steps.

B00B5NXBZ2|5.0|I really was surprised when when I walked into a couple music stores and asked for this album, only to get the response &#34;who?&#34; or &#34;woodkid? is that the album name?&#34;. I consider myself to be an amateur audiophile (more like i just like good quality stuff). So here is my review from the point of a musician and a music enthusiast.<br /><br />Musically, its amazing! It's mastered so that there's good dynamic range in each song, and no single instrument overpowers another. It's all very well balanced. The quality of the recordings is just incredible! It's so raw, with very little effects added, it's just pure performance and if you have a good ear and good speakers (or headphones) you can hear those small details that make you feel that this was a live studio recording.<br /><br />I do agree with other reviewers that say the music has an &#34;epic&#34; quality to it. It's very grand, with full orchestra (dat brass section) and powerful drums accompanying most tracks. His work as a video producer serve Yoann Lemoine well for music direction. As with the music videos he's produced, he is able to give a feeling of space into his music. One moment it sounds like a small room, with piano and vocals, then slowly the room opens up as various instruments warm up the space, as can be heard in the first track in the album &#34;The Golden Age&#34;.<br /><br />Conclusion: This is a great first album from an aspiring musician/artist. If you like one track from this album, chances are you'll like the rest of it as well. I look forward to seeing more work from Yoann Lemoine.<br /><br />Listened to with ATH-M50 and Superlux HD668B headphones.
B00BPDR3F6|2.0|I liked that it kept me wanting to<br />Get to the ending, however I was overall disappointed with the ending and with some of the middle. I wouldn't read it again. It was ok.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Wow. What a voice. Love to play this CD loud alone in the car. Can't wait for another new CD from her.

B005ETANC2|5.0|This is a must have classic movie for real horror buffs.I have seen this movie on TV and now have my on copy.  Quality of movie was perfect.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Wish it had more adventure levels.  Ive played the entire game twice. They need to come out with number 2 already.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so happy this app is available on my kindle. I was tired of watching people playing this game on their iPad and I couldn't get it on my kindle.
B005LL7C68|5.0|I never fail to take this album with me when visiting family on the shores of Lake Superior. I usually put it on just as I hit Hwy 17, the music mirroring the Canadian landscape as we approach those legendary shores. There are some wonderful themes here, and while they may outstay their welcome a little (the condensed live version on Exposed may be more immediately appealing), they are never less than engrossing, with Maddy Prior's contribution an inspired choice. Is it his best? Probably not (I listen to Five Miles Out and Crises more), but there is no better album of Mike's at evoking what it was meant to.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000000I0F Exposed]]<br />[[ASIN:B0050ASD36 Mike Oldfield / Crises]]
B007SGM084|5.0|I couldn't put it down! Great love story! I didn't want it to end. I want MORE. This is definitely a must read.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I wanted a simple but visually pleasing solitaire and thiis fits the bill. There are too many ads but they are easily dismissed. It is a keeper for me.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|I enjoy playing it occasionally. It is fun, nice graphics. Thanks for providing this game at no charge. You guys are OK!
B002RI9VVM|5.0|Some people probably steer clear of the so called 'classic' books for a number of reasons. Probably a good portion of those reasons being the memories of High School English. If you read no other book from this category, I would strongly recommend you read this one. The characters are human and very detailed. The descriptions of the California dust bowl are vivid. The book is a novella and easy to get through without too much commitment. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Wonderful series! This was the best book in the Divergent Trilogy, but be prepared to cry your eyes out. Wonderful love story and tales of true friendship.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works good. Great for when I travel. Must have for travelers. Easy to set up and use. Hulu is a nice addition. Can't wait for Amazon video
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really like this app and use it on a daily basis.  It is great to know how to dress and prepare for the coming days,
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Wow, I am touched by this heart wrenching tale. It seemed to break and mend my heart all at once, throughout it's entirety.
1780540655|5.0|Recommended to fans of MJ! I like it because it's MJ ! Nice pics! That's why I bought it !
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Finally here! Awaiting pet rescue now, please please. I so enjoy playing games on my kindle fire HD. Hoping it will be soon.
1449305172|4.0|A good distillation of the lean start-up theory.  I referred back to it often when I was performing customer interviews and mvp demos.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Started easy then it got a little hard but I like the game handsome does the people I reffer to this game
B003PBB4ME|5.0|There's no problem at all. The only thing I don't like about this is that I use a battery grip for my camera and would love to keep that on when using this product. Overall it's a great product. No complaints.
B005PW3OS8|4.0|I like the whole avengers franchise.  Really enjoyed ironman and this has been as much fun, but different.  Well done Marvel.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|After anticipating this book for a year, this end of the divergent series is a little disappointing and not only because of the unfortunate ending. It is told in two perspectives but they are indistinguishable. I found myself having to check the top of the paragraph to remind me whose perspective the chapter I was reading was told from on more than one occasion. Also, the plot was a little weak and riddled with holes.
B0034G4P80|5.0|Our whole family really enjoys this movie and it is safe to view for all ages. Good story, good quality acting and cinematography as well as clean.
B00C7607BC|5.0|Loved it when it first came out and was so excited to share it with the kids. Disney quality as always.
B000O599WG|5.0|This was bought as a gift. It came super fast and the person I bought if for absolutely loved it!! Great classic movie, and the double disk special features make it even better!
B002ZG99TA|4.0|Though some things about this movie seemed a bit far fetched, and the fact that it is based more on the thought that this really did occur, but in a different locale....the acting was still good and it was worth our time to watch it.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|This book is the shit. So is Allie Brosh. So are both simple and helper dogs. Do yourself a favor and buy it. If you don't I'll throw up on you.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this is a fun game.  simple concept but challenging and very entertaining. I would recommend this to anyone.  Hours of fun
B001PB3RU8|5.0|I am a huge Florence and the Machine fan so I had to purchase this CD and I don't regret it at all would recommend to anyone
1451666179|5.0|I got the book this morning, and as I was hobbled by pain from an ACL surgery and unable to take painkillers because they would make me loopy at work, instead I read this all day. (Shhhhh. It is okay. I also helped customers.)<br /><br />There are a million things I love about this book, but I can start with the fact that each chapter is printed on different-colored pages than the ones on either side of it, which makes the book look like a rainbow when it is closed. A RAINBOW, GUYS.<br /><br />The Depression chapters (previously published on her blog) are revelations to those who have experienced depression and touchstones of understanding for those who have not. The Dog chapters are hilarious to both dog-lovers and cat-lovers (AKA dog haters). The chapters that peek into her childhood make me wish I remembered anything about my life before I was twelve. But you know what? I'm going to take a page from this book, and just imagine that my childhood was just as fantastical, wild, revelatory, unintentionally hilarious, and unique.<br /><br />Yes, there are a few chapters that are repeats from the blog. Sadly, the fish incident did not make it... that one is still my favorite. But the ones that did make it are definitely worth the re-read. Also, the majority of the book is new material, including some introspective chapters (&#34;Thoughts and Feelings&#34; and the two-part &#34;Identity&#34; chapters). Those, to me, were the best ones of the whole book. I love that the author is so freaking honest (can you swear on Amazon? Imma go with no) about EVERYTHING. She holds this mirror up to her guiding principles and then picks everything apart until she's left with this uncivilized and selfish husk, which she then covers up in a sparkly jumpsuit to make it all better. WHICH IS SOMETHING WE ALL DO. We're all basically uncivilized and selfish. But this author has the guts to admit it.<br /><br />YOU ARE BRAVE, ALLIE. YOU ARE.<br /><br />I feel strangely proud of the author forproducing this book. Proud like a father, even though she is no relation to me and I have never really met her. I want to give her all the gold stars possible. If there were more than five available for this review, I would have gone with more than five. All the way up to eleventy.<br /><br />Buy this book. Read it. Go read the blog. Re-read everything. Then buy the book for your friends.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Just downloaded to my Kindle Fire and already can't enough! Must say Candy Crush Saga is cutting into my reading time,  but in a good way!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game!  Makes you think about 5 moves down the road before you make your first one!  Keeps you playing!
B0046UBPG8|5.0|I told my daughters to forget looking for a husband and find someone like Annette Benning. I would marry her myself
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|One of the best game franchises around. They continue to Deliver each and every time they put out a new game!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I'm only 11 but I find this book inspiring and John Green is an amazing writer. I love his work and I hope more will be able to experience his art of writing. This book is truly an amazing, beautiful piece of art.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|I just bought this season to see wolowizard in space. But this season didn't suck as bad as the others with blossom in them. Amy farrah Fowler actually wasn't the bad kind of weird in this season. She actually doesn't ruin every scene. Her and penny's relationship is finally paying off with the writers.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is a lot of fun, it is hard and yet skill fun and challenging. There are only ten levels, I hope they will come out with with another update to add a few more levels. Fun, challenging but enjoyable.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|This movie is perfect for and Arnold or bodybuilding buff.  It follows Arnold through his journey to earn another Mr. Olympia title.  I purchased it for my husband and ended up being very interested as well.
B00ET47USI|5.0|I really enjoy this new spider solitary it is adorable and fun. I am glad I got it. I just keep playing and playing it is just so much fun.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Got it. Love it just like all the rest. Not many shows that i can say that about after 8 seasons.
B005K17RU0|2.0|The app is slow and ad filled. The app could be so much better, cleaner, and faster but if you have patience, you'll be able to get the weather data you crave. The radar maps are so slow to load and it takes a few seconds to zoom in and out. This could be an awesome app but AccuWeather lets us down.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|my brothers and husband and I all sat for hours figuring out the puzzles. very good game especially since it was free app of the day when I got it. my only complaint is that it took a really long time to load on the kindle fire. I would reccomend this game for people who like puzzle games.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so addicting and fun!!  Can not stop playing it!!  It is so awesome.  Great Great Great FUN!!
B00BEIYMAG|1.0|&#34;The Conjuring&#34; COULD have been a great B movie -- as it is, the movie deserves a grade of F.<br />Yeah, it pushes ALL the right buttons -- and does it well! -- and as such, it is the perfect scary movie for empty-minded viewers.<br /><br /> But great horror movies -- even the B-grade ones -- and their writers and directors, knew/know that horror, like science fiction, is about something else.  It's a comment on society as well.<br /><br />&#34;The Body Snatchers&#34; was the perfect comment on McCarthyism, and when resurrected, on the Reagan and G.W. Bush eras that pushed the &#34;with us or against us&#34; school of thought.  Same for &#34;The Thing From Another World&#34; and its remake, Carpenter's &#34;The Thing&#34;. &#34;The Exorcist&#34;, while dated now, did similar things; and so did the original &#34;Carrie&#34; (B-grade or not).<br /><br />But the WORST part about &#34;The Conjuring&#34; as a horror movie is the &#34;based on true events&#34; angle, especially since it's obviously based, at least partly, on the now-debunked &#34;Amityville Horror&#34; b.s. and that Ed and Lorraine Warren claimed/claim all of that was &#34;real&#34;.  Worse, it uses -- literally -- the memory of those who were persecuted and murdered during the Salem Witch trials, basically reinforcing the neo-Christian Conservative mindset so prevalent these days. Like we need more of that ignorance in America.  Yeeeech.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|i loved this book (no synopsis here because that is available everywhere else!) because i live in central oregon, home to part of the cascade mtns, and it was great fun reading about her hike through this area. great character development and made me feel like i knew the people in her life at this time. very humbling and inspiring, and an easy enough read that it can be put down and picked right back up without forgetting what happened. fluffy but satisfying. will look forward to reading her other books.
B009UVWBMA|5.0|Love her singing and what she does with the kids and her fans.<br />She does a lot of things for her fans. and the kids.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This is another movie that my parents love - so I ordered it hoping that both movies I had ordered would be shipped together and get there before I came for a visit.  They both arrived promptly, the quality was excellent, price was excellent - can't ask for more than that!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Overall i really liked this book. I have never read a book of this sort before, so it was a little hard to follow along with at first. I kept reading other books instead. So i finally forced myself to read it. Then i really got into it. Lots of twist and turns. My biggest disappointment was the return and the story from that point. The characters just became weak and somewhat annoying after that. Maybe i was just hoping for too much. But, non-the-less, it was a great read.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|This is the Funniest kid movie out there.  It was so amusing I couldn't stop laughing! We saw it at the theatre and had to rent it at home! Great job!
1449305172|5.0|Lean Startup was very important book to me. It is very practical, there are many real life examples which help to apply knowledge to your business almost immediately.
B00BSZZA3I|5.0|My son saw it and wanted it for his new Htc one phone. I had ordered him a different phone case that didn't work out and he saw this one.I got it for his birthday and he loves it..thanks
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Great game! Keeps me occupied, very addicting some levels can be challenging. Can't believe it's free will recommend to all of my friends.
B005LAIHRC|5.0|Great movie.  It is a wonderful musical with a twist.  Must love the 80's music in order to enjoy this film. Fast delivery
B006LSZECO|5.0|Just when you think you have it all figured out.........I couldn't put it down. Everyone should read this book. Shockingly refreshing in ways that fool you into thinking it is just another predictable murder mystery. It is so much more than that. So much more v
B003ODIZL6|5.0|The dictionary is very useful , but it would be more helpful if it had page numbers and you could search by that.
B0068LYEHA|4.0|The cover makes this look a lot more intimidating than it is. It is a feminist manifesto for the 21st century, but it reads more like David Sedaris's twin sister's highly entertaining memoir. There is nothing dry or academic in her feminism, in fact, that's her point: when did feminism become something we were afraid to admit to?<br /><br />I was heartened by some of her bolder arguments about weight, abortion and bikini waxing. Yes, she does range that far, addressing a hodgepodge of issues she considers those of &#34;being a woman,&#34; both superficially and biologically.<br /><br />Because she is so ambitious in the range of her subject matter, there were times when she strays a bit far. For instance ranting about the type of underwear a woman wears, she tries to present her personal tastes as feminist ones, but really, who cares what kind of panties we're all choosing.<br /><br />Aside from those minor points however I found it delightful, inspiring and very entertaining.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|This app is so nice I bought the full version. Be it children at the school a cross the street or the ever present leaf blowers and lawn mowers this little app really does the trick when I need to sleep. The diurnal beats are quite effective and a gentle rain lulls me to sleep. My only wish is that I could add my self hypnosis audio into the mix.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This device from google will let you stream ONLY what google allows you to. You cannot stream your own movies, you must buy them again at the play store and stream them.  Why would you do that?  You can watch you tube and netflix.  After using it for 20 minutes I boxed it up and ordered that UPS come get the worthless piece of rubbish.  IF you want to stream hundreds of stations of every type, just spend an extra $15 and get a roku box.  Google would do well to stay out of the business of infuriating people with inferior products. Microsoft is doing quite well in that arena on its own.
B005AVIZ6U|3.0|I have read a number of the books in the Jack Reacher series. Whilst this was a good read, there are better.
B00FN811SY|5.0|This is the best app for doing research on religious topics and for reading the bible. One have the choice of reading a scripture from four translations. This app is excellent!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is awesome, I have had it three days and haven't wanted to put it down. Can't wait for up dates...
B000SEGTI0|5.0|You don't need to bee a Sci-Fi fan, or a Phillip K. Dick fan to like this book. I'm none of that, and got to the book curious from the movie. From the moment I started, the story  got me glued to my kindle. Great way to start reading PKD.
006202406X|5.0|Allegiant is a great book in the trilogy of Divergent. It is fast paced, and keeps you entertained at all turns.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|First if all, I would like to say I love it. It has all the standard characteristics that a calculator should have. I would like if it had square route. I use this almost every day!!!!!!<br /><br />  Second of all, I recommend it to everyone. It is helpful I think for most grades 1-12 and most likely college students also.  My brother and I have  it and love it. It is good for not only doing your work (for some people cheating but it is also very useful for checking your answers.<br /><br />Third of all, YOU SHOULD GET IT. If you are reading this right now.. then your awesome btw!!!!!!:):)
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This book has you pondering life and decisions. It makes you ask what if and if only I did that. Our lives are so intertwined and this easy read reminds you
B00DPUB56U|5.0|Vampires occupy a unique place in our cultural history.  Trapped between life and death, they’re often portrayed as the classical romantic character in spite of the fact that they must prey on the living – on consuming human blood – in order to survive.  When they love, they love eternally, but circumstances often require them to keep from ‘blessing’ their soulmates with the gift of eternal life (or whatever comes close).  Because they’re still so very close to regular folks, they’re often given stories to explore the tragedy of their existence; audiences end up caring for them more often than they fear them, and the fictional yet mortal counterparts they come in contact with often envy them as much as they try to resist their charms.<br /><br />Simply put, they’re two sides of the human coin, and rarely does a vampire story convey the joy and the pathos of being one as does BYZANTIUM, the new thriller from director Neil Jordan.<br /><br />(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you’re the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I’d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you’re accepting of a few modest hints at ‘things to come,’ then read on …)<br /><br />The young Eleanor Webb (played by the increasingly bankable Saoirse Ronan) continues writing her life story in a paper manuscript; and then she throws them away.  The reality she lives is one she cannot truly speak about: she’s a vampire, trapped in her teenage body, sharing an existence from one hidden corner to the next with her sensuously depraved mother Clara (Gemma Arterton has never been lovelier!).  However, the weight of these past two hundred years has begun to take its toll on Eleanor, and she chooses – against her mother’s wishes – to share her secret with Frank (Caleb Landry Jones), a Leukemia-stricken teen smitten with her young feminine wiles.  Will the consequences prove too grave for mother and daughter?<br /><br />BYZANTIUM is a consistently delight from start to finish, but it’s certainly not your average run-of-the-mill vampire story.  Granted, it has teenagers and romance – even welcome hints of undying love – but it’s a far cry from the tweeny TWILIGHT flicks that have filled the multiplexes over the past few years.  This is an adult tale exploring the weight of adult consequences … even when that adult happens to be a sixteen-year-old woman experiencing her two hundredth year on Earth.<br /><br />Part of what elevates BYZANTIUM toward such heights is masterful script adaptation by Moira Buffini (based on her play, “A Vampire Story”).  This is a world she’s gone to great lengths to create, giving this particular breed of vampire its own unique origins story (rest assured, it probably won’t be what you’re expecting) as well as a mysterious organization referred to as ‘The Brotherhood’ that works in secrecy in order to keep it all hush-hush.  Buffini has crafted two believable female characters – a rarity in today’s films – in the mother/daughter team who are tied together as much by their curse as they are the secrets they keep.  Arterton vacillates nicely between keeping her daughter under her control while doing all that she can (including selling herself to men seeking sexual gratification) to provide for her; by contrast, Ronan retreats into the darkness, choosing to spend much of her time alone, exploring her fears, thoughts, dreams, and wishes despite always pining for more.<br /><br />What veteran director Neil Jordan does is serve up a completely fresh perspective on vampire lore.  He does so having previous directed INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE, which also had a terrific method of examining these bloodsuckers against the backdrop of personal history.  No doubt that’s what drew him to BYZANTIUM, I suspect, but the film neverfeels like its treading on familiar ground.  Rather, there’s a freshness here, much of that due to the fact that these vampires are shackled with a human vulnerability – they actually ‘care’ for one another, and, thus, the tension surrounding their possible monstrous behavior feels only part horror mixed with one part salvation.<br /><br />Deftly photographed and leisurely told, BYZANTIUM will not be for everyone.  However, for those who succumb to its inevitable bit, this is definitely a tale worth telling.<br /><br />BYZANTIUM (2012) is produced by Demarest Films, Lipsync Productions, Number 9 Films, Parallel Film Productions, WestEnd Films, and IFC Films.  DVD distribution is being handled through MPI Media Group.  As for the technical specifications, clearly no expense was spared in bringing this moody and atmospheric thriller to life.  For those interested in special features, there are a wealth of interviews, focusing on the actors as well as the behind-the-scenes talent that were necessary to serve up this wicked and occasionally bloody story.<br /><br />HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION POSSIBLE.  BYZANTIUM is the rarest of horror dramas: it’s a subtle concoction that brews slowly, methodically, weaving its tapestry from the fabric of time.  The performances are terrific – Arterton and Ronan continue to deliver on the early promises of their respective careers, and director Jordan works wonders from scenes other leaders would pass over cursorily.<br /><br />In the interests of fairness, I’m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at MPI Media Group provided me with a DVD copy of BYZANTIUM by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.feels like its treading on familiar ground.

B006UKFFE0|5.0|Running Lean is especially helpful for those that have read The Lean Startup or The Four Steps to Epiphany.  It is filled with detailed, concrete examples to assist in learning real world application of The Lean Startup methodology.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Awesome graphics and fun to spend time playing. Great selection of weapons as well! If your looking for a great hunting game, this app is  a great choice, and its free!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|The only thing I don't like is that you can create God, but not the bible. I'm Christian, and that's weird. They don't do Jesus either. Other than that, I love it.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Like so many, I was so eager to read the conclusion to this trilogy as I was so drawn into the first 2 books. I found Tris to be an interesting &#34;savior-like&#34; character with many layers to her. You want to root for her. You want to like her. And the plot was so fascinating - a society part of a larger experiment, the interplay of all the factions and the factionless, the set up of brother against sister, friend against friend. I felt like Ms. Roth could have gone into so many interesting directions for Allegiant and I frankly found this book to be slightly boring and very confusing. The first two books are written entirely from the perspective of Tris. There is also a short story written from the perspective of Tobias. The third book on the other hand are told from the perspective of both Tris and Tobias. alternating between the two in different chapters. Ok - that's different but I would then get confused who was talking at the time. Is it Tris or Tobias? I also found this book to be a slower read than the first two books with alot of chapters gone before the real meat of the story comes through. And why or why do writers insist on not writing happy endings in book series?!?! It's maybe fine for a stand alone book. But in book series, the writer is setting you up to root for certain characters and certain outcomes and when that does not happen, the reader feels supremely let down (as I did) with no real resolution. This should have been so much better.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|great product. very useful for youtube and netflix. needs some polishing and a better app for computer but the apps for handheld devices are great.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I really like this game it has good graphics and kind  hard but once you start upgrading your robot it becomes easy so you should download this app
B00CEK9OTM|3.0|For the game Core Dive you have to have fast reflexes.  I got stuck on a bunch of levels.  I personally would not play this game often.
B00005JKDQ|5.0|The item came pretty fast. It made my daughter extremely happy. She plays it over and over again.<br /><br />Thank you for making my babygirl happy. God bless you. When you have a child with a mental disability, its hard to find THAT ONE thing that they are into. But once you find it, and they love it, its a great feeling.
B00005R5G9|5.0|I enjoyed this movie from the very start of the film, throughout and all the way up to the end. It has everything: cheesy 80's clothing & music, a flamboyant and sweet fashionista co-worker, bad guys, and the love between a boy and his mannequin. Seeing Sex & the City's &#34;Samantha&#34; before her plastic surgery also reminded me of how she never needed any in the first place. If you love the 80's and you enjoy a silly movie now and then, this is a must watch.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I'm casting from my Windows 8.1 laptop using Google Chrome and it simply does what it says it will do. Awesome!
034580404X|4.0|Loved the storyline.  Very interesting!!  Hopefully the movie will be just as good.  Wonder if there will be a part four.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I love to sing out-loud so I don't usually go for instrumental but this is an awesome album. I have loved Lindsey Stirling's stuff for years (Thanks Youtube!) and am glad that she is getting recognition.<br /><br />I recommend this kind of music for when you are cleaning and want to crank it up or for listening to with headphones when you are reading. The songs transition nicely and it's the kind of album you can listen to on repeat for hours.
B000EWBNMS|4.0|This show is a must watch for any die hard fan of the paranormal. Patricia Arquette embodies this character so well that you almost forget it's a character she's playing. Each episode is a bit different from the last. I don't feel as if any of the episodes I've seen are the same story line though some of the stories are interconnected in relationship with the characters and the history of the show.
B004VN39YG|5.0|I watched this movie 3 times so far.  It just reaches in and touches my heart.  I love the singing too.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am sooo glad you finally you got this game for Kindle fire HD, I waited for ever and it was worth the wait. Can't put it down. This game is super, I even downloaded pet rescue. You people are amazing. Lol Charles and gizmo
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It's called a &#34;Chrome&#34;cast, so you MUST install the Google Chrome browser on your computer. It works as described and very easy to install.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Finished the book. I thought it was ok it got a little over dramatic in places. I would not recommend it to a friend
B00785P2QC|3.0|No issues with game ,easy tutorial  would recommend , good time killer.will update again after a fw days pl@ying it
B00129H7VS|5.0|This is a well know HBO series, but I do not know if you need it in blu ray I am not convinced.
B004GYY714|5.0|11-06-13 The latest update, v10.0, works on my Kindle Fire HDX - this is a five star app!!!!<br /><br />Original review:<br />I consider this a 5 star app on my Kindle Fire HD, but it doesn't work on my Kindle Fire HDX.  On my Kindle Fire HDX the app streams for a second, then pauses for a second or two & repeats this.  On my Kindle Fire HD it works fine.  I tested using podcasts & radio stations - same station, same wifi network & the app works with the HD but not the HDX.
B005PK57IK|5.0|i watched on network television when it first came out... and now that a friend is hooked, he is watching much of what i already saw and it is fun to re connect...but i have missed several shows... seeing it via amazon is NICE
B00005JLKB|5.0|The world is a better place because of amazon. They have everything covered so I dont have to worry about things like on most of the internet.
B00AA7V2Z0|4.0|3/4 of the way through Season 1, the pilot remains the scariest episode of the show and, frankly, the best. The rest of the show is very good, but seems to pale somewhat in comparison to that phenomenal opening salvo that assaulted your senses, shocked you, and just maybe turned you on a little. This show is definitely worth a watch and I cannot wait to see what Seasons 2 and 3 have in store for us.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|As usual, the final book in a trilogy (especially one centered around a dystopian society) is disappointing and well, anti-climatic to say the least. The writing was actually decent (where most authors seem to be in a hurry and rush through the plot to come to a somewhat palpable ending that they butcher the technical and creative aspects of writing which I find impossible to read, let alone enjoy), however, the plot was basically nonexistent in the sense that it felt so far removed from the world of Divergent and Insurgent that I didn't really understand why the author would take her characters there. Maybe Roth wanted that contrast, yet with the forced rebellions and thin plot it just seemed so blah compared to her first two novels. Within the first 150 pages or so I knew this book would not live up to my expectations. I was not disappointed with the ending as most were, in fact I was hoping she would take a risk where so many authors would not, but for me it did not redeem or even justify the direction that Roth went this book.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|The story was realistic.  I was fascinated by the author's use of first person.  Then the use of third person made her decline so terrible.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great for killing time when I am waiting around or on the go. Realistic detail for a pet horse game.
B00BHSEKAK|1.0|First of all it reeks of chemical odor, don't know, maybe it is just leather glue, but it smells like some very  non leathery substance.  Second of all, it doesn't lay smoothly around camera body.  There is bulges everywhere.  If this case was sold in parts, I would have bought lower half, which is decent.  However, the upper half is just hideous.  It doesn't close smoothly, interfere with the lens (non hooded regular lens) and the parts where it attaches to lower half bulges up significantly.  And for this I have to pay 80 dollars.  No way, back to Amazon it goes.
0515142247|5.0|Lee Child's early books about Reacher are, imho, better than the last few he's done--with the exception of his latest.
B0010T0OCY|4.0|It is very nice to see Rufus Sewell play something other than a villain. Furthermore, this is probably one of my favorite rolls for Keifer Sutherland.<br />Dark City is a Noir dystopia set seemingly in the 1950's, yet not all is what it appears to be. John Murdoch is a man on the run, a man with no memories and he has to solve the secret of Dark City before it is too late for him and for everyone.
1451666179|5.0|I've loved Hyperbole and a Half as a blog for a long time, so as soon as I found out there was a preorder on her book, I bought it. It came in today and it did not disappoint.<br /><br />One thing that surprised me, it's huge! It was a much thicker book than I was expecting. I really appreciate that each story is on different color-ed pages, so it's really easy to flip to a new story.<br /><br />There are some of the great classics of the blog in here and I'm so glad to have them in paper. And there's lots of wonderful new material.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game. its awesome.i love dragons. The game is fun and you can spend as lot of time on it without getting bored.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|My 2 month old daughter constantly loses her pacis, the wubba has given her something to hang on to.... it's great for the trips where I can't put her paci back in for her over and over again.
B0060AY6FO|4.0|I enjoyed the author's ideas on how all my favorites P&P characters were doing. She even expounded on why things happened back before Darcy and Elizabeth got married. (There was a mistake or two about what happened in P&P, but that was fun - picking out  small mistakes.)<br />The mystery itself wasn't that great, not boring though.<br />I felt sorry for the people in America - you'll find out why if you read the  book.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|It's not often that a book so engrosses you that even when you are not reading it, it is still with you, still haunting you, but this one is one of those rare ones. Amazing characters, a story that will spellbound you, and photos you will still see when you choose your eyes... I can't wait for the sequel!
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|Get this album.  Don't just buy one song here or there.  JUST GET IT!  There is not one song on this album that isn't worth it.  This is a complete front to back rock album with zero filler.  Alter Bridge is not underrated but I think they are severely underplayed on the radio.  Do yourself a favor and get this.  You won't regret it.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|But a fantastic story, a great read. I hope there are future books involving four,zee,Christina,Caleb and the rest. Loved it.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Extremely sad but extremely fitting, many give it low ratings for being sad but it is extremely fitting and ends in a way that is true to all the characters
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Not impressed & disappointed, 1 & 2 were awesome, this one not so much! Feeling kind of cheated i guess!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so glad candy crush saga is now on my kindle fire.  It's so much better than on my phone as it is bigger...I will play unless they start asking for money constantly ..then I will stop..fixed income and not a lot to spare...
B000LXQVA4|5.0|My little boy absolutely loves this jumper!!! He goes in it at least 3 times a day and it's as though he is trying it for the first time. The toys keep him jumping because they make noise/light up as he jumps. I would definitely recommend this to moms who are looking to keep their babies busy/happy while they return phone calls or simply relax and watch them jump.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I really enjoyed Floors Escape. Well designed and simply challenging without wi-fi needed.<br /><br />I wish there were more floors to solve and look forward to an update.
B00EXVZW6E|5.0|I really enjoy these types of games.  I wish they didn't end tho.  I don't know how many times I have been going through this one as I really enjoy it when I don't have a lot of time & when I want to relax.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Wonderful book. A good read. True John Gresham<br />..this novel was right up there with time to kill. Loved it
1475143389|5.0|Well written, scientifically supported and detailed book about simple science of building athletic body.<br />I've been training for long years but with no success in gaining weight. Michael's book revealed to me some although simple but working principles in training, eating, supplementing and resting.<br />It's been third month since I have started following these principles and I've gained almost 6 pounds of lean muscle mass.<br />Take a look at this book - it worth hundred times its weight in gold. :-)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed Can you Escape. Well designed and simply challenging without wi-fi needed.<br /><br />It didn't handle interruptions too well and froze up several times, but that MIGHT (I doubt it) be a problem with my tablet.<br /><br />I wish there were more floors to solve and look forward to an update.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|My husband and I just started watching sons and had to order all the seasons. We're on season 4 now.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Cannot wait to see the next season airing in January. This is a CLASSIC series that I hope never ends.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is a great story on so many levels. A must read for dog lovers, as we all know that they think exactly as told in this story!
B0042RJWTC|5.0|I had heard so much about this series at work, and thought that I would buy it so that I could watch the whole series without interruptions and knowing that I would not be missing any of the episodes, which is normally what happens.  The characters where great.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|totally entertaining ! lots of fun , and great excersize for the brain! Really keeps your mind guessing and trying to beat the number of moves against the number of  candies  you have to clear, in order to move on . I love it .
1608871827|5.0|A love letter to fans of Japanese giant monster and giant robot genre, Pacific Rim is sure to delight the fanboys and fangirls. There are tons of concept arts and behind the scene stills, detailing how the idea for the movie got conceived, pitched, and finally brought to life under the direction of Guillermo Del Toro. The book is scattered with nice appendages such as stickers and blueprints of the Jaegers. There are explanations and notes from Del Toro and some key personnels responsible for the visuals and concept arts of the film. Overall, this is one of the finest movie-based art books of 2013. Definitely a must have.
B008NW1M4K|5.0|Mein Highlight seit langen. Toll geschrieben und nicht als Verherrlichung dieser Zeit zu verstehen. 5 Sterne von meiner Seite und volle Empfehlung.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun game that my whole family loves. Once you start playing this it is very hard to put it down
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I like it because it is perfect eye co-ordination required , especially when playing two or more cards. Those numbers are called somewhat fast, and you really need to stay focused. I like it
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I'm addicted to playing this game on my fire. It is so much fun. It is very user friendly. And it is very easy.
B0030ZOYHC|2.0|This movie is terrible considering it as a standalone movie. If you do not know anything about the series, you will not know what's going on. This is not an attack on the series or the movie in the context of the series. It's a review for people who want to just pick up and watch a movie without having any background knowledge.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|I just found out about this book yesterday and read a majority of it backstage. This book kept my attention and I finished it within a couple hours. I would recommend this book to everyone, and I feel it has something for everyone. This book is a combination of drama, romance, mystery, and self discovery. An amazing read!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Those coins pushing forward toward the edge of the bucket are just too much !Then you get those prices and gifts that just fall out of nowhere and add to your loot !! I really like that !
0634086782|5.0|Well written and researched.  Great  reference tool with many useful examples.  My only criticism it was published as a paperback rather than spiral bound.  Nevertheless I would recommend it.
B004EC5IUW|2.0|This movie is terrible considering it as a standalone movie. If you do not know anything about the series, you will not know what's going on.

0783225482|5.0|Worth Every Penny❤ I always wanted this movie, and now that I have it I'm as happy as can be.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I knew how it was going to end before I read it.  I didn't want it to end this way but I knew that was the only way it could and still be true to  Tris. Plus the author would have to come up with a future for Tobias and Tris. It was a sad ending. Good trilogy.
B00DOPEGAS|5.0|my daughter love it i so glad i got it for her,,, yes i will buy this product again if any one ask about this product i will say yes  your daughter will love it
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|I love Bill Bryson's books.  He makes the most mundane subjects absolutely fun to read about.  He has chosen 1927 as a seminal year and then told stories of the people and events that made it such an important part of American history.  A great read.  Something new to learn on almost every page!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is filled with a wonderful mixture of happy and sad , life and death. I have deeply become attached to hazel and gus and i am sad to say that my &#34;time with them &#34; is over. Its almost as if .. This is real in my heart.
B00D7NWTSI|4.0|Great action. I grew up reading about all these characters and it's like a comic book brought to the screen. Spectacular effects
159644357X|4.0|Wanted to get this after hearing it mentioned in a homily. I liked it but it comes all in one peice instead of chapters good product though.
B000QCS8TW|1.0|I could care less about portrayals of women and sex and rape and all that. If something is important to the story and organic to the character, I can run with almost anything. It's the writing and the manipulation that have me passionately hating this book. The writing is abysmally terrible. Lots of telling, little showing, point of view issues. There is miles and miles and miles of description without end that contributes nothing to the story. The characters are all hateful. I feel like the author is manipulating the characters to doing terrible, horrible things to incite the big war or conflict or whatever is coming. Doesn't feel real. I was hating the story before I got to the part where Ned killed Lady, but once that weakling killed an innocent animal for no reason, I was completely over it. I am baffled by the story's popularity. Utterly baffled.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|It was great in the beginning,but I have to admit.it did get a little slow but picked back up. I HATE the ending!! It was well written but I wish it ended differently
B00902MCVY|5.0|this music is both primal and musically sophisticated; I can't get enough of it and would highly recommend it to friends
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|LOVED IT WOULD RECOMEND IT TO MY FRIENDS VERY GOOD LOVED ITTHAT IS IT I DO NOT HAVE ANY MORE<br />BY
B00CATSONE|4.0|This is a very quick and easy read.  If you want the highlights on Tesla's life this is the book for you.
B0018LMZO4|4.0|If it were just the album, I love it.  One or two of the bonus tracks are good additions, but most are just repetitions of what are on the album.  Extended versions are only extended by a few seconds, but the extended versions could be substituted in a playlist.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game!  Love it on Kindle!  Just feeds my crush addiction.  Now if i could just beat that dang level!
B00BSBVJVE|4.0|Cute furry, laugh out loud, adorable. Pusheeh, is an adorable chubby grey tabby cat, who has short bits of wisdom to share with the world. He has the ability to bring a smile to the simplest of activities.<br />I have seen a few gifs, and drawing of him before this book. But I had no idea of his range as an actor. This adventurous cuddly cat is full of fun. This would be a great coffee table book. Simply drawn and yet filled with emotional value.
B000002I97|5.0|I really liked this album when it came out.  It was a different kind of music than I was used to, but it was fun to listen to.  My wife loves John Prine which was an incentive to purchase it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|No complicated mumbo jumbo- plug it in, select the name and the wireless network and with a few taps on the tablet, the chromecast is all set up and ready to stream to the TV.  Right now its only YouTube that streams ( Since I am not in the US), hulu and netflix are not available outside the US, but I see google adding more apps that could use this device. Great price too
B003EYVXTG|4.0|I saw the preview for this movie on a DVD for another movie and ordered it.  I can see why it didn't make much of a dent in the theatres, but it was interesting.  It kept my attention, and I couldn't wait to see what happened next.  Not for the faint of heart.
B000URDE2Y|4.0|I love several of the songs on this album, though there are some tracks I may delete from a playlist.  It is Trower's best album in my book.  Some of the bonus tracks are mere repetitions, but there is some different songs as well.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Of all John Grisham's books, this one ranks with his best. He is a son of the South, as I am, and the characters, local and plot are so believable one cannot help but be totally involved. It is a great read for people in any part of the world.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This game is so addictive; I cannot put it down. I play a level every night before going to bed and whenever I have to wait for an appt.
B004EPZ00C|3.0|Ok movie, but you got to like the humor.  I just wanted it for my collection and occassion viewing basically.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|yup it works perfectly good app worth tbr downlooad I would certainly recommend oh n go pack go a a a
B00DW1WR14|5.0|I just cannot get enough! This is a fantastic CD!  Eddie and the boys make history again, but who is surprised by that?
B00005UL6G|5.0|Being a long time fan of the brilliant 1973 film The Wicker Man, I was a little surprised at first by all the negative reviews here on Amazon, but then i realized that the garbage that passes for horror, and film in general in the 21st Century has deadened peoples' senses so overwhelmingly, that they have forgotten what true beauty is.....or maybe never knew in the first place?  I suggest watching more 60s/70s horror films, and forget about what year you were born....great films like these are timeless, unlike the pathetic U.S. remake with ol' Nick Cage......what crap!
0060786523|4.0|A sprawling and self-indulgent feast of family and social interactions that wonderfully illuminate the Indian cultural, social, and political landscape of 1952.  Religious tensions, urdu poetry and music, family hierarchy and mating rituals and challenges, religious tolerance and intolerance interwoven with politics, the legacy of the Indian aristocracies and the emerging aristocracies within bureaucratic universities and parliaments.  There is ample space for everything in a book that is said to be the longest single volume novel in the English language.<br />The size is not for the faint hearted, and little is lost by using \\"speed reading\\" techniques.<br />A rich treasure.
B008Q08IV4|5.0|What a great movie.  Tom Hanks does a great job. A timeless classic that will around for years to come. The portrayals of historical events makes for a great story with 'dumb' luck included.
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|An excellent transition from singing country music to bluegrass from one of the purest traditional country singers out there today.
B000002H6C|5.0|Thank you amazon for this purchase, cd is used and its still in mint condition......how is this possible, what Sorcery is this...I love you guys. Amazon never fails to come through again and again. Rock on......
B005FMZVLQ|1.0|For the price fine, however the tachymeter with the sweep second hand doesn't work.  The sweep second hand works but it does not stop and all in the &#34;start&#34; position.  Even reading the instructions before trying the various functions it would not work.  If I could return it I would but because of the time and price of return shipping, the trash the best course of action.
B00DQQSD3G|2.0|It's a great book that i already had in print edition, but i bought the ebook edition after rave reviews in several podcasts. Imagine my disappointment when afterwards i found out that i need a Kindle Fire or Apple device to see/hear the extra content. I have a top-of-the-line Android tablet and phone and there's no technical reason the extra content shouldn't be available for me.<br />I had wanted to get all the Kindle editions of these books, but this has left a sour taste in my mouth that will prevent me from getting the rest.
B00005K3O4|5.0|This movie scared the hell outta me in high school one night when I came home drunk. I urinated on the couch and barfed on the cat...those clowns are such rascals..!!!!!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I've always enjoyed the Pentergast stories, they're quite riveting and never dull.  It will keep you wanting more and more.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love Candy Crush but some of the levels get boring when it takes forever to get through them a couple I was on for couple weeks and lost candy crush friends because they say the same thing and they just quit playing
B0000A0DRY|5.0|One of my favorite groups and have always loved this record(now CD).  This brings back great memories and always will.
B00F30S0Y0|5.0|all great artists evolve.they go through phases.Arcade Fire is now in a bass heavy EDM phase.<br />but the emotions are kept.this will make you laugh or cry if you love Arcade Fire.<br />afterlife is my fav song so far.but that will change.Reflektor will always be there.and it grows on me day<br />by day.gets better and better.like all classic records.<br />Reflektor is like Achtung baby or Kid A.it's that good.<br />I would never live without it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game.  The entire family is addicted.  I have been waiting forever for it to be available on the Kindle HD.  No longer have to share the laptop with my hubby.  Taking turns sucked!  LOL  i have had it for about a month.  So far no glitches.  Game instantly sync with Facebook and loaded my progress and candy friends.
159463176X|4.0|This book was good, but not nearly as good as his first two books.  I could not put the first two down, I read them so quickly, and this took me awhile to get through.  I would recommend it, but it was not a page turner like I was hoping for.
B0051GOB26|5.0|This is what happens when you find a stranger in the Alps. Shut the F up Donny. It Really tied the room together.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I am not very good at making the hard, angled shots but i still do pretty well.  The graphics are good and the game works well on the Kindle Fire HD.  No glitches or problems so far.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|Great Story and entertainment value. Enjoyed the story line and the excitement of the film.<br />Great horse racing action photography
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham takes us back to the beginning and where our love affair with his story telling abilities all began in the courtroom with Jake Brigance and his irascible, drunken mentor Lucien.  This time around the drama centers around a reclusive, eccentric, secretive old white man who bequeaths his estate to his black maid in the old South....and once again bigotry and racism become the back drop for one hell of a story.  No one paints the past of small southern towns better than Grisham.  His characters enthrall, beguile, teach you and preach to you and never fail to make you see how the past isn't as long ago as we think.  Sycamore Row is a rousing good read...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|FINALLY! It's here for the Kindle Fire HD. Lots of levels, fun, and very challenging.I love this game! I highly recommend it.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|Katy sounds great and love the deluxe edition. the extra songs are worth the money. Several stand out songs, but really like \\"By the Grace of God'. I think there will be hits from this one. Wish this came out in the summer...great top down/Beach party/club music.
B001QOGYBI|4.0|Not sure what to expect but this is a cool movie. Wes Anderson has an interesting style with anything he does, and this is no exception
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|.... even if I did not buy the research--which I do, by the way.  My whole family realized, decades ago, that we gained weight, felt heavy in body and mind, when eating too many grains, wheat being the worst but, recently, corn, equally bad (GMO corn, I'm wondering?).  In fact, we realized it was not just grains but starches, as well, that seemed to be our nutritional enemies. It wasn't just the &#34;food coma&#34; we got after a heavy grain meal, but the indigestion, thick waists, and foggy minds that seemed to be in play, the more grains we ate.<br /><br />I won't go on, but it's nice to see our personal experiences explained and a rationale given, at long last.<br /><br />I also realize that each person's genetics and biochemistry are different, but for many of my family members--we're nearly 100% UK ancestry, heavily Scots and Irish--the grain and starch limits have been incredibly helpful.<br /><br />I noticed, online, that some MDs were knocking this book, but also noticed that one or two physicians were consultants to products that were either grain industry-releated or were members of the old FDA grain-heavy diet protocol.  Hmmmmmm.  &#34;Conflict of Interest?  Table for one?&#34;  Whatever the politics, I enjoyed/learned from my purchase.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game, but it is extremely addicting!! U have to be a strong one not to spend money!! I love being able to link it with my Facebook too!!
B00006LLLN|5.0|If you like great vocals and bluegrass style music, this is a great cd to get. She can really sing and the band is talented as well
B00992CF6W|3.0|Ok so I have it at 3star so I could tell them about something called spell check also they need an update to pc version.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I really liked The Shining, so this was a no-brainer to download.  Didn't disappoint me!  I enjoyed the book from start to finish.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is an entertaining little game.  I love the puzzles.  My only complaint is that there are only 10 levels.  I would like many more.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Honest answer - I bought this for the first 3 movies and accepted that Crystal Skull came with it. Picture quality is on point and the audio is superb. Don't let the fourth movie stop you from getting it all together, especially when you consider all that bonus footage (which matters to me).
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett does an excellent job of bringing history to life and providing new perspectives on events we are aware of but have not taken the time previously to fully appreciate and understand.
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|Coming of age, learning to trust, over coming fear and developing courage. A young hero's journey to manhood. Great themes for family entertainment.  I really enjoyed this film. It was not only visually great but had substance and great action. Jaden Smith did a very good job on this for a young actor. I watched it twice and will purchase it for my collection. Highly recommended.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have waited for a long time for Kindle Fire HD to get this game. I no longer wish I  had gotten an I Pad instead. I am back to loving my Kindle.n
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|The Pacific Rim is  about fighting against alien with their creature for saving Earth. It has a lot of action,large robot and destruction. Its sound,color and action is very clear with special effect.  Highly recommend,for family with little children. Fun as to watch with family or friends.
1449305172|5.0|The best tactical and practical book on the Lean Start up movement available today. I have read many of the other books but Ash's book takes a real hands on, systematic approach to applying Lean Start Up principles and has literally changed my career focus in Product Management. A great companion to both Eric Reis and Steve Blanks books on Lean Start Up and Customer Driven Development principles. This is a must read for any entrepreneur who wants to get to a solution that the market will buy (and do all this in the least amount of time). Great for &#34;intra-preneurs&#34; as well in establish corporations. I have read many of these books as well but none has given me the tactical tools to APPLY Lean Start Up principles like this book has for me. In fact, I have the president of our company reading it to find better ways to meet the needs of our market. I can't recommend this book enough to my colleagues. Great stuff!!!
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|Another typical thought provoking book by Gladwell. Once you get going hard to put down. Deserves 4 1/2 stars. His work is one of the fee I would read again.

B00F880BWG|5.0|This is a great way to watch the Walking Dead. The new episodes arrive in your library about 12 hours after being aired. Last year it was 30 minutes, but that has changed and you will be waiting until the next morning to watch
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I could not get into this book and I have not finished it. I would like to receive a credit on my Kindle for this book. It is too much of stuff I didn't care for. YUK!!
B0063M22QO|5.0|If you have seen on you have seen them all. Many variations of course; but time passes quickly when playing this game. Great for building the Brain Cells. Experts say these and others like it tend to enhance the cell structure and reduce cell death as seen with older adults.
B00005N6KG|1.0|I have been buying this same model for the past 4 years.  I bought my last one in May 2013 for $13.99 from Amazon.  Now they charge $49.99, which is 5 months later?!  That is SO frustrating because they went out on me in the past 5 months.  There is no way that a $50 ear phone should only be good for 5 months.  How is this price increase justified?  These are NOT worth $50 because the wiring is so cheap and it breaks.  It's great for running, but I will have to find a new model where the sellers aren't being ridiculous.
0375703764|5.0|Reviews for this book should include videos collages of kittens and human sacrifice intermingled with clips from the history channel.<br /><br />If you want a book that will stir longings for dead relatives then fifteen pages later have you nursing a swollen erection...this is it.<br /><br />Never have I read a book that provoked me like this one did.<br /><br />I know you can find plot summaries or whatever on other peoples reviews but trust me if you like your books weird and are able to follow spiraling, twisty, sometimes barbed plots then this is the novel/book/words on paper experience for you.<br /><br />I highly reccomend it. Well, Im off to buy another book from this author. Peace.
B00BQPEIT2|3.0|Most of these Slots are alike with the exception of graphical changes to visual objects. Some like Cherries and others Monkey Heads, Gem Stones, and Bells for example. This game is no exception. Like others of this nature, you may get more coins in less time and the game lasts longer. The best advice, play 10 lines or less as too many lines use up all you coins and the game is over.

B00F0O8SZK|5.0|HOME FOR CHRISTMAS IS FANTASTIC, MAJESTIC, MARVELOUS, SENSATIONAL, REMARKABLE, SPLENDID, OUTSTANDING AND PERFECT.<br /><br />I am listening to Susan Boyle's new CD \\"Home For Christmas\\" right now.  What a truly fantastic voice!!!!! Majestic music right from heaven above.  Susan has given us another wonderful and delightful masterpiece.  How great this gift is: a completely enjoyable CD from her heart just for Christmas. Outstanding music, Ms. Susan Boyle! Thank you!<br /><br />1. O Come, All Ye Faithful - duet with Elvis Presley:<br />-  Song starts with soft piano notes and Susan's beautiful voice. Elvis joins in with his masterful voice, then the choir. Majestic! Marvelous! Such a wonderful way to hear this great carol. Supreme!<br /><br />2  The Lord's Prayer :<br />-  Starts with soft piano, then Susan's beautiful prayer.  Serene and blissful! Tears abound. Sensational!<br /><br />3. Little Drummer Boy:<br />-  Heavy drum starts this very nice carol.  Susan sings so strong in this song.  Very distinct, and powerful version, especially the joining of the bagpipes.  Remarkable!<br /><br />4. I'll be home for Christmas:<br />-  Oh, so dreamy! Swing and sway like long ago.  Love this dreamy, gorgeous version. The best way to reminisce past times. You naturally think of your family and far away loved ones.  It is marvelous. Splendid!<br /><br />5. When A Child Is Born, duet with Johnny Mathis:<br />-  Susan start softly, such clear notes. Great duet with Johnny's strong voice -  Susan's voice is so crystal clear and melodious.  Beautiful!<br /><br />6. The Christmas Song:<br />-  \\"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire\\", absolutely wonderful, marvelous, goes right to the heart - you really get the feeling of Christmas with this one. Sentimental!<br /><br />7. I believe in Father Christmas:<br />-  Don't know this song; however, Susan's voice is beautiful, such feelings, almost like she is singing to you, and you alone.  Nice bagpipes and lots of instrumentals in this beautiful song. What a voice!!!!!!<br /><br />8. Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas:<br />-  So smooth.  Again, what a voice.  Susan's voice is crystal clear singing here. Instrumental compliments her voice.  Singing like no other.  Such feelings come over me. Sentimental song. Listen to \\"somehow\\",  not your average singer, no way!<br /><br />9. Hark! The Herald Angels Sing:<br />-  Fantastic choir voices start this beautiful carol. The best church version you could every listen too.  It makes me feel so good. The choir joins in so beautifully. This is Christmas!!!! A regal, majestic carol!!<br /><br />10.  The Christmas Waltz:<br />- Again, Susan voice is the greatest for a Christmas ballad.  What a sweet, melodious voice.  Love it!  Guitar and Piano (old fashioned - spinet type) beautiful!  Great!  Listen to her \\"come true\\". Outstanding version!!<br /><br />11. In the Bleak Midwinter:<br />-  Not familiar with the song. Susan sings a soulful prayer here.  Reminds me of a far-away highland place. Thoughtful and meaningful!<br /><br />12 Miracle Hymn:<br />-  Speechless -  Stunning, glorious music!  What a fantastic church hymn, splendid! What a voice!  We are blessed hearing this.  Perfect church hymn - Magnificent!<br /><br />Susan, you have given us an incomparable, precious classic CD that we can enjoy forever. Thank you.
B008V8FVTI|5.0|great story, great acting. I've watched it a few times and it keeps my attention.  It's timeless, Hollywood should be this clever more often
1449305172|5.0|I've read a handful of books on this topic, and while most are helpful, this is by far the most actionable of them all.
0446547654|2.0|This was the first Nicholas Sparks book that I read.  I was disappointed and am now questioning the intelligence of the women in my life who love his works.  The story line is incredibly obvious and needlessly bounces around.  The ending was predictable, which made the last few chapters unneeded details.  Stating the obvious end in the last paragraph a few chapters back would have saved me some time.  In fact, most of the book was unneeded details, mostly irrelevant to the story line.  I like a few cheesy romance novels now and then, but this book didn't even have juicy details.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Was excellent!!!! I only wish there was more to read. I have a Kindle Fire HD that I received for Christmas 2012 and EL James books are the only books I've purchased. Looking forward to reading more. Keep up the good/EXCELLENT work!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|cant wait for season 4 to start so i can continue to watch this great series i love the old castle and houses from this era, I always read historical romances from this era!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great read. A supense filled novel with all the twist and turns of a John Grisham story. I give it a five star rating and can't wait for the next one.
B00G32QIEG|1.0|I couldn't finish the movie.  It kept freezing and reloading.  I only made it though about 10 minutes of the movie.  I finally gave up and turned it off.
B00D6OV57O|5.0|I love this album. Hans Zimmer is one of my favorite artists of all time. He has a few of my favorite OSTs.
B007SVPZMW|5.0|I loved playing tic tac toe as a child, and I still do.  Terrific Tic Tac Toe HD suits me because I can play the game whenever and wherever I want to!<br /><br />This Tic Tac Toe app has 3 themes (Doodle Cartoon, Christmas Crosses and Sidewalk Chalk).

1476727651|5.0|SK does it again. Who doesn't love Danny. So glad his story has been told, he is such a hero. Thank you Mr. king I didn't want it to end I never do with any book you write.
1449305172|5.0|Having read The Lean Startup and a series of other books in the area, I found Ash's book to be the most practical and easy to understand of the lot.<br /><br />He really lays out a clear, step by step path to validating your business ideas without investing huge amounts of time and money writing code or building the product.<br /><br />I think the ultimate testament to this book though, is the fact that I use the lessons it taught me almost every day. I am constantly referring back to it and applying the methodologies in developing my own startup (on the side of my normal job), and have recommended it to several of my colleagues at my current role with a 10 million+ revenue company as the new way we need to be taking products to market.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Wonder sleep aid.  I love the way that you can create your own mix of sounds to balance of each sound to create your own perfect mix. I even have it on my phone and Kindle.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I am deeply torn about how I feel towards this final chapter in the divergent triology. I don't want to say much more for fear of giving anything away to potential readers. I realize that not all stories have the happiest of endings because reality/life doesn't always have a happy ending, but the reason I enjoy reading young adult fiction is to escape the harsh realities of life not for my imagination to be subjected to it. So if you want a happy ending don't read this book.<br /><br />Also, the whole \\"genetically damaged\\" concept got a bit confusing at times, but I was able to figure out the basic principle enough to understand what was going on at the end.<br /><br />Still love the main characters, especially Tris & Tobias.
1595141715|4.0|Book was is in &#34;okay&#34; condition. There was a little wear maybe from water damage. The shipping was fast. But overall it was a great buy.
B00AW57L96|5.0|...then you're in luck. This book won't take you long at all; mainly because you won't be able to put it down.<br /><br />Chapter breaks are used effectively to intertwine characters' stories - each one with a cliffhanger ending. You will find yourself having to read on in order to find out what happens next! I stayed up all night just to finish it...the entire time thinking &#34;Just one more chapter!&#34;<br /><br />The only thing that I can criticize are the similes. They are as awkward as when you are walking towards somebody and you both step to the same side to get out of each other's way, then you over-correct and both step to the other side...
6304936362|4.0|The true story of a B-17 flying over Europe during WW II, the Memphis Belle. Flight scenes are good and you get the idea of a crew flying in combat. The actual story is pretty accurate. There are a couple of scenes that differ from th real stoy. I have no idea of the accuracy of the story between the flights.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|I received the deluxe copy of Paul McCartney's latest album not knowing what to expect, I read most of the reviews carefully especially the negative ones before my purchase as I always do with most albums I buy. To start with to all those people who forever are saying and writing things like  his voice is gone, his voice is not the same anymore, he can't write good songs like he use too etc etc etc. To all those people I say get a life! the man is 71 years old of course his voice won't sound the same but it stops there. The man is a genius and this album in my humble opinion is the best solo album he has ever recorded and I don't say that lightly. After the first listen I sat there stunned not believing my ears, is this Paul McCartney? yes it was it was Paul at 71 years of age playing and singing with a maturity of a troubadour that has travelled all types of roads and continues to write and play music which gives pleasure to millions of people. I truly hope he never stops writing and performing over time he has evolved as the most gifted singer/songwriter of all time, God bless you Paul.

B000FC130E|4.0|This novel is a legal hallucinogen, pure Neil Gaiman, peopled with a cast characters that straddle the line between monster and clown or angel and superhero. An enjoyable escape from the everyday world.
B004H1V5RU|1.0|Too difficult to achieve win level. After a while the children became board with it and just put it down.
B009DJB8I2|3.0|Now, chances are you bought this item for the code, and that's a pretty good reason in and of itself. Actually, the code is about the best thing about it. The packaging is attractive enough and the discs are really cool as well (printed with the various spheres) but disc 4 is what irks me about this set. It supposedly contains music from the first game, and, turns out the first game didn't have much music. So what you're stuck with is a whole disc of low hums over an extended period of time. The only redeeming quality about that disc is the ending theme to the first game. Also, don't drop this thing. I dropped it once on carpet, it hit the pivot edge, and completely fell apart. Still, we gotta agree that the Ap-Sap is awesome, eh? :D
B00D3PYQT0|5.0|This is a real wonderful series I like the UK version much better then the US, a lot more to enjoy!

044024613X|5.0|A wonderful mystery with a super ending, as well as being an interesting exploration of families in crisis.  Loved it!!
1492399493|5.0|I have this on the Kindle. I was pleased at how the author had selected a sufficiently constrained vocabulary that I was able to understand almost everything.<br /><br />Reading on the Kindle with a German dictionary installed makes it easy to look things up as you need, but a surprising amount becomes clear either from context, or from simply looking at the text. Many initially strange words turn out to be compound words which are understandable.<br /><br />I have at best an A1 level of understanding, and the text worked for me.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I've been an avid reader of the blog for years and was so excited for this book to come out. When it was finally released, I downloaded it to my kindle, and subsequently read the entire thing in a span of about 2 hours. I was definitely not disappointed! Some parts of this book are from the blog, and I enjoyed reading them again, and some parts were new. Some of these new parts surprised me and I couldn't stop myself from laughing out loud.<br />This book is great and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who has a sense of humor or enjoys laughing their ass off.<br />What are you waiting for? Buy it and read it already!
B00E7RZEI0|4.0|Originally got this for my 4 yr. old to play but found myself playing it as well.  Deceptively simple and challenging at the same time.

B000YJ54DU|5.0|Often series writers get into repeating a pattern. They just seem to switch out the details. In &#34;Nothing to Lose&#34; Lee Child takes the reader in a new and fresh direction. Yes there are some familiar elements, but the main plot is a real twist. I really appreciate Child's ability to keep his stories fresh. Great read.
B0063IH60K|1.0|this game hurts.they did a great job of ruining a classic.i dont know what else to say.dont get this.get a deck of cards.
1449305172|5.0|Ash does a great job of illustrating step-by-step processes and methods of putting Lean Startup concepts into practice.  A must read for anyone who wants to do more than theorize and talk about Lean Startup theory.  It has helped me produce tangible results.
B0091W4IRY|1.0|Purchased because it was pretty cheap.<br />Quality is lower than expected.<br />the quality fluctuates because of internet but even at its highest quality point, the quality is still just slightly better than SD. Should have bought a hard copy blu ray.
B003G94BZC|5.0|I'm a relatively new Dr. Who fan but I'm probably addicted by now. Great show, love the quality and ease of streaming on Amazon
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Love the game: keeps up with goals to keep us interested in the game. Has Holiday themed updates as well. Very addicting game!
B00F2LIV4E|4.0|Only Dreamtheater can put 19+ minute songs out and it's not surprising to the fans!  These guys never cease to amaze with their tricky and metric compositions, fresh ideas, and overall impressive musicianship.  The Bigger Picture is a track that I pretty  have on repeat, can't get enough, but I really love what they've done on this album.  The production is sonically accurate and clean and really makes all the nuances that DT fans have come to love flourish.  This album is interesting to me in that it has the old DT feel but with some kind of new twist.  I can only attribute that to Mike Mangini having joined the band and joined in on the writing on this album(although he played on the last one).  DT has been around for a long time but this album is fresh with great ballad moments, dark crunching metal, and overall melodic journeys that, for lack of a better term, are just awesome.  Long time fans, new fans alike, get this album!
B002O3Z50G|5.0|Great movie from the past. Received movie in a timely manner.<br />We enjoyed the movie and I would encourage others to check it out.<br />It does show how much film technology has changed since this<br />movie was made.
B00FDSV4TA|3.0|Music is subjective since each listener likes or dislikes a particular song for specific reasons.  This is Stone Temple Pilots, no doubt, and a couple of the songs on this EP are quite enjoyable, reminding me of an old STP back to Purple or Tiny Music.  Chester Bennington took a bit of getting used to on vocals but on the track Out of Time specifically, he really works.  The other songs I'm not in love with but it's a decent effort from a band that, in my opinion, tends to polarize their audience every time they have a release.  The old days of Dark Crunchy STP to some of the more recent Happy Melodic STP iterations make my head spin.  Even though that is true, this is a good STP release and if anything it has sparked my interest to hear more from STP with Chester.  Final verdict: give it a try, new STP is good STP!
0307730700|5.0|Great read!!! I've passed this book on to several young men and they've found it inspirational to say the least.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Have it on three devices and play all three daily.  Yes I am addicted to this game.  Try it if you have never played it!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Im more the midevil fantasy type, but reading enders game was well worth it once you get past ten percent or so.  Its fast paced, but the important part i grabbed was that Card presented the three siblings with such intelligence you believe they can accomplish anything, moreso than adults.  Overall the storyline is tight, everything happens for a reason on the macro and micro level.  Looking foward to reading more about Ender if its there.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is fun because it's not impossible. Some may find it too easy, but this is the perfect game if you just want a fun diversion without pulling your hair out.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Hey! I found out how to get kik updated version. Download &quot;APK INSTALLER&quot; on your kindle. Now search kik. You should see th updated version first , click it and bang. Your welcome.

1449305172|5.0|If you are looking to take Lean Startup theory into practice with examples and tools, Ash's book is a great place to start. Its become my go-to resource for sharing how to actually practice Lean in the startups I've worked at.
B00FEX2ZFG|1.0|I can't understand the positive reviews for this movie. Mix Amityville Horror, Poltergeist, and The Exorcist. Remove any originality, and you have this movie. Watch any of the other three instead. This was a waste of time.
B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|While many sources are listed, Aslan cherry picks his sources to make his own points.  Too many scholars disagree with selected points to make this book credible scholarship.

B008PZ69T8|2.0|Just not to my liking.  I enjoy all kinds of music and played several instruments in my life but after one time listening, I had no desire to replay it.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Best show I have ever watched on tv! Each episode keeps getting better & better. I Luv it!.. It's #1 show to me.
0345529057|5.0|I love the HBO series and wanted to see how closely it follows the books.  I have read the first one and am into over 100 pages in the second.  The series follows the books quite nicely.  Of course the books are more detailed, however the series captures all the events.  I love the books and am happy to read all the many details left out in the series.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Like the title insinuates the game is fantastic and the only complaint I have is how it is nearly impossible to get gems and in turn making some of the tasks difficult.<br />And now it sends I must ramble on order to create the twenty weird minimum.... well, this is awkward.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|nice plot, plenty of twists and a rather good ending.  one of grisham's better novels recently.  didn't want to put it down
B00479SVBU|4.0|This is a nice device.  The sound is excellent and the remote makes it easy to use.  Make sure you organize your music within folders to properly navigate through your songs.  The only hassle is that you need to bookmark your musical location before shutting off your car.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|If you don't think before you make a move, you can lose because of one foolish mistake!  Just like real life!
B009APMNB0|4.0|Installed without problems on Windows 7, 32bit, PC and the calibrated monitor accurately reflected the actual image.  Ran the program a second time after resetting monitor to factory default settings which is an important step.  Well satisfied with the product although the instructions for achieving a correctly calibrated monitor could be more precise.<br />I also found X-rite phone support to be outstanding, they answered my questions logically and correctly.
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|Loved this movie it.it Was very great from beginning too the end never boring need more movie like this k
B003TOH8AE|4.0|This movie has so many cute and funny scenes as well as some prety good action sceens it is great for 13 years and up would not recomend for preteen viewing
B0058UXHHK|4.0|This was a very nice book.  I found it very easy to read.  It was fun, enjoyable and entertaining.  There is a good mix of romance and suspense.
0385537131|5.0|I have been very critical of Grisham's last few books.  I felt that he had lost a lot of his insight and to be honest had gotten a little lazy in his endings.  May be to long a way from the practice of law and to much success.  However, Sycamore Row is excellent and a great read.  It was great to go back to see what had happen to Jake after the first book.  Little had change for his practice and that was not a surprise.  Small town practice is still small town practice.  The new characters are interesting, all though a little predictable at times. The big surprise at the end, was also predictable before the mid point of the book if you grew up in the south during this time.  Still a very good read.
0385743564|3.0|Okay filler book to read while waiting for Sanderson's other books to come out. The first two hundred pages are painful to get through but the ending makes it worthwhile. Not Sanderson's finest but still enjoyable.
B0034G4P80|5.0|This item was a gift on my sons list, I've not heard any complaints.  I'm thankful I could find it for a reasonable price and the seller was prompt in shipping it.
B00DKY4LBW|3.0|I enjoy their other albums more. This is their most pop sounding album yet. It sounds good but wares on you really quickly.
B005LAIIMG|1.0|As soon as the word came down that Brad Pitt's production company, Plan B, outbid Leonardo DiCaprio's<br />production company for film rights to Max Brooks' utterly superb zombie novel, World War Z, I knew this film was doomed.<br />Furthermore, when word came down that the film wasn't going to follow the format of the book, any lingering<br />hope I had that this film might even be mediocre was squashed.  And I was right.  What a monumental<br />disappointment this film is in every way, beginning with the company that secured the film rights all the way to the end<br />of the movie.  I know Max Brooks probably got a very nice check from this movie deal, but I'm willing to bet he's<br />shed a tear or two over how the film turned out.  Pitt's stale acting, the incohesive and contrived storyline, and the<br />lack of character chemistry make for a very unnerving viewing experience, particularly for those of us who loved<br />Brooks' novel.  If you really want to experience World War Z, and are willing to forego watching the movie, really your<br />best option is to read the book.  The book is not only a hallmark within zombie literature, but it's also a great read<br />regardless if you're interested in this genre.  In other words, skip this dud of a movie and go right to the novel.  And<br />then if you want to see the movie, do so.  And you'll more than likely agree with my review.....
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I absolutely love to discover new authors and new books. I scrolled past this book on Amazon and it just caught my eye. I had been waiting for so long, disappointed by so many other hopeful books. But Wool delivered in a way I could not have expected.<br />Fantastic story-telling, great character development, and a fun plot twist. I can't wait to dive into the next book in the series.
B00CATSONE|5.0|This reading rekindled my learning that every problem is a new opportunity and that your ship will not come in unless you swim out to meet it; and lastly, 100% of all opportunity will be lost if you do not take a chance.. I will my friends about this book.
B00EMAGCJM|3.0|The album is not as bad as  you might think. There are some meh or bad songs sure, but not all of them are bad. \\"Wrecking Ball\\" is pretty good, \\"4X4\\" and \\"Do My Thang\\" are some of the other highlights, and a surprise sweet sounding song \\"Rooting For My Baby\\" salvage this album quite a bit. Now I am not a big fan of \\"We Can't Stop\\" the video nor the song, the lyrics are just kind of messed up and that song seems more about twerking and is riddled with horrible messages for the audience that would listen to the song.<br /><br />But the songs mentioned are worth listening to if you are a fan of Miley Cyrus or the genre in general, better than a lot of other songs in the mainstream music industry. The other songs are mainly forgettable and focus too heavily on high pitched vocals and sound too much like every other pop song released in the past two or three years. It's not terrible, it's ok. Is it good? Of course not. So probably not worth buying since there's quite a few duds and there are some bad tracks but overall it has an average to slightly below average feel to it with some notable highlights.
B00FXES5WS|5.0|I love this new Christmas album by the wonderfully talented Susan Boyle! It's an instant classic album that deserves recognition and high praise; Susan sounds great on every track. Indeed, there's not a bad song in the lot here and that's grand. \\"Oh Come, All Ye Faithful\\" is a duet with Elvis that couldn't have been done any better; as always, I am impressed with Susan's excellent diction, her keen sense of timing and sophisticated phrasing. \\"The Lord's Prayer\\" is simply beautiful; I could never tire of hearing Susan do this flawlessly and I also really like \\"Little Drummer Boy;\\" the classic (and a personal favorite of mine) \\"I'll Be Home for Christmas\\" with that lush musical arrangement; \\"When a Child Is Born\\" with Johnny Mathis and they sing from the heart so well together; her stunning rendition of \\"The Christmas Song;\\" \\"I Believe in Father Christmas\\" that sounds so good; \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" that was first sung by Judy Garland in the MGM film \\"Meet Me in St. Louis;\\" \\"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing\\" with that beautiful accompaniment; \\"The Christmas Waltz\\" which is also a favorite of mine and so easy on the ear; \\"In the Bleak Midwinter\\" that is new to me but will be another of my very favorites from here on in and the last track, `Miracle Hymn\\" which was written for The Christmas Candle motion picture coming out on November 22 - and look for Susan in her film debut in that movie playing the role of Eleanor Hopewell!<br /><br />This CD is a must-have for any fan of Susan Boyle as well as anyone who appreciates superlative Christmastime music. This will be enjoyed by many, many people for years to come!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|although i thought it started a tad bit slow, this book quickly picked up pace and i found myself not wanting to put it down. on the flip side, i also didn't want to read it so fast because then it would be over too quick!! but that's the case with a lot of really good books!
030758836X|5.0|I am still reading it and am continually surprised. The story twists and turns. I can't wait to see how it ends.  The writing is excellent and the story is compelling.  I definitely recommend it!
B000JMKQX0|3.0|i really liked the premise of this book but i found that the way it was written was confusing to me. every time a new chapter started it was someone new speaking. also, in my opinion, it just wasn't that exciting or interesting. i'm sure others may disagree but everybody's different, lol!
B000QRIGLC|4.0|Real, raw, even funny at time. The actual battle his a bit short, but a good description of seal training
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|at first i wasn't going to read this because i figured it would just be a very depressing read. i mean, it's about 2 teenagers battling cancer. but i'm actually glad i did because it was really well written and had a lot of unexpected humor in it. and i just loved the main characters!
030758836X|4.0|This was my 2nd Gillian Flynn experience; the first was Sharp Objects. I agree with other reviews that had started to wonder where the book was going when they got part 2 and WOW! I enjoyed the book as a whole very much, but was dissapointed in the ending. So many twists, so many fascinating characters, well written. Just a ho-hum of an ending...but at the same time, sad & scary.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very addictive game at first and with periodic updates which includes new or redesigned boards make this title fun and fresh!!
1250038820|4.0|it is so interesting - everyone passes by and picks it up, and just keep flipping through the photos - they are all so telling - its a wonderful book and would make a great gift to any New Yorker
B00G32TD98|5.0|Unbelievable true story.  Well done, kept you glued to your seat!!  It made me look on Wikipedia for more info, very good!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is just perfect for my home and work.  I have set it to much which gently wakes me.  Only the second app I have that deserves 5 stars.
1250030951|5.0|I loved Fangirl. It was better than great. It was fantastic and poignant. Endearing and smart. Touching and sweet. Fangirl tells a tale that most of us can relate to on some level (er, some of us more than others). Dealing with insecurities. Facing fears. Coping with disappointment. Escaping reality. Being used. Being abandoned. Being accepted. Being loved...Few books have touched my heart--my soul--the way Fangirl did. As I read it, I could feel Cath's misery, her anxiety, her uncertainty. She was more than just a character on a piece of paper. She was a friend. She was a sister. She was me, back when I was an awkward freshman that felt lost and terrified of leaving my comfortable present for an unknown (and uncomfortable) future.<br /><br />\\"It's okay if you're crazy,\\" he said softly.<br />\\"You don't even know-\\"<br />\\"I don't have to know,\\" he said. \\"I'm rooting for you.\\"<br /><br />Of course I loved the entire Simon Snow aspect of the book, too. Not only did it add dimension to Cath's story and make it even more endearing, but the excerpts themselves were genuinely entertaining. In fact, during the longer Simon and Baz snippets, I'd forget I was even reading Fangirl. I'd get so lost in Simon Snow's Harry Potter-esque world, that it would take me a moment to re-acclimate to Cath's less than fantastical reality (and I'm saying that in the most positive, I-love-this-book kind of way).<br /><br />If you're looking for a story that's a perfect combination of funny and serious, and has a dash of fantasy to it, this is it!<br /><br />\\"Don't make me angry-kiss you.\\"<br />\\"Give me the laundry.\\"<br />\\"Tempers rising, faces flushed...This is how it happens.\\"
B000001F95|5.0|I first heard this album about 24 years ago.  I have always been a Mark Knopfler fan and a Scottish/Irish/Celtic music fan.  The music on this CD is so peaceful and when I close my eyes I feel as though I am there.  My husband can always tell when I am a bit stressed when he hears me playing this CD.  The last cut totally transports me.
0451232852|5.0|Let me start out by saying I'm not a huge fan of historical fiction. But this one was awesome! Fall of Giants kept me hooked from page one all the way to page 960! Yes, like Follet's other epic reads, most notably The Pillars of the Earth, this tale was a doozy. But I couldn't put it down! In fact, I unthinkingly started it right before I was set to leave for a week-long beach vacation. Since I don't own a tablet or e-book reader, I made the difficult decision to leave the two-ton book behind and take a couple others that were lighter and easier to transport. Well, as I was walking out the front door to head to the airport, I realized I couldn't bear the thought of leaving Fall of Giants at home--I swear, it was looking at me like a sad puppy whimpering, \\"Don't leave me, don't leave me\\". So, I hastily stuffed it in my bag and shouldered the extra weight. And I don't regret my decision at all...Except for accidentally getting sand and saltwater all over it. Then again, I spilled coffee on it a week later too, so :-(...Poor \\"puppy\\".<br /><br />Let's just say Fall of Giants is a well loved book in my household now! And it should be loved in yours too!
B00000JNNY|5.0|Who cannot like her music.  I have about 6 of her CD's.  All of the my favorites of her.  My biggest regret is that she never came to the Southeast for a concert and I could not afford to go to San Francisco to see her.
B000HAB4KS|5.0|Love the movie. It was truly ground breaking both in the story and in the special effects. The story moves well and the cast really had good chemistry.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Awesome game, fast paced and addictive. Great graphics. Only reason I put it down is to work and sleep. Everyone should try it.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I absolutely LOVED the first two books, but this one was a complete letdown! Don't waste your money or emotions on this one!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This is a wonderfully creepy book!  Jacob's grandfather had shown him photographs of the peculiar children that he lived with in a children's home during WWII.  He told Jacob that the children had unusual abilities - such as the ability to levitate or be invisible, and that they had lived on a beautiful island protected by a hawk who smoked a pipe.  When Jacob grew older, he no longer believed his grandfather's stories about the peculiar children and the horrible monsters that were after him.  Until, when he was 16 years old, his grandfather died and Jacob saw the monster who killed him.<br />  After going through therapy, and after finding a mysterious letter that had belonged to his grandfather, and with the encouragement of his therapist, Jacob goes to the island off of Wales where his grandfather had lived in the children's home.  His father goes with him to observe and write about the birds that live on the island.  There, Jacob learns who and what he is, travels in time and fights the monsters as well.<br />  This story is illustrated with authentic vintage photographs, which is an unusual and fascinating way to write a story.  The story is a fantasy with mystery, suspense and intrigue.<br /> I totally enjoyed it, and highly recommend it.
B00ESB6GBY|5.0|One of my favorite shows of all time. I have watched the first 8 seasons at least 3 times each and will probably do the same with this season. A must watch.
006202406X|5.0|My daughter loves it. She read the other 2 in the set and said this one is the best of the three.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Read this novel after having finished Gone Girl.  Both books are great although Gone Girl was more chilling.  Definitely a great book and great author.
140191716X|5.0|THIS IS A BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN BOOK BY DOREEN VIRTUE. IF YOU BELIEVE IN ANGEL'S IT A MUST TO HAVE!!! AND GIVE AS A GIFT AS WELL!
B007THA4FI|5.0|I read this book more than 6 weeks ago and I still think of the characters.  The story resonates and sticks with you.
B005KJZDXK|4.0|It's great I love her voice ! It's kind of retro to me but good .have a merry Christmas all !
B006LSZECO|5.0|Twists and turns.  You will find yourself flip-flopping alliances with the two main characters.  Hopefully you have carved out enough hours in your schedule to read it in one sitting.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This book kept me in suspense and always questioning what in the heck was going to be happening next.<br /><br />I was so nervous for the hero and worried he was in big trouble.
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|The plot was okay but the storyline predictable.  I purchased it because of the number of stars it received and I was disappointed because typically the reviews match the quality of the novel.
B00DYZ2YVG|4.0|Like a lot of the other reviewers, I really enjoyed that the story was set in Wales. Pardon the pun, but zombie stories have been done to death. But the setting change, and Rogers' deft handling of the material, made this a fun and exciting read. Rogers' version of zombies were created when a military experiment went awry, and the zombies are of two kinds - the more traditional, slow-moving variety and their faster, more aggressive cousins, ala &#34;World War Z.&#34; The protagonist, Daniel, is both likable and tragic, and his actions in the story make sense given the tragedy he's suffered. The Undead Valleys: The Welsh Aftermath is definitely a credible, fun, and exciting addition to the ranks of zombie novels.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|does what its supposed to do. limited adds. easy to use. a well made app, though downloading the stopwatch seperately is annoying.
B007DIQC90|5.0|This is an amazing band!  They write such great lyrics!  The two vocalists harmonize so well.  Their music is a joy to listen to.  They are using the song, &#34;Dirty Paws,&#34; for the new movie, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty with Ben Stiller.  I can't wait to see the film.  Enjoy this album.  Cheers!
B007NQLK3K|4.0|My son loved it. A perfect gift for a Revoltech figures fan. Sure will buy more of them. Ok! .
B00B2V66VS|2.0|It is ok it is just that if you get used to games like subway surfers where you move with your finger in the lanes, it gets confusing. I did not really like this game it is boring
B002SSUQFG|4.0|Well made watch, slightly smaller than I had imagined it, but its well designed, light weight, and easy to read.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|In some ways,  this was not the ending that I had hoped for, but really it was what was needed. I was a little  sad at the ending but glad to see that each of the characters stayed true to themselves.  Unlike the ending of Hunger Games, which gave a tidy but sloppy ending that really skimped on details, Roth gave us a believable ending: she provided closure and even hope.  Well done!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book honestly changed my view on life. It showed that even kids dying of cancer were able to make the most of their situation and have a human experience of love, tears, and adventure. John Green is an amazing writer and I cannot wait for the movie!! :) this book is a must read
193355021X|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book even though I did not find any new information.  But it is always good to go back to a refresher course.  I prefer reading any of Ron Paul's books.
0920668364|5.0|I just love this book, and I often give it a a baby gift.  I read it all the time.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I wasn't ure I was going to like this book.  It was rather confusing, with the move between the scenario with the husban and the wife, but it was fantastic.  Well worth the read, so I bought hs next book.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|The premise of the book was good, unfortunately I knew where it was going about half way through it. I love the characters and A Time To Kill was one of my favorites by Mr. Grisham, just wish it was more suspenseful. I would recommend it as a good quick read.
0385537131|4.0|I hate to give John Grisham's book less than 5, but for this book I have to. The book starts off with a nail-biting start and ends with a superb ending. The middle was so boring and dragging, I kept asking myself when will it end. I have read almost all of Grisham's novel and I will certainly not rate this in the top. Some novels keeps you at the edge of the seat permanently. For almost 80% of the book, the book feels like an internal family affair, so I had hard time trying to comprehend its validity to the bigger picture. Things really change in last 10 chapters.<br /><br />As others have mentions no relation to Time to Kill though there are lot of characters who are common - starting with Jake Brigance. Jake is a nice lawyer though I doubt in real life any Jake exists in whole of America. Seth Hubbardand his brother Ancil Hubbard play a crucial role. There are other family members who are vital, but I will not go not them in the risk of spoiling the plot. Lettie Lang plays wonderfully along with her daughter Portia. Judge Reuben Atlee has been portrayed magnificently. There are other very crucial characters whom I will not even go into details.<br /><br />The middle portion of the book becomes very boring, The character of Simeon Lang, his car crash that killed Roston Brothers - Kyle and Bo all are fillers to make the book longer. Granted, these incidents have high morals that Grisham tries to get across (again in real life I highly doubt anybody will act like Roston parent). Apart from the mid portion, which you can safely ignore and continue to understand story, Grisham has proved to be a master story teller.<br /><br />If you want to really enjoy the book get the CD version. The dramatic explanations and rendering are fabulous. I wonder why Grisham wrote this novel now and it is set in 1980s. Agreed this set in same Ford county as Time to Kill and happens 3 years after that. But feels so out of other Grisham novels which are usually set in same time as he writes them. I really wonder if he wrote both Time to Kill and Sycamore Row at the same time and decided to publish this after 25 years!es them. I really wonder if he wrote both Time to Kill and Sycamore Row at the same time and decided to publish this after 25 years!
B0073COMUW|5.0|These are very bright white light bulbs. They provide better light in my opinion than cfl bulbs and use less electricity
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I felt that Veronica shined a huge spotlight on how much truth and growth Tris and those who interacted with her experienced and achieved at the end of Allegiant and I applaud her for it. Although devastatingly heartbreaking, I felt the book couldn't have ended in any other way. It was poetic, and beautiful. I ached for Four more than I was sad for Tris because she wasn't just noble and brave, she was honorable and extraordinary; she ensured a new life-path for all those she loved and even those she didn't love.<br /><br />She also had such an impact through her actions, thoughts, and words towards those around her that they didn't need to be Divergent to show they were capable of being what they thought they could not be as demonstrated by Four choosing not to take his Mother's memories away as well as Caleb's ability to even feel guilt for what he had done, then love towards his sister. That is her true legacy--her ability to affect those around her by her example and show them they were capable of making choices based on reasons other than genes, or faction standards.<br /><br />Thanks for writing your heart, Ms. Roth, and for weaving together such an awe inspiring story. I enjoyed every bit, even the hard bits because they were real, and morally inspiring.
006202406X|5.0|Unlike many readers, I found the ending crucial to character development. Perhaps because I am a male, I identified Four/Tobias as the key character who &#34;grew-up&#34; the most. Central to this, he met the greatest challenge in the death of Tris. Tobias dealt with many challenges (child abuse, alienation from his mother, avoiding Dauntless leader for fear of seeing his father, fear of heights, and most of all, the loss of Tris).<br /><br />I know that many fans expected a happy ending. I believe that the different reactions (I hate it/I love it) probably derive from what one desires from the story. Those who wanted a feel-good story (superficial but entertaining) were disappointed by Tris' death, but I saw it as a return to her selfless faction and crucial to Tobias' growth into adulthood.<br /><br />I very much hope that a film is made from this book, but I fear that the ending will be changed to appeal to higher ticket sales. I cite as a precedent the film adaptation of Thomas Harris' novel, Hannibal. The novel had Lecter and Starling become lovers at the end (with a totally different character development of Clarice). However, Hollywood was afraid that movie goers would want a &#34;happy ending&#34; (Clarice is still a heroine).
B008602KQI|5.0|I was prepared to not like these books, feeling that they would be too juvenile.  My gran daughters recommended them to me.  I was hooked in the first few pages!  I have read them twice now and will likely read again at some time in the future.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|Awesome action from beginning to the end.  I like the story and dialog behind the movie.  Tom Cruise, Rose Pike, and Robert DuVall do it!  Excellent supporting actors through out
1451639155|5.0|This is another installment of great series  by a great author. I introduced this series to non-science fiction readers and they also agree that Bujold can really write.
B00D2MC8WG|5.0|What a pleasure when a performance comes across so well. I really appreciated the sense of enthusiasm that seems to go throughout this performance.<br /> The classics should live like this forever.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Funny as hell and extremely entertaining!!!  I love her work and words. Always a surprise and makes me laugh to tears!!
B004LFO0ME|4.0|Good album.  Good flow.  Fresh beats.  So much better than Deal or No Deal.<br /><br />Looking forward to his next album.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I love falling skies can not wait for next season! I really makes me think about a lot of things.
B00ECL7ZJ2|5.0|Strong work girls. Love the album.<br /><br />It's pop, it's rock album, and it's awesome. If you think John Mayer is good, you don't deserve to listen to Haim. . .but buy it anyway, to support these chicas.
B002HWRYJE|1.0|This movie took God's name in vain.  Any movie we come across that does that we put it in the trash!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I have read many Grisham books.  This one is good, but not great.  However, the ending was intriguing and eventful.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|pretty fun, cool graphics, but a bit slow to start. compared to other similar games. definately is worth it though.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad Amazon brought this App to Kindle !  Beautiful graphics ! Thanks! I knew it'll would be fun on Kindle  and it is ! Glad I could bring my progress from my phone through Facebook !
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is an awesome book that ALL middle schoolers, soon to be middle schoolers, middle school teachers, anyone who has been to middle school...you get the idea... should read. It restores faith in human KINDness. I love the characters and how the story is so artfully told from so many perspectives.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|You never kill off your protagonist. Period. :-(<br />I understand the beauty, bravery and complexity in her final moments, but save that stuff for real life. Don't leave behind poor Tobias!
0486406482|5.0|I've seen the movie many times but never ventured to read the book. Thoroughly enjoy her writing style. So great to finally read the book! I
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Nice hunting game for Your spare time. Not very realistic but fun.<br />Especially the wolfes are not so easy kills.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I truly found this guide helpful. I often wondered how to incorporate a functional table of contents--this guide makes it sound so simple.  I will definitely follow these steps to achieve professional-looking manuscripts.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|THANK YOU!!!!! I love this game and to have it available for the Kindle is great! It plays great!<br /><br />Works great!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was amazing and i could not put it down for the life of me. I read from chapter ten at 10 at night to the last word at 2 in the morning.  I would recommend this  book to anyone especially if you have ever lost a loved one.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I didn't think I would like this game ... but I can't put it down ... somebody help me<br />..... a must get game ...
B0062YADWI|5.0|Easy to carry, do manual work is good, very practical, very good, I like, is a lot cheaper than domestic. Worth buying,
B00FH3Z91A|2.0|Pros:<br />sleek and comfortable to hold.<br />Fits well inside pocket.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />The Section that holds phone in place is peeling off! It appears the glue material used is not very strong. Considering the price I would think the material should be better bond together. I am afraid the phone will fly off once the glue completely peels off.
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|This movie was so bad, that I wanted to quit after 20 minutes. My husband thought it might improve and wanted to see it through to the end. After it was over, he agreed it was a waste of time. I like Will Smith as an actor and have enjoyed several of his movies. This is a bona fide dog.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Just cause we are on Kindle doesn't mean we shouldn't be able to uodate. Why can't I update my facebook every one else is??!!??
B004UNX1LS|4.0|I love the quality but the screen is so tiny and is there a way to make it full screen?other than that it is great
B00G6Q29KQ|5.0|This is a classic tale of good overcoming evil. It's an adventurous story which will really get your imagination going with the author's mind expanding ideas. Super soldiers, remote viewing, astral travel, metaphysical dimensions, re-incarnation and the nature of reality. Lots of food for thought. A well written and entertaining read.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I get why people are upset by the ending, but I have nothing but respect for an author that stays true to her characters. The ending for me was the only ending there could have been if you really think about this story. It's not a lollipops and rainbows storyline. It's nitty gritty and much more realistic to human nature IMO. Overall was a good read and I'm glad to wrap this series this way.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It would be nice to stream content from local (network atached) storage. But besides that it's a verry nice device.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I was looking something like this, this product is excellent, very small, very fast and works perfect, this can be used outside of the US with the services available (Netflix and Youtube), i definitely recommend this product.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Well written and engrossing book.  Not a hard read but Card draws the reader in quickly and keeps them.  Would recommend to anyone who likes this genre.
B005OZE9SA|5.0|Technology marches onwards, and this product gives individuals the opportunity to make studio-quality recordings at a budget price. My impressions of this unit are as follows:<br /><br />The unit's preamps seem to be pretty quiet.<br /><br />The build quality is very good (this one is designed in the UK but made in China).<br /><br />The XLR input volume knobs feel quite nice, but the other controls feel a little cheaper. You can see the rough edges on the two silver knobs's plastic, but I see the same quality of knob on other USB interfaces, so no big deal.<br /><br />The USB cable on my first unit seemed to give me data errors, so I used a USB2.0 printer cable with thick grounding braid and two ferrite filters. Problem solved.<br /><br />It works with my Vista 32 bit laptop (only 1.8 gig, and an SSD), and Win 7 64bit desktop. I use the maximum 10 ms buffer, so that I don't get any bugs in Reaper.<br /><br />The first unit I tried had an intermittent soft buzzing sound coming from the right channel, which didn't respond to interchanging left and right xlr cables, or switching computers. Hence, I returned it and got another one, which seems fine. You have to turn up the recording gain on the 2i2 and listen to the background hiss to hear it most easily. You don't have to record something first, as you can just monitor the mics through the headphone jack.<br /><br />The sound quality is very nice. Clean and clear, and not brittle. It doesn't have that metallic harshness of cheap stereo gear, for instance. For $150, you're talking studio-quality sound for the masses. Couple this with some world-class inexpensive mics like the Little Blondie and a lot of pros may be jealous that regular folk can compete with them.<br /><br />I recorded at 44.1, 48, 88.2 and 96 khz in stereo with two mics and Reaper and directly rendered all four recordings at the Extreme setting to a CD. The real key test is sound quality, and my findings are:<br /><br />all 4 settings - the have the same basic timbre of sound.<br /><br />44.1 khz - the high frequencies are not that focused. This is a very common finding to me, since a chief complaint about CDs is that the highs are unfocused, compared with the same LP (this is why some people like their old LPs). It's very smooth sounding, though.<br /><br />48 khz - sounds slightly more focused than 44.1 khz, albeit a little less smooth, not surprising since the math to go from 48 to 44.1 is messy; 48 doesn't divide to 44.1 very well. It may be that the increased distortion makes your ear localize the distortion more.<br /><br />88.2 khz - the highs are more focused now, the sound is more lifelike. It's as smooth as 44.1, and more smooth than 48 khz therefore.<br /><br />96 khz - the midrange and highs seem more focused compared with 88 khz. Voices seem well localized in space, very lifelike. However, it's less smooth sounding that 88.2 khz. My guess is that the SRC (sample rate conversion) isn't perfect, probably because 96 doesn't divide into 44.1 well, and neither does 48 to 44.1, and some artifacts remain because the math isn't perfect (just like halving a 963 x 374 jpeg results in some jaggedness because of the rounding errors.<br /><br />Since I find that most commercial CDs are quite harsh, I think I might record at 88.2 to maximize smoothness, but if imaging is more important, I may do 96.<br /><br />The unit doesn't seem to burn much electricity from USB. My laptop normally will run 6 hours on a charge; connecting the 2i2 makes it 5 hours, long enough to take everything into the field for a recording without a power cord. Now that's convenient!<br /><br />Update: I have also just bought the 2i4, since their output RCA jacks can be plugged into a stereo amp and out to speakers. This is what I do currently with my desktop, where the motherboard line out is connected to the amp. You would select the 2i4 as the output in the Sound settings in Control Panel of Windows. Unlike the mono direct monitoring of the input with zero latency in the 2i2, you get stereo sound in direct monitoring with the 2i4.<br /><br />Tech support told me the current draw of the two units is about the same, about 480 mA if memory serves. This is in line with competing USB interfaces.<br /><br />When I plug my laptop into the wall outlet, there is some static noise in the preamps, but their level is slightly below the noise floor of the mics (a quick check is to plug in the mic cables but not the mics, and then listen to the preamp). When I tried a more expensive competitor's USB interface, there was tremendous such static noise, to the extent that the interface wasn't usable. But when I unplugged the laptop and went with battery power, the static on the Focusrite units subsided (I didn't get a chance to test it on the more expensive competitor). Hence, the cleanliness of the power to the USB when on laptop wall outlet power seems to be important, so I will sure to bring my USB interface when I am deciding on buying a new laptop.<br /><br />All in all, I'm happy with my purchases. You should be too! Cheers!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|This will contain spoilers!<br /><br />I read 'Divergent' and 'Insurgent' in a day each.  I reread them as soon as 'Allegiant' was released and, again, could not put them down!!  I sped right through them.  Each of them earned a 5 star review from me.  I was so excited to read the finale of this trilogy.  It ended up taking me several days to read because I was just BORED.  I found myself putting it down and finding other things to do when I would have had time to read.<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br /><br />1.  I did not like the POV switching.  After writing the first two books in the same format, it just didn't flow right to change things up.  I understood why VR did it that way, but it just didn't work.<br /><br />2.  While we all hope for a happy ending, we all knew that was probably not going to happen with the way Tris lived her life.  I don't take issue with the fact that it ended the way it did, just HOW it ended.  There were so many alternatives to the ending that VR could have chosen though.  It seemed so abrupt, weak, and disappointing.<br /><br />3.  Character building just wasn't there.  Tobias did develop closer to the end of this novel, but most of the book, he was just so monotonous.  Tris ended the book pretty much the way she started.  There was no build in her, it's like VR had already brought her to the peak in the previous two books and didn't know what to do with her in this one.  Both Tobias and Tris got so blah though, that when the POV's changed, sometimes it took me several paragraphs to realize it changed.  Yes, I know it says it right at the beginning of the chapter, but I'm usually eager to get to the text so I skip over chapter titles.<br /><br />4.  How did Caleb never offer a reason for allowing Tris to die other than Jeanine was persuasive?  Yet Tris forgave him like that?  Caleb shouldn't have even been in the book the way she used him, he was just a completely pointless character.  Most of the characters appeared &#34;dumbed down&#34; in this book and David was a pretty pathetic villain.  He is not the one that made sense for the role at the end of this book.<br /><br />Veronica Roth, you are so much better than this!  Your first two books proved that!  Time, building, and editing could have made this another amazing novel.  Instead it was a whip together to please the public with a deadline.  I was incredibly excited for the movie to come out, and now I have zero interest in it.n this book and David was a pretty pathetic villain.

B00FAPF5U0|2.0|The game is extremely repetitive, should have other things to do in the game. When one gets stuck on a level should have other ways out not just same old same old.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Used to enjoy this better before. Takes a lot of coins to keep up with powerups and keys. Freezes a lot on my kindle fire hd.

B001NLKZUA|5.0|Cassandra Clare`s character development is superb. She has<br />the reader choosing weapons and fighting alongside the Clave in an epic confrontation with some extremely nasty villains from the underworld and even a few from above. This is a wonderful series that's written exceptionally well. It`'ll keep you wondering what will happen next and if Clary, Jace, Simon, Isabelle and Alec will make it out alive!
1594203334|5.0|I have read this 3 times I enjoy it so much! Some great tidbits and tips about how the French parent, many of which really work!  Bonus, a funny and mostly relatable story by Ms. Druckerman of her own experiences.
B005LAIIGW|5.0|In all honesty, I am NOT a fan of Sandra Bullock, don't even know if I spelled her name right just now, honestly I don't care.<br /><br />But this movie was absolutely fantastic. In IMAX it was terrifying to watch, putting myself in the position of Bullock, I could feel my heart stop. ANYONE who says this movie was a bore is either VERY unimaginative or just didn't want to see it in the first place. With a few passes of all the debris and one massive escape scene, this film has no lack of action or suspense either. The viewer gets a 10-15 second head start warning that the debris is about to his due to a musical build up that makes your blood run cold. Taking the blackness of space to a whole new type of black; fear.<br /><br />My ONE problem with this movie was the scientific flaws. Most of which I didn't notice until the second time I saw it. Such as the fact that the sun is actually white in space.
B0026IUXME|5.0|I first saw \\"The Pianist\\" when it came out in the movie theaters more than a decade ago. It remains one of the top films that I have seen, and is certainly one of the best Holocaust films of all times for a variety of reasons.<br /><br />First of all, the acting itself is suburb. Adrien Brody does a superb job of portraying Wladyslaw Szpilman, an acclaimed Jewish pianist, who is separated from his family (most of whom are sent to the concentration camps and eventually death) and who somehow survives by hiding in an abandoned building. Near starvation, he is discovered by a Nazi officer who befriends him and provides him with food until the near the end of the war.<br /><br />Second, the storyline is compelling. Although one cannot view the movie without becoming both depressed and distressed at the inhuman cruelty inflicted on the Jews during the Holocaust, one is encouraged by the indomitable human spirit displayed by Szpilman, as well as by the Nazi officer who, despite his status, has enough human decency left to befriend him.<br /><br />Third, although the movie contains violence (a film that must deal with the Holocaust cannot avoid showing violence without ceasing to be realistic), the violence is not gratuitous. Although there are some scenes that are difficult to watch, the violence is not so prominent or overwhelming as to detract from the story itself.<br /><br />Finally, at no point does the movie drag. I found my attention totally riveted on the screen for the entire two and a half hours.
B008JEJLVS|5.0|the crocs website says to order a size smaller for people who wear a 1/2 size.  Not on the sports duet.. order the size larger .<br />e.g. I wear a 10 1/2 and got the 11 and they fit perfectly.  These are the best crocs ever.  Baby tanks for your feet.  It's a shame crocs don't make the sports duet anymore..  probably too expensive to mfg.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|Ioan Gruffudd does an excellent job of portraying William Wilberforce, the British MP who spent much of his lifetime fighting against the British participation in the slave trade. Add to this excellent supporting acting by Albert Finney as John Newton (writer of the lyrics of \\"Amazing Grace\\"), the former slave trader who, upon his conversion, became a pastor and a staunch opponent of slavery, and one has the makings of a truly memorable movie.<br /><br />But what makes \\"Amazing Grace\\" an outstanding movie is the compelling and true story it tells of Wilberforce, a man whose strong and abiding faith in the sovereignty of God gave him the strength to persevere against all odds and against the many special interests, both within and outside of Parliament, that profited from the slave trade. Very occasionally someone comes along whose singleminded devotion to a cause is as great and persevering as was that of Wilberforce. We can be thankful for his life and for the fact that it was made into a movie so that today's generations can witness a true profile in courage.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Very nifty item. Took it on a trip and was never in the way when charging the headset. Great for travel and easy to use.

B006UKFFE0|5.0|Running Lean is the best your &#34;first step&#34; to making a successful startup - it's full of simple but systhematic steps aligned into powerful approach that allows you to get new, unexpected but very important results very quickly.<br /><br />If you're reading anything else and struggling to apply it to your project - just delay it and start reading and practicing Running Lean. It will give you both real project results and practical experience that will help to understand and apply other, more sophisitacted books like &#34;Startup Owner's Manual&#34;, &#34;Lean Startup&#34; or &#34;Entrepreneur's Guid to Customer Development&#34;.<br /><br />Especially if you have read &#34;Lean Startup&#34; and now are struggling to apply it in your project (or are thinking that you really apply it) - just try using &#34;Runnig Lean&#34;, and you will get much better results.
B00B89LZ4C|5.0|I LOVE this action figure of Walter White \\"Heisenberg\\".  Body parts don't move, but who cares.  It's still awesome!  It comes with the signature accessories that include a bag of money, a bag of blue meth and the dark sunglasses and hat which are both removable.  Now I only wish they made an action figure of Jesse Pinkman too.  That would be totally awesome.  This is a must have for all Breaking Bad fans.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|I liked a lot the idea of the book - that a copy, a forge can be truer than the original; not because the original lacked virtues, but because those virtues got lost on the road of life. Is hindsight better? Sanderson leaves us the image of a teary old man throwing into flames a true work of art.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Fun game. Just wish it were easier to obtain acorns for the big items. I don't plan on spending money to buy more.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. It is extremely addictive. Also, becomes difficult to complete levels. Only thing I wish, is that you could earn more extra lollipops.

B001383XT8|5.0|So i'll preface this by saying I'm a beginning guitarist and not very knowledgeable about the differences between brands concerning pedals. With this in mind, I'd like to say this this pedal works excellently; it provides very good distortion effects and is very easy to set up and use. On a personal note, I started guitar to learn to play metal, and if that's your goal then this is the pedal for you. I ordered this pedal with a pedal board which was a good decision because the pedal doesn't come with any cords or a power supply, just the pedal itself and instructions. All in all a great pedal for a great price and shipping was pretty fast too.

B00FXEL00W|5.0|OMG... I adore this book.  It's a very light hearted romance story.  I really liked all the characters in this story, especially Kendall & Payton.  Their attraction and chemistry was perfect.  I loved the humor in this book too, I found myself cracking up over & over.  Some of Kendall's thoughts were hilarious to me.  The story line was good.  The book was very well written.  It was an easy read & the story flowed smoothly.  I'm looking forward to what's next from this author.  Over all - I give this book two thumbs up and an easy 5 stars.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I have played a lot of match games &amp; this one is great. It is a lot of fun to build the village!!!!
B00AEFXNGE|5.0|One of the best movies I have ever seen. Most movies bore me to death, but not this one. Arrived on time and in perfect condition.
B002NNA9N0|5.0|With Al Pacino, Jack Lemon, Kevin Space, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, and Alex Baldwin, this movie has a cast that blows you away. The story of real estate salesmen trying to make a buck anyway they can, cajoling clients, fighting the company, personified by a truly menacing Alex Baldwin, fighting each other, and plotting to get ahead anyway they can makes for a very absorbing and emotionally exhausting experience. I would highly recommend it.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|This book is fantastic. Everyone should read it. It combines humor with realism and makes you relate intensely to the author.
B008U06TZW|4.0|used this monitor to extend the display on my laptop. the screen on this monitor gives a better picture than the one on my laptop and the 360 degree rotation did serve some purpose as well.

I followed all directions but it does not stand as the picture shows.  I now have to wait until my son comes to help me remove it from the case.  I like the color and I hope when it is reinstalled it will stand as pictured..  Thank you  Helen L. Caroll
B000MQC9H4|5.0|This is a funny holiday movie that is good for over 16 years.  I say that because I was going to show it to my 14 year old and thought she was too young.  But it is a great chic flick.

B001PPLJIQ|5.0|I saw this at the theater, and I really liked it as I am a fan of Kate Winslet.  It is a different style for her as an artist, but it is very good, and I wanted to add it to my collection.  Definitely for older children 18 and up.

B009R659L8|2.0|Kate Connelly lies in a coma after an explosion that burnt down her father's business, and many wonder if she's involved. Her sister Hannah tries to find answers, as does their father, who may or may not be completely innocent.<br />As with any Mary Higgins Clark novel, there are twists and turns, clues and red herrings. She's always good for a light read. DADDY'S GONE A HUNTING has so many minor characters and subplots, I found myself wondering how and if they tied together. In the end, I felt like she didn't have enough plot for the main characters and threw in some minor subplots and characters to lengthen the story.<br />I generally like MHC, though this isn't my favorite of hers.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A great story does not make a great book.  That takes characters so well crafted, that the reader can suspend reality to become part of what is enfolding on the pages before him.  Wool is such a creation.  Outstanding!
0790729369|5.0|I just absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie. I must have watched it a hundred times and I still cry. Will probably keep re-watching it until the disc wears out!!!
193413712X|4.0|I read two books at a time.  I tackle heavy stuff first thing in the morning when my brain is most receptive and lighter fare at night when I'm running at about 60% capacity.<br /><br />It may have been a mistake to consider \\"Tinkers\\" my light reading because it requires a rigorous attention, sentence by sentence focus and when I'm about to nod off that attention is completely missing.<br /><br />I preface all this because I was more than half way through the book feeling that I hadn't a clue what it was about or able to keep track of Howard or George.  Fortunately, I gathered up all my dwindling resources and read through to the ending with greater clarity and determination.  It paid off.  I appreciated the poetic flights, the description of how clocks work, the notion that life isn't lived in the summary but in its intense moments.<br /><br />Despite the Pulitzer and my admiration, I didn't love the book.  I grew to like it and the characters but I wanted it to affect me more deeply.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I love setting up my little town and planting my crops. I wish you could earn more energy faster, other than that this is a fun game that is appropriate for any age!
B004K4IZ54|1.0|I love this movie in dvd form. The blu-ray lacks color and is almost black and white. The controls to alter the color are locked out so to me this disk is s frisbee and I will not play it again. The digital disk won't play for me because I refused the cookies so this is another frisbee I won't play again. I guess in digital mode Disney hacks into your computer and wants your information. It's a real shame to pay such a big price for a Disney digital and blu-ray disc to not be able to use them. The moral of the story is DO NOT BUY DISNEY BLU-RAY OR DIGITAL DVD'S. I also hear that when you go to disneyland or disneyworld that they do facial recognition and take down all your personal information to add to big brothers database. I won't trust or use Disney products again.
B00DAPOHUQ|5.0|What more can you say about Jack Johnson's music. I have loved him for years and he doesn't disappoint!! LOVE!
B001BANK32|4.0|This overal a great novel, although it was set in the 70s, reading it in the year 2013 was completely OK<br />And now i've just bought Doctor Sleep :)
B003XT603Q|2.0|My husband and I travelled to Japan and wanting to read some contemporary fiction, I picked up this book in a Tokyo bookstore (the English section).  I wanted to like it because it sold so well in Japan and I was engrossed at first, but soon my excitement plummeted.  The book is weird and manipulative.  Hearing that the author fled to Europe and the U.S because he couldn't handle the fame, I wonder why he wrote the book and if he himself has psychological problems.  At times the prose is soaring, at other times it is clunky and flat.  I don't attribute this to the translation, as other reviewers have, but rather to the inability of the author to tell this story in a compelling way.  The protagonist inhabits a wacky world which has no real draw for me.  His love interest Naoko screams of pathological disease.  Why didn't he run from her to the nearest exit?  I don't like manipulative stories, this one is packed full (the sex scenes are especially gratuitous) and I'm resentful that the author took this approach.  I won't be reading anything else by Murakami.
B000021Y7X|5.0|Great stage performance, great effects, & great music. I'd reccomend it to anyone that could enjoy a good rock & roll show.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I've read a lot of dystopian literature, and at some point, the stories all begin to run together in one's mind.  I am so glad that a friend recommended the Wool Series because it's different.  It's a different perspective, a different type of story, a different (albeit scary) future from all the others.  Hugh Howey captures your attention from the very beginning, draws you into the characters, and keeps you guessing.  This series is definitely darker than some of the others I've read and, at times, heartwrenching, but definitely an enjoyable read.  I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys dystopian literature.  Can't wait to start part 6!
0061906220|5.0|We read this while listening to it being read on You Tube.  It's a cute book and can be useful in teaching colors.
B008JFUR10|4.0|This is a great action movie and the kids love it. Big robots, goofy looking monsters - what's not to love. The bonus features on the DVD though are a total let down. They would have been better just packaging the movie. The UltraViolet feature is nice. I downloaded it to my android phone and play it when were out and the kids are bored.
1449305172|5.0|The Lean Startup was a game-changer for approaching business planning and ideation, but it does not give context around how to approach real life problems.

B00B23O96A|4.0|This album varies in sound quality. And a couple of the tracks are very &#34;middle of the road&#34;!<br />But songs like &#34;All of me&#34; brings out the blues just like we want it.<br />Worth the Money!
B0000013G9|5.0|This is the quintessential TLC CD.  I can literally listen to every song on here without skipping.  I hope that younger people buy this CD so they can have a good sense of how great 90s R&B was.

B0047BXR1W|5.0|&#34;My Dog Skip&#34; is one of those movies you can watch again and again.  Brings back a lot of memories growing up in &#34;small town&#34; America, even though I grew up in California, my town was relatively small.  A lot of the scenes in the movie are very touching; and will tug at your heartstrings, especially if you had a dog growing up.  The child actors are amazing and very believable.  We had a little 8 year old girl from Ethiopia who came to our home for surgery; this was her FAVORITE movie and actually helped her to learn English.  She must have watched it 40 times in the year she was with us.  Good family movie that teaches a lot of good life lessons.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|This is a wonderful book. Gaimen was able to use many genres at once to craft a beautiful and prominent story.
B00D6QU6RW|1.0|I became a fan of the BSB when my niece dragged me to one of their concerts. She was too young to go alone and nobody else was willing.  Bam.  I became a fan.  But this record?  It doesn't even sound like them.  I don't know what happened here.  Did they change management? Arranger? Composers? Musicians? Singers.  It's really, really bad.  If you want to hear the BSB, this is not the purchase for you.

B00BWQW73E|5.0|I enjoyed this book, somewhat a biography of Bezos AND Amazon.<br /><br />this book is well written, and seems to be fair to all who are named - without sucking up to the Amazon team.<br /><br />Recommended
B00000K3G8|4.0|Have not seen the movie but wanted to check out this album anyway. I feel TH really only had two great albums, which are featured here (Remain in Light and Speaking in Tongues). Still, this is a fun album with nice interpretations. Also like the Tom Tom Club song included in the set.<br /><br />The Heads faded quickly--in my mind--after this album. So for me, this captures them at their peak. Enjoy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My husband hates this game because I can't stop playing it!  Thanks for finally offering it.<br />I highly recommend it.

0060589280|3.0|I've read other works by Coelho, and thought they contianed much more. Eleven minutes is an interesting story, but not written in a way that captured me. I don't know if it is the translation leaving something to be desired, but for me, it is lacking. I enjoyed The Pilgrimage much more. That had quotes that jumped off the page and caught my attention. Eleven Minutes did not endure itself to me.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I Hate my little pony I got my friend addicted to the game and now all she talks about is my little pony!!!!!!!! This game ruined my life !!!!!!!!!!!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Having lived my childhood and adolescence in the rural south, the dialogue and thoughts in this book are troubling and sadly familiar. This is a wonderful literary work that illustrates the emotion and politics of how attitudes from the 19th century affect life in the south for many, even to this day.<br /><br />Great work, realistic situations, a believable emotional roller coaster.
B00EJYGQFG|5.0|I enjoyed it very much. I'm a huge Lady Gaga fan. I feel her music is not only fun to listen to but also very meaningful.

B004AFFZNI|5.0|I ordered the skeleton housing for my GoPro Hero 2 so I can do dashcam videos and I ordered it through Amazon from &#34; 24SevenBargain&#34; and when I recieved the item it was in a brown box labeled as &#34;new skeleton housing&#34; and when I opened the box, it was just a regular watertight housing..not the skeleton one, apart from that..it looked as if it was used..had ton of scratches and I paid $37 for it.  What a mistake that was.<br /><br />I tried to return it to Amazon using their &#34;Return Center&#34; and it said I couldn't return that particular item...so I ended up contacting customer service, told them about the problem and they were glad to refund me and even pay to ship the wrong item back.<br /><br />I gave this 5 stars because it wasn't Amazon's fault and they helped me out.<br /><br />I ended up ordering the skeleton housing through GoPro and what do I know?  It was only $29.99.<br /><br />So words of advice..order through Amazon LLC. or through a reputable dealer.  I said this before and I still made the mistake..its hard to notice sometimes.

B0081336FO|5.0|True to the original character of Holmes with a modern twist and cynicism.  Holmes and Watson are extremely well played and the actors are the epitome of the characters.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I purchased this book with audio to listen to on a long road trip and the narration proved excellent.<br /><br />At the start of this story, the hero is in prison with plenty of time left on his sentence and the reader wonders how Grisham can make this interesting. Well, he does by using plenty of twists and turns, many of which you won't see coming. No character is painted completely good or bad, which keeps you guessing. Motives aren't always as straight forward as the first appear, either.<br /><br />I don't want to give too much away, but you will be pleasently surprised when you reach the end and find that what you thought the book was about, ain't necessarily so.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|Great condition. My 3 yr old loves it. Timely delivery and fairly priced. I appreciated the fact it has a DVD and a BLue-Ray. The BL we can play at home while the DVD will play in the car.

0385537131|5.0|John Grisham is back and even better then ever.  It is now more then three years since the Hailey trail and Carla, Hanna and Jake are living in a rented house since their house was burned down after the trial.  Money is not exactly flowing in and suddenly a letter and a will arrive and things get interesting.<br /><br />Seth Hubbard was diagnosed with lung cancer about a year ago and recently the doctor informed him he had less then a month to live and so he takes his life.  Jake gets a letter with instructions along with a will written by Mr. Hubbard with instructions to carry out his wishes.<br /><br />When the will is read it states that his children and grandchildren shall not receive anything and that the Church and his brother Ancil will each get five percent and the remaining ninety percent to go Lettie Lang (his black housekeeper for the past three years).<br /><br />All Jake is asked to do is carry out Seth's wishes but now his children want to challenge the will saying he was not competent when he wrote the will.<br /><br />All the same characters Rex, Ozzie Walls, Lucien and some of the others are back and involved in this case.  When Ramona and Herschel (his children) find out there is more then thirty two million dollars at stake they are about to prove the will not legal.  Now trouble is about to start.<br /><br />Mr. Grisham is at his best with surprises and secrets and lies that were never been revealed and that will surprise the attorney's on both sides.  It is a page-turner and a definite must read.
B00EQF2EIG|5.0|A wonderful adaptation brings out the best of Shakespeare, in a modern setting, with honest and engaging acting from all principals. Bravo!!
B004AHNIGM|5.0|Best new album since rap music .Or , I guess , Jerry Lee Lewis original collaboration ;(in my opinion).Pretty darn good .Excellent .Thought they didn't make them like this anymore .

B0031RAOVY|5.0|If you are looking for a great family movie, look no further.  I was surprised to find out how fantastic this movie was.
B003G4W49C|5.0|NO KIDDING, this is/was absolutely the single best fiction book I've read in more like 15 years.  The character s were flawless. The story development superb.  The quality of the editing was priceless too. Can't wait to watch the movie.  BUT, I know, I just know it couldn't possibly be better than what I read in a single seven hour marathon reading session.
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|I have several radio apps but I really enjoy this one...........I use it on my desk top as well as my tv (roku )..............it has a huge variety of genres & sub genres..........never any streaming problems either......and I love that its free :)  and most of all I love I can pick & choose what I like & don't like to create what I like to listen to :)
B005544V6A|5.0|I've only seen a few episodes but really enjoy the clever writing and story lines.  There is great character development, too.
B000AAJTL6|5.0|My kids love the movie and...they enjoy watching it on our car trips.  I know want to buy another PSP
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|Special Effects, is the only good thing I can say about this movie, and even then, it is only at par with what is coming out today, so no big deal.  These last 2 movies that came out on Star Trek should have been renamed: Testosterone Trek.  That is all this is.  They have taken everything that Gene Rodenberry wrote and used to originally create Star Trek, and pitched everything out the window!  There is no original thinking either, as they not only pitched everthing out, but then, resalvaged a few lines and roles, but reversed the roles and lines on different characters.  For example, we now have the same scene in Wrath of Khan where Spock saved the ship but died in the process, but now, the new and improved version of Star Trek, Kirk saves the ship, and dies in the process, and Spock fights to bring Kirk back to life.  Wow, can't get more original than that, but stay tuned, it will be Uhura's turn in the next movie.  And Khan, is not East Asian (with a name like Kahn Nunien Sing), but looks like a New York Manhattan executive, with a british accent, and asian eastern in name only.  I guess his name comes from a mixed (up) marriage.  What the hey!  They not only did not have original ideas, but the directors and producers had to really work hard and pull a lot of hair to find ways to twist existing plots and lines around to where the same plots and lines exist, but reverse the characters.<br /><br />To sum it all up, I will not go see the third movie when it comes out.  I may buy the dvd only if i can find it at the $1.00 bin at Wal Marts.  When I saw this one, I kept running to the bathroom thinking I was going to vommit.  They are so desparate to appeal to the younger generation and reel in the fast buck.  Well, if the younger generation is that ignorant of good and original stuff, then they can have it.  According to these last 2 movies, none of 'dudes' running the starship ever went through the academy.  They just all came together at one time, jumped on boardthe ship, and started running things.  Yeee Haaaahhh!
0143124544|5.0|Will and Louisa are an unlikely match. He comes from a sophisticated, wealthy family; she is a waitress from modest means living in a tiny house with her multi-generational family. He has traveled extensively, while she has rarely gone outside of the English village where she was born. He is educated, successful before the accident that left him a quadriplegic; she has few ambitions in her life.<br /><br />Regardless of their obvious differences, they fill a void in each other's lives. She, the only one who will let him make his own decisions. He, the person who can help her overcome her fears in order to live the life she is meant to live.<br /><br />In Lou's own words, they are, \\"Two people who shouldn't have met, and who didn't like each other when they did, but who found they were the only two people in the world who could possibly have understood each other.\\"<br /><br />Will changes Lou's life, and although she doesn't necessarily change his, she makes his life bearable. She brightens his days with her funky clothes and sarcastic sense of humor. She is able to look beyond his bitterness where she catches glimpses of the amazing man he was in his former life.<br /><br />As I was reading Me Before You, I tried to put myself in Will's place. I'm convinced I would go insane without the use of my arms and legs. Can you imagine not being able to feed yourself or scratch your own nose? Can you imagine what it would be like to be a burden to your family, day in and day out? In my mind, Me Before You ends the only way it can, but not before making a profound impact on my life.<br /><br />A great discussion book for book clubs. A 5-star no-brainer for me.

B00DB624GS|5.0|One thing that can be said about the Peter Green-era Fleetwood Mac was that they didn't cater to contemporary tastes in music. When they were first founded @ the end of '67, rock bands were experimenting with psychedelic music and writing lyrics about love and drug experimentation. What was FM doing? Playing British-style Chicago Blues! By the time they released their first 2 albums, the blues they were playing had been abandoned by other rock bands like the Stones and the Yardbirds. Sure, they still utilized blues influences, but they moved on to pop or more raw-edged music. I mean, who else would've released \\"Need Your Love So Bad\\" when the Stones were writing songs like \\"Jumping Jack Flash\\"? That song was from an earlier era of popular music, but didn't Peter Green and Co. do a great job with that song?<br /><br />Then came singles like \\"Albatross\\" and \\"Man of the World\\"! How many rock bands released an instrumental as an A-side, or wrote lyrics like: \\"I just wished I'd never been born\\" @ the time FM did that? No one that I know of. I forgot to mention \\"Black Magic Woman\\" with lyrics that preceded Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin by a year or two. If it weren't for those singles in '68 and '69, \\"Then Play On\\" would've sounded like a different band than the one known for an album like \\"Mr. Wonderful\\".<br /><br />The lyrics are introspective, even a little depressing, but the guitar playing is so delicate and soulful that it more than offsets the dark mood of the lyrical content. It's hard to believe Danny Kirwan and Peter Green were 19 and 23, respectively. Danny's lyrics are mostly about lost love, but aren't sappy. And Peter's are more philosophical, which foreshadowed a dark chapter in his life which would take him out of the limelight within a few months after this album was released. And as far as guitar playing, Danny and Peter were the Lennon/McCartney of guitar harmonies as pretty much every song on here demonstrates. Each had a 6th sense of how to best complement the other's guitar playing harmonically and melodically.<br /><br />I was never able to obtain the original version of this album. That's because this was before my time and I didn't know about this incarnation of FM until a few years ago. It's hard to believe that Oh Well wasn't on the initial release, since it fits in so well with the album as a whole, esp. part 2. I guess it hadn't been written or finished in time to include it on the original LP.<br /><br />All said, this album is a unique testament to the Peter Green/Danny Kirwan era of Fleetwood Mac and is one of the great rock guitar albums of the sixties or any other decade.lement the other's guitar playing harmonically and melodically.<br /><br />I was never able to obtain the original version of this album.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A story about different people and different situations! Has you thinking, \\"what would I do? Some secrets are better kept buried!
0684857219|5.0|If you're just starting out, this book is a great place to start. It has tons of information to answer all your questions about everything from picking the right gym for yourself, to workout plans to meal plans. I'll admit that I read all the negative reviews before buying this book, and in case you're wondering about the workout plans; you don't have to follow them all the way through. Of course you won't be able to keep up with a bodybuilding workout if you're just starting out. Just use common sense and don't listen to the negativity.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|This was a great buy and a good movie. My family & I really enjoyed it. Highly recommend. Good for adults & kids.
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|i love it so much, lorde is amazing and so is  all the songs. best album i've listened to in a long time:))
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I love this movie. It's a great storyline and a great family movie. DVD plays well and price was good also.
1591845556|4.0|Kaufman's goal was not to provide a step-by-step in excruciating detail for folks who need that level of detail. His goal was to introduce a completely new idea, with examples of that idea in action.<br /><br />If you already believe a new skill can be learned adequately in 20 hours, you do not need this book.<br /><br />If you're curious, if you'd like to investigate the possibility because it seems counterintuitive, Kaufman will convince you.<br /><br />The latter half of the book is indeed taken up with 6 highly detailed examples of the first half in action. With a bit of thought, they DO show the principles in action. Kaufman simply doesn't draw circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one explaining what it is.<br /><br />I got more than one good idea from this book. I skimmed parts of the latter half, but even the first half alone is worth the price.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This book was a wonderful story of Steve Jobs, giving great insights to the person he was, a genius, perfectionist, and holding others to his own high standards, which seemed to help them achieve to a higher standard than they would have without that constant push by Jobs.<br />Definitely not kind hearted or even aware of others feelings, but did achieve high levels of amazing new technology with ideas and help from his friends and acquaintances, taking ideas and pushing them to the limit...<br />Enjoyed learning about his personal and family life.<br />I am a big fan of the iphone, and appreciate its ease of use especially since I am not particularly tech savvy.<br />This book was the behind the scenes of a great man whom I had already admired.<br />Unfortunate his having to deal with cancer and his death at such a young age and loss of a great mind!
B00G32OER4|4.0|The story was interesting but also very frightening because, I believe, it is based on real events.  I thought the actors gave a believable performance.
B001NHNG64|3.0|It is hard to go wrong with Jack Reacher. Unfortunately, the two mile sniper insists you make a two mile journey between each exciting moment. I am sure there are some who enjoy an indulgent three pages on a bullet leaving a barrel, but I prefer the impact. Persuader is a much better read.
B006YTTVHO|3.0|so so, nothing too much here, but it was cheap and ok to get some more knowledge in the subjects.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|This was a very interesting movie.  It was well made with a good story plot.  Acting was also very good.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|There is difficulty in putting this book down. Mae represents a person whom we can all relate. Putting faith in something proclaiming to be infallible is dangerous. I want to run away from all technology but I know it's too late. A great read and a pertinent warning.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|Lots of fun but can be very frustrating at times.  I love all the games by King.com would recommend them all.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is fun and challenging.  There are some levels very difficult to win with number of moves.  I don't like to buy extra moves.  It's fun to see where your friend's are in the game.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Yes another great Star Trek movie although it was a remake of the rath of con it still was very entertaining.
B00G32OER4|5.0|Classic horror movies are few and far between... but The Conjuring should stand the test of time.  Great movie.  Great special effects, awesome storyline.

1589795474|5.0|Great book, take home message,<br /><br />cliffs:<br />dont waste all your pay check<br />dont buy really expensive things, because you will most likely waste more money on the upkeep of it. like having your mom and dad help you pay 100k for a 160k home when you only make 80k with your wife. you will mostlikely try to keep up with your neighbor.<br /><br />save 10% of your paycheck<br />invest said 10%<br /><br />there is more in the book and it is really worth reading. also read &#34; the riches man in babylon&#34; worth the money
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is so addictive and fun. works well on the kindle fire. wish that it would tell you just which friends were on candy crush.
B008MX7Z32|2.0|When I first got this lamp, it was amazing. I love that it can be charged off your computer and by plug. It was bright and efficient. However, about 3 weeks into owning this lamp, SNAP. I wasn't rough with it at all. I never put strain on it. But when I went to open it one day, it literally collapsed into pieces. The light section detached and the base busted apart. From no more than casual use and easy treatment. So this lamp is great, if you're looking for something to last about a month.
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|I received my CD today and have listened to it over and over.  It is one of the best Christmas albums I have ever heard.  Her voice is sweet, clear & true to the music.  I especially loved her duet with Johnny Mathis \\"When a Child is Born\\".  If you like Christmas music, this is a must for you.  Stunning.
B002O3Z4Y8|5.0|love this movie with all the well known actors both past and present. Share this a lot. Glad I have it
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I love the book, it's honest to reality. Not every book needs to have a happy love story ending, but it's just not realistic. But there is still a happy ending, and one for the greater good.  Roth was brave for her decision in ending this trilogy and took a lot of risk (as seen by the reviews) but I commend her for it, and think it made the biggest impact to readers. Bravo! I would recommend the entire trilogy, and ask them to ignore the reviews.
B00DJZR46G|3.0|being an Elton John fan i wanted it-wasn't bad-glad he is still making albums-& I will buy another if he makes one

1449305172|5.0|If you are serious about tech entrepreneurship, you should read this book.  Ash takes the high level concepts of Lean as laid out by Steve Blank & Eric Ries and makes them actionable.  This book is a detailed how-to for measuring progress in your startup journey.
006202406X|4.0|Spoiler Alert -- Apologies<br /><br />I picked up Divergent after a colleague of mine recommended I read it. I am a high school English teacher and my colleague and I feel it is good to read what our students are reading. After finishing Allegiant, I felt like a hole had been blown through my heart. My insides ached. I felt betrayed, like the ending was unwarranted, pointless, underdeveloped. Perhaps it is that I became so attached to the characters--Tris and Tobias--that I could not bear to let one of them go, and so senselessly. I spent quite a bit of time trying to come up with a good explanation for why the book ended like it did, but I couldn't come up with a good answer. It felt wrong. Too horrific, too much tragedy, and not enough explanation.<br /><br />Ultimately, I believe my discomfort with the ending is my belief that Roth (author) overshot her YA audience, to the book's detriment. In the last book of the Hunger Games, a series that the Divergent Trilogy is quite similar to in its subject, there was so much pain, grief, unexplained deaths, and unrealistic action, but at least it ended on a note of humanity and understanding. Children NEED that. To have children invest their time in three books, only to have the character they invested that much time in be wiped away for seemingly no reason, won't sit well with them. I can see children sinking into depression, throwing down other books, refusing to be invested in the stories. Somewhere in YA novels there needs to be hope and there needs to be the promise of a better tomorrow, and I think Allegiant is missing that. The loss of Tris and the deaths of SO many others is overwhelming, and it seems to send the message that Life = Loss, and that we wander around as shadows of our former selves, never quite recovering. WHAT KIND OF A MESSAGE DOES THAT SEND TO CHILDREN? We need to inspire them, not take the sparkle out of their world. Sure, life if hard. We, as adults, know this. But YA novels that are dystopian are supposed to help their audience make sense of their world, reflect on humanity, and feel driven to make a change. Allegiant falls short with this. It just causes sorrow. Kudos to VR for making strong characters we fell in love with, but I do not approve of the way she chose to end the series. A beautiful trilogy that did not live up to its potential.
B004JMZPJG|2.0|case logic make bad cases. they are not practical, designed bad and don't fit things properly. spend a few extra dollars and go to the store where you can look into the bag and judge for yourself if you buy the right bag.  don't buy.
B00F8LPH90|5.0|I have  this game on my iPhone, and I played it often. I am glad it is now available on the kindle. Game play is a ten out of ten. No need to buy the extra coins you will earn plenty of in game coins to upgrade your planes weapons.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Fun, additive game who like more games like it.  Fantastic!  I would recommend it to any one who likes a little challenge in their games.
B00260GLBO|5.0|My husband purchased this for our 4 year old grandson to play with at our house. He loves to play in our gravel drive, hauling rocks and dumping them. This truck is the perfect size...not too big, not too small. The roll bar is perfect for using to move the truck along and the bed which lifts and rotates works great. Bruder makes a sturdy toy that is always a hit with our grandsons. Our 2 yr old grandson loved this so much we bought one for him to take home and another for our 4 yr old to take home. Highly recommend this one !
B00DJZR4A2|5.0|Listen to the great music and voice of that brilliant artist !  You will listen and listen again ! Great !!

B00FEJHPRI|5.0|Exactly as described, had a fun time watching it.  When I want to buy another movie,  I know where to look.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|After reading this book, I am a Rainbow Rowell fan. Now I want to read all her books. This story really drew me in and kept me interested throughout. I was actually bummed when I started nearing the end of the book. A great read, I highly recommend it!
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|I enjoy buying concert footage on blu-ray.  We have seen Madonna a number of times in concert, but didn't get to the MDNA Tour.  This blu-ray was priced much better than her concert tickets!
140006922X|3.0|I really looked forward to reading this book and I read half of it all at once.  Then I had to put it down.  I did learn a lot from it; however, i found it a little repetitive.  Maybe it is better to read it over a longer period of time.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|my neighbors got info this game and I was so surprised because they are really young this game is so much fun to play!!!!
B00782O7IY|3.0|This is an interesting movie, but how it got \\"Best Picture\\" of the year is beyond me. I saw it once, but have no desire to see it again, unlike many other best pictures.
B008OOYALE|1.0|I would have made it 5 star but you cant reset the game if they do that you could count me as a 5 star you should get it
B003RNXIBK|5.0|Recovery (Explicit Version)is a great album. I would not want to have the edited version. Spend the money and buy this album.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it. Even my 4-year old granddaughter plays with me. Waiting for new lives is a killer though. Would recommend this game
B008Y5OW20|5.0|Anyone who loves straight ahead Rock and Roll in the genre of British Rock especially will enjoy this CD. It is filled with tracks that have influenced Lynne over his many years as a performer and producer. Great work!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thanks kindle/amazon for candy crush. I play it all the time and was excited when I saw it here. Crush...Crush....Crush.

B004SIP6WW|5.0|This is a first class bad cop movie, and anything under five stars makes little sense. The acting is great across the board. The writing and plot development are the same. &#34;Cop Land&#34; is an overlooked masterpiece. Cliché as it sounds: don't miss this movie.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|If you're a fan of the cartoon, this a great game. A bunch of little nuances are used, but you won't understand some of them if you haven't kept up with the series. My daughter's love looking at this game... just make sure your kids don't accidentally buy coins or gems. It's easy to do.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|Cover was very flimsy, was not the typical DVD cover, it was a &#34;hard&#34; paper cover.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love reading it and i could not put kindle down. I read till very late at night to finish this book.
006202406X|1.0|I absolutely HATED this book.  I hate it when authors go for the shock and awe rather than quality.  I loved the first two books but this made me hate the whole series.  It's a good thing her first book was so good, otherwise I would say she needs a career change.  Doubt I would read another attempt by her.  Wouldn't trust her enough to invest in any series she writes in the future.  Done!  Done!  Done!
1400052181|5.0|I skipped over a few of the very scientific paragraphs but only because I was so enveloped in the human interest aspect of this book - a gripping read for anyone who's life has been touched by cancer in any way-  Let's face it, it's most of us
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|i am so happy that this game finally came to the kindle fire. It's better than it is on the iphone; not because of playability, but because the screen is bigger and better...just like me.
B00EQ30RVY|4.0|I feel kinda like a traitor liking a Stone Temple Pilots album without Scott Weiland. Like many, when I first found out Weiland was fired from STP and Chester Bennington of Linkin Park would be the replacement singer I wasn't thrilled. It's not to say Bennington isn't talented, he's amazing. People just don't like change I guess, especially when your original singer, though highly problematic was amazing. But, after a while of driving a truck with one square wheel the ride is gonna start to suck.<br /><br />High Rise surprised me with all it's tracks being very listenable and catchy.  The feel of this album is pretty tight; it's got a modern sound like their last album, but a bit more straight forward rock n' roll.  Bennington's powerful, soulful, and scratchy voice perfectly compliments each track on High Rise. In fact, there's times I'm reminded of Richard Patrick's (Filter) work with the DeLeos' on Army of Anyone (amazing album) and even Weiland himself if I close my eyes. It's not to say Bennington doesn't have is own voice, there's just traits of those other great singers.  So far, I enjoy Out of Time and Cry Cry the most on High Rise.  Looking forward to what STP's next album will be like. I'd be excited to see either a digitally mastered original studio version of their amazing demo Only Dying on a deluxe version of Core or that song redone with a modern touch on a future album. STP please, please make this happen.<br /><br />On a Weiland note, I want to hear more of his own music now that he's not in STP any more.  With the limited scope of an outsider's view there seems to be some aspect of his persona that derails so many of his relationships; wives, bands, etc. He's so talented and I can't help but wonder that if he approached things differently he might be successfully fronting both STP, VR, and doing his own stuff too.  Weiland's name is his brand; you don't want it associated with being completely impossible to work with.  Maybe he can make amends andchange some behaviors to repair his brand image. I wish him the best, and would love to see him turn things around for real this time and focus on his trade and have even more opportunities & musical success.<br /><br />CDs are so inexpensive now, so if you love STP and love the American art form that is rock n' roll: buy High Rise. This kind of music is our cultural legacy, and it deserves more respect and prominence in the popular music landscape today.
1449305172|5.0|Where Eric Reis's &#34;The Lean Startup&#34; is the defacto standard for the movement, and Steve Blank's cornucopia of knowledge is the university,  &#34;Running Lean&#34; is the down-in-the-trenches book.  Part inspiration, and part explanation, this acts as a guidebook about the practice of lean in action.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the best game ever. I love it it's free and it's so fun to see a minion every day on my kindle fire trust me you will like it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I didnt even want to look at this game....now I'm addicted. Great way to take a break during the day.
B008U3NU38|4.0|I pretty much agree with all the positive reviews here. It's beautiful, sounds great, and is chock full o' quality stuff. Here's my beef. It's not the complete collection it claims to be. Many true Clash completists have \\"Rat Patrol at Fort Brag\\", the collection of outtakes from \\"Combat Rock\\". Why didn't the boys release an alternate version of \\"Combat Rock\\"? The material exists. Bootlegs of lots of early demos and early live material, in varying degrees of quality, exists too. The boys could clean that stuff up as well, if only to put the proper speed on the tapes of some tunes or to make the audio a little clearer, not necessarily clean or remixed.<br /><br />Anyway, saying this set is brilliant is kind of redundant. We Clash fans know that. It's just kind of annoying to say this set is complete. It's not.
B000I55YV2|5.0|We loved it when it first came out, & still enjoy it every time we watch it !  Now we have it on our Kindle
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|I've already been on a low carbohydrate diet for years and have felt the performance benefits both mentally and physically. It confirms my thinking that low carb is the preferred way for most people to eat. I'm beginning to think some of the behavioral problems my children are experiencing my be related to gluten sensitivity and I'm having them screened at their next doctor visit.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I like Gone Girl and Shiny Objects better, but this is still a healthy 4 stars. Worth the read! Good plot, great twists.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|This game is very entertaining and makes time pass quickly. Very nice graphics and interesting sound effects. Good puzzle type fun.
B00A2H9X6I|5.0|Ever since I was a kid, Carrie has been one of my favorite horror movies and I was psyched for the remake. Chloe Moretz was absolutely the perfect choice to play Carrie. She should win an Award! The makers of this film claim it's truer to the book, but it seemed more like a tribute to the original movie. There were a few things from the book that they added that weren't in the original like Sue's pregnancy, Chris's dad being a lawyer and the rain of stones. (I think most truest version is the 2002 TV remake with Angela Bettis) I loved Chloe's facial expressions during the Prom massacre. She looked psychotic and was enjoying getting her 'revenge' on her classmates.<br /><br />Carrie White is a shy misunderstood teen who constantly gets bullied by Chris Hargensen and her group. When Carrie gets her first period in the gym locker room, all the girls laugh and mock her. Sue Snell feels bad about this and asks her boyfriend, Tommy Ross to take Carrie to prom. When Chris drops pigs blood on Carrie at the prom, all hell breaks loose! I highly recommend CARRIE!!!
1402713185|5.0|Book was as described, almost like new....... good little book for children to get started in the classics................. would buy from again.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I play this on facebook but can now enjoy it on my kindle fire. So now playing all the time and it is such an addicting game with hours of fun. Lives come quickly so you almost never run out.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|Quick read.  Enjoyed characters and content.  Somewhat predictable but had more to it than I had anticipated.  Looking forward to read next book in series.
B001AIRUOU|5.0|Outstanding movie,that serves as both a Halloween and Christmas film.\\"Nightmare Before Christmas\\" has always been one of my favorites,ever since I was nine years old.Cool story,awesome animations and a wonderful soundtrack full of great songs.I cannot recommend this movie enough.
B00G24KKAS|5.0|This season is so real. I love it. I feel like it's picked right up with the pace and tension I expect from the show.
B00FOU1O3S|4.0|This game is really fun, ive played it on my computer then i saw it on my tablet.... i got exited.. anyways it only lagged once so far for me. I love it when you played a round then u see a Penguin to 'great you'
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I love nearly everything that I see on Masterpiece theater and Downton Abbey was no exception.  The DVD's arrived on time and in great condition. I've even watched some of the special features.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad this is now available for the kindle fire hd, I've been waiting so long! Now I really want out this kindle down!
B002XTBEDI|5.0|I would *literally* recommend this to everyone, as long as you like lighthearted period pieces, that is.  The whole cast does a superb job of capturing the time and Tim Curry has a small role.  And there are bonnets and bonnets are the best.
B008DVJMAW|5.0|I was pleased to have this CD arrive as quickly as was promised and in original packaging.  I'm enjoying all of the songs - this is a terrific band!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Glad this game is available on Kindle! No more running down my cell phone battery playing. Way to go amazon!
1449305172|5.0|Many business books you start reading and then toss them in the trash can because they don't help you think more clearly about the challenges you face. Running Lean is not like that, it stands out as being totally worth your time to buy and read. The techniques outlined here are practical and explained in a way that makes sense even if you are not obsessed with all the lean fads.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really like this game more than I thought. And I love how it refills my lives so I'm not obligated to buy lives to play. I love it!!!!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Hooked this up to the TV using my Windows laptop to configure it. I needed to move my wireless router closer to the device for it to configure properly. Once I got past this, I was able to stream from my Chrome browser to the Chromecast quite nicely. Setting up our Android tablet to stream to the Chromecast went smoothly, but was disappointed it would not stream from the browser on the tablet. I hear that capability is in the works, and will make this a much more usable device for us once that happens. Our primary use of the device is to stream foreign language television to our big screen. It works well from the laptop for that and a very good deal for the price.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|An absolutely fitting and perfect end to this years-long odyssey that defied even the death of its author and mastermind.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works perfectly. I use it mostly for Youtube but now I am considering Netflix as well. Strongly recommended. I probably will buy another !
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I really liked this book!  It's Stephen King all the way.  It's been many years since I read The Shining, but now I think I'd like to read that again too.
B00FN811SY|5.0|This is so easy to navigate.  Love the wording of this translation.  It has all the features contained in this Bible.
0811879542|5.0|This book is such a clever one for kids to have read to them.  My grandson loves it!  And so do I!
B00CATSONE|4.0|What a fascinating look at genius and specifically Tesla. What an amazing man who gave his imagination to the world whether by force or by design.
B00ECK21WO|4.0|Your evaluation of this massive box set will probably depend upon how much of the material contained within you already own. For those owning The Great Deceiver box and perhaps The Collectable Crimson vol.1, the main interest centers on the 10 discs of soundboard recordings, many of them previously unavailable. The sound quality of the soundboards is variable, very raw, but listenable. There is much fine and exciting music here, including some very fine versions of Starless and Fracture. Also some fine impro's, although most are very short, and those hoping for another Voyage to the Centre of the Cosmos or Golden Walnut will be gravely disappointed. Actually this is maddeningly frustrating listening, with otherwise fantastic versions marred by instruments drowned in the mix, horribly out of tune singing and/or playing, tapes running out... What i mean is, if these were the only available recordings of this fantastic band, they would be invaluable. But since we have also the five professionally recorded multitrack recordings contained in the box, I wonder how many will get around to listening to the soundboards more than once or twice (how many times do we need to hear David Cross all but ruin the majestic Starless with his hideous \\"solo\\" on distorted electric piano..?). No quibble with the multitrack recordings, this is some of the greatest music ever made, no number of stars can do this music justice. And it is actually worth going through the soundboards one extra time just to enjoy Bill Bruford. And my god, how fine David Cross is on violin (and also mellotron) in his finest moments. And Wetton' bass is a huge, growling monster. And well, Fripp is Fripp. Those who can't get enough have probably already bought this box. Those with more moderate needs, beware.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|great book,I've read it several times already,I wish there were more in the series to read. Can't wait for the movie.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I often find that some popular novelists lose some of their original storytelling skills and imagination as time passes and they churn out more and more books. Thankfully, John Grisham has gone back to his writing roots for  what will surely go down as one of the greatest sequels in modern literary history. His skills are well in place!<br /><br />A Time to Kill was probably John Grisham's greatest novel, that is until he wrote Sycamore Row. The new novel takes place about three years after Grisham's first novel. You will read about the same beloved and hated cast of characters and you we'll meet several more people who play pivotal parts in the story.<br /><br />Sadly racism still is alive in Mississippi in 1989. It's awful history is key to this story. I don't want to ruin it for you. If you have ever read a Grisham book or seen a film adaptation of one, you will love this book. I intend to ponder it for awhile and read it again, but much more slowly the second time around.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|The last book \\"alleviating\\" was a have to writing. It seemed like Roth had to write it, therefore it was not like the other two. It lacked creativeness and excitement.  All the things that made her character's, one by one she striped away from them.  Wish I had not have even read this book, kind of thinned the other two for me. Not sure even an alternate ending could salvage this one.
B005LAIIGW|3.0|I don't know... they say it's the movie of the year, but I found it plot wise, it was pretty predictable.<br /><br />There certainly are some eye-candy moments, and it's the first time a 3D movie has actually made me wince when debris is flying towards you, but overall, I feel this movie was overrated.<br /><br />Really, it's a human interest story. Surviving impossible odds. Truth be told, though, if such a thing did occur, Sandra Bullock's character would not have even made it to the space station as it was scientifically not possible to do so.<br /><br />Still, if you want to forget about the plot, and just enjoy the special effects, then you'll most likely enjoy it. Recommend you see it in 3D, though, to get the most from it.
075669910X|5.0|This book covers the earth being made all the way to the evolution of humans. It shows how the study of fossils have given us insight into how life evolved on earth. This book is a tough read for children. If buying for a child you will really want to read it with them and explain each subject. It is very colorful and each page is full of great visuals. Along with the wonderful  illustrations there is tons of info covering the evolution of our planet. This book is also not a good read for someone who believes in creation. We have no problems there because we are Buddhist, but others might. If using this as a book for a child in the education of our evolving planet you might want to break out the white out board and draw some illustrations of your own. My son is very interested in paleontology. This book has become a great tool for teaching him so much more then just dinosaurs. He has found that the earths creation alone is fascinating. He also has discovered he loves plant fossils due to their uniqueness. Great book and a must have for anyone who enjoys science.
B008JFUO36|1.0|I'm writing this review, with one star, to express my displeasure at the production company. I rented this movie from red box. I thought it was decent, nothing all that special, but still wanted to check out the commentary and deleted scenes. The production company made a special \\"rented\\" version that does not allow for the viewing of special features. How selfish have studios become that they force you to spend $20 on a movie you have already paid for for a single viewing? I found that to be incredible ridiculous and I hope my review will be just enough to knock that rating down for this movie. Did they honestly think that people would rush out to buy a copy just to get Tom Cruise's opinion on a scene and see a few deleted scenes?
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|Loved the first fruit drops so much,so many levels,but this one is even better,choose from easy,medium,or hard,challenging or relaxing,love the fruit!worth every penny,hope they are more to come from bullitz,they really do games worth playing,you won't be able to put it down:)
B003B02O0A|5.0|Read this book years and years ago and it was just good the second time around. Now on to Sycamore Row!
B00BSBVJVE|3.0|The images of each comic are all off center and slightly cut off to the right, the book is still easily readable but it's rather annoying.  I'd rather wait until this issue was fixed before I re-purchase it<br /><br />Using a 1st Gen Kindle Paperwhite

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This has GREAT graphics to go along with a unique puzzle game. It is similar to MYST.  Makes you think but definitely not impossible to solve. The only down side was that it was too short. I look forward to playing any updates for this game and would highly recommend you play it!  Thanks for the creativity and thought process you put into this one...it shows!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Great movie, i could only try the 2d version and it is great, i cant wait to try the 3D version.
0060555661|5.0|I see why it is an investment classic. Along with John Bogle's book on Common Sense they are the only two books you need.  Paul Merriman's book also.

B00CE3IC74|5.0|Very easy to program and actually work as advertised. If everything were this easy, life would be so much easier.
1476734941|4.0|Weight 198 on March 1 when I got this book.  Target weight was 185.  Lost 13 pounds in 3 months by semi-fasting two a week.<br />I have kept the weight off for four months by eating carefully and semi-fasting when I creep up over 185.  It will help you have good eating habits to begin with as the steps up the learning cure.
0062287338|1.0|I was excited about the movie, but after reading this book, I have no interest. This is the worst last book of a trilogy I have ever read. I really wish I hadn't read it.

B00DW39B2K|2.0|It shows a lot of violences that really don't need to be shown. I rent it but I haven't finish it.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Once again, I laughed I cried and yelled at the screen more than I will admit to doing. If you want drama + law = gw is for you!
B004APVI1G|5.0|This movie for me was completely under the radar. I bought it on a chance that the 3d was good. This movie is a true treasure. The story was powerful and the 3d took it to another level. This movie was visually stunning! I've seen a few crappy 3d movies and make no mistake this is not one of them. Highly recommended.
1451697686|3.0|While the author has some usable ideas, because she likes to entertain has a twelve piece set of dishes and silverware, three saucepans and also three different size fry pans which is reasonable (some minimalists have only two place settings of dishes and silverware and two pans), talks as much about simplifying as she does about zero waste (some authors dwell exclusively on zero waste), zero waste and environmental concerns appears to be the main focus in all her family's decisions. She does have a husband and two boys she enjoys.<br /><br />While I desire to simplify and also be kind to the environment and appreciated a number of her ideas on refuse, reduce, reuse, recycle and rot in that order of material goods, my main goal in life is serving my Savior. She also gets preachy about getting the plastic out of one's home. While plastic doesn't decompose and can be toxic (I'd rather not have it in my home), sometimes one has to lovingly live with people who don't agree with them. I'm fine with her flying with her family to visit relatives in France, just stop the guilt trip in other areas. Also plastic is the main demon. She even prefers Alzheimer's causing aluminum over plastic. Aluminum also doesn't decompose and will be around when the earth is gone.<br /><br />And her minimalist suggestions on wardrobe, are unbelievably small. She must not live in the cold North. I totally agree with the reviewer who said that not every small town person can buy bulk. I'd rather have healthy non bulk than unhealthy bulk. Also living where I do, with no real health food store, much less a Whole Foods, it's impossible to bring glass jars to the store and refill them with things like shampoo.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|This is something you just have to see.  It is not for everyone, but it is for everyone with any sense!
B00F56AZK4|5.0|I love Jigty!!!!  It's the only site that gives not only lots of puzzle options, but size options as well.  It's so great to have large puzzle waiting for me to work when I choose, but not have it out cluttering my table!!!

B00571F26Y|4.0|I'm not saying the book is right or wrong, but worth considering. I have stopped eating wheat/wheat gluten and I've lost 9 pounds in 3 weeks with no other changes in diet or exercise. I've noticed the red checks I attributed to drinking wine too often have cleared up. I don't get the afternoon fogginess and I sleep better. My goal is blood pressure reduction and that hasn't changed. So I'm still looking for what will lead to that goal, reducing alcohol and regular exercise are next. I don't miss wheat and I like many gluten free alternatives, especially rice pasta. I don't think I'll eat wheat again.

B003V4AK8E|5.0|I was hesitant to buy this at first but with a faulty DS3 controller and with the price being $19 I figured I'd give it a shot.<br /><br />Bottom line: the Power A is an excellent replacement PS3 controller that might actually be better than a dual shock 3. Let me tell you why.<br /><br />First, I have a hard-core eye for value and build quality in nearly everything I purchase. I'm the kind of person who notices the differences between the way a Toyota, Honda and GM start and the differences in the materials companies use in even the little things. I'm not picky, I just notice.<br /><br />With that said, this is a well made controller. Power A opted for a rubberized finish that is different than other controllers on the market and what feels like polymer trigger buttons. It feels good in the hand, well balanced, not cheap and is comfortable to use for long periods.The analog sticks are a tad taller than the DS3's so it takes some getting used to. They have good travel and if you didn't know any better they could easily be mistaken for genuine Sony sticks. I'm not saying they feel the same as a DS3 but they are well made, to the point one can imagine Sony farming their analog sticks out to Power A if they wanted to. Also, I've not experienced any of the dead zone issues some have complained about. Finally, I find the face buttons to be much, much better than the DS3. They have a clickiness I like and are a bit closer together than the DS3. I find I don't get \\"lost\\" on the face buttons like I do sometimes on the DS3. About the only thing I would complain about is the fact it isn't a bluetooth controller so it can't turn on the ps3.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Of course I love this season better than season 1.  Both seasons are great.  Watching Season 3 now, Coven!  Spooky

B00BB3UYS8|5.0|Stylish, evocative writing which has you hooked from the first paragraph and never lets up, even at the end!? This is a new genre for me, and a new author, but I'll be reading more of his work because it's so hard to put down. He uses great locations and the descriptive passages are full of strong visualisation which really enriches what is a powerful and emotional journey for the main characters. Loved it!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It is the BEST EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is SO COOL!!!!!!!!!!!! You get to climb hills!!! It looks really funny when you die.
0307352153|5.0|When I was a boy, adults consistently referred to me as quiet and shy. I don't remember the description bothering me that much. I could hold my own with my peer group, but school was painful. I used to sneak off or play hooky at every opportunity because I hated school. I often let my brother and sister board the bus, then I would step off and run for home at the last minute.<br /><br />Of course, in those days, \\"Children should be seen and not heard\\" was popular. It fit me. I do think it was important that my parents never made a big deal of my shyness or implied in any way that it was a handicap.<br /><br />The pesky introvert label came up later when I took tests as part of job applications. Taking the Meyers-Brigg personality test kept me from getting at least one job.  That bothered me because I knew I could handle the position.<br />This book mentions the Meyers-Brigg several times.<br /><br />I wish I had read it years ago, but on the other hand, I probably benefited more by finding out a lot of things on my own as I worked to manage my tendencies.<br /><br />There is a short test in the book to let you know more about yourself.<br />A few things I suspected but the book confirms about introverts:<br /> Most hate small talk, but enjoy deep discussions.<br /> Not all introverts are shy. (The book mentions T. S. Elliot and his poem \\"The Waste Land\\". Seems Elliot was shy and an introvert.<br /><br />John Quincy Adams is considered one of the few introverted presidents.<br /><br />Harvard Law and Harvard Business place high value on extroverts. This would be fine if more talking were correlated with greater insight, but research suggests there is no such link.<br /><br />Venture capitalists are often frustrated when young entrepreneurs fail to distinguish good presentation skills from true leadership ability.<br /><br />Management theorist Jim Collins's research shows that every single one of the highest performing companies in a major study were headed by unassuming leaders. They were described as quiet, modest, shy, etc . . .<br /><br />Though introverts are more likely to fear public speaking than extroverts, many are quite good  at it.<br /><br />Introverts dream vividly and often recall their dreams the next day.<br /><br />They feel exceptionally strong emotions--sometimes acute bouts of joy, but also sorrow, melancholy, and fear.<br /><br />They have unusually strong consciences.<br /><br />Introverts are capable of acting like extroverts for the sake of work or the people they love.<br /><br />That often touted management myth of the seventies and eighties of multi-tasking?  Turns out the brain is incapable of doing two things well at the same time. We need focus, which increases efficiency by up to 50 percent.<br />Susan Cain also mentions author Marcel Proust and \\"the nerd soul of Apple\\", Steve Wozniak. Most know about Steve Jobs, but not Wozniak, the co-founder. Wozniak worked alone and says he acquired patience, the ability that helped him most in his career.<br /><br />Warren Buffett is a self-described introvert, and Cain lets that stand, but it has been my observation that Charlie Munger, his partner, was the introvert who always had Buffett's back. Buffett loves the spotlight. He played the ukulele and showboated at shareholder meetings and with the current U. S. president while Munger quietly picked stocks.<br /><br />Cain's exploration of the inner workings of a Tony Robbins seminar and the reactions of an introvert to this charismatic classic extrovert is fascinating.  Tony was in the news recently when several people burned themselves making his famous \\"hot coals\\" walk.<br /><br />Cain also quotes Milaly Csikszentmihalyi, the author of Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience. This book provided the theme for my first novel. He did a study of ninety-one exceptionally creative people and determined that most of them were shy in their teens.<br /><br />Cain also gets into the process of deliberate practice, a concept introduced to me many years ago. It is the key to exceptional achievement and it is best done alone.<br /><br />My review of the book seems to make the case that introverts are superior. The book does not do that. But it does offer explanation and encouragement to those introverts who see their traits as disadvantages. Extroverts have a perceptual head start, but in reality, introverts can catch up.<br /><br />Introverts should not read this looking for excuses for behavior and traits they have previously considered handicaps or traits that may have held them back in their personal relationships and careers. Instead, read it for possible explanations of why we do some of the things we do and why some introvert traits are assets, not liabilities. We can also see ways to overcome those attributes that might hold us back.ce, a concept introduced to me many years ago.

006226303X|5.0|Neil Gaiman records his own books.  I have listened to two others and its a very special experience!<br /><br />PROS:<br />1.  Neil Gaiman is a talented writer and this book is a very creative novel.<br />2.  His writing has an appeal for young adults and this book is popular with young and old alike.<br />3.  Gaiman has a wonderful reading voice and his diction is excellent.  He reads all of the characters himself, but it sound like a play.  Sort of reminds you of the radio dramatizations of my youth.  He makes his novels seem so \\"real\\" and so \\"now\\".<br /><br />CONS:<br />1.  This is fantasy and young adults need to be cautioned about that.<br />2.  At times, the story line seems drawn out, but that is strictly my personal opinion.<br /><br />I would highly recommend \\"The Ocean at the End of the Lane\\" and I would encourage the audio edition - it takes Gaiman's novel to another level.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|There are newer versions of the product now available, but old faithful Kindle 1 has functioned well in a household of two parents and two children (no pets) now for a couple of years with the only trouble being the one sole data port, the mini-USB, is either bent or damaged and now requires the power cable to go in held at an angle to properly work.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This is the last Gillian Flynn book out of all to read and I wasn't disappointed at all. I couldn't put the book down! I read it in 3 nights after work. The characters are great, lots of the twists and turns we've grown to love about the author and an ending that surprised me! I can't wait to re-read the series before the movies come out!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Good app, easy to use, with a lot of functions and frankly features that I will probably not ever use.  Definitely good for your Kindle too is trying to find a good manually downloadable file manager.  Check it out.
B0052RDHTM|3.0|Not nearly as well written or engaging as his previous epic series. Many parts are too shallow. WW1 ends abruptly in about 3 pages after hundreds in build up.
0061992860|4.0|This book is a neat collection of topics for survival, packaged in a unique size and material for on-the-go.  Honestly it needs to go in my bug-out / backpacking rig, but it currently lives in our bathroom for &#34;throne-room&#34; literature. :)
B00B52F278|5.0|really enjoyed the whole series.  The battle scenes were awesome, and the characters very colorful.  I would recommend this series for anyone who loves historical drama
B00DNUSG0U|4.0|If you like the 'Tremors' series it's a great set. Plenty of extras and behind the scenes included. Of course the HD makes it better also.
006202406X|3.0|I was so excited for Allegiant but it was a disappointment.  Felt rushed and not thought out well.  I would still recommend reading the series but its definitely not one of my favorites.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|After waiting over two years to reach a conclusion to this story, it is a huge let down.  I have never been this disappointed in an ending in my life.  I actually enjoyed this book up until the last 50 pages.  It kept my interest and it was hard to put down. Now I don't even think I will read the first two books again.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am glad Candy Crush Saga finally came to Kindle! It's a fun little game to play in my spare time!
B001NLL0RW|4.0|I am working my way through this author`s books. This is the best to date. I have found that even if you start is series out of order each book can stand on it`s own. The author has the ability to capture the reader`s attention from the first paragraph till the last.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was a delightful book.  Good for an uplifting few hours.  It would be great read for anyone  who wants to just relax and enjoy, both young and old.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I love Star Trek I've loved it ever since the 1960's and I a specially love this new movie I hope they make more in the future.
B00DMM3WVM|1.0|...unfortunately after getting half way through level 6 the tilt control started failing. And now It is no longer allowing me to play. Simply tells me that it's not responding. It's a shame because I really like this game, and will continue to try. However if the problem isn't fixed, I will have no other choice but to remove it from my devise.  Please fix this problem!!!?
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I know that it had to end the way it did but damn it I didn't want it too. I'll be crying over the ending for the next week or two so THANKS but really it was the perfect ending to a fantastic series
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a very exciting book, and for Amazon prime it's completely free! This book is filled with suspense and if you love a good read then this is the book for you. A great twist at the end, and I don't think I have anything bad to say about it
0345803507|5.0|Couldn't put it down. It just finishes the story begun in the first two books of the trilogy. Don't miss this one.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I use this app to keep track of my medication times.  It works very well and even has a snooze alarm.  I don't notice the music.
0345803493|5.0|So well written. A bit racy, but a beautiful love story. The characters are so interesting with their different personalities.
0143115014|1.0|I do not recall reading such talentless, flatfooted prose in a very long time. Every sentence reeks of recycled cliché. It is interesting that the law of large numbers does not apply to mediocrities: an entire book can be produced without a single phrase hitting the mark.
0345803485|5.0|Many thanks to E. L. James for a well written book that's never boring. I couldn't wait to get to the second & third books in the trilogy. Can't wait for any future books from this author.
0385342071|5.0|I have enjoyed many of Sophie Kinsella's books. This one is a very interesting concept which I won't give away so as not to spoil for anyone who hasn't read it yet. Sometimes with her books I feel, hang on is this going to get too silly?- but she always manages to do it just right and the comedy timing is impeccable. It gets so that you just can't help laughing out loud. The 'singing scene' is absolutely priceless! A real feel-good read, perfect for a holiday or just whenever you want to curl up with a good book. With the hardback edition that I had, Sophie Kinsella has also brought to it an interesting new dimension: If you download a free app from google play you can point your mobile at the book cover and it becomes animated and the magpie on the cover makes sounds! Also the mobile phone on the book jacket makes keypad tones and then rings. Next you can point your mobile over the author photograph in the dust jacket and the photo comes to life and she talks to you about the book and thanks you for choosing it and hopes you will enjoy it. A nice little touch making an old fashioned hardback interactive in this age of kindles and ipads, very cool.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This is a great game get it! I find this great blew hoop ok ok ok ok ok  'll. Lookalikes.  K. K k k  ok I  ok 'll  'll  'll k k
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I waited so long for this book and just can't believe this is what I got. Disappointing on so many levels....
B00E3D7WGU|5.0|LIstening to this brought back great memories of the night I was at the concert at the Palace in Michigan. Sounds great. Madonna rocks!!!!.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|So glad to finally see king bringing some of the games to kindle. It was my one disappointment with my kindle. This is one of the better time killing games that isn't to easy.
0345803507|5.0|Great trilogy!! Better than I expected. Couldn't stop reading it! Waiting to see what E.L. James comes out with next.....and can't wait to see the movie😉!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is easy but challenging.  Just enough to make you think.  Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to waste some time.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Fun way to learn on your own. You gain coins for each level you complete. Has speaking, writing, reading, and visual aspects of learning. You can do multiple languages.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|A very useful and versatile alarm clock app!  With this you shouldn't need any other.  Music option is very nice!
B006PZBR8S|5.0|This a very good movie and we are thinking of buying it.  We rare by movies but this one seems to be a keeper for us.
0451419243|5.0|I love this Winter of the World book.there are times I just can't put it down. It is giving me so must history in such a way that I will never forget. The people, the families are so beautifully drawn out. There are times I say Oh no, don't let that happen. I did read Fall of Giants so I know the people.
B00BEIYMTW|2.0|This movie was boring and very badly written. It did NOT hold the attention of my four kids, ages 2,4,6, and 8. It was half way over when I realized that I had no idea what was going on, because it didn't hold my attention either! Yes it's a kids movie but a great kids movie is entertaining to the whole family. I could list 100 such movies. This one is NOT on that list. Don't waste your money!
B001PPGAK8|5.0|Definitely different than the other X-Men movies, but not in a bad way. It's hard to argue which of the 3 is the best, but this one went way out on a different limb than the other two, and that's what gives it some oomph the others don't have.
1476727651|5.0|Stephen King never disappoints.  I love the twist and turns Danny has to travel, and those he travels with.  A great read!
B001PPGAJE|5.0|Plays it a little slow and safe sometimes, but it's really good, and what would prove to be a great launching point for the franchise.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I liked the movie but the 3D disk was very dissappointing.  Throught the movie there were blue lines across the screen which really diminished the viewing enjoyment.  For the money spent, I expected better quality control, as the disc was barely viewable.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|I wasn't sure this would live up to the recent X-Men trilogy, but it did. It was surprisingly entertaining. Great cast, fun characters, nice change of pace, great action and story.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|I should have knownn better, I dislike zombie movies this one included. It is a re-telling of several movies rolled into one with a small twist ending. I'm sure I could have found something better to do with my time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|lots of fun for me and my grandchildren to play together.  easy to catch on.  helpful hints.  very colorful.  keeps your attention.
B00FEB09VA|4.0|I don't give 5 stars, so i won't start now. First off, unless your kids are over 30, this is not a family type movie. If you are a baby boomer (like me) it is worth watching. It is even more relevant if you (recently) lost a parent or two, particularly to cancer (been there done that). The entire movie was not a tear jerker, it got there non-the-less. Not a sad movie, just a story being told. It was worth the time to watch it, once.
1444780786|5.0|The best cook book I have acquired in a long time.  The only negative is that there are no conversion tables so I am having to figure that out as I cook each new recipe
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|this game is ok.  not too bad, not too good.  lives need to spawn on a faster cooldown.  overall net.
B001TH16DI|4.0|I have been a Star Trek fan for years. These are the original theatrical versions and look great in blue ray. I would have given 5 stars except disk 3 &#34;The Search for Spock&#34; was miss packaged as being disk 2 &#34;The Wrath of Khan&#34; so looking at the box you think you have are missing &#34;The Search for Spock&#34;.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|To fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love it my sister love it my mom brother dad it is that fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! #1#1#1#1#1 u have to buy this I mean it
B00BSBVJVE|5.0|Very cute saga and very funny!  I highly recommend it for everyone, whether you have a cat of your own or not.<br /> :)
B0031RAOVY|5.0|You would never know how a dog can inspire so many people. This was a awesome movie. Hachi was such an amazing dog how he connected to the spiritual world was just magnificient. Really think if I deciede to get another dog, I would look at the Hachi breed.
B001JIHGO0|3.0|The movie was not as clear as I wished it would have been and the sound quality was off too
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I thought it was a fun game  to play. With friends and with random players,and I really love to draw.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was super happy to pick up the complete Firefly series for under $20. I was even more excited to receive it so quickly in the mail. It was packaged nicely. I would recommend this product if you like Sci-Fi, Joss Wedon or are just looking for an awesome  new fandom :D
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|IF U HATE READIND  THEN U SHOULD DEFINETLY READ THIS ITS GREAT KEEP READING THUS BOOK IS AWSONE I RECOMMEND IT
B00ANYJ3NI|5.0|Mike Lewis is thorough, to the point, as well as interesting. His work is suggested reading for students in my finance classes!
B00CF2UORK|4.0|Maybe not as good as the first season, but still quite good for us adults to watch with our 8-year-old.
1454704225|5.0|This was one of the best books I ever bought!  LOVE everything about it and would definitely recommend it!<br />I am filling up journals like crazy  :)
B00ER23UYA|3.0|I am a relatively late-comer to the remarkable talent of Diane Birch. I'm smitten.  I started a few weeks ago with her first release, \\"Bible Belt.\\"  It is one of the more thoughtful, inspired recordings of the past 5 years.  The purity of Diane's work compares favorably to the likes of Joni Mitchell, Carole King, Laura Nyro and even a hint of the younger Dionne Warwick.  It reminds me of Adele's first album not in sound, but because after one listen so many of the songs seem as if they've been friends for years.<br /><br />\\"Speak a Little Louder\\" is the recent release.  It marks a dramatic departure from her prior work, and personal taste will confirm whether it is a good or bad thing.  The songwriting remains solid, personal and frequently haunting.  The intro to so many tracks tease that this will be the ballad, the pure, stripped-down sound from Bible Belt, with hints of country and R&B and blues.  Virtually all, however, quickly move to a modern day wall of sound, overwhelmed by the Homer Steinweiss production.  Brooklyn notwithstanding, it's an odd pairing, and one that could have resulted (positively) in a few very big sounding tracks with strings and chorus.  Instead, the steady build-up on nearly every track becomes almost formulaic and distracting.<br /><br />I look forward to seeing her live, hoping to see the smaller band.  An \\"Unplugged\\" release of these great songs would be fantastic. I'm still smitten, but I think a little less would have been a lot more on \\"Louder.\\"
B0050DIWFC|4.0|There are areas during the trial that got wordy, a little boring or repetitive. The ending was not expected so surprising me it did! I would recommend book I just bare with the slow areas!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is really fun. I just got this game and so far it's been great.<br />The only complaint I have is that it takes a little bit for it to start up. I give this game a 5 star rating.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I could not put this book down. The premise is a great discussion starter and who does not wonder from the title what the secret is. The way the secret is discovered leads the reader to think \\"What would I do?\\"  The characters are interesting and  multi dimensional. As the plot progresses they take the reader to situations that are real and thought provoking. This is a gem and a must read!
B00FWLSOOG|2.0|I was thinking it would have been better than it was. All in all the graphic part was good. Y
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Loved the twists and turns it kept me until it let me go. Lost a lot of sleep for this one
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Love the hd graphics, super colorful, addicting game. Only negative comment I have is the loading time before a new run is somewhat annoying.
B0053O89YM|5.0|Love this show. Brilliantly written. Stunning performances. Specxtacular (Emmy winning) guest stars. With the whole season on DVD - can fight the withdrawal I feel every week when the current episode ends and i know I have to wait 7 days for the next one.
B006Z00R1Q|1.0|Long and drawn out...waste of time. Not  anything I would recommend to even the most die-hard off the genre........Period. 1
B0063GORYU|5.0|I Always want to beat my score ___one day I will get under 90:)....this game is addictive....Love to play spider......great pastime
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Enough of a challenge to keep my interest, but Finished in a couple of hours. Hope they add more levels soon.
B004GJYROG|4.0|This is a wonderful piece of a very well done combination of cartoon and real people. Not to mention it's great for laughs.
1449305172|5.0|This has been one of the most influencial book I've ever read about \\"business plans\\".<br /><br />The methodology is very simple, logical and best of all it does work!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Lot of detail about a country most of us know little about.  Believable, at times humorous adventure.  It takes a long time to get to a quick finish, but worth the trip.
B000001ESP|5.0|This is a complete album.  Every song is superb.  I got to hear it live from beginning to end when they did the \\"Time Machine\\" tour.  Perhaps the best show I've ever seen.<br /><br />I never get tired of listening to this.
B0060V1WJ6|4.0|I really liked this movie. Could watch it over and over again. The actors were great, Ryan Gosling was gorgeous.
B000001ESN|5.0|My three favorite Rush albums are Permanent Waves, Moving Pictures, and 2112.  Usually...  But, since everything they've done is unbelievably good, it might depend on my mood at the time.  But, this is one I can listen to from beginning to end and never ever get tired of it.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Brandon Sanderson never fails to deliver the goods and is a master of short stories. He always leaves me feeling like the action is just getting started.
B000001ES9|4.0|Don't read too much into that title.  This is a great album.  I don't mean to imply it is in the least bit bad.  Thus the 4 stars.  I just can't see giving anything without Neil an equal rating. :-)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|absolutely love this game, I want more challenges. And why are the add-ons so expensive? Would really love more scenes
B004YESKU0|4.0|So, I damaged my Hypnotize and Mezmerize CD's.  I overplayed them...that was part of it.  The only other album I owned (prior to this set) is Toxicity.  All three of those albums are fantastic, and well worth the price of this boxed set.  I decided to buy this because I needed undamaged copies of those.  The other two albums didn't move me.  God, I tried to get into them, but I couldn't.  This thing gets 4 stars because of that.  Hey, it's just my opinion.  If I reviewed Mezmerize, Hypnotoze and Toxicity separately...they'd each get 5 stars.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|I bought this movie because I am in the process of reading the books written by Lee Child and I really enjoy them. I wanted to see how Tom Cruise portrayed the character of Jack Reacher, and I think he did a great job. I will buy any that are produced in the future.
B00EMAGCJM|5.0|Most of these songs were very good. I think if more than 50% of the songs are enjoyable than a CD is worth buying.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It's a great deal for kids and adult mystery little pony friendship is magic fans alike. It's a good to play on a long road trip because wi-fi isn't necessary to play the game.
B00AH8FTT2|4.0|Jeffrey Archer does it again.  The book is so easy to read and so hard to put down.  Can't wait for the next book in the series.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Considering dropping back our satellite TV package and we think we can use this device to watch our favorite shows that we will loose with the drop, since we usually DVR them anyway!
B009POCG5Y|5.0|Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams rock!  Justin Timberlake was great as well!  If you like Moneyball, you'll love this one!
B00FN8HS5O|4.0|I usually do not purchase these types of albums, but after watching the movie I knew I had to have this one. The music on this is very much in the vein of ambiance music, yet the motifs of melody are very recognizable. I needed music I could listen to while doing intense studying (enough to drown out extraneous noise but not catchy enough to distract my unfocused mind) and this fit the bill. A few too many dramatic moments to meditate or fall asleep too, but overall a very satisfying purchase in a genre I do not usually invest in.
B00BRUQ3PS|3.0|I am still trying to get through the book.  Not as entertaining a read as the previous books in this series. The first one third of the book drags and am hoping it will pick up as I go further into the plot
B007TK77QE|5.0|This book is a wryly observed character study of the haves & the have nots. It shines a stark light on the attitudes, expectations, foibles, vanities, aspirations, failings and flaws of all of its characters, both the middle class Pagforders & the low class Fielders. There are not many characters that come up smelling of roses and most are downright unlikable, but all seem to have some small redeeming trait that makes them human & not just caricatures.<br /><br />This is not a book for those wanting another Harry Potter but it is a fantastic read if you enjoy well developed characters and superb writing.
0385350864|3.0|126lb, calories 2543, hours slept 5.5, giant mugs of caffeine drunk 3, Facebook Friends 59, words of review written 0<br /><br />Friday 18 October 2013<br />6:30 A.M. Gaaah! Yes, DIARY fans, Bridget Jones has returned, and it’s my job to let you know how she is surviving the 21st century.<br /><br />Not so well. Or maybe am just sleep deprived. More coffee. Shower. Back in five.<br /><br />2:04 P.M. Took longer to wake up than I thought. But Bridget too is always late. In fact, she is always struggling to be a Perfect Something: screenwriter, lover, daughter, mother….<br /><br />She has kids, two of them, Billy and Mabel. With Mark Darcy, dishy human-rights lawyer (remember him?). Except he’s dead. Killed by a landmine in Darfur five years before book begins. BJ fans irate at this turn of events. Death threats to Fielding. Jane Austen (original DIARY inspired by PRIDE AND PREJUDICE) would never have shocked us with tragedy when settling down for nice cozy, humorous read.<br /><br />Speaking of literary classics, Bridget, in this book, is working on screenplay inspired by Hedda Gabbler (spelling hers), which she thinks was written by Chekhov (Ibsen, from the grave, is irate).When corrected, she does not flinch (“I can always pretend it was intelligent irony”). Later vows to take on From the Lighthouse. Good luck with that!<br /><br />128lb, calories 3040 (blame on goat brie), pieces of clothing purchased online 1, hours of TV watched 3.5, reviews of book in NY Times 2, words of own review written 220<br /><br />Sunday 20 October 2013<br />8:15 A.M. So Bridget is sad and, amazingly, 51 years old. Can Fielding pull off trick of updating DIARY while including note of tragedy but not so much as to make book unfunny? Yes and no.<br /><br />She is same old (really old) Bridget --- missing pronouns and articles intact --- except now she texts and tweets. Most of her communications are with a hot 30-year-old bloke named Roxby McDuff, Roxster for short, whom she meets once she has overcome resistance to dating after several years as widow/Born-Again Virgin.<br /><br />At first, true to form, she is socially inept (“Number One Key Dating Rule: DO NOT TEXT WHEN DRUNK”); as for her parenting skills, clearly they were never meant to stand alone (her daughter has a doll named Saliva. I rest my case). Thus, the book is a slapsticky narrative of irresponsible mess-making that includes lateness, head lice, vomiting, farting (especially in yoga class), techno-cluelessness, and food spilled on self --- despite vain resolutions to get her life in order and devote herself to kids (“Maybe will go to yoga and become more flexible. Or maybe will go out with friends and get plastered”).<br /><br />9:05 A.M. Bridget wouldn’t be Bridget without a posse of freakish yet tenderhearted chums, who pitch in with matchmaking (“She HAS to get laid”), fashion advice (“You can’t rely on your arse in jeans at our age”), and a novel approach to middle-aging that involves “rebranding,” Botox, and YSL thigh boots. As they enter a dimly lit, trendy club, Bridget has an attack of nerves, crying, “I’m too old!” “So?” says one of her friends. “It’s practically pitch black.”<br /><br />Meanwhile, although Mark has left her with plenty of cash, Bridget’s creative soul craves work. The movie-biz scenes in which she peddles her screenplay to Greenlight Productions are amusingly peopled by time-pressed, globe-trotting execs who want to shift her story from Norway to Hawaii. On a yacht.<br /><br />lbs & calories unknown (afraid to face scale or fridge in grim cold après-weekend light), last-chance online sales fallen for 2, library books finished 0, words of review written 585, minutes spent worrying about deadline 386<br /><br />Monday 21 October 2013<br />7:53 A.M. Right! Time for some criticism. Otherwise, what sort of reviewer would I be?<br /><br />Hyperbole is Fielding’s literary mode of choice, and though much of thetime it works, exaggeration can get tiresome, especially since raunchy single-woman stuff is pretty run-of-the-mill these days (Bridesmaids makes Bridget look tame). When the DIARY first came out, SEX AND THE CITY (the book) had just been published, and the frank-yet-endearing sexually explicit Chick Lit thing was fresh and engaging. A few years later, the definitive harassed working-mother novel appeared with I DON’T KNOW HOW SHE DOES IT (2002). As for dating a younger man, think “Cougar Town.”MAD ABOUT THE BOY touches all these bases; originality is not its strong suit.<br /><br />Also, there is wallowing. I’m not against a comic novel having moments of seriousness, but some grossly sentimental moments made me wince (“Mummy, will Daddy know I’m doing the concert?” asks little bassoon-playing Billy). Moreover, I was less than persuaded by an epiphany about imperfection that magically brings Bridget intimacy with insecure babysitter and peace with annoying mother. And, by the way, on subject of perfection and im-, BJ, despite frequent and graphic bodily meltdowns, always always seems to have ideal, glitch-free sex. This is not realistic.<br /><br />Plus, the plotting is obvious: The Man of BJ’s Dreams is telegraphed early in the book, and a happy ending hovers throughout. Despite all the frenetic, angst-y window dressing, MAD ABOUT THE BOY (the title is from a Noel Coward song; neither Fielding nor Bridget is as anti-intellectual as she appears) is a nearly Hollywood-ready rom-com.<br /><br />Tuesday 22 October 2013<br />8:16: A.M. New day dawns. Autumn sun, blue sky, etc. I grow soft and forgiving.<br /><br />Bridget, bless her, remains the charmingest of heroines. I was rooting for her and Roxter with every text (and living with her through every agonizing cyber-silence). I was suffering with her over each junk-food binge and insecurity crisis. Bridget is the inner wild child harbored by in-control females like me: the over-the-top woman who is always on the verge of escaping into public view.<br /><br />That’s why we love her, and that’s why her latest escapades, though more retro than radical, are still funny, still touching, and still bloody good fun.<br /><br />Reviewed by Kathy Weissman
B00FEHXISA|1.0|I rented this with trepidation after reading other reviews on this movie. Still wasn't prepared for poor story and directing. The only part I enjoyed were Downey's scenes with the young boy who helps him out. The only portion with any warmth and humanity. I suppose if you love the &#34;Transformer&#34; movies you will like this one. The first &#34;Iron Man&#34; was great, what happened?
0316055433|3.0|If you’re looking for a tried-and-true literary device with which to start an action-packed novel, the stolen painting is a good candidate. In last year’s THE ART FORGER, B.A. Shapiro crafted an entertaining tale out of an artist’s attempts to paint copies of a work pinched from Boston’s Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. Now, in THE GOLDFINCH, Donna Tartt’s 800-page novel, a masterwork taken from New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art after a terrorist attack is the catalyst for an overwritten but inventive story that includes bipolar Wall Street executives, Ukrainian druggies with ties to criminal elements, and failed actors contriving equally doomed careers as Vegas gamblers.<br /><br />The protagonist is 13-year-old Theo Decker, a Manhattan student who has been suspended from school for smoking. Theo and his mother, Audrey, are on their way to a meeting at school. Audrey has an art history degree from NYU and supervises photo shoots for an ad agency. Theo’s father, a former actor, abandoned the family a year earlier. Audrey and Theo are early for the meeting, so they stop at the Met to see an exhibit of Dutch paintings, “Portraiture and Nature Morte: Northern Masterworks of the Golden Age.”<br /><br />While they are in the museum, a terrorist bomb explodes. Dozens are killed, including Audrey, who is struck in the head by flying debris from the gift shop, where the bomb was planted. Theo survives. When he comes to, he finds lying next to him a dying old man coated in ash. The bleeding stranger babbles to Theo about Mozart and France and piano lessons. He implores Theo to take from the rubble a small painting of a goldfinch, a 1654 work by the Dutch painter Carel Fabritius. Then he removes a gold ring from his finger and presses it into Theo’s palm. “Hobart and Blackwell,” the man says. “Ring the green bell.”<br /><br />Theo moves in temporarily with the Barbours, a wealthy family whose younger son, Andy, is one of his closest friends atschool. Shortly after the move, Theo looks up Hobart and Blackwell in the phone book and discovers that it is the name of a business in the West Village. When he visits the building, he sees that it is an antiques shop, with trinkets such as Staffordshire dogs and “settees upholstered in sallow old brocade” in its dusty windows. A tall, haggard-looking man answers the door. After Theo gives him the ring, the stunned man introduces himself as Hobie and invites Theo in.<br /><br />What follows is an intricately plotted adventure that, over 14 years, takes Theo from Hobie’s old curiosity shop to the desert of Las Vegas and the streets of Amsterdam. The one constant throughout these adventures is the stolen painting, which Theo has hidden in a pillowcase. No one, not even the authorities, knows he has it.<br /><br />Read a review of THE GOLDFINCH, including this one, and you’re bound to see the word Dickensian. Tartt encourages the comparison: Hobie refers to Ebenezer Scrooge and the Artful Dodger; characters have names like Bracegirdle and Havistock Irving; a major character becomes an orphan. And the novel, like Dickens’s best works, is huge.<br /><br />THE GOLDFINCH possesses the good and bad qualities of Dickens’s output. Tartt’s novel, like much of the Dickens canon, would have benefited from more rigorous editing. Tartt rarely passes up an opportunity to give us five or six details when one or none would have sufficed. She tells us the names and titles of five administrators whose offices Theo passes as he escapes the bombed-out museum. We learn the names of five of Andy’s AP classes, the titles of the Graham Greene films he watches one night, the menu items at a Las Vegas restaurant. The lawyer Bracegirdle begins a conversation with Theo by reciting a page-long backstory of the circumstances whereby he met Theo’s mother. Parenthetical digressions abound.<br /><br />However, the novel entertains despite its excesses. Tartt’s strength is plot. She has created many well-drawn characters and clever twists, although some of the latter depend on coincidences and chance meetings in a city of eight million. THE GOLDFINCH is far from perfect, but give Tartt credit for daring to write a book that is so brazenly different from many other modern novels.<br /><br />Reviewed by Michael Magras
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I hated the monotonous writing and very boring action, but throw in the character deaths and I'm sad I can't give it a zero.
0767919408|3.0|Someday, somebody is going to write a history of the year 2013, and it is going to be just so embarrassing. I probably won’t be around to read it, but just imagine what somebody born in 2037 is going to think of us poor schlubs stuck in 2013, with our primitive smartphones, non-flyable cars, and endless, grinding commercialism. I figure the future history books are going to look back on this year with the same sort of mockery and contempt that we reserve for the polyester fashions and unappealing music of, say, 1977. There’s going to be a whole chapter in the book on Miley Cyrus and what twerking was, and I am just sick thinking about it.<br /><br />To his credit, Bill Bryson doesn’t engage in a lot of mean-spirited mockery about 1927 in his new book. ONE SUMMER focuses primarily on the prominent Americans of that time and their experiences from that summer, most of whom (with the notable exception of Henry Ford) come off looking much better than the celebrities of our time do now. To be sure, 1927 was full of all sorts of ridiculous (not to mention dangerous) nonsense, but Bryson looks back on it with clear eyes, not impeded by nostalgia or hero-worship, trying to tell the important stories of the people who others looked up to.<br /><br />ONE SUMMER is dominated by the figure of Charles Lindbergh, who famously flew The Spirit of St. Louis across the Atlantic Ocean and landed in Paris as the most famous man in the world. Aviation is a dominant theme here, but as Bryson points out, that’s what people were interested in; the New York Times ran aviation stories on its front page for weeks after the Lindbergh flight. Lindbergh appears to have been the only man skilled enough at the time to have made the flight --- Bryson delights in pointing out the shortcomings of the other pilots vying to cross the Atlantic at the same time --- but piloting an airplane is a vastly different thing than dealing with the literal crush of the public trying to get their hands on you and your airplane. Although Lindbergh took off on a coast-to-coast barnstorming tour of America after his heroic flight, he appears to have been totally exasperated with the public relations side of things.<br /><br />This also seems to have been true of Calvin Coolidge, who spent the summer of 1927 camped out in South Dakota, from which he transmitted a characteristically terse message indicating that he would not run for re-election in 1928, and said all of five words at the following press conference. But it was emphatically not true of Babe Ruth, who led the “Murderer’s Row” of the 1927 Yankees, who swept through the American League like a harvester in a cornfield. And it was also not true of the guy who sat on a pole in Newark for the better part of the month, or any other thrill-seeker or attention-getter from the time that you can think of, or even those you never heard of.<br /><br />Suffice it to say that there was a whole lot going on in 1927. Bryson thinks you should know about it, and is willing to tell you if you just sit back and listen. The best way to enjoy the book is to just let it all wash over you, to let Bryson’s masterful narrative voice tell you the stories, one after the other, sometimes stacked one on top of another, sometimes jostling for space like impatient passengers trying to board a train. There are so many stories to tell, and there is at least a temporal connection between them. Anyway, you’re not doing anything else, so just sit down and let Bryson tell you about Herbert Hoover and what he was up to.<br /><br />ONE SUMMER works very well on a narrative level, but not so much as a book of history. Bryson has a very loose framework for the tale, which means that he goes back and forth between different stories, without much in the way of a discernible pattern. (The reader is often introduced to a character or a theme, and then Bryson explains that he’ll get to whoever it is later.) When Bryson fixates on a theme, though, he piles on every bit of relevant backstory that he can find --- including the tidbit that Charles Lindbergh’s father had a slightly different middle name than he did. This is fine storytelling, but it makes the book seem unfocused and wandering at times. However, the real problem with the book is that Bryson isn’t adding anything to the story of 1927 except his own voice and talents. There’s no room in his breezy, airy style for analysis or even original thought.<br /><br />If you are looking for an omnibus look at 1927, ONE SUMMER is not a bad place to start; it’s wholly entertaining and occasionally delightful. However, all that reading it did for me was cause me to look at other books in my library that cover the same time frame --- particularly the wonderful LAST CALL, Daniel Okrent’s history of Prohibition, and RISING TIDE by John Barry, about the disastrous Mississippi River flood of that year. ONE SUMMER is a good starting point for anyone looking into the 1920s, but there are many more comprehensive works out there for the serious reader.<br /><br />Reviewed by Curtis Edmonds

0385537131|5.0|When you are one of the world’s bestselling authors, it is easy to rest on your accomplishments. Create an endearing character, follow a basic plot formula, publish a book annually, and wait for your latest effort to appear on the bestseller lists. With hundreds of millions of books sold, John Grisham could easily fall into the rut of a tired and stale effort. But that does not seem to be his style. Grisham’s novels often reflect on topical political and legal themes. In THE INNOCENT MAN, a nonfiction work, he chronicled a true legal injustice: the conviction and death sentence of Ron Williamson in Ada, Oklahoma. Occasionally Grisham deviates completely from this format and offers readers a sports-themed novel. He refuses to allow his writing to be typecast.<br /><br />For the first time in his career, Grisham has written a sequel to one of his bestsellers. A TIME TO KILL was his debut novel but not his first bestseller. It was rejected by most publishers but received a publication run of 5,000 copies by Wynwood Press. Subsequently, he turned out THE FIRM, THE PELICAN BRIEF and THE CLIENT. Doubleday then re-released A TIME TO KILL, and it became a bestseller, a movie, and currently is being performed on Broadway. Perhaps that unusual history prompted Grisham to return to his debut. SYCAMORE ROW sends readers back to rural Mississippi, three years after the events of A TIME TO KILL.<br /><br />The opening chapters of SYCAMORE ROW remind readers of those events. Jake Brigance, a young attorney, successfully defended Carl Lee Hailey in a racially charged trial in the small Ford County community of Clanton, Mississippi. Hailey had killed two men who raped his 10-year-old daughter. The racial issues raised by the African-American Hailey shooting the two white rapists tore the small town apart. Brigance’s courtroom victory came at a substantial price, as Klan members destroyed his home and terrorized his family and friends. Even now, three years after the trial, Brigance has seen little benefit from his great courtroom victory. His law practice has not benefited financially, he lives under law enforcement protection, and he has added a nine-millimeter pistol to his wardrobe.<br /><br />SYCAMORE ROW opens with the suicide of Seth Hubbard. Near death from lung cancer, Hubbard takes his life by hanging himself. The next day, Brigance receives a letter written by Hubbard the day before his death. Included is a handwritten will and instructions for defending the will in court. Ninety percent of Hubbard’s substantial estate is left to his housekeeper, Lettie Lang. Obviously Hubbard’s disinherited children are going to contest the will. The battle is joined.<br /><br />Many of the characters who were in A TIME TO KILL are back in SYCAMORE ROW. Of course, Jake, his wife Carla and their daughter are important characters in the story. Most of the denizens of Clanton also appear on these pages. More important are the issues and spirit that are present. The passage of three years has not changed the racial issues that confront rural Mississippi. Grisham captures the south of the 1980s facing the evolution of the civil rights era. In A TIME TO KILL, it was race and crime; in SYCAMORE ROW, it’s race and money.<br /><br />While almost all of Grisham’s novels contain legal themes, his characters are not always heavily involved in courtroom activity. SYCAMORE ROW is a courtroom novel, and because it involves a civil case, a contested will, it allows for some interesting courtroom scenes. Grisham portrays lawyers and judges in a somewhat wistful manner. His judges rule with an iron hand, his lawyers are often greedy and duplicitous, except for the noble white knights battling injustice wherever it appears. Lawyers with courtroom experience who read Grisham understand all too well that real courtrooms are not like the ones portrayed in this book. But it really does not matter one bit. Plot trumps the truth in most courtroom novels.<br /><br />A prolific writer such as Grisham always runs the risk of turning out a clunker. But he has the knack for finding topical themes, inventive plot twists and the appropriate criticism of the legal profession to make his novels entertaining and page-turning. He is not William Faulkner but makes no claim to be such a writer. Comfortable in the knowledge that he entertains readers, Grisham continues to turn out great novels. SYCAMORE ROW will not disappoint fans.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stuart Shiffman

B00F8L2VO4|5.0|What you get out of this app depends entirely upon the time you are willing to put into it, just like any other language lesson.  It is entertaining and fun, and I love how the lessons fall into ten-minute segments so that you can work on a lesson while you're waiting for a bus or taking a quick break from work.  The full website does better than the mobile app at explaining the rules of the language, but you can actually pick up quite a bit intuitively simply by running the questions.  I've read that a certain number of hours at this app is the equivalent of a college course, and honestly I can believe it having done both.  I would like to see an option for vocal drills only that gradually gets more picky.  My idea being to take the lessons beyond parsing sentences and into a full ability to pronounce and think in the language.  It may get there already, I don't know as I'm only on level 8.  But kudos for a free fully functional language program that I find easily equals expensive things like Rosetta Stone, having tried that once on a free trial.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|I enjoyed the rest of the story and first 2 books, but the ending was rushed and disappointing and left big questions that needed to be answered and didn't make much sense.  The ending drifted from the plot.  The author didn't do their job when they have to try and explain things after publishing and it still doesn't make sense.<br /><br />I cried at first but what a dumb ending, its not believable. I personally have re-written the ending in my own head for myself based on the rest of the story.  I don't think David would have acted that way.  I also hate that the author left a huge questions unanswered - what was Tris' mom was actually doing before her life ended? What was her real motive or mission? It is a big question.  She didn't need to get the Edith Pryor video because she knew it was not the only copy.  I felt like the ending was just for shock value but again not consistent with the rest of the story.  I think Hollywood should consider changing the ending to be more realistic to rest of the story.  I think the magic antidote to the death viral is dumb and last minute.  It would have been a better ending if David had stopped Tris at the door.  Told her what her mom was really doing in Erudite headquarters - maybe something along the lines of trying to destroy the simulation.  Regretting that he lost her mother.  Then stating that not even he can get into the weapons room by himself, it requires 2 people to access it and only a couple of the counsel members can get it and none of them would ever put the GD's lives above the experiment.  Then he says &#34;I loved your mother... you know? I never wished for her to die.&#34; and Tris replies, &#34;I know&#34; and then he sacrifices himself instead for all the destruction he's caused and then Tris & Tobias can live happily ever after.  Don't get me started on Uriah, what was all that even about?

The song cuts out at 1:24, and even though it's supposed to end at 1:27, it keeps going for over three minutes, with two minutes being nothing but dead air. The album itself was splendid, but having to manually swap is a little annoying, as well as not knowing what they're singing at the end.

B00BD99JMW|2.0|I have to preface this by saying that I LOVED the first two books of this series.  I felt like this third book was written hurriedly, with little thought given to character development or depth.  I just didn't feel a real connection to ANY of the new characters outside of the city and many of the characters from inside the city seemed to become more shallow. And the ending (spoiler alert) was horrid.  Not only killing off one of the main characters...but then there just didn't seem to be any good way to wrap it up, so it just rattled on for a couple chapters with Tobias trying to figure out how to live without Tris?!?  I can think of about 30 ways that this could have ended that could have been more meaningful, less wasteful and more worth reading.  I'm not even convinced that Tris had to live...sometimes a main character has to die (because they are just too injured/mentally traumatized to continue)...but there should have been a better way to wrap it up, for Tobias to find out, for him to grieve her death.  UGH.

B003JTHXOK|4.0|This is one of a few of Nicholas Sparks' books I've read.  He has turned out to be one of my favorite authors.  I find his stories to be easy reading, page turners.  Not only does he combine romance and mystery but he ties God's amazing hand in his characters' lives.  You can't go wrong with &#34;Safe Haven&#34; to add to your library of fiction.  I did see the movie first but found the book even better and I discovered I couldn't remember the movie 100% so there were still surprises in reading the book.

B00AJRQLTI|4.0|This review has more to do with the film's editing choices than anything. A musical like 'Les Miserables' relies as heavily on the rich orchestrations as much as the vocal talents. In this adaptation the orchestration is thin and balanced much lower than the vocalists, as if it were merely incidental music, making some of the poor singing (Russel Crowe, Sasha Baron Cohen, and Helena Bonham Carter) that much more painful to listen to.
1616550414|5.0|What can I say about one of the greatest video game franchises in history?...nothing really other than the obvious on how great it is.<br /><br />Although I can say that Hyrule Historia is the best book I have ever read about the Zelda franchise. It has a TON of stuff for you to read. Most famously, the official timeline. This has been the most sought after issue of the franchise ever since the catalyst ending of Ocarina of Time. Well this book might surprise you on where each specific game is placed in the timeline.  It has other neat stuff in it as well such as artwork, character descriptions, and more. I don't want to reveal too much since that might spoil the fun when you first read it. I highly recommend it.

B00CYFGCOW|5.0|The Furby BOOM is the second generation of the new versions of the Furby. They come in many cool colors and designs such as pink/polka dots, black white/zig zag, teal/peacock, etc. Furby's Boom technological features have also advanced been upgraded quite a bit since the previous version. The Furby Boom still comes equipped with led eyes that change shapes based on their expressions, moods and overall needs. You can customize your Furby's personality/attitude by how you treat him, this is not as simple or predictable as it sounds and the Furby Boom has twice as many responses as the original so it ensures that each Furby Boom will be unique to their owner and it's fun to watch over time. Some of the things you can do with your Furby are Feed him (with or without the Furby App), tickle him, Shake him, pull his tail (which now also works as a default sleep mode), play him music and so much more.<br /><br />My 6yr old loved her Furby but eventually over time and excessive play she wore it out so we bought her this one and she flipped out she was so excited! Her little 3yr old brother loves it as well and it keeps them both entertained for ages. The age is recommended for 6+ but the Furby Boom is extremely well built and quite durable, as long as you take care of them they would be the perfect entertainment for any child ages 3-16 so the Furby Boom would make a great gift for any child, boy or girl, young or teen.  And yes he burps!<br /><br />App Info Update*: As of November 3rd 2013 The Furby Boom App and original Furby app is  compatible with both Apple Ipod's or Ipads and Android Systems. To download on Android tablets/phones just go to the Google Store. The App has lots of really cool new features such as collecting and hatching virtual Furblings (babies) to fill your city. You can raise virtual Furblings and play games together also create virtual food, furby checkups, showers and more.
1449305172|5.0|In my opinion, Ash Maurya is one of the greatest minds in the startup world. In this book Ash drives you from concept to practical tactics regarding how to apply Lean actions to build a product. Among with names like Eric Reis and Alexander Osterwalder, Ash Maurya is a must read for all entrepreneur building a new company from the ground-up.<br /><br />One of the thinks I like most is how he identify the real key points a startup company should be concerned of. Take as an example his approach to the Lean Canvas in comparison with Osterwalder's BMG Canvas. While both are very practical and work for any company, the Lean canvas seems to address the real deal for startups.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Eric

006202406X|1.0|I admit I went into \\"Allegiant\\" with a negative bias against it. \\"Divergent\\" and \\"Insurgent\\" were good--but they aren't my favorite books ever. Probably not even in the Top 25. That being said, I did want to finish the series and see how things would all work out, because many aspects of the first two books were very intriguing, especially the (obvious) revelation at the end of the second book.<br /><br />We start \\"Allegiant\\" with no sense of where we are. How long has it been since the end of Book 2? Pssh. Who knows? It's never stated. All we know is summer is ending. That no sense of time continues throughout the entire book. At one point we are told \\"it has been a few weeks\\" since an attack that occurs over halfway through the book, but it feels like four days, maximum. Later we are told there will be an attack in \\"48 hours time,\\" but I counted three days. Then we blast ahead 2.5 years and things are all out of whack.<br /><br />Next, the entire book beats us over the head with this \\"be brave\\" message. Over. And over. And over. And over. About sacrificing yourself for the greater good and blah blah blah. And it wasn't implicitly suggested at all, like a good book would've accomplished--no, we are TOLD, multiple times, about bravery. It wasn't a theme, it was literally written word-for-word every few pages. Imagine someone slapping you over the head yelling, \\"BRAVERY IS SELF-SACRIFICE!!!\\" That's what this felt like, and that's what was literally said at some parts.<br /><br />Next comes the contrived scenes. You know, when things go EXACTLY ACCORDING TO PLAN? Yeah, that didn't just happen once, or twice...it happened throughout the entire book. And these weren't intricate, complicated plans. These were slashing tires and the guys driving the trucks don't even care. Like, seriously. I nearly put the book down when the driver basically said, \\"Bummer. Oh well!\\" Yeah.<br /><br />For the last part of my review, I'm going to focus on the dual-perspective between Tris and Tobias. IT DIDN'T WORK. Take everything you know about Tobias and throw it out the window. His personality COMPLETELY changes. He and Tris were VERY annoying. He literally describes EVERY. LITTLE. DETAIL. I'm not saying that people don't do that. I'm not saying he shouldn't. But those moments when he would take two whole paragraphs to describe the expression on someone's face? Yeah, completely unnecessary and boring. Tris was Tris. Together they were self-righteous, full of themselves, thinking they're the best things to ever happen in the world. And based on interviews, I feel like Veronica Roth feels that way about these books, too. She's not a humble author by any means, and that clearly leaked into this book.<br /><br />To wrap things up, \\"Allegiant\\" made me angry. It did. There was NO climax. Seriously, it DID NOT EXIST. This was the DIVIDE BY ZERO ERROR of books. I got to page 500 thinking, \\"If the bullets don't start flying in the next paragraph, then this book was a complete waste of time.\\" And guess what? The bullets never flew.<br /><br />If you expected an action-packed thriller like \\"Divergent\\" and \\"Insurgent,\\" you will be disappointed. Nothing big happens. No great power struggle. A let down of a finale. An insult to a decent series.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Lets get this straight. It is a great concept. However, coming from a roku device and other streaming devices, it is limited to what it offers. You can only stream you tube videos, Netflix and Google play movies. That is it. For 20 dollars more you can get a Roku device that has everything, hulu, Netflix,you tube, crackle and so much more. I think I will try this again when Google definitely updates this device with more streaming capabilities and is not limited.  So if you currently own a streaming device that does more then what i have described, I would definitely wait to make this purchase. I returned it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read the entire Wool Omnibus Edition and was absolutely blown away! I've now finished the entire series of books and started reading them again now that I know how the story ends (also amazing). While I'm reading it a second time, I'm noticing so many details that I missed before because I was racing through the story to find out what happened next. Now, I'm picking up on the clues, the foreshadowing and the poetic way he describes scenes and emotions in the books. I am a HUGE fan of every book in this series. If you haven't read it yet, I envy that you get to read it for the first time. If you have read it, read it again. You will be surprised. It is almost if there is another book underneath it. Very similar to Sixth Sense - the movie was great to begin with but so many scenes took on new meaning once you got to the end. (And, since I know you read these reviews... Thanks for sharing this story Hugh! I'm your biggest fan:)
B0000C9V3T|5.0|Again, perfect is the offer of CD ROM and MP3, I can enjoy it on my computers and in the car. Perfect muscial product. Thanks.
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|Not bad, not great.  All depends how you like the series.  We both fell asleep but we were both tired.  The BR, DVD and Digital Copy package is nice so that everyone can use.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I wanted to love it... I had such high hopes. And then it just fell flat. It was so anticlimactic. I really wish she chose a different ending
B009H7SCMA|5.0|This was a fabulous book and uniquely entertaining.  It's refreshingly original, funny, extremely sexy (but not overly vulgar) and kept me turning pages from the start.  Alan Hardy is a very talented and accomplished writer who knows what he is doing, effortlessly drawing in the reader to his story and maintaining their attention to the end.  It is a clever book also and packed with lust, sexy scenes, devious frolics and the perfect blend of satirical humour which was right up my street.  This book will appeal to lots of people and is one of my favourite books of the year!  More please.  Five stars.
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|Could not put it down!Highly recommend this book to others.Great way for it to end.  Did not see it ending that way.
B00F0N7JUG|4.0|I have to admit I was duped. From the initial pictures, I'd assumed that the collections edition of Pacific Rim had a statue of the Gypsy Dancer mecha. I didn't realize until I received it that the mecha is actually the case that holds the DVD's. Fortunately, my enthusiasm at getting to watch the movie kept me from feeling disappointed. As I though about it, I realized the case is actually pretty cool as well - it certainly  gets everyone attention when they see it on the shelf.<br /><br />As to the movie...well, you either like giant mecha fighting Godzilla-like monsters or not. I've loved the genre ever since I lived in Japan in the early 1970's. The movie is great, and so is the case -- but it is a case, not a statue, in the box! Because the description wasn't clear on that point, I'm giving this item 4 portal-destroying nuclear weapons out of 5.
0385537131|5.0|This is John Grisham's finest novel.  I read the last page not wanting to leave Ford County.  Recognizing that racism in the United States of America is not dead, Mr. Grisham reveals the the soul of America that knows no color or creed.  His characters are true to themselves and their heritage.  Even at their worst they betray a streak of humanity.  There is implicit love in this story.
B005LAIIMG|5.0|WORLD WAR Z ROCKS. IT IS A GREAT MOVIE FOR ALL AGES EVEN 10 YEAR OLDS WILL LOVE IT. IT IS NOT REALLY THAT GORY BUT IT IS ACTION PACKED. BRAD PITT DOES A GREAT JOB PLAYING BOTH DAD AND HERO. IT IS JUST OVERALL A GREAT MOVIE. IT REALLY IS NOTHING LIKE THE PREVIEWS YOU WILL BE VERY SURPRISED BY THE ENDING. I LOVED THIS MOVIE.
