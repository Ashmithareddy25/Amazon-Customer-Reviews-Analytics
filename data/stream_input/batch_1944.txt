B007THA4FI|4.0|While I found it a hard read in the beginning it turned out to be a mystery and heart break in the end. I look forward to reading more from this author.
B0016BPWNM|5.0|This movie was a Christmas gift.  The recipient loved them and was excited to have a copy on blu ray  rather than VHS. She said she can definitely tell a difference between the two versions (VHS vs blu ray)
B009HELT3C|3.0|Occasionally some funny, almost charming - if not quite clever enough - dialogue.  For the rest, it's a visual one liner devoid of the surprise that buttressed the precedents of this now tired franchise .
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|i saw this is 5 star rating and so i tried it out and now i definetly see why. its amazing!! i bless the day this was invented!! :)

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I totally thought I was  immune to feeling butterflies and  giddiness from a book, because  I kept reading  several and no book  really did it for me. THIS book, however, did it for me! It brought back  the butterflies! Such a cute love story with the perfect  touch of witty and an amazing plot! So many twists...none of which I expected!  A must read!
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|Sherlock Holmes A Game of Shadows:  It is just as great as I expected. thanks we enjoyed watching it again.  Thanks so much
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|This novella was a short but deft work by Brandon Sanderson.<br /><br />The characters were well realized and Sanderson has another of his characteristic magic systems which is both inventive and well structured.<br /><br />The story moved along at a quick pace and there was even some a took towards the end.<br /><br />Although this story takes place in the same world as Elantris, it is stand alone but also serves to further develop the Cosmere.<br /><br />I hope Brandon picks up some of the threads in future novels.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|fabulous movie. kids love it .. have watched several times.great great great great.... it was a great movie to watch
034580404X|5.0|I am someone that reads in chunks. Due to my work and personal schedule, like most, I rarely have a block of time to read. With this story, you are going to want to. Also, you are going to want to have the next book ready on hand when you finish the other one. Lastly, I heard so much before ready the series about how it saved sex lives and it was written very provocatively.  I don't get the sex life savior part, but it is written in great detail; although each orgasm sounds very similar to the one prior. With all that, the story itself is what kept me reading. A tangled web of individual disfunction with only dreamt about chemistry and lust with a touch of friendship and family happenings. I'd definitely encourage to read and buy the entire series.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|got this for my daughter. she likes these types of movies, so we watched it several times over the CHRISTMAS break.
B008J34466|5.0|This CD is great.  PINK is at her best. The REMIX on songs allows you to listen during varying moods.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|As much fun to read as the tv show is to watch.  Will definitely keep reading the series.  Will we ever find out who the author is?
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Love the CD. This girl is so stinkin talented and she has a song on the album for every mood. I'm so glad I purchased.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|It's definitely worth a read but still not my favourite book. If it had followed only one or two story lines I would have liked it better.
B007B6VOG0|4.0|and since I was a fan... 4 thumbs up!!!  Has both current pop chart hits, and they are Fun to the max...
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Perfect solution for travel. Honestly I got it because it was free, but later realized it has a nice alarm a few different choices for display, and it just works. Nice Job.

B00AMBH70S|5.0|Went with my husband to view this film, and found it worth a second viewing.  We will probably add it to our DVD library

B008AX1HD8|4.0|Great to finally get the first story to put Harry into perspective.  The ending was a little ordinary, but overall I enjoyed the read.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Looking at the story from two alternating perspectives is an interesting construct.  Kept me up reading late at night, which is rare for me.  Highly recommended if you like mysteries.
0547884591|5.0|What more do you really need to know? Even if you ignore the cool meta-learning sections, the book paid for itself many times over because: I can cook now. I couldn't before. I make tasty stuff, and it's because of this book.<br /><br />I'm also going hunting at the end of the year to harvest a deer and eat it thanks to this book. Those will be firsts for me, and I'm really excited.
B0059XTTW8|4.0|How do you make a LeCarre movie to match his books?  The novels are so great.  Gary Oldman is perfect as Smiley.  And I think they really did a good job overall with this movie.  It is suspenseful and you truly like Smiley and admire him deeply.
030745455X|4.0|You must see or read The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo first.  The film  is in Swedish, I think.  I was busy reading the subtitles.
B00006GO9Q|4.0|I love Miles Davis.  This CD really shows you some of his earlier stuff.  It is great music.  It's not his stellar stuff like on Kinda Blue, Milestones or Round About Midnight, but great Miles Davis.  If you like Miles you should definitely own this.
B008YWY0HK|2.0|I was looking forward to this movie as a father of two girls, because there are not enough children's movies with female leads especially non-princess female leads, and until now Pixar has always made excellent and touching movies (or at least enjoyable when in the case of Cars 2). I thought Pixar could make a movie about a female lead where the plot doesn't revolve around whether or not she gets married but apparently not. There are decisions that women face throughout their lives other than whether or not to marry. I also assumed that they could give a female character the lead while having respectable male supporting characters but they couldn't. Every single male character in this movie is a physically deformed half-wit mutant. The only halfway like able male characters are Merida's father and brothers and they're still portrayed as immature morons. The brothers are barely portrayed as humans. They never speak and spend the entire movie stealing food and never show any emotional reaction to any of the bizarre events that freak out everyone else.  At one point they get turned into bears but nothing about them changes except for they grow fur. The previews made it look like an epic adventure but most of the movie takes place in the castle and most of the action is comedic misunderstandings and deceptions. What I thought was going to be an epic adventure starring a female lead turned out to be a cliched 90's girl power comedy of errors.<br /><br />If the movie had only been disappointing then I would have given it 3 stars but there was far to much nudity in it for me to consider it appropriate for small children. In one scene we several men's butts for several seconds and in another we see Merida's brothers butts. My children did not think this was shocking. They actually thought it was funny which is a problem in my opinion. It is very difficult to explain context to children. They see nudity in a cartoon as comedy their going to think that nudity in other situations is comedy too and I doubt very many people consider a man exposing his butt to children as comedy. Most people would consider him a pervert and he could go to prison and be registered as a sex offender for the rest of his life. My wife and I already have a hard enough time trying to convince our daughters that exposing their butts to us is inappropriate without Disney and Pixar telling them it's comedy. Luckily our girls haven't  exposed themselves at school to get a laugh but as more cartoons show nudity as comedy more kids will expose themselves in public thinking that makes them funny.<br /><br />Brave isn't the only children's cartoon to do this either. Why is it every children's cartoon that shows someone's butt for comedy shows a man's or boy's butt. Brave seemed to try very hard to come up with situations to show every male character naked and to cover up the female character the one time she would have been naked. Why is male nudity comedy gold while female nudity is inappropriate?
B00003CXC7|5.0|The more I watch Alfred Hitchcock, particularly movies like this one, it just shows how much cinema has lost by trying to be too explicit and trying to use to many special effects.  This movie is creepy, suspenseful, and yet in it's own way cute.  I wanted to see it because I read that this was the movie that the movie Disturbia was based on, which was very suspenseful.  I think what is so impressive with this movie is that once again, like with The Birds, and Psycho, Alfred Hitchcock presents it in a way that you can see it is something that is plausible.  Whereas most creepy movies you know they really aren't.  Plus he lets your imagination work more.  This is a true classic.
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|EXCELLENT ALBUM, THERE IS NO BETTER FOLLOW UP TO THE SOUND OF MADNESS THAN THIS! THE SONGS ARE WELL PUT TOGETHER AND THE LYRICAL CONTENT TAKES YOUR MIND FOR A RIDE, NOT TO MENTION BRENT'S VOICE IS POWERFUL AND YET SO MELLOW...I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. SHINEDOWN HASN'T STOPPED AMAZING ME...
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Garth Stein has a huge hit with this book.  My husband and I both read it and were very touched and will not forget it anytime soon.  Mr Stein certainly has a way with words and the feelings they produce.  We didn't want it to end.  Wonderful characters and dialogue, can't say enough about this book.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I'm 21 years old and found this to be a good fun read. Didn't realize how depressing it would be at times, but was very thought-provoking.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|It is a fun read, very adventurous. It would definitely be a good beach book! I have already per-ordered the sequel.

0553584537|3.0|This book is a quick read, a suspenseful book.  It's a good beach book, you could maybe see Jason Statham in a movie of this book.  It it's no literary masterpiece but it is entertaining.  Quickly forgotten though.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|this is a great app. tell you exactly what is available and you can use it to connect to a network as well. shows which signal is best, what protection the networks have, and more.
B007THA4FI|5.0|J.K Rowling shows once again that one of her greatest gifts is how she develops the characters to be so real.  This book is NOT Harry Potter, it is a book for adults.  It is so well written.
B008KYOCA2|3.0|this was an ok calendar but did not have everything I was looking for. it was not as easy as I hoped to enter information. for my families wide range of needs I eventually wound up with cozi instead.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|Although I only gave it a 3 I did really enjoy it.  It is a book made up of different stories.  Some of the stories I would rate a 5 and some only a 2 which makes it hard to rate this book.  I will say it wasn't until I was about 25% of the way through the book until I really got into it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gillian does a wondrefull job in seducing the reader to each main character perspective. You want to keep an out side perspective, be the Reader, but you just can´t. They grab your mind, twist it and only give it back when the chapter is over...
1451695195|5.0|Over the years, there have been many near death and out of body experience books and accounts. But this one is different in that Eban Alexander is highly educated and a trained neurosurgeon rather than a New Age seeker. Eban tells his story from the heart with compassion, sincerity and intelligence and not without professional risk. As someone who has always known that this life is temporary and there is so much that is unknown about consciousness and life itself, this was a genuinely insightful and uplifting read. Enjoy.
1454701250|5.0|Great ideas, wonderful artist and just what I needed to get new inspiration! I hope Geninne will make more books!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I enjoyed this movie very much.  As a singer heading towards the end of my good years I am glad to know that the next generation still cares about good music, singing, creativity etc.... the cast is very talented.  The music is fun.  I could have done without the gross out humor, but that's just me.  Rebel Wilson was as good as you have heard and Anna Kendrick is a delight.  If you want to spend an hour and a half being charmed and listening to some good a capella singing, rent this movie.
1607050072|5.0|This book shows how simple it can be to make something pretty. Wonderful ideas and very beautiful colors and fabrics.
B00846REIS|5.0|I just finished the second book of this series and I can't wait for the third. The books are one of the best I read so far and believe me I have read a lot of books. I think these are better then the fifty shades series. Great job!
B003O86FMW|4.0|My wife tilde me that this book wasn't as good,but I disagree.  I found the political aspects exciting and the character building to be as good or better than the first book. It will probably make a good movie.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I just finished this book and I have to say these are about the best books I read. I could not put the book down. The character and plot was great it kept you guessing until the end. I can't wait until the third one comes out. I think this series is better the the fifty shades series.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This movie was hilarious. Non stop laughter. The singing was amazing. Some people categorize this movie as a musical. I DO NOT. I do not watch musicals. This movie was truly a great movie to watch.
B005DF2QMC|1.0|I had used a different brand of converter and had gotten at least 40 hours of use out of it.  I thought I would try the DB tech one since the price was about the same.  When I received the unit, it was heavier than my old one.  I thought that might mean that it was more substantial and would last longer.  The unit functioned for about three hours and then no more.  I was sorely disappointed and sent it back.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|If you watch the movie, then you will definitely like this CD. I listen to it over and over and crack up because I remember what happened in the movie with each particular song. Great buy!!
B0050CQY1W|4.0|This was a great product. It arrived on time. There were a few cracks on the case itself, but other than that it came with a sample of her fragrance. Brand new and wrapped properly.
1451673442|5.0|Very inspiring and easy to understand. The book really motivates you to think and to be grateful for what you have.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Fresh new sound can't wait to hear more from this up and coming new artist. A must buy to listen to up coming new voice
B004SKQAJI|5.0|I've always been a fan of Michael Flatley as a flute player but never had the opportunity to see him dance. I saw this movie in the theater in 3-D and it was astounding!! It was wonderful to watch this blu-ray and see such a superb performance again!! Superb!! I would recommend this to anybody who is a fan of dance, Irish music, theater, or all of the above.

B008NMT684|5.0|My 2 year old loves trucks and puzzles--so this app was perfect! He enjoys completing the puzzles and then popping all the balloons.  Probably good for 2 and 3 year olds. Older kids may thinks it's too easy and boring.

0920668372|5.0|Purchased two of these for my two newborns so their mom can read it to them. Haven't personally read the book cover to cover but my one daughter in law loved it so much it brought her to tears. Think I better take a minute to read. Its a &#34;forever&#34; book, not something you'll find at a garage sale.
B003B02O14|5.0|This is his best book. Can not there has not been a movie. The ending makes you say wow. Great
B001JIFYSA|1.0|Just a bit too over the top on certain scenes for decent viewing.  would not recommend if sensitive to these things.
B009NT0I06|4.0|Sounds amazing on Vinyl! But come on Taylor, This is the most expensive version of your album!<br />Give us a digital download!
030758836X|3.0|Not worth the money.  This book was ok but not good enough to win an award.  Just your everyday mediocre book.  No likeable characters and stupid ending.  The book was trying to be modern and hip but it really lacked any emotion or interest.
B006RZZ9YY|5.0|Perfect for my kids 5 and 7 y old.  Colorful, good music (Elvis Presley), bad guys not scary. a good movie night and a good night without nigthmares after.
B000ICXQXI|5.0|I went to see the 2012 movie \\"Hitchcock\\" this weekend which included the making of \\"Paycho\\". The next day I had to rent This 1960 movie. Was amazed about the influence that Hitchcock and his wife had on movie making. Enjoyed both movies. My how times have changed!!!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|OMG ok I love waking up to my fav song Red by Taylor swift. but do I have to plug it in at nite so it wont waste battery but awesome app
B0081JPTCQ|1.0|this app is worthless.  the reason I payed a dollar for this dumb app was because I like writing my own notes...this app allows that, BUT when your writing works..which half the time it doesn't, it doesn't let you fit much...there is lined backgrounds but there is no way it will let you write that small from a phone...and my phone had a huge screen...I uninstalled this app after ten minutes of struggling to write a short grocery list.  seriously save your dollar for a pack of gum.
B008OJ291W|1.0|first of all another best of is not needed. second is that remakes of songs are awful.<br />dont bother wasting money on this.
B006ZZANG0|5.0|Rufus is very very good across all levels. I hoep he continues to offer accessible songs and tunes and doesn't go off the deep end.
B003O86FMW|3.0|It was a good book not really my favorite. At the end I got a little lost. I would recommend to mom.
B0049P1VHS|3.0|.<br /><br />I have enjoyed this show because I hanker now and then for good zombie- and post-apocalypse stories.  And this show delivers pretty well on those counts.<br /><br />That's why I tolerate the sometimes terrible writing.  Without giving away anything important, I'll give an example.  During one episode in one of the three seasons I've watched, there is a very small town of fifty or sixty survivors who have managed to set up a good perimeter to keep out the zombies and get back a semblance of half-decent living.  An old man in the community is about to die from cancer, and has volunteered for an experiment.  After he dies, he will be restrained and allowed to turn into a zombie (sort of an undead, human-flesh-eating ghoul).  Running the experiment is a person who seems to be sort of bookish and nerdy -- perhaps he was a technician or researcher of some sort before the apocalypse -- he will test the old-man-become-zombie to see if the zombie can remember anything from the old man's life.  They want to see if there is anything human left in the unconscious mind of the zombie. Okay, so, old man dies.  They put restraints on him.  The corpse turns to zombie, starts growling.  The researcher asks a question to the zombie. So far so good.  I have no problem with the plot so far.<br /><br />Next, the zombie moves his hands in the restraints, tries to lift his mouth to bite the researcher.  The researcher now turns to the other person in the room and says -- \\"We've got to take off the restraints!  We've paralyzed his mind!\\" And quickly undoes the arm restraints.  (I won't give away what happens next, and it's not relevant to my point.)<br /><br />I'm sorry, but do the writers really take their audience to be that stupid?  Or is it the writers who are stupid? Consider.  The bookish nerdy techie guy knows that if he is bitten, he will have to be quickly killed, because once bitten, you soon turn into a zombie raring to eat people alive.  The bookish nerdy techie knows very well how dangerous zombies are.  He knows how they behave.  The whole of life revolves around surviving in the face of zombies.  But suddenly, he gets the brilliant idea to demand that the restraints be taken off immediately, because he believes that will allow the zombie to better communicate.  Furthermore, the techie doesn't want to even think it over, or try to discuss it.  No, he rushes to remove the restraints, and not with a ten foot pole, but close enough so the zombie might be able to take a bite out of him.  The other person in the room tries to intervene and demand that the techie guy not remove the restraints, but techie guy just doesn't have even a minute to stop and consider whether removing the restraints is really a good idea.<br /><br />Now, that is so far from believable it's actually annoying to watch.  Obviously the writers just wanted an excuse for something scary to happen.  I'm fine with scary, but not if it only happens through idiotic writing.  Can't the writers find a better way to get where they want to go?  One way the writers could have sort of saved the scene, perhaps:  if the second person in the room, observing the techie rushing to remove the restraints, responded in part by screaming in shock, \\"Are you out of your mind?  Are you a total idiot?!!!\\"  Then if it turned out the techie guy indeed had a screw loose or was a moron, the scene would make some sense.<br /><br />But the scene did not make sense, it was just stupid.  Now, imagine such unbelievable stupidities proliferating like the zombies in the show.  I realize that the whole premise of the show is strictly speaking unbelievable fantasy -- but good fiction often makes the unbelievable plausible -- that's part of the fun of it.  One chooses willfully to suspend one's disbelief, because the thing is well-enough done to enchant.  But it's hard to suspend one's disbelief if a story virtually shouts at you \\"hey, look how idiotically unbelievable this writing is!\\"<br /><br />I sometimes enjoy emotional or sentimental drama, so long as it's at least somewhat intelligent, but one reason I gave this show only three stars is because, at certain points -- I don't recall whether this started in the first season, or the second season, thankfully the third season does relatively little of this -- the characters get into the most annoyingly unbelievable -- especially given the whole zombie context -- pointlessly emotional conflict scenes that make no sense or make sense only by the primitive logic of bad writing.  This makes one start to revile some of the characters for their non-sensical emotions and behavior given the situation.  The conflicts tended to go on for a tortuously extended period.  The emptily intense dialogue, perhaps particularly between the main character and his wife, was sometimes almost impossible to endure, both tedious and provocatively stupid at once (at least in the second season).  I found myself hoping the wife would get eaten by a zombie.  I don't blame the actress.  The writers (and directors?) have so frequently invested her with false and idiotic emotions and intensity, to the extent that you can't look at her face anymore, because it so embodies the aspect of the show that is so annoyingly stupid.<br /><br />But despite the sometimes terrible writing, this show is still definitely very much worth a gander if you like zombie-post-apocalypse stuff.  The fact that this show is fun despite the sometimes terrible writing is a testimony to the power of post-apocalyptic zombie mythology.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|I ordered this one and it did not work.<br />I have an android and saw no way to exchange to get the correct version.<br /><br />pay attention.
0451228375|5.0|admittedly I am a huge Follett fan and World Without End only enhanced that sentiment. I loved the characters and their development.The time period truly made me appreciate being a women in the 21st century.Have read it twice....so far.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Amazing graphics. Great sound effects. Lots of levels. I've played through all the levels and am going back through to beat my own times. Don't know what the reviewer was talking about when he said it's a social media game...it's not. It's just a great matching game. And it was free. Love it!
B004DM0UII|4.0|Nice little android web radio app. Unfortunately it is competing with Pandora which is the Cadillac of web radio apps.
B00A6N7BS0|1.0|This movie was so bad that I turned it off about 15 minutes into it. I'm sorry that I paid to rent this horrible movie.
B003JTHWPA|4.0|forgot how wonderful this book is. Read it many years ago and am now revisiting, amazing how the old classics hold over time.
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|This was a funny movie. It gets a little weird but it definitely made me laugh out loud several times. I haven't had a movie do that in quite a long time.
B0095XPZBC|5.0|This review is for the Blu-Ray release.<br /><br />I'm sure you've seen people complaining that this release was grainy, low quality, or otherwise not that great.  Well, partially, they're right.  There are some scenes that look grainier than others, or effects shots that don't look as good as the rest.  It's noticeable, but still looks 100 times better than the DVD.  Plus, the shots are few and far between.  But there are scenes that looked like garbage before and look amazing now, so take the bad with the good.  Are there any other decades-old TV series getting this kind of treatment?  I think not!<br /><br />However, I'm not deducting any stars for any graininess because of two things:  Firstly, the film stock, as of this writing, is 25 years old.  Of course it's not going to look like it was shot yesterday!  These releases are literally a &#34;Film Restoration Project&#34; and not claiming to be shot yesterday.  Secondly, I popped in my DVD copy of &#34;Q Who&#34; (A fairly effects heavy episode) and then watched the Blu-Ray copy.  The difference is night and day.  There is no comparison between the two.  Seeing the colors now the way they should have looked when the episodes first aired makes it all worth it.<br /><br />All of the special features are amazing.  This includes the DVD special features, taking you around warehouses and looking at shooting models and hearing little niche stories about minute things seriously makes these Blu-Rays worth the price.  Not to mention the hour-long cast reunion where they share some intimate moments (Marina cries!) about fan interactions.<br /><br />In short, the release is outstanding in all departments.  Don't listen to the people who are sitting inches from their televisions and counting the pixels or something, just sit back and enjoy this absolutely stunning restoration of season two.  It may not be as strong as the later seasons but there are a lot of really good episodes in this season, especially the extended cutof &#34;The Measure of a Man&#34; which was, and still is, outstanding.  Get it, and enjoy.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|Emma Stone is one of my favorite new actresses, and this is the first movie that I was introduced to her. She is absolutely hilarious, and I'd recommend that anyone who loves comedy should watch this(although it's got a little bit of raunchiness to it.)
B004TJ1H3C|3.0|I really enjoyed watching both seasons of SGU.  When I got to the last episode I was looking at the clock and was wondering how they are going to end it because there was not much time left in the episode and then it was over.  The ending left me(and others if you read other reviews) with a LOT of questions.  If there would have been closure then I would have ranked it much higher.
B004BBDHEK|5.0|Another great album from Yanni with new songs.  If you love Yanni's music, you won't be disappointed when you listen to this CD.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|THIS BOOK REMINDED ME OF DOWNTON ABBEY IN THAT THE CHARACTERS COME TO LIFE, ,AND THIS IS BACKDROPPED IN A HISTORICAL SETTING.  I DID NOT WANT TO PUT THE BOOK DOWN BECAUSE I WAS SO ENGROSSED IN CHARACTERS AND SETTINGS.  CAN'T WAIT TO READ 2ND BOOK
B00786XVOG|5.0|This CD/DVD set is great and contains new and old songs.  The live concert event at El Morro is well done.  If you've ever seen Yanni in concert, then this is a must have.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|Pretty funny movie. Will watch again if I ever get a chance. Would also recommend other to see this movie.
B005LAIHQS|4.0|This one they musta taken a while to do, seening as how bas MIB 2 was, I liked the way they did the wibbley-wobbley timey-whimey with the past and how it affected J. Just a really great movie all around
B008Y73XTQ|5.0|I was reading &#34;Steel Boats - Iron Hearts&#34; by Hans Goebeler when I came across this movie.  It is exactly as Hans Goebeler described in his book.  It is so realistic you can almost smell the sweat, fear, stink, ect.  It is probably one of the most accurate war movies ever filmed.  Get both the book and the movie.  Fantastic.
B00AW735QC|5.0|I was really taken in by the writers abilities to combine both horror and a sense of fun with the \\"Name Game\\". The wild twist and turns to the story line really keep me coming back for more and the acting is just wonderful. It is as if the actors and writers had a canvas and are at liberty to be creative. I never know what will come next. A job well done to everyone.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|The movie was wonderful , very mesmerizing , really enjoyed the new take on the old show ,  would watch again in a minute .
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I had read the reviews of this series & it is as good as I thought it would be. I can't wait to get season 2!
B009NQKPUW|3.0|The build up for the movie was much more than the movie itself turned out to be ., in essecense it was a letdown
B005VPRGB0|5.0|My son and I had a good time putting this together. another great set from lego. I would reccommend it to anyone
B0091REZMW|4.0|I also play this game on Facebook. This version is much more fun. I like that the items are never in the same place when you play the room again. If you like hidden object games, try this one.
0786962984|4.0|The rules are a little clunky, but it is a fun game. My whole family enjoyed playing it  and we will play it often.
B0026IPAJA|4.0|Digital copy!<br />Wonderful, loved it and glad to have had it will be adding more of the digital copies to my library.
1451695195|5.0|Unbelievable, yet totally believable, changed my life in every single way. I would highly recommend this book for anyone and everyone.. Makes you think twice about all you do.. Life is short. Enjoy.
B004YM6JLO|4.0|Great value, loved the style and was really cheap. Like less than half price cheap. Packed well too. Person I gave it too, loved it.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|So captivating and the characters are all very thought out. I didn't want it to end. But it was a sad but beautiful ending.
B005LAJ212|5.0|Gave to my daughter for Christmas. She was so excited. I do not know if she has opened it or watched it yet.
B008VBYN80|5.0|this game is very fun and addicting.  this game is very nice with Color  and is very simple!  just don't waste all your money on diamonds!
1565847032|5.0|We are very satisfied with the purchase we made to recieve the book Understanding Power by Noam Chomsky great book!!!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved this book. Easy read...read it in 2 days and I only get time to read at night. It flowed easily and kept my attention.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Homeland is an awesome show - so addicting! Carrie and Nick Brodie are awesome characters, well-developed. I couldn't just watch one episode and turn it off, watched the whole season through. Worth a watch!
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Not much on TV is worth even 2 stars. Everyone everywhere should with this. It really is a great show.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Better that Im expected. I like alot that product, It cand be customaize totally and its not too expensive.<br />Generally good product.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Great book, read it twice.  Very thought provoking.  I read it on my android.  Enjoyable experience.  Glad I have it.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I like this game but I hate waiting 30 seconds for a coin when I run out. So I found a couple other games and I go back and forth so I have coins waiting when I'm ready to play again.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This game is perfect.  Me and my son loved interacting with his own stickman and seeing &quot;The search for dad&quot; on the front. The magic pencils are what my son calls, &quot;epic.&quot; You did a great job. A five star app.
B001BKTEZA|5.0|This book is just as irrelevant now as it was upon inception. Another literary masterpiece by Steinbeck, if not his best.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|I don't know about waking up; this book put me to sleep. Boring after only a few pages, unbelievable dialogue and plot. Truly awful.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I'm not a book reader at all but this book it had me totally lost hanging on to every single word I was on the edge of my seat never seeing the twisted end at all!
B0091LS07E|5.0|Mmmmmmm, Alicia is at her best. Love driving even more than usual. The CD arrived promptly as was promised and would use this vendor again.
B004QX07G4|5.0|I thought this book was comically brilliant and gut-wrenching hilarious! Ellen's sense of humor allows for all ages to be thoroughly entertained and enlightened.
B004K00NMG|5.0|We loved this movie when we were young and still do today :-)<br />Animations scale perfectly for blu-ray and high definition; this is a must-own DVD in my opinion.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I have not seen this movie yet only of the trailer..looks so cute and I bought one for my 30 year old daughter actually...she has auburn hair, and loves cute movies and has her first house so I thought it'd be cute to buy this in addition to some other type movies so that she can build a library of movies in her new home of all kinds....it looked so cute in the trailer I watched on amazon that I ended up ordering one for our family as well....I cant wait to watch it with the kids soon.  Shipping was timely as well as good packaging thank you:)
B008518MOW|4.0|This was a great movie! I liked that they went back in time to show how Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith became partners-I liked Josh Brolin as the young Tommy Lee! I recommend this movie! I haven't even seen MIB 2 yet but you don't need to in order to understand what's going on.
B00AXVZXBC|5.0|Just started watching Once Upon a Time this weekend and it is becoming my favorite show of the New Year a 5 star viewing experience for sure And They Lived Happily Ever After
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Alex and Katie find each other when they both need each other the most.  The sweet thing about this story is Mr. Sparks takes his time with the story telling but it doesn't drag out.  The romance is a good old fashion one.<br /><br />The ending has action, redemption and a shocking twist.  Mr.Sparks does not disappoint once again.
B005L3HKTU|2.0|It's strange, Insomnium's albums usually sound so clean and crisp, with many musical layers able to be heard. This is possibly their worst album, not any fault of the musicians, but because the mixing is so muddy. The CD needs a remaster!
B0099G7KDQ|4.0|Each Mumford and Sons album has about 5 songs I really like and about 5 songs I really feel ambivalent about.  But I enjoy them and their sound.  I am tired of bubble gum music, and I like alternative.  The banjo kicks it I love that part!!!
B008M36EEI|3.0|Rented this because it was nominated for some awards and my wife is a journalist covering the Award shows.  From beginning to end this movie was very predictable and provided few surprises.  The characters never really developed to a point that you care deeply about them or their plight.  The subject matter is a bit droll as well.  We all know that if you dump enough money into something you can make it happen, and this movie tries to make salmon fishing in Yemen inspiring, but its not.  Its a caricature of what the mideast has come to symbolize: extravagance of the super-rich.  This film makes a caricature out of the media industry and politics as well showcasing how people manipulate events to their advantage for short term selfish gain.  You end the movie wondering if you learned anything new and realize you did not.  I rated it 3 stars because I like Ewan MCGregor and enjoyed his performance.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Dude dude d d d d d ebb d  f2f d  Dr d  f2f d d ebb d d seeds d das d d d.  Fhdbdh
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is intense,but is the beginning of a great love story. This is a must read. Very erotic !
B0038P59A0|4.0|Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law are great together.  An great portrayal of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.  Really enjoyed the movie.
B008VO3PA4|5.0|LOL for any cat lover!! I brought it as a kindle and went to bookstore to buy copies for my friends.  It is so funny!!!
B00024I2Z4|4.0|Package arrived and had to be signed for, although no tracking information had been provided. DVD was in stated excellent shape and included a print out page of how to safely clean DVDs.
B009CGYO0K|2.0|This book is not as funny as &#34;Pee on This.&#34;  Don't get the kindle version because it is hard to see to see the cartoon pictures.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I love this story, have shown in several of my English classes.  Gives us an in dept view of far we have come with issues of racism and how far we have to go.  The students were completely silent.
B009PEKRY6|5.0|This album is truly awesome. My girls jam and sing along with the tunes daily. I even find myself listening as well. As a parent, you always have to listen before you give to the kids. Being she is a young lady from Disney, I didn't have to worry. But, when I was listening anyway, the songs were great.
B000002H97|5.0|excellent condition of the cd the case wasn't the best but I only wanted teh cd  I had previously lost my cd and glad to have anohter one
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is your basic Solitaire game. a fun way to pass the time. There is an ad between games that is easy to skip over.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A must read! Keeps you on the edge of your seat and wanting more! Can't wait to read the next two books!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a wonderful mind game.  It kept me busy all night long as I was waiting for the laundry to finish.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|My wife and daughter really wanted to see this.  Friday (our movie night) arrived, and Amazon has the movie a fair price.  My son and I joined the wife and daughter, and we made a night of it.<br /><br />Plot and flow of story, fairly typical, but it has a different feel to it.  I liked it, my wife liked it, my son and daughter loved it.<br /><br />What else can you ask for.
0756405890|5.0|I haven't read for enjoyment in a long number of years. The desire to change that, recomendation of a firend, a 9-hour flight, and this on the airport newsstand was enough motivation. I was completely engrossed before the first flight delay. Halfway through the vacation I finished this book and couldn't wait to get the second. Excelent book to get back into reading.
B006O6F932|5.0|Santa brought this to my 6 year old for Christmas this year. This dollhouse is like no other!! It is themed like a high school with a classroom and a cafeteria area and a mezzanine area. This house is super colorful and durable and keeps my daughter way occupied. I shopped around and waited for the great price I got here at Amazon. Highly recommend its unlike any other dollhouse you will see!!FUN!!
B004LWZWGK|4.0|I still love this flick, but it is easily the worst and most flawed in the Nolan series. It was obvious while watching, this was not the film even Nolan intended, but Ledgers death robbed us of the final film we all wanted. Still very good!
B004GYY714|5.0|This radio is perfect for the kitchen area - rock out while cooking.  It's compact and can fit anywhere.  The sound is great.
B002M9WW30|5.0|$20.00 for all the Rocky films!!!! Best deal ever!!! I even love Rocky 5, although I admit it what the worst in series.
0307719774|4.0|I love this book! I only started it a week ago, but looked through the questions and think they are great. It would've received at 5 star rating, but some of the questions are kind of repetitive (may not be the same, but get to the same point) and it doesn't have a ribbon to keep your place. I actually ended up gluing one in myself.<br /><br />Highly recommend
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Such an amazing read! I found myself not being able to put the book down and finished it in just one day.
B008OOYALE|4.0|It is fun to reach the goals, raise the dragons, and build up the islands.  I like that you can give and receive gifts at no cost to yourself.  I  also like that you can visit other islands and get ideas for yours.
B001D52XO2|5.0|Great overview of the musical journey of Nina Simone. Maybe not the most comprehensive but she recorded so much and for so many labels, I think that would be volumes. Wonderful rarities as well.
B002R88G5E|4.0|This book is absolutely intriguing and gripping. Kept me glued to the end. Brilliant work. Looking forward to reading the Kite Runner next:)
B008HK3XU4|4.0|I like the case a lot for my daughter.  It took me awhile to decide which one to get, though...<br /><br />Pros:  lightweight, easy to stand up (unlike many of the others)<br /><br />Cons: not protective at all (too flimsy to really protect the kindle), if there is a magnet... it is very weak, won't keep the case closed.<br /><br />Other than that... I like the case better than the one I got my son.  His has a better magnet which turns off the Kindle, but standing it up is a chore (pain in the butt, really).
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I found the movie very funny, better than I expected, there were a lot of laugh out loud moments. I really enjoyed it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I recommend to all especially women of all ages. I like all three books. SO can't we I t for the movies.
0060555661|5.0|This book is great for beginners. It lays out all the need to know details and much more. I suggest keeping this book for a long time and reading it more than once.
B008FRFN7A|4.0|Maybe because I have an HP printer, the ePrint was very easy to set up & print from my Kindle Fire to my HP printer.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I love this show. We waited too long to watch it. Now we are trying to catch up on the 3rd season.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Can't wait to go onto the next one!! Will be buying it right now!!  Their love story is captured in a whole new light than in the film.
B004SUWR2C|3.0|it seems to be slow response..more so than other games on the Kindle.  I thought it would improve, but has not.
B0065CCM76|5.0|Great sound-wonderful songs. Easy to listen to. Wonderful price.<br />So easy to download. This is hard to find so I was amazed at the price and the find
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I got this app for my kids and they love it, so they enjoy it when they play with it
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Does what is advertised and is light! The carbide sharpener puts a new edge on and the ceramic sharpener smooths and finishes the edge. A bonus is that the sharpening stones can be replaced in it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It is the best book I have ever read and I will definitely read it again and over and over again!
B00797MB0O|1.0|I entered into this movie thinking it was going to be a comedy and I don't think I laughed once the entire way through it. It's not a deep film. It's about a bitter has been woman who sees the end of her career looming ahead and suddenly longs for the good old days. Death to Smoochy is a dark comedy. This? This is a train wreck.<br /><br />Now, I have to concede that the acting is well done. It was very well portrayed for what it was but the bottom line of the film was just terrible. I kept waiting for it to get better cause no person that isn't deeply mentally unwell stays so down so long but nope, nothing. In the end of the film no one came full circle. No one learned anything.<br /><br />In fact, I could have dealt with it being bleak and a character study into someone mentally unwell. I could have written off that hour and a half of my life but what really upset me the most is that the movie ended with her using the one person who tried to help her throughout the film and just when she decides to change her delusion is reinforced by someone else. So after spending the entire film behaving badly and wallowing in her own delusions they end the film basically having someone condone what she's done cause she's one of the \\"beautiful people\\" and everyone wishes they could live her life.<br /><br />Really movie? Really? That's how you want to end? Taking cold comfort in the form of the crippled guy that's supposed to be the physical parallel of your emotionally stunted growth and then having his sister tell you that nothing you've done is bad because you're better than everyone else? WTF? Who honestly looked at this script and though \\"Gee. This is something I want to see done. This is a great idea to present to the masses.\\"<br /><br />It's not deep. It's not meaningful. It doesn't inspire anyone. It's just crap.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|there is no words to describe how great this book is. I love it. I recommend that everyone should read this.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I loved it. I was instantly hooked. I read the other Percy Jackson books before this one and their all awesome. I would recommend this book to anyone. Rick Riordan is an amazing and talented author.
B0093WVND4|5.0|I choose this rating because of all the excitement!!! -:).........  I would give this book as a title, scary excitement<br />Or plain just Fantastic Mr. Fox
B008FTAAG2|5.0|there wasn't a song that i didn't like on the album ( not including the intro and the 30 second intermissons
B004HX0P2Y|4.0|The characters in the movie are played to a T. Loved the premise of &#34;oldies&#34; in a mind and action flick. I usually rent, but wanted to have this one in my collection.
B008MWBY6W|5.0|Finally a small case that holds my Nikons with the 18-200 lens attached. It holds both my 3200 body and 7000 body. It has support pads that also hold the weight of the camera body so the lens does not take the weight.<br /><br />It has two side pockets and a front pocket. None have that much depth so you can only put small narrow items like lens covers, batteries, and lens cleaners in them. There are two separate pouches in the front pocket for SD cards.<br /><br />The case is padded, and the bottom is plastic, sort of rubberish, on the outside, and hard making it perfect to protect a lens. The strap on the case has a big wide shoulder pad about 4-6 inches long that slides into place. And the case itself has a padded handle.<br /><br />The case is meant for one camera with a lens attached and the camera strap. It will not hold much else. I did put my wallet  and iPhone on top, but the extra pockets will not fit either as they are too thick. With the support pads in place, you cannot put the camera in. One has to be lifted up, then the lens fits under it.<br /><br />Even with the limitations I mentioned, it is a 5 star product as I have not found a holster case that fit my 18-200 lens attached to my Nikon 7000 until now. And the price is affordable too!
B007QA3AH2|5.0|Watched this with our kids (11 & 9) and the whole family enjoyed it. Great funny moments, a few bad words, but still family friendly.
B0055QYKQO|4.0|Gigabyte make good motherboards.  I have used them whenever I can and only stray to a few other well known brands when I can't afford the one I want.  This board is excellent, everything is in a logical location, nice solid state capacitors, and good quality construction.  The heatsync's for the chipsets are well placed and low to the board.  Lots of PCI-E slots.<br />I have this paired with an FX-8350 and 2x8GB of Mushkin PC3-14900.  Heat has not been an issue, everything runs well even under stress.  I've cranked Handbrake up a few times and maxed out all 4 modules with no issue.<br />If you have the money I can't recommend anything better.<br /><br />One slight note:<br /><br />The only down side is actually related to Amazon Warehouse.  I bought this open box, not something I generally do with critical components, but the $40 discount was too good to pass up.  Next time I will spend the $40.  Amazon decided to box this by placing it in an Anti-Static bag at the bottom of the shipping box, under a large amount of brown paper.  This might sound ok, but it isn't.  There was far to much play and the motherboard was allowed to slide around in the box.<br />I also tend to expect open box items to be tested, that would include clearing the bios password someone set.  An openbox item can not be tested if the person who is checking it can not access the bios.
B007BGQFTQ|5.0|And you may find you would rather not be weak than stop reading this series for even a minute. Because this was a five book set, I got to read all of them in one go, and unlike many series I've read, all of these books held up. None were slow or hard to get through and it was a fun ride the whole time.<br /><br />The worst part was she I finally got to the end and realized I would not be reading any more about Alexis or Conall or Ivy Lord Akeldama or Biffy or any of the other great characters.<br /><br />If you haven't read these books you should pick up this set right now. I am ecstatic that I did. And I hope to read more from Carriger in the future.
B008476HBM|4.0|This is a chic book, but I do enjoy reading it and seeing how the author develops the characters and the plots.  Have read it about 5 times and frequently go back to sections.
B00486070K|5.0|Works like it should. I no longer use it now because my office got wireless ethernet. I recommend this though.
B008B68IUY|5.0|This car is absolutely adorable!  Kids will love, love, love to have their dolls ride around in it and it is a must have for collectors!
B0094U0RJQ|5.0|I am a Bob Dylan fan for a long long time. He isn't everyones cup of tea but I can't worry about that.
B009NPA3Q4|4.0|I got this CD for my husband for Christmas, as he really likes the song &#34;Home&#34; (reminds us of Mumford & Sons). Even though he wasn't as big of a fan of the rest of the songs, I really enjoyed it. He has a hint of country, but not enough for me to dislike it. It wasn't until after I bought it that I found out that he was an American Idol winner (oops...)<br /><br />Overall, this CD is very well done and the songs are very nice.
B006FS22Y8|5.0|Poor Amy, I miss her. I really enjoy Amy Winhouse and it is a tragedy that she is gone and will hear no new material from her.
0375851569|5.0|Everyone should know Dr. Seuss, so I'm not going to say anything about the books. Rather, this collection is great as it has the classics everyone knows. I bought these for my daughter before she was born, and I have read them to her. She's still only 11 months old, so she tends to try and rip the pages out, so I just hold the book up for her to look at the pictures.<br /><br />They do come in the box shown, although it's up to you whether you would like to store them that way. It would protect them, yes, but once all four books are in there, it's a snug fit, so if you take one out and try and put it back in, it can be quite a chore. The books are hardback, so having them outside the box on a bookshelf would be just fine as well.
0470901071|5.0|Great study guide. I have not finished reading this yet but I appreciate the authors ability to present the material in a way that is easy to understand.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I enjoyed CrossMe and find that I like CrossMe Color even more.  I like the simple interface and the variety of pictures to solve.
B004OO4UFY|5.0|What can I say? Anyone who likes good music performed by excellent musicians will enjoy listening to the Heavy. Great band.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I am just getting used to my kindle fire hd and have been adding different apps to it. Great service.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Now listen this game is great but every thing cost gold BUT you can easily earn gold on multiplayer but I was impatien and used 20 bucks to buy my class ooooh wellll....
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This is a great book for everyone - married, divorced, single, dating, divorced and dating.  You will learn a lot about yourself and also about the one you love.
B004LROMWU|5.0|love it.  can't wait for the second season to come available.  will get it as soon as it comes out.
B001GXF2YY|4.0|Yeah, I'm hooked. I don't need to say anything more. However, it's requiring it. It just didn't zing for me.
B006Z21ZJC|5.0|i got this for my brother and he really likes it.  the metal case is wonderful as he is hard on things and this will protect it better.
B0085WA9OM|5.0|This special edition included the demo tapes. To be honest, the demos were my favorite, although the remix was exquisite. I think for me, I wanted the nostalgia that the demo tapes provided. The African voice was stronger on them. As a complete listen while driving or exercising, the repeat of songs doesn't bother me at all.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|love it. just wish there were more levels.  I even restarted just so I could keep playing.  the arcade level is the best.
034580404X|5.0|If you like to take trips out of your reality and imagine yourself in some hot, steamy, entangled fantasy then you must read these steamy books!
B004JZBGWI|4.0|This is an awesome app and meets all my needs for note-taking, reminders, lists, calendar functions etc.<br />However, the one drawback that prevents me from giving it all 5 stars is the fact that I cannot use it on a PC.<br />It is not always possible to carry the tablet around with me to meetings etc.<br />I wish it had the capability of syncing via PC and tablet.<br /><br />Other than that this app works great.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|My Alarm Clock Free is awesome, but my title of this says it all! You really do need an upgrade if you want a super duper cherry on top from me. Ima justa saying...
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|its fun and all except it doesn't give us enough time it only gives us like 10min. please give us at least an hour&iexcl;!&iexcl;
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Excellent!  I bought 2. One for myself and one for my sister we both loved it. Can't wait for more from him.<br />Recommend to all Bruno Mars fans young or old.
B00846TTDG|5.0|Awesome money, realistic story line.  There are a few awkward scenes where a few corny lines  thrown out there.  Overall great Military movie.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Yeah I didn't blah blah touching  sad blah blah heartache blah blah waste of my time blah blah movie was better
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Last 45 mins goes downhill pretty fast, and has a horrible transition to the ending.  Its not the best movie in the series, but overall its good.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I have a Pandigital Novel and have yet to get this app to work 100%. Sometimes I can play the game but the graphics are incomplete, sometimes I can't do anything with it. I'm not sure if it is a Pandigital issue or what but I'm very dissappoiinted at the inconsistancy of this app.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Very fun and addicting app. I recommend this app. to any one with kids of all ages and if you yourself are board. This app is a great time passer. Also a challenging app.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is an enjoyable game. It's quick to learn yet provides a challenge each and every time. You're rewarded for playing continually which gives you an incentive for playing.
6305754969|5.0|Great present for the in-laws who really like to spend time together watching the movies from their era.  And who wouldn't like a great John Wayne movie!?
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Decent game with an interesting story and some good puzzles. The whole &quot;free&quot; thing was shady. I would be willing to try more game  from this company.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I have heard good things about this show and wound up buying it on a whim. Best whim ever! It kept me wanting more and is a amazing show. I personally love Daryl Dixon. >__< He's my favorite and I can't wait to see more of him.
1416972250|5.0|I really loved the book. However, my personal opinion is that the series should have ended at this point.<br />Don't know if I'll read the next one.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I have heard good things about this show and wound up buying it on a whim. Best whim ever! It kept me wanting more and is a amazing show. I personally love Dallas. &#62;__&#60; He's my favorite and I can't wait to see more of him.
B007THA4FI|1.0|This book is one of the most boring books ever. I couldn't finish it and I almost never quit on a book. Can't believe I spent that much money for this piece of crap!
B009RI4FRU|3.0|This is not a movie that I would watch over and over.  Once was enough.  It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't memorable either.  I was sorry for that because this movie was suppossed to be along the lines of the Roal Tennenbaums, which is one of my favorite movies.  But, I felt the story and acting with this movie just weren't as good.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Just another 5-star rating to add to the thousands already here.  Wool deserves consideration for the Hugo and Nebula awards.  The writer Howey displays incredible control over a vast world, preserving its mystery by serving information to the reader one stingy teaspoon at a time.  In a bad story, this feels awful and frustrating, but in a good story it just leaves you craving for more.<br /><br />Some readers might prefer quicker stories though.  Howey takes his time telling this epic tale, sometimes using a couple pages just to move a character from one room to the next.  He's definitely a prose writer who likes to explore in detail the minds and hearts of his characters.  If you prefer efficient stories to artful ones, then Wool probably isn't for you.  Also, if you prefer space opera, high technology or more fantastic science fiction, Wool might not be for you either.  Wool tells a very contained story that explores social themes rather than technology.<br /><br />For everyone else, Wool is a great ride.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|The image is clear and beautiful. Everything looks so colorful and crisp.<br /><br />Concerning the movie itself, as a fan of evengelion you will find a couple of surprises as it is here where the story starts to vary with the one from the series
B00785P2QC|3.0|ITS JUST OK. KINDA BORING. TAKES WAY TO LONG TO GET COINS. IT WON'T TAKE LONG UNTILL YOU ARE SO BORED YOU ARE DONE.
1452110581|5.0|This made the purrfect gift for my best friend and fellow cat lover! I skimmed through it before wrapping it up and fell in love! The poetry is wonderful, the illustrations are fantastic...I need to buy a second copy for my own home now!
B00992CF6W|1.0|fun for like 2 seconds than you get so bored of it, you want to die. don't know why everyone likes it
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is fantastic. I wish I wouldn't have read it so fast, though. Amazing story! The end was perfect.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|Awesome show, got it for a good price too, will definitely buy again as gifts for others. Really great deal
B007MDB6L0|5.0|My daughter loved this movie and I liked it too (dad). Never knew Tinker Bell like this before, but Disney has been very creative in keeping this amazing Fairy so popular.
0525952926|5.0|Winter of the World -  Very hard to put down.  Unbelievable amount of research. The stage is set for another book
B006WAIV6M|3.0|enjoyed the book but I felt that i wanted more.  Perhaps it achieved its aim as it captured my interest
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Awesome! PERFECT! Exactly what I was looking for :) Perfect for lists and anything else you can think of. Sharing with friends is easy to do too. Love love love love love
B005H29GSI|3.0|The game is okay. It's a lot of work for little kids to set this up, only to tear it down so quickly. The electronic game is better simply because of the instant gratification. My kids (3 and 5) like shooting stuff out of the slingshot more than anything else.
B0038P59A0|5.0|Greetings!  This movie nails the spirit and theme of Sherlock Holmes in every respect.  If you've read the novels, you'll be delighted how it translated into this movie.  Jude Law is great as Watson--he fits and plays the role to perfection--but Robert Downey steals the show.  He is Sherlock in this movie and this is perhaps my favorite performance of his (at least close!).
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Good read. Keeps you wanting to see what happens next. Not  s u 're how the characters fit like they are suppose to but still a good read.
B009NPA3Q4|4.0|Greetings!  The wife and I rooted for Phillip during Idol, despite the fact that I don't normally follow those shows!  His vocal style and &#34;homey&#34; appeal comes through in this collection of music.  If you enjoyed his performances on the show and the song &#34;Home&#34;, then this album should be enjoyable for you.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|Great movie it was clear and viewable and I will recommend everyone if they want a movie buy it on DVD, they are clear.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game not only makes you think but it gives you kinda a struggle to find things out but if you make it through you just get an even harder level and it is also fun :)
B00914JWSW|5.0|This was a gift for my wife - a huge Streisand fan - and she loves it.<br />As far as I can tell, the singer has never produced anything that wasn't excellent.
B009E3EWPI|4.0|I don't consider myself a die-hard Zeppelin fan; but this is an excellent concert film. It picks up where the 2003 concert DVD left off. The band sounds great, Jason Bonham did a super job filling in for his father. Robert Plant doesn't have the same range he once did however his voice still packs a punch. I do think it completes my Led Zeppelin collection; not something that I'll re-sell.
B00A77II0U|4.0|I love this game (and bonus)! The graphics, story line, HO games were excellent! However, I was dissapointed only in that there weren`t more mini games. Definitely worth $2.99, as compared to $7.00+ on PC.
B007HO392S|2.0|Listened to the CD all the way through 3 times.  Have put it away and probably wont' listen again (and I'm a HUGE carrie fan).
B0096CDG0O|5.0|My husband got me to try this as we always play words with friends. So much fun sometimes I play random friends so I play often. Very great app. Works perfectly, although I purchased app not free one to avoid the ads that pop up<br />.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This was an amazing book. It was a little slow at the beginning, but once I got to the main plot of the book, I thought the story was worth waiting for! Like the first 2 books in the trilogy, the book was pretty violent, so if you are under 12 I suggest you ask your parents before you read this. Anyway this is one of the most incredibly wonderfully amazing books I have ever read! If you are thinking about not reading this, you are wrong! This is a must-read! Enjoy!
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I bought this for my son for Christmas. Very  good price compared to others that I looked at while shopping for this trilogy.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|anybody can play good for all ages, fun shooting birds at pigs and stuff, good game,could spend alot of time playing this with all the diff levels
B007HACDLK|5.0|I liked it from the begining to the end. I like thrillers that just don't stop. It was very good.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|If you like real drama, romance and fantasy.  This is the series to watch.  I love how they have re-created and explain the storytells we all grew up on in a way that is both intriguing for today's audience and yesterday's audience.  Excellent!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|An excellent book that would  appeal to young people and anyone interested in the identity-making of the young. I would definitely recommend it and plan to now watch the film.
0061733199|5.0|I have read this book front to back at least 4 times, putting the skills into practice on my outings.  Very useful and written so the laymen can comprehend the ideas.  Bottom line is that this guy knows his stuff and passes the knowledge effectively to his audience.  I feel I have an extensive skill base for survival situations thanks to this book.  A word of advice, alot of the skills require practical application.
1416511946|5.0|This is amazing! I gave it as a Christmas gift to my boyfriend and I can't seem to stop reading it myself. Wonderful! Wondering why I never read before now....If you love Sixx A.M. and you are wondering what happened to Nikki Sixx, here it is!!!
B0002HZLWI|5.0|These blocks are beautifully made and will last not only for our grandchildren but for their children as well.  Hours and hours of building may lead to the next great architect as our oldest grandson loves to use a sketch pad to draw his designs and then build them.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A great book. A great lesson at the end. A lot of well described Gore. So !#+/ing awesome. Loved it.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I was hesitant to read this because I didn't want to get sucked into another Marley & Me sob story, but this book is different. It's sweet, witty, and touching with an ending that is happy and beautiful. I admit that I skipped over the more detailed racing descriptions because...well, I just don't care about that, but the main story was great. I recommend this book to people all of the time now.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I have enjoyed playing this game but some of goals are unclear.  it would also be helpful if the map was interactive.
B00846REIS|5.0|Once started, I couldn't stop reading this.  It is so seriously intense and draws you right in...  I will most definitely be reading this trilogy a number of times!
B004I744AS|5.0|hi I like this app and it is eassy to use and I gave it a 5 star icier cifnnd djrnfn cjfjfj
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game has it all....adventure and hidden object.  I really am enjoying it. I use the hint button quite a bit and the zoom feature comes in handy. Has very good graphics.
B002IITP5I|5.0|GREAT! IT CAME IN A TIMELY FASHION. IT HAS EXCELLENT QUALITY. I AM VERY HAPPY WITH IT. WILL BE ORDERING SOMETHING AGAIN
B005LAIGRS|4.0|this movie is classic denzel!! he makes the whole movie I would recommend it to anyone who loves denzel washingtons movies
B007REV4YI|5.0|Although Daniel Craig does not fit the physical description of Fleming's famous 007, he does a good job of bringing out the secret agent depicted in Fleming's novels.  The screenplay in this film shows  a more personal side of Bond which makes this installment of the frachise a hit in my opinion.
B004EPYZQC|4.0|i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a lot of action it has a great cast and is fast paced
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I love reading Jodie Picoult's books, all of them have been hard to put down, but this one is full of drama and uncertainty!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is awesome! I've been waiting for it to be on Amazons Gamestore.... I'm so happy .... Lol. Laugh out loud.I wish they had the turbulent app.
B000B8IA2G|5.0|I recommend this series to anyone who enjoys a good Sci-Fi show.  My siblings and I love anything Stargate, so I got my brother the first season for Christmas.  I bought a used one and he couldn't tell the difference :)
B007EECSFA|3.0|good read but very wordy and confusing at times. Not her best story, I didn't think. I found the plot very weak and not particularly interesting.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|All my grandchildren love this game. It is nice to have it on the Kindle! It made a trip to the Dr. much more entertaining!
B009B2VBWE|4.0|Glad Rag Doll takes you back to another time.  If you are stuck in the present and unable to appreciate the sound of another era than Glad Rag Doll is not for you. Many of the songs are beautiful, some are fun and others are sad.  I found this to be a Cd that grows on me the more I listen to it.  Each time I listen I find a new song that I didn't truly appreciate before.  Give it a try.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy, fun and entertaining. My gradchildren love it and we take turns playing.  I also travel with it and use it any time!
B00447G29S|4.0|This 3D movie was an amazing experience to watch together as a family.  I only wish it were offered in a package with Blu-ray, DVD, and digital copy combo.  At the price I paid for the item though, it was well worth it.  My children were able to watch it several times over the holidays due to efficient shipping.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I have this app on my cell phone and my kindle.  It gives me so many choices of what to read.  I can scan headlines or read more in depth.  My husband has it now too
B003CNQPNS|4.0|Why did you choose this rating?  Because I had seen the show in the 80's.  What did you like? or dislike?<br />What I like about it was the characters and the motorcycle.  There isn't anythings I didn't dislike.<br />I have seen this show before and I like it then.  I like the actor Rex Smith as Jesse also love the action<br />and the motorcycle.  I would tell other people who like action shows from the 80's.
B009KNPM9W|5.0|One of my favorite tracks by Marvin Gaye..after listening to the expanded edition of this cd, I must say that i love every bit of it and it is relaxing to me because most of this album is instrumental, and has somewhat of a blues/jazz groove to it..even tho Marvin didnt get much recognition for this album, if he were alive today i would simply shake his hand and say what a job well done because Marvin was very talented and composed most of the music on this album and did not receive the recogition he should have received during the time of the release of the album..if you are a fam of Marvin, i would strongly recommend this album
B005RDF2RG|4.0|As the title says, this was cute. Its an old movie, and Id seen it years ago - but was looking for something to watch with my 6 YO that was different. I hesitated because I wasn't sure if it was appropriate, but it was fine. There is 'potty humor' about gas and the like, and I caught one instance of a swear word (da..), but otherwise it was a fine choice. He enjoyed it as well.
B006O3MU96|4.0|We purchased the regular doodle jump and they had to have this one also.<br /><br />They enjoy the game and it seems challenging for both of them and holds their interest.
1593272782|5.0|It looks like there is a series of three similar books in this series. I bought all three, and the are great. My son has a crazy amount of Lego - but one you build a kit, some additional ideas can be fun. His book helps provide the basis for building other new ideas.
B00138H44S|5.0|Not too much I can say about this man - he changed the electric bass world with this album.  If you are into bass playing, buy it.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|very nice product and when you have grandchildren you have your own navigator system. then easy access to the unit
B000YAA68C|5.0|My friend was not about to get this movie at our Walmart.  I guess it is real popular and so they are sold out.<br />I was able to get it reasonable through you and she enjoys it very much.
B006R1T40I|5.0|The Blueswoman is back and delights with every chord and note! Love the reggae spin on Gerry Rafferty's &#34;Right down the Line&#34;
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It is an average game but it is a fun game. Most of the games are fun other are not so much
B001N1DPDE|4.0|Great knife, built to last, stays sharp. The only complaint is the sheath that it came with, it will dull the edge as you pull it out and in. Buy the knife and throw away the sheath.
B000RLHDUM|5.0|I liked this version much more than the original. Both actors seemed made for their parts. I also love how suave the lead character is. It's almost like Brosnan was more James Bond in this film that when playing Bond himself for four films. Definitely recommend this movie.
B002RXHW6S|1.0|This didnt even last 48  hours. My 3 year old was only able to use it twice before is had hole in it. I didnt even try to patch it because I was so disappointed. This was the main thing she wanted for Christmas and she  cant even use it. I wish  I would have bought the first one I saw with a warranty... we are so bummed.
B009VB9VKY|3.0|Movie was ok....I thought the plot was a bit weak and the Audio was less than enjoyable. My wife thought it was a bit &#34;Over the Top&#34; which surprised me. I streamed the movie and the resolution was more like an average quality DVD than HD.
B009EAO38C|5.0|These guys know how to bring music to the next level of enjoyment.<br /><br />Five stars all the way for them
1400049628|5.0|If you can read this in the satirical manner it's intended it's a good book and clearly meant for the zombie fan (which I am). Some good advice for how to stave off the zombies should World War Z (also a good book being made into a movie with Brad Pitt) ever happen. Don't forget to get upstairs and then Destroy The Stairs behind you!
159420411X|5.0|this book is a very interesting read, makes you think a lot. I was very pleased in learning and understanding all of the predictions that fail.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Great movie, good action. One of the most shocking things to me is the weight and muscle Hardy put on for this film
B0062OCNAI|4.0|Strength in love and family is firmly reminded throughout this novel. Evil can find you.l love the bond between mother and daughter. I found comfort in the hope of a afterlife.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|Great sequel to the first one. I love the pairing of Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law. I hope they can make a couple more of these movies or team-up more in the future for other films.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|It entertained me for the night. It's one of those movies where you know it might be corny in a few places but that's okay. You in the mood for something like this or it's better than the other choices. You're not going to go brag to all your friends that they have to see this movie but Lincoln killing vamps entertains.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|It is a really good movie and a well done mix of humor and special effects.  It is a definite must watch.
B000N2HCM4|4.0|If one can read this book with an open mind and not a political overlay, it is a wonderful story of a black man in america. As he has become the president, I feel it helps better understand his perspective on the world - open and inclusive, not closed and selective. His thoughtful, reflectivenss that is at times interpreted as &#34;cold&#34; seems just the normal way of a natural introvert. Well written, good read.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The story is well written.  It takes an atheist and lets him know there is God.  The description of what he goes through when he is on &#34;The Other Side&#34; or in Heaven is truly breath taking.  I have recommended this book to many people in my church and to unsaved people.  I have read the book about weeks ago and I think about it almost daily.<br /><br />A great true story.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Disturbingly good book. It is one of those that keeps you on your toes while reading it and stays in your mind long after. What is the truth?
B0063IH60K|5.0|one of the best solitaire game i've played, seems to have very random deals, unlike other games that don't seem to have a good schuffle.
B000URWYTS|5.0|I found this book to be incredibly wonderful!  Although fiction, I found myself regularly checking what the actual facts were and was very pleased to see the way the author presented the work.<br /><br />I had such admiriation for Mamah leading an authentic life amidst such social challenges. This does not imply a judgement of her choices - she had enough people judging. But as a book, this is wonderfully written.  I am very glad I was not an adult woman in the early 1900s.<br /><br />Also it presents a different perspective on Frank Lloyd Wright - as a person, as a man, through  his lover's eyes.<br /><br />Great book, well told. Thank you, Nancy Horan, for telling the story.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|From the very first page I was carried away into another time, place, and realm.  I was simply lost in The Night Circus and had trouble putting it down.  It captivated me from page one until the very last page.  This book is different from any others I've ever read and recommend it to anyone looking to read something unique yet quite enjoyable.  Terrific flowing writing style as well!  Enjoy the book!
B0086700CM|5.0|Fast paced and addictive. This game is definitely worth the download. Watch out for that tree, ledge, or flaming trap.
B004ZH66XO|1.0|Every time i attempt to play level 4-1 the game stops working. Have removed and reinstalled and replayed all the levels only to have same force close at same spot. Paid full price for half the game...
B0050R0XEG|5.0|Just want to say that the item came in good shape and was here in plenty of time for Christmas.  It has been enjoyed and is all together now.
B008CPZNL6|1.0|Although i love this app on my smartphone, it has been a huge disappointment on my tablet. The headlines and pics all render smoothly but every time i navigate to an article, all text fails to upload.  Only works about half the time...
B006LSZECO|5.0|Such a good book! I couldn't put it down and now I can't stop thinking about it!  It is a must read!
0425263916|5.0|I fell in love with this book. Thought it was well written for the most part. Yes, it did slightly remind me of Fifty Shades of Grey, although if you get past the beginning you will see that the story line is actually different. Warning, it is very descriptive. Adult only book. Can't wait for the last book to come out.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Can't wit for the movie! This is probably the best sci-fi read out there, but is riveting even for those (like me) that don't gravitate JUST to that genre
0307455378|5.0|Los mismos personajes que ya conocia en la sombra del viento, que enriquecen la historia por q ya les conocemos algo. En esta historia se explora un lado oscuro y misterioso, desenvolviendose con un final completamente inesperado.
B000AM2L1O|5.0|My 14-month old granddaughter loved it.  It was just what she needed.  She loves putting her to bed in her cradle.
B004EPYZOO|5.0|My wife and I were able to watch part of this movie while on vacation in July. But did not see the beginning. We could not find it available to rent anywhere, not even from our satellite company. So we were very pleased to find it on Amazon. We have made other purchases from Amazon, and have NOT been disappointed as of yet. Amazon will be our new Christmas headquarters. Thank You!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It was awesome  a lot better than the movie I loved this book because  It got really suspenseful towards the end
B003H6KRIE|5.0|You dont need a review of the three movies. You already know what they are about. The packaging is fine, the discs work well. You need to know however that the versions included in this box set do not include the UV or Digital Copy, which are handy for transferring to the mobile devices. Other than that, this box set is everything you would expect from this trilogy.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Don't get this book it is not a good story<br />The story of haunted england and informative particles buggy uhh
B005LAIIQC|5.0|Here we go again. Another one of those Bourne movies where the director decides we have seen all of the cool moves done, so &#34;let's just shake the crap out of the camera and cutaway 50 times a minute so they cant see anything. That way, we dont have to act or anything like that.&#34; Jeremy Renner is cool. Maybe his next action thriller will be shot by a non-crackhead cameraman and director.<br /><br />This movie is only good because it follows a successful storyline. This Two-Disc combo Pack should also be bundled with Advil to help with the headache the camera-work causes.
B001J710Y8|4.0|There can never be a complete restoration of THE WICKER MAN, for the original negatives have been lost--but there have been at least three different cuts: the original studio cut; a slightly restored cut that includes a few additional minutes; and a presumably final cut that relies on an almost-complete American print.  This particular cut seems to be the first or second cut, and buyers in search of the final cut should look for the double DVD release.  But whatever the cut, the basic film and its qualities remain very much the same, a little shocking, a little intriguing, and ultimately very, very disturbing.<br /><br />The story concerns a police sergeant (Edward Woodward) who is sent to investigate the disappearance of a child at an isolated and privately owned community on Summerisle.  The inhabitants seem kindly enough, but they are obstructive to the investigation, and the very straight-laced and conservative Christian sergeant is shocked to discover that they practice a form of paganism that reeks of sex.  He also comes to believe that the missing child has become a victim of these religious practices and will be sacrificed due to a poor harvest.  Can he find her and get her off the island before it is too late?<br /><br />The cast is exceptional.  Edward Woodward is memorable as the stiff Sergeant Howie; Christopher Lee, as Lord Summerisle, considers this his best performance and his best film.  Supporting players Britt Eckland, Ingrid Pitt, Diane Cilento, and Irene Sunter are memorable, with Eckland particularly so as the flagrantly sexual inn-keeper's daughter Willow.  Although the script is occasionally a bit silly--Lord Summerisle's explanation for the island's paganism is absurd--it is remarkably effective, and the sound and look of the film is remarkably seductive.  And if you don't see it coming, the final five minutes will spin your head around.  Not to be confused with the dreadful 2006 remake with Nicholas Cage.  Recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer<br />For Gypsy, Mistress of the Night, Feline Companion of 20 YearsReviewer<br />For Gypsy, Mistress of the Night, Feline Companion of 20 Years
B001P59V5Y|5.0|This film has to be the funniest film of all time. Certainly I can't think of a funnier one. Banned when it first came out it is now life yearly must see Christmas film. Brilliant
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Love this case, it is lightweight and protects very well. It was a little tight getting the case to fit but I think it is because it protects so well.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This was a good second book sequel to the Hunger Games trilogy but I felt it did not hold the same suspense as the first book did for me.
B009NPA3Q4|3.0|I was really looking forward to PP's first album, and I have to say I'm disappointed.  Here's why:  This young man is a huge talent.  His voice has great appeal, and he knows how to deliver a song.  The musicianship on the album and the production quality is first-rate.  What aren't so great are the songs themselves.  They sound like what a young man with little worldly experience would write.  Moreover, his songs are virtually tuneless and the lyrics insipid and superficial.  The song that really sticks with you, of course, is Home, and he didn't write that one.  The other song whose tune<br />stuck with me a little bit was Gone, Gone, Gone, and when I went to check, I found he didn't write that one either.  Okay, Get Up, Get Down is kind of catchy, but that's the best of the rest.<br />I'm not sure he's going to have the kind of career he wants to have if he continues to do primarily his own material.  He needs some emergency songwriting instruction, and he needs to use more material written by other songwriters for him.  I still have high hopes for him.  He deserves to be a household name.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book! Great trilogy but the first book was good enough to stand alone. However it was better to be able to continue the story through two more books. Loved it!!!
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|The game is VERY addicting.<br />My problem is that there are no understandable rules to follow.<br />Where can I find them?
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a great final book to the Hunger Games trilogy. I loved the ending! This was a fun read!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Really liked this book for lifting the curtain on foster kids who made it despite the odds.  I didn't know anything about attachment disorder, but identified with Victoria's need to isolate.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I have owned this headset for a couple of months now, and i will say that this is definitely the best headset i have ever owned. it is very easy to use and the sound quality is amazing. on the slightly more technical side, i do not hear any interference sound coming from the headset even though i have a lot of wireless devices around the receiver .
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I can't help but watch this movie over and over! Surprisingly hilarious. Rebel Wilson definitely makes the movie. If you're a fan of music, it's a must-see.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Mr. Grisham's book was a very interesting, suspenseful, and humorous read and is a work that I can highly recommend to readers.  He has a great ability to capture the unique nuances of every character and is able to keep the reader engaged in the plot through a series of unexpected twists and turns in the plot.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Thought it was gonna be challenging but it wasn't the best I've played better before. Needs more on it maybe something different
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I wish there had been more hours in the day so that I could have had more time to read!
B005HSL626|5.0|we love this game very challenging My grand daughter that is 4 her loves to playing this game easy access for her
B009O07NDY|5.0|I bought this for my brother who is a huge Hobbit fan, and he love it! Any fan will find this as a must have
B003F3FJQO|4.0|I love this book series. I really do. However, I have never been so confused in my life. I don't understand what's going on.<br /><br />(SPOILERS) I don't really favor Brenda or Jorge. They seem unnecessary. I liked that there is a girl group, though.<br /><br />The goopy monsters at the end did not need to be there either. I didn't see a point in that.<br />I will read the third book and pray that it makes sense of itself and that it wont annoy me to pieces.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I think my title says it all. Another AMAZING book by Rick Riordan. I can't wait to start the next one
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Well I have to say it took a lot of patience to get through some of the books in this series but it was well worth it.I really liked this book and the ending. I would recommend it but just be prepared for a slow moving story. I hope we see more of Mac and Barrons in the future. I don't think ill be reading the Dani series just because i wasn't crazy about her in this story. Plus she's only 14.
B003O86FMW|5.0|What a twist this book has taken! I can't wait to read number 3! I finished this series in a week's time.
0316023744|5.0|Having been fascinated by WWII since I was a kid, and having read dozens of massive works on the subject, I didn't think it would still be possible to still find a single-volume work that covers the entire war to be anything near as fascinating a read as Beevor's is.<br />How he manages to cover such all-encompassing ground, while still including hordes of up-close eyewitness accounts, and keep it all as smooth-flowing and interesting as he does, I can only imagine. This is a work any WWII \\"enthusiast\\" will want to keep to re-read in the future.
B00846REIS|5.0|I think bared to you has more content than fifty shades.....a better love story. I hate to compare the two but that's how I found this book.
B000SW4DXK|5.0|I choose this rating because it is a great movie and l like the older version and this one, they are both good.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|It was a dictionary.  I mean, they're the same I guess.  But it was good.  It's kinda hard to rate a dictionary.  Good job, though.
B001LM1456|2.0|There are better comic-book character to movie adaptions out there. This was not one of them. Even with modern technology, the Hulk came off as cartoonish.
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|I thought it would be a typical science fiction action film but it was not. This was a great movie.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This is the best notebook app ever! I highly recommend it. I have it on my Kindle Fire HD and phone ! You should get this app I recommend it .Please get it. PLEASE!
B0087GZ8YW|4.0|This is Rebus, now a civilian working for the police with the possibility of re-enlisting, and all the way through the book I kept wishing he would stop smoking and drinking so much so he would pass his medical and get back in the police force so there would be more Rebus books. What a difference there is between Fox and Rebus. The former featured in this book, fortunately only briefly and was made to see the error in his ways by Kaye that there was no point in pursuing Rebus as a bad cop. He was just a different cop. This book was about a series of disappearances of young women on the A9 on Scotland's Western Coast. Rebus had been asked for help by a desperate mother Nina Hazlit seeking her young daughter  who had disappeared many years before and Rebus made the connection between a remote area and the burial place of these women and set in motion a string of events that led to their killer unravelling on the way the true story of Nina Hazlit and her daughter, and the rise and fall of the criminal underworld of Edinburgh.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|When I saw the preview months ago I could NOT WAIT for this movie to come out. I finally rented it on Amazon and it was good. It was not the &#34;edge of my seat&#34; thriller I was hoping for based upon the preview, but I was certainly not disappointed. Worth watching.<br /><br />Wouldn't pay $10 for a ticket to the theatre.<br />If I had to go back I'd wait for it to come to Redbox and pay just over $1 instead of $4 on Amazon...
B005LAJ17M|4.0|Definitely catches and keeps your interest.  You can't be sure which characters to trust, and as you gather clues as to who really is the traitor, your list of suspects grows!  Very good entertainment.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Excellent acting and a screenplay that has you on the edge of your seat.  Andrew Lincoln who plays the lead character Rick Grimes is outstanding in this role.  It's horror if your faint of heart.  Being slowly introduced in Atlanta to each of the other main characters like Glenn (who saves Rick from the zombies) and then Andrea, Daryl and Merle Dixon, T-Dog, Jackie and Morales and Jim helps you to start connecting with who they are in the series.  Each person plays an important role - even the zombie 'Wayne' is remembered for his sacrifice to help them get past the zombies in the episode \\"Guts'.  I highly recommend  getting all of the 3 series.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|This movie is such a great movie.  Normally I am not into &#34;war movies&#34;, but the moral in this movie is great.  I rented it and enjoyed it so much that I wanted to own it.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Liked the follow up with these three main actors. Lots of action and good story line. Worth the rental. I would recommend to anyone that likes these type of action movies.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Ok,I 've seen all the other Bourne movies. I thought Remmer was Damon's replacement.<br />. Apparently not. Confusing storyline. Guess you are supposed to intuit what is happening. The worst part  was the introduction of another character in the last 20 minutes of the movie and ridiculous moto :cycle chase  . I love a good thriller but it helps to be  able  to follow the storyline. 3 Stars.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Loved the movie and it did the other two justice. Love the actor as the younger K. I have been a fan of all the MIB movies and this one is well made and tied in with the others. I would recommend this movie and especially for those who like MIB. Well done!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|well I suppose its better then rolling in broken glass and jumping in a giant bowl of salt and lemon juice
B004EBT5CU|4.0|O.K....so I am late on the band(review)wagon here ~~~ Passing on my 2 cents anyway ~~~<br /><br />Wonderful music.  Great. I won't bore with all of the accolades that everyone else has already expressed.  She is great. We know this.  But one song that grinds my teeth is ~He Won't Go~.  Can't stand the Rihanna (or anyone else you can think that sings this type..there are many) style with the trivial poor lyrical expressions.....it grates on me.<br /><br />Otherwise love it.  Finally someone as a Christmas gift thought I should actually own her work. :)
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great series read all three books in a week. The movie does no justice for this series of books. enjoy
B00992CF6W|5.0|Even my 10 year old daughter who doesn't like video games likes this game. I like that they can use their imagination with the game.
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|I have read about 3 books by Jodi Picoult, and this was one of her slower books. I feel that the story line was good but the ending was a little less par than her other books!
0307949486|4.0|After seeing the movie, I read the book and then read the three sequels. I only hope they make movies of the other two.
B004K00NMG|5.0|I liked the movie and the quality was very good.<br />I recommend it to everyone.  And the price was right.
159448385X|5.0|Excellent story.  I found the first copy at a thrift store and enjoyed it so much decided to buy three copies for my sisters for Christmas gifts.  They arrived in time to ship to various locations.  Thanks!
B004JMSIRC|5.0|It was a very good movie and the quality was good.  I would recommend this movie to everyone who like action movies.
B000OZ0NXA|2.0|Mind you, I am a huge Reacher fan, I've read all of his books and shorts and there are some outstanding works. Of the first person writings The Enemy stands out, an absolutely brilliant piece of writing in my view. Killing Floor is also written in the first person but the style is so different from The Enemy that it gives me pause....<br /><br />What bugs me about Killing Floor is a) the thin thread of the story, and b) Reachers amazing bossyness -- and that everybody, even 20 year veterans of big city police work, bow in the dust in front of him and more or less ask guidance on how to tie their shoelaces (or some such).<br /><br />And there is nothing that stands out in the book. No sentences or paragraphs that I read again. Nothing that makes me go Aha. It puts me to sleep, is what it does.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|I had never heard of this movie before seeing it advertised on Amazon (yes I live under a rock) and I am Bruce Willis fan so I knew it would be decent. I was right! Very interesting plot and it ended totally different than I thought it would! This well worth the viewing, even if you only rent it (which I did). I will probably purchase it because it's worth watching more than once.
B009T3AHDE|4.0|Liked it on 1st viewing (big screen).  Loved it more the 2nd time (Bluray).  I enjoyed the strangeness of it all - performances, dialogue, ambiance, concept.  Not to say I understood all of it, but there's this elusive element about it that appeals to me somehow.  I'd easily give it a 5-star.  My husband didn't love it as much however, but said he'd give it a 3.  Though he hadn't read the book and knew nothing about it at all, he didn't mind the movie and even said he can relate to certain aspects of it, just that he thought there were some flaws in the story (to which I agree to some extent) that made it not great in his opinion.  So between us, it averaged a 4.
B009WUBERW|4.0|If you answered yes, you will like this one too. Same type of cheesy 80's action style movie. Good one liners, lots of action, and lots of explosions. Totally what you'd expect from this genre of movie! Worth the watch if you liked the first one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is a better game than temple run. it is good in details and it will make you beg for more!!!
B002M89UMW|5.0|I love this classic musical.  It's a memory maker movie, for sure!  It's great to have it available in a streaming format.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I broke the record for the fastest book ever read.  I bought this book on saturday and I was done with it Sunday night.  I couldn't put it down.  I was so intrigued by the characters and storyline. This is truly an amazing read.  There are parts that made me laugh and parts that made me cry. Definately would recommend it to anyone!
B006O6F932|5.0|Bought as Christmas gift for 6.5 year old granddaughter who had this on her Santa request list.  This complements her collection of Monster High dolls, so she plays with it daily.  Fairly solid for a fold up playhouse with lots of accessories to keep her imagination busy.  Great price from Amazon too.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I purchased the first four books in the Songs of Ice and Fire saga on the Kindle.  I was introduced to the story via the HBO show and started reading it after the second season of the show and have since finished every available book in the series.  As a standalone book, this is an excellent read.  The characters are vividly described and the storyline, while hard to follow at times due to the massive number of characters, is thrilling.  The fourth book, a Feast for Crows only follows one half of the characters in the world crafted by George R. R. Martin, so be prepared to buy the fifth book, [[ASIN:0002247399 A Dance with Dragons]], shortly after finishing this bundle to get the rest of the story.  Just because this book is technically a fantasy does not mean this is a read for kids.  The Songs of Ice and Fire Series is full of vividly described sex.  There are countless sex scenes, some featuring incestuous acts and a larger number featuring sex of the non-consensual type.  The book is violent and full of plot twists and turns.  If you have seen the TV show, The Game of Thrones, reading these books helps clarify the series with the back stories and explanations that put the HBO epic in much more context.  I highly recommend this series.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Okay, this book was so much better than the first! There were so many things answered that made me understand and appreciate the story more. While their relationship honestly annoys me, I can't help but want to read more. Truthfully, the best part of the story was when they weren't together and it was simply because for once they weren't annoying me with insecurities or fighting. She got her strength and personality back and I enjoyed reading anything Eva was doing for once. That all being said though, just because they annoy me as a couple it is written so well that I can't stop wanting to know more. Like where the story left, I am so intrigued and anxious for book 3. I don't want to wait 6 months to find out how the story continues! Gideon seriously bothered me with his secrets throughout the entire story but the little bit he did let in was so refreshing and again it was part of the best section of the book. I hate Corinne (as I am meant to) and I really wish she would get what is coming to her. I still love Cary but didn't like the ending of his part of this book. I thought he was on the right path until she showed up. Book 3 better make me understand that part more. Great addition to the series, this book really entertained me and left me wanting more without leaving me confused or annoyed of what was to come
B000AGTPUU|5.0|Just the best movie - full of fun and enjoyment.<br />The acting is so good and fun to watch.<br />Thank You.
B003NHRGSQ|4.0|Actual rating: 3.5 stars<br />I just struggled staying focused with this one. I skimmed a large amount of the book because I really didn't care about the scientific aspects of everything. I mean, okay yes they do play a role, but it was too much of a focus for me. I also didn't like the POV of so many characters. I think the Sam and Grace POV was enough. Just an alright book in my opinion. Hopefully the last book will make up for this one =/
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game was a lot of fun. Well worth the $2.99.  Not too short and not overly repetitive.  Another good one from G5.
B002JWD6AS|4.0|Okay, if you have ever wondered what would have happened if Bella chose Jacob and not Edward, then here you go. It started way too similar to twilight for my tastes, and for that reason it took me a while to get into the story. The parallels didn't stop at the beginning but they at least spread out more so that I felt like I was actually reading a unique story and not another Stephanie Meyer adaptation.<br /><br />Overall it's a good book though. I've put it off so many times because I just couldn't justify paying $8+ for a book that the reviews were less than stellar for, especially since I'd have to do it 3 times for the series. But the book was on sale so I decided to go ahead and read it finally. I can say that I'm glad that I did. I wish the story didn't feel so closely related to the other series because the parts that were unique were great! I did love Sam, and I am looking forward to where the story is going, but I'm still not sure I'm sold on paying so much money for the series. I guess I'll blame it on amazon and all the awesome books under $3...I'm spoiled by that now.<br /><br />Anyways....on to book 2!!
159420411X|5.0|For stat-heads, info-geeks, or anyone who is interested in how predictions work, this is a must read. Very well written.
B00846REIS|4.0|Pretty good. I have to admit their constant need to solve their problems with sex got a little annoying and actually made me believe less in the validity of their relationship, but it was a good story overall. I still don't fully get his issue though. He made a comment that he had only had consensual sex in one location at one point, so he raped someone? Or was he raped? I was confused by that part, I guess I just don't understand what is going on with Gideon. I'm hoping that more will be explained in the next book as well as Trey comes back. I really want Trey and Cary to work, but again the whole Cary story line confused me. Is he gay? Is he bi? Does he have a sex addiction problem? Hopefully there will be more answers to that one in the next book too. If this were just one book, and not a series I would have ended this book fairly pissed off because a lot of things really felt unfinished, but I am just going to pray that they all are wrapped up by the time I finish book 3 next year. Guess ill determine my feelings on this book and series when I can judge it as a whole. As an individual piece of the whole, knowing there is more to come, this was a pretty good book that held my attention for the most part
B008XBCJ34|5.0|We enjoyed Avatar at the theater when it came out, and still can't understand why it didn't win &quot;Best Picture&quot;.  Although not quite as immersive as the big screen, I enjoyed watching it in 3D on our new 80&quot; Sharp Aquos TV.  Good price on the movie, and got quick delivery!
B004VSTP4Y|3.0|This gets 3 stars strictly based on the way that it ended, because the truth of the matter is that IT DIDN'T END!!!! Ugh! How could you not have an epilogue with that? Did grace survive? Did they get their HEA? How about the reunion with Cole, why wasn't that part of the story??? I liked so much about this book until I read the last three sentences, went to the next page and realized that there was nothing more, I will never have the answers to my questions. What happened with Isabel and Cole? Ahhhh!!! I HATE series/authors who do not know how to close their own story lines and I am half tempted to give this book 2 stars simply because this ending failed so miserably at answering or closing half the story lines the author created. So utterly disappointing, and you can be assured I will NOT be reading anything else this author ever writes
B000AP04FG|1.0|This attempt at a movie does not even rate one star. This is the dumbest, most assinine movie ever offered to the viewing public. Could not attempt watching this \\"THING\\" to the end. Made it half way and gave up. Tried to donate it to a charity for resale and even they didn't want it. Does not even deserve a place in the Wal Mart 99 cent bargain bin.
B000007ODL|5.0|Nice Item! Good Deal ! Highly Recommend! Fast Response! Pleasure to deal with! Thanks for a good experience! Will use again!
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|Basically the same as the other Jason Bourne movies.  Not bad, not great. Certainly entertaining and we would watch again.
0062127241|4.0|Townshend offers a lot here, writes very well. At times confessional and always insightful. But through the course of the book I began to feel acutely the ways in which he holds back. I can't blame him on some matters, but many of the same anecdotes here are told quite differently by others involved, including not so flattering actions by Pete. By the end it's obvious the innocent light he portrays himself in, offering blatantly self-serving rationalizations of his mistreatment of others. Especially women, none more than his wife. By the end the shameless philandering with women young enough to be his daughter (at least) is a bit much to bear. It would be different if he showed some concern for it. He doesn't seem to delve into the reasons for this like he does other issues springing from his abusive childhood. This combined with his obsession for buying up boats and properties led me to abandon the book towards the end. Love his music though!
B0090O07RS|5.0|Almost 45 years later, we have now a restoration of that legendary concert  in Hollywood  Bowl from July 5, 1968. The result are quiet surprising in this Blu-Ray with no grainy spots in the picture and some nice black levels. But the main treat is the DTS surround mix that let you hear the guitar of Mr. Krieger circulating in the speakers. Naturally the picture of a old show can't be as sharp as a new concert, but they did a nice restoration of the picture and especially the sound, because in some songs, were missing the sound of Jim's voice on the original tape. These details are fully explained in the excellent documentary in the extras.<br /><br />Seeing the young Jim Morrison clearly affected by LSD is kind of strange, but he managed to start the show with control, but as the show progress, he tend to extend the notes longer, his mind starting to slow down a bit, but it didn't affected the music that much.<br /><br />This is a complete show even at  72 minutes long. It goes in a flash when you feel immersed in the music of this original classic rock band that developed  a original sound with a unique singer that add poetry to his singing. It's only sad that he died a few years later, because the band could have made a lot more music, who knows.
B001NHZ2KM|5.0|I loved this when it came out, hadn't seen it in since then. I love it, but then again I'm a fan of both the Who and music/culture from that era. Few bands have contributed so much to the rock history annals.
B00633W614|4.0|I have to say this one was not quiet as good as the first one. Perhaps is was the surprise factor wasn't there as much, as I already knew a number of the characters. I also enjoy reading about the older days more than the present times. Don't get me wrong, it is worth reading as Mr Archer has great character details and story lines and unexpected plot twists. Can't wait for the 3rd installment. Just finished Kane and Abel as well, to get a fix on his other stories. Another good read but not as compelling as the Clifton Chronicles.Love his endings...
159420411X|5.0|For a budding stats-geek like myself it was exactly what I needed.  It's an enjoyable read and really isn't political in nature.  Political issues are certainly mentioned, but the book focuses on the math and the process.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Great app easy to use makes it a lot easier to find all my watched items and keep track of my current bids.
B00992CF6W|1.0|To start off, im a huge fan of minecraft. were it not for the fact that my download keeps failing I probably would've given this game a perfect score. but until I'm able to download it successfully I give it a one only because I cant give it a 0. any1 else have problems downloading it?
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Very entertaining, well written! It was easy to actually feel the emotions of the characters - LOVE this book! Didn't want to put it down.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|wonder is an amazing book. august is so brave.if i were like that i could never be that brave.R.J. paloco has outdone themself with this book.<br />  Qynn
B00846REIS|5.0|Very good read even after fifty shades of grey! I wasn't sure because of the other reviews nut I'm hooked!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I haven't dead a book that I enjoyed this much in a long time. It is a must read. I recommend it highly.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|I've always been a huge fan of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series. Even though I'm 16, I still get excited when a new book comes out. I'm such a huge fan of the first three books, but lately, the last couple of ones, I just felt like they lack the humor, you know? It's like Jeff Kinney is out of jokes to write. The most thing I cracked was a mere smile in this book, and I remember, while reading the first ones, I would literally laugh out loud every five seconds. It sucks that they aren't as awesome anymore. I should probably understand that I'm not going to enjoy these books anymore, but somehow I always end up buying the latest one that comes out, just praying that it might be a funny one. Compared to the one before, I really think this one was still better, so yay for that.
B000059XYL|4.0|We've watched this movie three times.  It's very entertaining and will keep you interested.  It's probably more for younger or middle age people with an open mind. We are in our 60's and really liked it. I don't think it's for kids under 10 years of age.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Love quality, feel, color and classy look.<br />Know I will be keeping my Kindle protected with a product I'm proud to use!<br />Absolutely love it!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Who doesn't love Aliens! Awesome and a great price! He loved it! Came in a book like format with lots of neat features.
6304539282|3.0|Not in as great condition as expected But still got the movies in a timely fashion. Just happy about having the special edition of the star wars movies
0785814531|5.0|The mystery of Edgar Allan Poe lives on in this huge, thick book of his works. I was amazed at how much of Edgar Allan Poe's work really was contained in this book. It's a masterpiece in itself. For the first time ever, I own the greatest works of Edgar Allan Poe and they can all be found in this simple location. If you are an Edgar Allan Poe fan or just simple love a good mystery, then you need to purchase Edgar Allan Poe: Complete Tales and Poems. I found this book on Amazon for just pennies. It was delivered promptly and arrived in great condition.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|This book reminds me of the anime show .hack//sign. If you're even mildly interested in video games and if you like to read, then get this book.
0553296981|5.0|Anne Frank is a required read for my eighth grade English class. I have bought copies of this book on Amazon because you can obtain copies for just pennies, if that. Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl is a story of a brave, insightful, spunky young teenage girl who goes into hiding with her family during World War II. Anne wrote in a diary about her personal, innermost thoughts and dreams. This book is a tearjerker. I've seen grown men cry while reading this book. Anne was a legend and never got a chance to know it. Anne Frank is so insightful and deep that the reader can actually see the events, circumstances, people, and dreams she describes. Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl arrived just ten days after it was purchased. The book is in excellent condition..... Best penny I ever spent.
B004BLDD9Y|4.0|I originally bought this bulb to use in recessed lights (pot lights) that have a dimmer.  I quickly found that they do not work with an electronic dimmer.  The 50W equivalent brightness is about right although the human eye is not very good at distinguishing relative brightness.  This bulb is definitely not as bright as an equivalent 60W incandescent.  I ended up using these bulbs for general illumination and they are perfect for this application.<br /><br />I have purchased a number of different LED bulbs for comparison and my main complaint is the lack of uniform specification.  The dimmable thing is a big factor that is not easily determined but now that I know to search for it I won't get fooled again.  I recommend this bulb for background illumination that does not require dimming.
0394800389|5.0|Dr. Suess really takes the reader for a tounge-twisting, hilarious ride with Fox in Socks. My four-year-old son loves Dr, Suess. We have our very own collection of his books that we ordered book-by-book off of Amazon. All the Dr. Suess books we have found, including Fox in Socks, on Amazon have been purchased at bargain prices. This is a classic story and I got it for a steal from the seller. The book arrived within a week of placing the order and it's in excellent condition. Fox is Socks is a funny book that will make your children and your inner-child smile from ear to ear.
0684874350|5.0|The books came quickly and in better condition than expected.  Very pleased. We are using in the English Department at a high school.
076790592X|5.0|Mitch Albom does a magnificent job at writing a story that teaches the power of friendship and the value of life. I have bought several books from Amazon that were so well written and were so uplifting, that I didn't put them down once until the book was finished. Tuesdays with Morrie: An Old Man, a Young Man, and Life's Greatest Lesson was one of those very books that I read from cover to cover without stopping and without thinking twice about it. This is the most heartfelt, inspirational book I have ever read in all my thirty years. We can get so caught up in the hustle and bustle of daily living that we forget to stop and smell the roses, Morrie is a man who not only stops to smell the roses, but is grateful for every petal on each rose. He teaches his young friend about the meaning of this thing we call life. I want to cry tears of compassion, joy, and sorrow at the very thought of reading this book. I obtained a used copy from a seller on Amazon for just a penny. The book arrived at my house just twelve days after ordering it. Tuesdays with Morrie: An Old Man, a Young Man, and Life's Greatest Lesson is in such great condition that you would never even be able to tell it was a used book.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Great read, really recommend it for any scifi fan. Done in an engaging journal style I found it surprisingly fun to read the trials and travails of the irreverent protagonist.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|For anyone who missed details from earlier episodes, you gotta have these DVD's. Plus, there's nothing better than having them in HD.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Fifty Shades Darker left me wanting more. Look above the sex and you see a very warm and interesting storyline.
B00014NE62|5.0|Maurice was released in 1987. definitely one of the best romances ever made. If you enjoy Downton Abbey, also Brideshead Revisited, you will love this. One of the most touching films you can ever see. The fact that gay people are featured in parts of the story and their choices are shown makes incredible storytelling. You will never forget Maurice. Highly reccommended.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Fifty Shades is not just a book about sex. If you look beyond the sex, there is a great love story behind it.

B0085KGHI6|3.0|I live in Chicago and went to the Checkerboard Lounge as a kid when it was still open.

Some may really dig the candid aspect of the show, but for me...it was ok.

B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I would give it four stars because this book was a funny and good one but it ending the wrong way because there was a lot I wanted to see how he spent his week and that stuff so Jeff Kinney if you see this I am a huge fan but you kinda messed up here you finished to early so if was you that book would be a little longer just saying
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I would recommend this book. It's a fast moving easy read that keeps you coming back for more.<br />5 stars
B0006Z2LP6|5.0|This 2-disc Anniversary edition of the now-classic movie \\"Apollo 13\\" is worth buying just for the extras.  If you have ever wondered exactly how accurate (or not) certain scenes might be, then listen to the audio commentary by Jim and Marilyn Lovell.  You might be surprised that things you maybe thought were just made-up Hollywood gimmicks (such as the scene where Marilyn's wedding ring flies off in the shower and down the drain) really did happen.  The \\"square peg in a round hole\\" filter problem was real, too -- as was the creative way it was solved.<br /><br />Yes, there are a few areas of artistic license, but, as Jim Lovell explains, sometimes that is necessary for the sake of time constraints and to make things clear to the audience. For example, the argument in the capsule (over whose fault it was) didn't really happen that way, but it was an effective scene to get across the very real tension, frustration, and physical discomfort the crew was enduring. On film you can't get into the characters' minds without some sort of action or dialogue.  Lovell did not mind at all that a few liberties were taken with his book to make such an enduring, inspiring movie. The vast majority of the film, he says, was very, very accurate.  A lot of the dialogue was taken directly from the actual flight records.<br /><br />There's also a full audio commentary by director Ron Howard, who is a real stickler for detail (as is Tom Hanks), and who did a great job of making all the technical stuff clear while, at the same time, keeping us on the edge of our seats.  And if that's not enough extras for you, there's a fascinating hour-long \\"making of\\" documentary that intersperses real NASA footage and interviews with the movie to show how very accurate the scenes and sets were -- so much so, that NASA consultants sometimes forgot they were on a movie set and not the real thing!  A second documentary, \\"Conquering Space,\\" gives a nice overview of the space program, and yet a third, \\"Lucky 13:  the Astronauts story\\" gives even more background.<br /><br />Then, of course, there's the movie itself, which remains one of my all-time favorites.  I'm old enough to remember the actual events, and this film brings it all back perfectly.13:  the Astronauts story\\" gives even more background.<br /><br />Then, of course, there's the movie itself, which remains one of my all-time favorites.

B00993FEUK|5.0|i really brought the true horror of modern society to light, emphasizing how fear and segregation going hand in hand leads to greater turmoil and disaster as apposed to solving an issue.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Carefully researched. Technically sound. Intricate plot and sub-plots and hard to put down. I had to also get the Kindle version so I could scale the print size up late at noght when my eyes got blurry.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|What a poor excuse for literature or even erotica for that matter. Anyone who can make Stephanie Meyer look like Shakespeare does not deserve to be a published author.

B004I744AS|5.0|To call this just a &#34;dictionary&#34; is quite an understatement. It's also a thesaurus and a language translator for over 40 languages. Plus there are (as of Version 3.0.3) Word of the Day, Article of the Day, Quote of the Day, This Day in History, Today's Birthday and In the News articles as well as a Horoscope and 6-day Weather forecast. In addition, there are fun and educational games: Spelling Bee, Hangman, Words Within Words and Match Up. All this is attractively presented on the Kindle Fire screen. I only gave it 5 stars because I couldn't find the 6-star button!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Really cool except for that there's no district . Overall very cool especially having district 13 be alive  and running
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Compelling story - I couldn't put it down. It was so good, it really made me want to watch the movie.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|quick to get more for more games<br />love all the different kinds of games.  my favorite is number games. I would suggest it to everyone
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I honestly didn't want anything to do with this book after all the hype that surrounded it last year and how bloody and cruel of a story it seemed to be, but  after getting my first Kindle Fire for Christmas I found the book for five bucks in the kindle store. I was really wanting to get a book in my Kindle, and since it was so cheap, I decided that if I really didn't like the book, I could delete it.  I have to say, it is a good read in a way, but still, the killing and the cruelty is never far away. Even though I read until the end...I really don't think I'll be becoming a fan any time soon.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|I think diary of a wimpy kid was fairly good. It was a little too short and I wish Greg got a girlfriend.

B0063IH60K|4.0|good version of solitaire. and it's free! has plenty of dealing options. wish it had other solitaire games though. have fun
B008KEQM3W|3.0|I should have known better.  With an attractive group of actors, some of which have been very good, I was looking for a little light hearted comedy.  The story involves 4 couples trying to have a baby, another who wasn't and another foursome that has already done it.  Some know each other, some don't but eventually cross paths at some point.<br /><br />For the been-there-done-that group, it is dominated by 4 men who have been relegated to regular walks in the park with their brood.  I think the biggest laugh I got from the movie was when the men come marching down the sidewalk, four abreast in their pimped out strollers (complete with portable fans).  In slow motion of course.  Chris Rock as Vic is the defacto leader of the group and gets most of the good lines.<br /><br />Other couplings include Brooklyn Decker and Dennis Quaid (a former NASCAR champion).  His character is also the father of Ben Falcone's character who is married to Wendy (Elizabeth Banks).  None of those couplings make any sense.  Banks actually is pretty good as the champion of breast feeding and manages to get a few laughs.  The other pairs are Cameron Diaz and Matthew Morrison (yawn) and Rodrigo Santoro (a Mark Anthony look-a-like) and Jennifer Lopez.  Then there is Chace Crawford and Anna Kendrick who aren't really together and certainly aren't looking to get preggers.<br /><br />The biggest issue with the film is that it works just like every other romcom you can think of coming out of Hollywood.  You can guess the punch lines and certainly the outcomes.  There are too many characters and the comedy is hit or miss.  Mostly misses.  I suspect the film will have some limited appeal and isn't horrible.  I was just hoping for better.  I should have known better.
B009POCG5Y|3.0|I disagree with some of the other reviewers - this is NOT Clint's best movie - far from it.  But, it is a likeable movie and an interesting (although unrealistic) plot line.  Most of the material has been done before; estranged father/daughter issues, love story, good overcomes bad, etc.  I would say that there was some miscasting (especially Timberlake), but I still enjoyed the movie.  I watched it once, but I would not watch it again.  There is nothing endearing to the movie that would make me want to keep it.  I will pass it along to others who have not seen it.  Clint's acting is very good, and fits perfectly with his character.  The love story between his daughter and Timberlake is disjointed and forced...IMHO.  Rent it, don't buy it, until you have seen it.
B009O07NMA|4.0|Some good tunes.  Nice debut album, looking forward to this groups a follow-on release in the not too distant future.
B0075MFS9Y|3.0|I like the one \\"Ho Hey\\" song, the rest I may have to get used to over time.  At least the group is a refreshing change of pace to the some-old-thing that seems to be out there today.
B004EPYZV2|4.0|Good story and everything you've come to expect from Cruise as he chooses to accept another fun mission. Lots of fun and action, Thanks to all the creative forces responsible.
B0074MZSWW|3.0|I really like some of the songs on this CD, and I really dislike the others.  I think over time I might grow to like the others, but right now they have been deleted from my playlist.  The likeable songs are listened to over and over.  Seems as if they just threw songs on a CD with no rhyme or reason.  You may want to simply listen to the songs, and then only download the MP3s that you want.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is a very handy app if you cant find your calculator  plus (no pun intended) its free so I give it five stars ***** lol
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This is a great series with lots of tension and twists and turns.  It keeps you riveted to the screen and it is well acted.  Love the characters.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This was such a great hidden object game. The back story with the dolls and dollhouse was great also. I would highly recommend this game to any fan of hidden objects games!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I stumbled upon this book series while looking for something new to read. I couldn't put it down. The stories have excellent character development, powerful imagery and a story that keeps you thinking well after you put the book down. Throw in the fact of a very reasonable price from an Indie writer and you have a pure winner.Written and delivered electronically while the author is rewarded as opposed to big business publishing houses is a true meritocracy. My congratulations go to the author Hugh C. Howey. Now finish the rough draft of Wool 8, I can't wait.
B0026PW67W|1.0|Another review helped me so let me help you!  If you buy the Harry Potter Film Wizardry Book which is on this Amazon for ruffly $25 you will get this exact map as well as an awesome book and a lot of other really cool Harry Potter extras including the acceptance letter to Harry to attend Hogwarts as well as an invitation to the Ball.  There's much more.  Look at the book to see all.  I was unsure at first but when I checked out the book I couldn't believe it.  This was one of my sons favorite Christmas presents, sooooo worth it.  Make sure you look at which book you are buying there is a newer version with fewer reviews but the same except for added details of The Deathly Hallows!!!!!<br />Actual book is way beyond 5 stars!!!!!

B000AGTPUK|5.0|Excellent film. Tom Hanks is great and their animation is wonderful. This is great &#34;family&#34; film. Get everybody together and enjoy.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It has been such a long time that's book captured me in the way this one did. I couldn't put it down! Gillian Flynn leaves small nuggets through out the story that you know will be used again and you can't wait to find out how!!
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's entertaining. A good game if u like to build cities. A good time consumer if u r board. Very enjoyable.
B007HU7NBK|5.0|I love biographies and this did not disappoint. John's story is entertaining, witty, and keeps you intrigued. He focuses on himself and his life's experiences with Duran Duran and growing up in general. I loved his honesty about himself, his short comings, his ups and downs, his struggles with accepting himself for who he was and who he wanted to be. His writing style is inviting, conversational, and draws you in. I enjoyed this book and did not want to put it down.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Having so much fun with this.  This is all new to me but it is like being at the fair in my younger years.  Can't put it down.
B006LSZECO|3.0|After reading so many positive reviews everywhere (not just on Amazon), I caved and bought the book.  The first few chapters were ok, a little boring, but I continued on. Then the story grabbed me, I was hooked, and couldn't put the book down. In that aspect, it is an enjoyable read. However, the ending is...I don't know... bad, disappointing, anti-climatic. It definitely left a bad taste, so much so that I will not bother to read another of Flynn's novels. I think the ending could have been a million times better, but its like Flynn got tired of the story and decided to just end it as quickly as possible. She should have written two books, the before and after, so to speak (don't want to give anything away). I gave it three stars because the writing did have me hooked, for the most part, but the ending is so dull compared to the rest of the book.

B00A8ECU24|5.0|I absolutely love it! its incredibely fun and addictive! the graphics are great, the mini games are real fun and its not difficult at all to advance in the game,  you dint have to wait much time to win coins and stuff,  and that make s it really playable.
1433502410|5.0|I started reading the ESV about a year ago and love it. I bought this study bible for myself last summer and with how much I use it for my morning quite times I decided to also buy one for my brother for Christmas.<br />It is a big book to carry around with you but the amount of information it holds makes it that way. I love using the large concordance in the back and reading the commentary when I am not sure how to read a passage. I also love the cross references.<br />I would highly recommend this bible
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I gave this only 4 stars because I played just the &quot;free&quot; part so far.  I'm curious as to what the rest of it is like so I'm going to buy it so I can unlock it.  So far, I like it.

B0094K1PW4|5.0|Great science fiction movie.  Taut suspense and drama.  Realistic film about kids making home movie at an old railroad depot.  Military train has tremendous wreck and veiled warning to the kids by the man involved.  So far, only realism, no fantasy or science fiction.  Odd things start happening and alien/monster gradually makes appearance half way into movie, but not graphically as in a horror movie. Something to do with the military and strange cube objects, but connection left suspensefully murky.  I could not tell how the plot would unfold or what the ending would be.<br /><br />Super movie for those who like realistic drama with a science fiction twist.

I also liked the male main character who was a &#34;what you see is what you get&#34;, once you got to know him.  The incidental characters and the other guests were also interesting and it was an easy read.

B002RI9ZPY|5.0|This is one book that I can truly say I could not put it down.  I was like some exhausted freak who read it night and day until I finished it, a most gripping and enthralling read and I loved the style and language.  The only negative criticism I have is to do with the cross  examination of the psychiatrist in the District Court, I thought his responses are a little far fetched.  I would have thought that a leading psychiatrist would be better able to see what was coming and would control the proceedings in a more realistic way.  I also liked the surprise ending if a little far fetched!

So Tried deleting every thing to start over again. it says the memory is full. 2. sent message to customer support and got no information that was relevant to resolve the issue of deleting the response was that it shows an approximate storage. Ok I if I delete everything it ought to be zero or close to it not half used up. Finally decided I waisted way to much time on something that ought to not be that challenging to use.

B00AHSIQWE|2.0|I was so disappointed with this film that I felt I had to write a review. As a big fan of this Batman series, I greatly anticipated the release of Dark Knight Rises. This movie, however, did not measure up to the others. The plot line was not compelling, the pace was not exciting. The villain was pretty lame and Batman against the villain was pretty lame. The Anne Hathaway Christian Bale matchup was lackluster as there was no chemistry between the two actors. The movie was long and it felt it. Of course, you will watch this to see the conclusion of the trilogy, just don't go in with high expectations for an exciting and nail biting conclusion.

Without ruining the ending, I will say that I was disappointed with how it ended, although at the same time, I was able to draw several examples from my own life that I could relate to the book.  Interesting and makes you think about the dynamics of relationships and compromises.
1589946006|5.0|I received these as a gift for Christmas '12. There are six large figures and twenty-four small figures. The large figures are big enough to be baby safe. The small figures would be choking hazards. The plastic is tough and durable. The color is creepy and crisp. The detail of the casting is fantastic; even the small figures have wonderful detail! We haven't had any gaming opportunities since the '12 holidays, but I anticipate using these as counters or handing them out as prizes for LAN parties. There were a lot of them for not a lot of money. I am really impressed with the quality. I wish Wizards of the Coast plastic miniatures were this high quality. These would make great stocking stuffers or play things for the office. Replace chess pieces or checkers and enjoy some Cthulhus instead. :-)
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|What can I say. It got here fast, works like it should and I have no complaints. I love this movie. Awesome!
B008I43DYU|5.0|The Calculator Pro is so easy to use and the size of the numbers makes it very easy to read.  An excellent, handy calculator that I would recommend for anyone regardless of age.
1906263280|5.0|I got this for a friend and he loves it! He listens to it over and over. He loves it! Great deal for the price too.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so fun I asked to get it on my mom's and dad's phone. You make your own worlds!You should get this game.Takes a while to learn to play it.Just be careful on survile mode because there are grass monsters archery zombies zombies and spiders.
B000002O1Q|5.0|What can I say. It got here fast, works like it should and I have no complaints. I love this album. Awesome!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't put it down!  The author switches gears in this book and takes the story in a little bit of a new direction.
1452101248|5.0|I love that this recipe book is divided by main ingredient.  The eastern flare makes everthing taste new.  There are some spices to purchase that are not part of the adverage american/european spice shelf. Favorite new ingredient - pomegranite molasses.  There is a great podcast interviewing Yotam on America's Test Kitchen.
B0050R0YB8|5.0|I am deaf. That great I love it!  Last Dec .25.2012 My nephew is very happy! He did hold the box don't take away &#34;MY&#34;. He like big star war.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Saw this its second day of release and wanted to turn right back and watch it again--no exaggerating!  Looking forward to Feb 5th to add this to my collection.  Denzel gives us another oscar-winning performance showing all sides of the character professionally and in the charcter's personal life.  The story is great-makes you think-how do you know who is really flying the plane you're on!  Don Cheadle, as Whip's (Washington) lawyer is also a plus in this movie-makes you wonder what lengths lawyers go to protect clients-or is it just airline lawyers?? I felt that Cheadle's character knew how flawed/guilty Whip was but did so much to portray him as innocent.  And John Goodman-does anyone else think Best Supporting Actor??<br />While some say an over-the-top performance, I say right on!!  What a surprise (shock?) when he explodes into the room and spouts his \\"cure-all\\" recommendations.  I thought he was priceless!  But it is Denzel's portrayal of Whip and the wonderful story that makes it a movie to watch and re-watch-definetly a collector's item.  See it, buy it, you will not be disappoited-TRUST ME.  OSCAR all the way!
B003EV6DBM|4.0|I got it on time.  I am a completist and an avid 11th Doctor fan.  It came as advertised and I would highly recommend getting it just for the complete change of how the 11th Doctor operates within Steven Moffat's governing ideas.
6305212112|5.0|A great story-great cast.  So moving, it had me crying toward the end, and that hasn't happened in a long time.  This is a movie I will tell others about, lend it (only to those who I know where they live) and watch it again and again.  Fanny Flagg's books have always given me so very much enjoyment with her great stories and well developed characters.  Wish all her books would become movies!  Highly recommend  this-it is superb!!  You will love it!
159102594X|5.0|I got it on time.  I did order the near to fast rate and while I didn't expect it to come from Indiana, the tracking was easy, and I got it in the mail.  I highly recommend the near to fast rate and it is worth the extra charge.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|This is a great app and so easy to use It makes transfering my files,photos & music between my different devices so quick and simple.I introduced this to a friend who also thinks its great.He takes a picture of his grand kids transfer them to drop box & within sec.their on his computer at home for his family to look at and download.
0316228532|3.0|I had to read this book but would have given up after the first few chapters if I didn't have to keep going. I almost always finish books, so for me to consider quitting is a statement in its self...however, I really loved the last 100 pages or so and almost wished I could go back and reread it to figure out what I had missed the first time through. But 400 pages of dread vs 100 pages of joy...hmm, don't think it balances out!<br /><br />The issue with this book was that there were a lot of characters to keep track of, they were all interwoven, but in sort of a confusing way. A lot of the names were similar (I couldn't keep Gavin and Colin straight) and really, for the first 400 pages I didn't care.<br /><br />Also, I never read the Harry potter books, so I had no expectations - good or bad.
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|A quirky story with some great actors, but the two unknown young actors steal the show! Fun movie set in a great location.
B000IYU9IG|5.0|My all time favourite western. Love the humour and the magic between The Duke and Maureen O'Hara and the rest of the John Wayne posse of performers.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|VEry Very fun played ite every day i have had it so far I would pay for this app worth it
B005VPRF9I|5.0|This is what he wanted - and it was exactly correct - when it is right it is right - done
B001AVCFJM|5.0|this was a great movie and special edition was worth it I always want to watch it with my  son
B007FRHZ4A|5.0|i bought this for my son and he loved it. my little cousin requested this for xmas and i got it for him thru amazon and defiantly beat the price at the store for the same quality. im glad i got it here and next time i will check here before purchasing toys at the store.
B00772M1F6|5.0|McPhersons retro sound is captivating.  I find myself putting this album on repeat often. I highly recommend this record to anyone who appreciates good music!
B0087JTAKW|4.0|This feel good novel is makes its point without being preachy. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because at times I felt the character of Sarah (a teenage girl) didn't act or speak the way a typical teenage girl would act. Perhaps it's because  the novel was written by an adult male. Otherwise  I have no complaints. A great feel good easy read.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|The dynamic of Enzo the dog being the narration throughout the book was enthralling.  When I wasn't reading the book, I caught myself walking down the street, seeing a dog, and automatically forming logical thoughts for them.  The book never seemed to be a stretch, it was accurate in the way that all of Enzo's thoughts and actions made perfect sense.  This book includes such description and a rollercoaster storyline with a touching ending.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|You will laugh, you will cry, you will curse profusely at your screen--and this is what make this TV show such a good one to watch. Each episode is a new twister which will have you watching through the whole season like an addict looking for a fix. Watch it! I regret not having seen this show earlier!!
B001EN71DG|4.0|I was disappointed that the 3 DVD's were not in the pictured cover box.  Each of the 3 DVD's were in original cases and sealed
B0091REZMW|2.0|This game is only free until you run out of diamonds. You must use diamonds to pay for everything so you run out pretty quickly. Definitely not a good hidden object game.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|It's a ridiculously addictive soap opera. Okay, so there's a lot more grisly death by arrows and sword than most soap operas have, but that's all right. It's difficult to put down, and the different storylines are neatly mixed together. I like how the author doesn't really fall into the trap of good guys vs. bad guys that a lot of fantasy fiction goes into.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is one of the best series I have read in a long time. Would recommend it for all to read.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Are you a long time music nut? Do you go to places like Target or Best Buy to buy headphones and despair at your two choices: 1. extremely expensive and bulky noise reduction headphones or, 2. ear buds or other wiry contraptions that - if your ears are like mine - never stay in place and are universally inferior in sound? Do you begin to realize how old you are for demanding better options in format and sound quality and wonder what the hell young music buyers hear when they plug into their little digital worlds? Yeah, me too.<br /><br />These Sony headphones are just like the old headphones you grew up with, mostly. Of course, they are smaller than those suckers we plugged into our 8-track components and boom boxes way-back-when, but the concept is still the same. No re-invention of the wheel here. They produce terrific, clear, and loud tones for the price (a little low on the bass end, however), and are well worth the price for the few months you'll get out of them (invariably, one side will conk out after about three months of heavy use....but hey, for $10 it's worth it!).<br /><br />If Sony stops making these, I'll have to submit to the $50 and up prices. Please do not forsake me Sony-san!
B008MWBY6W|4.0|I have a Canon D5 Mark II SLR camera with a 24-105 zoom lens.  It easily fits inside this Amazon camera case. Previously I was using a [[ASIN:B000TY1EES Lowepro Cirrus TLZ 15 Holster Style Case For Digital SLR & Short Zoom Lens (Black)]] case. My Canon camera fit inside the Lowepro case very snugly.  But it doesn't have any zipper pockets on it like this Amazon camera bag. There is enough extra room inside the case to put some other things, but I don't want to insert anything to rub against my camera or lens body. I'm not sure what I can put inside the case to utilize the extra space not occupied by the camera.<br /><br />The camera strap is first class - nice and wide with a good shoulder pad. So aside from the cavernous interior to the outer pockets to the strap, it makes a very nice camera case. However, I do prefer the internal fit of the Lowpro with its thick padding. But the Amazon case has much more storage compartment storage. This is quite a big camera case that should accept most any Digital SLR camera and moderate sized lens. It is a very good value overall.
B008N1LL42|4.0|This movie has it all, crazy hero guy, hot lookin babe, aliens, gun battles. I really liked this movie. I'm not one to go into specifics but, we win. Hope ya like it
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is a great strategy game which allows you to destroy the world by releasing a deadly virus into it.  My plan was simple: release a simple little plague into the atmosphere, and then when things started going bad offer an antidote for an insanely large amount of money.  Unfortunately,  my virus was a good one.  Too good.  Now I've got the sniffles and am developing a deep cough...
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|What a way to conclude one the all time best Batman franchises.. even the extras were all star. I could recognize almost every single one line extra in the movie... lets not even talk about the main cast...all I have to say is...Wow, this movie was perfectly done.
B007T967X4|5.0|downloaded 3 apps for my children to work on their music theory.  this is by far the best one.  very cute and age appropriate.  went ahead and downloaded bass cat as well!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I liked the Coin Dozed its fun to play.I enjoy a lot.I play any time I can at work.park on the road
B002BWP49C|5.0|I bought this movie for my mother for Christmas, and she really loved it. She is eagerly awaiting  part 2!
B00AE6SS5O|4.0|who can resist a game about Christmas it downloads good no glitches good game for any age enjoyable and fun
B001UV4XIS|5.0|It was really good! I reallly liked it! As does my father and mother and brother and sister-in-law. It was epic.
B00ATPVA78|5.0|got this game for free so far it is really enjoyable I like HO games that require you to find the objects and then figure out what has to be done in order to proceed
B003O86FMW|5.0|This plot will keep you guessing. But I won't say much in fear of it being an unintentional spoiler. Great read
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I love the Bourne series and this was no exception. I liked how they tied the whole story together. I would have liked more closure on the &#34;BAD&#34; guys at the end :)
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is soooo coool!! I'm playing this all day trying to unlock all its blades and background pictures. Super fun. It's also.much better than the one that costs money. I recommend this for children, or people that are bored. Not meaning that this game is boring. You should really get it for whatever reason! And the good thing about it is that it's free!
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|Having been born during the war years (1943) I was, for the most part, led to believe that the enemy was pure evil while those wearing the American uniform were fair, honest and brave.  This idea was reinforced in just about every movie and book released during the years following the war.  While I understand this view may have been carthargic for those having lived through those horrible times (military and civilians), it was, nonetheless, an unrealistic accounting of events.  Good and evil, honor and shame, are human qualities which can be found anywhere.  Heroes and villians are not determined by the uniform they wear.  I feel this book gives the reader a more realistic view of those we once considered our &#34;enemy&#34;.<br /><br />Had there been more detailed accounts of the air battles mentioned I would have given this book 5 stars.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Love this game soooo much! It keeps me entertained all day! I admit, I get a little upset when I can't beat the level, but I just look up some cheats! Hehe... om nom is too cute! Awesome game!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|So far, I really do like ths app as I use a calculator quite often...both on my phone & on my computers.  It is easy to use and was simple to download.  Great app.!
B004ZQRJH2|3.0|I have no idea about the content myself. They said they enjoy it. It was part of a Christmas gift package.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I liked the book alot.. it got me interested and now I'm ready for the last book. I didn't like how some of the chapters had sections that the events were rushed and I couldn't follow what was going on. Other than that, awesome book.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This was a Christmas gift to a 17-year-old grandson, who is a member of a new band, and a marvelous guitar player. He collects music CD's by certain bands and groups that he prefers. He is very careful about the music he selects. He is also writing some music at this time.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|was blown out of my seat after the pilot re aired. plus I only caught the second half. way to go CM
B000063147|4.0|I gave this to my Grandson as a gift. He seemed to enjoy it. It's one of his favorite bands. He's 17.
B008QE9XD2|4.0|Dark Shadows is an okay movie, especially if you haven't lost your affinity for Depp/ Burton. The atmosphere is rich and gothic, just what you'd want from this movie. However it dabbles a bit too much in soapy melodrama, and that pulls the overall rating down somewhat. The story lacks pace at times, but it's forgivable - all the interesting characters make up in that department.<br /><br />On the technical side, though, this DVD follows the pattern Warner Home Video has been using on all their DVD releases recently: A not so polished transfer (edge enhancement is quite visible at times, and the black levels leaves you wanting), and then one bonus feature - it is the longest feature from the Blu-Ray, but even so, 7 minutes is not much.<br />In the audio department, you won't be disappointed - everything sounds like it should at this point.<br /><br />This movie is worth sinking your teeth into - give it a rent!
B003J7HOKU|5.0|I can tell you that my 17-year-old grandson, who is excellent at music, a wonderful guitar player, and a member of a new band, really likes this CD! He enjoys this groups music! He is fussy about the music he listens to and wants in his collection.
B000076CY6|5.0|I'm in the process of collecting all the Lego Lord of the Rings sets, and I honestly wasn't very excited about this one. But now that I own it - it's GREAT! Probably my 2nd favorite (behind Moria).<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Sweet mini-figures! The Uruk-hai looks SICK! Lurtz is pretty neat too. The Mordor Orcs aren't super exciting, BUT they're really versatile. They look pretty good with the Moria Orcs (yay! bigger Moria army) and they look pretty good with the Uruks when decked out in helmets, armor, and shields (yay! bigger Isengard army).<br /><br />Comes with 2 extra Uruk swords and 1 extra helmet and breastplate. Not bad, but could have more extras.<br /><br />Really interestingly designed - they've jammed a lot of cool things to play with into it. And it looks super orc-ish - rough, sharp, bits of scaffolding everywhere.<br /><br />I'm an engineering student, and this set has SO MUCH POTENTIAL for awesome modifications. For example, I rebuilt it into an orc-ish looking steam engine powering an elevator, with a huge furnace that has flames shooting out the sides of it and (of course) lights up. (Okay, yeah, I needed to steal 2 pieces from the ballista in the Uruk-hai Army set.)<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />A Saruman minifig would've been nice. But I'm hoping that he'll show up in one of the Hobbit sets that'll be released later.<br /><br />It's Lego, therefore it's super expensive :(
B000V6BE6C|4.0|This was a holiday gift to my 17-year-old grandson who is a musician. He plays the guitar and is a member of a new band, and also writes some music. He has certain bands and groups that he likes, and this is one of them. He collects the work of those that he admires.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|Kate Morton is a great storyteller and a gifted writer.  Her prose is vivid and beautifully crafted.  The characters are well-developed and like-able.  The historical context in which she sets her stories is well researched.  The ending is ALWAYS a surprise.
B004LWZWBU|4.0|I bought this movie for my married daughter as she loved it. I also saw the film, and I liked it very much. It was quite funny, and much better than many movies today.Steve Martin was very good in the film. It was quite enjoyable!!
1582701709|5.0|I got to movie some years ago, lent it to a friend and never got it back. So I decided to buy the book. This book is definitely a book to be added to your library as a reference if you are into self help and manifesting. It is for everybody but not everybody will &#34;get it&#34;.
B00005OMTT|3.0|This was a gift during the holiday season to a young man. He said he enjoys it. He collects their work.
B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|variation of little mermaid, japanese style.  Famed director has done a lot of similar looking movies.  Girls under 10 should enjoy it.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I think this is a fun game and a wonderful time passer, I give it a 10/10!  Thank you for the awesome game
B008ELUEQC|4.0|Rod Stewart is very good on this Cd. I liked it very much. His style is very distinctive and i would recommend this to others.
B0058VA2U4|5.0|Anthrax is back and is at the top of their game!  Bought this album on a whim and have to say it is my surprise album of the year!  Simply fantastic!  Probably their best album to date.
B005WYFLNU|5.0|I love these pads.  My daughter will play independtly with this for an hour (which is major around here!). The stickers only stick to the special pages so you don't have to worry about stickers being put places they shouldn't be.  They only thing I have to get over is all the little sticker pieces to pick up.
030758836X|3.0|I loved the book until the last few chapters. Part of me is disappointed because I was so engrossed I feel like the end was a slap in the face. It seems that is what the author was going for. If so, bravo. I read the book in 8 hours. I can't lie when I say I couldn't put it down. I become so wrapped up in a novel I don't want to do anything else until I finish it. I don't always have that chance so this was a lovely lazy Sunday read.<br /><br />(SPOILERS BELOW! SPOILERS BELOW--SCROLL IF YOU DID NOT READ THE BOOK!!!!)<br /><br />What I have issue with (again, I repeat: SPOILERS! SPOILERS!)<br /><br />*Everything hinges on Amy being 3 steps ahead of everyone and thinking of every angle and twist. I appreciate that and admit her cunning and obsessive nature made for an interesting read. You love to hate her. Like a bad soap opera villainess.<br />Desi wasn't well thought out. He was an escape. He was a last ditch effort at surviving without having to earn money for herself. So she could not have planned his whereabouts while she was missing. The author makes a point to describe how up his arse his mother is. What about his July 5th alibi? He lived 40 minutes away. The cops checked him out and he was cleared. I believe they even mention early on he has an alibi or he's not even considered a suspect. How did all of that disappear? I know she planted physical evidence. But the cops were so on top of Nick over his lack of alibi the morning of the disappearance. They didn't try to find out where Desi was. Even if his mother looked desperate--the man was wealthy and went out for expensive lunches and outings and rubbed elbows with other rich people. I wish they explored that avenue.<br /><br />*Her interview was hollow. I know as the reader I had all the inside info and therefore knew her testimony was b.s. But she gave waaaaaaay too much information to be an innocent victim. She had all the details of the investigation. They didn't think it was a little odd the rapist wentout of his way to tell her everything and plant a lot of evidence?<br /><br />*Why wouldn't the vomit count as evidence that she was crazy? Her testimony was a sweet and innocent angle \\"oh gee gosh golly I did get sick I don't know why\\" but then suddenly she's had her vomit frozen all this time? Why didn't the sperm bank count as evidence that he did want children? They could have had record of them trying so he wouldn't look like he did not want kids at all. If they checked out the sperm bank in trying to prove he actually did want children they would have found she authorized his semen to be frozen.<br /><br />I guess it all boils down to my disappointment over how her arrival was handled. Even if the ending remained the same I wish they explored the process of proving it was Desi as she said it was instead of just moving along. The pacing was great throughout the book but the last few chapters seemed to speed along as if she was tired of going into too much detail. I know I am totally overanalyzing--but isn't that what the book is about? How Amy overanalyzed and plotted and planned?<br /><br />Overall, I did enjoy the book. It was a good read. I just wish the pacing didn't change at the end. And yes, I am one of those disappointed in the ending.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|Sequels are rarely better than the first movie in a series but this movie is undoubtably better than the first, and the firt was great. This movie has great comical moments a well as moments of action, suspense, and the slow motion sequences are funomenal. Great purchase.
0525952926|5.0|This is a great follow up to the &#34;Fall of Giants&#34;. I am looking forward to the next in the trilogy!
B00003CX95|5.0|From the large battles to the intimate conversations of this film it is a fantastic movie all the way through. Probably Mel Gibson's best performance. This is the kind I movie that is too classi not to see. A must buy.
B002APU580|5.0|I really enjoyed this telling of the classic tale. Sure, if glosses over some parts as films must; but the setting and costumes looked so much more authentic than any other film I can recall which depicts life in this era. Plus it's just a classic story in general. Highly recommended.
B000LC55F2|5.0|Perhaps the best mind bending movie I have ever seen. Like many of Christopher Nolan's movies the Prestige will you keep you interested and guessing from beginning to end. The performances of Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are both as good as any. This movie is a definite buy and watch many times.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I loved the movie and have viewed it several times. I am a Jane Austin fan and have read all of her books and seen all of her movies.  This one is a good adaptation of her book
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|No dvd problems good packaging great old series. Lots of old time stars in it. Nice includes the movies also
B0035HKWLW|5.0|Awesome classic movie!! highly recommended, always good to watch with family and friends, good high definition on tv, A+A+A, excellent
B0076DELIG|5.0|Another great Michael Connelly novel, riveting, entertaining and bringing Harry Bosch's character alive! Eagerly await the next book in the Harry Bosch series.
B008QYT7DI|5.0|I can't believe it took me until adult-hood to read this book! It's a beautiful read for children and adults alike.
0062200909|5.0|Short review from the guy who always watches the many hours of \\"making of\\" materials that Peter Jackson always inclines on DVD. If that describes you, then you will enjoy this book. It will deepen the respect for the level of detail that Weta brings, and the next time you view the movie, it will be with fresh eyes.
B004HO6I4W|5.0|My granddaughters love this movie! The music and colorful birds dancing are a big hit with them and their friends.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Since I live in the middle Georgia area where some of this movie was shot I wanted to watch, plus<br />I'm a big Eastwood fan now more than ever.
B006CEYM3Y|5.0|According to the gameplayer in our house, this is the best game published in 2011. He waited to buy until 2012 just to be sure it was the best!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|If you are used to a PC type file interface this app will help you feel right at home on the Kindle Fire HD.  Without it, it can be a bit challanging to find files and folders on the device.  This app lays everything out in a very easy to navigate file structure.  Makes it so easy to load my own music from my PC on to the device.  Allows you to see the properties of all the various files and apps you have.  Pretty handy, I highly recommend it.
B0049CVUNG|1.0|Didn't realize it was formatted for German dvd players only so unable to play on my dvd.  Would have been nice to know this before I purchased.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|This case holds the Kindle Fire HD securely.  Much less expensive than many cases The ability to prop the Kindle up is quite handy as you can adjust it to just about any angle.  The inside surface that touches the face of the device is soft and doesn't mar the glass.  You just have to make sure you keep this inside surface clean.  When the cover is folded completely back, so that your holding the Kindle flat, this soft inside surface becomes the back.  So if you lay it down, this soft inside surface can pick up whatever is on the surface it's laying on.  Quite satisfied so far.
B008X9Z37A|1.0|OK for what it was but found another about the same price that was superior. Would not recommend to anyone.
B0074JODP8|5.0|Another great perfomance by Joe Bonamassa with amazing performance by Beth Hart - main reason I bought this DVD. Excellent video and audio.
B0054X3FQO|5.0|I loved Miranda`s emphasis on the power of positivity and our thoughts. Overall, a great and easy read, with questions worth answering.
B006UREQ3Y|5.0|Slash, Myles and the band rock the house like it should be done by true rock'n'rollers. Raw power, excellent music and well directed. Anybody who loves rock should get it and play it loud!
0843198907|5.0|My 6 year old granddaughter loves these Little Miss books.  She's received several of them over the years. They're easy for her to understand.
B0041VIJQG|5.0|I approached this album with no real expectations. Though I really love most Plant solo material, I was not moved at all by Raising Sand and just thought this would be more of the same. Boy was I wrong. I can listen to this album everyday and not grow tired. As a huge Zeppelin fan, I was very disappointed the band didn't launch a final tour after the '07 show in London. After listening to Band of Joy, I think Plant made the right decision. This is who he has evolved into as a solo artist and i have enjoyed seeing his growth as an artist. He doesn't get enough credit for being true to himself and following his muse. I am anxiously awaiting his next step down that path.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I loved this book oh sorry I mean \\"DICTIONARY\\" no I didn't I nowhere near read page 1 give me a break, who would read this \\"400000\\" pages of a DICTIONARY really really really give me $20,000,000 ( dick·tion·ary) thanks
B009PNQUXO|1.0|I don't know what this is used for. I thought it was a link to youtube but whenever i search for a video it won't play anything.
0307887448|3.0|I have just finished the book. Judging from all the recommendations I thought it would be much, much better. It reads like a novel written for teens, in terms of style and depth of plot, and yet it is full of references that only 40ish people will likely get.<br /><br />The book failed to grip me during its initial phase. It got better, in terms of attracting my attention, from halfway through until the end. But by the end I felt like I had read through several pages of a wikipedia on the 80s. I did not feel much connected to any of the characters.<br /><br />I must say, though, that it was fun seeing in how many ways the author was able to weave cultural references from the 80s in the text -- and that this approach was quite original. I did finish the book, and don't regret reading it. I think a movie would probably look good (if only for the spaceships and robot battles). I wouldn't go for a sequel of the book, though.<br /><br />&lt;spoilers beyond this point><br /><br />A few specific flaws irked me. One clear example is the set-up. The book is written in the 1st person, Wade writing about how he won the contest. Yet right from the beginning he goes to explain what a stack was, what was the Oasis, what a private chat-room worked like, so on an so forth. Well, who is he writing to, I wonder. It could only be for people in his time period or beyond -- I imagine he is not sending the book back in time -- so he should not explain all that. A more subtle and able writer would not explain such things in detail, but let us deduct.<br /><br />Another minor point (I admit is is minor) is when the author fumbles the units while describing the modest one-room apartment he rented in Columbus, Ohio. This modest room, which belongs to a building which used to be (in our current days) a hotel, is \\"basically a cube, about ten meters long on each side\\". Think about that, if you are not familiar with metric units: a cube 30 feet high, 30 feet deep, 30 feet wide. In other words, a 1,076 square feet apartment with a 30-feet high ceiling -- and a single window. This was another reality check failure to me.<br /><br />Another example: Wade was hairless (not even eyebrows), as most serious gunters were, when he was taken into custody by the IOI, put naked, and \\"soaped, scrubed, disinfected, rinsed, dried and deloused\\". Even if louse do live in hairless people (which I doubt) this phrase is illustrative of the style -- and lack of sublety -- of the overall text. Did we need so many words here?076 square feet apartment with a 30-feet high ceiling -- and a single window.

B0095ZMMCK|5.0|JacK Ryan's son continues the dynasty of spying and intrigue.  It is a fast paced read which is hard to put down.  The reader thinks &#34; How are they going to get out of this mess.?  The characters we have met before are in great danger which causes tension and concern. One  wonders how the author gets such vivid detail without getting into some trouble himself. Clearly he is  very very close the current reality that we see in the newswhich creates a biting edge for the reader.

B006RXQ800|4.0|Once I realized that this was not a story about the New York Mafia, I was very interested in seeing just how closely history was followed about this troublesome era.  Troublesome both for NY and for the country.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that much of what was dramatized is accurate.  I am a native New Yorker and have always been interested in the difficult strife that describes these times.  It reminds me that nothing is new under the sun, although many minorities today seem to think that they are.  The hope, as hinted at in the film, is that things will get better in time and we should not lose that hope.  Certainly worth viewing.
B0071XO8RA|1.0|I did not get what I thought I was buying based on the description. The writing does evoke emotions but not the ones I'd want for light reading over lunch. Depressing, boring, and typical of the apocolyptic genre it apparently belongs to. No thanks. What a waste of money. Amazon should work on their \\"suggestions\\" algorithm because nothing I've ever purchased should have pointed to this. Deleted.

B007OWRBJK|3.0|I purchased Pete Townshend's memoir, \\"Who I Am,\\" with modest expectations. It didn't meet them. Heck, I couldn't even be bothered to finish it. But that's OK.<br /><br />\\"Who I Am\\" shares one problem with most other rock memoirs, but it also has problems of its own.<br /><br />Most rock memoirs start off the same way: The artist as a child and as an adolescent. The artist is first exposed to music. The artist starts performing (solo or with a band). The artist, somehow, starts to get noticed. The details tend to be banal, resembling accounts that could be offered by countless other bands and performers. What distinguishes the memoirist from those countless others is talent. But you can't capture in print the essence of that talent, or the transcendent nature of music.<br /><br />So if a rock memoir is to succeed, it's as history; as gossip; as a chronicle. \\"Who I Am\\" has little to offer in that regard.<br />It comes across mostly as a sort of diary, an account of what happened and who did what to whom. That's probably the least interesting aspect of Townshend's life; his attempts to add drama to some ho-hum events are unavailing.<br /><br />Aside from offering some sophistry about growing up in the shadow of war and the prospect of nuclear Armageddon, he gives little sense of the times. For example, his description of the early days of mod subculture is beyond skimpy. Someone with the eye of a social historian or a novelist could have produced a compelling account.<br /><br />And he doesn't provide much insight into the other members of the Who. Perhaps there's not much insight to be had. For one thing, it may be that Keith Moon and John Entwistle both had little of interest to offer besides their music.<br /><br />The same perhaps applies to Townshend; that might explain why I found \\"Who I Am\\" to be pedestrian. To bring a memoir to life, you need imagination, perspective, and empathy, qualities that aren't likely to be found in someone who has, plausibly enough, described himself in song as \\"a faker, a paper clown.\\"<br /><br />Furthermore, it appears that Townshend has trouble stringing together a straightforward narrative. The plot underlying \\"Quadrophenia\\" seems simple enough, but \\"Tommy\\" flirted with the boundaries of coherence, and \\"Lifehouse\\" collapsed under the weight of its own bombast. In my twenties I purchased a copy of \\"Horse's Neck,\\" his collection of short stories, but it remained unread. As a writer, Townshend is a great musician.<br /><br />But who cares! What matters to me about Pete Townshend is his music--I've listened to it more than anyone else's music. I could get what's missing from \\"Who I Am\\"--for example, an account of the mod subculture--from other sources. But I can't get Pete Townshend's music from anyone other than Pete himself.scribed himself in song as \\"a faker, a paper clown.\\"<br /><br />Furthermore, it appears that Townshend has trouble stringing together a straightforward narrative.

0812993292|4.0|I planned on not liking this book because of the glut of reviews and praises it inspired. I tend to go against the crowd sometimes! Happily I was very wrong and I too must heap on a few more accolades for this terrific novel. Harold Fry is a caspar milquetoast of a man, living quietly in his retirement with a seemingly unhappy spouse.<br />When Harold receives a goodbye letter from his old friend Queenie from her hospice bed, he dashes off a reply and rushes out to stick it in the corner mailbox. But a chance encounter with a neighbor gets Harold thinking and he decides he must deliver his letter in person and he must start on his pilgrimage now!<br />So we tag along with Harold on his journey and learn about him as he learns about himself.

B003U6BE8I|1.0|To be honest I had very low expectations of this film.  It seems that I didn't learn my lesson with the Hollywood rendition of the Chronicles of Narnia.  This movie was worst.  The only thing they kept were the names of the characters.  The actors they used were all wrong.  For starters Percy was 12 years old, how could he drive a big truck? (something he never did in the book); Hades never appeared in camp Half-Blood; the pearls were given to Percy by a Nereid in Santa Monica, etc.  They should have named the movie something totally different.  The author should have not allow it.  Please Hollywood respect books.

B004ZZFMTK|5.0|There are a very few consumate cook books that define a cuisine in an era, (and usually serve as dependable mines for other books).  Most French cooking of the classic age decends from Escoffier.  Mme de St. Ange (oh what a name!) and Raymond Oliver are worthy successors.  Both tend to assume a kitchen directed by the lady of the house, not a chef (Escoffier is for chefs) but with servants at hand--servants and no Cuisinart, and possibly a wood stove.  In Italy, the pinacle is I Talismano della Felicita (servants) and its excellent heir, Il Cucchaio D'Argento (possibly no servants).<br />Julia Child and friends book created and made possible authentic French cooking for the American in America with no cook or no trained cook.  She derives, ultimately, from Escoffier, but, herself, invented an era of hospitality and taste that is thank God, in spite of our ever deepening barbarism, still largely with us.  She is not quite perfect: her oven times can be a little off, and it is not clear that her oven temperature for baking whole fowls is the best (it works, though).  But she is very, very good.  She had herself carefully taught before she wrote the first word, as an honest person must.  Her book, and the second volume, are among the Himalayan peaks.  It is a classic.  Like egg whites properly beaten.

Since there is no rating on this show, I assumed it was okay for TV viewing, but I was wrong. Please do not watch this with children in the room. My husband and I ended up watching the entire show due to the interesting premise, but by the end, we found we didn't like the main CIA character at all and the sex, nudity and language were enough to deter us from watching anymore in the series.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Bought the charger and cable excellent products the charger is the best of the many Iown for the various units.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It's not the best written book stylistically, which kept me from giving it five stars, but it's one that makes you keep on reading to find out what happens. The ending was one that I never anticipated.  If you love good mysteries and style doesn't matter as much, then it would be five stars.  I bought the new synchronized audible/Kindle so I was less tempted to try to cheat and look at the ending, which really made me want to keep on reading/listening.<br /><br />I love these synchronized books.  You can switch back and forth from reading to listening in the blink of an eye.  I listened when I was in the car or taking a walk, but read my Kindle when I was relaxing or after I was in bed before going to sleep.  I've been waiting for this technology for a long time and highly recommend it.  I'll give the synchronized technology Five Stars.

B007ZGBZHE|4.0|For years, Special Agent Pendergast has been living under false pretenses:  that his beloved wife Helen was dead, killed by lion while on safari.  He now knows different.  He makes it his mission in life to get her back and just when they're about to be reunited, she's snatched away from him once again.  Pendergast sets out to find her but it's not so simple.  A much larger plot is at hand.  A brazen serial killer is slaughtering seemingly random people in hotels in Manhattan.  The enigmatic FBI agent will get sucked into the investigation along with Vinnie D'Agosta.  Pendergast is in a unique position to help out with the case.  He recognizes the murder's methods but nothing is ever as it seems.  Chasing down the killer will lead Pendergast into the remote areas of South America where he'll be confronted with lines even he may not be able to cross.<br /><br />I've been looking forward to this novel's release since turning the final page in Cold Vengeance and, like all Pendergast novels, I found myself taking my time, trying to savor every word for as long as I could.  Two Graves may just be one of Lincoln and Child's most ambitious titles to date.  It's filled with action, charcters old and new, soon to be classic Pendergast moments and dilogue, and is rich with subplots.  Seeing Pendergast come within a hair's breadth of self destruction was fantastic as we're used to seeing him as the unflappable super agent that always has the answers when they're needed.  That's not the case with Two Graves.  This is by far his toughest adventure yet and the authors leave his future in doubt during the course of the book's 480+ pages.  There's tension on every page and as usual, the prose and dialogue are top notch.<br /><br />But, that's not to say the book is perfect.  I was hoping to give the book a higher rating once I'd finished it but I had a few sticking points.<br /><br />One of the sticking points was the subplots.  There are two very robust side stories going on in Two Graves.  One features Constance Greene (always a welcome addition to any Pendergast novel) and the other dealt with Corrie Swanson (also another favorite of mine).  I won't introduce any spoilers, but I'll say that one of these subplots felt like it was tacked on and really had not much of anything to do with the main story.  Not to say it wasn't enjoyable to read, but at times it took me out of the flow of the overal plot of the novel and left me wondering why it was there in the first place.<br /><br />Another of the sticking points was the last 20 or so percent of the book, where the focus transitions from plot and tension to an overly long showdown/action sequence.  This in itself isn't a bad thing, but at times it changes perspective to a secondary charcter who's introduced late in the novel that had a very low level of emotional attachment for me.<br /><br />A final sticking point were some of the villain's more 'unique' attributes.  Preston and Child are no strangers to weaving yarns that intermingle science fiction with science fact, melding them into something unique and riveting but in this case, it felt a bit on the far fetched side.  Difficult to explain without spoilers!<br /><br />All in all though, this is a solid novel that brings a close to the Helen Trilogy and it's a satisfying conclusion in its own right.  It draws an end to the mystery Preston and Child have been building over the previous two books, sheds more light on both Pendergast and some secondary characters, and sets the stage for more stories down the line.<br /><br />While it may not be my favorite of the series or from this writing duo, Two Graves is still enjoyable and is very much worth your time.
0547848412|4.0|In Life of Pi you go on a journey with Pi Patel, a young Indian boy trying to live his life, but when the ship Pi was riding on to start a new home in Canada sinks, Pi is presented with a situation that seems unimaginable.  Pi is alone on a lifeboat with a tiger, a hyena, a zebra, and an orangutan.  This story kept me on the edge of my seat for the majority of the book, and it was a very believable book.  The characters in the story (including the animals) seem very realistic, and it doesn't seem like a fictional story.  Pi sucks me in, and I want him to be able to survive in the lifeboat in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.  There is many science content present in Life of Pi, and it includes survival of the fittest, along with what survival needs are needed for a person to live in these extreme circumstances.  This book intrigued me to learn more about the science that was present in this story.  If I read a part of this book, I want to read more because Pi has such a drive, and you want him to make it through this horrible thing that has happened to him.  I would recommend this book to older teenagers and adults because it wasn't necessarily an easy read, but it was difficult at times, also zoologists and people who are animals lovers would like this story.  I would give this book 4 out of 5 stars because I believe that although it was a very good story it was slow at parts, and Pi tends to go on about religion a lot, (which was a big part of the story)but to me, it felt like it dragged.

B007XNAOS0|2.0|This is my introduction to Baroness.  I've been following along since the Red and Blue days (meaning, I've noticed some of the good reviews), but because I just don't have time or can't buy everything, I never got around to listening to Baroness until now.  Based on previous descriptions, I was expecting, and hoping for, something more like Mastodon.  What I heard was, and I know this sounds like a lazy description, but anything that can be heard on modern rock commercial radio (which I generally dislike - with a few exceptions).  Especially the sound of the vocals.  Really disappointing.  I will not judge Baroness as a whole based on this record alone.  I will try to check out previous releases.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Feels silly to write a review for this book since almost everyone has read it, but I'll add to the positive feedback. This book is well written and entertaining. The story is very different compared to most books these days and I enjoyed the way the story played out. The movie is also entertaining but you definitely have to read the book to get the whole story.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I did not feel it was one of Grisham's best.  There was a bit too much detail in areas of the deception.  However, overall, it was an interesting read, and I liked the outcome.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I found this book highly overrated. The story could have been written in 2 chapters. It lacked substance and was poorly written. Truly for those who are bored! Utter waste of time!
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Clearly this is a means to extend the Bourne product line, and taken in that context it was a reasonable show.  Memorable it will not be, but fun it is.  It was sad to see the aging of the original Bourne cast when pulled in - they should have filmed the actors shortly after the original set in anticipation.  It would have been interesting to have seen at least one short actual scene with Matt Damon - could they have found a cut-out scene from the earlier movies and worked it in.
B0058YPL66|3.0|Case came broken, found it cheaper at the local best buy for $10 bucks cheaper. The product works, distributor must have bought the extra broken cases for cheaper.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|The first books in the Pendergast series were my favorite.  But this one completes the story of what happened to Pendergast's wife while introducing some fresh characters and new dynamics for the series moving forward. I eagerly await the next.
B003O86FMW|2.0|I read this book thinking it would be just as entertaining as the first book, but that it not the case. The story line is somewhat similar in the beginning but then the book takes a whole different turn and it's a completely different story. It feels like the author handed it off to someone else to write once they got done the first part.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I struggled finishing this book. It seemed like the author ran out of storyline (not sex scenes though because though were plentiful).
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|I want worlds away.  I need a regular DVD.  No 3D, no blu ray.  Anyone know where to get it?
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like to keep track of how much I am spending when shopping.  Since I always have my kindle, I don't need pen and paper anymore.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|G.O.A.T. Means Greatest of all time! Nuff said! Perfect finnish to the perfect series! Nolan, Bale, Tom, and Ann make this one of the best trilogy finishes of all time!
B004QX07G4|2.0|I can imagine Ellen Degeneres reciting the comments in the book, so some things are funny.  But it really doesn't say ANYTHING!!
B008NB0SQO|1.0|Only one thing terribly wrong. The love I Found song and scene were left out. Not boring , major part of story line left out. Ignorant Disney Executives, shame , shame.
B005NKGEP2|2.0|While the writing was top notch; the descriptions make you &#34;see&#34; everything the protagonist sees. However, the author seemed to drag the story on and on without any real signs of life until the very end.
B006O6F932|5.0|This is a very cute doll house and extremely easy to put together.  Folds up for easy storage.  The only thing that I did not like was that the furniture was too large to put inside4 when you fold it up to carry it.  Stickers came with it but there were no instructions on where to put them.  Other than those 2 items.  It was very well made and my 6 year old granddaughter loved it.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I bought this used based upon my daughter's opinion of Susan's singing.  I had heard of her, of course, because there was a big deal made about her.  Not because of her extraordinary talent, but because she didn't &#34;look&#34; like a star.  What BS!  Susan Boyle is more talented, I believe, than many singers who look like movie stars.  Give her a listen.  You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />The seller was very quick, and the price was very reasonable for an immaculate CD!
B001EN71CW|5.0|This show was ended just too soon. The Blu-ray version is a visual delight. I had the DVD version before this, and not only do I appreciate the need to change discs less often, I also appreciate the increase in quality. Nathan Fillion really is ruggedly handsome, and it shows on these discs.<br /><br />If you're a browncoat, this is MORE than worth it. If you're not... WATCH FIREFLY... If you don't love it, umm... I'll wonder why. I guess it's cool though. To each their own.
B0051SDM5Q|5.0|Very readable and makes a lot of sense in a fairly short read.  Nice summary included at the end too.
B0027MJU00|5.0|An awesome and exciting book! Many twists and turns. As soon as you think you've figured out the twists and turns, you're hit with a bunch more of them. This is the best book I've read to-date! It will keep you guessing until the end.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|good stuff...i really enjoy this game. remind me of mario brothers. exciting. fun. creative. keeps u busy. love it. i would recommend
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I thought that pillars of the earth was my favorite novel but now I am reconsidering.  Fall of Giants is a fantastic read and I can't wait to start the next book.
B000008LOU|4.0|Great, but not as great as the first one.<br /><br />Although this is called Vol 3, it's actually the second Traveling Wilburys album.  It was supposed to be a joke.  Just like the name is.  A &#34;wilbury&#34; was the name George and his friends called the recording equipment (kind of like a &#34;thingy&#34; or &#34;whachimacallit&#34;.)  They added the &#34;traveling&#34; part to make it sound more exotic, I guess.<br /><br />This is actually an all-star band of George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne, with Jim Keltner as drummer.  Roy Orbison was part of the first album, but passed away before the second was made.<br /><br />The seller of this used CD was very quick and the CD itself was in very good condition.  I'll use that seller again!
B004DM0UII|5.0|Great app. Easy to use. Lots of music genres. Many selections in the blues genre. Nice way to fill idle time.
B00843TZJ2|1.0|The sound of the CSN band I was expecting was no where to be found on this DVD  and the songs that were mostly acoustic originals were done in electric and CSN'S vocals were horrific
B00422LESO|1.0|When I settled down today at work and thought about what I was reading I could not remember the book I was reading and that about says it all for this novel.  I opened my Kindle and there it was ...ah ha...Austenland...then I remembered.  So as I was about 2/3 of the way through the book....you can see what an impression it had on me.  This is dull, silly writing at its worst.  All the characters are flat....no spice or depth....the plot is the same.  Forgetaboutit.....not worth your time nor money.
B008MEM24S|5.0|It's a wonderful game with additional content being made available.  The various substances and ray beams just add to the strategy and excitement.
B000NY12LO|5.0|This story is so timely right now.  It gives one an inside look at the psyche of the shooter, and an understanding of the dire effects of bullying and the lost world of many adolescents.
B00008CLOA|5.0|Bought this SACD &#34;hoping&#34; that it would play on my DVD player, and it did.  The sound quality is awesome!  Unfortunately, it won't play on a standard CD player or my car.  Regardless, this is one fantastic album.  And the seller got it to me in a very timely fashion, considering it was ordered just before Christmas.  Great seller!
0374533571|5.0|Meet Pat. Pat is crazy. Pat has also just been released from the loony bin back into the care of his parents at the age of 34 and is eager to reunite with his estranged wife, Nikki. But he's not completely cured. He still has a number of pills to take and a new therapist to see, but he's back with his family and has begun putting together the missing pieces of his past. Because Pat can't remember the last couple of years nor can he remember why his wife divorced him and got a restraining order out on him. It doesn't matter to Pat, who's going to focus on getting fit - running 10 miles a day, doing hundreds of push-ups and crunches, and hours and hours of weights - because thinking positive will make his wife fall back in love with him and his \\"movie\\" will have a happy ending. But Pat is going to find out why he had a breakdown and why he and his wife will never be together again. His memories are slowly coming back...<br /><br />Matthew Quick has written a brilliant novel and I'm here to tell you, you should read \\"The Silver Linings Playbook\\" because it's a feel-good story about two insane people who can't function in society and there aren't enough books like that. On the one hand you have Pat, a man who goes nuts and starts screaming when he imagines Kenny G appearing in front of him and playing his sax - specifically \\"Songbird\\" - which sends Pat into a blackout rage. And then there's Tiffany, a woman who is as emotionally damaged and crippled by clinical depression, with a tragic past, a bizarre dream and a questionable future. Quick has these two characters, both dealing with serious issues and with some really sad histories, and somehow makes you, the reader, not only like and root for them, but also makes their story one of the most uplifting experiences in modern literature.<br /><br />It's great that Pat and Tiffany are such interesting and likeable characters because this isn't a plot heavy book. Nothing much really happens - we find out about Pat's life slowly through his mother, his father, his brother, his best friend, before moving onto his family's obsession with the football team, the Philadelphia Eagles. If I had known that American football would be such a central part of this book, it would make me think twice as, like most Brits, American football has no interest for me. But instead of focusing on stats and the kind of esoteric details that hardcore sports fans are known for, Quick instead writes about the fans' personalities, the atmosphere of game day, the tailgate parties, the brotherhood of fandom, and it makes someone who doesn't care about the sport, care about it.<br /><br />It's written in the first person with Pat as the narrator who is desperately trying to remain upbeat in the face of a barrage of new information about how the outside world has continued on while he's been away. Quick adds nuance to Pat's voice by giving him a kind of forced happiness, making you aware of how fragile his mind is by his insistence of focusing only on the positive and blocking out the negative as if just the mere mention of anything pessimistic would destroy his childishly simplistic happy worldview. It's an effective approach that shows you he's mentally unbalanced in a beautifully subtle way, and I can understand why some people have likened this narrative voice to Mark Haddon's character Christopher Boone from \\"The Curious Incident...\\".<br /><br />I could talk about this book for hours, I utterly fell in love with Pat's world, as messed up as it is. His parents, hell all of the characters, are fully realised with convincing dialogue and personalities. All of the scenes are well written and there were loads of moments throughout the book that I loved like the dance contest or the essays on classic American novels that Pat's reading to \\"better himself\\". And the small moments Pat has in between the big scenes like with his brother Jake and his distant father watching an Eagles game together for the first time in years or carrying his downtrodden drunk mother to his bed and making her swallow a tylenol and water before letting her doze off. And maybe best of all, the ending with Tiffany in the snow and what she whispers to him. It's kind of like how a romantic comedy ends - but altered for crazy people. And it's perfect.<br /><br />\\"The Silver Linings Playbook\\" is a warm and accessible novel that I can't see anyone picking it up, not loving completely. Yes, parts of it are predictable, I'm not totally blind to certain moments in the plot which I saw coming from a long way away, but the book is so great and the characters so wonderful that I didn't care and just got swept up in the story. Imagine \\"Fever Pitch\\" crossed with \\"Prozac Nation\\" and you've got an idea of the kind of novel this is. Matthew Quick's debut novel is a delight and I'm so taken with it, I'm going to seek out his other two novels immediately. This is a book that can be read in two or three sittings but I made it last as long as I could because this is one of those rare stories that, just dipping into for 30 or so pages, can make the rest of your day that much better. This is just a great novel that I think anyone and everyone will love. P-A-T! PAT!rs or carrying his downtrodden drunk mother to his bed and making her swallow a tylenol and water before letting her doze off.

B008NR91DO|5.0|Terrific DVD sounds great,  would recommend to all Thin Lizzy or Jimi Hendrix fans.  Great song selection he really does good Hendrix covers.
B003TSEEDY|2.0|I kept reading and hoped the book would get better. I am from Pittsburgh so I loved the parts about the tunnel and city view. However, i found the book to be unrealistic for the most part without a strong plot. I finished the book and was definitely disappointed.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY SELF , I LOVE ADELE , SHE HAS A BEAUTIFUL VOICE AND IS A WONDERFUL ARTIST. BUT AS FOR AS MY OPINION HER CD  21 IS FRO AS ONE OF THE BEST
B005LAIIQC|4.0|Love it, well done and I was not disappointed. I give it 4 stars and with 4 stars that means I will buy it.
1250006341|5.0|Great reading and wonderful pictures of the venues and the cast.<br />Great value! even if you are not into Downton Abbey.
0395389496|5.0|Santa brought this to my grandson! He was so excited!  He loves it!  We received the train very quickly and was packaged very good.  We could not be happier with this product and the service getting it!
B006O6F932|1.0|Mattel has nuts charging up to $80 for this flimsy piece of junk. This was one of the major items that my daughter wanted for Christmas, but she hardly plays with it because it falls apart constantly. The dolls can barely sit in the desks or at the cafeteria table without everything flopping over. My daughter and I are both greatly disappointed.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|COIN DOZER IS ALOT OF FUN.<br />MOVING THE COINS TO SCORE SOME PRIZES IS ALOT OF FUN AS AS MORE U DO THE MORE COINS COME DOWN AND MORE PRIZES TO GET.
B004VYYA2K|5.0|Item was even better than expected.  Recipient (age 5) loved it.  Liked it so much bought to more Star Wars zipbins.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|It's worth seeing. I cannot tell you the number of movies one could not say that about. I think you would<br />have to like Clint (which I do) to enjoy it. I give it 3 stars as only okay. I think it's more than that but not quiet<br />4 stars. As with most things it's all subjective.
B005LAIH4K|1.0|1. the Onceler was not named Onceler, it's a title like Hasbeen.<br />2. they didn't need a badder bad guy than the one who killed all the trees,<br />3. the Lorax did NOT have a happy ending, he never comes back, the trees stay dead forever, and the Onceler goes away to die in shame. Changing the ending absolutely ruins the message at the heart of this story... unless...
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This is THE BEST photo app!! It takes a little time to figure out but once you do it is soo much fun!!
1451608659|5.0|Dominique was the child of immigrant parents.  She showed exceptional athletic talent at a very young age.  Even though her family was rather dysfunctional, they provided her with every opportunity to excel.  And excel she did.  Eventually she wound up with coaches who helped her to prepare for the Olympics while adding to the emotional distress she realized at home.  One of those coaches managed to end Dominique's career after she realized several Olympic wins.  Dominique ultimately went on to marry and had children of her own.  One day before the birth of her first child and while struggling to complete final college exams, she received a letter that changed her life.  She discovered she had a younger sister that had been relinquished by her parents.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It is not formatted to look good on the Kindle ( Or any tablet) Because status updates look small to read and you can't save photos well you can't save photos on the kindle :\
B003K16P3M|5.0|I asked around for a good page-turner and came up with this book right away.  I was going on vacation for a few days and wanted something I could really get in to.<br /><br />I couldn't put the book down.  It's been a long time since I stayed up past midnight to keep reading a good book!
B000YHG72E|5.0|it was recommended. I like the story line. I have recommended it to friends and family. great movie to watch
0446554995|4.0|Good exciting page-turner. A plot like an old (but good) B-Movie with a lot of twists and turns. Clever plot (with perhaps a few too many convenient happenings to keep it moving). Aloysius is, as this book series proceeds, becoming a little like a super-hero. Getting hit with a shovel doesn't slow him down. Still, a good series but the best is still \\"Cabinet of Curiousities\\".
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|We had DVR'd this movie and my son really like it.  I purchased the DVD for a Christmas gift.  He can now watch it in his room.  A good family movie with boxing.
B008HTQ28K|4.0|I enjoyed the book as good light holiday reading. The plot was well conceived but I did expect a twist at the end which did not come.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|These books are so different, couldn't put them down! Now to head on to Wool 6 and 7! Definitely recommend!!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|this game is good but everytime i log in, it says it will email the password but never does. if the support was fixed, this game would be 5 star.
B00A3AU1U6|4.0|sometimes i just want some music on in the house when i am working, something to fill the space without needing too much attention.  this is one album i love for those times.  also great music for dinner time or some quiet time.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Very frustrating trying to get on FB on the Kindle.  Always says network error, but when I am on my computer at the same time, there is no error.  I've checked the \\"wireless\\" and it says my network is connected. Long Time Loading the Newsfeed, and doesn't update in real time, always at least a day or two behind. Any Suggestions??
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great yarn with lots of surprises along the way. Enjoyed every minute . Excellent characters that face adversity as they fight to gain freedom .
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|To vauglar, bad language in every senterce. He is puffing marij. all the time. Just a boring movie I'll never watch again.
B00936A0RU|4.0|I loved this movie. I was skeptical at first of the storyline, but it's based on a true story and it definitely was worth watching. I would recommend.
0307950689|5.0|I bought this for both myself and my dad to share, although it was mostly for him. It is supposed to be part of the Robert Langdon series, with The Da Vinci Code, Angels & Demons, and The Lost Symbol as the third book. I like to have a complete set of a series, and I've always enjoyed Dan Brown's books. A great read for me and my dad, and the book came quick in perfect condition.
B009D0LBRO|4.0|I have fun playing this game. It's easy and fun. No learning curve. That's what I want from a game. I have to think all day. Give me something fun to
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Then this book is for you! It even has just a hint of Fifty Shades in there, too. But it takes you places neither of those books does. Definitely give it a read!
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|Producer's clearly wanted money from the fan-base of this series. Not much thought or attempt at making a 'decent' resident evil movie.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my granddaughter and she was ecstatic. So, I am well pleased with the DVD.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Again, I couldn't put this book down. I absolutely loved it. I can not wait to read book number three!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I usually get bored with solitaire but not wihh hhis one. Really like how you have dealing options and the multi_player feature.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|I love the album and Rod Stewart. Buy the Album and you won't be sorry.  It is an awesome album.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very entertaining.....can't go wrong with this series.  Easy to read and fun!  What else can I say?  They are great books!
B005XLN97M|5.0|priced right and mailed quickly. This was a perfect addition to my childs babrbies dream house. This house comes with everything needed to make christmas morning magical
B006LSZECO|4.0|Fun book. A real page turner!! A little disappointed with the end. But still a great read.<br /><br />Definitely suggest it.
B0098XZHSU|5.0|I haven't used this app a lot but when I do it works well and has a huge selection of stations to listen to.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I have young children who downloaded this game on their kindles (with my permission of course, since I am their mother). They are younger than 10, so they do NOT have a facebook or email account. The games keeps requiring them to \\"invite\\" their friends, or \\"purchase\\" more gem stones. My daughter has reached a point in the game where the game itself is DEMANDING that she interact with facebook. If you make a product intend for young children, do NOT allow this as an OPTION! The rule for facebook is 13 or older. Are you wanting them to violate this federal offense? Think about it before making these as a step for your game. I guess you get what you pay for, since this is free, I can't be too upset. Just sad that Hasbro has screwed over the main populace for this game.
B005LAII08|5.0|Great purchase. don't regret a bit.It warked great with our 3D projector. It would rate it as an outstanding quality.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very entertaining.....can't go wrong with this series.  Easy to read and fun!  What else can I say?  They are great books!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. I'm not sure if it takes a certain type of person to understand and appreciate the book but I did and best of all I could relate to it which really meant something to me. It felt nice knowing that not only is there another person who thinks the same crazy weird thoughts as me but that they skillfully wrote it in a wonderful book and there are other people reading this book and thinking the same thing and appreciating those facts too. I'm not sure if everyone secretly thinks the same way Charlie does in this book or if there's just a certain group of people who do, and if there is just a select few, I don't think there's a name for us, or way we can be identified...... but if I had to choose, I would call us \\"infinite\\"
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Roller coaster ride.  Hard to put down. I would put this on top of my virtual shelf. Cutting edge exploration of the warrior or murder gene. Can a person avoid his own DNA?  Is it nature or nature?
0316228532|1.0|I read until the very end, hoping the book would improve. It did not! A very disappointing first adult novel, no real plot but a series of negative events with too many characters. Not a pleasant read at all.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|I bought this for my son for Christmas and we watched it together that night.  Really a fun movie ... I liked it better than the first one even.  Anything with Jude Law and Robert Downey Jr. in it is okay with me!
B005KR6OBM|5.0|The family totally loved the box set for Christmas! They LOVE this show! Do believe they are partial to Sheldon!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love this series.  What else can I say?  The whole series was fantastic.  If you read the first two you have to read this one!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Sin duda esta es una de las mejores trilogías actuales. La resolución es espectacular y el sonido óptimo. Gran historia. Muy recomendable.
B0053KWDES|5.0|I use it with a ATH-M50S and A E10 as DAC and I don´t imagine my life without this device anymore. Great bass and volume boost. Solid feeling with a good package. It comes with rubber bands and anti-scratch rubber to place on the bottom if you use on a desk (my case). If you have a good headphone this is a must. If listening on a computer consider the e10 instead as it is a good quality DAC and amp.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|All I can say is wow, and wow backwards! It seems so hard to find a book that grips you and holds your attention the whole way through. This is that book. The book that you never want to end. Now I understand why this book has so many reviews and just about 5 stars. It deserves every star. I hope Colleen's other books are just as good because I will be reading them next.
B004Y1WCDE|3.0|Plex on my iPhone (and now Galaxy Note) is incredible. Using the Plex server on my computer, I can stream all of my movies on the computer on my phone. The Kindle Fire's lack of RAM makes this almost unusable unless videos are already encoded in .mp4. The Fire simply doesn't have the capability to encode streaming video from an unsupported file format. So, if you're getting this for your high-powered Android phone, or Kindle Fire HD, it should be great. But for the original Kindle Fire? Just meh.
B007FRHZ4A|5.0|Literally screams of joy when the kids opened this item!  They loved playing it, wasnt too complicated, even for the little ones.  Admittedly they were not playing according to the rules, but more for the sheer fun of shooting the catupult at the pigs!  Overall, got on a gold box deal, great value, happy kids.  What more could you ask for.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I finished this book in two days. It was very well written and had a very realistic plot. For those of us that have grown up during a wretched custody battle, this one is for us. The author speaks of grueling times and precious things that must be given up to conquer rough battles. I absolutely recommend this book to all.
B00000IQW5|4.0|With an all-star cast and a really good script, this is one of my top 20 movies. Who doesn't like Holly Hunt, Richard Dreyfuss and John Goodman?
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|glad to find this movie , this movie is so real and so glad that  know days life is better.
B002NF1ZI6|5.0|Bought these because my kid loves to build.<br />She has special needs, and also has adhd symptoms, but building stuff is something she focuses on for long periods of time.  She is good at it, too, the stuff looks like what she has in mind.  Bought her these doors and windows, etc, because she had shown me where the windows are in her creations, and I noticed that she didn't have any - she just left out bricks to make the doors and windows (which is ok, too, that's called making do with what you have)<br />She likes them!  I'm happy too!
B005XLN97M|5.0|Some of these Barbie playhouses take up several square feet of floor space and require hours of setup. This one is perfect! A two-story setup for Barbie and her friends, and my daughter couldn't be happier. She is 7 years old and loves playing with her dolls in this house. Assembly and setup was easy (the only thing I didn't like was LOTS of stickers, but as long as she's happy that's all that matters). No tools required. We bought this for Christmas for my daughter and she says it's her favorite gift. So, if your little girl is wanting/asking for a Barbie house, check this one out. It's very fairly priced and will give your kid hours of fun.
B0032KNA4I|5.0|From what I have heard the movie is great so I bought it I'm sure that Cusack does a bang up job
B0084AZXKK|4.0|The book was a good read and I enjoyed seeing how things were written in this authors words. A great story but written in a language of a dying age. I think younger audiences should read this book but because of the way it is written I believe many will give up and throw it on a shelf.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Really enjoyed S3.  Looking for next season to start up.  Wondering what's going to happen to Darrel<br />and his brother
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I enjoy this game but I'm getting bored of the mini games. Also, I don't want to have to use real money to get half the stuff
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|One of my new favorite books. I'm going to by the audible book when it comes out and reread this book before I buy the 2nd book in the series. Once I picked it up I couldn't put it down. And with such a low price point on an amazing book it is a must buy.
B007TK77QE|2.0|I was initially intruiged by the summary on the back of the book, but found it rather a boring read.  The story line is dragged out and very unexciting.  Would never have finished it if I was able to put an unfinished book down.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|For 8 discs, the packaging is small!  And of course the movies are great! This was perfect gift giving !
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I LOVED this book! It had so many angles and twists and turns, and I found that, while disturbed at some of the<br />historically true instances involving orphanages and treatment of the children, the relationship of the central<br />character and his friends as adults sometimes moved me and at the same time caused me to laugh out loud at<br />their antics....I have recommended this book to several friends. i think I will read it again in a few months.
0062075195|5.0|Perfect read for the beach or lounging by the pool. Quick and easy, read it in two days, can't wait to read the next.
B0055SWM08|1.0|all you do is try to get a stupid ball into a hole don't try it it is really boring and stupid
B006MHWXMS|1.0|How lame can an app be that only syncs 20 items? AND costs this much? The only thing this has going for it over the free apps I've tried is the many widget options...however,if I can't see all my tasks (I put in all my assignments, etc for this term, class by class, and it totally ignores one class...not handy at all), what good is the darned widget? Save your money and wait until Google puts out an app for their tasks...I hope!
B0031R5K72|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I read through the first chaper not entirely convinced, but ended up being one of my favourite books! Definitely worth a read!
1439102430|3.0|I always love forensic thrillers or mysteries--get someone working with bones and you've got me hooked. But the only reasons I'm giving Bones are Forever three stars is that I managed, with some skimming, to finish it and I liked the setting. But I was very disappointed for a couple of reasons.<br /><br />One, I knew the moment a character walked onstage that this was the character whodunit and why. Second, the pages of research results were tedious and read like padding--or laziness or pressure to finish so info dump by the author. And last, the mystery the book begins with is only a throwaway hook.<br /><br />Kathy Reichs perhaps needs to realize this series may have run its course.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is wonderful.  I love it.  How could I not love it!!  It is the Word of God.  It is very easy to go thru without getting confused.  That is great for me.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|feel good movie with Clint at his best<br />predictable outcome but clever twists<br />almost no profanity, and no sex scenes per say
B002MQYOFW|5.0|grabs your attention from the moment you pick it up.lively and fast paced.excellent read.I love the entire trilogy buy it
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I downloaded this app it's so cool  but I have a kindle fire so I don't know how to get songs on it to play on my alarm
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|If you like interesting lyrics, strong melodies, good vocals, and great blending of vocals and band,  This is a group for you,
1451695195|5.0|MUST READ. ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC, GIVES ME CHILLS . IF YOU DIDNT BELIEVE YOU WILL NOW. ALSO GREAT INEXPENSIVE GIFT .
B004LWZWGA|5.0|My son was so happy to get this for Christmas...He has watched it over and over again...It got here way before Christmas, and we have enjoyed it....
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|Boy was this worth every penny. Quite possibly the best Christmas album I've ever heard. Every single song is excellent.
B00AHSGNJM|5.0|When i ordered this, I thought I was ordering the book, not the on demand video. The little bit I did watch of the video, I was pleased w/it. But now I still do not have the book to give to my grandchildren.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|My new favorite writer.  Great story.  Couldn't put it down. I'm sure I'll be reading it again soon. Thanks Colleen!
B007DIQC90|5.0|My daughter likes quirky music.  Once again, she has exposed her parents to interesting international new music.  We love it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It 's very disturbing to me that there are people out there that treat their so called loved ones like that.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|says it's free but if you want more coins you have to pay for them, no thankyou will find a different<br /> game to play.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Though this book has been popular with younger readers, as an adult who reads a lot, I can tell you was enjoyable and fun to read. I wasn't sure I'd like it but now I am eager to start book 2. This may be aimed for young readers but it is written for any one who loves a good story. These characters have depth and Collins gives us a real picture into their thoughts. Her story keeps you wanting more and the details of her dystopia are mesmerizing. This reminded me of Brave New World for a new generation. I encourage the fans of both books to try the other. Congrats to Collins for writing a novel that is so wonderfully similar but also starkly different from past dystopian literature.
1451695195|5.0|I ordered this book for a gift for a friend. I have not given it to him yet, but I did find myself reading it and hard to put it down. I can't wait to present it to my friend.
B009JBZH54|5.0|These are some of the best movies and have already made history. I could watch this trilogy over and over again, amazing package.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Not quite as strong as the album &#34;Sigh No More&#34; but this album is still good listening.  Just happen to like the group's sound.
B003O86FMW|3.0|This book could have been included 1/2 in the first book and the other 1/2 in the third book.  However, if you are a fan of Hunger Games then you MUST read this one between the first and second.  I hope Ms. Collins will continue the series and suspect that she will
B00000253N|5.0|If you only own 2 Bob Dylan albums, make sure this is one of them!  It is an album of amazing depth, even for Dylan! 'Nuff said.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|not bad for two bucks and had alot of laughs.  If you are not a fan of foul language you may want to stay away from this one.  I happen to love it so I thought it added alot to the movie but a friend of mine didnt agree with me on that..;-)
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good app. I have enjoyed very much. Works great on my Kindle and is good to pass time. I recommend it if you enjoy solitare.
B003INBOE2|5.0|If I was to comment, I think this would basically just turn into a movie review because I purchased this movie for the actions scenes.
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|Worst movie ever.  After trying to watch, I realized it was worthless.  I guess I wanted to try to get my monies worth.  I thought for a while, this is got to get better... NOT!  If there was a way to get a refund (even though the rental fee was only $299), I would have done it just for the principal.  The cursing and the &#34;F&#34; bomb were unending.  I think this type of movie is indication of where our society is headed.... in the gutter.  Run away from this movie as fast as you can.  I don't think I'll ever watch another movie with Mark Wahlberg again.  He should have known better.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Fun game that my eight and five year old enjoy. Easy to learn but requires patience.  Great loads of fun!
B00867GHS8|5.0|Finding Nemo is a great movie right?  I'm not going to try to review the whole movie again.  It's a wonderful story based on the innocent explorations of a son (fish) and the devoted father who is determined to bring him home.  Loveable characters - Nemo (Alexander Gould), Marlin - Nemo's father (Albert Brooks), Dory (Ellen DeGeneres and Crush (Andrew Stanton). Now it's available in 3D and HD - wow.
B000RD0RDU|5.0|Nice quiet and powerful fan. I'm impressed with this little thing.  for  40x40x10 this thing is a nice little fan
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Now, firstly I have to confess. I bought this book back on the 21st of Dec. I read the prologue and the first chapter. I dont know what it was but I was crying...not tears quietly rolling down my face but sobbing...hard.I could feel this girls 'numbness'/pain. I knew I had to stop and prepare myself to sit and read this book in one sitting. Today has been that day.<br />The story is beautifully crafted, not written, crafted.<br />As I write this and begin to think about the character development and plot I have begun to quietly cry. I am so affected by this book I can say nothing to you but this........<br />READ IT!
B00004YRQA|5.0|doesnt have much memory stored on it yet but wait till my son gets more ps2 games....he will need more of these lol
B001AG52AG|3.0|I'll start of by saying that I am extremely pleased with some movie adaptations of books I've really enjoyed.  I'll cite Harry Potter and the Lord of the Rings as some.  While there are some variations in Harry Potter I take issue with, for the most part, they are true to the original purpose.<br /><br />Now I'll say I know exactly why The Subtle Knife and The Amber Spyglass were never adapted.  It's the same reason the Narnia series was cancelled after The Dawn Treader - poor casting, poor acting, and a serious deviation from a beloved storyline.  When directors and scriptwriters' heads get too big for them, the movie goes down the tubes.  The reason a book is adapted is because people love it!  Don't change it so much it becomes a story loosely based on a book!<br /><br />This movie skews so far in some ways.  First off, the casting.  Daniel Craig and Nicole Kidman DO NOT fit the descriptions given for Lord Asriel and Mrs. Coulter.  Their looks, their personalities, etc. are just not right.  Then there are a lot of small things that add up to a jumbled tale - the Master is supposed to poison the wine. Fra Pavel was an aleithiometer reader, not the antagonist.  Lyra knows Roger has been taken by the Gobblers before she leaves Jordan college and is already set on rescuing him.  Then, she escapes at a party unnoticed, she never find the golden monkey in her room and darts out the window.  Plus, the Gyptians weren't looking for and over Lyra once she left Jordan, Lyra meets Lord Faa and Farder Coram in the Fens, not on a big ships.  Gyptians travel by longboats in canals and waterways.  And there are lots of people who know things they aren't supposed to know.  It all moves very quickly.  I understand it's a movie and has to move quickly, but you lose so much of the feel of Lyra's Oxford this way.  Plus we miss a very large part of the background of Lyra, her parents, and the part of the Gyptians, which I believe is an important part of the story.  As is her time in the Fens, another interesting area I would have liked to have seen in the film.<br /><br />Then the Gyptians are off to get the Gobblers in no time, and then they show Mrs. Coulter in league with Fra Pavel, and Serafina Pekkala shows up on the deck of the ship instead of her daemon Kaisa, as it should have been.  All wrong.  Lyra doesn't meet Serafina until she's flying with Lee Scoresby.  Nor does she pose such a dumb question for Lyra to ask the aleithiometer.  Also, she should know that Lord Asriel and Mrs. Coulter are her parents at this point, thanks to Ma Costa.  And Billy Costa NEVER experiences intercision, it's a kid named Tony Makarios Lyra and Iorek find in the fish hut in the village.  Lyra's being taken to Svalbard, Iorek's ascension to king, and the progression to Bolvangar take place out of sequence and not as they happened in the book as well.  Lyra should free the daemons at Bolvangar, aided by Kaisa, and when she goes to Lord Asriel, she should be with a contingent of armored bears, not in the balloon.  And we never see the cliff ghasts or really learn anything about the armoured bears.<br /><br />What it boils down to is this: all the elements that Philip Pullman worked so hard to integrate into his story, to make Lyra's world such a rich, full, complex, and unique one are watered down.  We don't get the feel for her world.  And we know it's possible - I cite the Harry Potter series, and the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  They got the mood, complexities, feelings, and characters *just* right.  You can feel you're a part of a vibrant world in those movies.  This feels washed out and watered down, like we're just skimming the surface instead of being immersed in it.<br /><br />Even worse?  The movie ends before the book does.  And that's it.  1 hour and 43 minutes.  Not enough time to get the right story or the true feeling of the book.  Lyra's character has no real depth.  She's just a kid darting from one thing to the next.  Her true mind and drive don't come through clearly in the movie.<br /><br />It's a shame the movie turned out so poorly, as this is one of my favorite trilogies.  Its casting shows a hope for better  things.  Despite their being wrong for the parts, Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig are no small-time actors.  Add to that the voice of Ian McKellan, Sam Elliott, the voice of Freddie Highmore, and Derek Jacobi, and you would think it would be a better movie.  Jim Carter has since made a name for himself in Downton Abbey as well.  All name and no oomph.<br /><br />I'm so disappointed in this movie, and that they were cut off so quickly.  I hope a better screenwriter and director take them up again someday.n't come through clearly in the movie.<br /><br />It's a shame the movie turned out so poorly, as this is one of my favorite trilogies.

B0031RS4UM|4.0|Really good story, the more I read, the more I wanted to read. I want to read his books in chronological order and have his second book on my iPad. We saw the film and noted Lee Child's cameo appearance as the station sergeant,
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great book! Had me hooked from page one. I've read other books on bipolar and loved the way this author helps us see the different perspectives of the characters.  It's a must read!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Love the story, which is only enhanced by the ensemble cast.  Would recommend this to anyone.  One of those films that can be watched again and again.
0810989956|5.0|We bought this book for our 7 yr old who has been reading all of the DWK books after her 13 yr old brother finishes them. She loves that she can write in it and draw her own pictures in it.
B003GEDLW6|5.0|I highly recommend this cd.  It is one of my favorites, especially considering I didn't even know who they were when I ordered the cd.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|This was a gift and he LOVED it but who doesn't love Led Zeppelin they are THE GREATEST Rock and Roll Band ever
B002DKGWSE|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my son.  but if someone is into movies like this, I would recommend it.
B000ID37SQ|5.0|I was looking all over for this movie and very surprised that I could not find it anywhere.  Was great to find it on Amazon and stream it and have movie night immediately!
B00000JMOF|4.0|For being a rather old film, I enjoyed watching it. It wasn't like the book, but that was fine with me. It wasn't very scary, but it was still enjoyable.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I have read almost everything these two write and have never been disappointed.  I just wish they would write the Penergast novels faster!
B005FLX1HS|5.0|I have owned this cd for about a year now and still listen to it on almost a daily basis.  If for some reason I have to buy this cd again I will.  Its still one of my favorites.
1401224792|4.0|First a warning - this is a violent, gore fest more often then not.  Bigby isn't a subtle man to begin with and these folks pissed him off something bad and he let's loose on them.  Also there is a lot of nudity running around these pages.  Male and female.  I wouldn't call it explicit persay--girls are obviously girls, guys are obviously guys, but its pretty clinical overall.<br /><br />FABLES remains one of my favorite comics and barring something slipshod editor deciding to butcher it, that's not likely to change.  I've looked forward to this book for a long time mainly because Bigby is my favorite character, bar none (save Snow White and Cinderella), and it promised to give us a bit of back story on the man behind the wolf.  In that it didn't disappoint.  Bigby has spoken of his time in WWII, when he helped out the Allies (unofficially) to stop the encroachment of the Nazis, but in this he reveals just what he did exactly.<br /><br />The art isn't anything to write home about, its not up to the usual standards of the comic and part of that may be because most of the story arcs had one artistic team (inkers, layout, pencils) throughout.  WEREWOLVES has numerous inkers and in a comic book that can really fudge up the artwork.  From a reader's perspective, it made folk hard to tell apart (I kept mixing up Diana and Oda, or Alwin and Carl for instance, which in turn confused me as all four had separate agendas more or less).  The werewolves, whether intentionally or not, were all colored basically the same so even though Bigby was going through them wholesale at one point, I had no idea who was dead and who was not.<br /><br />Story wise this was an interesting conundrum for Bigby.  He kind of helped create the mess and was at a loss as to how to finish it.  Technically no one in that town is a true Fabletown resident.  None of them came from the Homelands, or were born from parents who fled the Homelands (such as Snow and Bigby's children), and thus the charter didn't cover them.  On the other hand they weren't exactly Mundys (humans).  He basically let it play out, hoping for a graceful outcome, but knowing the outcome would be far worse then anything he wanted to find.<br /><br />A word to Oda, she tried to seduce Bigby (for what reason is never quite explained, we really only have Bigby's own guess) and he turned her down flat.  If she goes prancing off to Fabletown and mentions such a thing to anyone (even in jest), Snow will find out and Snow will put a silver bullet in her chest before Bigby can so much as blink.  And I will pay good money to see that.n't cover them.  On the other hand they weren't exactly Mundys (humans).

B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I purchased one for the first Kindle last year and it has protected it & even though it has had a lot of use, it still looks great & has kept the device protected & looking new. I recommend this item as it looks & wears better than the more expensive covers.  A small price to pay for so much protection.
B00009L1UP|5.0|My step-son bought this for his father for his Birthday.  My husband loves listening to Queensryche it takes him back to his high school years
B002SVBDYQ|5.0|Loved this soundtrack. Easy to convert to iTunes as well. Price was worth it and I am glad I got the whole album
B001AGXEAG|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies from when i was growing up and i bought it for my kids to be able to watch.
B000OVLBEY|4.0|Entertaining movie.  Peter Fonda cast well! Love Sam Elliot.  This one MUCH MUCH better than the second.  Second one was horrible
B0009P5YXO|1.0|I had hoped that for $30+ this item would be anything but cheap. It is an extruded plastic toy. The pen tips are approximately 3 cm long. You cannot utilize the toy for writing even as a novelty. Any pressure applied while writing makes the pen tip fall out. The cover piece of plastic falls off when actuating the slide. The toy does make the &#34;sonic screwdriver&#34; sound. The light is a near UV led.<br />I need to say here that I did not expect a prop replica here but a partly metallic item for this money is not unrealistic.
B005DN7W4G|4.0|Enjoyed the movie & as always, rec'd excellent shipping from Amazon. The prime membership is well worth the annual fee.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book had so many twists and turns.  The reader knows something is coming but could never predict all of the events or how the characters are intertwined.  Kudos to Colleen Hoover! I loved Slammed but Hopeless absolutely surpassed it!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Book is well written just sorry it ended without Amy not going to jail...there is just too many unansward question...what happens to go, and the bar???
B003IKMR0U|4.0|Super easy to learn and can play with any range of number of people.<br />Great for camping to pass the time.<br />Fun yelling &#34;Brains!!&#34; every time you roll 'em
B00A9X9VAI|5.0|Another futuristic movie. Why are they all so dark? At least there were no zombies. Anyway, the plot was good. Entertaining. Has a good surprise ending.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Really enjoyed graphics and puzzles in the game. I would like a sequel to this game.  G5 games are becoming one of my favorite games to play.
0525952926|5.0|Have read most of his previous book and enjoyed this one as well. Historically accurate with fictional embellishments. Hard to put down.
B008OOYALE|3.0|I like this game, it's pretty good. There are a lot of cool and cute dragons to collect. Definitely a good game for anyone who likes dragons or just wants something to play to kill some time. I would have given it another star, but an unfortunate feature of this game is that everything(from food to habitats and Dragon evolution) is too darn expensive, and takes too long. By the time I have a decent amount of money, I have to spend it on food or habitats that cost too much. Then I might have to wait 9 or 16 hours for my Dragon to evolve or hatch. It's a bit silly to me, but it might not bother more patient people.
B006O5Y75Y|4.0|I really liked this movie.  It was a lot better than Planet of the Apes.  You will really like this movie.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|It's not the type of Stephen King you might expect but the book is excellent. Lots of places to explore and great characters.<br />Especially loved the appearance of other King characters as a gift to his Constant Readers.<br /><br />A great read for anyone, regardless if you enjoy King's past books or if you are interested in JFK.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Was probably one of my least favorite Demille books, but the jibes were funny .  Had trouble keeping up with all the characters!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Great, my friends had enjoyed the series on TV but I had misse it. I ordered it, it came fast and I can hardly quit watching it. Good find for a good price.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|I always enjoy Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep in everything they do.  Acting and story content really good.  Enjoy if you are over 50!
B009E9QOEO|5.0|An outstanding recording of their 2007 O2 Arena concert.  I would highly recommned this CD for an Led Zepplin fan. Rock on!
B000002VCQ|4.0|Great Cd of the great Whitney Houston.  You will love this cd.  Anyone who like the great Whitney Houston should buy this cd.
B001KDQ4KQ|2.0|I'm a fan of Jodi Picoult but I found this to be the weakest of her novels.Perhaps she intended to leave us with many unanswered questions, but I found it to be a very unsatisfying read. Her characters and their motivations were not well developed. I didn't really understand any of them.
B009MO57H6|5.0|most series start off good and end bad this is the opposite it started off slow but once the 4th movies hit i was 100% hooked can't wait for the next one.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I love this game and the ones that they make. I love this one like the others too. just wait.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Very boring.  Not that funny at all and the language was totally unnecessary - got old.  Would not recommend this at all.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Typically Jane Austen, this is a quick book to read and leave smiling. A great little romance to take on vacation.
B00004ST9Q|5.0|Great selection of Whitney's hit videos.  She will always be the best singer ever, never a voice like this again.  This is a great collection if love the great Whitney Houston.  I highly recommend buying the hits dvd.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|Mark Whalburg can do better than this.  The dialogue was awful and the jokes were poor stand-up material.  Maybe two good belly laughs.  The rest was crap.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is the best one<br />That was made I hope their will be more diary of a wimpy kid<br />Books
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Finally found out what all the fuss was about, could not put it down, loved every second of it! Made for mature readers ONLY! Such amazing adjectives to describe every aspect of their love and life. Can not wait to read  book number  2.
B007SSEBCU|4.0|Again, always watch everything that Meryl Streep is in.  She did an excellent job in her portrayal of her character.  Would definitely recommend it - especially if you are a Streep fan.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|This is so much fun to play.  Love the applause at the end.  Getting better and better with each time.
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|Really opens up what the system is capable of. Really easy to use interface and great compatability. Highly recommend to anyone running android.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I don't generally like Stephen King's genre however this book is terrific. I highly recommend this for anyone who likes history, psychology or simply wants to know if the past is changed does that change the course of life.
1478343516|1.0|This volume has a nice over, but each story is in tiny print with no paragraphs.  It is the worst typography I have ever seen. The book arrived with no packing slip. I thus have no idea how I can return it for a refund. Apparently, the stories are in the public domain and whoever published this thing wants to make some money without bothering about readability.
B00846REIS|5.0|Great book . Kept you. Wanting more. Couldn't put it down and was a great story line... Loved it and can't wait to see what happens next...
0763644765|5.0|There's not much to the book (reading wise), but my 20 month old loves it.  We've had it for a month and yesterday he wanted to sit on the potty with no diaper :)
B000J103OI|5.0|So excited I can wait for to come I love this movie one of my fave I will be adding to my chick flick collection
B007CKHPD6|2.0|Disclaimer: my copy is region B and not purchased through Amazon, but rather through an Australian retail outlet.  That said, I am staggered at the asking price for this sub-par Blu-ray on this website and I must agree with the other two reviewers. The 5.1 mix is very disappointing, I think I got more out of it by using the ProLogic ll setting on my Pioneer receiver. I can't even access the \\"restored mono mix\\", the disk case actually says that it is NOT included, despite the included 2012 trailer stating that it IS on the disk. What a selling point - here's what your disk DOESN'T have on it!! On the doco Steve Howe says that the mix on the film was done brilliantly but this sounds like it was played back in an aircraft hangar and re-recorded by a bootlegger.  As for the video, the trailer shows the film to be in 16:9 but clearly that's not how it plays back. I suspect it is just cropped anyway so we probably aren't missing anything, but to the manufacturers, don't mislead people, please. I can't comment on accessible video resolution as I don't have a HD television. The film restoration wasn't too bad, I know that there wasn't much lighting to work with and this is probably as good as it gets.<br /><br />In conclusion, fair enough that you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear but as consumers we deserve to be given more honest information about what we are buying. Marginally better video than the original, and a botched surround mix is hardly anything to get excited about in a marketing campaign, and Howe, Squires and Dean wasted their time making the doco.  Another annoyed fan.

B005ZTFPFQ|4.0|I love this game centerpide so much it's so much fun playing it on my kindle fire... i don't like game with other people i rather play at my own pase... i'm really really enjoying the old time games...
B008KYOCA2|1.0|I tried to type in something for a special event and all it did was go to January 1st and it didn't let me put it anywhere else. So it is WAY below a 1Star rating and I hated it. It wasn't helpful at all, and I don't  recommend anyone getting this app. It is a wast of time and no wonder why it's free!!!
B009PK9SB8|4.0|Looks great, the touch screen could be a little more responsive but I guess it's because of the small size.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|Me & my husband have always been big Bourne fans, so are expectations were high when this movie came out. It's not bad, but definately not the best. It's story seems kind of simple. We were dissapointed in the amount of action. We were expecting a lot more action since this guy was suppose to be so much &#34;tougher&#34; or so much more highly trained, etc, but it really didn't. It's still an enjoyable movie, just probably our least favorite Bourne movie.
1401207529|5.0|Gritty, intelligent, well written, and extremely accurate.  Frank Miller embodies the evil, madness, and pain which is in Bruce Wayne.  This graphic novel embodies the inner struggles of Bruce Wayne who is still figuring out who, or what, Batman is, what he's capable of, what his purpose is, and how far he's willing to push himself to bring his city where it beings.  The vulnerability is  the main enemy here, and pushing the envelope is the true struggle.  A must read for any true or new fan the the dark knight and how his rise to the top is as true a struggle  as any villains he acquires over a lifetime of conflict...
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|great game_nuf said.  loved the storyline. creepy music. mystery made me want to keep playing. no matter what time it was
B007M45PMU|5.0|I had heard their song &#34;ho hey&#34; on the radio a lot and liked it but didn't intend to buy the album until I sampled it here on Amazon. I really thought they would have a different sound but I love them. They are going to blow up this summer!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the fourth time I read this book and soon as I finished this awesome book it felt like the world started spinning again. This book is breathtaking! Great job Susanna!!!
B00992CF6W|4.0|First of all. Great game! Its lots of fun and is similer to the main version.<br />However, if you are going to buy this expecting the exact same thing as on you Pc or xbox, think again.<br />There are some who are saying that redstone isn't on this version. That is not true. However, there is no way to mine it. You can clear it out of the way, but there is no way to phisically make is usable. Also, I had to go 60 blocks down to find it.<br />Iron doors, pistons, minecarts, boats, and many other items are not aviable in this version.<br />Crafting is different, you do not need to physically place the materials in the right place to make them.<br />Smaller variety of monsters. (there is still creepers, spiders, zombies, and skeletons)<br />No lava as far as ive seen. Unless you type \\"nether\\" into the world generator seed.<br />If you use the same generator seed for two different maps, you will get the same exact map.<br />There is currently no way to change the name of the world, so choose wisely!<br />If you are on a kindle, make sure to turn the wi fi off if you are not playing multiplayer,it will drain you battery quicker if you are not plugged in.<br />The the worlds are also 64x64x64 instead of being unlimited.<br /><br />[Review created on Jan. 6 2013.]
B008I34ZFW|5.0|Bearing in mind that this film was not meant to be taken seriously and that it was made by an independent company, it is a blast to watch. It combines some of the more ridiculous conspiracy theories about Nazi UFO research with political satire and is guaranteed to make most people laugh.
B009LRE040|2.0|Batman begins was the best film in this trilogy.  Sorry Chris Nolan, this was your worst film so far.  The bad photo on the cover depicts the movie exactly. Poorly staged. Unimaginative. Dreary.<br /><br />I hope the next person to take over the Batman character does a better job at depicting this hero.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is by far the best read for me of the first hand accounts I have read. Goods into deal tail without giving away this this government doesn't want. Read this in two nights as I couldn't seem to stop reading.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|This is not the show, it's just a 10 minute preview of the series with some behind the scenes stuff. That said, it's free, and for fans of the show, a delight to watch.

B0052RDHTM|5.0|I have never read a book by Follett that I did not enjoy for characters, plots, composition and writing style.  I thought this was one of his best, followed by the second of the trilogy and will be looking forward to the third.
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|This is one of Lee Child's best book.I had a hard time putting it down.Read it in one day. I LIKE GOING BACK TO HIS ARMY DAYS.I hope he will go bake more. I don't think Tom Cruse is a good Reacher. He isn't big enough at all. Wish they had picked a better person to play the part.  TReacher is 6 foot 5\\" 250lbs. That is not Cruise
B008L1DNGI|3.0|ChuChu Rocket is a good puzzle game with some genuinely challenging levels. I've had to skip a few that I couldn't figure out very quickly. The game does seem to fall flat visually, though. I found the graphics boring before I finished the normal difficulty puzzles.
034580404X|5.0|I heard about the trilogy of &#34;Fifty Shades of Grey&#34;, from several people.  I thought this was a book to teach that everything doesnot have to be black r white.  That life is actually many shades of gray.  Boy, was I in for a surprise!  I could not put the first book down.  The author had my attention from the first page of the first book through the last page of the trilogy.  Yes, there is a lot of sex in these books, but I found Ms. James writing to be so muchmore than that.  Life and what life has given each of us, both good and bad , she brought out beautifully.  One moment I was smiling about something that happened and soon I was crying tears of sorrow for what another had to endure.  These books were beautiful, and beautifully written.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I think I have thought about this book and the results for days now after I finished reading it.<br /><br />The characters were definitely a different set of character's that each and every one was hard to identify with in one way or another.<br /><br />The storyline had a very complex level to it that just kept you wondering why in the world the story was going in that direction or what the characters were thinking.<br /><br />I normally don't include any type of spoilers in my reviews, but with this book, it is almost impossible.<br /><br />This book brought out an array of different emotions, from confusion, anger, disbelief, and the list keeps going. It is not a book that you can just put down and easily forget.<br /><br />This will go down as a favorite of mine, even though weeks later, I am still shaking my head about the story.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|It was cute, heart warming and pretty funny. A movie you can watch with your children or by yourself year around.
B00633W614|4.0|Both of the Archer books, &#34;Sins of the Fathers&#34; and &#34;Only Time Will Tell&#34; were really good reads, lots of twists and turns, really held my interest.  Looking forward to the next book (Due in May, I think) and have already signed up for it.  Unlike some trilogies, I think this one will hold my interest until the end.  Lots of different characters, romance, adventure--what more can you want?
B000002AGN|5.0|Time Out is a Brubeck classic.  I own the original LP, a cassette and now the CD.  I'm sure every jazz lover has this recording. Love it, love it, love it.

B0063IH60K|5.0|Graphics are good and it is easy to play. I found it to be just as challenging as a real game and an enjoyable experience.

B009JBZH54|5.0|Great Movies great price. i highly recommend to everyone. i already have watched multiple times. great great great great great.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The book starts out as just another good romance book but the author adds such an unexpected twist that I found I couldn't stop reading till the end. Originally I bought and read this book because so many other people did and now I know why.

B002PEP4SC|5.0|I hope this is not the last novel in this series. I did read the other series of Storm Myseries but did not consider them as well written as this series.
B003O86FMW|4.0|On to the third book. Good series. Can not wait to read the next book to see how this Wii end.
B003KRGCTI|5.0|This is a great movie. I loved it. The story line, directing and acting is some of the best. Well worth it.
B0086700CM|4.0|This is an enjoyable game- it is fast moving and the graphics are nice. Great free app and fun alternative to the normal ones I play with on occasion when I have a few minutes. My son  also has it and loves it.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Nice gently sounds, you can customize by layering, you can also adjust the volume of each one. Also a timer so you can set it to shut off after you're asleep. Perfect.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really liked this game.I thought the graphics were great and the story line was fun.<br /><br />I really liked this game.I thought the graphics were great and the story line was fun.can't wait to get another game.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Found the story line to be disappointing.  Maybe I am just too much of a romantic, wanting things to turn out better in the end.
B0080K3G4O|2.0|I enjoyed the author's humorous writing style, but his anglicized interpretations of Buddhism & Stoicism are boring and steeped in pompous false assumptions. Despite its name, this is really just another run of the mill self help book. You would be better off reading actual Rational Emotive Therapy books by Albert Ellis or Dialectical Behavioral Therapy Books by Marsha Linehan than wasting your time with this cutesy fluff piece.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|In the past I wasn't a big fan of the Harlequin novels. I always thought they were a bit cheesy but I really got into this one from the beginning. Looking forward to more from this author!
B005LAIIKI|3.0|The thing that defines Quentin Tarantino is his unique way of structuring movies.  The best thing is figuring out how it all fits together.  This is the element that defines, and makes Pulp Fiction the best film f the 90s and in the top 20 all time.  The absolute brilliance of writing seemingly unrelated mini stories but find ingenious ways for them all to converge with each other is brilliant.  I never want to see a linear Tarantino movie so I hope he doesn't do it again.
B008UUPOVM|5.0|This is a really well done album, has great lyrics and music, and is more &#34;pop&#34; modern in my opinion, love to listen to it!
B007TNS6JI|4.0|This is a great game!  The graphics are good and the game play leaves nothing to be desired .I'm still on the first world and already think I am going to have a difficult time putting.this game down
B00APUYWYA|1.0|I would recommend avoiding this film. The main character lacks any depth or acting abilities. The only funny character is played by a girl named &#34;Fat Amy.&#34; Her one-liners make this film tolerable. Overall though, the movie is a huge disappointment especially considering Brittany Snow stars in a minor role in the film. The music is pretty amazing, I'll give it that but due to the lack of plot development and awkward transitions both in the script writing and cinematography, I cannot rate it more than 1 star. Seriously, save yourself the time and just watch an episode of Glee. Oh and perhaps the worst part includes a chronic barf scene where one of the main characters upchucks &#34;on purpose&#34; to prove a point and then another girl makes a barf-angel in it. You've been warned...
B00AIQP9DE|2.0|Can't rate cause I was under the impression, I was downloading full game on kindle fire HE, however it is  only good for a while then they want you to purchase it...well I can buy it for &cent;.99  at the store...the story line was getting good and then it shut down and ask that if you want to continue you have to purchase it.....NO THANKS!!!!
B002EEP3NO|5.0|I know its supposed to be for 12 years and up, but my child had no problem with assembly. Its definitely a collectors piece.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This trilogy is amazing, easily as good as the Lord of The Rings movies.<br /><br />A fitting meditation on good vs. evil for our troubled, post 9-11 world.
B001RXB4FY|5.0|Awesome band, can not wait to see them live! Do your self a favour and pick up the rest of their catalouge!

1451627297|4.0|The houses, villages, towns and coasts of the Northeast United States must be one of the most, enchanted (or haunted) regions on Earth.  In recent years there have been several books published, whose action was located in this area, that deal with the ethereal, delusional or otherwise \\"other worldly.\\"  While this book is not a ghost story, a tale of confused reality or even a tale requiring much disbelief, it is a tale of being haunted by a past unknown but hugely influential upon the present.<br />Lucy Jarrett is a nomad, having left the hamlet of The Lake of Dreams, New York, closely upon graduating high school to attend college then travel the world as a hydrologist.  She senses that this roaming is more about staying away from her past than it is about the work she does.  When she is called home to help her mother recover from a minor accident, she soon finds the world she had always known to be drastically changing.  She finds some pamphlets, dated from the early 1900's, and a note, signed Rose, in a bench seat in the cupola of her familial home and  begins a quest to learn from where they came and why she feels they are of such import.  She spends the next two weeks discovering a past hidden from her and the family for the last 100 years but one that has had a huge influence on that family during that period.  In the course of this uncovering, she comes to understand the dynamic of interconnectedness in an entirely new light.  All things, particularly in matters of family, are connected - if there is a shift in one spot, a shutter is felt by all.  It was such a shutter that began her desire to leave, now a like shutter is bringing her back.<br /><br />There is nothing in this book of an offensive nature.  There are glaring editorial mistakes (naming the Summer Solstice \\"the longest night of the year\\" (p. 115), having her sister-in-law own a vegetarian restaurant that serves Turkey sandwiches, to name two) while also containing moments of powerful images (Rose,speaking of the Divine, \\". . . I had sensed something beyond the familiar in this place, something silent and just out of sight but present, welling up.\\" p.216).  The mistakes do not keep this story from being a good read as Ms. Edwards researched well the under-story of Women Suffragettes, the struggle for equality and the sacrifices required for her (and all) to have the life she enjoys.  She uses this knowledge as a plank in the construction of a literary structure.<br />The role of a church building plays a central part in this tale.  What is found in this chapel, closed and off limits for 50 years, colors Rose in detail that gives Lucy reason to deeply connect with her.  Rose's being touched with \\"something beyond the familiar\\" flows to Lucy, bringing healing to the injury she suffered which led to her self-imposed exile of roaming the earth.  It seemed that once she was uncovered, Rose released a Grace that would not release Lucy until she knew who she (Lucy) was and she had the blessing of Freedom.  Then she could travel because she wanted to, not because she had to stay away from \\"home.\\"
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Although it wove several families together, it was easy to keep them apart. It was a little too long at over 500 pages.
1451695195|4.0|Dr Alexander's extensive  medical explanations are an interesting 'without a doubt' platform to launch his description of after life as he experienced it. His verbal illustrations of what he explains are impossible to describe events is suficient to allow a reader, as their minds will allow, to approach entering into a majorly unknown experience. The trip back and through Dr Alexander's recovery and return to himself and his life allows us to rejoin him as he is now. His post experience details facinate on many levels give us thoughts to chew on for a good long time. I found myself asking but how exactly does it relate to every day experience for us more that mortal folks that have not had such experiences. Even if we believe his experience  how do we translate  this into  guiding principles. Yes I would liked to have had a step down road map not a tell me what to do prescription so much as religions already do . I recall the only practical suggestion was to meditate with some references to methods that might bring us a similar experience and those lead to purchases that could be a little pricey for some and left me with an untasty comercial twang. Absent the recomended CD's I seem to be left mentally in Heaven and otherwise here on earth with little substanative means to intergrate. On further reflection Dr. Anderson really can only share his experience as it was and he did not arrive at his experience through any plan of action initiated by him per se so to me the mystery in translation remains intact. Mostly all is as it was so Heaven and God exist but I'll have to stumble around searching and/or wait till I get there.
B00574PQDU|2.0|The whole story line of who should exercise free will, and &#34;The Man Upstairs&#34;, or Chairman, as he is called in the movie, just did not strike a cord with me. Liked both Matt Damon and Ms Blunt in other movie roles much better.
B004RL9T50|3.0|This was just an okay movie.  I've watched funnier ones.  I didn't hate it, but it didn't really draw me in.  Don't think I'd rent it again.
B0076DELIG|2.0|NO  TOO LONG -- NO ACTION  Not one of his best  VERY DISAPPOINTED OK  No Character development and anothher case of merely churning another book out and hope it goes to the best selling list which it did  ,however if this is what this guy puts out in the future he will be a has been !!<br />THE BLACK BOX
B000FC10MU|4.0|This book was suggested by my son, who thought it would be one I would find to be of great interest both for its literary attributes and for its content.  He was correct on both counts.  It is a book of mythology, religion, human relationships and the classic struggle of good against evil.  Not a quick read, it is one that will hold the attention of any reader who has a familiarity with, or interest in, world religions or the mythologies of the world.<br /> Shadow, a man whose given name has lost its usefulness and this one fits his present state, is being released from prison after serving three years an unnamed crimes.  He is getting out a few days early after his wife is killed in an automobile incident.  On the plane ride home, he is seated next to man who seems to know more about Shadow than is possible, having just met.  When Shadow flees the plane at the first opportunity, he is offered a job by this stranger, known as \\"Mr. Wednesday, when he suddenly appears at the diner 300 miles from the airport where Shadow is eating.  Thus begins an odyssey for Shadow that could change the world, possibly history and hinges upon the power of belief.<br /> As unusual as is Mr. Wednesday, he is far from the most interesting person (or character) met during the trek upon which Shadow finds himself.  Part of Shadow's job is driving Mr. Wednesday around the United States as he meets with various gods in hopes of recruiting them for an army against the \\"new gods.\\"  The \\"old\\" gods were those brought to America in the minds of the immigrants when they left their homelands and landed here; the \\"new\\" gods are those worshipped today - media, technology, cars, beauty, commerce, etc.  The confrontation brewing is the winner-take-all, loser-leave-town (or die) fight for the ages.<br /> The story should be offensive to all who view themselves a Monotheist, as it requires the reader to confront the reality of how far from Monotheism everyone actually is.  Each of the gods, old and new, survives in direct measure to the belief shown in them.  Mr. Gaiman has a firm grasp, and is able to speak of it clearly, of the power of belief.  \\"People imagine, and people believe: and it is that belief, that rock-solid belief, that makes things happen\\" (p. 536).  All that Shadow experiences in the four months he spends with \\"the gods\\" only reveals his life to be no different from theirs.  They have lived upon belief of others and their longevity has granted them the \\"power\\" of knowledge, but no safety from the possibilities of tomorrow.  We, like the gods met in this lengthy novel, live by the belief we have in ourselves and that shown in us by others.  I find myself spending far too much time kneeling at the Alter of those gods (Facebook, computer, cultural whims, etc.) that grow strong upon the belief I show them.<br /> This is a book for mature readers.  There is much bloodshed and some graphic sex, not to mention the plethora of mythological pantheons from Norse, to Greek, to Asian, to Native American (and many whose origins have been lost in the mists of history) that would test the knowledge of any comparative religion professor.  It is a book that will confront anyone who professes fidelity to any Faith System by raising the possibility that we are far less faithful to God than we would like to think.  Mr. Gaiman reveals this reality by reminding the reader that worship can be measured by where we spend our time, energy and resources.survives in direct measure to the belief shown in them.

B00AFEXRME|5.0|What a nice surprise Flight was. I had no idea it was about Denzel playing an alcoholic. The movie starts with a dramatic plane sequence then turns to the aftermath of the situation with Denzel's character and his actions that day. The director (Robert Z.) crafts a beautiful story here, every scene seemed to grow more intense as the movie played out, ending with a very emotional end. This isn't an action flick like those stated above so be prepared for an emotional and  dramatic tale. Don Cheadle delivered a great performance also as well as the supporting cast. I must say I was on the edge of my seat in the last few minutes, unsure how it would play out. Superb movie all around.
B0068853O6|4.0|I like the show, and it is very high quality writing and acting. However, it is not nearly as interesting as shows like Band of Brothers or The Pacific.<br /><br />Maybe it's just the subject matter that is less interesting. Still, very solid series.
B0074YVW1G|5.0|A fascinating insight into Me and the extroverts in my life. It was easy to read but also backed by references and research. I have recommended this book to my friends
B009SQQRH2|5.0|Great for the holiday season. Had some great humor and good plot. The animation was as good as the competition and well done.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book. Did not disappoint. It had me hooked from the first page and left me wanting to delve headfirst into the next book.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This no longer needs reviews. Rovio received 8 million DL on Christmas day and 30 million DL over the Christmas week. There is absolutely nothing new I can say about Irritated Avians.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Lots of fun, downloaded to my kindle plus 2 kids. Sort of a competition. We all love it. Game is fun, and it is free. No being bothered to purchase coins or other items. Kids and adults will enjoy this one, plus it is easy to learn to play.
B00008PX8P|2.0|If you are a die-hard zep fan, this is for you. It's fine if you are expecting a documentary. As a casual fan, I was hoping for 1 great performance captured by competent film makers, such as the Pink Floyd dvd Pulse.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Reading this book, I felt like I was Sky. I felt all her emotions and that made the book so much more real. You'll fall in love with all the characters and Sky's story will stick with you forever.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is now my favorite book in the world. It is a moving story about a teenage boy. I strongly recommend this book for any teenager. We all go through things in life, and this book shows many different problems one might come to face. The book just makes you see the world from a whole new perspective. It lets the reader appreciate the small things in life.  Highly recommended for teenagers.  Great book, and anyone could enjoy reading.  It truly is a moving story.<br />.
0385737955|5.0|I enjoyed the Hunger Games books and checked this book out due to a recommendation. It is the same kind of story although not at all similar to Hunger Games. I started the book and had trouble getting past the first couple of chapters due to the confusion of what was being said. The book throws you into the confusion of the main character with no explanation of what's going on in the beginning. I gave up on the book and listened to it on Audible and finally got past the first few chapters to find out that it is a fantastic book. The reader on the audible version is very good. I look forward to reading the rest of the series.
B003FNWR6Y|5.0|I was very happy with my order. The Monopoly game I ordered was a Christmas present for my son. I ordered it in plenty of time for Christmas, BUT failed to change my shipping address. It went to my old address. Amazon was VERY good to credit my account, let me ordered another in its place and then had it shipped next day!  I was very pleased. I did get a notice that the person receiving the first game returned it. I was happy about that too.<br />I am very pleased with Amazon and will be a returning customer.<br />Thank you.<br />Debbie

B001P06GX4|5.0|Maybe these people that are saying they got a fake are buying from different sellers? We bought ours with our Prime subscription and it arrived fast (as always) and it's the real deal.  We have the other version of the game and i must say, this one will take some time to get used to- its very different, but in a good way.
B005ERIRZE|5.0|It's great read for all interested in neuropsychology and people who try to understand why they behave like they behave. To get most of this book you should have high level of self-awareness and switch to observer mode. The worst thing after reading this book is that it requires a lot of willpower to act as Kelly suggests in the book :)

B0054JZC6E|4.0|I find this particular conglomeration to be both challenging, fun, and annoying at the same time. But these are games the kids can enjoy and don't need much supervision to play. good job.
B000089A06|1.0|I only chose this rating because the company it came from sent me the wrong movie. and even that was scratched and wouldnt work.

0375851569|3.0|The books are great, but if this was a brand new item, I'm not sure how the cover box had been torn! I was just a little disappointed since this was a gift for a future teacher!!

B00008973A|5.0|Love the dancing and it shows how hard it is to get a place in a chorus line in New York.  Great DVD.

B0063IH60K|3.0|It's a standard solitaire game that I expected.  Plays easily on the Kindle.  If someone is looking for a simple game to pass the time they will not be disappointed.  Would also be a good game for children
0425263908|5.0|Awesome series I have read the first two twice. The only thing is waiting for the final book was a little long from the second book.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I use this app on a daily basis it works great.One touch. and you know exactly. how much battery time you have.

B00632HWOG|1.0|About an hour after I downloaded it my account got hacked. I have to believe that there is something wrong with this application... becareful!!!
B000I8G5NA|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!  1 & 3 ARE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AS WELL!!!  This movie is funny, suspensful, and just plain fun!!!

B0092S4WLY|5.0|This game is super fun and challenging. Just when u think there' s no way out, if u keep looking and don't give up, you'll find another clue and move on. Stay with it and have patience, it' s well worth it!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Watched the first two seasons recently and wanted to get caught up for the premier in February.  Fast-paced mindless entertainment - love it!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was just  as amazing as the first two.I am crystals 12year old daughter .I couldn't put the book down.
B0016JBCJW|5.0|Big Wes Anderson film.  While this movie still has his style, it is funnier, and sillier than his other movies, and the symbolism is not as deep. Just a fun movie.<br /><br />I personally love this movie. If you are a Wes Anderson fan, and found The Royal Tennebaum's funny, then you will like this movie.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Really nice game to play while passing the time away.  The product is really easy and relaxing to play on the long trips home.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|This product does really well on thin guage knives like kitchen knives or smaller pocket knives. I know it's not the intention but this is product to horrible for large guaged knives, machete's etc.
141659521X|4.0|good  reading by a very good and dead author
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was AMAZING and it gives you a prospective on what can happen in the real world and hurdles that can be overcome.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|Absolutely loved this move. The all-star cast lives up to their talents.<br /><br />You DO NOT have to be a Wes Anderson fan to enjoy this movie, this is fun for any and all.
1601251556|4.0|The only complaint I have is that it is a little on the small side. I can see why people may be mad about the creases, but for me it's not really that big of a deal. For the price, I am satisfied with it.
B00A9X9ORI|1.0|Simple, there is a story, probably beteween all that violence.  It hard to hear it with all  all those gunshots speaking first.
B008WCP2KG|4.0|this was a gift purchase.  i have heard no complaints so this blu-ray must have been in good shape. cant wait to view it!
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Typical &#34;Chick flick&#34;... don't think the guys would like it very much.  More of a movie to watch by yourself for some quiet time.
B004LWZW88|3.0|Dreamworks is always good stuff.<br /><br />This movie was pretty good. Decent story line.  Just a nice, solid movie. Not the best movie I have seen, but I enjoyed watching it.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Well done.  About half way through I started getting bored but I could tell something was going on so I kept reading.  Lulls you to sleep and then comes out of nowhere.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|There is this part at the end that you'll get to. They eat rotten,spoiled cheers. It so so so gross!
B004EPYZSU|5.0|love the movie - love daniel craig! lots of action and not a lot of gore. as always - super fast shipment.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Great plot, interesting characters.<br />Hard to put the book down<br />A slightly complex story<br />This is a very good read
B00APUQT7I|5.0|seen all the other ones this ones the best yet rented it to watch will end up buying it for sure
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Have been very disiponited with a lot of g-5 games but this one was well worth getting. Would recommend this game to anyone.
B0098VXDDS|5.0|Stars really has produced a classic with this series. Keep it away from your kids' eyes though, there's more blood guts and gore than I can stomach, and lots of raw sex too. All in all, a great production.
B0090EHVMC|4.0|This movie is very cute. It is a good movie to watch with children. However, it is a bit short.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I have not finished reading this book because for  myself, it  is not as 'easy reading' as I would like.  The author is very descriptive with his experience, yet possibly because he is a scientist, his explanation of his experience and his choice of words does not make it easy to understand .  I will try to finish reading this as the subject is very interesting, especially coming from a scientist an I will read it again to try to capture what I am missing the first time read.  After reading it a second time and completing the book, I will review my review.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Super funny movie. I loved all the 80s references. All around great cast. A bit of a corny ending but what can we expect about a movie starring a talking bear. Two thumbs up.
145162445X|5.0|The development of the universe as written by Krauss is spectacular.  With a afterword by Richard Dawkins, the reader feels compelled to seriously consider the ideas presented withing this book.  A flat universe?  A concept worth considering,
B004YM6JLO|4.0|There was a tiny flaw to packaging but I'm still a satisfied customer  over all. I would buy here again.
B009MF56GC|5.0|Great movie, great price!  I really enjoy seeing these &#34;old&#34; guys in this movie.  Action sequences were great, and I thought this was better than the last movie.
B008M87GJK|5.0|I enjoy reading the news from around the world and the BBC does a great job giving me the latest news.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|Every aspect is perfect! I can't wait for the second season to be available. I have read the books and these are great as they follow the books exactly.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|They play it for about a 1/2 hour at a time, they each have it on their own Kindles.  I don't hear &#34;mom what I am suppose to do&#34; when they are playing it.
B003L77GH4|5.0|Got here quickly in good condition and I love his show. The DVDs look cool too and have bound clips an features,
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|The book is beautifully written.  The story is told through the eyes and experience of a young boy and he takes us into his manhood.  He describes the tragic events of his life innocently and truthfully. Richard Ford is a master of understatement and has told an almost unbelievable story in the simplest of terms. His work is always impressive and I look forward to reading whatever he writes.  Eileen Sharan Smith
B003O86FMW|4.0|Interesting story, solid character development. Definitely keeps you interested. I'm headed off to download the next book. Well worth the price of admission.
B008HK3XU4|2.0|I thought I had a kindle Fire HD 7&#34; and ordered the above case. It is too big, but I am using it with the band as a carrying case. The kindle I have will not stay in the clamps/
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Very creative,  I usually have to use hints or brotherly help.  But so far very enjoyable.  Quite puzzling .. the end must continue the search for Jr.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Collins will leave you scratching your head, wondering how she came up with all these twists and turns. Peeta and Katniss desperately try to keep each other a live once again, however it is soon found that their need to save goes beyond each other and far beyond the arena.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This is a great movie series. The second movie is the best but they are all good,<br />This collection comes with extra features and was delivered on time for a reasonable price.
B008602KQI|4.0|One view of a portion of American society.  A rather depressing story.  Coal country in the movie has changed little since the 40s.  I hope the future holds better promise than that portrayed by the decadent society in the movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It was Wonderful! Fantastic! Amazing! Everything I look for in a book and more!<br /><br />AND IS ABSOLUTELY ONE OF MY NEW FAVORITE BOOKS EVER! I DIDN'T EXPECT ANYTHING TO TURN OUT THE WAY THAT IT DID, WHICH MADE IT THAT MUCH BETTER!<br /><br />LOVED LOVED LOVED IT!! (=
B004AKCME8|5.0|I loved this movie. Watched it with my 41/2 and almost 3 year old. Even though they did not understand everything it is so visually beautiful they were mesmerized. Think it is a movie they will watch over and over as they grow up.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was so much more than a love story. It is terrifying to read the horrors a person can face, but there is comfort in seeing them overcome the circumstances. I love, love, LOVED this book. So good!!!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|For a free app it is very good better than most loads and play well a few to many adds for the complete app
B001RIY4WE|5.0|This is a must have for those that have Home Theater. This movie will make your sound system shine.  Pick it up.
0451232852|5.0|I have not been able to put this book down.  There are several different story lines going and as one gets exciting you are thrown into another, and then another before you find out what is going on with the first.  All the stories converge and support each other. I can't wait to read the next one.
B009KHCT94|3.0|Stupid ending its not worth .99 don't wast your money and time  look else were. Its too bad i can't get my money back.
B00005NC66|4.0|Yes, this is a confusing film in many ways. I'll admit straight off that I am not a Godard film; he lost me completely in his 60's \\"Socialist\\" period, but his films were never much on plot or continuity. What makes A Bout de Souffle/Breathless worth seeing is two-fold: Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jean Seberg. They are excellent in working with sometimes-confusing material and I do not believe that many other actors could have pulled this off.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Excellent show. I wasn't sure this was my kind of show but I'm totally hooked and can't wait for the second half of the season!
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|I'm a huge fan of this series and had to pick this up.  I'll watch this repeatedly for many moons.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Ready to read the last book. I keep wondering why I never wanted to read them but these books are that good.
B0091REZMW|4.0|The room scenarios are beautiful. This is a clever game, but it's slow on the kindle. More wait time than I'd like.
B005CA4SJW|5.0|The Walking Dead:the complete first season-- arrived quicker than a self respecting zombie would ever admit to and actually played well with others
B009SQRL4U|4.0|My kids all liked it.  Well done in terms of story and art.  Definitely will be watched year after year.
