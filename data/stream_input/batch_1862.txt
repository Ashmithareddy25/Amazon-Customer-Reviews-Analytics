B00A77II0U|5.0|I don't normally take the time to review a game but I had to with this one...this is a great game. The story line is terrific..graphics are great and it's challenging enough to keep me interested but yet not so hard that it can't b completed. If you like hidden object games download this now. Great game...I hope once I am done there are more out there...worth every cent.
B007KLY8FA|4.0|Thought the quality  of these recordings was fine, considering the age of the masters.  There was a  pop or two, and some hiss on only a few tracks.  The price was more than fair for 4 CDs representing 8LPs. The only thing that cheapened this product was that the song titles did not always correspond to the numbered tracks. Negligence, laziness, or incompetence, how typical of everything now days.  Would I purchase any of the other box sets from this series?  yes in a minute.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I went in to this book expecting it to be great, as it came very recommended by Corey Doctorow, who I hold in high regard.<br /><br />After reading this I completely understand why he would love it, and also why I loved it.<br /><br />This book is a reflection on books, technology and the way we interact with those things in every day life. It's a simple story: guy loses his job, starts work at a weird book store. Then he figures out that there are almost no normal clients in the store, not that many normal books. Then it just goes off on a grand adventure.<br /><br />I ripped through this book in about 3 hours, I just could not put it down. If you have any feelings about books, technology or the way that &#34;everything used to be better&#34; then this is a definite must buy for you. If you just want a great adventure, quest like story, this will be a great buy as well.<br /><br />If you're looking for teenage vampires making out, I suggest a different book.
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|My daughter loves all Tim Burton movies, so she was super excited to get this movie for Christmas. I would definitley recommend.
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|Every gimmick imaginable. More C.G. than anything.  Spent the whole movie going, &#34;Really!?&#34; OK....? Lots of flash and dazzle not substance.
B005P58PIO|5.0|Except for the constant freezing, loved watching all the episodes that I missed in order, it was great!<br />Loved the fact that I can either delete or keep up to my disrection.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Good action not much time wasted between action scenes. The action scenes at Rachel Weisz home setting were technically  accurate and realistic for the most part.  Motorcycle action scenes a little over the top. Jeremy Renner and Matt Damen need to pair up for a sequel and bring together all the intrigue and shut the rouge section of the CIA down for good.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Very good story.  Surprising and it pulled me into the story.  I like that.  Forget the things around me for a time and get hooked into a good story.
0446554995|1.0|The only thing more confusing to me than the downward spiral of L&C's writing, is the fact that this book is getting so many glowing reviews on Amazon. What gives?? Two Graves is so bad that I was embarassed for them and had to stop reading it. It reminds me a lot of the crap writing they are cranking out in the Gideon series. Stay away. (Unless you like Gideon, then enjoy)
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Most movies do not often beat the first or continue to get better.  I was really happy with this movie.  Surprisingly moving and entertaining.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I love Rod Stewart and this Christmas album just made my day.<br />Plus I got it on sale for $5., what else can a girl ask for.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|I do like comedy but it got too vulgar and disgusting.  A Person crapping on the floor wasn't humourous to me.  comedy has to have flow.  While the movie continued i was stuck gagging at the still thought of the a person crapping on the floor.  Very disappointing movie.
B005H29GSI|5.0|Kids loved this game for xmas ans fight over who gets to play with it first. Son nine yrs old and daughter four yrs old.
B003PIUC02|3.0|The series is interesting i think the zero season (actual 2nd season) is the best but I would say this isnt a tv series i going to watch again.  Characters are well thought out but the loss of the original star and replacement on the 2nd season (3rd season of the series)  pretty much ends it for me.
B002VQ7PVS|5.0|I wasn't actually prepared for how good this was... it had been a Kindle discounted deal and I got it because it was reasonably rated and the topic looked interesting, but it far exceeded my expectations. I completely loved it and actually went back and reread sections again. I'm also thinking of recommending it for my book club — strong female character(s), lots of intrigue, twists and turns, and a whole new insight into what was happening in the beginning of WWII. Highly recommended.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Well i didnt know what to expect.  I watched it just turned more disappointing the more the movie went on.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Great TV, superb sets, acting writing and everything. An absolute must see for everyone. Don't  miss a moment of the show.
B0072OFOM6|2.0|Zero season and season 1 should have been left where it was.  since the main actor of season one sadly had real like problem that kept him from continue should have just ended the series from there surprisingly season zero (or season 2) turned out quite well.  But to replace the star and continue ended badly as usually happens.  Didnt like this season.  Got bored with it quickly.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|It is so much fun I play it and I think I'm to old for it but no its really fun and addicting.
B004HW7JMY|4.0|I surprised that they did this season.  Turned out well written even though it they lossed there actor do to sickness and had only been able to do season 1.  Zero season turned out great.  But this series isnt something I'd watch again.  So far I've seen 3 seasons.  and this one was the best..  this and the first season.  I would give it a 5 star but the series is going south.  So giving a 5 just doesnt seem right.  the show should have ended with this season.  Season zero and season 1 is probably were they should have ended it.  There supposed to have a season 4.. not sure I'm going to bother.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|Heaviest rythm, pounding like a heart and a sensitive voice without comparison makes me crash. Cant wait for the sequel.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Well that was some book.  Very exhilarating and a very good book in deed. I have never read a book like that ever. I loved it. If u want something that u can't put down this is a book for u.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|An absolute success. Beautiul poetry, coloured with music and probably the most rythmic voice of today. I couldn't do without it.<br />\\"You say it's big, but you take it... Ride cowgirl\\"
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Like others have written, this app can't even display your newsfeed past the first few entries.  It's like Facebook is trying to get you to not use it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very good story line  and development. The characters are dynamic. The read is also a quick and easy one. Good for any young reader.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Let me just first say I have never written a review before...never, but this book was so good I have to! Colleens writing style captivates you, it connects you with the characters and draws you in. From Slammed, to Point of Retreat, I didn't think she could top those, but boy she did!! Colleen, you have a reader for life!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I didn't see that coming.  Great book.  I love Colleen Hoover!  She is awesome.  I recommend all her books.  She is an amazing author.  Great, heart wrenching sorry.
B000W9DSVW|5.0|The actor line up on these three movies is really amazing.  Each plot line is fun and witty and I enjoy watching the movies over.  The value for this trilogy is really worth it.
B000SXMSJ0|5.0|Drinking alone in the dark seems meaningful when Norah Jones says that she's 'just sittin here waiting for me to come on home and turn her on'
B002VKE1K2|5.0|I was terrified after watching this movie for the first time.  I felt the need to share it with all my friends.  Living in a squeaky old house, I did not sleep right for nearly a month after watching this.  The prequels did not live up to this movie.
0307341550|5.0|This is the second book I've read by Gillian Flynn (the first being the much-advertised 'GONE GIRL').  Sharp Objects is, in my opinion, the better book.  It is a single narrative told in a first-person limited view.  The characters are flawed people but also somehow engaging.  You want to know them better, to know more about them.  The ending was absolutely outstanding and I had to go and buy everything else Ms. Flynn has written after I finished it.<br /><br />Superb read!
B001EBV0OY|5.0|Though this is one of the longer types of movies, it is definitely one worth watching (like so many of the great ones are!)  You really get connected to the characters and hurt with them and rejoice with them throughout.  I have watched this many times and tune in whenever it is on TV regardless where it is in the story line.  A must see.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|News feed won't load. It's very annoying to try to use. Wishing I had my old Kindle back.  Is there another option for Facebook?
B009JBZH54|5.0|Let me keep this short and sweet: The Dark Knight Trilogy is one of the best, if not the best, trilogies ever made. If not for The Dark Knight's amazing success, The Dark Knight Rises would not feel so unremarkable by some. Put simply, Christopher Nolan made Batman respectable again, after the Joel Schumaker debacle. If you have not seen these movies, you are doing yourself a disservice.
B0058YPG1G|4.0|What can I say? If you are a fan of this show, you KNOW that you can't wait to add this to your collection. It's thirteen episodes of crime filled goodness. Follow the criminal adventures of Walter White and Jesse Pinkman as they continue their misadventures in the world of drug making. Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul and Anna Gunn are true acting standouts.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|its so cute just wish there was a turtle. I hope later on one appears. if not please get an update for it.
1439190275|2.0|Not very happy with the book..  I was trying to find out what a nitrate is and I still don't know.  Packages don't tell you and the bood didn't explain it.  I thought the first book was better but I lost mine.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Love the dark knight....and appreciated Anne Hathaway as Catwoman, much to my surprise. And just like with the joker, i liked that the story didn't try to go into the background of the villains' characters too much.
B0050PYNO4|5.0|I am revising my review.  At first, I reviewed it with three stars because of the profuse cussing.<br /><br />However, I am giving it 5 stars based on its own merit.  I actually enjoy this movie very much!  The more I watch it, the more I like it.  I like the &#34;unrated&#34; version better because it has more footage and feels more complete to me.  The acting and directing and writing are awesome.<br /><br />Graeme and Clive the two main characters, are swept away and become fugitives with Paul, the Alien, as they end up on the run from the secret government Black Ops agents who want Paul dead!  In this comedy, even the agents are not without wit and are likable to some degree.  This is a great cast of characters and everything fits extremely well and the story is sequenced nice and tight.  Great job!<br />This road adventure movie has all the thrills of a spy movie, the inspiration of Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and MIB, with tons of laughs - all wrapped up in a road trip with two British Graphic Comic geeks and an Alien making it all happen.<br /><br />We get a view of &#34;America&#34; thorugh the eyes of these two fun loving geeks as they encounter the stereo-typical redneck types throughout the movie.<br /><br />The movie is cleverly written, full of laughs and excitement from one entertaining scene to the next.<br /><br />I appreciate the amazing motion capture and the excellent computer graphic animation.  The details of Paul, right down to the skin textures, lines, blood vessels, etc., is phenomenal.  Paul is very &#34;human like&#34; in that he bubbles with a raw &#34;down-to-earth&#34; personality that challenges the frayed nerves of his sci-fi geek companions, Graeme and Clive.  It is forgivable for the continuity issue of size relationship of Paul to his human friends in a particular scene (an error in size proportion of the Alien to the characters he interacts with - he is oversized in these shots at this particular scene and section of the movie), but it doesn't slow down the action and the fun-loving adventure as these lovable characters find their way to their destination.<br /><br />For once, FINALLY, we have an &#34;Alien&#34; movie that does not portray Aliens as freaky insects, monsters, or evil beings that want to take over the world and eat peoples' brains out. Paul is approachable, friendly, and full of life, even though he is rude and disgusting at times.<br /><br />It is a great movie if you can handle the uncontrolled four letter words that come up in nearly every scene.  Once you get past that, it carries itself.  I just wished it would have been made without all that cussing.  I hope they make a tamer version of it and dub in different explicatives.  Men in Black and Raiders of the Lost Ark, all the other great action movies were able to carry the movie fantastically without foul language and I hope if this movie is ever re-mixed, it would step up to the plate and make a version with a clean mouth.  It would have been a good family movie too if the cussing could be knocked down a bit.fun-loving adventure as these lovable characters find their way to their destination.

B004DNWPY4|5.0|This will open your eyes to the world of the real rich. They don't drive new luxury vehicles those are the UAW.  The real rich are PAW and are frugal. They don't waste their time and $ acting rich and keeping up with the Joneses.  Must read if you are curious what the wealthy affluent people do in today's world.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great read, better than the movie.  Cannot wait to read the others. How will they end, WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT
B0092S4WLY|1.0|No help when one gets stuck in the game.  On the second floor some of the items could not be found.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|Am unable to rate this product as I haven't figured out how to get into the game.Given some time I hope to figure out how to use it.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I can't get enough of Eva and Gideon! So ready for the third book to come out! A little disappointed that the publication date was pushed back, but I suppose it gives me more time to re-read both books to prepare for book 3. Hurry up, Ms. Day! :)
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|I thought i was going to be twice as funny! Someone of it was just plan out stupid! I did enjoy some parts wouldn't recommend to people who aren't amused easily.
B0059XTU1S|5.0|Peter Jackson has laced together a delightful film for the young at heart!  Stodgy old timers forget the times when the world was a mystery in which youngsters feared every day would be the same as yesterday.  Absolutely nothing that ever happened was ever unexpected.  All the giants had been slain, and all the dragons gone away.    Taking on a classic is admirable stuff.  Approaching the Hobbit in what seems to be so soon following the monumental 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy was simply courageous.  Expectations are immeasurable.  Individual demands are often impossible to meet.  And finishing even the introduction to the Hobbit tale in this oversized age of media-hype can be deemed missing the mark.  Yet those who love the masterful telling of a great tale will be enthralled with joy at the spectacle of new things found in old attic boxes.  And for any who battle against looking to the future, take along a young one with you, and watch the wonder of life unfold through their eyes.  If you've seen LOTR, you must see the Hobbit.  If you haven't, you still must see the Hobbit.

B005LAIHPY|3.0|Battleship has a very interesting idea but the acting is not as strong one could expect. Liam Nieeson saves this movie no doubt about it from being a disaster. the special effects are good, and the movie has its good moments, but is not the greatest movie you can watch. This is one is for watching at home one afternoon with your friends and have some cookies, just that!
B008Y2IU12|4.0|All in all the movie was good. I enjoyed the special effects. Charlize Theron played an awsome evil witch. K Stew proved that she isn't as one sided as I thought she was. I'm a buyer of Blu Ray movies with good special effects. Hope you found this helpful ~ Danny D
B005LAIH5O|4.0|The movie is good, really enjoyable! This is one of those movies to watch over the weekend with your friends!
B003Z0BWRM|4.0|There were things I liked about this book but there were also things I didn't like. I found the alternate world clunky and difficult to keep a handle on. The writing style wasn't really my cup of tea and there were too many moments when motifs or descriptions were repeated unnecessarily and moments when descriptions were at odds with each other. Each of these things pulled me out of the story. And I found the final twist off putting. But I did like the central characters of Clary, Jace and Simon and they were strongly enough drawn to make me care what happened to them. I'll be interested to see the movie and I'm probably interested enough to read the next book.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This is a true closing to the new batman trilogy series. Excellent acting, excellent plot, excellent special effects. This movies has it all. I cannot complain of this movie since it fulfilled the expectations. Very very recommended to watch anytime
098555780X|5.0|I bought this because I was tired of making the same bracelet over again in different colors.  There's lots of neat projects to take on, and because of this book, I was able to make some stocking stuffers to give to the family.  Glad I got the book.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Brave is one of those family movies you want to watch over and over again, good humor, excellent animation, good story. This movie makes me remember that even though one could be an adult, there is no problem in going back and feel like a kid again. Tons of fun, great entertainment for the family. Hope if they make a second part to not spoil this series
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I usually am watching youtube which blocks the bar that shows battery level. this app has a featurethat sends voice notifications when the battery is at 20% 50% etc.

B008M36EEI|4.0|Pleasantly surprised with the humor and warmth.  At times the romantic plot a bit predictable, but didn't detract from the enjoyment.
B0076DELIG|5.0|As usual Michael Connelly has given us a novel that is thrilling. Harry is so believable that he is surely a real person out there somewhere...I hope to meet him. I was talking to a patient in the ER the other nite and we were talking about Harry and she too said she was sure he was real....
B002BBJ52U|3.0|I expected a light rom/com, and this delivered exactly.  Not nearly the best, but not unwatchable either. A great ensemble cast of actors. If it was unknown actors, I don't think it would have been as enjoyable.
B001EN71CW|5.0|This is one of the best series ever, in any genre, but especially in science fiction. It's easy to get involved in the story and the characters. It's a shame the show was cancelled.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Saw previews for the movie and thought I have to read this. I am so glad I did. There is no way to visually capture the content of Pi's character.  I was in awe of this story and these characters.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|Love this series. It's different enough from the comic that if you have read the comics you won't lose interest or know what's coming next.
B00129H7VS|5.0|For me, it doesn't get any better than this.  Breathtaking cinematography, compelling biographies, unbelievable action.  The horrors of war a vividly portrayed as well as the close bonds that those who fought it developed for one another.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|Follows the old comic story pretty close. Does a real good job and sets itself up for The Avengers movie
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I have played many board games both with family and friends and I have to say this rates up there with the top five. This is a game of strategies and it makes you use your brain to the full capacity. This game has led to many long nights and numerous conversations through emails the next day. This is a board game that I would highly recommend anyone to bye.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|Castle has the perfect blend of humor, action, mystery, sexual tension, plot twists, and interesting characters.  The chemistry between Richard Castle and Kate Beckett would keep me tuning in every week even if I did not love the rest of it so much, but I do.  With so many mediocre shows on TV these days, this one is the bright star.  Castle has found its perfect formula and has not tried to mess it up as so many sitcoms do.  One of the most entertaining and memorable shows in years, it's always a bit of rascally fun thanks to Castle's irrepressible sense of humor.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|An amazing set of music and so worth the 4$ for the mp3 download! Such great voices and straight from the movie minus the talking parts

B00APUYN0I|4.0|Enjoyed the movie.  No violence or gratuitous sex and yet somehow managed to be thoroughly entertained.  What a concept!  Have to like singing, though.  (Only added the last sentence, because the review must contain at least 20 words and I was a word short).

B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Seeing this movie was being made, made me think what the heck I can't believe they could ever remake that movie.  However, I was wrong and this movie is actually pretty cool.  It is a bit of a different twist on the plot from the older version but it still its the same key points.  This has some pretty sweet sci-fi elements and the action is pretty great along with a great performance by Kate Beckinsale.

B008Z9L94O|2.0|I took a risk and bought this item even after hearing from dissatisfied customers on the web.  I was happy to find that the packaging for this re-issue is absolutely top notch.  You get two nice quality, thick booklets along with the four LPs.  Unfortunately, my A/B disc suffers the exact same problem everyone else is complaining about.  There is distortion which is tolerable up until the half way through the song Zero.  At that point, I'm compelled to shut it off.  Total shame.  I'll hold on to this for the packaging and the hope that the first disc might get replaced.  Hoping I'll be able to adjust this up to a five star some time in the future with an update.

Would definitely make other purchase from this seller through Amazon.

B005I2YL4G|5.0|I was looking for a low power CPU and ended with this APU that says 65 watts. It runs very cool and under Windows 8 the speed while idle is just 0.80 GHz !!! and goes up to 2.4 or even 2.5 GHz instantaneously when needed.<br /><br />PRO:<br />Low price<br />Low power (energy saver)<br />Triple Core<br /><br />CONS:<br />Its hard to make this works under Ubuntu, cant make drivers work with the APU graphics... but if you add a discrete video card these works wonderful.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|its a good game to play when you're board. you don't have to buy anything to okay it is free and you have a variety of options to do. but your energy runs out a lot so half the time you have to buy more energy. (with real or fake $$) but otherwise I love to play it
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Likes:  Action and plot.<br /><br />Dislikes :  Ending.<br /><br />Overall great movie to the series.  Not one of those movies you can/want to watch over and over.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|this is a fun game to play when you're board or alone. I lime to play all the time at my house. but the only thing that bothers me is how bigbof a copy it is to Mario bros.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|Absolutely loved this book. I spent countless night's intrigued by it. I had a difficult time putting it down and am excited to start the next book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is awesome! it is so worth 7.00 bucks. if you get this game then have fun! bye everyone!see you later!
B005LAII3U|4.0|Every once in a while a movie comes along and grabs you by the seat of your pants and takes you for a wild ride thru the universe. Make no mistake,Total Recall falls into that category.This is a remake from the 1990s that starred Arnold, however it has been taken to a whole new level. You are submerged  in a the wondrous world of sights and action that keep you engaged and guessing all the way thru. My suggestion is before you start watching this movie, go take a potty break because you won't want to miss one second of the action.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Heisenberg just keeps getting better and better. I can't wait to see how  the  story  wraps  up  even  though  I  hate  for it to end.
B000VEA38E|4.0|When I first saw Star Wars in the theater we didn't have Blu Ray, DVD or even VCR's to watch the movies over and over. We had to read comics, listen to the album versions (of the movies). Now I still own mine and have transferred them to CD, wouldn't it be nice for these \\"Story of albums\\" available?  Over all, I happy with the discs but these records should be released on CD. Disney has done it with a select few Disneyland records (and I wish they would release more) from the late 60's so why not Star Wars?
B005GY0Y8S|2.0|Couldn't get past the first few pages. The book seemed trite, the story has been done before (and better).  Overall, a big disappointment.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|that is no fun!!! and if you &quot;pass&quot; they call you names!! I would love this game if people played it right!
B00A4GXJD0|5.0|Another great selection by Kid Rock!  This album has rock, country and a little of old school Kid Rock.  Definitely worth the purchase.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Fun and simple adventure puzzle game that will test your memory and puzzle solving skills.  Just remember that your rope is reusable, and you'll make it through ok.  Story was a little lacking, but the fun simple puzzles were what kept me coming back until the end.
B005OCFGTO|1.0|There is one disc missing in my collection when i got it! So Disappointed! Now I have to buy the missing one separately. .
B007V65R54|5.0|This has been reviewed as nerdy and dry. Well of course it is! He's a nerd. But a very interesting nerd with a very interesting history. And he NAILED the 2012 election results. Like it or not, the guy is right.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This is a fun movie for all ages! The kids want to watch it over and over. I'd recommend for everyone.
B00000ILDF|2.0|the condition of the product was good but when watching it it skips,stops...gonna take to a place and hope they can fix it...
B00004LN16|5.0|My son loved it!!! He's a huge AC/DC fan. It got here in great condition as expected. Still ok now.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Maybe not as strong as the earlier episodes, bit still very much worth watching. Good acting and directing.  Plenty of action and a decent story line.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|I'm a big Nickleback fan and wanted to get all the CD's and any with a special disc are a bonus. Maybe not this item but any in general.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I am enjoying using Facebook to keep up with family and friends on a daily basis!  Pictures are an added feature!
B000BEZPMS|5.0|I'm a big Nickleback fan and wanted to get all the CD's and with a special disc are a bonus
B007SGM084|5.0|Love the trilogy. Felt like I was included in the way the two characters fell in love with each other.
B005DF2QMC|1.0|Does not work like it may seem. very sluggish from the start and had to revert back to finding a different method which I did.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|Just a re-release of last blu-ray but I did not buy the last blu-ray version so I am happy. Good packaging and no issues
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent series.  I heard about this series recently and watched Seasons 1 & 2 on line,  I am eagerly waiting for Season 3.  This download was just the preview of Season 3.
B00A31UXLW|4.0|The Black Box<br />Another great book from Connelly. There has not been a bad one with Harry Bosch always a must to read.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Best family movie that is out today.  It helps us remember the good old days.You don't have to use bad language and kill lots of people to have a great movei.
B0064BWDRW|5.0|Nesbo keeps you interested all the way through this one, but leaves you wondering, &#34;what next&#34; for the enigmatic Harry Hole.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just finished the five parts of Wool last night. It certainly gave me a lot to think about. This certainly isn't a generic story at all.<br /><br />And it has left me with wanting more... LOTS more from this author.<br /><br />By the way, when you get done with the five parts, make sure you read the author's Q an A. Then keep reading as you will find the epilogue. You will be glad you did.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|Excellent Product! Quick Service! Would definitely do Business with again! Product came just as described! Product had great photographs included in ad!
B00A6PD8RQ|2.0|The movie itself was not too bad if you like Disney movies.  Nothing spectacular about this one.  I streamed this from Amazon and the quality of the picture was poor.  Many scenes had poorly defined pixels.  My high speed internet connection was working fine.  So I can only conclude the problem was on the Amazon end of things.  Perhaps their streaming services were too busy at the time or maybe there is a problem with their stored video content for this particular movie.  I watched Ice Age 2 (a better movie by the way) the next day during the same time frame and the quality of the picture was perfect.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|Excellent Product! Quick Service! Would definitely do Business with again! Product came just as described! Product had great photographs included in ad!
0091947561|2.0|...then read this book.<br /><br />What you shouldn't expect is any through line, anecdotal or scientific evidence of the claims the two authors make, or useful advice for practical application of these \\"Laws\\".<br /><br />I bought it because in the first few pages there is a wonderful description of how MP3 file sharing changed the landscape forever and how the record companies were slow to react and ultimately led themselves into the difficulties they're currently facing by refusing to accept what consumers wanted.<br /><br />A book full of these sort of real world examples would have illustrated what they're trying to express better than simply attaching labels to conclusions they've made without us having the hindsight and wealth of experience that they do.<br /><br />It reads like a mutual backslapping contest between two successful executives who to be fair just aren't writers. (Didn't this book have an editor??)<br /><br />It's full of jargon that is completely out of context:<br /><br />For example from the book:<br /><br />\\"How can people see approaching danger or opportunity so they're not blindsided?\\"<br /><br />(Great question! I'm waiting for a wonderful bit of advice, aren't you??)<br /><br />\\"One way is to keep a wide lens - much wider than might seem necessary. Notice movement in your peripheral vision. Pick up on the weak signals. Overhear conversations. You are what you read. You are what you do. You are what you experience\\"<br /><br />(WTF?)<br /><br />I'd like to provide a helpful definition from the British Dictionary:<br /><br />non sequitur  nɒn ˈsɛkwɪtə <br />noun<br />a conclusion or statement that does not logically follow from the previous argument or statement.<br /><br />In my opinion this book was a quick and easy way for the publisher Vermilion to pump out a book without much behind it in the way of real or practical knowledge as a conversation between two successful executives and sell a few copies to boot.<br /><br />DP
B000001FKY|5.0|Excellent Product! Quick Service! Would definitely do Business with again! Product came just as described! Product had great photographs included in ad!
B000OVLBGC|5.0|I usually dont write reviews. but, this movie is exception. it shows how a society can affect one life.we are all lucky to be in a democracy. but movie it self is so well directed and acted, it is impossible to stop watching once started.<br /><br />by end of the movie, I regained  some trust in humanity which was pretty slim for me.
B000002G26|5.0|Excellent Product! Quick Service! Would definitely do Business with again! Product came just as described! Product had great photographs included in ad!
B000I9YWDO|5.0|Great movie, a must have for the collection. I did not notice anything special about the flair edition yet however.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|An fantastic game, a turn based action RPG with a dash of dating sim. This game is actually the reason bought a vita which may sound like a waste of money and in between the time I preordered to the day it came in the mail I began to think it was. I of course was proven wrong, the amount of fun I had playing this game more than made up for the price of admission. The game is also really long my first playthrough of the game was about 50 hours or so and thats without getting the true ending or completing all the social links or collecting all the personas. This game also has a bunch of added events such as; a ski trip, new social links, a new character and an extra dungeon. There is also a bunch of unlockables that you can access through the title screen although they are pretty forgettable as you will be spending too much time playing the actual game than looking at concept art or watching trailers for Persona 4 or watching a live performance of the game's soundtrack. There is also a new mini game quiz show hosted by none other than Persona 4's mascot \\"Teddie,\\" a nice touch but again you will probably ignore it in favor of playing the actual game. Not much more I can say without spoiling the game for those who have never played it before and if you haven't but had a chance too than shame on you even without all the extra stuff tacked on the original on the PS2 was a great game. Believe me if you like RPGs in general you will more than likely love this game be it this version or the PS2 version, you won't be disappointed.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I would recommend this for anyone that likes a good romance novel.  Excellent reading and a down right good novel.
B007PVHANM|1.0|Not very happy with these as they were a Christmas present but cou;dnt be played in New Zealand because of the zone. Probably should mention the zone when purchasing from overseas.
B0040UAYI4|5.0|BF3 has never been easier to own noobs....... worked wouthout any trouble, using standard Misrosoft wired usb set. Try it
B00632HWOG|5.0|I have had Yahoo forever so it was nice to put it on my kindle.  I probably will always have Yahoo.
B007MDB6L0|3.0|I got it for my 3year old granddaughter and she seemed to like it. So guess it was okay. I have seen other children's shows that I have thought were better, though.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It is fun to play and is nice to have it when you are waiting around for someone or something
B00AEFVRB2|1.0|I would have given this movie 0 stars instead of 1, if that was possible. Every person in it was sick and depraved.
B003H9M1Q2|5.0|You can't go wrong with this classic!  I got this for my grandkids and they love it.  I loved it as a child and now as a grandma.
B0041T52S6|5.0|This is a great movie for anyone that likes video games and technology.  It is not for kids!  I remember when the previews for this came out at the movie theater and I thought it looked weak.  Thanks to Netflix I got to see this and loved it - so I purchased it.
B008NMT684|4.0|Love that there are not a lot of ways for kids to accidentally click out of the game. My nephew and niece will enjoy this. I'm bringing my kf to the family Christmas gathering so they won't have to fight over the iPad. ;)
B009NPKTN6|5.0|Anyone that loves 80s music will find this to be an excellent movie.  Of course there are elements in it that I could do without, but overall it is a winner!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|my game just disappeared and wanted me to start completely over. nice way to make someone quit playing a time waster!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a perfect sequel to an amazing book. I'm so glad that I took the time to read it!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|All ages love this game! My 6 year old loves it, 10 year old loves it, and my 74 year old mother played it too. Great game.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|My son was mostly entertained but for me it was not very good.  My son didnt ask to watch it again which also tells me it was average at best.
B005HSL626|5.0|Again, great game for any age. Easy to understand and fun to play. Love that it's fruit-makes me wish for fresh summer strawberries! Recommend for all ages.
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|can't stop listening to this CD. Love almost all the songs. Very talented musician and would buy other music from him.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I have nothing against passion, but S&M and head games is just not my preference.  Author is a good writer.
B00843TZJ2|1.0|I am a very big fan of this group, but I lost a lot of respect when they suck money out of my pocket and a bar band sounds better then the original group. Please guys except the inevitable and retire. Before you crash and burn. I would never listen again if it was a concert price I paid and not just a DVD. The only example I can give that suits the situation is a police officer should retire before he shoots the teller instead of the robber because he cannot see to aim the gun at the right person. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD, listen to the music of the past and be happy. They were a fantastic group and hopefully you can hold that memory and not the one I now have listening to this DVD. P.S. I only listened to two songs before I shut it off.
B0095J0AL6|4.0|Daughter loves the CD. Can't give it 5 stars because there s no cd case. The book is the case so can be easily damaged

B008QE9XD2|5.0|great movie... Bought one for my mom and another for my sister.  I know they will really like it too!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Seems to be a good app.  I will continue to use it. It's been pretty Accurate so far. Thank you.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I found the book entertaining.  I would have liked a little less detail and more story.  Overall very good.<br />Loved the characters.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was incredible. I dont know how to put into words how I felt when reading this book. I was mad, sad, happy, excited, shocked, overwhelmed, you name it... It seemed like just when you knew it all, another shock came that made you rethink it all.<br /><br />This is a must read and another slam dunk by Colleen!!!!! NYT best seller coming soon :)
B004EKCNMA|5.0|Wow. Just lovely. You can see Jim Carey in Scrooge....loved ALL of hte actors. Just lovely. Might be a bit frightneing for kids under 5.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Very good movie. Wanted to see at theater but I missed it..I enjoyed watching with my daughter..we laughed throughout the whole movie.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Although easy to predict the course of events, Ted was still a pretty funny movie.  The most interesting twist comes early in the movie when we realize that Ted is not a figment of John's imagination.  John's wish for Ted to be alive actually comes true and Ted's newfound &#34;life&#34; becomes a media sensation for a short time.  Overall, if you keep your expectations properly adjusted and remember that you are watching a movie about a talking Teddy Bear, you can sit back, relax, have a few laughs and not have to think too much.  :)
B00005JL78|1.0|Ordered 4 of these and none of them played on my computers or my dvd players. all I got was black screen and then shutdown.<br />Returned for replacement, which was done promptly but same result. will have to get this from another supplier.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I read Life of Pi prior to seeing the movie. I had meant to read it for years, but never quite got around to it. Once I started it, I could not put it down. What amazing imagery.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I've been a big fan of Tim's for years and quickly devoured his most recent fare. I haven't had the chance to try out most of his recipes yet, but the ones I have made have been excellent indeed. The tools necessary are surprisingly affordable and you likely have most of it already. The recipes, tips, and gadgets are all well-explained and very easy to master.  If you want to learn to feed yourself, this is an excellent resource to begin with, or just perfect your current skills.
B0009V971S|4.0|Yeah, it's for a flip phone. Like that's a problem. You smartphone users laugh and call us dinosaurs. Just remember, when Jen Hudson sings that high C note and shatters your glass, my phone will be protected! By metal! And then I'll call you up and be all, &#34;Hello? It's T. rex calling. Oh, that's right, you can't even answer 'cuz your phone is a can of dog food now!&#34; Then I'll be all, SNAP, hanging up my phone on your ass. YEAH!
1843106698|5.0|This book is an excellent resource and I think one of the best Asperger's books out there.  I would recommend this book to anyone.
B00170DEM8|5.0|Enjoy this Christmas classic in digital format. The picture quality is great. A bargain price for watching this film. If you enjoyed &#34;White Christmas,&#34; you'll find this movie a great addition to your holiday viewing.
B0055PMJMW|3.0|very nice read....wish it was a longer book. But it kept you interested for the long haul. I would recommend this book.
B005LAJ1O0|4.0|........ ........ ....... ....... ...... Awesome  I love this show. I had seen the previews on tv and thought it looked good, But i belive my dvr was set to something else at the time. Big mistake  just started watching season one on netflix cant say enough good things about it..  on epp 10 hope that the next season is as good.
B004WR125O|5.0|If you own a new Onkyo receiver, you must have this to reach the Internet apps. It's worth it for Pandora alone.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|It is always fun to skillfully eleminate the enemy.  Pigs and birds seem to be a less violently way to face the challenge!
B009GN6DT4|5.0|What else can you say. This is a family classic, if you've never seen it, buy it, rent it but make sure you watch this classic at least once in your life.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Sherlock Holmes fans will enjoy this refreshing modern take on the beloved works of Sir Arthur Conon Doyle.  I would never have emagined the role of Dr. Watson being played by a female, but Lucy Liu is a good foil for the arrogant genius of Holmes.  Since the books portrayed Holmes using recreational cocaine to relieve bordom and expand his agile intellect, it is an interesting twist to have Holmes as a recovering addict.  I regret that the cause of this was the death of Irene Adler.  I would have liked to seen Irene as an active adversary as to Holmes she was &#34;THE WOMAN&#34; the only woman to spark his romantic interest.  All-in-all it is extremely well-played; however I am partial to the British seasons of &#34;Sherlock Holmes&#34;.  Also check out the Brits &#34;White Chapel.&#34;
B0094BB4TW|1.0|No point in downloading when the news feed will only show the frist ten posts.  It must be addressed in an update or it will be the deciding factor for my girlfriend in purchasing an ipad or a kindle firehd.  The price difference in tables does not matter when apps do not work well on a kindle.
B007MDB71O|5.0|When I was growing up, I loved Science Fiction.  So much so that I now write SciFi books (check Rome's Revolution on Amazon).  The John Carter of Mars series by Edgar Rice Burroughs was one of my favorite.  Seeing it come to life on the big screen was a life-long dream come true.  I am stunned by the overwhelming negative reaction to it.  It is a classic.  It is a beautifully filmed movie.  The special effects are great.  The actors play their parts very well.  I highly, highly, highly recommend this to everyone and just ask that you view it with an open mind.
B004Y1WCDE|3.0|App has eye appeal, but am not able to get home movies, music (mp3) to show in android tablet.  Realize it may be the Plex server settings that I need to tweak.  Also find that movies and tv shows do not fall into proper categories often and that some even have a totally wrong name for the series or movie given. Once again, this to may be the server issue, but it affects the Android app.
B0008ENICU|5.0|I watched the remake with Meg Ryan and while I did not enjoy that movie, I was interested enough to go back and watch the original.  It is like a time machine going back to an era of class discrimination and fierce gender lines but in a funny way.  I highly recommend it.
B000FC11A6|5.0|The digital version is just a great as analog - can't wait to read more from Mr. Stephenson! Cryptonomicon Rules!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I've watched this several times.  The Blu-ray transfer is great.  Epic action.  I loved how each superhero gets their time to shine. Great movie.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|If you're ready to give your brain a serious break and simply veg out.  Ted is your movie.  Lock the kids out and check the movie out.
B000I9YWDO|5.0|Love this movie...there are so many scenes of which I can relate to at my job.  Funny Funny, you are guaranteed to laugh.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|AHS is back in its sophomore season. Gone are the Harmon's, but the things left filling the void are even worse this year. Last season we had a Frankenbaby and bustling ghost staff at the murder house. Evil begets evil, giving fans a mental institution, aliens, Nazi war criminals, possessions from Satan himself, genetic experimentation, and all with a heavily religious overtone. If you like the first season, you're sure to love this as well. For full episode recaps and news, please visit lefthandhorror.com. Fresh recap every week!
B007URVZJ6|3.0|It was very helpful, but I have yet to write and publish. It gave me a helpful insight into how to go about publishing
B009KNPM9W|5.0|this is a great expansion of an already classic album that is not really known as one of Marvin Gaye's best albums,
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I loved this movie!!!!  Very inmature just like me ! Has a prostitute s***ting on the carpet ! Farts ! my kinda movie !!!  :-)
B00A12VJZM|5.0|I was surprised that I got all these songs for the price.  The songs play well on my Kindle and I get to listen to some of my favorite Rolling Stones tunes.  Worth it!!!
B000YHG72E|5.0|This has become a Christmas tradition in our home--the very funny and heartwarming story of Buddy the elf and his adventure in NYC.  It is a true holiday classic.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Got this for my Kindle Fire. Works great, downloaded fine. The games is fun and a little addictive. I actually like it more than Angry Birds, as I enjoy constructing the contraptions.
0394826817|5.0|Another treat from Richard Scarry. He uses familiar characters to act out simple tales of manners and morality in this pleasantly illustrated book.
B006ZE66P8|4.0|This was a really good book. Good vocabulary for a 11-13 year old. This book has many vocabulary words that are difficult for a child younger then 10 years old to understand. The end of the book is very good and nice for a kid but one of the ghosts may scare children around 7 and under. If I were to rat  this book I would rate it as a B- it isn't the  best book I read but it was good.
B006KX3GXO|1.0|every time I tried to take a pic it wouldn't let me!  you end up using photos of games. hated it
B004X80QNG|1.0|Excellent calendar, unfortunately it keeps making me sign in to Amazon to authenticate, sometimes more than once a day. takes 5 minutes to go through the process just to check my calendar. If not for that it is a great calendar.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|I love the series. I was waiting to get this for a good price and am very happy with the product
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Why??? Runs horribly now even on a dual core and is literally 10 times larger than a year ago and for what? Please, please stop this and optimize this app!!!! I hate giving it one star but there is no excuse for this. And WHY do you store the book data in the app/system space instead of of user/sdcard storage space? AND when one deletes (archives) a book, why doesn't the app remove it from local storage? Why are these very basic housekeeping functions and storage decisions so poorly implemented? :(
B002LVVCQM|4.0|If it's the truth you're after, this is the book for you, but if you're not, be careful - this book is not your friend.
B004T4LUPW|2.0|I'm a bit disappointed in this app right now, it hasn't been synching all of my calendar entries to my Google calendar and it seems to delete any item that was not an all day event after the month is over.<br /><br />Visually there's nothing interesting about it, my Outlook calendar is more appealing.<br /><br />Hopefully I will receive some response to my feedback to the developers about my current issue.  I think I'd be more forgiving if I hadn't paid for it.<br /><br />Lesson learned.
B00028HBKM|5.0|'The Passion of the Christ' is probably one of the most precise, finely crafted films in terms of both presentation and implementation. One cannot easily judge such a film just by taking a glimpse of its trailers or just gazing at the film posters or wallpapers, its only after you get completely lost in the film, you can feel it. Speaking of the  performances, Jim Caviezel as Jesus is beyond the word excellent, very precise in potraying probably the most difficult historical figure in the history of cinema. Along with Caviezel, we are rewarded with outstanding performances from Maia Morgenstern and Monica Bellucci who keep you engaged throughout the film and at the same time giving more life to the film. The rest of the cast is superb and not a single flaw can be found in the entire scenario. The film easily takes you along with it to the last hours of Jesus, making you digest every possible detail during his end hours. One of the most important and rare gems of cinema and the last but not the least person to be applauded is Mel Gibson for making this film unforgettable for years.
B00A3AUGEW|2.0|I really wanted to like this album, but it didn't have the variety of genres and styles that I had hoped to hear. Seemed to be the same song done in different keys with different lyrics. ennnhhh....

B009RI4ZKC|1.0|If you have seen one Wes Anderson movie, you have seen them all.  Have you ever been to a place where every single person was quirky and acted exactly alike?  No?  Neither have I.  Not a single character in this movie even remotely resembles an actual human being.  We seem to be transported to planet Quirky which is inhabited by a bunch of clones who all act and think alike, and thus who are all extremely annoying.  I used to like Bill Murray (back in the &#34;What About Bob&#34; days), but he seems to have gone off the deep end in his movie choices over the past decade.  Save yourself a massive migraine headache and avoid this movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What an amazing book this was.  I was totally unprepaired for the twist that it took.  I was cheering on this young couple as they were trying to figure things out.  Hopefully there will be another book that goes along with this so we can see what happens next.  Colleen Hoover you have out done yourself again.  I would recommend this book to of all my friends.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Aren't they all?  Well acted, decently written, and the action sequences are poignant.  Certainly worth watching and I never even found myself looking at my watch (despite its 2.5+ hours).
B009EELBIS|5.0|I used to watch this movie with my grandmother when I was young. It Would come on TV every year during Christmas. My grandmother is gone now, but her love and spirit still remain. This movie reminds me of that
B009OCR1X4|4.0|I love the music to Cloud Atlas. I bought this soundtrack less than an hour after I watched the movie with my friends, and they did the same. The only thing that detracts from the overall value and quality of the album is the extraneous sounds made by the orchestra members. You can hear them greatly during the Cloud Atlas Sextet, and if you listen closely, you can hear them in some of the other tracks. It's not too bad, but it's slightly annoying when you start hearing the taps of the conductors baton or the shuffling of feet from the brass players. *shrugs* I think it's a worthy buy, but don't expect perfection.
B008VVT51U|5.0|This group of &#34;retirees&#34; represents so many of the people in our lives. With the recent recession, many people with less than retirement incomes will be facing or are facing this situation of how to extend their funds. This is &#34;exotic&#34; as I cannot imagine anyone I know going to India to retire. Is it an option? This beautifully filmed drama/comedy brings to life the fears of living in a place that is much different than one's own country, having the money, mind and friendly support needed for a good life.<br />This is a keeper as it can be seen several times as there is so much happening!

B0058ZPMYG|5.0|This 2010 film called Hesher is designed to make the viewer uncomfortable and challenged to think differently.<br /><br />This story follows the lives of a family of three, a grand mother, her adult son, and the grandson (TJ). The actor playing the father (Rainn Wilson), he's in lots of movies and I think he usually plays in comedies. Hesher is not a comedy but it did make me laugh, a lot.<br /><br />There are several converging story lines in this film.<br /><br />The grandmother who funds everything and silently keeps the family together is dealing silently with end of life issues.<br /><br />The father and son are dealing with the recent death of the wife/mother but really don't explain what happened.<br /><br />The son is being beat up in school by various bullies and bad situations.<br /><br />On his way to school the son encounters a skinny, pale, long haired, dope smoking, tattoo'd homeless guy (Hesher) after he wrecks his bike (again) in a residential construction site.<br /><br />The homeless guy ends up following the boy and pushes his way into their home to do his laundry then wont leave. Hesher hits it off with the grandmother probably because she's lonely and just wants someone to talk to and seemed un-moved by his often shirtless, bizzare, with long haired appearance.<br /><br />The boy seems obsessed with buying their wrecked family car but never explains why. The father is jobless and spends most of the day on the sofa sleeping. Hesher follows the boy around observing him in a series of bad situations. The boy (TJ) yells at Hesher for not helping him, ordering him to stay away again and again, which of course never works.<br /><br />The boy develops a crush on an older grocery store clerk, which Hesher also ruins.<br /><br />And not to spoil the movie, but the story lines all come together in the end as everyone's lives are improved by Hesher's absurd ways. In the final ten minutes of the film everyone's problems are explained to the viewer.<br /><br />Top notch acting and writing. Nice film to watch without kids or the easily offended in the room./>Top notch acting and writing. Nice film to watch without kids or the easily offended in the room.

B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Absolutely one of the worst movies I have seen in years.<br /><br />The target audience was too small.<br />Was not for adults and written for the younger adolescents.<br />Therefor should not have been produced with the foul language.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg is a good actor and should have passed this one by.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|But the ads were so intrusive to this game (which I liked the game play idea), I uninstalled after 3 levels.  The ads would even come up DURING game play, and these were not ads in the corner of the screen, but launched full video ads.  Terrible!!

Also, this movie is laugh out loud funny and super cute. WARNING: This is a gay best friend and best girlfriend movie. Not for straight red blooded males
B000IDEORY|1.0|Ordered for delivery for Christmas but after order was told it would not be delivered by Christmas. It was confirmed at purchase time to be delivered before Christmas. Now I have to go back out and find it in a store and then try and return this one to Amazon. Not much fun...
B003XVYLDU|4.0|I am not sure re-reading old favourites is such a good thing.  Kurt Vonnegut & Lawrence Durrell were sources of wonder & delight during my 20-something years.  Now at 60-something The Alexandrian Quartet seems over-wrought, like too many raisins in the cake, while Slaughterhouse Five, a sure five-star read then, now for me hovers between three & four stars.  (In deference to my younger self I have opted for four.)<br /><br />Vonnegut did shake up the conventional novel structure with his mix of memoir, space travel & war-story all told in his signature, deceptively easy style.  Optometrist Billy Pilgrim is a deliberately nondescript hero who lives through the horror of Dresden bombings, time-jumps & occasionally lands on the planet of Tralfamadore where he is a zoo exhibit, mating with a porn star.<br /><br />Vonnegut deals with time, fate & war without being remotely ponderous.  So what's not to like?  It is a book of semi-expressed ideas, sometimes too much in love with its own iconoclasm.  Or perhaps this 60-something has lost some of that joie de vivre that first attracted me to Vonnegut.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This book is absolutely riveting. My own father served in the US Army during the Battle of the Bulge. The only reason my sisters and I are alive is because of the \\"unintended\\" actions of a dying G I as wounded, he fell across a live German grenade that had landed three feet in front of my dad & his buddy`s foxhole. His death wounded my dad with shrapnel, but left both he & his buddy alive. As my dad always says, there are no atheists in foxhole.... Most of the German people were good people and like Franz, went to war to defend their homes and families. Thank God for good and honorable men who lived their lives as honorably and mercifully as they could.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|for mature audiences however a wonderful comedy almost unlike any other ive ever seen. highly recomended but mostly for Gen Y or milenial audiences
B00APUYWYA|5.0|So much fun! Never got boring! I loved \\"fat -Amy\\" she definitely had this movie in motion! Very entertaining and was worth renting!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have been waiting since Colleen's Point of Retreat to read another book from her. I loved her other two books and was so excited to see this one arrive!!!! Needless to say, I was NOT disappointed with the wait!!!! It was so worth it! Great story line and I didn't see things coming the more I read. I was shocked so much by the events of this book. LOVED IT!!!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I have read all of Tom Clancy's first books but this is the first f his coauthored series I have read.  I found it to be just as much a delight and as gripping.  What a wonderful discovery.  It's too bad more of our current politicians don't see the underlining truth in them!
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|Since the performances featured on the motion picture soundtrack are the performances shown in the movie, I find it almost unfair to compare this to cast recordings that have come before. It has been made very clear that Tom Hooper wanted the actors to take the more intimate approach to their performances, rather than belting like they would performing onstage. This makes for an album that has a much quieter feel than what we've seen before. While many of the actor's voices just don't compare to those who perform in the roles onstage, I think when the music is paired with the visual people will be much more impressed. I'm saving my final judgement till then.<br /><br />In and of itself, I find the recording to be pretty good. They've missed many of my favorite songs, but a highlights album generally won't include things a die hard fan would love, but is more of a primer for new fans or those who want a nice taste of the music. I know I'll be investing in a full recording when it's inevitably released.<br /><br />Highlights for me:<br />ABC Cafe/Red and Black - Aaron Tveit, Eddie Redmayne, and George Blagden are all perfect here<br />I Dreamed a Dream - While never my favorite song, Anne Hathaway is astounding<br />At the End of the Day - This is a pleasant surprise for me, I love the foreman and the whole number feels very much like it does live on stage<br />Empty Chairs at Empty Tables - This is always an absolute favorite and Eddie Redmayne acts the heck out of this song, even though I can't see him.
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|The products in this order arrived on time, even sooner than expected which was great.

B008QTVNUI|5.0|I've only seen the first 3 episodes, and I'm hooked.  Can't wait to resume watching after the holidays! Incredible acting from Damian Lewis as Brody, the US Marine sergeant and Claire Danes as Carrie, the CIA officer.  The depiction of Brody's PTSD is heart-rending, and Carrie's bipolar disorder is very believable and comes across in her intensity.  Every episode brings plot twists and new revelations and keep you guessing and anxious to see the next.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Pro's:<br />excellent graphics; you can zoom in very close to see characters; all the usual characters are in play; Manny, Diego, Sid, etc<br />Cons:  Gets boring quick; if you don't have enough coins or nuts you can't advance; too many &#34;goals&#34; to complete at one time.<br />Basically this is what I call a &#34;building&#34; game, so it gets boring quick.  In the game you build habitats and add &#34;families&#34; to them.  Then you collect game coins from the habitats and the &#34;fun&#34; building you place.  You earn levels by feeding the animals to get experience points.  Other ways to get points, coins and acorns is to play the Scrat game and clearing snow drifts.  Exponetially you get more coinage as you build habitats, but the goals keep you from expanding teritory very fast, and the cost to expand also exponetially increases, so in the end if you're determined not to buy coinage or nuts you are stuck visiting once a day to collect from your habitats and other items - and thats why it gets boring so quick.  At this point is doesn't pass the time for adults or for kids unless they want to just sit around and wait for Scrat to run accross the screen to try and tap and get his nut, and collecting from the low coinage habitats.  Two things I really don't like is the low coinage habitats aren't really worth tapping on, unless you have all day to just tap on them to build up enough coinage.  Then some of the goals almost force you to buy them.  Some of them cost &#34;nuts&#34;.  You only get a few per day, even if you play the Scrat game, I haven't won &#34;big&#34; with that, so a gyro drop is 40 nuts so I've been playing about 3 weeks and I only have 31, although you get the option to skip it for 10 nuts.  either way you lose nuts and it becomes a game of patience.  A penquin statue is 20K coinage and you have to buy two to complete the goal, but I need 300k for the next expansion, so why waste 40k for a stupid rock?  Completing some goals gets you some coinage back, but not all of it.  Tho most &#34;decorations&#34; planted near habitats allow the habitats to produce more coinage, however they take up space that you may need for more profitable habitats.  Catch 22.

B004UJAOLM|2.0|For me it was hard to read - the language mostly I think, but also since the names are the same for the adults as the children - hard to follow - seeing the movie helped me figure it out but I never went back to finish the book
B00A757EFW|5.0|Plays and responds well ! I really like it.<br />Challenging I have not yet eatten all my dots yet but its just the first day .
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I have to disagree with others' comments regarding \\"name-dropping\\", \\"self-indulgence\\" and \\"Tim's ADD nature\\"...it seems they are seeking \\"flaws\\". The names mentioned by Tim are relevant based on the topic of discussion, he's obviously perpetually curious and and he simply answers the questions in the minds of not only himself, but the average reader, when he wonders off on a related tangent to discuss/describe in more detail a little-known area.<br /><br />I took this book on a week-long holiday and spent the entire week reading it...and I am not a slow reader. I usually skim what is often fluff-filled content in an attempt to extract the substantial information. Reading the 4-Hour Chef was not difficult but rather the references to interesting websites kept me occupied for long periods of time on particular subjects from Amazon items to TED lectures to phrases in foreign languages!<br /><br />I found the cooking information in this book excellent despite being a competent cook. I have new insight into the average person's aversion or confusion or apprehension about cooking. I guess I never really thought about it or even experienced it because my upbringing had me functioning in the kitchen at an early age. Tim's cooking content did however remind me of the importance of basics. While multiple-step, multiple ingredient recipes cause me no angst, I think my \\"cooking\\" will likely improve because I will be inclined to dial-back the level of complication and enjoy simplicity...something often lost by those who reach a level of accomplishment and look for greater challenges.<br /><br />I whole-heartedly recommend this book! It's fun, it's well written, it's information dense.

0525478817|5.0|I normally do not write reviews on Amazon. But TFiOS converted me to come out of my virtual hidey-hole and give a review on this book.<br /><br />I'll be honest. The first time I read it, I was let down and thought it to be anti-climactic after rushing through it. I read it a second time more slowly. A third. A fourth. Slowly but surely, I loved it more and more to the point I can now affirm wholeheartedly with the person who wrote a message to the potential buyer (me) on a store receipt inside the book I found after I purchased it. The message proclaimed, \\"THIS IS THE BEST BOOK IN THE HISTORY OF FOREVER! GET IT-- YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. :)\\" I think the person's action in leaving a message speaks volumes in and of itself.<br /><br />This is not to say this is everyone's cup of tea. Perhaps one will read it countless times and not be wowed, and that's perfectly fine. After all, no book is going to appeal to everyone. But what TFiOS accomplishes, at least to me, is that it sidesteps the entire cliche of tragicomedies relating to teens and cancer, and shows who they are: human, with faults and flaws and humor and zeal. I can imagine a Hazel and Gus so perfectly; they can be my peers in class. The parents could be just like mine. But this is not a fairy tale. In its imperfect but well-developed characters and plot, it is paradoxically a near-perfect book. The prose is succinct and so Green-esque. One sentence had me tearing up, the next had me howling on the subway in laughter, with people giving me wary glances.<br /><br />I always appreciated John Green's work, because he never dumbed down the teenage population, and although I am past the teenage fiction age group, I appreciate it more and more as time goes by. It's like fermentation-- they get better with age, such as kimchee and wine. This book is no exception.

B000E5N62U|4.0|You know an artist has respect when even the bad reviewers point out how much they love him. They all say: \\"I'm a big Donald Fagen fan but, this album made me toss up my lunch,\\" or something like that. I lost this CD a few years back in 2007 and never replaced it, after buying Sunken Condos, I got a copy of Morph The Cat. The band is really good and this one unlike Condos has a cool jazz vibe to it. Keith Carlock and Freddie Washington set down a great groove and keep the feet tapping, throughout the album. I like the use of a steady band and these guys really add to the listening pleasure.<br /><br />The title track is one that I admit goes over my head. I don't enjoy it near as much as I enjoy the other cuts, especially the next one \\"The H Gang.\\" \\"What I do\\" is a conversation with the ghost of Ray Charles and I think he would have liked the groove on this one. \\"Brite Nitegown\\" deals with death and that's not always easy, but Donald pulls it off here. This is an excellent cut.<br /><br />\\"The Great Pagoda of Funn\\" is about the struggles of a young couple thinking about their future. \\"Security Joan\\" is a light tune about Donald trying to pick up Joan the security lady at the airport. \\"The Night Belongs to Mona\\" is another Fagen tune about a crazy woman, this one stays forty stories above the city: \\"dancing all alone.\\". \\"Mary Shut the Garden Door\\" is a highlight of the CD and maybe a prediction of the future. Then we have a reprise of Morph the Cat and even though I'm not a fan of the song the reprise fits well here.<br /><br />In summary I give it a light four stars as a few of the tunes lack the trademark Fagen hooks, but the band is tight and the groove is right. H gang and Mary are two classic Fagen tunes and worth the price of the CD alone. If you just bought Condos and are wondering about this one, buy it. You won't be sorry.

B00AMBH70S|2.0|One of the reasons I like the first 3 Bourne movies was that they were, with a few exceptions, plausible to realistic. The main plot of this movie is built around science fiction (ad-hoc genetic re-engineering). That just ruined it for me and made it too fake to believe.

B009G78EE2|5.0|This should be one of the top albums of 2012, it just contains everything one could want in an album. And the fact that it is truly indie and so successful is really a testament to the age we live in.

0316017922|5.0|Makes you realize that there's so much more to someone being successful, than just what they do.  Many of today's successful people wouldn't have made it if born in another era, or even 10 years different than when they were born.  The hockey player analogy is an excellent example -- who knew what month they were born in, made a difference?!?
B00APUYWYA|4.0|The story line was pretty predictable -- college girl finding herself, underdogs finding themselves, guy gets girl and vice versa.  But an enjoyable watch nevertheless.  Really enjoyed the music and performances.  Rebel usually stole the show when she was on screen.
0316172324|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell does it again.  The mind is an amazingly complex thing.  This book is about the first 2 seconds you look at something and come to a conclusion.  With attention-grabbing stories to get the concepts across, I found myself making notes b/c they were so many things I'd like to share with others.
B000ATQYT2|1.0|I have seen this movie in it's original form hundreds of times and have it pretty much memorized. We watched it every Christmas, over and over again when I was a kid. I absolutely adored it. But I was heart broken when I bought it to show to my seven year old brother. I had no Idea they cut out \\"The Love is Gone\\"!!!! I thought maybe the instant video version was damaged or something. Or maybe they cut it so I would buy the hard copy version. I sat there wondering what had just happened? Did they seriously cut an important part of the movie out? I checked online only to find out this was done with the first DVD release! WTH?! If I had known they had wrecked my childhood movie I would not have paid money to buy it again. I am going to go into my parents boxes and find that old VHS. I refuse to watch this movie on DVD or Blu-Ray until they fix it. What's sad is my brother loved it and will probably never see it complete. It makes no sense without the song, it was absolutely beautiful. Now it is a hollow shell of itself. I wish Hollywood would just leave movies alone, once they are out DON'T TOUCH THEM! Especially when a generation was raised on the unedited version! I thought maybe Lucas was the only one bent on \\"fixing\\", or rather, destroying classics. Guess not. One more movie I can no longer watch.
B000VAKNJW|5.0|December 24  2012.  Ms. LeeJai Cook, Roaring Springs, TEXAS USA.<br />This is a marvelous album. Beautiful voices and music.  I may not be qualified to critique the voices of the tenors, but \\"I know what I like,\\" to borrow a phrase from someone. If  you like classical music sung by the three tenors, this album is for you!
B008NB0SQO|1.0|For anyone who grew up on the VHS version of this movie, you will be sorely disappointed after watching the DVD/BlueRay version.  Someone at Disney, in their infinite wisdom, decided to edit out 3 minutes of the movie.  The key part of this is when Michael Cain (Scrooge) and Belle are singing the lament song to each other \\"When love is gone...\\" in the field of snow with the ghost of Christmas past.  This entire scene is now missing from the film, and literally ruins the rest of the film for fans.  It is such a pivotal point in the story, I cannot believe it was cut.<br /><br />To make this abundantly clear, the VHS movie runtime is 89 miuntes, the DVD/BlueRay version is 86 minutes.  3 minutes doesn't sound like a lot, but it makes a HUGE DIFFERENCE.<br /><br />Again, if you grew up watching this move on VHS, this ridiculously poor edit almost ruins the rest of a wonderful masterpiece.  Come on Disney, what the heck were you [thinking].<br /><br />The even worse part is how in the \\"Special Features\\" part of the disc, they spend so much time talking about that scene between Scrooge and Belle and how Michael Cain worked so hard to sing for the scene.  Great to talk about how great this was and then completely cut it from the movie.<br /><br />With that edit in place, Scrooge simply arrives in the snowfield with Belle, has the short conversation about money, and then they fade back to the rest of the movie.  Its obvious in this scene there is something cut and missing.  The flow is terrible.<br /><br />Until this movie is re-released, we will continue to watch the VHS version.  I will likely master my old VHS copy on to DVD before it disintegrates.
B008BD9SI8|5.0|This story although slower to start than some of his others soon heats up and maintains an awesome pace of gore, manliness and heroism. With a splashing of rough justice and an even rougher love story(if you could name it that). Joe Abercrombie has written another instant classic. I can not recommend this and all of Joe's books highly enough.

B009E3EXMU|5.0|Saw them at the Garden in '77.<br />The DVD has several audio mixes. The stereo mix is weak IMO and Page's guitar is way down low and almost anemic. However the 5.1 mix is significantly better and brings everything to life. If you have 5.1 capability, don't even bother with the other ones.<br />Great show, great band. Lot's of fun to watch and well worth the cost of admission.

B009HEJXFS|5.0|While the first five minutes start off comicbookishly, it really picked up after that. The four of us who watched it really loved it. Probably more than the first two. A great balance between action and humor with a nice touch at the end, leaving you with psychological nuances to ponder. The young Tommy Lee Jones character K was done really well.
B0053O89WY|5.0|This got here the next day after ordering it. It was wrapped and amazingly not opened. I will be ordering more from these people :) Very truthworthy
B0076DELIG|4.0|Same Harry Bosch but I like the way they have him aging. He is no longer a young man but still has the same resourcefullness about him. His edge and expereince continue and he still has the sensitivity in his relationship with his daughter. He continues to still have that cop hardness but has formedsmall group of meaningul relationships.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Probably my favorite movie of all time. Love the whole Chritopher Nolan Batman trilogy. Blu Ray is the best way to watch it, video quality is at its highest.  Get this movie!
B004XGN8W4|5.0|Perfect for the gaming addict especially when travelling with no access to a tv. My son used it while on vacation and it was perfect.
B001AUKUS6|5.0|if you love the group RATT which we do.. then you love all their music.. this is one of the best.. 2 of our fav songs!
B00A23MYCC|4.0|Tho I'm no prude, this seems to have been written for a Dane Cook type fan, but all-in-all, it was a good, funny and keep you wondering comedy.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|I have watched this so many times that I decided to ditch the VHS copy and invest in a DVD.  My husband and I laugh out loud every year, even when we know what is coming.
B00AJRQLTI|2.0|Who told Russell Crow he could sing? My god, he is flat and/or atonal on every song. Too many of the actors are not singers…singing performances cannot stand on their own. Too bad, I was really hoping this was gong to be great, but it is not. I am afraid that this soundtrack only supports the movie, vs on Broadway where the music is the centerpiece.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|I didn't expect anything like the fun of the classics MIB 1 & 2, and I was right. Funny enough to be entertaining in spots and probably worth the watch, but shouldn't have been made.
B00110K62U|5.0|If you liked the play, you will love this DVD.  The sound is good and the camera angles.  It isn't a filming of the stage play so don't expect that.
0451228731|5.0|This is a well written and engaging thriller a level above Crichton in plot finesse and technical sophistication. The fact that it was published in 2009 makes it downright prescient.
B005LAIH9A|5.0|Over a decade has passed and the gang return to East Great Falls, Michigan for the weekend.  They will discover how their lives have developed as they gather for their high school reunion.  How has life treated Michelle, Jim, Heather, Oz, Kevin, Vicky, Finch, Stifler, and Stifler's mom?  In the summer of 1999, it was four boys on a quest to lose their virginity.  Now Kara has grown up and is a cute high school senior looking for the perfect guy to lose her virginity to.
B00APUQH0W|2.0|The trouble really was: Cute but predictable.  Just another retirement funding vehicle for Clint Eastwood.  Take a 'wiff' on this one ...  Definitely not a 'must see'!
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Finally some of the science fiction that the original book series was noted for.  Will this guy end up in Antarctica?
B007EECSFA|2.0|I have liked other books by this author, but this one did not fulfill my expectations.  The character development was completely lacking and the writing was very confusing.  I would not reccomend this book to friends as I have done others by Morton.
B009G78EE2|5.0|I've heard first about Macklemore on Bob Edwards radio when Anthony DeCurtis from Rolling Stone magazine listed the Heist as top album of the year.<br />DeCurtis spoke a bit about the artist and the album, themes, inspiration, rehab and relapse. Then Bob Edwards played a minute from \\"Starting Over\\" and that was enough for me ...<br /><br />I bought album instantly and I have not stopped playing it since.<br /><br />I am rushing to write this review because I want to share the excitement for the artist and the simply great album. It helps that I admire the lyrics and the themes. I am absorbed by the raw sound, honesty and the force of the message.<br /><br />I have not been this excited about the hip hop album since hearing the \\"Jesus Walks\\" and \\"Never Let Me Down\\" from Kanye West's debut [[ASIN:B000VZP9G4 The College Dropout [Explicit]]].<br /><br />I don't want to go into intellectualistic hoopla about this album. Simply crank it up, listen to the lyrics and enjoy the sound.<br />This is one of the easiest five stars I have given to the item on Amazon.
0399157565|4.0|I am starting over as the perp was completely unknown to me when I got to the end.  Too much hand wringing as usual but very good characters over the years that we learn more about but not enough to follow this convoluted plot or plots.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|it's a fantastic CD; you're missing out if you don't have it! and it's for a great price too :)
B00633W614|5.0|I've read several Jeffrey Archer books and I always enjoy his story-telling abilities. He likes to write epic tales spanning lifetimes. I read the first book in this trilogy an couldn't wait to get started in this, book two. I downloaded it immediately on my Kindle. After reading this one, I was so disappointed to discover that I'll have to wait until March for the third.
B00992CF6W|4.0|The only things that are bad about this app is that it never turns night, so you cant sleep + you cant blow up Tnt, so it is a useless block.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I have read a lot rave reviews on he ath-m50s,they sound compressed, but the sony 7506's sound live and to my musicians ear snare drums sound like real drums,piano notes are clearly defined, I can tell real trumpets from synthesizer trumpet programs, bass notes are deeper and sound individual not smeared as on the athm50's, if you want to be there live  get the sonys,if you want to listen to background music the audio-techicas are ok,the detail in the sonys are distrubing in their clarity and almost give you a visual of the instrument being played,if you want to imagine that you are at a live consert get the sony's ,for low level compressed background listening the athm50 will do the job.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|It is a very enjoyable movie! I was worried I would hate this movie because I am not a GLEE fan and I wanted to stay away from anything close to it but, I love it. It is so funny, and you really like the characters. Every character is unique the songs are great and everyone has a wonderful voice. I strongly recommend this movie!
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|l liked this game on the computer but even better on the kindle.<br />the cards could be bigger but still ok.<br />don't like the pop ups after each game.
030759565X|4.0|I wish this book was for me, but it's a Christmas present.  I thumbed through and the pictures of the food looks delicious!<br />Pretty heavy book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is amazing game to play I love this game it is so fun for everyone of all ages yeah
B0055OMBIU|5.0|Can't wait to put together...am totally hooked on these puzzles. All wrapped up and ready for Christmas Day. Best puzzles yet!
0061997811|5.0|Seriously.. this book is amazing. The things included are so fun to look at and it is simply packed full on information! A definite must for any fan! It has a pull out map, acceptance letter, and so many more things from the movie. and it is laid out in a beautiful scrapbook style. again.. this book is a must have. so simply stunning!
B0041O40EI|5.0|So different having the base with the history of London.  A real challenge.  Looking forward to the next layer with the help of family over the holidays.  Fantastic puzzles!!!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|I see a bit of all of us in this one.  A hilarious twist on the Christmas story.  hehe ho ho ho
B00AESN8XY|5.0|What a great game! Very educational as well as entertaining. I found Plague to be pretty realistic and some scenarios can be down right frightening. I highly recommend this App.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Stunning graphics. Interesting storyline with plenty of fun and quirky puzzles. Has the coveted ZOOM feature for those hidden object pictures as well. Great deal and has replay value with three difficulty settings. Keep em coming G5 ...we Kindle owners can't thank you enough!
B0094BB4TW|2.0|There's no way to use book's apps. The pages don't fully load and it's difficult to navigate. I deled this pp as well.
B000Z6MIQS|1.0|I received the CD in a cracked case and the CD was cracked as well! I was planning on giving the CD as a christmas present, but now that will not be possible.
B008M87GJK|1.0|The BBC is well now for good web content. Why couldn't it be included on this app? There's no access to any of their radio content or the World Service. Needs to add more good content to be worth it!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|App only loads 10 or so statuses.  Frustrating for a first time user!  This app works fine on my iphone.
B004NELBPC|4.0|Great app! The only problem with it is the photos don't load and the videos don't play. Other than that it's easy to get to articles.
B005UA0FLE|5.0|This is literally the best christmas music I have heard in my entire life. Seriously, its definitely worth the money.
B005ZCXPP0|1.0|Of the hundreds and hundreds of movies I've watched, ranging from Criterion Collection and AFI lists to campy fun like Army of Darkness, this movie has the terrible distinction of being the second movie that I could not bear to complete.  (The first being Batman & Robin.)  It's tedious, waaay too long, predictable, and not entertaining.
B001U3Y5XE|4.0|Lego Mania around here. This is a game of you draw the card, you build what you've drawn with Legos. The boys love the game, but I think that $65 is a bit pricey if you ask me. It is a good quality game, but I think that the price is a bit much for what you get. It was packaged appropriately and shipped expediently. Will use seller again.
B009VB97EY|1.0|If you just want to watch something to kill time, then here's your movie. I really don't understand the point of the movie and I'm sure you won't either.
1401322786|5.0|I can't look at time the same after reading this treasure of a book. Paraphrasing my favorite quote: Why does God limit our time? To teach us the precious value of each day.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|I am not a film critic and do not wish to impose my opinions on other people. If you like action and great special effects, you'll like this. And if you are a fan of actors known for their roles in action, you'll love it even more.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Great movie! The acting and story line were superb. Wonderful soundtrack and stunning imagery. Watched it twice before the rental time ran out and can't wait to watch it again.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I was very pleased that I got the CD I had pre-bought as soon as it did, and the price was even lower...
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|Not as good as I had hoped. Cinematography was good, writing was okay, premise was not as interesting as it could have been.
B0083GQVOC|1.0|Depressing, disjointed, slow, and just very difficult to watch. We turned it off after 30 minutes.  We could find no redeeming qualities.
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|Fun movie, well directed. Story was good and the pacing kept us interested. We liked it and would recommend it to our friends.
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|Pretty good, can't put my finger on what would make it better.  Maybe it was my mood.  I would have liked more background on the state of affairs and there wasn't a clear reason for why what was happening was happening.  Man, hard to do this without being spoilery.  Cast looked great!  Set looked incredible.  Fun story.
B0090EHVMC|3.0|Not great either. The wife liked it more than me and it was entertaining. Kids might miss the message though.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|But, it took half the movie to figure out what the heck was going on.  I couldn't figure out if the new character was good or bad or...
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|The book was good if not great. Any time there was a twist about to occur, the writing was very specific, like there was a concious effort to make sure someone couldn't turn the pages back and say &#34;but wait, that can't be, he said ....&#34; so you knew to expect a turn.<br />Otherwise, fairly entertaining. I may read the next one to see if the writing develops more naturally.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|It was incredibly long, incredibly confusing and could have been about an hour shorter.  The last 30 minutes made the movie worth it, but it was a bit overdone.
B00846TTDG|3.0|shoot em up kill them all dead movie. It was ok. seems hollywood is just pumping out a bunch of mediocrity lately.<br />watch Full Metal Jacket if you want to see a good war movie.
B009HELT3C|4.0|I liked it and thought it was a nice wrap up to the franchise, if you can call it that.  Good spirit to the movie.
0525953728|5.0|I read this entire book on a long haul across the very boring state of Kansas going to Denver.  This book kept me wide awake the whole time.  I met a lot of NAVY SEALS while deployed to Afghanistan and have to say they are the best human beings I've ever met and what all Americans should aspire to be like.  This book was excellent and gave a true account of what really happened.  It was the SEALS that killed UBL...not Obama.
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|Pretty good, all my old favorites were there.  Still, get that many action hero's in the same film and the dialog can get pretty stilted.  Loved the references all around and thank God for Chuck Norris.
B009G7ZYPY|1.0|I didn't realize Judy Garlands Some where over the rainbow could be mutilated but this just wasn't mutilated they shredded it afterwards. I do not think I will purchase any more of her c.d's unless she stops listening to who ever<br /> is helping her with her scores she needs to listen to who ever helped her for Britain's got talent
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy playing this game for hours. It is a fun free version of solitaire. The ads are not to distracting.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|good time waster.  no need to buy you can grind it.  what I like about GLU games three mores words
B007HACDLK|5.0|Well-written, exciting and timely. To say it is a page-turner is more than a cliche, it's an honest opinion. Enjoy.
0446343129|5.0|This book gives the entire history of refined sugar and tells what it's doing to people in modern society. It serves as a warning for those who are willing to listen.
B000002KHB|5.0|I finally bought this CD!  I have the album and just really missed hearing it so there ya go. Flashback from my past!
B004EKCNMA|5.0|Great for the whole family. So much like the 1938 version. We will make this our new Christmas tradition. Loved it.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|I love this new CD from one of my fav bands of all time!  I've waited years upon years for them to get back together, and I'm really loving the new album.  Perfect for all the time I spend in traffic!  Can't wait to see the show live in February.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Great game, great service. fast ship This is a great game and makes a great gift for all ages. Highly recommend
B009MF5BXK|4.0|It was a good show, I personally enjoyed seeing all my old favorites in one movie.  Funny,great to watch brought back memories
030758836X|1.0|I had been looking forward to a good read. In the end I didn't even hate the protagonists, just myself for not having the backbone to just stop reading.
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|We watched this streaming from Amazon and the quality was excellent, no hiccups or issues at all. The movie itself was fun and entertaining; nothing thought-provoking or deep, but a good light watch.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Baffled at how Amazon sells these as such a low price ($4). This purchase led to a great family night watching the last movie, which was intense, suspenseful... with the perfect combination of making you laugh and cry.  Everyone loved it!
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Great Score-Can't wait to see the movie on Christmas day-Have seen the stage version and the 25th anniversary show-This could be a winner!!
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Night Visions is by far one of the best albums of 2012. I haven't heard an entire album sound this good in such a long time. Imagine Dragons are incredibly talented and will go far. From the popular &#34;It's Time&#34; to songs like &#34;Demons&#34;, Night Visions will easily become one of your favorites.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|It was a pleasure to see some famous British actors and actresses strut their stuff.  The locale was fascinating and the problems faced by the characters aroused my sympathy.  I have recommended it to people who like the unusual.
1882723007|5.0|Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down, I knew there had to be more to this life than previously thought. very compelling book, a real eye opener, wonderful.
B005JZBP8W|5.0|fast service, 18 more words required for this rating rating so so so so so so so so so so
B001FB55I0|3.0|I avoided watching/owning this for quite some time since it stars Bale, I just think he's the worst actor on the planet. True to form he adds nothing to the Terminator franchise. If you're a fan of the series of movies then it's worth getting, but this movies doesn't really do much aside from stagnate the concept even more. I can't even remember how it ended already.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Bad Piggies is alot of fun to play but is also challenging.  You even pick up some aerodynamics principles!<br />My grand children love it also.
B008H6GH8I|4.0|This is superior to Degeneration in every way. The CG is more modern and motion capture feel, better screen play and script. Voice acting is decent... good RE story and climactic ending. The only negative is some of the characters, the fat russian hip dude is annoying etc, but that's about the only negative.
B0037OOU8O|5.0|This movie alludes to the Story of Job. It is probably the most Jewish- centric movie the Corns have made to date.
B004CURZFC|5.0|Was an excellent movie and the 3D version that I ordered was excelkent quality with my Sony 3D BluRay player. Would highly recommend this movie to everyone!!!
B000KIRT6A|2.0|when open the box and you see this piece of plastic and cheap made product the only thing that you have in mind is in resale or put in some place away from your sight... i don`t recomend this pedal even the others ones made for behringer even when the cost is no expensive but you could and would see the DANO`s before buy this things. i don`t recommend at all this things.
B00632HWOG|3.0|Only problem is that it doesn't have yahoo messenger. Very disappointed about that. That's why I didn't give it 5 stars.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This is one of the better series on TV right now. If you were a fan of &#34;24&#34; then you will love this show. Can wait until season 2 is available for purchase. I don't have Showtime so I will have to wait until it's released on DVD
B002VQ7PVS|5.0|Enjoyed every page. Could not wait for the next experience. It shows what can happen without many people even being aware of what goes on behind closed doors. Good history read and author has many unexpected twists and turns.<br /><br />rjp
B009CPE424|4.0|I rated this movie based on my kids liking the movie. I did not see more than a couple minutes so I can not say much about the story.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Excellent brain game.  Keeps the player on their toes.  Hard to put down, makes the player. want to go to the next level.
B00138KEZ4|5.0|Sarah is one of the Great Female Voices of all time.<br />Like all her music, it is timeless and without equal
B00AC8ZJPQ|4.0|Having no history with the Halo games I was a little hesitant to rent this film.  I read the reviews and gave it a shot.  This could have been a stand alone movie. It was well worth the time and money.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I absolutely loved this story. Great Love story and Abby and Travis are by far my favorite fictional couple of the year...compared to Eva/Gideon and Ana/Christian. You won't be sorry if you take the time to read this one.
1451695195|1.0|god is fake.<br />..so is heaven.<br />..so is santa clause.<br />..the tooth fairy<br />..the easter bunny<br /><br />grow up<br /><br />this book is pseudo-science
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is not just another YA love story.the author weaves this story with such grace and magic. You think you have an idea what will come next, but I was really blown away. Theree is depth to this book, which will make you smile, laugh, and shed some serious tears. I loved Slammed, but this book blows that one away.
0446547654|5.0|I have read all of Nicholas Spark's books. They are all great. I buy them for myself and then donate them to our local high school.
0920668372|5.0|This has long been a favorite book and I bought copies to gift friends with.  This should be required reading for every parent.
B007ADIRDM|5.0|de antemano muchas gracias son de muy buena calidad que mas me gustan mucho son para mis hijas para reyes
B00785P2QC|5.0|I just started playing it (level 6). It's a little monotone and it took me few days to figure it out but o t her than that, it's ok.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Received it on time for a Christmas gift.  Am sure it will be welcome and make one little girl very happy.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Ken Follett has done it again: he's managed to take a vitally important period of human history and offer it up as a deeply felt tale involving several protagonists who lived through the period.  Through his deft imagery we see how experiences of early 20th century Europe and America unfolded, and the myriad ways in which governments, monarchs and private individuals affected the outcome.<br /><br />Few living novelists today can best Follett for historical accuracy and analysis.  This kind of reading should be offered in classrooms.  It pulls the reader into a historical perspective one seldom finds in textbooks.  I highly recommend it.
B005OK725M|5.0|most underated movie of the 2011-2012 very well zoe saldana was just like the  female scarface the girl was ruthless awesome flick
B000U0F7RG|5.0|This is just as wonderful as it looks. Hours and hours of Gilmore. No one can be mad about it.<br />Happy Christmas!
B009HEJXFS|5.0|better than i thought it would be will smith and josh brolin were great together the story was much fluid and very funny
B000T433CO|5.0|Every once in awhile we just need a reason to believe that happiness can happen.  The Holiday gives us that!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is fun but it is a copy of temple run and a copy of air Penguin and maby a copy of temple run beave but I can't get it because it is not FREE!
B003B0D2QU|3.0|I ordered this book to gain insight about our President's past. It was not a very well-written book and at times choppy and hard to follow.  However, I better understand his psyche----or do I?????  I bought a used one----it's worth $5.99.
B004WR125O|2.0|Yes, it worked on my Onkyo receiver. The instructions were great; plugged it in the front (and the back) port, pressed all the right buttons, and then got a disappointing 34% connection despite only being about 20 feet from my Wifi. Not good enough to stream Pandora so it's going back. Ended up hard-wiring my receiver, was a pain to do but what a difference, and only cost about $40 in parts from Lowes! Seems like this USB works for others, so perhaps there is something I don't know that would have made this work better...but then, if there is, shouldn't it be in the instructions?
B00AGH6FD8|5.0|This saved my morning, It was my favorite movie growing up and was a great choice for my class to watch to get in the holiday spirit!
B00APUYWYA|1.0|Let's face it. Oscar material it isn't,,,,but the vulgar humor took away any redeeming singing qualities.  It is predictiable and lacks any original thought.  I'drather pay for a new novel to read than put UPC with it a second time.  Better yet, don.t see it.  Save your money,
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I watched the first season and was intrigued. This continues the trend. Only watched the first 2 episodes and looking forward to the rest.
B003RNXIBK|2.0|Marshall Mathers is either going through something or he's falling off.  There may have been one or two tracks that got 4 out of 5 stars... the rest got 3 stars... and that was me being nice out of respect to one of the greatest lyricists to pick up a mic.<br /><br />The last 3 albums he's put out have been disappointing... he needs to stop being so angry and get back to having fun with his music.  I don't wanna hear about all this personal crap.
B009E3EY4M|5.0|Excellent
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Not saying I'm a pothead... but this movie is funny as hell!  I watched it with some friends and we all agreed... great movie!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|very good game. lots of fun. nice that its free, but when you have things that need acorns that is not cool. other than that it is fun
B007MDB6L0|4.0|Loved this movie, had to order it for my daughter for Christmas. I would recommend this for anyone with a young daughter who loves Disney.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|every time you think you know what's going on, you find out you have no idea. it's wonderful and keeps you going
B0049P1VHS|5.0|There is a reason this is a popular series. It is well written, well acted and directed. It is awesome and most people who watch it get hooked.
0061128562|1.0|The product details said this mini book came with a small plush mouse, it does not. But the book is a favorite from our childhood, so the mini book & cd are a nice addition to our daughters collection.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Its your basic dual shock 3 and hopefully this last a while before the joystick top starts to get lose. Just buy it when Amazon has a sale
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|The movie was good, but the sound was a problem for us. The background music/noise was louder than the dialogue, so with the heavy accents it was difficult to catch a lot of it.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Some of what happens is a little predictable, but the characters are so engaging, and the dialogue is great. I had trouble putting it down.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Because this is a great book.<br />I LIKED THE PART WHEN GREG COULD NOT FIND A DATE TO THE VALENTINE DANCE.<br />I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO MY FRIENDS
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I really like this movie, in my personal opinion the best movie of 2012, very recommended. If you like action and drama this is the movie
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It was recommend to me that I read this book by numerous people so I finally gave and I couldn't put it down!
B00992CF6W|2.0|that is a rip off becuose in chrismas not a low price so boo to this game every body it sucks. pepol
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved this book. Christian Grey's character is amazing. It was an easy read with a lot of good action.
B004FN7ZKG|5.0|truly wonderful music-  beautiful , i am not good at explaining myself verbally so  pleas listen to it yourself. some of the best jazz i have  heard in a long time.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have never been so determined to finish a book and find out what happens next. I read it in less than 24 hours. Amazingly sad and insightful.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Excellent CD and DVD set. Good quality recordings and the DVD looks and sounds amazing. Perfect for any Led Zeppelin fan.
B007MHVVCU|5.0|Great book! Very exciting. Anthony Horowitz is a great author. I love his books! Can't wait to read more! Woot
B004SEUJYG|5.0|As on old military man I was impressed with the film PATTON. I enjoyed the in depth look at general patton. A guy who got the job done.....
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a lot of fun games wrapped into one and it is all free! I rate this game five stars because I love it
B0064NTZ6W|5.0|The best movie ever done about submarine warfare. As an american a human look at the enemy. The common sailor suffered as we did.
B003KRJNBW|4.0|The Book of Eli:  On the edge of your seat kind of movie with a surprising twist.  Very good!  Thumbs up.
B0076DELIG|5.0|The Black Box.  Insight and empathy as the plot reveals with an unexpected twist.  Each role of the main character allows us to relate to current life, not only of police work, but that of parenting
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|Susan Boyle does a good job on all the songs and is assisted by Michael Crawford and Donny Osmond on a few. I think this is her fourth CD and it proves that she is definitely not a one-trick pony.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|Since based on a true story, the movie was interesting but predictable. It was decent entertainment for the price and the convenience.
0765316994|5.0|This is the first book by John Scalzi I ever read, but I now plan to read more!<br /><br />I got interested in the characters right from the book's first pages, which surprised me because the review snippets on the jacket talked mostly about how funny the book is. It is very funny, but the humor grows out of the characters and situations. Let me try to avoid spoilers here, because the plot surprises are fast and enjoyable, but I really appreciate the generous spirit of an author who obviously cares about his characters even when giving each one enough character flaws to create more depth than is usual in pop sci fiction.<br /><br />The premise of the book is a fantasy premise -- that the crew of a dangerous starship slowly realizes that they are living inside a basic-cable TV show. The patterns that arise from overlaying fiction with reality have been explored by quite a few funny writers -- Jasper Fforde's work, Purple Rose of Cairo, Galaxyquest, and others come to mind. Scalzi finds some fresh ideas to play with and juggles them well.<br /><br />Now let me award a few prizes to this book ...<br /><br />Favorite name for a killer alien: Ice shark<br />Favorite minor character: The Box<br />Sneakiest plot complication: Carnitas<br /><br />To enjoy this book, you don't have to be an episode-quoting Star Trek supernerd -- I'm not. And I don't know John Scalzi or anybody else connected with the book. I got it as a present for my birthday, I really liked it, and when I saw some other people critiqued it here I felt so indignant I sat down and wrote this review.<br /><br />I do have one complaint -- some parts of the book made me get teary-eyed and sniffly. And just at one such part, wouldn't you know somebody rang my doorbell! I blame you, John Scalzi, for my embarrassment. But other than that, I loved this book.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|Rented Pitch Perfect with wife. Funny movie and streaming was clean and crisp. No problems at all and good movie.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|wonderfully written,  a story of love, courage and caring,  full of life lessons. I especially enjoyed the concept of precepts that were brought into the story.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|Rented Ted with wife. Funny movie and streaming was clean and crisp. No problems at all and really good movie.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Okay film --  but it's not Bourne. Premise is similar and it ends with the possibility of another. Fast paced
B000GW8OAA|5.0|this was a gift and I think they have watched it many times. it came in the mail in great time.
B0059XTU1S|5.0|Let me start by saying that I'm a big Tolkien buff and that I went into this experience very apprehensive given the liberties Jackson took with the LOTR movies, that as a purist did not sit well with me. Why omit perfectly good material (old forrest, barrow downs, etc) and make up new material that is only introduced to make up an action beat and shake things up (Aragorns little Warg detour in the second movie as well as Frodos visit to Pelargrir come to mind) but I digress...<br /><br />Of course Jackson added material here as well, the difference is; it wasn't specifically already introduced by Tolkien differently (or if it was the changes were more forgivable and served the story better, I.e Azog as a villain) It's believable and it allowed Jackson creative freedom w/o interrupting the flow of the book. I.e. if a scene was described in the book the movie usually followed that fairly closely, the new material was introduced using the annals of the LOTR and only hinted in 'the hobbit', which in my opinion was a genius move to lift a fairly light hearted book into a somewhat darker and more interesting realm of middle earth (considering Tolkien wrote this before the LOTR as a story to read to his children and not as a prequel to LOTR per se).<br /><br />I found it to be a thoroughly enjoyable experience and for me the 3 hrs flew by ending a logical closure point at the Carrock. I watched it in HFR 3D and quite frankly I have no idea why professional critics knock this new format. The picture quality was amazing, the slight headache I usually experience after a long 3D movie was a no show and the experience was immersive, it felt like you lean out of your window and watch middle earth pass by below you, absolutely breathtaking and the visuals alone would be reason enough to watch it again.<br /><br />For me it was a rare true 5 star experience, that I'm planning on repeating in a few weeks...
B002GHHHP6|4.0|great oldy movie
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This set is an extraordinary group of films to get. The restoration is marvelous and the PQ is excellent on Blu-ray for all films. I will not go into a review of each film because it will have been done by so many others in different forums, but I will say this is a must have set.<br /><br />The supplements from the 2001 set release are all here and are in their original standard definition. The commentary by Coppola is also carried over (but it is never really exciting; though it can be interesting for a few minute details at times). The new extras for 2008 are all in high definition. Of the new extras, I really only found the featurette of \\"The Masterpiece That Almost Wasn't\\" and the featurette on the restoration process to be of any interest. The rest are throwaways, and some are damn silly at that.<br /><br />Still, a great set to own.
B00005JPO1|4.0|great movie
B000L212HC|4.0|I've just revisted The Prestige after a few years and I found it quite fascinating, knowing what I did from the previous viewing and incorporating that knowledge into this viewing.  It's one of those stories with layers upon layers that you strip away a bit at a tiime.  And it requires close attention because what you see at one moment will have resonance on at least one other occasion.  Like a classic magician's trick, director and co-author of the screenplay Christopher Nolan doesn't let you know what he has in his right hand while you are watching his left.<br /><br />The interplay between the rival magicians is at the heart of the film, but even though you've seen it once, when you go back and see it again with the information you think you know, you find other things you never noticed the first time.  I am certain the Nolans, in adapting the screenplay from a novel, must have felt themselves perplexed at time, like trying to make the pieces of several jigsaw puzzles all fit perfectly into one.<br /><br />Castingwise, it is nice to see Michael Caine together with Christian Bale (though Caine's scenes are mostly with Hugh Jackman) after Batman Begins.  Though the magicians start out working together, their completely different way of living is important to setting up most of the movie.  Both Jackman and Bale are interesting actors.  And watching  Scarlett Johansson...she is lovely, in a role that doesn't require much depth,but who cares?  (Sorry, I am as much a believer in feminism as anyone....but this is Scarlett Johansson we are are talking about.  She could stand still for 90 minutes and still be the best thing in any film.)<br /><br />Picture quality can get no better than what is on display here, a pure 5 out of 5.<br /><br />Audio quality is also excellent.<br /><br />The extras are rather short, but I guess it comes down to fear of showing too much in the way of behind-the-scenes without ruining important plot points.  Still, I'd liked to have gotten moreextras for a film like this.<br /><br />Very much recommended.
6305696071|5.0|I bought it for a gift. I think they really enjoy watching it. It was shipped in great time also.
B001JNNE64|5.0|It's been more than two decades since I have seen this Best Picture Oscar winner and in that time I had forgotten what a wonderful movie it is. It is surprising now to see Tom Hulce as Mozart get second billing (after F. Murray Abraham), as his is the showier role and that Abraham won the Oscar for Best Actor over him.<br /><br />The film looks absolutely stunning on Blu-ray high definition. The picture is sharp, the sound exceptional (as is befitting for a film dealing with music). The film also has a commentary track and an interesting documentary on the making of the movie (in standard definition).<br /><br />The Blu-ray disc (and a separate CD with about 60 minutes of selections of Mozart's music) are encased in a 36-page digibook.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
0545305497|5.0|I bought this for a gift . I think they really liked them. I recieved them in great time in the mail.
B000MV90IU|4.0|A classic of its kind from the 1960s.<br /><br />The picture quality suffers from too much soft focus, but audio is good.<br /><br />In the extras division, there is commentary by Peter Yates, as well as a good featurette from the time of filming that shows the making of the car chase (SD). Also in SD is the special bio feature Steve McQueen: The Essence of Cool.<br /><br />My favorite, though, is a new documentary in high definition on Movie Editing, featuring a look at a lot of film clips (and because they are in 1080p in this documentary, we can get a look at how they will look on Blu-ray). The documentary runs about 90 minutes.<br /><br />On the whole, I think this is worth definitely renting but not so sure I would recommend it for a purchase because of the PQ.
B00006IM9Q|5.0|Great songs. Brings back memories.Even my nephew likes it and he is very young. Very nice. Will keep ordering music.
B001ECQ6E2|5.0|I just finished watching this and let me say right off that this is a Blu-ray classic title to own. Quo Vadis was one of the major Biblical-oriented films that came before The Ten Commandments, Ben-Hur, The Robe, and others. And it was done magnificently. I've seen it many years before and also liked it, especially the supporting performance by Leo Genn and the music by Miklos Rozsa. This time, for the first time, I was accepting of Robert Taylor as the Roman Legion comander who seeks, at first, to add beautiful Christian Deborah Kerr to his many conquests, but soon falls in love with her. Before I always thought of him as too American movie starish, but his is a strong presence when it is needed. There is much to be said about this epic but it should be experienced.<br /><br />As to the picture quality, let me just say it has been beautifully restored and looks magnificent. The sound has a 1.0 audio track matching the original theatrical presentation, though it too has been restored. The original roadshow overture and exit music have been readded to the film for the first time in over 50 years.<br /><br />Among the special features is an interesting full-length audio commentary by film historia F.X. Feeney. There is also an interesting 45-minute documentary on the making of the film, plus two trailers.<br /><br />One of the things I'd like to mention about Blu-ray that is good for international viewers...with the extra room on these discs, this title has about 16 or so different language subtitle tracks (compared to only three on the DVD) and the Blu has audio tracks in English, French, Spanish (both Castillian and Latin), German, and Italian (while the DVD only has English and French).
B002ECN4P0|5.0|Loved every song. I`ve seen them in concert and was instantly drawn back to that time. I have the first greatest hits so this completes it.
B001LRJH0U|4.0|This is an adaption of one of Robert Parker's wonderful westerns, and as such, has great interaction between the two protagonists, Virgil and Everett as they take on the wicked rancher and other miscreants. Ed Harris, Viggo Mortensen, Jeremy Irons are believeable, Renee not so much.  I enjoyed the film but wouldn't stack it up with Outlaw Josey Wales, or the Unforgiven, etc.  However, good entertainment.
B005KR6NS6|4.0|This review is not to give you details about the film, although the film is wonderful and much can be said about it.  The purpose of this review is to warn buyers that this particular DVD does not contain subtitles.  I rented this movie about a decade ago (I believe it was on DVD), and it contained subtitles.  If you are not fluent in French and Spanish, then I would avoid buying this DVD.  Thankfully, I understand Spanish pretty well and can pick up a little French, but I missed quite a bit of the dialogue due to the fact that French was spoken in a good number of the scenes.  I still enjoyed the film without the subtitles, but for the price of the DVD, they should have been included.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|Taylor Swift's songs on the album are a good combination of fun and emotion.  Love listening to it in the car!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Great movie!!!! got it now. The FX are so great , it's funny and plenty of action from the beginning.
B006O3MU96|5.0|Game play:<br />This is a cute game and I don't own the original for my Kindle Fire so I am happy. As you jump you tilt the tablet and it guides the jumper from left to right across the screen make sure to land on a secure landing spot and you will keep going up. Land on a weak piece of ice and you will fall. You can try to land on ice pads that have a spring on them or a trampoline so you can jump higher. As you go up the landing pads below you disappear so don't miss a pad and expect to fall down and find one.<br /><br />Some ice platforms have a monster on them so avoid them too! They also move back and forth across the screen. You get less and less ice pads as you move up so practice your moving from side to side. You can shoot snow balls out of your nose and kill the monsters. Tap on the right of the screen and shoot right and up and tap on the left to shoot left and up. It is hard to aim and play at the same time! I love the rocket ride!<br /><br />Main screen:<br />* Play<br />* Scores - keeps your high scores<br />* Options - directional shooting on/off, about, sounds, snow, Facebook on/off, calibrate auto/manual and menu.<br />* Whatever you do, don't touch the monster!<br /><br />What I like:<br />The game is amazingly simple but fun. The graphics are cute and the special effects sounds are well done. This is a fun game and I enjoy playing it. It is a cute time waster and it is easy to learn and play.<br /><br />What I don't like:<br />This is really a fun game but there are a few issues. After every game you get a button to submit your score to Facebook. In addition the network access is open and collects your device ID. My only suggestion is to turn your WIFI off or set your parental controls to keep your children off of your Facebook account. You may have to set your device into airplane mode.<br /><br />Summary:<br />This is a very fun game and a great FAOTD. The graphics are cute and the game is fun and simple. It is a definite keeper and you should download it while it is free. This is a 5 star app.<br /><br />Size: The uncompressed size is 6.15 MB.<br />Permissions:<br />* Network communications - full internet access<br />* Phone calls - read Kindle state and identity<br />* System tools - prevent Kindle from sleeping<br />* Network communication - view network state<br />* Hardware controls - control vibratorownload it while it is free.

B00A6X9Z8E|5.0|Wanted several of Kelly's singles for my IPhone and found this album had all but her latest single. Best value and I found several others songs that I really liked too.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Was actually a pretty decent movie. its only real flaw was calling a remake. There are very little similarities to the original, and the similarities to the original are almost skipped over so fast you barely realize it. Great action, Decent story, im not a huge colin farrel fan but i tolerated him because it was an entertaining movie.
B001BKAEHW|4.0|I enjoy this album, although, the radio hits are the main ones I listen to off of it. John mayer is awesome!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|One persons garbage is another person's treasures, so I guess that's why I really like seeing what people consider garbage or a treasure. I have a fun time shopping mostly on it. I buy once inawhile, but not super often.
B0053TMP24|5.0|My wife and I have been helping our grandson with his AR reading requirements and have completed the entire series of these books.  The books were very enjoyable and easy to read.  He was able to get great scores on the test following each of the books.  I hope this series continues as we move onto to The Kane Chronicles series.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It has become a sortof pipeline for the place I work so I don't use it for anything, but social stuff. My sister owns a business so I can keep track of the bands that are playing at her restaurant and deaths and briths and announcements and stuff and thats about it.

B000ZLFALS|5.0|I don't like musicals and those things. But this movie is great, I love the beatles and I love the way the director carried the movie. Every actor did great by singing and performing.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I had this already on my IPhone and I really like it so I knew on a bigger screen would be great, so I was right. Thanks for the free app I like it alot.
B004SGWYVA|5.0|I really like anime and I never saw this until I was looking for new stuff on amazon. This blu-ray is great, the animation, the story and also if you are a fan of upskirts and breasts you will be amazed.
B009K45Y62|1.0|This was supposed to come with a Blu-ray disc,a Dvd disc,and a special features disc.Instead,it came with 2 special features discs that are the same disc and a dvd disc.It's missing the blu-ray disc. I can't have it repalced because its out of stock. Waste of money.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I love this game. whenever I am bored I come to it and expand my city.<br />you should definately get this app.

His live concert dvd's show dif/songs & takes u back to yr concert on some of same songs...love it!
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|I've seen the original movie and liked it, but this one surprised me. Without giving anything away, it's a different take on the original and it works. The fight scenes are great. How can you go wrong with Kate Beckinsale fighting Jessica Biel? You can't. Enjoy it for what it is, an action movie.
B000056HOZ|5.0|whew!!!  love this one!!  so cool to see him from then till 2000.  Would love to see more & up to & accounting for 2012...his Wrecking Ball tour was incredible..seen him in State College, pa. - Nov.-2012.  He has an incredible voice/new he was good but so shocked at concert...why?..his voice sounds even better live/& 3 & 1/2 hr show..non-stop...what energy/feeds off of his fans.  Loves performing/loves & believes every word he sings...good job on this vid.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Gadgets still there, but it doesn't make it too ridiculous! Hope they do a couple more, but I doubt it.
B003ICWTR4|5.0|As always, anything with Bruce Springsteen live in concert are excellent.  This man is amazing...can tell he loves singing, loves interacting with his fans/audience & gives his all in every concert--amazing!

As always, he shows his energy & give all to the fans performance.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great product, works well. If you are undecided, just try it.  You can calibrate the software to your device, and it will give you an accurate reading of battery power left.
B00APUQH0W|4.0|Missed it at the theater & finally caught this movie at home.  Enjoyed the movie after a slow start.  Warmed up to it really nice movie.<br /><br />My wife commented before the movie started about Eastwood: \\"He's an old man.\\"  Of course that he's an old man was part of the theme.  & some of his \\"I'm old\\" comments rang true for our parents & for us in a few more years.<br /><br />Keep making the movies Clint Eastwood!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I am very pleased with this application, and enjoy using it in my time away from home. I find it has a practical use which is mainly playing with practically anyone whom you may find on your travels. I would certainly recomend it to everyone who would like to play.
B0060D123K|1.0|If I would have read the reviews first I wouldn't have ordered it. When love is gone cut out of the movie it's one of the best scenes in the movie. guess I will get out the old vhs.wasted my money

B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Great movie. Amazon prim is the was to go. My husband really liked the convenience of amazon on the ps3.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I am Hooked and hope she will do many more CDs. Her voice is so very unique. By buying the CD you support Adele to do more music.  Also watch Adele on YOUTUBE may change you mind if you are not sure.
0671510991|4.0|The book presented a useful trip through diplomatic affairs over recent decades, and demonstrates a very effect writing style. I enjoyed reading the book, as obviously supportive as it was to the behavior of President Nixon during his presidency,
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|A classic and should be read by young adults and adults. A wonderful book that survives through the ages. Written beautifully.
B000094HMU|5.0|I know how great the performance was because I performed in the orchestra at the time.<br />The Zefferelli production was fantastic.
B008220AVW|5.0|Katy Perry is the greatest singer of our times ! Her DVD, Katy Perry The Movie: Part of Me shows Katy's human side in a big way! i knew some of the material presented, but I came away feeling I met the singer, herself.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I enjoy Kate Morton's expert weaving of events with her characters and it has a great plot twist!  It kept me guessing until the end!
B007D5DUBG|5.0|What can I say? Taylor Momsen and her band, The Pretty Reckless, really ROCK ! All the songs on this EP ( Hit Me Like A Man ) actually do !
B000HKW7E0|5.0|ONE OF MY FAVORITES.<br />FUNNY, LOVE ALL THE CHARACTERS. CHEVY CHASE IS SO BELIEVABLE. COUSIN EDDIE IS AHOOT. BEV DEANGELO IS YUMMY.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|An interesting story line with some quite difficult screens It can be played for sometime without being boring. Well-designed<br />Recommended<br /><br />..
B004SBQGHS|5.0|The free version does not work on the new Kindle HD so I got this paid version for only 99 cents and it is worth it. It plays and looks great on the new Kindle HD.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|One of the best movies ever. Believable, action , suspense. Most guys would do all this for their daughter..Love Liam Neeson
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I highly recommend this book!!!! It is a captivating book and one of the very few I wasn't bored enough to start skipping and scanning through. Dean  God wouldn't we all want a Dean. I think my heart broke for him as much as for the main character. And now I am going to do some scanning for another awesome read by Colleen because words can't began to express how impressed I am by her talent!
B001XCWPAM|5.0|What can I say? I bought the movies and it arrived in great condition, no issues and works as expected. No issues here!
B005OZE9SA|5.0|Having used this for a while it seems to me that the previous reviews about being difficult to set up and get working properly might have been written by individuals who are less-than-proficient with electronics and computer technology. I had very little problem getting this device set up and working on a number of different rigs ranging from xp 32bit - Win 7 64 (including a 64 bit Vista). Each time set up was easy (admittedly vista was a bit stubborn). In all fairness I consider myself pretty up to date and fluent in building/maintaining hardware/software.
B0072GPQNG|4.0|Our family liked the movie. We wanted to maintain it within our library I thought it was a fair price.
B00A0NOF7G|2.0|Didn't hold my interest.  I might try another one and see if it is any better. I liked the cover - real cute.
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|Our family liked the movie. We wanted to maintain it within our library I thought it was a fair price.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love having the facebook app on my kindle so I can access my messages and friends and post pictures while on the go
B00796E7CA|5.0|One of the masters of fantasy, anything that comes from his hand is worth reading.  If your interested the simarillion is a great book to read alongside this one, many of the stories in unfinished tales are continues in that book.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy the card game! It is a fun diversion but the ads that pop up before every game are annoying! I realize this is how you &#34;pay&#34; for the &#34;free&#34; games but, with what you are taking in on everything else, is this really necessary?
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Love this movie. Perfect for the whole family. Bought it for gifts for 2 other kids. Bright vivid colors keep kids and adults attention as well as great story line.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Grabbed me from the very first lines and kept my attention captured until the last cliff-hanging line! Couldn't put it down!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Let me start off by saying that the Slammed series is one of my all time faves!  That said, Colleen Hoover did it yet again.  She is such a brilliant writer.  Not only does she drag you into these character's lives but does it in a way that only she can.  I couldn't put it down!
B008Q7O6VS|5.0|The original recording is still great and the extra live recording is excellent.  If you are a fan the live recording is worth the price.  (Give your original studio copy to a friend.)
B008MEM24S|4.0|I loved the game, but it would constantly freeze my phone. I would have to take the entire thing apart and remove the battery to get it to work again. However I have the Samsung Galaxy S, so that may be the issue. It still didn't stop me from completing the game. It was a lot of fun. I would totally download it again even knowing that.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|I think I will make it a life goal to read all of Ken's books.  Like all his books,  Eye of the Needle transports you to the middle of the action, I just finished it and, whew, I'm exhausted!
B0025KVLRO|5.0|He is trying to  complete a nice collection,  He has several DVD's and trying to built a good Beatle collection!!
B005LAII62|5.0|Finally a movie that reaches all age groups. I enjoyed the plot and lesson. Found myself thinking back on my childhood and how cruel kids can be.Good movie to add to a family collection
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|It's easy to see why Jack Reacher novels have become so popular, eventually leading to the recent motion picture.  Lots of action featuring a man's man.
B001NT057K|5.0|This music never gets old and I never tire of hearing it. All the performaces are top and there is a timelessness to this musical even though it is very much a period piece.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book is  an amazing tale with a lot of character vs character and a little character vs self I would  rate this book five stars
B007VWEEQQ|2.0|Perhaps its the system, but the sound from both smartphones I tried is flatter than any other sound source (radio or media) as well as other vehicles using the same two phones.

0143122010|4.0|I've been a Steven Pinker fan for awhile.  He's one of those guys whose ideas are at the leading edge of knowledge, like Daniel Dennett, Richard Dawkins or the late Stephen Jay Gould - just brilliant thinkers.<br /><br />The idea behind this book is that violence has declined in the modern era.  Dr. Pinker claims that people think that violence is at higher levels than ever before.  I don't know who gave him that idea, it was a no-brainer for me.  I never once thought fondly about how it would have been to have lived during the wonderful old days of, say, the 13th century.  If asked I'd have said that violence has decreased from historical levels without hesitation.  Maybe that's because I have read some history and have come across Tuchman's Law.  Regardless, I was along for the ride to hear Pinker's thoughts.<br /><br />The first half of the book was a rambling effort to shock us with graphic examples of historical violence.  This tour of historical atrocities didn't go anywhere.  Objectively, Pinker was presenting the idea that violence has declined in this section, but since I was already on board with that idea and didn't need convincing, the book lagged badly for me.  There were a number of unconvincing studies to show the author's point (a hundred students who did or said such and such).  It was simply a catalog of inhumanity.  Even worse, it seemed endless.  About a third of the way through, I started calling him 'Pinker the Interminable' and almost put the book aside.  But, there was one idea that redeemed the whole first half of the book and allowed me to put Pinker back up on his pedestal; the idea that the historical event that had the biggest impact on lowering violence was literacy.  I hit my head with my hand and said \\"Of Course!\\"  Think about it: reading puts us into another person's head - it's a huge advancement in learning empathy.<br /><br />The second half of the book was very enjoyable and interesting.  In this section, he covers historical and modern violence in a very organized way, addressing all the usual victims, one by one: human sacrifice, the inquisition, witch-burning, women, Jews, children and infanticide, homosexuals, etc.  The one remaining eye-opener was how perpetrators of violence ALL think they had excellent and justifiable reasons for what they did.  Whether they're child molesters or rapists or Nazis or the early religions or serial killers, they all justify their actions and think they did it for the common good - or at the very least should be excused from going to jail because their moms didn't love them enough.  On the other hand, when violence is done to us, we invariable see it as an unparalleled atrocity done by the truly evil.  I'm not explaining that as well as Pinker does.<br /><br />In the end, it was a rewarding reading experience and well worth my time.  I suspect many of the poor reviews were people who gave up in that first half.<br /><br />A week and a half later:  I have to say it left a lasting impression on me that will color my thinking for a long time.  At the time, it wasn't pleasant to hear how truly and wretchedly horrible people have been to each other, but in the aftermath it has been a game changer or maybe paradigm changer for me.  I realize his graphic examples of historic violence have actually changed my view of my species.  The book has had a bigger impact on my than I realized.<br /><br />Btw, Pinker gave a TED talk on this book. If you're interested, just google 'TED talks' and then type Pinker's name in the search box on the site.  Amazon won't let us publish links.<br /><br />Addendum: I realized there's a flaw in Pinker's thesis that literacy taught people empathy.  Women, who weren't allowed to become literate were still, in centuries past, considered the \\"gentle\\" sex and we have a thousand historical documents and paintings and songs who characterized these illiterate women as nurturers or gentle beings.  I don't think that dog will run after consideration.eration.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I am a die-hard fan of the series Firefly. I watched every episode when it ran on TV and purchased the DVD set. So you can imagine my excitement when I discovered that they were making a movie. I am pleased that they didn’t cheapen the sets and just try to capitalize on the fan base to make a profit. Instead the ship and crew all looked the same as in the series and had the same spark/chemistry between each other. I really liked the movie.<br /><br />Don’t worry about getting lost in the show’s history if you never watched the series. They did a quick rehash of where the doctor and River came from etc. to get you up to speed on the story-line.<br /><br />If you want to be entertained, watch the movie and all of the out-takes and commentary that comes with it.
1478230096|1.0|I had to refund the kindle edition because there was no table of contents to go from one section to another. The features were exceptional but the kindle edition is not at all practical without the access of the table of contents.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This is the first Jack Reacher book I've read and I'm hooked!  A special note.....the Jack Reacher movie has just been released and I will NOT be seeing it.  I definately don't want my mental image of Jack ruined by Hollywood.  This is a must read!

0316069434|1.0|How can anyone compare this guy to John Sandford? I had to put this stinkburger out of its misery<br />after 150 pages. He should have titled it \\"The Black Bore.\\" What a snoozer. Nothing drives the story. It moves like<br />an instruction manual for assembling cheap furniture. And the stereotypes Connelly uses to portray the black corner drug<br />gang members is laughable to the point of insulting. The stereotypes are dreadful. Has he ever talked to anyone like that? Maybe he<br />should watch a few episodes of \\"The Wire\\" to catch a whiff of reality.<br />  This really blew big time.<br />  If you're trying to decide between a prostate exam and reading this book, do the exam. At least<br />it'll get your attention!
B006CQLGXG|5.0|Who does not know the story? This is my fourth time through A Christmas Carol and each time reveals something new. I am currently in the midst of reading God and Charles Dickens: Recovering the Christian Voice of a Classic Author by Gary Colledge, and this time through the Christian references were much more poignant. The illustrations in this edition were a very nice addition, and it is nice to see a standard Kindle edition with them. The book would always get 5 stars, and the Kindle version does as well.

B00466HN6S|5.0|We ordered this movie for our 3 year old. She kept asking us to rent it from Redbox or check it out from the library, so we knew it would be perfect!  We received it in the mail two days after placing the order and it was in perfect condition. We are extremely happy with this purchase and would work with this seller again.  Thanks for helping make our daughter's Christmas perfect.
034580404X|2.0|Unfortunately i bought the trilogy, the contents of which could have been written in one book, as the scenes are exhaustingly repetitive, and the same expressions and phrases are used throughout. So much so, that I found myself skipping through 20 + pages at a time to try and find the next part of the story line.<br />The writing style is poor, enhanced only by incorporating the use of intelligent words which are not used in the conversation of the average 'Joe'.<br />I am not inclined to give up on a bad book, always hoping for improvement as the story progresses, but I could not continue ploughing through this trilogy to the end. Disappointing, considering thatbthe book got an overview on Carte Blanche.

B00653FC2W|2.0|I can appreciate homage, especially to an icon like Michael Jackson. He was always, and still is, my number-one favorite song artist and performer. But I might turn down even a free ticket to see other people perform medleys of his songs, as talented as those people may be. That makes Cirque Du Soleil's Immortal World Tour; a stage show that sends dozens of dancers, acrobats, mimes, etcetera, around the globe to do just that; more of a negative than a positive. But hey, at-least they're not singing. Apparently director Jamie King had sense enough to leave that part up to the icon himself, which makes listening to this soundtrack album more tolerable than it probably should be.<br /><br />What it presents, rather bombastically, are original Michael Jackson songs snipped apart and blended together to form what may as well be a glorified mixtape. The main difference and one positive thing the album has going for it is that many, if not most, of the songs are mixed in a way that would be impossible for the average DJ. Producer Kevin Antunes was given access to the actual individual track recordings of these songs. That allows him to make full-on remixes, shuffle vocals from one song to another and resurrect studio outtakes that weren't included in the original album versions.<br /><br />It makes for an interesting, and sometimes surprisingly enjoyable, listen for those of us who are fanny enough to notice the often subtle differences. What ruins it is the conceptual context in which it's presented, of which there seems to be none. The album, which puts Working Day And Night not after but before the \\"Intro\\" and teams Speechless with Human Nature, goes from song to song, and sometimes back to song, seemingly at random. So even though this new-age version of Wanna Be Startin Somethin sounds funky, it does nothing to cover that massive and ultimately dooming artistic flaw.<br /><br />If this were a general music review, context snontext, or maybe even the DJ's setlist at a Michael Jackson party, I'd be inclined to praise it. After all, one of my top-two favorite Michael Jackson songs of all time, Is It Scary, is included in the mix. And it runs dead into Threatened, which serves as a notable plug for Michael Jackson's final and massively underrated Invincible album. My main gripe with Michael Jackson compilations in general is that they tend to overlook his newer songs. But as an album, a decision I'm willing to bet had a lot more to do with making money than creating art, this Immortal one stumbles and falls flat on its face.<br /><br />marcellee.comMichael Jackson party, I'd be inclined to praise it.

0345803485|2.0|I started reading it to see what all the hype was about...didn't finish. The book is alright, if you have nothing to compare it to and it's your first experience with an \\"erotic-like\\" novel. However, its a bit predictable and repetitive. Compared to a Zane novel, it's poorly-written cotton candy. That being said, it has introduced a lot of prudes to the genre, so I guess its served a purpose.
B005LAJ23A|4.0|Impressive portrayal of human reactions after a major disaster.  Strong writing, persuasive acting, admirable attention to detail, no loose ends, suspense sustained without gimmicks.  Congratulations to all parties concerned.

1401940676|5.0|Anita Moorjani's story is amazing, inspiring and worth the price of this book or CD.  Anita's non-Christian perspective on the NDE is refreshing.  Anita had a miraculous recovery from terminal cancer.  She visited the post-death realm and experienced the bliss, insight, love and understanding of that realm.  She had a documented, clinical near-death and then a full recovery from cancer.  Her perspective from a non-Christian background adds interest and depth to her story.  Her description and interpretation of the experience are unique, vivid and detailed.  This is a must-read NDE account.  Buy the book or CD!<br /><br />Beyond the NDE account, it appears that Anita is heading down the path of selling out to the commercialized spiritual snake oil movement.  Baffling as it is, Anita placed as much emphasis on the events that led to the publication of her book as on her NDE itself.  In her account, she seemed as comforted and validated by the book publication as by her actual NDE experience.  Anita's NDE may be evolving into seed material for commercialization by spiritual gurus, like her hero Wayne Dyer.  The gurus are looking to hitch their snake oil wagons to Anita so they can cash in on her popularity.  They are seeking to \\"allow\\" universal streams of money and wealth to flow to them from their naive, sheep-like spiritual seekers.  Sadly, it appears that Anita is heading down the path with those who prey on naive seekers of the secrets of the universe, NDE testimonials and spiritual insights.<br /><br />A clue about this direction is Wayne Dyer's glowing preface promoting himself as the \\"snycronistic\\" miraculous discoverer of Anita and her story.  She already had a manuscript of her NDE story before she met Dyer. The manuscript was out and she was writing her book and seeking a publisher.  Dyer attempts to take credit for her book... \\"I invited her to write about her NDE\\".  Dyer is a self-promoting spiritual guru making money from his sheeple masses.  He has now hitched his snake oil wagon to Anita to attract more funds from innocents seeking truth and spiritual insight.<br /><br />After completing Anita's story, I went to the AnitaMoorjani.com website.  Anita is charging $100 plus for her seminars and she is networked with Wayne Dyer and other spiritual & regression \\"gurus\\" who want to leverage her story in their seminars and workshops - of course for a substantial fee.<br /><br />The book or CD is definitely worth the purchase.  It is an amazing story.  I'm stopping there... and I hope I'm wrong.  Maybe Anita isn't selling out to the commercialized spiritual evangelist movement - it just looks that way to me.
B0098VXBIA|3.0|It was cute, but I found myself doing other things while the movie was on, it it's necessary to pay close attention it goes pretty quick.  Elizabeth Banks was great.
B00447G29S|5.0|This movie was incredible all the way around.  The story will make you feel like a kid again, it was very well put together.  Most of the reviews here capture the magic of the story so I won't so more than it is a great movie.<br /><br />As for the 3D/Audio/Visual - simply stunning.  This movie was made to be seen in 3D.  I couldn't imagine seeing it any other way. Probably the best overall 3D effects I've seen in a movie, the action was non stop!  The audio was also great, i only have a 2.1 setup but when the train pulled up i felt like it was in my living room!<br /><br />The audio overall was good, great use of music and sound effects.<br /><br />I highly recommend everyone own a copy of this movie, and if your tv is 3D compatible, it should be a no brainer to get the 3D version.

B007FG9LIE|4.0|As the title suggests, I found this book to be better than expected. For a Kindle Daily Deal book, I wasn't thinking this would be anything all that gripping. But it was a real page-turner - I mean, 'next page button pusher.' I kept wondering what the twist - and it's a good one - was but I didn't get it. This was well worth the price.

B0076DELIG|3.0|I am a big fan of Michael Connelly and have read all of the Harry Bosch novels; I always eagerly await a new release, and this time was no different.  I like that Harry is a bit of a rebel against the LAPD and some of the ways he solves his crimes.  However in this one, it just became downright unbelievable.  I enjoyed the story, don't get me wrong, but without giving anything away, his unorthodox ways of putting the final pieces of the crime together went from intriguing to eye roll inducing.  I still liked the book and wouldn't not recommend it, but the end made me feel like telling Connelly to come back to earth.  I'm all for suspending disbelief in a fictional novel but this took it just a step too far.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|This could have been a very funny movie but relied on crude sexual innuendos to make a story line. I was looking for something light and funny instead I was bought down.

B00APUQPX6|4.0|We have all the Ice Age Movies and love them . If you like animated movies buy this one for the whole family.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This is one of the greatest shows on tv! I'm a huge fan of the show,  and it only keeps getting better.
B003VANOFY|4.0|suits my gaming needs greatly.  Wireless, so gives me a chance to grab a bite to eat or something to drink without the hassle of taking it off.  There's no bulky cords laying around that I could rip out and break by accident.<br /><br />My only concerns are there are a lot of moving parts, which any one of them could potentially break.  Though this is not a big deal since Logitec has a wonderful warranty.<br /><br />My other concern is the charging port on the headset.  I have to practically force the micro-usb into the port so it will charge, and I'm afraid every time I do this, I may potentially crack the port, or dislodge it from the circuit board inside.  Still not a huge deal cause of Logitec's warranty.<br /><br />Software that comes with it is very decent.  Allows voice masking, different volume controls, and you can bind the buttons to almost anything that's mainstream like ventrilo & Itunes (forgot if it can interact with Pandora.)  Battery lasts me 8 to 10 hours on a single charge too.<br /><br />Overall, I'm happy for this investment.
B00A9X9VAI|4.0|Pretty good movie, not a large amount of action but good story line and a pretty predictable ending. Would watch it again and recommend it to a friend.
B005IQ39AY|3.0|This game is a little difficult to understand as the instructions are vague and the game is not &#34;user -friendly&#34;
B000ID37KO|4.0|we rented the birds, for my daughter that had a project in school. she had to watch the movie and right down certain parts of the movie.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Kindle is a great way to have a large library in a small space. I always have the book I want with my reader or with my I phone.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|Some good acting, some less than plausible dialogue, fair amount of filler to get 45 minute segments.  Plot half believable.
0425218929|5.0|I love Patricia Cornwell's books especially the Scarpetta Series.  I have purchased all that she has written up to 2010
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I enjoy having this on my kindle.  When you get reading you need something to remind you to eat or sleep.  Nice big face, handy alarm.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|I like to rent movies in Amazon it is a very good quality and a lot of movie but I don't like this movie in particular
B004LROUNG|5.0|Typical Grisham; the action, suspense are gripping but also a little creepy to think how corrupt our courts could be...
B00AHSMDQY|1.0|This is the worst Batman movie, to date. Long, slow and predictable storyline Anne Hathaway's performance as Catwoman is wooden and stilted. I'm so glad I rented this, instead of throwing away my money on a DVD purchase.<br /><br />What a snoozer!
B003B02O14|5.0|Love the way this one starts and had a hard time thinking it could really go anywhere when the key 'role' wasn't looking like he'd be practicing law again... but it all changed, quickly, and was another great-Grisham.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|We all want and wish for the happy endings in life but when truth sets in we know that happy endings don't exist...... I really wished for survival but that wouldn't make a true story..... an awesome ending to as truly well written series.....A MUST READ
B007SGM084|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It's been a while since I've read something I couldn't put down. I chuckled over the \\"mommy porn\\" comments by the obvious uptight people out there....come on it's 2012, do we really want a Ward and June Cleaver romance novel?...not me. I just hope your next book can compare to this one.  BRAVO!
034580404X|5.0|I can't wait to start reading this trilogy. The price for the set saved me a lot of money compared to if I had bought them seperately.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|This is a must-have for all Sarah McLachlan fans!  Sarah has an awesome voice, and this CD is a great addition!
B000DN6ZGC|5.0|Not my cup of tea, but overall not bad. I'm not very Hip- Hoppy. The Who, The Beatles, The Cars, The Stones...Now  you're Talking!
076115728X|5.0|This book is so great.  I read it to my kindergartners and then to the first graders.  We love it.  I hope that it helps the kids to remember not to throw away their &#34;mistakes&#34;.
B007N8RULO|5.0|This game is so addictive. I play it all the time. you should try it. It's better than the others.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|I enjoyed the different take on a classic fairy tale. It was well acted. Charlize Theron was excellent as the evil stepmother, and the huntsman was a fun twist. Overall an entertaining movie.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Ok, liked the liv and Ethan storyline a lot. Some parts were a little too whiney for me but I imagine it'll get better in next book once main characters are together again.
B00992CF6W|3.0|in creative mode you don't get flint and steal so you cant use dynamite.2nd you don't get buckets in either mode. its rare to find caves and the map is small. also you don't get boats or armour. if the fix these problems I will change my rating.
B005RDF2RG|5.0|The Shrek which started it all is an imaginative unique look at Fairy Land. Quality of the old Bugs Bunnies where there is LOTS for even very little kids but inside jokes to keep the adults entertained - some of which will go swooping over even today's jaded kids.
B00AB0AXU6|2.0|Thank goodness I spent little more than a buck to rent it, cuz thats about all its worth!<br /><br />Redundant characters and weak plot .. not so scary creatures...  parallels\\"Alien\\" on many counts, such as \\"Small girl gets rescued from monster by kick ass mom figure who risks her life to retrieve said child from sticky Cocoon\\" SS Zombies, Giant Ogres with burlap bags for heads( saved a lot on the FX there)<br />Dont pay more than a r** box rental for this one! A complete Disappointment in my opinion!
B008476HBM|5.0|Love the book &#34;Pride and Prejudice.&#34; The digital copy for my Kindle makes it perfect for transportation and easy access.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|i have this game on my kindle and id say its one of the best games i have for the kindle. i havent had any problems with it yet. it resembles temple run but i believe its better. fun game
B004VB3UYW|4.0|This book has turned out to be useful reference and survey of R's capabilities.  It could be used as a starting point for an experienced programmer, or as a supplemental reference with an introductory book for a beginner.
B008GXHOFW|3.0|this game is good but its certainly not the best. i own the kindle fire version an though the graphics are pretty decent for it the gameplay needs work webbing around the city can be kind of tricky and all enemies iv fought so far are super easy. its also pretty glitchy and the voice for spiderman is really corny. i got it for 99 cent though so for that price id say grab it
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I was interested in reading this book but decided I should start at the beginning, so I purchased Fall of Giants first.  I could not put it down.  I was excited to know that Winter of the World would be next.  I was not disappointed.  These are two of the best books I have read.  The characters are extremely interesting and the history lesson is truly informative.  Both books are not to be missed!
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|If you like Seth McFarlane's humor, then this is a movie for you. A ton of laughs and biting humor. Can't wait for the sequel!!!
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|I liked the movie alot, & the actors are great. The plot is differrent than the first movie, good job.

B007T2XC7A|1.0|I made the mistake of ordering without auditioning because of the artist and the promotional price. Big mistake (if on a small scale). Apparently even the purest of talents can be exploited and misled in producing trash.
B004EPYZT4|5.0|A good movie to have and to add to ur movie library. So you can have movie night any time.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Stunning and beautifully written!  The plot twists are astounding, the characters are lovable in their humanity and this book stays with you and captures your heart.  Harold Fry is a triumph!  Bravo!

0810994739|5.0|My son has a kindle and getting the books for him enables him to carry, but not loose or break the books. He reads my excerpts from the books, but I have never read any of them.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Although the story is fiction, it is the first true account i've found of what German children had to deal with at that time. There were many things going on during Hitler's time, and I find many stories parallel what my older relatives at that time went thru that was never covered in history class. Ration cards, what happened to Jewish people the knew, the foster care system, how hungry the children went, how people got by, the employment situation, the respect people had, joining or not joining the Nazi party, and too many more to mention. It truly shows the lifestyle under Hitler for the common German citizen. An easy read, and simple vocabulary with German words throughout that are easily translated, but as a person who enjoys a heavy read I find it a page turner.
1423140591|5.0|My son loves these books. He is reading them for the second time now. He loves the story of Percy Jackson so naturally I thought he'd love these and he is.
B009K0P10K|4.0|I love this show!  The drama and intrigue is great!  It is a little bit sleazier than I'm comfortable with, but the story is engaging enough that I keep watching.
0810993139|5.0|My son has a kindle and getting the books for him enables him to carry, but not loose or break the books. He reads my excerpts from the books, but I have never read any of them.
B008NEMN0K|2.0|The 3d effects were not as expected. Movie wasn't made in 3d likely reason. Not a bad movie in general.
142311339X|5.0|The quality and timely arrival was wonderful. My son loves the books. He has read them all and is reading them again.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book<br />It was one of the best books I have read and did not stop until I read all of them
B005IQZB14|5.0|I love this book. I'm an ultra runner and the solitude and iSight speaks to my soul. I'm glad I bought it and didn't just borrow if from the library.
B004EPYZPS|5.0|This is a wonderful movie that captures that 'old school' sci-fi feel. Spielberg really hit the nail on the head with this.
1419705849|5.0|My son has a kindle and getting the books for him enables him to carry, but not loose or break the books. He reads my excerpts from the books, but I have never read any of them.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|My father loved watching these movies as a kid at the drive in and is excited every time I find another on DVD for him. Shipping was very fast and all DVD's in condition promised. Very pleased.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Does what it's supposed to do. Works just fine, easy to access and use. Why do I have to use more worrds to describe a perfect App?
B00AB0AXU6|4.0|I am sucker for strong women. This fits the bill. I also like Mila Jovovich She has managed to age well.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It only connects you to your wall, and not able to look at your Home page for ehat has been posted by others.<br />Please correct this!
B00475AYJQ|5.0|It is a wonderful book. Great characters, great plot, and wonderful lyrical writing. It was Highly recommended to me and I do the say for you.
034580404X|5.0|I don't know what all the talk is about with these books.  They are very well written and keep you in suspense to see what is going to happen next.  Everything is written very tastefully.  Great work E. L. James.<br /><br />Have given to some of my friends for gifts.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm a middle age woman , who loves loves loves these books. They're an instant classic. Amazing books. Not just for teenagers.
B004LWZWGK|3.0|The movie is amazing.  Love the DVD and bluray.  I usually buy digital copies so I can watch movies on my iPhone but the ultraviolet copy is streamed from online from a third party company, meaning you don't really own it or have it.  You don't get a \\"copy\\" but rights to an online streaming service for this one film.  Feel a bit ripped off on that point.  If I want an actual digital copy ill have to buy it separately.  Plus I have to pay Verizon for streaming the movie to my phone if I take the ultraviolet route.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love love love love this book. Great build up to the Mockingjay. Can't wait for the movie.  Thanks Ms. Collins.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|This is a great Christmas album -- an unusual rendition from Rod Stewart as always.  I wish I had purchased more for gifts especially at the price I paid
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This in my opinion is the best of the series. It's a very raw and real. I wish Ms. Collins would write more of these books.
B00AE2I4B6|5.0|Story line is a bit cheesy. But I really wanted to see the dancing and that did not disappoint at all
B00005J79J|5.0|love her voice.  it's like an angel.  she's  beautiful to look at and beautiful to listen to.  don't forget to add to your sarah brightman collection.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed reading this book,s real page turner.<br />More importantly it sheds light on the zero tolerance of RICCO and the Rockefeller, mandatory time statutes.  We seem to have forgotten, if indeed we ever knew, the definition of rehabilitate is to \\"invest in again with dignity\\"
B000001AFY|5.0|always loved this Lp and it is great to have it as a cd.  i  am a big diana ross fan and i was so happy to add this to my diana ross cd collection.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|I'm a fan of the Batman movies, but this one didn't blow me away.  In terms of streaming, I had no problems watching it live through Amazon with my Roku device.
B00005OB0E|5.0|always love getting a diana ross cd for my collection.  great for singing along to.  miss ross does it again.
1449410243|4.0|This book is hilarious!  I bought it and took it to Thanksgiving for my family to enjoy.  Everyone got a kick out of it!
B00008NRI7|4.0|This was a good movie. I would buy it again. It arrived sooner than I thought and was in great shape.
B009PMB3CI|4.0|It was boring at first but I like I  now so that must mean Daaa daaa daaa it's a good game
0060245867|5.0|Such a great book. I read it in the library, and had to have it for my granddaughter. It covers so much about &#34;Give 'em an inch and they'll take a mile&#34; concept. Can't wait to read it to my granddaughter.
B007SGM084|5.0|fell in love with 50 right away, despite his alternate lifestyle.  love the happily ever after story, female character can get a little testy now and then with her low self esteem but that's how it's written...
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Great pixar film full of action and humor. Great kids film and fun for adults. Big ups for showing how a woman can out shoot all the boys in the yard.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|not too short, not too long, great story to follow, main female character is respectable and not annoying.  definitely recommend
B009GEAPYW|4.0|If you like your Batman old and cranky, this film is a treat. Frank Miller has a funny way of writing about Batman, making him more tortured and campy. Its a fun combination.
B0015AARJI|5.0|We needed a second controler but the prices were so high we held off. When i saw this price i grabbed it. We prefer the sony over off brands they just work a lot better and are comfortable in your hands plus the buttons are easy to get to.
B001AG52AG|4.0|This movie is a bit dark and violent, which is surprising because it was not advertised that way. I would of liked to see this series expanded on more as seems like its based on a good book series as well.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This book allows the reader to catch up with the characters missing in book four and brings a new twist to the story line, filling the void left after finishing book four.  Again the books ending leaves you waiting for book six to come out.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|Some of this is a bit corny, but thats how we like our fantasy/political/social commentary movies about incest, monsters and medieval magic. If you notice, they always introduce a new female character with a nude scene. I think thats in HBO's contract or something. Besides that silliness, this series really shows off great story writing/telling along with great acting from a wide cast of characters.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Great book.  800 pages really worth the purchase.  No more than one or two pages of lag in entire book!  Difficult to put down and eager anticipation to pick back up.  On of \\"his\\" best books!
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|What if your best friend was a magic teddy bear? This movie explores that particular angle with comedy, from the mind that brought you Family Guy. In fact you might see (or hear) most of the cast from Family Guy in this film. Patrick Stewart's narration is worth the price of admission alone.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have this for any note taking situation, except of course for school note taking. This is great for journal keeping. And one of the great thing is that it syncs across  all my devices.  (Android, kindle fire) I highly recommend this app.
B007FH9GA6|3.0|Still an interesting movie, but the actors really don't feel like they are telling a story as much as they are reading a script and dialing it in.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is the definitive Christmas DVD all about Christmas and all the relatives and family coming once a year! LOL
B00APUYWYA|5.0|great fun and singing - no worries about plot or evil surprises, when you need some easy entertainment at the end of a bad day
B000VUQ4HW|2.0|This film was okay. I did not realize that it was not a talky,but that was okay. I should have realized that it wasn't a talky, that was my fault. It will go good with my collection.
B00454U1NS|5.0|Fans of Pink will love this compilation due to having all her hits on one CD.  Buy it and enjoy.
0761163808|5.0|This book is so cool!  I bought this for my niece for Christmas.  She absolutely loved, but now I&#34;m thinking of getting one for myself!
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I was surprised while listening to this CD as I had forgotten just how many top hits Kelly had over the years.  Great Cd for casual fans.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Not quite like on the PC, but you've successfully added my favorite game to my favorite device. The only thing I'd complain about is the lack of nether (unless I'm doing it wrong and have to use the nether cores) other than that this game is fun, challenging and an all around great experience :)
B000002UWE|4.0|I guess my memory is fading.  I thought Talk Talk had more top ten hits in the eighties than they actually did.  Still, this CD includes all their hits and a few surprises as well.
B00005TQKQ|5.0|Delivered as described. Thought it was my cam cord it was having issues, none of the tapes were playing. Just gave it a 15 sec run. picture and sound perfect. Would definitely buy again.
B000EQH2QK|3.0|I should have looked at the tracks closer before ordering.  Did not have all Shakira's hits that I thought it did.  My mistake.
B00A757EFW|3.0|My daughter downloaded pack-man-lite and I am not to thrilled.  It's a bit slow for me which means I do not last to long because of the slow speed.  My daughter enjoys it.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|I found this collection very entertaining. I enjoyed having it to look forward to at the end of the day. The story is an interesting take on the post-apocolyptic theme and the reader discovers the back story along with the characters (though, the books are not without many, somewhat obvious, hints along the road). The chapters (and books) end at points that might seem to wrap things up but still leave the reader wanting more. That's why I kept going back for more. And luckily, the story ended how I wanted it to end, allowing me to give a final sigh of relief.<br /><br />There are only two negative points I have, and they are about the writing style. I found the writing descriptive without being overly detailed or flowery, which is good. However many points were repeated within and between chapters making me think, &#34;OK, I've got it, you want us to pay attention to this.&#34; Personally, I prefer a little ambiguity, even misdirection, in the books I read. Second, the dialogue and actions of characters presented them flatly. Nearly everyone spoke within one another in the same manner even if there were supposed to be stark power asymmetries between them. The homogeneity in words and actions made the characters seem fairly homogeneous and bland. It's the scenarios that entrap the characters that are most interesting here.<br /><br />All in all, I found this a really entertaining read that is worth the price.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|If you're looking for a challenge flow free will help you with that.  My daughter introduced me to it.  I said to her how hard can it be, but it proved me that I need to think before making that move.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|PG-13? - Over the edge - Basically Porn - Should be rated R<br />This movie is totally inappropriate for children/teenagers of any age.<br /><br />It also misses the point.  One of the main purposes of sex within marriage (between a man and a woman) is to communicate love, acceptance, safety, and security to a deeper level.  If sex within marriage degrades either the man or the woman, it is defeating the purpose and the person feels used by the other.<br /><br />I am glad they talk about their needs.  This is healthy.  I am also glad they take the chance to open up and re-kindle their romance.  Romance is great and more than just the sex.  I am also glad they are married in this movie.  Study after Study documents that sex outside of Marriage leads to many downstream problems as well as decreased satisfaction with sex within Marriage later.<br /><br />I rated it 2 stars (I don't like it) because it does have a couple of redeeming features but overall, I wish I hadn't watched it.<br />I should have looked at pluggedinonline.com at the review first.<br /><br />Written by D. Skidmore (husband of C. Skidmore)
B0063IH60K|4.0|When your bored solitaire will definetly will keep you busy.  I enjoy it very much.  Whenever I'm bored and take out my kindle fire and play solitaire.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|Love This film, the music is catchy, Meryl Streep is a fabulous actress.  The story line is light and just pleasant to watch.  A film for the whole family to enjoy.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|This was so boring.....at least make it fun...or a little interesting!!! **GRRR!! ° ~° make it fun!! U jerk faces!! Thanks for boring me 2 death
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is soooooooo fun to play and u can challenge yourself when the game gets increasingly faster. I'm telling u 2 get this game u wont be disappointed.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|It shows about 10 posts, then a few that look like text and that's as far back as it will show.  Useless.
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|All the above. The interface is simple and the results sound good. The scoring motivates you to improve and even if you only have a couple minutes, you can enjoy.
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|To be succinct, let me just say I didn't expect this movie to be as long as it was. And to have more Batman.<br />At about halfway through the movie, I paused it to go to the bathroom, already a little bored but thinking he were just about to get to the final big showdown. No sir! We still had about 15 plot twists to go, and more than an hour and a half. Things went downhill from there, too, with a lot of the plot making little sense. Only in the last ten minutes or so did I feel the movie take off, but the build up to that small payoff just wasn't worth it.
B007C7UZIG|4.0|I like the Steam Mobile app, it is simple and lets me keep an eye on new deals on the go, which is especially helpful during their holiday sales when they have flash sales that only last a limited time.
B004A8ZWWY|2.0|I'd give the movie 2 1/2 stars.  The first half is really boring.  The second half is better and I thought the actural theft was interesting.  I think this is one of those movies that is good as a rental, one time, but is a waste of money as a purchase. I think the movie is to long so it just plods along. As an Action/Comedy it misses the mark, there isn't a lot of action and it isn't all that funny.
B00ANW33CM|3.0|I like to not be rushed when doing this type of game.  I can only finish a few levels before I am not able to continue to the next level because I am too slow. I like the three dementional aspect for a more challenging type of mahjong.
B005LAIHSQ|1.0|Don't let the trailers fool you, if you saw the trailers you've seen the best parts of the movie.  The special effects are ok but the acting is mundane.  The movie could have been good but just missed the mark.  Don't make the mistake of purchasing this blu ray it is a waste of money.  I wouldn't recommend renting it as that is a waste of money too.  Just wait for it to come to television because at least then the commercials will add enjoyment to the viewing experience.
B004YM6JK0|5.0|got here really fast and just like it was described in the add.  no problems with this product i loved it
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Not as good as the previous ones! I guess the bar set by the previous ones was to high! This one couldn't reach that bar!

B009HEJXFS|5.0|High art this isn't (nor was it intended to be...)... it's a summer comedy...<br /><br />MIB3 is a good sequel because it carries on the unique and enjoyable interaction between K and J, a few throwbacks to the previous chapters, and adds some fun new twists.  I did, however, miss Frank, the talking Pug...<br /><br />One of the new twists was Josh Brolin who plays a very credible younger Agent K in the time travel sequence, which contains an unexpected surprise... Overall a very enjoyable fun flick.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|I always finished  Malcolm 's books in one setting. I have to admit that what I read is different from my expectation when I saw the title. This book can gives you a new perspective about success. There are more to it than meet the eyes.

B0076DELIG|5.0|As always Mr. Connelly delivers a wonderful story, as with all the rest of the Harry stories, I found this one hard to put down.<br />Mr. Connelly is one of my favorites. Breathlessly waiting on the next one. Soon I hope.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I found the story intriguing and had trouble putting the Kindle down.  In fact as I got closer to the end stayed up till 3 a.m. just to finish.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|I enjoy his movies because he's a class act that doesn't put out Hollywood garbage. I'm happy to see that there's still hope for Hollywood.
B007JMW46U|5.0|I was enjoying one of the new Downey/Law remakes and decided to check out the rich writing that started it all. Those screenwriters have nothing on on Sir ACD. Engrossing and fun.
B006O3MU96|1.0|Christmas or not, this game is an absolute bore. The graphics are bland, and the main objective is simply to jump from cloud to cloud. The controls work well, but except for that I can't find any redeeming qualities that make it worth keeping.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|You can't lose with greats like Rod Stewart, Michael Buble, etc.  Great to listen to anytime but especially with a nice glass of wine and a cozy atmosphere without a lot of interruptions.
B0053O89WY|5.0|This is a great show.. funny, smart, nerdy, and addicting! I've bought every season so far from Amazon.com and it always ships fast and arrives in perfect condition!<br /><br />I have only one recommendation though...<br /><br />Buy it!
B009RI4ZKC|1.0|Silly. couldn't get beyond the first half hour. WAY OFF BEAT. Wouldn't recommend to anyone. Surprised they got the actors to agree to this film.
B00A2XU9IS|5.0|My kids were so excited to open a new window every day! Especially my 7 year old. Will definately keep it around for next year.
B004JRVQX0|5.0|I'd rather not use an iLok, but I understand why they use it. There are a lot of systems (successful systems I might add) out there that use similar devices, so it's hardly unique. Rather than flood places with complaints that won't change anything, I decided to give it a go and see if it was as much of a pain as some people said it was.<br />It's not.<br />But then again, I haven't had any problems with mine! So I haven't had to deal with customer support. No one ever likes dealing with customer support, they're just pleasantly surprised if it's  not a big pain in the butt. I can't comment on that end of it, and prayerfully will never have to ;).<br /><br />Getting my account on their website set up and the drivers installed was easy enough, the only problem I was having was getting the browser to 'see' that I have a iLok in. It eventually did work, but I had to use internet explorer instead of Chrome (really? STILL working on other browser support? Ugh). Anyway, got that all set up and I loaded EastWest's authorization wizard and used it to place licenses on my iLok. You can go to their website and see what licenses you have on your account, which is nice.<br />The iLok was all ready to go, so I started up the plugins and from then on I didn't have any problems.<br /><br />The iLok itself seems pretty durable. I wouldn't, but I'm confident if I threw it down on pavement it would survive with cosmetic scratches only. So far the only traveling it does is in my backpack sometimes, so I'm not too worried about it. A bigger concern I have is losing it. I could put it on my keys or something but I'm not sure that's totally necessary.<br />I use my iLok on my home workstation, and my laptop when I'm at work. It moves flawlessly between the two. Once the drivers are installed (I'm using Windows 8 Pro 64 and Windows 7 64 bit), you just plug it in and it's ready to go.<br /><br />I don't really view it as a huge problem personally. I need keys to drive in MY car, to open MYoffice, etc. It's not a big issue to me to plug in a USB \\"key\\" as well when I want to make music using specific programs. I'd much rather have this than be required to always be online or something ridiculous like that. Even I would draw the line there.
B005ZUR724|1.0|I purchased this app a year ago and it was nearly flawless.  Great gameplay, good story and an awesome community.  Then, without notice, it stopped working and the game said I needed an update to login.  This update does not exist, and gameloft continues to spit in the face of its kindle customers, from which much of their highest praise came from.  I also have a recurring membership payment which I cannot unsubscribe from.  I have called customer service multiple times and have been hung up on more than once.  I am considering the possible pursuit of legal action for my membership payments which have gotten me nothing.
B008NW67E0|5.0|The new &#34;it&#34; band. In one word: their new CD is AWESOME!! Just what you need to unwind after a long day.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|I really liked this movie, and both my life partner and I have seen it previously...I think we will watch it many more times...
B009HELT3C|3.0|This movie had funny parts and was action packed, but it was lacking in a lot of areas. It seems like Will Smith travels back in time only so that Tommy Lee Jones doesn't have to be in the movie very long. The villain is flat and uninteresting. The plot also follows a very linear path with few twists or turns - for the most part, you know where the movie is going and where it will end.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I have enjoyed this a lot and am working to get 3 stars so I can get special rewards and other levels of play. I have to force myself to put it away or I will never sleep.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|This movie rocks. I couldn't help but sing along. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes music. Yeah!
B004VMVTNU|2.0|I find that I cannot get this to work properly and am not using it as a result. I am glad I didn't spend a lot of money
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Tommy Lee Jones is a little too old to play the part now (know the feeling) and this storyline adeptly deals with the problem by introducing a younger version, in doing so it creates a funny, sentimental and decent sic-fi action flick. Like many have said, I think this is the best of the three - great performances all round, well worth a watch!
B0063GORYU|4.0|Works well on kindle fire exactly as promised.  Nothing crazy but if you have played spider before this is what you remember
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Great movie makes me laugh every time!!!! Fat Amy is hilarious, Rebel Wilson never disappoints. Can't wait to see what else she has coming out!
B005PYZG6E|5.0|I bought this to cut down on the shakiness on my shots for my Canon Vixia HV40.  I've used it about 10 times and I love it!!  It takes a while to get use to it for those that don't use stabilizers.  I wouldn't use it on bigger cameras but for smaller camera's its a great tool to have as a backup etc.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not stop reading this book. It was so exciting it kept my attention. I am not much on reading but I read the whole trilogy and can't wait for the second movie
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Great CD a sure winner for any Kelly Clarkson fan. It has the potential to make fans out of those who were not necessarily<br />fans, me included. A great collection of Kelly Clarkson hits. Whether you have no other Kelly Clarkson CD's or have been a collector this one is a must .
034544678X|5.0|A must read for anyone considering a dog; there is so much that differs between us and dogs, it is not intuitive, this book drives awareness!
B002UD56I6|3.0|I love Michael Jackson and was looking so much in seeing this film. Sorry but it was not what I expected. I think his death was one of the worlds biggest loses and I can not even think he will ever be replaced but the movie just does nothing for me. If you would like to see him put his last vidio togather then maybe you will like it. I was hoping for a movie. Anyway here is to Michael who rules but the movie did not.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Better than others Batman Unnecessarily long. Catwoman no charm, evil not strong enough, Robin promising. Great FX, Good photography. Waiting for the sequel.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is way better than temple run I play this game all day everyday I cant put it down
B009LK6JS2|3.0|I'm not the biggest fan of motion games, and this wasn't an exception. I must admit, I thought the graphics were quite awesome. And I liked how challenging it was to land a plane on an aircraft carrier. But this type of game turned out to not be for me. So if you are like me and hate using your accelerometer to play your android games then avoid this. If you don't mind, and you like basic flight sims, then this should be worth two dollars to you.
B006H5120E|5.0|Its really what i expected, and it came earlier than expected. I am really delighted.<br /><br />I like it so much. Thanks
B004HX4RT6|5.0|This is what it purports to be, a chess game. You choose a difficulty based on how comfortable or hard you want to be pushed. You aren't waiting all day for the \\"computer\\" to play, or you can even play with two players. And the level 10 chess is smart and challenging (and to me, unbeatable, and I don't consider myself too shabby a player). This is exactly what I would be looking for in a chess game. The only thing it is missing is an online option, but then I would expect to pay more than a dollar for something like that. Great app, if you love to play chess!
B008QE9VJI|5.0|Love Depp and saw the original series but never undertood the story background until this movie arrived. Tim Burton and wife are also important to cast and the black humor continues.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I mean, hey, it's free. If you love Angry Birds then you'll continue its saga with this Star Wars theme'd game. And since I love Star Wars, hey, BONUS!! It was nice to have some extra challenges and laugh at the way the incorporated references to Star Wars. FUN!
B005LAIHYU|5.0|Really good read by a good author. I have read many similar genre novels and enjoyed the topic. Abe's known history blends well with story line.
B008458O3S|5.0|Getting trains from point A to point B sound easy, but not when you are playing this game. Getting them to not run into each other, unless you want to combine them together, can take some timing and creativity. And this challenge makes this game fun. WELL WORTH A DOLLAR! I couldn't believe how challenging this got and how difficult it was to put down. If you like a good puzzle game, I think this is a good one to give a try.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|I was thinking about days later, and thought the actors were perfect in the roles.It is a great move for adults.
B0090YHSFC|5.0|You cut ice to make a drink, and all you do is draw lines. Sometimes you have to be patient to get it to cut just right. Preferably, you want to do this in as few cuts as possible. So be patient and act quick when you see a good opportunity to cut and you can progress pretty quickly. I actually ended up enjoying this and levels fly by faster than most games with levels. I liked the challenge and how random each level can be. The only thing consistent is the shape of the ice, not the direction of the penguins sliding on top of it. Worth two dollars? Probably. I would have paid it. But I enjoy games like this.
B00APUQT7I|4.0|With all the Ice Age movies this one pushes hard to keep up to make it interesting.  It was pretty good and the kids liked it.  I dont think I would buy this movie and I am glad I rented it instead.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|Brave is a 2012 American computer-animated adventure fantasy film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Pictures.<br /><br />Tale focuses upon a girl named Merida coming of age and refusing to follow Scottish traditions of marrying into another noble house to keep the lands at peace. Of course, the tale is written for a 21st century audience because back in the day marrying into families was a way of survival and if you brooked tradition it could mean the death of many including your loved ones but Brave chooses to ignore that historical piece and instead turn this into a modern telling of following your bliss. It works well enough.<br /><br />Brave is very much of a tale of a daughter and mother mending \\"the bond torn by pride\\". In fact, that is arguably the ongoing thematic element of this film and it works on different levels that adults and children can comprehend.<br /><br />Notable voices by: Emma Thompson, Kevin McKidd, Julie Walters, Robbie Coltrane, Kelly MacDonald and Bill Connolly.<br /><br />The budget for this film was $135M and it made over $535M at the Box Office. A video game and other spinoffs have resulted. The Golden Globes have nominated this piece for \\"Best Animated Feature Film\\". Should we expect a sequel?<br /><br />ANIMATION: B plus; HUMOR: C plus to B minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE/VOICE ACTING: B to B plus; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B plus; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B plus to A minus; SOUND/MUSIC: A minus to A; WHEN WATCHED: mid December 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|What starts as a evil man bent out to make money turns into a loving man who adopts a few girls.  The kids and I loved this one.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|fun game to play on my kindle fire. the minigames are fun and the touch controls work well. five stars
B001993Y3G|5.0|Me and the wife enjoy this movie every time we watch it.  An all time classic that never ages.  If you never seen it your doing yourself an injustice.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|lovely game w great graphics. creepy atmosphere helps with the fun and engaging story. another winner from g5 entertainment ab
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|This is just a &#34;put your logic on the shelf&#34; and laugh movie!  Ted is so f'ing cute and Wahlberg ain't bad either.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|This game is so addictive.  I play it everyday on my Kindle Fire.  I even play while watching television, multi-tasking.
B00AB0AXU6|4.0|it's like one of those late night horror movie that came on during the weekend back in the 80's and 90's however of course different time era now. i would say it's definitely worth renting for 3 or 4 bucks. do not expect anything spectacular besides the idea of a good action movie and the continuation of the franchised resident evil movie trilogy (or whatever it's called pass three movies of the same plot). i am a fan and will continue being a fan of resident evil movies. i think they did good on this one....
B009DZDJU6|3.0|It was a good movie, the actors did a solid performance. I really liked how they blended Abe's documented history in with the fiction of a vampire hunter. I cannot say that blown away, but if you want to try it out, go for it. It held my interest the whole way through and I was working on solving a puzzle at the same time. I failed at the puzzle as I was more interested in the movie.
B008G12ERC|5.0|Muse just keeps getting better. Very playable we truly enjoyed this CD. A different sound then other outings but definitely worth a listen.
B0086700CM|4.0|Its fun bit everytime I slide it jumps and ahem I try to jump it slides but other than that its really fun!!!!!!
B00AJRQLTI|2.0|It's alright... Hope the movie is better... The vocals, especially the males, are a little weak , but it tells the story alright
B009CG2YDE|1.0|I do not really have any thing to say about this app. I do not love it, nor do I hate it!
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Excellent movie.  Just as good as the first movie.  Would watch again.  Love all the actors.  If a third movie comes out I would buy it.
075669812X|5.0|My grandson asked this for Christmas.  It's one of his favorites.  He is 7 and pours over these books so he will know about every character.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|It never was able to download any songs for me.  I would put in a search, choose music and there would always be some problem!
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|It should have been called \\"Resident Evil: Regurgitation.\\"  How excitingly un-original can you get than to go back to the same device you started out with - fighting your way out of an underground city?  The writers need to deposit some more quarters into their imagination machine.
B000BISBDY|3.0|My husband is a big fan of Johnny<br />I would like to get more of his records and will do so in the near future
B009JBZH54|5.0|A+ Fast MINT Copy A+...  .. .....  ... ....  ..  .... . ..... .... ..  .. . .... .. ......
B008XG1X18|1.0|What is this?  I don't remember anything that I ordered that had the above referenced logo.<br />Please advise as your earliest convenience
B008F9E306|5.0|He always keeps it original. Between him and Outkast / Big Boi they keeping Hip Hop alive. This isn't all that snap and Pop mess. Dre killed it on \\"Sorry\\". People need to start listening to the words and not just a beat with no lyrics. T.I did his thang.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm not a zombie apocalypse kind of gal.  Probably more of a Downton Abbey fan.  But, this story lines in the this series are totally captivating.  After the first few episodes, I got over the gore, and was completely sucked in by the characters.  It's just too bad they keep dying...it feels like losing friends.
B00338QENI|4.0|The author wanted to write about Henrietta but I feel she got sidetracked several times in the book.  There was an entire midsection that was a bit too detailed and not about Henrietta at all, but she did get back to her and her family.  Overall, I liked it.
B0073RSVMC|5.0|My son loved getting this for his birthday.  It's way LESS expensive from buying from Walmart.  It has movable jaws and is hard rubber but yet softer to the touch.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This is a fun game but I wish there were more coins to play with instead of having to buy more.
B0079XNWQA|3.0|I THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE ONE GREAT CD.........WRONG!  AFTER LISTENING TO IT ONCE, I HAD HAD ENOUGH.  MAYBE AGE HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT?  I'M 55!  :-)
B0095XPZBC|3.0|In one of the very first scenes on the first disc, the amount of bad grain on the bridge shots just blew me away.  Not just \\"grain\\", but white grain on all the dark parts of the scene.<br /><br />My son and I watched season 1 in its entirety and saw nothing of the kind.  Very disappointing.<br /><br />On the second episode, same thing on a couple scenes later on... but thank god it wasn't as much as episode 1 had.<br /><br />Did no one pop the disc into their Blu-Ray player and actually watch this before putting it on the store shelves??<br /><br />Also, the blue planet scene in episode 1 or 2 (don't remember which), it looked just awful.  Now I have a 73\\" TV, so I know details get blown up... but it was kinda pathetic looking in this case.<br /><br />Anyway, 3 stars.  It's TNG, which I love, but god the quality control was just bad.
B009IF82SK|5.0|Sheldon makes my day.  This is the kind of show that can be watched many times and you laugh as much the second time as you did the first !!!!
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Great special effects Story line in the original was better IMO. But it is a relatively good movie. As long as you arent expecting more than great effects, shallow story and a lot of action.
B000O599WG|5.0|Good story, good John Wayne feature, Dean Martin great. Gotta love little Ricky. They should make more cowboy movies. Buy it.
B0063IH60K|2.0|I still cannot figure how to get rid of a game that did not finish so that I can play another game. If someone can tell me how to operate the part where you cancel an unfinished game in order to start a new game?
B0076DELIG|4.0|Connelly's Harry Bosch improves in each story, always the Champion of the<br />voiceless victim. He is not deflected by his boss's agenda ever and takes delight<br />making end runs around  authority. His network of enablers are always old<br />contacts withen the system and are played beautifully by Harry to get what he wants. The story hangs together with no loose ends, Michael Connelly is indeed a master of his craft,
B0061QD88S|5.0|How can you review a classic like this.  Good clean entertainment from the master Walt Disney. And Tramp is so cute!
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|By now, I'm pretty sure that every sentient human in America has played Angry Birds.  Or at least, knows what it is.  Those small, irate avians flying through the air with their gleeful little exultations of &#34;WooHoo!&#34; and &#34;Yippee!&#34; as they sail towards their ill-fated swine antagonists.  Such fun!<br /><br />&#34;But wait,&#34; I'm sure the software engineers at Rovio Entertainment asked themselves. &#34;How can we make it even BETTER?&#34;<br /><br />The answer was simple:  they would have to combine Angry Birds with Star Wars!<br /><br />Now, to be honest, I haven't played Angry Birds Star Wars myself, but I can attest that it helps distract and quiet our six year old daughter very well, and that alone is well worth every penny spent on this app.<br /><br />Especially since it was free.<br /><br />Free is good.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I haven't watched it yet. It's going to be a gift. Good thing I got to the computer before she did. You nearly blew it.<br /><br />We do love the movie. We've seen it before. Now we have our own copy.<br /><br />Thanks, your service is fine. We've gotten many things through Amazon and we've been very pleased with your service. We reccomend your service to others.<br /><br />Please stop emailing these, &#34;Do you like me? Do you really? Ah,thanks. Tell me how much.&#34; messages.  PLEASE!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Still got a quarter of the book left and I gotta say--Wow!  Looking forward to more from Andy Weir, kinda disappointed that there is only one title out!  Great read, gives you lots to think about!
B00A4YVHXQ|2.0|Really fun when it works properly.  Sometimes the sound doesn't work during play through.  Pointless to play music game when I can't hear the tune, lol.
B007WOFXB8|5.0|I did not buy this set from amazon, and my 5 disc box has no labels from Rhino on the packaging, so there may be a discrepancy between the product shown and the product sold. My set, which is pictured, only has Warner Brother logos.<br /><br />I've actually only listened to Tres Hombres, but the drums sound like drums, not 80s reverb nonsense.
B000YHG72E|4.0|My children really enjoyed this movie and we were relieved that there weren't any inappropriate scenes, as there sometimes are for younger children in PG movies.  Buddy's character is so wholesome and honest and the message that the movie sends is good.
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|Anything is better than Arnold, but this was entertaining. Good script and it didn't feel like I was watching a remake.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|This is a great app for kindle fire. I had used pulse, and it was really good until the most recent update, but now it crashes all the time. I gave flipboard a try and it works and looks great, no problems at all so far.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I am not one who plays many games, but this one has me playing in my spare moments. It is addictive and seemingly easy.  Just connect one colored dot to it's mate and that's it, but if not done in the correct path, all the dots cannot be connected.  This game really is fun if you like logic puzzles.<br /><br />It will keep kids entertained and there are easy puzzles for them but that is an extra pack that must be bought. None of the extra packs cost much. I think the kids pack is 99 cents. And there is a deal for under 5 dollars for the entire set of extras. But there are enough puzzles to keep you occupied for at least 6 months included with the game.
B00ABXA1HI|4.0|This app works really well. I've had no problems with it. It allows remote connection of my Mac through my kindle fire hd. The mouse is a little tricky until you get used to how to click, but it doesn't take long to get the hang of.
B0042AEOG0|5.0|I love this CD. My favorite song is 'When Christmas Comes' she and John Ledgend together on this song is wonderful! I also like Track #4.
034580404X|5.0|This book series was not purchased for me to read, but for my wife.  She is stuck on the twilight universe and is currently reading the books, so when i told her this series started off as fan fiction she was intrigued.  I was as well given the hype that was being created and since my wife also like Anne Rice's Sleeping Beauty books i figured she would want to try these books out.  So far she is really happy and is working on the 2nd book now.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|When this show first ended at season one, my biggest fear was that this was going to be another 'Heroes' where the first season was excellent and then it lost its way and was never able to find its way back.<br /><br />Fortunately this has not yet happened. Its staying with in its set guidelines I believe this was actually planned out from the start, instead of just one season.
0553386794|5.0|I have to keep this review short or else i will just type and type and type!  i love this book series, i really cannot stress or promote this book enough.  I have spoken with people at great length and feel like a scholar when watching the series on HBO and give them more backstory.  I bought this book for my father as he has really got me into reading since i was a kid and has recommended great books to me.  if you have someone that is interested in the HBO series and they are ok with spending much of their waking hours reading this drug of a book....then buy it for them... they will thank you.  Warning:  this book is not just a book you pick up in the bathroom, once you are hooked...your hooked!  The author does not spell things out too well and expects a certain level of intelligence, so beware of that too.  I am not trying to say you need to be a genius to read these books but just know your reading level and know that there are a bunch of character and ideas that are thrown in here, many character only show up in a chapter or two or are just mentioned in passing and then brought up in more detail later on, or even further into the next book.... so many a time am i using the appendix and the flipping back and forth to find out, &#34;who the hell is that&#34; or &#34;what the hell are they talking about&#34;. All in all. a great book and an awesome read.
B009A87Z6U|4.0|This movie is kind of like the last act to Casino Royale. If Casino Royale could've been 4 or 5 hours this would just be added to the end, and from that view point it doesn't disappoint. Perhaps not as emotionally charged as Casino Royale but it makes up for that with action. A pretty good movie in my viewpoint and I enjoyed it.
B008I6ZX1E|5.0|These books are extremely well written. The longer, more thorough reviews cover why and how. The value here can't be beat, and it shipped in relatively good condition. The edges of the dust covers were a little freyed due to rough handling by the carrier, but that isn't the seller's fault.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|I'd recommend this book for anyone with an interest in religion, either from a \\"believer\\" or \\"skeptic\\" perspective.  Dawkins' book will reveal things you may not have known about Christianity and give you a more balanced perspective on the subject.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|It was a wonderful movie, and the book is too. I wanted to read the book because you can't rewind a movie in a theater.
B00A77II0U|1.0|If a game will not load on a KF why is it available on the list of games on a Kindle Fire.  I couldn't load it, immdediately went to my computer (since I can't get to that part of my acct on the Fire), tried to cancel the order since it is in the pending section and gee it won't let me, so guess I eat $2.99.  Just a word of advice - before you purchase this game or any other one for that matter, make darn sure it will work.  This happened 1-2 times before, but it was .99 games so I didn't bother pursueing it. But now we are talking dollars so I am.  I have to say that this is the first time I have had a complaint on anything to do with Amazon, but I am getting tired of this.
B009G78EE2|5.0|My favorite album right now. The man has a great flow, great sound. His lyrics stretch from purposeful and heartfelt to rowdy and fun - and they all stick in your head.
B005UA0FLE|5.0|A great, Christmas album by a great voice.  I especially like track 15 - Felize Navidad. . . . .
B0064X7FVE|4.0|IT WORKS GREAT, I WOULD RECOMMEND IT. VERY GOOD WITH INFO AND EASY TO READ, I THINK ITS A VERY GOOD TOOL TO HAVE.
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|fun cute movie great soundtrack nice family fun movie highly recommend all about innocent love. Quirky and dynamic good flick
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Its very useful...! it tells us how much tym we can use the internet; watch videos; etc. i love it!
B008BM9L72|5.0|it was ok writing the thing i enjoyed was the concept but it did mirror twilight i thought. but nice idea lol
B000W1V5OC|4.0|Great concert and documentary.<br /><br />The only defect is that the video was filmed on 16:10 aspect ratio but the DVD is 4:3, so it has a loss of quality.  You have to use the zoom in feature if you have a widescreen.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|These people are brilliant. Their music is amazing. Worth every penny for the privilege of listening to them. That is all.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|When I rented this, I had some issues with the movie breaking up and coming in chopped and missing lines and a few scenes. What I did get to see of the movie was cool. After reading other reviews I was prepared for blood and gore, but it was nothing like that. While some violence, it fit with the theme and story line. It was exciting and entertaining. I usually can't sit for a whole movie - I get bored. This held my attention and was fun to watch. I couldn't quite give it a 5 star rating - it was a little predictable and Clint Eastwood wasn't in it. =)<br />(By the way, Amazon took care of my issues with the movie because they ROCK!!)
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Since there was so much hype about this book saying how fantastic it was, I fell for it and purchased it for my Kindle.  Well, after reading on and on, expecting something interesting to happen, I gave up on the book and stopped reading it.  This book is juvenile, lifeless, and pathetic.  It was a complete waste of my time and money.  I should have known better.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Gone Girl<br /><br />This book was just so unrealistic. No one would do what she did in the book. I did not enjoy this book.
B000W93CHC|5.0|World Without End<br /><br />I am enjoying this follow up to Pillars of the Earth.  I am learning a lot about that time in history.
0553386816|5.0|good book good service John grisham is the best ever. I will buy more books as he writes them.  Yea
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|It was excellent but sad reading and I fear for the people in North Korea.  Thank you for such good service Donna
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|This was a very fun and cute movie to watch but not the best thing Pixar has ever put out.
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|Pixar has been on a slow downhill climb as of late, Brave unfortunately takes a drastic dip from previous outings.  First off , for those who don't know, in the middle of production the director was switched. This isn't that abnormal for Hollywood mind you, but considering Disney was pretty vocal about this being one of Pixar's first female directed movies with a strong female lead it does cause some issues. The switch of directors is very noticeable.<br /><br />The movie doesn't seem to know what genre or mood it wants to set. One second it's dramatic, the next comedy/slapstick, then something mystic/supernatural, and then something like a poor imitation Ghibli movie. These constant switches are most likely due to the different visions both directors had. To make matters worse the story and characters suffer due to this.<br /><br />First off the main lead. Merida doesn't change at all throughout the movie. She comes out at the beginning not wanting to follow family tradition, rather her own fate. Yet at the end she just caves in and gives into her fate as dictated by her parents. Yeah, she won't be forced to marry anyone right away, but in the future she will be. So her mother still controls her fate. Overall, Merida is a very passive character not the strong one the movie was advertised as having.<br /><br />Next is the problem with the story. First off, the throw away characters. The main catalyst for the movie is Merida meeting the witch and getting the potion from her. Why does the witch do this? Is she evil? Good? The fact that the main catalyst is a two-dimensional throw away character shows a lot of the problems this movie went through during development. Basic screenwriting 101- cause and effect. You need a reason for things to happen. Not, I'll give you this potion so the movie can move along.<br /><br />Next problem. What is this movie supposed to be about? Merida's engagement? Her mother issues? Some old prince who was cursed to become a bear? From thesethree points brought up in the movie, which one doesn't seem to belong? This movie has too many side stories going on. It's like they just took a bunch of ideas with some vague relation and stuck them together. A lot of the pacing issues could have been solved by removing the part about the cursed prince and filling that empty space with more plot from the other two points.<br /><br />Another problem is the mother's transformation. She adapts to being a bear to easily. Within hours of being a bear she can already walk on both legs, navigate through narrow corridors, run through the woods, even use silverware with her claws. Disney's Brother Bear does this transformation much better, especially in terms of adaptability.<br /><br />So, with a weak female lead, poor pacing, paper-thin plot, what does the movie get right? Well, it is beautiful. The animation is simply gorgeous with obvious care given to every detail on landscape and props.<br /><br />In conclusion, as far as Pixar movies go, this is by far the weakest. Pixar has branded themselves as storytellers, being able to reach both young and old. This is what separates them from many other family movie producing companies. Unfortunately, Pixar seems to drop the ball here with their storytelling.<br /><br />A visual treat yes, a good story no.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|The is a titan cast - really, some of the best performances ever to appear on screen. I've been a fan of Damian Lewis since watching \\"Band of Brothers\\" (multiple times) and I was anything but disappointed after seeing \\"Homeland.\\"<br /><br />Cliches are a hard pass here. The screenwriters really do a great job at spinning exhausted tropes of the spy thriller-drama genre and making what are normally parallel plots if not sub-plots driving forces of (and inseparable from) the main plot line. It makes for fresh, novel viewing.<br /><br />Moreover, this appears to be a very nuanced portrayal of the Middle-Eastern affairs, so far as I can tell. And you won't find any overt political agenda/bias here. To be fair, they're definitely are a few not-so-quiet smacks at the Bush administration, but we hear that from both political parties nowadays anyhow.<br /><br />Bravo, bravo.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|O my gosh. This game is like the best game ever! I am addicted to it. Everyone should get this. GREAT GAME!
B008R9QAY6|5.0|'Artaserse' is the last major composition by Leonardo Vinci. Written for tenor and five castrati, it is now rarely performed as written. Usually you find women singing the primary male roles. THIS recording, however, is cast with outstanding countertenors, and breathes new life into an elegant piece of the Baroque literature. Lengthy recitatives and glorious arias, parts demanding both extraordinary musical and theatrical talents. Jaroussky does a fine job in the title role, but the rest of the cast truly stand out as well. This recording is a must for any aficionado of early music, opera, or countertenors.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Awesome. It exceeded my expectations. As I got into it, I saw threads of lots of other writers, including Asimov and Heinlein, woven through the book. But Card took the story and made it his own, combining it with a classical coming of age story that reminded me of plenty that I read when I was a kid. He wasn't bashful about mixing young with old, kind with brutal, human with non-human, with a dash of politician in the mix. If you've read Suzanne Collins The Hunger Games Trilogy you can see where a lot of her ideas came from.<br /><br />I calibrate scifi with the date published. Ender's Game was published in 1985 so the PC was already out in the world. Card did a good job with the computer tech, although there was still too much paper communication for critical things. His computer gaming / war simulation stuff was fascinating and well done, in a way that was very accessible to a reader of any age. And his space travel - like most science fiction - was fine, but still a fantasy for the human race in 2012.
B008HK3XU4|3.0|I like the thought of protection for this fancy little gadget.  Does not stay in place on one corner which aggravates me, Semi hides the on/off  switch which is a little difficult to reach to begin with.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I enjoyed reading the book but found it a little dragging out after the first half. Give it a just O&#62;K&#62; . nothing more
B009GIPDQS|4.0|... from sympathy for the main character to downright admiration for his shrewdness - all while remaining at least somewhat believable! Enjoyable read
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Basically a free book with only a small charge to pay, this is a real bargain. The story is really well written, rather original dealing with the exploits of just one man stuck on mars and it was the sort of book that once I began reading, I didn't want to put it down. I would recommend it for anyone who enjoys good science fiction.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I love this show.  Its one of the best comedy shows that I'm hooked on since the days of Friends.<br /><br />The character's quirkiness and the writing all makes a very entertaining show.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I have never read any of the Harry Potter books though I believe they must be very, very good, and I am in favor of anything that interests children in reading.  But when someone told me a bit about the premise of &#34;Casual Vacancy&#34; I ordered it for my Kindle application.  I would hope that my not liking the book would not stop anyone else from reading it, though, since my less than stellar opinion is based purely on my own tastes in reading, and I know that the author is very well received and is a genuine talent.
B003L77G6A|5.0|I love this show.  Its one of the best comedy shows that I'm hooked on since the days of Friends.<br /><br />more character introductions with Amy Farah Fowler who complements Sheldon's character very well.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Amazon can, now and then, surprise us with a great free app of the day. I'm not complaining, I appreciate the fact that Amazon has gone this course. But this is probably the best free app Amazon has given us since they originally launched with Angry Birds (Ads Free). WINNER! Amazon is spoiling us this Christmas!<br /><br />This usually goes for five dollars and if you missed it as the free app of the day, I would say spending that five dollars is well worth it. I usually stop recommending games after it goes over a dollar. But I'll recommend this at five dollars with no hesitation.<br /><br />The gameplay is pretty simple and is just as intuitive and beautiful as it is on my PC. Best part is that this is portable! You build bridges with goo while saving enough goo to get a certain number across your structure. Prepare to be challenged, thinking caps are required to advance in this game.<br /><br />Thank you, Amazon, for this amazing gift! Too cool. And, thank you, 2D Boy, for making such an awesome game!
B000W91RUG|5.0|awesome show!!  Love the writing and character development of all 5 regular cast members.  Originally, I wasn't big on the fact that this show has replaced several Friends episode syndication, but after watching an episode or two.  I'm hooked
B000YHG72E|5.0|Love this movie!  It's become an annual tradition for my family to watch every year.  It's another classic.  Everyone can enjoy it (young & old).
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I love this show.  Its one of the best comedy shows that I'm hooked on since the days of Friends.<br /><br />The character's quirkiness and the writing all makes a very entertaining show.
B000MR1V22|5.0|creative, funny, excellant cast.  Only movie I can watch over and over and not get bored.  Watched it on a plane onetime and they went to turn it off when we were landing and the whote plane complained and they let it finish while we landed.  When we did land noone got up untill the movie ended.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I love this show.  Its one of the best comedy shows that I'm hooked on since the days of Friends.<br /><br />Its cool to see the added cast of the female characters to help add another dimension to the story.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|Best deal I could find on the internet! My neice loved it when she opened it up on Christmas morning!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I really liked this book because it was very relatable yet different ···· The format of letters really allows the reader to get into Charlie's brain and see the world thought his eyes.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|Awesome book wish I was him but that's impossible so slam dunk hippopotamus red a text I am trying to run out of words success
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Ms Hoover does it again! I have to say that this is such a heartbreaking story. I never thought I would enjoy reading about young love because I am a Mom of adult children (not quite 49) and it wouldn't interest me. But my gosh, I have loved all of her books. I love the way her characters are mature yet innocent. I love the way she connects me to the characters and how much you fall for ever piece of them. The detail she places in them and the way the character tells the story pulls you right in to their life. I couldn't put it down. The thing I love most about her books is that I REMEMBER them, every little beautiful detail.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Love puzzles and this one is great with the movement addiing extra challenges to your creative thinking and speed of building added in.  Its just great!
B00AGE20ZI|5.0|A wonderful story that focuses on the true meaning of Christmas, beginning with a prayer to God for guidance by the Bishop (David Niven) which results in an angel Dudley (Cary Grant) who comes to the rescue and manages to change the lives of everyone he meets, including the Bishop's wife, Julia (Loretta Young). It ends with the sermon about the story of an empty stocking, one we still celebrate today with gifts. &#34;It is the stocking of a child born in a manger. It is His birthday we are celebrating. Don't let us ever forget that! Let us ask ourselves what He would wish for most, and then, let each put in his share - loving kindness, warm hearts, and a stretched out hand of tolerance, all the shining gifts that make peace on earth.&#34;
B009GQ57ES|5.0|This is real music. They put a lot of time and effort into this album and it really shows. Macklemore raps about his own life in great ways under a combination of hip hop and pop genres.
B004A2U4V4|5.0|Love it! Love it! Love it!  Growing up with Bon Jovi songs, I was pleased on how many hits made this album.  He is a true rock star that knows how to tell a story that really reflects true life situations.
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|Can't really say few enough words to convey what a losy movie this was. We really hated it as much as any movie we've seen this year. Mark Wahlburg is better than this.
B008ASLNN2|4.0|Robert Downey Jr. delivers a perfect performance as the unlikely, eccentric action-hero, Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />This cerebral thriller will keep you on the edge of your seat with cunning twists and turns and metaphors usually only found in classic literature. Jude Law also delivers a stellar performance as Watson.<br /><br />My only complaint, and it has nothing to do with the content or the producers, is that the HD version buffered A LOT while streaming - which is Amazon's fault. (We have 7+ Mbps wifi, which works fine with all other HD streaming services).<br /><br />Sherlock Holmes 2 is a must see film, even with the Amazon HD buffering issues(though you might try the non-HD version instead)<br /><br />Enjoy it,<br />John
B007VYDFMS|5.0|Unfortunately, I was one of those Blacks who knew nothing about BOB MARLEY, until his death. SAD. Because it was US that he was trying to reach! This is a wonderful DVD, that answered every question I could ever have about this man. There is even some valuable history on his native country of Jamaica. THIS DVD EXPLAINS IT ALL AND I AM HAPPY TO HAVE VIEWED IT!
B009LT1YZ6|5.0|this is a relaxing very easy on the eyes game.well worth 99 cents. I purchased this game for my lg phone and am about to purchase for my kindle...once you get used to the tilt controls gameplay is nice...the music is peaceful and almost haunting...I just feel bad for the lonley little fish who will certainly perish
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Reasonable twist on the original story.<br />Great special effects, and fast paced.<br />Only let down was a few characters were poorly cast (brother)<br />Dwarfs were superb, and added a little comedy.
B009DH379C|5.0|Yes, it was basically the song list from Wembley, but don't let that prevent you from getting this. The Blu-ray picture and sound are both outstanding, and the band never sounded better. Freddy is in excellent voice here, maybe even a bit better than at Wembley. For me, the performance was beyond expectation. I look forward to watching it again and again!
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|Downnloaded today, screen  goes black and then it returns to whatever screen was showing prior!  Please fix as soon as possible.<br />My son is very disappointed!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game has been recommended to me many times. Now that I finally have it, I can say it is definitely a work of art. Great gameplay and stunning visuals!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Love g5 games!! full of suspense! exciting and action packed till the very end of the game! was sad when it was over!!
B009LDXQGW|3.0|Not quite what I expected. Good beats though, with a good singing voice. Most o the coin was spent in the wrong places.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|The case is light weight and durable. The different positions that can be used is an added plus. Would recommend it to others.
B0040YFR1Y|4.0|NOTHING is better than the original... but this is a lot of fun with an added twist! 2nd best film o the franchise.
B000A2IPP0|5.0|I love this movie, but didn't order it so I don't know why I received this product rating.  Random, I guess.
B005LAJ1PE|5.0|The hands-down most original ghost story I've enjoyed in easily over a decade. Amazing performances with the right amount of eeriness.
B000RLHDUM|5.0|This version is my favorite and I find that I can (and do) watch it repeatedly without getting bored.  The acting is more than fine, and the pace is delightful.<br /><br />Sometimes the second try is the best.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Nothing is ever gonna beat the last film. But I enjoyed this tremendously, almost as much as the first film!
1455523550|5.0|I must say this book was without a doubt one of my favorites... I couldnt put it down story was great writing was great..one I could read again and again!!
B006O6F932|1.0|THIS IS THE BIGGEST PIECE OF CRAP !!!<br />I have to wonder how much the people got paid for the FAKE good reviews of this toy !?!?<br />The thing doesn't snap together in any way ,it fall's apart , you can't barely bump it and the whole thing comes down like a house of cards.<br />SAVE YOUR MONEY
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Fabulous finale for the Second Season ! Wow, takes the breath away and definitely leaves you hanging... It cant be the \\"end\\" for Carrie and Brody. While it isnt the only aspect that is thrilling, but is a definite draw for me. Having them not be together would make it as crappy as \\"real life\\" is and I watch to see something else.... LOL It looked so \\"final.\\" Still bugs me but I cant wait to see how it shakes out next season.
B006X5L6VS|5.0|This app is amazing.  We have been able to track the alignment of the planets from our porch.  it has helped us with identifying other stars and planets that we look at through out 2 telescopes.  Great buy!!!
0618001905|5.0|This book is factually written without racial biase by the Author and that is commendable.Its a story of colonialism and what it stood for.An eye opening ,Exiting, sad,and shocking account in Belgium Congo a mirror reflection of what happened in the rest of Africa during colonialism.
B00402FGE4|5.0|It's only fair to start by saying that I love science fiction and always have. I grew up watching the original Star Trek and reading Isaac Asimov and Ray Bradbury. V? Watched it. Lost? Watched it. Babylon 5? Watched it. Farscape? Firefly? The original Stargate series? Battlestar Galactica? Caprica? Watched 'em all. But for some reason I never watched Stargate Universe until I developed a fangirl crush on Robert Carlyle in Once Upon a Time and started buying up everything I could find with him in it.<br />So, first things first. Carlyle's Dr. Rush is scruffy, devious, charming, calculating, unfeeling AND emotional in turns, prone to those fits of anger he does so well, and absolutely fangirl worthy. I expected that. But what I didn't expect was to fall in love with Young, Scott, Eli, and almost every other character on Destiny (the jury's still out on Camille; I just can't seem to rustle up any warmth for her - even though she's totally sympathetic at times I just don't LIKE her character; she causes too much trouble for those I do care about).<br />I love the look of the show, the writing, the acting, even the frequent miraculous reunions that keep the whole gang together just when you thought some were surely lost. I love it. Just absolutely love it. I'm almost at the end of Season 1, and beginning to get this awful feeling in the pit of my stomach because I know that Season 2, which I bought at the same time, was cancelled short of its completion. I know these people I've come to love were just left out there on that ship in the middle of nowhere. I know it will just end and I will experience this as a little death, the end of consciousness (as Eli ponders in one early episode). I'll never know what happens to them, and I want to. So I approach the last discs with trepidation, unable to not watch them and yet hating the fact that I'm watching them.<br />Strange, I bought this item to oogle Carlyle and wound up genuinely caring about all the people on that ship, T.J. and Chloe and Eli and Young and all the others. What an adventure they found! I'm so glad they took me along. Still, I like to think that Rush and Eli found a way to get them back to Earth eventually. I like to think that they're all safe and home. Science fiction is all about imagination, isn't it?
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I'm so glad I got this deal on Black Friday for $3.99. And my toddlers loved the movie and they loved the singing fish. I might need to buy the soundtrack :)
B006R4H5FG|4.0|for those who want to really deliver a presentation.<br />In this Powerpoint era, books like Garr Reynolds' are a must read
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|A lot of fun. Colorful and good graphics. Fun for all ages. I would recommend this game to seasoned players and to those just learning to play.<br /><br />Y
B00A4YVHXQ|3.0|I thought it would be like the little piano app I had downloaded but its not. This is more of a game & its a little hard to get it down. You got to move fast and have good eyes for this one.
B006H5120E|5.0|One of my top 5 favorite movies. Love everything about it (except her not sharing the wooden door with him and her throwing the necklace overboard). The acting was superb!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a wonderful app that does what it advertises.  it is very easy to use and of course..very accurate.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|This shipped so quickly! I had it within 2 days. The DVD was in great shape and my daughter loves it.

B0072N4PD6|5.0|I absolutely love the message that this book has!! Thank you for writing it in such a way that is so simple yet so powerful
0345529057|5.0|Product was delivered in perfect condition. Books are absolute fantastic and a wonderful purchase, especially for game of thrones fans.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|I liked the first movie better but this one was done well and has the same feel as the first. It's worth having!
B003VANOFY|4.0|Really nice product the only bad thing is that the dolby sourround doesn't work if you have a Mac (also on logitech.com ther aren't drivers for Mac). For all the other things are great clear and beautiful sound also if it's a wireless device, and the buttons are really helpfull (in particoulare the one for the volume).
B008XG1X18|5.0|love to use it and see the many items to pin.  Usually use this every day to see what is new and exciting.
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|Worst movie I have seen in a long time. we did not bother watching it the whole way through. Very poor film.
6302862949|5.0|I love to watch dance movies and have a collection of dance DVD's.  The scene of Hines and Barry in the ballroom is one of my favorites.  I watch it and rewind it and watch it and rewind it.  Their performance is amazing in that their dance backgrounds are so different yet their individual performance so spectacular.  I didn't know which dancer to watch.  And of course, the movie is good too.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|I am not upset by any means that I rented this movie for $1.99.  The special effects alone were worth that.  The movie at times had me on the edge of my seat, but it didn't take me long to realize that it was all from the action and not from the actual substance (I found myself making fun of the movie about half way through).<br /><br />The acting, well, not sure I really saw much.  The script was very thin to say the least.  Any character development was sacrificed in the name of action....which is probably good, because if Kristen Stewart were to develop into anything more, it could only go downhill!!  I avoided Twilight as most reviewers did, but WOW...she is terrible!!  Barely believable as a living breathing human being, Stewart is playing Snow White aka \\"the fairest of them all\\"...ummm, I can't be the only one to find her decidedly unattractive!!?<br /><br />If the trailer interested you as it did me, you probably will at least not regret the movie.  Just know going in, that the movie itself is pretty much 2 hours of the trailer.  But, if you are looking for a fresh take on the Snow White story and want to walk away thinking WOW....then don't waste your time!!<br /><br />Spoiler (kinda).....<br /><br />BONUS -- They had 8 dwarves....but Gus had to die!! HAHA
B0050PYNO4|5.0|This is a great movie to watch if you are in a light and happy mood. It can get serious but a wonderful comedy.
B0026PW67W|4.0|Overall I am very content with the map and will have it framed and up in my home. The only issue I have is that it would be easier to handle if it unfolded into a square map than a rectangle that is 72 inches long. I am only going to have a small selection of the map framed since the whole piece would cost over $250 and that is with a sale.
B003UMW68Y|5.0|What a great movie to watch for Christmas or even Halloween. A yearly tradition in our home. Fun enough to watch any time.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Great job to whoever made this movie.<br />Alternative ending: Batman doesn't save the city in time, bomb explodes destroys half of Gotham.<br />The next movie pic up in a war-torn Gotham.<br />You are welcome.
B0063IH60K|3.0|But hate the ads between every game....so annoying...sometimes hard to get out of them...But as mentioned in another review, it is a good time consumer when you are bored.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The main reason I chose this novel was because I had just seen the movie version.  Wonderful book with a very imaginative story.  Highly recommend this great read to anyone.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|really love being able to stay on top of the ever changing upper midwest weather as I'm on the road at least 2 hours a day for women work.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I have had so many issues with this game in recent months. It keeps crashing and resetting all my progress to level one. Gameloft has done NOTHING to fix this issue except try to send me back ups of my progress...which ended up getting lost when the game reset. It has been doing this every day and Gameloft still has not fixed ANY of my issues. Do not waste your time or money on this game. If you spent money in game...amazon has been kind enough to refund any of my purchases...but seriously...do not download this game. It is awful.

B0041KVW2K|5.0|OK, I overreacted.  And maybe other commentators here on Amazon have as well, particularly rabid audiophiles whose perhaps unrealistic expectations led people like me to believe that every little bit of surface noise on the records in this box set was a \\"defect.\\"<br /><br />So far, I've found only one LP in this set that has a problem: Abbey Road with pops so loud that the needle nearly jumps off the record.  Of the seven LPs I've listened to, there have been only a handful of songs with what is best described as minor surface noise, e.g., \\"Here There and Everywhere\\" and \\"Yes, It Is.\\"<br /><br />But can audiophile recordings really be completely noise free?  Maybe one of the commentators here on Amazon can answer that question for me.<br /><br />Apart from the isolated songs, all the albums in the set that I've listened to so far have met and even exceeded the quality standards I anticipated.  And, again to be fair, I have audiophile LP pressings from other artists pressed by companies other than the one used for the Beatles box which have much worse surface noise, so the problems with some of the new Beatles pressings are far from unique and perhaps even exaggerated.<br /><br />As for the book that accompanies the set, so far I seem to be the only commentator to have received a slightly defective copy.  The film laminate on the cover is peeling.  But I do not think that is the pressing plant's fault.  The rest of my box set's packaging is pristine, including the labels/spindle holes on the records which are centered properly.<br /><br />As for the remastered sound, it is gorgeous except for Rubber Soul.  I have no problem with the source for the albums being from 24-bit digital masters instead of directly from the analog tapes.  Indeed, it's very interesting to hear another approach to the Beatles canon on vinyl.  Rubber Soul and, apparently Help (which I've not listened to yet) come from the digital masters used for the original 1980's CDs which were quite poor compared to the remastered 2009 CDs.  As a result, the Rubber Soul in the box set is not as crisp and clear as the other albums, which is a shame since it's one of The Beatles' best LP's.  This is a remastering problem not a defect of the pressing process.<br /><br />At Amazon's suggestion, I am working to have the defective records/book replaced at no charge directly from EMI (according to Amazon, requests for replacement records/books should go to emiconsumer@emicapitol.com). After all, why should Amazon be responsible for EMI's poor quality control management?<br /><br />Anyone who has followed EMI's fortunes over the last few years knows that the company was sold to a group of investors and that it is in deep trouble, so I am not surprised that they would louse up this project (including using the clearly inferior 1980's \\"Rubber Soul\\" and \\"Help\\" CD masters.)  Even before EMI's recent problems, however, the company has always had a cavalier attitude to the quality of the Beatles catalog.<br /><br />For example, EMI appears to have tried to deliberately mislead consumers about the source of the new remastered vinyl LP's.  As described in the accompanying book, the albums were \\"created from the original analog tapes.\\"  I guess that's technically true in that the analog tapes were obviously the basis of the 24-bit source actually used for the albums.  But, make no mistake about it, these are digitally produced albums.

A very interesting, determined and hard-working artist.<br /><br />A main thread of his book is his quest to find \\"reliable\\" people - from when he was youngster to an elder..including trying find that trait in himself.<br /><br />The oddest part is his belief in a \\"master\\" mystic Indian Buddha preacher. Imagine what Pete could produce in the future if studied the people who could make him think more for himself about reality - instead of Pinball Wizards and Tommy... Read some Orwell, Hitchens, Dennett, Dawkins and Harris.... and for masters lead to totalitarianism...

Five stars!<br />  On a side note I made a discovery while playing this on my kindlefire. The game runs fantastic as long as I am connected to wifi. if I'm not, it has a horrible framerate and is barely playable. I hope that this helps someone who.may have been disappointed by MC4's lackluster performance. trust me, once you are connected it a whole different game.
B0098460O4|5.0|Is there any way to give more than 5 stars?  The quality of these two young singers' voices together is remarkable.  The mixing in the studio could have been a little better, as there are songs you'll have to adjust volume on to hear Jonathan's beginning, or Charlotte's parts.  But overall, this is one of my favorite CD's ever.  Looking forward to more from this talented duo.

I usually like Joe Gordon Levitt films, and he is not bad in this but, it just sucks. Micheal Shannon I usually like his films but with the stakes so high for his character in this film his acting makes no sense, it's like he is acting in a different film.  It could, should, have been so much better. Big disappointment do not rent, wait till it appears on late nite basic cable if it ever does. And cycling in front of cgi cars is not exciting! This is a bike messenger movie, but not THE bike messenger movie.

B005LAIIKI|5.0|Set two years before the Civil War, \\"Django Unchained\\" is the story of a slave named Django (Jamie Foxx) who has been separated from his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) as they're sold to different plantations thanks to their previous and vengeful owners. That is until a bounty hunter posing as a dentist named Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) frees Django and not only offers him his freedom but retribution, a way to make some money, and offers to help find his wife as her German background intrigues Schultz. As Django and Schultz bond over the winter, they may have finally bitten off more than they can chew when their journey takes them to Candieland; a plantation owned by the bitter, short fused, and all around insane Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).<br /><br />As promising as \\"Django Unchained\\" seemed some restraint seemed to be in order. The \\"Kill Bill\\" films are personal favorites as \\"Vol. 2\\" was seen in theaters more than once and the theatrical version of \\"Grindhouse\\" was some of the most fun to be had in a movie theater in years. \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" was a bit of a letdown though. It lacked more instances of that over the top gore that has become one of Tarantino's signatures. So the mindset going into \\"Django Unchained\\" involved the desire for it to contain more blood and more action than Tarantino's effort from three years ago. Since it is the Christmas season, ask and ye shall receive.<br /><br />The film begins with shots of Django chained to other slaves marching through the elements as the credits flash on screen in red text as Luis Bacalov's \\"Django\\" serenades an otherwise dismal scene. One of the best shots involves the profile of Jamie Foxx in the left corner and the text of the credits on the right side of the screen complete with the image of Foxx blurring when the credits appear and coming into focus as they vanish. The soundtrack, as what's come to be the standard for Tarantino films, is glorious. Bouncing back and forth between plucking guitars and melancholy strings and western songs from film, TV, and whatever else inspired Tarantino in the filmmaking process, the music is the final touch in establishing what is already a superb albeit somewhat skewed look into the south during this time period.<br /><br />It takes very little time for gore to enter the picture. Blood ejects into the air like a dormant geyser that has suddenly awakened after an extended slumber. The splatter effect is an extremely welcome addition, especially since it's always done on a blank surface whether it's the hair of a white horse or the white walls and pillars of Candieland. Remember how the Queen of Hearts has playing cards painting white roses red in Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland? Tarantino seems to paint white roses red throughout \\"Django Unchained.\\" The finale is where the liquid crimson really gushes and the appetite for violence is overstuffed to your utmost delight.<br /><br />Tarantino always manages to put together an incredible cast and \\"Django\\" is just another feather in his cap. The most discussed addition to this film is Leonardo DiCaprio. Calvin Candie is a time bomb. Once he finally explodes, you're already hooked on the character. He's an enraged lunatic with a bitter and slimy quality to him that you can't help but love and DiCaprio does a magnificent job. Some have pointed out that DiCaprio has done better work in the past and that may be true, but he's never portrayed a ruthless villain of this caliber. Christoph Waltz is as enjoyable and as delightful as ever. Schultz kills people and collects corpses for money, which sounds like it could have a pretty negative affect on a man. But Schultz is always happy and charming. Reading his body language is like finding another spectacular performance within another. Samuel L. Jackson is an interesting addition as the sneaky and smart-mouthed Stephen. He's a free man like Django who chooses to work for Candie and has a sneaking suspicion about Django right from the start. His constant complaining and smooth line delivery have a good portion of the comic relief resting solely on Jackson's shoulders, which he carries with ease. Jamie Foxx portrays a man who is never swayed of his goals. He's so determined and sometimes lets his desire for revenge get the best of him, but he truly comes to life in the second half of the film.<br /><br />This may be the funniest Tarantino film to date. During the raid sequence, there's this entire conversation of how the torch carrying mob can't see through their white hoods that is just flat out hysterical. Django picking out his clothes for the first time will get a lot of laughs as will just about everything that comes out of Samuel L. Jackson's mouth. But the humor is sprinkled onto this super violent and catastrophic adventure. With all of the whipping, branding, fights to the death, and being ripped apart by dogs, \\"Django Unchained\\" puts you on edge just as often as it makes you laugh uncontrollably. It's similar to \\"Killer Joe\\" in that aspect, but not nearly as disturbing. The unflinching ripped apart by dogs sequence is horrific beauty.<br /><br />Laughing this hard and this much during a Tarantino film has never felt so natural. While many may make the argument that this isn't the best Tarantino effort, it's certainly the most entertaining. Featuring a well-known cast that doesn't disappoint, buckets of blood that will have you checking your shoes on the way out of the theater to make sure you didn't step in any during the picture, and a final product that is just amusing as hell from beginning to end, \\"Django Unchained\\" is pure, nonstop, blood-soaked ecstasy that is satisfying in absolutely every way.ut Django right from the start.

B002N5N4M6|5.0|I have been a professor for 42 years, and I have had an interest in the Ring Trilogy, Star Trek, and Star Wars, etc.  Nedless to say I identify (somewhat) with the nerdy professors.  I have spent most of my life in an academic setting and consequently know something about professional egos and such minor things as battles over resources and office space.  I find the writing for the most part very good.  To me, the best parts of comedy are when Sheldon and Penny come into conflict. Strangely enough the show has also piqued my interest in theoretical physics.  I have watched most of the episodes several times, but they bear watching (to me) over and over.

0316069434|5.0|Harry Bosch is my favorite detective.  He is a believable human being who has his good and maybe not-so-good attributes.  However, he is committed to doing his very best to solve his cases. &#34;The Black Box&#34; is a perfect example of this commitment as he tackles a twenty-year-old case.  Harry is also the father of a teen-age daughter living with him, which is a commitment of its own.<br /><br />If you are not familiar with Harry Bosch, jump right in with this book.  After you've read it, you'll then want to read all of Michael Connelly's earlier Harry Bosch novels.  Enjoy!

I don't care how nice the graphics are when playing the game royally stinks. The physics are garbage and unrealistic. That should say it all considering that's the entire point of the game, but the interface stinks, the budgets are too tight and the bridges don't interact with the world. The difficulty is so high that it's not fun. Take it from Angry Birds, having only one way to complete a level is just frustrating, not entertaining.<br /><br />X Construction is the better, more fun and entertaining version of this with fun levels, realistic physics, and gives the player a sense of discovery while playing it.
B0076DELIG|5.0|If  readers are familiar with Harry Bosch, they won't want to miss this one.  Michael Connelly's characters are so well developed but Harry Bosch is a very special one.  When reading about Harry, It's like visiting with an old friend, you really don't want the visit to end.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Sleep number bed ads are annoying, but the game itself is quite fun. It is almost as fun as AB.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book. I've read it five time and still love it. Though it has a slow start it gets better
B008OHV6QI|5.0|You Just Can Never Go Wrong With An OTIS GRAND cd but this one also features blues phenom \\"MONSTER MIKE WELCH on several cuts!! Will write more later after I ingest this A bit longer.. Stay Tuned./////...  Well OK,I'm Back after collecting my thoughts of what Otis Has Given us here..There's Bluesy Electric Guitar In Abundance, Great foot tappin'songs remanisant of the R&B feel but so much better with the great voice of \\"Sugar Ray Norcia\\" & the Extended Guitar solo's thanks to the winner of \\"THE BEST BLUES GUITARIST IN the U.K. AWARD\\" an astounding \\"SEVEN\\" years in a row AND the fantastic Mike Welch who shares solo's beautifully on two tracks! This is the way R&B should have been back then, but things always evolve for the better. This is a GREAT disc worth owning with two instrumentals, the disc contains 13 songs ALL worthy of keeping. I have had the pleasure of conversing with the big man himself about the fact that we on this side of \\"the pond\\" are \\"LOCKED OUT\\" of being able to purchase this fine disc & am informed the Distribution Co. is at odds with our Distribution Co. It's unsure at this time if it will be released here at all, You can't even get the distributers in other countries to send to our area yet, this may be a long battle to get this over here in all of NO. America,, I got mine through a friend of a friend and had to wait over a month to get mine , but I,m so so glad I got this truly great enjoyable disc full of winning tunes.. OTIS GRAND HAS DONE HIMSELF PROUD HERE!! Produced the whole shibang also. Thanks MR. GRAND for living up to your name (grand)and Title (Best Guitarist) Do what you can to get this jewel and ALL others by Otis.. no Electric Blues Guitar Collection is complete without every \\"OTIS GRAND\\" disc available!!!!
B007TNS6JI|4.0|this game is a great way to waste time when your bored. the online play is great action as well!
B009FZFONO|5.0|I can't for the new mid-season premier to start!  This has been an awesome TV show and I'm so glad that Amazon prime has the series available a day after airing.  And no commercial interruptions of course!  Makes it even better :)
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|You can't help fall in love with Arthur! He's such a sweet soul. The elf and grand-santa really make a funny pair. :)
0938045768|5.0|Man vs. Machine: Man won. Use this book to take your strength conditioning to the next level. You won't be disappointed.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|The Lorax is such a great movie. It's pretty funmy even for the adults and has a great message. 2 thumbs up. :)
B003ODIZL6|3.0|It was helpful for me because it has all that you need to look smart and it would help you for collage
B005VPRDAY|4.0|So cute and pink and adorable. Just a FYI not really a complaint, I assumed all pink legos wer part of the lego friends but this is not. They lego friends people are much different. This one has normal lego people that you can take apart exchange parts. Again no problem just a tip I learned with this purchase. :)
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this game......it's addictive, I can't put it down.  It took everything I had not to pick up my Kindle and play this game last night while we were celebrating Christmas!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Such a great movie from the start. The characters are well casted and do their parts well. Can't wait to watch this again!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I read this first series I fell in love with it. Its full of action and adventure and a feeling of being right there with katniss.
0880796863|5.0|I strongly disagree with the bad reviews I read of this product!<br />As a professional tarologist i am really enjoying the deck, and adapted very well to the lack of blue! The candlelight solves it!
B000069AUI|5.0|In my opinion one of the best Coldplay albums.<br /><br />Lyrics and music coexist so nicely. Recommended for a special someone
B008J34466|5.0|Love her words, she is a great song  writer & singer! You can't go wrong with The Truth About Love!
B009GED3HS|5.0|So exciting that the clandestine meeting is going to happen soon. Possibly this season. I love this series. This season is the best so far a lot of character development.
B0085RQLXK|5.0|What can you say but Aerosmith is still the best American rock and roll band! Just saw them again in Columbus last month, have lost count how many times we have seen them. You never can go wrong with them!
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|Hope Springs had good actors but it could have been so much better I would have thought. Some scenes should have been dropped.
B008ELUEQC|3.0|Love Rod, but some of the songs are a little slow, I had hoped for  more up beat songs! If you are a fan you will like it.
B004J64QSI|3.0|Well, although I enjoyed this 25th Anniversary DVD, it was not up to the level of the 10th Anniversary Dream Cast. Nick Jonas, as numerous other reviewers have pointed out, is out of his league when compared to the other cast members. His forlorn look didn't bother me as much as his lack of vocal training. Again, not a bad voice, just out of his league.<br />Although Alfie Boe is not Colm Wilkerson, I enjoy his Valjean, and enjoy the contrast to Wilkerson's portrayal.<br />I do miss the &#34;Little People&#34; that Gavroche sings that was not included in this DVD--it would only have added a few seconds to the running time, but it added a certain poignancy to the barricade scene.<br />Many other reviewers have complained about Lea Salonga's Fantine--I liked her portrayal, and didn't find her voice or interpretation lacking.<br />The technical aspects of this production are excellent, as other have noted. Unless you only want one version of Les Miserables, this is a useful addition to one's video collection. Now I am waiting for either a fully recorded performance with all the acting, scenery, and props, or the forthcoming movie, or both, to have a version which allows me to not just enjoy the music, but also get lost in the story.
B004K4AVAG|5.0|Born This Way is a great! Lady Gaga is a great song writer and love to hear her sing! This is a must have!
B00110K62U|5.0|There is a reason why this is called the &#34;Dream Cast.&#34; Even after 15 years, these actors/singers still blow me away with their performances. I just wish this DVD had included more of the after the show activities and speeches that were included on my old (worn-out!) video cassette.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|The first time I saw Brave, I didn't think it had quite as much pizzazz as the other Pixar films before it; After a second watching, I realized that this film is just as great, but in different ways. The film features voice actors not as well known as other Pixar films, but the cinematography alone will blow your mind for an animated film. Yes, the characters look cartoonish, but everything else (the sets, costumes, atmosphere, even the weather) look SO real and beautiful that this film is worth owning on that point alone. This film was probably the darkest Pixar movie I've seen up until this point; I think they were going for a much more serious and mysterious plot line instead of some of their earlier, &#34;brighter&#34; films like Cars or Toy Story. The DVD has some nice extras, including two short films and DVD Commentary. It could have used a bit more extras, but overall I am very happy to say I own this movie!
B0083P1QUM|1.0|Boring.  Would not recommend.  This is the last Cromwell novel that I ever plan to read. Poor,poor,poor, did not finish.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Compared to most of the other Marvel films, this one took on the most historic role, in my opinion. It ties in much of World War II history, the settings, costumes, etc. Captain looks awesome (Chris Evans does a great job, in spite of the fact that I had doubts about that actor at first). Tommy Lee Jones, Stanley Tucci and Hugo Weaving have very memorable roles as well. And the special effects were perfectly implemented; there was enough action to keep it going, and it wasn't overkill either. There weren't many special features on this particular disc, but the film itself is well worth owning for comic book movie fans.
0792163710|4.0|This has all the traditional themes; except fighting with the native Americans.  Big country, cattlemen v. sod busters, gunfighters, honor, integrity.  Great cinematography and music too.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I give this movie five stars because I am a complete comic book nerd. This is definitely a great movie for Comic Book people out there; if you're not into the comic book scene, or if you haven't seen all the Marvel Movies leading up to this one, this movie may not be for you. The DVD quality, sound, story and plot were all perfect. My only complaint about this particular disc is that it didn't really have any outstanding special features, except a short featurette. Otherwise, a GREAT film!
B000X5SPBI|5.0|A great turning point in the show.  This season takes the show from be just ok to amazing.  Its the start of 3 of the best seasons I have ever seen on tv.
B0034G4P80|5.0|In spite of having a somewhat Shakespearean vibe, this film is great. Chris Hemsworth, Anthony Hopkins, Natalie Portman and Tom Hiddleston all shine through with great acting. If you're not into the comic book scene, this film probably isn't so much for you, but everything from the music, costumes, sets and special effects were wonderfully done. I thoroughly enjoyed this scene and I especially enjoyed Chris Hemsworth's charisma as Thor; I couldn't have asked for a better pic. I thought Anthony Hopkins brought some serious weight to this film as well. Kenneth Branagh is known for Shakespearean work, and in spite of some Shakespearean atmosphere to this film, I still thought it was well done, well paced and a great popcorn flick for Marvel movie buffs.
B003L77GGK|5.0|Few things in this season was a little outside my liking.  I know however that later season bring them back into check.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|This film was awesome, but not quite as spectacular as it's former film, The Dark Knight. Even though this film has Tom Hardy and a plethora of other wonderful ensemble cast members, it just didn't carry the same magic that Heath Ledger brought to the second film. I still think it's a great conclusion to a much darker Batman, though, and since I already owned the other two films without hesitation, I figured I had to own this one too. This movie is definitely for all the action lovers and Chris Nolan fans. If you enjoyed Inception and the 1st two Batman films by Nolan, you will surely enjoy this one too!
B003L77G6A|5.0|Had many laughs and a great show to watch again and again.  Don't let the title get you its really about making fun of science.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I found this to be a very fun and enjoyable game. Definately worth the download. Great for the whole family.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|This is the cream of the crop.  Simple the best season counting all way up to current season on cw.  You have to see this season.
