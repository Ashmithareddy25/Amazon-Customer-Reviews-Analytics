B00004Y6O9|5.0|if you love smokin' rock with fantastic guitar playing then this CD has to be in your collection, simple as that. And for the reviewer who asked \\"Would you still like it if it had no guitar solos?\\" what exactly is your point? This is a rock album and rock albums have guitar solos. Imagine that! He recommends a Metallica CD, well, last time I checked Metallica had a guitarist that played solos.<br />This CD had guitar players scrambling to cop Eddie's licks. When this came out people went \\"whoa!!!\\" This CD doesn't need a whole lot of hype, if you like kick butt rock music this belongs in your collection, PERIOD!!<br />[...]
0143038419|1.0|This is a really terrible book. The first part, about Italy, is still fairly readable although you start to realize very early on that the author doesn't seem to have much of substance to say. Her writing confirms that just because a person decides to write about her emotional life, it doesn't mean that the description is going to be insightful or intelligent or, most importantly, even readable. A lot of the writing is of the personal journal kind--one section that immediately springs to mind is when she writes an analogy about loneliness and anxiety; the analogy reads like something written by a 10 year old child who is trying to explain to herself in baby-talk these emotions in an effort to deal with them--and who is also learning to write at the same time. That was the first time I wanted to stop reading the book.<br /><br />There is something quite false about her account regarding her improving mental health in the Indian ashram, the subject of the second part of the book. She gives the impression that she is making rapid strides in the spirituality department as if it is some exam she is preparing really well and frantically for. Contrary to her claims, it doesn't sound like she is achieving her goal of becoming a calmer person. Then there are these encounters she has with a Texan at the Ashram. These descriptions really made me cringe: the fact that not only does she admire the kind of intrusive, judgmental, condescending and cliched remarks this guy makes about her--the book is autobiographical and you really have to wonder how intelligent a person our author is to give so much credence to this random guy--but also the way she writes about them as if they're these out-worldly pearls of wisdom she is oh-so-lucky to have received and is eager to share with her hapless readers. I think I decided to finally stop punishing myself by reading this book when she started describing her dreams: some really boring, commonplace dreams which belong only to her journal--to reiterate--and no other place. Please don't waste your time on this book, there are many smarter and more insightful things to read out there.ate--and no other place. Please don't waste your time on this book, there are many smarter and more insightful things to read out there.

B001AQXZZA|4.0|This was a good book, that beuatifully intertwined fiction and non-fiction.  It is about a love affair between Frank Lloyd Wright and a married woman, Mamah Borthwick Cheney.      At times, it was a bit slow, but over all the book moved along nicely.  Mamah is a woman that was well beyond her time.  I have a feeling that we all would know her name had she not fallen to tragedy.  I would like to know more about her.  And Mr. Wright, I believe, has a reputation for being egotistical, yet brilliant.  This book shows a different side of him, although we still get a good taste of the FLW that we have all heard about.    What I found most interesting about this book was the fiction and non-fiction that were intertwined together.  I found myself researching his homes and the people in the book.  I became even more interested in the book once I realized that many parts are true (the end, for example).  Being from Illinois, I am familiar with FLW and his work, but enjoyed hearing about how some of his designs were created and came to fruition.  I will be sure to make a trip to the Dana-Thomas House in my hometown, Springfield very soon.

B001ER4CNY|5.0|This complete series box set comes with a replica of the 1964 James Beam decanter that was used as Jeannie`s bottle.

B000AYEL1A|1.0|I was a teenager when this came out and everyone went to see it. I was not very critical then, but remember thinking that this was nauseating. Barbra Streisand is undeniably talented but incapable of setting her vanity aside in the interest of making a decent movie. And the camera is cruel. She's too ugly to have ever been convincing as an object of passionate desire in any movie. On  stage at a distance, she could get away with it. In a movie like Funny Girl, where the guy was interested in her earning potential (and the director kept her monumental ego under control), her looks were not a hindrance. Her version of \\"A Star is Born\\" is simply a ridiculous waste of time. Don't like those kinds of songs, either, though I know some people do.
B0018O4YT0|5.0|At last! A director's cut that actually improves on the original!    The 1998 version of Dark City was a fantastic film (apart from the studio enforced opening narration), very inventive plot with lots of good 'reveals' throughout, also, the cuts were very fast (I don't think a single 'shot' lasted longer than five seconds) which propelled the story along at a blistering pace.    The new edit has an improved 5.1 soundtrack and the re-cut has slowed the film down - which actually improves it.  There are extensions to lots of scenes that round off each character's involvement in the plot, and the opening narration has been removed (hurrah!).  The picture has also had a major clean up that reveals plot as well as detail.    The new extras are also very interesting and a welcome change from the usual, boring, \\"This is how we did the effects\\" documentaries.    All in all, a better version of an already outstanding film.  10/10.
0060751967|2.0|I really could not get into this book because of the constant use of \\"Sheesh\\" and \\"Jeez\\" by the female protagonist and endless \\"God's Blood\\" by the main Vampire character. The extremely cliched use of what the author presumes to be a Scottish brogue also did not help. The clincher was when the over 500 year old Vampire discloses that he is really a virgin and has only ever had mind sex. Honestly !
B00188M5TM|5.0|Changeling is a powerful film. It tells the forgotten story of a working-class woman who brought down the corrupt establishment of Los Angeles 80 years ago.<br /><br />Angelina Jolie gives a strong, Oscar-worthy performance as Christine Collins, a single mother and one of the first female supervisors at the phone company who refuses to bow down to corrupt police when her son vanished without a trace in 1928.<br /><br />Los Angeles on the brink of the Great Depression was an epitome of corruption. The police chief, James \\"Two Guns\\" Davis, had an officially sanctioned \\"gun squad\\" that terrorized opponents with impunity. When Collins' son Walter vanished, the L.A. police were embarrassed by their inability to find him. To squelch public criticism, they tried to convince Collins that a young drifter was her son. When Collins protested, police Captain J.J. Jones labeled her as histrionic and delusional and had her locked in a \\"psychopathic ward.\\"<br /><br />Luckily for Collins, her plight came to the attention of Gustav A. Briegleb, a Presbyterian minister and community organizer who regularly lambasted police corruption on his radio show. Briegleb helped Collins get a lawyer and tell her story. Although the movie does not mention it, Collins' case led to passage of a law that prohibited police from incarcerating people in psychiatric facilities absent due process.<br /><br />Despite the compelling nature of Collins' story, it came close to being forgotten. The old records were about to be incinerated when a city worker telephoned screenwriter and former journalist J. Michael Straczynski and told him to come over and take a look. What Straczynski read that day was so compelling that he spent a year poring over city archives to reconstruct the case.<br /><br />Straczynski has said that he wrote the script to honor Collins: A woman whose \\"simple question, `Where is my son?' brought down the entire L.A. city structure.\\"<br /><br />Changeling owes its aura of authenticity to Straczynski's meticulous research; verbatim quotes from the files and direct testimony from the public hearings are incorporated into the script.<br /><br />The film's power also owes to its feminist message about a strong woman who refuses to be silenced by a corrupt establishment. The scenes from the public hospital's \\"psychopathic ward\\" provide a grim reminder of the horrors faced by women who were labeled as crazy for resisting male authority.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood was a great choice of director to tell this story. The acting is uniformly excellent, the plot presses forward inexorably, and attention to detail is exhibited throughout. The location shots are masterful in transporting us back in time, as Collins (Jolie) hops on and off streetcars in a convincingly reconstructed 1920s Los Angeles.<br /><br />Although the film closely parallels the actual history, viewers should be aware that Eastwood took some dramatic liberties, presumably to streamline the story and highlight its good-versus-evil message. We don't find out, for example, that the missing boy had a father who was serving time at Folsom Prison for robbery. Nor is the presentation of the infamous Wineville Chicken Coop murder case entirely accurate. Killer Gordon Stewart Northcott was indeed hanged at San Quentin, but the film does not mention that his mother was convicted of the Collins murder and spent 12 years in prison.<br /><br />For those who are interested in additional background on that case, it is the topic of a just-published book by James Paul,  [[ASIN:1436366267 Nothing is Strange with You: The Life and Crimes of Gordon Stewart Northcott]]. Former San Quentin warden Clinton P. Duffy also wrote about Northcott in his memoirs.

B001CC7PP8|3.0|After the first release of Psycho on DVD,the disc istself was crammed with wonderful features.Now under Universal Legacy it got released once again-but be warned-The film itself looks better,but not marginally.The Features are exact the same with the exception of a new Audio Commenatary and two new docs.As a Special Bonus you get the classic episode of ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS : A LAMB FOR THE SLAUGHTER.So decide for yourself:If you haven't own the first release this is the one to buy.Otherwise save your dollars.

B000YAA68W|5.0|Some UK reviewers have criticized Marjane for seemingly complaining that the Iranian regime tried to stop her and her associates from partying. I would not defend partying of this kind, but it is evident that these critical reviewers have not had the experience of living under a tyrannical regime. I would not wish it on anyone. To dissociate oneself from a pervasive and dominant foli à plusieurs is incredibly difficult and many people go insane in the attempt or commit suicide.     In fact this book and DVD is very helpful in understanding how many people inevitably react in a repressive, authoritarian regime when trying to maintain a personal integrity. If you squeeze a balloon in one place, it will splurge out in another - often in an unpalatable way. What amazes me is how dissidents manage to remain sane in authoritarian regimes of this nature. The author, and her family, should be commended for having done so. It also takes courage to produce an account of this sort.     I would unreservedly recommend \\"Persepolis\\", both in book form and in DVD format, despite the inevitable unpalatability of some of the content. It may be uncomfortable, but it should function a warning to us as to what could happen even in currently 'democratic' states unless we face reality now and stop engaging in denial.
B00004CPXK|5.0|Excellent film... who but Richard Burton to play the Great Richard Wagner?<br />Nice also to see Sir John Gielgud and Sir Ralph Richardson.  Those who have studied Wagner, will see a lot of modern political views at play in this lovely film but his music is so refined that one is able to enjoy his majestic music dramas,  despite the usual attempted character assasination.  This film is worthy of recommendation to all who appreciate Wagner and his music and able to distinguish fact from excessive distorted fiction.  All in the fascinating power that Wagner evokes to all,  friend or foe.
B0016K40KY|5.0|I've been told over and over, that Sony is just about ready to release LOA... but, this has been going on for almost a year now. Does anybody have a clue as when (or, if) it will be coming out in Blu-Ray?    This movie is on a REAL short list for my all-time favorite film. Now that we have the chance to see it on a small screen, the way it was meant to be seen, what's holding up the process?
031606792X|3.0|My students are all reading this series so I thought, what is another 2500 pages plus to an avid reader.  I think girls are liking this series because they have such stresses in their life now. Almost like they are going back to simpler times when the woman took a backseat to the man.  I was wondering when Meyer's Mormonism would rear its head and I guess it is in book 4.  I am not finished with this book but I have to say, that Bella getting pregnant by a dead man, is, well, ridiculous. How she could even entertain the thought of having this baby is ridiculous especially with her dreams of familial and friend destruction  at the hands of a child.  Someone should lend her Rosemary's Baby for God's sake.  THis ruined the whole thing for me.  I was enjoying this as the series seemed an interlude to the real literature I read. Now, I don't know what to think.  I thought maybe Bella would be written as a bridge of love to unite those who bear hate to one another. I don't see why these characters love her so much but for the fact she is not judgmental. She has no passion for career, no hobbies, no deep thoughts, and is not even drop dead gorgeous.   Now with this pregnancy, I think the writer is espousing her pro life viewpoints on a younger generation. This is another case of throwing women back into the dark ages of not having choice or not thinking her choices through.  I hope I can get through this book cause right now I am with Bella. I just want to hurl my breakfast.  Too bad. I was really enjoying this light fantasy escapist literature.  A vampire getting a human pregnant. Doesn't even make sense. Even in fantasy one has to have things that appear credible if you have an open mind. THis is just ridiculous.  When Jacob said she won't have a normal honeymoon, I thought that perhaps he was saying vampires are impotent. But no. She goes and gets pregnant.  Argggghhhhhhhhhhh.
B000002NJS|5.0|There are more than a few sublime moments on this album and it was hard for me to beleive the style and lyrical stance on this album were coming from Madonna when I first heard it.  Wow, this one gave me a new respect for her, not that I was ever an 80s Madonna fan.  But really, this is a nice album and you just get the feeling that the artist is being true to her time in life, and has broadened - there's a more spiritual vibe (not preachy or over-done as the Amazon review seems to imply, but subtly and tastefully executed and with all the emotional depth that you'd expect of a superstar of her stature - or perhaps I should say with MORE emotional depth than I expected!   Electronica suits her well.  It almost adds a psychedelic dimension.  I enjoy this kind of music, at once accessible and sophisticated.  It'll get in your bones too, don't worry about that - well, only took me ten years to discover this album!  If by some freak of nature, you haven't yet, you're in for a treat I think, whether you liked 80s Madonna or not (and I never was a fan) - this album would fit well in any collection, and they're selling for the price of the postage on Amazon..
B0013URJTG|5.0|Well this is my top fav. band (along with SP) so it is easy to say I love this album.  I want to get a record player so I can start listening to music on LPs instead of digital cd's.  I think LPs are more suited for the original intent of the music.  Well this CD rocks, I love the way the bass powers on in the song Russia on Ice.  The title track is sooo sweet.  EVERY SONG = SUPER!!!!1111.

B001C08RHA|4.0|Great movie, my only gripe was with the packaging. It was in one of those small Amazon boxes that they use for books, and since I ordered something else (rechargable batteries) the box got a bit smashed and it dented the DVD case.

I'm going to be crazy until it does!!  This is a well written, fun to read, and totally fulfilling book.
B000I0RR76|1.0|I'm sure if you have an HD DVD player this DVD would be fine, but I ordered it not realizing that it was specifically for HD machines, a  mistake that could have been easily avoided if that was stated clearly  in the description of the product.    I did find the DVD for regular machines but it's twice as much!  Oh well, I'm ordering it anyway, cause I absolutely love this version of Robinhood!
B001GZ6QDS|4.0|It´s amazing how the Batman series has managed to reinvent itself time and time again. From it´s inception in comic books decades ago, to this, it´s latest reincarnation, it has never ceased to amaze the viewing public.    ´The Dark Knight´ was launched amid much media bluster as well as much public and critical acclaim. As mentioned in other reviews this is frequently a recipe for disappointment, however with ´The Dark Knight´ this is not the case. Visually the film is stunning and every action packed scene is superbly rendered, while never stretching reality too far beyond traditional Batman limits.    What will live long in the memory of Batman fans from this film however are the acting performances. Christian Bale is as good a Batman as we have seen in a long time, and who could forget Heath Ledger as Joker. There are those out there, certainly some amazon reviewers, who claim that the merits of Ledger´s performance have been exaggerated due to his death. It quite simply amazes me that anyone who has seen this film could say that. He brought a passion to the part that was breathtaking, as well as certain idosyncrasies that I´m sure will be carried on by future actors.    Older Batman fans will be happy to see that this installment is a fantastic addition to the Batman canon. Younger movie goers are also sure to be won over by it.
076531178X|5.0|I was drawn to Brandon Sanderson's books, as likely many of you were/are, because of his selection to finish the Wheel of Time series.  I am happy to say that after reading Elantris and the first book and a half of The Mistborn Trilogy I believe Brandon is an excellent choice to conclude the series (while no one can ever replace Robert Jordan, I believe that in Mr. Sanderson we have a worthy successor).  This tale of an immortal god/ruler and his empire and the people that would overthrow it is a fascinating read, pulling you in from the beginning and keeping your mind wandering back to the book whenever something manages to pull you away.  His pacing is excellent, mixing just the right amount of description and characterization with action, while he delves deep into the emotions and personalities of each of the main characters the story never seems to drag and it is easy to forget that you are reading as you see the tale woven in your mind.  With the passing of Mr. Jordan I have now found a worthy man to call my favorite living author.

1596912863|4.0|Austenland is the story of Jane Hayes, \\"a thirty-something woman in possession of a satisfying career and a fabulous hairdo,\\" who finds herself unmarried and harboring a dangerous obsession with the A&E production of Pride and Prejudice.  Her aged great-aunt figures out Jane's little secret and leaves something special for Jane in her will:  an all expense paid trip to Pembrook Park, Kent, England.<br /><br />At Pembrook Park, Austen's world comes alive with everyone taking on a different \\"character\\" and every detail of Victorian life painstakingly reproduced (right down to the corsets!).  It is quite funny to follow Jane's slow conversion to playing along with things, and read about her internal struggle between fantasy and reality.  I laughed out loud several times, and found myself smiling through nearly the entire reading.<br /><br />If this book hasn't been optioned as a film yet, it should be.  PRONTO!  That way I can eventually put the DVD right next to my own copy of the A&E masterpiece and have more outlets for my own Austen addiction!

B00005JL78|4.0|Okay, I'll fess up.  I am *not* a Tom Cruise fan; not be a long shot.  Every movie I've ever seen in which he stars, he acts pretty much the same; only the movie subject matter and dialog change.    However, there are a few scenes in this movie (especially with his son) where he seems to at least somewhat break out of his usual limited range Top Gun/Mission Impossible/Etc. character.    As for the movie itself, I won't bore you with spoilers or a long list of plot faults.  There are two things, though, that really bug me.  The first has to do with the status of his security clearance: it never changes.  It should have been revoked when he was accused of the pre-crime or soon thereafter.  Second, near the end of the movie he is arrested and charged with not only the original pre-crime intent to murder, but an actual second murder of a key character.  It wouldn't make sense for him to commit the murder, wipe down the gun, and then leave it at the murder scene in plain sight.    Otherwise, it's a enjoyable flick to watch, and does raise some very interesting questions.
B001F12J3Y|3.0|This is a great holiday film. I saw the original 3D at the IMAX theater and it was stunning to say the least. I did have my hopes high for this Blu-ray release. After all, Blu-ray is high quality and with an HD TV, it has to be good, correct? Well, the quality is not nearly as good as the IMAX showing. It's not perfectly aligned while watching it. The color is somewhat subtle because of the Red/Cyan glasses and how it is viewed. If you do buy this 3D copy, the disc also has the regular 2D film on it. I wasn't impressed at all, but with all of that said, I do feel people will still enjoy it. It does show some depth, but if you loved IMAX, don't expect the same effect here.
B001BR5F4C|5.0|I loved these films when they were shown on the big screen but was disappointed by the DVD release. However, the Blu-Ray version restored my delight with these films. The transfer is excellent and sometimes startling in their clarity and impact. Highly recommended.
0307455874|5.0|At the heart of Barack Obama's book is a strong desire to clean up our system of democracy once and for all. He latched onto the cultural shift of a new generation that is demanding grand changes. Luckily this message, brilliantly articulated in this book, has aligned with a movement to elect Barack as President. True to his words, his campaign was an expansion of the very ideas and passion found in his writing style. As Americans we have waited long for a leader who can craft such a strong vision, his insights and contemplations touched a warm artery of optimism and patriotism previously dormant. With that charge accepted, with that vision activated, we can relize the greatness that lives within us all. His speeches have been historic, his Presidency could be magnificent and it was this book that guided it all.
B00122M2QU|3.0|Let me start by saying I'm a fan of Max Cavalera Ever since Sepultura.  Now for the music but where do I begin? Let me say that this album is not what I have expected from CC. I was assuming that it will be like a flash back when thrash was king back in the mid 80's to the early 90's. I was disappointed by this offering from the Cavalera brothers. They even enlisted a guitarist from Gojira and that didn't even help. This album sounds like a soulfly album exactly and that what makes this album so discouraging. Two guys who are legends in the metal world and all they came up with is this. I remember in 1994 when he released NAIL BOMB. That album was fast, aggressive, and UN PC. He was really pissed off.  Then he left the great Seplutura in 1996 due to personal reasons.That was a sad year. But two years later he's back with soulfly. I wasn't too keen on the Nu-Metal thing with all of those special guests. I wanted only MAX and CO. But that didn't happen until the third album. That's when he was beginning to sound like the old Sepultura with a world music flare.Then it gets more aggressive as they release more albums. But that's where it becomes repetitive and this album is no exception. This album sounds like Soulfly lost tracks that was put out. I hope if they ever get together again it will rekindle the old Cavalera magic. But this album is sub par at best. This album is what talented people go through when they have a creative block. Hopefully they'll go at it once more and get it right. If Igor is up to it that is since he has retired from the metal music scene. Or has he?
B000SMWUPS|5.0|I love this holder.  I use it with my Mountain Buggy Breeze every day as I take public transportation in Germany.  I can fit a water bottle, sippy, 1 diaper, travel wipes pack, my keys(in the mesh zipper pocket) and my wallet.  It is a God send!
B001GAOY5U|5.0|I cant talk about the 3d version since I havent seen it yet, but the movie itself was great family fun.

B00003ETJQ|5.0|A beautiful planet inhabited by aliens. At least that is what I felt as I  watched the diversity of cultures,peoples and places so far different from my perspective on the world. One reviewer tried to draw some conspiracy theory about the film portraying western culture as bad. Like in Lothlorien in the lord of the rings. The only evil and fear here is that which you bring with you  There are images and sounds you won't be able to forget
0375826726|3.0|So, the good news is that I thought Paolini was a better writer at the end of the book then at the  beginning.  That being said, I don't see why things could not have been wrapped up in three books.  The pacing is poor and Paolini continues the habit he picked up in Eldest of plumbing the depths of the thesaurus to feed awkward descriptive passages.  It seems like the author opened up additional plot lines (i.e. the repeated curse, the old man growing peas), so it seems like the 4th book will be very long, some of these plot lines will get hurried endings, or there will be a book 5.<br /><br />If Paolini continues to improve at this rate, I see his best books are still ahead of him.  I will certainly buy book 4, but we will have to see beyond that.

B000683VI4|5.0|I don't know why I missed it at the theater, but a friend gave it to me to watch one evening.  My 14 yr old daughter watched it with me and we both cried all through the movie - not because it was sad, but because it was so beautiful. The kind of love this movie portrayed is the kind of love we are all searching for. This movie is for everyone who believes true love really exists. This is the kind of love worth waiting for!
1604590483|5.0|The Power Of Your Subconscious Mind should be required reading for everyone that's human.  There are countless gems of wisdom for anyone wishing to progress and become more aware of the power of the mind and how we think, rather than mindlessly marching through life oblivious to the vast resources available within each and every one of us.  The print is tiny in the version I  have, but reading glasses solve this problem just fine.  Some of the wording is dated, but timeless in content and applicable today more than ever. A Must Read!
B001DTPZNY|5.0|I do not rate this one as highly as Raiders but certainly better than Temple of Doom and Last Crusade. The storyline was great, even if a few plot devices were less than believable (a defect with all the movies) but for sheer entertainment you'd be hard-pressed to beat Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull. I wish the movie had made the Soviets more obviously evil, perhaps making the male colonel out to be an ex-labor camp chief or something. One of the things that made you root for Indy in the original movies was just how BAD the protagonists were. But still, an excellent film and one I look forward to watching many, many times!
B0000524CY|3.0|One of the scariest scenes for most people in this movie is the so-called \\"spinal tap\\" scene, however the procedure in which Regan has  a needle inserted in her throat, and blood rhythmically pumps out is an arteriogram.  A spinal tap involves inserting a needle into the lower back, and extracting spinal fluid.  It does not involve x-rays.      The doctors refer to \\"doing another spinal\\" in a following scene, a thought that is repulsive to Chris and with good reason: spinals  are very painful, as is the arteriogram.  Both procedures are usually performed with local anesthesia, but also occasionally light sedation or general anesthesia.  The doctors were looking for a lesion in the temporal lobe, and an arteriogram would be the preferred diagnostic technique for this condition. Nowadays, a CT scan or MRI would also be performed.  A spinal tap is also used to diagnose neurological disorders, and would have been employed in a case like Regan's.  However, no spinal tap procedure appears in the movie!    This is a well crafted horror flick, and like most horror  flicks, its premise is b.s.  A  suspension of disbelief is  required for the rational person to enjoy this movie.  The problem is that a lot of people actually believe in demonic possession.  The reality is brought forth from Father Karras himself when he says \\"it just doesn't happen anymore\\" and that all the old stories of possession were merely mental illness, most commonly schizophrenia.  Lacking modern science, the people from the aptly named Dark Ages came up with their own explanations.  How many innocents were burned at the stake because of the nonsense in books like the Malleus Maleficarum?   We can count ourselves  lucky we do not live in a era dominated by such error.    So, if you want a really, really scary story about evil in Iraq obsessing someone in Washington, D.C., you need only consider the Bush Administration.  Maybe Dick Cheney is the devil!
B0019CSXAM|5.0|The speed of the dvd was very good quick and well prepared for delivery,was not expecting the dvd so fast as I am in South Africa.  Just the delivery cost was a bit high.  Star rating from me is 5.    Thank you
B000CRKW9A|4.0|This movie has the look and feel of a movie shot in the 1950's.

0786948523|4.0|This Monster Manual shakes things up a lot. Like a lot of the new edition, it's about reimagining the old in a fun new way. Once you get to the good stuff, it's really wonderful. The problem is the good stuff is buried in the monster entries (scattered between the two to three sentence introduction, and the lore bits that give backstory to characters depending on how well they roll). You end up having to hunt around and end up missing a lot of stuff that gets buried in between big striped blocks of stats.<br /><br />There's not a lot written, but man is it tightly written. No waste, very efficient and packed with new flavor and background information. Just think what they could have done if they spent a whole page on each monster. Unfortunately none of the monsters get that depth of coverage--just a few sentences. That's it. They get in a lot in those few sentences, but it's a shame they didn't expand on that. It's one of the things I really miss from the old 2nd edition books. Now it's all statblocks.<br /><br />Each monster has several statblocks at different levels with different names. No time is given describing the differences between the various types of monster, in fact in most cases the name seems to be entirely about what level the monster is and what special attacks it has--rather than any particular role in it's society or anything. The difference between a drider fanglord and shadowspinner? Beats me.<br /><br />The art is good and pretty consistant, but a lot of it feels like redone versions of art from the old books--and some of it is copied straight out of the old books. Not cool. The night hag, or the deathknight for example, yanked right out of their original Monster Manual entries. When they redo one though, it's ususally real eyecandy. The lich, for example, or the foulspawn, or the new take on the lamia.<br /><br />I love the new ideas they're rolling out for fourth edition. Certainly the new Monster Manual gives lots of fun new twists on even the most boring of the classic monsters. But the format. Argh, the format. They really needed to devote more space fresh art and to talking about the monsters and less time statting up multiple versions of each one. Who needs six kinds of kobold? Certainly not me.sters.

B0000024TQ|5.0|November 2, 2008<br />Simon and Garfunkel's Bookends was a perfect album, no cherry picking necessary. These songs written by Paul Simon are comparable to nothing crafted before he wrote them and I do not think will be possible to match at anytime in the future. Among perfect albums (every selection a strong keeper)I consider Sergeant Pepper, Sweet Baby James, Tapestry, Rumours,<br />Turnstiles, and Johnny Mathis Greatest Hits. Truthfully, you might be better served purchasing a Bookends CD than one of these modern day hits loaded with three songs to be proud of. Old Friends is so intensely metaphorical and descriptive that when I was a young man as Bookends was issued, I kept moving fast forward to a time in my life when I too would be sitting on that park bench like my father before me. \\"How terribly strange to be seventy\\", I'll never forget that Paul Simon line. At the zoo is a portrayal of Manhattan's Central Park Zoo, a cherished hideout for me many years ago when I lived on New York's Upper West Side. It hits me so emotionally when I hear Simon's lyric \\"You can take a crosstown bus when it's raining or it's cold\\". America is a startling remembrance of when I went cross country with my friends in an American Motors Rebel. flaming red, and hitting such memorable towns as Biloxi, Nogales, El Paso and finally a commune in Mill Valley, California. This song characterized my voyage as an inquiring youth with such uncanny precision as it weaved an enchanting and evolving tale. If you are young, it is possible you are not familiar with Simon and Garfunkel. Take my advice and start with Bookends, you decide where you will go from there.<br /><br />Jay Adler, Music Critic

This is a fast paced, action packed adventure that you won't be able to put down. The book is not released in Australia yet and I am the only person I know of who has read it, it is very frustrating to not be able to talk to someone else about how brilliant it was.   I can't wait till Sept 09' for the next one :(

B001E7OO2I|4.0|...will love this album. It's not the same John that we have seen/heard before and it does not give off the same vibe, but who wants to keep listening to the same album over and over again? I feel that he was able to produce a new and different style and sound without losing his integrity as an artist. Isn't that the goal??? We want artists to be multifaceted, and John has obviously displayed that he is. He experimented with new a direction in production, he tried new things with his voice and range, and has some collabo's this time. I am a pretty critical/ and analytical listener and I appreciate what he did and I think the album is solid.  John is a very special artist and musician (also known as a beast):). His catalog is becoming more versatile and he will now be able to give an even better live performance! He named the album Evolver for obvious reasons...  This album is beautiful and fun during a time in this country/world that we need more beautiful and fun things...Thanks John

075640407X|5.0|Wonderfully written story!  Original fantasy and storytelling at its best.  Not the traditional approach to magic and swordplay.  The main character in this story is systematically built, experience by experience.  The hardships of life creating what looks to be a very weathered hero whose conscience more often than not motivates him to be a victim of circumstance.  Didn't realize it was a trilogy when I first purchased the book, but look forward to the next release.

B000ATQYT2|5.0|\\"Christmas is a good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely\\" --Charles Dickens.<br /><br />Attempting to celebrate Christmas without watching at least ONE adaptation of this Dickens classic is a bit like trying to play snooker in black and white. Each year I try to watch one 'serious' adaptation (usually the 1951 Alastair Sim classic) and also one parody. Of the latter, the 1992 Muppet production tops the list. Michael Caine is Scrooge, while Kermit the frog is Bob Cratchett and Gonzo plays Charles Dickens. I dislike most musicals. It's often stated that Bollywood is the complete reverse of the Roger & Hammerstein / Gilbert & Sullivan musicals because in India it's the dialogue that's woeful and music that's good. The Muppet Christmas Carol is in a league of its own and actually excels at both! The soundtrack includes \\"Bless us All\\", \\"One More Sleep till Christmas\\" and the wonderfully festive \\"It Feels Like Christmas\\". Here, the songs ENRICH the story rather than interrupt it.<br /><br />Dickens's haunting tale and the countless movies it's inspired are not just for children. Christmas joy is, in the words of Ella Fitzgerald, \\"for kids from 1 to 92\\". This is genuine 'family' entertainment... \\"For it is good to be children sometimes, and never better than at Christmas, when its mighty Founder was a child himself\\"
B001F12J48|1.0|Loved the 2-d version & the 3-d movie version.  This version is awful! Gave me a headache after only 5 minutes.  The scenes were either red or blue, no vibrant colors, uncomfortable glasses, double images.  I would not recommend this 3-d version at all. I do not remember the old 3-d movies but I thought technology would have improved since the old days,  I guess it has not!!  If you are thinking about buying this do not even bother!  I wrote a complaint to the website address on the back maybe if other unhappy buyers do the same we will get an answer!
B0010X745K|2.0|Let me preface this by saying that the special effects stunning and the acting was pretty good. In addition, I am fan of Stephen King's work and loved this story in print.

Stick with the book, you will have a better experience.

At first, John and Paul didn't realize how well he could write songs. But then they saw what he could do.\\"<br />This is not a quote from the book.  It is, however, a quote from Geoff Emerick after he heard a cut from the then unreleased Brainwashed album.<br />Don't expect anything like this in Here There and Everwhere: My Life Recording the Music of the Beatles.  If anything, George Harrison comes off as a no-talent, mean spirited spoiled brat who, apparently, didn't much care for Mr. Emerick.<br />The bulk of the book is an unabashed tribute to Paul McCartney, whom he apparently not only liked but idolized.  John and Ringo don't fare much better than George, so...unless you've never heard anything else about the recording sessions and think the recollections from the vantage point of a 16 year old is definitive, I can't recommend this book.  If you like any of the other Beatles and don't have an altar to Paul in your home, it will be disappointing.<br />I actually do like Paul, but the shots taken at the other three in this \\"memoir\\" are tough to take.  Ken Scott, one of the other engineers who went on to produce many other artists (including George Harrison) has publicly disagreed with much of what is written in this book.<br />So, in spite of glowing reports, and especially if you think George Harrison was a superb musician and not some knee jerk wannabe...well, you know...don't buy it.<br />Now, I'm going to amend my earlier thoughts on this and say that it does have some interesting stories about various recording sessions.  The account of Yoko in bed during the Abbey Road sessions is still hard to imagine, but the description of the final guitar solo blow out at the end of the medley raises the unfulfilled hope that it might have all worked out in \\"the end\\".<br />So, depending on your susceptibility to the bias, consider the book an interesting read, but still not what I, personally, had hoped for.<br />Good luck on your decision.worked out in \\"the end\\".

B0010YSD7M|5.0|Not having cable TV I was always a season behind on Stargate SG-1. It was usually hit-or-miss on broadcast television in my viewing area as far as airing times and continuation. Therefor, I was happy to see the final episode released as a movie. One of the \\"menu\\" choices even included a brief prelude summary leading up to the movie itself.    The movie started out a little slow, but soon ramped up into high gear as befitting this final episode. The effects, acting, and story line were top notch. To my surprise,they even brought back an earlier enemy that added an additional exciting element to the story.   My only complaint is that after purchasing this DVD, I learned that another SG-1 movie is available for purchase. So, which is the season finale?

1405051280|3.0|I really, really love this team of author and illustrator but unfortunately I didn't love this book.  I have almost all of the books that Julia Donaldson/Axel Scheffler have written and this one is my least favorite.  It's a cute enough book and story and the illustrations are nice, but it doesn't compare to their others.  I think she has a great rhyming ability and all of her books are great read-alouds because of it, but this one only rhymes in certain places which makes it a little awkward to read.

B001F7MSFW|5.0|Hellboy took me by surprise when the first film was released almost four years ago, with its blend of mythology and comic book traits created a truly unique movie. Now flash forward to '08 amd Guillermo Del Toro has now become a hot ticket following the success of Pan's Labryinth and much to my surprise, he decides to make a sequel to Hellboy, entiled the Golden Army. Most of the main cast return, Ron Perlman as Hellboy aka 'Red', Selma Blair as firestarter Liz Shermen, and Doug Jones as Abe, with the notable absence of Meyers but other then that one character, they are all back.<br /><br />The film begins with the story of the uneasy truce between mankind and the mystical creatures of the world, who hundreds of years ago fought a war between each other, which resulted in the construction of an unstoppable fighting force called the Golden Army. Hundreds of years later and the exiled prince of the elves has returned to claim the throne and launch war upon the human race, where it is up to Red and the gang to stop him before he unleashes the Golden Army once again and destroy the human race once and for all.<br /><br />With the recent success of his last film, Del Toro has been given full control over the film, injecting not only his deep sense of mythology but also keeping true to the comics roots, each scene popping with color and wonderous images that only Del Toro could do. Balancing well executed action sequences, crips humor, and visual effects, the film manages to be smooth rather then bogged down by so much material.<br /><br />In fact, 2008 has been a very good year for comic books, with the success of Iron Man in May, and the juggernaut that is The Dark Knight, Hellboy 2 completes the trifecta.
0810979772|5.0|I am a substitute teacher and aspiring teacher and am always looking for children's books that I can use to build my classroom library. I saw the book on the teacher's desk that I was subbing for and flipped through it. I would have never guessed that I would spend nutrition and lunch engaged in it and hoping to finish it by the end of the day. As a book itself, it is a wonderful book to explore. As a children's book, WOW! I find the reading level to be fairly easy, but the book does not dumb down any content. The actual format of the book helps children who might not be able to digest the comprehension of a regular chapter book , comprehend the story better in smaller sections than with a typical chapter book where the sections might be a tad long.Not appropriate as a read-aloud book to younger students, but a good find for individual reading.I look forward to reading the rest of the books in the series!
B001F7MSFW|4.0|It ain't easy being red. Hellboy returns in Guillermo del Toro's sequel facing his most daunting task yet--he has to prevent Elf Prince Nuada(Luke Goss)from awakening the Golden Army--mechanical warriors his father had created before the peace with humanity. It seems that Nuada feels its time to take down the human race but to control the Golden Army he needs to retrieve the three sections of a special crown one which his father has, another section was given to humanity while the last piece belongs to his sister Princess Nuala (Anna Walton) who is against her brother's decision to go to war. As with the first movie Hellboy (Ron Perlman)and his team mates Liz (Selma Blair), Abe Sapiens (Doug Jones who does the voice for Abe in this film)and new team leader Dr. Krauss (voiced by Seth MacFarlane of \\"Family Guy\\" fame)find themselves unappreciated by the humans they try and save.<br /><br />The latest film from del Toro like all of his films has a distinctive look and feel to it unlike films by other directors. Written by del Toro (from a story by del Toro and Hellboy creator Mike Mignola), the second film has a much larger scope with some truly stunning and funny scenes including the scene where Hellboy must face Wink a giant with a metal hand in the Troll Market and the stunning conclusion which relies largely on CGI.<br /><br />The DVD comes packed with a lot of extras. We get a commentary track from del Toro on the first disc, a tour of the Troll Market with del Toro as well as a feature length documentary on the production of the film included on the second disc. There are also deleted scenes and an animated comic book included as part of the package.<br /><br />The DVD looks extremely good with bright vivid colors and a nice, sharp looking transfer.

I opened the tray and re-seated the disc and it loaded. I was watching the film just fine when at 1 hour 13 minutes and 23 seconds into the film it froze for about 3 seconds and skipped to the next scene with NO AUDIO for about 10 seconds. The film then jumped to the next scene and the audio returned. After that I backed up the disc before I had the problem and it did the same thing again. Not Good. I'm taking it back to Best Buy.

I just do some free weights when I'm finished (2-3 times per week has worked really well). Erin is personable and not at all annoying.  You don't need ANY special props, just a coffee table and edge of your couch.  I highly recommend for fit, and \\"wanting-to-be-fit\\" moms to be!
B001ED7C58|5.0|I bought the CD and downloaded it on iTunes for the 3 bonus tracks.  Great ... fabulous ... terrific.  The mixture of bands is good.  Each song unique.  I really like Blue Foundation, Muse, Paramore, Perry Farrell and Rob Pattison's songs. Bella's Lullaby is growing on me ... I'll be hooked after I listen to it a few more times. Can't wait to hear the songs in the movie.

B000000WIG|5.0|Gary Moore is one of those unsung guitar heroes, of which we have far too many of in this world.  His guitar playing is impeccable; all one has to do is listen to his great \\"I've Still Got The Blues (For You)\\" to understand and appreciate the fluidity and soaring guitar licks.  He is truly a master at his craft, but a guitarist nonetheless that hasn't had much airplay, for whatever reason.      If you love good guitar work, ala Clapton, Vaughn, you will also love the work of Gary Moore.
B0016Q2D5M|4.0|No this movie's story line will not go into the writers' hall of fame.  I probably wouldn't have spent time watching it if it wasn't in 3-D.  But the 3-D is a LOT of fun.  I made believers out of my wife and mother-in-law who were very skeptical and initially refused to wear the silly pink and green 3D glasses included with the DVD.  But it is alot of fun to watch the depth of this movie.  In contrast to what some reviewers believe, 3D doesn't mean stuff is constantly jumping out at you.  It gives the movie depth.  When you look down the hole and it looks like it is disappearing back behind your wall, that is depth. The movie is filled with layers of depth which make it much richer than a flat 2D image.  Yes, the pink and green glasses mess with the color, but you get sort of adjusted after a while.  I didn't notice a huge breakdown in sharpness as other reviewers remarked.  Sure, it would be great to be just like the movie theater, on the 4k dual DLP projectors, but the theaters spend hundreds of thousands of $$ to get that set up.  If you have the dough, go for it.  If you are a regular joe with a big box retailer TV, this is the best they can get you, for now.  There are several technologies in the works, but they will go no where until public interest is peaked.  Go ahead and buy this DVD, it is a lot of fun to watch.
0061537934|5.0|What can I say about this book?  What can I say about Enzo?  Ultimately all I can say is that this book is one of the most inspiring books that I have read in my 19 years on this earth.  Never have I been more captivated by the imagination of an author than I have with Garth Stein.  This was my first time reading any of his works, and I must say that it is almost certain that I will read not only this book, but his others over and over again.    What do I like about Enzo other than his wit and charm?  His determination.  His understanding.  His ability to use his actions to show Denny what he couldn't otherwise simply tell him.  I admire Enzo's affection towards Eve and Zoë, and ultimately his dream to become a human.    I've learned a lot through this book about every day life too.  As Enzo tells us in the book, 'racing is about discipline and intelligence, not about who has the heavier foot. The one who drives smart will always win in the end.'
B000V86OKG|1.0|My gripe is not with the content; rather it is with the intolerable advertisements Showtime FORCES you to watch before you get to see what you paid for.  The normal menu-button and/or FF-key options are useless and you must sit and fume before watching each episode.  I am sorry I purchased this title from such a clueless, undeserving studio.  I will never again purchase a Showtime title.
B0019OP0GU|1.0|My daughter and I bought this DVD because we both loved the book by Noel Streatfeild.  But the movie is missing all the aspects that made the book so interesting.  The movie leaves out almost everything about the Academy of Dancing and Stage Training and the girls' daily lives.  It adds unnecessary romances between adult characters.  There is a lot of cigarette smoking and drinking in the movie, making it unsuitable for children.  There is almost no dancing shown.  The actors who play the three girls are *way* too old for the parts. Finally, (and this is a matter of taste but for me it was very distracting) the hairstyles are terrible.
B000803PKY|5.0|This was never my favorite JB album.  (That would be Late for the Sky).  Still, the sound via DVD Audio is so crystal clear and moving that I cannot stop listening to this version.

This movie was a real treat and I am sure that I will enjoy watching it again and again.
B00005K3NR|5.0|Stephen King is known as the `king' of horror, and `Carrie' is the story that made him famous.  In fact, it was after the massive reception that `Carrie' received as a mass market paperback novel that King was able to quit his day job; literally.  The film adaptation also received major critical buzz and reception, nabbing Oscar nominations for Spacek and co-star Laurie as well as a few other awards (Spacek won the NSFC award for her performance).  All the praise and admiration is deserved, definitely, for `Carrie' is one of Kings grandest stories, and Brian De Palma delivers masterfully with his big screen adaptation, capturing the very essence of King with each frightfully delicious frame.<br /><br />The film, and the novel, tell a story as old as time; that of a young outcast pushed too far by too many people.  Kind of like the `pre-columbine' school angst story, this film places young Carrie White in the hot seat.  Carrie is a social outcast, shunned by her peers, teased by the other schoolgirls and sheltered by her religious fanatic mother.  On top of that Carrie has just recently realized that she can move things with her mind.<br /><br />After a school teasing goes too far Carrie finds herself being asked to the prom by popular kid Tommy.  His girlfriend Sue asked him to escort Carrie to prom since she felt bad about the way the other girls were treating her.  Little does Sue or Tommy know but a few of the other kids are planning something tragically dastardly for prom night, but they will soon wish they had not crossed that line.<br /><br />Brian De Palma truly utilizes his surroundings in order to create a horrific film, one that is chilling and disturbing and utterly mesmerizing.  The film sounds like a horror movie, it looks like a horror movie; it nearly smells like a horror movie.  Every fixture, every article of clothing, every shriek of the musical score; everything breathes horror into each passing frame.  Add to that some brilliantly crafted performances that understand and embellish the whole idea behind the film and you have a superbly orchestrated horror film.<br /><br />Sissy Spacek is otherworldly as Carrie.  I'm reminded of Geena Davis in `The Fly', for Spacek just looks alienesque as Carrie.  Her eyes seem to bulge right out of her skull; her skin seems to grab tightly to her bones; her voice seems to barely escape her lips.  Spacek captures the supernatural elements of her character masterfully, creating something much richer than a mere tortured youth.  She understands that, while her character is supposed to represent the entertain struggles of modern-day adolescence, she is also supposed to also capture something unnatural within her character, and she does that magically.  Piper Laurie also manages to come alive in every frame as Carrie's insanely fanatic mother Margaret.  A true stab in the heart of religion, King created a character straight out of our nightmares, a mother whose idealistic values are far beyond those a rational parent.<br /><br />The rest of the supporting players all do their best to elevate the film, Travolta falling behind a tad (but he's rarely impressive).  De Palma, Specek and Laurie are truly the most deserving of praise for this film lies on their very sturdy shoulders.<br /><br />As far as horror movies go, `Carrie' is top notch.  De Palma's camera work is astonishtingly good, reaching into every corner and dragging out the chills and surprisingly emotional validity.  It is not very often that a film in this genre is able to tackle the subjects of abuse, acceptance, vengeance and religion with such poise and passion.  This is a good film; period.  The fact that it is a horror film is merely a bonusances that understand and embellish the whole idea behind the film and you have a superbly orchestrated horror film.<br /><br />Sissy Spacek is otherworldly as Carrie.

B000026OW3|3.0|At less than $30, this has to be one of the greatest bargains currently out there. For many lovers of Chopin and piano playing, Rubinstein's late 1950s/early 1960s RCA survey is the Bible. Undoubtedly, it contains some godly Chopin playing. However, there is too much unevenness and lack of drama for this cycle to live up to its reference status.<br /><br />Indeed, this is a Chopin Collection and not a complete survey, missing the Etudes, Rondos, Variations, early Polonaises, First Sonata, concert fantasies, chamber music as well as some miscellaneous pieces--most notably the Op post Nocturnes, Mazurkas, Waltzes and Prelude, plus the Op 45 Prelude and Allegro de concert. In contrast to the Ashkenazy set, this collection includes the two Concertos.<br /><br />Particularly Rubinstein's Waltzes, Mazurkas and Nocturnes are often claimed to be of reference standard (persistently so both by Jed Distler and the Penguin Guide). Indeed, some of them are excellent (the Opp 59 and 68 Mazurkas as well as the Opp 27/2 and 48/1 Nocturnes), whereas too many suffer from what I would call a general lack of drama--that is underplayed contrasts in tempo, dynamics and above articulation (the Waltzes annoyingly much so). Rubinstein tends to play everything in a similarly smooth manner with an unfailing beauty of tone; hence, the results are never less than comfortable. However, the individual imagination--and thus memorableness--of the likes of Ohlsson, Moravec, Pogorelich, and even to some extent Ashkenazy, seldom surfaces. At times, the adjectives tired and feeble may even be used (if truth be told, Mr Rubinstein was no less than between 71 and 80 years old when recording this collection). A striking example emerges when comparing the revolutionary Second and maturely bel canto Third Sonatas: Rubinstein is truly at home in the luxurious sonorities of the Third, whereas the Second is plain bland. Even more interesting is to compare the 1946 mono version with the 1961 stereo version (both of which are included in the collection), where the former completely outshines the latter in terms of dynamism and liveliness. This actually seems to be true in general for Rubinstein's mono Chopin renditions, even though I admittedly have severe problems with the very mono sound.<br /><br />Notwithstanding the above said, Rubinstein gives us truly spiritual accounts of the Barcarolle, Berceuse, Op 53 Polonaise as well as the Andante spianato & Grand Polonaise. Luckily, the recorded sound is surprisingly good considering its age and the label--in fact, if somewhat dynamically constricted, largely preferable both to the metallic Decca sound given to Ashkenazy's cycle ([[ASIN:B0000041KB Chopin: The Piano Works]]) and above all to the boxy and clunky Naxos sound in the Biret survey ([[ASIN:B00001NTN0 Chopin: Complete Piano Music]]). Again acknowledging the unbeatable value of this Chopin Collection, it still cannot compare with Ohlsson's reference series for Arabesque, recorded in the most glorious sound on an impeccable B&ouml;sendorfer instrument--due to be issued as a boxed set by Hyperion on 11 November ([[ASIN:B001F4YGUA Complete Works]], actually already released in the UK at a real bargain price!).ncluded in the collection), where the former completely outshines the latter in terms of dynamism and liveliness.

031606792X|2.0|....I had to stop reading this. Well, actually, I've been listening to the audio book since I am too busy to read for fun, so technically, I had to stop listening to this. @_@ I'm sorry but the whole imprinting on children thing.... makes me want to retch. My stomach lurches just thinking about it. I know, I know, it's the whole Protector deal but.... still- it'd eventually be like marrying your uncle or something. o_O Just... Geh. My issues were this was more like an epilogue story. There were no villians to really drive the plot, the first few chapters were the adventures in Vampy-boy and Emo-girl's sex life on a magical little island far far away where no one can hear you *beepbeepbeep* -republican!-*beepbeepbeeeeep!* (cookies to whoever gets that reference!) ----And while Meyer didn't totally go romance novel on us, thank God, the mental images still won't go away... And from there I was able to figure the rest out. I was like \\"Let me guess: they's gonna has a babie yes. Even tho that doesn't make a lot of sense that vampygirls are infertile and vampyboys aren't. And thens Bella ish gonna has some sortsa abnormal preggyness, yes. Baby gonna prolly reach maturity faster and be flawless yes. And..... What about Jacob? ......*ponderponderponder-REALIZE* ....Don't wanna think about it.\\" A few peeks at some Amazon.com reviews confirmed my fears. 8l<br /><br />So--- I couldn't bring myself to finish this. Sickeningly predictable, and man do I mean sickeningly, no driven plot since the villains were wiped out prematurely, annnd.... yeah. Oh, and the message was awful, too. Maybe I've been spoiled by other books like The Giver, Potter, David Eddings, (heh, these books kinda center on choices as their themes, don't they?)  but to me, books need a GOOD message to deliver. In all my writing classes, I had to deliver a message or drive a point home, regardless of if it were a ceative writing assignment or an essay- and I have read several essays (Plato's cave allegory, Jonathan Swift's Modest Proposal being some of my favs) which also have a message- I am digressing a little, but my point is when you write or tell a story, there is something you want to communicate, entertainingly or not. This series, if it did have a message, and I indeed think it did, it's a bad one: You are nothing without your man. Regardless of if he talks down to you or mistreats you, you need a man to be happy. Growing up and aging is the worst thing that can happen to you unless sex is involved. Forget learning to be yourself and face some alone time before you're ready for an intense relationship, forget perusing an education, in the end, all you need is your man, to be married at 18, and a baby. Yep.<br /><br />I think not. If I had a little sister in high school, I wouldn't want her reading this. o_O She could read it after a few years of college and a reality check, but..... egads.<br /><br />Maybe I am being too harsh, too judgmental, and take this too seriously- it's fiction after all. Pure entertainment. I get that. I DO plan to read more, but not now. I'll wait. When I first started this series, I liked the first book. It was the adventures of Vampyboy and Emogirl. Cute. Interesting. I thought some people were either too generous or too harsh in their reviews. But from book 2 (which was exciting but I wanted to SLAP Edward!) on.... I wanted to hit my head. Repeatedly. What ultimately turned me off though was the imprinting on babies/toddlers thing. *puke* I know the other side of the argument but still...<br /><br />I'm more reviewing on the series as a whole, but I'm also leaving stuff out. Like how I wanted to STRANGLE Jacob after a while! \\"I'll never hurt you Bella- *hurts*\\" then he comes crawling back with his tail between his legs- then it's \\"I promised I'd never hurt you--*hurts, insults her friends, betrays trust, hurts again, is a total *******, forced tongue kiss/ASSAULT!, etc*-- Dude, did anyone else notice a pattern going on here?! He's oneof those guys who kept backstabbing you then comes crawling back all apologetic, which is probably fake, meaningless, and just good acting skills on his part, and he goes on and hurts you again. And some people says he treats Bella like a girl!? Sorry but if a guy treated me like this, I wouldn't let him repeat offenses- he'd be out of my life the FIRST time he screwed me over. If not the first, definately the second, with a restraining order stapled to his forehead. Gals, don't put up with that! o_O Have some more respect for yourself- or you'll be a doormat!  Sorry Jacob lovers, but.... that's how I feel. I liked him at first, really, I did, but after he became a werewolf and his personality pretty much changed, I just wanted to kick him! I shoulda saved that rant for my review on Eclipse but... I had to get it out. *steps off the soap box*stabbing you then comes crawling back all apologetic, which is probably fake, meaningless, and just good acting skills on his part, and he goes on and hurts you again.

0312427999|5.0|In The Shock Doctrine, Naomi Klein's primary purpose is to challenge the assumption that Milton Friedman-style deregulated capitalism has taken hold around the world through freedom and democracy.  In gripping fashion, she exposes this notion as false and reveals the true methods employed by the corporatist elites.<br /><br />Powerful multinational corporations, along with their representatives in government, have instilled their ideology on unsuspecting people suffering from the shock of wars, natural disasters, and economic crises.  No part of the globe has been spared, including Latin America, Africa, Eastern Europe, Asia, and the United States.<br /><br />Despite being done under the guise of spreading freedom and democracy, the true purpose of the corporatist agenda is to increase the wealth and power of the elites in charge.  A careful examination of the methods involved will reveal the contradiction.  Any resistance to deregulated capitalism is met with restriction of civil liberties and, in extreme cases, torture.<br /><br />These policies have left entire countries and cultures in shambles.  Drastic cuts to social spending have swelled the ranks of people living in poverty.  Profits gained from extracting natural resources are not reinvested in the local economy.  The list of grievances continues.<br /><br />This book is thoroughly researched and incredibly detailed.  The argument presented is certainly not conventional, but it is very compelling.  I highly recommend The Shock Doctrine.

0307237702|3.0|After reading Dreams from my Father, which I consider one of the finest political autobiographies ever put to paper, I understandably had some pretty high hopes for this one.  Alas, it was not to be.  Obviously it's a different kind of book, but somehow I wasn't prepared for the extent of the boilerplate on offer.  Take the basic issue positions of any center-left Democrat in the country, write them down in a row, and here's what you'll get.  Obama has precisely nothing new or interesting to say here: abortion is bad but making it illegal is worse, religion is a great thing for many people but let's not get crazy with it, we've made a lot of progress on race but not enough, our politics suffer from too much acrimony, and so on.  It doesn't matter that it's basically all true; it's just that so many people have already said it that I see no reason why Obama feels the need to say it again.    Interestingly, I think the greatest weakness of the book is what has proven to be Obama's greatest electoral strength: his personal story is interesting but his political story really just isn't.  He's a standard Democrat who happens to be a little smarter than usual and a little calmer than usual.  There's absolutely nothing scary or radical about this guy.    I would be remiss if I didn't say a few nice things, though.  Obama is an extremely talented writer.  His gift for words and his emotional honesty, so effective in Dreams from my Father, are on display here as well, even if they are used in the service of not-that-interesting ends.  And the fact that he turns out to be just a regular guy means that it's extremely easy to identify with him.  When he describes his family or his love for Michelle, Malia, and Sasha, it's instantly believable.  His politics aren't exactly electrifying, but he does come across as a genuinely good man.  Maybe that isn't such a bad thing.

031606792X|4.0|All the terribly righteous and upset reviews of this book are pretty amusing.  How could anyone have read the first three books in the series and not have known that Stephanie Meyer cannot compose a single well written English sentence?  Her prose is astonishingly overblown, turgid, and repetitive.  Her descriptions of characters and places are vague and stereotyped.  And yet we read on...  So, putting all matters of writing aside, we're left with the plot, which actually wraps up all the loose ends in the previous volumes quite neatly.  I don't think she ever \\"changed the rules\\" while writing this final volume: it is pretty clear she knew how things would work out from the beginning -- and certainly as soon as the concept of \\"imprinting\\" was introduced early on in the series.  My advice: chill out and enjoy the guilty pleasure.
B000O78KW4|4.0|This is a good sequel, worth seeing and still manages to pack a few surprises. Great setpieces and one liners, plus some stunts that are well worth seeing. Good entertainment.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1906669023 Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys]]
B001JNNDEW|5.0|If they ever decided to make a live-action \\"Dilbert\\" movie, it might resemble \\"Office Space.\\"<br /><br />There's a lot of the same bitter surreality infused in this hysterically funny office film by Mike Judge (of \\"Beavis & Butthead\\" fame), all about three rebellious office employees who have finally had enough. Filled with quirky characters and a hilarious employee rebellion, this is a movie for anyone who ever felt trapped in a soul-destroying job. Which is just about everybody.<br /><br />Peter (Ron Livingston) spends every day in a cubicle, doing pointless work under the thumb of his smarmy boss Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole). His life is boring, and he doesn't even have the confidence to tell a waitress (Jennifer Aniston) that he likes her.<br /><br />Because layoffs are impending, Peter accompanies his controlling girlfriend to a hypnosis session, and is instructed to relax. Unfortunately, the hypnotist dies of a heart attack... while Peter is still under his hypnotic influence. And nobody snaps him out of it. The next morning, Peter wakes up happy and laid-back -- and determined to get out of his rotten job, and live fat and happy.<br /><br />He conspires with fiery Samir Nagheenanajar (Ajay Naidu) and the ill-named Michael Bolton (David Herman) -- two coworkers who are about to be axed -- to skim money off the company's assets with a secret computer virus. Only problem is, their scene is rapidly spinning out of control when the virus goes glitchy haywire -- and their scheme is threatened with exposure.<br /><br />\\"Office Space\\" started off as an early 90s animated skit, featuring the character of Milton. You know, that increasingly deranged employee who complains that \\"you took my stapler.\\" This time, Milton is a minor character, although a pivotal one. The focus is mainly on the mellowed-out Peter and his wild scheme to profit the downtrodden employees of Initech -- sort of like a crazier version of \\"The Office.\\"<br /><br />And Judge knows how to wring all the bitter comedy from this scenario. He creates a hysterical tangle of cubicle workers, layoffs and the most annoying boss in the history of film (\\"Yeeeeeeaaaahhhh... uhhhhhhh...\\"). There's a less interesting subplot about Peter's unstable relationship with the equally POed-about-her-job waitress, but the real draw here is all the corporate cheating and craziness.<br /><br />This brand of humor is twisted, down to the slow-motion, ghetto-style beating of the copier in the middle of a field, and Peter receiving a raise because he no longer cares if he gets fired. And of course, the dialogue is quietly insane (\\"Oh, and next Friday... is Hawaiian shirt day...\\") as the plot grows grows more and more tense... until you know someone has to snap. You can see who it is way in advance, but it's no less hilarious when it happens -- with disastrous consequences.<br /><br />The trio of lead characters are a riot -- there's Peter, whose newfound perspective about what is important in life is immensely entertaining. There's Samir, who can barely restrain his simmering rage at his rotten job, or his deep hatred for the copier. And there's Michael, who has a seething resentment that he has the same name as THAT sappy singer. As for Cole, he's utterly brilliant as a boss who is as endearing and appealing as a rake on a chalkboard.<br /><br />This edition is apparently just a blu-ray edition of the previously-released \\"with flair!\\" edition, so those who already have it might want to wait for something a bit more deluxe. Some brilliant deleted scenes, interactive games like \\"Whack-A-Drone,\\" and a featurette with Mike Judge called \\"Out of the Office.\\"<br /><br />\\"Office Space\\" has become something of a deserving cult classic -- funny, strange, and sympathetic to the ants that toil in their cubicles. When you aren't laughing your butt off, you'll be cheering on the disgruntled salami-slicers.sterical tangle of cubicle workers, layoffs and the most annoying boss in the history of film (\\"Yeeeeeeaaaahhhh... uhhhhhhh...\\").

140120841X|4.0|One of the latest gritty, dark graphic novels to be adapted to film was \\"V for Vendetta,\\" based on Alan Moore's futuristic comic of the same name. But as usual, the source is the most compelling.<br /><br />First published in the early 1980s, Moore painted a frightening future where there is only one man who can challenge the fascist system. Is he an anarchic madman, or a freedom-loving visionary? Readers will have to decide for themselves, but the story is a fascinating action story that raises quite a few questions.<br /><br />The year is 1998 (okay, pretend it's an alternate reality), and Britain is ruled by a fascist regime, and dominated by a shadowy figure. Order is the law. Blacks, gays, Muslims and Jews are relegated to concentration camps, where they are tortured with medical experiments and evil priests. The one exception is a horribly scarred man, who blew his way out with a homemade bomb. He donned a Guy Fawkes mask, and calls himself V, for he \\"has no name.\\"<br /><br />One night he rescues a young prostitute, Evey, from a bunch of thuggish policemen, whisks her down into his hidden base, and involves her in a trap-and-murder plot. Evey is both repulsed and fascinated by V's plots, especially when she is interrogated. And when an order-obsessed policeman closes in on V, both he and Evey must accept their fates.<br /><br />\\"V For Vendetta\\" is a thinking-reader's comic. Fascism and anarchy -- both concepts that Moore clearly understands -- are timeless concepts that pop up periodically throughout human history. So even though 1998 came and went long ago, \\"V For Vendetta\\" is an intelligent, deeply compelling story that still resonates in its readers.<br /><br />Moore's London is a rather dank, dismal place, apparently reflecting the government. He knows how to chill his readers with a diversity-free England that seems a lot like Nazi Germany. Even nonessential scenes like Evey's interrogation are absolutely harrowing. But he can also tug at the heartstrings, such as when Evey reads Valerie's letters.<br /><br />And Dave Lloyd's artwork is rather flat and a bit faded-looking, though this is not very distracting. But despite the ordinary art, the novel is brought to life by the solid characters and surreal illustrations, with V as the most surreal of all -- just look at that creepy smiling mask.<br /><br />At first glance, V is a vigilante hero in the tradition of Zorro -- the government is oppressive, and he's trying to take it down. But V is not a plaster hero, and his actions can be very morally ambiguous. Is he a hero or a madman? Did those experiments make him psychotic, or did they just give him courage? Moore leaves it up to our imaginations what he is. By the end, V has become less a person than an ideal.<br /><br />\\"V For Vendetta\\" is a memorable, somewhat frightening graphic novel, which will leave you thinking about what you might do in such a world.

B001DHXT20|3.0|There are very good special effects and plenty of action. However, there is a disconnect with Hulk, the first movie. There are new actors, and a changed recap of part 1.

B001GAOY5U|5.0|Was expecting not so great performance after reading other reviews and experiencing other 3D DVD movies. But this blu-ray version of this movie is simply superb. I am not sure if it is because it was Blu-ray because my earlier experiences were with the Shrek DVD in 3D. Wish there was an easier way to get hold of more 3D glasses as the Movie came with 4 pairs. Will be an interesting movie to watch for the kids when you have a movie night for your kids and their friends over at your home.

B001ED7C58|5.0|Usually I don't buy a cd untill I've heard some samples of the songs, but I got a pre-order by a leap of faith just like I did the books.  I wasn't dissappointed by either one.  If you like alternative rock and rock bands in general, then you're going to like this album.  My wife likes country and she even likes it.     I think my favorites are \\"Decode\\", \\"I Caught Myself\\", \\"Full Moon\\",\\"Leave out All The Rest\\", \\"Tremble for My Beloved\\",\\"Flightless Bird,American Mouth\\", and of course \\"Bella's Lulluby\\".    I like these songs because I think they capture the atmosphere of Twilight.  They're a little slower than I usually like, but  they really fit the books and I think they will the movie.   I really like Carter Buwell's version of \\"Bella's Lulliby\\", but I wish I had gotten a chance to hear Robert Pattinsons version.  Maybe it will be in the special features of the dvd.
0425220931|5.0|This book is truly worth the value. There are other comments about this book being \\"warmed over new age cliche\\", but Victor Wooten is a bassist and not a philosopher. This book is clearly intended for a wide range of people with varied backgrounds and belief systems.     This book is an easy read for anyone, high school kids, adults, musicians, virtuosos, fans, and so on.     I was very pleasantly surprised to find that Victor Wooten and I share many of the same spiritual values, but he also gives some valuable insight about musicianship.     For example, within the book you find the very reason why so many of us practice, practice and practice certain techniques for years and years but never really master them.     You'll discover the most important elements of Music that Music Theory leaves out and you'll learn the crucial elements to making any musician successful that is not taught in any school of music.     Victor also explains how some mediocre musicians are so successful and able to move the crowds. I've always thought that if I just learned to be the baddest player I would instantly be successful. That's not the case.     Don't let the simplicity of this book fool you, there are some very deep insights within the book that only come from many years of experience.     The book doesn't necessarily talk about anything new, but it does take you in another direction and can give you a new way of looking at things that you may not have had before. It can help you make those breakthroughs in your playing, practicing and performance.     It can even help you make breakthroughs in other areas of your life, because in reality, this whole universe is nothing but a symphonic of vibrations = Music.     Regards,  Enigma Valdez

B0016Q2D5M|4.0|From the folks who brought as the Chronicles of Narnia films, Walden Media, comes \\"Journey To the Center of The Earth\\", starring lovable goof-slash-action hero, Brendan Fraser.  (I watched the 2D version, by the way.)    While this film doesn't have the deep spiritual overtones of 'Narnia', it does enforce positive family values and encourages bonds of relationships between friends and relatives.  If you're looking for a good adventure movie to watch with all ages without being worried it's going to be really gory or filled with unexpected sexual innuendo and laced with profanity, I recommend this movie.    The visual effects and CGI are top notch, and you really feel like there is depth to the cliffs, rockfaces and caverns.  The creatures in the movie are very well done, and include a drooling T-Rex, luminiscent birds and giant pirahna.  Because 'Journey' was probably done digitally for the most part, they really enhanced the color palette, and the colors are rich and saturated.    The acting is what you'd expect from a Disney-type adventure movie...no academy award performances here, but the actors give their best for what kind of movie this is...a fun, entertaining popcorn flick.    Just one gripe...Brendan Fraser didn't look like he worked out too much to get in shape for this movie and had man-boobs.  On the other hand, the cute actress Anita Biem from Iceland,who plays the lead female role, is a breath of fresh air and I think we'll be seeing more from her in the future.

It is gripping, page-turning, and thought provoking writing and i loved every minute of it.

0810979772|3.0|Wimpy Kid author Jeff Kinney scores again with the Diary of a Wimpy Kid Do-It-Yourself Book.  My 8 year old literally did not put this book down until he had filled in all the pages of worksheets such as Design Your Dream House and Rules for Your Family.  Besides the worksheets, there are lots of pages of Kinney's comics and plenty of pages for your budding cartoonist to write his or her own cartoons.  I admit I was skeptical of this book at first. I figured Kinney and his publishers were cashing in on the Wimpy Kid brand without having to go to the trouble of producing another book, but this is actually a creative and fun way to encourage your child to exercise his own writing and cartooning skills.
0783233477|5.0|Released in November 1998, \\"Meet Joe Black\\" is a re-imagining of the 1934 film \\"Death Takes a Holiday\\" (which I've never seen).<br /><br />THE STORY: The Grim Reaper (i.e. Angel of Death) comes to take billionaire industrialist Bill Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) but instead decides to take a holiday in the corporeal universe by possessing the body of a young man who just recently died (Brad Pitt). Death's deal with  Parrish is that, as long as he's entertained, he'll delay Bill's death. Mr. Death emerges as a mysterious stranger with child-like qualities known as 'Joe Black.' His \\"holiday\\" is complicated when he falls in love with Parrish's daughter (Claire Forlani).<br /><br />This film is 3 hours long but is so captivating that it feels shorter than most 90-minute mindless action flicks. The plot is reminiscent of other good \\"fish out of water\\" stories like Spock in Star Trek, etc. Yes, it's outlandish but the film expertly presents the bizarre situation in a totally believable manner. In other words, this is indeed a serious drama, which nicely balances out the heavy moments with lighter (humorous) touches. I would compare it to \\"The Green Mile\\" which was another long drama with supernatural touches and wholly captivating.<br /><br />Despite its outlandish premise, \\"Meet Joe Black\\" consistently offers profound insights to the most vital topics of the human experience -- love, life, death and numerous others (e.g. betrayal, hostility, comeuppance and the mysterious beyond).<br /><br />One good example is when Parrish's son-in-law offers a definition of love to Joe Black (aka Mr. Death): To know the worst thing about someone and it's okay.<br /><br />This is just one example; the film is filled with such insights.<br /><br />\\"Meet Joe Black\\" cost $90 million to make and only made half of it back at the USA box office. Fortunately its gone on to garner an enthusiastic following over the past decade and rightly so 'cause this is a masterpiece of film-making. I consider myself a fairly manly man, but tears flowed through appoximately 1/3 of the 3-hour runtime. This is a sign of a potent and moving picture.<br /><br />I can't explain why \\"Meet Joe Black\\" initially failed at the box office; perhaps it was the nondescript title. All I know is that it's a travesty that silly drek like \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" makes gazillions of dollars and garbage like \\"American Beauty\\" are hailed as masterpieces while true gems like \\"Joe Black\\" are basically passed over. The good thing is that time was on Joe Black's side. The word got out.<br /><br />\\"Meet Joe Black\\" is the definition of why films are made.<br /><br />Personal Rating: Ayself a fairly manly man, but tears flowed through appoximately 1/3 of the 3-hour runtime.

1433502410|5.0|LEADER TIMES WEEKEND RELIGION ARTICLE FOR   November 8, 2008 by William H. Scarle. Jr. - 813-835-0129    The Bible I have used for preaching and teaching since I bought it in 1985 is finally beginning to look a bit ragged.  Some of the pages are falling out.  Its Monaco leather cover is patched with blue masking tape.  I just felt it was time to get a new one.      I have kept most of my old Bibles.  They are on a shelf directly behind me at the computer desk.  The earliest one is a New Testament given me by my Sunday School teacher Walter Smith and signed by him at Christmas of 1948.  It is a \\"Christian Workers New Testament,\\" and has underlined verses in red that can be used in speaking to others about our faith and our salvation.      The next in line is a Scofield Reference Bible given me by my parents on my birthday in 1952.  My birthday is on August 10, so I was home working as an electrician at the time.  The following month I returned for my last year at Dickinson College.  Then it was marriage on the fifteenth of August, 1953 and off to Fuller Theological Seminary.   The inscription in it is written by my Mother.  It is from II Timothy 4:2 and Titus 2:7 - 8.  The Timothy passage states simply, \\"Preach the word.\\"    The next one is a Harper Study Bible.  I used it through my first two pastorates in New Jersey from 1956 through 1979.  The editor for that edition was Harold Lindsell, one of my professors at graduate school.  It carries his autograph on the flyleaf.  Both the Scofield Bible and the Harper Study Bible have been rebound several times.  I was careful to keep the personal pages intact.    I have several other Bibles on my special shelf.  It is difficult to remember exactly where they fit into my story, but they all are marked up with notes, underlined, divided into sections for easy discussions on various subjects.  My great uncle on my mother's side left me his Masonic Bible.  It has the best dictionary and brief concordance for quick reference.My newest Bible is the  \\"ENGLISH STANDARD VERSION STUDY BIBLE.\\"  It is a magnificent example of publishing excellence.  If you are in the market for a new Bible I would highly recommend it.      In general the biblical text takes up half the page with notes and helps taking up the other half.  The scholars who contributed to the work number ninety-five.  It would be superfluous for me to list the merits of the work.  It is well advertised.  I will mention only those things that are particularly outstanding for me personally.    I am a highly visual person.  I love to see the matter under study laid out in outline, chart, map, or illustration.  Not only does the \\"ESV STUDY BIBLE\\" have these features in abundance, but they are located on the page with the text.  Time lines and maps are located at the beginning of Paul's Epistles so that you can see when and to whom they are written.  The maps are in full color.

B000EHSVS2|4.0|First let me say that I loved the acting and George C. Scott provided one of the greatest acting performances in a film.  However, this movie is flawed, fatally flawed, when it comes to the real Patton.  Yes, much is true, but much is from the perspective of a man, that we now know since his death and the availability of his writings, hated Patton.  That person was the technical consultant on this movie and his name is General Omar Bradley.  Without wishing to get into arguments on whom was right or wrong in a given situation since they were both typical generals and therefore prim a donas, the one-sided perspective in this movie always leaves a bad taste in my mouth. For example, Bradley hated Montgomery as much as Patton and would speak it but we never see this in the movie since Bradley evidently thought it would make him look bad.  If Patton disagreed with Bradley while under his command, he would suck it up while Bradley was known to complain to Eisenhower and Alexander about Patton.  Bradley was simply wrong about Patton's actions in Sicily.  Given the constraints Monty put him under, Patton did a remarkable job of trying to kill Germans as much as possible and limit their escape from the island.  And as we know, most of the German army escaped intact from Sicily.  At the Bulge, both Eisenhower and Bradley were caught with their pants down and instead of harping on that, Patton was ready to go with a plan that helped turn the battle into a huge Allied victory.  Patton was a meticulous planner who never sacrificed the lives of his troops for personal glory despite what the movie tries to indicate (once again Bradley's opinion).  Patton understood that the quicker the war ended, the less men would die.

The story will completely surprise you with its depth and complexity.

B00003CX9E|5.0|First, let me get one thing out of the way: Citizen Kane is not the greatest movie ever made. It is the safest choice for the best movie ever made based on who you're trying to kiss up to. The way the critics gush about this movie, you'd think Citizen Kane invented cinematography, nuance, good storytelling, etc. Whoever says that this movie is the greatest movie of all time has only seen fifteen movies. Check out Children Of Paradise, Scenes From a Marriage, Au hassard Balthasar, The Red Shoes, Rashoman, La Dolce Vita, The 400 Blows, The Battle of Algiers, Metropolis, Apocalypse Now, 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Making of Citizen Kane, etc, etc, etc. There are thousands of films that can make a strong case for being the greatest film ever made, so I'll just focus on the merits of Citizen Kane.<br /><br />First, Citizen Kane is loosely based on the life of Newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst and his rise to the top of the newspaper business. The story is told in a series of flashbacks that are each narrated by an old acquaintance whose account cannot--for various reasons including inebriation and dementia--be completely trusted. However, all of their accounts of Kane's life share a common thread: Kane was incomplete. Everything he bought was a substitute for Rosebud and his stolen childhood, which became fuel for his obsession for power and the love of the public through his newspapers.<br /><br />Orson Wells played both Kane and himself--a powerful and talented prodigy who had no sense of his own limitations. And, indeed, at the tender of of only twenty-four years of age, Welles had absolutely every reason to fall on his face. He didn't, he couldn't--not after securing the most lucrative motion picture contract in the history of motion pictures (for his time). William Hearst tried to destroy the film, to keep the world from seeing Citizen Kane; however, the film survived both Welles and Hearst, and lives on for the ages as a proverb: no matter how far you travel, you can never escape who you truly are. The technical achievements of this film are legendary. Believe it or not, the second disc, the Battle Over Citizen Kane, is actually better than the film itself. A film that is well worth the hype, though not the title of greatest film ever. See it, but judge it in the overall context of great films and think for yourself.<br /><br />author of [[ASIN:0759609942 Gotta Be Down!]]r escape who you truly are.

0307455874|5.0|. . .for it is neatly defined for all to see in Barack Obama's instant classic, THE AUDACITY OF HOPE.  Verily, we see audacity, and we have hope, because we have heard Obama speak; and because he speaks we have change; and because we have change we have the audacity to hope--of hope.  Indeed, let us examine the very perimeters of audacity:<br /><br />*The audacity of a relatively young man, only in his forties, having already penned two memoirs. . .about himself;<br /><br />*The audacity, pre-Democratic Convention, to design his own Presidential seal;<br /><br />*The audacity to rub elbows with the likes of Tony Rezko, William Ayers, Jeremiah Wright, Rashid Khalidi, Father Pfleger, and Louis Farrakhan, and assure the American people \\"it's no big deal\\";<br /><br />*The audacity to shamelessly and willingly plan a multi-million dollar self-coronation on Election Night, where 70,000 of Obama's closest friends will revel in rhetorical semantics that will have them shivering and trembling from multiple obamasms.<br /><br />The \\"winds of righteousness\\" are at our backs indeed; let us summon forth the ghosts of Constantinople and proclaim the Annointed One most sacred and on high!  Let us insert THE AUDACITY OF HOPE into the pages of the New Testament, tucking it neatly in between Matthew and Mark; let us be fundamentally audacious, because now the lion will lie down with the lamb, the fish and the loaves will be fruitful and multiply, and peace and goodwill will reigneth forever from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.<br /><br />Amen.<br />--D.

You'll be entertained by this, but you won't learn anything about anything. Also, the formatting has NOT been updated for today's wide screen TVs.

If you are not in hurry, just wait to get the best price.    -  Picture quality of the 2D version is not as good as other HD/Blu Ray movies I have seen.  -  Same RED/BLUE glasses like Spy Kid 3D or Shark Boy and Lava Girl.  You don't take glasses off during the movie.  Instead you put it on for the whole time.  If your eyes are getting tired, pause the movie for a moment, go to the restroom and come back.   -  I think the 3D here is better than the Spy Kid 3 & Shark Boy & Lava Girl.  It could be due to the movie is made on BluRay.  -  The story is simple.  After 10 minutes, the movie will take you to the journey.    -  This is the best 3D movie I have seen in term of the story and the enjoyment.

0061245097|4.0|The first book was good and this one is even better.  As the second in the series, it keeps going strong and adds some dimensions to the story that I definitely didn't see coming.<br /><br />Several years after the events in Halfway to the Grave, half-vampire Catherine \\"Cat\\" Crawford is still trying to adjust to her life without her all-vampire lover, Bones.  The years training her team of special agents to be top notch vampire killers have kept her busy, but it hasn't been enough.  And suddenly Cat is beset by constant attempts on her life.  This time, they're coming from both sides: the living and the undead.  And the only way to stay alive long enough to find out who's behind the attempts is to rely on Bones.  The only real question is will she be able to walk away again?<br /><br />One Foot in the Grave does a good job of developing the characters from the first book.  The emotions are harder hitting, the humor is even better, and some interesting revelations about Cat's heritage are discovered.  A definite must read for fans of the first book.

B001ED7C58|5.0|The best songs on this soundtrack are the two tracks by Paramore.  These songs rock.  Lead singer Hayley Williams provides excellent vocals on the songs \\"Decode\\" and \\"I Caught Myself\\". \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\" is another song that is very good.  The singer of this band has an unusually high voice, but it sounds cool.  \\"Tremble For My Beloved\\" is a great tune from Collective Soul.  This is a beautiful love song and one of my favorites.  I love the violin playing on the track \\"Full Moon\\".  \\"Flightless Bird\\" is a slow but prettty song by Iron and Wine.  \\"Eyes on Fire\\" is yet another slow song.  This song has a sensual quality that I like though.  \\"Leave Out All The Rest\\" by Linkin Park is another one of my favorites.  This song is sad but very romantic.  I will conclude this review with Bella's theme.  The piano playing gives me chicken skin.  It is absolutely lovely. I really like the music on this soundtrack.  I can't wait to see the movie.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|The first thing about my review that you will notice is that I do not use the characters names or describe what event it is that I am talking about. I do make it clear to you, once you've seen this movie, exactly what event I'm talking about. I deem it absolutely necessary not to give any of this movie away in my review as to keep the integrity of the movie in tact. That, in itself, should tell you how great this movie is. This, in my opinion is Day's best movie since he made My Left Foot. The movie starts off slow enough in the beginning, so much so that my wife and I almost turned it off. But after the initial 10 minutes of the movie (which there are no sounds or words), it picked up speed and stayed in the NASCAR hunt for the flag in the way of speed and flow of this movie. This one, once it gets moving, stays interesting as we follow the oil baron through his highs and lows of being a ruthless oil baron. The ending as with the rest of the movie, was well thought out and brought to us, the movie goer, in a Hope Diamond type of ending. That is to say that it is absolutely a magnificent ending where all of the main characters demon's finally come back to haunt him to the point of total ruin.     In closing I would like to emplore you to rent or buy this movie and watch it one night when your angry and spiteful. This movie will meet your anger and spite head on, and leave you feeling glad that your anger will subside even when his never did.     I bid you angry and spiteful watching and may your heart recover it's happiness even though his didn't.     Xilocane
B000FS9FCG|1.0|Want to know what Alan Moore, writer and creator of the V for Vendetta thinks of this movie? He thinks its crap. Want to know what Alan Moore, writer and creator of League of Extraordinary Gentlemen thinks of that film adaptation? Also rubish. Constantine? More rubish. Want to know why Alan Moore has sworn off Hollywood? Because they have taken his masterpieces of writing in the graphic medium and have turned it into basura. Its with extreme trepidation that I await the much anticipated Watchmen. Despite the fact that Moore has told Terry Gilliam, who initially was tapped to direct it, that its unfilmable. We'll see.<br /><br />What I do know is that movie is does not deserve to have Moore's talent attached to it. If you watch this movie and you wonder, \\"why is Moore's original graphic novel so widely praised?\\" then you wont see it in this travesty of his work. Do yourself a big favor, go find the original graphic novel, read it, compare it, then see for yourself.<br /><br />The only possibly redeeming outcome of this poor adaptation is that anyone with any half a brain will want to go to the source and read the graphic novel directly. 'Nuff said.

B00005JPO1|1.0|Aside from the major impossiblities that have been pointed out a thousand times (surviving in the fridge, Tarzan swing, and the list goes on..), my problem with the story is that introducing aliens goes completely away from what I thought the 'Indy universe' was all about.  Indy was always searching for religious relics, whether it was the ark, the holy grail, or the stones.  They weren't all Christian relics, but they were religious in nature.  Introducing the alien element just takes a sudden turn into another world.  I think that I could have given this a 3 star rating if the aliens had been some kind of Gods instead.  At least would have kept with the spirit of protecting religious relics.  Lucas seems to have fallen in love with CGI and forgot who his characters are.    I'm going to have to side with Trey Parker and Matt Stone...Lucas and Spielberg raped Indiana Jones.

'six feet under' i believe, was,along with 'the wire,' the greatest series in the history of television.  at this point in the series, it definitely deserves a 5 star rating; and the theme song \\"bad things\\" by jace everett kicks royal butt.  alan ball is a genius and is helping give television a good name, although tv is still a cesspool of mediocrity, especially the major networks.    it's now after the election and i thought to myself \\"can vampires vote and are they allowed to run for political office?\\"  i would prefer a vampire for president than a brainless zombie*, which is what this country's had for the last 8 years.  *i believe all zombies are brainless, but i may be wrong on that.  how cool would it be if obama was a vampire? hopefully, he's not a shapeshifter; hate to see him turn into mccain.

0307455874|4.0|\\"The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream\\" is Barack Obama's second book, and it is his personal view of the direction that the United States needs to move in terms of the type of politics we practice.  It is not a look at whether one should be liberal or conservative--though he certainly does speak to the liberal positions better than the conservative ones; but rather about moving away from the divisive politics which have become the norm in recent years.  The book is only nine chapters long, as Senator Obama goes into some depth of his thinking in a variety of areas.      The first chapter, titled \\"Republicans and Democrats\\", covers the recent political history which he feels has led to the divisive nature of politics today.  He discusses the difference between the last generation of politicians who could disagree with those in the other party, and yet still respect those people, as well as the institutions and the history of those institutions and offices.  He links some of this to the common shared experience of World War II which united many of the members in armed services, and nearly all of them in terms of shared experience.      I agree with this, but I think he leaves out several other key factors.  The length of the election cycle now has political attacks happening nearly all the time.  The fear which has often served to unite the country (civil war, World War I, depression, World War II, Cold War, and terrorism) has been tapped as a device to be used against the other political party (by both parties).  The newer generation of politicians still has the common shared experiences of their lives, but they are much more aware of how to use fear (among other devices) to gain money and power.    The advantage of reading this book during Obama's presidential run is that one can compare his words with his action.  Most would agree that both McCain and Obama turn to the \\"fear\\" tactic less than most politicians.  Both pledged to run different types of campaigns, and both have compromised on their principles in this area.  The clip of McCain being booed by his own supporters for trying to quiet some of the critical comments which he and Governor Palin helped promote is one which will stay with me for a lifetime.  Obama too has been much too negative on McCain, and attempting to use the fear of Bush to taint McCain.    The second chapter \\"Values\\", covers what he feels are common values to all Americans, and which might help bridge the divide between the parties.  This is an interesting chapter and it speaks to Obama's general tendency to try to unite rather than divide.  The world often views Republicans and Democrats as largely the same, though certainly we see them as very different.  This chapter helps provide the reader with the perspective that others view us, that of as being largely the same, with many shared values and hopes and dreams.  The people who make up both parties love this country, the \\"truths\\" which were the foundation of our independence from England, and the Constitution and its amendments which form the framework of what our country is.      Chapter three, \\"Our Constitution\\", is a closer look at the United States Constitution and how it can be used as common ground for moving forward.  Also included in this chapter is a discussion of the senate and the filibuster, which became something of a controversy when the Republicans discussed eliminating it to achieve their goals during President George W. Bush's administration.  Barack Obama also does an excellent job of discussing the issue of the Supreme Court and the differing positions on \\"original intent\\".  Key to his argument is the fallacy that the original intent of the founding fathers can ever be determined, and key to that argument is the fact that the founders themselves disagreed about the intent before the ink was dry.     Chapter four, \\"Politics\\" is about the institutional forces, such as the media and interest groups that seem to be pulling the sides even further apart.  Issues become increasingly politicized, making rational debate and discussion difficult if not impossible.  Perhaps one of the most interesting points he makes is that he benefited from mostly positive press coverage in his election to the Senate.  While is opponents suffered from scandals hurting their image, he indicates that many people feel that he never faced real scrutiny.  This perception has also followed him into the Presidential race, where several reports have shown that McCain has faced far more negative stories as a percentage than Obama has.    These first four chapters are the core of the book and the foundation on which the last five chapters address from different perspectives.  In each of these first four chapters Obama gives us some insight into his successful campaign for the U.S. Senate, as well as his other elections and how he navigated the rapids, sometimes more successfully than others.  He also deals with what he feels are the dangers of continuing down the same path of divisiveness which the parties have been headed down since the end of the Cold War, though most of his focus is on the way the current administration has handled things since he came to the Senate in 2004.    Chapter five, \\"Opportunity\\", is a look at his own opportunities as well as those of others.  For himself, he looks at how the decisions he has made have either moved him away from his constituency, or closer to them.  He looks at the use of private jets in both a positive and negative light.  He talks about his meetings with groups as diverse as the founders of Google and the union-leaders who were about to see the jobs leave for overseas.  The opportunities of others are focused on jobs, and he presents a short history of the private sector and discusses it in relation to the current climate.  He does not pretend that globalization can (or should) be stopped, but he does push for a new \\"economic consensus\\" and the need for education.  His views here have stayed consistent; though have become more defined, during his run for the Presidency.    Chapter six, \\"Faith\\", looks at faith and its role in politics.  Depending on your viewpoint, you may feel that he is giving the standard Democratic responses, or you may feel that he providing something new, at least in part.  For myself, it is the latter view.  He opens the chapter with a story about a doctor who is pro-life and who expresses his disappointment about the abortion view stated on Obama's web site, not because Obama is pro-choice, but because the statement portrayed all those who were pro-life as ideologues.  The story is powerful, and Obama's response to it sets him apart from those who give the knee-jerk pro-choice response.  Fundamentally, Obama recognizes that virtually everyone would like to see fewer abortions; i.e. that we all would like to see the conditions which result in a woman being forced to make such a choice reduced.  There are many of us who are not ideologues for either the pro-choice or pro-life positions who would like to build on this common ground.  That particular story has become somewhat famous, but this chapter has another story along the same lines, where Obama talks about how he had stated that his faith led him to the conclusion that marriage was between a man and woman, and those same-sex couples could have equal rights, but that it shouldn't be called marriage.  He discusses how a young woman was offended by this, because by saying that it came from his faith, implied that he felt that same-sex couples were \\"bad people\\".  Of course, Obama has not changed his view on whether same-sex marriage should be allowed, but one does wonder how that community views his position there, and if they still feel he is looking at them as \\"bad people\\".    Chapter seven, \\"Race\\", is the one which I found the most interesting.  One of the most important insights in this area, is his understanding that \\"white guilt haslargely exhausted itself in America\\" and the implications that has for society and race relations.  Also very interesting was his discussion of Mac Alexander, a black business man who was doing his best to restore his neighborhood, and his observations and experiences with regards to having jobs for young men from these areas.  There is a perception in some areas that drug dealing is the occupation of choice, rather than necessity.  His experiences in this area would seem to disprove that.  He has no shortage of applicants for jobs starting at $8.00 per hour.  This chapter also looks at the changing dynamics between Blacks and Latinos in the Chicago area.  His discussion of the move from the war on poverty, to the anger over welfare is also very insightful and worth reading.    Chapter eight, \\"The World beyond Our Borders\\", starts with a look at Indonesia, a country in which he spent some of his youth.  He discusses the changes there, political, economic, and cultural and the change in attitude towards the U.S. and the west as well as the change in our perception of Indonesia.  He uses this as an example to launch a more general discussion of the change in attitudes of the U.S. towards the rest of the world and vice-versa.  This then moves into a discussion of the post-9/11 world, and what Obama feels the needs are for the United States to pursue globally.  He talks about the need and the benefits to the United States to follow international law, and not act as if such laws are for everyone other than the United States.      Chapter nine, \\"Family\\", focuses on family issues, and features stories both from Obama's childhood as well as the issues facing his family with Michelle and their two girls Malia and Sasha.  He relates his issues with those facing most families, i.e. education, budget, time, and once again looks for areas of common ground on which to build.  Many of these issues were touched upon in other areas of the book, as there is a tremendous amount of overlap between family, faith, and the other areas.    Barack Obama does a very good job of using personal examples from his life and the lives of those he is close to and using them to highlight key issues which face many Americans.  I like his approach of looking for common ground, and one can only hope that he should use that approach to governing should he be elected President.  There is little doubt that conservatives will take issue with many of his approaches to dealing with the issues that American's face, but they may find that they have at least some agreement on the overall goals and respect for his approach.  I preferred this book to his first one, as I feel his writing improved.  It also contains a discussion of issues which face all of us.
B00127RAJY|5.0|All the reviews I read helped me to get to this DVD.  I just got the DVD in the mail and i still feel a little scepcticle.  I have never used a work out video before, but thought I would give it a shot.  I just finished my first session on level one and feal pretty good.  I have set a weight goal for myself for the month and it includes a high protien diet, so very low carb.  Today is November 4th I will come back on the 4th of December and let you know where Im at.  I hope this will help me in my goals and others who are scepticle.
B000NY12LO|5.0|I may be young but let me tell you that this book was probably the best book I have ever read in my life. It is written SO well and I love the little pieces of information that show what leads up to Peter doing what he did. I cried and cried SO much when I read because this book is so emotional and so much to take in. It is outstanding and I would be more than happy to read this book again.
B001DPC52C|5.0|One of the best CD/DVD of this band.  The only down side is that the U.S version doesn't have all the songs of the concert but the Japanese version have them all.  Other than that a must have CD if you like Within Temptation.

B0017R5UAA|5.0|I can't believe a group of guys in their early twenties created such a masterpiece from the starting gate.  I got this album on the recommendation of a friend whose tastes I respect and can be quite honest in saying it through me for a loop the first couple of listens.  It challenged me in ways I hadn't been challenged in a while and took me a bit of time to sink into it.  It does and does not sound like many artists I've heard before which is a testament to a band distilling past influences while creating something completely their own.<br /><br />I live in Seattle and had really been getting tired of the local scene here.  All of the bands were beginning to sound like knock off's of Death Cab For Cutie or The Shins.  While both are great bands, we didn't need twenty of them.  Fleet Foxes have taken this city by storm and it will be interesting to see whether they can gain traction with the rest of the country.  Part of me thinks they won't simply because they have a sound so wildly different than what is currently out there right now.<br /><br />I would list favorite tracks on the album but it really seems pointless to me.  The entire album feels seamless with each song complimenting the previous and next.  It truly is a record that is best digested whole, in one sitting.  Time will tell if they can build on this amazing debut, however, as young and ambitious as they are, I'm willing to bet they can.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|The Dark Knight is one of the best movies of the year with $528 million and counting and $992 million worldwide. This blockbuster should get 12 Oscar Nominations. I know Heath Ledger will win the best Supporting Actor. It has a good chance to go for Best Picture against maybe Wall-E for the big dance. It will return to theatres and Imax in January.
B00005K9LM|4.0|Judas Priest-Defenders Of The Faith ****<br /><br />Continuing on with the same formula from the previous album Screaming For Vengeance but with a twist. Everything on Defenders has a different feel, a more commercial sound and appeal, though by no means were they selling out mind you. Remember, Defenders was Judas Priest darkest album lyrically and feel wise since Stained Class from 1978.<br /><br />Defenders had some of Priest all time classics. The albums fiery opener 'Freewheel Burning' is pure metal at the best of it's power. A killer guitar solo from Tipton and some on point drumming. 'Jawbreaker' while a little different is a classic none the less. 'The Sentinel' is a priest epic complete with a incredible solo, out of nowhere bridge, and some of the best vocals of Halfords life. His lyrics of impending doom are also very cool. The title track as well is among Priests greatest<br />songs. 'Some Heads Are Gonna Roll' is easily in the top Priest songs, that is really all you can say about it.<br /><br />The problem lies in the rest of the songs. 'Love Bites' is annoying due to the slight synth use, especially right before Glenn and K.K.'s solo. 'Eat Me Alive' is just stupid. Not because of what it is about, that actually makes it a little better. The fact that Rob Halford had the nerve to write a song about that in his position and lead a million metal heads who thought it was something else is amazing. The song in general is not one of Priest finner moments.<br /><br />On another note, the bonus tracks found here are the worst of all the Judas Priest remasters.<br /><br />Over all the performance of the band is fantastic here for the most part. The production could have been better especially on the few tracks where the guitars get lost in the mix, but then again there never really has been a Priest album with good production value. Aside from a few minor issues Defenders Of The Faith is a great metal album and one that every head banger would be proud to own.
1433502410|5.0|I realize that for a lot of people they have the impression that \\"a Bible is a Bible.\\"  What I look for in a Bible is multidimensional.  First and foremost I look for the translation value, that is to say, how well the translation works itself out.  In the case of the ESV, they do an excellent job at translating.  Not only is it easy to read, but the language translation (i.e., the OT's Hebrew and the NT's Greek translating into English) is fairly competent.  That is to say, you dont see a lot of problems you might see in, say, the KJV or the Message Bible.  All in all you wont have trouble in reading this Bible.<br /><br />Secondly, I look to see what the extras are, and this Bible has a lot of very good extras.  While most of you might not be in seminary like I am, you can still learn a great deal of information from all that this Bible offers you.  There are more than just the usual maps and diagrams, there are intricate articles that help you to have better impressions toward what you are about to read and articles that flow along with you as you are reading whatever book of the Bible you may be studying at the time. The Bible is an intricate book because it is the revelation of God, ultimately through Jesus Christ, for all of us who are believers.<br /><br />I think that if you are in search of a Bible that will help you as you study and mediate upon God's kingdom, this is the Bible you should have.  It might not have everything you want in a Bible, for indeed you might want this or that in terms of background information, but that problem is nothing that a cheep lexicon or concordance or dictionary would be able to help you with.  Yes the price might be a bit high, but trust me, you are getting all and more when you purchase this Bible.  (Note:  you get to have a free access to Study Bible articles with the purchase of this Bible.  A lot of Bibles have that option these days, but I do like what I see in what these articles can give you the reader.)
B0006GAO5Y|5.0|If I could give 10 stars to a movie, I would and I'd give it to Rocky. Rocky is one of those timeless movies you will never forget once you see it. Sylvester Stallone did a fabulous job as the screen writer, director, and portraying this legendary character as well. I beleive Rocky will go down in history as the greatest sports movie of all time in anybody's book.    Rocky Balboa(Sylvester Stallone) is a young, new, upcoming ameteur boxer in the city of Philadeplhia. After coming off a big fight in his view, Rocky finds himself being pushed away by his local boxing buddies and his trainer, Mickey(Meredith Burgess). After losing his locker at the gym, Rocky takes a break from the boxing scene and focuses more on the local pet store girl Adrianne(Talia Shire).    While promoting a big fight in Philadephia, the current world heavyweight boxing champion Apollo Creed(Carl Weathers) is trying to find a new contender for his title. In doing so, he comes across a local ameteur boxer, the Italian Stallion Rocky Balboa.     Once Rocky realizes he is the number one contender for the world heavyweight title and believing he has no chance in winnig this fight, he soon begins training. With help from Adrianne, his friend Pauly(Burt Young), and his trainer Mickey, Rocky becomes ready for the biggest fight of his life.     Thinking he will just fly by Rocky, Creed treats the whole fight as a joke. Soon finding out that Rocky is for real, Creed realizes that Rocky is no fly by contender and sees that Rocky wants to be world champion. As the fight progresses, Rocky takes it to the world champion round for round and not holding up one bit. After going the distance with the champ, Rocky doesn't find himself holding the world title but something better. His true love, Adrianne.    Rocky is a great movie. This movie is great for everybody. Rocky is a classic. It forever will be.
B000003C2U|5.0|This album changed how I listen to music.  It has to rank as one of the all time great metal records!  Chuck was a god amongst men.  May he rest in peace.
B000GPIPSS|5.0|I bought this 2-DVD set for a friend and ended up liking it so much I got one for myself.  It is an excellent tribute to the Bela Lugosi classic.  You can watch this film many different ways on this collection.  The classic version, one with a different musical score (by Philip Glass performed by the Kronos Quartet), with two different commentaries, and with \\"monster tracks\\" which are pop-up text of informational tid-bits on the different players and scenes.  Not only that but this collection also includes the Spanish version which was filmed at the same time as the Tod Browning classic (Browning's crew filmed in the daytime, the Spanish was filmed at night using the same set).  The quality of this set is superb down to every detail--including the appropriate music accompanying the selection screen and the case that looks like a handsome, hardcover book on the shelf.  It offers additional documentary extras as well which I will describe in the review as most have seen the film and are probably wondering if this version is worth owning (IT IS!).<br /><br />The commentaries were conducted by film historian David J. Skal and author & screenwriter for \\"Dracula: Dead and Loving It,\\" Steve Haberman.  Both commentaries are very well-done and obviously were planned out, written ahead of time and rehearsed.  I enjoyed the Skal commentary the most.  He gives background information (sometimes gossipy) on many of the actors, production crew, and film techniques.  He includes symbolism and cultural references used in the film and also reveals scenes that were cut from the original script.  Haberman focuses more on motion picture politics which I did not find as interesting.  He also does not follow the scenes like Skal does, except to point out the ways in which the Spanish version is inferior to the English version.  The Spanish version here includes an introduction by Lupita Tovar Kohner, who played the female lead.<br /><br />In two main areas, Skal and Haberman disagree.  Skal prefers the Spanish version for its innovative filming techniques while Haberman believes Browning's version is more effective on all levels.  They also have completely different takes on a piece of cardboard attached to a lamp in Mina's bedroom.  Skal believes it was an oversight while Haberman defends it as \\"set dressing.\\"  I tend to side with Skal as, if the item was used to show the character was shielding the light of the lamp as she slept, it probably wouldn't look so shoddy.  This was a mansion with wealthy people.  Why would this rich socialite use a ripped piece of cardboard to create a night light?<br /><br />Several documentaries are included in this set.  The tribute to Bela Lugosi \\"Lugosi: The Dark Prince,\\" covers his film career.  It would have been better if it also presented some info on what he was like as a person and not just his characters, especially since his son is included in another documentary on this set and could have shed some light on his father's personality.  \\"The Road to Dracula\\" was hosted by Carla Laemmle, the niece of Universal owner Carl Laemmle who spoke the first words in the film in the stage coach scene.  It goes into the history of the novel by Bram Stoker and its adaptation to stage and screen. This documentary includes a recreation of sorts of Prof Van Helsing's final curtain speech that was later removed from the film.<br /><br />\\"Universal Horror\\" is a very interesting and rather lengthy documentary that covers many of the scary films put out by Universal in the 1920s and 1930s and includes freaky scenes from such films as \\"The Phantom of the Opera,\\" \\"The Man Who Laughs,\\" \\"The Black Cat,\\" etc.  I liked the inclusion of scenes from early silents.  It also reveals secrets to special effects found in \\"King Kong\\" and \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,\\" and \\"The Invisible Man.\\"  Film historians who were kids back in the day talk about what these films meant to them and the reactions of audiences at the time.  Bela Lugosi Jr. talksabout his famous father in several clips in this documentary.  And if all that were not enough, you also get to see a collection of posters and stills.  This 75th Anniversary set has so much to offer and is so well-done that I recommend it to any Dracula/horror film fan even if they already have a copy of Dracula.veral clips in this documentary.

031606792X|3.0|Bella FINALLY becomes a Vampire and lives happily every after with Edward, which is the point of the books... (at least from Bella's Perspective).  I think that she also made Jacob a little too pushy.  He was not my favorite character by any means, the book could have done with a less antagonistic character, although it helped show Edwards love and  patience to Bella's unique character.    This book was crappy compared to the other books... it was long, drawn out boredom.  She could have made this book 400 pages less and given us the same story and not wasted peoples time.      Overall:  I would have been content if I just read the first book and second one in the series... I was so happy with the second book (usually series aren't that good) that I thought they would get better and better... Honestly, I barely remember the 3rd one and I only remember this one because I just finished it yesterday..  Don't waste time reading the rest of the series, just read the first book..
006135323X|5.0|This book is awesome.  Basically distills a number of fields and ideas that most will already have had exposure with via living, school, etc - but does so with wit and great craftsmanship.  Points out our shared irrationality in a novel, entertaining and education fashion.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|First and foremost, this album is a very solid offering from the Metallica camp.  I won't go on to say fantastic, or exceptional, but solid seems to sum everything up.    So here's what I think, and please keep in mind, I'm just a metal lover, not some fancy-schmancy top-notch reviewer.    1) The guitar work on this album is blistering and fast paced for the most part.  It'll take a few listens to wrap your head around the full extent of their awesomeness.  I was a little dissapointed, though, because I (unlike many) was looking forward to the heavier sounds of St. Anger.  And yes, I loved that album, along with every other Metallica album.  I don't discriminate.    2) The drumming of Lars is in top form.  Just the right compliment to the thrash of the guitars.  Is it possible for him to play with more speed and ferocity?  I don't think so.    3) Bass, um, there's bass on this CD?  I could use a little more please.  Rob's got the ability, let him be heard!    4) Vocals seem a little forced throught the CD.  What happened to the anger/melody mix of St. Anger and even older albums (think Nothing Else Matters, One)?    5) Production of the CD definitely is a downer.  Even on my component stereo system at home, I get clipping.  I thought it was just my speakers, but nope, it's the mixing.    Overall, I like this record.  It's like a fine wine, the more time you give it (or listen to it in this case), the better it becomes.
1416562605|5.0|The conceit of Adiga's \\"White Tiger\\" -- told in the form of letters from Balram, a successful Indian entrepreneur, writing to the President of China to explain how he rose from poverty and became successful -- has been discussed by other reviewers on Amazon and I doubt I could add much to their description.  Suffice to say that \\"White Tiger\\" is indeed an excellent novel, notable as much for the compactness of its prose as it is for the author's skill in braiding humor and pain in order to deliver an extraordinary affecting read.      What stands out in the novel beyond the story is how Adiga succeeds in taking the vast subject of the rapid development of the world's second most populous nation and encapsulates it in this very personal story, drawing it down to a size to which the average reader can relate.  Thus readers come to recognize the vast contrasts of a society where so many are gaining so much wealth even as the vast majority continues to languish in poverty, barely surviving at standards of living little changed for centuries.  Adiga makes no effort to sugar coat their existence in the \\"Darkness\\" as he describes rural India, but even more impressive, he never pulls it down to a maudlin level.  The same could be said of his narrator -- at once clever, self effacing, confident, and fully admitting of his faults - never allowed to become less than complex or more than human.    There has been some debate about this novel's selection to win the much coveted Mann Booker Prize.  While I was cheering for another novel - Toltz's likewise extraordinary debut \\"A Fraction of the Whole\\" - I cannot imagine why anyone would consider Adiga less than deserving of this prestigious award.  By any measure, \\"White Tiger\\" stands out as a successful work, at once thoughtful, provocative, and endlessly clever.  Adiga's immense skills make one curious as to what he will next produce and wonder why any reader wouldn't want to grab the tail of the \\"White Tiger\\" and hold on for thissuperb ride.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I saw this movie in a movie theater, on big screen, so, watching this one at home may not be as exhilarating as at the cinema.And I tell you, I am not an ABBA fan, but:I loved it!!! Of course the plot is simple, and not be taken too serious, but the critics slamming this movie? It was supposed to be a fun musical, happy and sunny, and it should be judged  as entertainment.It was cute and fun. The scenery was so beautiful, interiors and architecture to savor. The movie has a refreshing simplicity. I like very serious artistic movies, but geeez! I also need fun! This one gave me a lot of fun, I saw it twice. Very energizing music, escapist movie, which brings joy and sunshine. I was never Abba fan, but I really enjoyed the music this time.    As for singing and dancing: some actors are not musical performers. And they still do great. Different set of performing skills is needed when a musical takes place on stage, and different acting is  needed for a movie. I admire some of the actors for acting and singing and dancing so well. Who knew Meryl Strep could sing so good, as one of the reviewers  said. I didn't know!     As for Brosnan who was criticized about his singing: it was not so bad. Some critics teared his flesh, laughing how much he was whining, how bad his singing was.(Outside the Amazon.com critics). Actually, it was a very difficult song to sing, and in addition he was acting and was trying to make the  song as expressive as possible. He got the most difficult song to sing.It reminded me of situation when people listen to old records of opera singers of the turn of the century, and than criticize them they couldn't sing. Without understanding how much of technical difficulity brings singing with such voice, and the technique used for it. Don't get me wrong, I don't equal him with the great voices of the turn of the XIX and XXc. Just pointing similarity of reactions, dismissing the performance without appreciating the fact that such singing is horribly difficult. I think he did quite well, given the challenge he had.
0345494997|5.0|Veteran journalist Nancy Horan spent seven years preparing her debut novel, \\"Loving Frank,\\" for publication.<br /><br />Maybe all first-time novelists should follow Horan's formula because she hit this one out of the park.<br /><br />It's been a long time since I read such luminous prose, told by someone who pays close attention to details and the development of her characters.<br /><br />\\"Loving Frank\\" is the fictional retelling of the scandalous love affair between architect Frank Lloyd Wright, struggling to make a name for himself, and Martha (Mamah) Bouton Borthwick Cheney, who, along with her husband, Edwin, commissions Wright to design a home for her in 1903 on 520 North East Avenue in the Oak Park suburb of Chicago.<br /><br />The story begins with an entry from Mamah's diary:<br /><br />It was Edwin who wanted to build a new house. I didn't mind the old Queen Anne on Oak Park Avenue. It was full of the things of my childhood, and I found it comforting after so many years away. I wonder if he reflects on those days now - on the fact that it was he who craved a place entirely his own.<br /><br />In addition to the extensive research she did on Frank Lloyd Wright's life, Horan also had access to ten handwritten letters from Cheney  to Swedish feminist philosopher Ellen Key. Cheney served as translator for several of Key's works released in the United States.<br /><br />It's rare for me head straight to my computer after finishing a book, but that's what I did after closing the cover of \\"Loving Frank.\\" I wanted to know more about Mamah.<br /><br />If you decide to pick up this title, please hold off going to the Internet until you're finished. Let Horan's beautifully crafted work its magic before  the story's ending jerks you back to reality.
B001C08RHA|5.0|I have no idea who IronMan is, I never read comics and do NOT have any extended reviews of this movie.  I can say however that I just saw it last night on my big screen downstairs and absolutely loved it.  The basic story line is a weapons developer, Stark, played by Robert Downey Jr is captured by enemies using his weapons to cause destruction and chaos through terrorism. During his captivity he invents a new type of energy that allows him to make some awesome new developments, in the process a villian is revealed that is initially considered his friend, this villian steals the invention from him and they fight.<br /><br />Overall it did not seem as long as it was, and was extremely entertaining.  Downey does an excellent job keeping us entertained and most importantly keeping my attention.  A great movie for your library if its something you are into keeping.

B001H5X7JS|5.0|Okay, first off let's get right down to the brass-tacks.  If you don't like crude or morally contradicting humor - this movie is \\"FOR SURE\\" not going to please you.  Bible-thumpers & mentally-challenged sensitive individuals need not read any further.  For those of you who look for movies that are breaking new ground with offensive & `out of line' material \\"FOR SURE\\" this movie is for you.<br /><br />For the first time in a `really' long time, I found myself wanting to rewind the whole movie and watch it again right after my first viewing.  I'm not even that big of a Ben Stiller fan, and I was completely overtaken with shock and awe used with the humor in Tropic Thunder.  Sure, I liked Zoolander and found a lot of the humor from that film, throughout this one; however I'm also a big fan of Robert Downey Jr.  I grew up with R.D. on the silver screen and so desperately wanted the man to pull out of the rehab press releases so he could come back with some more of his old-school radical humor.  Hands down Downey Jr. stole the film and in my opinion has now topped every other comedic role he's ever done (thus far).<br /><br />Though Jack Black doesn't get to let lose with his normal off the wall shock-humor, he makes up for it with some of the best whack-job scene's associated with this genre of spoofing.  It's not very often that a military style spoof movie comes out and for sure this was an example of perfect casting to keep the audiences laughing.<br /><br />Leave your brain at the door and get ready to laugh `a lot'.  I also had a lot of fun picking out the different spoofs that were portrayed within the movie. Oh and one last item.  I completely `hate' Tom Cruise; literally, there's no way I can express in words how much his presence on the silver screen turns my stomach.  In his role in Tropic Thunder, he's completely changed my attitude 100%.  The cameo's & surprise supporting actors fills out the fun of the movie - don't think - just see this movie.

0385340990|5.0|Recommended by a friend who reads as much as I do, I opened the pages of The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society not sure if I would like it. I mean a book full of letters? What a delightful surprise I received.<br /><br />Shaffer's tongue-in-cheek humor and engaging style had me enthralled from the first page. I felt as though I was reading over Julia's shoulder, falling in love with the residents of Guernsey, characters each and every one. How utterly disappointing they only live on the pages of this book.<br /><br />Sadly, Mary Ann Shaffer's health declined rapidly and her niece, Annie Barrows, author of the children's series Ivy and Bean, completed the novel seamlessly for her aunt. Although Shaffer only wrote one novel, The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is top notch and should be around delighting readers for years to come.
B00006J9OV|4.0|Aproppriated scenarios,excelent singers,a good music making by Levine and almost all singers.. However,as some people say  Haydn's bad luck was to be Mozart's contemporary,we could say  many conductors ,in some works,are not comfortable to be contemporary of Karajan,forgive me those who hate the idiosyncrasy and vanity by the Austrian conductor.His recording of Parsifal,despite uneven P Hoffmann,has an orchestral texture reaching a matchless supernatural rapture,a difficult concentration on the adagios and a heavenly athmosphere in the \\"eucharistic\\" moments,so that every other version seems to lack some sublimity,although they would be excellent once we did not know Karajan`s recording.

0375826726|1.0|Like Eragon, the child wonder, Christopher Paolini saw his greatest moments in the first book.  Apparently, the hype and praise of \\"Eragon\\" got to the authors head, because he seems to think that he can single handedly re-invent the formula for a good novel/trilogy.  Of course, the other explanation is that Paolini, likely a D&D gamer at heart, thinks that the rest of us care to hear his intriquitly designed and completely monotonous Dungeon Master scenario.  This may work for a bunch of pimply-faced teens with nothing to do on a Saturday night, but for his educated audience, he just lost us.      There is a third possibility.  It's the Tolkien syndrome that so many writers of today seem to think they can copy, even plagiarize believing the rest of us are too stupid to take notice.  Since \\"Eragon\\" it was obvious that this was an adolescent attempt at the newest \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy.  But Christopher you are no Tolkien.  Tolkien wrote his \\"trilogy\\" over a few decades, was trained in linguistics and called among his friends one of the greatest writers of all time, CS Lewis.      Ironically, Paolini's re-make lacks a Gandalf figure, and it is obvious that his writing team lacks one as well.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This is one of the finest pieces of television to come along for some time. I wish they would make more like it.
B00005RDRO|4.0|Very funny comedy from the 1970s and I liked it even more now that I'm more familiar with the characters being parodied.  Acting is fantastic - great ensemble cast and great sight gags.  Well worth the cost of the DVD; wish they made them this funny nowadays.
045122499X|5.0|I believe this book may be better than Pillars of the Earth. It is similar, but has a different main story line. The characters and plot are rich and overlap. I was always surprised with the story events. It is a long book, but worth the read!!
B00005R24K|4.0|As far as teenage horror movies go this is pretty decent stuff. It is easy to see the tongue in cheek humor as well. I can see why it is a cult favorite. Part of a trilogy I think they got better as actor Bruce Campbell and Director Sam Raimi felt comfortable with this theme and took it further and further. By the time they got to \\"Army of Darkness\\" it became mostly comedy with some horror. AOD is my favorite of the three because of the outrageous bits and great special effects. This is a great collection for fans of horror/comedy movies. If you enjoyed this catch \\"Scary Movie\\".<br /><br />CA Luster
0061122416|5.0|This classic, beautiful tale about following one's quest and the power of the \\"Personal Legend\\", as the author calls it, was an easy and enjoyable read. I found the story of Santiago's (the main character's) spiritual travels through Spain very inspiring.<br />It reconnected me with the magic and adventure of going for my dreams. Coelho's wise and direct words, reminded me of the book [[ASIN:0071601082 Working on Yourself Doesn't Work: The 3 Simple Ideas That Will Instantaneously Transform Your Life]] and [[ASIN:1888043180 Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment]]by Ariel and Shya Kane. I came across them in my own search and their books have touched my heart deeply and have also been catalysts  for a profound shift in the way I experience life these days: easy, enjoyable and full of miracles!<br />I recommend no matter at which point in life you are at, to check out Coehlo's and the Kane's books which are great tools for well-being and modern day enlightenment.<br />Share them with your friends and family!!
B001ED7C58|1.0|This is the perfect soundtrack to appeal to the fans of Twilight. Its vapid and pumped full of mediocre tracks by mediocre bands that are force-fed to the youth of America, who would sooner take MTV's word for it than go out in search of their own musical identity. Of course, writing a review like this is an exercise in futility, as fans of Twilight are exactly the kind of people who would sooner be force-fed opinions than take a chance and form one of their own, so I'm more than ready for some fallout from this review. But what can I say, I do love a good exercise in futility, and what needs be said needs be said. Other than the inclusion of Iron and Wine's sublime \\"Flightless Bird, American Mouth,\\" this soundtrack is chock full of cookie cutter rock and roll tripe. Honestly though, that's an insult to tasty tripe everywhere. Paramore? Muse? Linkin Park? Collective Soul? This soundtrack could be Now That's What I Call Music #2485 for all the soulless garbage clogging up the silicon disc, which honestly deserves a much better fate than housing eleven garbage tracks and one inexplicably present gem. I know that nothing I say will stop people from loving cut-and-paste teen trash like Twilight and the related films, soundtracks, and feminine hygiene products (just you wait for it), but I'm at least going to urge: please, people, think for yourselves, and don't buy into what Hollywood wants you to think is good music. This soundtrack gets 1/10, and that's only because \\"Flightless Bird...\\" is such an excellent track.
0060887966|1.0|There is not a single original idea in this book. That's true of even a lot of great literature, but other books make up for repackaging old ideas by adding new wrinkles. The Alchemist is written like a bible story, so you don't get attached to any of the characters (most of them don't even have real names), and Coelho does not bother with imagery or any real significant plot twists. Overall, it's kind of like a self help book in narrative form, with the basic idea being, \\"Follow your dreams and life will be grand! Sometimes the journey will be convoluted, but stick with it and you'll be glad!\\" I haven't heard that a thousand million times...    Not only is this book boring, but I'm a little surprised no one seems to mind the implicit sexism. There are no redeeming female characters in the entire novel. The only female characters are cliches: the old gypsy woman and the young, beautiful youth that, for no apparent reason, falls in love with the protagonist. I'm not a feminist or anything, but I would think that women would grow tired of reading literature that is supposedly inspiring, where their whole gender is reduced to the role of plot devices.
B001DU8T6S|4.0|Well ofcourse Queen is not going to be Queen without Freddie. However there is alot of good music on this CD. There is a Bad Company sound that Paul Rodgers brings with him so you have to be able to accept that. I like this recording the more I hear it. The softer ballads are growing on me. So far I count 8 good songs 4 ok songs and 1 dud. You get a good mix of high energy rockin tunes with soft ballads. It falls short of 5 stars because their is no singular masterpiece on it. Ofcourse the expectations are high when you call yourself Queen. If this were a group of another name I'd probably say they can really rock and have great potential. As it is I give 4 stars for 8 really enjoyable rock listening experiences contained in this collection by the new Queen.
B001ED7C58|5.0|This CD is really awesome. Although, Bella's Lullaby is quite a different spin, I think that there is a piece of the charater Edward inside the notes and rythm.  That is some thing that he would write. I can imange that is was really fun to write songs for this book, because of the elements and complexidy of it.  This is one of the best movie CD componit that i have ever heard. All of the songs have beautiful lyrics and awesome beats. I love Twilight with all my heart, and I hope the movie gives it justice. This deffinatly gives it justice.
B000X5SPBI|4.0|I love this product! (of course that has nothing to do with Amazon. I'm just a SN geek.) It was delivered on time. I've enjoyed watching it with my siblings. Sometimes the discs skip, but I can never tell if it is the DVD player we are using or the DVDs themselves. Needless to say, I'll keep them forever! :D
0786838655|5.0|This series of books (still going) is awesome. It's like the Harry Potter series for today's kids. But don't let that discourage you; I read these books and I'm 18. Anyone with ANY interest in mythology SHOULD READ THIS BOOK SERIES. It's an interesting twist on the idea that the Greek gods still exist today and there is a new danger that threatens them and the whole world. I don't want to give the story away but it is so well written and such an interesting story that you have to read it for yourself. YOU HAVE TO!!!
0439023483|5.0|The post-apocalyptic novel is beautifully written and visual.  The story is fascinating, the little bit of romance is nice, and I couldn't stop thinking about it when I finished.  Can't wait for the next book!
B000TGJ80S|5.0|Well, what can I say about this movie?  The first time I saw it, I wanted to be a vampire.  I have seen this movie over aned over again, read the adapted book, and even inspired me to travel to Romania on the \\"Dracula Tour.\\"  Actually, the Romanians don't quite get the obession Americans have with Vlad Tepes \\"The Impaler\\" who by all accounts was a real life manical mass murderer.  Anyway, the movie is awesome, the music is even more awesome, and the special effects is even more awesom(er) than that.  Dracula, who is he?  A hero.  A monster.  A love sick fool.  A genius.  A madman.  A warrior.  A prince.  This movie is up there on my top ten list of keeper movies.
1433502410|5.0|Many of the other folks have done a more detailed review than i am able to do,however,I just want to share the excitement I have in reading the Bible again,The contributors that put this together did such a wonderful job!I understand there is a reformed bias and the other reviewers explained this well,but,there is a loving care that is evident is this study Bible,and this goes beyond thier personal beliefs about secondary issues and just brings back that unselfish God centered joy in His truth that sometimes gets lost when someone tries too hard to explain thier take on things,This is a study bible for the ages.I purchased the hardcover edition which fit my budget and I love it,It's also a very heavy Bible which I enjoy also,I dont know why perhaps it's more to love! Take a look at it and prayerfully consider it even if you you have never considered the ESV,Though I am still a KJV guy at heart,This one may win your affections again as It has me,and if you've lost that \\"first love\\" a little, this may help you see Jesus with that simple devotion again-enjoy!    Update:Dec.30,2008 Still loving this Bible and am recommending it to anyone who will listen,however I do have a problem that I emailed Crossway about this evening,The black paper that is glued to my Hardcover edition is separating from the spine of the book and I can see the mesh inside the binding,perhaps this is just a defect in my copy and I'm sure Crossway will help me replace this defective copy,but i cant see going with the Hardcover again after this experience,and I will update this again as this becomes resolved,lastly I still must say this Study Bible is exciting and in my opinion the finest ever made I cant recommend it highly enough although i would suggest avoiding the Hardcover edition
B000RZGFYS|2.0|I had been toying with the idea of buying this band's cover of punk songs called \\"Undisputed attitude\\" and I took the plunge in doing so, as well as picking up \\"Reign in blood\\" because a heavy metal magazine had recently said this was undisputably the greatest heavy metal album of all time. Thought about returning both cds, but held on to \\"Undisputed attitude\\" as it has a few good punk tracks (reviewed that title here, last).       My main problem with this title, and most of Undisputed Attitude is the sheer breakneck tempo of the music. There is no doubt in my mind that there is a 'cool' effect in increasing a song's tempo, such that the faster it goes, the more you like it. Here however, the tempo is so fast that it actually diminishes your enjoyment of the music. That's why I described this album as \\"techno for headbangers\\" in my header. In other words, IF you REALLY love VERY fast temp music, in a heavy metal style, you MAY LOVE this album.       Now, if the music had struck me as interesting, I MAY have been tempted to hold on to this cd. What made dumping this album even easier was the nature of the lyrics in it. They dealt with horror themes...quite detailed at times. It wouldn't surprise me if the horrific nature of the lyrics have been surpassed in recent times (search You Tube for Australian satirists \\"The Chaser\\" doing a cabaret version of a Cannibal Corpse song which is even more sickening than the lyrics on this album). I'm not saying that the lyrics in this cd are beyond the pale, but it crosses the line enough for me to be turned off by them.       The magazine which rated this album the greatest heavy metal album ever did mention this album being chock full of riffs. Unfortunately, either we have different notions on what a riff is, or I just found the riffs on this album unmemorable. Someone I had been emailing remarked that a certain heavy metal band that they had been listening to had a lot of \\"noodling\\" lead guitar work. Had never heard of that word before, but it did resonate with me...some of the lead guitar work here just seemed to wander around aimlessly.         Can't really say that I am a fan of the genre in heavy metal called \\"thrash\\", of which this album is apparently a part. The ONLY thrash album that I rate as good, is Metallica's \\"Master of puppets\\" (which I've reviewed here). Even though both these albums have elements in common, such that you couldn't be sure which band was playing that bit of music (e.g. the lyrical Haiku of Slayer's \\"Angel of death\\" and something like Metallica's \\"Thing that should not be\\"), I find the tempo so extreme in this Slayer album that I find it impossible to lump together these two bands, they are so different in style and intent.        The worst thing for me about this album is just the sheer lack of variety in the music. Like I said in the header, if you listen to one song on this album and like it, trust me, you will like ALL of the album. The converse is true too...if you listen to one song on this album and don't like it, trust me, you won't like ANY song on this album. I'm sure fans of this album will be able to point out instances where in fact Slayer DO change tempo or some such, but for me, the effect is never memorable. Their cover of \\"Violent pacification\\" is a shining example of how to change tempo to memorable and cool effect (on Undisputed Attitude).         Back to thrash metal, of the albums I've heard, mostly by Metallica, I tend to find them musically uninteresting for me...and those include albums that many heavy metal afficionados would undoubtedly call 'classics', like \\"Kill 'em all\\", \\"Ride the lightning\\" and \\"And justice for all\\". So...I would say that \\"Reign in blood\\" is superior to \\"Kill 'em all\\", which I regard as a bad album. It's just that I ditched BOTH albums. Would have ditched \\"And justice for all\\", if I could have, too. \\"Reign in blood\\" is not a bad album, musical proficiency wise, as I consider \\"Kill 'em all\\" to be...it's just that I find it  one paced and uninteresting.       There really isn't a song on this album that I find \\"listworthy\\", as in Metallica's magnificent \\"Fade to black\\" on the otherwise unintersting \\"Ride the lightning\\" album. If pressed, I could say that some of the songs are SORT of interesting...e.g. \\"Angel of death\\", \\"Piece by piece\\" and \\"Raining blood\\", but they're not the kind of songs that I would really want to listen to for 'pleasure'. Which is not to say that I hate breakneck speed metal. In another album I briefly owned, the 20th Anniversary Nuclear Blast compilation, I did find myself liking the black metal song \\"Sanctus perversum\\" by Belphagor, which had interesting guitar work...melodically and texturally speaking. That song was also REALLY fast.       All I can say is that if you like absurdly fast heavy metal music with some gruesome lyrics (murder themes, occultish themes), you will find a lot to like in this cd. As I found the musical and lyrical tempo absurdly fast, I can't give this album any more than two stars. I'm rating this a better album than \\"Kill 'em all\\" but that is not saying much.        Of the kind of heavy metal albums I actually like, well, for thrash, I recommend Metallica's \\"Master of puppets\\", but my favourite album of theirs is \\"Reload\\". \\"Master of puppets\\" is a better album, overall, than \\"Black\\", but \\"Black\\" has two of my favourite Metallica songs \\"Enter Sandman\\" and \\"Unforgiven\\", so they almost break even, quality wise.       For those who like elements of hard-core music in their metal, my favourite such album is Coldseed's \\"Completion makes the tragedy\\" which is a brilliantly varied album combining what sounds like thrash songs to me, with power ballads, with grunge metal, with some guttural singing, with trippy songs. Reviewed all the albums mentioned above, mostly.    Fave metal songs:     Metallica: \\"Fade to black\\" and \\"Enter Sandman\\"  Megadeth: Prince of Darkness  Coldseed: \\"Burning with a shade\\" and \\"Low\\"    Also reviewed a lot of proto metal albums here and hard-rock.
B001CD6FKS|4.0|One of the definitive Blu-Ray experiences and a must-own for fans of the format. A fantastic example of the power of a director's vision and gift for visual narrative allowing a movie to rise above the sum of its parts. The convoluted plot, uneven active performances and unconvincing (or nonexistent) sense of danger in the racing scenes are not enough to break this movie. The masterful execution of the anime/comicbook format is breathtaking from the perspective of both a cinema buff and someone with an appreciation for the modernist use of color and pattern to evoke emotion. This movie is a triumph on so many fronts that it's a shame movie critics (the same movie critics who elevate many trite and lazily written movies to stratospheric heights) would attempt to push this movie into obscurity by dismissing it as a \\"CGI fanboy\\" movie.
006135323X|5.0|This is such a great book that explains how predictable our mind works and despite so we often are irrational in making decision.  I really enjoy reading the book and I am sure you definitely will as somehow those irrationalities mentioned in this book were hardwired into our DNA.
031606792X|1.0|I started reading this series after graduating in hopes of giving my overworked brain a little rest.  The first book was without a doubt the strongest, books two and three were \\"ok\\", but this book I found myself saying \\"what?!?\\" a lot.  Some of my questions were answered on Meyer's website (which is my opinion is ridiculous because she should have used THE BOOK to tie up the ambiguity) but I'm still left with tons of questions as well as complaints.        *spoilers*     1. I get the whole \\"sex sells\\" phrase but, really? In teen lit.? I found it beyond annoying that Meyer made the teenage sex okay by slapping a teen marriage on it. Was is it really necessary to use a highly popular novel to promote teen marriage and pregnancy? I know, not everyone wants to go to college and have a career. I also know that Bella and Edward have eternity to achieve anything they set their minds to. But come on! Throwing \\"Nessie\\" in the book took away from the love story of Bella and Edward. The fact that \\"Nessie\\" stops aging at seven makes it worse. They are going to have a 7 year old child for the rest of eternity.     2. I know it's been complained about so much but I want to insert my rant as well. Jacob's imprinting. I can understand the imprinting thing. Imprinting is the whole fate concept. But imprinting on children? I read somewhere that people where defending this by stating that they arent \\"lovers\\" until the female is of age. But still. The imprinting concept is to further their genes and they are taking one look at CHILDREN and realizing they would be a good mate. Im sorry but thats nasty.     As stated earlier, I understand the whole imprinting concept, but I want to know HOW Jacob imprinted on \\"Nessie\\". HOW did he imprint on someone who is stuck physically at the age of seven?! If the purpose of imprinting is to make better \\"shape shifters\\" for the future, why was Jacob allowed to imprint on someone who will not. For a split second I thought Meyer would address this, andshe did present a similar question in the novel but she literally had Bella shrug it off as, \\"we have will discuss that later\\" (paraphrased of course). WHAT?!?     3. So...was Bella ever going to tell her mother that she had a child and the other little details happening in her life? It's annoying how Renee's knowledge of Bella's new life was dismissed because she was \\"childlike\\" or whatever. Bella basically treated it as \\"well my mom is so immature and dumb so I guess I dont have to tell her\\".     In all honesty, this book reminds me of some of the papers I had to write for school. I would always wait until the last minute and then on the due date I would finish the last few pages. It seems as though Meyer grew tired of writing about these characters and just slapped on a \\"the end...everyone lived happily ever after..\\".
0385340540|1.0|In the waning days of an unpopular presidency, the director of the CIA makes an unusual request.  He seeks a pardon for a much-hated former Washington insider who went to prison without revealing important secrets related to a mysterious spy satellite system.  The pardon is not recommended because the pardonee has finally shared his knowledge, successfully worked his political network or regained use of his former millions, it's to see who ends up putting a bullet in his head.  Joel Backman is the former broker and he's the bait.  The mystery is not only whether he'll figure out what's going on before he gets executed, but whether his life is worth saving.    The Broker, while supported by a decent blurb of a storyline, is probably John Grisham's least interesting novel - at least for those seeking a legal thriller.  The story begins with Backman being whisked away to Italy for what he believes will be witness protection type program.  Despite the promise of danger, the next several hundred pages, rather than moving the plot forward, read like an amateur travelogue.  Through Backman and his tutors we spend the next several months learning about the culture of Italy and the beauties of Bologna.  Maybe some would disagree, but I don't pick up a Grisham novel to learn about the more considerable care with which Italian men dress themselves or to read someone's Italian language practice.    Ultimately, the plot moves forward very slowly and without much in the way of interesting twists and/or turns.  Likewise, the characters are never fully fleshed out, in fact several appear to be introduced only as plot decorations.  A particularly egregious example is the President's right-hand man who is introduced and dispatched in several sections which appear to have no connection whatsoever with the rest of the novel.  In terms of \\"legal thriller action,\\" there's really not much here to like, other than the fact that, like all of Grisham's books, this one is easy to read.  Grisham, as usual, gives us some local color, but in this case fails to deliver a story.
B00188M5TM|4.0|The true story of Christine Collins, as presented in Clint Eastwood's CHANGELING, is a supremely compelling slice of American history.  I was surprised that I had never really heard of the case...but from what I've read about it since seeing the movie, it sounds like the whole thing was going to slip into a national distant memory.  It's very exciting that this case has now been captured for posterity.  Frankly, the story feels a little bit like what an adaptation of the non-fiction book DEVIL IN THE WHITE CITY might feel like.  An unusual and nearly forgotten crossroads of two fascinating bits of Americana.    The year is 1928, and Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) is a single-mother raising her 9 year old son in Los Angeles.  She works as a floor manager in a telephone operator center.  She's good at her job, respected by the woman and men around her...but it's clear her life revolves around giving her young son a solid life.  They live in a nice house in a nice neighborhood.  They use very convenient public transportation to go to work and school.  They get along well, and the boy seems to be studious and polite.  It's a rosy picture...but there's no reason not to believe it.  One day, Collins must go to work on a weekend unexpectedly, and she leaves her son Walter at home alone.  (This was not nearly as \\"irresponsible\\" then as it would be today.)  She comes home that evening, and her son is gone, without a trace.    The police are not very helpful, but amazingly, after a few months, she gets word that her son has been found in DeKalb, Illinois and is on his way back.  The police, anxious for a bit of good publicity, arrange for the press to be at the station in droves when mother & son are reunited.  But when the happy moment comes, Christine insists that the boy greeting her is NOT her son.    Her campaign to compel the police to continue looking for her son is what drives much of this film.  Apparently, at this time in Los Angeles, the police were as corruptas any group of mobsters and twice as murderous.  If a man needed to be silenced, he'd be killed.  If a woman needed to learn to shut up, she was committed to an insane asylum.  Christine's saga is sure to stir any viewers outrage and disbelief.    In the background of this sensational case, we follow the journey of one plodding but honest enough detective, who eventually uncovers the fate of young Walter and a number of other missing boys.  It is this investigation and the subsequent events of it that elevate this from an interesting but somewhat familiar film to a story that is almost too good to be believed.      When Christine's plight collides with this detective's discoveries and then they collide again with a corrupt police force...this is when you shake your head and wonder how it is you've not heard this story before.  If someone were to write a novel like this...we'd smile at how much they were stretching credulity.      So, just to experience the story alone makes CHANGELING a must-see.  Simple as that.    Too bad the movie itself isn't a little better.  It is 2 hours and 20 minutes long, and while I do not mind long movies at all, I felt that Eastwood's always stately pace was just a mite too glacial.  I would have liked to lose 10 minutes.  Nothing major...just a little tightening.  Many critics of the film complain that it has too many endings.  It IS true that the film follows virtually every bit of the case to their conclusions...and this leads to a film without a true climax.  But frankly, the story is inherently compelling enough that the lack of that one \\"wow\\" moment was okay.  I was glad he took the time to show us what happened years later...rather than simply show a title card with a quick sentence telling us how it all turned out.  (There is some of that...but only after all the meat of the story has played out.)    In addition, I found the acting spotty at best.  Jeffrey Donovan plays the detective who most vehemently stands in Christine's way.  His character is one-dimensionally constructed, and Donovan struggles to add layers to it.  John Malkovich is given the character of an activist minister who uses Christine to wage his battle against the police...and while it's a less manic performance from Malkovich than we usually get...it also feels a bit devoid of energy and life.  He feels like a dramatic device...even though he may have really existed.  On the other hand, Michael Kelly as Detective Ybarra, who cracks the case gives a suitably understated and yet charismatic performance.  And I have a soft spot for Colm Feore, who plays the Chief of Police, ever since his great work in the Stephen King TV movie \\"Storm of the Century.\\"      And what of Jolie?  There's no doubt she throws her all into the part.  She is a compelling presence, and it's the kind of performance that frequently inspires Oscar nominations.  But I actually found her a bit tiring to watch at times.   She so often resorts to thumping her chest and proclaiming in a despair-wracked, gravelly voice, \\"I want MY son!!  I want my SON!!  I WANT my son!!!\\"  The role is quietly flashy (good) but also not very nuanced (not so good).  I believe ultimately it is the script that has betrayed her...but sometimes Jolie also just seems to self-aware of what a striking figure she is in her period costumes and her sensual lips.    The film is great to look at.  The recreation of suburban LA, with red trolley cars running right down quiet neighborhood streets is a treat.  The costumes are great and the cinematography is suitably unobtrusive.  Almost every frame makes you feel immersed in a particular time and place.    Yet it is really only the amazing facts of the story itself that make this film a must-see.  Were the story inherently less compelling, I'd probably only be able to give the film a very marginal thumbs up, due to flaws in pacing and acting and scripting.  As it stands, however, I need to recommend this film highly by virtue of its amazingtrue tale.
B000Q8QHK8|2.0|I love this movie, however amazon's site says the blu ray release here is unrated.  It's not.  The box has it rated R.  This is not the Director's Cut.  Don't waste your money on this edited release.
B000UR366S|1.0|The one star rating was involuntary on my part; no stars is, unfortunately in this case, not an option.  No one likes a jaunt down Memory Lane more than I, but when the memories become your reality it's time to call a halt to the proceedings.  Joni Mitchell WAS a major influence upon the music scene, and Joni Mitchell WAS relevant, and Joni Mitchell WAS an attractive woman.  But all of these ceased over thirty years ago.  Everything positive in this woman's career is in the past.  I don't know which is sadder--Ms. Mitchell's refusal to see reality and retire, or her diehard fans refusal to see her and her music for what they are:  irrelevant and pathetically out of date.

B001ED7C58|5.0|I am a certifiable Twilight fanatic, so I was very excited to purchase the Twilight soundtrack today. I love the first single off the album, \\"Decode\\" by Paramore. The Perry Farrell song's kinda catchy, but I absolutely love tracks 8-12. The second Paramore song on the soundtrack, \\"I Caught Myself,\\" is really cute. I really like the weird, kinda creepy sounding \\"Eyes on Fire\\" by Blue Foundation. Robert Pattinson's song caught me off gaurd (not in a bad way). I thought it was some aged hippie-folkster. The Iron and Wine song, \\"Flightless Bird, American Mouth\\" is very good also. I liked the cover of the Postal Service's \\"Such Great Heights\\" they did on the Garden State soundtrack. Bella's Lullaby wasn't what I expected, but that's not a bad thing. It will grow on me, I'm sure. I can't wait to see the movie and see how and where all the songs tie in.
0061251305|5.0|Tribal Leadership is the next big idea for organizations looking to move to a higher level of productivity, passion and influence. The concepts and observations presented are easily observable in most organizations. One of the most interesting and challenging concepts seems to be that an organization can really move beyond a competitive mindset to a \\"greater good\\" mission or noble cause.
B0012QE4Q2|1.0|What a terrible film. Can someone please tell Natalie Portman that her 15 minutes were over a long time ago. Why does she keep trying the horrible fake British accent? It's almost as bad as Madonna's .... almost! And her acting, well it's about as bad as the accent. Scarlett Johansson isn't much better. Both of them are so out of their element it's frightening. As for the film, it's a total mess. It blows so fast through the historical events that you don't care one iota about any of the characters except maybe for the poor British actors in the film who had to go to their trailers every day and bang their heads against the wall trying to figure out how to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.
B00003CXB4|5.0|i grew up listening to The Lion King soundtrack. watching the movie reminds me of how i used to sing along with Simba in \\"i can't wait to be king\\" with the biggest smile across my face (i still do). that was more than 10 years ago. now i'm almost in college and i still LOVE this movie...one of my favorites ever.    i don't know how anyone could possibly NOT like this. it's the best Disney has ever done. amazing plot/theme with touching scenes (you have no idea how much i cried haha), awesome characters, and wonderful music.     A true classic. Two thumbs up!
0312427646|5.0|Alan Bennett's charming, clever, witty The Uncommon Reader is a novella which begs for the accessibilty of a nearby pencil and pad of paper; there are such astute observations on the transformative power of reading that most avid readers will want to ponder and share all the author has woven into the plot of this very funny book.<br /><br />The story is straight and to the point:  the Queen of England has developed a love of reading.  So what?  Well, if you've ever succumbed to the Harry Potter virus - meaning, you've let every last shred of housework, relationships, and personal hygiene fall to the wayside while you plow through another year at Hogwart's with Harry - then you know how reading can both enrich your world and simultaneously pull you out of the reality of it.  But what if you weren't the housewife or the co-worker or the school librarian, but the QUEEN OF ENGLAND?  What do you suppose would happen while you're holed up in the den, sequestered in your newest adventure?  Yes, the stakes are a little higher for a Royal Reader.<br /><br />It's not just the international ripple which results from Her Royal Highness' reading that makes the book so funny - it's also the amazing voice that Bennett has given to the Queen.  She is touching and thoughtful; the feeling you get while reading is so microscopic and almost intimate.  I couldn't help but imagine Helen Mirren while I read this book, mostly because she did such a fabulous job humaninzing HRH in The Queen.  Whomever I was meant to imagine while I read, by the time I finished I could certainly picture this fellow reader as a friend.
0880389052|5.0|I've never been too big into fantasy, so when I was told to read this book I didn't expect to enjoy it. Though, to my suprise, I fell in love. I simply couldn't put the book down. Drizzt is one of the most interesting characters I've ever read about, and his clash with drow society is amazingly interesting. I've been suggesting this book to everyone I know.

0061537934|5.0|This was a touching tale of a dog's life, written from his perspective. In a very funny, often thought-provoking and inspiring story, our hero not only understands his place in the world, he carves a place in the reader's heart.  He teaches important life lessons in a simple, honest and straight-forward way. As is typical of his species, our narrator never is preachy, is rarely judgemental, and sometimes, like his human counterparts, falls in love with with a person he previously misjudged. His biggest yet most loveable fault? A sincere jealousy of humans' possession of opposable thumbs.   I predict you'll fall in love with Enzo and his story.
0060594896|5.0|I really enjoy the Chicken Soup for the Soul series so I thought I would give this a try. It is different in so much as this is more of a \\"how to\\" guide. Gives the nuts & bolts of how to be successful if you work for yourself, are in sales - or need to market yourself, your product or your idea. It's filled with suggestions, ideas & examples. I enjoyed it so much I purchased the audio book as well & have listened to it several times.<br /><br />It also has many useful \\"list\\" suggestions. IE: list your \\"don't-wants\\" as well as your \\"wants\\" so you can better focus on exactly what your goals are.<br /><br />My only complaint would be that it is a little long. I prefer shorter, to-the-point books that are a quicker read. His audio book is abridged so it is stream-lined better. It is read by the author & he does a pretty good job - but he often sounds like he is reading, which surprised me a little, knowing of his extensive speaking career. Over-all it is still a better read than many of the so-called professionally narrated audio books I have. Would like to see perhaps a little more enthusiasm though.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book (in fact, I have given it as gifts to my grown sons who are in sales).

B00171LFFU|4.0|Having eagerly awaited the release of these as remasters, I quickly purchased the 3 classic Van albums , Astral Weeks, Moondance , & His Band & Streetchoir in their new Japanese remastered format . I was slightly disappointed with the results as they are only marginally better then the domestic titles we have had for years. I wonder if they were remastered from first generation Master Tapes or simply  a new reworking of the same old masters. there is no mention in the liner notes of having been redone by any person, the only place you will see mention of any remastering is in the Obi strip along the side . My advice would be to hold off on these and see what else comes unless you are a devote Van fan that perhaps the slight improvement is worth it for you
B001JOIEZ4|4.0|It's a pretty nice compelation of songs and fits the tone of the move/book well. Sometimes it feels a little faux-emo, but what else do you expect when it comes to Vampires? Rob Pattinson has an interesting and intriging voice, and his song is a little hard to understand sometimes, but it's beautiful. All in all, it's a great buy for the price. And a nessecity for any Twilight enthusiast.
B001F2W4Y2|5.0|When you see a really hot chick, do wonder if it is her skin tone, hair, legs, eyes, etc.?  No, she's just freakin hot.  Music is the same way.  I get sick and tired of hearing everybody talking about this solo and that reverb.  When music is great, it just is.  One listen to this album and I was floored.  I'm not an AC/DC fan, so I had little expectation.  It is the best rock album I have heard in years, period.

B001G9LVGG|4.0|Some people bring their own style to old masterpieces and it just ends up sounding goofy, but on this album, McKennitt puts a distinctive stamp on some favorites and gives them fresh life.  Several of the songs are so good that I've stopped thinking of this as a holiday CD (I'm an infidel anyway) and just consider it a fine collection of world-influenced music (the temptation is to call it \\"Celtic,\\" but some of the percussion comes much closer to Middle Eastern, so I'll use the vaguer \\"world\\").  As a bonus, I'd be remiss if I didn't compliment the wonderful artwork on the cover and liner notes.  I would be thrilled to give (or get) Christmas cards that attractive, and if it's not already, I hope someone thinks to do something more with these paintings--posters, ornaments, something.  Really very handsome to look to at.

B001FBSMW6|2.0|I always look for bands with a signature sound. I've heard guitar players dog The Edge for his simplistic hooks but U2 sounds like U2 and I'm a lifelong fan. Keane used to sound like Keane. No guitars? Heavy emphasis on piano. It worked. I liked it.     Bands don't want to be pigeon-holed, they want to experiment, grow, break out. I get it. I just wish Keane had gone in a different direction. I grew up in the 80's and was a big fan of New Wave/Punk/Indy sound...then. Not now. Once in a while I tune into \\"The Big 80's\\" and \\"1st Wave\\" on Sirius for a trip down memory lane. It strikes me now how bad some of that music was. Synths and drumsynths out of control. Too bad Keane chose that style for their \\"new\\" sound. Doesn't work for me.   This one won't be sticking around my playlist for long.

There isn't one that didn't feel a mysterious tingle in the back of his neck and a shiver down his spine when he first heard Lee Ermy calling cadence in the boot camp segment of the movie.  Nuf said about the film except to say that the video and audio transfer to blu-ray is outstanding.  The anamorphic treatment that allows it to fit 16X9 TVs is excellent.

0307383415|4.0|This book has received a lot of scrutiny from Obama's detractors since he ran for president. It has also disappointed a lot of his fans.    This was written when Obama was much younger than he is now, so it should be read as a memoir about a reflection on family, race, identity. The book was clearly written by a man who knew he was going to go into politics, so it is not without its agenda. Despite this agenda (which is not overbearing), it still reads more like an honest self-reflection from a man starting to make his mark on the world. The honesty is unparalleled by any biography of an American politician I can think of (please tell me if I'm wrong) and that is very refreshing.     Those looking for any sort of insight into his policy ideas while president can use some inductive reasoning to fill out what ever they want (He's a socialist! He wants to cut taxes! He wants to raise taxes.) This should be avoided because his views since this book have changed on a lot of things. What you can see is how astute his observations are about a wide variety of people gained from his consistent outsider status. Given that he was relatively young when he penned this, one can only assume he has only matured farther.    Problems include some muddled prose when he tries to \\"out eloquence\\" himself (a criticism he admits in the preface to a newer addition), a lack of a family tree (it is a book about family), and about a fifty extra pages.    If you read this book for non-political reasons, you will enjoy most of his prose, observations on Americans, and honesty about himself: a young man of unusual origins struggling with an identity and lack of a father figure.) I would recommend reading it like this instead of digging for out-of-context snippets to further your preconceived notions of him (Messiah, drug-abuser, communist, racist, best politician ever, etc.)
1416562605|5.0|Only rarely do readers encounter a literary novel with the grip of a page-turning, escapist thriller. When it happens, the result is truly exhilarating both for the reading experience as well as the discovery of the author who created it. When that author turns out to be a new literary voice, so much the better for the anticipation of future work to come. THE WHITE TIGER is just such a novel. As clichéd as it is to say, \\"I couldn't put it down,\\" I almost couldn't. Each time I did so, I could hardly wait to get back to Adiga's extraordinary tale of his Indian entrepreneur.     Born the second son of a rickshaw puller in the village of Laxmangarh, Balram Halwai is also a son of what he calls the Darkness, that is, the poverty, ignorance, and subservience endemic to rural India. Balram tells his story in a first person voice, ostensibly in the form of an extended series of letters he is writing to China's premier Wen Jiabao explaining how more Chinese people can become rich, successful entrepreneurs the way he has. Chillingly, though, Balram freely admits from the opening pages of his first missive that he is a criminal, wanted for the murder of his former master. Through the rest of the novel, Adiga's distinctively anti-, anti-hero relates more or less chronologically how his crime and his successful entrance into the Light (the world of choice, influence, and money) came to pass.     Although Balram's family name and caste suggest that he should become a sweets-maker by trade, he has no such intentions. Nevertheless, from his earliest adult days working as a menial in a teashop, Balram is virtually invisible, a non-entity crawling about cleaning the floor like a human spider. He decides to learn how to drive and through effort and luck lands a position as the second driver for a family whose wealth comes from the coal industry. Ultimately, Balram is assigned to a single master, the ineffectual Ashok (recently returned from America with a college education) and his aptly named Western wife, Pinky Madam. His new position as their driver eventually takes him to his master's new home in Delhi. When Balram visits a secondhand book market there one afternoon, a bookseller translates aloud two lines from an Urdu poem that change the White Tiger's life: \\"You were looking for the key for years, But the door was always open!\\"      Balram's letters to Wen Jiabao go on to reveal his cold-blooded reasons for brutally killing Ashok and describe his later emergence as a wealthy businessman (having adopted Ashok as the first name of his alias). That he achieves his success in Bangalore, internationally recognized home of India's massive call center industry supporting American businesses, and works so hard to explain entrepreneurial success to a senior Chinese leader lends THE WHITE TIGER its particular relevance to the changing world of the Twenty-First Century.    Images of darkness and light (day/night, dark skin and vitiligo spots, blond versus black hair color) counterpose one another throughout. Animals also figure hugely in THE WHITE TIGER, and not just the vicious animal in the book's title to whom the young Balram is first compared by a school inspector. There are the ever-present buffaloes of his village, as well as lizards (of which he is terrified). The landlords of his family village are known as the Buffalo, the Stork, the Wild Boar, and the Raven; one of their sons is the Mongoose. Early on, Balram compares rural Indian villagers to chickens forever caged in a jam-packed Rooster Coop. Later, mosquitoes and cockroaches surround him every night in his room, and a fellow driver marked by the pink and white spots of vitiligo nicknames him Country-Mouse.     Author Aravind Adiga brilliantly mixes the horrifying realities of the Indian Darkness with a noirish mystery story complete with bloody, Grand Guignol moments. The effect is gripping, the result electrifying, While I have not read all the Man Booker Prize finalists for 2008, THE WHITE TIGER's receipt of that award must be richly deserved. This is a breakthrough novel, an exploration of today's south Asian subcontinent magnificently rendered for Western sensibilities. Balram Halwei, his master Ashok, and the rest of THE WHITE TIGER's many characters will leave a long and lasting impression on everyone who reads this book. It will also leave readers waiting expectantly for Aravind Adiga's next book.

I guess when you're married with a a baby..its hard to relate to this kind of music. But...if I was tipsy..I know i'd love it. Its kind of got a Gwen Stefani vibe to it. A little techno and hip hop. Its not bad but, lyrics mentioning My Space and making out at clubs don't exactly pertain to me. I wouldn't even call it a good work out cd...her greatest hits is better for that.

B00192KCQ0|1.0|Look up the term \\"Loudness War\\" to understand what I say in this post.  Rick Rubin had created some extremely \\"loud\\" records before.  But he always was (relatively) tasteful about it, keeping enough space for the sound to at least have the illusion of seeming organic and natural.  With this release, there are many portions of the songs that are, to me, unlistenable because of ear fatigue.  I have to turn the cd down so much just to be able to stand it, which means that it isn't loud at all, it's just kind of medium-quiet volume while having absolutely no dynamic impact.  But at least I can hear it above the road noise, right :-,    Also, there is a great degree of digital clipping that is very hard to listen to.  It's the worst type of static in the recording, and there is nothing that you can do about when listening to it, other than turning your stereo's treble knob all the way down.  Too bad that I have to mangle the music with my stereo to listen to this already terribly mangled recording.  Download the Guitar Hero 3 remastered version instead, it is of better sound quality than the retail CD, and that is sad because it has been digitized into the video game, then converted to analog out of the game, then digitized again to distribute as a file... should be much worse quality.  Death Magnetic has proved that big records are now a joke, and we cannot even trust the top producers to create a CD that is not seriously flawed and unlistenable... I could train a 4 year old to do better,

B0013FSL3E|4.0|Personally, the first 20 minutes without dialogue were the most engaging, creative, and humorous.  Once the story hit space, it became quite prosaic, with much of the activities and dialogue onboard being straight out of other stories, and nonetheless with several logical holes, even for a kid's movie.  The return to earth was strictly formulaic and feel good as well.  Despite this, still a respectable, sweet, and humorous tale.

1401207529|5.0|Just, wow.    The story and artwork might seem a little dated at first, but then this IS a prequel and I have no idea whether the effect was intentional but it panned out phenomenally!    Mazzucchelli's artwork adds a new dimension to Miller's already amazing skill as a storyteller who is especially adept at weaving his magic with the Dark Knight.    This was definitely worth a buy, and I'd recommend it to fans of the Dark Knight, fans of the movies and even casual browsers looking to figure out the substance behind the hype of the phenomenon that has become Batman.

Even before the concert was over, I was hoping that they would release a DVD from that tour, and they are!  The track listing indicates that, as with the \\"Rush in Rio\\" DVD, they have included the ENTIRE set.  Why more bands don't do this on their DVDs, I'll never know.  Rush seems to be one of the few rock bands out there that really knows how to please fans with a DVD.  And, I agree with other reviewers...you can NEVER have too many Rush DVDs!!

031606792X|2.0|The only saving grace of this book is the final story arc where it was like watching a revolution where democracy and liberty/independence breaks off from the old tyrannical regime.<br /><br />Yet, if you finished reading the series (like I did in one week) just to find out what happens, you may find yourself scratching your head and muttering to yourself, \\"What the--?\\"  The end of the series was the end of a great disappointment that really began with Book II.  You find all loose ends tied up into too convenient, neat little bows.  The side characters are emphasized and for whatever reason, Bella becomes a very weak and indecisive character as the story progresses and Edward turns into a broken record player playing the same love song over and over and over again.<br /><br />If anything, the last book shows us a girl can scrap her goal of going to college (after barely scraping through high school since she missed so much class), without a single complaint get back together with a boyfriend who dumped her without explanation (and drove her to near suicidal tendencies), live off of her rich husband, lie and sever all ties with her living family and become a teenage mother all in the name of \\"love.\\"<br /><br />A little too unrealistic to the point of being unbelievable and strange, my greatest disappointment was that Bella turned out to have so little self worth without her Edward.  That's just too antique a notion to be selling to the teenage girls who read it.  God forbid they should actually follow her example.
B001CLG6RC|1.0|I remember a time when Enigma was synonym with great music. Not in this case. This is by far Enigma's weakest effort. The result is unfocused,  hurried, and altogether lacks the quality of prior releases. There is a general feeling of low quality and cheapness to it.Gone are the attention to detail and the quest for new and exciting sounds, and all the ones present in these records are tired repetitions of old sounds and seemed performed by some one trying to imitate Enigma.    There was a time when you could by an Enigma record without having heard it before (as I did in this case), but not anymore. The singing isn't up to par either.     A sure way to diminish their legacy.

B0019IB0II|2.0|I had high expectation for this book, but it was far less interesting than I hoped.  There were many redundant passages about being one with the universe and the state of nirvana that the author, Dr. Jill Taylor, achieved.  A good editor would have shaved off at least 20 pages. I found myself skimming over more than a few pages.  I expected more of the science; explanations were couched in simplistic terms.  Although there are descriptions of normal brain function in the beginning, the scientific discussion waned when it came to her actual situation.    After her surgery and her recovery starts, Dr. Taylor glosses over the 8 years it took her to recover to focus on the spiritual aspect of her experience.  The steady stream of new-age mysticism is attributed to right-brain function, making an argument that religious/spiritual/mystical experiences are nothing more than a few extra neurons firing here and a few less firing there.  And who knows, maybe they are.  What might be useful to hospital workers and caregivers is her need description of how their questions, demands, and posture were experienced.  She needed questions repeated slowly, not loudly.  (As she noted, she wasn't deaf, but folks would repeat a question louder as if it would make understand better.)    At the end of it, I was disappointed in this book.  Even at the Kindle price of $9.99 I would recommend waiting to pick the paperback version up for less.
B00168OINK|2.0|I loved this movie. I saw it in theaters and knew immediately that I was going to be buying the Blu-ray version.<br /><br />However. This review isn't about the movie, which is great. This review is about the Blu-ray version.<br /><br />The DVD version comes in a double pack, including the 'Secrets of the Furious Five' \\"sequel\\" to the original movie. That's a huge draw of buying this movie.<br /><br />However, the Blu-ray version not only does not have the double-pack offer, it also does not have the movie bundled onto the single blu-ray disc at all, which means if you buy this version you miss out on the new movie.<br /><br />Why on earth would anyone buy the Blu-ray version if they're missing out on the 'Secrets of the Furious Five' sequel? It seems foolish.<br /><br />Bad studio decision.
B0013FXWU6|1.0|Hard to believe this film was celebrated as one of the best of the year.  It is uninspired, with bad performances, a very superficial photography.  It hurts what a Terrence Malick woud have done with this sujet! Danel Day Lewis is a great actor but how managed Anderson to turn him into the worst performance of his career.

031606792X|4.0|I found this book as well written as the first three. The tension at the end was particularly good. Disappointment with the plotlines or the ending are no reason for a one star rating. I would have liked more battles and more bad guys toasted, but that doesn't mean it wasn't a really good read.
B000002504|5.0|Gentle Giant is eccentric, and definitely an acquired taste, even for died-in-the-wool prog rock fans.  Once you get the taste however, there's tons of good stuff to explore.  One of those cds you'll want to be sure to check out is \\"Octopus\\".  The disc opens with the epic \\"The Advent of Panurge\\" which presented themes and characters I would've liked to have seen explored more in depth.  \\"Raconteur Troubadour\\" is an ode to the medieval English troubadour, with Gentle Giant's style of olde-English melody.  \\"A Cry for Eveyone\\" is the rocker of this cd.  \\"Knots\\" is the very eccentric but delightful tune, inspired by the psychologist R.D. Laing and his use of 'intriguing, logical, poetic riddles' and as the liner notes say 'something of a musical jigsaw'.  \\"The Boys in the Band\\" is an instrumental, and a real highlight of the cd.  The song starts off with a laugh from engineer Martin Rushant and the sound of a coin spinning before taking off into a rocking musical interlude.  \\"Dog's Life\\" is probably the weakest track on the disc, an intentional ode to roadies which just comes off as corny.  \\"Think of Me with Kindness\\" is a more intimate ballad, kept simple.  Lastly, \\"River\\" returns the listener to that eccentric style so well championed by GG and is a perfect closer for the cd.    Definitely a great cd and worth the money.  5 stars.
B00009AOBI|5.0|this movie i have seen many years ago and to me is a very touching movie i feel this movie teaches you everyday lessons like no matter what you look like it's what inside that counts your heart. the movie showed where rocky had a girlfriend at camp and he went to where she lived at to see her but the girl's parents treated rocky like dirt this movie is fanastic in it's own rights! i give this movie a ton of stars!
B0015I2P0Y|4.0|\\"El-Bow!\\"    Ok, well, I meant 3 and a half stars really, but I always tend to over-club. In this case, its fair enough I suppose. Look, what I mean is this. This album is produced and performed really well, I like the Manc grittyness of the singer because I can relate to it, I found the first 2 tracks immensely personal to me, which I always like because they reflect scenarios that I can relate to. The crush on a younger woman in \\"Starlings\\" (although I find the brass bit rather annoying) and the wonderful \\"Bones of You\\" in which the way that a hearing of a long forgotten song has the ability to transport you through space and time to a relationship long gone is wonderfully realised. The rest of the album failed to engage me as intimately and deeply as those first 2 songs however, why, I dont know. Perhaps I expect too much from my music, perhaps they set the bar so high with those opening tracks, I dont know. What i do know is that these guys deserve their success, because they are are obviously putting a lot of love, thought and care into what they are doing. I hope the dreaded curse of the Mercury doesnt hurl them into oblivion (Anthony and the Johnsons or Talvin Singh anyone?) because they are worth more than that. What in my \\"record collection\\" sounds like them? If any of you have heard \\"Last Good day of the year\\" by Cousteau or \\"The Honeymoon is Over\\" by the Cruel Sea, you are probably in the right area. They are certainly in the same solar system as Snow Patrol or Coldplay, but I dont quite see connect them too readily, certainly more in common with Bell X1 perhaps. Yes, now I come ot think of it, everybody reading this rush out and buy \\"Flock\\" by Bell X1, its great!

B001JOIEZ4|2.0|I know that Stephenie Meyer listened to a lot of Muse and Linkin Park while she was writing the Twilight series, but something about electronics-laced, fast paced, techno songs does not say \\"Forks, Washington\\" to me.  Collectively, the soundtrack is not very cohesive.  The only standout tracks on the CD are Bella's Lullaby and the songs by Blue Foundation, Iron & Wine and Robert Pattinson.  Paramore was close, but somehow missed the mark for me when it came to the overall tone of the series.  They are clearly marketing this CD to the teenaged audience of Twilight (it makes perfect sense), but I hope that the soundtracks for the upcoming movies are a little more mature.  It would be nice to see a more cohesive soundtrack with songs that are a bit moodier.  I would LOVE to see Garbage (\\"The Trick is to Keep Breathing\\"?), Rilo Kiley (\\"Dreamworld\\"), Foo Fighters or Filter on the soundtracks in the future.  Also, check out \\"Twilight\\" by Future of Forestry...would've been perfect for the soundtrack.  I guess I should be thankful that the Jonas Brothers, Taylor Swift or Miley Cyrus are nowhere in sight though, right?
B000OVLBHG|3.0|Starship Troopers is a big budget action film set in a science-fiction based future where most of society is military based, and to be considered a citizen you must serve in the Terran Mobile Infantry.  This is of course based on the classic sci-fi/military novel written by Robert A. Heinlein nearly fifty years ago, which was under the same name.  The name is pretty much where the similarities between the movie and the book end.<br /><br />The plot to this film adaptation of this sci-fi classic is not handled very respectfully, Director Paul Verhoeven's sense of satire coming across as being very out of place when I first saw the film.  I was wondering if whoever owned the rights to the book knew what they were doing to the material, because I'm sure Heinlein would NOT have approved of the end result.<br /><br />I've come to accept the satirical aspects of this film, but I don't understand why they'd mock the book, as opposed to making it into an actual movie.  I get laughs out of this movie, the action is fun, though simplistic, but as an adaptation of the novel it fails on multiple levels.  I put the novel down feeling it was one of the best books I'd ever read.  When I left this film it felt like I did after every B-action film you see on an average basis; just nothing that left an impact on me like the book did.<br /><br />Total Recall and RoboCop were both handled better in regards to mixing action, sci-fi, and satire.  Starship Troopers tries hard to be those films, but ultimately fails.  Even if it wasn't supposed to be an adaptation of that novel, it still doesn't have the charm of those previous Verhoeven films.  They made us laugh at the depictions of society, as well as draw us in with engaging characters.  You don't care about any of the characters here, because they're all cardboard cut-outs and clich&eacute;s, not worth anyone's time.  Out of all the movies disappointed me, this one is up there as one of my biggest let-downs.<br /><br />I really have nothing much left to say, other than I was incredibly disappointed by Verhoeven, and the production team for not providing a better film.<br /><br />6/10 starsthan I was incredibly disappointed by Verhoeven, and the production team for not providing a better film.      6/10 stars
B000E33VWW|4.0|This film makes clear the toll writing his masterpiece took on Capote, though I'm sure the facts are somewhat less stark. Still, great performance by Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Great score, and the casting overall is excellent. This one is less dramatic that the rival bio-pic and tones down the Capote/Smith 'romance.' It's worth watching both to compare, but neither replaces the book.
B000P0J0AQ|5.0|Beginning this review I was writing the film's title and ended up with \\"The Mainstream\\" (100% accident) which pretty much sums up the premise of The Matrix franchise.  The Matrix is good in the fact that it takes complex science-fiction from previous 1990s films that didn't quite meet mainstream audiences (Dark City, 12 Monkeys) and merges it with the spectacular CGI effects of an action film.  As an action film The Matrix is incredibly successful and deserves great recognition as one of the best films of the 1990s, or the past two decades for that matter.  However I do feel let down by the fact that I felt cheated by the story when they didn't try to further flesh out the world it took place in.<br /><br />My main problem with the film falls on the fact that, as an avid sci-fi fan, I had already seen most of the concepts The Matrix presented in previous films (go back to the two I listed above).  The religious spin on things however does really make it interesting, kind of like a science-fiction version of some religious document, but a human being having special abilities and saving a captive human population from a controlling force which had everyone living in a false reality had already been used in Dark City back in 1996.  This, among other things, is one of the reasons I don't give The Matrix a perfect score of 10/10.<br /><br />As a sci-fi film it was very good, regardless of how many of the elements that it was reusing from other films, but I often felt like the production team couldn't decide on whether or not they wanted an action picture, or a thought stimulating sci-fi epic.  By the end however The Matrix does succeed in balancing these two things very nicely.  The CGI deserved its Academy Award, because it really is amazing some of the things they were able to pull off.<br /><br />The acting in this film was grade-A, and one of the strongest aspects of the film's production, and there was only ONE performance that failed to catch my attention...sadly this performance (my opinion) came from the star of the film: Keanu Reeves.  Reeves has had his moments throughout his career, don't get me wrong, back in the late 1980s (most will remember the Bill & Ted films) he was a rather likable young actor, even in his lesser known performances; he seemed very honest and sincere in his performances.  A change came about when he announced he was going to \\"take acting more seriously\\".  The result, in my mind, was horrific!  He comes across now as someone with very little emotion, and just doesn't seem really human.<br /><br />I had the same problem with Keanu in the action movie, Speed, which followed the Die Hard franchise, but unlike Bruce Willis, I couldn't connect, or really care about Reeves in this film (similar feeling in Bram Stoker's Dracula, but he wasn't TOO bad in that film), which was certainly on par with the Die Hard films in production and story.  Same problem is present in The Matrix.  Reeves is trying way too hard to seem serious, and dramatic, and in the end comes across as being artificial, and dull.  If that was the director's intention, I don't really care, because I felt this was a character the audience should have been able to relate to and care about, but that's just my opinion and you don't have to agree with me (just giving an honest view from my perspective).<br /><br />Okay, I've given my criticisms, but now I have to say what was really good about The Matrix, and there are a lot of good aspects of this film which is why it deserves my high rating (and a spot in my DVD collection).  The action is well-done, and truly is an eye opener, and as I previously stated the performances are mostly strong.  Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) and Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith) are very good in their respective roles, and both (as most people will say) are embraced as engaging characters in the mind of the audience, while Reeves was more of a vehicle to channel elaborate action sequences (the highlight, in most people's opinion, of the film).  Also the Wachowski Brother's film is simply beautiful to look at, from the all CGI sequences to the live sets.  The sequels, which go purely into action, prove that this film could have been a much worse (I don't hate the sequels, they just are not really sci-fi; just action films).<br /><br />This film really does have all it needs to work as a successful film, especially in the mainstream Hollywood of this day and age.  It would have been braver for the filmmakers to try and expand, and concentrate on the complex science-fiction aspects, instead of the action, but then it wouldn't have been the box-office success it was.  I would defend them no matter what, but when you go against the powers if mainstream and the production companies and end up with a good film you'll always have me backing up your film...of course I will be critical if the plot and direction is bad, but at least I'll give you a positive word for daring to be different.<br /><br />I can only hope that The Matrix can help get moviegoers into the lesser known art-house science-fiction stories that inspired it, because it's a shame that our modern audiences can't seem to appreciate things that don't fuse with action or comedy, because I don't feel science-fiction was ever really intended to be a genre simply designed to create exciting action sequences.<br /><br />The Matrix was a great film, deserving its mainstream applause: Solid 9/10 starsthe Wachowski Brother's film is simply beautiful to look at, from the all CGI sequences to the live sets.

B00003CXZ4|5.0|With his second feature film, director Christopher Nolan ([[ASIN:B00000F3CD Following]]) created a stunning thriller. Not only is Memento an incredible accomplishment as a film, but also an impressive feat for a relatively new filmmaker. The film's screenplay, which was written by Nolan and was inspired by his brother Jonathan's short story, is nothing short of brilliant. The story taps the best ideas from both classic noir and detective films of the late 1940s, as well as more contemporary psychological suspense films, and the result is a film, which is in essence a neo-noir/thriller. Skillfully, Christopher Nolan avoids the all-too-familiar pitfalls of the two genres while acknowledging their inherent strengths. Rich in atmosphere and character, Memento is a modern classic and a prime example of using an intricate narrative to heighten a story's impact.    Ever since his wife was assaulted, Leonard Shelby (marvelously portrayed by Guy Pearce) has suffered from a rare disorder. His mind is incapable of creating new memories, so everything he has experienced since the attack he forgets in a matter of minutes. Left with little to live for, Leonard vows that he will avenge his wife... but this proves to be difficult without his short-term memory. Leonard relies on mementos (lists, notes, photographs, and even tattoos) to aid him in his search for the killer, but he is also forced to trust strangers. Among those that he confides in are Teddy (played by Joe Pantoliano, with an irritating smirk) a sarcastic snitch with connections on both sides of the law and Natalie (played by Carrie-Anne Moss, who straddles the line between sympathetic victim and sadistic seductress), the girlfriend of a missing drug dealer. As Leonard follows the clues it becomes apparent that the people he surround himself with are not what he perceived them to be. They are either exploiting his disability for their own gain or manipulating him to keep him from the shocking truth about his wife's death and the identity of her killer. Leonard realizes that he can trust no one, not even himself.    When Memento was released, it was hailed as a visionary piece of filmmaking and it's clear that the greatest star of the film is its story, which unfolds in a series of segments shown in reversed chronological order. This method, which might have spoiled the ending in any other film, is miraculous in that it places the story's climax in the beginning of the film and then allows the audience to see what events lead up to that final act. In recent years many filmmakers have played with viewers' expectations and intentionally subverted those expectations, leading to mixed results. Often filmmakers that embrace such an unorthodox narrative to tell a story do so to individualize their films, but if their films had were to be edited into a more typical narrative structure, then they would lose their originality. Not so with Memento. Its narrative isn't just a manipulative gimmick to keep audiences interested. The story almost requires this dyslexic treatment so that viewers will gain greater insight into the protagonist's dilemma. Another unique aspect is its psychological inner workings, which suggests many things about the nature of corruption and revenge. If one were capable of forgetting their past transgressions, are they then purified by their ignorance of those transgressions or are they forever condemned to suffer the consequences of their actions... again... and again... and again? Do our memories determine who we are or does our character shape our memories to suit our needs? If only we knew; if only we could remember.

B0018QQQK8|1.0|For me this is the worst book that Sparks has written. Having read all of his other books and loved them, I could not get past the third chapter. I know others loved the book but it just isn't for me.
B000N4SHPS|2.0|Everything that made the best \\"Rocky\\" movies (\\"Rocky,\\" \\"Rocky III,\\" and \\"Rocky IV\\") blissfully entertaining appears conspicuously absent in Sylvester Stallone's new movie \\"Rocky Balboa\\" (** out of ****), reputedly the last Harri for the \\"Rocky\\" character. Chiefly, \\"Rocky Balboa\\" lacks spontaneity and surprises. Indeed, actor/athletic Sylvester Stallone looks--for a man in his sixties--like he could go the distance in the ring, but writer/director Sylvester Stallone virtually recycles the original without anything that made it Academy Awarding material. In \\"Rocky,\\" Stallone created a charming Brando-esquire misfit, surrounded by other larger-than-life misfits, who slugged his way to the top of the American dream. Each sequel eroded the title character's charisma, and you knew that \\"Rocky\\" could never go down for the count. Worse, Stallone's trademark aphoristic dialogue yields few quotable lines. Another element woefully amiss is a solid villain. A third of what made \\"Rocky,\\" \\"Rocky III,\\" and \\"Rocky IV\\" engaging on a visceral level were the opponents. Carl Weathers established the baseline for Rocky's rivals in the first two \\"Rocky\\" movies, while a pugnacious Mr. T raised the bar in \\"Rocky III\\" and Goliath-like Dolph Lundgren took it one punch further in \\"Rocky IV.\\" Not surprisingly, \\"Rocky Balboa\\" should take the bad taste of \\"Rocky V\\" out of the mouth of \\"Rocky\\" fans. \\"Rocky V\\" featured the least intimidating contender of the series. Unfortunately, as much as \\"Rocky Balboa\\" surpasses \\"Rocky V,\\" Rocky's latest adversary is bland to his boxers. Mason Dixon emerges as more vulnerable than vicious. You won't care if Rocky beats him to a pulp, gets beaten to a pulp himself, or they fight to a draw in \\"Rocky Balboa.\\" This painfully predictable punching bag of clich&eacute;s never generates the blood, sweat, and cheers of the original.<br /><br />Anybody who remembers the forgettable \\"Rocky V\\" knows that the doctors warned Rocky that if he ever climbed back into the ring that he could possibly die from one blow to the brain. In \\"Rocky Balboa,\\" Rocky's physical ailments never impair his potential. Aside from a brief bout with the Pennsylvania boxing commission, Rocky obtains a license to box again. During the first hour of the action, our world-weary hero revisits his past on a sight-seeing trip to his old stomping grounds where he grew up and met his wife Adrian. Adrian has followed in the footsteps of more memorable \\"Rocky\\" characters, such as Apollo Creed and actor Burgess Meredith's Mickey Goldmill. We learn in \\"Rocky Balboa\\" that Adrian died from cancer back in the 1990s, and Rocky supports himself with a Philadelphia restaurant named after her. He recounts his pugilistic exploits for the entertainment of his customers. Meanwhile, in the ring, the latest heavyweight boxing champ Mason \\"the Line\\" Dixon (ex-light heavyweight champ Antonio Tarver) finds himself tangled up in the ropes of his own troubles. After 30 knock-out fights, the undefeated Dixon cannot find anybody to go toe-to-toe with who can match his merciless barrage of blows. Worse, just about everybody in the fight game hates him. Sure, Dixon sounds like a terrific adversary, but Stallone gives Tarver nothing to do or say that makes his character remotely dangerous. He never attains the flamboyance of the egotistical Apollo Creed in the first three \\"Rocky\\" epics. He doesn't present a challenge like the sadistic Clubber Lang in \\"Rocky III.\\" Physically, he is no match for towering Ivan Drago in \\"Rocky IV.\\" Instead, Mason Dixie emerges more as misunderstood than merciless.<br /><br />During his tour of his old neighborhood, Rocky runs into a local girl from his past. Marie (as played by the original \\"Marie\\" Geraldine Hughes) told him to bug off in the original when he offered her advice about her friends. Marie and Rocky get friendly this time around and the ex-champ shows an interest in her fatherless son. Unfortunately, the romance between Marie and Rocky ignites no sparks because the chemistry between them is wrong. At the same time, Rocky's own son Rocky, Jr. (Milo Ventimiglia who plays Peter Petrelli on the NBC/SCI-FI Channel TV show \\"Heroes\\") has his own selfish issues. Rocky overshadows him. At one point, Rocky confides in his boorish brother-in-law Paulie (Burt Young of \\"The Killer Elite\\") that he still has his own unresolved issues. Paulie thinks Rocky has lost his mind when he proposes to put the gloves back on for one more bout. The inevitable fight between Rocky and Mason Dixon occurs as a result of an ESPN computer generated boxing match that prompts Mason's managers to approach Rocky about a match. Mason Dixie derides it as a publicity stunt, but Rocky sees it as a place in the sun. \\"Rocky Balboa\\" boasts too much soul and not enough heart. Cue \\"Rocky\\" composer Bill Conti to bring on the music from the original as Rocky jogs around Philadelphia in his sweats training.<br /><br />Sylvester Stallone looks more muscle-bound than ever, but he does not have the underdog charisma of the best \\"Rocky\\" movies. Clearly, Stallone has gone into the ring one time too often. The Rocky character has never looked so out of place and his actions do little to endear him. Stallone's worst mistake in \\"Rocky Balboa\\" was sacrificing Adrian from his screenplay than his obnoxious, cigar-chomping brother-in-law Paulie. The first hour of the new \\"Rocky\\" drags and the last forty minutes doesn't make up for it. Stallone stages the boxing match without flair. Amazingly, the hand-held photography doesn't add energy to the fight. Despite some moments that remain too far and few between, \\"Rocky Balboa\\" has no clout to flout.stry between them is wrong.

I was also expecting something more simple and just piano, but then i reached a review that had this link     [...]    and i started to read carter burnwell idea of the lullaby.     It completly changed my idea of it, for him the song is not a lullaby is a love theme about edward and bella's love, it had to be named bella's lullaby cuz of high executives decided it.    And also the song is adapted to the movie, it has some bacground music but its all to fit the movie.    Please read what he has to say before you say I DONT LIKE IT.    [...]      keep in mind that for the movie, this is a  love song, or love theme, but not exactly bellas lulluby although it has that  name, and that everyone of us  made our own song when we read the books, so, its kinda hard to match your own.  Listen to it more than once, you'll find out that it does capture some cool things about their love.

B0000DZEE3|5.0|Red Hot Chili Peppers have been around for over twenty years now, it's hard to believe they are almost old enough to be in the rock hall of fame. Most bands wither apart after years of fame and success. RHCP have become an even tighter pact. \\"Live At Slane Castle\\" is an unforgettably powerful live concert.<br /><br />From the intense camera angles and fluidity between these funkafied vets, you're getting your moneys worth. The song selection is top notch. Released before \\"Stadium Arcadium\\",  RHCP displays mainly \\"Californication\\" era material and \\"Bye The way\\" (which at the time was their newest release). Two songs from the classic \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\\" (RHCP's fifth studio release) make an appearance too. Those being \\"Give it Away\\" and \\"Under The Bridge\\" both relatively big RHCP hits.<br /><br />The ideal musicianship for modern day rock acts is diminishing, you'd never guess with these guys. Improvising has always played a part in the bands live acts, watch as they unfold a jam without missing a beat. Flea and Chad jamming, trumpet and drum. Everything feels top notch here, the menus aren't gimmicky, the sound quality is top notch, they caught the band in an amazing performance, and best of all it's almost 2 hours (well just shy as it's about an hour and forty-two minutes). The atmosphere and crowd is astounding. Take a look at the cover and tell me you can't estimate the proportions of such a concert. The background effects are interesting, and a cover of the Ramones track \\"Havana Affair\\" even comes into play here.<br /><br />Only gripe if any is that it has to end. \\"Soul to Squeeze\\" was removed from the footage due to the guitarist (John Frusciante) breaking a string. Another interesting fact, this is RHCP's second time performing at Slane castle, once before in 2001. Really can't trump this card, RHCP have made one of the best live performances of all time.
B00151HZME|3.0|Although there are still enough crests of certifiable synthesizer beauty, this ode to the new wa-80's walks the line between inspired emulations and cheesy imitations all too often, feeling light around the edges in favor of an all-encompassing aesthetic theme that seems less inviting then before.
0765316897|5.0|Definitely belongs in the list of greatest of all time trilogies (g.o.a.t). Sanderson is to Fantasy what Michael Jordan was to basketball. This book was awesome and totally unpredictable. It wasn't like a lot of the formulaic fantasy's where everyone lives happily ever after,no one dies, and the hero has no flaws (eg. R.A. Salvatore novels, Terry Goodkind novels, Terry Brooks novels, etc). I would place Sanderson on my short list of greatest authors (with series)which includes Roger Zelazny (Amber), Tolkien (Lord of the Rings),Raymond Feist (Magician), C.S. Lewis (Narnia),  Michael Moorcock (Elric of Melnibone), Neil Gaiman (American Gods), Steven King (The Dark Tower), Dan Simmons (Hyperion), Isaac Asimov (Foundation), Phillip Pullman (His Dark Materials), George Martin (A song of Fire & Ice), Fred Saberhagen (Empire of the East), Ursula LeGuin (Earthsea), Scott Michael Rohan(Winter of the World), C.S. Friedman(The Coldfire Trilogy), too many to name in this space. They definitely picked the right person to write the conclusion of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series. Peace.
B000QCUB8I|3.0|Although clearly going for the title next Daft Punk by exerting a highly refined, expertly produced signature sound of glowing keyboards and pulsing beats, this disc, especially in the latter half, falls short of lofty ambitions and becomes a clear-cut party disc without the benefit of it being much past that.

B001DPC52C|5.0|Tout simplement renversant, la qualité visuelle est impeccable et la piste audio l'est tout autant! Je m'attendais à quelque chose de très bon connaissant Within Temptation mais ce spectacle est au-delà de mes attentes. Les voix riches et très justes de Sharon del Adel et de ses invités nous éblouissent, l'orchestre Métropolitain et les choristes s'harmonisent parfaitement aux chansons présentées. Un des meilleurs spectacles que j'aie vu à présent...
0385340540|2.0|Most of John's books are good. I loved the Firm. This one was a huge disappointment. Slow moving. I read the whole book waiting for something exciting to happen and it never did. Totally anti climatic.    Only good part was the experience of seeing the character adapt to Italian life.

B000HIVIOW|5.0|Whenever I leave for home, after a family holiday, I always get a sense of bitter/sweet melancholy. \\"The Snowman\\" perfectly mirrors that feeling for me. The biggest reason for that, aside from the gentleness of the story as presented, is the incredible music. \\"The Snowman\\" is simple grandeur.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|The 2 dvd was well worth the money.  I loved the movie and the extra cd is a great addition.  You get to see the history of the book, behind the scenes, and interviews with the actors.  This is just what I was looking for.

Perfect for anyone 13 or over looking for a movie with a good combanation of moods, a creapy, but also funny  appearance, and thair first \\"older person\\" storyline.

B001ED7C58|1.0|I am a HUGE fan and have read all 4 books. I was anxiously awaiting this soundtrack.  Why did Stephenie Meyers not ask Evanescence to create a song or two for the movie?  This is exactly up their alley.  Amy could have created a much nicer piano for Bella's Lullaby. Sorry fans but I have to be honest.  THe album is mediocre.
B001C3KCSY|5.0|It took me a while to like Because of the Times.  In fact I had to see KOL live in Birmingham last year to really give it a shot.  Since it was so different from Youth and Young Manhood - my favorite album EVER! But the more I heard it the more it stuck to me.  That's why when I got Only by the Night for my birthday, I decided I wouldn't judge it on the first listen.  Though I'd heard Sex on Fire and Use Somebody on SNL, so that was out, I already liked the record.  Having listened to it about a thousand times the past two weeks, I must say there are songs in there that give me goosebumps, not least of which Cold Dessert, which has such power and passion.  The first time I blasted Use Somebody on the stereo I cried.  Therefore, I must say this is KOL's most emotional work yet, which for some bands might mean sappy Air Supply crap, but not the Followills, whom I would consider incapable of bad music - at least we could hope.
B00004WEJZ|3.0|I wouldn't go out of my way for this if I wasn't a Bond completist, but NSNA seems to me to be a fair-to-middling Bond outing that compares favorably to its contemporary (1983) 'official' competition, OCTOPUSSY.  Despite a low budget the film doesn't feel cheap, the recycled plot is one of the better ones, and Connery, although hamming it up a bit as a middle-aged superspy, is still everybody's favorite Bond.<br /><br />If you're comparing this to the early Connery, or even the Pierce Brosnan period, forget it - done at the height (depth?) of the Roger Moore period, NSNA is full of tongue-in-cheek, but handled better, IMHO, than the corny Moore scripts.  Q-Algy was less overdone than John Cleese, though James Fox's \\"M\\" dialogue was sometimes a bit too over-the-top, Barbara Carrera had to make do with a part that was all ham, and Rowan Atkinson - well, was Rowan Atkinson, which should tell you all you need to know about THAT!  On the other hand Klaus Maria Brandauer was a SUPERB villain; Max Von Sydow was kind of wasted in the Blofeld role, but I prefer him to Telly Savalas!?!  Kim Basinger was decent eye-candy; the rest of the roles were adequately handled.<br /><br />There are some distinct weaknesses in NSNA, particularly the flat and somewhat absurd climax (why would Domino have been there at all?!?) but the fight scenes were generally good, and Brandauer rises above the material to be, IMHO, the best villain since GOLDFINGER (at least until DIE ANOTHER DAY.)<br /><br />MY DVD *I* have HAS the full scene of Bond approaching Domino in the casino and offering her an apology and a drink.  According to some there are bad disks out there, so beware!
B001GAPC1K|4.0|From what i have seen Iron Man is a ok movie. It has a decent plot but the acting could have been better. It was a big buget movie but like I said the acting could have been better. Dont get me wrong it was a good movie all around movie. but i give it a four out of five stars.     Iron man started out really slow. This was supposed to be a action movie but, the action didnt start until the middle of the movie. when the action came in it was when he ws braking out of the cave in the desert.     alot of people thought that it was goign to be just another crapy marvel movie like fantastic four it was actually really good.
B00012FXB8|1.0|1. We don't learn anything new about the Aliens. THE STORY REAKS!<br />2. Instead of making this movie about the Aliens, the producers make this movie about Ripley's emotional journey.<br />3. It does not add to the storyline: What about the company? Where did these creatures come from? How can they grow so fast? Are they intelligent?<br />4. It doesn't make sense: How did an egg get on board and kill Newt and Hicks. If Ripley is infected, why does she live so long?<br />5. They kill off two great characters: Newt and Hicks. Oh and the Android.<br />6. They almost completely ignore all the work that was done in the previous films.<br />7. The film is cut poorly and is very choppy.<br />8. THE PLOT AND THE TOTAL DIRECTION OF THIS FILM IS BAD. It should of never been made and the producers and the director and all the writers should be shot! THEY SCREWED OVER ALL THE FANS OF THE FIRST TWO MOVIES, WHICH ARE CLASSICS. SHAME ON YOU!<br /><br />I HATE FOX STUDIOS. THIS MOVIE IS HORRIBLE. THE PRODUCERS STINK.<br /><br />P.S. The people who try to reevalute Alien 3 as good are only doing so because of David Finchers later works. He hates this movie and won't own up to it. DIsaster.
B0016Q2D5M|1.0|I love Brendan Fraser. I would see him in any film, even in one as awful as this. So if was difficult to only give this film a single star. But even the affable Fraser cannot save this bad film. This is a film that only a six year old can enjoy. Perhaps I should have had one to sit and watch with me. This film needed a little more attention to detail. A better script and less reliance on 3D visual effects. Perhaps then it would have  been an enjoyable, if mindless, entertainment.  My thoughts while watching my 2D DVD version was that the film must have been originally developed as an animated feature film. It has that ridiculousness in both plot and acting that seem more appropriate in a Saturday morning cartoon. For example, take the falling down the hole sequence. The main characters scream cartoon voices  and converse in whole sentences while flaying their arms as they fall endlessly downward. Sort of like 'Alice in Wonderland'. Another example is the sequence win which the younger hero (the oldest looking 13 years old I've seen on screen for a long time), traverses a chasm by hoping and sliding on magnetized boulders. The laws of physics be damned!  Worse yet, the DVD's 3D version uses the aged green/red 3D cardboard glasses technology that makes the film almost un-viewable.  If you somehow manage to sit through the complete film using these glasses, be prepared for a headache and sore eyeballs. I assume that the theatrical version used the superior polarized glasses similar to the ones used in Beowulf 3D.
B000000W5L|5.0|Completing the sequence from Beggars Banquet, Let it Bleed, Sticky Fingers (which was filled with drug references) to Exile (which exuded the stuff).   First off, the LP double is a masterpiece. The CD is not bad, but does not compare, being thin and lacking balls. When this came out, and today a lot of people complain about the muddy, impenetrable sound. Compared to Sticky Fingers or Let It Bleed, Exile on Main Street was tightly wrapped and everything seemed to be coming at you compressed in space. This was the complexity of the arrangements. A high quality turntable and ampflier demonstrate that both the recording of the individual instruments and voices and the mix are superb. The problem is, no cheap turntable and certainly no cheap plastic rack CD player has any hope of making sense of the dense mix.     \\"Rocks Off\\", Mick's voice is center stage and in front of the band. If you can't make out the words its because he's purposefully slurring them.   This is one of the great Stones albums, four high energy sides.     Exile shines with a sparkle of cocaine while at hanging under the weight of heroin.     A superb effort, but not what you would call \\"accessible\\".

NTSC format.  Region 0.  Running time = 2 hours approximately.  Authored by Abbey Road Interactive.  LPCM audio.  DVD audio restoration:  Andy Walter.<br /><br />In late September 2008 Orchestral Manoeuvres In The Dark celebrated their 30th anniversary with the Virgin/EMI release of 'Messages - OMD's Greatest Hits', a CD & DVD retrospective.  The CD features 20 classic OMD tracks, from their very first single, 1979's \\"Electricity\\", to 1996's hit, \\"Walking On The Milky Way\\".  The DVD features, for the very first time, all 31 promo videos.  Note that the 1998 \\"Enola Gay [Sash Remix]\\" promo video for the 1998 'Singles' release is missing.<br /><br />The remastering on the CD, in my opinion, ranges from good to excellent.  The liner notes do not list any mastering credits for the CD.  My understanding is that EMI used previous remasters for most of the tracks featured on the CD.  Tracks 1 and 3-6 are apparently the 2003 digital remasters by Simon Heyworth.  Track 2, the Martin Zero mix of \\"Electricity\\", which also featured on the 1988 [[ASIN:B000026GGC The Best of OMD]] collection and the 1998 [[ASIN:B00000DMH5 The OMD Singles]], was not included on the 2003 first album remaster.  According to information on the official OMD site, one reason why this package was delayed was due to finding an improved master for \\"Electricity\\".  So, as far as I know, \\"Electricity\\" is a new 2008 digital remaster.<br /><br />Tracks 7-8 are apparently the new 2008 digital remasters by Arun Chakraverty, as featured on the 25th anniversary release of [[ASIN:B0013E4D9G Dazzle Ships]].  The remainder of the tracks, 9-20, on the other hand, are, as far as I can hear, the 1998 digital remasters used on the 'Singles' retrospective.  How can I tell?  Well, earlier tracks like \\"Locomotion\\" and \\"So In Love\\" sound the same as the 1998 remasters.  Andy McCluskey also confirmed on the official site that the 1998 remasters would be used for these tracks as well.<br /><br />So what does this have to do with anything?  Personally, I think that all tracks featured on the CD should have been given a fresh new 2008 remaster by a new mastering engineer.  The 1998 remasters sound good, but I still think that the mastering could have been improved on a number of these 1998 remasters.  \\"So In Love\\", for example, has always sounded relatively flat to me, even in it's 1998 remaster.  Perhaps this is the result of the production.  Maybe it needs a new remix?  Standing next to 2008 remasters such as \\"Genetic Engineering\\" and 2003 remasters like \\"Messages\\" make these 1998 remasters sound a little dated.<br /><br />Including 20 tracks on one disc over such a massive career is quite a squeeze!  Nonetheless, I think that, for the most part, the right tracks were chosen.  \\"Dazzle Ships At The River\\", a Groove Armada mash-up, was originally scheduled to be included but was pulled at the last minute due to licensing issues.  \\"Telegraph\\", which was originally missing, was replaced, thankfully.<br /><br />The DVD is the main reason to buy this release, in my opinion.  Finally fans get a chance to view 31 of the band's promo videos over the years, some for the very first time!  \\"Red Frame/White Light\\" makes it's debut here!  The master tape for this promo video apparently got ruined, leaving the band to use a VHS source for this release.  The quality, despite a few jitters and lines here and there, is surprisingly good, considering it's age.  \\"Enola Gay\\" is the UK version of the video, featuring more close-up shots of Andy.<br /><br />Overall, the video quality of the DVD is good to excellent.  I had the privilege of watching \\"Enola Gay\\" on a big screen plasma tv, and it looked stunning for a 1980 promo.  My guess is that all the promo videos, with the exception of \\"Red Frame/White Light\\", were pulled from the original masters.<br /><br />So how's the audio track for the videos?  For the most part, good.  Most of the videos have been re-syncronized with digitally remastered audio by Andy Walter.  However, I have noted a few audio flaws in a couple of promos.  \\"Genetic Engineering\\" sounds a bit muffled, as if the audio track may have been remastered from a mediocre source.  \\"So In Love\\", unfortunately, is the original audio soundtrack, sounding flat and fuzzy like an old VHS copy.  \\"Secret\\", the following track, is an improvement, and \\"La Femme Accident\\" suddenly sounds excellent.  Why include a few tracks with poor/mediocre audio quality?  One would think that these things would be double checked before sending the DVD to the presses.  I guess not!<br /><br />Nonetheless, complaints aside, I still have to give this release 5 stars for the generosity of the band and record label for including this many promo videos!  I don't think that many fans would have ever imagined getting these videos on DVD after all this time.  I am very excited since I have not seen most of these videos, since OMD were never really that big in the U.S. and received limited play on MTV.  Most of these 'Sight & Sound' releases by EMI tend to leave out numerous videos, yet Andy and company went the extra mile here to ensure that most everything made the DVD!<br /><br />If you want a trip down memory lane or if you are just discovering this brilliant underrated band for the first time, I highly recommend this package!ster.

B000E41MS6|1.0|I watched this last night, on a DVD rented from netflix, and I must say I am fairly dissapointed. I'm glad I didn't buy it, because it really is not worth the price to own this piece of dreck. The effects are awful, even worse than the old (and fun) Doctor Who. The sets in a Godzilla movie are more convincing than the sets here. Billie Piper has the acting talent of a soup can. And it was racist of them to put in the cowering black guy. At best buy it costs $84.99. It hardly looks like BBC had that budget. Obviously made for kids, but we can give them a little credit here! I hope primeval is better.
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|I've heard / read others write CLOVERFIELD off as a BLAIR WITCH PROJECT rip-off. That's pretty amusing, considering the way BLAIR WITCH owes it's entire existence to CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST (released many years earlier)! Besides, CLOVERFIELD is at least an invigorating experience, while BLAIR WITCH is about as frightening as Casper the friendly ghost! CLOVERFIELD features a hideous behemoth, smashing buildings and slaughtering thousands. BW had some folks running around in the woods, scared by off-camera noises. There's simply NO comparison! I do admit that the bachelor party stuff is weak, but once the creepy critter shows up, all is forgiven! And yes, when watched in total darkness, this movie accomplishes the illusion of inserting the viewer into the story. Just let yourself go w/ it. It's a lot of fun! 4½ stars rounded up to 5...
B0015DWJX2|5.0|[[ASIN:0385340990 The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society]] This book was a delight. The characters were wonderful and I hated for the book to end. There was just the right balance of historical details and story. I also really enjoyed the format of letters written by different characters. It allowed a glimpse into the different perspectives. Anybody who enjoys historical fiction should enjoy this novel.

B001EZ78T6|2.0|Being a big fan of John Legend's previous two albums, it's really hard to imagine this being his third album.  Whatever happened to the passionate piano pieces that were found in \\"So High\\", \\"Ordinary People\\" and \\"We Just Don't Care\\"?  The cheeky themes and lyrics found in \\"She Don't Have To Know\\" and \\"Number One\\"?  The smooth tunes of \\"Save Room\\" and \\"Slow Dance\\"?    'Evolver' feels like a manufactured compilation of samples and beats which play in the background while Legend tries akwardly to fit in with his soulful crooning.  While the previous albums lacked the big name collaborations featured in this album, this album lacked the originality and passion that made John Legend a star.  And that, at the end of the day, is really what music is about.    The album title may be named 'Evolver', but this seems like a step back towards manufactured Pop/R&B that's playing on the radio.  Stick with Legend's previous albums.

1433502399|4.0|My wife and I read through the entire ESV in 2004, and found the translation to be very accurate, even better than the NAS in many places. So, I really like the translation, which is much superior to the NIV. I received my burgundy genuine leather ESV Study Bible this week, and am very pleased with the quality of binding, print size, intros, layout, notes, articles, maps, etc. Only one negative. I would suggest that you examine one in a Bible bookstore before ordering, since they are larger than most other study Bibles. That doesn't bother me, but it might some people. Otherwise, I would give 5 stars to this excellent study Bible.
B0015I2P0Y|5.0|Saw this group playing on the Sundance Channel and took a chance on this CD based on the three songs I heard.  This is a wonderful CD aimed at people longing for something not aimed at \\"tweens,\\" indies or hip hop. (although some of the lyrics might make an English teacher cringe).  It's rock 'n' roll like it should be for the new century - slightly bluesy, slightly sad, slightly feel good.  I can't imagine the song \\"It's A Beautiful Day\\" not becoming a top 40 hit once some radio station not owned by Clear Channel takes a chance to give it air play.  Look forward to seeing these guys picking up a grammy for this one in '09!

I couldn't turn the pages fast enouigh and had to stop myself from reading ahead. It's rare that i'm so impressed with a story that when I get the last page, I seriouly considered turning back to the begining and reading the book again. I also put Paper Towns on my list of audiobooks to buy list, which is really the highest praise I can give a novel. This was my first John Green book but i'm sure it won't be the last.

0316067598|5.0|Whether you are a fan of war stories or not, this book is truly inspiring. It speaks of unfailing dedication to our country, one's friends, ethics/morals and tradition. Read this book and you will NEVER feel sorry for yourself or any hardships you may encounter. All I can say is that I am glad (and proud) that our country has a warrior class like these elite soldiers. The ones who \\"get the job done\\" while the rest of us enjoy our relative safety and freedom. Bravo Marcus...and Thank You.
B000002MIY|4.0|While good and a grand listen, it represent just half of Steely Dan. About two-thirds of the magic is there, too. Worthwhile and some songs really kick it, so get it and groove it.
B001ECE6C6|5.0|Despite having followed Pat Metheny's career for thirty years, I was unprepared for this wonderful, sensual, deeply compelling album.   New arrangements of some of Metheny's most beautiful compositions are interwoven with exquisite traditional and original music by Anna Maria Jopek, whose ethereal voice is an instrument in itself.  In this collection there is both great joy and great respect for the music heritage of Poland, and for Metheny's rich and deeply moving jazz.
B000002JK4|5.0|Robert Plant hits a ultra-smooth groove with this collection of songs that wail and croon in turns. Such suaveness and hip-cool delivery frimly spike this set into a deep part of your psyche. So mellow.
0375826726|4.0|the story starts off great with a lot of meaty action. however when smoke clears, and the dust settled and all is calm agian, it takes a little too long to get to more action. i love the inheritance trilogy and couldn't wait for this third addition(see nissanzfin3st.blogspot.com), my expectations were set on high because of the second book [[ASIN:0440238498 Eldest (Inheritance)]] but i may just be an impatient person but i think certian scences took too long to get over with. though, when they do get to the meaty scences the book kicks it up ten notches. the ability Paolini has to drag some one into a book is amazing. you will feel everything, hear everything, and see everything with all your own five senses.              all in all, this is a masterpiece, and i recommend it too all who seek thrill, adventure, and- OH YES- DRAGONS!

This is a good book it really helps understand what life was like for Jews back in the days it also help inspire you to never stop living life no matter what your going through.

B0017CW5J4|5.0|[[ASIN:B0017CW5J4 Blue Man Group: How to Be a Megastar Live! [Blu-ray]]]<br /><br />A feast for the eye's and ears. Almost as good as going to the actual show without having to worry about getting wet or having a stick cam shoved in your mouth.<br /><br />On the Blu Ray version, be sure to go into Setup from the main menu. There is an uncompressed 5.1 PCM audio option. It's only listed as English 5.1 on the cover.
B001ED7C58|2.0|Honestly, I'm sort of disappointed. It's like they completely ignored Stephenie Meyers' own soundtracks. They should've borrowed inspiration from her playlists instead of choosing to make an alternative/disco soundtrack for Twilight. Paramore did a great job. I'm avoiding listening to Bella's lullaby. Linkin Park did a great job.<br />Where's Blue October?<br />How the could be left off? Honestly. The lead singer of Blue October went on a book tour with Stephenie-I bet he's feeling like they slapped him in the face.<br />The peppy dance grooves do not belong here, where are the love songs? If you were going to go all alternative on us why didn't you go to a more appropriate song?<br /><br />I hope the soundtrack isn't a reflection of how the movie is going to be.
B001E2JNA6|5.0|After two dreadful DVD releases (the first and the 10th anniversary edition) in which all of the warmth had been drained from the glorious original 16mm print as seen on TV and on VHS, the BBC/A&E and 2 Entertain have finally repented and this, one of television's most beloved series has been restored to its former beauty. In 2005 I foolishly bought the 10th Anniversary Edition as the cover art-work suggested that the problems with the original transfer had been corrected. Upon viewing it, I wrote to the head of BBC in Australia with the challenge that if she could find any of the colours on the packaging actually on the DVD, I would happily walk naked down a Melbourne street at peak hour. Luckily for the locals, none could be found, and the offending item was returned. Now I am delighted to say that the original warmth has been lovingly restored in the Blu-Ray edition. Yes, as previous reviewers have stated, it was not shot in HD, nor even in 35mm - just humble 16mm, and at times some of the long-shots are not entirely distinct - yet it is a small quibble, and this is well worth the purchase to be able to once again see this iconic series in the rich tapestry of colours in which it was originally made. Thank you BBC/A&E/2 Entertain for restoring a true gem.
1594489505|5.0|This is a must read if you have read Kite Runner.  I loved this book from start to finish.
0061245097|3.0|I almost put this book down after the first 50 or so pages.  I can't stand how much the main character complains that her vampire boyfriend isn't around anymore.  SHE left HIM, yet complains about it every other sentence.  Thankfully they are reunited, so we don't have to put up with the whining for long.  There is actual plot in this book, and a few interesting twists with her father and the group of vampires trying to kill her.  Decent read overall, but in the group of books I've read lately it doesn't stand out as one of the best.  The characters are just barely likable for me to continue reading the series, I really enjoyed the secondary characters introduced in this book.  If you liked the first book in this series you will definitely like this one.
0446605409|4.0|Detective John Corey, recovering from serious gunshot wounds, is staying at his uncle's home on Long Island's North Fork when he is asked by the local police chief to help out on a double murder investigation.  The murdered couple, Tom and Judy Gordon, had been working at Plum Island, a super-secret government research facility, just off the coast, which had been investigating viruses that might be used in germ warfare.  The theory that the couple might have stolen a particularly powerful virus to sell to a terrorist nation quickly leads to a competing theory that the couple might have been involved in selling drugs, and the local murder investigation soon crosses jurisdictional boundaries and draws county, state, and federal investigators.<br /><br />Demille creates a rip-roaring narrative that fully involves the recovering detective in the investigation, even after he is officially fired.  The Gordons had been members of the local historical society, which promotes legends about Captain Kidd, along with the theory that Kidd had hidden his treasure on Plum Island, perhaps near the island's unexplored archaeological ruins.  It is only a short leap to yet another theory about the Gordons--that their deaths may be related to the Captain Kidd legend.<br /><br />With two love stories, trips to a top secret laboratory, several more murders, a hidden cave, stories of pirate treasure, and even a hurricane, there are plot twists galore, and though the characters are not fully developed, they are interesting enough to keep the reader involved.  Corey is not \\"Mr.  Clean,\\" but while his reliance on violence and his (somewhat dated) male chauvinism make him a somewhat cynical lead character, he is determined to find the Gordons' killers, and the reader roots for his success.  Great escape reading.  n  Mary Whipple<br /><br />[[ASIN:0446679097 The Lion's Game]]<br />[[ASIN:0446177938 Up Country]]<br />[[ASIN:044617792X Night Fall]]<br />[[ASIN:B000WO0SQA Wild Fire]]<br />[[ASIN:0446673218 The Gold Coast]]<br />[[ASIN:0446533424 The Gate House]]6533424 The Gate House]]
B0014I4KIK|5.0|I had never heard of Duffy before going to see Coldplay in Philadelphia this past weekend. She opened for them, and while I am absolutely in love with Coldplay, I have to agree with Chris Martin in saying there may come a time when they open for her. Not only is her album amazing, but she's an amazing live performer, which now-a-days is hard to come by. As for her comparisons with Amy Winehouse- I personally think Duffy blows Amy out of the water.
B001C48EFQ|2.0|The movie is a waste of your time. There is one nice moment in the bathroom between Vin Diesel and the young girl. It was also well reacted to when interrupted. The drone chase seemed ok but beating it and shooting it down was ridiculous. A much older looking Michelle Yeoh makes a poor comeback. The night scene of New York pales when compared to what we saw decades ago in BladeRunner. If not for the heavily modulated voice Vin Diesel would have only been much less macho-er. The action is only mediocre. Ditch this movie by all means.
1416575464|4.0|I don't consider most of the designs in this book to be my style.  Yet the book is full of good ideas, which can be used by everyone.  By taking a piece that you love, i.e. chair, lamp, table, vase & working around that piece (using color, style or mixing & matching, you can come up with an entirely new room.    Domino goes through this theme room by room.  Domino is easy to read & has good diagrams.
B00004VVND|5.0|Filmed by the late Michael Critchton and a stone-faced performance by Yul Brynner as the unstoppable gunslinger, WESTWORLD is, though somewhat dated, a real wild ride.  James Brolin and Richard Benjamin go to an ultra-high tech amusement park for a vacation -- it consists of Roman World, Medeviel World and West World.  Each is inhabited by robots who are dead ringers for human and to provide thrilling entertainment with no harm to the guests.  Brolin and Benjamin go to Westworld to live out their fantasy in the old west and that's when things go nuts.  No extras and not the best transfer but still a must for any scifi dvd collection.
B000001Y5J|3.0|The only reason I chose not to rate this any higher is simply because Reznor has come out with albums at least two stars better than this -namely The Downward Spiral and The Fragile. Standing next to these albums this EP can only earnestly reach as far as three, maybe four, stars. At no point is Broken disappointing but also at no point is it as majestic as the forementioned albums. Definitely a strong footnote in the scheme of all things Nine Inch Nails. However I personally overlook Broken when I think about or want to listen to a good Nine Inch Nails record. The reason being I find myself only listening to the best of what particular bands produce and there's so much great music out there. But if you have a profound appreciation for NIN then pick this up; it's certainly a tenacious escort to their fame.
B001GKJ2DO|1.0|Ok, so I love Abba and Meryl Streep--she's one of my favorite actresses.  I also loved Mamma Mia on Broadway the three times I saw it there--but this movie was awful!  Yes, everyone acted very well, but it did not translate well to the big screen in this adaptation.  The minute the movie started I could tell it was going to be a mess, with the cast in that \\"Look at us--we're in a musical!\\" mode. The lighting was so terrible, when scenes transitioned I kept thinking they were going to be dream sequences with the overly bright halo effect lighting that was scattered throughout the film.  Poor Meryl Streep didn't even escape unscathed as the movie was so embarrassing to watch.  I would have walked out if I had been alone, but my partner, who is not a very discerning movie viewer, kept thinking it would get better.  He has rarely ever said that he did not like a movie we've been to, but even he said he hated it afterwards.  Don't think it was because we're not 50-something women either--we usually love chick flicks!
B001GM28HO|5.0|This could be one of the freshest music outings of this year. I've never heard anything as hot as Lady Gaga's music! She perfectly blends her own soupy mix of pop, disco, electronica and then some, to this really one delightful dancey record. I salute you...the new Lady of Dance!!!
B001ED7C58|2.0|I was counting down the hours until this cd came out, I absolutely couldn't wait.  The first song I put on when I got it was \\"Bella's Lullaby\\" and I was immediately disappointed.  This sounds like a movie score- background music that conveys the mood of the plot.  This is NOT the right song for what Edward wrote for Bella and played for her.  It is far too over produced and isn't even a very pretty song in my opinion.    I am somewhat of a Paramore fan, but the two Paramore songs are less than fabulous.  I know they can do better.  These songs sound like something a brand new high school garage band would write, not a band that has been around as long as Paramore.      Most of the other songs on the cd (Mutemath, Collective Soul, Perry Farrell) all sounded like the same garbled electronic garbage to me.  There is no quality singing or quality musicianship.  I won't even comment on Linkin Park, I can't stand any of their music.    The song by Muse is at least decent.  Its definately not one of Muse's best songs, but it is better than the rest of the cd.  The best song on the cd BY FAR is Iron and Wine's \\"Flightless Bird, American Mouth.\\"  However it seems very out of place as it is so different from all of the other songs.      I love Twilight just as much as everyone else, if not more, but just because I love the book does not mean I am going to eat up whatever garbage they throw at me on the soundtrack.  In terms of musical quality, I think they could have done much better.  I hope the movie isn't as disappointing.

0425200450|4.0|Agatha Christie is one of, if not the, most prolific mystery authors to date.  With a handful of captivating protagonists, ingenious plot devices, and unusual settings and cases, she managed to single-handedly establish the core of the mystery genre.  And this book that I am about to review is one of her most famous works.<br /><br />When Hercule Poirot boards the Orient Express he has no idea that he is about to descend into one of the most baffling cases of his career.  After he makes eye-contact with a passenger by the name of Ratchett, he knows immediately that this man is no good, possibly even downright evil.  With his sentiments echoed by everyone on board, it is not so much a surprise when Ratchett comes to him with an interesting proposition.  He is being targeted for death by a private enemy and would like to enlist the detective's help in the detection of the culprit.  M. Poirot refuses the case and thinks no more of it until the unfortunate Mr. Ratchett is found murdered.  But as the case progresses, it comes to light that the circumstances are not so unfortunate as \\"Ratchett\\" was most certainly the despicable man everyone thought him.  Armed with the knowledge that the murderer must still be on the train and the certainty that all the passengers are more than happy to see Ratchett dead, Hercule Poirot must sift through a handful of clues to track down a murderer.<br /><br />I myself love the work of Agatha Christie, although some might find her stories a bit dated and outlandish.  Sometimes the leaps of logic are a bit hard to follow, but that's what makes Detective Poirot such a formidable crime-solver.  And the ending is superb.  A must read for anyone who wants to acquaint themselves with classic mystery!

B000059MEK|5.0|Daft Punk's Discovery was released in 2001, and serves as the foundation for the Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem anime film.  While Discovery was recorded before the animation was ever worked on, this can still be considered a soundtrack for Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem.  All fourteen tracks on the album are used in the anime, and the songs appear in the exact same order on both the CD and in the anime.<br /><br />When I listen to Discovery, I can't help but see the images from the anime as I'm listening to it.  In some cases, having the visuals in your mind (or seeing them in the anime) can help you better appreciate a song on the CD.  This is especially true for the final song, \\"Too Long.\\"  Not only does it clock in at ten minutes, but the last half of the song is rather repetitive.  This is a case where having the visuals of the anime help a listener to make it through the song and have a greater appreciation for it.<br /><br />However, many of the songs on the CD are just as enjoyable with or without the anime visuals.  The singles \\"One More Time,\\" \\"Digital Love,\\" and \\"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\\" fall into this category.  I also have an appreciation for \\"Aerodynamic,\\" \\"Crescendolls,\\" \\"Superheroes,\\" \\"High Life,\\" \\"Something About Us,\\" \\"Short Circuit,\\" and \\"Face to Face,\\" regardless of whether or not I have the visuals to accompany them.<br /><br />Overall, Discovery is a well-produced and solid album.  I already had an appreciation for Daft Punk and the songs I had heard from the Discovery album before seeing Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem.  However, after seeing the anime, my appreciation for Daft Punk and the music on Discovery was greater than before I had seen the anime.
1591391105|4.0|Michael Watkins' \\"The First 90 Days\\" is ostensibly about improving a transition into a new leadership role and accelerating the typical 6.2 month break-even point of giving more value to the organization than received. Each chapter focuses on one of ten key transition strategies.     \\"Promote Yourself\\" and \\"Secure Early Wins\\" are all about the short-term but important goal of quickly establishing credibility. In \\"Accelerate Your Learning\\", Watkins goes about convincing us there are special, institutional and culture things we need to learn.    In \\"Match Strategy to Situation\\", the author expounds on an earlier proposition that failure is never just about the flaws of a new leader, but rather the adaptability of that leader's skills to the particular business situation. Watkins introduces the STaRS business lifecycle model which will be a continuing reference point throughout the rest of the book. The STaRS concept is really very simple - match strategy, actions, reactions, etc. to the business situation of the company and department. That situation will determine the degrees to which a leader dials various levers of control. While it is a simple concept, many often miss it, and enter into new roles with preconceived notions and habits from their previous role(s).    The \\"Negotiate Success\\" chapter is about managing your boss. There is very good advice here, beginning with taking 100% responsibility for the relationship. All of the insight here is applicable post-transition for an ongoing, successful relationship with your superior.    \\"Achieve Alignment\\" discusses balancing strategy, structure, systems, skills and culture. \\"Build Your Team\\" offers wisdom on the right moves to make upon inheriting the new team, but much of the advice will be invaluable for managing them for the duration. The chapter contains a model for a decision making strategy within the team, noting different types of decisions call for different styles.    \\"Create Coalitions\\" counsels the manager to reach out beyond their reporting chain and build relationship capital before they need it. Every organization has its shadow structure of informal networks of influence and power. There is also good analysis on choice shaping, entanglement strategies and building momentum.    \\"Keep Your Balance\\" offers some final advice about balancing all the previous strategies and maintaining self-discipline both in your professional and personal life. Watkins then spends the last chapter or two advocating industry and organizational attention to the transition phase of leadership, but the value for the reader/manager is to consider how their new direct reports will manage their transition.    Most of the chapters contain a \\"common traps\\" section which I found really effective for identifying where I personally had wandered off the path of best practices. Sometimes defining what you should not do is more enlightening than the original advice of what you should do. Each chapter ends with an \\"acceleration checklist\\", which I first thought were summary questions typical of text books, but upon actually reading found they stimulate further thought. Most chapters also begin with a short case study, which while valuable for an introduction, could have been expounded upon and used more effectively.    Watkins' says this goal of the 90 day transition is to \\"build momentum by creating virtuous cycles that build credibility and avoiding getting caught in vicious cycles that damage credibility.\\" But the advice and strategies put forth in his book go far beyond the initial entry into the role and are applicable to general, ongoing management and leadership. The main flaw of \\"The First 90 Days\\" is its dry, academic presentation. It's hard to get through and easy to get impatient and skim past some really good insight. Watkins may be a career professor, and may write like one as well, but his insight does reflect command over cultural and political nuances of leadership that one usually only discovers by living through it over a career.

B000002UB3|4.0|Love most of the album then and now. Didn't really understand, though, how much coulda been used elsewhere (like the \\"White Album\\"), and how much - not alot - came from other places: Come Together with its' Chuck Berry reference really driving the whole thing; Something, impossible without James Taylor's classic; Oh Darling, yet another Little Richard tribute while Richard was without a recording contract.<br />Some other curiosities: Mean Mr. Mustard & Maxwell's Silver Hammer (c'mon Paul!); I Want You (She's So Heavy) - a nice soundtrack for a bad Buster Crabbe pirate movie.<br />Which leaves up with the gems: above mentioned classic A and B side; Here Comes The Sun, You Never Give Me Your Money, Because.<br />And just like the double-album, we're left with not enough Harrison, too much PM Music Hall cuteness (as memorable as it surely is) and that curious...\\"End\\".<br />(Is Eric Clapton playing lead on \\"Something\\"?).
B001JRYH2K|5.0|It's about time that this movie is being released. I just hope that it includes director commentary and extra features after all these years. Also, did Amazon forget that the star and director of the movie is Barbra Streisand?? Her name is not even mentioned in the description!
B000000XBC|2.0|I scanned all the reviews here on Amazon before buying Chronicle Vol 2. I'd been inspired by hearing \\"Walk on Water\\" many times on Amazon and decided to buy the collection instead of CCR's eponymous first album.  That was a mistake.<br />This collection clearly appeals to committed fans, as is true for nearly all reviews I see on Amazon.  I found it mediocre, at best.  \\"Walk on Water\\" has passion, a wide vocal range and nice changes of pace.  The rest of this 2 CD set is forgettable.<br /><br />Feel free to mark this review as \\"not useful\\" -- I do it often myself when reviews are not informative.  Sorry if this review offends your sensibilities but it's not a vote on whether CCR was a great band: it was, and John Fogerty's put out some good stuff since.<br /><br />For the casual fan, get the original Chronicle (Vol 1) and enjoy.
0802714544|5.0|John Le Carre can put into a 223 page book what some authors today need 600 pages to tell.  He is not just a master with the dialogue, but with the mood, setting and gives you a complete rundown of the politics in that small number of pages.  There is no need for me to give you a rundown of the storyline; many have done that before me.  What I'm here to say is that even after 45 years, this book is still relevant and although some might say it is dated, it gives us an accurate appraisal of the 1960's in Europe - something our current history books can't do.<br /><br />Loving a good spy novel, I began to read Le Carre, starting with \\"Our Game\\" because I bought it at a library book sale.  It was just okay at best - very rambling and with no real focus, it seemed.  What was I missing?  So I read \\"Single and Single\\" because I bought it at a church book sale.  It was really bad.  This just seemed like drivel from an author that had no idea where the story was going.  But I knew that Le Carre was the primo spy writer, but nothing I was reading was showing me any of it.  So I didn't panic, but instead read all of the reviews on Le Carre's other books.  Then I started at the beginning of his success with \\"The Spy Who...\\"  Wow!!  Now this is a master spy writer at his best.  The characters were intense and their sweat came through to the reader and I was sweating with them.  The Cold War seems so long ago, but this book brought it back to me like I was again living it.  The historic information of this type of book is long forgotten and our younger, Nintendo/ PlayStation playing, non-readers should pick up this book and see what they may have missed the first time around, but might not during what may be coming next in the world as Russia is making its comeback.<br /><br />I will now go back and read the two earlier works and then progress through the best of the rest.  If anyone has started reading Le Carre during the last several books, like me, it would be well worth their time to start here and then begin the series when the master storyteller was in his heyday.t here and then begin the series when the master storyteller was in his heyday.

0743297334|3.0|[[ASIN:1432708155 The Margin]]<br />The Sun Also Rises by Hemingway the second time around was a disappointment. The first reading, many years ago, was a disappointment too but I chalked that opinion up to immaturity on my part. What do I chalk it up to now? I don't know. Anyway, I have to say I'm not the least bit impressed. I'm going to press on though, hoping to grasp why the New York Times said, \\"...a truly gripping story, told in lean, hard athletic prose...magnificent.\\" I went to the local library today and checked out The Old Man and the Sea.<br /><br />Marvin Wiebener, author of The Margin, a mystery novel of lost treasure with interesting characters and an unlikely outcome. You won't be disappointed.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|This was an incredible movie. I've seen it 5 times and will watch it many more. Definately worth paying just under $24 for a Bluray copy. If you have a 40 inch or better tv with surround sound you will love it even more. 6 outta 5 stars.
B001DU8T6S|3.0|This album was really a lot better than I thought it would be.  Now, it doesn't compare with Queen's better stuff, but if you're a Queen fan, you might find yourself liking this one.  Here is a track by track:    Cosmos Rockin'- The lyrics to this song were apparently written by a 12-year-old. What a concept! First, we've got the whole house rockin'! Then the whole town, the whole world, and finally, the whole Cosmos! Sweet! Yes, definitely written by a 12-year-old. Or maybe Roger Taylor. Yeah, probably Roger Taylor. This song also loses points for using the phrase \\"The mighty power of Rock 'n' Roll\\" several times.      Time to Shine- This song isn't awful. It's one of those \\"Hey, humanity, pull your heads out!\\" songs. All in all, it's one of those that you write as you are falling asleep, and you think it's great. But the next morning you wake up and go, \\"Eh, this isn't that good.\\" Unfortunately, Queen + Paul Rodgers never had that realization.    Still Burnin'- This one sounds like something from a Brian May solo album. The lyrics are kind of, well, meh. It was some Queen-like harmonies, but still falls short of Queen. The inclusion of the We Will Rock You stomps and claps feels like a forced attempt at nostalgia.    Small- This is the best track so far. It has some good acoustic guitar throughout the song, and has a great electric solo. It also has some nice harmonies. This is actually quite a Queen-ish song.    Warboys- Ugh. The twelve-year-old lyricist returns. The marching beat fits the theme, but the whole song feels quite juvenile.    We Believe- This song may, in fact, be the one to turn me into a believer. This is a great song. One can imagine that this is just what Queen would be doing today if Freddie were still alive. The guitar solo has some cool layering from Brian, something he went away from in the '80s. It's nice to hear. It also has some very Queen-like harmonies. This song would almost fit on the Made in Heaven album. At the high point in the song, I nearly had tears in my eyes as everything came together, and I felt as though Queen had been reborn.    Call Me- Wowee! This is my favorite song on this album so far! This has some GREAT harmonies. It's a nice little, upbeat song. It's quite simple, really. The guitar solo has some of the best layering we've heard from Brian in the last 30 years. This, like \\"We Believe,\\" is what you have to think Queen would be doing today were Freddie still around. If you only check out one song on this album, let this be it. (If you check out two, make \\"We Believe\\" the other. Or \\"Small.\\" They're both good.)    Voodoo- This is a bluesy song, and it has a really nice chorus. It is very un-Queen-like. It has some good guitar work, and is a good song.    Some Things That Glitter- I've read that this song was around as early as 1986. To me, that begs the question, \\"Why didn't this song make the cut for A Kind of Magic, The Miracle, Innuendo, or Made in Heaven?\\" However, it isn't too bad of a song. It has a good piano part, and is fairly Queen-like. It has some nice layered guitar. It might pass better as a Brian solo song.    C-Lebrity- This song has grown on me since first hearing it. It's a nice little rocker. It has a catchy chorus, but it's not very Queen-like. Parts of it sound like it might belong on the Innuendo album.    Through the Night- This is a dark piano song. It's really not too bad. It also isn't a Queen song. It has a nice guitar solo, but might belong on a Brian solo album more.    Say It's Not True- This is another song that has grown on me. It has some cheesy lyrics, and is almost more of a Roger solo song. But then Brian comes in with some nice vocals and excellent guitar and turns this into a Queen song. I really wish Brian had had more vocals on the album. His voice is actually very similar to Paul's, which makes me wonder why they needed Paul. Anyway, again, there are some nice layered guitars here, and it might fit in well with songs from Innuendo.    Surf's Up...School's Out- Ugh. Okay, wait. This song has a very cool intro that is typical of later Queen. However, the main song is very cheesy. The 12-year-old returns again! It is decidedly un-Queen. And it seems to ramble. The ending is excellent, though. It has a great transition into a reprise of \\"Small,\\" and that is a great way to finish the album.    Final thoughts:  This album has been overly ragged-on. It really isn't too bad. Yes, it has some cheese. Yes, it has some childishness. But it also has some great moments. It also has some of Brian's best guitar in a long time. I wouldn't recommend it to everyone, but you might give it a try.
B0018AK9RA|3.0|I'll keep it short:    The music is well done and very professional (mixed well), however unless you like rock opera-ish show music or the Trans-Siberian Orchestra, this may not be for you. (Lizzy Borden did it better years ago with Master of Diguise).     It is good for what it is thus the 3 stars, but not what I expected or really would have wanted. I can't fault them for trying new things. The lyrics do leave a lot to be desired, too. This one is actually better when Rob isn't singing, which is unfortunate.
0446605409|3.0|[[ASIN:1432708155 The Margin]]<br />Plum Island is my first DeMille novel. The story is good, but much too much detail. Educational, yes, but tedius at times. I even went to sleep reading through the description of the facility. On the other hand, Conley is my kind of character--sarcastic and rude (when appropriate). I enjoyed his quips.<br />I do prefer a faster pace, but otherwise would recommend this novel.<br /><br />Marvin Wiebener, author of The Margin. A sophisticated mystery with unpredictable twists.
B001ED7C58|3.0|I couldn't wait to recieve my copy I had pre-ordered.  I had heard a few of the songs on the MANY fan sites and liked the music for the most part.  Mostly I was wanting to be overcome by \\"Bella's Lullaby\\" and I was not.  It had a lot to live up to and fell very short, for me anyway.  The CD as a whole has some great tunes on it but does not make me think of the book at all.  My favorite song? Supermassive Black Hole by Muse...the first song on the album.
B00005M91K|5.0|The psychologically-challenging 1992 film Baraka is richly filled with complexity, gorgeous scenery, and moments that compel you to contemplate. It is opulent in its scope and so alternately awe-inspiring and beautiful that it wields all the greater force to disturb and assault the emotions at those times it chooses to. Certainly I have never seen anything like it.<br /><br />As its dozens of un-narrated scenes segue without preamble one onto the next, one second showing the natural grandeur of planet earth in all its manifold greatness, the subsequent letting its human cast beckon you into a fleeting instant in their collective but separate lives, I couldn't help but feel my brain launch into some very profound thoughts, and that's the strength of this motion picture.<br /><br />Along the journey thru Baraka's fast-paced run-time, there are depictions of post-modern city scapes filled with traffic, and villages  that have surely stood unchanged through ensuing millennia. A red rock cliff-faced unaltered through eons might precede a shot of a tree falling to earth, its ephemerally suddenly all the more significant in comparison. There are scenes of prayer at the Wailing Wall, and in Mecca, and in Asian temples, and then there are shots of commerce, computer age manufacturing, the industrial processing of animals whose entire existence is spent in development as a source of human food.<br /><br />Barack is not only a study in contrasts, it is an exercise in mind-expansion, a near-Sisyphisian effort that coaxes anyone who watches it to reach out and at least seek to grasp the immensity of the planet that surrounds us. It is not unlike the Zen meditation technique wherein instead of shutting out the universe, one is directed to open one's eyes and take in all that is around you, great, small, unseen. That is this film's function.<br /><br />Also, as I watched south Asian beggars pick through massive heaps of refuse, I couldn't help but notice the clothes they wore were, well, downright beautiful, which left me with Baraka's most profound gift of wisdom: if starving people can wear nice clothing and look good, there's really no excuse for those of us in the developed world not to look our best, now, is there?<br /><br />Yes, this is a profound motion picture, indeed!which left me with Baraka's most profound gift of wisdom: if starving people can wear nice clothing and look good, there's really no excuse for those of us in the developed world not to look our best, now, is there?    Yes, this is a profound motion picture, indeed!
B001E75QGG|2.0|As a big fan of the Indiana Jones movies, I was excited to see this one, but it disappointed greatly.  In fact, it does not even seem like a Steven Spielberg movie at all.  Not exciting, and none of the non-stop action of earlier movies.  Moreover, the characters were not engaging, with the possible exception of Shia LaBoeuf, who was as engaging as possible for the part he had.  The talented Cate Blanchett should have said no to the ridiculous part they gave her, which was reminiscent of Boris and Natasha from Rocky & Bullwinkle.  I didn't care about Karen Allen's character, and Indy just looked tired.  The plot was drivel.  Aliens?  Puh-lease!  The only thing that earned this movie two stars was the gorgeous visual impact.  The costumes and sets were lush and authentic-looking for their era.  It was a beautiful visual treat.  Aside from that, I really didn't care for or about this movie at all.  I wouldn't recommend it.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|Exciting, edge-of-seat action, PLUS a chance to explore with Indy again.  My family truly enjoyed the film, and hope that this same group will do an Indy 5.  This film has All new adventures, some old characters and some new!  And a little bit of mangled history.  Five thumbs up!
1840327871|1.0|It's cut down way too much.  It might do for someone who wants a \\"cliffs notes\\" version of Mansfield Park, but no real Austen fan will enjoy it.
B000002JSJ|5.0|This is a truly amazing album! Passionately played, Presence rocks from start to finish and it means it. From the opening guitar that fades in into the beast that is Achilles Last Stand to the marvellous melancholy of Tea For One, this is a complete winner. Actually those two songs plus For Your Life and Nobody's Fault But Mine are just fantastic pieces of music. The album manages to capture a rawness that was absent on their previous albums save say for the very first one when they just went for it and had the whole thing done in two weeks. It also does carry a hard funky feel that only those four mighty musicians could throw - the perfect follow-up to Physical Graffiti. I regard Led Zeppelin's music as a sort of holy presence and it was very much alive when they went to Munich's Musicland Studios in Nov/Dec 1975 to record the album that came to be known as PRESENCE.
0471463396|4.0|This book is an overview of different approaches to value investing. The last half of the book has profiles of different value investors which I found to be an interesting read. The first half briefly describes how to value assets and earning power of a company and while there are some quite instructive points here as well I do have some problems with the writing style which often takes the form of rants and assumes alot from the reader.    So I would only recommend this book to someone already familiar with the topic of value investing and how it is practiced. For a beginner I would instead recommend the book: Getting Started in Value Investing, by Charles Mizrahi. For the next level I would recommend: Analysis For Financial Management, by Robert Higgins. Both of these books are much better at explaining the fundamental principles of value investing for novices.

B0007PAMR4|5.0|I've previously owned the Lynch version on DVD and the epic, three hour TV version that was shown on the Sci-Fi channel on a worn-out VHS tape.  When this new extended edition dvd was released I jumped at the chance to get it.  The extended version gives you much more detail and insight into the characters than the Lynch cut.  While I find that the Lynch cut is enjoyable in it's own right I prefer the completeness of the extended edition.  The shorter version just seems too rushed with too many gaps.
B001CC7PKS|3.0|This film didn't have much of a chance when it came out.  Fans of the comic were disdainful of the casting choices, Ben Affleck was in a paparazzi mess with J-Lo, the theatrical cut was hacked up to appeal to a younger audience..<br /><br />and yet, 5 years later, the director's cut is out on BluRay, and does not include the original theatrical version, a silent admission that Mark Steven Johnson's vision was the better of the two.<br /><br />'Daredevil' is an unusual superhero movie.  It is a truer film-noir than most. The essential aspect of film noir not being just a dark visual palette, but a main character becoming more tightly ensnared in a web of tragedy that he can't escape from.  Matt Murdock loses his sight, his father, his love, and as the violence escalates, finds little but faith to console him, and asks if it's enough. In the opening shot, he is bleeding, clinging to the concrete cross of the catholic church, and the film backtracks from his origin to his character's 'Dark night of the soul'.<br /><br />This reviewer found the vulnerability of the character, the fact that he's not 'super' much more interesting from an acting standpoint. Ben Affleck did get alot of bruises doing the stunts in the film and his performance has a true humility in certain scenes that hasn't been seen from him before or since.<br /><br />It's not perfect, though.  There are many scenes that are meant to lighten the mood that seem sophomoric, Colin Farrel as Bullseye comes off as a psychotic irish clown rather than the smug, gritty villain he was on the page, Elektra gets nearly no backstory here that would add depth to her(though Jennifer Garner is certainly no slouch on the athletics). The restored plotline of the murder of prostitute Lisa Tazio makes the final fight between Daredevil and Kingpin alot more meaningful, but it lacks oomph... the film is trying to sell you the idea that by looking out for the little guy, you can beat the big guys.. and the origin scene punches this theme.. as does the finale.. it just stumbles a little with it in between.<br /><br />Blame Marvel for the issues, though. You can glimpse brilliance all throughout this picture, if only they had let the director do his job without burying the whole thing in marketing.<br /><br />As for the transfer, this film has never looked or sounded better, the night scenes are perfectly lit, very sharp, and the sound design, particularly in the 'radar sense' sequences is stunning in 5.1.<br /><br />Like the comic book character himself, this film is flawed, yet has hidden excellence(I privately add one star).le.. it just stumbles a little with it in between.

B00005N6KG|5.0|I've had 4 pairs of these headphones. I love the fit, sound and weight. When they fail, it's in the cord, usually near the plug. Nevertheless their lifespan is long, and I think their value is twice the price.
B001BPJJ82|5.0|We thought this was the greatest movie we EVER saw, but perhaps not everyone will. Several stories are woven together. As in life some of these stories (lives) were not so significant to others. People are seldom who they seem; places and things are often shown different than they are told because of the abyss of understanding and experience between the two main characters. Some were dissociated from the main stories. It covered human love and deciiet, lies and sacrifices. Stupidity, misunderstanding and wisdom. Viciousness and love struggling. The acting was relaxed. Almost muted. Wardrobe did a fine job and the scenery included almost every beautiful spot on earth. I do no think one can catch everything in one viewing. On the other hand if you disliked it, just leave it alone.
0060589280|1.0|Actually, I should be changing the title of my review - I am a bookworm, and I have read tons of great books. To call this the \\"worst book I ever read\\" implies it can be compared to those other books. But one shouldn't even \\"compare\\" it to other books... it is a badly written Mills and Boons type of romance trying to be \\"profound\\" at the same time. The characters are stick figures, the setting contrived, plot nonexistent, and dialog - the pits. There are no emotions whatsoever. \\"Sacred sex\\" comes up in the book - \\"plastic sex\\" would describe it better.  The author wanted to be \\"honest\\" (that's what he writes in his acknowledgment) and that makes the book sound so much more false than it already is. Can the author really write about the experiences of a prostitute honestly?   Most of the time, it sounds like a terrible self-help book, with words like 'choice', 'challenge' liberally thrown in.   What a waste of time reading this book (could only manage half of it, just to see how bad a book can get). Alchemist was ok, I didn't go gaga over it, but this is soooo bad, it is unbelievable. Don't bother reading it! I would have given it a negative rating if Amazon had that option.
B000O599ZS|5.0|Controversy has swirled around this western ever since its release in 1956. Chief among the criticisms leveled at it is John Wayne's Ethan Edwards' \\"racist\\" hatred of the Comanches, manifested from the first minute he sees his brother's stepson, who is one-eighth Indian. In this day and age, when anything that smacks of \\"racism\\" is deemed to lower a work of art's rating, Edwards' freely voiced antipathy to the Indians is considered by many to be more than sufficient to demote this film from \\"Best Western of all time,\\" which some have called it.<br /><br />  I don't feel that way about \\"The Searchers.\\" Ethan Edwards was a product of his time and society, and thus would not have stuck out as particularly \\"different\\" among Southern and Western men of that day. After all, it is made clear that he fought for the Confederacy in the Civil War.<br /><br />  The only flaw I find in the depiction of Edwards' racial views is that the movie never makes quite clear why he hates the Indians to such an extreme degree. None of the other settlers appear to share his smoldering abhorrence of the Comanche. I have read a review which says that one can catch a fleeting glimpse of a tombstone in the scene in the cemetery; the epitaph states that a woman with the last name \\"Edwards\\" was killed by the Comanche years earlier. Could this have been Ethan's mother? His wife? No clue is ever given.<br /><br />  All that having been said, the film is, I think, probably the greatest western ever made, partly because of the intense character study it does of Ethan Edwards. It does not condemn him as a \\"racist,\\" or as anything else. It merely shows him to us; the decision is ours to make. And I disagree with some reviewers who believe that Edwards seems to see the \\"error of his ways\\" in the final scenes. He sees no such thing. Look at his face in the more intense scenes leading up to the attack on the camp of Scar, the Comanche leader whose braves kidnapped the two girls, and you can see both rageand hatred etched in that face. Then look at his face again, in the brief shot just after he has exited Scar's tent, the dead Indian's scalp in his hand, and you'll see the hatred and anger gone; it has been purged by Scar's execution. When he approaches his niece, kidnapped five years before by the Indians and presumably having been \\"sleeping with a buck\\" -- Edwards' reason for wanting earlier to kill her -- one can tell by his manner that he now comes only to carry her home safely.<br /><br />  Perhaps it's the mark of a great movie when people can disagree, often strongly, about its characters and meanings. \\"The Searchers\\" is one of those great movies.
B0002KQNJU|4.0|This an older vampire movie, starring Sharon Tate, which incorporates wonderful scenery with old castles surrounded by snow capped mountains.  Unlike the blood and gore horror films of today, this movie offers comic releif, from the gay vampire to the Jewish vampire who laughs when presented with a cross.  From the small village to the stone castle, this movie is a visual delight.
B000MNP2KI|3.0|I finally watched this movie since the 2nd Daniel Craig 007 will be coming out soon and i want to be prepared. I'm a long-time 007 fan, but was disappointed with the crazy, jumbled storyline in this one...Bond films need a clear and strong story to balance out the excessive chase scenes and the long list of characters who have no point in the story at all.  There was nothing to intrigue me about what the characters (both good guys & bad guys) were up to.  Too much of the film was just laughable; how could 007 break into M's house, much less survive that unbelievable opening chase scene which was pointless and soooo tedious that I had to start folding my laundry just to kill time. The ending was beyond absurd - AS IF M would only find out about Vesper's background in the last 5 minutes of the film! Please, don't insult me. However, Daniel Craig does save the film (considering the script he had) with his strong onscreen presence; perfect timing; and a new vulnerability that the other 007's never had.  Hopefully, a new and more intelligent screenwriter was brought in for the next episode.
B0016Q2D5M|3.0|About once every decade or so the motion picture industry decides to revisit 3-D technology, and one of the properties chosen for this occasion was Jules Verne's classic JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH.  Originally published in 1864, the story has been through more screen and television adaptations than you can shake a stick at--most famously in a 1959 big screen adaptation starring James Mason.  The current version, however, is not a literal adaptation of the novel; it is instead a modern riff that finds scientest Trevor Anderson (Brandon Fraser) using his late brother's notes on the Jules Verne novel in an effort to revive interest in his own dying university program.<br /><br />With smart-alec nephew Sean (Josh Hutcherson) and hiking guide Hannah (Anita Briem) in tow, Trevor stumbles into a cave that leads to an old mine that unexpectedly drops them to the center of the earth, where they find Verne was right all along.  Along the way they encounter a wild mine cart ride, a man-eating plant, a T-Rex, and lots of other bits of business designed to show off the 3-D effects.<br /><br />3-D is really a big screen format, and when to bring it to the small screen the result is only so-so.  The glasses are as annoying as ever, especially if you wear glasses yourself; be that as it may, it works fairly well as long you keep the room completely dark and sit directly in front of the television.  You may have to move further back or closer to the screen for best viewing.  This aside, JOURNEY is a flyweight thing, well-designed, reasonably well-acted, but with a trivial script and story that exist only to provide an excuse for the 3-D effects.  Recommended if you want check out what 3-D is like these days, but never mind the rest.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer
B001CIPU3G|5.0|This is the best Trivium album to date, because it's their heaviest. See, a lot of sucky metal bands tend to go into a song nice and strong and then totally screw it up by going very soft and slow at what's suppose to be the 'climax' of their songs. Now what I like about Trivium is that at the climax of the songs, they will use softer vocals, but they usually keep the rhythm nice and fast. The only down side of Trivium is that their heavy vocals aren't very coherent, but there is no perfect band :/
B0002XL35G|3.0|Texas is a desolate state where Paris is the town with an active, bustling train full of freight cars.  Somewhat like the Norfolk Southern but smaller and not quite so loud.  It is like the Mohave desert in places.  Houston was a metropolis in comparison, where Rodney Crowell grew up.  Maybe I was mistaken, but this is the place where Lettie visited Carl during the war years and she was rewarded with a pair of little grannie glasses.     Travis went there and got lost, ended up buying some land close to the Red River.  He was the typical male, taking no blame for anything and ran from responsibility.  These were two damaged souls revived by a child.  Afraid of what I might find, it was easier when I just imagined him.  Mark is real, but not in Texas.
0930289455|2.0|...however I did find it very hard to enjoy. I really like Brian Bolland's artwork and I like that Alan Moore tried to take the Joker in a more psychological direction than was popular at the time. I even enjoyed the origin of the Joker himself which was a nice nod to Bob Kane's original origin story.<br /><br />My complaint with the comic is that it's VERY disturbing (at least for my taste) and doesn't have anything else interesting to say. I suppose watching The Joker try to drive Commissioner Gordon insane by putting him through \\"One Bad Day\\"(stripping him naked, putting him in a cage, taunting him with photos of his bloodied daughter Barbara) is fascinating in an unpleasant sort of way and the idea that Batman is just as insane as the Joker (but just deals with it in a different fashion) is an influential theme that's been carried by Batman writers since. But what can someone who's not vested in Batman and The Joker take away from this story?<br /><br />I know 'The Killing Joke' is liked by many Batman fans and again, is very influential on current Batman stories. Personally I didn't enjoy the book and by the end and the disturbia and brutality just felt pointless. As Alan Moore has said about 'The Killing Joke': \\"I thought was clumsy, misjudged and had no real human importance\\". I can't disagree.

I think a lot of fans thought Bella and Edward both needed to suffer more.. I am not for sure why.. I am just glad they can have their happy ever after.... I just hope she writes more about vampires... I know she says the Bella and Edward story is done, but there are more ppl in the last book she could write about.
B001ER4CNY|3.0|It's a great set. It will feature the TV movie I Dream of Jeannie 15 Years Later (1985). If you go to tvshowsondvd.com they list this set and the features. I emailed sony because I too think they should release one set with Black and White. I also told them that they should release the movie separately along with the second TV movie I Still Dream of Jeannie(1991). I think they should have put the movie on Season 5 as a bonus. This set is a slap in the face and a way to get money out of people. It doesn't benefit those of us who already own Seasons 1-3 or 1-4. The set is good for those who have no I Dream of Jeannie at all. And because it's still inprint, it wouldn't be worth it to try to sell it for a few bucks. I hope Sony takes my suggestion. I hate when companies pull these tricks to get money out of people.

0060254920|5.0|I purchased this book for my best friend who is having a boy come this December.  I did so because I remember so many good memories when my parents read it to me as a child that I wanted him to share those kinds of memories with his son. Despite other reviews of saying this book is \\"pointless\\" or \\"dark and scary\\", we the reader don't always need to put on our critical, psychoanalytical, or marxist lens and analyse the books we read our children.  Doesn't that take the magic out of books like this?  Moreover, this book is about fun monsters and the imaginary lands that children go to when they are asleep or playing in our back yards.  This book is a must for any child who is learning to or not quite yet ready to read.  Furthermore, the images in this book are stunning and should captivate young audiences.

B001ED7C58|2.0|While I will keep my review of the book to myself, I will openly announce that I was horribly disappointed in this soundtrack. I was expecting a different cadence that would allow readers to feel the story with our hearing just as we felt with it with our reading. The only bands I was pleased to see was Iron & Wine and Mutemath (which, while a good song, I thought had absolutely nothing to do with Twilight). Bella's Lullaby was nothing compared to the intricacy I imagined when I first read the book, and Rob Pattinson's song was lovely, but nonsensical to me. With so many mainstream bands on this OST, I have just been assured that I won't be a bit pleased with the movie.   But what can you do when everything Hollywood touches is obliterated?

I won't spoil the ending for you, but just don't expect it to be awesome.

B000RJO57I|5.0|Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are superb in this cracking little British comedy. Nick Angel (Pegg) is the London supercop who is so good he's making all his colleagues look fools, and so is shunted off to the 'sticks' and utter boredom - or so it seems. Danny (Frost) is his hapless partner and bane, short on experience but big in enthusiasm.<br /><br />Angel becomes suspicious as the accident mortality rate in the village begins to rise, only to be held back by the cluelessness of his colleagues and bizarreness of the locals.<br /><br />The support cast is allstar, if you're British, and must have been a director's dream. At times the film almost had a Wallace and Gromit feel to it, and you can tell it was made with with a lot of affection. Jim Broadbent must be fast approaching the 'national treasure' level, as Sgt. Frank Butterman, stalwart of the Police station and  village.<br /><br />Truly funny in places and very watchable on the whole, it builds to an over-the-top finale that gets away with it precisely because the characters are so likeable.

078322804X|5.0|It's the BEST Movie ever according to my brother! But I enjoyed it too a must buy!
B001ED7C58|2.0|So.. I was so excited to get the cd today.. but I am not very impressed. I thought it would be so much better. Bella's Lullaby is NOT what is should be. And the music just doesn't sound like what I thought in my head, while I was reading the saga.? lol. Some of the songs are okay.. I just thought it would be a lot better and I for sure thought, they would of made Bella's Lullaby just breath-taking :( -

B0010VD7EO|5.0|I don't understand the rating of this album. I agree with it, but I don't undertand it. So far it is a collective 4 star. I give it 5 stars. Nay I give it Amazon 5 stars. It is not a true 5-star in the sense that it is a flawless album that can be recognized for greatness by just about anyone. However, I can asure you that this is an Amazon 5-star, where fans love it so much that they over-review it and give it five stars. If any album is worthy of that, it is this one. Call it what you want, New Wave, Glam, Electro-Indie, this album is amazing. There are 4 songs (tracks 1,3,4,9) that absolutely blow me away and make me want to share them with everyone I know. Probably Electric Eel most of all. Of the other 6 songs, you will not find 1 bad song. All songs have somehting that hooks you in to some extent. Again, not all seconds of this album are heaven, but I have not heard a track that I want to skip. If you are a fan of this genre or at least open to this genre, do yourself a favor and buy yourself this album. You can thank me later. They're greeeeeeeaat!
B000002L3P|5.0|THE KENNY WAYNE SHEPHERD CD, \\" LEDBETTER HEIGHTS \\" IS A REMARKABLE CD. BUY THIS CD AND SEE THE KWS BAND IN PERSON AND YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!! I HAVE SEEN THEM LIVE 5 TIMES AND THEY ARE OUTSTANDING. I ALREADY OWN THIS CD AND BOUGHT IT FOR A FRIEND. THEY PLAYED MY HOME TOWN AND BLEW THE CROWD AWAY!!!! KENNY WAYNE SHEPHERD IS ONE OF THE GREATEST BLUES AND ROCK GUITARIST THAT YOU WILL SEE IN OUR LIFETIME!!!
B0013D8LOK|1.0|To my amazement, when the film was over, people in the movie theater stood up and said \\"I liked it.\\"  Meanwhile, I'm thinking, \\"Of course you liked it, it's one of the finest musicals ever written\\"  But I believe that the love people give this film is only due to Sondheim's genius source material which Burton did not add anything to.  Burton could only throw his wannabe Edward Gorey style at it, play up the blood, and tell the actors to perform the whole thing without subtext.  This musical is inherently FUNNY.  Hello?  Where was the humor?  This was Depp's least funny role in a musical that SHOULD be darkly HILARIOUS?  Explain that!!!  And for those people who think a tragedy can't be funny look at Hamlet - that show has tons of humor and is arguably the finest work in western drama.  Laughter adds dimension and makes the sad parts sadder.  An overabundance of blood does not make up for cutting out the brilliant irony and swelling emotional power of the musical.  If it was blood he wanted, Burton should have directed a re-make of Evil Dead.  Though he no doubt would have ruined that one too.<br /><br />Also more evidence of Burton's lack of respect for the musical is the fact that he cast ACTORS WHO CAN'T SING THEIR PARTS.  Helena Bonham-Carter was the worst offender and literally butchered one of the greatest female characters of all time.  Anything I felt for the characters was provoked by Sondheim's score.  The director and the actors brought nothing.  SHAME SHAME SHAME ON YOU TIM!
B0013ND30M|5.0|Sleeping Beauty is a landmark film in Disney history. Beyond its bold, distinctive look, which has already received due praise and discussion, it came along when Walt Disney Productions had fully transformed from primarily a movie-making studio to a multi-faceted company with its own theme park, publishing, record labels and other interests that interwove each other in a process Roy Disney called \\"cross-pollination\\" but today we call synergy.<br /><br />During its six-year production period leading to its much-heralded release in 1959, Sleeping Beauty inspired the castle in Disneyland (and the walk-through attraction which is now being reopened and featured on this new DVD), fourteen different recording releases (one featuring Broadway star Mary Martin and another with Mouseketeer Darlene Gillespie), countless comics, coloring books, toys and other merchandise, and perhaps most significantly, promoted on television from Walt's very first Disneyland show in 1954 to the Mickey Mouse Club.<br /><br />While these elements existed for Disney in one form or another before Sleeping Beauty, never before had they been so homegrown.<br /><br />You can see many of these elements on the not-to-be-missed new 50th anniversary \\"Platinum Edition\\" DVD, overflowing with bonus features including a new audio commentary with Leonard Maltin, John Lasseter and Andreas Deja, several new mini-documentaries (with some Pixar artists as well as Disney personalities in attendance) and, as mentioned above, a Disneyland Sleeping Beauty Walk-Through Attraction With Walt Disney Imagineering that you can customize and experience before it opens to the public.<br /><br />Through years of work in writing his two \\"Disney's Lost Chords\\" books about the songs that did not make it into Disney films, artist/historian Russell Schroeder had a hand in making possible the \\"lost\\" sequences new to the DVD, including an alternate opening with a song called \\"Holiday\\" and three other song demos with storyboards to convey what might have been.
B000VECAEO|5.0|Very good season. My husband loves the series and was happy to get the last one to finish his collection.
B001ED7C58|4.0|I love the whole CD, except Bella's Lullaby.  What were the writers thinking?  Did they even read the books?  This song is pivotal and they butchered it.  The first 1:15 is just weird and what happened to it just being a piano solo?  I'd really like to hear how they're going to incorporate it into the movie considering Edward is only supposed to be playing a piano and yet we've got soaring violins and percussion?  If they make another movie, they've got to change this b/c it's just bad.
0515141429|2.0|I had heard such good things about this novel. Someone even said it was the best in the series.     If this had been my introduction to the Jack Reacher series, I would have never picked up another.     Thank goodness I started with \\"Persuader\\" and followed it up with \\"Without Fail\\" and then \\"One Shot\\" and \\"The Hard Way\\" and \\"Die Trying\\" and \\"The Enemy.\\" All easily worth a solid 5 stars.  (\\"The Enemy\\" is definitely one of my top two Reacher stories. I wish Child would do more about Reacher's time in the army.)    It's only recently that I've started having trouble with various books in the series. Either the stories dragged, (I'm still trying to get beyond page 50 of \\"Echo Burning\\") or Jack is almost unrecognizable. (After \\"Tripwire\\" and Jack's endless mooning over Jodie, I'm almost afraid to start \\"Running Blind.\\")    So to counter this streak of bad luck I thought I'd go back to Reacher's start and read \\"The Killing Floor\\" which I had avoided given the story and it's connection with Reacher's brother whom I grew to like in \\"The Enemy.\\"    The streak continues.    This novel dragged and dragged. Endless (dry) information about this small town in Georgia (?), some blues singer who I'm still not sure is real or fictional and the U.S. Currency system. As another reviewer mentioned, Child's exhaustive use of fragmented sentences, got, well, exhausting. I don't recall their use being so extensive and noticeable in the other novels. But maybe that's because I found those more entertaining.     For a while now, I've had the suspicion that Reacher might be a sociopath, or at least had such tendencies. This novel certainly sealed it for me. Or rather, the Reacher here is, but the level varies in the other novels.  I found it disturbing that Reacher spent more time ruminating on how \\"perfect\\" and attractive Roscoe was than he did about the fate of his brother. It was almost like had to talk himself into being angry about Joe and the subsequent need to do something. I was never convinced that Jack really felt anger or much upset. (It certainly wasn't stronger than what he felt about Roscoe which was better depicted. Or even the touch of anger about being forced out of the army which was subtle but better done.)    The long and short of is I never connected with or believed in this Reacher. He could have been a stick figure for all the emotion and convincing motivation he had. (A horny stick figure apparently).     There are spurts of action sprinkled throughout the novel. It's too bad the reader has to wade through chapter after chapter to find them. (I'm disappointed enough to say read the section about Reacher's night in prison, skip  ahead a hundred or so pages to his figuring out he's being tailed, then skip another hundred or so pages to his trip to NY and read to the end.)    I'm glad I read \\"Killing Floor\\" if for no other reason than to be able to say someday that I've read the complete Reacher collection, but needless to say it will not be on my repeat read list.    BTW, \\"Bad Luck and Trouble\\" was okay. Less plot more action (which is preferable to this.) Not one of the best, but was a good read overall. Great to see Negley in action.  Still working my way to \\"Nothing to Lose\\" given the reviews it's received.
B0001CCXY8|5.0|I guess I just want to bag on Razor606 because whoever that person is doesn't have a clue of what he or she is talking about.  If you pulled the wax balls out of your ears and your head out of your A** you would be able to hear the bass lines pretty clearly on any of their albums.  As for the drummer being just \\"alright!\\"  You obviously have no musical talent of your own and are pi**ed off at how damn good of a drummer he is that you have to talk down about him to make yourself feel better about what a little no-talent A** Clown you are.  Yes their lyrics are gory.  Most of their lyrics are inspired by old school horror movies and other similar interests.  You're not supposed to take the lyrics seriously as you obviously have, you retard.  To say that Cannibal Corpse makes \\"horrible\\" music and that at times it sounds like they are just making random noises, is to simply reveal that you are tone deaf, and don't have a clue about anything to do with making music.  If you don't like it don't listen to it.  If you're not into that type of music then just do like they always say not to and judge the thing by its cover art.  You don't have to make retarded remarks about one of the most innovative, talented, and well known bands of their genre.  You go right ahead and listen to Avril or whatever other homo crap you want to.  As for mentioning bands like Lamb of God and Trivium and talking trash about Cannibal Corpse you need to stop and think about what you are saying instead of allowing your brain farts to be the final choice of words to come out of your smelly mouth.  Trivium and Lamb of God are not really Death Metal however, they are both well liked by fans of Cannibal Corpse and vice versa.  Hence, just because you don't like, doesn't mean it isn't any good.  And talking about bands that sound exactly the same on every song, Lamb of God is a perfect example.  Chris Adler uses the same exact drum beat in all of his songs.  It may be arranged slightly different but it'sthe same damn thing, just like Paul from Cannibal Corpse.  Some of us like that stuff, others (homos like you) don't.  To be honest, ONE of the only drummers that I listen to on a regular basis that doesn't play the same thing in all of his songs is, Jason Bittner of Shadows Fall.  It's a hard thing to come by.  Even Travis Smith of Trivium plays a lot of the same thing in every song.  So to sit there and tear apart Cannibal Corpse for being redundant, defeated your whole damn argument.  You are a retard, a cold dry vagina, and a Jerry's Kid all-in-one.  Why don't you go douche, they're starting to complain about your vaginal stench all the way over in China.  And that is all.    P.S.  Why don't you send your mom over to my place.  She obviously needs to be slapped around a bit for raising such a piece of dog crap like yourself.  And then, I'll wrong hole her, as additional punishment.
B0019T9FL6|5.0|I love this CD. I have waited a long time for her debut. I like that she has something to appeal to all genres: Soul, R&B, Gospel, Rap, etc. There is a song for everyone, sung by an absolutely powerful voice. My favorites are Spotlight, Giving Myself, You Pulled Me Through, Go Away, I'm His Only Woman and Jesus Promised Me A Home Over There. And I disagree with the comment that said Pocketbook was unnecessary. It was a funny song. I totally got the song. But to each their own! I think Clive Davis did a phenomenal job with this CD and he definitely had the talent to make it work. Jennifer, you are a God given talent. Prayers to you and her family! The storm is here now for you but it won't last always.
B00008S7V7|4.0|I found Daniel Silva on amazon as I find most of the authors that I end up reading; by perusing what other people who are reading the same book as I are reading.  Anyway, this was an above-average spy thriller that pitted a retired Israeli agent against a militant Palestinian who was/is bent on destroying the Middle East peace process.  Since this book was written almost 8 years ago and there is still no \\"peace\\" in the Middle East this book is just as interesting today as it was when it was written.  Recommended - and can't wait to read the next books in the series.
B00000889Y|5.0|This is strange, but likeable stuff.  Imagine punk rock Elvis or demented 50s rock and roll, but to call it such still doesn't do justice to the uniqueness of the Cramps sound on this album.  It's a real party.  Surprisingly listenable.
B0019T9FL6|5.0|Jennifer has a powerful voice that cannot be denied.  The CD is enjoyable from beginning to end.  She will definitely be one of my favorites along with Alicia Keys, Jill Scott, and Rachelle Ferrell.
0385340990|5.0|I am actually still reading this book - only half way through.  But I hate to put it down!  I love the characters, and have enjoyed the letters that they share with each other.  I have not been a history buff, but reading the letters and learning about what life was like during the war has given me a new interest in the subject.  It's well-written and very clever!  enjoy!
B001EN71DQ|5.0|This is exactly what I've been waiting for: a low-priced collection of the \\"first\\" three Star Wars movies for my modest DVD collection.  I actually caught a deal yesterday that allowed me to buy both collections (the Trilogy and the Prequel Trilogy) for $34.99 combined, so this set will work great.  The Trilogy will replace my old VHS set, and now I'll finally have the Prequel Trilogy.  Yes, I hated Jar-Jar, and these movies aren't my favorite ever made; however, it'll give some closure to my OCD-driven need to complete a movie series.  In that respect, this release is perfect for me.<br /><br />Why all the hate from the Star Wars geeks?  As you've relentlessly pointed out, these are the same movies that Lucas has been releasing for the last few centuries; why does one more offend you so?  It's targeted to me, not you.  This particular packaging works great for folks like me who just want the basic collection at an affordable cost.<br /><br />Just wait a few more months for the \\"Super Jedi Apprentice Textbook Remastered Restored Empire Standard Version\\" (which will undoubtedly be on Blu-Ray).  Then you can have the movies you so love to hate in all their mediocre glory.<br /><br />--------------------<br /><br />EDIT: After watching all 6 episodes all the way through, I realized that Lucas actually changed the very end of \\"Return of the Jedi\\" to include Hayden Christensen as the ghostly Anakin Skywalker standing with Obi Wan and Yoda, as opposed to the unfamiliar actor in the original film.  While I personally think this ties the films together and makes for a better ending, I'm sure a lot of hard core fans will suffer strokes when they see it.<br /><br />Oh, and they inserted a couple of other scenes at this point, too.  While the Ewoks are celebrating with fireworks on Endor, random locations throughout the now-leaderless \\"Empire\\" are shown celebrating, as well; this includes a brief shot of Naboo, where you can hear the oh-so-loved voice of Jar Jar Binks shouting for joy (\\"Weesa FREE!\\", I think).  Yeah, I could have lived without that, too.<br /><br />I have to say that going from \\"Revenge of the Sith\\" (Episode 3) to \\"A New Hope\\" (Episode 4) was a jarring transition.  We're supposed to believe that the timeline has now jumped around 20 years into the future, yet the in-story technology and the film's special effects have taken a giant leap back in time.  It actually made me wish (HERESY ALERT!) that Lucas would remake the older films altogether.  Imagine what those films could be like with today's effects and more realistic acting.  Oh, well.  I guess I'll just have to make do with \\"Revenge of the Sith,\\" by far the best of the series., I could have lived without that, too.

1595478728|5.0|[[ASIN:1595478728 ORTHODOXY]][[ASIN:B000FC1CF0 Orthodoxy]]  If you enjoy mental gymnastics along with your Christian education, you will love this book. It is full of quotable lines, clever insights and more mental switchbacks than you will find in any other writer.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I typically go to reviews before I purchase....so I felt the need to write one for this.  I bought this after hitting a plateau with my kickboxing routine.  I have been working out 3-4 times a week for a year now - and felt like the cardio just wasnt doing it anymore.  So, I bought this - and it is my 2nd week using her DVDs.  I was skeptical at first - but these are really good workouts!  Some days I combine a cardio DVD with one level of Jillians 20 minute workout - others I do Level 1 and 2 back to back.  I have yet to jump to the 3rd level - since the first 2 are pretty intense!  I already am noticing results.  This is a great DVD to incorporate weight training into your routine!  I recommend to anyone!  The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wish she had one long level to use - rather then doing two back to back....otherwise it is great!
0385338082|5.0|This was by far the funniest book I have ever read. I was laughing out loud throughout the whole book.  I had read Kinsella's shopaholic series and decided to try her other books. I read this book in on sitting.  I can't wait to finishing reading her other books.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|I love this movie!  This product got lost in the mail, so a replacement was sent and arrived in about two days, then the original lost one showed up two days later.  I appreciated the prompt replacement and only had a slight headache dealing with the return of the original.  Overall, a pleasing experience, not flawless, but the flaws were promptly dealt with and that was excellent.
0696204800|4.0|This book's strength is the WIDE variety of quilt blocks it shows.  It's is very inspiring to page through.  There are classic geometric pieced blocks as well as \\"picture\\" pieced blocks (a sewing machine, animals, holiday themes) and classic appliques as well as more whimsical appliques.  There are many flowers and animals, as well as themed sections for the holidays, activities and sports, Bible stories, etc.    The weaknesses, in my opinion, are that the blocks are all 4\\", which is tiny for the complexity of some of them, although enlarging them wouldn't be difficult, and that the photos of the finished blocks don't seem terribly...inspired.  The color choices are often blah.  I look at them and think, did the person who put this together not have any sense of design?      If you want a book that has instructions and layouts to make entire quilts with large patterns (I'm thinking broken star type quilts), this will probably be a disappointment, as it only gives individual blocks meant to stand alone, but if you want to do a sampler type quilt or play around with styles of blocks, this would be excellent.
B001ED7C58|3.0|Driving techno and peppy beats wasn't what I expected for Bella and Edward.  Somehow it doesn't fit my perception of their love story or the cadence of a dreary green landscape.  I don't think it needed to be depressing but this is a bit grating for my ears.    Even the lullaby (the only reason why I bought the album) sounds like overly produced scales-- Definitely not something a man in love would compose for the woman who makes him feel everything that he once believed dead. I doubt Edward was surrounded by an orchestra when he plays this for her and the song barely has any emotional impact when played by piano alone.      Robert Pattinson's song was moody and underproduced.  I loved it.  Iron & Wine was pretty. Linkin Park song almost sets the right mood but fails. Blue Foundation works well for me. Paramore barely gets a nod for me because Evanescence does moody and tortured better.      I think I will buy the movie score (if that is released) to get what I was looking for.  This soundtrack is meant to appeal to the masses.      If you are buying the CD for any inserts...don't bother. Nothing but a tiny poster.     All of the songs were good in their own right but the tenor of the music wasn't what I was hoping to experience.  Buying this CD for the music without regard to the Twilight story and your gonna love it.    A good example of the music-movie relationship (although the movie was awful) was Queen of the Damned.  The sound track set you up for the movie experience. Another was Garden State, great music that fit movie the characters moods.
B0017VG69U|5.0|This supplier sent item at breathtaking speed.  Extradionary Service.  5 Stars are not enough to express my delight.  Perhaps 8 stars.
0385340990|1.0|I forced myself to finish this \\"feel good\\" novel,waiting and waiting for the charm that so many have found in it to work its magic.  It was just too clever and self congratulatory.  There were no nuances to the characters.  Juliet was clever, plucky and compassionate, her suitor was a rich handsome American businessman with no soul.  The Guernsey Islanders were brave and quaint - all except the judgmental Adelaide Addison (Miss) who signs her letters \\"Yours in Christian Consternation and Concern\\".  It was so obvious and so contrived.  Am I the only one who found it irritating?  Perhaps I should have guessed from the title.  On the plus side there were some lovely descriptions of Guernsey which made me want to visit.
B001GAOY5U|1.0|I just got my copy of Journey to the center of the Earth. Not only din't I get 4 pair's of 3D glasses, but I didn't even get 1 pair. Whats up with That?  GJ
B000286S8S|3.0|Trying to reduce Cherone's time in the band by refusing to acknowledge he was even there is childish. Including live tracks of Hagar trying to be Lee Roth is pathetic. A few tracks from the unfairly-maligned Cherone album would've kept everyone happy.
1416594884|4.0|Very good, though not one of his best.  As usual, very rich characters and a great story.  He stays exclusively in one location, which is unusual, but it works.  It seems like the book could be adapted to a stage play.
0739368044|3.0|The book was a little drawn out, and the action scenes were a bit lacking.  Not the best book in the series but hope the next one makes up for it.  All in all a good read.
0596522347|5.0|Powerpoint sucks.  However, it's pretty tough to _not_ include a Powerpoint presentation if you're trying to convince someone that's used to Powerpoint.  Slide:ology leaves irritating presentations behind.    Great stuff.
B000FC1MCS|4.0|I think anyone on any level can relate to this. Its a nice short read and holds your attention throughout the book. I'm not so sure it lives up to its hype, but likely if you thought you'd found a book no one else had heard of you would have thought it a big win! If you are looking for a book to understand your autistic child, this is not the book you are looking for.
B001EN71DG|5.0|I see this box set is getting a lot of bad reviews so I thought I'd chime in.    Most people giving it one star are just mad that there is another boxset release. This doesn't bother me at all. I never bought the other boxsets because of all the CG that was added, those aren't the movies I love.    People are also upset that the originals aren't in anamorphic widescreen and are poor transfers. Yeah an anamorphic version would have been nice and maybe they could have been retransfered, but these movies look a lot better than my old VHS set. Most likely these movies look better now than they did in the crappy theatar I saw them in.    In conclusion, this is a very affordable way to get all the original versions of the original trilogy, plus you get all the touched up versions.
B00005JPMZ|1.0|This movie & game are a WASTE of time & money!! This has gone so far off the map its not even funny!!! Hasbro once again SCREWS a great name & toyline!! They have done the same to the Transformers! No wonder stores can't sell ANY of the turtle toys!! Hasbro NEVER gets it right! They NEED to FIRE staff that WASN'T born in the 80's if they ever want to see the light of day again!! I HATE Hasbro with a TERRIBLE VENEGENCE!!!
B001CDLATE|5.0|I have watched this masterpiece 20 or more times on a regular dvd. I was amazed to watch it in Blu-ray.  You percieve a greater depth of meaning through the clarity of the video.
B00004S35Z|5.0|WHEN I THINK BACK ON ALL THE GREAT ALBUMS PUT OUT BY STEVIE WONDER IN THE EARLY-MID 70'S WHAT USUALLY COMES TO MIND IS \\"INNERVISIONS\\", \\"TALKING BOOK\\", AND \\"MUSIC OF MY MIND\\". I HAD COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN ABOUT THIS ONE, WHICH WAS RELEASED IN 1974. SAW IT IN THE MUSIC STORE TODAY AND HAD TO PICK IT UP. AND I AM GLAD I DID, IT FITS RIGHT IN WITH ALL OF THE OTHER WONDERFUL MUSIC HE PRODUCED IN THAT TIME PERIOD.  LOOKING THROUGH THE LINER NOTES, I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THAT SOME OF THE OTHER MUSICAL CONTRIBUTORS ON THIS ALBUM INCLUDE \\"SNEAKY PETE\\" KLEINOW, MINNIE RIPPERTON, THE JACKSON FIVE (SINGING BACKUP ON \\"YOU HAVEN'T DONE NOTHIN\\"), DENISE WILLIAMS, SHIRLEY BREWER, THE PERSUASIONS, PAUL ANKA, AND OTHERS. GREAT ALBUM, A REAL BLAST FROM THE PAST.
1596912863|3.0|This bittersweet, funny slim little novel is first and foremost a love letter to Jane Austen, despite its well-deserved (and hilarious) dedication to Colin Firth. For those of us who, like the novel's heroine Jane Hayes, have happily reread all of Austen's novels over the years (except, as Hale points out, [[ASIN:030738683X Northanger Abbey (Vintage Classics)]], which only got that one read), this story is a pleasant romp in Austenland. I was pleased with the way Jane questioned what in the world she was doing at what amounts to a Regency period fun park, with the way she alternately resists giving in to the fantasy and longs to dive in with reckless abandon. And I enjoyed the romantic comedy finish line ending.
B001CW7ZXK|5.0|I won't go into what this movie is about. If you are not familiar with Animal House yet, then shame on you. What I will say is this edition, the \\"30th Anniversary Edition Gift Set\\" version does not have any of the ads or commercials that reviewers of other versions are complaining about. I have not seen the 30th Anniversary non-Gift Set version, so I can't say if it has ads or not, but it may be worth the extra 10 bucks or so to get an ad-free Gift Set.
0452281881|4.0|The doing is a carer in advertising. Most of the important aspects of this book have been covered in other reviews, what I want to add is that when young people are making career choices--the field they will enter--they should think about the kind of people that will be surrounding them. If you're thinking about marketing, this book gives you a real idea, the good and the bad....
B000QQFKYE|5.0|Lynch really out-did himself with this film.  1 minute short of 3 straight hours of abstract, non-linear, mind opening, mind blowing darkness...  Laura Dern's performance was astounding, and really shook my senses. The only reason she hasn't been recognized for this role, that I can think of, is that this film is so much to take in, that some people would find it hard to sit threw...mostly for 2 reasons. Because its sooo long and intense, and because it is honestly twisted and difficult to catch on to on a first-viewing basis. BUT, David Lynchs' work (with the exception of \\"Wild At Heart\\" and \\"Blue Velvet\\") is pretty much made to be watched more than once...  This is his most abstract film since \\"Eraserhead\\". It is honestly a modern masterpiece...especially after watching \\"Lynch (one)\\" and \\"Lynch 2\\" (2 is featured on the second disk of this film).   The second disk alone has enough mind bending features and featurettes to keep your brain boggled for hours.  Great Film and Great purchase!!!
B0014DZ2VO|4.0|I saw Quantum of Solace Today 05/11/2008. The action start with a car chase and goes on to the end of the movie. In short its action packed, however its missing the stuff that all James bond movies delivered before, even Casino royal acted by the same Daniel Craig. It's missing the Bond Gadgets. I mean we will know that Bond had a lot of fancy gadgetry stuff under his sleeve to assist him in escaping a trap and or conquering his villains. There was a documentary with James Bond Thunderball DVD and it was mentioned that the US NAVY was interested with a certain under water oxygen breathing tube that bond used in the movie and also a statement by the Russian KGB that whenever a new Bond Movie is released, they would bring it for screening to inspect the gadgets used in the movie as Bond movies gave them a glimpse on the high-tech stuff they wanted to have to give to their Spy's.<br />Now don't get me wrong, the movie excels in every shot, however it's not the bond we are used to.<br />This bond is far too dry and has no scene of humor.<br /><br />I hope that they correct the story line for the next coming bond movie.
B000UX6THK|5.0|This series is mind blowing. The characters and the character development, the criss-crossing story lines and ALL surrounding the mysterious death of a high school student...    This box is worth owning just for the \\"perks\\". The original introductions to each episode by \\"Log Lady\\" (which are optional), and the International Version of the \\"pilot\\" episode which is a whole 30 minutes longer and has an alternate ending to the series...  Great Set...the only complaint I had was that It does not include the movie...  oh well...then it would have been perfect...lol
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight is a rousing masterpiece of film-making not simply for its acting, which is superb, its cinematography, which is excellent, but also for its drive into the heart of philosophy and the human nature.  Often, the films that connect with us the most are those that delve into a philosophical or current affairs issue and illustrate it in terms that everyone can understand, and The Dark Knight does this exceptionally well.  Heath Ledger's Joker is a case study in terrorism and Christian Bale's Batman is a shining example of how to combat such terror.  Harvey Dent is human contradiction personified, for he is both the hope of a city and a vengeful, dark human.  All of these both add to the entertainment of the film and allow the viewer to probe deep questions of the mind, which is the hallmark of a classic film which The Dark Knight has in spades.   Ledger gave the performance of a lifetime in his role of The Joker through superb acting and believability.  Ledger practiced method acting for this film, which other actors like Marlon Brando, Christian Bale and Daniel Day-Lewis also practice, which is an art form of literally becoming the character that one is set to portray.  To place oneself in the mind of a psychopath is extremely dangerous but Ledger does it so well that I literally thought that the Joker had come alive and was walking around in this film.  That is method acting to the core.  To make the audience believe that instead of being an actor portraying a role, the character has literally come alive and is walking around on screen is at the essence of this art form and Ledger's fantastic believability is one of many aspects of The Dark Knight that make it so incredible.  Not only does Ledger's performance add to the entertainment of the film itself, his character is also a case study in modern warfare.  The Joker wages a war of no battle-lines and of utter unpredictability.  Bombs in boats, hijacking school buses, and doing allof it for its own sake is exactly what a modern terrorist would do and this is where a parallel can be drawn between the Joker and Osama bin Laden.  Both are unpredictable and both seek the destruction of another group in society.  The Joker wants to destroy the status quo and all those who protect it and bin Laden wants to kill infidels. Both accomplish this through unanticipated attacks which reflect the unpredictability of terrorism.  Both of these people commit their crimes for an ideological reason, as illustrated through the Joker's burning of a huge stack of money and bin Laden's already large fortune, which make them even harder to combat.  This character illustrates, through Ledger's masterful performance as the Joker/ terrorist, that terrorism can infiltrate every aspect of society and destroy it with complete unpredictability with hardly any hope of destroying terrorism through conventional means.  However, Batman illustrates how to defend society from people such as the Joker.     Christian Bale's, who also practices method acting, Batman is a stirring example of how to combat the terror introduced by the Joker.  Through unconventional means and by stretching the limits of the law, and in some cases exceeding its boundaries, Batman illustrates how to combat modern day terrorism.  When Batman kidnaps a Japanese banker to demand that he reveal the mob's bank rollers, he is acting outside of normal authority, but it is a necessary action to take in order to use him as leverage against the mobsters to force them to tell Batman where the Joker is.  Another instance of using creative thought to combat the Joker is when Batman recreates how the Joker shot his gun, then puts together his thumb print, and finds out who he really is and where he came from to better fight and defeat him in the future.  This is an example of how to fight modern day terrorism.  Simply throwing guns, troops, and bombs at terrorists isn't going to work the way that conventional warfarehas in the past.  Now is a time for creativity in warfare, for using technology to root out the enemy and then bring him to justice.  Batman is the supreme example of this since he uses his brain and technology, like image inducing sound waves, tools to disrupt electronic signals and move into and out of buildings rapidly, to bring down the Joker and give him his just desserts.  But The Dark Knight also gives us an unique insight into the human mind with the character of Harvey Dent.   Harvey Dent is a very contradictory character, both a shining example of good to Gotham because of his previous work in bringing criminals of the Moroni mob to justice, but also a vengeful, fallible human because of his anger after Rachel's death which leads him to commit many crimes.  However, one sympathizes with Harvey because, despite all of his work and accomplishments, he lost what he loved more than anything in the world-Rachel.  Her death drove him to madness and murder.  So, despite the fact that he killed people and worked essentially for the Joker later in the film, we understand his pain because everyone has lost something before and felt the need for revenge.  We all have been there, and we all feel his pain.  In Harvey's actions we see a part of humanity.  He is a great man who brought many criminals to justice, just as the human race has its good side.  However, after Rachel's death, he resorts to killing and revenge to heal his pain, just as humans are vengeful and sometimes dark creatures.  Harvey Dent is a human representing humanity-great, but tragically flawed.     The Dark Knight is one of the best films of this year and arguably one of the best of the decade.  Its acting, direction, and probing of philosophical and current affairs questions and the human nature make it both highly entertaining and highly thoughtful, which is a hallmark of excellent film making.  I would highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys stirring action and thoughtful probing of thehuman n
B000NZD9RS|5.0|I have always been a fan of Pink Floyd, since there works with Syd Barret, all the way until they split.  Out of every genre of music, and every band I've heard of in my years, this album (especially on vinyl) is an experience to be reckoned with.  The sheer force of the lyrics and music expressed on this album are about as good as music will ever get. Period.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I have several different editions of band of bro DVDs, and ever since the HD concept kicked in , I've started to wait. Couldn't get my hands on the HD DVD for its only on sale in Jap (I might be wrong, but couldn't find it else where) and really expensive(sell by single volume). This blu-ray set surely worth waiting for! I'd give it V:9, A:10, SP:8, a classic!
006085880X|4.0|The Pact by Jodi Picoult was very fast moving in some parts and slow moving in others. It's an exhilarating and emotional story, where the characters in the book were very real to me and I thought that the story could have been based on a true one.    The story line of this book is mainly based on two families, the Hartes and the Golds, who lived next door to each other for eighteen years. They shared everything together. Chris and Emily, their children, grew up together and their friendship grows into love, which is no surprise to their families and everyone around them. In fact, their families support and sometimes even push their relationship to happen. Then one day, Emily winds up dead by a shot to her head and Chris is accused of murdering her. Now, the Hartes and Golds have to face every parent's worst nightmare: how did they never see this coming? What did they do wrong? What exactly was going on with Emily? These questions are the ones that we all want answered as we read this book.    During the murder case, the book goes back in time to when Chris and Emily were little to show how they developed as friends, as a couple, and were always with one another. This book is also about suicide and depression and the minds of two children growing up by spending all their time together.  I read this book with a book club and had a hard time stopping at our stopping points to discuss what was happening. I constantly wanted to get to the end and experience some resolve. Overall, it was a very moving and sad story, but entertaining to read. After I got going, it was difficult for me to put the book down. I read the book in only three sittings.     It may, in some cases, be disturbing for some people, because of the suicide and depression side of it, but overall it is a brilliant and outstanding story. This kind of thing can happen in real life in my opinion. If you are looking for a fluffy, feel good love-story, this book is not for you. Jodi Picoult challenges readersto expect the unexpected and leaves a lot to the imagination as you close the book at the end.
B0016Q2D5M|4.0|4 Red-Blue glasses are included in the movie's case. The resulting 3-D quality is unimpressive on a TV, but very good on a PC.  Note that the great 3-D been talked about is not in the home DVD, because special equipment would be needed. The movie is anyway very entertaining, if not sophisticated. The story moves along at a good steady pace, keeping the viewer's interest. Plus, it is also family-friendly.
0143038419|5.0|I was completely amazed to see any negative feedback about this book.  It was honestly one of the best book I have ever read.  I loved the author's honesty and openness.  She was funny, real, and relateable.  I wrote so many of the things in her book down and look over them for inspiration.  I especially loved how I cheered from her and got to see her progress.  It made me want to read the sequel with then next year of her life!
B001JOIEZ4|3.0|To say I had high hopes is an understatement. When I read Twilight I thought of dreary rainy Forks and Bella being kind of an outcast.     The music however, is electronic pop/alt. rock. Some interesting song choices, and I thought Linkin Park fit in perfect with my image of Bella's story. But the rest of the soundtrack just leaves me a little lost.     Paramore's \\"Decode\\" was pretty good, but the second song not so much.    Pattinson's song was terrible. Beautiful guitar work but good lord this song was mumbled and left a lot to be desired.     I know a lot of people have complained about Bella's song, and I have to agree. Its a beautiful song...just not for Bella. Edward wrote a PIANO piece. Not a huge instrumental featuring violins as a key. A simple (yet complicated) piece that he'd perfected with time and was supposed to show Bella how much he felt for her. But it just started...and ended. I don't really want to listen to it again.     Iron & Wine (never heard of 'em) was good, but the song was a little misplaced.     I'm finding myself hoping that most of these songs will be background music during the movie, because it'll probably take me completely out of the experience.     Here's to hoping the score will be better...but this time I think I'll wait and preview it BEFORE placing a preorder.
0375826726|5.0|Definitely \\"Exceeded Expectations\\" with this book.  I enjoy seeing how the writing matures from book to book and, with it, the characters.  I cannot wait to read the last book in the series!
0440237688|5.0|I read this in 7th grade and loved the book. I recently ran out of books and I read it over again (I'm a college freshman) and loved it even more. The plot is amazing, the characters make it even better. This is truly a piece of art, and the meaning behind the book is astounding.  I would definitely suggest this book for a good page-turner to all ages.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|We loved Wall-E the first minute it started.  I did not missed any of the messages and subplots that Disney and Pixar portrayed in this movie like pollution, overweight, decline of humans beings, our future, etc.  This movie will make you think.  Even though my kids loved the movie some messages might not be caught in full by small kids; so I took my time to explain to them how people got overweighed since they already figured out why the earth was polluted. We saw the movie again and now it is one of my kid's favorite's movies ever and ours too.  Wall-E is an Oscar Winner to us; and we are desperately waiting to own it on DVD; and why not? maybe in toys for Christmas.
0143038419|1.0|I have heard so many positive things about this book, so I decided to buy it for my sister-in-law as a Christmas present last year, without reading it. What a mistake. I was given the book recently and was very excited to read it, but my excitement faded with every page. The endless sob stories and self reflection was just boring. Every other page, I found myself caring less and less about what this self absorbed, whining woman had to say. I partially blamed it on the fact that I had just finished \\"Infidel\\" by Ayaan Hirsi Ali, which is an amazing story about one woman's ability to overcome poverty, genital mutilation, arranged marriage, political chaos, etc... It is a tough jump from that book to this one. One reviewer criticized those of us who said we couldn't finish it. I honestly tried, but after I was half way through India, I found myself skipping through sentences and entire paragraphs due to lack of interest. I don't think any strong, happy, independent, positive person could enjoy this book.
B000E0WJIC|5.0|i find reviews very helpful when buying music, even though we all have our own taste...Anyways, i decided to buy this album, as i have no other BFMV albums, after hearing some of the songs on it and i absolutely love it! I am a \\"newer metal\\" music person, and this album fits that category for me, but still has the older metal influence. What an amazing band, and you will definately be please after getting this album! Every song on it is good! That makes a person happy when you buy an album and every song is good, how often does that happen? Well, there is maybe the slow one i don't care too much for, but every metal band has a ballad...Anyways, buy it, if you like this band!!! It is well worth it!!
031606792X|5.0|I have read this book twice now. It truly was an amazing book and I wish the series didn't have to end. There is nothing like reading these books for the first time. You are really immersed in the world of these \\"good vampires\\" who truly make you fall in love with them. I must say of all the four main books in this series, this was my least favorite of the four, but still truly spectacular and entertaining. Of all the books I've ever read, this series were by far the best. Regarding this book, I loved the story, and I'm happy about how it turned out, however there were some small things that did bother me. I really felt as though the romance died down between Bella and Edward after the honeymoon. I didn't feel like it was there anymore, which sucks because throughout the first three books, you really have a lot of sweet moments, but I felt as though it went away after the honeymoon. In addition, I thought that the love between Edward and his daughter wasn't as strong as it should be. I wished there were more daddy/daughter moments, but that was lacking in my opinion. Finally, the biggest problem I had with this book was that I felt as though the ending left something to desire. The book should of ended with a bang. I expected a full blown out fight between the vampires, wolves and the Volturi, however, we were left with a plain old truce. When the Volturi turned to leave, I really expected them to turn around and say \\"just kidding. Let's fight\\" but nothing. This annoyed me a bit, however, it was still pretty good, just not what I expected to happen in the last book of the series. On the plus side, we get to see Bella as a vampire and learn about her abilities which was pretty cool. I felt as though the first half of the book was incredible beyond belief. The wedding, honeymoon and birth of Renesmee was memorable. I am sure I will read these books again and again. I highly recommend to everyone!
0375826726|3.0|I eagerly waited for this third book to be released and bugged the sales staff at the store every week in anticipation.<br /><br />I really did enjoy the book, but feel as many others do that it is very long winded and also too violent. I want to be entertained, not feel my stomach lurch. Paolini can suggest the violence and our imaginations would do the rest. We don't need graphic details.<br /><br />I would have preferred spending much less time with the dwarves and more time with the elves. They have much more to offer in my opinion. Story lines were started and went nowhere (perhaps they'll be addressed is the fourth book)and after the big build up of the other secret dragon, it was incredibly dissapointing that he was killed off so easily in a battle.<br /><br />It's worth the read, but could have been better. Paolini has talent and imagination but needs to concentrate.
B00009AOBI|4.0|`Mask' is the type of film that moves you to tears.  It is genuinely sweet and sincere and heartbreaking as well as heartwarming.  It is true that the film can, at times, feel forced and manipulative, but who doesn't like having their feelings manipulated in this manner.  The true story of Rocky Dennis is inspirational and poignant and one that we all should take to heart; and `Mask' gives us the opportunity to do just that.<br /><br />The film recounts the final year of Rocky's life.  Growing up with a rare disease (craniodiaphyseal dysplasia) was not easy for Rocky, but with the support from his very strong and very loving mother Rusty, Rocky was able to make it through.  Teased by other kids and humiliated by teachers, Rocky learned at a young age to form a thick skin, and his mother's defensive and free-spirited attitude helped Rocky to realize that he was no different than anyone else and thus didn't deserve to be treated differently.  The film also portrays Rocky's relationship with his mother and his struggle to clean her up (she was heavy into drugs and this caused problems between her and Rocky).  He was a very strong boy, a very stable force in his mother's life and he made a huge impact on all who came in contact with him.<br /><br />Like I mentioned, the film is at times quite manipulative.  It is a dramatized account of the real Rocky Dennis's life, but that is to be expected.  It falls into the clich&eacute;d family/drama moments (the aggravated confrontation that leads to a regretful slapping of a child...the conveniently placed shelf of beer mugs prime for smashing in a fit of emotional rage) and while these moments are unnecessary, I'd be lying if I said they weren't effective.<br /><br />What is necessary and equally effective is the acting, which is, for the most part, outstanding.  Reportedly Cher was quite upset that her performance was not recognized by Oscar.  That in itself seems pretty presumptuous, since to expect you will be Oscar nominated is rather arrogant; but then I saw her performance and quite honestly, it was better than half the nominees.  As Rusty, Cher is above and beyond outstanding.  She emulates every raw and passionate emotion rolling through this woman's body.  She captures the love, the fear, the depression, the pride; everything this woman stood for is presented for us accurately.  Eric Stoltz has a tough job of acting through makeup, which means that he has to do a lot more with his eyes than under normal circumstances.  Many have praised him for his portrayal of Rocky, and I will not knock him, but in all honesty, to me, he was the weakest link here.  I was more moved by Cher's portrayal of his mother than I was of Stoltz performance; but that is just me.  Sam Elliott is strong as the father figure in his life; Gar, and Laura Dern has a beautifully sincere turn as Diana, the blind girl who falls in love with Rocky.<br /><br />The film is touching, as to be expected, and in all its `Ron Howardesque' ways it manages to choke out the cry-baby in all of us.  `Mask' is a very tender film that tells a very beautiful story of love and strength and the power to overcome all obstacles presented before us.  Rocky was born with a deficiency but he never allowed that to factor into his life.  He lived each and every day to the fullest, and that is an inspiration for all of us, especially those of us who tend to take life for granted.I saw her performance and quite honestly, it was better than half the nominees.

B0001FR3IQ|4.0|\\"Gothika\\" doesn't seem to be a fitting title for this film, but the story truly is gothic.  After a car crash, Dr. Miranda Grey (Berry) awakens a prisoner in the forensic mental hospital where she formerly worked. She's accused of killing her husband and boss (Dutton), but cannot recall.      This is a very atmospheric and tense thriller.  One of Berry's best performances to date and haunting to say the least.  Strongly recommend you do not watch this on a dark and stormy night.    Rebecca Kyle, November 2008
B0013FXWU6|5.0|What an amazing film. Definite must see. i was really stunned by this film being a huge Paul Anderson fan. I thought how could he top Magnolia and then he made this. I do not really get how the coen brothers won for both best direction and best picture considering No Country For Old Men is nowhere near as good as both this film or the Coens' previous films. In saying this though I cannot be surprised though the academy has been filled with people who picked \\"Going My Way\\" as the best picture over \\"Double Indemnity\\" or 'Hamlet\\" over Houston's \\" The Treasure of Sierra Madre\\". So I think this film will follow such a suit.
B001DSNEJM|4.0|Spoilers below!<br /><br />Those who are expecting some fast paced, action oriented flick with creatures galore are bound to be disappointed. This one is more of a character based, thoughtful, slow but usually interesting story.  Paul Walker is great as the main character, who thought he was dying by lethal injection but who turns out to be a subject of a rehab experiment spearheaded by Bob Gunton.  Linda Cardellini is a sympathetic associate, while Piper Perabo plays the saddened wife very well, with a lovely daughter portrayed by Brooklynn Proulx.<br />Worth a look.
B000M2EH32|5.0|I didn't know anything about Mario Biondi until release from Dimitri From Paris \\"Return To The Playboy Mansion\\" [[ASIN:B000Y9PIKE Return to the Playboy Mansion]]  You will be surprised by this singer's deep and warm voice. It recalls the great interpreter of soul and rhythm 'n' blues music. Many will think of a black singer. Mario was born in Catania, Sicilia, Italy. Certainly he's capable of expressing his Soul when singing. \\"Handful of Soul\\" is an album ranging between Jazz and Soul. The result is in this very enticing music release, whose sound swings from smooth vocal melodies to rhythmic tracks to dance to. The love for Rhythm & Blues and Soul, the styles of music mostly appreciated by Mario, took him to listen to a certain music repertoire, in particular some of the most representative related artists (Earth Wind & Fire, Donny Hattaway, Billy Paul, Luther Vandross, Lou Rawls, Aretha Franklin, Eryka Badu, Will Dowing. In this album, not only he delivers a very convincing interpretation but his voice adds a different color to the music in \\"Slow Hot Wind\\" as well as in \\"A handful of Soul\\". The feel-good sensation spread in \\"On A Clear Day\\" is certainly enhanced by the deep husky voice of the interpreter. Mario himself remained pleasantly astonished by his own familiarity with those tunes. The inspiration he got from singing them moved himself, along with the other co-authors, to lay down the track \\"Gig\\", clearly of American derivation, Cole Porter style. Whilst \\"No Mercy For Me\\" reveals Mario's true soul of a crooner, \\"This Is What You Are\\" the most beautiful song in this album, a fine piece of vocal dance-jazz with fascinating harmonies and captivating solos. Tributes to rock-blues, soul-blues and rhythm-blues follow respectively in the shape of \\"I Can't Keep From Crying Sometime\\" by Al Kooper.
B00004TRD8|5.0|Great movie, great action that had me sitting on the edges.  Edward Furlong was especially good, considering it was his first major movie.
B00005K3OT|4.0|Based on the novel by Joanne Harris, the film \\"Chocolat\\" takes a lot of liberties with the book's story, but is still a very good film. The movie revolves around a mysterious woman, Vianne (Juliette Binoche), who arrives rather suddenly to a remote French village with her young daughter in tow. Vianne quickly settles in and establishes a chocolate shop, which instantly becomes the talk of the town. While certain people are intrigued by this fascinating woman and her sinfully sweet candies, other townspeople see Vianne as an immoral person who threatens the village's core principles and values. When a band of \\"pirates\\" (a.k.a. Irish gypsies) arrive in town, Vianne immediately befriends their leader (Johnny Depp), causing other people in the town (especially the mayor) to resent her even more. Eventually Vianne is tempted to flee again in search of another new start, but this time she may have found something worth staying and fighting for.<br /><br />As I said, there are some major differences between the film and the novel. Usually when filmmakers deviate from the books their films are based on, they end up with a gigantic mess. However, that isn't the case with \\"Chocolat,\\" which is an endearing film with a wonderful cast. I highly recommend it.

B000JIJPZY|5.0|I had a late shower (5 weeks old) and received this as a gift. She has loved it from the get-go. She was entranced by the music at first, then learned eventually how to make it go on her own. She learned to pull the butterflies off the velcro. She chews on most of the things, but that's what babies do. The only pointless part I think is the pillow. I'm not a huge fan of the way the ball and mirror and all that work (and the little flap is pretty pointless too), but she was never very interested in those anyway, so for us, those don't go into the score (or it I guess it would have been a 3 or 4). Overall, we are very pleased, and at 6 months, she still enjoys it.
B001ED7C58|2.0|I have got to say I am very disappointed.  These are not the songs I would have imagined for this movie.  The ONLY reason why I even gave this cd a 2 star review is because Linkin Park is my favorite band and their song is on here.<br />I was so excited to hear Bella's Lullaby and now I am even more upset.  It is supposed to be a piano piece inspired by Edward's love for Bella, which is not what this song is about.  This song is from an entire orchesta and I would defintely not call it a love song.  Honestly the songs by Robert Pattinson are not good either (sorry Rob, I do love your acting)  I really expected alot more from this CD.
0142407542|5.0|I agree with other reviews that I don't think this book is as good as The Gruffalo...but I'm still giving it 5 stars because it is still a really great book.  I don't think the story is as clever and the ending seems a little anti-climatic.  But my 18 month old son LOVES this book...even more than The Gruffalo.  This is one of the most often read books in our house.
B000U1ZV3U|4.0|Wyatt Earp came out around the same time as Tomb Stone.  It seemed that Tomb Stone over shadowed Wyatt Earp for some reason but I much preferred Wyatt Earp.  Dennis Quad is a much better Doc Holiday than Val Kilmer.  In fact, as much as I like Kilmer him being Doc Holiday was one of the things that kept Tomb Stone from appealing to me.  On the other hand, Quad's Doc Holiday is one of Wyatt Earp's strong points.  Kostner is excellent in this role.  He is able to show Wyatt's personality changes throughout the movie as events effect his life.  This is a long movie but it has a good pace that makes the three plus hours go by quickly.  Not as well as Pearl Harbor did but not bad.  Even though the movie is long, and they cover a lot of territory, I couldn't help feeling that there were some holes left unfilled here and there.  Like, how did we get from point A to point D, what happened to B and C.  Overall, I really like Wyatt Earp and that's why it's in my collection.  One other thing worth mentioning about this movie is the fact that the famous shoot out at the O K Corale, is just that, a shoot out.  In older movie versions based on Wyatt Earp or the famous shoot out had it being a long drawn out battle with people taking cover etc.  I don't know which is more historically accurate but the difference stood out to me.    Now this is not a new movie but it is new to Blu-ray.  It carries a budget price which makes this movie an excellent value.  The Blu-ray video quality is very good on this movie.  Just notice the detail in the early scene where Wyatt as a boy is running through the corn field.  The audio is on par with modern movies as well.  You aren't going to get a lot of effects like a Star Wars movie but the sound is good.  Not tinny or thin sounding like some older movies that get transferred to a new format.  I'm interested in hearing how Disney deals with this issue on their remasters of very old movies being released again on Blu-ray.    If some how Wyatt Earpmissed your VCR when first released and you like Westerns, this is a must see movie.  If you are looking to add a title to your beginning Blu-ray collection, Wyatt Earp is a fine example of the format and at about half the price of most new releases you can't go wrong.
0142405809|5.0|We have almost all of the books from this author/illustrator team and they are an amazing talent.  Every book they come out with is sooo clever and beautifully illustrated.  This one is no exception.  It is a great rhyming \\"read-aloud\\" and the moral of the story is not lost on the reader.  My 18 month old son has not grown tired of having this read to him on a daily basis...and I have not grown tired of reading it to him.
B000GY729M|5.0|Honestly this album is great, plain and simple.  I love reading peoples reviews saying this album is terrible and the Killers are dead...Craziness, all of it.  Just because Sam's Town sounds different from Hot Fuss doesn't mean it sucks.  Cool your heads off people its ok.  And brace yourself because their next album will be different too (oh no!!!) :)  Killers are great because they have different angles and sounds.  They try new things.  I applaud.
0142501123|5.0|I bought this for my son after getting turned on to Julia Donaldson/Axel Scheffler when I bought The Gruffalo.  I have since bought most of their books and I'm usually not disappointed.  This book is one of my favorites and also one of my sons favorites to read.  He is 18 months old and carries it around with him.  Before his naps and bedtime, I always read to him a few different books.  Now that he's older, I ask him to bring me books that he wants me to read and this one is regularly brought to me to read.  I don't mind at all because the story is really cute and it is a great rhyming \\"read-aloud\\" and the illustrations are eye-catching.
B000FVHJE4|4.0|Drugs, sex, and rock 'n' roll: one phrase epitomizes the life of the lead singer for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Anthony Kiedis. Scar Tissue, Kiedis' autobiography, is a fast tempo, easy read that has an abundance of captivating stories. Anthony's childhood was filled with drug use and sex starting at an extremely young age. By the time he was fourteen, Kiedis had begun smoking pot, having sex, and shooting up cocaine. Anthony's unstable lifestyle never ceased to change until years later after seeing close friends die from drug use and personally having multiple near death experiences, which has made Anthony a true contemporary of the nineties. However, die hard Chili Peppers fans may be disappointed with the lack of band history or lack of details about members. Instead, Scar Tissue details how Anthony's lifestyle and experiences have influenced the creativity and lyricism of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.   As most children his age were hitting puberty, Anthony Kiedis was taking his first hits off joints and shots of coke. His drug dealer father smoked pot with him at age twelve (26) and let him have sex with his girlfriend shortly after (39). Anthony quickly moved on to coke when he was only fourteen (84). Anthony's wild life was not simply drugs and sex though. There were many reckless decisions, most involving drugs, which very easily could have seriously injured him. A certain instance that could have easily left him paralyzed was an experience with Flea, the bassist. They had begun to get high and jump off buildings into pools in high school, so when Anthony was jumping off one building he overshot the pool and ended up on the concrete. Luckily he had only broken his back and needed a month in traction to re-set his vertebrae (68). Consequently, Anthony was never able to get off on the right foot with his life and seemed destined for heavy drug addiction and reckless decisions for the rest of his life. It is incredible and unbelievable that Kiedis was able to makeit past twenty-five. Especially after some of his close contemporaries, Hillel Slovak and Kurt Cobain died due to much of the same activity.  Though Scar Tissue is in no way a book reliving the tails of Anthony Kiedis' band mates, it breaks down how Anthony and the band related to each other and how Anthony influenced the band's creativity. The lyricism and much of the drama reflected in the songs of the Red Hot Chili Peppers were due to Anthony's turbulent lifestyle. The ideas for the majority of the Red Hot Chili Peppers lyrics and songs came about as a result of drug addictions, sexual experiences, and skewed relationships. \\"Under the Bridge\\" is one song that details Kiedis' struggle with drugs and relationships. Anthony was driving home from rehearsal one day in a melancholy state of mind while reflecting on the way his addiction to shooting heroin under a bridge deteriorated the relationships around him. As he continued to think he began creating a poem and as a result one of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' greatest hits was born (295).   As Anthony's main influences for his lyricism are derived from his own personal drug addictions, sexual experiences, and skewed relationships. He also takes away experiences from others close to him. In the song \\"Breaking the Girl\\" Anthony merges both styles. While Anthony is thinking back on his ex-girlfriend Carmen in a sort of purgatory like state of mind relationship wise, he begins to think about his father's life as well. He begins to think about how he does not want to end up like his father with a temporarily fulfilling life jumping from girl to girl, night to night. So in the song \\"Breaking the Girl\\" Anthony expresses how his father's lifestyle is not as fulfilling as it once seemed and that stable relationships are what complete your life (271). Consequently, Scar Tissue presents the interesting idea that if Anthony would not have lived the life he had, much of the music produced by the Red Hot Chili Peppers would have never happened.   Scar Tissue`s detail of Anthony Kiedis' road to sobriety present how truly mind blowing Kiedis' survival of addiction actually is. He is undoubtedly a nineties rocker who somehow survived the drug binges of the nineties and made it through to sobriety. Kurt Cobain and Hillel Slovak who were close to Anthony shook his world up tremendously when they died from the same addictions he was facing. For pieces of his life their deaths did help him to become sober, however he would always relapse. It was not until recent years that he has been able to stay sober, which was something he knew he had to become since their deaths. However, Scar Tissue truthfully portrays the life of a drug addict and the heartbreaking back and forth between sobriety and drug abuse for many years. Interestingly enough though is that without his turbulent life with drugs, sex, and relationships the creativity that was a large part of the Chili Peppers would have been absent. This is why Scar Tissue is so intriguing and compelling. After sampling a plethora of drugs and coming close to death many times, Anthony miraculously survived to carry on the legacy of nineties rock.  Scar Tissue: Anthony Kiedis with Larry Sloman
0803730470|5.0|When I was pregnant with my first son, I was buying xmas presents for a couple nephews and decided to buy them books.  Because of the great reviews, I bought this one for one of my nephews.  I read it before I wrapped it and fell in LOVE with it!!  I even read it to my husband afterwards because it is such a cute, clever story!!  After I gave it as a gift, I bought one for myself.  I've been reading this book regularly to my son...who is now 18 months old...and neither him nor I have grown tired of it.  I have since bought another one for a friend's baby shower and have recommended it to others.  Since buying The Gruffalo, I have bought almost all of the books by Julia Donaldson/Axel Scheffler.  Their books are sooo wonderful, I can't believe that they aren't more well known.
B000AP04L0|4.0|Gavin Pack  Although many recent college graduates dream of working in a corporate job with their own corner desk and a front row parking place, that fantasy is not always realized. Instead, many are thrown into a life of dull, repetitive work, and made to work in a cubicle with no windows. Mike Judge satirizes this mediocre life in his movie Office Space, the story of Peter Gibbons, a man so bored with his day to day routine that he finally snaps. In this parody of \\"Corporate America,\\" Judge earns laughs with witty dialogue, but also breaches a deeper meaning through his uncannily realistic view of work in a dysfunctional company. I really enjoy this movie, not only because of the comedic aspects like the extreme characters and sarcastic banter, but also because of its relevance to the modern workplace.   Generally, critics love Office Space as much as its cult followers. However, there are some movie critics that disagree. Rick Groen claims that the writer and director, Mike Judge, cannot follow through to the end of the feature length film because of his background primarily in short TV cartoons. Instead, Groen sees the film as starting off strong, but losing steam towards the end. But overwhelmingly, reviewers of the movie praise the \\"good-natured comedy about the suppressed rage and paranoia of unappreciated employees\\" (Elias). Although professional critics see the movie as cunning, witty, and uproarious, Office Space did not generate a large crowd at the theaters (Box Office Mojo), and even a smaller fan base. I like to think that I am a part of the cult culture surrounding the movie, much like the groups that are so fanatic about movies like Fight Club or Donnie Darko.     The issues brought up in Office Space still apply to many people, even though there is a relatively small fan base. Contrary to the movie Clockwatchers, in which jokes about an office environment quickly go away, \\"revealing a surprising, almost surreal core of unhappiness and mistrust amongits central characters,\\" all of the serious issues brought up in Office Space are hidden subtly behind parody and satire (Davis). Of course, most Americans' lives are not quite as dull as Peter Gibbon's, since the movie Office Space is a parody of corporate culture in America. Not only does Peter Gibbons have a dull and repetitive job--updating bank software for \\"the 2000 switch\\"--but he is also stuck in a cubicle, depriving him of all natural light. Just to the other side of his cubicle wall is a huge window, with a great view of a tree and some rolling hills. In one scene, after Peter snaps, he unscrews the outside wall of the cubicle and knocks it down, letting all the papers and memos fall everywhere. Aside from his cramped and unnatural workplace, Peter is under several middle-management level executives who all seem to have overlapping responsibilities. Each one stops by to remind Peter that he failed to put a cover sheet on his TPS report. The vice president of the company where Peter works, Initech, is Bill Lumbergh, represents the stereotype of corporate bosses and the antagonist of the movie. Lumbergh repeatedly asks his employees to come into work on Saturdays while he roams around the office aimlessly with a cup of coffee, instead of actively managing his employees.   Perhaps Office Space pokes the most fun at the way companies hire \\"efficiency consultants\\" to help with productivity, but in the process of streamlining the consultants completely halt all work. The two consultants hired by Initech in the movie are known as \\"The Bobs\\" and meet Peter after his snap. In this sudden change, Peter takes on an attitude of complete apathy after his therapist suffers a heart attack in the midst of hypnotization, leaving Peter in an unrealistic state of deep relaxation. Ironically, The Bobs are completely taken with Peter, even after he openly admits that he really \\"does nothing\\" all day. Other employees in the company do much more work, like Peter's friends Michael and Samir, but they are fired for reasons clear only to the consultants. Instead of keeping workers that are efficient, The Bobs keep Peter, who is disrespectful to his boss and plays Tetris all day.  These kinds of consultants are a parody of the type of corporate planning and strategizing that became so popular in the 1990s. Lumbergh, the VP of Initech, is also seen in front of a whiteboard reading \\"Planning to Plan,\\" another stab at new ideas and attempts to streamline corporate offices that really defeat their own purpose.    One of the most praised aspects of the movie is its larger than life characters. Because of his background in animation, Mike Judge exaggerates the characters' personalities so that \\"every personality trait is magnified\\" (Ebert). Characters like Bill Lumbergh, written to be the stereotype of a corporate boss in the 1990s, wears \\"gold-rimmed aviator glasses, a ski-resort tan and a contrasting-collar dress shirt,\\" and Tom, a 50ish functionary who lives in constant -- and justified -- terror of being downsized,\\" are played out to the extreme by the actors. Peter's two friends, Michael Bolton, who resents the famous singer with his same name, and Samir Nagheenanajar, whose last name no one can pronounce, both dislike their jobs, but appreciate the security. After they are both fired, they take out their anger at the company by taking their misbehaving copy machine to an empty field and destroy it with baseball bats. The most animated character and my personal favorite is Milton, an employee who was \\"let go\\" years ago, but through a glitch in the payroll continues to be paid every week. Instead of deciding to take on a lifestyle of apathy, like Peter, Milton combats the stresses of corporate life by being overly protective of his possessions, especially his stapler.    Not only does the movie Office Space poke fun at corporate businesses, but it also satirizes the mediocre lives of the people that work in those jobs. Mike Judge expresses theimpatience of many Americans through his subtle and witty humor in a satire about life in Corporate America. Everyone who has worked in an office can pick out at least a few foibles from some of the extreme characters that remind them of past or present coworkers. The issues brought up comically in the movie resonate with its audience long after the final credits.      [...]
B0016Q2D5M|5.0|No, this version of Journey to the Center of the Earth doesn't stick to Mr. Vernes story-and no, I'm not a huge fan of 3d. Just the same, I really enjoyed this movie, it is action packed and fun.  What's more-it's clean!  The closest thing to a bad word in this movie was the \\"Chist\\" joke-as in the rock. A movie for the FAMILY.  Get the kids and don't forget the popcorn.
B0009UC7QQ|5.0|The first time I saw The Truman Show, I was hooked. The movie is highly critical of the media and of how reality is manipulated to entertain the largest group of people. I have always been critical of the way television shows always claim to distribute \\"reality\\" to the public, and The Truman Show exemplifies many of the reasons reality television is so highly criticized. Truman, played by Jim Carrey, is an engaging character whose life is displayed on camera for the world to watch. He is surrounded by actors hired to interact with him and inspire the emotion that makes Truman so interesting to watch. The emotions and actions of the actors aren't real, so though they are believable, Truman's emotions and actions cannot be real either. Truman is floating in a naïve sense of truth. This movie illustrates how though we may believe that what the Television is flashing before us is reality, there is a truth much different from what is displayed on the screen; and we should be critical enough to see the real truth for ourselves.     Truman Burbank is the focus of a television show that began with his birth and subsequent adoption by the TV studio. Every aspect of his life is on camera, and there are thousands of cameras that follow every action from various vantage points. While he is growing up, going to school, and getting married, he is being watched. He is watched as he leaves his actor/wife to go to work in the morning, and watched as his actor/best friend hang out with a six-pack of beers. It all seems so quaint and real but the truth is that his life is a sham.  His wife isn't real, she doesn't even like him, which he finds out by examining their wedding photos and finding that her fingers are crossed during their wedding kiss. His best friend Marlon isn't real; instead of being a true friend Marlon is used to manipulate Truman into certain frames of thought. He takes advantage of outings to hit some golf balls  to convince Truman to stay put on his island instead of going to Fiji for a vacation.    Not only are the characters used to influence Truman's sense of reality, but the media in his world as well. The  radio station creates a convenient explanation for the equipment which falls from the sky right as Truman is walking to his car in the morning. According to the announcer, a plane accidentally lost equipment that morning, causing the invasion into Truman's world. Truman's \\"father,\\" who was killed off the show in a boating accident designed to make Truman terrified of the water, somehow manages to get back onto the set and disturb Truman's life. Seeing a man who is supposed to be dead alive once again is a big deal, and quite a shock, especially when random strangers appear out of nowhere and take the man away with no explanation at the time. The explanation comes from the newspaper which spins the incident into an issue of cleansing the town of homeless people and from the woman playing his mother, who claims that she \\"sees\\" Truman's father in every face on the street. Truman remains unconvinced, he knows what he saw for himself.    These events set off a chain reaction of discovery in Truman's life. He realizes that he is being followed when his radio accidentally picks up the frequency broadcasting the transmission from actor to actor. In an effort to discover some truth, Truman goes against his routine and visits the building next door to his, and sees people sitting at donut-laden tables where an elevator should be. After being dragged from the building he goes to see his wife, Meryl, at the hospital where she works. At every turn he is conveniently blocked by some obstacle or another and he cannot get into the operating room where she is performing \\"surgery.\\" He attempts to fly to Fiji but is told by the travel agent that they are booked up for a month because it is the \\"busy season.\\" When he tries to take a bus, the bus breaks down, and when he tries to drive away with Meryl, he runs into bumper to bumper traffic, a bridge over the water that terrifies him, a forest fire, and ultimately a nuclear meltdown which forces him to stop the car. When Truman tries to run, he is tackled by men in tinfoil suits and dragged back to his home.    All of these obstacles are the design of Christof, the creator, designer, and omnipotent watcher over Truman's life. He is responsible for every person Truman sees, every word they say to him, and every challenge he faces. He observes Truman from his studio in the moon and engineers heart-wrenching scenes with a frightening genius. The best example is probably the return of Truman's father, who is reunited with his son in a dramatic scene involving fog, various camera angles, and synthesized music all coming to a climax as Christof orchestrates the camera to a close-up as Truman embraces his father and sobs, \\"dad!\\" These are the scenes that drag the audiences into Truman's life, drawing on their sympathy and awe. They accept  the reality as Christof presents it to them, drawn by the intrigue to watch more. Christof lets them see what he wants them to see, his story, and the audience blindly follows along. They either don't realize or choose not to see the reality of Truman's situation. His emotions and actions are being manipulated in the exact same way as theirs are.     It's too perfect, this scene and the entirety of the show Christof creates. When a caller on a talk show claims that Christof has turned Truman into something unreal, he replies, \\"I have given Truman the chance to lead a normal life. The world, the place you live in, is the sick place.\\" I fail to see how his manipulations are any less sick than the terrible place he is protecting Truman from. His claim that he is \\"protecting\\" Truman reeks of protecting his interests as a TV show director and protecting the fan-base he has established with the show. He limits the information given to Truman and blocks his \\"star\\" from exploring the world outside his own, claiming that if Truman \\"was absolutely determined to discover the truth, there's no way we could prevent him.\\" It seems that preventing Truman from discovering the truth is his sole goal. At the height of the film, Truman's life is a battle for the truth fought between him and the force he has found working against him, though he still doesn't know who he fights.   The stage for the final battle is set on the sea that separates Truman from the rest of the world. His desire for the truth is so strong he overcomes his terror of the water and attempts to sail to freedom. Christof sends him a storm complete with thunder and lightning and gale force winds. It is incredible that this storm is the result of two conflicting ideals, the seeker of truth and the keeper of the truth. This idea goes beyond mere reality TV and broadens to all media and even the government. It is easy to correlate the huge body of the government or the body of the media with Christof, the manipulator of the information and the figure who decides who hears and knows what. Truman is the people, the ignorant populace who is at first naïve and complacent but fierce in his desire for information once the ball is rolling.    Here is where the relationship between Truman and we the populace ends. We have not yet found that drive for knowledge, the real and true knowledge. We are just like the viewers of The Truman Show. We are still absorbed in the forged reality of the story and have not yet broken through the silver lining to the bare bones of what we are seeing. Truman should be our icon for reality and his drive should be our drive. Truman knows that the world outside his dome of illusion is different and new and unexpected. He may be afraid to step outside the door but what truly matters is the journey to get to the door and the realization that there is a door in the wall.
B001ED7C58|3.0|I was somewhat disappointed in this soundtrack...I was SO looking forward to it. \\"Bella's Lullaby\\" is the biggest disappointment of all the songs. It just doesn't sound at all what it's supposed so sound like... :(    However, I thoroughly enjoyed Rob Pattinson's track...his voice is AMAZING. I love that folksy-blues sound of his voice! The lyrics are so Edward.     Also, \\"Decode\\" is great and so is \\"Flightless Bird, American Mouth\\".    Because of those three songs I'll give it 3 stars. :)
B0019T9FL6|4.0|I LOVE a lot of the songs on the CD, my Fav is \\" We gon fight\\" I love it , keep it on repeat! Jenn's Voice is CrAzY! I love the message in the song and she is singing her heart & feelings on all her songs! I also love \\"If this isn't love\\" (my song for my boo), \\"Giving myself over to you\\" Of course my other Jam \\" I'm his only woman\\" (Fantasia is my girl - another great talent) I have been a fan since AI Auditions!!!! I was very upset when she was in the bottom three but I have to admit, after all that, I am NOW glad since her BIGGER DREAMS have come true! I love Jenn's Voice and she is a great talent that stands out from the rest! I am so very sad she has to be on top of the world one day and then the worst nightmare happens to her the next day. I feel from her songs and the way she carries herself she is strong and will be ok in the future. I can imagine how hard life will be to deal with the pain but I hope she will take her time and be fine and contiune to keep pushing foward as her family would want her too.
B001GAOY5U|1.0|I was looking forward to this release on blu-ray 3D but after seeing it on my plasma I was extremely let down. I saw the movie at the theatre with my son and of course we were blown away. Although watching the blu-ray version in 3D the effects were great but the color was just awful. I'm not sure if it was the glasses or just the transfer in 3D. The color was just way off no matter how many adjustments I made to my TV. After watching five minutes of the 3D version I had to stop the movie and restart it in 2D for a better viewing.     Bottom line. The movie was enjoyable but the 3D color was just plain terrible.
192076920X|5.0|ive read alot of books , this is hands down in the top two , just overall the best, hard to explain , it's about everything
B0009I7NNA|5.0|this was my intro to A7X.  I bought the album after hearing Bat Country, which I was catchy and interesting in a very bland time for new music.  Beast and the Harlot is probably the best song on this album.  It just rocks, Gates' guitar playing is awesome.  Gates is going to go down as one of the greatest players of all time.  The Rev's drum playing is strong, the true backbone of the band.  Shadow's singing ability has come so far since Sounding the Seventh Trumpet.  This album was so good that I bought the self titled Cd the day it came out without hearing a song.  Then I bought the other Sounding and Waking.
B000ZK4466|2.0|Ok, Ill admit it, The Mars Volta has completely derailed from a compositional standpoint. While they used to utilize all the spastic, ambitious qualities in the past to accomplish musical feats, all they seem to know now is how to flounder in excessive prog-bloat leeway, perhaps putting together one song that actually comes together as a whole when Rodriguez-Lopez's fragmented choppiness and Bixler-Zavala's increasingly annoying vocals are not battling for acknowledgement.
B000V6BE6C|5.0|This album is good all the way through.  There is not a bad song on the album.  A lot of people are mad cause Shadows doesn't scream anymore, but how many screaming songs could one band make.  If they stayed screaming they'd be a one or two album band.  The growth of this band musically and lyrically is amazing, with every album they get better. The guitar playing is awesome, the drums are thunderous, and the whole package is great. I can't wait for the next one.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|The movie came very quickly and was in perfect condition. I would definitley buy another product from this seller!
B001DMJ9R4|5.0|The cd is good, with the new songs.  They are a different sound then the other albums.  The DVD is awesome.  A7X sounds awsome live.  Makes me want to go see them live next time they are in town.
0439023483|5.0|I won't explain this book, but it you liked Twilight, read this book. It's addictive, I finished it in a day. Can't wait for the next one!!!
B000063147|4.0|A lot of screaming.  Musically awsome.  Guitars and drums make this band.  It is good, but I don't think it is there best work.  If you like great guitar playing it is a good album.  If you don't like bands that scream this is not for you.  It is good to listen to Sounding the Seventh Trumpet just to see how far the band has come.
B000OYCN98|5.0|Hawkwind's best ! From the wonderful era when Lemmy ,Nik Turner,Simon King,etc. were still in the band before Brock started firing everybody. Great for headphone listening or with the surround sound ! Highly recommended .
B000OVLBHG|1.0|The polar opposite of the book in so many ways - from the political themes to the weapons and combat.<br /><br />The combat scenes are a terrible joke.  I'd like to think that if we can transport troops to other planets, we could arm them with something better than 1970's vintage 5.56 rifle.  And, maybe arrange for a few mortars or artillery.  Oh yeah, day one of Infantry School - DON'T BUNCH UP!  An LA street gang would use better tactics.<br /><br />Just an awful movie based on one of the greatest military sci-fi books ever written.

B001F12J3Y|1.0|My fiance and I both loved this movie when it was released and we still do. When we heard it was coming out on Blu Ray and on top of that 3-D we were beyond excited. Well that excitment was crushed when we got home, put it on and were almost given instant headaches from the old school red and blue 3-d glasses and the fact that no matter how hard we tried to see it, it just was nowhere near 3-d quality. We sat there contemplating whether or not it was just us or if the 3-d aspect of it sucked that bad and we came to the conclusion that it was definately the latter. So after a half hour of trying hard to like it we switched it to 2-d (thank god for blu ray for having that option) and saw how in 1080p it was almost 3-d itself.<br />Needless to say the very next day I went back to the store I purchased it from and changed it for the regular blu ray version (which was $5 cheaper than the 3-d version and totally worth the purchase, 5 stars for that version.) It was very sad that it did not work out because such an amazing holiday movie with such great animation would be a no brainer to have as 3-d but unfortunately it just is not worth the headache and strain.
B000UNYJXQ|1.0|Filled with many well produced exaggerations designed to make a point and not necessary the truth of the situation.  While healthcare needs reform in the US, pointing to healthcare systems in other countries where their citizens come to the US for care if they can afford the cost is ridiculous.  Anyone that's followed Michael Moore's work has learned to expect a certain amount of exaggeration in his films, but Sicko sets a new high bar for him.  Net-Net: entertaining fiction presented as truth.
0061120073|5.0|The title of the book that am reading is A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Bettie Smith. The main topic of this book as it states in the foreword.\\"The best anyone can say is that it is a story about what it means to be human.\\" Represents that the novel about a little girl named Francie and her little brother named Neeley that wasn't just about how they pulled through in a poor neighborhood. It was about the real life struggles families have to go through.    A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a novel. The author of this novel was born on December 15, 1896 with the name of Elisabeth Wehner. She married young with a law student from the university of Michigan. She then had 2 daughters named, Nancy and Mary. She wanted to finish her schooling but she didn't finish high school. Although she was able to take classes and she was focusing in journalism, literature, and drama. The foreward states that the novel isn't just a book about \\"social issues\\" nor \\"class struggles\\". Its a novel when you read it you recognize yourself.    The main topic on this novel is that Nolan family of 4. Living in Willamsburg, Brooklyn. Trying to make ends meet with the father, Johnny Nolan, being the head of the family. Working as a singing waiter, And drinking his tips away. The Nolan family were very poor. they bought penny worth stale food.    This work addresses to many audiences, but i think the problem relates to a particular audience which is the ungrateful audience. The type of audience that have enough and wanting more.    At first the book confused me a little. The reason for this because the way the story was written in which i liked. But it started with Francie and how her life was. Then the next chapter it was about Francie's meeting. i got that part but the part where it was a chin scratcher was when the part where Mary and Sissy came in. Until I read on and understood that Sissy was Katie's sister, and Mary was her mother.    The book in general is great. But the part that I loved. Was the part where Francie went up to the fire escape and started to read on a Saturday. I like this part because it made me understand the difference between kids from then and now.    I completely concur with previous reviews. In which they state \\"A profoundly moving novel, and an honest and true one. It cuts right to the heart of life...\\" I recommend this book for all audiences to read.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|[...]It totally sucked me in and I ended up watching the whole thing! Of course, since youtube isn't exactly the preferred way of viewing films, I had to get the DVD. I'm a total diehard Pride and Prejudice fan (the BBC version, obviously), and I must say that this is a serious rival for my affections. It's a little darker and more somber than P&P, but is equally well-done. The cinematography is beautiful, artistic and effective and really conveyed that period in time, while the score perfectly captures the mood of the piece. And of course, it goes without saying that all the acting is superb. They really chose the right people to play each and every character. Without knowing anything about this piece, I found the storyline to be completely compelling and engaging, with humor, tragedy and drama taking place in an uncertain and exciting time in British history. I'm not going to give any of the story away, so you'll just have to see for yourself! BBC does it again. Just wish they gave it more exposure-it's definitely worthy of it! Wonderful film.
B000BTGY1O|5.0|It's the classic opening scene of a timeless romantic comedy that many would recognize, Audrey Hepburn gets out of a big yellow taxi cab, while Henry Mancini's Moon River plays in the background, in a long elegant black evening gown with her diamond tiara, fabulously large pearl necklace and elbow length black gloves, she walks to the Tiffany's store window to look at the gorgeous jewelry and chandeliers all while enjoying a croissant and a cup of coffee then heading home after a night on the town.  In the film Breakfast at Tiffany's, Audrey Hepburn plays the strong-willed and glamorous female lead, Holly Golightly, who easily captivates viewers through her charming wittiness and saddening desperation.  For Holly Golightly Tiffany's represents the high expectations that she has set for her life, \\"I don't want to own anything until I find a place where me and things go together. I'm not sure where that is but I know what it is like. It's like Tiffany's.'  `Tiffany's? You mean the jewelry store.'   `That's right. I'm just CRAZY about Tiffany's!' (Breakfast at Tiffany's).   Next we meet the nonchalant and attractive Paul Varjac (who Holly calls Fred because of his resemblance to her brother), a struggling writer who is Holly's new neighbor.  From their conversation we quickly learn that they have something in common, they both take money from wealthy admirers.  Ms. Golightly is a very social woman who goes out with many rich men and uses her looks and charming personality to get money from them, whether it be through them giving her fifty dollars for the powder room, or going to visit an ex-mobster in Sing Sing prison and delivering the \\"weather report\\" to his lawyer.  She always knows when a rich man is present and is ready to seduce him, \\"that's Robert Trawler, he just happens to be the ninth richest man under fifty in America...I keep track of these things\\" (Breakfast at Tiffany's).   Paul, on the other hand, is having an affair with a very affluent married woman whom he met in Rome and she is paying for his apartment and its decorations and giving him an allowance to live off of.  The intriguing aspect of this shared lifestyle is that they actually acknowledge their need to use lovers \\"Holly: Fred, darling...I'd marry you for your money in a minute, would you marry me for my money? Paul: In a minute.  Holly: I guess its lucky neither of us is rich, huh?\\" (Breakfast at Tiffany's).  Ultimately Paul's feelings for Holly move from friendship to love causing him to end his affair, but Holly has her heart set on marrying Jose, a suave, wealthy South American. This leaves the viewers rooting for Paul and yearning for Holly to just give into the feelings for him that we all know she has.   Perhaps one of the most original scenes in the movie is the party scene, in which Holly throws a party in her apartment that gets extremely out of control.  The people who attend this party are swanky and chic and come across as carefree and looking for a good time.  The party quickly becomes extremely crowded and turns into an amusing drunken circus, occurrences range from hats accidentally getting set on fire to women literally hanging on men.  The police are called to break up the party however both of our main characters escape any consequences.    At first Holly comes across as very simple but we later find that she has a great deal of depth.  She is not just a swanky socialite with an easy life, she has had a rough past, involving being orphaned at an early age leaving her to fend for herself and her younger which causes her to marry a rural doctor, who is much older than her, that she does not love romantically.  Another character that deserves some analysis is Mr. Yunioshi, the buck-toothed simple-minded Asian man who lives upstairs.  \\"The inclusion of the stereotyped Asian character of Mr. Yunioshi (played by Mickey Rooney) borders on offensive. Mr. Yunioshi's sole purpose is to provide cheap comic relief, but, what might have been funny in 1961 has long since lost its humorous edge. The character's presence is a double blow to the Asian community - not only is he fatuous and uncomplimentary, but he is played by a Caucasian actor in heavy makeup\\" (Berardinelli).   This is one of my all time favorite movies because it is the sort of movie that you can watch when you are having a terrible day and are in need of an emotional boost or when you are in a great mood and simply want to laugh and continue your cheerful mood.  Perhaps this makes me a little bias but I believe there is no doubt that this is a captivating film, which successfully remains simple while still having strong underlying meanings and has very intriguing characters.
B0001GMIOE|5.0|Like others have mentioned, the Canon branded BP511A seems to last longer than the off brands even though capacity is supposed to be equivalent. I have given up on the knock offs priced $20 cheaper because after a few months of usage they don't seem to hold a charge as long whereas the Canon batteries keep going for years. The Canon batteries will still be able to take 500 or more pictures on a charge even after a few years. None of my knock off batteries can do this.
B001152TL6|5.0|There are those cinema experiences that will always stay with you for various reasons that sometimes even have little to do with the movie you saw, as I will always remember seeing \\"From Dusk till Dawn\\", at the midnight hour, not just because I loved the movie, but more so, that during that night in the next few hours the relationship with a girlfriend was initiated. Sometimes a movie is stuck in your memory, because you were deeply moved by it because you totally identified with one or several characters, while another movie you will never forget, because you had such high expectations and eventually so few of them you felt were met.     Seeing Lost Highway in the cinema for the first time was such an unforgettable experience but not for any of the reasons mentioned above. From the opening scene that showed me Fred's face lit by inhaling cigarette, I knew I was about to go on a journey that I had never before undertaken as a viewer, as it turned out to be a journey through a landscape, that never before was seen in any movie in this way, the landscape of the subconscious, in this case the subconscious of the character Fred Madison. Never before or since an exploration of this realm was undertaken in such a brilliant way and shows it as reality. Let's be honest, we all know how much our behavior, thoughts and feelings are determined and directed by it, so it's really quite astonishing, that this journey has been made so rarely.    It's not my intention to analyze the movie scene by scene, however great the temptation as I could talk about every scene for about an hour, but that's not the point. Everybody should get lost in their own fashion on this highway, which the movie travels and which proves to be so fateful for Fred Madison. I'd like to help the viewer along just a bit though and so there are two aspects I'd like to expand upon: `Moebius strip' and `Psychogenic Fugue'.    As is shown in a famous Escher painting a Moebius strip is a strip of paper of which both ends are tied together in a circle, which is however twisted in the middle, causing both in- and outside of the surface to be identical. This relates to the structure of the movie, where conscious-subconscious, fantasy-reality, have become entangled to such a degree that they have merged to the point of indistinction. It also is a structure that has no end and no beginning, only determined by identical starting and end point before a new loop is initiated.    Naturally there are multiple interpretations possible concerning this movie, but what is certain is that the medical condition, named by Lynch himself in relation to this movie, which plays a crucial part is \\"psychogenic fugue\\". This medical term refers to a state of mind in which the person suffering from it deals with a traumatic experience, let's say the violent death of a wife by their hand, by creating a construct for itself, a different personality with a different history and a different life trying to suppress reality.    It should be obvious that a combination of these two aspects applied to one character would signify a highly confusing life with no hope of escaping the vicious circle, as the personas the character adopts every time (the start of each loop) cannot prevent that in the end reality always determines the outcome with only the one escape to the next persona, as we can see at the end of the movie when Pete (Fred's alternate persona) has become Fred again and is being chased by the police, reality seeping in, starts to 'morph' again and this way initiates the start of a new 'loop'. Ultimate hell I'd say.    In Fred's 'fugue' existence Pete is the ideal made flesh for a man like Fred, who no longer wants to suffer from impotence caused by suspicions of infidelity on his wife's part. Pete doesn't have a wife, but dumps his girlfriend in favor of a mistress, femme fatale Alice, 'stolen' from underworld figure Mr. Eddie, known by Pete as a regular of the garage where he works as a mechanic. AsPete, Fred seems to have a firm grip on the reigns of his life, but that's only on the surface. Pete, as it turns out, is being completely manipulated by Alice and Mr. Eddie, Dick Laurent in Fred's reality who he suspected of the affair with his wife Renee, the blond version of Alice, is now the victim and threatening potential doom on Pete's and Alice's relationship and just as present between them as Laurent was in Fred's mind in his relationship with Renee. The only one not fooled by Fred's game with fantasy and reality is the so-called 'Mystery Man', a unique performance by Robert Blake, who, as a kind of Mephistopheles knows all about Fred's dark impulses, symbolically recording all his actions on video (also a comment about the relationship between the artist and his art, but that's a different discussion). As in the Faust legend of old he only goes where he's invited and he embodies the inescapability of Fred's doomed fate, the nexus where fantasy and reality touch. It's no coincidence that the metamorphosis from one persona into the next takes place in his cabin.    I do consider 'Lost Highway' to be the, hopefully temporary, pinnacle in Lynch' work and those that are willing to travel along this road of mystery, violence and sensuality, I wish them a similar spellbound experience that I have had so many times on this road to perdition.
0375826726|5.0|After reading the book, you can clearly tell that this author has come a long way in improving the tale.  After a choppy Eragon and a slow Eldest I wasn't sure I wanted to commit to finishing the series.  Brisingr was a pleasant surprise.  It kept me hooked, but there really was not that much in the way of action (I'm referring to epic battles and the like.)  Paolini used the revelation of secrets and plot instead of sword play to keep the tale moving and it worked.  I highly recommend the book.
031606792X|1.0|I've read the entire series and I found the books unfit for children.  The author attempts to make this a teenage love story but it isn't.  The female character is 17; the main male character was turned at 17 and has been around for another several decades. (This is clearly an adult having sexual relationship with a teenage.  Then theirs the imprinting of the teenage wolves on small girls. This series has strong pedophile undercurrents.  I don't recommend this book for tweens or teens.
B000YENUI6|5.0|Horror legend David Cronenberg (Rabid, Scanners, The Brood, Videodrome, etc.) teams up once more w/ A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE star Viggo Mortensen (The Lord Of The Rings trilogy, A Perfect Murder) to create the dark, underworld masterpiece, EASTERN PROMISES. Mortensen plays Nikolai, a russian mobster w/ a lifetime's worth of lethal experience to go along w/ his body full of prison tattoos. Nikolai is a seemingly ice-cold killer without conscience. Or is he? Midwife, Anna (Naomi Watts from The Ring 1 and 2, King Kong) is plunged into the russian-mafia world after a young mother dies, leaving behind a newborn daughter and a mysterious diary. PROMISES is packed w/ tension, horrific revelations, and a cast of iron-clad characters, including Vincent Cassel as the drunken, very dangerous Kirill, and Armin Mueller-Stahl as the quietly menacing Semyon. Even the minor characters are well-written. Don't miss this one!...
B0011ZNAIC|4.0|This is one wise-cracking bee.  If you like Seinfeld, you'll like this movie.  My 4 year old also enjoyed it as well.  The ending seemed a bit rushed and thus only 4 stars.
0385340990|4.0|I LOVED this book! :)  It was such a sweet little book and with my family from the area it was so great to return there via prose.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like about it was that it ended too quickly and too abruptly.  Other than that, PERFECTION! :)
B00000G3AZ|3.0|If you are fond of this kind of film you should like it. It's a cute little romance. Not serious but very light hearted and somewhat comical. I probably would have given it 4 or 5 stars if the cinematography and directing had been better. I also think the casting was a little blah, with the exception of Gwyneth Paltrow and Alan Cumming.   Paltrow nailed it! I'm not a huge fan of hers but she played the complicated Emma perfectly. Well meaning but trouble making, sweet but spoiled, generous but snobbish. She really made the character charming and believable. Alan Cumming was great to, but when is he not?   I defiantly recommend you give it a shot. It's not a movie you could watch over and over again, but at least once.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|I just spent the last 36 hours trying to figure out how to give this movie 6 stars. There is no word in the english language that is capable of expressing the divinity of this movie. Don't get me wrong, I was a little skeptical. I thought to myself \\" how can a movie about a robot that lives at a junkyard possibly be any good?\\" Little did I know my entire world-view was about to be blown to pieces..yet rebuilt with glowing radiance by my little robot friend from the junkyard that I like to call Wall-E. The time spent watching..no..living this movie I must proclaim the most valuable in my life, and I am having trouble motivating myself to resume life outside of this movie. I have been watching it ever since. . i swear. I have lost everything but i feel no remorse, I have gained something true, something real, something substantially better than anything i could have ever wished for. Please, don't just watch this movie, absorb it. Soak it up for all it's worth and ring yourself out into the lives of the people who have not yet seen Wall-E, and therefore have not yet lived. Dreams really do come true.
B001ED7C58|2.0|I wasn't really expecting to love this soundtrack because I heard beforehand what bands were on it and, with the the exception of Mutemath (who, by the way, has better songs than the one on this CD), I'm not really a fan of any of them.  Most of these songs are pretty generic, but at least the style of rock fits the mood.  Bottom line: the rock music isn't what bothers me.<br />What DOES bother me is Bella's Lullaby.  That is probably the most important music in the entire film and they messed it up!  It would have been my dream come true (one of them, at least) if Thomas Newman had written it.  He's written some of the best film scores of the past 20 years, including the gorgeous Little Women soundtrack.<br />In my mind, Bella's Lullaby will always be a piano version of \\"Spring\\" from the LW soundtrack.
0307455874|5.0|Barack Obama's Audacity of Hope is written in a passionate fashion but with a sound knowledge of America's history, politics, and culture.The author lays bare the true face of the contemporary American polity and dares to put forth his ideas on how to overcome the problems plaguing it. That way, he is bold and the name of the book is fully justified. It typifies the common man's psyche and hence resonates with their emotional-ethical responses to every problem ranging from family, health care,environmenta to energy issues. In a word he stands for the contemporary era yet he has one foot on the boat conservatism and another on liberalism.<br /><br />He is passionately concerned with the well being of the common man which is obvious if one considers his pedigree. But the socialistic ideas expressed in his book is simply audacious in the citadel of capitalism, the United States. Nonetheless, such an approach is to be encouraged because of his clarity and candidness.<br /><br />The American psyche and its values propounded by its founding fathers fires Obama's imagination and even in his recent victory speech in Chicago he lauded these values and endorsed his clarion call for redeeming those American values. My book 'Tracing the Eagle's Orbit' (coming from the pen of a non-Western writer for the first time) also puts forth these American ideals with perfect clarity and as a concise and first hand guide to those interested in perceiving the true face of America.<br /><br />Audacity of Hope has indeed a promise for both the contemporary and the posterity. It could provide the real stepping stones to rid the imperfections of democracy. But how does one answer the age-old question: where the flag bearers of idealism, i.e., the communists and socialists failed, could Barack Obama be sure of his views as put forth in this book?<br />Even Abraham Lincoln conceded that he could not control his political surroundings.<br /><br />Gautam Maitra<br /><br />Author of 'Tracing the Eagle's Orbit: Illuminating Insights into Major US Foreign Policies since Independence.'Major US Foreign Policies since Independence.'
B0017V7GTY|4.0|Though I can only comment on the 4 songs I've heard off of this album (in their entirity, the rest just 30 second clips), I can't believe that not one reviewer has brought up comparisons to the Replacments.  They have that same, hard working, reckless, bar sound from the 'Mats mid to late eighties stuff.  Plus, I think this guys voice sounds a lot like Paul Westerberg's (not a knock at all).  I really like what I hear and will have to check this album out.  They sound like a breath of fresh air in today's music scene.  Nothing wrong with showing who you're influenced by!
0321344758|4.0|Nowadays, most students are faced with the world of HTML and computer science at some point in their academic careers. For me, the first time was in CIS 101 in college. (Yes, there was a second time. It turns out grad school does not assume computer literacy). Although it isn't always part of the formal curriculum, usability is always an underlying theme in technology classes even if it is just a question of whether the HTML textbook is actually written in gibberish or not. Usability is also one of the few fields where anyone, even the computer illiterate, can be an expert.<br /><br />The idea behind usability is simple: Look at a given design and see how accessible it is for users. Anyone can have an opinion on usability and everyone can provide input. All it takes is a clear head and the patience to look at what works (or doesn't) and why. If you use it, you have information about its usability. To get back to the subjects of Computer Science and technology, usability has lately been applied to the world of Web design.<br /><br />Usability consultant Steve Krug lays out all of the basics about Web usability in his book Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability currently in its second edition, published in 2006 after the first edition sold nearly 100,000 copies.<br /><br />As far as titles go, there are few that offer as clear a picture of the book's content as this one. Krug's main point throughout his 185-page guide is that good Web sites don't make users think. Unlike college, Krug posits that using a conventional website should not be an intellectual exercise. It should be simple, it should be neat, and it should be self-evident. In other words, if a user cannot identify the site's purpose, and where to start on said site, just by viewing the homepage something has gone horribly wrong.<br /><br />Krug details how to fix such problems and how to avoid them with usability tests. That may sound self-serving save for the fact that Krug also explains how to conduct usability tests on the cheap without the benefit of a usability consultant such as himself.<br /><br />Written in short chapters packed with illustrations, this book is designed to be approachable and easy to read. Krug is serious about Web usability, but that in no way means his book is stodgy or dry. Examples of usability at work are littered with cartoons and the text maintains a sense of humor. My favorite chapter title (and subtitle) \\"Usability as common courtesy: Why your Web site should be a mensch\\" might offer some idea of what tone to expect from this book.<br /><br />Of course, taking a computer class to meet a core requirement in college doesn't always lead to work in the field of Web design in fact most of the time it leads to an entirely different career. But, in today's technology-driven culture, doesn't everything come back to the Internet eventually?<br /><br />It might just be working as an intern at an online magazine, or a starting position where duties include entering data into online spreadsheets, or it might just be writing your own blog on a site like WordPress or Blogger. Wherever your path leads, knowing something about Web usability and how good Web sites get that way can only help. As more and more information moves to cyberspace, with websites being created and updated all the time, it's important to be prepared by knowing how to analyze not only the information found online but also how it is presented. Don't Make Me Think is one tool that can assist Web users in that preparation.sts on the cheap without the benefit of a usability consultant such as himself.

B000007U6V|5.0|I am finding out that I like this album a whole lot than when I first bought it.  I'm a sucker for an epic song, and this album has the 22 minute title track.  I thought it was decent at first, but now I like it a lot more.  It starts out rather ominously, but then it becomes sunnier and joyful as it progresses.  It's very similar to Mike Oldfield's music, not as ethereal as Oldfield can be, but nonetheless quite tuneful and at times joyous.  I especially like Kometenmelodie 2, and the closing song Morgenspaziergang, is gorgeous and quite touching.  It's sweet electronica (if there is such a thing).  Despite my predelicition for real instruments, I find I like a lot of electronic bands like Kraftwerk, some later Devo, Walter/Wendy Carlos, and even dance music (just once in a while).  Autobahn is a real gem, one of the best examples of electronica out there.  It has a prog edge to it, and it's a lot sunnier than its reputation.
0375842209|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It is very well written and written differently than most books. The book was recommended to me by a friend and will be a book that I keep in my bookshelf.
031606792X|5.0|I don't understand why so many people don't like this book.  I loved it just as much as the first three.  It seems that some people don't like it because everything gets wrapped up nicely in the end, but I think it is a beautiful ending to the story.  I would have been upset if the series ended with loose ends.
B0015FML06|5.0|This deluxw edition CD/DVD Under a Blood Red Sky is wonderful, the show in Red Rocks is fantastic. Everybody can buy, it is very good.
B000B8IA2G|3.0|In my opinion acting and casting are not good in this sci-fi. Altough there are some interesting episodes, most of the scenes are in stereotypical settings. Outdoor scenes are sometimes illustrated with artificial paintings, which is dissapointing.
B000TERFS2|5.0|This music is great!  Steve Miller draws from so many music styles.  You can tell he really enjoys playing.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|i love this book i love the ending.  when she blank it was so detailed.  this should be a best seller of 08 and up that how great it is.
B000YABIQ6|1.0|We watched 2/3rds of the first season. All of the episodes were slow paced. Often excruciatingly slow paced. The show seems to be (really IS) mostly about smoking (mainly at work), drinking (mainly at work), and extramarital sex (mainly at work). Oh yeah - each and every character (including the children) is unhappy and behaving in a way that will lead them and those around them to greater unhappiness. Unless you are somebody who worked in this kind of environment and are looking for some nostalgia (and even then...), this show will not appeal to you.
B0016NF06O|5.0|A small-club setting and appreciative audience, a set that cooks, two laid back super cool music makers having fun, some funky blues with a generous helping of rocking traditional jazz and jive = 5 stars!    Willie's voice sounds like he's sung the blues more than a few times and, like the older Johnny Cash, sounds like a man who's been around the long block a few times and is now completely comfortable in his skin. The backing musicians add some wonderful solo and ensemble work; Wynton Marsalis rollicks and wails, and Willie's guitar work is subdued but stills grabs you.    Fun and entertaining from track 1, and I'm hoping for another pairing to maybe give us a Volume 2 next year!
B000HT3P7E|4.0|This series is really a nice one except with the fact that Barney character reminds me of Jeff from Coupling.
0440238609|5.0|I've always loved the classic fantasy works of Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, LeGuin and most recently, J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. However, my absolute favorite is His Dark Materials. Not only is it a bold interpretation of Paradise Lost, another one of my favorite reads, but it's full of completely new ideas, characters, and theories; not to mention it's coming from a completely different philosophical perspective. The idea of parallel universes was enough for me to get hooked. The Golden Compass is probably the slowest reads of the series, but it serves the purpose as being an introduction. Once you read the the Subtle Knife, you will be completely mesmerized; not to mention this series has one of the greatest and most heartbreaking endings ever in the Amber Spyglass. Pullman is a master story-teller and I will never get over the fact that he chose to use a young girl as the main hero - and is able to write her perspective brilliantly.
1421506270|5.0|This is a great installment in the Death Note series.  So far Death Note is my favorite.  I think it is very exciting and clever.  In this book, Light has passed his memory of the Death Note to someone else.  Rem, the Shigami shows herself to Misa and explains some things she has forgotten.  Misa discovers who the third Kira is and helps Light try to capture him.  I was absorbed in this edition from start to finish.  Really enjoyed it.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|I just listened to this CD for the first time on a pair of Sony MDR7506 headphones, which pretty much can handle any audio dynamics on the planet, and it sounded distorted and clipped throughout. Very disappointing, especially since the songs are so amazing.    Five stars for the music itself... a genuine return to form. Great riffs, soulful growling from James Hetfield, and mind-blowing solos from Kirk Hammett.    How frustrating that this is produced by Rick Rubin, which should equal a sonic seal of approval, based on his legendary body of work. I thought something was wrong with my headphones, but after reading other reviews on here, I realize it's recorded/mixed at an overload level.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Absolutly one of my favorite albums. I'm not going to be long-winded and in depth, music is personal and means something differant to everyone. As far as all the comparisons, almost everything is going to sound a bit like something else, but this record ( & muse in general ) has a sense of urgency that i've never really heard before. I listen to ALOT of music & nothing makes me want to start digging a bunker like muse ( a good thing ). Any way BUY IT & TAKE IT ON IT'S OWN MERIT, YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED!!!!
B0000026UV|3.0|Having seen some videos of these two in performance, I expected a lot more from the CD.  There was no reason to include vocals on this effort, or even backing instrumentation.  Atkins was a pioneering genius of the guitar and Knopfler is his equal in talent and technique.  The two of them together alone on a stage made magic, and that's all this CD needed.  Yes, there is great guitar playing to be found here, but not nearly as much as there might have been had the production not been overloaded with extraneous material.  One great guitarist can entertain a crowd all night -- two great guitarists as in sync with one another as Knopfler and Atkins were, could (and did) entertain the crowd that much more.  Don't get me wrong -- the music on here is good.  But, it confounds me why a decision was made to include singing and a back-up band, since the attraction here is these two great guitarists playing together.  Knopfler and Atkins missed an opportunity to leave us an exemplary permanent record of a one-of-a-kind musical pairing.
0307277887|5.0|What can I say about Dexter - he's a wonderful character!  Its amazing that a monster can be so likeable and so sympathetic.  I listened to the audio version and I really loved it.  The story is great and Dexter is so amazingly well developed, that you really feel like you know him.  One tiny complaint, and this is only for the audio book recording, you can hear the reader swallow and sometimes it even sounds like he's taking a sip of water.  Its kind of distracting.  He's a good reader, but the editing should have removed the swallowing sounds.
0142501123|5.0|This book is just great, entertaining, educating, fun reading and listening. It's a book about building friendship. I'll definitely buy more of her books. (I have a feeling my son will like \\"The Snail and The Whale\\" and \\"Where's My Mom?\\":) ) The only other book my son loved this much was \\"Hello! Is This Grandma?\\" by Ian Whybrow and Deborah Allwrigh but I think I love reading this one better due to the rhymes in it :)
B000007638|5.0|I bought this album when it first appeared on the shelves many years ago and played it until I eventually wore it out.  I'm a huge Beatle fan and have for the most part enjoyed most post Beatle work by the fabs individually.  McCartney's work has been sporadic and ranges from the sublime Band On The Run to the ridiculous Give My Regards to Broad Street but his disc shows you what a great rock performer he really is.  The band is second to none and may be the last incarnation that is a \\"real\\" band.  Not a lot of synthesizers and midi here just great performances by monsters of their craft.  This doesn't take away from the great band that McCartney tours with now but certainly eclipses the lounge act that he toured with in the 80's and early 90's.  There are lots of great cuts on this collection and it was nice to hear Denny Laine sing Go Now as a bonus.  Everyone knows these songs (with maybe the exception of Magneto and Titanium Man) and as always, McCartney doesn't play much with the original arrangements, instrumentation or vocals.  The album is sonically \\"of its time\\" and this may be a weak point for some listeners but I consider it to be a certificate of its authenticity.  It's hard to find and usually quite expensive but as far as live McCartney goes, I would consider it a highly recommended addition to your library.
B001CISHU4|5.0|Amon Amarth are an awesome viking/melodic death metal band. I got into them when I bought &#34;With Oden on our Side&#34; over the summer, and I instantly loved it, and I became a fan of Amon Amarth after that. I recently picked up their brand new album &#34;Twilight of the Thunder God&#34; which is their seventh official release and it's the second AA album that I proudly own thus far. This is definitely the best album that Amon Amarth has released thus far, and not to mention it's already one of my heavily favorite albums of 2008 as well, I just love it. This album is just simply a 100% all killer, no filler melodic death metal masterpiece that's brutal, vicious, and aggressively heavy yet beautifully melodic beyond words, I really don't know what else to say. It also features guest appearances by Children of Bodom guitarist Roope Latvala, LG Petrov of Entombed and the cello metal outfit Apocalyptica as well. Jens Bogren once again handles the production on this album, and he never fails at that. The musicians are definately in top form here. Johan Hegg's vocals are strong, monstrous and powerful throughout, and they definitely pack tons of heartfelt emotion on here. Johan Soderberg and Olavi Mikkonen really shine and shred on the guitars with sharp, heavy headbanging riffs and catchy melodic leads and solos. Ted Lundstrom's bass does a nice job with following and keeping up with Johan and Olavi's guitars, and Fredrik Andersson does a fantastic, solid, all around work behind the drums, and he also does an absolute killer job with his double bass kicking as well. Every song on here is just awesome and memorable, seriously, there's not even one bad song on here. The opening song &#34;Twilight of the Thunder God&#34; is an excellent, catchy, fast paced headbanger that immediately gets things pumping with fast, churning riffage, relentless double bass drumming, monstrous growls, and a great chorus, and let's not forget that awesome guitar solo by Roope Latvala. This is definately my favorite song on here and the reason I got this album. The next two tracks &#34;Free Will Sacrifice&#34; and &#34;Guardians of Asgaard&#34; are both excellent catchy and heavy mid tempo monsters that both feature awesome monstrous growling choruses while &#34;Guardians of Asgaard&#34; features a nice, beautifully soaring melodic guitar solo by Johan Soderberg, as well as guest vocals by LG Petrov. Track four &#34;Where Is Your God?&#34; picks up the fast and brutal pace again with ruthless, punishing skin pounding, aggressive riffing, and catchy striking leads that will make you hum along in sheer delight. And let's not also forget both &#34;Varyags of Miklagaard&#34; (which is very addicting and melodic, especially during the chorus) and &#34;Tattered Banners and Bloody Flags&#34; which are both great epic metal classics as well. Track nine &#34;Live for the Kill&#34; is another awesome track that has some excellent double bass drumming and riffing, and there's also another good guitar solo as well as a beautiful, melodic cello string section by Apocalyptica to boot. The tenth track and album closer &#34;Embrace of the Endless Ocean&#34; is an epic, beautifully melodic closer that features great guitar work that is just downright melodic and addicting, and a nice catchy mid tempo drum beat, and there's also a gorgeous harmony lead near the end as well. Please read on for the song ratings.<br /><br />Jeremy's song ratings:<br />1. Twilight of the Thunder God (4:08) - 5/5<br />2. Free Will Sacrifice (4:08) - 5/5<br />3. Guardians of Asgaard (4:23) - 5/5<br />4. Where Is Your God? (3:11) - 5/5<br />5. Varyags of Miklagaard (4:18) - 5/5<br />6. Tattered Banners and Bloody Flags (4:30) - 5/5<br />7. No Fear for the Setting Sun (3:52) - 5/5<br />8. The Hero (4:01) - 5/5<br />9. Live for the Kill (4:09) - 5/5<br />10. Embrace of the Endless Ocean (6:44) - 5/5<br /><br />Overall, if you're a fan of Amon Amarth, death metal, viking metal, melodic death metal, or if you just like anything that gets your head banging and adrenaline pumping like crazy, then &#34;Twilight of the Thunder God&#34; is exactly your big ticket to a true headbanging thrillride that is indeed 100% all killer, no filler. Buy this masterpiece of an album now. LONG LIVE AMON AMARTH!!!ine pumping like crazy, then &#34;Twilight of the Thunder God&#34; is exactly your big ticket to a true headbanging thrillride that is indeed 100% all killer, no filler.

B00000K0T8|5.0|I love this album.  GFK, Raekwon,etc. did good lyrical.  RZA was great production wise.  Ironman is surely a classic.
B001ESYAJY|5.0|I'm really enjoying this soundtrack. Even more than the one for Casino Royale.     A few standout tracks for me are 3, 7, 12, 18.    I don't mind that the James Bond theme shows up only a few times. I think this soundtrack has plenty of Bond style.
B001F7AP5C|3.0|This book picks up its three stars because of the depth of research its authors did in search of new dirt on Mao, but that's a more limited positive than you might think.  The book is so slanted against Mao that it's of almost no use to any reader without a deep pre-existing knowledge of Mao's life and history.    You would need that history to have a perspective on which of Chang and Halliday's accusations to take seriously, which might offer new revelations, and which should be dismissed as stretched truths or fabrications.  In this entire long book, there is nary a complimentary statement about Mao to be found.  I am perfectly willing to believe that Mao's rise and reign in China were a tragedy for the country and its people, but it's impossible to believe that a person could impact the world on the scale Mao did without some characteristics of leadership, intelligence and cunning.    Chang and Halliday would have you believe that an evil person, of no particular leadership ability, with no military skill, of average intelligence somehow schemed his way to being the leader of the most populous country on earth.  That simply doesn't add up.    If you know Mao's story well and want to know what the average anti-Mao Chinese thought of the man, this is truly a good source based on primary research.  If, however, you are looking for an objective overview of Mao's life, his rise to power, and his reign over China and its consequences, you'll have to keep looking.

B0013ND36G|3.0|This Blu Ray Disc shows at max resolution 1080i not 1080p... Warner should be fixing the error in its next release. For some reason, the output is shown at 1080p only when the pip feature is activated. The issue is not a big deal unless you have a really large TV with 1080p.
B000I2JKC4|5.0|This is simply one of THE Best Christmas Movies ever made. We watch this movie at least five times every Christmas Season. And now we can finally watch it in full HD DVD! If you want it buy it from Amazon though because it is almost impossible to find anywhere else. And if you like Christmas Comedies good for the whole family try ELF too!
B0016Q2D5M|1.0|I am rating this DVD strictly on its 3d merits (or lack thereof). I just received this movie from Amazon and I ordered it primarily because of the 3D process. Last night I opened up the glasses and put them on and, in anticipation, skimmed through a number of scenes in the 3d version and was so disappointed that I didn't even watch the movie.  The 3d effects are so bad they are unwatchable.  I thought I had a defective disc, they are so bad.  Everything is red and blue!  And that's with the glasses on! After hearing so much about how improved the new 3D process is, I expected to be impressed but not only was I not impressed, it was downright awful!  It wasn't as good as some tapes we had from the 80s with 3D glasses such as CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON and IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE!  They were at least watchable.  My wife took her 3D glasses off and admitted it looked better without them.  I scanned the 2D version and it looks terrific so I will watch that version soon but please, if you are thinking of buying this DVD for its 3D effects, DON'T!  It is amazingly inadequate!
0525478183|5.0|At the age of 9, next-door neighbors Quentin Jacobsen, a.k.a. \\"Q,\\" and Margo Roth Spiegelman discover a dead man slumped against an oak tree in a nearby park. That night, Margo comes to Q's window. They talk for a while, then she goes home.<br /><br />Years later, when they are high school seniors nearing graduation, she comes to his window again, and lures the usually unadventurous Q off on a wild night of revenge and adventure, which includes a surreptitious predawn visit to SeaWorld. After Q goes to school later that morning, he finds that Margo has disappeared, and the rest of the novel has Q and his friends tracing the clues she has left and taking off on a crazy road trip from Orlando, Florida, to New York in search of her.<br /><br />I really didn't know what to expect of this book. It's a mystery, but an entirely original, unconventional sort of mystery that explores the connections between people and the strengths and shortcomings of using imagination to understand another person. Walt Whitman's \\"Song of Myself\\" plays a big part in the story, and we also come across references to T.S. Eliot, \\"Moby Dick,\\" Emily Dickinson, and Woody Guthrie. It's funny, hilarious at times, but also has its melancholy moments. On the whole, I found this book very enjoyable, and I highly recommend it to teens and grown-ups.
B001GKJ2DO|4.0|This is one of those movies, that the critics ravaged, but the public loved.  One thing is for sure, Meryl Steep can do anything, I mean, could this role have been any different than her recent turn as Miranda Priestly?  As for Brosnan, I liked him in this, he gave his all, and get real we all figured he could not hold a tune, I mean, everybody should have one flaw, I mean, right?  Really, you cant beat the ABBA tunes in this, they are so gloriously Disco and the Greek Island local is breathtakingly beautiful.  One thing is for sure, everybody in this seemed to be having the time of their lives and that sort of thing is contagious, whether the film is Citizen Cane or not.
B000W8OM5Y|5.0|If I were to study about William Wallace, I wouldn't do it with Mel Gibson's classic \\"Braveheart\\"; I would go to the library to do it. The film is filled with historical inaccuracies, like Stirling Bridge and the Battle at York. But that's because this is based on the LEGEND of Wallace, and not history.<br /><br />But anyway, this is my second favorite film from director Mel Gibson, only behind the more recent Apocalypto. It's in the grand-scale epic tradition: it's more than three hours long, it has intense battle sequences, it has a cold and heartless villain, etc. What I love most about this film are the battle scenes. The skirmish at Wallace's home, and the chaotic confrontation at Stirling, York, and Falkirk are bloody and gory and ultimately brutal. I won't tell you how brutal the action is, but I can tell you that they are some of the greatest captured on film. Sure, \\"Gladiator\\" had some gore, too, but this one takes the cake for me.<br /><br />The acting may be a bit exaggerated in some scenes, but it sure fits in the epic genre. I don't think I can find a better actor who can play William Wallace than Gibson himself. His Scottish accent is almost perfect, and the way he encourages the Scottish to fight for their freedom is just amazing. Patrick McGoohan plays Edward the Longshanks, the king who would most love to hate. He's got the cold personality down perfectly. Sophie Marceau is enchanting as Princess Isabelle, a woman who is not really loved by her husband. Catherine McCormack as William's love, Murron, is also beautiful and lights up the screen when she's with Wallace. Angus McFayden as Robert the Bruce gives out a great performance as he starts to see why Wallace is fighting for freedom. The supporting cast (O'Hara as Stephen, Gleeson as Hamish, Cosmo as Campbell the Elder) play their parts splendidly.<br /><br />I can tolerate the movie \\"300\\" for its fantastic visuals, but not for its incredibly inaccurate history. But I tolerate \\"Braveheart\\" more because it's one film that I grew up with. Both films are about freedom, and both handle the main theme very well. But I prefer \\"Braveheart\\".<br /><br />A-I grew up with. Both films are about freedom, and both handle the main theme very well. But I prefer \\"Braveheart\\".    A-
B001ESYAJY|5.0|This is a good soundtrack.  The highlight of this soundtrack is the duet \\"Another Way To Die\\".  This is a very funky song.  I love it.  Jack White plays cool guitar riffs on this track.  He also plays drums and sings with Alicia Keys.  Alicia shows her talent playing the piano here.  Composer David Arnold provides an excellent score. He takes the listener on an emotional rollercoaster. I love the tense suspenseful sound of \\"Time To Get Out\\" and The Palio\\".  He creates a feeling of excitement and dread on the tracks  \\"Inside Man\\" and \\"DC3\\".  There are some beautiful tracks like \\"What's Keeping You Awake\\" and \\"I Never Left\\".  The piano playing is lovely on these two tracks.  The music on this soundtrack is so good.  I can't wait to see the movie.
B0010YSD7M|3.0|This movie is a good fix for a Star Gate junkie like myself. I've enjoyed Stargate SG-1 since very early on.  I didn't find this movie very compelling. The story line was good, but not that good. It was in may ways predictable. It had a few surprises.  The special effects were very good, but the storyline itself wasn't that great to me. I like Continuum much better than this movie. Do I think it is a worthwhile addition to my SG-1 collection - absolutely - they had me at the opening lines!
B000004286|4.0|What I love most about the film \\"Braveheart\\" is not only the battle scenes, but the music as well. I personally believe that this score is far grander than \\"Titanic\\" and \\"Troy\\". The musical themes are so varied and creative, that the score really shines here, though the themes do get a bit tiresome when it gets closer to the end. The Scottish bagpipes make it all the more memorable (\\"A Gift of a Thistle\\" and \\"Main Title\\") and the brass and percussion for the battle sequences give more tension (\\"The Battle of Stirling\\" and \\"Falkirk\\"). \\"The Secret Wedding\\" and \\"For the Love of a Princess\\" have the perfect romantic feel. \\"The Princess pleads for Wallace's Life\\" is lyrical and sounds very otherworldly. \\"End Credits\\" isn't really special, but the rest of the soundtrack is. Horner has done a wonderful job with Mel Gibson's \\"Braveheart\\".<br /><br />A-
B00014TJ6Q|5.0|One of the most romantic albums ever recorded.  Every song flows perfectly into the next and takes the listener on a journey of warmth, magic and romance.  The songs Dark Sweet Lady, Your Love Is Forever, Here Comes The Moon and Love Comes To Everyone are especially poignant, but the entire album is magical and filled with romance.  A sense of wistfulness and contentment permeates the album, and it is unabashedly sentimental and beautiful.  There's also a tropical element in some of the songs and a refreshing sense of gentleness, lightness of spirit and warmth in the vocals, production, lyrics and instrumentation.
B001ED7C58|2.0|Like many other fans who have left their words here- I will start out by saying that I am a diehard Twilight fan, but the music on this soundtack was entirely not what I had expected. I was looking for something more haunting, dark and suffocatingly beautiful. Paramore graces this altogether bland mash-up with the wonderful \\"Decode\\" song.     I, like all the other fans will still be lined up in 14 days to see the movie, but the Soundtrack will sit collecting dust on my shelves for the most part.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|I never imagined that someone would ever be able to translate the powerful imagery and disjointed, yet coherent storyline of vivid dreaming onto film. Well, maybe the '08 cinematic release `The Fall' didn't quite accomplish all that but it came pretty close. The visuals are spectacular containing images that resonate with archetypal energy and the music is nothing short of elegant.  The influence and evolution of director Tarsem Singh's hallucinogenic style is immediately evident and we can only hope that he has still more projects of this magnitude awaiting on the near horizon.<br /><br />While `The Fall' is first and foremost a visual, almost visceral experience, there is enough of a storyline here to provide the necessary impetus to instill life in its characters and propel them forward towards their destined goal. The utterly disarming Catinca Utaru and Lee Pace do a superior job at infusing the human element into the plot as well as supplying the audience with an all important intermittent narrative that clarifies some of the more obtuse activities taking place in the fantasy sequences.<br /><br />Be sure to bring your thinking cap when you sit down to watch this one. You'll be lost without it.
B001DTPZNY|3.0|Indiana Jones movies rise and fall on the item he's pursuing.  The Ark of the Covenant in the first movie was at once familiar; yet more powerful than I ever knew (I wasn't aware of its destructive powers before the movie).  The Holy Grail in the third movie was, and is, the \\"Holy Grail\\" of Archeology (pun intended).  But the Stones in the second movie and the Crystal Skull in this movie don't have the gravitas that the Ark and the Grail have, so as you sit and watch the movie, you end up wondering what all the fuss is about.    I'm treating this movie like the \\"Young Indiana Jones Chronicles\\" and the various Indiana Jones comic books.  It's a related story; it takes some steps to further the character's development and answers some questions (like whatever happened to Marion) but it's not canon.  And that's a shame, because the Russians make fine villains and the look and feel of the original trilogy is there.  I just curse Lucas' decision to go so far afield with the item Indy's pursuing on what will likely be his last cinematic adventure. Go to any museum or read any book of mythology and you could have come up with a much better MacGuffin.  What you picked wasn't Out Of This World, George, it was just Out There.  And Indy deserved better.

B0006Z2KXE|4.0|I just watched this again and I simply must advertise my opinion on the whole of it. It's just that it was \\"almost\\" there. The classic screwball pairings of Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant are legendary, but this one was in need of a good rewrite. If you are in a sentimental mood and you have recently viewed your entire collection of 1934-1944ish screwball comedies, then you can't go too far off of the path with this offering, but...<br /><br />Okay, so let's start at the beginning (not the beginning of the story, that would be just silly--let's start with the cast): Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn reunite to match wits in a slightly more \\"mature\\" (they are older, and it shows in that \\"Haven't we done this before, but it was more fun then, but I suppose this is nice too\\" kind of way) version of Bringing Up Baby. Perhaps between BuB and this story they did get married after all, and had different parental units, and jobs, but the rest is pretty much the same. They are both fine actors with presence and sublime comedic timing that seems so natural it is ethereal and almost aloof to the rest of us mere mortals viewing this grand spectacle unfolding. And then there is Jimmy Stewart in his early days. A true master of American cinema, this man redefines \\"the common man\\" made popular by Dickens a century past. Roland Young (Topper) is magnificent as always, so much so that it is best to view his scenes, remote in hand, again and again to scrutinize his subtle comic inflections. The rest of the cast is well suited to this film, and the undiscovered gem is the too-little used and almost ignored Ruth Hussey, whose somber portrayal (I won't give too much away) is classic and understated to the point of being that of a beautiful wall decor one almost discerns in the tapestry of the film's rich ambiance.<br /><br />But it's the lines themselves that jumble together, like egocentric starlets all vying for the prime screen time. They clash and toil angrily in ways that make George Cukor roll over in his grave, lamenting over the lost Oscar that should by all rights have been his. \\"Soylent Green is people!\\" Classic lines are easy to remember, and they really sell a film, but you can't just shove a bunch of them (like carrots, all bound together) in front of a camera and expect people to think to themselves that this is Shakespearean (...and don't I know this! But that is not the point!).<br /><br />Watch it over wine, with a fire in the hearth, on a dark, stormy night with your spouse (someone who is already contractually obligated to stay once the movie is over). It has its flaws, but it is still charming in the ways that \\"the 50's\\" are to this day considered an age of innocence when compared to the decades that followed. But if you are trying to impress a date, go with Bringing Up Baby (if they are they type who love absurdity and live to laugh), or His Girl Friday (1940), if they are the cerebral type who thrive upon the sparring jab of wit so quick it has lashed and gone should you inadvertently turn your head untimely.<br /><br />Ownable in deed, but best reserved for those times among close friends when one is more interested in dissecting \\"fine comedy dialogue 101\\" than a good night's comedy romp and shag following.<br /><br />Thanks for reading.over in his grave, lamenting over the lost Oscar that should by all rights have been his. \\"Soylent Green is people!\\" Classic lines are easy to remember, and they really sell a film, but you can't just shove a bunch of them (like carrots, all bound together) in front of a camera and expect people to think to themselves that this is Shakespearean (...and don't I know this!

6304981635|4.0|I really enjoyed this film because it was a lot more than just a martial arts flick in which the plot was just an afterthought to surround the fighting scenes like most martial arts films then and even now.  In fact, as has been pointed out by many reviewers here the action scenes are certainly not the best fight scenes ever but that's okay as it's clear that that was never Bruce Lee's intention in the first place.  This film was more of a vehicle for Bruce to try and pass along his philosophy which is why the previously deleted scenes from the original screening which has been added here are so important.<br /><br />That's not to say that all the fight scenes were poor because that's just not true.  The scenes were pretty brief because as Bruce himself has mentioned, the real-life fights are never drawn out and lengthy as the fastest one who strikes first is almost always the winner and Bruce shows just how fast he is in his fight scenes.  His fight with Bob Wall was quick, efficient and deadly and is realistic.  Those who were expecting a Wong Fei Hong type one man against an entire village kinda flick won't get it here as that is simply not realistic as far as fight scenes go.<br /><br />The final scene with the mirrors is so apt as it reminds us of the beginning of the film where Lee's teacher explains to him how the enemy uses images to deceive and to destroy the enemy you need to destroy the images which is what we get.  So we get a better balance here of philosophy, storyline and action scenes.  This film also made Asian Kung Fu films well known and popularised them in the West and so for that reason alone this film is worthy of respect.<br /><br />This dvd has great sound quality having been given the Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround treatment and has great special features with interviews with Linda Lee his wife as well as with Bruce which gives us a glimpse of what the real person was like.  The only problem though was with the picture quality that hasn't been restored and so is not worthy of the rest of the dvd package with spots and other imperfections present on many of the frames.  Let's hope the new Blu-ray version is better and that they have cleaned up the picture quality.<br /><br />Great film, great sound and special features but perhaps you should go for the Blu-ray version if the picture quality has been restored or wait for a restored standard version to surface.<br /><br />Updated 6 June 2011:<br /><br />As Amazon will not let me review this separately I'll have to append this here: the blu-ray version of this great Bruce Lee film is certainly worth the double-dip.  The picture quality although not pristine perfect has been restored well enough to 1080p format and is a vast improvement over the dvd I reviewed above.  The sound quality is still in Dolby Digital 5.1 and so is about the same as it was on the dvd.

B001F7MSFW|4.0|I think my only problem with this movie is that it was released so close to so many Summer Movie heavy weights like Dark Knight and Iron Man. Unfortunatly I think this lead to it being overlooked by some people (can't say I blame them, a new Batman movie is always a no-brainer decision).<br /><br />This movie is very gorgeous. I know everyone else has praised it's visuals but honestly if you see the movie for ONLY one reason the special effects make it worth it.<br /><br />Also, this film is alot of fun. It wasn't as long as the first one (thankfully much more focused), and didn't seem to take itself nearly as seriously. I know some people and critics are complaining that the story is almost TOO simple and doesn't have alot of depth. I can't really count that against the film. It's a comic book film. I wasn't expecting anything deep or philisophical.<br /><br />Anyways, I really hope this film finds it's audience on DVD. A note: the third disc in this DVD set is actually just a digital copy of the film to watch on your home computer, no real extras. The second disc however has a good chunk of extras from deleted scenes to documentaries etc. Not as vast as the first movie's three disc set but a good collection none the less.
6305558167|5.0|This movie is by far the best and most well thought about the subject of King Arthur.  Though the acting may not be of Oscar-status, it is still the best in its class.  Movies today can only hope to achieve the type of status that \\"Excalibur\\" has.
B0000067L2|4.0|Cream-Disraeli Gears ***1/2<br /><br />How is it that Creams worst record contains their best songs? It must be how it is concidered such a classic despite the fact that it is ages worse than any other release from the legendary band. The sound of heroin runs deep in the veins of Disreali Gears which explains why the gears are hardly turning here.<br /><br />The acidic Psychedelic blues of the album and the band was never stronger than in the albums opening track 'Strange Brew.' The iconic track must refer to the use in which the group was bound, though very subtly. 'Sunshine Of Your Love' is the sort of groove bands are formed upon. Too bad they would never top it. 'Tales Of Brave Ulysses' and 'Swlabr' are the sort of powerful guitar rants that made Eric Clapton the guitar god he once was.<br /><br />Here and there the rest of the album satisfies but mostly fails because of the boring pace at which it proceeds. Most of the rest feels dull and uninspired by anything other then the drugs that destroyed the greatest power trio in history.<br /><br />Disraeli Gears is far from a classic album. To base the claim on the few classic songs is ignorant. Cream created and released better albums, every other one they released was better in fact. Don't base your purchases on that alone, at least give credit to the musicianship of the criminally underrated Ginger Baker.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|I have owned PS3 Trigger addons for 4 months and enjoy them a lot. They keep your fingers secure on the R2 and L2 buttons when in an intense gaming moment. The are great for games that use shooting or racing. They add precision to the buttons so you can push them in as light or hard as you want since the extra layer of plastic gives you more control. When you don't have these on it can be hard to get that precision. These things aren't flawless though, they sometimes pop off after a little frustration with the controller like after an unexpected death which send the pieces flying in the room which can make you even more mad since they are hard to find. However, they usually stay on unless you use a lot of force. I think they are worth the money since you become use to them after using them for a while and want them on your controller all the time.    I am a PS# trophy hunter and I approve of them at [...]

B000UJCALI|2.0|[[ASIN:B00005ATQJ The Shining]]<br />An ugly, hard-to-stomach horror movie, from Stanley Kubrick, whose sense of taste and feeling for his character have somewhat dulled. His source: Stephen's King's novel, was a horrifing tale, too, but King evokes a sence of concern for his characters which has totally eluded Kubrick's work here. Jack Nicholson is suitably menancing but Shelly Duvall is almost ludricrously weak.
B001IAOEXU|3.0|I bought these when they were bundled with the metal controller armor addon.  If you know what I am talking about, you know that the controller armor is completely stupid, and not even worth putting on.    The triggers however, are nice.  It is good they are finally sold seperately.  I have had them for a long time now and if you have any worries about them falling off, be assured they do not.  They do not require you to take the controller apart or anything like that, and I like how they work.    $5 well spent, especially if you play games that require the L2 and R2 buttons to constantly be depressed, such as a racing game.

1416594884|1.0|Don't buy this book if you have any respect for good literature or the good standing of the United States of America in the world.  Mr. Cornwell could have scribbled a letter-to-the editor and made the same point.  The character who becomes essential to the story and its ending never gets a full paragraph of character development throughout the overwrought, directionless plot.  There's no need for character development because we all know that as an American she is evil, treacherous, and dishonorable.  Let the Eurotrash pay money to enjoy the deus-ex-machinations of the last page.  I'm going to sell my First Edition ...In From The Cold now, as more of this from the declining Cornwell will certaily reduce its value.
0385340990|5.0|One of the ladies in my book club gave me this book to read.<br />I'm so glad that she did. I haven't read a book quite like this one<br />before.  The story was put together with letters written by many<br />different characters in the story. Once I got into the rythm of this<br />book I found it most amusing, very informative, funny and in some<br />places quite fascinating.<br /><br />I'm not a history buff and found the letters from this time period<br />interesting and horrific at the same time.  Because the letters were<br />so personal, you could actually get the feel of what they went through<br />back then in the concentration camps, as well as what everyone was<br />doing outside the camps. I wanted to share a few funny comments from<br />the book \\"Reading good books spoils you for enjoying the bad ones.\\"<br />and \\"Men are more interesting in books than in real life.\\" This is<br />just a peek into this amusing, informative story.<br /><br />I thought it was quite clever the reason the literary guild first<br />started meeting. They had curfews and very little entertainment.  I<br />don't think any of them expected this group to amount to much.  But it<br />became their haven of rest and the hope they needed to make it through<br />a pretty bleek existance.<br /><br />The main character of the book is Juliet Ashton, is a writer who wrote<br />a weekly column for the \\"Spectator\\" during the war.  Stephen and Stark<br />Publishing published all her articles and called them \\"Izzy<br />Bickerstaff Goes To War\\". It became an unexpected hit!  Now Juliet was<br />in search of her next book. It's interesting how the \\"The Guernsey<br />Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\\" began and what they talked about<br />at their meetings. The group consisted of men and women that attended<br />their meetings and everyone talked about the different books they each<br />had read that past month. You will be intrigued about the  diversity<br />of people that came to the meetings and the stories that they have to<br />tell.  I was really tickled by Juliet Ashton and her seach for the<br />topic of her next book and her editor/publisher Sidney.  Sidney and<br />Sophie are good friends that gently push Juilet to search her heart<br />and go after her next story no matter where it took her.  So Juliet<br />follows her heart, and dug up as much research she could on this<br />literary society. Again this book has things in it I just loved:<br />books, book clubs and the people that are involved with them. I<br />thought the authors, Mary Ann and Annie, did an amazing job of showing<br />me some of the history during this  time period - things that I wouldn't normally choose to read on my own. You will laugh, you will cry and you will be inspired by the unique ways this community comforted and encouraged one another during such difficult, almost impossible, times.<br /><br />I want to leave you with one of the sayings from this book that really<br />struck me - \\"That's what I love about reading: one thing will interest<br />you in a book, and that tiny thing will led you onto another book, and<br />another bit there will lead you onto a third book.

B00012QM8G|5.0|Schindler's List is a rarity in contemporary filmmaking. It delivers a heart-wrenching story with Oscar-worthy performances, while demanding a soul-examining response from the viewer. How many movies can make that claim? And while not overtly addressing religious themes, the film leaves no doubt as to the answer to that age-old question: Does evil exist?    Set against the backdrop of World War II Poland, and based on a true story, the movie follows the life of German businessman Oscar Schindler (Liam Neeson). Always the entrepreneur, Schindler hatches a plan to start a factory and outfit it with cheap, Jewish slave labor. His idea, while bankrupt in one sense, was anything but in a financial sense as he becomes quite wealthy. Along the way, however, Schindler begins to question the brutality and depravity of the German captors overseeing the prison camp. Spurred on by a silent, inner awakening, he begins a campaign to personally see to the safety of \\"his\\" Jews, those who worked in the factory for him. Aided by his loyal accountant Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), Oscar figures a way to \\"buy\\" all 1100 of the workers from the camp Commandant Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) and move them to safety. The plan ultimately is successful and the area is liberated by the Red Army soon after.    It must be noted of the cast how moving and riveting the performances are from top to bottom, but particularly that of Neeson as Oscar Schindler. His portrayal is instantly believable on all levels, as you feel personally involved in the events that transpire. Never before have I sat in such rapt attention, waiting to see where he would take me next.     One question that inevitably comes up amid any discussion of the Holocaust is that of where was God during this atrocity? How could He let so many of His people die? Among Jews in particular, the topic is especially sensitive. Some feel, such as survivor and noted author Eli Wiesel, that God abandoned the Jews, allowing the Holocaust in fact as some sort of punishment. Others though insist that God is still sovereign and that it is all part of his plan for the Jewish people.    In any event, Schindler's List is a must-see film that deals with a depressing and horrifying subject in the best way possible. Having reservations about it before I watched it, I can honestly say that I am glad I saw it and am a better person for it.

This book will stay with you, and after only a dozen pages you will be hooked and unable to put it down.
B001GJ1QQG|5.0|It is hard to comprehend that this talented artist is being overlooked in her home country.  She is a top selling artist around the world.  I prefer to buy her music over that from Britney,Fergie, Madonna or Gwen.  If you like Taylor Dayne, you will also enjoy Anastacia. This would be a great addition to any music library.
B000P12LWY|4.0|A vibrant and sensual retelling of Anglo history. Some liberties with fact are taken, but they generally serve the story well. Acting and production values are top drawer.<br /><br />This series would be a good stimulus for those who avoid historical dramas. I particularly liked the corrective portrayal (from most films) of Sir Thomas More--as much inquisitor as martyr.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|I first saw Adele when she made her appearance on Saturday Night LIve and I, literally, stopped ehat I was doing and listened to her voice with my mouth agape.  Her vocal style is absolutely flawless...and she was actually singing (not lip synching).  The next day, I bought the album 19 and was, once again, floored with the amazing tone of her voice and how all of her songs would simultaneously get stuck in my head.  I found a few live performances including a Live Video she shot for \\"Melt My Heart To Stone\\" and she was even BETTER live than on her album.      She may get compared to Amy Winehouse, but Adele has such class and control of her voice, and her songs filled with such passion and feeling, that I think that soon, Amy Winehouse will get compared to Adele...and Adele will blow her out of the water!
B000Q67876|5.0|I don't give many movies a perfect 5 but I would give this a perfect 10 if I could. If there were ever a movie that has it all, its this one. Great Story, Great actors, Great and believable plot. The dialogue is also on par with some of the best movies I have ever seen. At least on par with Gladiator, Pelican Brief and others. I've watched this movie at least a dozen times and I can't wait for Blue Ray to come out because I will buy it again.
B001F2W4Y2|5.0|I have been an AC-DC fan since about the \\"Dirty Deeds\\" era.  They are straight to the core rock and roll (as many of their songs suggest).  The sound is great.  Vocals are clear.  Music is crisp.  And Guitar is The brothers \\"Young\\"!  A well produced album!
B00005JPSM|4.0|Kate (Zeta-Jones) is one of the top chef's in one of Manhattan's most renowned restaurants.  She is known for her unbelievable unique dishes and for the flair in her cooking.      Her sister is coming to visit with her niece Zoe (Abigail Breslin).  Then the unexpected happens and Kate gets a call at the restaurant. En route to arrive that evening, her sister and niece have been in a terrible car accident.  Kate's sister is dead and Zoe is at the hospital.    Dealing with the grief of the loss of his sister, Kate throws herself more into her work.  She is now mother to Zoe.   Kate has never been good in relationships - she is not the most affable of people as all she thinks about is her kitchen and her cooking.   Both Kate and Zoe are thrown together by chance and both are dealing with their grief. Zoe needs love and understanding as she has lost her mother and Kate has no idea how to provide that, as there is little warmth between them.    Meanwhile, Kate's sous chef is about to give birth, so she is replaced by Nick (Aaron Eckhart).  Kate takes a week off as her overwhelming grief has eventually caught up with her.  Upon her return to the restaurant, she finds Nick running her kitchen.  His gregarious opera-loving manner is something that Kate is unprepared for and is quite unwelcome in her precise and well-run kitchen.  He is light-hearted, witty and completely charming and Kate is certain that Nick's M.O. is to take over her kitchen.  The war starts.    One night Kate brings Zoe to the restaurant as she has to work and cant leave Zoe at home alone. She is also beside herself, as Zoe will not eat any of the flamboyant dishes she has cooked for her.  Zoe forms a tenuous bond with Nick and soon Kate is also drawn to his charm and how well he deals with Zoe.      Nick woos Kate and soon their relationship blossoms.    NO RESERVATIONS is very well cast - each actor plays their role to perfection.  Zeta-Jones is magnificent in her role of top chef and struggling instant mother.  Young Abigail Beslin - does a remarkable job in the woebegone Zoe (she is developing into a fine young actress) and Eckhart - who is sexy a hell - is the prince charming in the story! This is a terrific and touching film for those whose attraction is food, music and love!      PS! AWESOME SOUNDTRACK AS WELL!
B000YENUI6|5.0|Quick story snapshot~Begin with a neck-slashing murder, move to a hemorrhaging pregnant girl, who dies giving birth to a living baby girl covered in her mother's blood, and focus on the midwife who innocently takes the dead mother's diary (written in Russian)in an attempt to find the deceased's identity (so as not to bury her an unknown). The diary becomes the object that drives the midwife's journey into the dark world of the London Russian mob, where she connects with a stoic, formidable mob chauffeur played by Mortensen, who is not just a driver, we learn pretty fast. Human sex slavery, murder, loyalties, and betrayals all play their part before we find out the true nature of the various characters by film's end.<br /><br />I had this film sitting around waiting to be watched. I wanted to watch it for 1. Viggo 2. Naomi (both among my fave actors) and 3. due tot he good reviews.<br /><br />However, the reviews that emphasized gore and violence and \\"nekkidness\\" made me decide to wait for a day when a dark film wouldn't drag my mood down too badly. (Yeah, I can be really affected by films, from joyful to depressing.)<br /><br />I wish I had not waited. The darkness and evil and pain is balanced to a large degree by elements of good and light and courage. It's not a movie that ends happily, but it is a movie that ends realistically and with some hope. Hope that if people take steps to make things right, some things can be made...more right, if not fully right. And that is an ending that doesn't depress me, but makes me feel great respect for people who do step out of comfort zones or take difficult jobs to make the world better. Or just to save one child.<br /><br />It's the ending that I began with when I described to my husband how greatly this movie had appealed to me (and subsequently re-watched it with him). The climactic scene at the waterfront is so beautifully done--the acting has subtleties in body language and vocal tone (especially Viggo's, and I totally understand the Oscar nomination). The visual and editing--just so powerful and humane, even in the darkness and dirt and grit and horror of what has been and what could have been.<br /><br />I cannot stress how amazing Mortensen is. His appearance has been altered by tons of hair spray and gel and clothing and tattos. He moves his body and makes little movements with his head that feel..authentic. He moves as if his secrets cloak him. His accent seems quite, quite good (but not being Russian, I can't say for 100% if it is dead-on).<br /><br />Watts, who is normally such a scene-stealer, is a good match for him, but she doesn't reach his level here. Mortensen has simply absorbed this character too deeply, and he is much more interesting, nuanced, and haunted a character than Watt's. We can't look away when Viggo's Nikolai is onscreen. We are sure he will look ths way or that, tilt his head, smile just so, and give something away to us. Marvelous.<br /><br />The supporting cast (for it's all supportive when Viggo is on) does a great job, including Vincent Cassell's father-dominated, vulnerable-meets-arrogant, repressed gay mobster son. The scene where he blows up party balloons--wow. His face is so full of pain and anxiety and uncertainty and a host of emotions as he speaks to his little girl that we can momentarily forget just how criminal and unfeeling he can be in other circumstances, and in forgetting, sympathize.<br /><br />I also found rivetting the \\"made man\\" sort of scene, when the criminal leaders come to initiate Viggo--and the tattoos tell their story.<br /><br />As I said, the last few scenes--the waterfront, the double denouement (Viggo's, Naomi's), overlaid with the voice of the dead girl reading the same lines we heard her say in the opening scenes: Wow.<br /><br />And for those who like romantic tension, there is tons here. Viggo manages to be threatening looking and aloof and then, bam, he's connecting in the subtle ways with Naomi's character. It's athrill to watch their scenes together because of the palpable attraction he gives off without being 'romance hero\\" obvious.<br /><br />I want to give a special kudo to the writer who places so much foreshadowing--in seemingly trivial acts, in phrases--from the very start that come to fruition beautifully as the film moves to its final moments.<br /><br />Cronenberg is a director who's entertained me in some films, annoyed me with others, grosssed me out with some. Now, with Eastern Promises, he finally made a movie that made me want to see it again...and a third time.<br /><br />Mirves off without being 'romance hero\\" obvious.

B000AMPZF8|5.0|For sure Muse's best album and might be one of the best albums ever made.  Album starts off very strong with New Born.. great guitar work especially if you see it live.   Next comes Bliss, very good song, even though its very simple.   Then comes the very epic song of Space Dementia, amazing!   Other highlights include Plug In Baby, Citizen Erased, Microcuts, Darkshines.   Yes every song in this album is amazing. Buy it! Listen to it! You won't be disappointed. Amazing album, my favorite!
B001F12J3Y|2.0|I was really looking forward to the 3D version of Polar Express, but am very disappointed with the quality of the 3D.  This version has very little of the color of the original HD or Blu-Ray versions, and the double or ghost images of the 3D effect are very noticeable and distracting.  The 3D effect is quite nice in some scenes but the quality of the 3D images themselves is very inferior to theatrical 3D releases.    In short, I'll keep this one for the novelty of some of the 3D scenes, but I wouldn't recommend it over the regular HD or Blu-Ray version.
0688156819|5.0|It is as if he's been writing for decades, so naturally does his peculiar grasp of the English language grace each page of this charming book. \\"The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy: and Other Stories\\" is everything you would expect a book of poems by Tim Burton to be, yet somehow not at all over-familiar but as fresh, as enchanting and memorable as to watch a film like \\"Edward Scissorhands\\" or \\"Ed Wood\\" for the first time. The gentle stories are told with an ironic and understated compassion. Some--such as the poignant tale of the titular Oyster Boy--will stay with you long after you've turned the page. His artwork is reminiscent of Edward Gorey in tone and humor but retains Burton's unmistakable stamp. The characters as illustrated are not infrequently gruesome yet also endearing and earnest. You wouldn't quite trust them off paper, yet feel compelled to treat the pages very kindly, all the same. The entire ensemble is so wrong it's come all the way back round to right again.    I let three of my friends read it, and each of them read the pitiful tales of Robot Boy, The Girl Who Turned Into A Bed or Mummy Boy with blankness at first, then a sharp if morbid curiosity, and at last a smile of incredulous bewilderment. I guess Burton is an acquired taste. I'm happy to say that I acquired him years ago on a little film called \\"Beetlejuice\\" and he's been a joyous source of illumination ever since. This book is a gem. I highly recommend it not only to his fans, but to everyone who likes to mix a little macabre in their whimsy. Or vice versa.

0307237702|1.0|There is no doubt that Barack Obama is a captivating figure, someone who now offers our planet a chance for real change. In his book The Audacity of Hope however, Obama comes across as a conformist, playing it safe on the core issues and unwilling to address the real problems: how and why the United States of Amercia is in its current predicament. Obama presents arguments for change which from an economic and finanicial standpoint are unrealistic and in the end offer no real long term solutions. I initially approached the text to find out who Obama is and what he stands for. I wanted to know what makes him human: what angers him, what dissapoints him and where his principals lay. I was also surprised by his apparent love and respect for the repubulicans and the outgoing President George W. Bush. What happened to daring leadership? The individual with the courage to speak their mind no matter the consequences? I could not express anything other than disappointment. The book was hollow and nothing more than an extended propaganda piece carefully calculated to offend no-one and appeal to everyone. I didn't find what I was looking for and rather than feel inspired for change with a figure to be proud of, I was left empty.

B001DHXT1G|5.0|For better or worse, the plot synopsis of \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" can be summed up in one sentance. David Banner searches for a cure to his disease while the US military tries to create their own super soldier from his DNA.     As a fan of Hulk comics, this was the movie I wanted to see ( as opposed to the Ang Lee version). I've watched it several times and still want to yell at the screen when the Hulk puts a beatdown on the Abomination. The Hulk looks great, the movie is short compared to most super hero movies and sticks to action as opposed to lengthy scenes of dialouge and melodrama. As much as I liked Iron Man and Dark Knight, Hulk is my personal favorite this summer.    As for the Blu Ray - this is my new Blu Ray showcase. The dialouge can be difficult to hear and the action sequences are exceptionally loud. Overall though, the movie is about action sequences and the sound mix delivers. The picture quality is amazing. The opening scene in Brazil is simply incredible. The housing and rainforest pop off the screen. The action sequence on the college campus is another eyepopper. The Blu Ray format really excells in lush, bright environments, and it does not dissapoint.    The Blu Ray is on one disc with all of the various features available during the movie. Again, this is a great way to show off some of Blu Ray's technical features, including the online BD Live features.     This is an excellent movie and is worth the extra 10 bucks for those with a Blu Ray player.
B001F0VHEM|4.0|Pink's rise to fame can be, at least partially, attributed to her witty lyrics and complete sarcastic sass.  Songs like \\"U + Ur Hand\\" and \\"Trouble\\" quickly brought smiles to my face and CDs in my player.  So, when I heard that her latest was coined as \\"her divorce album,\\" I had high hopes for more in your face realism and snarky humor, especially when the title was Funhouse.  The end result, though, was smartly not what I was expecting.    Oh, sure, there are one or two sassy songs like the terrific \\"So What\\" and the title track.  But what 90% of the CD entails is slower, more open ballads where instead of seeing Pink the kiss-off queen, we see Alecia Moore, the human who is hurting.  For example, in \\"Please Don't Leave Me,\\" Pink addresses her nothing can hurt me image with lyrics like, \\"I always say how I don't need you / But it's always gonna come right back to this / Please, don't leave me.\\"  It's moments like this that you see dents in her outward armor.      The downside to this is that the majority of the songs are of the slower-paced feel, even though some of them are really good, like \\"I Don't Believe You.\\"  But there are songs here that I don't particularly care for.  \\"Ave Mary A\\" just doesn't hit the spot, and the name, obviously a takeoff on \\"Ave Maria,\\" is eye-rollingly lame.  I also didn't care for \\"Crystal Ball\\" or \\"Glitter in the Air\\" on repeated listenings.  Even so, the majority of the tracks are fun with some verging on the best she's written.  I especially enjoyed the two song set of \\"Bad Influence\\" followed by \\"Funhouse.\\"      Of course, as expected, Pink's songs all have catchy lyrics that you find yourself singing or humming constantly.  And some melodies easily stick in my mind.  When combined, Funhouse becomes a good album for Pink that definitely showcases the fact that, while she might hide behind a shield of bravada, she's still a human underneath.
0375826726|5.0|Brisingr was amazing! Eragon and his dragon, Saphira, have just participated in a huge battle on the Burning Plains. They travel to the city of Tronjheim, deep within the Beor Mountains, and then to the far north forest of Du Weldenvarden. They fly to Feinster to take part in the siege. My favorite scene in the book was when Eragon made his sword catch on fire and it didn't burn up. The fire was bright blue. The description was amazing!  This was my favorite part because Eragon needed a sword, and he got one. Saphira is one of the most important characters in the story. She flies Eragon around and makes a huge difference in battle. She is my favorite non-human character in the book. She has many good traits that contribute to the plot of the book. This book was great and I can't wait until the next book comes out. This is a book I highly recommend to anyone who loves fantasy or needs a good dragon book to read.

I would usually read the jacket and say, \\"that's me\\" or that those are the goals for myself I wish to achieve.  I would eventually finish it, put it down and  find nothing has changed. For myself, more times than I care to count.  This is the first time I have found a book to actually work and show results.<br /><br />The book is basically about being present.  You wouldn't think that more than a few paragraphs would be needed to explain the benefits of being present and the consequences of not being present.  However, every sentence in this book provides insight and clarity I wouldn't have thought possible to convey with words.<br /><br />I find myself reading no more than a page or two at a time, reflecting on what was said, and then putting it into practice.  If you read this book like a novel, I believe it would be difficult to fully grasp what the author is saying.  My mind has become less busy, I am not as  easily distracted, I worry less about the future and negative past events no longer effect me, or at least not as much.<br /><br />This is the first time I have felt compelled to review a book because this is the first time I have had results.  I hope you give it a chance.

It had many twists and turns and you were left in suspense to how it would end until the very end.  If you're a guy who doesnt like to cry in front of ladies, then better watch this alone.

I actually really, really, really want to see 'Satan's Alley'!!! Those who've seen TT know what this is. And everyone has said it but it's true.....Robert Downey Jr.'s performance is a revelation. I never knew he could do comedy like this. \\"The scene is about emotionality\\". \\"You went full retard. You never go full retard\\". \\"Ain't no cell phones in 1969 man, I'm head to toe legit\\". Brilliant! And Tom Cruise won back a lot of people with his performance in this movie I think. The whole thing is just so no holds barred that you can't help but revel in how fun it is. If you are some oversensitive politically correct wacko, stay away. If you enjoy comedy and if you can appreciate a smart comedy masquerading as a stupid comedy, then this will have you rolling and repeating lines and then giggling about it for days afterward.
0061148512|5.0|As many other reviewers have stated, this book is filled with poetry.  When I finished reading the last line, I flipped right to the first page and re-read it.  I have only done that a few times in my life (most recently with \\"The Terror\\" by Dan Simmons).  In High School  I was required to Read \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" several times.  Never once was this book even suggested.  I have always enjoyed CITR, and have read it many times both for pleasure and requirement.  I had heard of Plath, but had no idea that she wrote such a book.  I only recently heard about it from my Mental-Floss mag.  I am so glad that I read it, a classic, a gem!
B001GKJ2FW|5.0|From the gorgeous prologue scene with Sophie singing \\"I have a dream...\\" in the skiff, to the hillarious credits with the cast breaking up while mock-performing, this is a joy of a film to watch and experience.  One of my favorites of all time.    The first time that I viewed it I found it mesmerizing... the fantastic scenery, the most beautiful water scenes that I have ever witnessed, and then the music... the music!  I ended up seeing it a half-dozen times in the theater, and never once did I not feel a flood of true joy bursting out from the spirit and beauty of this special film.
B001DDBCUK|1.0|Lets see, there's Charlotte the Vacuous Cream Puff, Carrie the Empty Dress, Miranda the Walking Bucket of Toxic Waste and Samantha the Narcissistic Black Hole.  Let's sit thru 2 hours (OUCH!!!!) of listening to them blaming other people for their misery.  The male characters were completely without personality.  The whole movie seemed to be about 1) Clothes, 2)an idiotic wedding ruined by the bride attempting to show off and ignoring the effect on her fiance, and 3) A woman with a completely toxic personality that absolutely NO ONE would love, let alone like.  I wasn't a fan of the TV show but it was a 1000 times better than this gruesome drivel.  The only funny moment was when Big called off the wedding.  There isn't a person on earth I'd recommend this too. Are there REALLY women like this in the world?  I hope I never meet any.
0439023483|1.0|This gets 0 stars because it is a rip off of Battle Royale by Koushin Takami.  Everyone's buzzing over this \\"unique\\" \\"gritty\\" compelling story that's \\"Lord of the Flies\\" meets \\"1984\\", but I would like everyone to know that this is not any new concept.  And further more you will be much more please with the ending of Battle Royale than Hunger Games, because Battle Royale's ending is the perfect ending, with a twist, that no book can beat.  Plus, Battle Royale doesn't throw in a love story just to have a love story.  Suzanne Collins throws in a  \\"teen\\" American romance that doesn't reflect real romantic pressures of teenagers.  It just does not work.  You may still enjoy this book but you will be much more satisfied reading Battle Royale by Koushin Takami
B001E7OO2I|2.0|I am one of Legends biggest fans but I have to say this album is flat and just boring. What happened to the ballads over the piano?  His piano influenced songs is what actually seperated him from the rest. This is just boring and only a couple of songs interest me. Good morning is a pretty good track stand out track.. the rest just fall flat.    BOO!!!!
B000RUYQ2Q|5.0|The first three tracks form an electrifying sequence: from the pulsating 1999 through the rocking Little Red Corvette and into the hypnotic Delirious. The disturbingly prophetic words of 1999 gives me the chills but Little Red Corvette soon cures that, and halfway through the uplifting Delirious rapture may result! This is a powerhouse song sequence, on a par with [[ASIN:B000001FKP Donna Summer's]] legendary The Midnight Shift/Queen For A Day/Now I Need You on the original vinyl of her album [[ASIN:B000001FEE Once Upon a Time]].<br /><br />Because of such gems, one tends to overlook the fact that tracks like Let's Pretend We're Married and DMSR are brilliant too. Automatic is a long atmospheric piece with lovely female vocal and an impressive instrumental ending. Free is compelling in the interplay between Prince's falsetto and the backing vocals, another song loaded with meaning: \\"Be glad that U are free, free to change your mind/Free to go most anywhere anytime/Be glad that U are free, there's many a man who's not/So don't sleep until your guilty, cause sinners all are we/There are others doin' far worse than us/So be glad that you are free.\\" It's pure gospel, and a rousing number too.<br /><br />Prince's music is such a seamless blend of so many styles, that it's hard to single out particular influences. But to me, on this album he's like a more urgent and full-bodied [[ASIN:B000002ISH Chic]]! There's that same elegant tension in the beat, but Prince has eschewed Chic's minimalism for the full power of Rock and R&B. This is very noticeable on the bouncy Lady Cab Driver, but elsewhere too. Putting styles aside, 1999 is spectacular by any measure. The melodies, arrangements, lyrics, the playing and his voice all are superb, and the mix sets new standards in sonic perfection. I lost track of Prince's career the last decade but listening to this album again was pure joy.
1416500286|1.0|After reading Emma by Jane Austin I am very much considering not reading another book by Jane Austen.      I was very dissapoited with the book.  I am new to readint \\"the classics\\" and after looking at several \\"classic\\" reading lists found this book to be on several.  I decided to read the book and even completed it against my better judgement.  I found the book extremely boring and would not recomend it to anyone outside of maybe teenage girls.

B0018CWEYY|5.0|Lost is part `ER', part `X Files', part `Star Trek', part `Twin Peaks', part `Gilligan's Island', a whole big bit of `Survivor' and yet remains totally unique in every conceivable way. Lost is something to look forward to. It really has become a part of our lives.<br /><br />In many ways the best way to enjoy Lost is to avoid learning anything about it and just watch it with others who know nothing about it and guess what is going on. For this reason just buy it and prepare to watch a whole season in the span of a few days and then sulk in disappointed over how you have to wait another year to watch the next season, skipping TV, because you know watching a season with every episode back to back is the best way to experience the best that television has to offer.<br /><br />The logistics are simple. A plane travelling from Sydney to LA has veered 1000km off course and smashed into an island strewing the passengers everywhere who soon learn from a co-pilot that their rescuers are looking for them in the wrong place. When the co-pilot is hurled into the air and eaten alive by an invisible beast who stalks the island the audience comes to realize that the island is no ordinary island, and so do the survivors who set about establishing themselves and facing various challenges that befall them.<br /><br />What do the people on the ship want? Why is there a time delay? What does the island want? What is the `Dharma initiative'? Why are there alternative dimensions? What strange connection does Locke have with the island? Who is Jacob? Is this all an experiment? What is it about the cabin? These are the kind of questions that can come up in a single episode of Lost... however the catch is that you have to wait quite awhile for anything to get answered and the good news is that Lost Season 4, goes further than any of other seasons in answering questions and even appears to have resolutions for some of the characters. It has lots of surprises in store.<br /><br />Season 1 was about the island. Season 2 was about the hatch. Season 3 was about `the others'. Season 4 is about escaping the island.<br /><br />Season 4 is essentially one big get away from island with lots of action and lots of mayhem. It may even be the weirdest most mystical season yet with lots in the way of oddness, some of it revealed for what it is. While a whole new set of characters are introduced a lot are killed in this season and there are hardly any flashbacks but lots of flash forwards. Many of the characters even switch places and the difference between good and bad begins blurs a lot. It is welcoming to see the background stories and character build-ups reduced to this level. It is very progressive now and all forward, direct and more confident.<br /><br />The main questions are still there though. Who do you side with and why? Who do you hope makes it and who do you secretly hope doesn't? Who makes it off the island and who doesn't? Characters we even thought where gone may even show up again.  While the writers of this show are layering thick on the drama to near melting point they really upped the ante on the action and fight sequences.<br /><br />The ethnic variations of actors and actresses gives Lost a worldwide appeal, and deservingly so, as who can say that they don't enjoy the suspense and mystery it has to offer. Lost 4 is simply one of the best seasons yet. It is a little different from previous seasons because it accelerates very quickly and the tension surpasses maybe all the other season put together. For the neigh-sayers, Lost 4 proves why Lost is simply the greatest TV show that this planet has to offer. The competition has had their hats handed to them. We will hibernate now until Season 5.<br /><br />Pros<br />Lost goes progressive.

0930289234|5.0|Reading Alan Moore's WATCHMEN has long been on my to-do list, but with the new movie coming out in a few months, I decided to finally get the book and educate myself on what is often called the greatest graphic novel ever.<br /><br />The book takes place in an alternate reality in which masked crimefighters were a reality.  The costumed heroes first appeared in the 1940s and a second generation showed up in the '60s.  None of the heroes had \\"powers\\".  That is, until Dr. Manhattan, a scientist transformed by radiation into a super-being, able to control atoms at will.<br /><br />The story takes place in 1985.  The Cold War is still casting its shadow over everyday life.  With the aid of Dr. Manhattan the U.S. was able to win the conflict in Vietnam and Richard Nixon was able to extend his Presidency into the mid-1980s.  Masked vigilantism has been outlawed by the government and the former crimefighters have adjusted to normal lives.  But global events keep the people uneasy.<br /><br />WATCHMEN is a mystery story.  An ex-hero is murdered, but why?  And by whom?  As one crimefighter tries to find the answers, the plot thickens and a conspiracy unfolds.  The story is presented in twelve chapters, each one bringing the world closer and closer to doomsday.<br /><br />WATCHMEN is acclaimed for its complex character psychologies and its philosophical undertones.  In fact, I first learned about this book from another book, SUPERHEROES AND PHILOSOPHY.  In WATCHMEN, we see how the world might react to costumed vigilantes and we get to see how such heroes think.  Why do they choose that life?  What motivates them?  How do they see the world and what would they do to save it?  Do they have the right to do anything?<br /><br />Dave Gibbons's art is very good, too.  Many panels must be studied to find little details that add to the overall density of the story.<br /><br />Great work though it is, WATCHMEN is not for kids.  There's some subject matter that would not be suitable for children.  Plus the complex story and philosophy of it all would likely go over their heads.  This may be a comic book, but it's made for adults.  Don't be fooled and get this for a kid.  And don't be fooled and skip over this because you think it is for kids.
B000ZLFALI|4.0|Honestly, I've never been a Beatles-fan. That is, I've never been a Beatles-fan prior to seeing Across The Universe. I found it on a whim somewhere, watched it just as suddenly, and I was pretty much caught. It's not even my \\"regular type\\" of music, but the way the story unfolds and how the songs are adapted and presented is what makes it great. I don't know Paul from John back in '60-whatever, but give me a fresh take on it, apply it to something colorful, catchy and modern, and you've got me. T-Bone Burnett was brilliant on Walk The Line, and he's just as great here. The way I see it, he's basically unearthing old rocks and polishing them into diamonds.<br /><br />You might need to be open to musicals, because it's still (basically) two hours of people dancing and singing in colorful environments. But it's set in the 60's environment, and plays across the entire story in many literal and appropriate ways. The production design and visuals is just as much part of it as anything else.<br /><br />Below I'll be sharing thoughts on my favourite segments and songs. If you haven't seen it yet, you might want to check it out before reading any further.<br /><br />The opening, with \\"Girl\\" is particularly lamentful, Jim Sturgess draws you into it with nothing but his voice, and only a hint of a song. Not long after he also begins \\"All My Loving\\" with only his voice, and it's one of my very favourite songs because it stays with you in some odd way, it's just a very accessible and memorable song. \\"Hold Me Tight\\" in between goes from being your basic dance romp to something else when it's sung by two people in two situations. What's nice throughout is that most of it sounds almost sung \\"on the spot\\", similar in a way to Walk The Line. \\"..Face\\" is annoyingly hummable and \\"I Want You\\" has the best guitar sound in the entire thing (save, maybe \\"Helter Skelter\\"). \\"Because\\" is a rare sort of halftime break because it's so ethereal, but I don't think that's different from the original song. \\"Strawberry Fields\\" is a great visual montage, the look of it lifts the actual song a lot higher than it stands on its own. Evan Rachel Wood shows her entire singing skill in \\"Blackbird\\" and \\"Hey Jude\\", although a bit literal, is also a good moment, especially just the calm opening.<br /><br />Songs I'm not as fond of are \\"Come Together\\", \\"Why Don't We..\\", \\"Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite!\\", \\"Oh! Darling\\", \\"Happiness Is A Warm Gun\\" and \\"Don't Let Me Down\\". Mostly they're \\"B-songs\\", and they could all be dropped without affecting the primary story. There's also a lot of bickering between the secondary couple, and I'm not as fond of their singing in general. While Bono is odd enough, Eddie Izzard is just too odd, same goes for the song. Many songs are very literal, and overall I think it feels overly long, so it could've easily dropped 20 or 30 minutes and kept the other songs on the DVD or some alternate cut.<br /><br />Anyway, that's how impressionable I am. Brighten it up and I'm there, and Across The Universe does the job well. It's fascinating and just overall enjoyable, with a new approach to a bygone era of music. It proves that a new method is often the way to appreciate something completely different.lds\\" is a great visual montage, the look of it lifts the actual song a lot higher than it stands on its own.

B0019T9FL6|5.0|I didn't know what to expect with Jennifer's debut album, but boy did she surprise me!!! Her album is so refreshing from what's out today.  Her voice is just the right tone, tempo and pitch for every single song on this cd!  I bought it a week ago and it's still in my cd player.    My favorite songs are:  Spotlight  If This Isn't Love  Giving Myself  What's Wrong (Go Away)  My Heart  I'm His Only Woman (I LOVE this song!! Fantasia was just the person to have on this song!)  Can't Stop The Pain  We Gon' Fight (Jennifer blew on this song!!)  Invisible    This cd is definitely HIGHLY recommended!
B001ED7C58|1.0|is a tool. You are out of your friggin mind if you thought the entire soundtrack was fantastic. You need to get professional help because you are so obsessed with the book series or \\"team edward\\" that you'll overlook that this is a terrible compilation. Sure there are some decent songs by Paramore,  and the first one by Muse is kind of catchy, but the Robert Pattinson song - you can't even understand what he's singing it's so muddled.  The other corporate chosen music is completely wrong for the story.  Bella's Lullaby is purely manufactured nothingness. They should've taken the time to read the book instead of choosing the cheapest track to fill up the space on the CD or done a promo where the fans vote on the best track to put on the soundtrack.  This goes to show that studios don't care about the consumer, just what the consumer is willing to pay for it.  The fact that at this moment the price is down to 9.99 really proves my point even more.  They made a huge mistake on this one.
B000058983|5.0|Many of the negitive reviews seem to focus on what a waste of money they spent. And warn others not to fall victum of the same mistake.   Well here's what, this is such a great album that I'll send anyone the money to buy it, if that's the only issue.     Howdy, Russ.
0793518326|1.0|For those of you complaining about the miniscule print size (and absolutely right to do so - quite ridiculous!), why aren't you simply returning the book for a refund? I did this and was refunded immediately. It's NOT fit for the purpose, so get your money back, then maybe the publishers will listen to the customers a bit more closely.
B000003CKH|5.0|This is a great CD from a great band- especially the cover on I will survive is brilliant. Cake is like the Thrills, Polarbears and the Beatles one of the few bands that sounds great and real.
0802136834|5.0|Very illustrative and insightful. I am looking forward to reading Weir's Life of Elizabeth I that I just ordered today.
0060578793|5.0|This book provides great instruction on surviving crisis situations.  It is not a \\"gear\\" book and does not attempt to sell products like some books.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to be able to provide life saving action for themselves or their family.
B001G9LVGG|4.0|If you have not yet heard \\"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen\\" by Loreena McKennitt then you are MISSING OUT! It will always be one of the best Christmas songs out there.  It's pure classic, the only version of the song you'll ever need.<br /><br />As far as the rest of the album, there's definately some more hits.. and some misses.<br /><br />\\"Good King Wenceslas\\" has a really great renaissance feel, \\"Snow\\" has entrancing vocals behind a wintery, snowblown orchestra.  \\"Coventry Carol\\" sounds like the perfect dramatic song to accompany a church performance of the nativity story.<br /><br />All of the tracks are pretty good of course (with a voice like Loreena's, it can't go too wrong) but none of the other tracks are stand-out worthy like those four.  If you already have one of Loreena's mini-christmas albums I honestly don't think you need this one, but if you don't have a winter CD by Loreena you need to get this NOW!
B0017ZB8M6|5.0|There are a lot of things that work here, unlike pop albums that are hodge-podges of hits and misses. Perry's unifying theme here is gender stereotypes. From 'One of The Boys' to 'I Kissed a Girl' to 'Ur So Gay' to 'Mannequin,' Perry satirizes popular conceptions of what it means to be female or male. Yet she sincerely paints a picture of loving and longing on other tracks on like 'Thinking of You,' 'Lost,' and 'I'm Still Breathing.' This album is very listenable, song-for-song, with lots of clever hooks. The production is solid, but Perry's capable voice is what really shines here. She is successful where the recent efforts of artists like Avril Lavigne, Britney Spears, and Alanis Morrisette fall flat.
B001BR5F4C|5.0|Though there are somethings that could have made this better, such as more extras in HD, it simply does not take away from what this is - two great movies that look steller.    These are also worthwhile having in your collection, because (for me) Tartino's movies usually become better when watching a second or third time.  Pulp Fiction was one like that for me - I thought it was okay when I initially saw it, but subsequent viewings made me apprciate it more.  The same thing occurred with the Kill Bill movies for me.  I preferred 2 more than 1 when I initially had seen them, but then began to enjoy 1 more than I had before.    Hopefully there will be future versions with some of the missing things or things I would like to see, but until then I am very happy with this.
6305428042|5.0|Finally added this to my collection. Its a halloween staple in my house, and for a very decent price I could make it a part of this Halloween.  I have always loved this movie and it was the 1st time my boyfriend(28) and his daughter (5yr) saw it and they loved it.  Its hilarious, great acting, and just right to get in the fall mood!
B000P6YNSE|2.0|SPOILER ALERT.  I seem to be one of few people who thought that Lost Season 2 was the strongest yet.  Season 2 is everything that Season 3 isn't:  Carefully plotted, secrets revealed at the right times and with the right amount of impact, storyline well paced, and a sense of confidence in where the story was headed.  By the end of Season 2, I was intrigued.    That all ended in the first minutes of Season 3, where we discover instantly that the Island isn't really removed from the rest of civilization the way we thought, and all the mystery and menace of \\"the Others\\" simply evaporates.  By Episode 3 I found myself simply not caring about any of the characters or their schizophrenic decision-making.  This persisted throughout the remainder of the season with the exception of a tense standoff over Ben's spinal surgery.  In general, major events become laughable, the dialogue devolves into something bordering cheap and hoaky, tense situations are poorly constructed, and characters begin making decisions not because they make sense, but because they conveniently advance the plot.    An excessive amount of time is dedicated to flashbacks, many of them utterly pointless.  The insertion of the back-story on Nikki and Paulo is particularly irrelevant.  If I wanted to watch a show about a B-Movie actress, a con heist gone awry, or a love affair on the Sydney riviera, I wouldn't turn to Lost for my fix.  Intense stand-offs between key characters in pivotal moments are sloppy and often make no sense considering the circumstances.  The key players stop behaving in ways we would expect them to based on our previous understanding of their characters, and it isn't intentional.  The use of coincidence gets more extreme than ever, to the point of inducing eye-rolling rather than surprise or fascination.      A sense that there's a good explanation for all the coincidence rapidly diminishes as Season 3 progresses.  More and more characters seem to be becoming omniscient, somehow knowing things that nobody in their right mind could ever hope to piece together, and not just because the island or some unseen force told them.  Speaking of mysticism, the writers have become utterly reliant on superstition - and what appears to be telepathy - in order to get characters to learn and communicate efficiently with one another.  There's a flashback of Desmond's where even one of the ancillary characters not familiar with the Island seems to know all its secrets and everything about everyone.      Hurley gets inordinate screen time, which would be fine if his character weren't such a crashing bore.  Most of the new female characters have had so much cosmetic surgery that they don't fit in with the rugged environment of the Island.  Juliet is simply hard to look at, her face deconstructed and pieced back together with silicone, collagen and sculpted bone fragments, and ditto for Desmond's wife.  It's all well and fine for soap operas; wrong for a show like Lost.  Charley's death came at a disappointment particularly since none of the new characters are interesting enough to replace him.  Most of the new additions are dry, bland, cookie-cutter types that you might expect to see on a show like 7th Heaven or a filler courtroom drama.    There is almost no real \\"Island time\\" to speak of.  Most of the events take place in the built-up parts of the Island, complete with swingsets, electricity, pianos, flower pattern curtains and hospital beds.  Scenes with the original survivors of flight 815 at their original beach camp seem out of place given that you apparently can't walk very far in any direction without stumbling upon a house, farm, quay or bunker.  The sense of adventure is completely drained from the show by the time Season 3 concludes.    Now that I think about it, Season 3 was so bad I might not even watch Season 4.  And considering what a promising start the first two seasons were, that's quite a feat.  The promise of \\"Lost\\" is escapism, but Season 3brings us right back to the real world of dry primetime television.
B0000062FN|5.0|I bought the first Santana and Abraxis albums back in the early 1970s and although I was aware of the third album, I never picked up on it. Here all this time later, hearing all of it in its entirety, I rank it one of the best of all his albums. This album sounds more like a jam, there's a lot of energy. It's not entirely different from the earlier albums but more loose and with wonderful guitar solos and interesting percussion. It is a classic album: a little dated-sounding but I love listening to it.
0307269752|3.0|At first this book seems like a predictable formula thriller complete with brutal murders and violent rape scenes as well as contrived timing of discoveries and life saving feats of heroism...but upon closer examination it appears to be a scathing commentary on the many ills of society.<br /><br />On the surface...<br />Journalist Mikael Blomkvist has just learned that he has been convicted for libel against the powerful businessman Hans-Erik Wennerstrom and will be serving time in jail in the near future.  But before he begins to serve his time he's hired to look into the mysterious death of a sixteen year old girl.  The girl, Harriet Vanger, disappeared forty years ago, her body still hasn't been found.  Her aging great uncle has been obsessed with finding out what happened to her.  The uncle has offered to pay Blomkvist a ridiculous sum of money as well as giving him incriminating evidence to bring down Hans-Erik Wennerstrom if he will commit to looking into the circumstances of Harriet's death for one year. Blomkvist agrees and with the help of his assistant Lisbeth Salander he grasps the thread that will enable him to unravel the mystery surrounding Harriet's death.<br /><br />Beyond the obvious...this is a story rich with criticisms of the unethical, corrupt, greedy and opportunistic in society.  The corrupt and evil are served what seems like fair and just rewards for their crimes.  But what does that say about those serving up the justice.  Even our heroes need to be examined, how do they stand up to scrutiny?<br /><br />For me this was a difficult novel to get into.  There were many references that were purely Swedish in nature that I didn't get.  There were brand names, government agencies and other references that left me wondering \\"what the hell are they saying?\\".  I think that the translation could have been done so that it made the Swedish references more clear to the rest of the world (or specifically \\"ugly-Americans\\" like myself).<br /><br />It's not a horrible story, though it is rather graphic and violent.  I thought many of the relationships were unrealistic, the character descriptions were conflicting and the dialog was often unbelievable and while I don't think Larson was the worlds best writer, I have to say that I think he tells a decent story that pulls you in and makes you want to find out 'who dunnit'.<br /><br />I found the most compelling part of the story the character Lisbeth Salander.

0307455874|4.0|Notice the people that are leaving negative comments are the ones bringing up racial issues and name calling? Yet I dont recall once where Obama has ever really brought up race except to say in equality. Even when he mentioned Martin Luther King, he referred to him as \\"a preacher from Georgia\\". Not a black man, or a white man, an American. Do yourself a favor and actually read his book or actually listen to his speeches, esp \\"A more perfect union\\". He truly is trying to turn the page and move forward together, hence the title.

1416905014|5.0|A fully dimensional fairyland coach!  A rat that turns into a footman before your very eyes!  Cinderella dressed magically for the ball!  The glass slipper!  Twirling dancers!  Matthew Reinhart has as much genius in his designs as the fairy godmother had magic in her wand.  Highly recommend this book to children (with supervision) and adults, too.

B001E75QGG|2.0|BEWARE! I just (tried) to watch my copy, and I was shocked that my feature film disc was defected. The error starts at the scene when Indy is being interrogated by his double crosser friend, whatshisname, and then the picture freezes, and it continues only when I skip the movie with the button, and the next playable scene is when the old guy starts to auto write. Well, I'm quite dissapointed, not just by this outrageously mediocre sequel to a glorious franchise, but the idea, that this is my very first defected blu-ray disc. I wouldn't have watched Indy IV. many times anyway, but now that my disc is broken, I'm pissed. Please watch your copy to be sure, yours doesn't have a problem, because it may also well be a serial mistake. Well, now my remaining enthusiasm towards the new Indiana Jones-flick has faded.

B00127RAJY|3.0|This is a tough workout!  However, it involves a lot of jumping and running type moves.  If you have problems with your knees or legs you might want to use another workout tape which is calmer and work up to this one.  If not, you might become frustrated and quit.  Even the moves of the one person on the tape doing low impact is still high impact for some people if you are just beginning to try and lose weight.  There is no time in between to get set to do the next thing if you don't workout a ton and are just getting into it.  Jillian's workout is definately a high intensity work-out!
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Spectacular little unit for those that do not want the much bulkier, much more expensive models.  I use this exclusively for bounce flash and the difference it has made is unbelievable.  Highly highly recommended.  In fact, many people say to first time DSLR purchasers, get the 50mm prime for low light, since it's so fast and so cheap.  But I have to say, if your intention is shooting kids, for instance, I say forget the 50mm and spend your $100 on this instead.

0938045695|5.0|Others have done a good job of reviewing this guide to the kettlebells. They can be brutal in developing your strength, cardio, and balance and stability all at the same time. These are not your mother's free weights! The author, Pavel, is self-described as \\"the evil Russian,\\" but his wry and perceptive humor actually helps me to stay focused and enjoy the end results (after the pain subsides from laughing and lifting at the same time.) Some complained that the price for this book was too high, but now that Amazon is offering it for less than $25.00, you will be glad that you ordered it before your athletic friends and opponents discover kettlebells.
B001EN71DG|5.0|Well, this one is more to have the set along with the new box-set for the prequel trilogy.    There was a limited edition and several different box-sets for the SW Trilogy, but if you did not have them or you purchased the new Prequel Trilogy box-set, it is worth buying it.
0783231032|5.0|So what did some of you people do-  Get tired of surfing porn all night and decide to jump on the bandwagon of people that have bashed this movie because the critics originally bashed it??  I can watch this movie over and over-  What's not to like??   Because some of it is slapstick??  Because it's not PC??  Because it's not deep-seeded intellectual humor like the latest Adam Sandler trash???   This is a great movie with outstanding (for the time) special effects, great characters, and lots of funny scenes!   I especially love the drunk lumberjack (Slim Pickens) trying to chop down a Jap Soldier (in camoflage as a pine tree) and Belushi falling off the wing of his plane!  My name is Wild Bill Kelso- and don't you forget it!!
B001EN71DQ|5.0|Finally they released a box set for the Prequel Trilogy! I had not purchased the Episodes I, II and III because I felt that if they released a box set for IV, V and VI, they had to do it with the first ones as well.    Well, the wait was worth it, finally they released a box set for the new movies. Good  quality of the video and the boxes are awesome.    Buy these if you are a SW fan!!!
0061148512|3.0|I thought the beginning was excellent; I really liked the first paragraph. Very tight writing, but then it started to falter. I know it's due to the emotional unraveling of Esther, but it just fell apart for me. Still worth reading.
B001IUBZAU|5.0|For anyone wondering what the packaging is like for the VINYL edition of this most excellent set:    The only way to truly appreciate the visual work put into this project is to see it full-scale by way of the double LP set. Housed in a beautiful glossy black gatefold with flat black illustrations, and our beloved ACDC logo crystallized in blood red on the front.  The inside follows this design minus the logo but with red liner notes at the bottom of each side, and each side of the 2 inner sleeves are printed in full black & red. Leave these inside for safe keeping, but get yourself new sleeves that better protect the records (these kind of picture paper sleeves are notorious for causing light scuffing on the record surface, doesn't effect playback but seems unsightly in my opinion. Plus we all know how paper creates dust over time).    The 180gram discs are beauties for sure, labeled with gray/black centers- mine are perfectly flat and I'm detecting little surface noise on my 15yr old technics table, but as I break in my newly installed Shure cartridge I expect even less. The sound is crisp and the bass not too low, The mix is just excellent as you'd expect.     Every single cut is killer here- I won't do a track by track analysis, all the other great reviews are dead on. If I had to complain about something, I'd say some cuts could have been extended with longer solos & breakdowns.  Hardly a valid nag.  Producer Brendan O'Brien has pulled the best album possible out of an old fave. Pick the CD up for your car or office, but I suggest for home listening you dig out your old turntable if you haven't already, nab this beauty on vinyl and really experience it.
0743297334|3.0|This book has to be considered in the time it was written to appreciate it. Some books are timeless--theme, characters, etc.--and others are best viewed in the year they were published. I think this is one of those books. For 1926, this would have been quite daring as a response to WWI, especially considering it was a new kind of war.    The novel doesn't really make explicit assertions or come to any definitive conclusions; it's more like holding a mirror up to society: this is what is going on. I liked the dialogue and found some of the banter funny, and I did not find all of the characters completely hopeless. These stories work best as a series of short stories (Fitzgerald, Yates are good examples), which are more like a set of snapshots. This book does read like a short story in parts, especially Part I, and it is a quick read.    I often see it on the Top 100 Novels lists, which is why I read it. I think many times the distinction is not made between most influential books, on which this title would definitely fall and best written books, on which I wouldn't place this title.
B00110K62U|3.0|I didn't want to reiterate what are basically accurate reviews already here, but I just got off the phone with Warner Home video.  I'm on my second DVD after having contacted Warner (referred to them by BBC America) about the missing bits on the DVD as mentioned by others. Let's be clear: the omission is obvious. We're not talking a decision to take a distinct section out, it's a segment from the middle of a song that's missing. I had contacted them earlier this year and, after months of back and forth, received a replacement that I was assured fixed the problem.   It did not.  After finally being able to watch the DVD, I saw that the exact same errors were present (Gavroche and \\"Little People,\\" etc.). In addition. I found another problem I didn't see in my quick glance through the reviews here.    The original release of the concert was on a double-sided, double layer DVD, with Act 1 on one side, Act 2 on the second. This DVD is on a single-sided DVD. How did they do this? By atrociously high video compression. There are a lot of blacks in the concert as a result of it being performed on a stage with a darkened background. The posterization effect that results from the high compression (where the shading changes are abrupt rather than gradual) are quite glaring and distracting.    Anyway, I've contacted Warner again; their initial response was \\"that's how it is,\\" which is just silly.     It's a shame; I love Les Miserables, and this is truly a great version--the only way it could have been better would have been if it had been a complete version of the play.     But I'd loaned out my original DVD (the previous release) to someone who made off with it; I think it's better enough (compared to this one) that I'm going to order a replacement, despite the quite high cost.
1400064627|4.0|I loved the movie and I loved the book, although in differnt ways. The book has a slew of minor characters that would be too confusing for the movie. If you are a fan of Southern fiction, this book is a must. Even if you're not, check out this title.
1416562605|4.0|This is one of those shocking novels that give a new dimension to issues of: race, class and cultural prejudices.  It is a darkly humorous book about new Indian culture only a writer from India can write about.  It requires knowledge of Indian culture and its shortcomings and boldness of writing about it that the outsider would not dare.  Main character is Balram Halwai, man with no education who has never left his village and misery until the opportunity came along to become a servant to a family of a higher caste.  Although written in a plain and easy to read manner, this book is shocking in its raw power to describe how even in a modern times, one man can be a slave to another that will drive him to a point of murder.  Book is describing ways of modern Indian enterprenership where ministers and political allies get paid off, rich can get away with anything and poor are dispensable.  Humanity gets defined differently.  To be human means to become rich at any price and under any circumstances with no regrets.  I found this book both shocking and eye opening.  Once you read it, you will have an entirely different view on the world of outourcing, riche nouveau and notion of climbing up the social ladder.  Fascinating topic presented in easy to read and entertaining style.  Great start for the first time published writer.
B000Q6GXW2|5.0|Man this movie rocks!  I first saw it in an IMAX theatre and was blown away by the visual effects and the action.  It's one of the best action movies i've seen in years and looks/sounds really good in HD.  Truely a movie for everyone except kids.  Ladies get to look at dudes with six-pack abs and guys get to see their heads get cut off.
B000FSME1A|5.0|The films title alone, `Apocalypse Now', is synonymous with classic; even to those who have never seen it.  All the praise and admiration that has been heaped upon this film over the years has embedded in us the very idea that it must be `that' great.  I personally had never seen this movie until this past holiday weekend when I was sick with the flu and in bed for three days (I watched like 30 movies, so I'm cool with it).  All I have to say is that `classic' doesn't even begin to explain just how amazing this movie really is.<br /><br />I want to be clear about one thing.  War movies have never really been my thing.  I love the whole `swords-and-sandals' epics; sure.  `Ben'Hur' and `Gladiator', two of my favorite movies, but the Vietnam, guns and bullets, hiding in trenches, bombing buildings bit; never truly been that interested.  My perspective on the genre changed a bit when I witnessed Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece `Full Metal Jacket', a film that is truly astonishing, but understandably very `love it or hate it'.  With my interest pricked I decided to explore the genre a little more.  There were some that turned me off a bit (not a huge fan of `The Thin Red Line') and there were some that really impressed me (actually floored by my adoration of Oliver Stone's `Platoon') and then there was this little ditty that just left me spellbound.<br /><br />Yes, let it be said' `Apocalypse Now' may very well be the definitive `war movie'.<br /><br />The film follows Captain Benjamin L. Willard, dispatched the find rogue Colonel Walter E. Kurtz who has drifted into savagery.  The film basically moves along with Willard as he travels upriver towards his eventual destination.  One is brought into the mentality of one ravaged by war, and the mental and emotional deterioration is overwhelming; especially once Willard comes face to face with Kurtz.<br /><br />The film, to me, is shot much like a wartime film noir, with Martin Sheen narrating the film, filling in the complete story for the audience.  Frances Ford Coppola is a fantastic director who savagely moves from location to location, painting a horrific picture (`the horror') that stimulates our senses and engages our minds.  I remember thinking just how crisp this movie feels, its richness spilling over every sequence.  The script is brilliantly crafted in a way that engages you from start to finish, never bogging us down and boring us in any way but always keeping our interest.<br /><br />And then there are the performances.<br /><br />Martin Sheen does a fine job here, but much like his son Charlie in `Platoon', he becomes more of an afterthought when you consider the cast of characters he shares the screen with.  Robert Duvall (who was nominated for an Oscar) is extremely memorable as Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore.  His `napalm in the morning' phrase is probably one of the most quoted movie phrases of all time, but his one liners are not the reason his performance is so flawless.  He truly captures the man that was Kilgore and emulates a human passion on the screen.  Duvall is not the best performance here though; for that belongs to Marlon Brando.  There are many reports about the issues Coppola had working with Brando (his excessive weight gain, his drinking problems, his apathetic attitude and his not knowing of his lines) but when all is said and done Brando pulled out a passionate and devastatingly haunting performance as the renegade Kurtz.  His semi-religious almost prophetic approach to his characters revelations paint the picture that is `Apocalypse Now' and quite honestly, his character is what makes this movie so important.<br /><br />This film is a very dark and treacherous journey through the mind of a man pushed to brink of his sanity due to actions that make no sense.  What is so imperative about films like `Full Metal Jacket', `Platoon' and `Apocalypse Now' is that, instead of paying homage to the men in uniform (I'm not saying they don't deserve respect so don't read this wrong) they portray war as a facet of our lives better left alone, a part of our culture that does nothing but harm; physically, emotionally and mentally.  Coppola's masterpiece is a film not to be missed for it relays a message that is all to real.r lives better left alone, a part of our culture that does nothing but harm; physically, emotionally and mentally.

B000E1MTY0|5.0|What's not to love about this movie.  It's got everything a good action movie should have and more.  I've always loved the Tim Burton \\"Batman\\" movies but they were good for their time and this is a new Batman, for a new day.  The darker ,edgier look of this movie is what I think most comic book fans want.  I'm really not saying anything you haven't probably already read.  Oh yeah, it looks great in HD.

B000B8QG0O|4.0|Overall, this is one of the better sequels out there. The animation is wonderful and I love the soundtrack. This really keeps my 2 year olds attention and he loves Woody and Buzz. I think the first Toy Story was a little bit more unique/original/quippy, but this is great, too.

B00007FOMP|5.0|A pivotal chapter in the oral history of Motown Records has it that when Berry Gordy, the label's founder, first heard Marvin Gaye's conceptual masterwork he simply wanted to shelve it as the ramblings of a self-indulgent \\"artiste\\" who had lost his commercial bearings - since nothing about the record conformed to Gordy's hugely successful \\"Motown Sound\\" formula that routinely cranked out hits in apolitical, three minute increments.<br /><br />As the story continues, Smokey Robinson supposedly intervened informing Gordy that \\"while he did not quite know how to classify Gaye's new offering he was quite certain that it was divinely inspired\\" (or words to that effect.) At this point the Motown chieftain relented and agreed to a \\"limited\\" pressing. Yet another reason to love Smokey.<br /><br />Even after hundreds of plays, What's Going On still leaves me speechless and groping for new superlatives. This is a mesmerizing and timeless record that is the human testament of an extremely troubled soul - who rather than retreating into self-pity attempts to reconcile with salvation through music.<br /><br />Coming off a multi-year hiatus from recording in 1971 with his own life in shambles and the social and racial fabric of the nation unraveling, Gaye was able to channel his own fragility into a staggering and moving testimony to life on the streets that so poignently tapestried the crosscurrents of every emotion from exaltation to despair - all within the framework of a near perfect 39-minute song cycle.<br /><br />Of course you'll recognize the three major hits - What's Going On, Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology) and Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler) however it the quieter, more plaintive pieces such as Save the Children and Wholy Holy that allow Marvin to open his veins and infuse the entire record with supernatural grace.<br /><br />What's Going On is Gaye's urban gospel of alienation told against a musical score that remains to this day a reference standard for rock-funk-R&B fusion and forms the foundation for what is IMHO the single greatest achievement in popular recording since Chuck Berry laid down his first three chords. WGO should be a cornerstone title for any collection not only for what the record once meant but for the meaning that it continues to offer new audiences.

B001ESYAJY|2.0|I have to agree with others who found this score uninspiring and somewhat derivative. It is certainly not in the same league as Arnold's previous score for Casino Royale, which I personally rank as his best work so far on a Bond film. I have not seen the film yet and so cannot say how the music works in the context of the film. But the CD is dominated by hard-driving action music.  And while that in itself is not necessarily a bad thing, the action music as presented here lacks variety. And some of the other, non-action cues featured on the CD are so short that they are hardly worth including. And the less said about the god-awful theme song the better.
0385751893|4.0|The absolute high point of The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is the attention to character development witnessed in every persona that appears onscreen. Thought-provoking and powerful, the backdrop of World War II, prison camps, and Nazis perfectly clash with the innocence of a child's mind and the injustice and compassion perceived through his eyes. At once painful, tear-jerking and deeply emotional, this is a film that cannot be easily forgotten.<br /><br />Little Bruno (Asa Butterfield) and his family relocate to the countryside and out of Berlin during World War II. Bruno's father (David Thewlis) has just received a promotion to oversee a German concentration camp, much to the disapproval of his politically forthright parents, which takes the family away from friends and comfort. Bruno is initially upset, especially with boredom due to the lack of other children around the secluded house they move to, but he secretly wanders outside to investigate his surroundings.<br /><br />Not far from the lonely home is the camp and its odd \\"farmers\\" who occasionally act as servants for the family. When Bruno works up the courage to travel to the gaunt resort, he meets Shmuel (Jack Scanlon) dressed in funny pajamas and looking glum. Soon the two consider themselves friends, even though they are separated by an electrified fence and can only meet in secrecy. Bruno brings food and games to play, but envisages himself as the unlucky one; he is tutored most of the day and trapped in a solitary fortress while Shmuel gets to roam freely (within the confines of the camp). Bruno's family life begins to falter when his mother (Vera Farmiga) discovers the true purpose of the camp and her husband's duties, and so he plots to join Shmuel in his search for his own missing father.<br /><br />James Horner's preeminent score gives extra depth and resonance to outstanding performances and dire depictions of a catastrophic period. The film is told through the eyes of an innocent boy, giving a considerably unique approach to a Holocaust film. Based on the novel by John Boyne, the film never delves into actual atrocities, but instead focuses on the misinterpretations of a child's mind and the innocent interactions with both dutiful Nazis and suffering prisoners.<br /><br />Every character is incredibly complex, from Jewish servant Pavel, who was once a doctor and now peels potatoes and serves drinks (Bruno can't understand why he'd give up his career), to Lieutenant Kotler, the intimidating German officer who shows no clemency to the Jews, yet carefully hides his own doubts about the orders he carries out. No supporting character is wasted, and each is perfectly portrayed by an incredibly talented cast.<br /><br />Some aspects of the film's realism are questionable, from the use of servants to Schmuel's age to young Bruno's naïvet&eacute;, but the message behind The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is nonetheless powerful and emotional. It's a difficult film to watch, but well paced and enlightening, despite the terribly bleak setting. The acting and character designs are simply phenomenal and unquestionably highlight this traumatizing World War II drama.<br /><br />- Mike Massieroach to a Holocaust film.

B00169N0BK|5.0|This is the third color calibration system I have used. It's really great but has benefits and limitations that I will outline below:<br /><br />Generally, until now, being able to calibrate your monitor AND your prints has been impossible without spending $1000 or more. Of course, if you are a high end production photographer or someone who requires perfect calibration for pre-press, then this is not the tool for you.<br /><br />This is a great tool for an advanced amateur who is satisfied with really decent monitor to print accuracy, but not absolutely perfect results. It gets you about 90% there. I use it to give my printer an advance look at what I think my digital files are capable of, as a guide to creating a final print. I also use it for all the home printing so that I don't waste paper. It's saved a bundle of $$ so far not to have to print twice!<br /><br />I won't go into all the nitty gritty. The software is fairly intuitive, especially compared with the higher  end products. It's a quick process - about 30 minutes from start to finish to set it up if your printer is already installed.<br /><br />I found it to be a little less accurate with Black and White printing than color.<br /><br />The best part is that with LCD screens you only have to calibrate once and it lasts as long as you have the printer. Find a friend who also wants to calibrate and share the cost.<br /><br />You'll be pleased to finally be able to hit the print button and get what you expect from you printer!!! Good luck!
0446693804|3.0|\\"A Walk To Remember\\" was my first exposure to Nicholas Sparks, but it was the movie, not the book.  I absolutely adored the movie and I can watch it over and over, and cry, and cry again.  Finally, I read the book, just to see how it differed from the movie.  It was a disappointment.  Yes, it was a sweet love story, and keep the kleenex handy, but I've come to learn that Sparks' writing style really doesn't change from book to book.  The story is about a typical teenager who discovers the inner beauty of an unpopular, overprotected girl and falls in love with her.  The characters are well-developed but what annoys me the most about all of Sparks' books are the long, drawn out self reflection of feelings and emotions (I like him/her, does he/she like me...well, he/she seems to like me...)    I've seen all of his movies (including \\"Message In A Bottle\\", \\"The Notebook\\" and \\"Nights in Rodanthe\\") and loved them all.  After I found out they were all books by Nicholas Sparks, I decided I'd better start reading, that they had to be good!!!  So, now I've read half a dozen or so, and the more I read them, the more I dislike his style of writing.  These books are nothing more than modern-day Harlequin romances.  Predictable and, well, boring.  Most of the women in the books are very annoying and makes me wonder why on earth any man would put up with them.  And Sparks uses the same phrases from book to book and more than once in a book.  If I read \\"she tucked a strand of hair behind her ear\\", one more time...    I'm currently listening to \\"At First Sight\\" on audiobook.  I'm not sure I'm going to be able to finish it, then I'm done with Nicholas Sparks.  I'll watch the movies because they're good chick flicks.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I think the reason a lot of people are ticked off at this album is because they assumed \\"Naked\\" would mean an acoustic album, much like a \\"Beatles Unplugged.\\"      This isn't what Paul and Mr. Martin were trying to do. They were doing their best to make Let It Be a respectable album, and they did an amazing job.    The tracks sound very clear and concise, as if the Beatles were making an actual album,not letting Spector salvage an atrocious recording session.    Buy this instead of the original. It's far better. The songs no longer sound dated. On the contrary, they sound practically eternal.
B001F0WXY0|5.0|This book is a must for any science fiction fan who appreciates good writing! 5 stars!
B00006IU73|1.0|This is one lousy album. You have exactly one good song, the opener called \\"Blackest Eyes\\", and the rest is just complete rubbish. Why are so many people telling me Porcupine Tree is some kind of modern progressive rock band influenced by bands such as King Crimson and Rush? Are you kidding me? These guys don't have the songwriting skills to make the songs interesting, which is why classic 70's King Crimson and Rush are a LOT better. This is just fake art rock that tries to trick you into thinking it's more intelligent than it really is, not to mention a slight influence of heavy metal in small doses as well (though I will admit it's probably better than what King Crimson has been doing the last 20 years or so).<br /><br />The lyrics are good, but the musical ideas are very uninteresting and just terrible most of the time, with one ordinary and unmemorable vocal melody leading straight into *more* average vocal melodies. That's what the entire album feels like to me. The riff in the beginning of \\"Wedding Nails\\" is stolen directly from Deep Purple's \\"Rat Bat Blue\\". The drumming is run of the mill because it does nothing but plod along to the music without doing anything memorable. In fact, ALL the musical instruments on the album do the same thing. This is the kind of music you'd hear at a haunted house for kids or something. You can't take the music seriously, and hopefully none of you reading this review ARE taking Porcupine Tree seriously.<br /><br />\\"Gravity Eyelids\\" has a verse melody that's basically modified from the one Jon Anderson sings in the Yes classic \\"Wonderous Stories\\".  The Metallica-like riffage near the end is acceptable at least. \\"Collapse the Light Into Earth\\" sounds like two or three piano notes that last 5 minutes with boring strings in the background, but those are at least better than the extremely boring vocals that the song features.<br /><br />Please, don't put this stuff on the same level as King Crimson, Gentle Giant, or Yes. Doing so would be wrong.
B000NY133G|1.0|I had heard much about this book, but after reading it, I feel I just wasted my money. I have read other books that had much more interesting language and ideas- this one was hard to read, hard to understand and most of all, not worth my time, money or trouble.
B001F7XIJW|5.0|Great album, but one thing bothers me a lot: People keep on saying it doesn't sound like anything else... Well, to me, it does sound a lot like early Prong (\\"Beg to differ\\" comes to mind).  That doesn't prevent this album from being good, in the vein of \\"From Mars to Sirius\\", even though I prefer the \\"freshness\\" of FMTS.  In a nutshell, if you like previous Gojira's work, you can't go wrong with this one
B001KO8ISG|5.0|This is the best series on TV since X-Files.  I concur with the previous poster, and hope that it keeps going. The stories are so interesting on each episode, and the acting from the cast is great.
0060594896|5.0|I took this book out from my library - started reading it - and soon realized that I needed my own copy, since there were so many passages I wanted to highlight and underline. You can pick this up to any chapter and learn something. It is so jammed packed with helpful and insightful ideas that there is almost TOO MUCH info to absorb! Really probably one of the best books i've read this year. If you're in business for yourself, looking to expand your horizons or looking for some self-help - this book has it all!
B0016Q2D5M|3.0|Had a great time watching the movie with my kids, the 3d effects are ok.  Nothing special, kids loved them they were grabbing for the things coming out of the TV.  Quality could be a lot better.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|An amazing film unlike any other \\"coming out\\" film.  COMPLETELY different!  Reminds you of a \\"normal\\" story you could see happening in anyone's life.  Loved it!
B001DDBCUU|5.0|I tried to watch the show on more than one occasion but after a few minutes into it I would lose interest.  It seemed goofy and and the women were so vain it was embarrassing.  I rented the movie because I was hopeful it would be better than the show and I have to say I was glued! I loved it!  It was funny, pretty, dramatic and you really felt for each character.  My husband even came home during the middle of the movie and he had to sit down and watch it.  He wanted me to catch him up on what he missed.  He was laughing at the jokes, felt sorry for Big and really got into the story.  We both really enjoyed the movie!  I had to go out and buy the Special Edition DVD and watch it again.  Don't miss this movie!
0060595183|5.0|Like Douglas Hofstadter three generations later, Aldous Huxley is in awe of the complexities of the human mind. Just like Hofstadter, he too is a compassionate and astute observer of what the mind can accomplish when given full and free-reign. He is also a teacher like Hofstadter with the single purpose of conveying what he has learned to later generations. But unlike Hofstadter whose writings seek to soothe our fears, Huxley perhaps unwittingly, heightens them.<br /><br />Huxley's writings have shocked and informed us for the better part of a century. His relaxed, clear, almost laconic style can be disarming. Yet, lurking behind this easygoing persona and writing style are always truths so devastating that we ordinary \\"socially adjusted\\" humans still have great difficulty getting our minds around their full implications. As was true in his most famous novel, \\"A Brave New World,\\" here in two of his non-fiction works, Huxley continues his exploration into the implications of expanding the dimensions of the mind; or conversely, exploring why we continue to maintain a world in which the mind remains closed, shutoff, rendered static and limited. Using his own self-administered experiments with drugs, the author directs his fire at how cultural limitations and misuse of the mind have often diminished rather than enhanced the richness of man's life as well as affected his survival chances negatively.<br /><br />The first book in this two-book volume is called \\"The doors of Perception.\\" It is an all but clinical reporting on the effects of a self-administered experiment with the mind-expanding drug, Peyote. (I will review the second book, \\"Heaven and Hell,\\" separately.)<br /><br />Long before the neuro-scientists had confirmed that it was so, Huxley had reported that the brain and its nervous system are primarily a \\"data-reduction machine.\\" That is to say, since in principle each person is capable of taking in vast amounts of data, including being able to remember all thathas ever happened to him, and is capable of perceiving everything that is happening everywhere else in the universe, the primary function of the brain and nervous system is to \\"reduce\\" or \\"abstract from\\" this universe of infinite complexity and possible perceptions, only those data that might be useful in enhancing survival. This \\"reducing function,\\" accomplishes its task by allowing us to discriminate between a mass of overwhelmingly irrelevant and useless stimuli, and those that are perceived to be useful to survival. Importantly, the residue that remains is what we have come to know as conscious awareness.<br /><br />In order to communicate the content of consciousness we have invented symbol systems such as languages, which in themselves have become a mixed blessing: since, at the same time that they allow inter-subjective sharing of accumulated information (usually of survival value), they also erroneously confirm the fact that reality itself is the same as our \\"reduced\\" version of it. That is to say, languages teach us that the reality we have constructed to make the world save for our survival, is the only reality. Further, through language, we have also learned to mistake for \\"real data,\\" the very \\"concepts\\" we invent as their substitutes. And likewise, we have learned to mistake \\"words\\" for the \\"things we have assigned them to represent.\\" Thus the world we see is a severely \\"tapered-down\\" version of the wider universe. It is one of limited, reduced awareness: a \\"symbolic playground\\" that is a mere fragment of the larger, much richer reality: It remains one that is etched and ossified into our brains through language.<br /><br />Huxley claims here that by depriving the brain of its primary fuel, sugar, drugs such as mescalin, the active ingredient in Peyote, can allow us to bypass the brain's \\"data reduction function,\\" making it possible for man to see well beyond the narrowly constricted world created only for purposes of advancing survival.  Bypassing thebrain's data reduction function, mescalin opens up a whole new world of \\"cleansed or virgin perceptions.\\" It does this by relaxing the constraints and inhibitions perceived necessary for survival: things such as our dependence on time, space and having a need for a goal or a purpose. Without the need for a survival purpose, many ordinary utilitarian concerns simply just become uninteresting.<br /><br />What become infinitely more interesting are details previously left unattended to: things that artists see naturally and are conditioned to take for granted, such as intensified visual beauty and impressions, form and structure as inherent qualities, the absence of a dependence on time and space, discursive ego-free thinking, the apprehension of new orders of reality, extra-sensory perceptions, awareness at a distance, awareness of un-conceptualized and un-verbalizable events, perceptions of \\"being one with the universe,\\" simultaneously perceiving everything that is happening within the body (both physically and mentally), and everywhere outside it in the universe at large; a conceptual world that is free of moral judgments, the pursuit of power and control, and all other petty utilitarian concerns that go with them; in short, being able to get beyond the ego-filter allows us to forget the need for self-esteem, ego-relevance, and self-assertion. And most of all it opens the door to transcendental experiences.<br /><br />The beauty of this expanded dimension of psychic reality is that by existing above \\"ego-ness,\\" it necessarily also lies beyond good and evil; indeed beyond a preoccupation with power and self-assertion. The problem with this expanded psychic worldview, however, is that it is incompatible with action-based reality. It gives us access to pure contemplation but not to action itself: It cannot bring the contemplative realm down from the clouds and into phase with the realm of action, in the present. This is so because this wider world of inner contemplation is itself acting as a \\"stand-in\\" for feelings and ideas. As a result, it reduces to a kind of intuited \\"proto-language of the mind\\" of its own: one in which the mind devises its own internal set of psychic symbols, operations and dynamics; symbols and dynamics that interplay among themselves well above our conventional paradigms of how the mind is supposed to function. Schizophrenics use the same self-constructed internal language and in a real sense represent the extreme end, or \\"worse-case\\" example of this enlightened \\"exterior point of view.\\"<br /><br />Yet, Huxley makes a strong case for exploring this broader \\"deeper internal\\" (and \\"superior external\\") point of view. It, for instance, allows us to be aware, always, of total reality in its immanent otherness  -- arguably, the very definition of awareness.  And yet it also allows us to be able to think and feel as an animal and as a human being; that is to say, it does not preclude the possibility of resorting, whenever expedient to systematic survival-based reasoning.<br /><br />As but one example, Huxley compares religions that are \\"talk therapy based\\" -- that is Christianity for instance -- with those that include drugs as part of their sacramental rituals, for instance most Native American religions. Huxley argues rather convincingly that if the purpose of religion is to share a transcendental experience, where the soul knows itself as unconditioned and is of one with nature and with the divine, then Christian bible reading, prayer, hymnal singing and sermonizing, go together to constitute a kind of \\"talk therapy:\\" a living abstraction away form both deep feelings and  about as far from \\"true\\" religious needs as one can get. True religion demands a deep shared psychological experience with the universe and with the divine. All religions strive for this kind of  oneness that transcends the bounds of selfness. Yet, Christianity is based on having a \\"personal God\\" as man's personal servant, constantly at thevery \\"beck and call\\" of every religionist's ego.<br /><br />Huxley suggest that Christians might well learn from our Native American brothers, who took the best of Christianity and married their inherent religious needs with their own self-transcendent experiences, using Peyote. Thus in one religious rite, they satisfied the two appetites of the soul: the urge to independence and self-determination, and the urge to become one with God through self-transcendence.<br /><br />However, for contradictory cultural reasons, drugs, it seems have no place in the Judeao-Christian Church, even when \\"sacramentized use\\" could expand religious understanding, address psychological yearning that can only be satisfied through transcendent experiences, and vastly enrich the religious experience. In order for Christians to have a true religious experience they are required to turn to the drug of alcohol, outside of the walls of the Church, Mosque or Temple.<br /><br />1000 stars
B00000J9HE|5.0|This is a superb set, with an arresting, slightly odd 5th. But the recording of the 7th is the best ever made. The sound is splendid.
0316042994|5.0|Like all American editions, this new edition by Back Bay Books uses the original 1945 version of the book. Waugh reissued it in 1959 \\"with many small additions and some substantial cuts\\", so that all later UK editions, including Penguin and Everyman's Library, used the new revised version. Only the American publisher continued to use the old one. There is a disagreement between Waugh's readers  about whether the altered text was an improvement. Frank Kermode in his preface to the Everyman's edition argues that \\"the final version of the novel is preferable\\". So if you're a fan of the book you might be interested in reading both and making your own judgment.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|If you are a Guns N Roses Fan then you need to check out Bumblefoot's new album .This man is amazing! expect great things!!! Check it out Bumblefoot \\"Abnormal\\"
B00014K5TQ|4.0|Add this one to your movie marathon with Less Than Zero and Bright Lights, Big City.  It has that same feel as the earlier films except for the grisly real-life murder that ends the tale.  Performances are solid - particularly Green's - and the sets and costume design are great.  Chloe Sevigny, of course, is here - I mean she would have to be, wouldn't she?  Anyway, it is very entertaining in that falsely glamorous, trashy way.  Very good soundtrack.
B001JOIEZ4|4.0|I love the tracks by Paramore Muse and Linkin Park. I just wished that there were more Tracks on this and from Stephanie Meyer's Twilight playlist.
B001CO42MU|5.0|-BLOW-    When I first watched blow I was blown away by the story line it's just incredible. The man of gorge Jung   who persuade happiness or though he thought. It shows how it is easy to get rich selling drugs. But the     consequences are permanent. I would encourage little kids to watch this and decide for them self \\"do want two lives like this?\\" It's true that money is not everything George Jung thought he had a perfect wife and the perfect life. But with selling there's always twist and turns, it would     of bin a lot worse for George Jung. George Jung did crash on burn but he did not stop there. He tried to make things better but at the end he was set up and went to jail for the last time, for a long time. It's not easy     to get away from cops; they will always nail you for the big stuff. This is why I encourage for kids to watch this and see what kind of destruction the life of drug dealing can cause. The movie did paid respect to the chronology of George Jung's career. George's chronology is base on his life. The movie shows a lot of respect to George and     everything he did. It show respect to Jung's fans, the movies he been on and the people he was with. Jung has respect for Blow and his cast members and the director. Once I saw Blow, when George was an undercover cop. He really got in his character and he does show a lot of respect for     the movie. George's career might have some defining moments and significant events for his life and the movie.
B001H5X7KC|5.0|This is the only truly funny movie that Stiller has done since meet the Fockers. but To his respect this movie had me rolling the whole time. I actually pee'd a little. Even Tom Cruise Made me laugh and i usually sleep through his movies
B001ED7C58|1.0|I've been a fan of Twilight for three years now, and I've been envisioning this soundtrack since they announced there would be a movie.  This was the biggest disappointment I have ever heard!  With the internet, there are THOUSANDS of music opportunities, and I had SEVERAL in mind.  I think any true Twilight fan could have arranged a FAR better soundtrack than this.  They'd have done much better to find some good Indie bands.  -sigh-  The movie score had better be MUCH better, not that there's a standard to beat...    Honestly, don't waste your money, unless you just want another ornament for your CD shelf...
B0013ND30W|5.0|I consider this a must-have for:<br />-Baby Boomers who have kids<br />-If you have a DVD, BD, HDDVD collection.<br /><br />If you fit either one or the other of these two criteria but not both, then this is a 'maybe' and the economy may be the swing vote.<br /><br />If you fall into both, then I don't think you'll regret the purchase regardless (not irregardless; You know who you are!), of what shape your finances are in.
B001ED7C58|1.0|I have been counting down the days till the soundtrack was released.  WOW, what a waste of my time.  I am so upset because it is so utterly horrible expect for Linkin Park and Paramore and thats pushing it.  What really sent me over the edge was the crap they are trying to pass off as \\"Bellas Lullaby\\", listen to it.....and then picture Edward \\"TRYING\\" to hum this mess to Bella and then picture him jumping out of the window once she's asleep to go round up an orchestra!! Its just not at all what I expected.  Now as for Robs song(love him. handsome man)it sounds like his best friend just died, he drank himself into a drunken stupor in a dark corner, picked up his guitar and started slurring I mean singing!  Maybe its me but I couldn't understand a word he was saying!!    All in all, I don't like the soundtrack AT ALL!  I think that with all the Twilight hype that is happening they could have had Alvin and the Chipmunks singing the songs and everyone would have liked it. There should have been more effort and especially Heart & Soul poured into that soundtrack and unfortunalty the creators of it missed the bus.    Last but not least there are several hundred other audible songs they could have used, and that includes the wonderful female sisters KARMINA!!! Now those two know how to sing from theirs hearts!!
B001EN71DG|4.0|I think this is a great box set and love the fact that it contains both versions of each film. I had bought the older box set in '04 and was upset with some of the changes (like Hayden being seen in Return Of the Jedi). I let a friend borrow the set some years back and haven't seen it or him since, so I was relieved that this box set was released with both versions. Sure it lacks the bonus disc that the '04 release included, but fortunately for me that is the one disc that he didn't borrow so I still have it! lol
B001GAOY5U|5.0|This is one of those strange movies that catches your eye watching a trailor and then you actually cheak it out and get surprised how much fun it is to watch
B0017R5UAA|5.0|This record really defies description.  It's at the same time very baroque, very Indian influenced folk, and very prog-rock, in the vein of softer Yes.   Agreed, I do hear \\"Pet Sounds\\" era Brian Wilson and later Zombies mixed in -- But this record does a masterful job of not overloading the production with too many influences.  And the songs are extremely well constructed and performed.    I bought the 2 LP set that includes the \\"Sun Giant\\" EP, which also comes with a code to download the MP3s for both albums.    All and all, a very satisfying addition to my music collection.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Not a bad song on this CD.  If you are an Elvis lover this is a \\"must have\\" CD.
B001DHXT20|4.0|Incredible Hulk is a very well done movie, good pacing, well balanced. The romance aspect (Bruce-Betty) was believable and brought the counterweight to the thriller CGI parts. Supporting cast did excellent job, Tim Roth was great as grizzled warrior with not so much muscle on him.  One thing in which Lee's version had the advantage was action sequences. Lee's version had action \\"choreographed\\" better while in this movie some fights look too cartoonish and cheesy. The sequence when the two superhumans run and jump towards each other was silly and boring, for example.  At the end the problem Bruce Banner has was well realized with a sense of dread and almost hopelessness and all that simultaneous with Hulk gaining more respect and actual fame instead of infamy.  The film has a nice low key and dark visual style, almost reminiscent of low budget movies but at the same time being able to afford to pay full attention to details. Strong 4 out of 5.
B0011N1WE8|5.0|Simple fact Even with the pig nose I still thought she was hott. She could have a curly tail and shed still be hot. I hope she reads this and laughs so hard she oinks.... I mean snorts ohh and the movie was pretty funny too
B00004SA88|5.0|Paganini the first million dollar musician; anyone who loves the violin as much as I do, should purchase this set without hesitation. Accardo blows everyone away with these performances; his fingerboard is on fire. Accardo is one of the best today, if not the best. The range, tone, dynamics, and profoundness of his violin is only rivaled by a few of the greats. These performances are as the master, Paganini, would have played them. They are some of the most dynamic displays of violin playing the world has ever experienced. They are definitely in a class of their own. Also, the recording is excellent; it's crystal clear with Accardo's violin capturing an unbelievable sound quality; such range-WOW!. I know why Beethoven only wrote one violin concerto; how can you compete against Niccolo.
B0012GMXLU|4.0|Motorhead was big in Europe throughout the late 70's and 80's but did not make much of a dent here in the U.S.  Even their seminal early 80's album \\"Ace Of Spades\\" never charted on this side of the pond.  By the end of the decade though, Motorhead had developed a solid cult following in the States, and \\"1916\\" would prove to be the band's highest charting album up until their current resurgence in 2008.  The single \\"I'm So Bad Baby I Don't Care\\" even managed to get some airplay on American rock radio.  The album also features several songs that have become concert staples (\\"One To Sing The Blues\\", and \\"Going To Brazil\\") over the years.  This is really kind of a unique album for Motorhead as they move out of their hard rock comfort zone here and there, dabbling in electronics and keyboards with \\"Nightmare / The Dreamtime\\", and of all things a ballad about a soldier in WWI with the title track \\"1916\\".  In fact it is this track that really sets this album apart.  Lemmy actually sings on this one, (instead of his usual growl) and it is a great little portrait of the horrors of war.  Other highlights include \\"No Voices In The Sky\\", \\"Angel City\\" and \\"Love Me Forever\\" with a killer guitar solo from Phil Campbell.  My only complaint about this album is the recording.  Sonically this thing sounds like it was recorded in a tin can.  There is very little bottom end and listening to this on a good stereo system can really be distracting.  Other than that I think this is one of the band's best studio efforts.  If you are a fan of Motorhead, this one should be in your collection, but it could use a good remastering.
B00133KFGW|3.0|\\"August Rush\\" is the kind of film that everyone says you HAVE to watch, as it will 'change your life'. Despite being a fairly new release, it has achieved some sort of cult status on the home video circuit, and I predict that in a few years it will be up there with 'Field of Dreams' as a constant seller on DVD.<br /><br />That said, I am not one for sappy mediocrity and obvious sentimentality, and this movie has loads of it. From the opening five minutes to the absolutely useless climax (yes, I know it worked for many viewers, but I thought it ruined the film), every scene is worked in such a way that you can't help but see the end coming from a mile away.<br /><br />Jonathan Rhys Meyers is a fine looking human being, but he looked awkwardly out of place and insensitive in his role here, played out with obviously no passion. Far better is Keri Russell who plays the female lead - this is one actress who has so far been underutilized in general, and here she is no different. Freddie Highmore takes all the credit in his breakthrough performance here - its a finely nuanced performance by a young actor we should see more of.<br /><br />On the surface, \\"August Rush\\" is the sad tale of a child who believes his birth parents are out there somewhere. Both his birth parents are musicians, and the child inherits their musical genius. The final scene is a spectacle, where the young boy 'brings together' his parents under a brilliant night sky, all while conducting a symphony. Its glorious, beautiful, etc, but somehow it still did not move me. I guess the really bad performances by Meyers and Russell during the last five minutes really capsized the film, which is a pity. The last scene, which SHOULD be really powerful, just comes and goes.<br /><br />In the right hands, \\"August Rush\\" could have been an epic classic that could stand the test of time, and become a movie masterpiece. The way it is right now, its a sentimental middle-of-the-road film that could have been so, so much more.<br /><br />Three Stars. Five Stars for the unforgettable soundtrack.rs for the unforgettable soundtrack.

0684824906|5.0|Regardless of your political affiliations, if you are a political junkie and you want to see how great political minds work, this book is an absolute must-read...especially before Obama takes office.      While there are hundreds of biographies about Lincoln to choose from (and several good ones at that), this book examines Lincoln from the perspective of his diverse and often combative cabinet.  All of these men were great leaders in their own right, and Doris Kearns is very good about detailing each of their lives and how they built their political careers during the years leading up to the Civil War. And it's precisely this examination of each cabinet member, in parallel with Lincoln's rise in politics, that helps explain Lincoln's true genius as a politician.      A lot of people thought that Bush 43 was going to be a fairly adept President because of the immense amount of experience and knowledge his cabinet had.  But just having a smart staff in the White House doesn't mean the top executive is still going to make the right decisions.  And there's not a finer book on Amazon.com that demonstrates the RIGHT WAY a President employs his staff than \\"Team of Rivals.\\"    Seriously, you must read this book, before Jan. 20, 2009...it'll give you a lot more insight about the inner workings of the White House than any pundit or news show can give.  Eat your heart out, \\"West Wing!\\"
0007152590|5.0|John Gray teaches you in a wonderful way how men are different from women in the way they think and communicate.  I always recommend this book to those, especially men, so that they can stop being confused and hurt in relationships.  Did you know that men need to feel needed whereas women need to feel loved?  Did you know that men are turned off from women not trusting them?  Also, did you know that women's mood fluctuate like waves whereas men retreat in their \\"caves?\\"  Well, you will learn much more once you read this book!  I am no longer ignorant to understanding the difference in how men and women think and communicate... thanks John!

1416594884|3.0|To cite but one example, the central character Issa (who has spent a number of years incarcerated in Russian and Turkish jails being savagely tortured and brutally interrogated) is wearing a gold charm bracelet with a tiny gold Koran on it that he received from his mother. How did he manage to hang onto it after having spent years in Russian and Turkish jails?!    I know, it is a small thing. But the bracelet is referred to countless times and it becomes rather irksome after a while.
B001ED7C58|4.0|It's not as bad as people make it out to be.  There are some really great songs that you can look over the bad ones for.  Okay, let me tell you what I think of each song.<br />not in order:<br /><br />Supermassive Black Hole by Muse - 5/5 Love this song.  It really goes with this movie and I imagine(hopefully) the Cullens walking slow motion in the cafeteria to this song.  Lol, good stuff.<br /><br />Decode by Paramore - 5/5 I was never really a fan but I love it the more and more I listen to it.  I was surprised with Haley's vocal talents as well, she can really sing.<br /><br />Go All The Way(into the twilight) by Perry Farrell - 1/5 This song is almost laughable. This techno and disco song isn't going to cut it. Just because it has the word twilight in it doesn't mean it should be on the soundtrack!  It totally doesn't go and i'll be interested to see which part of the movie it's in.<br /><br />Flightless Bird, American Mouth by Iron & Wine - 5/5 One of my favorites.  This is totally a Bella and Edward song! Love the simple melody and somewhat confusing lyrics. Meadow scene anyone?<br /><br />Spotlight (Twilight Mix) by Mutemath - 3/5 Meh.  It's alright.  Not my style but im sure others can enjoy it.<br /><br />Never Think by Robert Pattinson - 4/5 It doesn't fit with the Twilight theme but this song was made a while ago and not for Twilight.  Good song on it's own and he has a really nice soulful voice.<br /><br />Tremble For My Beloved by Collective Soul - 4/5 Fun song. It doesn't fit with the sway of the album but it's still one of my favorites.<br /><br />I Caught Myself by Paramore - 4/5 Another one of those songs that gets better with every listen.<br /><br />Full Moon by The Black Ghosts - 5/5 Edward.

B000002NFM|5.0|Prodigy rocks the house as usual. Solid songs and a beat that never quits, propel this from start to finish. No fluff, no flutter, no puff, just a portable rave for your earphones, stereo speakers or laptop. Even technophobes will not be able to resist the infectious beats. This is one of those albums you will play many, many times and never tire of the music. Considering the price for used copies on AMZ, this is a true bargain.
B00102F5WK|4.0|Films that incorporate a solid political message along with outstanding performances are few and far between. The problem is incorporating the message without ramming it down the audience's throat. Or not losing the audience in a quagmire of politicalese. [[ASIN:B000IYV1ME Syriana]] suffered from the latter, while this one suffered only slightly under the strain of throat ramming and some poor character development (or minimal screen time).<br /><br />The film's premise is based on the U.S. legal maneuver known as \\"extraordinary rendition,\\" which, when translated, means the deportation of suspected terrorists to countries outside the U.S. for interrogation (see torture).<br /><br />Names, a person's birth country, and the color of one's skin come into play strongly, giving the flick a well-deserved sense of political bigotry. When Anwar El-Ibrahimi (Omar Metwally, [[ASIN:B00005JOIH Munich]]) comes back to the U.S. (his adopted home country) he is met at the airport by agents who quickly stuff him into a van and whisk him off to a far-away country. The big question is why? The reality is startling. When a U.S. agent is accidentally killed, the U.S. terrorists chasers want a scapegoat or, at the very least, someone to cop to helping the one who did it. And poor Anwar just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time (with the wrong name and skin color).<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal ([[ASIN:B000K7VHSM Brokeback Mountain]]) stars as a CIA operative who has to witness firsthand the \\"interrogation\\" of Amwar. Having been friends with the American who was killed, Douglas Freeman (Gyllenhaal) quickly loses his stomach for the methods used by the U.S.- backed, foreign interrogators.<br /><br />Back in America, Amwar's pregnant wife Isabella (Reese Witherspoon, [[ASIN:B000E8QVWY Walk the Line]]) is wondering why he hasn't returned home. Calling upon an old beau named Alan Smith (Peter Sarsgaard, [[ASIN:B001FFBI82 Jarhead]]) who works for Senator Hawkins (Alan Arkin, [[ASIN:B001JNNDDI Little Miss Sunshine]]), Isabella is given the runaround by the higher-ups regarding her husband's whereabouts. Finally given the name of a homeland security person named Corrine Whitman (Meryl Streep, [[ASIN:B000JSI7BM The Devil Wears Prada]]) she again butts heads with government silence on the policy of extraordinary rendition.<br /><br />Horrible and redeeming, RENDITION has plenty of strong actors who are given tidbit parts (except for Jake Gyllenhaal), giving much of the film an unidentifiable message from the standpoint of characters and our lack of caring for any of them.<br /><br />It is, however, well told. And the way the story works itself from beginning to end and then back again was pretty impressive (more of a parlor trick, though, but still fun to watch).ne]]), Isabella is given the runaround by the higher-ups regarding her husband's whereabouts.

B001KOD62O|5.0|I loved this episode very funny. The thing with the manic-depressive suicidal bear was way to funny. Supernatural as always is the best thing on t.v.
B001BKG9SK|5.0|Amazing concert, I was a little apprehensive about how Echoes could sound  when done live but, after hearing it, it's fantastic.    Anyone who enjoys Gilmour and the music of Pink Floyd will  want this set.    The only disappointment I have is that, when I purchased it about 2 weeks ago, it was $32, it has now been reduced to $27.  So much for my timing but it's more then worth it at twice the price.
B001G5IJVK|5.0|First, I want to say that I am beside myself at how many clueless people think that Gene and Paul have anything to do with any of these hits packages (like the people below who gave 1 and 2 star ratings). PAUL AND GENE HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS SET. THIER OLD LABEL OWNS THE RIGHTS TO THIER MUSIC. THEY CAN RELEASE WHATEVER THEY WANT, EVEN WITHOUT PAUL AND GENE'S CONSENT.  Now then, with that out of the way, I will admit that there are to many hits sets out for kiss, but this, now is easily the best. You get a full 15 song disc to represent each member, and at a reasonable price for a 4 disc set. Paul and Gene's discs are very thorough, but you get extra songs not usually on a hits set, such as Almost Human, Larger Than Life, Plaster Caster, Charisma, Take Me, All American Man, and Mr. Speed (Pauls most underrated song).  But you also get 2 solid discs of Ace and Peter material. And no, they are not mostly from the solo albums. Only 5 or 15 are from Ace's solo album, so you get some great Kiss material like Rocket Ride, 2 Sides Of The Coin, Save Your Love, Hard Times and Dark Light. And only 4 of 15 are from Peter's. So you get some decent Peter led Kiss tunes such as Baby Driver, Hooligan, Mainline, Strange Ways (written by Ace) and Getaway.  All that, along with thier usual songs that do appear on other hits albums, such as Shock Me, Talk To Me, Beth, Hard Luck Woman, and so on.  For someone who is interested in Kiss, but doesn't want to buy the whole catalog, this is the perfect set. You can't beat it.  Pual was interviewed by WRIF radio in Detroit last week, and he mentioned that Him and Gene had nothing to do with this set, but that he thought it was cool. So there you have it.
B001ESYAJY|4.0|David Arnold's fifth foray into the musical world of James Bond, his score for Marc Fisher's \\"Quantum of Solace\\", is another success, despite some views to the contrary.  It is a diverse though rather serviceable score that continues an on-going debt to John Barry, but is also clearly a work that shows how comfortable Arnold has become with this music. Both the film and music pick up with the events of the previous film, \\"Casino Royale,\\" and because of that both continue what is essentially an \\"origins\\" story, the beginning of James Bond, 007.  Thus some of the music reflects themes from the earlier film, and it should since characters and events from that film are essential to this one.  Arnold introduces one very nice new theme that pops up variously in the film (especially in \\"Night at the Opera\\"), and again he teases with his truncated use of the \\"James Bond Theme\\"; again there are suggestions and bits and pieces of it here and there but rarely a full explosion of it.  There is of course method to this (the continuing development of Bond himself), as with the previous film, and it works fairly well.  It is nice to have the title song, \\"Another Way to Die\\" by Jack White and Alicia Keys, on the soundtrack album, but it seems tacked on and somewhat obligatory.  It is not really tied to Arnold's score and that is too bad.  The production values are fine, but the packaging leaves a bit to be desired for a Bond epic.
0062511408|5.0|It's a great book.  I enjoy it so much that I read it in two days.  I will recomend this book to my friends and relatives.
B00005MP58|2.0|Everything that can be said about this superb story, production, acting, etc. has been said.  I was so disappointed, however, when I saw that the color in the DVD was really dreadful. Colin Firth had snow white skin, and pitch black hair and eyes, and poor Jennifer Ehle looked like a witch.  I had just about worn out my video when I bought the DVD - I guess I'll have to buy the video again.
B001FOPODS|5.0|I saw this on British television last Christmas season and am so glad to see it is finally being released in USA/Canada format. I do a big unit each year with my younger children in school on this musical composition, so this will be at the top of my wish list to order. I recommend it highly, as an antidote to the silly, sugary sweet Disney and other versions. It will appeal to your second and third grade students, and will engage and enthrall them with the animation and high production values.
B000WGYMAQ|5.0|An amazing movie that does justice to the original stage production.  Performances are wonderful.
1932907009|3.0|I read and studied the book and I believe it's good to get a feeling for the film structures. I can find the 3 act structure and most of the beats in films while having the beat sheet next to me although not every film seems to hit all the beats in my experience. Maybe this depends on genre (some genres are not using all the beats?) or maybe it depends on the way films are edited after being written.<br /><br />The book offers a lot of tools that can make a screenplay stronger. Personally, I still like to have other books next to it, like \\"Story\\" by Robert McKee and The Writer's Journey by Christopher Vogler. I believe that every book that you read about screenplay will make you think in another way about films and will help you write the next one even better.<br /><br />Andr&eacute;
B000R7HY0K|5.0|I really love these type of films and Tarantinos films. He is truly a great filmmaker. This movie is a bit slow but its fun, its also a great homage to all those exploitation and Grindhouse films.  Most people would not like this kind of film I can understand why but for me its genius.
0393062430|5.0|If you like \\"game theory\\" -- or want to know what game theory is -- this could be the best book out there.  Certainly there are more scholarly pieces on game theory, but this book is an A+ for its accessible writing, its use of examples that are interesting and a clear approach to point out how game theory comes into play every day for every person, whether we realize it or not.  This book helps you understand the decision process in cooperative and competitive situations.  It is better to know the \\"game\\" and how it is being played, than having the game played on you unwittingly.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />Also highly recommended, but more specifically for business applications, is Co-opetition, co-authored by Barry Nalebuff who is a co-author of The Art of Strategy.

I think if your a daria fan and cant stand the fact that MTV offers some ridiculous dvds (like carmen electra and dave navarro's wedding show) but not daria, you should email them too. Maybe if they get enough complaints they'll finally be motivated and realize what a mistake theyre making by denying us. Just go to the mtv store website click on the link for suggesting a product. It just kills me to know all the episodes are sitting over at mtv all dusty when there are so many of us desperate to see our favorite show again. so please, email mtv!
006113127X|5.0|Extolled author Charles Bukowski wrote 'Factotum' in 1975, but with all the references to World War II in it, the tale seems to be about an earlier time, just after the war (though this is more my opinion than fact).<br /><br />Henry \\"Hank\\" Chinaski is an alcoholic.  One step above skid row (and at times even closer than that) Hank's main concern in life is maintaining a job long enough to feed his addiction.  However, because of his addiction and his impulsive tendencies, Hank is never able to keep employment for any length of time.  Bukowski takes us with thought and feeling through Hank's life, wandering from job to job and woman to woman.  New Orleans, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Miami; wherever he goes, his addiction never allows any type of fresh start.  He walks off one job clearly stating he needed a drink, highlighting his careless outlook about employment in general.<br /><br />'Factotum' takes us step by step through a portion of Hank's life, most of it looking for work, and portraying his dysfunction at work and tapping into his inner reflections about the job and how much he can put up with before folding and getting that next drink.  Life slips by Hank as he contemplates his situations.  His is an hour-by-hour existence, without much thought to either past or future.  His closest female companion of the line-up he wades through with offhand affection is Jan, a woman with a hot temper and a lusty personality.  But Hank eventually loses everything he touches, and accepts it with an unrealistic serenity not usually found in human nature.  This isn't to say that Hank isn't at times violent, but his attitude about it lacks any firm conviction of it.<br /><br />Bukowski has written a intensely emotional novel in a quietly reflective tone.  His prose is almost poetry.  Who else could capture the reader so powerfully over the subject of a born loser and a personality normally avoided?  The book grabbed me from the beginning and kept me reading until I was finished.  They made a movie of the book in 2005, called 'Factotum' after the book, that was very good.  The movie reconstructs the order of Hank's life events, and updates the time from '75 to a more modern era.<br /><br />Some interesting quotes from the book are \\"Slow-paced, low-life urbanity and alcoholism\\" from the back flap, and \\"When you drank the world was still out there, but for the moment it didn't have you by the throat\\" from the content.  I loved this excerpt from page 188; \\"I bought an eight year old automobile and stayed on the job until December.  Then came the Christmas party.  That was December 24th.  There were to be drinks, food, music, and dancing.  I didn't like parties.  I didn't know how to dance and people frightened me, especially people at parties.  They attempted to be sexy and gay and witty and although they hoped they were good at it, they weren't.  They were bad at it.  Their trying so hard only made it worse.\\"<br /><br />I highly recommend both book and movie.  Enjoy!ing until I was finished.

1592400876|2.0|This book was recommended to me for my bad grammar, but it didn't do much to help. My problem with this book is that after you read it, you feel like a third-grader. I'd prefer less opinion and more instruction ,but that's not the case in this book. The author wants you to know her opinion but offers little instruction. If you want to read a rant on grammar then this is the book for you, but if you want a black-and-white approach with examples ( instead of someone repeatedly telling you how easy it all is)don't even think about using this book as a reference.
B001EC9V58|5.0|In addition to S. Banzhaf's advice regarding buying a cheap region-free DVD player (they're EVERYWHERE!!), I would strongly recommend signing up with Amazon.co.uk and buying this disc or any other PAL-only release from that site. As I write this, REC is selling for about $10 American with the shipping at about 6 bucks -- and they ship fast. Better yet, you even get a discount over UK customers -- something about not having to pay the VAT, whatever that is. So forget the marketplace (and eBay) sellers that are selling this for upwards of $30. They're probably getting THEIR stock from Amazon UK!
B00003CX5P|1.0|Loved Darth Maul.  Awesome character.  Wished he would have been used more.  Awesome intro and fight scene although it did seem un-Jedi-like to double team a single foe.  Jedi's at times seem to be master fighters and other times buffons.  Their fighting skills go up or down depending on who they are fighting.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I finished reading Breaking Dawn while listening to the CD. WOW. What an experience.  Never Think by Rob Pattinson is moving. The entire CD flows with the book. If the CD is this good, I can't image what the movie is going to be like.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|After reading the reviews I feel slightly better about myself...I saw it 6 times...it's my secret shame. But then I see others went multiple times too. I loved the singing, dancing and dialoge. It captures all stages of life and relationships. Finding and loosing the love of your life (and finding again), parent- child relationships and best friends. I don't think I stopped smiling for hours each time I saw it. A chance to escape the stresses of life, to get lost in the beautiful scenery, to bask in the good feelings, to bop to the music. This movie has it all. After the stresses of the election season & the economy, I look forward to my escape to the world of Mamma Mia. Actors were wonderful, voices were sharp, and fun was had by all. Highly recommend, 11 stars!
031606792X|5.0|This book will have you at the edge of your seat from start to finish.  In this book no one can predict what will happen, you will find out when you turn the page.  Stephenie Meyers is truly an amazing writer who draws you in and gives you the emotions of the characters. By far the best one...
B001DHXT1G|2.0|If you liked Iron Man, you will probably like this movie. They were very similar. I personally did not like either movie; although both had some good bits - overall neither really seemed to have a point to it. The antagonist seemed very fabricated - okay motivated by ultimate power okay whatever.     Same ultimate stand off at the end that tried to replace interesting choreography and imagination with just a bunch of roaring and throwing things and lots of veins popping out; which gets old fast. I was surprised since I've always taken the stand like really awesome special effects are fun to watch in their own right but the effects are all so monotonous it gets surprisingly boring to watch.    Dialog was stilted and dull. Edward Norton carried the movie to some extent because he is awesome; but it was more like in spite of rather than in any way facilitated by the directing.    The beginning of the movie up to about :20 was actually okay but the was no follow through and no plot ever developed, really. Like why does the conflict ALWAYS have to do with how they got their power? Why can't it just be - almost incidental that he's got this power; now tell a story that doesn't keep trying to crawl up its own you know what.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I had no interest in seeing this movie at first, because I am not crazy about the music.  It is one of my favorite movies.  I laughed the entire movie and LOVED the music.  At the end of the movie, the audience clapped.  This is on my wish list for christmas.
B00005JPO1|4.0|I love this movie. It really has a new feel to it, which is very different from the original trilogy (if you will). Lucas and Spielberg did the best job they could in re-introducing Indiana Jones into the 1950s.    This film was met with a lot of criticism for being \\"hokey\\" or \\"cheesy\\" and too much of a B-film. But if you look at \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\\" \\"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\\" and \\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\\" they are all made like B-films of the 1930s. They were are set up like those Saturday matinée serials. A cliffhanger every 15 minutes. This film is set up like those cheesy Sci-Fi movies of the 1950s. And it works.    The story gets a little dodgey at times, so it's not perfect. But for what it is, it's at least worth viewing.
B000VL9XE2|4.0|After buying BTBAM's Colors, I was telling a friend of a friend about how I really like it and he expressed his disgust for them saying they were too Mathy, like Dillinger Escape Plan. After I told him I had never listened to them, he quickly responded with \\"Yeah... DON'T.\\" I'm glad I didn't listen to him, because this CD is AWESOME! Some of the songs are a bit crazy, and take a few listens to get used to, but alot of them are straight up amazing. My only real gripe with this CD is that the tracks are often quite short, and the CD as a whole is short too. Although compared to Colors, alot of CDs are.
B001E75QH0|1.0|I love these movies and have collected them up to until now...I hate enhanced wide screen dvds...widescreen is fine, but enhanced wide screen with several inches cut off my screen makes it hard for people like me (1) who don't own a wide-screen TV (2) legally blind who can't go to the theater to see the movie.....very difficult to view the movies without being 2 inches from the TV set. I understand that the dvd industry is forcing people to buy these as their only choice if they want to own the movie, but they lost my business and I don't think I'm alone in wondering why both formats can't be offered on dvd sets..full and wide screen...so we the comsumer can actually feel like we are in control of choosing the type of product we would like to purchase instead of \\"settling\\" for all that we can get.  I am afraid that disabled people like me are going to lose out again.

0684803356|5.0|Filled with complex and interesting characters and written in Hemingway's characteristically simple, but effective style, For Whom the Bell Tolls is Hemingway at his best. There are few novels I would recommend more highly.    Hemingway's fascinating characters, from the American, Robert Jordan, to Pablo and Pilar, often referred to \\"the woman of Pablo\\" (if there can be one criticism of Hemingway, it is that his female characters are often simple; however, this is not true of Pilar), make this novel so wonderful, along with Hemingway's vivid descriptions of everything from the characters themselves to the horrors of war (one scene that comes to mind particularly is Hemingway's description of the execution of a group of fascists, who are beaten to death before being hurled from a cliff).    Although it is not a tale for the faint-hearted (forgive the cliche), For Whom the Bell Tolls is arguably Hemingway's greatest work. Anyone who enjoys Hemingway, McCarthy, or Faulkner should enjoy this novel.
0375842209|5.0|I loved this book. I was fascinated with how this book was written from Deaths point of view. The Book Thief painted a vivid picture of life in Germany during the years of Hitler's rule and how it affected all German citizens including the rich, the poor, the patriots, and the Jews. This has become one of my new favorites.
B0017HEYES|3.0|While the actual Disney film, surprisingly enough, the DVD was in Korean with English subtitles and also in poorly dubbed English with Korean subtitles.  The Korean language version was superior.  As this was the only true Disney verison of Pinocchio I found available on DVD, something was better than nothing (to the person for whom I purchased the DVD).

0143038419|5.0|I laughed and loved my way through this wonderful book.  Elizabeth Gilbert has written a charming book in three parts: Eat, Pray, Love.  You may have heard already but it's a great book.  It's fun, easy and inspiring.  I found that while I was reading, I was more enthused about my life.  It was warm and lovely to experience the lustiness of Italy, the serenity of India  and finally the sweetness of loving in Indonesia with this wonderful author.  I love books that lift my spirit.  I was on the very brink of buying a ticket to some exotic locale on the heels of this treasure.  But even better, this is one of those books that invited me to find those joys in my everyday life.  I recently read another book that does that lifting the spirit thing, too.  It's called [[ASIN:1888043180 Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment]] [ASIN:1888043180 Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment)] by Ariel and Shya Kane.  Enliven yourself, your day and your life by reading both of these books.

B0010YSD7M|5.0|\\"Stargate - Ark of Truth\\" feels like an extended episode of Stargate SG1, wrapping up the plot line of what some folks have called \\"The Ori Quagmire\\".<br /><br />No spoilers from me, but you get pretty much what is expected including great special effects, a lot of action, close calls, and Teal'c being ever so... well Teal'c like :-)<br /><br />It is a good wrap-up to the outstanding series [[ASIN:B000TJBNHQ Stargate SG-1 - The Complete Series Collection]], and I also recommend [[ASIN:B0017MO10U Stargate: Continuum]] for those that want a little more.<br /><br />Highly recommended for Stargate SG1 fans!
0312370849|4.0|This is a moving book, particularly because it is so intimate.  This is the story of one woman's suffering and that makes all the difference.  I liked the structure of the novel, intertwining modern and past narratives not only because I felt like I got two stories in one, but because it underscored an important theme in the novel - that of never forgetting.  I think the tragedy of Sarah's story is that she tried to forget and discovered that you really can't put things behind you - you can only find some way of incorporating tragedy into life.  Very effective.
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|Cloverfield surprised me. I was expecting a Godzilla type movie and it acted more like the Blair Witch Project. It was done with a handheld throughout the movie and it gave it a great scary feel for the movie. It also helps that the creature was seldom seen and when it did show up it made you jump out of your seat.
B000ZLFALI|1.0|This film is utterly painful. The dialogue is abysmal, the plot non-existent, the \\"hallucinatory\\" special effects sequences laughable, and the Beatles songs are crudely shoehorned in whether they fit or not, complete with some of the worst choreography I've ever seen in a film. I've liked Julie Taymor's other films, but she scraped the bottom of the barrel on this one. As far as recreating a vision of the late 60s, this film makes HAIR look like CITIZEN KANE in comparison. If you want to see a brilliant film that uses classic popular music as its core, check out Todd Haynes' I'M NOT THERE, but avoid this piece of crap at all costs...

Who says children can only have these dreams at this time of the year?? This will be nice to put on while gearing up for the season, putting up trees, etc. I think this will compliment the Windham Hill Winter Solstice and Narada Holiday compilations quite nicely!!

068483605X|5.0|Of all the editions I have to favor the new cover for the paperback with the beautiful paining of the gate and downs.  Not available in hardcover!  After much shopping I picked up this hard cover version and was very very happy.  A beautifully made book with truly great binding, paper, and cover (with or without the dust jacket).  I'd still like to see the modern non-mass market cover in hardcover form but if you are going to gift Watership Down (as you all should) this is the most beautiful and quality printing available.  In today's world of cheap books you hold this baby and I actually went \\"ohh\\" a really great gift edition.

0575077174|5.0|The House of Suns by Alastair Reynolds reconfirms his status as the preeminent writer (equalled perhaps only by Iain M. Banks) of our age.<br /><br />Unlike him, I am a poor writer and wont go into plot summaries here and will leave that to other reviewers.<br /><br />What I can say is that after reading every other Reynolds novel, I could not wait for House of Suns to be released in the US and ordered this from the UK.  It absolutely did not disappoint.  It is an epic science fiction novel, a meditation on what it means to be human and a love story.<br /><br />My only complaint about House of Suns is that now I am not sure when I shall have another Reynolds book to read. :(<br /><br />Alastair, if you read your reviews on Amazon for some reason...please continue your explorations of the House of Suns universe (and redo the ending of the Revelation Space series)!
0385340990|5.0|The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society will appeal to anyone who loves to read about courage, integrity, kindness, love, literature, and happiness. Written as a series of letters among the characters, the book will also charm those who enjoy getting to know people through what they reveal in writing.<br /><br />It would be easy to spoil this gem so I'll reveal as little as possible. In the first letter dated 8th January 1946, author Juliet Ashton writes to her publisher, Sidney Stark, about the results of her book tour for Izzy Bickerstaff goes to War and her new book, English Foibles. It turns out she's tired of being a light-hearted journalist. From there, we trail Juliet as she eventually finds her subject through an unexpected letter from a Guernsey farmer, Dawsey Adams, who owns an old book of hers, Selected Essays of Elia by Charles Lamb, which had her name and former address written inside the front cover. Like Alice when she went down the rabbit hole, that letter opens up a whole new world . . . and set of experiences . . . relating to the English Channel island of Guernsey which was occupied by German forces during World War II.<br /><br />Unlike literary letters (say of Virginia Woolf), these letters are more often chatty and informative than witty. But each letter opens the door into the hearts and minds of the characters in deeper ways than can occur in the normal narrative of a novel. You will feel like you are solving a mystery at times. You'll even get to know characters quite well that don't write any letters.<br /><br />I found myself torn between wanting to race to the end . . . and wanting to savor the pleasure of each letter. The latter instinct prevailed.<br /><br />The letters are short, and you could read most of them in two minutes or less. Even if you are frequently interrupted, you will get right back into the story.<br /><br />There's a clear possibility of a sequel here. I look forward to it!
B0017HL1CQ|5.0|I have purchased a few different \\"box sets\\" from bands before (Nirvana - With the Lights Out; U2 - Joshua Tree rerelease; NIN - And All That Could Have Been) and this one really takes the cake. I purchased this set when the free download was happening and it was completely worth it! It comes with 2 CDs, 2 LPs, and a 12\\"x12\\" book of interesting microscopic art (I think). The CDs include the original 10-track album on Disk 1 and a completely other album on Disk 2. The first review here described it well as a complete album in its own right. This rather than the traditional - collection of tracks that were not good enough to make it on the \\"real\\" album. My favorite songs from In Rainbows are still the last two on the original disc. But tracks like Bangers & Mash and 4 Minute Warning are fantastic! Down is the New Up will get stuck in your head all day without being annoying. But as all radiohead it is best appreciated as a whole album rather than a collection of single tracks.    The 2 LPs include the original 10 tracks of the original album and do not include the \\"bonus\\" disc songs. They are fantastic quality.  I listen to a lot of records (mostly old ones from the 70s) but I am not a audiophile/LP-snob so some of you might be more familiar with this than I am - the records are \\"full-size\\" but you play them on 45-speed. I assume this increases the amount of information that can be used in a single second of play. (Sorry if that makes no sense). They are also much thicker and more substantial than any of my other records. As you can probably guess a 2-disc set for 10 tracks means you are flipping alot. But I found the divisions in the music are very logical (musically). I really enjoy the songs paired in this manner. I can start disc 1 side 2 with Faust Arp and be asleep by the time House of Cards finishes.    I don't know if it is worth the $200 price a bunch of people are asking for here on Amazon but it is definitely a quality set for anyone who loves radiohead!
B001G9LVGG|5.0|I adore Lorenna McKennitt. I started listening to her about 12 years ago and there is no one that even comes close to her. I also love Christmas music. I have just under 100 Christmas CDs and this was my instant favorite. Emmanuel is incredibly simple and incredibly beautiful. Thanks Lorenna. PLEASE keep writing and recording!

B000SO7OM0|5.0|I had the album for quite a while before I played the DVD. It's fantastic and maybe the first time I understood where all these amazing sounds come from. The music is wonderful, many of the songs I like even more than the studio version (how often does that happen?). But don't miss the DVD, it's simply amazing!
0375704027|5.0|It was kind of autobiographic, I guess. The characters are so lonesome, weird, emotional cripples and so needy.  Is not the story that it's so great about this book, is the way he is guiding the reader through an awkward journey of emotions and feelings.  You will not have a way out and you'll feel absolutely close to all of the characters
B001H5X7JS|4.0|There are few comedies out there that will get me to do anything more than chuckle mildly. Almost none will have me actually laughing out loud. Tropic Thunder manages to do that.    The movie centers around a group of actors sent to Vietnam to film a war movie about a soldier (Nick Nolte, looking like... well, his mugshot), who lost his hands in a rescue mission while saving his buddies. Each of actors comes equiped with a massive ego and soon the director, Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan), has lost all control of of the film. After a serious chewing-out by his boss, a barely recognizable and hilarious Tom Cruise, he takes his men out into the jungle and leaves them there, planning to film them using a bunch of minicams.    Then he steps on a mine.    The rest of the movie consists of the cast, led by Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr, in his second great role of the year), planning a method actor who in no way resembles Russell Crowe, washed-up action star Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller, who also directed), and Jack Black as an actor who has made his career doing fart-joke movies and is addicted to just about every drug knowns to man, trying to get their way out of the jungle.    It's a simple enough description for the film, but it doesn't even begin to touch on the genius in the movie, which is preceeded by several trailers and an add for a fake energy drink peddled by a rapper, Alpa Chino (Brandon T Jackson), who is trying to use the film as a way to break into a new industry.    The film is very clever about Hollywood, featuring a great scene between Tugg Speedman's agent, played by Matthew McConaughey, and Tom Cruises' character, as well, as the wonderful fake trailers, and plenty of commentary on what it takes to win an Oscar (\\"You never go full-retard,\\" advises Robert Downey Jr's character).    Overall a great film, and one I'd recommend to just about anyone!
0930289234|2.0|I used to collect comics all through the 80's and halfway through the 90's.  My friends had raved about this comic, but I never bought the title.  After hearing that the movie was going to be released soon, I got the graphic novel and was ready to get blown away.<br /><br />Well, I was underwhelmed.  The art was good, but it seemed like I had seen it before even though the name didn't jump out at me.  I took a look at his other titles but hadn't read any of the other comics.  The story seemed to drag on for me and it took quite a while for me to finish because I felt bored.<br /><br />I couldn't associate with any of the characters and I wasn't rooting for anybody (hero or villain).  It would be like meeting a group of people and knowing right away that you wouldn't get along with them.  So you cut your losses and never see them again.  But I had to unfortunately keep going so I could see how it ends.  But not in the suspense type of feeling, but because I thought maybe their was a glimmer of hope.  Nope, I got there and thought those are many hours I won't get back.<br /><br />I'll wait for the movie on DVD, hopefully Hollywood can at least make this movie palatable.  They do have a knack to sensationalize things and this is one story that NEEDS it.
0743298039|5.0|This was not my \\"type\\" of book, but I loved it.  From the Victorian style writing to the true mystery surrounding the characters and the eerie details of the story, it was just a great read.  The ending could have been shorter, but everything else was great.
B0016Q2D5M|3.0|I'm not sure that Jules Verne, who was a stickler for scientific detail - be it imaginary or real - would think too highly of this film, even though it's not a true adaptation of his original novel.  In this cinematic world, scientific fact is the equivalent of a prize greased pig - everyone keeps chasing it, but no one ever catches it.  If you're going to throw realism to the curb, though, you might as well do it in unabashed grand style - and that is precisely what you get in this 21st century Journey to the Center of the Earth.  What you have here is your basic summer-time action comedy.  These guys survive falls that Wile E. Coyote couldn't walk away from.  Fortunately, the whole thing is entertaining enough to overcome all of the inanities that could otherwise have doomed this film into forgettable silliness.  In other words, it's a Brendan Fraser movie.  Every time I see Brendan Fraser in a movie, my immediate reaction is to say uh oh and expect the worst - yet every time I actually end up feeling entertained.  That's not to say this is a good movie - it's more of what I call a \\"good enough\\" movie.<br /><br />Fraser plays Trevor Anderson, a volcanologist dedicated to continuing his late older brother's studies.  Max apparently got himself killed searching for the lost world described in Verne's novel, believing that the father of science fiction was describing fact and not fantasy.  Just when his lab is stolen out from under him and all seems to be lost, a 10-day visit with Max's son Sean (Josh Hutcherson) brings with it new clues in the form of notes inside Max's copy of Verne's novel - and this leads uncle and nephew to discover a new site in Iceland they simply have to explore.  The scientist they want to check with in Iceland turns out to be dead, but his hot redheaded daughter Hannah (Anita Briem) agrees to guide the two up the mountain to the site.  Of course, they end up trapped by a cave-in and forced to explore the mountain cave system in search of an exit.  They find a lot more than that, though.<br /><br />The film's myriad of CGI effects aren't all that impressive in 2D, but I'm sure the 3-D version must pack much more of a punch.  Either way, though, I was surprised at how few \\"prehistoric\\" creatures there were on display.  For example, I expected to see people running from dinosaurs all over the place, but there's basically just one giant monster to be found here.  The characters' falls are worth watching, though, especially the first big one.  If there's a longer falling scene in any other movie, I haven't come across it yet.  A roller coaster-like ride in an old mine system is also great fun to watch - and the adventure doesn't end there.  Some critic said this film was made as if it were a theme park ride, and I think that sums the whole thing up quite well..  They find a lot more than that, though.

B00132D808|5.0|Great retro sound.  Great variety.  Great composers and performers.  Can't wait for the next album.
B001FBSMW6|5.0|I have been a Keane fan since their first album and I have to say that Perfect Symmetry is amazing. It is one of the few bands I'd buy an album from without having heard a single song first (in fact when I bought it I hadn't actually heard anything yet!). The songs are great, somewhat brighter than Under the Iron Sea (which is good). It is true that some songs have a bit of an 80's feel but really well achieved. Don't listen to folks who didn't like it, they are all deaf. Order this album right now! I guarantee you'll listen to it at least 5 times in a row in your car.
B001C4AFP8|3.0|The craftsmanship behind director Ridley Scott's 2008 convulsive political thriller is impressive, but having acts of terrorism drive an intentionally labyrinth plot reveals how they impede the story structurally, an insurmountable barrier that screenwriter William Monahan ([[ASIN:B000M341QE The Departed]]) can't seem to overcome. The movie's first half is all the more bewildering for all the double-crosses and cover-ups that serve to set up the central situation. Based on Washington Post columnist David Ignatius' popular [[ASIN:0393334295 2007 novel]], the movie focuses on embedded CIA operative Roger Ferris who is on an undercover assignment to hunt an Al-Qaeda terrorist leader named Al-Saleem. Ferris is not entirely alone as he is connected via cell phone with his stateside boss Ed Hoffman, who is the head of the CIA's Near East division and directs Ferris toward life-threatening tasks in a most nonchalant manner from his upscale suburban home.<br /><br />The plot's impetus is driven by the elusive Al-Saleem's unblinking series of suicide bombings in Europe in response to the invasion by US and UK troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. The movie gets more interesting when Ferris decides to work with Jordanian intelligence director Hani Salaam, an erudite, enigmatic figure who is well entrenched in the Middle East militia and appears to take a page from Mario Puzo's [[ASIN:0451205766 The Godfather]] when it comes to loyalty and betrayal. Of course, it's a matter of course that Ferris' loyalty is tested when an elaborate plan is hatched to create a bogus competing terrorist group and use an unwitting Dubai architect as the head. The other complicating factor is that Ferris has fallen for pretty Iranian nurse Aisha when he gets treated for possible rabies at a clinic. It becomes inevitable that she also becomes a pawn in the political intrigue. Scott paints his canvas with a lot of graphic violence from large-scale bombings to more intimate acts of torture.<br /><br />All of the external elements are fitting, but they can't seem to masquerade the convoluted and often clich&eacute;-ridden plot at the film's core. A solid cast goes a long way to compensate for the plot holes. As Ferris, Leonardo DiCaprio applies his trademark wiry energy to an intensely compelling performance that could have shown a bit more variety. Adding fifty belly-stretching pounds to his frame, Russell Crowe, Scott's favorite leading man ([[ASIN:B00009ZYBY Gladiator]], [[ASIN:B0011HOEY4 American Gangster]], [[ASIN:B000LXHK2C A Good Year]]), plays the Arkansan Hoffman as a scene-stealing character part. The irony is that the Australian actor's Southern accent is more convincing than DiCaprio's. Their antagonistic interplay, played out mostly on the phone, is rather predictably developed. Fetching Iranian actress Golshifteh Farahani provides gratefully calm relief to the ongoing mayhem as Aisha, although her character comes across as a mere plot device. There is a nicely fractious dinner table scene with Ferris and her judgmental older sister, although the movie plays down the more human-size hostilities in favor of the pyrotechnics.<br /><br />As Hani, Mark Strong ([[ASIN:B000Y7U98C Sunshine]], [[ASIN:B000WZAE1I Stardust]]) leaves the most vivid impression of the cast but for the most old-fashioned of cinematic reasons - he plays what could be a villainous figure as a suave, mysterious man of honor who is completely on top of his job, an intentional counterpoint, at least physically, to Crowe's slovenly Hoffman. The film's resolution defies credibility, but it finally becomes clear that Monahan is not interested in exposing the factors that have driven the Middle East political maelstrom into acts of escalating terrorism. Rather, his screenplay shows that testosterone-driven Hollywood-style entertainment can take place anywhere.elements are fitting, but they can't seem to masquerade the convoluted and often cliché-ridden plot at the film's core.

B000EUDAWG|4.0|This guy is a real blast when he unexpectedly crawls out from under a chair, but watch out lest he get stomped by someone in fear, ha ha.

He appears most realistic if you paint over his light up eyes with thick black paint and control him using repeated short pushes on the buttons on the remote control.
B0013LPS8Y|2.0|If you are like me, finding it harder to pursue one's hobby of pretty wee boys, then you too, probably, were first aroused to U2 by their delightful cover art. Underneath the sexy cover lies a CD with some good music on it.    First track \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" epitomizes them lazy Sunday afternoons. When nothing is open, and there is nothing to do. When you think to yourself \\"Sigh! Sunday BLOODY Sunday\\" and you almost (hahahaha not really) cannot wait for the next day - Monday. The drummer is clearly aware of Bona's ironic stance, with military drumming as this humerous first track's backdrop.    Unfortunately it is all down-hill from there, as the singer gets comfused and thinks that we are all about to be nuked, and that it is somehow wrong in a \\"it is your fault you bastard\\" way that refugees are smoldering upon borders.     However, the last track 40 inches is a life saver. Not only because one is near the end, but also for its reprise upon the post-ironic metaphor of \\"Sunday. Bloody Sunday\\".    This could be the sound that the new millenium has been craving like chocolate for all I know. But, if all else fails you can always stare endlessly at the little boy on the cover, imaging what you would love to do but cannot because your rational brain won't let you.    Good effort U2, you should go a long way, even if the music isn't my cup of coffee.
B00133KFGW|5.0|This is a great movie. Heartwarming and touching. I see the negative reviews and also see people trying to be Siskel and Ebert. Yes maybe a little predicting but who cares. Overall it's got great actors including the colorful Robin Williams, great music and a fantastic ending. So if your not into disecting movies to death then I would give this one a try.
B0000004V2|1.0|From the opening track, \\"I Want To Be A Dog\\" to the blasphemous finale - \\"I am an erection\\", this album struts along the dandy-lions like butter dripping on lead.<br /><br />Absolute rubbish if I was being honest, I'd rather eat a can of worms than listen to this nonsense again. The 2nd track \\"He who bangs the drums\\" was awful, it reminded me of everything that was bad about the 80s: shiny guitars, reeling drums, and a singer who sounds like a cross between Ricky Steve and Bobby Carlton.<br /><br />Don't waste your time lads. Go and check out those heady early days when E.L.O. lit Lucy in the pie with diamonds. Spiffing! In a word.
B001GQSY5U|1.0|After a prequel trilogy that was mediocre at best, the Star Wars universe has now hit rock bottom with the Clone Wars animated feature film.  Anyone hoping to have their faith renewed in the Star Wars franchise with the removal of George Lucas from the creative helm will quickly be disappointed by this film.  Anyone hoping to enjoy an hour-and-a-half of sci-fi fun will also be disappointed.  Not only do the filmmakers recreate all the mistakes Lucas made in the the prequel trilogy, they make plenty new ones of their own.    The plot of the film places a Padawan learner into Anakin's training.  Their relationship begins with constant bickering and never moves beyond this.  We saw the same thing from Anakin and Obi-Wan in Episode II and if you were annoyed by it then I assure you this is only more of the same.      Even the film's action sequences do nothing to save it from the lack of character development.  All are long, and most of them are boring.  And this is coming from a self-described lightsaber junkie!      As you can tell I take my Star Wars seriously.  Yes I am an adult, but I often enjoy other sci-fi and comic related cartoons.  If you are an adult looking for good animated action I recommend Justice League season 2 as a starting point.      If you are a parent thinking of purchasing this for your kids there are much better options available for your hard-earned dough than this.

B00005JLT5|5.0|I don't often watch contemporary films because I find most of them to reek of crummy Hollywood fluff -- this one is different, MUCH better! I'm stingy with awarding stars for films too but this one really deserves all the accolades that I can pile on.<br /><br />It's simply the story of a European Jewish guy who just wants to be a pianist. He clearly has the playing skills of Chopin and he's totally focused upon his art until WW II intervenes... thus, the viewer can anticipate his forthcoming experience(s).<br /><br />This film is a bit of a sleeper -- at least I've never heard folks talking about it much... certainly not to the level it deserves. It's really incredibly well-conceived, punctuated with terrific acting and brilliant cinematography. I was totally drawn in to this one. If you have a big-screen television, this will manifest an even greater bonus for you given the great film footage.<br /><br />I was so impressed with this film and the score that I also bought the soundtrack: [[ASIN:B00007E8SQ The Pianist: Music from the Motion Picture]]<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B000MNP2KI|1.0|I didn't care to watch it when it was in theaters and I was right. I just watched it on DVD and really sorry for the time wasted. Staring at the wall for 2 hours would be more rewarding.    The movie is a set of disjointed action sequences (which are nothing special by themselves) following each other with no rhyme or reason. Daniel Craig is another in the line of impostors unsuccessfully trying to fill Sean Connery's shoes (even Pierce Brosnan was better then DC, and PB wasn't very good either). Other characters are not even 2-dimensional - they are one-dimensional. Really bad acting all around. I was constantly annoyed by something until I figured out what it was: facial expression of the actors when they were saying their lines was irrelevant to what they where doing.
055350259X|5.0|I ran into this audio book on a used mp3 player I bought,,hmm hmm on ebay. Rather than just delete everything, I thought should check things out. I don't get time to read books, though I would like to. I have audio books, but never have time to listen to them either. One title was Bill Bryson. Never heard of him, but I had a few hours to listen to my mp3 payer. So I may as well check out the books that were on there.  The author had kind of a British accent. I don't like british accents that much. They annoy me., alot. (crippes, now im writting like him))) After a short listen to this book not even starting from the beginning of the book, I could not put this down. The intelligents and style of writting/speaking was informitive, clear and humorous along with the vivid immagination of views of what he was talking about. Yes, several laughs out loud with the ear-bud mp3 player headphones on. I recommend this to anyone who appriciates some history,humor,life and a chance to get away from it all. If you like travel or just basic human behavior, you should love it. I would love for my family to hear this book.
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|Introduction: The very first impression Cloverfield is bound to give many viewers, is a return of Roland Emmerich's 1998 adaption of Toho's Iconic [[ASIN:0767817478 Godzilla]] or maybe even a run of the mill teen-horror film, due to the youth of its actors and actresses your won't recognize unless you've watched certain television shows or movies. Better yet, if your fan of ABC's long running series LOST and you know who the producer is, then you bound to believe that its connected to the series itself. That said, I was among the many who caught the teaser trailer when it premiered in theaters the three days after [[ASIN:B00005JPNO TRANSFORMERS]] was released July 3d 2007. I thought it was sequel to Godzilla. However, the only thing Cloverfield has in common with anything mentioned above is that its produced by J.J. Abrams and is, more or less, a homage to Giant Monster movies of old. Because lets face it, monster movies are made as often as westerns are now-a-days if you don't include the latter's small revival this and last year.      Plot: Filmed in the style of a home movie, Cloverfield begins on the day of April 27th. Rob Hawkins (Michael-Stahl David) and Beth (Odette Yustman) McIntyre are awakening from a night spent in her father's apartment in the Time Warner Center. On the spur of the moment, Rob decides to take Beth to Coney Island. The video then fast-forwards to May 22nd. Lily Ford (Jessica Lucas) and Jason Hawkins (Mike Vogel) are preparing a farewell party for Jason's brother, Rob, who is departing for Japan after being promoted to vice-president of a Japanese company he works for. Originally burdened with job of recording testimonials (farewell) messages for Rob, Jason carts the job off to his brother's friend, Hud Platt (J.T. Miller), who reluctantly agrees to take the job with the promise of his long-time crush, Marlena Diamond (Lizzy Caplan), coming to the party at the behest of Lily. When Rob and his best friend, Beth McIntyre arrive to party,the film reveals that Rob has slept with Beth and thus created a rift between them, by shunning her (so to speak). Jason and Hud go to \\"comfort\\" Rob about the situation, but their attempt to console him is suddenly interrupted by a mysterious earthquake. When the group travels to the roof to inspect the situation, they are caught off guard by an explosion that sends flaming debris down on them and the statue of liberty's head rolling into the streets of New York shortly thereafter. The group attempts to leave the city via the Brooklyn Bridge, but the bridge is attacked by a hulking creature of a indescribable nature. Against the pleads of his friends, (who eventually decide to follow him), Rob decides to go after Beth after receiving a distressed phone call from her despite the danger lurking inside the city.        Overview: The storyline for Cloverfield is simplistic and straight forward; The beginning, specifically plays out like an episode of TheWB's Felicity (a tale of troubled relationships, romantic advice, and unrequited crushes). It never tries to dazzle you with an explanation to the events occurring in the film. Its told completely from the point of view of the civilian, thus there's no suitable explanation beyond the speculation of the characters. I think this is one of the things that works to the film's advantage. The lack of explaning as to what's happening keeps the film from being bogged down by the disbelief that most Monster movies are regarded with. If you didn't follow the movie's then-contagious Viral Marketing Campaign, then you'll may or may not be confused on some points. The atmosphere that surrounds the film is, at first a welcome lure of security and complacent within itself. Quite honestly the first half hour will have you wondering why you bothered to watch Cloverfield in the first place. Rest assured, once the main event begins, it will catch the viewer off guard --- destroying the security the film established in the beginning. Confusion and fear will be your companion and the lack of explanation only intensifies an already frightening situation.       Directed by Matt Reeves (writer/director for The Pallbearer (1996), and TheWB's [[ASIN:B00005JLJS Felicity]]), Cloverfield moves fast and hard once it gets started, but is severely lagged down by its half hour introduction of the main players of the central storyline, which I think words to advantage in some ways. Without it, you really wouldn't couldn't care whether or not the characters, already established in their personalities and lives, would live or die. (Depending on the person.) Which begs the question as to why it wasn't just a half-hour longer. Nevertheless, Reeves' straightforward direction works to the movie's advantage. As mentioned a dozen times before, Cloverfield is filmed and performed to something akin to [[ASIN:B00001QGUM [The] Blair Witch Project (1999)]], utilizing the amateurish camera work and crooked camera angles. However its quality its on par with that of the general motion picture image. Clear, mostly unfuzzy and not so frenetic or sloppy.      The Visual/Special effects implemented in the film by Double Negative (Batman Begins, Shaun of the Dead) and Tippett Studio (Consantine, The Spiderwick Chronicles) are fantastic. While there are obvious moments where the FX is plainly obvious, they managed to make their CGI blend in near-seamlessly with the real world environment of \\"New York City\\". The creatures (designed by Neville Page) themselves, the centerpiece of the film, are amazing. The photo-realism of their appearance are brilliantly crafted and the greatest achievement in the movie overall. One notable aspect of Cloverfield is the lack of an Orchestral Score. The closest to a soundtrack that this film has is several pieces of popular pop/rock singles played in the background of the farewell party in the beginning. The only actual score featured in the film is the \\"ROAR! (Cloverfield Overture)\\" by Michael Giacchino(LOST, Speed Racer), a powerful and romantic orchestrated theme that serves as a nod to the late Akira Ifukube's Godzilla (Gojira) Theme of 1950's without sounding terribly like it.     When concerned with the performances from the actors in the movie, I half expected them to be the weakest part of the film. While it may take a second viewing to fully appreciate the acting, I was pleasantly surprised by how well everyone did in this film. This group of little known actors, consist of the likes of Jessica Lucas ([[ASIN:B0009F43DG Life as we Know it]], CSI, The Covenant), Lizzy Caplan (CBS' The Class, and [[ASIN:B0002IQJ8W Mean Girls]]), Mike Vogel (Poseidon, Grounded for Life, 2003's [[ASIN:B00018D44K The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]] [Remake]), Michael Stahl-David (NBC's terribly irsh-ganster-cliched The Black Donnellys), stand-up comedian T.J. Miller (ABC's Carpoolers) and Odette Yustman (UPN's South Beach, and ABC's October Road). All of which give way-above \\"average\\" performances in their respective character roles. What will be held against them of course (besides being worthy of being Magazine Ad models) is the fact that most of their performances consist of sobbing, running and screaming at the monster lurking in the dark. But even when their doing this, their performances come off as believable and natural. Something I appreciated in the aforementioned TV series, Felicity.      The natural performances from the large cast of actors; The ability to come off as genuine while in the guise of their characters for four long seasons. This sort of acting translates excellently in the film. The actors many have been charmed by, is the semi-recognizable Lizzy Caplan (arguably the only vetran-character actor, first to Mike Vogel) and T.J. Miller; Their chemistry, comedic chops, and rapport on-screen pays off in more ways than one, most likely due to the heavy use of improvising. Performances I was particularly concerned with were the ones coming from Jessica Lucas and MikeVogel, both of which have starred in movies where I never paid too much attention to them in. Jessica Lucas, more than proves that she is worthy of becoming of a brilliant actress with her under appreciated performance as Lily Ford. While Mike Vogel, as usual, is far too convincing in the role as the laid back and rather lazy older brother of Rob Hawkins, Jason; a man who hands out \\"wiser-than-you-should be\\" advice to his troubled younger sibling. Its one of his better performances despite his lack of screen-time, certainly not one to be ignored. And before I forget, Michael Stahl-David and Odette Yustman (the focal characters of the film), give great performances as estranged friends (or lovers) struggling to reconcile their differences in the middle of an unexpected disaster.     Overall, Cloverfield is an excellent film that falls into the \\"love it or hate it\\" category. Its certainly not for anyone looking for an straight-forward monster-movie in the way of Godzilla and King Kong, especially if your think of it as an \\"Gimmick(y)\\" sort of film. For me, all the elements utilized in Cloverfield fell into place and left quite the lasting impression on my memory. My biggest problem with the film, falls down to its length. Once you realize how short it is, you'll wish it was longer. And with the word of mouth already spread about the general public about this film, in the end, your enjoyment of Cloverfield will probably come down to your ability to suspend your disbelief and how well you can stand a film not filmed in the proper motion picture style. A highly recommended movie.  --- [4 out of 5].
1568987846|5.0|In December 2006, Maria Alexandra Vettese and Stephanie Congdon Barnes each happened to take a photo in the morning and upload it to Flickr. Noticing the coincidence of the common theme, the two women agreed to an artistic partnership: for the full calendar year of 2007, each woman took a photo every day before 10 a.m. and posted it to a blog called 3191. Because they live respectively in Portland, Maine and Portland, Oregon, they have only met in person twice.<br /><br />Now 236 of the pictures appear in [[ASIN:1568987846 A Year of Mornings: 3191 Miles Apart]]. The commonplace subjects, arranged in date-paired diptychs, weave a quiet spell of daily life. Jam on bread, braided hair, a cloud-filled sky, each beautifully composed in both senses of the word. Often there's a surprising correlation between the two pictures, either of subject or of layout. They capture the best aspects of morning: peace, renewal, the pleasure of small quiet things. They are little marvels of thoughtful observation.<br /><br />Five stars for a book that expresses keen artistic vision and a true 21st century partnership. Vettese and Barnes are now collaborating on daily evening photos, which can be seen on their blog 3191 A Year of Evenings. Visit and enjoy.<br /><br />Linda Bulger, 2008
B001BPJJ82|5.0|The fall is one of the best adventure movie since The Adventures of Baron Munchausen. And the blu ray Quality is out of the world. One of the best i have ever seen. This movie is a hidden gem. I was in dvd/vhs store called 2001 in Iceland yesterday and the owner started to talk about this movie and thanks to him i bought it. It´s pure magic.
B001EN71DG|2.0|Not what I was wanting or expecting.  Yes, you get the original, un re-mastered version on one side, and the newly re-mastered on the other side. Don't get me wrong, the re-mastered version looks amazing, EXCEPT it has the deleted/additional scenes in it that weren't in the original.  I think the deleted addional scenes are stupid and ruin the films. George Lucas has become an expert at ruining his classic works of art with the new trilogy as well.  So yeah, I may still have the original version on one side, but it's not remastered and it looks like I'm watching it from a VHS. Why they couldn't just take the re-mastered version and cut out the stupid scenes is beyond me.  I was so excited for this to come out....what a bummer
B0013TO3HS|1.0|The movie was a disapointment. Yeah, the graphics were ok but not as good. The story line deviates from the book. If you are a fan of the book I recommend not buying this movie. It's ok to watch but not to own. They could have done much more but they didn't. I watched the movie before deciding wether to buy it or not and trust me, its not worth your money.
141694740X|5.0|Read this book and live by it's rules. Your life as a lady will be so much less coomplicated. It will take any power you idiotically gave to a man and give it back to you. Ladies stop taking excusses from them, stop waiting for there calls, and stop crying over them. No man is worth your tears. It's time to take back your power.  Also a great book to couple this one with is \\"Why Men Love Bitches\\" (I know, i don't like the title either, but it works!)    Relationshhips wont be nothin' but a thang when you get through with these two books.  HOLLA
0060763280|2.0|After reading a couple pages of this book I realized I made a mistake and this guy wasn't the real deal...  More and more I read through it I realized he is just trying to milk the self motivation business and come out with a book to generate some cash, and advertise his seminars like every few pages! Talk about over kill!  To sum up his book can be done in a couple sentences!  1: surround yourself my millionaires and hopefully some of their energy will brush off on you...  2: only you can make your dreams come true!  3: change your frame of mind to think rich...    Wow! Took 200 pages to tell us that...    I think this book just shows how he has been milking this business.  He goes around the country and gives speeches to people who are weak and desperate for change! He has found a niche market which pays him money!  He comes out with books, and tries to relate with stories of hardship etc... But frankly he really doesn't have a clue! the prices he charges just goes to show you he is ONLY OUT TO MAKE MONEY! the way he makes it is off peoples hopes! I'd rather give my money to Deepak Chopra than this guy!  He is marketing himself throughout the book so that's very ugly at times also...  The book goes on and on and on about nothing, he repeats himself over and over again! The book is nothing more than a business venture for the author to make some more money!   Smart move on to generate more wealth, but unfortunately the book is full of hopes and dreams, but doesn't give anyone any advice on how to generate wealth!   I felt the author wanted to jump into this market so he needed a book!  He came up with a premise of mindsets! Frankly speaking false hope.  Pass on this book if you have already read a self-help book, because this book just regurgitates the same as every other book...  \\"You have to make it happen, you can do it! The power is within you blar blar blar\\"    If you are looking at a book to help generate wealth and help with investing money, look elsewhere...
0765316897|4.0|Why, Brandon Sanderson, why?!?  Don't take this the wrong way, I'm absolutely addicted to everything Mistborn, Sanderson is without a doubt a fantastic talent.  But I expected so much MORE!  Book 1 was amazing, Book 2 was phenomenal and still surprising, but Book 3 somehow lost that ability to amaze!<br /><br />  It's still amazing work, satisfying because it tied up all the (major) plot threads (while leaving some to dangle with tantalizing promise).  But it was so hurried in the end!  And the big reveals, those oh so crucial details that we wait for with bated breath to be unveiled so delicately and with so much fanfare!  WHY did you have to spit them out quickly and so off-handedly? *pounds the ground, gnashes teeth and wails in frustrated anguish* WHY?!?<br /><br />  This book was great, but it lost some of that wonderful momentum built up by the last two.  You'll see what I mean (one of them has to do with Allomancy... WHY?!?).  Ahem, as I was saying, there just wasn't that wonder and amazement that I felt because things were revealed in such a way that it takes you aback and think, boy, well, that's it?  No french horns or brass trumpets?<br /><br />  And the ending came so quickly, you absolutely have to go back and read it again to be completely satisfied with it *sniffle*.  I wondered as well if maybe Sanderson's priority at this point was finishing quickly and getting started with the last book of the Wheel of Time.  If so, I don't think he paid respect to himself in any way because, yeah, Sir Rigney has passed away and his legacy calls, but Sanderson's work is just as important because it's his own work.<br /><br />  *Sigh* Read it in any case, you have to, it's still great.  Just expect to be a little let down.  If you're not, I wish I were you, for whatever lack of expectation you may have had (or not had) to leave you with such superior satisfaction...
B000UO338W|5.0|The end of the Bush trilogy concludes with another solid release that is top notch from start to finish.     It's amazing how a band like Ministry can produce such a quality thrash album, when their discography is so diverse that it delves into such genres as sludge metal, synth pop, prog rock, and industrial metal. Bands like Sodom and Destruction, who are strictly thrash bands, haven't released an album that is anywhere near as good as this one.    Ministry is one of the few bands that can release albums that are almost entirely free of filler, and this album is no exception.     Let's Go continues the trend of album openers that are not only heavy, but extremely catchy. This song is quite possibly one of Ministry's best. This album is bookended with the instant classic that is End of Days 2, which includes a sample from Eisenhowser's Military-Industrial Complex speech.     In between, there are such choice cuts as Watch Yourself, Death and Destruction, End of Days 1, and No Glory.     Tommy Victor of Prong once again delivers catchy riff after catchy riff.     For those who did not enjoy Houses of the Mole or Rio Grande Blood will not enjoy this. The lyrics on this album are similar to the previous albums, but for me, the quality of the song writing trumps the message from the highly controversial Bush trilogy.     Ministry concludes their amazing career with another gem, and leaves you wanting more.
B000ZK4466|3.0|I have been a fan of The Mars Volta for a while now. 'De-loused' was outstanding, 'Francis The Mute' Had it's moments, and 'Amputechture' seemed like a step in the right direction. Unfortunately, 'Bedlam in Goliath' doesn't do it for me. I guess when you run out of ideas you add as many layers of noise as possible. Thats the impression I get, or that these guys are trying to push their way back out of the spot light with terrible music. Either way... i don't like it. I tried so hard, but nothing on here does it for me. Im glad to see some people enjoy it. They apparently hit the mark for a few people. Hopefully next time around we will get something a little more straight forward, and focused.    *UPDATE: okay, so it has grown on me a bit more. I enjoy a few tracks now, but still my least favorite by these guys. oh well.
0765316897|5.0|It can be intimidating to pick up a new epic fantasy series, especially with the passing of Robert Jordan last year, leaving his enormous Wheel of Time series without an ending. So it's very reassuring to have someone like Brandon Sanderson who released all three books in his Mistborn trilogy in a time frame that would make Hollywood movie execs swoon.    The Hero of Ages is the final Mistborn book, and it is well worth the pleasure of reading through the first two to get to the third. Part of the allure of this final tome in the trilogy is seeing how things that one that were incidental or a random detail in the first or second book(s) actually has great import in the winding down scenes of Vin's world. Also, seeing familiar characters change and become something more is a delight, while the action is everything that fantasy fans have come to expect. In sum, the form of the trilogy as a whole is almost flawless, and it is delightful experiencing the intricacies that Sanderson has woven.    Here's another way of looking at the book: It's the sort of read that irritates you that there are so many pages to go (because you want to know what happens), and then, at the end, you're sad that there aren't any pages left to read.    Though the form of the trilogy is flawless, some of the details in HoA are missing that were more present in the other two entries. Essentially, the other two books only take place in Luthadel (with some minor exceptions), so the reader becomes familiar with how the sprawling city looks, feels, and operates. In this one, with so much going on, the mental images of some of the other cities is not as well developed--a brief 'set the scene' description when the city is first introduced and an occasional detail thrown in every once in a while. The result is a foggier mental map of the world, where each city's location respective of another is vague. Of course, in a world coated with mist and a perpetual fog of ash, maybe that's fitting.    This tinycriticism of an overall stunning achievement is more of a personal thing (as all reviews are, right?), and shouldn't be anything more than a 'heads up' to potential readers.     Oh, and anyone who is a potential reader needs to get the other two books (along with this one) and change 'potential' into 'avid'. The series shouldn't be missed.    P.S. FYI (in case you didn't already know) Sanderson will be authoring Robert Jordan's final book, A Memory of Light. If you're a Jordan fan, you should probably check out Sanderson's work in the form of Elantris or the Mistborn trilogy to see if you like his storytelling capacity.
B001FBSMW6|5.0|This is one of those album's that require repeated listenings.  I will bet that on the 3rd play, you will begin to understand that these songs aren't just good, they are outstanding.  Continued listenings, and you will begin to realize that this is one of the best albums you have heard this year.  It is a masterpiece and should not be overlooked.  I agree with some of the comments here because I felt similarly upon the 1st play.  But you have to give it another go.  This is really an excellent CD and should not get lost in the mass of pre holiday releases.  Listen one more time and I guarantee you will love it.

045122499X|3.0|I'm enjoying this book, and have almost finished it, but I have noticed two odd things while reading it.<br /><br />The first odd thing is that Follett has apparently recycled all the major characters from \\"The Pillars of the Earth.\\"  Of course, they have different names, family origins, and circumstances, but they are still the same-old same-old.  To wit, the duelling Cain and Abel brothers, with one brother incredibly good in all aspects, and the other brother incomprehensibly bad in all aspects.  As I recall, in \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\" these were the children of John Builder.  In the present work, they are Merthin and HIS brother.  The main heroes, John Builder and the Lady Aliena, reappear here as Merthin and Caris.  And so does the evil, repellent woman who is incredibly gifted in power politics, forced to tell her stupid male relatives what they must do in order to gain power.<br /><br />The second area of concern will probably (like the first) not matter much to most readers: anachronism.  Basically, this means \\"contradicting the time-frame of the story.\\"  If you are filming a tale about Ancient Greece, it is a major anachronism if the camera catches someone wearing a watch.<br /><br />The problem here goes much deeper than extras with a Rolex.  All of the major heroes of this allegedly medieval saga are deeply concerned with issues which belong to modern times, most particularly feminism.  The problem here does not lie with feminism, or the attitude towards slavery, but with ANACHRONISM.  A woman in the Middle Ages would hardly have obsessed over the choice between career and marriage, but the heroine of this novel does.  She also obsesses about the unequal status of men and women -- a concern which had not even been verbalized in medieval times.<br /><br />A counterexample would be Mary Renault, who did her level best to try to capture and present actual people from Ancient Greece, in her many excellent historical novels.  She worked hard at it, to the point of trying to make her English prose echo, somehow, the sounds and rhythms of Attic Greek.<br /><br />Ken Follett didn't even try to do something like this with regard to the Middle Ages in Europe.  He gave us, instead, a bunch of 21st century people dressed up in medieval finery, and so, in my opinion, he fails as a writer of historical novels.<br /><br />In fact, I suddenly suspect that the incredibly verbose Anne Rice is better at recreating ancient worlds than Ken Follett.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I'll undoubtedly finish reading \\"World Without End.\\"  This review has concentrated on two negative points, but neglecting the positive aspects: Ken Follett can really tell a tale, and his characters really capture your heart and your imagination.sh prose echo, somehow, the sounds and rhythms of Attic Greek.

B001DDBCUU|5.0|This movie was outstanding on it's own (4 stars), but I upgraded it to 5 stars because it was easily the best movie based on a popular series that I have ever seen.  The did not skimp out on story developement.  The original cast was there.  The had a few bumps in the road.  There was no sneaky ending leaving you feeling that they would make more cheesy sequels.  It had the great style of the show, without the typical changes some movies make from the show.  There was no \\"gee they had a much bigger budget\\" or \\"I don't remember that story line...\\"     In a nutshell: No gimmicks, great story.
B000T9OP7G|5.0|Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles has all of the things you would expect from an action show:  things blow up, people get shot, cyborgs tear apart sets and wreck havoc on each other in satisfyingly flashy and violent ways.  But what I wasn't expecting was how multi-layered the plots become.  Common themes explored are the journey from boy to leader of mankind, Biblical stories, references to The Wizard of Oz, (particularly the Tim Man as Cameron, in search of a heart), and the idea that the humans must become as ruthless and unsentimental as the machines to survive, while the machines must become more human in order to hunt them.<br /><br />Moments of sublime beauty (Summer Glau doing ballet) are in stark contrast with cruelty, despair and dysfunction.  While it might start a little slow, when the show gets to Dungeons and Dragons it kicks it into high gear and never lets up. This is the rarest kind of tv show: the smart action show.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|If your a rock fan, you owe it to yourself to buy this album. No disrespect, but I was glad when they got rid of the lead singer from Creed, and this album fully shows why. The guitarist can finally play like he wants to, and this album benefits from it. The vocalist put the vocalist from Creed to shame. My favorite songs are Blackbird, Brand New Start, and Coming home. Please, buy this album. You won't regret it.
0395905079|2.0|Tacky color that ruins the great original drawings, abridged stories and possibly too big and wrong sized pages like for the B. Potter Treasury.  With these many errors, I wouldn't be surprised if they have Paddington eating Coleman's Mustard in the book and a coupon for 20 P off on a tin of the stuff.
0312370849|4.0|The first part of Sarah's Key would lead me to rate the book 5 stars. De Rosnay shows the sheer horror of the roundup -- the betrayal of the French police and the concierges. The heroine, Julia Jarmond, seems trapped in a marriage to a handsome but cruel French architect.  The juxtaposition of Julia's and Sarah's story works well.<br /><br />But as other reviewers have noted, the story gets more mundane after Sarah leaves. We readers soon realize just how closely Sarah's life will be connected with Julia's in-laws.<br /><br />The last part of the book belongs almost entirely to Julia, who turns out to be a flawed heroine. Although she seems to make tough decisions, she's rescued by her sister and her boss. The daughter, Zoe, add interest. And the ending seems more chick lit than literary fiction.<br /><br />Ultimately, if read purely as mystery and suspense, the book works well.

Which I got the [[ASIN:B001H55MBY The World of the Dark Crystal]] book as well.    This one had much more documentaries than the other DVD and I especially liked the additional features and Brian's commentary audio track. It was interesting hearing him talk about parts of the movie.    I cant compare it to any other of the DVDs so your milage may vary but if you are looking to get this movie and dont have a DVD of it yet... Get this one.
B00188M5TM|5.0|\\"Changeling\\" is every bit as good as I expected it to be. With Angelina Jolie as the star and Clint Eastwood as the director, how can you go wrong? The film, which is based on a true story, revolves around Christine Collins (Jolie), whose nine-year-old son, Walter (Gattlin Griffith), disappears one day in March 1928. After several months, the Los Angeles Police Department claims to have found the child, but the boy they return to Christine is not Walter, and she can't get them to listen to her when she tries to explain there's been a horrible mistake. Christine's insistence becomes a major thorn in the side of the police captain (Jeffrey Donovan), who sneakily (and illegally) has Christine locked away in a mental hospital. Eventually the truth about the police misconduct in the Collins case is revealed for the world to see, and Christine continues to hope that her real son may still be out there somewhere.<br /><br />This is an excellent film with an astounding cast. There's a gruesome subplot that ties into the Collins case, causing the film to be a lot more violent and disturbing than I initially expected. \\"Changeling\\" is also on the long side, clocking in at about two and a half hours. Still, it's a magnificent film, and Jolie delivers one of her most impressive performances to date. This is definitely a movie worth seeing on the big screen.
0810945797|5.0|I loved the movie, and when I saw that the book has been reprinted I ordered it when I got the 25th anniversary DVD.    Here's the good... The artwork is excellent, and I especially like the 2 page photo of Jen & Kira in the first few pages of the book. The great thing about the book is the reflection of Brian when he was asked to work on this movie in a brief intro at the beginning of the book. What I also really like about the book is that it requires a bit of understanding how its written.    It's written from the point of view of Augara which makes it a fun read but its not a simple mindless read. The book explains a lot about the world itself, a little Gelfling history and the arrival of the Mystics and Skeksis. The book focuses on the world itself less so than on Jen and Kira.    If you like the movie, you will probably like this book. Highly recommended.
B0016NF06O|5.0|You don't have to like Willie Nelson's musical style or Wynton Marsalis's to enjoy this outstanding  coupling. Together they make new Music!. Relaxing and fun, I listen to it over and over and each time find a new gem hidden in the songs. Thanks guys for putting together such a fine piece of work. Buy people! Buy two and give as a gift. Worth every last nickel.

B00004S367|5.0|1963  12 year old \\"Little\\" Stevie Wonder had his first hit, \\"Fingertips\\", a harmonica funk on Tamla/Motown. Hits kept on' a comin'. during Mid period Motown mid \\"60's, classics like \\"Uptight\\" and \\"I Was Made to Love Her\\". These amazing 45's these wondrous pop songs were written sung by a young man. Stevie wanted to break-out, record his own songs, produce himself...  He got his first chance with this underated attempt.  \\"Music of My Mind\\" had no hits, no nothing but the example of what was to come...  \\"Music of My Mind\\" is Stevie dominate, he plays all the instruments, save for a few sweetly aching guitar glissantos by Buzzy Felton. Stevie was 22 at the time and ready for the next...(which would be classic LP Talking Book \\"Superstition etc.)  \\"Music of My Mind\\" is the adolescent memory just before coming into the man.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|This album is a just a slight step away from Pearl Jam, but well worth the short trip. Eddie brings all passion and storytelling of Pearl Jam, but this time he has clearly pushed his music in the direction he wants it to go. In my opinion this some of his best work as a vocalist, relying on an acoustic sound and feel to deliver a very good sit and listen session.   Simply a must have album.
B001E1DJD4|3.0|Her previous record, Happenstance, has been one of the most played albums on my CD player. It's packed with my family's favs, and the whole is so astonishing and diverse. Sometimes swinging (Be be your love), sometimes old-school (I want you), real-pop (Worn me down), etc. etc. Few months ago I was immediately attracted by the appetizer to her new album, which included a great song, \\"The Other Side\\" (why wasn't it included in the final version of the album?!), but already the appetizer seemed dangerously homogenous and too `lazy'.  Now, after 4 years of patient waiting, I am disappointed. I started to listen to \\"Elephants\\" with so much hope and warm feelings in my heart, and after 20 listenings I AM DISAPPOINTED. It's ambitious, but sometimes pretentious as well. Each of the most promising songs MISSES SOMETHING. Just to mention two examples: `Duet' is moving, but Ray LaMontagne's vibrato is close to self-parody. \\"Sidedish friend\\" - wow, finally something dynamic, but it sounds like an impoverished cousin of `Worn me down' from \\"Happenstance\\".   Rachael's voice is better, deeper and more sensual than ever. It has matured over the years, but unfortunately repertoire didn't catch up. Anyway, I am still willing to make a blind subscription to every Rachael's CD. If you don't have \\"Happenstance\\" yet, it's better to devote your money to Rachael's great debut. If you liked it, you will still find some good echoes of her talent and  great sensitivity on \\"Elephants\\".
0452289963|2.0|Man, this author is full of himself.  Every other philosopher and religious tradition has it wrong, according to Tolleson.    Lots of philosophers have ideas and manage to share them without the wholesale dismissal of every other idea.  Why does Tolleson have to state that everyone else is wrong and he is right?  Somehow, it reminds me of those folks who are never open to discussion on any point...  you know who I mean.  Anyway, I mostly hated this book, in spite of the few good points that he made just because it is so pompous and self-righteous.  I guess I missed why Oprah recommended this book.
B000007T2Z|5.0|If I was told this would become one of my favorite albums of all time a few years ago I'd laugh it off. Looking back I regret not getting into this band sooner. Godspeed! You Black Emperer are a Canadian Post-Rock group consisting of nine members. Who seem to have a knack at making music that transcends both structure and art as a whole.<br /><br />Blending orchestrated segments together with rock instrumentation, and pretentious ambiance, Godspeed is a band you'll be finding yourself listening to again and again.  Three tracks flow in courses or movements if you will, but bind together so cohesively it'd be pointless to choose a certain segment and call it a day. Spanning out enough to breach the hour mark, along with it the fastest hour you will ever encounter.<br /><br />GY!BE isn't for everyone. If you're a fan of the Post-Rock scene you should be quite familiar with the long durations and hopefully of developed the skills (to be a patient listener). To people familiar with pop formated tunes this can be a lot to digest, never say never just start slow. Ease yourself into more progressive material! Try starting out with the band Explosions In The Sky, a more garage orientated post-rock band.<br /><br />I really wish I could say more then other reviewers to make my review that much more important. Unfortunately I can't, I believe this is an album where the plot is your variable. The atmosphere though is quite dark in nature, gloomily triumphant though. Danny Boyle, director of \\"28 Days Later\\", claims this to be the ultimate soundtrack for his film. Depicting the post-apocalyptic virally infected ruins of England, survivors struggle to reach safety . If an album can inspire imagery of that magnitude, no telling what you could imagine. I find it great when coupled with a good book, or on a rainy afternoon. The music is so full, and never will you be greeted to enduring anything less then top notch. Never falling victim to the loudness wars, this album has range!<br /><br />Do yourself a favor buy it, if you're not satisfied come back to it at a later time. It's an album that really grows on you, and if you're willing to let it expand I'm sure it will. This album currently resides in my top five favorite albums, and along with it the reward of being played on a frequented basis.it, if you're not satisfied come back to it at a later time.

B000003H34|4.0|I am not really that big a fan of the band, but a tremendous fan of this album!  It is truly a masterpiece. Yes it is dark and melancholy, but it is true art. The soundscape is magnificent, I marvel at the atmosphere they create. The back cover features an angel holding his head in what could be agony or frustration, and that is what this sounds like. Beautiful agony! To quite from the title track: \\"Happiness in a broken vision\\".    And most importantly, the album is a cohesive whole, not just a bunch of songs stuck together in a compilation. Listen to the full artwork, not just individual songs, and you might appreciate the journey it takes you on.
B00005JO20|4.0|King Kong is a very entertaining movie with a lot of emotion, its epic, funny and very disturbing when those over grown bugs start swarming in on the humans,haha. Overall though, it is a must see and the computer graphics on King Kong are amazing. Not as good as the graphics in Transformers, but definitely good
0765342294|5.0|This book has become a sci-fi classic in a short time.  Fast read and will always be remembered!  Highly recommended.
B001JOIEZ4|5.0|I absolutelly love the soundtrack! There are two of them so make sure you get the one that has 15 songs that way you get to listen to more songs by Rob Pattinson and Claire De Lune (Debussy Classical Piano). All the songs are GREAT!!!! I do recomend the cd.
B000025SL5|5.0|If you ever wanted to sit back and listen to music that takes you to another time or place then this is the CD for you!  Vangelis at his VERY best - not one track can be disregarded as 'fluff or filler'.  I first heard it playing in the background in a big time bookstore.  I ran all over the store trying to find someone who could tell me WHO & what & where that music was coming from!  I finally found someone to help me & I purchased the CD that VERY day.  Have loved it ever since.  I never ever get tired of it.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Excellent work Mr. Gore!!  Very clear, eloquent, comprehensive, balanced, well researched and well presented. If after watching this DVD you still don´t understand or care about global warming, you´d better get your I.Q. tested and start seeing a shrink. The problem is real and the consequences for ignoring the facts are devastating. The side effects of the industrial revolution are real and worrying. Examples of the enviromental pollution are readily available.  Open your eyes and wake up!! Some philosopher once said, that the eyes can´t see what the mind doesn´t know.  How true that is!  On the other hand, never underestimate the power of denial, this is truly an inconvenient truth for many.   How can anyone still not get it????   For more complete information read Mr. Gore´s book with the same title.
0385338732|4.0|Although not as good as the Shopaholic series, I liked this book MUCH better than the Undomestic Goddess.  I found it extremely difficult to put down and read the whole thing in one night!  I would definitely recommend this book to any Sophie Kinsella fan; you will not be disappointed.
B001DU8T6S|5.0|First, of all I wanted to say that the \\"Enhanced\\" version is simply a link to a web page which has links to Facebook, Myspace, iTunes etc. like I couldn't find these links on my own.  There's no extra hidden tracks or videos, although there are videos on the YouTube link of course, but will they be available indefiintely?  So, buy the regular version and not the enhanced version unless there's no price difference.<br /><br />Now for the cd itself, after one listen it's quite good.  It really does sound more like a Paul Rodgers record but you can very much hear Queen.  I know Queen fans are struggling calling this band Queen (+ Paul Rodgers) but the bottom line is the music and it's good to hear these rock legends putting out quality new music.  If you don't espect this to be A Night at the Opera and if you like Paul Rodgers in his Free or Bad Company days, you should like this CD.  I expect too.
0385338694|2.0|This is my least favorite of all of Sophie Kinsella's books.  It is VERY predictable, and as other reviewers have noted, leaves a lot of loose ends, like what happened to the Geigers?  The author made it sound like there was something going on with them earlier, but that just dissolves.      Also, this is the first male love interest out of all of Kinsella's books that I couldn't stand!  I was surprised.  I couldn't even picture what he looked like in my head, and actually didn't want them to end up together.      It was also lacking in humor.   I'd recommend it if you're a big fan of Kinsella's, but if not, don't bother picking it up.
B000002UA7|5.0|My very first Kate Bush album!     1) Wuthering Heights (new vocal) 10/10   I bet I've heard it 100 times already. I'm a skater and I plan to use it for a program sometime soon. That would make me listen to it another 100 times but honestly? I don't think I can ever get sick of it.     2) Cloudbusting 7/10   Great song, amazing lyrics, awesome story. If you haven't, watched the music video! Who knew Kate could act? But anyways, it's a gorgeous song that tells of a young boy whose father was captured because he was trying to make a machine that controlled weather. Very very interesting.     3) The Man With The Child In His Eyes 7/10   Soft, beautiful and very simple may be your first thoughts, but after a few listens you may get the lyrics and slowly reveal all the layers of this song. Oh and you may enjoy the voice Kate uses to sing this. Far cry from her wails of \\"Heathcliff!\\"     4) Breathing 9/10   Heartbreaking. It is written in a fetus's point of view and it is about plutonium poisoning. Kate uses irony perfectly as she shows that breathing, the very process that keeps us alive can also kill.     5) Wow 8/10   I thought about using one word 'Wow' to describe the song, then decided against the lame humor but you get the point.     6) Hounds of Love 8/10   My interpretation is that Kate is running away from love (or something like that.) It's a very good song, nicely written and I think its tune has been copied quite a few times since its release, hasn't it? Well, Kate's the original, always will be.     7) Running Up That Hill 10/10   Her biggest hit in the US and I can see why. Its one of my favourites with such well written lyrics and an amazing melody. Only Kate can produce something like this. If you haven't heard of her, this is a good song to try.     8) Army Dreamers 9/10   The first song I heard from her. A friend showed me the video and I'll admit, I remember thinking \\"This woman is nuts\\" but now, the chorus stays in my head all day. And the song couldn't carry a better message.     9) Sat in Your Lap 8/10   It took a while, but it gradually growed on me. Until I got so used to it I forgot how weird it is. I introduced it to a friend and I think I permanently scared her away from Kate. But she'll come around.     10) Experiment IV 7/10   Great song, though the video scared the bats out of me. My favourite line is \\"And the meters are over in the red.\\" Kate writes the best stuff. I know I shouldn't recommend it, but go watch the video if you want a really clear picture of what the song is about. And I do mean REALLY CLEAR picture.     11) The Dreaming 6/10   Still not used it yet, though I love the lyrics and the meaning Kate puts on an accent to pull you deeper into the mood of the song. I highly doubt Kate can write anything bad and I do think it is a good song but I'm just not very used to it. Yet.     12) Babooshka 10/10   LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT. Go watch the video! It is also one of my favourites. It is about this lady who tries testing how loyal her husband is. The chorus is highly addictive.     TOP SONGS (in my opinion)   Wuthering Heights   Breathing   Running Up That Hill   Babooshka   Army Dreamers     I don't know if its all the same but my CD booklet doesn't come with lyrics. Just a summary of Kate's career.     However, I think this CD is amazing and a great way for introducing people to Kate. (C'mon, they'll be hooked by the first song)     Yes, I know she's weird but that's why we love her.
0887307280|5.0|The single most important book to read BEFORE starting your own business. The e-Myth is that most people think they've created a business when all they've really done is created a job. Please don't start a business before reading this book because it will help you avoid the pitfalls (most new ventures fail) but because it helps you evaluate the why and the costs of venturing out on your own.<br /><br />Much has been said about this book so I won't rehash it. The success of this book and its long history of being a best seller (let alone in print) speaks for itself. There is real gold in this book. Gerber divides the many hats an entrepreneur wears into three categories: the leader, the manager, and the technician. Gerber outlines a good business model. I wish I had read this 20 years ago.<br /><br />A business is created to be an asset and possibly be sold - not to create a job for yourself. Not understanding that principle (and the how to do it) will cause you to work very very hard and not make much money, or even go bankrupt. Read this book and proactively prevent many problems and heartache - especially in your bank account.
B000WTBMBK|5.0|If you like your Electronica served chilled and with the same artistic level as the likes of The Orb, Higher Intelligence Agency, Plaid, Future Sound of London or Boards of Canada.... then you can't go wrong with this album. Fear not, buy it.
0375826726|5.0|This might be the best book so far in the series.  Once you start reading the book, you can hardly put it down, I read the entire book in a weekend.  I am not sure what to say about those who gave the book less than 3 stars, I have read far worse books.  I can't wait for book 4, it should be even better.  I read a book about every other week, so I think I have a better than most feel for a what a good book is and what a bad one is, and this is a good read.
B0000009SE|5.0|Some VERY good jams are featured on this Frank Zappa masterpiece.  So much creativity was involved in making these jams, and such special attention to make sure the listener is satisfied the entire way, that I'm completely at a loss for words when I hear the 20 minute \\"Big Swifty\\" jam.  MAN is that some good stuff!    Let's talk more about \\"Big Swifty\\", since it takes up half the album.  The first minute or so is some typical heavy fast-paced jazzy goofiness, which is what we've come to expect from Zappa.  Then we get serious in a hurry, and these AWESOME keyboard swirls come in and this is probably my favorite part of the entire instrumental jam.  Jazzy, melodic, and wonderful.      Around the six minute mark some of Zappa's very best guitar playing can be heard.  These are NO ordinary guitar solos- they are played in such a way that demands the listener pay close attention to the different melodic ideas that constantly shift around.  This is the kind of music that's so good it's IMPOSSIBLE to explain in words.      10 minutes in, everything changes again, and now we're treated to some Allman Brothers-like guitar jamming and it's really freakin' awesome.  This is some of the most challenging stuff I've ever heard Zappa do (yes, even more challenging than the \\"Gumbo Variations\\").      I can't remember much about the last five minutes or so- the music is so challenging that I haven't been able to focus on the final few minutes at the moment, even after hearing the song 20 times so far!    Waka/Jawaka is just a highly experimental album with jazzy influences and I totally agree with the people who believe it's Hot Rats Part II.  It feels so much like a continuation from that classic album.  Frank Zappa is a musical genius, and here's your proof.  The only complaint is that it's a pretty short album overall.  Still, it's worth the price.  In fact, it's worth a lot, because it's an album I believe I will be playing 20 years from now.
0307455874|4.0|I first read his previous book: Dreams from my Father which makes for a fascinating read. The Audacity of Hope is also a great read, and it's the best way to understand Barack Obama's values and really go inside his head. It feels like having a conversation with the man himself. Highly recommended.
B000002J1U|5.0|I remember as a child I knew the name and the image of Led Zeppelin long before I ever heard the actual music.  The legend surrounding them is so strong, and their songs are so well known, that people tend to take it for granted that somebody had to actually write those songs.  III saw the band growing into the most talented riff-makers in the history of rock and roll.  Still a heavy rock album by anyone's standards, III contained a more folksy sound than their previous releases.  The tone of the album is actually very moody and the songs are quite often acoustic.  This was quite a change from I and II.  For me, the second side of the album is stronger than the first, and it is also where the band let their folk flag fly, more than ever before.  The heavy blues are obviously still present but by 1970 Zep was proving they had more to offer than just ferocious interpretations of that particular American-born genre.
B0014DBZT2|3.0|Cave is the kind of artist who is better at arranging then actually writing songs, and with this latest reinvention he coasts by on an eclectic bed of intellectual pop rock ambiance that either plays into or exposes his gifts to elevate standard material.
B000KLRUJS|5.0|Ideally, I'd have given this recording 4.5 stars (the thing that bothers me is Marie Collier's howling and crying as Chrysothemis:  much as it is indeed called-for in the score, it seems overdone...);  since that's not available, let it have the full 5 as it otherwise deserves it.  This is particularly so given its presenting the full uncut musical text of the opera (apparently all the other recordings, with the possible exception of the Sawallisch, have the same 6-7 cuts that are usually made with staged performances);  in any case, the performances (particularly those of Solti and the Wiener Philharmoniker, as well as of Nilsson and Krause - what power!!!) make this recording an absolute must in any serious classical music collection - especially with any Straussians!  People, do your best to get this recording - when most others are cut, this is then an essential item in one's recording library - be one an opera-lover, musician (be it as a singer or as an instrumentalist), or simply a music-lover.    Now, hearing that this latest re-issue is supposed to be better-still (compared to its predecessor) in terms of bringing out the full riches of the original 1967 LP recording, one can be all the more enthusiastic in acquiring it!
B001AGXEA6|5.0|Adam and Barbara Maitland (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) are staying home for their vacation. In an effort to avoid driving over a cute loose mutt, they, car and all plunge over a bridge. The next thing they know is that they are home. However, something is a tad strange. Yep soon, they find they are the recently deceased.  How will they cope with the situation and where can they find help whim strange people purchase and intend to occupy the house?<br /><br />The story takes some intriguing turns. Moreover, the music instead of being a background mood helper is actually as important as the other characters in the story. &quot;Day-o, he say day-ay-ay-o.&quot;<br /><br />This film is an excellent candidate for Blu-ray. The Blu-ray version also has the standard extras. I am not sure but I could swear there are more scenes than I saw in earlier versions.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001B504LI The Uninvited]]
B000E97X66|5.0|Filled with over two hours of spectacular music, the Hammersmith'75 CD is worth every penny. Springsteen is a genius at putting together longer songs with the E-Street band. The 13-minute rendition of \\"E Street Shuffle/Havin' A Party\\" and the 17-minute 'Kitty's back\\" are worth the purchase alone.    This is a very carefree, enjoyable album with different versions of his more popular tunes. It's all about a young Springsteen doing what he loves best: having fun, telling a story, and rocking out all night.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|Great discussion in our book club and a great read that kept you guessing until the end.
B000088DTS|5.0|I was first introduced to the magic of Delta Goodrem while living in Northern Ireland in 2004. At the time, the Australian singer was a huge star in Europe, and her voice led me to this album. After a few listens, I fell in love with her amazing vocals and unique combination of piano and orchestra with pop music.    The album opens with hopeful ballad 'Born to Try', the story of the pressure that we all feel in trying to reach our dreams. While it sounds sappy, the song manages to deliver in a heartfelt manner without being over-dramatic. The album's title track, 'Innocent Eyes', along with 'Not Me, Not I' and 'Lost without You' are all piano-driven pop songs, a bit dark but filled with emotion. And 'A Year Ago Today' is a tender homage to the loss of a loved one.    Statistically speaking, one out of every four homes in Australia owns this record. It's easy to see why; Delta's voice has the power and range of Celine Dion but the propensity to sing rather than simply belt out ballads. And the music is surprisingly mature for a 17 year-old.     I initially was introduced to Delta through her second album. But it was 'Innocent Eyes' that won me over.
B00192KCQ0|1.0|I love heavy metal but I get headache if I listen to this album for more than 30 min and now I know why.  They raised the volume all the way up and everything all sounds the same.  Don't buy this CD.
B0015AARJI|1.0|Seriously? This thing doesn't come with a cord?! Thank you, Sony for finding a new source of revenue. And a special shout out to Amazon for never mentioning that THIS THING DOESN'T COME WITH A CORD. A USB cord is never even featured in the \\"Accessories\\" or \\"Buy With\\" or \\"Customers Also Bought\\" sections. Thanks a million.
B000F2C87Q|5.0|Chulahoma is six songs long, and they are all spectacular. The songs are all covers from a Blues Great, Junior Kimbrough. [[ASIN:B00006AWM0 You Better Run: The Essential Junior Kimbrough]]    The covers were so well done and appreciated, that Junior's wife called the Keys and left a message saying how excited she was to hear them. In turn, her voicemail was placed on the album after \\"My Mind Is Ramblin\\"    The songs will make any skeptic of blues music think twice. Great Album.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|Muse is a band that I find difficult to categorize.  They take elements of classic progressive rock and fuse it with modern electronica and alternative rock not unlike their peers Radiohead or more adventurous material from Coldplay.  At the same time the band hearken back to older influences, an obvious one being Queen and some of this stuff even reminds me of bands like Rush, Depeche Mode or Prince.  Yes the material is that diverse.  So what does all this mean?  It means Muse is a great band who are creating some of the freshest and adventurous rock music out there today.  Having not been exposed to their earlier stuff (aside from the occasional single on the radio), I can't compare this album to prior ones, but \\"Holes\\" has certainly made me want to explore the rest of the band's catalogue.
B001F2W4Y2|2.0|This album is over produced and over mixed. Every track sounds almost exactly the same. There doesn't seem to be any separation in instrument volume throughout. An example are the cymbals overpowering the vocals and predominantly \\"in front\\" of everything else. When I should be hearing Angus going to town during a few of these tracks, he's being drowned out by all of the other instruments playing at the same unnatural volume.    I swear there's one track that sounds just like Aerosmith. If I heard the track on the radio, I would never know it was AC/DC.    I can't tell what the lyrics are without the lyric sheet in front of me because I can't hear them! And, don't give me the garbage that this is what AC/DC sounds like. I've been listening to AC/DC for nearly 30 years. I don't ever remember there being a mixing credit on the jacket of an album - there is one here. Someone got ahold of this and made it sound too mainstream by messing with the recording levels outside the recording sessions. My personal guess is that this album's tracks will sound fantastic live, but the final product of Black Ice is just not the Youngs' work.    Honestly, I'm trying to like it. I'm waiting to see if it grows on me. I really hope there's a live album coming with this tour, and I hope no one screws with it too much.    Give me the raw AC/DC of yesteryear!
B00129H7VS|5.0|I purchased the original when it first was released on DVD.  Today I received my blu-ray copy (from WB directly).  The video quality is amazing (much deeper black levels and much more detail) and the DTS-HD Master audio track is very good!    Both of my grandfathers are WW2 veterans and they have both commented on this series.    This is a must buy!
B001CFLHJA|4.0|Aaron Parks take a shot at defining modern piano with \\"Invisible Cinema\\".  If you've heard the Terence Blanchard and Christian Scott CD's that Parks played on, this CD will feel familiar.  Parks plays a relatively spare piano, and the songs sound like they're in a minor key.  The relative effect is more of a quiet Vijay Iyer than Brad Mehldau.  Guitarist Mike Moreno is on hand to support the song and piano playing.  His few solos are very good, though.  Some of the songs are rock-inspired, which means Radiohead-esque.  These are more likely to have simple, repeated eighth-note lines.    This is a jazz CD which will appeal to rock fans that crossover to jazz, and any jazz fan who likes to stay current.
B0013K6WLM|5.0|Attack & Release is no doubt the most accessible album released by The Black Keys. It was the first one recorded \\"properly\\", and the sound quality is noticeably more clean.    That said, it does not tamper with the band's raw blues-rock sound. Their first single getting airplay in Detroit, \\"I Got Mine\\" is a mind-blowing rock tune. Attack & Release is perhaps more funky sounding than previous works, such as the strange flute sounds on \\"Same Old Thing\\". \\"Strange Times\\" is a very powerful track, and also can be heard in [[ASIN:B000FRU1UM Grand Theft Auto IV]]. \\"Psychotic Girl\\" is funky and seems to be a crowd favorite during live shows.    Attack & Release is a fresh, blues rock sound that really shows the Black Keys flexibility in the studio. People looking to listen to this band for the first time, try this CD.
0385751532|4.0|I really enjoyed this fictional account of the holocaust, through a innocent child's viewpoint. I agree with the other reviewers, who said that a child brought up in a Nazi household would have been taught about the Jewish people. However, the book is a fictional account. It is also written for a young adult audience, Boyne does a great job of giving a glimpse into the friendship of a Nazi and Jewish child, against the backdrop of a death camp. Boyne does not get too much into the violent aspects of the holocaust, which I think makes it great for young adult readers. I personally would even encourage my middle school students to read this book. Finally, I would also recommend this book to adults, who want an easy read, and who would be interested in a innocent fictional account of the holocaust.  To go along with this book, try reading \\"The Book Theif\\", and \\"Number the Stars\\".[[ASIN:0375842209 The Book Thief]][[ASIN:0440227534 Number the Stars]]
B001F7MSFW|5.0|Were the Hellboy series in anyone else's hands other than Guillermo Del Toro's, who knows how Mike Mignola's beloved creation would be mishandled.  Like the first film before it, Hellboy II: The Golden Army finds the visionary director of Pan's Labyrinth and Blade II bringing Hellboy and his cohorts to vivid life, and doing a spectacular job of it.  The film picks up with Hellboy (Ron Perlman), his pyrotechnic girlfriend Liz (Selma Blair), and fellow B.P.R.D. agent Abe Sapien (Doug Jones) running afoul of a vengeful elf (Luke Goss) who seeks to restore his kingdom's power by awakening a legendary indestructible army to go to war with mankind.  To complicate matters Hellboy gets a new, by-the-book boss in the form of Johan Krauss (who has been brilliantly realized on film, and is wonderfully voiced by Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane), and has some looming problems with his relationship with Liz to boot.  Hellboy II manages to successfully top the first film in nearly every way, featuring some brilliant set-pieces and art design, and some even more spectacular makeup and creature effects.  The world that Del Toro oversees here really is a world of wonder that should not be missed out at all in the least bit, especially if you are a fan of Hellboy.  All in all, Hellboy II: The Golden Army is a wonderful comic book adaptation from a visionary director, and here's hoping that there will be more to come from Del Toro and Hellboy alike.
1580176941|5.0|This book is for people who like to get really obsessive with their cookies.  While it provides an excellent review of the basics of baking cut-out cookies (including recipes), the best part of this book is the discussion of many permutations on the basic outline & flood technique of icing cookies.  It's easy to do, and once you get the hang of it, you'll have fun with all the variations (e.g. flood-on-flood details, flooding over piping for texture, using toothpicks to marble colors).  The book also addresses the use of sugars (both pre- and post-baking), imprinting, stencils, and use of other decorations (nuts, candies, fondant, etc.).  Even if you're experienced with cookie decorating, you'll likely pick up a ton of new ideas, tricks, and tips.  The book itself is very well-organized; the layout and photography are lovely and diagrams are included where appropriate.
0393324818|5.0|Aristotle once argued that there are three main purposes to art and writing: to teach, to delight, and to inspire. Rare is the book that accomplishes all three but Michael Lewis's \\"Moneyball\\" does exactly that: it is all at once a readable economics textbook, a classic good guys versus bad guys page-turner, and an edifying epic.    \\"Moneyball\\" is the story of three obsessive-compulsives -- Bill James, Billy Beane, and Paul DePodesta -- who re-imagined baseball from a game of stars and heroics into one of numbers and discipline.    An unemployed self-declared baseball critic Bill James understood that baseball statistics weren't just numbers and trivia: they were fundamentally a myth and a morality that sought to explain the game. Consider the statistic \\"error\\" which sought to eliminate luck from the game, and is a moral statement on who is at fault. This statistic, like most statistics in baseball, Bill James argued, was pig-headed, wrong, and irrelevant: it neither discounted luck from the game nor properly accounted for why a team won nor helped predict if they would win.    So what does? Here Bill James turned from critic to metaphysic: what really is baseball? It's a game where each team must score as many runs as possible without getting three outs. In other words, while great fielding is beautiful to watch, baseball is fundamentally an offensive game, and Bill James discovered that \\"on-base percentage\\" (the times a hitter gets on base divided by the times a hitter goes to bat) and \\"slugging percentage\\" (the number of runs a team generates each inning divided by the number of batters a team sends to the plate each inning) were the best indicators of a team's future performance.    Of course it didn't matter if Bill James was right or wrong because he was irrelevant. Baseball was a club that was dominated by those who played the game. Players became coaches and general managers and sports commentators, and they all thought alike and treated baseball as a sacredtemple only they could access. Since the mid-eighties fantasy baseball players had taken James and made him into a self-publishing phenomenon, and amateur baseball theorists who counted among them expensively-educated and expensively-paid statisticians were constantly proving and refining James' theories -- but who listened to geeks anyway? The revolution needed to come from within, and it did.    Billy Beane should have been a baseball Hall of Famer -- with his build and athletic prowess he could have been the baseball Hall of Famer. That's what baseball scouts kept on telling him, and while Billy Beane did make the major league his heart really wasn't into baseball, and he was only a little above mediocre. At age 28 -- usually the prime of a baseball player's career -- he did the unthinkable, quit playing, and asked for a scouting job in the Athletic A's organization. And while Billy Beane was a member of baseball's sacred fraternity he had first-hand experience that they could at times be all wrong, and when he became the Oakland A's general manager he began systemically to prove that they were in fact all wrong.    As general manager Billy Beane hired a Harvard number-cruncher Paul DePodesta to implement and refine Bill James' theories. DePodesta made the critical insight that \\"on-base percentage\\" was three times as important as \\"slugging percentage,\\" and used this new knowledge to draft college baseball's most undervalued players. What Billy Beane and Paul DePodesta found was what Bill James had long argued: that the market for baseball players was incredibly inefficient. Players who could get on base and wear out an opposing pitcher -- a team's most important contributors -- were underpriced, and the players who could hit jaw-dropping home-runs after striking out many times and make terrific catches that nevertheless did not alter the inexorable logic of the game were overpriced. By exploiting this market inefficiency Billy Beane and Paul DePodesta created oneof baseball's most winning teams on one of baseball's smallest budgets.    And Billy Beane and Paul DePodesta saved some of baseball's best players from obscurity. Take, for example, Chad Bradford, one of baseball's most consistent closers. But why did no teams want him? He threw underhanded. Baseball teams couldn't dispute the facts -- Chad Bradford was a winner -- but in the end they decided aesthetics were more important than facts.    Then there's Scott Hatteberg, one of baseball's smartest players, and definitely the most patient and disciplined: for him baseball was a mental game, and as the game's most consistent hitter he wore down opposing pitchers by raising the ball count, gleaming valuable information in the process. What was his problem? He wasn't man enough -- not aggressive and reckless enough in the batter's box. In other words he didn't strike out enough -- and it was again Billy Beane who saw the absurdity of mainstream baseball's reasoning and snapped up Scott Hatteberg as soon as he could.    In many ways \\"Moneyball\\" is even more \\"Fountainhead\\" than Ann Rayn's best-selling classic. Like Howard Roark Billy Beane is not a person you'd like to meet. Nevertheless, motivated by his insatiable need to win, he is fighting against the forces of stupidity and unreason, and in so doing making a world a better place. And it is a credit to Michael Lewis's patience and discipline as a writer to just let this great story tell itself.    \\"Moneyball\\" is a brilliant achievement.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|Once again CGI animated films have shown they can stand up against live action films. Kung Fu Panda is another excellent movie with a stellar cast that will keep young and old alike entertained from start to finish. This martial arts based movie has beautiful serene settings, fast and furious action and hip and hilarious comedy. Jack Black with his zany style seems to have been born to play Po.  The animation is first rate,  inspired story and characters and a lot of fun to watch! the DVD transfer is first rate and the DVD has some interesting extra material including commentary, making of and much more.
1569242739|5.0|Unlike others i went straight for a hard recipe. Well, for me at least :) Orange creamsicle cupcakes! After my bf helped me figure out I would have to turn up the heat a little to make the orange pudding, (evil electric stove) it was smooth sailing. They came out fantastic and noone at the party had any idea they were vegan until we told them. The orange buttercream frosting is to die for btw.  I also made the mexican cocoa cupcakes that day. They tasted great but i had a little spill over and the tops kept popping off. I think that was me, not the recipe!
0765316897|5.0|I finished HoA just a few minutes ago, and I must say that it was absolutely one of the most shocking and rewarding reads that I can remember.  It took me five or ten minutes to recover my senses and realize how much I truly loved the ending.  I started trying to explain it to my wife (not much of a fantasy reader) and found myself rambling on and on incoherently for several minutes!    As many others have pointed out, Sanderson has a remarkable and unique talent for composing a world and a plot that is so thoroughly and completely coherent that each new revelation is sweet and logical.  It is very satisfying to read a story that is perfectly planned and founded throughout.      This trilogy is a must-read for anyone looking for entertainment, enlightenment, and maybe even a fresh set of personal heroes.  Keep up the good work, Brandon!
0930289234|5.0|Moore used the story as a means to reflect contemporary anxieties and to deconstruct the superhero concept. Watchmen takes place in an alternate history United States where the country is edging closer to a nuclear war with the Soviet Union. After government-sponsored superhero The Comedian is found murdered, the vigilante Rorschach warns his former colleagues of what he believes is a conspiracy to kill costumed heroes. As the story progresses, the protagonists discover that one of the heroes has devised a plan to stave off war between the United States and the USSR by carrying out a plan that will kill millions of innocent people.<br /><br />Creatively, the focus of Watchmen is on its structure. Gibbons used a nine-panel grid layout throughout the series and added recurring symbols such as a blood-stained smiley face. All but the last issue feature supplemental fictional documents that add to the series' backstory, and the narrative is intertwined with that of a another story, a fictional pirate comic titled Tales of the Black Freighter, which one of the characters is reading.<br /><br />WATCHMEN, Mickey Mouse and THE TWILIGHT ZONE are the three biggst pop culture phenomenons of the 20th Century. James Bond comes close, but the franchise has yet to reach maximum potential. Amazon.com does offer THE TWILIGHT ZONE: UNLOCKING THE DOOR TO A TELEVISION CLASSIC by Martin Grams Jnr. which covers the entire series with 800 plus pages of behind-the-scenes trivia, exclusive interviews with cast and crew and a detail level will exceed anyone's expectation. Amazon also offers KISS KISS, BANG BANG by Alan Barnes and Marcus Hearn, which is a geek's shrine to all things James Bond. Buy both books and THE WATCHMEN and you will see the world through another vision.
B00079FUI6|5.0|I never watched it when it first started until a month ago when I saw it on Life Time TV-...and I am HOOKED!!!  It's that good! Can't wait to see Season Two which it on its way to my house in two days!
B000VZUWZW|5.0|My wife and I discovered this show last year from an article in Science Magazine.  We learned that the show has physicists on staff to help with the writing and to keep the science accurate.  That may be one reason we like it.  But, mostly, we like this series because it is so funny, and we absolutely love all the main characters.  I couldn't believe the number of 1-star ratings in these customer reviews, so I read a few.  Seems the biggest complaint concerns the supposed \\"laugh track.\\"  However, according to Wikipedia and other sources, BBT is taped in front of a live studio audience.  I can believe it because this is definitely a laugh-out-loud kind of show.
B00005JNTX|5.0|This movie took me by surprise.  I new who Frank Miller was but had never really seen any of his work.  However after watching this movie I feel that I have been missing out.  There is a great story that unfolds through out the entire movie.  Everyone of the different characters are rich and interesting.  Needless to say this is not a kid friendly movie, but for those who are a little older and aren't to squeamish, then this is a movie that you may want to check out.

B00003CXZ4|5.0|Definitely strange, interesting and fun!!! Very unique idea for a film!!!<br /><br />This movie is for the \\"COMPLEX THINKER\\" or the \\"DYSLEXIC MIND\\" ...few can put this movie together in less than 2 or 3 viewings. This film literally runs forward from the end of the movie yet backwards at the same time; adding supposed real-time moments where the main character is on the phone or reminiscing about things he remembers before his assault.<br /><br />Strangely enough, I got this movie the first time viewing it!! Hm?<br /><br />To fully get this award winning \\"never been done before\\" storyline you'll quickly discover that you're viewing the movie in reverse while the chapter's (scene's) are running forward... maybe better said as, \\"The last scene/end of the movie is run forward first as the movie starts - then things reverse so you start at the beginning of each prior scene (that you haven't seen yet) watch it to it's end - arriving at the last (prior) scene's start and so on\\"!!!<br /><br />Got that?<br /><br />Then if that wasn't enough you'll soon discover that this is a movie about a man who's short term memory has been lost (brain trauma) by an assault on him and his wife. His wife is apparently killed and he can only remember up to that moment (birth until trauma). New memories can never be formed and since he's decided to solve his wife's murder and his assault he has to write himself notes and other various extreme things so as to remember what he has discovered from day to day ...or is it month to month? ...year to year??<br /><br />The day after this movie, if you aren't the thinker type you're brain will definitely hurt!!!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I had four of the seasons individually and grabbed this set when Amazon ran it in the Gold Box for $114.99. What an awesome deal! As soon as I got the set, I watched from it the pilot to the finale. I laughed, I cried, I loved and lost. I really enjoyed watching the characters and style of the show evolve. I do not always agree with the politics, but the mechanics of how it works is still amazing, even though \\"There are two things you never want to see made, laws and sausages.\\"<br />As far as the set itself, I like that the discs are one-sided, some of the indidividual season sets I owned previously were two-sided discs. I also like that the discs are numbered 1-45 for the entire series and not 1-x by season, they make it very easy to keep them all straight. The packaging itself is very clever and the book of the pilot script with intro from Aaron Sorking is a great bonus for the fan. I highly recommend watching the Amazon daily deals for this set!
B00005221M|4.0|I really liked this movie and watch it whenever it's on TV. This movie and a handful of others I never tire of. Daniel Day Lewis is such a good actor(a must see in \\"The Crucible\\"). The ambush , youngest sister on the cliff and burn at the stake are very intense scenes. I say watch it!
0321344758|5.0|Easy to read, and very accurate, I highly recommend this book if you are in any way involved with web design, layout, style, or usability of a site, then this is a must read book. Thank you Steve Krug.
6305922756|5.0|A must see for anyone who was ever in a \\"ROCK\\" band and or who has been associated with bands for more than a couple of years!!!<br /><br />This is \\"Behind The Music\\" before VH1 and MTV!!! Every facet of every scene was true of someone you may have known, which makes it even more hilarious as all the character's, confrontations, trial's and tribulation's all come together at once... here and now so to speak.<br /><br />This movie is a highlight reel!!! Too real... too funny ...too close to home!!!<br /><br />LOVE IT!!!
B00000J9HF|5.0|This is a very good recording of this work. It's a lyrical opera of Verdi. Marvelous singing and orchestra that is at top. I love this much, and I shuld wish it had a little bit better sound. The sound is not bad at all. It's more than just good. Not perferct, but nearly. I can strongly recomend this.
B001KR1H0Y|5.0|This episode is the best one since Daniel Jackson was on there.It goes in depth with Michael and his hybrids and show what can happen if and when Ancient Technology falls into the wrong hands.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|If you're looking for thrills, action, and or hollywood effects, this won't be your movie yet if you enjoy storytelling... WOW!!!<br /><br />Everyone has their \\"ONE\\" story... something that changes ones perspective on how they view things and or what the meaning of things are; like your first encounter with taste, a smell, the stars, a train, a butterfly, etc... it all remains relative to your perception and takes on its meaning in your life and the world in which you live.<br /><br />This is such a story... two men's journey or better said, \\"One man's first impression of another man and then ultimately both their journey's\\".<br /><br />This story starts as all stories do... meeting a few characters yet in this movie you watch Andy Dufrane (Robbins) develop both through the camera's eye and then through Red's eyes (Freeman)! Bottom line? This is a story of how one mans life is changed by another mans struggle with his [yet] ironically both are in prison for life ...so time isn't an issue.<br /><br />To do this story justice it has to be told slowly [so] yes, as when all view a movie for the first time I too thought, \\"This is way too slow and drawn out!! What is this movie leading up too?\\" To my amazement and enjoyment I hung in there because I have to say,\\"When it was all over I knew I had seen a movie like no other before it... you will cheer and appreciate this movie as it draws near to its end.<br /><br />The real cool part? This movie holds a surprise twist near its end - that no one - not even Red ever expected!!!<br /><br />-- What a wonderful way to end this movie!!! EXCELLENT!!! AWESOME!!! BRAVO!!!
B000FSME1A|5.0|WOW! What an improvement. When I first saw the original, I thought:here's finally a movie for Vietnam vets. The cinematography and acting were great, but it looked like it had been edited with a hacksaw. Why is Lance water-skiing with Air CAv shorts before they run into the 1/9? And where did he get 'em? Where does he get that compact when he's putting on the camo face paint? Is that standard issue on a PBR? What's Kilgore's surfboard doing on the boat? How did it get there?Why is Clean so trigger-happy when they stop the sampan? And what happens to him after he's killed? They just throw his body overboard? That seems unlikely given the elaborate send-off Lance gives the Chief after he's wasted.    These questions and more are answered in this greatly expanded version of what's now my favorite movie. Alot has been made of how much the French Plantation Scene slows down the action. But I find it analogous to the Night Music in Stavinsky's Rite of Spring: after all the violence and discord you get a few minutes of breathing space before the insanity starts again. I speak French so maybe it's easier for me to relate to what's going     Unfortunately, not much can be done with the bizarre and incoherent last 20 minutes( the included deleted scenes at least show us what happended to the Photo-journalist and Colby and even give us the very interesting Monkey Sampan). But getting there has been maded so much more enjoyhable.    Anyway, this is a considerable improvement on an already great movie. Now, if they'd just bring it out in Blu-ray.
B0017M8XS6|5.0|There are a couple other reviews that Amazon has included here that are of OTHER versions of Brain Salad Surgery. Check the review dates, if they are before October 2008, they don't belong here. This new edition has three discs. It should have only had two, as the first disc is the same compressed mix issued by Rhino over a decade ago. Any fan of this album will have already wasted their money on that. The second disc with the \\"unreleased until 35th anniversary versions\\" is the reason to buy this deluxe edition! Never before have I heard the dynamics that only existed in my head since hearing this record as a teenager. All the instruments are clear yet retain the original balance of the 1973 mix. I have bought this album 1. on viny1, 2. the Rhino release, 3. The DVD-Audio version, 4. and now this one. I could have skipped 2 and 3, except for the 5.1 version of Lucky Man on the DVD-A. Finally a decent stereo version! Like the other reviewer, the SACD sounds better than the DVD-A just because it has better bass management. I don't agree with some of the sloppy mixing decisions in the 5.1 mix, it disappoints with 'happy panning' that is just irritating. There are snippets of beauty then something stupid bounces around. Again, the money is worth having the great 35th Anniversary stereo mixes! A masterpeice of progressive rock, full of its pompous bombastic self.
0307455874|1.0|Unfortunately there is no there there. There are thoughts that don't lead to actual solutions, and platitudes that tickle but don't equal substantive change.
045122499X|5.0|As an engineer and an avid fan of historical novels I have found both novels exceptional.  Follett delivers exceptional characters and captivating delivery, but he also discusses real engineering issues.  Who knows, perhaps this is how builders first came to struggle with wind loading and river scour.  Real issues handled in a manner that makes them approachable by the reader.  I am very impressed with the level of research put forward.  I consider both books among the best I have read.
B00168HARG|2.0|As much as fans eventually hated it, [[ASIN:B0013ND36G Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines [Blu-ray]]] is lights years ahead of this tedious show. You might end up wondering how the timeline in this show can exist considering the story of T3, but if you consider that this was Skynet's fourth attempt at killing John Connor AFTER the TX failed then it would create a tangent timeline in which the events of T3 would never happen.<br /><br />The show doesn't even attempt to explain this to us, however. I hate exposition as much as the next viewer, but TSCC has no sense of time, character or importance of event. Nothing is clearly presented to the audience and it's hard to keep with the barely interesting story. It's bad writing, plain and simple. And the constant in-jokes (a robot called Cameron, a character called William Wisher) are another sign of lazy writing which leads me to believe that the show is written by fanboys instead of qualified writers. Even this I could turn a blind eye to if they stayed true to the original story, but they tamper with too much of James Cameron's history. For example; Kyle Reese says he grew up after the nuclear war in [[ASIN:B000F9RB9Y The Terminator [Blu-ray]]], but here we see him and his previously unmentioned brother playing baseball on Judgment Day (now moved to 2011). And why didn't Skynet send back another T1000 instead of the old T800? It's not model 101 this time since Arnie wouldn't embarrass himself with trash like this, but it would have made sense to send a mimetic poly-alloy instead of the metal endo-skeleton surrounded by living tissue.<br /><br />However, doing it that way might have ended the show on day one, and the folks at the WB need to s-t-r-e-t-c-h this junk out as far as possible.<br /><br />Lena Headey is visually similar to Linda Hamilton, but I never liked the direction they took the character in [[ASIN:B000EWBKKI Terminator 2: Judgment Day [Blu-ray]]], where she becomes hardcore warrior (almost a human terminator herself) who narrates every scene with a pointless and pretentious voice-over. There's very little to like about her in this show, mostly because she never displays any kind of affection for anyone around her, even her son.<br /><br />Summer Glau is the only reason for watching this. Any scene that does not feature her threatens to kill the series dead on the spot. Some of this stuff is really painful, especially the Dr. Silberman plot. Not only is it incredibly disrespectful to what James Cameron had created, but they didn't even get Earl Boen back. Instead they got someone who looks and acts nothing like him. It feels like a totally different person and you can tell that he's only in there to stretch the lumbering story out further. Even composer Bear McReary seems frightened of using Brad Fiedel's iconic Terminator theme (and, let's be honest, it was the only noteworthy theme in Feidel's lackluster career). The score for the show is instead made up of noises and sound effects with the slightest of themes repeated in each episode with no variation. Plus, the existence of the Terminators after the destruction of Cyberdyne is still not clearly explained either.<br /><br />I know a lot of shows struggle during their first season, maybe this is why the network gave TSCC the benefit of the doubt and ordered a full second season. But this nine episode Blu Ray is only worth the money if your a serious fan, and even then you're likely to be disappointed.<br /><br />The Blu Ray features a 1.78:1 1080p picture that doesn't impress a helluva lot and an adequate sound design with lots of extras I couldn't care less about.es every scene with a pointless and pretentious voice-over.

B0002EQ7E2|5.0|I can't hear the compelling opening bars of any of these songs without tearing up; this album was my family's traveling music twenty years ago, when our kids were little.  My husband had checked it out of the library, and we listened to it over and over as we drove through the deserts of southwestern Colorado and Utah. The driving beat was perfect for a road trip, especially the title song.  But my favorite song is \\"Under African Skies\\".  When I hear any of these songs, I think of my kids twenty years ago, and all the great times we had on those road trips, and I'm filled with a sweet nostalgia.

Love this book.
B000002KIE|1.0|My good gracious, this album is simply appalling! The Sex Pistol's other album, \\"London Calling\\" was pretty bad too, but this was simply awful! If you want REAL punk, check out Green Day's album \\"American Idiot\\". I think Green Day has a thing or two to teach these talentless clowns!
B001DTPZNY|4.0|I agree with Amazon's reviewer, Ellen Kim, that this chapter in the Indiana Jones 'serials' is the weakest, but still great handfuls of fun.  I think where it weakens is where Lucas and Spielberg don't entirely trust Indy to carry the film on his own amusing shoulders and instead pack the film full of CGI effects ... lots of them.  Indy is really the only movie hero who we watch because he is smart and witty and lovable.  His character is just about enough ... leave CGI to Pirates of the Caribbean. -- That said, this welcomed return of Indy unites him with a young rebel, Mutt Williams, on a search for a missing colleague of Dr Jones' -- Professor Harold Oxley.  In addition, Indy and Mutt must reach a legendary lost city via an alien skull before the Russians do (so that the Russians -- 1957 Russians, mind you -- can't rule the world ... somehow).  This all leads him back to Marion Ravenwood ... our real first love. -- The first half of this movie looks, feels and stirs viewers (old enough to remember sneaking into the theater to get mind-blown by Raider of Lost Ark) like vintage Indiana Jones.  The 2nd half is almost lost to the CGI fun-park that ensues.  Fine for other movies, but we watch and Indy movie to see Indy.  But the movie ends on a really touching note and the promise of more.  I really hope there's more.  Until then, there's this.  And that's fine.
B000001FFJ|1.0|This \\"Tom Waits\\" guy sucks. What a horrible voice! He sounds like a piece of raw meat ran over by a truck. Listen to REAL music like Nickelback or St. Anger by Metallica if you want a truly enjoyable listening experience.

B000IMUYJM|4.0|Finally seeing it after all too long, I was glad to see that Black Christmas really holds up. The story of a regular group of sorority girls stalked and murdered by a madman is very much a chilling, suspenseful and engrossing tale. What really works best is how the killer, who is perhaps called Billy, is kept entirely a mystery. We don't know where he comes from, why he does what he does, and often see things from his perspective up in the dark attic. His rants, screams, whispers, glances and shadow is what makes for a really frightening film to this very day.<br /><br />There are weaker parts to the film though. Margot Kidder is at the forefront of weak sex jokes, and there's also a lot of goofing off with police detectives trying to crack the case.<br /><br />Overall, I can highly recommend Black Christmas. But this is a case where the original and remake is night and day, so make sure you see the original film. It will give you shivers just in time for a cozy Christmas night, when you're not sure who is coming to visit at night..
B00008J4P5|4.0|I give this album four stars just for Meg's impressive drumming alone. She really knows how to jam out on drums! Move over \\"Keith Moon\\", you've got some competition! Unfortunately, Jack White has no talent and makes this album crap, but Meg saves it. Bravo, Meg!
B000UNYK3A|2.0|Hostel gathered a lot of controversy upon release, and has spawned a generally queasy set of audience reactions. Many have responded with hatred towards the violent and unflinching nature of the film. My problem with it doesn't lie with the violence.<br /><br />I can't connect to the first half of the film, which is mostly about regular foolish male behaviour while backpacking in central Europe. All of that becomes a long wait to see what awaits in the second half, and it provides very little buildup to what we'll eventually have to endure.<br /><br />All of the violence in the film is harsh, personal and disturbing. It's not entertaining, but in a broader sense, pretty interesting. It makes you wonder about the world, and what dark places may exist where anything or anyone can be purchased for the right price.<br /><br />This DVD contains some pretty good featurettes, and overall a really good set of extras, including one featurette which is almost entirely about the inspiration and reaction for the film, and how much of it is based in reality. Eli Roth is certainly an intelligent man, and he's out to tell a message, not only shock, but due to the harsh and stark nature of the film, it's hard to digest, and it's overall too uncomfortable to be really memorable. Maybe there's a little too much truth to Hostel.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Who needs manufactured chick singers like Nico, Patti Smith or PJ Harvey when you have a REAL singer like Ms.Spears? It's obvious that the first three I mentioned have been using computers to enhance their voices, while Britney has raw talent! She can belt out a tune like no other with true grit. You really feel like she's singing just for you. 5 stars, bravo, Ms.Spears! You've outdone yourself.
B00005JPS8|5.0|IRON MAN is a total blast.  My husband and I have not had this much fun watching a movie in a long time.  Based on the Marvel comic book and created by the brilliant Stan Lee, IRON MAN is a super-hero, a science fiction, an action-action adventure, and a heartwarming, feel-good movie, all rolled into one.<br /><br />In IRON MAN, Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is a playboy genius, a cross between DaVinci, Tesla, and Don Juan.  As the CEO of Stark Industries, he has single handedly revolutionized the defense industry in his attempt to bring security and peace to the world.  When he is kidnapped by terrorists, Tony Stark realizes that the technology he has been steadily inventing since he was a child is falling into the wrong hands, bringing devastation and death to those he is trying to protect.  In captivity, Stark builds the prototype IRON MAN suit, and escapes.  Back at home, Stark has a crisis of conscience and decides to stand down Stark Industries weapons divisions.  Building the ultimate mech suit, Stark becomes IRON MAN, and single handedly sets out to end terrorism and save the world.  Of course, nothing is ever easy...<br /><br />All of the performances in IRON MAN are excellent and very enjoyable.  Robert Downey, Jr.'s transition from philandering whiz kid to caring, sincere patriot who wants to do the right thing is outstanding and real.  The rest of this fantastic cast (Gwyneth Paltrow, Terrance Howard, Jeff Bridges, Shaun Toub) are equally good, creating believable, genuine characters, both good and evil.  The special effects rock, and are seamless and very fun.  The computer that runs Stark's home and inhabits the IRON MAN suit is very funny, exhibiting an acerbic wit that must have been very fun to write.<br /><br />There are some pretty big clues that are more IRON MAN movies to come.  I sure hope so.  I can't wait to see IRON MAN continue his fight for \\"truth, justice, and the American way.\\"

B001E7OO2I|4.0|From the time I first heard John Legend's \\"Green Light\\" featuring Andre 3000, I knew that his forthcoming October 2008 album EVOLVER would be different from his previously critically lauded GET LIFTED (2004) and ONCE AGAIN (2006).  I wouldn't go so far as to say that EVOLVER is terrible as some critics and fans have said, but it is a different Legend album, save for the incredible soulful voice that remains unscathed by the hip-hop production. Also, I don't think \\"different\\" is bad either in this case - I actually like the album, though it doesn't work as well as his two previous albums.  It is perhaps the first truly flawed Legend album.  And what flaws it isn't necessarily the \\"R. Kelly\\" moves that Legend makes, but rather some of the songwriting is a bit blander than usual.  There are still hits, but nothing here is necessarily of the same magnitude of \\"Use To Love You\\", \\"Ordinary People\\", \\"Save Room\\", \\"Heaven\\", or \\"Show Me\\".  However, there are a couple of important tracks - it is John Legend, one of the voices of \\"nu-soul\\" after all!<br /><br />The album opens up with an intro, \\"Good Morning\\" in which it sounds like John Legend has a had an erotic night of passion.  This track is insignificant for the most part, but it does signal that Legend is getting his \\"mack\\" on on this album as opposed to his more refined neo-soul tracks from his previous albums.  \\"Green Light\\", the first single featuring Andre 3000 demonstrates this concession with its hip-hop beat that sounds like he could've \\"copped\\" from an OutKast album.  Those who loved previous first Legend singles \\"Use To Love You\\" or \\"Save Room\\" may be  a bit surprised or disappointed, but honestly, despite a more contemporary sound, Legend sounds as good as ever and the track is solid by all means.  Keeping up the momentum is my personal favorite, \\"It's Over\\" features the newly vocoder-converted Kanye West.  The track is  a collaborative writing effort between Pharrell Williams (The Neptunes) and Kanye West.  The production is exceptional and John Legend soulful infused vocals sound perhaps the best of the entire album. West even sounds good utilizing the vocoder (singing), which ends up being a pleasant surprise (can't wait to buy 808s & HEARTBREAK). This production has a hip-hop influence, thought it is just as soulful as anything John Legend has ever performed.  This would make an exceptional choice for a single.<br /><br />\\"Everybody Knows\\" returns Legend back to his soulful roots absence of studio tricks, which is good for those who feel his makeover isn't truly Legend.  \\"Everybody Knows\\" is another favorite.  The Brandy duet on \\"Quickly\\" is solid as well, if not as sound as the previous performances.  It's potent enough, though not like the best of Legend.  \\"Cross That Line\\" balances the soul with the glitz of contemporary production with its \\"hard drums\\".  It is successful and blends the best of both worlds as opposed to showing two differing John Legends.  \\"No Other Love\\" is an exceptional cut from EVOLVER that sits Legend and the up and coming Estelle atop a brilliant tropical beat/production.  Here both Legend and Estelle blend almost celestially and the vocal performances are particularly grand.  \\"This Time\\" is not quite \\"Ordinary People\\" from GET LIFTED, but it is similar in sound (save for the synths used).  It isn't quite a hit, but it is solid.  \\"Satisfaction\\" is enjoyable, produced by standout producer will.i.am (Black Eyed Peas).  After that, the album generally falls a bit flat.  \\"Take Me Away\\", \\"Good Morning\\", and \\"I Love, You Love\\" are OK, but they don't represent the full potential of a singer the magnitude of Legend.  \\"If You're Out There\\" is a solid closer and overall strong, thought perhaps not as strong as the very best (\\"Green Light\\", \\"It's Over\\", \\"No Other Love\\", etc.)<br /><br />Overall, this album is good, though not great like the other two Legend albums.  It is imperfect, but it is still enjoyable and worthy of note.  If you are a Legend fanand love to hear his soulful, distinctive voice, then you should purchase EVOLVER. 3 ½ stars.soulful, distinctive voice, then you should purchase EVOLVER. 3 ½ stars.

0385340990|5.0|This was a delightful, entertaining and interesting book that I am so glad I read. I enjoyed learning about the history of Guernsey and the people connected to the island, the friendships that were more like family and the lives they led. Because the stories were told through letters, it was a quick read that moved swiftly. One of my favorite things about the book was the many references to classic literature, the authors and the characters in their books. It really was a joy to read and although I don't re-read many books, I would consider changing my view for this one. I just have to mention one more thing about the actual book that I really appreciated. It has a sewn-in dark green ribbon to keep your place as you read. Not many books have those anymore and I know it's just a small thing, but I thought it was a really nice touch.<br /><br />For my complete review please visit: [...]

But I still found myself not wanting to put it down! If you have read the first two books in this sequal and you liked/loved them, then you will really enjoy this book.
B00005JKC3|1.0|Hulk is the biggest disaster of 2003. Not sure why director Ang Lee would take this movie on, thank god for Brokeback Mountain or I would have thought he was losing his mind. Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly are talented actors but they look so uncomfortable here, it's painful to watch. Haven't seen the new Hulk, I heard it's better than this one. I just hated this film, too long and boring.

I fortunately bought this CD in 1991 which featured the original artwork of a handsome young man. It is just a shame what has happened to his appearance.  In addition, I wish that Epic Records or MJJ Productions would release the original version (that went to #1) of \\"Rock With You\\" without the hand claps and finger pops as  a way to preserve the original album and song.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I own the mini-series version of Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth, which is more true to the book, but I think this is the more entertaining film. Other reviewers have discussed the difference in performances by actors who are closer to the actual ages of the characters in the book and the more realistic setting. One difference between book and movie that I appreciated was the director's take on the relationship between the Bennet parents and his expansion of the minor characters. Here, Mr. Bennet is both exasperated by and in love with Mrs. Bennet; Mr. Collins is as annoying as ever, but we also sympathize with his vulnerability and social awkwardness. Elizabeth's sister Mary is still a preachy bluestocking, but the film doesn't just make fun of her; we also her as the awkward teenage girl who sobs in her father's arms after being embarrassed at the ball. The five girls are very convincing as sisers and their embarassing mama loves them dearly. Bingley is as shy as Jane and here we see Darcy helping him rehearse his marriage proposal to her. Darcy and Elizabeth seem a little more raw and REAL here. The director has really gotten at the humanity of all of the characters here in a way that adds a lot to the film. That, and it's not six hours long, which should appeal to anyone who doesn't have the patience to sit through the mini-series.
B001E75QGG|4.0|Over the last several years we as moviegoers have seen a resurgence of sorts amongst our former big screen heroes and legends. Beginning in 2005, with the excellent resurrection of the Batman franchise with Christopher Nolan's gritty and much more realistic \\"Batman Begins\\", followed in 2006 by Rocky and James Bond returning in \\"Rocky Balboa\\" and \\"007: Casino Royale\\" respectively, also that year marked the triumphant big screen return for one of the greatest heroes of all time, the man of steel in \\"Superman Returns\\". So, with all of these film franchises being dusted off to continue on or just rebooting to start things off fresh, it seems to make perfect sense that after a nearly 20 year absence from theaters, that acclaimed director Steven Spielberg and producer George Lucas would bring back their iconic collaboration, the treasure hunting archaeologist Dr. Henry \\"Indiana\\" Jones, Jr. for another adventure with \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\".    \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" is set in 1957, as Dr. Henry Jones, Jr. is yet again finding himself on the run from foreign agents. This time he's not trying to outwit the Nazis; instead, it's the Russian KGB on his tail, led by a dangerous, power-hungry agent (Kate Blanchett) in search of the mythical crystal skull of Akator. With the aid of his former love, Marion (Karen Allen) and a biker named Mutt (Shia LaBeouf), Indy must face odds the likes of which only he could call fair, all in an effort to ensure that these powerful and priceless artifacts never fall into the wrong hands.    After being away from the big screen for 19 years, the announced return of Indiana Jones was sure to inspire droves of fans to begin wishing about what they would like to see their hero do in his next adventure. No doubt just like with the Star Wars prequel trilogy, expectations went so high that no movie was ever going to be able to meet them. So, here we are after several years had passed since thefirst announcement was made in the early nineties about a fourth Indy film, and promise after promise being made over the years by George Lucas, or someone else associated with the movie, that another adventure was coming, the time has finally arrived, and the results were... Well, quite mixed from fans, to say the least.    Many fans felt that this installment lacked that special something that made the original trilogy so great. There were some fans that enjoyed this newest adventure, feeling that it was just as good as a majority of the original trilogy, or at least on par with them. I for one fall into the category of a fan that enjoyed the original series, and found this one to be on par with the majority of the other installments; perhaps a bit lower than the standard set by \\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\\".    Is this a perfect movie? No, not by any means, and I admit that there are some aspects of the film I wish could have been removed or reduced here and there; yet for the most part I found this sequel to be completely entertaining and plenty of fun for the family. As for the story of \\"Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\", writer David Koepp (\\"Spider-Man\\") did a very good job of evolving the character naturally from where we'd seen him last, into this much more weathered archaeologist/tomb raider; and by realistically representing Harrison Ford's age as being that of Indy's so as not to stretch believability too far with what the character can do. I personally appreciated this effort on the writer's part by allowing for the 19 years that had passed in reality, to be the exact same as what has passed in the franchise's history so that everything done within the story holds more merit. Some have complained that the movie went too much into the science-fiction realm, and should have stayed more in the supernatural realm as the original three movies had done. I can't really agree on that point, because if you think about it science-fiction and supernatural elements kind of go hand-and-hand. So, to say that for instance \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" was obviously supernatural by dealing with God, and the power of the Ark of the Covenant, but that it wasn't sci-fi doesn't make any sense to me. I'm not saying that God or anything related to him is science-fiction, but most of the movies that deal with that area tend to fall into the sci-fi category; thus, the alien element in this film isn't that much of a stretch. I also, liked that they clearly linked this film to the original film with many nods throughout the story; this to me was most likely done in an attempt to show you where the seeds for this story were planted way back then. This was further evidence that this film's storyline came as a natural progression for the series, not something completely out of left field as others have protested.    For those audience members that chastised this film for not including enough action from Indy, and relying far too much on Shia to get a lot of the action done; personally, I think you all should get a life. But, I'll address the issue all the same, because it's annoying to me and I want to say my piece about it. If you were one of the many that wanted another Indiana Jones adventure with Harrison Ford then you got one, but you have to realize something, the man is in his sixties now; therefore, he can't do everything he used to do 19 years ago or more. If you would have rather they recast the role (which I doubt you would) then you would have all griped about how it's not the same as when Harrison played the role. Basically, you can't have your cake and eat it too. Either you wanted another Indy adventure with Harrison or you recast it? Those were the options, take them or leave them? I for one, am pleased that they didn't recast the role, and thought that Harrison, although much older now than he was in the last adventure, still did an admirable job of playing the character believably and was still able to handle himself easily enough in the various fight sequences he found himself in. Were there times when it seemed apparent that the torch was being semi-passed to Shia for the action/adventure stuff? Of course, he was the obvious choice in the cast. But, at least he's an up-and-coming young star, who is amassing quite an impressive fan base, and is a skilled actor that can handle the action and the drama equally. So, if the series had to be handed off eventually, at least they picked an actor that could actually handle the mantle rather than crumble beneath the weight of it.    The casting for the film was exceptional. Harrison once again does an excellent job with the character. Getting to play Indy as a much more mature character than he had been in previous movies must have been fun for him, plus it was nice to see the little nods to what he knows he could have done in years past, but age just won't allow any more. The return of Karen Allen to the role of Marion was a nice touch, she was much better in the role this time around than she was in \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\". Out of all the different women in the series, I'm glad they chose to bring her back, because frankly, Willie would have been just too annoying to see again. Shia LaBeouf (\\"Transformers\\") was a welcome addition as Indy's reluctant new sidekick, as it were. He played a typical tough guy from the fifties, seemingly obsessed with his hair and his leather jacket; yet fiercely loyal to his friends and family. Rounding out the supporting cast we have Cate Blanchett (\\"Elizabeth 2: The Golden Age\\") as the despicable KGB agent trying to use Indy to gain access to the powerful crystal skulls. I thought that Kate was very good in the role, and having the Russians be the primary enemy in this installment made sense given that the Nazis were hardly a concern any longer in the grand scheme of things. Lastly, we have Ray Winstone (\\"The Departed\\") as Indy's partner of questionable loyalty. Ray played the part in such a duplicitous way that I never knew for sure which side his character was actually on until the end. His was truly one of the better red herrings/betrayers throughout the series' history.    \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" is a truly entertaining return to the big screen for the so-called \\"Man in the Hat\\". While some moments within the movie cause the story to stumble about here and there; overall, the final result is a fun-filled adventure that perfectly continues this long-lasting film series that families can enjoy time and again.    \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" is rated PG-13 for violence and brief language.

B000002BFZ|5.0|I got this CD when it first came out through Columbia House.  At the time it was an unintentional purchase (forgot to send back one of their release of the month cards) but I thought that I would give it a listen just so it wasn't a waste of money.  At first it didn't stack up to previous Pearl Jam releases.  But after listening to it a few times I started to like it, then over the years, fall in love with the album.  It's almost a friend now, about once a month I have to pop it back in my CD player and it's just... about as near perfection as an album can be.  It's honest and that's just so rare.
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|I have been a Portishead fan from the start and at first I was a little uneasy with the heavyness of the music on this Third disc.  Now that I have listened to it over 200 times, I must say it is my #1 pick of 2008.  Portishead continues to evolve and this is the future. They are the top of the \\"trip hop\\" food chain and as for the other reviews that dogged this \\"don't you evah,\\" and you wouldn't know good music if it beat you toa pulp.   This is a work of Art and deserves the highest of recognition. Buy it, listen to it and then listen again. If it doesn't blow your mind then save it for your future mind. It is way ahead of it's time.

B000YABYLA|5.0|In my opinion this is a very good film. I am rating it a five because although slightly unconventional it really did work.       The dialogue is at times smart, but most importantly it gives depth to its characters.      Juno's character is not main stream or linear at all- she is smart, rebellious, independent and happy to be an outcast. She is also mature for a 16 year old, though she doesn't seem to think so. She becomes pregnant at 16 and well the film is basically about how she confronts and deals with her problem. Her solution- not typical Hollywood at all. Thus, why it originated as an independent film- great writing.     There is Paulie, a loser (not necessarily in the bad sense- he is very sweet) by most people's standards and the unborns daddy. You don't see much of him but when he is on screen its basically to build on the dynamic of the relationship that he has with Juno. Once more the ending, how things end up is in a sense not conventional for Hollywood, in another typical Hollywood- but hey we love that sort of stuff.    Vanessa and Mark are pretty standard characters but their relationship (they are husband and wife) takes a twist.    Bren and Mac are the loving and supportive parents (one is a step parent) of Juno.       The film is smart and well written. The end of the film pulls at the heart strings (I teared a bit.)     I would say that this film is a good film for adults, and def something that can be shown to ages 12+ (assuming you are not a very conservative parent.)
B00001QEE9|5.0|I first saw this movie as a child some sixty-five years ago and have always remembered it fondly.  Now, having my first grandchild, I began to wonder if it was really as good as I thought it was and if my granddaughter might enjoy seeing it too.    What a joy!  Walt Disney's Pinocchio is everything I remembered it to be.  The musical score is enchanting and the art work superb.  Truly remarkable, the art work, drawn by true craftsmen, makes modern computer graphics look shallow and sickly by comparison.  The principle characters are equally well done and charmingly presented.  And, best of all, Pinocchio's story carries with it three important moral lessons which every child should learn: If you want to be a real boy [or girl] you must listen to your parents and let your conscience be your guide; if you tell a lie it will be as plain as the nose on your face; and if you don't follow your conscience and mind your parents, you'll most likely go astray and make a jackass of yourself.    This is simply a great film and a great story with a great message, and is suitable for viewing by every child and child at heart from the age of five to at least one hundred and five.  Too bad the limit is five stars.  This film and those who made it certainly deserve much more.
B000RZOR2U|5.0|I first wrote this review in 2003 for the previous incarnation of this set. I see that it is now down to under $250 in its new compact format. When I acquired the original LP sets (with scores) between 1971 & 1989 the cost was over $1,300. It is still the greatest and most powerful recording in existence of these works, for, with its various blemishes, it contains the most eloquent musicianship of the pioneers of the Early Music revival from Vienna and Amsterdam. The blemishes are important too, as they eloquently document the rapid development of skills necessary to realise one of the leading musical ideas of our time: attempting to get as close as possible to the actual sounds the composers heard when they wrote their music. As a next-generation member of this fraternity (I am a professional harpsichordist, organist and co-director of several ensembles specializing in Bach's music, and have worked with many of the people on these recordings. I have also written a major biography of one of the members of the generation before Leonhardt & Harnoncourt, the Viennese harpsichordist Isolde Ahlgrimm), I can only reiterate even more strongly what I wrote five years ago and urge lovers of Bach to acquire this set immediately. Here is my original review:<br /><br />Had this set not been made, then the history of performance practice in the last quarter of the 20th century and beyond would have proceeded very differently. Had this set not been made we would not have many of the current leading figures in the field of early music performance, nearly all of whom were in some way connected with the performance revolution which found its most profound expression in these recordings. For it was during the 14 or so years of this recording project (between 1971 and 1985) that three of the greatest musicians of our time, Gustav Leonhardt, Nikolaus Harnoncourt and Frans Bruggen forever altered the public's perception of the surviving remnants of Bach's fabled, but rarely heard, \\"Jahrgaenge\\", or yearly cycles of church cantatas. For this reason alone, this recording is of profound importance.<br />Leonhardt, with his consort in Amsterdam, and Harnoncourt, with his Concentus Musicus of Vienna shared the task of recording, with an unmatched team of vocal and instrumental soloists, Bach's roughly 200 surviving \\"concerti sacri\\", perhaps a further hundred being lost to us. It was a repertoire more honoured in the history books than experienced in performance. This enterprise changed that state of affairs for ever.<br /><br />The arguments which are now sometimes made (chiefly by those who are unaware of the extraordinary and revolutionary step which these performances represented), decrying the slightly \\"raw\\" (I prefer \\"vocal\\") sound of original instruments, or the occasional shakiness of a boy soprano soloist, miss the point of this enterprise, which was to present the music in a new way using Bach's own contemporary resources. Leonhardt and Harnoncourt are the first to insist that using \\"historical instruments\\" makes sense because those are simply the best tools for the job. Re-constituting something old has never been their aim. Rather, their idea was to break free of the mindless tradition of performance which took no account of the sounds that Bach actually had in his head when he created his \\"well-regulated\\" music for the churches of Saxony. And how does this work in practice? We are left to marvel at an extraordinary level of accomplishment on the part of nearly everyone associated with this project, vocally and instrumentally.<br /><br />Gustav Leonhardt was well aware (and hopeful) that subsequent generations would likely improve upon aspects of performance which still remained to be sorted out. But, as he said, it was a start. Indeed, when he and Harnoncourt were jointly awarded the Erasmus prize in the Netherlands in 1980, he remarked, with singular modesty and self-awareness: \\"It was not done well, but it is remarkable that it was done atall\\". This tells us more about Leonhardt's famous humility, than it does about the standards of these performances, which are usually (with few exceptions) very high indeed. In many instances they will never be surpassed. What we have here is a glimpse of one of music's \\"golden\\" ages captured forever on disc. What the listener will marvel at is the extraordinary assuredness of technique and style which is evident in every one of these cantata performances.<br /><br />The solo vocal contributions of Kurt Equiluz, Max van Egmond, Paul Esswood, Marjanne Kweksilber (BWV 51) are simply without equal, and the current generation of fine Bach singers would be the first to concede their enormous debt to the participants in this great enterprise (their teachers, in many cases). The choirs should also be singled out for attention: Wiener Sangerknaben, Tolzer Knabenchor, Hannover Knabenchor, Choir of Kings College, Cambridge as well as directors Heinz Hennig, Gerhard Schmidt-Gaden, Philippe Herreweghe, David Willcocks and Hans Gillesberger. So Europe's finest were all involved in this.<br /><br />The instrumental soloists: Frans Bruggen, Walter van Hauwe, Kees Boeke, Anner Bylsma, Jurg Schaftlein, Lucy van Dael, Sigiswald, Wieland and Bart Kuijken, Ton Koopman, Bob van Asperen, Lidewij Schiefes, Alice Harnoncourt, Herbert and Herwig Tachezi, Erich Hobarth, Friedemann Immer - to list only the more familiar names - have created a whole world of intelligent and vital performance which has transformed musical thought in our time. No-one in any area of musical performance has remained untouched by the ideas which are so forcefully presented here (even those who'd be the last to admit it). The fundamental idea of treating each period's music as a vital and representative product of its time is one which now extends to music of all periods, signaling the fulfilment of one of Leonhardt's and Harnoncourt's chief aims: to eliminate the artificial distinction between mainstream and \\"early\\" music, and, instead, to treat all music with proper respect for its origins and context.<br /><br />What this recording continues to offer the listener is the experience of hearing the music for the first time, which the technical polish of subsequent surveys cannot quite match. For the young person wishing to learn about music, there is no better starting point than investing in this set, now available at a fraction of its original cost (unfortunately, minus the scores, which were one of the hallmarks of this series in its first incarnation on LP.<br /><br />It seems pointless to list highlights, but one might start with the following: BWV 1, 6, 8, 11, 13, 19, 23, 29 and so on. The list is endless. Better still, buy the set and begin a life-time's voyage of discovery instead. Bach, Leonhardt and Harnoncourt: you can't do better than that. Oh, and we should also acknowledge the contribution of the founder recording producer for this project, Wolf Erichson (even though he didn't stay with Teldec to the end of it). Without him, the revolution in informed and intelligent music performance on recordings would never have happened.<br /><br />2008: At its new price and in its new format, this set is now within reach of everyone who loves Bach's music, eloquently performed by the greatest specialist musicians of our time.

No-one in any area of musical performance has remained untouched by the ideas which are so forcefully presented here (even those who'd be the last to admit it). The fundamental idea of treating each period's music as a vital and representative product of its time is one which now extends to music of all periods, signaling the fulfilment of one of Leonhardt's and Harnoncourt's chief aims: to eliminate the artificial distinction between mainstream and \\"early\\" music, and, instead, to treat all music with proper respect for its origins and context.<br /><br />What this recording continues to offer the listener is the experience of hearing the music for the first time, which the technical polish of subsequent surveys cannot quite match. For the young person wishing to learn about music, there is no better starting point than investing in this set, now available at a fraction of its original cost (unfortunately, minus the scores, which were one of the hallmarks of this series in its first incarnation on LP.<br /><br />It seems pointless to list highlights, but one might start with the following: BWV 1, 6, 8, 11, 13, 19, 23, 29 and so on. The list is endless. Better still, buy the set and begin a life-time's voyage of discovery instead. Bach, Leonhardt and Harnoncourt: you can't do better than that. Oh, and we should also acknowledge the contribution of the founder recording producer for this project, Wolf Erichson (even though he didn't stay with Teldec to the end of it). Without him, the revolution in informed and intelligent music performance on recordings would never have happened.<br /><br />2008: At its new price and in its new format, this set is now within reach of everyone who loves Bach's music, eloquently performed by the greatest specialist musicians of our time. One of the pinnacles of recording.<br /><br />Peter Watchorn (2008 & 2003)
0618918248|5.0|There have only been 719 reviews to date, so far so I thought it needed another. This title, now available in paperback has some comments on criticisms of the hardback edition in a new introduction and amazon are currently offering it at half price.    Why has this book been so controversial? Well Dawkins isn't a theologian (nor does he need to be, but more on that later) he is an evolutionary biologist and is famous from his books wherein he developed the pioneering gene's eye view of evolution (instead of the level of the individual animal) in books such as 'the selfish gene' and 'the extended phenotype'. It seems that being a symbol of modern neo-darwinian theory he found himself the target for the oddest attacks from creationists, people who said his field wasn't a field at all but an ungodly contradiction of the biblical story. In his biology books, Dawkins famously tosses in a few asides about how silly religious faith is and how so many of their holiest observances seem to be based on just so much made-up fairytale nonsense.    Finally it seems that being on the defensive against fundamentalists did not suit his nature and he published his first non-science book - 'The God Delusion'. Despite taking the offensive he keeps firm hold of his scientific methodology and establishes through reason and logic how pretty much everything in religion is wrong. How silly the arguments are for God, how we don't need it for ethics, How it doesn't even provide much comfort and so on.    None of Dawkin's arguments are particularly new and groundbreaking. What he achieves in this book is the rather less revolutionary though incredibly useful act of bringing all the arguments together. This is why I would call it an atheist's handbook. You can neatly look up an argument to trounce a theist and then follow it up with his excellent bibliography. Some of the criticism based on the hardback was due to the fact that Dawkins had no religious training, and he dispenses with this rather juvenile complaint in the introduction to the paperback.    If you're an atheist, you'll love it, if you're someone who just 'doesn't believe in god much' then it might expand your mind and you will probably put it down as an atheist. If you're religious? It will ask you hard questions which I hope anyone reading this will have the courage to do honestly to make them think about what they choose to accept as true.    So far, this is the most important book of the 21st century.
0439813786|5.0|Picked this up recently by chance. What a fantastic find! The pencil drawings are warm and provide a lovely touch to an otherwise entirely self-supporting story. Whenever we had to put it down, I don't know who was more disappointed (and excited to get back to it) - my daughters, ages 6 and 8, or me! A story well told in a package well executed.
B00177Y9ZC|3.0|Although I didn't care for this movie, my niece loved it and wanted it as a birthday gift. She likes Hayden Christensen and suspenseful movies, so this was a perfect selection for her. The movie had action and lots of teleportation, but highly believable, it is not.
0439023483|5.0|Seldom do you run across a book that gives you pause for thought.  What a story!  Society has taken a turn for the horrific!      Perfect for Grade 7 up to Adult! After Twilight, let the games begin!!!
015206396X|3.0|I wanted to love this book.  I had just finished the Twilight series and Hunger Games and I was looking for a similar title.  Graceling sounded so promising with the extraordinary female character and the the word \\"romance\\" had me interested as well.     (Spoiler alert)  I was never board reading Graceling, but I was also let down at times.  The romance just jumped in too quickly and lacked the anticipatory quality that makes books so much better than movies or tv. It seemed they went from friendship to lovers without any foreplay. The worst part was when the lovers are reunited, there was very little excitement or sexual tension.  It seemed as if they were no longer interested in each other.  Another dissappointment was the climax.  The actual scene for the climactic moment seemed over in a split second without any real danger for our lead character.  I actually stopped and turned back the pages because I thought I missed something.      Even though I had these disappointments, I would still recommend the book.  The series really has potential and I look forward to more about these characters.
B001AX9DT0|2.0|I greatly enjoy Ray's previous releases \\"Trouble\\" and \\"Till The Sun Turns Black.\\"  Sorry, but I can't say the same about \\"Gossip In The Grain.\\"  While his voice is just fantastic, the songs are not.  \\"Meg White\\" and \\"Hey Me, Hey Mama\\" are the worst of the bunch and are two of the worst songs I have heard in quite some time.  The others are OK - - but nothing special.  It's all rather dull.
B00000K31V|5.0|[[[ASIN:B00004Z1GH Existenz [IMPORT]]]Forget \\"The Matrix\\". Now, really forget it. It's a different movie. \\"eXistenZ\\" lives in a world, or really nested realities, all its own. Cronenberg is a master of mixing up reality with non-reality and physical with non-physical. I think one of the beauties of \\"eXistenZ\\" is the ugliness of the Virtual Reality world created by Geller's (Jennifer Jason-Leigh) half-mutant amphibian/half plastic game pod. The icky porting into it with an umbilical cord into the spinal column is so Cronenberg. I liked the way he had the characters (and us) believing they were out of the game when they were still in it... those pesky nested realities. It does harken back to some of Philip K. Dick's visionary short stories, as well as Cronenberg's own \\"Videodrome\\" (especially with the \\"Death to...\\" sequence). I also liked the use of some of Canada's best actors who have since become more well known, such as Don McKellar, Callum Keith Rennie (by way of Sutherland, England), and Sarah Polley.  In fact, Cronenberg played a character in Don McKellar's 2000 film, \\"Last Night\\", which also starred McKellar, Rennie, and Polley, not to mention Sandra Oh. I liked the way some of the characters in the Virtual Reality did not respond unless they were fed the correct line. That was brilliant, and I have not seen that done anywhere before or since. I also liked the gun made out of a jawbone that fired teeth for bullets. Cronenberg is brilliant. Take a pop over the Amazon's sister site, IMDb.com, and look at Cronenberg's filmography. There isn't a bad apple in the bunch, and you would do well to watch them all. \\"Naked Lunch\\" and \\"Dead Ringers\\" are just two out of many that would stand out if you liked \\"eXistenZ\\".
0061438294|4.0|Without reading people's bodies, you're only hearing half of what they're saying.  This book more than describes specifics, it describes themes, for example distancing and blocking.  That allows the reader to interpret motions not covered explicitly in the book.  The book is also very careful to explain that all body language needs to be viewed in context.  Thus it is not so much motions one makes, but changes in motions, or motions that conflict with other motions or words, that indicate something to further study. Similarly the author points out that there is NO foolproof way to tell when someone is lying.  Although it would appear that there are times when you can detect that someone is being honest, the absense of that does not mean one is being dishonest.<br /><br />The biggest challenge is in developing the habit to actively observe others while engaged in conversation with them.  I find I am usually focused on understanding what they are saying (verbally), integrating that with my knowledge/frame of reference, and figuring out what I'm going to say next.

1932100660|5.0|This book is critical for anyone studying nutrition. Why China? Because of \\"such a massive variation in cancer rates among different counties when genetic backgrounds were similar from place to place\\" (p. 71). Quite simply, it leaves no doubt that genetics aren't involved, but rather environment.<br /><br />Though I have read hundreds of books on nutrition, I was blown away by the research herein. I had already known dairy was bad, but Campbell's research makes it practically the major culprit for cancer! Apparently the casein, the main protein in cow's milk, \\"interacts with carcinogens, the way DNA reacts with carcinogens and the way cancerous cells grow\\" (p. 65) and actually \\"allows more carcinogens into cells\\" (p. 348). Milk does a tumor good! Although I still occasionally indulge in raw goat's cheese, I am much more conscious of this fact after reading his book.<br /><br />While other researchers have implicated carbohydrates in cancer (especially high glycemic ones), Dr. Campbell devotes an entire chapter to blaming a diet too high in protein.  He found that a diet 5% in protein could reverse cancer, and implicated a diet high in animal proteins as being especially carcinogenic. He recommends getting no more than 10% of your calories in protein, which is low by USA standards.<br />A vegetarian diet was found to be superior in forming muscle over the long run (\\"slow and steady wins the race\\") as well as in allowing people to consume many more calories than omnivores, without getting fat.<br /><br />Campbell also takes on big pharma and the food industries, leaving no doubt that their recommendations to us are purely for their profit.<br />My editor e-mailed Dr. Campbell to inquire as to whether any of the animal proteins eaten in the study were raw. Apparently not, he replied. It might have made a difference in the meat (since cooked meat forms carcinogenic heterocyclic amines if heated enough), but honestly: even raw dairy contains casein!
0307455874|5.0|I did read the book,and recommend it highly.  One of the post-election-day negative reviewers brags about not reading it and several others seem to say if it has anything to do with Barack Obama they hate it.    It's hard to see how a fair-minded person could read this book and be virulently opposed.  Maybe suggestions of being naive or not likely to deliver on ideas could be defended, although they're not very helpful.    I'm troubled that Amazon's reader reviews seem to be so easily used to spew latent (or not-so-latent) racist garbage.
B001JOIEZ4|1.0|The only artists I've heard of before previewing this are Collective Soul and Linkin Park. Both of which I've heard better songs from. I agree with what these other people said about hoping its just in the background for the movie. I realise that the storyline is very different, but I thought the Queen Of The Damned soundtrack was WAY better, same with the Underworld movies. This is weak. I'm wondering why they didn't use the song Twilight, would have made perfect sense. I'm just glad I listened to it before buying it.
B001GKJ2E8|1.0|No real plot, James McAvoy does not fill the bill, just another Hollywood shoot and ask questions later movie. Waste of money.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|I love this show, its the best on TV. This show hooks you from the begininng and pulls you in you want to know what happens next. I ended up watching this entire season in two days. A must for all you sci-fi buffs. My favorite episode in this season is \\"I Do\\".    One of the things LOST introduced me to was the Twilight Zone which J.J. Abrams was inspired. Besides this box set of season 3 of lost, I recommend a book also on Amazon.com. THE TWILIGHT ZONE: Unlocking the Door to a Television Classic by Martin Grams. Together, they both open the skies for cult television.    Your just gonna have to purchase all seasons, I don't want to give anything alway and the show.
B000L3CHC0|5.0|I bought the Tissot Chrono for my boyfriend last year.  I was having a tough time deciding between the 3 colors.   The white version looked great at first, but the hour/second hand  needed some color for contrast - it looked washed out.   The blue face was okay but I really liked the yellow accent   on the black version.  It looks sporty + classy.  I got a second opinion from his good friend and he agreed with the choice.    It's very versatile.  He wears it to work and also wears it on the weekends.  No scratches on the face - so much better than the ESQ watch I  previously bought him ... but he did get scuff marks on the bracelet.    Nevertheless, he LOVES it.  3 links were removed for a comfortable fit.  He likes to wear it a tad loose compared to others that may like it   tight on the wrist.  It's a personal preference/choice.    He takes off an extra link during the cooler months  because the watch will fit looser due to the temperature change.  I don't know exactly what his wrist size is but  if it helps - he's 6 ft tall and 190 lbs.    Great quality watch at a nice price.  Don't hestitate on this one.

B0000074GK|5.0|I've been listening to these guys right from the start and they never fail dissapoint either in the studio or live. This is pure British rock at it's best. The power of Danny Bowes vocals on tracks like \\"dont wait for me\\" will never fail to impress. An incredible debut album that is a must for any respectable CD collection. This album really does stand the test of time even after 18 years.

B00123JS8O|5.0|I give five stars to For Free (a real gem) and Woodstock.  (I did not download any other songs from Ladies.) I am not a fan of Big Yellow Taxi, I heard it too many times on the radio way back when.  This version of Woodstock is much more thoughtful and dark than the CSNY version -- it is not an anthem here, but an observation, an insight, a hope.    I also like the Miles of Aisles versions of both songs, but these studio versions are the best.  (Her nervous giggle in For Free/Aisles is cute but detracts from the song, which is not at all giggly.)  The Byrds version of For Free is good, but the harmonies are a little heavy for the concept of the song (but they are beautiful harmonies).    For Free and Woodstock would be great poems without any music, without her voice. She is an amazing artist.  Don't miss Court and Spark, which for me is her masterpiece.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I don't remember when they first started calling Good Friday, \\"Good Friday,\\" or why.  The Pharisees, okay, for THEM it was a good Friday, an excellent Friday, one of their favourites; but for Jesus it was not really such a good Friday, and if you have seen Mel Gibson's 5-star movie, The PASSION OF THE CHRIST, you will know exactly what I'm talking about.     (If you have not yet seen the film, but have only heard the word, \\"passion,\\" then you may suspect that \\"the Passion\\" of Christ had something to do with tender feelings for Mary Magdalene, which would be a mistake:  \\"passion\\"  is a word that used to mean \\"suffering,\\" as in the sense, \\"I have no control over what that Roman centurion [or that foxy lady] does to me.\\"  The second kind of passion is something that Jesus never experienced all that much.)    On 30 March, 31 CE, all Jerusalem turned out to watch Christ's Passion - all but the Twelve disciples, eleven of whom (until the dust settled) were lying low in Bethany, at Mary's Place (which was the only house around that had both a Jesus-friendly owner and plenty of beds); and the twelfth of whom (Judas Iscariot) was out shopping for real estate.  The Eleven good disciples had been up late the night before.  On Friday morning they were pretty tired, and somewhat drained emotionally, so they slept in (Matt. 26:56).  The apostle John finally showed up, at two o'clock, but he arrived too late to carry the cross, so the soldiers made this fellow, Simon of Cyrene, a Libyan tourist, carry it instead.    Mel Gibson's film is accurate for the most part, except that the Jews get blamed for the whole fiasco; when in point of fact, the event went down pretty much as your heavenly Father planned.  The sado-masochistic violence, okay, some people don't know when to quit, and Mel Gibson is one of them.  Also, the Roman soldiers--like in that scene where they smashed the guy's legs as he hung on the cross next to Jesus.  For some Roman soldiers, that was their favourite part of a crucifixion, when they took turns smashing the victim's shins and knees with a wooden bat, to finish him off.  If those men had been born a thousand years earlier, and Jewish, they could have been Old Testament heroes.  Seriously: these Roman soldiers were not just tough on crime:  these guys were LAPD material.)    But as I was saying, God the Father planned the event, including the 3-hour solar blackout (which gets short shrift in Gibson's film), and the earthquake.  Caiaphas, Chief Priest of the Jews, was actually pretty annoyed with Yahveh for sending the solar eclipse, because it seemed to him like Yahweh was taking sides.  \\"First the healed ear of Malchus,\\" said Caiaphas, \\"and now this!\\"  But it wasn't like the Chief Priest could change his mind.  It wasn't like he could say, \\"Whoops, sorry Jesus, we Jewish leaders and priests of Yahweh made a mistake!  Let's get you down from up there.\\"  He couldn't do that because, for one thing, it was way too dark.    When the sun got switched back on again at 3:00 p.m., Caiaphas just shrugged his shoulders as if there were no connection between Golgotha and the solar event.  So God gave him another hint.  At 3:01, just as folks were getting off work, a shaker hit, a violent earthquake, about 7.2 on the Richter scale: \\"The ground shook, and the rocks split, and the curtain of the Temple was torn in two.\\" Walls tumbled, roofs collapsed.  Stone tombs all over the holy land snapped open like walnuts (Matt. 28:45-52).    That earthquake sent a powerful message to Caiaphas.  Many favourite dishes and clay pots at the Chief Priest's mansion were destroyed; plus, a section of roof over the rear portico collapsed, and fell into the wading pool, and damaged a lovely tile-mosaic of Aphrodite on the half shell.    Unfortunately, the earthquake also sent a powerful message to Jesus.  It cannot feel good to be jiggled when you are being crucified.  But this was no jiggle.  Eyewitnesses said that the earthquake rocked Jesus' cross like a sailboat-mast in a high wind.  Then it waved the cross about like a kid with a burning brand.  Worst of all, I think, was when the earthquake pounded that cross up and down like a jackhammer (Matt. 27:54).    Jesus always knew that the Crucifixion would be no picnic.  He knew it would be violent.  In his divine foreknowledge, he probably even knew that someone, someday, would make a graphic, sadistic movie about his suffering, to entertain a decadent Western society.  But I think he also thought, at this particular moment, that a teeth-rattling, jaw-banging earthquake was a little much, a little over the top.  \\"My God!  My God!\\" he said, \\"Why have You forsaken me?\\" Well, he probably didn't mean to say it aloud, but it just slipped out (Matt. 27:46).    Jesus, to this very day, may harbor some feelings about that Good Friday Earthquake.  Couldn't his heavenly Father have waited until they took him down first?  Did Yahveh have no clue how that would feel, when His only begotten Son was bouncing up and down like that?  Really, it was uncalled for.  And I do think that God the Father owes Jesus an apology.    Unfortunately, Yahveh's vocabulary has never included the phrase, \\"I'm sorry.\\"     - L.
B00005JKNF|5.0|The story opens in 1932, at the country estate of Lord and Lady McCordle; guests arriving for the weekend include friends and relatives and even a Hollywood movie producer. Of course, they all bring their servants who bustle around downstairs to make life grand for their betters upstairs. When someone is found dead - and it appears he was murdered twice - everyone seems to have a motive.<br /><br />The ensemble cast includes just about every famous British actor of the day and is led by Maggie Smith who steals the show with her funny/snobby countess role, Helen Mirren who is tragically efficient as the housekeeper, Kristen Scott Thomas as the self-absorbed lady of the manor, and Kelly Macdonald who plays a wonderfully meek ladies' maid. Each of the wealthy guests is incredibly spoiled and oblivious to the world downstairs, where the servants have their own hierarchy and drama. Everyone has a secret and they all unfold much to our delight.<br /><br />Director Robert Altman's style of overlapping dialogue can be frustrating; at first it was hard to understand what was being said because everyone talks at the same time or mumbles and sutitles are a must, but it's still fun to soak up the atmosphere of the filthy rich who find everything just too, too boring. This movie is part comedy, part drama, dripping with period authenticity. It was nominated for seven Oscars and won for Best Screenplay. Lots of fun Extras on the DVD.

B0018AK9RA|4.0|Reviews have been very divided on the release of Priest's newest album,there first concept release,Nostradumus.  Many criticize it for it's lack of anthems and accesibility.  Truth is,it's just what it SHOULD be....a deep concept album.  The band returns somewhat to there 70s roots with this one,with much more complex guitar work and the use of keyboards to maximize the emotional impact of several songs.  It's a good story,but quite a long listen,sort of a throw back to the classic idea of the concept record.  Not all the writing is top notch,but when it works,it works well.  Standouts are probally War,Prophecy and Future of Mankind(excellent soloing in this one).  The song \\"Alone\\" was Priest's clever way of adding an anthem to metalheads,for clearly the lyrics echo that sentiment.  Overall,a good release,ceratinly a must for Priest fans,and good enough to be an album of the year contender.  Go in with an open mind,and you may enjoy the journey that lies ahead on \\"Nostradamus\\".
B00005JPMZ|3.0|I was a huge Ninja Turtles fan back in the late 80s/early 90s, so it's very cool to see the TMNT pick up in popularity again and return to the big screen. This movie however, isn't what it could've been.<br /><br />What works: The visuals of the Turtles are spot-on, and in computer-generated form they're more athletic and acrobatic than ever. There's one particular showcase fight sequence in the rain that is gorgeous. The film also nails the family dynamic between the Turtles and Splinter, from friendships and brotherly rivalry to the father-son dynamics. It's a deeper approach than the animated TMNT shows have taken, and it works.<br /><br />What doesn't work: The plot of the movie, involving an immortal conqueror and 13 monsters, comes off as a bunch of sci-fi nonsense. The story clashes with the grittier, grounded tone the rest of the film wants to take, and it's disappointment for anyone looking for some classic TMNT/Foot Clan action (the Foot Clan sans Shredder does appear, but only in a supporting role). The narrative isn't particularly well told either, and there are certain obvious gaffs such as when April repeats the entire history already explained in the opening narrative. Other bits and pieces seem to have been cut for time, and Mikey and Don get somewhat shortchanged in the screen time department. Finally, the designs for April, Casey, and the rest of the human cast don't hold up to other modern computer animation - they animate stiffly and lack originality.<br /><br />This animated movie is better than the 2nd and 3rd live-action films, but is still a distant second to the original 1990 film that represents the TMNT at their best. Longtime fans will probably want to own this and the curious should give it a rental, but there's not much here to draw general interest.
B0000071GA|5.0|Most metalheads regard this band of Swedes as just a silly Hard Rock band,kind of an AC/DC rip off.  Well,lo and behold they produce a gem!  \\"Headhunter\\" is the first(and last) time in the 80s that the band really comes together,combining there influences of AC/DC,Arena Rock and speed metal to create one of the early 80s funnest headbangs.  Loaded with most of the band's greatest songs including metal fistpumpers,\\"Eat the Rich\\" and the title track.  There cover of BTO's \\"Stayed Awake all Night\\" is excellent and this also features what is largely regarded as there best track,the classic,\\"Screaming in the Night\\".  If your a fan of Arena Metal and like the sound of classic PURE heavy metal,and don't care to think too hard about it,go with this classic.  It's a lot of fun for a rocker.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|The bottom line is...if this movie doesn't make you smile then you have bigger problems than Pierce Brosnan's voice or \\"questionable cinematography\\"....watch it while you're home alone if you need to, but I DARE you not to smile!!! :-)
B000VUQ4HW|5.0|Kino entertainment releases the frequently issued DVD of the German silent vampire classic,Nosferatu(1922) in a beautiful two disc special edition,worthy of the film's classic status.  The print has been cleaned up to almost pristine quality,better than there previous release of 2002,and the original score for the film is available fnally.  The score adds immeasurably to the film,creating the atmosphere and emotion and epic scale that few of the earlier releases could come close to.  The second disc features lots of extras including a filmography of the film's director,F.W Murnau, an excellent documentary on him and stills from the film.  If your a fan of cinema,and especially,a student of the horror genre,than you should already own this masterpiece.  Time for an upgrade?  YEAH.  Get this DVD....now.  Note:Keep the main menu on and watch Nosferatu's face.  It's kind of creepy.
B000IY06CK|5.0|Julia Fischer's performance of the Tchaikovsky Concerto is technically assured. More importantly, her technique is placed in service to the music. This is the most musical performance of the concerto that I know. The youthful Fischer (23 at the time of the recording) is beautifully supported by Maestro Kreizberg and sensitive playing by the Russian National Orchestra. The wind playing in particular is extremely sensitive and beautiful in tone.    One thing that sets this recording apart is Miss Fischer's playing of the solo part as written. Violinists of an earlier generation, including Milstein, Stern, Oistrakh, et. al, employed a revised version of the soloist part that eliminated a chunk of the first movement development and several (admittedly repetitive) passages in the finale. Furthermore octave shifts and elimination of double stops further simplified the part. In this recording, all the cuts are opened and the difficulties restored and played with aplomb.     Frankly, I had avoided this recording. With Milstein and Oistrakh already on the shelves, there didn't seem much point to acquiring a new and expensive version of a work that has never been my favorite. Well, I was wrong. This recording has forced me to re-evaluate my feelings about the concerto as music, not just a technical tour de force.    The Serenade and Valse are well played by the soloist and orchestra and Maestro Kreizberg proves his versatility by providing solid piano accompaniment for the Souvenir. The concerto is the real prize.    The recording is demonstration quality, but you will only get the full impact in the multi-channel SACD format. The standard CD mix is good but doesn't do justice to the soloist, who sounds recessed. The 2 channel SACD mix improves things somewhat, but the 5 channel version is startlingly lifelike and well balanced.    If you have multi-channel SACD capability, buy yourself a copy of this disc. You'll enjoy it for both musical and technical excellence.
0756404746|4.0|I really liked this book!! Most of the book was presented as a flashback, with interludes in the \\"present.\\" I found that Kvothe was very arrogant, but that that arrogance got him into and out of troubles beyond the imagination of a more humble person. That arrogance in the main narrative and the contrasting humility that Kvothe displays in the \\"present\\" adds a forboding shadow to the book.<br />My main gripe with the book was that you could see him walk into bad situations and make poor choices. If you get money from a notorious loan shark, you pay her back first! You may be distilled awesome, but a little humility in front of the local nobility won't hurt you. I suppose that is supposed to drive the conflict, but I have troubles with it.<br />I would recommend and have recommended this book to anyone into the fantasy genre.
B00005R8FI|5.0|good to hear again after all these years. the quality is great and the songs still sound as good as they did on first hearing.
1400064287|4.0|The authors try to identify what makes an idea \\"stick\\" and the learnings can be applied to most types of communication.     As a marketer, I didn't learn anything revolutionary new but it reminds you of what is important and I really like the checklist they came up with:    1. Simple  2. Unexpected  3. Concrete  4. Credible  5. Emotional  6. Story    The checklist comes to life by numerous examples in each category. For example, in the presidental campaign Ronald Reagan, instead of rambling of some economic stats, simply said: \\"ask yourself if you are better off today than 4 years ago\\". They recite a classic urban legend of the businessman who gets drugged and gets his kidney removed. They analyze this urban legend and it turns out it has all the ingredients that make something \\"stick\\".      The challenge in writing a book about sticky ideas is that it sets the readers' expectations very high about the book itself being written in a sticky way. In this respect, I think the authors are doing an OK job, but not great. At times, the book gets a bit slow (non-sticky!), but I would still recommend this book not only to marketers, but to anybody for whom communication is an important aspect of their work.
B000A6T1KE|1.0|I am revisiting my original review. This is a bad movie and it seems to repeat a lot of overused themes in Star Trek. What is really crazy to me is how you can forget your own continuity and history. You have done a story in the original Next Generation series about how they found an abandoned Android body and restored. I don't get how you have a movie that takes place in a universe that is a few years removed from a devastating war that the Enterprise was somehow isolated from. Please run from this movie. I am grateful for it though. If it had not been for this movie we would not have gotten the &#34;new&#34; Star Trek.
B001F12J3Y|1.0|I love this movie but the 3D is horrible.  I could never get it to look right, no matter how much I fiddled around with the provided glasses.  Very disappointing.
B001ED7C58|4.0|I thought this was a pretty good soundtrack.  There were so good songs.  We will have to see how it will tie into the movie when I actually see it.  Other that that, it is something that I can listen to.
0375842209|5.0|I lived in Germany in the early 80s.  I loved it there, loved the people, loved the country, even loved the order.  The older people I knew there were, of course, anti-Hitler and assured me that all the Nazis had died in the war because they wanted to.  Mostly it was a topic avoided.  But this book actually talks about the simple heroes of such a time, the normal people who might otherwise be apolitical but were thrust into an environment where the political is essential and each action must be weighed with its impact on one's ability to survive.  The story is stirring and moving, and one that you hate to see end.  Though it is classified as a young adult book I have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone of any age.
B0019CSXAM|5.0|Fantastic dvd set, all the episodes from season 3 with good quality sound and video. Extras are great!
0375826726|5.0|I purchased this for my 10 year old son.  He has read the other books by this author so was very happy to get the new book.  He finished it in 5 days - and he was at school during the day! He loved it and is looking forward to the next book.
B0013FFMOK|5.0|I ordered the movie as a Christmas present, and it came very quickly. There was no delay, and the seller kept in touch until the product was delivered. We have not watched the movie yet as it is for Christmas, but I have not doubt of the quality given the service thus far.
0743298039|4.0|This was our first book club selection and all in all I really liked it.  It kept you interested throughout.  I understand the issues some people had with the ending - it got a little complicated and a little implausable.  But it was good.
0312360266|5.0|I found this story line to be very origional, unlike anything I've ever read. I would recommend this for teens, probably 14 and older.<br /><br />The book is written from a teen's perspective, which is refreshing. That means that there are quite a few curse words and seual comments... let's just leave it at that.<br /><br />It always keeps you on the edge of your seat, even in the pretty uneventful parts. I know that a book is really good when I find myself reading it and laughing out loud.<br /><br />As I said, it is a very \\"teen\\" book. So if you're not a teen, someone may have to explain to you what some of the, uh..., references in the book mean.<br /><br />But overall, I found this book to be absolutely AMAZING. My friend ordered Marked, not knowing if it would be all that good, and before I was even half way through the book, I was online ordering Betrayed, Chosen, and Untamed. I would recommend these books to just about anybody. It's a new twist on an old tale.
630460291X|2.0|I love this movie.  I owned it on VHS and was looking to upgrade, so I bought this DVD.  It's a 2 sided disc so you have to turn the disc over half way through the movie just to watch the rest.  Lame.  I was also a bit disappointed that the video by Bryan Adams wasn't at the end with the credits like it was on the VHS.  It was also at the end of the movie in the movie theatre too, so I'm not sure why they would exclude it on the DVD.  I love this movie and hate to give it any thing less than a 4, but because of the DVD format, I'm giving it a 2.
1416914285|5.0|As previous reviewers have stated, there are quite a few similarities between this book and many others. However, I found myself forgetting about that as I read the book. I loved that it was witty, and that Jace (one of the main characters) was such a smartass, who kills demons, none the less. Guys in books don't get much better than that. But that's beside the point.<br /><br />Before I actually read the book, I made the mistake of reading a City of Ashes review that ruined the big plot twist at the end of the book for me. Knowing that still didn't deter me from reading the book, although at times I was kind of grossed out.<br /><br />All in all, I'm glad I purchased this book, contrary to the negative reviews.
B000A6T1JU|5.0|My husband had talked about this movie for years with a quote \\"Warriors... come out and play yaaaa\\".  Finally got it for him for his birthday this year.  He was thrilled as he had looked for it in local rental shops and department stores with no luck.    It is a somewhat dark movie about a gang with some great background 80's music.  Our 17 year old daughter walked through the room but got hooked and ended up watching the entire movie as well.  I'm sure it will be played again here.  Not, my cup of tea, but if you're into City Life, action packed movie, with a little romance tossed in, and some good music, you'll love this!  (I, on the other hand, was impressed with Amazon.  No hassle with purchase and it shipped super fast!)
B001ESYAJY|5.0|Quantum of Solace grows on you. It is a fairly good continuation of Where Casino Royale left off. This is Arnold's sound and interpretation of James Bond all the way.
B001CD6FKS|5.0|First of all, this is a fantastic transfer to Blu-ray.  The visual quality alone makes this film worth the money.  Jaw dropping lucious visuals!      The story, though perhaps flawed with being too long and too much of \\"Speed's annoying younger brother, actually rises to \\"greatness levels\\" periodically throughout.  Especially the last 20 minutes or so.  I've seen it three times and every time I see it I like it more.  The movie surprisingly has a lot of heart, and is even spiritually elevating...somewhat similarly to the ending of \\"The Matrix.\\"    The positives more than outweight the negatives.  Although probably more of a \\"guy film,\\" my wife and daughter both liked it a lot.
B000001F7R|3.0|When the NWOBH came to the United States everyone was excited. I mean, the NWOBH swept America with it's raw, unpolised, NWOBH sound. The NWOBH bands included Iron Maiden, Saxxon and Def Leppard. When you listen to NWOBH you can understand the new wave from Britain that changed the Heavy Metal Scene. With Def Leppard, and the unique metal-ness they bring to NWOBH, it's definitely British and Heavy, possibly new. If you're a huge of NWOBH, or just new to the whole NWOBH scene, then you should definitely pick this up. It's a perfect example of the new metal that was from Britain in the new wave era. NWBOH forever!!!
B000SEVVLK|1.0|It just never happened. I loved DWP so this was a major disappointment. The characters were shallow, annoying, and completely predictable. I don't recommend and will not rush to purchase any future titles by this author.
0061122416|5.0|Anyone unsure of what they want to do after high school should read this book.
0743267478|5.0|I am, and have been, partial to books that concern  themselves with the Indian dispora and/or take place on the Indian sub-continent. Well, Q & A is simply put a book, like the recent The White Tiger  that uses the unique and complex Indian culure as its backdrop for a most involving and wonderful story that totally envelops you in its intricacy and irony and while it requires the reader to somewhat suspend reality it is just a great read and I can't wait to see the film that opens in the next week or so (Slumdog Billionaire)
0307269752|5.0|Having read rave reviews about Steig Larsson's debut novel, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, I had high expectations. At the same time, I was a bit wary with the knowledge that most hyped books end up to be disappointing reads because my expectations are initially so high. So I approached the book with some trepidation and was surprised to discover that none was necessary; The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo really was an amazing read that blew any expectations I may have had out of the water.    In some ways, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo really reminded me of Tana French's novel The Likeness. The subject matters weren't similar by any means, but they both had an exceptionally literary quality that is difficult to find in mysteries. Any fan of Tana French would most likely enjoy this novel, as they are both exceptional mysteries.    I had trouble putting Larsson's novel down. From the prologue itself, I was completely gripped by this powerful novel. I felt like I had to know what happened, and was completely satisfied with the conclusion. Though all threads weren't resolved, I felt like my curiosity had been sated. The characters were also very well written and personable. All in all, it really was an impressively well-written novel    I was surprised when I discovered that the author of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Stieg Larsson, passed away in 2004 from a heart attack. However, he left three unpublished manuscripts behind, the first of which was The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. These three novels were written as the \\"Millennium Trilogy.\\" The second book, called The Girl Who Played With Fire, is set to be released in the US on January 8, 2009 - a book I will most definitely be reading.
B00005JPO1|5.0|If you are a fan of Indiana Jones adventures, you should get this movie.It will have you on edge from start to end like the older movies. I like the connection it makes with plots from the older movies.
B000TLTUL0|5.0|A wonderful dark comedy with an amazing musical score and stellar performances by Johnny Depp, Alan Rickman and most of all the talented Helena Bonham Carter who assumes the role of Mrs. Lovett with the ease of slipping into a pair of slacks.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I like the CD, it has a nice mix of new artists and varying styles that's making the anticipation of the movie even better. I agree with some other reviewers that at first I was a little disappointed in Bella's Lullaby.  Since Edward is an impressive piano player I expected a more complex piece, something that required more than two fingers to play (piano portion when the piece first starts). But I expect the piece will fit in well with the movie and look forward to that. But the more I hear the lullaby it improves. The rest of the CD I already love and the more I appreciate the new songs that I haven't already heard 6,000 times before. I expect I'll like the mix even better after seeing the movie and I look forward to recognizing the songs on Nov. 21st!
B000BYA5GO|5.0|Loved the movie so much I paid full price on Amazon. I love this movie for it's realistic and believable look at the irony of weapons dealing. It also points out the hypocrisy of certain democratic African countries. Also showed the hypocrisy of the USA that looks down on those countries. Also shows us there good people can do evil things when they have to.
031606792X|2.0|I loved Twilight! I thought the middle books were ok. This last book made me crazy! I know this is ridiculous but I was actually mad half way into this book!    First, I don't know if I am the first to say this or not but, after book 2 I didn't feel there was any substance to Edward and Bella. He thinks she's beautiful, she can't believe he wants her, and so on. They mostly disagreed and had awkward moments. Jacob and Bella were truly friends, they had honest exchanges. Maybe I am a cynic but the \\"true love, soulmate\\" thing didn't hold for me. I kinda hoped the 4th book would give Edward and Bella more substance because I was, of course, rooting for Edward. This last book did nothing of the sort!    I felt the pregnancy was a bad plot twist. I suppose in a way it made Bella less selfish but only slightly. The worst plot twist was Jacob imprinting on Renesmee. I was truly disgusted. I also felt it was a cheap way to let Bella off the hook. She really had no conflict in this book that she did in previous books. The imprinting allowed Bella to have quite literally everything without losing a thing. Well, I guess she lost her humanity.    After Bella becomes a vampire she becomes maybe slightly less whiny but she loses everything that was Bella. Too quickly she's an unrecognizable character. Instead of being unsure, whiny, self centered and self sacrificing, Bella becomes a perfect, surprisingly controlled, motherly vampire. WHAT?!?!?    Edward is like a wall flower. Jacob is suddenly over everything because he's imprinted on Bella's infant child. All too quickly, Edward even moves past that disgusting detail. Rosalie becomes even more creepy. Ugh, I just can't believe how disappointing this book was!!    Lastly, the writing... Lacking for lack of a better word. Lacking detail, lacking focus, lacking direction. It seemed scattered. The end was anti-climatic. Any build-up was wasted.     So there you have it. I will still be watching the Twilight movie when it comes outthis month and I hope they do a good job with it.
B00079FUI6|4.0|This is the season that started it all. You cannot truly appreciate the genius of this show unless you watch this season. It's key!!!
B000YCLRBA|4.0|One of my favorite operas. The sets were rather spartan, but the music is excellent. My major gripe is with the subtitles in the DVD (and the reason for my 4 star review) - they are very poor. I understand little Russian, and the subtitles appear once every few minutes. At least if they enclosed the libretto with the DVD I would have been able to follow the singing while listening/watching.
B001F0ORDU|5.0|I love this movie soooo much. I cried, and I laughed. I just had a really good time. I could watch this movie a hundred times. I love the characters even more. This is just simply pure fun, and a serious mood lifter. Thanks:-)
B001CLG6RC|4.0|Yes, indeed it has some boring moments. But the thing is: the first time I listned to Voygeur I almost threw it out the window (I still have some difficulties with Boom Boom!). I guess my point is: it will grow on you.  The art work is brilliant and the Bonus CD has one interesting thing: try to find out which song has the same chord scheme, time signature and tempo as Following the sun.    Best Enigma album: A posteriori  Album to buy if you're new to Enigma: The Cross of Changes
1401923119|5.0|The Biology of Belief reinforced my belief that drugs do nothing but cause problems for the body.  Bruce Lipton shows exactly what drugs do to the body which for myself was a vindication of what I believed for the last 20 years.  It also gives great hope for the power of belief in providing a means to listen to the body and act on what you feel when the body speaks.  It was very eye opening to find that beliefs are formed in new life before it comes into the world by the environment which it is exposed to.  The Biology of Belief shows a new direction that the medical profession can at last provide guidance to their patients instead of the old paradigm of surgery and drugs.  Thank you Bruce Lipton.
B000063DFQ|5.0|by all means ignore the clown who said \\"Kid Rock, Milli Vanilli, and Madonna have more talent than these losers\\". Wasn't Milli those guys that were caught lip synching? Hmmm...now there's a 'talent'. And Madonna? Please...that's girly music. Oh yeah, I think she needs one more dancer too!<br />Maiden is one of the all time great metal bands and this CD is a highlight.<br />Music for men...by men!! Just listen to the classic metal riffage going on in Where Eagles Dare. This CD belongs in any serious metal collection.<br />Anybody familiar with Maiden knows they have come up with some of metal's most classic riffs. Up The Irons baby!!!
B000ETDVYY|5.0|My thoughts on the movie that has not already been shared:    1) The original movie with the subtitles (Far East version)  was edited for Western distribution (aka Quentin Tarantino)  and all important Chinese character which gave the tie-in  for movie was re subtitle and really threw the meaning way off.    2) Also, for whatever reason the Western Distributor messed up and the  movie was not enter for the Oscars for Best Foreign film.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|Though is is not like the book; I found more enjoyable then the book. I love Jane Austen, but Persuasion was a bore, until the ending chapters. The movies that are close to the book are boring, this is enjoyable.   How she gets his letter is lame, and the kiss is horrid, I have to fast forward through it, they look so unpleasant.
0785125965|3.0|This trade paperback collects Marvel's 2007 five issue \\"World War Hulk\\" mini-series.  After a grueling stay on the alien planet Sakarr where he ascended from slave to king, Hulk returns to Earth with his allied Sakaar gladiators to punish the Illuminati of Reed Richards, Tony Stark, Doctor Strange and Black Bolt for blasting him into space.  Crazy with anger, Hulk orders the 24 hour evacuation of Manhattan while Earth's superheroes attempt to repel him.  While sometimes interesting, Pak's plot too often falls into a series of simple battles and features too much of the dull Sentry.  Big fans of the Hulk will like this but the $25 list price seems high.
0765342294|5.0|This is simply one of the best books you will ever read.  Five stars.
031606792X|4.0|Honestly, this is a very good book. All things considered. I have read all four books in a matter of a week, (being that I am deployed to Iraq and had never even heard of Twilight before a couple of weeks ago). I fell in love with Bella and Edward immediately as well as most of my coworkers here. If you read all the books in that time frame maybe people can understand what is really going on in the fourth book. I think some of the negative reviews that this book is getting is from people that have forgotten about the struggles, emotional and physical that the characters have already been through. It was a little preditcable, but there were still a LOT of things that were a surprise. And to the people that said Bella's power was stupid, I disagree, she can protect everyone, she is more powerful than we thought. About all the questions about her pregnancy and Jacob's imprinting, people it is a work of FICTION. Don't try to ruin it by asking dumb questions like \\"how does Edward have sperm?\\" Just take it for what it is a great story.
B00005JPO1|5.0|I don't care what the bad reviewers say i think this movie rocked! If your a die hard Indiana Jones fan like me this is a must buy!
0060007737|5.0|Overall a great marketing/branding book for anyone wanting to get an overview of how it all works. They use classic, well-known examples that many professors cite constantly. If you have a background in marketing, it is a great refresher to remind you of the stuff you learned. As with all books, take from it what you can, and always challenge everything you read. But I read all of Al Reis' stuff, I think he is great.

0307269752|2.0|I think that the overwhelmingly positive reader reviews simply reflect how deeply many of us hunger for something, anything that seeks to transcend the pop fiction genre of all the usual suspects.  This book does vary from, but imho, does not transcend the pop fiction genre.  And I am not reacting to the ghoulishness of some of it.  Just a boring, predictable, hard not to put down story.

B00005YU1O|5.0|Waking Life is a superb loopy deep-dive into a rotoscoped Linklater universe - talking heads made witty & visually interesting, sometimes beautiful, sometimes lurid, sometimes - oh, everything else you might imagine animation can do in the hands of the man who did \\"Slackers\\" -- existential, smart, provocative, fun, disturbing & sometimes blindingly articulate: seductive and right the whole way through.

B000W00Y0Y|5.0|This disk is finally a release of what must be one of the top Queen live shows. Just the four of them, at the top of their fame and strength. Together with the Queen on Fire, this is a must have for any fan.    Freddie's voice is strong, amazing, no shortcuts, no compromises. The band just clicks together. Some beautiful performances here.    The video is very good given the age of the material, too bad more footage was not preserved to re-cut the show. Audio is flawless.    Commentary is entertaining, although best watched as subtitles (available in several languages), since the music is very quiet between the comments which are rather sparse.    Great show, probably the best live concert disk in my collection.

B001E1GXPA|2.0|The reason I fell in love with Trivium was the straight up metal verses combined with melodic choruses and amazing guitar solos that we found on Ember to Inferno and perfected on Ascendancy. This style of metal, a genre i dub \\"chorus metal,\\" was the type that broke me into most of the music I listen to today. That being said, I was sorely disappointed with The Crusade, being another Metallica clone (and don't get me wrong, I love Metallica, but when so many bands try to be them, it bugs me out), and while their latest offering, Shogun, was an earnest attempt to climb back into the genre that I so love them for, Trivium just isn't back there yet. The title track was the only one I actually enjoyed. I think with their next album they might get back to the lofty status to which I held them a few years ago. Until then...

Alan Moore, I know, large grand sweeping claim coming, ranks up there with the best. Just because someone illustrates your words does not mean it is somehow beneath others. This is simply a classic piece of work that you need to read. Especially with the film coming out, and who knows how that will be, devour this book.

They're such a good band, and they have amazing stage presence and put on a great show, plus they had strippers onstage during Scream ;)  And the demos are great, especially demons, girl i know, until the end, and their timeless cover of the Pantera classic, Walk. Overall a superb buy, easily in my top 5 purchases ever
0920668364|5.0|My first baby is about to have his first baby, as long as I'm living my baby he'll be. I just ordered him his own copy, since I still have his original, that I read many times to him and his brothers. I still cry everytime I read it... I think it is absolutely beautiful and sweet.   A Mother's love is for forever and always.
B00192KCQ0|3.0|It's a successful resurrection of Metallica, but I still haven't totally forgotten the atrocity that was St. Anger. Judas Kiss rocks, as does All Nightmare Long and That Was Just Your Life. My personal favorite? The Day That Never Comes. In my opinion, the best song Metallica has put out since the Black Album era. Not such a fan of My Apocalypse. All in all a good album, but it'll take a lot more than good to erase St. Anger from my mind.
