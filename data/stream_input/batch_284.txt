B00004YKUY|5.0|I LOVE THIS CD!!! There are so many people who are whinning because S.P. is no longer with the group.  I've loved Jrny for 28 years, and without Perry, well you couldn't get better with Augeri.  He is an incredible frontman and and awesome person.  He HAS with the rest of the band brought Jrny out of the dark and into a whole new realm.  If you can't get past the fact that S.P. is no longer with them, then you are losing out...they will continue with Steve A. and will keep the incredible music coming with the most beautiful voice around.  Some peple just can't accept change when it comes to their favorite band, BUT, my band has only IMPROVED themselves with their lead vocals.  Don't get me wrong I LOVED them with S.P. and will cherish the old music.  Augeri is it for me as far as new music is concerned.  Live, he is PHENOMINAL, he can take you to a higher place with the voice of an angel, the moves of a man who knows where his new home is.  Journey has ARRIVED, thanks to Neal, Ross & Jonathan for finding Steve and Deen and accepting them as family like true Journey fans have.  I have met them all and will forever be in awe of their genuine love for their fans....
B0000033P2|5.0|This was an album I grew up listening to, my dad blasting our little 40 watts to the limits.  I remember my favorite song being &quot;The Sheriff&quot;.  The title song is 10 minutes long and certainly not a second was wasted.  &quot;The Sheriff&quot; is catchy and still is a symbol of my nostalgia.  Other good songs include Hoedown, an astounding version of Copland's version and Fugue, a tune that always reminds me of this album.  It is a must have for beginning fans or diehard fans and is more than worth the money.
B00003CXRM|5.0|I was pretty reluctant to watch &quot;O Brother&quot; in the first place, after being recommended to it from a friend. After i saw the movie however, i was SOOO satisifed. I absolutely LOVED this movie and i would recommend it to anyone. George Clooney is great as Everett and his comrads Pete and Delmar become instantly lovable by viewers of all ages. Not only is the movie funny, but it pulls of Homer's Odyssey like i never thought possilbe! This is truly a great film.
B00006JDVV|1.0|Why do people like to watch films like Independence Day, Deep Impact, etc.? They want to see cities destroyed and the process of its destruction -- which are what Reign of Fire lacks. The movie's posters and other ads are deceptive. Don't expect to see the dragons actually destroying cities, terrorizing its citizens. The story's main setting is in England, but you'll only get to see the skyline of an already destroyed London. Boring, boring, boring!
B00005JKMQ|3.0|Going into &quot;Ali&quot;, a Micheal Mann film, I thought this was going to be an absolutely great movie. As the credits began to roll however, I was a little dissapointed. The movie is very sluggish and seems to be forever explaining itself. It is also not what most people I have talked to expected. There isn't enough fighting, and I'm sorry but that's what was selling the movie from the beginning...Will Smith in the ring. I probably wouldn't recommend this movie to many, but you may enjoy it.
0316666343|3.0|I had heard so much about this book I had to give it a try.  It certainly provides the reader with a different and rather unique perspective from which to follow a story.  The book did touch an emmotional chord with me and the story did move right along, but I guess I was just expecting more - I never really felt any connection with the characters, nor even gained an understanding of the characters.  If you would like to try another book with a different treatment of how a child \\"taken\\" from a family affects the lives of individual family members, I suggest you try my book, \\"The Other Part Of Me.\\" I think you will find it emmotional and very suspensful.
0151008116|3.0|By browsing Amazon.com, and seeing the Reviews of Life of Pi, I quickly ordered it and eagerly awaited it's arrival. Excited when it came, I tore into it and began reading. The beginning was exciting, I thought it was richly written, and I  settled in to a wonderful reading experience! Once into the book,however,  I found parts to be more grotesque than necessary, it was pretty slow in parts, and I suppose I missed something because I don't agree with the other reviewers about it being so enlighteng etc.  It did not appeal to me and I'm afraid I wouldn't highly recommend this book. I thought it was ok.
B000007VCM|4.0|Seems every band starts out working their way up the ladder. These guys are definately maturing by the time they released Love. Ian can carry a tune a little better. Billy is more experienced with his axe. Rain and She Sells Sanctuary are the hits but Brother Wolf, Sister Moon lives in it's own respect. Their diversity is evolving and getting better. Being it was released 18 years ago and still survives makes it a classic. I really don't care for their earlier releases but this one is good enough to survive. Electric is still my favorite but wouldn't give this one up for anything.
B00005JLCI|1.0|Kenneth Branagh has become so annoying in his one-man quest to do every Shakespeare lead-role that I want to warn others: If you have seen one of his films, you have seen them all.  The only thing I remember from each of them is his patented, wimpy soliloquies.  He does every one of them the same, ending each line with an unpleasant intonation, as if every line were a question.  Maybe he was wondering what he was going to look like on screen when he recited the lines, rather than concentrating on becoming the part.  Unless you are a glutton for punishment, don't watch any of his films.
B0000085N4|4.0|The Cult has won in putting together a good Rock n Roll album here. The mix of songs is great and the layout is good too. I do echo the sentiment that sound quality could be better, all of the Cult CD's I own are pre-digitally-remastered so don't know if they sound any different. Electric in my mind SOUNDS the best, the kick bass drives right through you. This CD misses on the bass, both drums and guitar. Reminds me of an earlier Van Halen release that missed on bass also, so it happens. Still would recommend this release to any rock fan. For sheer rock get Electric, for dynamic rock get Sonic Temple.
1586210912|1.0|Do not waste your time with this charletan who comes from the Charles Givens, Wade Cook, Carleton Sheets mold. The only reason Kirosaki has best-selling books is because Amway leaders (mostly Dex Yager) pushed this book. Has dangerous advice (get rid of 401k, mutual funds bad) and give no specifics - mostly anecdotes and quick drawings - just like an Amway/Quixtar meeting. I should know, I was in the &quot;business&quot; for 4 years and when the leaders tell you to buy a book, the minions follow.<br />My former upline has tried to push this book on me many times, calling it &quot;revolutionary&quot;. I say check out John T. Reed's website for a real critique or read the Jan.2003 issue of SmartMoney for a good article on Mr. Kirosaki.<br />The Millionaire Next Door is a much better intro into who the &quot;rich&quot; actually are and got that way.
B000007WNN|5.0|I enjoy Pink Floyd for their deep lyrics, Led Zeppelin for everything, Sex Pistols and Henry Rollins for creativity. Every band puts out albums that some people don't like, this one happens to be my favorite from The Cult for the fact that they can play Rock 'n Roll! Now Zeppelin knew how to incorporate blues and rock like geniuses that they were but the Cult does a pretty good job here too. No, I'm not comparing the bands. This release just rocks! Sure it was a departure from what they had done in the past but that's how bands mature. The U2 of today is not the U2 of 20 years ago. This is the release where they found out they can play hard and got away from all those weird ones of their early times. I liked where they were going with Love and this release was my first Cult purchase and what turned me on to them (Wild Flower played on 91X in San Diego while in High School did it). At the time of this release it was nice to not hear another Depressed Mode/Cure/Pet Shop Boys/Echo & The Bunnymen clone in the Alternative market. Electric was never mainstream rock but it was rock nonetheless. Enjoy it for what it is.
B00005JLSC|5.0|I saw this movie today and was pleasantly surprised.  The cast was superb, surprisingly enough, the sets were excellent, the costumes were wonderful, and the production was great.  Whereas a film like \\"Moulin Rouge\\" (one of my faves) was gaudy and fantastically detatched from reality, all of the musical numbers in this film were staged as they would be in an actual musical- that is, happening onstage - and this grounded surrealism was what gave the film its sparkle.  It was like going to see a really fantastic Broadway show and having the best seats in the house.  I don't see how someone COULDN'T like it- even if they didn't like musicals, the movie was above par in all other applicable categories, as well.  So go see it- you won't be disappointed.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones is blessed with a rich, beautiful voice and a style that is unique.  If you don't like this album, then you obviously don't like music.  There isn't a bad song on the entire CD - and that's extremely rare, indeed!  My personal favorites are \\"Don't Know Why,\\" \\"Cold Cold Heart,\\" \\"Feelin' the Same Way,\\" \\"Come Away With Me,\\" \\"Turn Me On,\\" \\"Lonestar,\\" \\"I've Got to See You Again\\" and \\"Nightingale\\".  Okay, so it would have been easier to list my least favorites, but you get the idea - this is a great album!
B00005KARK|5.0|This is probably my favorite of all my 3-year old's videos.  It is great for a mom and child to watch together (lots of mommy-baby lovey gooey scenes).  It is far less violent than most more modern videos.  There are some race issues to be aware of--you do see some of the stereotypes of the day--but young children will not pick up on that and with older kids it's easy to talk to them about it.  The music is outstanding, even the in-between-scenes incidental music sticks with me all day.
B0000024JN|3.0|Not that they could crash thier plane, what the heck is that?  The joke is that the number of the plane is 3MTA3. Overall a popular album, but if you were to have just one BB album it's gotta be Pauls Boutique.
6305718954|4.0|I love this movie because it puts me in a very relaxing mood when I watch it. It reminds me of the ambient(Trip Hop Music) that I love so much. This movie has a very dark and gothic vibe too it which I feel is beautifully filmed. Patricia Arquette is one of the best at conveying quirky or unusual characters. For an hour and 47 mins, you are definitley in Frankie Page's world. I know that a lot of Christians will have a problem with the message that this film is trying to convey. And I think that is one of the reasons it didn't do as well as it should have. I love it because you rarely get a film that goes into a persons life style as this one did.<br />                 &quot;Very Brief Plot to this Story!&quot;<br />    Frankie Page (Patricia Arquette)is a beautiful alternative female that is d'void of faith. She is extremley egotistical, and very spoiled to some extent. She is possessed by a preacher that died before he could convey the pages that were hidden in the Bible. So basically she recieves the Stigmata because the preacher she is possessed by had it, and she is his messenger. Basically a self proclaimed atheist, recieves a quick lesson that God does exist. Now the whole stigmata is a gift thing,I don't quite understand? Also I don't understand why a Preacher would possess a womans body and act in such a belligerent manner? But anyway, the Church doesn't want this secret out and will do anything to protect it, Including homocide! See Patricia in &quot;Lost Highway -(Masterpiece) and Goodbye Lover&quot; another interesting experience. The soundtrack is very trippy and I recommend it as well. It features Bjork and Massive Attack as well as other interesting artist. Also if you are looking for another movie that has the same feel try &quot;Lost Souls&quot; starring Wynonia Ryder but don't expect much. &quot;Lost Souls&quot; is just Beautifully filmed and has a good gothic theme/mood to it. But I warn you Lost Souls isn't nearly as superior in plot as this film&quot;.<br />Arish
B00006F83Y|5.0|while i could certainly go on for quite a bit about this absolutely superb album, i'll instead keep it short.. buy this CD ! if you don't have it yet, you don't know what you're missing.
B00005RFQ5|3.0|Prince is basically a Jazz/Neo soul artist now! If you don't like either of those this isn't for you, It definitley disappointed me. He is also trying to promote The Jehovah's witness religion through this lp on the sly. I don't agree with anyone trying to force their myopic point of views on people. This album is decent, I know everyone is going to give it **** just because it is Prince. I am a Prince Junkie and I have followed his career since the beginning. I own every album + Imports all the way up to now. I think this album is creative in it's on way but it is dated. This is the genius that open up doors for people like Timbaland and the Neptunes. You have heard influence on everyones album from ............<BR>Missy Elliot, Neptunes, Timbaland, D'Angelo,Britney Spears,Maxwell,Basement Jaxx,Amar(trip hop artist)and last but not least T.L.C. And this is the most he can give to the public in this day in time? prince was always \\"Futuristic\\" and 5 steps ahead of everyone else. These James Brown impersonations on this album and Trumphets blowing is very, very Retro. What happened to the electronic Prince the one that composed Erotic City the one that composed \\"EMALE\\"? Where are the songs like Letitgo? I love Prince but to some extent I think he has stopped trying to impress anyone. This cd is O.K, for what is is I guess!<BR>But I do believe he should at least give us one more electronic upbeat funky club banger to let us know who's King! \\"1+1+1=3 is the only stand out track along with \\"Muse 2 the Pharoah\\" and \\"She loves me for me.\\" Those are the only hints at the Prince we use to know and celebrate! . But to some extent he is making music to please himself and not the public. This album is mellow and lacks the exuberance/creativity and crossover appeal his other efforts gave. This is the first Prince effort I ever put on at bed time and put me straight to sleep. I am not even going to touch on the Preaching lyrics in this compositon ! What happened to great spiritual songs like \\"Anna Stesia\\" \\"Power Fantastic\\" \\"Love thy shall B done\\" and \\"One of Us?\\" Those songs offered far more creativity and were less offensive and militant than this militant collection. Prince has always had religious overtones in his music but it was done alot more creatively and innovative in my opinion than these. I believe there is a big age factor in his creativity. We have to remember he is 40+ years of age. And unlike Madonna sometimes that has an effect on your creative process if you don't listen to current material and elevate. But if this makes HIM happy then so be it, I guess! I believe his innovative and pave the way 4 others days have past. These are the last efforts that he did in the 90's when he had fun making music and wasn't so serious! I wish he would have elevated like Madonna but Oh well!, I would have never seen this coming 10 years ago.<br />These are innovative and futuristic 90's works that were overlooked!<br />1. Come *****<BR>2. Gold Experience ****<BR>3. Emancipation ***** (3 disc)<BR>4. Crystal Ball (4 disc set) *****<br />Probably the last time will ever hear him push for the future and having  fun doing it. <br />\\"Prince is truley the best of our time, and I think there will never be another that will take his place.\\"<br />Arish

B00006CXXU|4.0|Christina Aguilera shows off her beautiful voice in this CD (as her other previous CDs). I found most of the songs really good. I thought it was definitely more soulful. However, while I love her voice, I'll have to admit that her \\"new\\" image brings down the album. She may be stripped in ways that she describes, but the term \\"strip\\" becomes so literal. A beautiful voice must be a presented with a beautiful image. I respect her music and everything, but she's just way too stripped for her own good.
1577311523|5.0|I used to stress and worry over the smallest little things in my life.  Things far off in the future that I couldn't change or may very well never happen at all.  After reading the first 15 pages of this book, I turned off my stress like a light switch!  All the thoughts, worries, and dread are over.  I don't dwell upon the past or the future anymore.  I'm only concerned with right now.  Anybody who has stress or anxiety, or who spends a lot of time worrying or thinking about the past or the future, you really should read this book.  Your life will be so much better!
0790729687|3.0|I made the worst mistake, I read the book before I saw the movie so the whole time I was thinking &quot;Hey that's not how it was in the book.&quot;  I still liked the movie but I was really hoping for better, I know they can't make the movie exactly like the book or it would get too long and too boring in some spots but well you know.  I still watch it everytime it is on.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|i was hesitant of buyin this album when i heard they were lesbians but All the things she said was so catchy i decided to buy the CD and i didnt regret it.
0151008116|5.0|Wonderfully written and very entertaining! Also good for the young at heart.<br />recommended: The Throne Room , by Belter
B000066F6H|3.0|I picked this up as soon as I heard &quot;Hate to Say I Told You So&quot; on the local &quot;alt-rock&quot; station and was swept up in the brashness of it all. That doesn't make for a great album, and given that this is a combo batch of imported stuff sends the red flags up. Given the Hives' propensity for Stonesy howl and other 60's affectations, these garage brats are going to have to toughen up their chops as writers if they want to make a permanent impact. But I'll still take the crunchy wallop of &quot;Supply and Demand&quot; or &quot;Hate to Say...&quot; over the current slate of hair band revivalists.
B00000099Y|1.0|Tool is WAY overrated, and nothing is original here.  Tool borrows techniques that many other bands have already done, and tries to come up with music that is supposed to fool the listener into thinking the stuff is original and groundbreaking!  That would be O.K., IF the music stood on it's own.  Nine Inch Nails did the same thing, and look at them now.  Their '15 minutes' is over... way over.  Tool will prove to follow the same pattern.  Here today, gone and forgotten tomorrow.  You can fool some of the people some of the time, but...
B00006JJ1O|3.0|t.A.T.u. are a Russian duo, formed in 2001.  Their debut album is a good collection of songs, based around arresting lyrics (both in style and content)on a backdrop of fast-paced drum beats.<br />The album has 12 tracks, of which 1 is a music video, another 1 an extended mix and 2 are Russian versions.  So there are 8 original tracks on the album.  Of these 8, 5 are prepared by Russian producers and the other 3 by Trevor Horn.  It is not entirely surprising that the latter 3 are the best tracks on the album, all adding brilliant audio effects and melodies to the underlying drum-beats.  It is also on these 3 tracks that the singers' vocal qualities are best developed. \\"All The Things She Said (Ya Shosla S Uma)\\" is the best example of this - the stunning contrasts between the bass-influenced, sometimes almost a capella verses and the dynamic, thrashing chorus are what makes that track so effective.  Similarly, \\"Not Gonna Get Us\\" combines high-pitched vocals with a fast pace very effectively and \\"Clowns\\" is also a worthy addition which changes pace exquisitely, and continually keeps the listener off-balance.<br />However, the other 5 tracks are not all bland. \\"Malchik Gay\\" and \\"Stars\\" are poor renditions which the album could have done without, but \\"Show Me Love\\" and \\"30 minutes\\" both have good ideas: the former is a fast paced track which is a poor cousin of \\"All The Things She Said (Ya Shosla S Uma)\\", and the latter is a slow song which starts well but quickly runs out of creativity. Finally, the cover version of The Smiths' \\"How Soon is Now?\\" is impressive, and makes one aware of how ahead of its time that song was in the mid 1980s; the wall of sound which was already there in the original is perfect for exploitation in an electronic, partly-ambient, partly-guitar style redolent of 2002.<br />The best tracks on the album are worthy of 5 stars.  When seen as a whole, the album is still well worth listening to.
B0000029GA|5.0|i think i reviewed this before but not sure..i gotta say this is nas best work along with lost tapes and it was written...very solid album
0060537639|5.0|Not to discount other reviews.. which you may have read on this site or others, but there is almost a racist, nationalistic standpoint against the information presented in Menzies' studies. I find it appalling to read that the very idea that the Chinese may have discovered the Americas is somehow morally, ethically or educationally \\"wrong\\". <br />On reflection, after reading this book, I had to dissect why I felt so resistant and almost spiteful towards the idea that the Chinese may have arrived in America before the Europeans... and you should ask yourself the same question. What moral, ethical or perhaps.. racial... standpoint are you holding onto that makes you feel this way? <br />I recommend this book if not only for the \\"fun\\" of reading a book that disputes what we know about the discovery of the Americas.. but also for the reflection that it may present regarding your own ideologies.
B000066NW0|4.0|All my friends were telling me about this album so i had 2 go try it out....so i did. I really liked the songs complicated and sk8er boi but those were the only songs i like.

0553266306|5.0|A perfect spy book should be like this - with an interesting plot, loads of details on characters, weapons and places. However I had hesitated before I started to read it. I thought - the main character, one who should be assasined, was doing quite well after 60' so nobody needed to tell me how it would end. Knowing how the book ends is an awfull thing as far as espionage titles are concerned. But it turned out to be quite different. While reading you imagined - if the Jackal is so good, what should happened to stop him. How will the police manage to do it. I'm glad I didn't see the film, because it's good to know no details. But it really doesn't matter if you know that D. G. didn't drop dead.
0789723107|5.0|The author wrote this book in the same way that he shows you how to make a usable website, with the title in mind.  You don't have to think about what he is saying because it makes sense.  This is an easy and humorous book.  It was made easy for the common person to understand, so in other words you don't have to be a 'rocket scientist' to comprehend it.<br />I read this book in a few hours and now I am itching to build my own site.
B000003CKH|5.0|This is by far the best cd I have ever bought. Unlike most Cake fans, I became one after I found out I was seeing them with Modest Mouse (who were the reason I purchased the tickets). After hearing Comfort Eagle, I became an instant fan. I picked this one up, and was blown away that Cake could put out more than one cd with so much punch. The music is simply brilliant. It's simple style, along with trumpets and bass lines that actually MOVE, this is one of the best cds I own (and I own way too many cds). The only reason there's a PA on this cd is because John goes a little crazy in the song \\"Nugget\\" and drops the f-bomb once in \\"I Will Survive.\\" All-in-all, it's my opinion that EVERYONE SHOULD OWN THIS ALBUM!
0920668372|5.0|This story is a wonderful example of a mother's love for her children.  Watching a child grow up and mature into an adult only deepens the love a mother feels.  Ask almost any mother of any grown man and she will tell you that, that grown man is still her baby.  There is a bond between mothers and their children that can't be broken.  This book deals with that.  There is also a bond fathers have with their children, and in the end when the tradition goes on and is passed on to his own daughter, the circle grows.<BR>As a parent, I choke up reading this book to my toddler.  What's more this is one book I want him to appreciate through out the years and share with his own children someday.<BR>There is a bit of silliness in the fact that she still rocks her grown son, but it is still a children's book and I think it's appealing to their sense of humor at that point. The overall theme and emotions are A+.
B000002NE4|5.0|Simple as that. The lyrics are in my opinion his best yet - finally producing the love lyrics we always knew he was capable of. 'Are you the one that I've been waiting for?' in particular is the apogee of poetry and rock combining. As the other reviewers note, there are many other superlative tracks on this one - people aint no good, into my arms, and green eyes chief among them. My number one album of all time. <br />Note - if you like murder ballads, you might not like this album. As I understand it, Nick and co were so disappointed with murder ballads that they rushed to record this one to make up for it (the release of this was however delayed as murder ballads inevitably sold more than all their other records).

She makes Stephanie sound overeducated, prim, and in her 40's.  I really hope the audio publisher goes back to using &quot;Joisey&quot; voices like Lori Petty or Debi Mazur and continues to use this reader for books that need more &quot;class&quot; and less &quot;streetwise.&quot;

It's not a copy from any album from their glorius past.. it's a BRAND NEW ALBUM capturing Maiden's powerfull energy that they once had and channeling it through the waves of this BRAVE NEW WORLD! It's a terrific job they did! Congratulations Maiden! <BR>.... And know that 21st. century IRON MAIDEN has 3 (three) GUITARS!! You can imagine the solos by yourselves! UP THE IRONS!
0316666343|4.0|The story of Susie Salmon's death and subsequent character in heaven is a disturbing but absorbing read. Susie, 14-years-old, is brutally raped and murdered on her way home from school one day. What ensues is a description of the unfolding experiences of her family -- including their search for the killer -- as Susie looks down upon them from heaven, unable to communicate with them and desparate to be alive and grow up with them. <br />The book is especially haunting because the author, Alice Seybold, herself was raped. Seybold is a gifted writer and one who is able to wrap hope and beauty into the plot, despite the grim events. In addition, she brings the characters to life; each of susie's friends and family members are well-developed. The plot is intruiging every step of the way.<br />All 8 women in my book club were moved by this book. If you enjoy good writing and can withstand the topic of the rape and murder of a young girl, you will be very taken with the story of Susie Salmon.
0316666343|4.0|I loved this book. I know most people dont like it because its 'not emotional' but personally, I liked it better that way. I am a fan of books that don't try to get all mushy. Its more intresting to me when its cold cut and on the table. While I agree the the character devolpment wasn't brilliant, I did think the story was intriguing.I found my self crying tears of sorrow and of joy through out the book.
0066214122|2.0|Michael Crichton's newest novel reads like a 21st century update of his earlier novel, The Andromeda Strain. The premises are different, of course, but other aspects of the novel ring remarkably familiar and somewhat formulaic. Instead of an evolving alien disease as the enemy, we now have an evolving manmade swarm of nanomachines. Instead of a multi-level compound to study the disease, where scientists must go through several stages of bacterial and biological sanitization, we now have a nano-manufacturing compound, where employees must go through several stages of dust and micro-particle sanitization.<br />Perhaps Crichton has spent too much time recently working with Hollywood on movies and television productions. Indeed, &quot;Prey&quot; often reads like a movie script, with detailed descriptions reading like they were meant more for a director or set designer than for a reader with his or her own vivid imagination. In this novel, &quot;detail&quot; becomes more important than &quot;color.&quot;<br />&quot;Prey&quot; does, however, have its redeeming qualities. Interesting scientific anecdotes on apparently true-to-life studies and experiments pepper the text and add a certain sense of believability to the novel. Unfortunately, one-dimensional characters and unimaginative action sequences (again, written as if for a movie director) detract from the story more than the science brings to it.<br />The book does make for a quick read, but if you're expecting the same science-based suspense, realistic detail and intricate story-weaving as in some of Crichton's other novels, you will be disappointed.
B00005JLSC|5.0|This is without a doubt the greatest movie musical to come along in a very long time.  It has the amazing score (which is the greatest star of the film), great acting and singing from everyone involved, and amazing sets.  I have already seen \\"Chicago\\" twice, and plan to see it again many times in the future.  This movie will definetly go down in history with \\"Cabaret,\\" \\"Grease,\\" and \\"My Fair Lady\\" as THE definitive movie musical.  Go see it and be amazed like I am.
B00006V9A0|5.0|This is the compilation of the greatest songs of what is quite possibly THE greatest rock band of all time. At the least Nirvana was up there with the legends such as Led Zepellin, Pink Floyd, and the Beatles. Man of these songs are bestsellers, from platinum-selling albums. They represent rock music in steriotype. Everybody knows who Kurt Cobain is, even my 60 yr. old Dad! Any true rock fan should own this album.
B0000019HU|5.0|Couple up this foursome of very talented and creative musicians, with the production skills of Steve Albini and you got an album for the ages.<br />Its the sort of album that I plop into the player, turn off the lights, lay down, and soak it all in.<br />The guitar work is amazing, almost hypnotic, The vocals while usually spoken word explode with amazing power when the incoherent ramblings become forceful croons of emotion.<br />There's probably a few other albums one would have to listen to, to fully appreciate this album. However once you're ready for it there's little out there that's better.
B00005JLO2|4.0|I am very surprised at the number of negative comments about this film.  My wife and I both loved it.  We found the action scenes and cinematography to both be exceptional.  I agree with the criticism that the retreat of the British troops to \\"form a square\\" seemed a bit out of kilter in that they seemed almost hopelessly surrounded but somehow escaped.  To us, however, this was a small blemish on very believeable action sequences and a very entertaining story.  I have seen the 1939 version several times and enjoyed it, but this was much better to me.  <br />Those who seem to have a problem with this movie seem to have standards few historical action films would meet.  Perhaps they just don't enjoy the genre.  I happen to enjoy films such as the Daniel Day-Lewis version of The Last of the Mohicans, The Patriot, etc. If you enjoy those type films, you will almost certainly enjoy this one.  If you don't, you won't.  This film is not totally true to the book.  So what?  It's a darn good movie! Just relax, be transported back to the heyday of the British Empire and enjoy a good historical action film with a love story and beautiful action scenes and suspense.
0316666343|2.0|well this book is a great read until you get to the last three chapters!  it seems like another person wrote the end of the book.  Maybe Alice just got bored? In anycase if you want a good ending this book is not recomended!!
B0000797IO|1.0|Save your time, save your money.  This movie is horrible.  I got this for my wife, thinking it was a movie she would enjoy more than me, but she didn't like it one bit either.  Although the movie was only 90+ minutes, it seemed like 2.5 hours.  Where is the Zero star rating, one star is too high.
B000002UJQ|1.0|not quite that good. don't believe the hype, with ideas and riffs stolen from better artists (not to be mentioned due to radioheads bandwagon following who prodably check this page religiously) radiohead has fooled a lot of college kids and other self nominated intellectuals into thinking this is original work. save your dime and check out. . . well . . . anything else.
B000002H2H|4.0|This might sounds strange, but I first listened to this album this year(2003).  I have the black album and Justice for al, so I wanted an old album from them.  It beginns with the incredibly fast song \\"Fight fire with Fire\\" which is ok, but not that much my type.  The u hear Ride the lightning which is good too, but From whom the Bell Tolls is more a metall classic.  <br />But the one song here that abselouteley stands out is in my opinion \\"Fade to Black\\" up untill this year I thought that \\"Unforgiven 2\\" and \\"nothing else matters\\" were Metallicas best metal ballad, boy was I wrong.  Fade to black is DEFENTLEY the best song here, but also my al time favorite Metallica song.  Unforgiven and Nothing else matters cant even be compared to this masterpiece of a song!  <br />Whats speciall about this song is the lyrics(the music too of course).  The song cover the very hard topic sucide.  Few songwriters have sugn about this topics(compares to al those who sings about love songs).  Its a topic few people understands, but after this masterpiece of a song, u will be able to see alot more.  <br />Its lyric is too beautifull for words and the song is really deep,dark and sad.  I felt that Jamies Heathfield wrote the words any sucidel, or anyone who have had big problems would be able to relate to.  The end is the best, it have an guitar solo written from the soul!  <br />Only in such a real way especially the lines \\"Emtiness is filling me, To the point of agony.  Growing darkness taking dawn.  I was me, but now hes gone\\" WOW I GIVE THIS SONG 1000 STARS, and I bought this cd only for this song.  It touch something deeeep deep into my soul.<br />Another great song here is \\"Escape\\", this isnt as sad and deep but the singing is awesome, and the guitarplaying is as usuall incredibly good.  It is more a hard rock then a metall song.  I also like \\"Creeping Death\\" and the last instrumental song which beginns with a soft guitarplaying and turns into a heavy metal songs which makes u want to jump and head bang.<br />I never thought I would ever like a metall band this much, but Metallica made the genre universal.  Actually Metallica is the only heavy metall band I like at this moment.<br />P.S : Buy this instead of \\"Black album\\" \\"Re load\\" etc.  The songs here are much more meaningfull and real!  Along with \\"And Justice for al\\" this contains the best metallica songs ever.
0006531407|5.0|I couldn't put it down. This book is filled with all sorts of useful information. This is a must have for anyone. What i liked best about it was it had alot of information you could actually use, most survival books have situations your average joe will never find  himself in. Not the case with this one. The first aid chapter alone is worth the price if the whole book. I highly reccomend it to anyone interested.
B00006LETU|5.0|I don't need to tell most of you how good it is to listen to this album....even 20+ years later.  The vocals and the jazz influence make for a smooth listen that won't dissapoint.  However, the real story here is the DVD-Audio.  For those of us with a DVD-A capable player, this is a must for the collection.  On many early DVD-A discs, my JVC DVD player would not let me playback the Dolby 5.1 tracks (that are compatible with every DVD player).  I could only access the DVD-A tracks.  On this disc, I can select either the stereo versions or the surround sound versions and it plays back throuh both the 5.1 analog audio cables or the digital cable (although I suspect the digital cable playback is not DVD-A but Dolby 5.1).  The audio is sweet! They even threw in the \\"New Frontiers\\" video.  What's not to like?  Buy it.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I don't like it when you have to skip songs on CDs. It just gets annoying. But this is great, I don't skip one single song. I can't wait for a new album! I heard him on the radio about this time last year, and that was it. I had to find out who he was and where I could get his music. Awesome tunes and lyrics!
B0000636UN|5.0|Sheryl Crow really comes into her own on this album.  Probably the best record she's made since her first album.  This album bleeds the beach.  A great summer album.  From &quot;Soak Up The Sun&quot; to &quot;Hole In My Pocket&quot;,  a great cruising album for summer fun.  With killer guests like Don Henley,  Natalie Maines,  and Lenny Kravitz,  this record is one of my top 5 for Album Of The Year.
B00006RCNW|5.0|This is, by far, the greatest television drama series to be shown to the public.  At first glance, one would question the content of it, asking why it's not on HBO.  Perhaps because HBO couldn't handle the intesity and depth this show displays.  Every twist and turn is as smooth and memorable as the hair of an angel.  &quot;The Shield&quot; is forever a milestone in television history.  <br />If you're human and alive, then it's highly recommended that you get your hands on this!  And make sure to pump up the volume when watching!
B000060P79|2.0|If there were a 1 1/2 stars, that's what this album would get...<br />No Pads, No Helmets... Just Balls is overrated.  While I recognize that many people find Simple Plan \\"wonderful\\" and \\"totally awesome,\\" I tend to disagree.  If there is one song on this record that breaks set in any way, shape, or form, please let me know...  This is all music you've heard before, from more deserving and convincing artists like New Found Glory and Blink-182.  Simple Plan is a band marketed towards the teeny boppers gone \\"punk.\\"  This is an album you'd expect to find in your little sister's CD shelf, right next to Good Charlotte and Avril Lavigne.  Right from the start, All... goes right down the proverbial toilet.  With catchy singles like \\"I'd Do Anything\\" and \\"Just A Kid,\\" Simple Plan is showing how willing and ready they are to sacrifice their meager musical talent for record sales.  Granted, most other groups do this too, but they cover it up better.  (See what I said about convincing?)<br />All in all, I'd skip this one over...  Sure, if your friend has it, burn it and give it a listen.  However, be warned that there is nothing special here, just your standard three chord guitar hooks and a (really, really whiny) repetitive singer with similar lyrics.
0671027344|5.0|My friend loaned this book to me in my freshman year of high school, telling me I would love it, and I absolutely did. Since then, it became a staple of my high school. Everyone read it, everyone passed it around, and everyone underlined their favorite quotes. Almost my entire book is underlined!<BR>Anyway, this book is really about life. It really makes you look at yourself in terms of Charlie. You become Charlie. I know how weird that sounds, but you have to read it to believe it!<BR>This book is absolutely wonderful, and a must-read for everyone. At college, I'm still passing it around to any willing soul. Very Salinger-esque, which is a high compliment in my opinion.<BR>Everyone should read this book, so they can truly know what it means to feel infinite.
B000056NX5|5.0|I absolutely loved this version of the movie. Fred Johanson played an excellent Pilate. Jérôme Pradon makes a very expressive Judas Iscariot, angry when anger is implied, worried when worry is implied. <br /> My only problem with the film is Glenn Carter, he's a bit more screamy than musical on his higher notes.<br /> But the rest of the cast makes up for it. Making it a great production.
0393312836|5.0|Long story why I originally read this book, but I wasn't sure what I was going to think about it. The main character (Alex) reminded me a lot of a guy I know, which is extremely scary.<BR>Other than that, this book was amazing. A little hard to understand at first, I admit, but once you learn the language, the book is awesome.<BR>Four boys, out to wreak havoc in any way possible, including violence, theft, and rape. In some ways, this is a very disturbing book, but you cannot put it down, either. The boys live in a world all their own (including their own language, \\"radsat\\", which is mostly just russian-based words), and when Alex finally gets caught and booked, there is a huge turn in the book. He is taken to rehabilitation, but then the horrors go on.<BR>Amazing and insightful book, I recommend it to anyone who can stomach it. (note: \\"horrorshow\\", as used in my title, means great...in radsat)
0060537639|5.0|Revolutionary theories that may change history.<BR>Beutifully written with intriguing hard evidences,<BR>such as sunken Junks, that will soon be verified<BR>or discreditted.  A must read.
B00003CXFV|1.0|These reviews are obviously purely subjective, and I wouldn't expect people to have the same tastes as me. It's nice to see that so many people enjoyed this film. I like to see people happy.<br />That being said, I enjoyed NOT enjoying this film. Awful, awful, awful. Typical formulaic tripe, and unpleasant, grating tripe at that. \\"Thelma and Louise\\" were far more sympathetic characters.<br />Oh, and the story is wildly inaccurate, too. []

B00005JLEU|4.0|Spirited away is a Japanese animation about a 10 year old girl who travels with her parents to a new house. On the way they discover what seems to be an abandoned theme park, which the parents explore. It turns out to be a magic world, in which the young girl has to use her own rescources to initially survive and then to rescue her parents. <br />The film is one of the most succesful Japanese films to be made in recent times. It is no surprise as not only is the story involving but the animation is beautiful. Rather than using computer generated graphics the film consists of the old style animation in which drawings are used to create the scene and movement of the characters. Each scene is carefully painted and the detail showing such things as the growth of moss on steps is painstaking. <br />The film is also interesting as it is based on a mythology which is Japanese rather than Western. Whilst there are a couple of characters called witches, the Magic World is Japanese and features the eight million gods of the Buddist mythology. Somehow this makes the plot of the film totally unpredictable and no cliched. With Western story conventions, characters behave in stereotyped ways. Witches are evil, fairies are good. In this film the motives and actions of the characters are far more complex. <br />After seeing the film some time ago and thinking about it the one thing which comes back though is the beauty of the animation. Even the closing stills are little works of art in themselves.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I am so impressed that today's market allows such open music on a controversial topic.  These songs, especially &quot;All The Thing She Said&quot; are so touching because the lyrics are so real.
0066214122|2.0|Michael Crichton tells us in the bibliography for this book that this novel is entirely fictious but the underlying research programs are real.  Well, that might be true, but after reading this novel about adventures in nanotetchnology gone awry, anyone who is expecting a revisit to Crichton's classic \\"The Andromeda Strain\\" is on the road to a big disappointment.  Sure the science is there, but the story is weak and the characters are worse.<br />Jack Forman is an out of work software specialist functioning, for the first third of the book, as a modern day Silicon Valley Mr. Mom.  His wife, Julia, however, is at the forefront of Xymos Technology, and is working on a nanotechnology project for the military at a lab in the Nevada desert.  Just that sentence alone should clue you in to what is going to happen as nanotechonological \\"critters\\" are introduced into the ecosystem with a full fledged dose of predator-prey relationships.  Though Crichton tries to set the table for what is to come with an introduction to artificial eveolution in the 21st century, the early part of the novel spends way too much time on how stereotypical Jack kids are and entirely too much time on just what he is preparing for dinner that night.  When Jack is called into the Nevada desert to serve as a consultant for Xymos, things pick up, but just barely.<br />Where is the in-depth consequences of \\"Timeline\\" or the excitement of \\"Jurassic Park\\"?  Still, I just couldn't give a Crichton book just one star, but I have to admit that I kept saying to myself \\"Didn't I just see this on the Sci Fi Channel?\\"  My goal in finishing the book was the knowledge that I had the new Dean Koontz novel sitting on my bookshelf once I was through with this one.  A friend of mine also read this book and he said that \\"Prey\\" would make a great Made for TV Movie.  That should be condemnation enough, right there.
B00005RYKU|5.0|An excellent movie, very entertaining - the suspense is great, the story is very interesting and very original. Lee Lee Sobieski is doing really, really great, and the other actors too. I enjoyed all the movie from start to finish, it was really good viewing it and it is a good buy !
0345451325|5.0|This Book is one of the BEST books I Ever Read! It is exciting from start to end! BUY THIS BOOK!
6304401132|5.0|Sleeping Beauty has been my favorite movie ever since I was a child, and it still is, the story plot is amazing, and fits in <BR>the adventure/fantasy category, magnificent is the most evil of all disney villians, and sleeping beauty, the most beauitful, this movie will keep you glued the the T.V. if you're a child or adult, a must have!
B000054OXU|5.0|Certainly one of Neil's best recordings, mainly because it's something only Neil could get away with. All the boring old hippy farts who fell in love with him after Harvest will poo-poo this one, but anyone with a brain and a love for experimentation will immediately see its charms.<br />You have to wonder how he gets the inspiration for this stuff, though. Neil: &quot;I think I'm gonna do a song about havin' a bad news beat, 'cause I got an eye in the sky, right Kootch? Heh, heh, heh. And touchin' the night and stuff.&quot;<br />It's hard to pick a stand-out here. Most will tell you it's &quot;Hippie Dream,&quot; but &quot;Bad News Beat&quot; is fantastic, &quot;Violent Side&quot; is prime Neil screaming, &quot;Pressure&quot; is great fun, and whoever played that bass lick to &quot;Hard Luck Stories&quot; is a genius.<br />To those who think I'm being tongue-in-cheek, think again. This is a top ten Neil album for me, and it rarely ever leaves my car stereo. And to those who are still annoyed by this album, ha, you fell right into Neil's trap.
0316666343|4.0|I've read the other reviews and felt I needed to add this to<BR>offset all the negativity. It's not a story you can truly \\"enjoy\\"<BR>because the subject matter is a bit too disturbing for that - but<BR>once you pick it up you won't put it down easily. Perhaps it<BR>is not written in the tradition of \\"classic literature\\" but I <BR>was unaware that it was supposed to be. It's this and nothing<BR>more - hours of entertainment about a subject that can be difficult<BR>but is somehow made interesting and more bearable. There are<BR>few books out there that you could compare it too and that's <BR>what makes it worthwhile. I'm sure the author realized she<BR>might upset some people with her description of heaven<BR>but as we all know she hasn't been there (nor have any of her<BR>reviewers) and thus is entitled to create it the way she sees<BR>fit. I would strongly recommend this, as a matter of fact I've<BR>already given it to 4 other people to read and they all enjoyed<BR>it.
B00006RU5B|4.0|As a huge fan of SoundGarden and RATM, I was stoked to hear about this collaboration.  They have not disappointed!  The guitar riffs have the distinct Tom Morello signature, and Cornell's excellent vocal range and ambiguous, brooding lyrics make for a rock explosion to the highest degree.  It appears that Cornell has adapted some of the unique melodic vocal style from his solo album to a couple of the tracks on this album.  My only criticism is that there is very little that is new or groundbreaking in the sound of the any of the tracks. However, if you have a formula that works and sounds good it doesn't always have to be groundbreaking.  I mean look at Metallica.  Their records are still flying off the shelves and the last 3 albums they have released sound eerily similar to one another. That being said this album is definitely not just Soundgarden on steroids, or Rage without the politics.  It is a marriage of two groups that each adds their unique mark to the album. All of the tracks are more heavily influenced by Cornell's lyrics and style, which is a  huge benefit to the album, as it is obvious that he is a more well rounded and talented musician than any member of the &quot;Zack&quot;-less Rage.
6305263248|5.0|Tight plot, a fast car, great action sequences and a superb cast -- this is one of the best in its genre. This role is not a new character for DeNiro (tough smart guy) but the interplay between he and Jean Reno is very good.  The girl (isn't there always one in spy flicks?) is a real bombshell and not at all gratuitous. The look &amp; feel of this film is modern day &quot;French Connection.&quot; Action flick junkies will like this film.
B00006879E|5.0|It's hard to classify Maroon 5 within the rock genre. They're active enough to compete with Goo Goo Dolls or Third Eye Blind in quality of lyrics and energy but they know how to be mellow enough to occasionally dip into Oasis. The songs are all good, and they don't have that Creed-like tone where all the songs sound alike. The energy is there is even if the pace isn't...something that is quite rare among rock groups. It's not fair to associate Maroon 5 with how they compare to (or remind me of) other bands, and I think their music will prove it. This cd is quite spectacular. Buy it now!
B00005T30L|4.0|Ghost World is 'fablesque' with humor that is layered and many times brought out only by the great acting of Thora Birch and Steve Bucsemi.  <br />Birch's character, Enid, is [mad] at the world and has a lot of fun toying with others.  Her comments are biting and judgmental, and make one smile at the mere anticipation of the next one.  Bucsemi's character, Seymore, seems to have found a place in the world, but is only content with his life where collecting old records is his only passion.  He wants more, but is unmotivated to make changes.  Only with Birch's help is he able to move forward-- to a better place is up for interpretation.<br />Scarlett Johansson as Rebecca is the perfect sidekick for Enid.  Full of wit and independent in her own right, she has to resolve her own issues as Enid searches/comtemplates her future.<br />This film is great, but I would warn people that haven't seen it yet. It's an aquired taste.  The word \\"quirky\\" has been thrown around a lot, but I think that it is the best description.  It's hard to really classify this movie into one genre or another because it doesn't follow the same mainstream format that most movies adhere to.  If you like films like Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums, you'll probably like this one.<br />I have the DVD and the extras are decent.  There's no commentary, which would have been a real nice touch.  But overall the film gets 4.5 stars, but the DVD itself gets only 4.
0676973779|5.0|A wonderfully written journey through life's struggle.<BR>Enjoyable approach to a biography.<BR>Well done!
0316666343|3.0|This book is haunting and disturbing. I have a small daughter, and this may account for my evaluation, but I can imagine that it would be disturbing just the same for any normal person. The book forces one to be reminded of the fact that life can be utterly brutal and that horror exists in life. I liked the way the father was developed, and also the little brother. I didn't like the author's heaven. I assume that heaven is heaven, and at least you achieve peace and &quot;happiness&quot;, that is beyond this world. Susie was in purgatory I believe. Maybe I am sensitive, but the book affected me strongly. The author did succeed in making her message felt. I don't like the book because of its grimness, but out of respect for the victims of horror I have to acknowledge its effect. I am trying to come to terms with it.
B00005JKLZ|3.0|This movie wasn't bad.  It was a more plausible remake compared to the remake of The Planet of the Apes.  If your into special effects, then you should enjoy this movie more so than the original.  I would rent it before I bought it.  For me the original was better, of course.
0316666343|5.0|I read this book. I am now, periodically, reading the reviews with great interest (as well as reading another book with an unusual presentation, Norman Thomas Remick's &quot;West Point&quot;). People seem to either love Alice Sebold's &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot;, or hate it. I think it is due to the enormous amount of PR it has had, for some reason that I for one certainly cannot explain. The PR has created great expectations. Some people may have expected too much. Though far from perfect, I still rate it at least a 5(-) star book of fiction owing to a creative and interesting presentation that I enjoyed.<BR>Also recommended: Norman Thomas Remick's &quot;West Point: ...Thomas Jefferson&quot;, another creative presentation I am reading that, unlike &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot;, is non-fiction and quite a little education so far.
B00003CXDD|5.0|our friend below seems to be a little biased toward Willow, so please disregard all that he said. Plus he/she/it is just flat out wrong. but anyway, Willow is a greatly entertaining movie for those that like magic and sword fights and incredible adventures. all in about 2 hours. great direction from Ron Howard, great score from James Horner, and great acting from Warrick Davis and Val Kilmer. and until Willow, there werent any major fantasy films of this type before either. so watch and enjoy this movie. and then buy it.
B00005OAIE|4.0|John Mayer seems to define what new age avant garde songwriting is about. If Elton John is a fan, he must be doing something right! <br />Mayer has unfortunately yet to break into the British scene. He will be a welcome change to all the pop fluff we get here!
B0000076MI|5.0|You really here how amazing Alvin is as a musician as he carries this group with obviously less talant on his shoulders with his incredable energy, creativity and soul from his guitar.<BR>He's the best, the mst underappreciated guitar player of his generation. I recommend that fans check out Alvin's &quot;best&quot; work which has been his solo work. If you haven't heard Zoom, which has the Bluest Blues cut with George Harrison and Jon Lord, it is WOW, and Let it Rock from 1994 and the Alvin Lee Anthology, your missing another side os Alvin Lee, playing with better bands and showing the variety of his amazing work.
B000000H6D|5.0|I love all of TON, but this one is very special.  It is a masterpiece with the exception of a song or two, which are still acceptable.<br />Get it, love it!
B000002NBY|5.0|Basically, this is one of the only cds i have where i dont skip a track or put one song in front of another. when you listen to the cd, you start with track 1 (boy in the bubble) and dont do anything but listen until the last note of the last song is over. There are many different types of songs on this cd, but they all flow together perfectly. Still, my favorite songs are &quot;Graceland&quot;, &quot;Crazy Love&quot;, and &quot;Diamonds...&quot;  Although the music itself is outstanding, i think its Simon's strange and meaningful lyrics that make his songs great.  My favorite: &quot;Losing love is like a window in your heart...&quot;
B000069HK2|5.0|This cd is the best thing i have ever heard they mix so many type of music into a mix. The sounds are like poetry it does not need music but music even makes it better and anyone who does not like them is a complete idot. THey put there heart and soul into this music and it is amazing this is the first cds. THe best songs are (The Tase of Ink,Poetic Tragety,Blue and Yellow, and finally A Box Of Sharp Objects. If you like bands like Thurseday, Saves the Day, and Hopesfall you will love this band. The music is mix of screamo,punk,and poetry
B00000JTB2|5.0|You don't need to be a guitarist to appriciate this CD.  If you are, then you will be basting in a pool of your own drool throughout but even folks who have never touched a guitar would hopefully get much out of this pairing of two legends of the guitar world.  <br />Stevie is held back on this one.  He plays with less flash than on some CDs, but in many ways that makes his work here even tastier.  Both men are obviously in awe of the others' abilities and they play off of these strengths throughout.  Albert frequently gives Stevie advice on the ways of the world and the two have such an apparent respect for each other.  Dig \\"Pride and Joy\\".  oh my....
B000066HHK|5.0|Im sure by now you've heard of Reanimation. a different sound to Linkin Park's hybrid theory. But what about the original hybrid theory. The Hybrid Theory EP. What does that sound Like? Well rest assured it sounds good. This Ep is from when they were called Hybrid Theory. This cd is a different sound from what you heard on Hybrid Theory LP and Reanimation. Songs such as,Step up,And One, and Carosel are the biggies on this EP. This is pre Linkin Park. Something that no fan should pass by.This is a darker side to Linkin Park. and in all rights this was there Preanimation. No remixes all original (including the original High Voltege)It may be a bit short for a Ep but it's definitely worth it. So If you like Hybrid Theory LP or Reanimation then you should check this Ep out.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I first stumbled upon John Mayer at 2 in the morning while I was channel surfing. His voice caught my attention, and after that I was hooked. Since I purchased Room for squares, there is rarely a day that goes by, without this cd in my cd player.<br />You know, the more popular something is, the more it is going to be put down. If this album had not made such a commotion I belive negative reviews would be non-existant!
B000002NFM|5.0|This is a phenomenal album well worth buying, its definitely in my top 10 and I mostly like darkwave and distorto noisecore. Liam did an excellent job on it. It has great dance songs like mindfields and good cyber punk(for lack of a better word)songs like fuel my fire. I reccomend this album 2 anyone.
B00006BTCA|5.0|My initial scepticism abot the Ian Curtis sounding vocals was washed away when I realised that Interpol are a band that are going to be very important!!<BR>                    As a long standing fan of The Chameleons (UK) Iwas very impressed to hear that Interpol had attended there recent NYC gigs. There is a lot in Turn on the Bright lights that reminds me of getting excited about Joy Division/The Chameleons/Echo in the eighties and I cant give a higher reccomendation than that.
B00005OATM|5.0|The staging is amusing. In fact, I was slightly shocked at the beginning where the depths of the Rhine is represented by a hydro-electric dam and those Rhine-maidens become &quot;call-girls&quot;. Yet, in some strange way, the production works. And it grows on you with each successive viewing. <br />The direction of Patrice Chereau is fluent. Indeed, it's so fluent that one feels that the 2.5 hour work lasts only for slightly more than an hour. Maybe it's because Chereau's clever direction (and Brian Large's wonderful video direction) made viewers focus on the dramatic strengths of this opera. Or maybe the staging is so full of interesting (and dramatically valid) strokes that one is totally engrossed by the viewing experience. The performances of the singers are fine, too.<br />Despite initial reservations, I must say I like it a lot now.
B000000HXK|3.0|Having been a long time fan of Talk Talk, and having read the glowing reviews, I figured I'd take a chance on this CD.  While the CD may have, at one time, been considered groundbreaking that ground has long been lost.  Don't get me wrong,  it's a pleasant enough.  So so production and recording and a fairly fixed formula just don't do it for me.  I was expecting great things from this CD and it just hasn't delivered.
B000002N2P|5.0|I've been a big fan of Green Day for years, even now  that I'm not into punk rock I still love them, but especially this album. Pure genius, 3 chords, no-solos but it's still amazing. Listen to it, you'll understand why it's so great.
1559408855|5.0|Without question, the ugliest and most beautiful film ever made. And I'm glad some people will find my five-star rating scary.
B00006RCNW|5.0|Who ever thought that the obscure cable network channel FX would ever produce such a gritty, phenomenal, ultra-real drama as The Shield?  I certainly would have never guessed it.  Yet, because I work in the field of law enforcement, I decided to give FX a chance and watched the pilot for The Shield last year.  I was truly blown away.  This is no Law and Order, folks.  This is as close to the real deal as any TV show will ever get.  The acting in the show is truly amazing, and I give the writers a lot of credit for making the show credible among law enforcement circles.  If you want to know what life can be like behind the protective walls of a police department, watch this show.  You will certainly not be disappointed.
B00000JLWW|1.0|Excited about your new widescreen or DVD player and want to experience it with your favorite film, Titanic?  WAIT!  This is perhaps the worst DVD I have ever purchased (and in 3 years I've purchased many).  It is not anamorphic, or enhanced for your current or future 16x9 (widescreen) tv.  It has no extras such as commentaries, documentaries, interviews, or deleted scenes (from a film famous for originally having an over 4 hour cut).<br />I love the film.  But this is worse than just a bad dvd, it's a ....  I would venture to guess that this dvd was cut to capitalize on the original rush of fans who are mostly new to dvd and would buy anything \\"Titanic\\", knowing that many of these same fans will buy it again when the \\"Special Edition\\" or \\"Anniversary Edition\\" or \\"Awards Edition\\" which will inevitably come out a few years later, just to increase revenues.<br />Save your money or buy a used version.
0066214122|2.0|Books like this make you appreciate Stephen King, especially when it comes to little details like plot, characters and motivations; for instance, why does the swarm of artifical whatever designed to function as a camera suddenly start murdering anything that steps outdoors? Crichton has obviously done his homework, but the setting is pure \\"Andromeda Strain,\\" the plot is recycled \\"Jurrasic Park,\\" the text reads like a first draft with myriad inconsistences, and the dialogue makes Ken Follett sound like David Mamet. And ya gotta love the yuppie scum that's more worried about what the CEO and venture capitalists are going to think versus the carnage and moral implications of man-munching microbes. All in all, a great idea poorly executed. PS nice high school graduation photo on the back cover.
0684800713|5.0|I read this book twice, and I'm glad I did. I saw many things I didn't see the first time: the constant reminders and symbols of manhood and how Jake was not a \\"complete man\\"; how Jake and Brett are happier together than with anyone else; the streamline style of Hemingway--who is a master of \\"show don't tell\\". I could go on. If you read this book, read it twice. I was disappointed the first time, but delighted the second time.
B00005JLWL|4.0|I saw this movie at the end of a Utopian Philosophy class.  For those of you familiar with these books you will probably appreciate the message of the film more than others.  It was fascinating to see elements of 1984, Brave New World, and Fahrenheit 451 blended in a Matrix-type action film.  Christian Bale and Emily Watson do a terrific acting job, although Taye Diggs could have used a bit of help on the whole \\"emotion\\" thing I'm sorry to say.  Admittedly, some elements within the movie were technically incongruous.  For example, if there is no emotion in Libria, why is Cleric Brandt (Taye Diggs) ALWAYS smiling?  For those who don't care about the whole philosophy bit, the action scenes are worth the money.  Wait for \\"it\\" at the end . . . you'll know what I'm talking about when you see it.
B000069AUI|5.0|how do you top an amazing debut (parachutes). you record another amazing record for your sophmore effort. everything you loved about parachutes while still growing and maturing. definitely not another flash in the pan or radiohead ...
0066214122|1.0|I have loved Crichton's books since the Andromeda Strain but Prey isn't indicative of his previous work.  The premise is ridiculous, the plot moves at an uneven pace and relies on anonbtuse belief in technology.  The whole book rushes along and then ends with a literary can of Raid. If you like his techno thrillers, read Jurassic Park again.
B00005ONMJ|1.0|Wonderful picture quality, act, interpretation, directing... but awful sound quality in MONO!!! I was expecting more from this DVD.
B0000640VN|4.0|My husband and I both loved this movie! The characters are all wonderful and, although I have always enjoyed &quot;Somewhere In Time&quot;, the added dimensions of humor and excitement in &quot;Kate and Leopold&quot; make this movie, for me, much, much more enjoyable! Bottom line: It's a terriffic romantic comedy. It'll make you laugh, gasp, wish, and hope. Kudos!
B000002UKS|5.0|I've been a long time fan of Foo Fighters (since around 1995), and out of all the CD's that they have released as of 2003, The Colour and the Shape has proved to be the best one of all.  Whoever said that in order for something to be catchy, it has to be cliche obviously missed the purchase of this album.  Every song hooks you, and unlike most new rock bands, the hook isn't cheesy, overdone, or stolen from someone else.  This CD blends the best of the old with the best of the new, giving hard rockers a delightful CD to rock out to (Monkey Wrench, Hey Johnny Park, My Poor Brain, Wind Up, My Hero, Enough Space, Everlong, New Way Home), and the fans of the new mellow sound of Foo Fighters a few songs to sit back and relax to (Doll, February Stars, Walking After You, See You, Up In Arms).  Here are my reviews for the individual tracks:<br />DOLL (A)--The shortest song on the album, but probably the most overlooked.  While it doesn't really feel like it belongs on the album, if it were taken off, the album would lose a great introductory song.  A great short ballad.<br />MONKEY WRENCH (A+)--If you've been listening to the radio at all since 1997, you've probably heard this song.  The first single off of the album, this song hooked listeners with it's catchy verses and chorus.  Great proof that a song can have catchy verses and chorus.  The song's style is similar to that of \\"All My Life\\" (One By One), it's more upbeat, a little less dark, and a little more fun.  Great song to listen to when you're flying down the expressway in the summer with all the window's down.<br />HEY, JOHNNY PARK! (A+)--This song is a bit slower than the rest of the songs on the album, but it rocks.  With it's hard rock intro, to the transition to a very soft guitar part, highlighting a very vulnerable, yet confident sounding Dave Grohl, this song will send you on a rollercoaster that is Dave Grohl's subconscience.  I get goosebumps when Dave screams at the end of the song: \\"Now that I've found myreward, I'd throw it away long before I'd share a piece of mine with you.\\"<br />MY POOR BRAIN  (A+)--The intro to this song will throw you.  It's confusing, loud, almost obnoxious, and right when you're about to skip to track 5, the noise ceases and all that's left is a very tight and simple drum beat, with a quieted simple guitar line.  It remains somewhat quiet with a slightly uneasy feel to it, until the distortion pedal is hit, bringing all of the hard rock that the Foo's could muster up to a tremendous climactic chorus.<br />WIND UP (A)--Your typical hard rock song, with your untypical typicalness that is Foo Fighters.  Hard all the way through, good til the last note.<br />UP IN ARMS (A+)--This song starts off nice and mellow, bringing to your ears a very 60's sounding guitar, drum, and base line.  The intro ends about 50 seconds into the song, with it's last chord ringing out.  Then the drums kick you in the [...] and your pushed into a fantastic poppy love song.  A Foo Fighters classic.<br />MY HERO (A)--Probably the Foo Fighters most overplayed tune on the radio, you had to have been born yesterday to not have ever heard this song before.<br />SEE YOU (A)--This song has a very jazzy feel to it, and is done with an acoustic guitar with a drum-line that is so recessive, that the Foo's released an \\"acoustic-only\\" version of this song as a B-Side.  You can't help but snap your fingers or clap your hands to this one.<br />ENOUGH SPACE (B+)--An overpowering song that is riding the thin line between hard rock and metal.  Second only to the song \\"The Colour and the Shape\\" (also released as a B-Side) as far as hard rocking goes, this song is the perfect song for a crappy day.<br />FEBRUARY STARS (A+)--A very interesting transition from the hardest song on the album to the softest song on the album.  This song is an amazing love ballad that soothes you throughout, and has a great build-up at the end which tips its hat to the power ballads of the 80's.<br />EVERLONG(A+++)--This is Foo Fighters best song ever written.  A very dreamy hard rock song that sends chills up my spine every time I hear it.  This song has been my favorite song of all time since I heard it the very first time.  It's hard to find anyone that doesn't like this song, whether they are a fan of Foo Fighters or not.<br />WALKING AFTER YOU (A)--The remix of this song was released as a single, and can be found on the X-Files movie soundtrack.  The version of the song on this album, though, is done acoustically with percussion (not a drum kit).  In my opinion, the original version of the song that appears on this album sounds much better than the remix that was the 4th single to be released from this album.  This song has amazing lyrics, that show just how bittersweet love can be.<br />NEW WAY HOME (A+++)--If there's one thing that Foo Fighters do well, it's composing an earth-shattering song to close each and every one of their albums with.  This song has a build in it that is similar to that of \\"Come Back\\" (One By One), except this song rocks so much harder at the end, but it isn't really a hard rock sound...it's more of a very loud pop/rock ending, that just makes you want to jump around.  This song is the Foo's best closer, and in my opinion is an even better closer than \\"Exhausted\\" (Foo Fighters).<br />BUY THIS ALBUM, OR MISS OUT ON THE BEST ROCK ALBUM OF THE 1990'S
B000001FOL|4.0|To differ from the opinion of &quot;Magic Hat&quot; above, movie soundtracks are an excellent way to discover new music and artists that you may not have considered before.  Who cares if some music listeners trivialize music found on lbums like &quot;Chelsea Girl?&quot;  Every person connects with music that they like on their own personal level.  Nobody gets the same messages out of the same song.  Therefore it is an elitist opinion to say that it is wrong for movie soundtracks to contain cool, obscure music.  &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot; soundtrack made me want to find out more about Nico, which I have--and have thoroughly enjoyed.  Besides, I tend to think that anyone who would take the time to look for and enjoy an album like &quot;Chelsea Girl&quot; is probably NOT the type to take any kind of music for granted.  The album is excellent, buy it.  If you have time, check out &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot; and &quot;Rushmore&quot; soundtracks.  &quot;Rushmore&quot; has some good Kinks and Cat Stephens, while &quot;Royal T&quot; has some excellent Dylan, Clash, and the Ramones (as well as Nico).  Both soundtracks also have some of my personal fave, John Lennon.
B000002H70|5.0|This album is both accesible and perplexing. Robert Smith's romantic lyrics, and the band's radio-friendly (for a 'goth' band anyway) sound is mixed with epic-length songs about gloom and heartbreak, and songs that develop as time goes on, rather than the most obvious and cliched of love songs. <BR><br />The songs are intoxicating and passionate, and to an extent, dark, but you can dance to it as well. In fact &quot;Lovesong&quot; was a #2 single. Though many songs can bring tears to your eyes due to the heavy emotions layered in the guitar textures and Smith's forlorn vocal style, or the mere fact that the composition of the songs is so beautiful and at the same time haunting. Is that a negative? No. This is one of the most resonant albums of the late 80s, an era with too few of them
0066214122|5.0|I have read most of Michael Crichton's books and this one does not fail to live up to my standards. When you read one of his books and then go back and read a normal book by a different author, you recognize how good his writing really is. He pulls you in with his primary character, Jack Forman, and the book moves along at a great pace. I finished it in one sitting and the only bad thing about it was that it had to end. I recommend this to anyone as long as they are able to assimilate new ideas and technology.
0066214122|3.0|Not Crichton's best, but okay.  A bit repetitive in some place.  C+
B00006M183|4.0|In some ways, Riot Act is the album that Pearl Jam has been wanting to make since Vitalogy - a muscular art-rock record, one that still hits hard but one that is filled with ragged edges and odd detours. Vitalogy found the band sketching out their ideas for their brand of artsy rock, separating bracing hard rock and experimentalism throughout that fascinating album, and since then they bounced between those two extremes: indulging themselves on No Code, overcompensating with the streamlined Yield. Here, they manage to seamlessly blend the two impulses together, in a restless, passionate record that delivers musically and emotionally. If it doesn't announce itself as a comeback, or a great step forward, it's because the changes are subtle - it's a process of their post-Vitalogy sound finally gelling, not making an artistic breakthrough. Given the appealing but haphazard nature of their late '90s work, it's quite satisfying to have a Pearl Jam album play as strongly as Riot Act, and again some credit again must be given to drummer Matt Cameron. He enlivened 2000's Binaural, but his forceful drumming gives the weirder songs and ambitions support and urgency. Also, the production is the best in nearly a decade - a warm, burnished sound, filled with details that enhance the basic song instead of overwhelming them (in other words, it's not No Code, nor is it the Spartan Yield. Again, these are subtle shifts in sound, but they are notable and, given several plays, this does indeed seem like the richest record Pearl Jam has made in a long time. - Stephen Thomas Erlewine
B00006JDVV|5.0|When I first saw this film, i knew i had to get it when it came out. Dragons fighting man in modern day, what more do you want. action, detailed story and even some humor. This film is one of the best ever, and I was surprised to know that it was based around the uk.
B00003CX9W|1.0|Please becareful when buying this DVD.  The package say it's uncut but it really isn't.  Disney felt they needed to censor some scenes because they might offend some black people.  I'm a black person and I'm more offended by Disney lying to me then the scenes.  I hope someday in the future Disney will think I'm mature enough to own a real uncut version.
B00005JKZT|5.0|My challenged english teacher encompassed our class with the book, The Fellowship of the Ring. She also wanted us to see the movie, The Fellowship of the Ring. She was taking us to see The Two Towers. I really didn't enjoy the book. The movie was okay. Then when I went to see The Two Towers. I LOVED the movie. I had to go back and see the movie again! I can not wait until it comes out on DVD. The movie encouraged me to read the book. So far I like the book better than the movie, but I still love the movie. The only problems that I may have with the movie is that the Elves never came to Helms Deep and Aragorn never floated down a river. I still love the movie! I can't wait until the Return of the King comes out!
0060537639|5.0|Gavin Menzes spent his life in the British navy, retiring as a submarine captain who journeyed the same courses set by the fifteenth century Chinese in their treasure fleets.  Unlike others, I believe his theory about these treasure fleets predating by centuries the European \\"discoveries\\" of the Americas, Antartica and Australia.  I believe that we in the West are guilty of very stupid Eurocentrism by continuing to maintain in the face of worldwide evidence to the contrary the Columbus and Cook myth of initial \\"discovery\\".<br />I fully admit that I can't read a navigation chart, have no firsthand knowledge of sailing and wouldn't know which end of a sextant is which but his extraordinary amassing of hard evidence is, to my mind, irrefutable and as such he has written a mamothly explosive book!<br />The question that should haunt the reader through Menzie's unfolding tale is why we weren't told earlier-why did I spend so many years drinking at the fountain of English, Spanish, Dutch and Portugese \\"discovery\\" and the answer seems to be that, as Menzies accurately points out, nobody has had the practical knowledge of ancient map reading to formulate an alternative theory.  Historians of course have tremendous literary skills but how many historians can read and interpret ancient navigation charts?  The information in this book has always been there but nobody put the scattered pieces together.  Menzies' greatness is that he had the knowledge to gather, what to others were unimportant pieces of trivia, and out of that mess to form a truly revolutionary story-at least to my clouded Western eyes.<br />Regardless of my poor ability to write a decent comment you owe it to yourself to read this fabulous book-it will confound you, interest you and eventually excite you as few other books ever have.
0060278250|5.0|\\"I'll sing you a song of the long ago -<BR>Seven shine the shiners, oh!<BR>What did the Seven do way back when?<BR>Why, they wove the Charter then!<BR>Five for the warp, from beginning to end.<BR>Two for the woof, to make and mend.<BR>That's the seven, but what of the Nine -<BR>What of the two who chose not to shine?<BR>The Eighth did hide, hide all away,<BR>But the Seven caught him and made him pay.<BR>The Ninth was strong and fought with might,<BR>But lone Orannis was put out of the light,<BR>Broken in two and buried under hill,<BR>Forever to lie there, wishing us ill.\\"<br />So ends Lirael: Daughter of the Clayr, providing a rare bit of insight into the making of the Charter, and setting the stage for Abhorsen.  As the third part of the story unfolds, the King Touchstone and his Abhorsen Queen Sabriel, of the Old Kingdom, are in Ancelstierre. They are frantically attempting to keep the Ancelstierrans from sending hundreds of thousands of Southerlings (fleeing from civil war in their own country) across the border into the Old Kingdom, where they could fall prey to who knows what Greater Dead Adept or Free Magic necromancer.  Their daughter Ellimere, heir to the throne, is at home in Belisaere, acting as regent and trying to keep her country in order while her parents do their part for the same cause.  And, their son Sameth, has recently discovered that he is not the Abhorsen-in-Waiting, but that his aunt Lirael, daughter of the former Abhorsen and a woman of the Clayr, is.  He and his newly-discovered aunt are hiding in the Abhorsen's house while the Dead beset them on all sides.  And, to top it all off, Nicholas Sayre, childhood friend of Sameth's from Ancelstierre, is unwittingly digging up the one thing that could destroy the world: Orannis, the Ninth.  Together, Sam and Lirael must rescue Nick and avoid the evil clutches of Hedge the necromancer and his flunkie Chlorr of the Mask, all while trying to keep the two halves of Orannis separate so that the Destroyer will not ride again.  It's a pitched battle for the fate of the world, and once again, Garth Nix does not disappoint in his storytelling.
B00004VWA7|5.0|Jaco Pastorius was undoubtedly a brilliant musician, in every sense of the word.  Not only was he an incredible bassist, but he was a gifted composer, who really knew how to get the most out of his instrument.  This, his first solo album, is excellent from start to finish.  There's plenty of diversity here, and a regular who's who of musicians backing him up.  The list includes David Sanborn, Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, and many more.  There are three drummers on here, Bobby Economou, Narada Michael Walden, and Lenny White.  All three put on a great performance, but Lenny's is undoubtedly the most impressive.<br />As I mentioned before, this album is very diverse.  There are two bass solo songs (only bass).  The first, &quot;Donna Lee&quot;, is the opening track, and is a prime example of Jaco's incredible prowess.  The second, &quot;Portrait of Tracy&quot;, is more laid-back, and shows that in addition to being a technical virtuoso, he had a great sense of melody as well.  &quot;Come On, Come Over&quot; has more of a 70's funk feel, and is the only song on the album to feature vocals.  &quot;Opus Pocus&quot; is a bit unusual, with odd complex bass work, and some cool steel drums to give it a bit of a tropical feel.  &quot;Forgotten Love&quot; doesn't even have Jaco on it, and is perhaps the least interesting track here, but still a nice tranquil piano piece.  &quot;6/4 Jam&quot; is a bit repetitive, but Lenny's jaw-dropping performance makes up for it.<br />The best songs, without a doubt, are &quot;Kuru/Speak Like a Child&quot; and &quot;Used To Be a Cha Cha&quot;.  Both feature some very fast and infectious basslines, and incredible piano from the great Herbie Hancock.  Very technical and diverse songs, with great melody as well.  At around 8 minutes each, both go by quite fast.<br />So there you have it, an excellent album from one of the best bassists of all time.  Highly recommended to anyone with even the slightest interest in jazz.  I haven't heard quite enough to say this accurately, but this is possibly one of the best albums of the genre.  Definitely a must-have.enough to say this accurately, but this is possibly one of the best albums of the genre.  Definitely a must-have.

B000066NW0|5.0|I got this cd for Christmas after listening (and loving) to the songs &quot;Complicated&quot; and &quot;Sk8ter Boi&quot; on the radio.I couldn't be more pleased. I like this cd's complete rock content, without a trace of pop. I especially like the fact that Avril Lavigne's songs aren't all based on the subject of loving guys or breaking up with guys.  I find that the songs that I like the most are the ones just about living life to the fullest you possibly can.  My favorite song is probably &quot;Anything But Ordinary&quot;, in which she sings of how she doesn't want to live a normal life and how everyone should enjoy life.  I think that Avril Lavigne has a strong spunky attitude and voice that will get her a few more albums.  <br />~A Music Fan
B00005OAIE|5.0|John is amazing.  I too fell in love with him well before he became mainstream.  The man is so talented.  I give him props for writing his own music and actually playing his instrument.  I have had the chance to see him in concert twice and it was without a doubt some of the best shows that I have ever attended.  His songs are very heartfelt, and it is easy to see where he is coming from.  He does not sound like a carbon copy of anyone.  You will hear his influnences in his music, but that is because they are just that, an influence.  If you have respect for the true singer songwriter then this is the album for you.
B00005JLSC|2.0|I really don't understand all the hype about this movie. I am a personal fan of musicals, so its not the genre that bothered me. It is an entertainig and well executed movie, but not much beyond that. It sort of tricks you into thinking that its a good movie when really its quite flat. It has no message or theme, and you can't really come to care about the characters. 20 minutes after I had left the theater I had forgotten all about the movie, definitely a sign of a bad movie.
6305922756|5.0|The movie itself is great.  It's a biting satire on the rock and roll industry, circa 1984 at which point it was pretty lifeless and brain dead.  It features three gifted comic actors who are, in understated and clever ways, as funny as anyone on the planet.<br />The second great thing about this DVD is the extra footage.  Clearly Reiner could have assembled a very funny 120-minute cut using some of this footage and also more footage from the four videos which are included on this DVD and are also very funny.  He went with a lean 83-minute cut instead, which maintained focus on the storyline, but any fan of the movie will want to see some of the unused stuff - more of every character.<br />The third way in which this is great is in providing an extra audio track in which the three principal members of Tap speak, in character (as always) about their memories of the film and the ways in which their ex-manager and director Marty DeBergi screwed them.  Three funny people, fully in character, improvising and bouncing off each other's ideas on the spot.  That's what they did in making this film, and to hear them doing it again years later on a seperate audio track is a joy.
0553381709|5.0|Martin has a wholly different writing style than any fantasy writer i have ever read.  This book is incredible - the best so far of the series.  Each book gets better and better with more intrigue, twists, and surprises.<br />It is safe to say this series is not for everyone - if dark fiction, violence, language, or sexuality bothers you, you might want to pass.<br />That being said, there are times i have almost dropped this book on the floor in shock.  Martin takes the story in so many unexpected directions that nothing is predictable.  The Red Wedding is probably the biggest surprise in this book, and i still get chills just thinking about it.  As i read this book, i reread several of the chapters over again after finishing them just so i could take it all in again.<br />i can't say enough about Martin - but i would hate to live in his universe :)<br />If you can stomach it, get this book/series.  Drop what you are reading, and pick up Game of Thrones.  You won't be sorry.
B000002TYK|5.0|Dave Grohls song writing is so creative and catchy. This album is so catchy and creative just like all their albums. The guitar is excellent , the bassist,Nate Mendel, is amazing, and Taylor Hawkins,the drummer sounds like Dave Grohl when he was with Nirvana. This CD sounds almost identical or even better than Nirvana,Daves old band. Grohl took  Kurt Kobians skills, sorry about the spelling, and brought them to another level. In this album Grohl wrote just the right amount of wild songs like WEENIE BEENIE and the right amount of slow songs such as BIG ME. You will love it !
B00006F7XJ|3.0|seeing Camel in concert in San Francisco a couple of years ago (about 24 years since I last saw them!) renewed my interest in the band (I had forgotten them after Breathless, but still kept playing my vinyl copy of Moonmadness - the BEST!)<br />Anyway, the reviews of this CD got me intrigued enough to take a chance.... with mixed results.<br />The music is Camel at full strength, however there are times when the band leaves a melody way too soon - particularly the soaring guitar on the title track which could go on for the rest of the CD in my mind!<br />My problem is with the lyrics (probably not a major factor with some Camel fans) which are extremely lame, uninspiring and bordering on childish at times - \\"Fox Hill\\" is the major culprit here.<br />I'll still check out some other later releases (Rajaj maybe), but for now I'm enjoying the re-issues of their classics!
0385503954|1.0|This novel reads like an exercise in a creative writing class.  Its a concept more than a real story.  The characters are flat, the story is implausible and it just keeps going on and on and on.  It maybe could have worked as a short story.
B000002UEB|5.0|This album is easily my favorite album of all time and quite possibly the best album ever written. It tells the story of Nikki, a young heroin addict who contracts hits for a communist revolutionary named Dr. X in exchange for heroin and falls in love with Mary, a former prostitute turned nun. I won't spoil the rest, but the story is gripping and touching and full of true romance, not like the drivel that hollywood puts out these days.<BR>However, that is just the story, the music it's self is laiden with catchy melodies, memorable guitar riffs and fantastic rhythms. The music fits the story and enhances the mood. The only problem I have with the album is that occasionally the songs are a bit poppy and that sometimes the guitar gets buried in the production.<BR>If you've only heard Queensryche on the radio (Empire), then the best way to compare this is to say that this is heavier and more full of leads and operatic vocals. It's a true must have album for fans of melodic heavy metal from the 80s.
B000066NW0|5.0|I think this is a pretty amazing debut album for a 17 year old (or so) girl and showcases her pretty amazing talent. Her mixture of some hard rock/punk music with beautiful and catchy vocals works very well. That her lyrics are not significantly profound for an adult reviewer reflects the fact that is difficult to remember the deep concerns of teenage kids- how they fit in with the world, how to behave, being honest with yourself and others, making it real, learning about love, etc. Her lyrics express these issues honestly without a lot of pretense. There are a few great songs/hits in the first few cuts and some good songs later. I think this is the beginning of something BIG! She's kinda cute, too.
B00003CXS4|5.0|Thank goodness for Guy Ritchie. He has pumped some life back into this genre of films.  The Brits are hysterical and so witty. The delivery is fast, every time I watch it I pick up on a line I missed before. Brad Pitt did an outright amazing job in this movie. Makes you love them Pikeys! And is it possible to create a scarier looking bad guy than the Larry King look-a-like who keeps violent pigs? Do you remember him from Lock Stock?   The filming and musical score are also premium. I all around suggest this movie for those who are looking for something new, and sick of the typical gangster American movies. Not for the sensitive and faint-hearted.
B00005JLRR|3.0|This is another ST:TNG episode write large, and unfortunately it's not one of the better ones. There is a bit too much action and the moral of the story is kind of clunky. The opening in the Romulan senate is kind of interesting, but you don't feel that you're penetrating deep into the heart of the Romulan empire the way we've seen the workings of the Klingon empire in the past. Shinzon, Picard's clone, is a single note character, and it's distressing that his mouth looks so different from Patrick Stewart's. Since he's supposedly ill that must be the explanation. Meanwhile Ron Perlman plays Shinzon's \\"Reman\\" vice-roy, but he's got so much make-up on you wouldn't know it was him. His main role is to make one of those psychic sexual attacks against Deanna Troi, can't have a TNG movie without one of those. She meanwhile is marrying Riker. I missed the part where she broke up with Worf, and for all the jokes about nudity at her Betazed wedding, her mother is not even at the earthly wedding. (It's also ironic that Riker's doppelganger, Thom, isn't mentioned in a movie that's essentially about clones.) Kate Mulgrew makes a cameo as Janeway; she's an Admiral now no less. Again, I have no idea how she got from Captain of a lesser class vessel to Admiral, but she's there. This movie made me feel like I paid too much attention to the series and not enough. It pushes a lot of buttons, and it's pretty mediocre, but it is Trek .
0316666343|4.0|This was a truly amazing book. I couldn't put it down. It was well written and kept me guessing. this is on my top list of books. i invite you all to read this book, you won't be disappointed.
0060278250|5.0|\\"Sabriel\\" and \\"Lirael\\" are my two favorite books of all time. Now, \\"Abhorsen\\" joins them right at the top. Abhorsen continues the story written in Lirael, following Sam and Lirael, the new Abhorsen-in-Waiting, on adventures throughout the Old Kingdom and Anclessteire. This is no adventure though. They are on a mission to stop a most powerful being from being unleashed upon the world. The return of many chracters are brought here, including Sabriel, Touchstone, Ellimere, The Clayr, the hideously funny Disreputable Dog and Mogget, among others. I applaud Garth Nix on this excellent piece of work. It ties the series together nicely, but we would all still be very gracious for another one. Scratch that- we NEED another one!!!
B000069CWE|1.0|the first album from linkin park was almost rock. i actually baught it but now with there new one......Ahh its horible... its like rap with [...] and wannaB limp bizkit and other stuff.. it is really bad.
0395645662|5.0|It was my child's assignment to read this book but as I was just listening to her read it, I got hooked and had to finish it off by myself! It was excellent and I could not put it down! What a great way to open up one's mind to a different way of life. Things are NOT always as they appear to us when we look from an entirely different perspective! What an important lesson for our children and ourselves (parents) to realize. Jonas had a DREAM of freedom and he was able to attain it against all odds! We CAN to ANYTHING if we believe in our HEARTS and want it bad enough! Pick a terrific DREAM for you life and you CAN do it.<BR>If you are looking for something really practical and a very different way of seeing life by creating everything you want right now WHAT EVER you would like (gold medal in gymnastics, horseback riding lessons, turtle, nute, dog, my children's creations...) try \\"The One Minute Guide to Prosperity and Enlightenment\\" by Sri Siva. You will need a very open mind for this one because one of the governing criteria is that your life will NOT have any suffering or anything negative in it. It's a great way for children to create the life they want without bringing along all the garbage us adults have! and... it only takes a minute!!!
B000002HB4|4.0|When the Georgia Satellites blasted out of Duran Duran world in late '86 with a killer hit called &quot;Keep Your Hands To Yourself,&quot; we knew real American rock &amp; roll wasn't quite dead yet...Though they were never again able to match the massive chart success of that great song, they do not deserve to be dismissed as a &quot;one-hit wonder.&quot; &quot;Battleship Chains&quot; and their remake of The Swinging Blue Jeans' (you remember them, don't you?) &quot;Hippy Hippy Shake&quot; (for the otherwise forgettable Tom Cruise movie &quot;Cocktail&quot;) both were minor hits, and their recorded output over three albums was a non-stop barrage of bar-room classics comprised of clever lyrics, blue-collar attitude and crunching guitars. This is just great stuff from start to finish and the 20 tracks on this collection are an excellent representation of this band and its sound. Standout tracks include &quot;Don't Pass Me By&quot; (a Ringo Starr tune!), &quot;Mon Cheri,&quot; &quot;I Dunno,&quot; &quot;Hard Luck Boy&quot; and &quot;Dan Takes Five.&quot; Many of the songs were written by group leader Dan Baird, who has gone on to do solo work (Love Songs For The Hearing Impaired is a minor classic), produce other artists (Blue Mountain) and join up with Eric &quot;Roscoe&quot; Ambel and others to form The Yayhoos. Highly recommended.
B00006CXSS|5.0|&quot;A reviewer&quot; a handful of reviews down give this series a 3/5 and calls is entertaining and not that great...I am all for an objective opinion, but this person seems to reference Titanic and the all too common claims of &quot;pro-American&quot; and 'patriotic&quot; themes when it comes to war movies, with this falling into that category.  Ignore that person.  Some people like to hear themselves talk and pretend they are some prophet of critiquing movies.  This is one of, if not the best movie ever made for many reasons.
B00006RIO7|5.0|The first thing I said when this movie ended was that I had to go buy the soundtrack.  Then I had to wait 4 whole days for the soundtrack to be released!  I was not happy, but I am now!  The movie was fabulous and the soundtrack recalls all the music that made it great.  I am amazed at what great voices Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellweger and Richard Gere have.  Who knew any of them could sing this well???  Queen Latifah's &quot;When You're Good To Mama&quot; is a highlight of both the movie and the soundtrack.  But it's difficult to single out just one or a few songs to listen to because they all deserve equal playing time.<br />My advice?  Run, don't walk to your nearest theatre to see this movie, then run, don't walk to your nearest music store and buy this CD!  Trust me, you'll thank me later.
B0000025AI|5.0|This is my all time favorite Johnny Winter recording and my favorite blues recording.His raunchy voice and rockin' guitar licks make this a five star sound for sure.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I think what makes this cd 5 stars is the fact that her original material EQUALS the classic covers that are featured on the cd. Her songs &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; and &quot;Come Away with Me&quot; are probably two of the best songs recorded in the past year, if not the past decade. Let's just leave it at this: This is probably the best cd of 2002 and it's also the only one that will endure the test of time and become a classic. The only difficult task is going to be trying to follow-up such a brilliant album.
B000005846|4.0|Bolt Thrower are pretty much second tier death metal... they've been around forever yet they never get the recognition of say... Carcass. Still, England's history channel fanatics can play some solid death metal and For Victory is straight up brutal. Like whoa. First time I heard Remembrance I was pinned down to the wall. By the time it was over I had whiplash. That song has the heaviest riff EVER penned, and sets the tone for a solid 37 minutes of metal.<br />Bolt Thrower's style in a nutshell.... heavy as brick riffs over monotonous drums, with fierce growls and the occasional doom break. Indeed, BT's drummer [lacks talent] , and doesn't do much in the way of pacing. Sometimes the tedium of hearing the same song over and over grows old, but standouts like Forever Fallen and slower paced ...For Victory make up for it.<br />If you like to bang yer head, and do it well, get this CD. It's heavier than hades and has the perfect tempo for nonstop thrashing. I dunno if I'd place it in the death metal classic field, but you could do farrrrrr worse.... recommended for fans of DM in general.
B00006RAKP|4.0|Disc one is classic Elton, however its missing one song. <BR>Ive seen him play it at every concert Ive ever seen and its<BR>considered one of the top 10 all time Rock and Roll songs. <BR>I cant believe he missed it. Why?<br />Funeral For a Friend/Loves Lies Bleeding...  <br />He has no better song. Its an emotional song that<BR>makes you wish you were on stage jamming with him. <BR>Its too bad it aint on here because in my opinion<BR>its his best.
B000000H66|5.0|I love all of Death's albums, especially their '90's ones, but I think \\"Symbolic\\" is clearly the band's masterpiece.  Death's last four albums all represented an effort to inject progressive tendencies into extreme metal, and here is where they nailed it the best.  More than any of their other albums, this one contains everything that made Chuck Schuldiner and his ever-changing band so great: unbridled creativity, complex arrangements, awe-inspiring technicality, Chuck's distinctive death vocals, and time changes that Nostradamus would have had trouble predicting.  Perhaps most importantly, \\"Symbolic\\" was the culmination of Chuck's songwriting evolution.  In spite of all the heaviness and technicality, these songs all maintained a strong groove, effortessly flowing from one passage to another.  I can't think of another album, with the possible exception of Carcass's \\"Heartwork\\" and a few Opeth albums, that has balanced heaviness, creativity, and intricacy as well as \\"Symbolic.\\"
B00005A8GY|1.0|I MUST AGREE WITH JAMES CROAK THIS IS THE WORST I HAVE HEARD. I MUST SAY IT SOUNDS SO BAD IT IS TIED WITH BOB DYLANS &quot;BLOOD ON THE TRACKS&quot; THAT WAS ALSO RUINED WHEN THEY PUT IT ON CD, AT LEAST BLOOD ON THE TRACKS DID NOT COST THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT IS ASKED FOR THIS PIECE OF JUNK.<BR> I TRIED 2 DIFFERENT SACD PLAYERS BEFORE I REALIZED IT WAS THE CD ITSELF.I THINK IT IS ALSO ON DVD AUDIO OR DTS CD. I HOPE THEY DID BETTER THAN THIS.
0571063896|3.0|I thoroughly recommend this book to anyone wishing to enter the world of card magic. It teaches you right from the basics through to some VERY impressive tricks.<BR>I was so glad to start my magical journey with the Royal Road to Card Magic by Jean Hugard &amp; Frederick Braue
0060278269|5.0|Lireal was once a second assistant librarian and the daughter of the clayr but she isn't anymore. She has found out that she is destined to be the Abhorsen, a necromancer who serves the charter in keeping the dead away from life, in a most inconvenient time. An evil necromancer named Hedge, with the help of another necromancer named Chlorr who ha been dead for years, has been working hard on bringing back an evil of epic proportions and it looks like he might suceed. And because Lireal is the only possible Abhorsen in the Old Kingdom, it's up to her to stop him from raising this evil. But she isn't alone. She is working with Prince Sameth of the Old Kingdom, a wallmaker; Mogget, a servant to the Abhorsen in cat shape who's history is much more dark than anyone would expect; and the Disreputable Dog, her dear friend. But even they cannot stop Hedge alone for Hedge is working with Nick, a friend of Sam's who is unknowingly assisting a great evil in more ways than one.<br />I loved this book. I was in a state of shock after reading it because it was this book. The character development is superb. Lireal continues to grow from the scared 14 year old we saw in Lireal and Sam finally accepts his responsibility as a Prince and a wallmaker. You finally find out all of the secrets that Garth Nix has been hinting about for the past two book. All the questions are answered including, how is Dog connected to the seven and, most importantly, who really is Mogget?  This is truly an astounding book. It has a sort of epic feel to it that the last two book lasts. The \\"big bad\\" has an aura around it that reminds me much of Sauron from Lord of the Rings or  from Philip Phullman's big bad from His Dark Materials.<br />Even though this is the final book in the trilogy I truly hope that Garth Nix decides on visiting the worlds of the Old Kingdom, even if it doesn't involve the characters in this book. Garth Nix has created what many fantasy authors often strive to do but fail, an original, believable world.
6305603847|5.0|This is a great movie. Okay, maybe not for everyone, but I loved it. It adds a great deal of substance to the already fantastic &quot;soundtrack&quot;. We get to see more of what the group, especially Roger Waters, really wanted to be portrayed. The extras provide good information and bring up some of the bad feelings behind-the-scenes (which finally resulted in Waters leaving the band). The quality is very professional and the transfer is very good. The camera angles are varying and keep your interest. The plot, while thin, is about what should be expected from a day-in-the-life-of-a-rock-star flick. If you love rock-and-roll, this is one of a handful of films that you should see.
0316666343|3.0|I got this book because I had heard such good reviews I couldn't wait to read it. Boy was I disappointed! When you read a book dealing with the death of a child you expect to read it with a box of kleenex in tow, but the character development was so poor I found myself not caring about any of the characters. You never get into the heads of any of them. The first 50 pages were a very fast read but then it goes on for another 250 where nothing much happens and the killer never gets caught. I had a hard time finishing it. It was an ok read but not anything I would recommend that's for sure.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|Back in the early 80's, Trevor Horn produced an album of songs that were intended to primarily appeal to the masochist sub-genre of the gay community. But the songs contained enough hooks, and the adverse publicity that the videos aroused turned out to be spectacularly more successful than anyone could have hoped. Becasue just when the song was hitting its stride, it was banned on the BBC. Naturally, sales went thru the roof.<br />The band was Frankie Goes To Hollywood, and the banned song was \\"Relax\\". Since then, FGTH imploded (after really only one album) but the song (and in the UK the follow-up tracks \\"Two Tribes\\" and \\"The Power Of Love\\") are still anthems.<br />Twenty years on, Trevor Horn, who has also produced Yes, Band-Aid, and Seal, is at it again. But now, to appeal to the larger, and hence more profitable US audience, he has taken a different path.<br />Now instead of gay men, he is producing an album by gay women. Not real lesbians, of course, but the idealized male-fantasy thereof. Young, gorgeous, and uninhibited. \\"Penthouse\\"-lesbian, without the closeups. And just to add to the appeal, teenagers just barely in the realm of legality.<br />It's a brilliant marketing strategy. You can guaranteed there'll be free news-making protesters, public CD burnings, speechs by fundamentalists, all playing right into the hands of the record company.<br />Because the protesters aren't the ones who buy this type of music anyhow.<br />This album will appeal to three groups: 1) Teenage boys, who are erotically enthralled, 2) Left-leaning politically correct people of all ages and sexes as a way to protest the protesters (and who may well be a little erotically enthralled too), and 3) People who actually like the songs.<br />Put yourself in the third category, if it helps. But consider: Just how many other albums have you bought where half the tracks are in a language you can't speak a single word of?<br />Marketing & media manipulation: 5 stars.<br />Music: 3 stars.
0425166805|5.0|Chariots of the Gods is full of amazing facts and evidence that I don't understand how can be overlooked. The book talks mainly about the ancient &quot;runways&quot; that gods may have used to land their spacecrafts thousands of years ago. <BR>There is also evidence showing ancient, thousand year old power sources containing compounds foreign to the earth. The book also talks about how in countries such as Peru and New Zealand there are cave drawings on the walls depicting ancient astronauts/visitors, and maybe that our entire belief system is based around an alien species that visited earth thousands of years ago.<br />                                        -Hans
B000069HKH|5.0|In one word, excellent.  The 9-11 theme runs throughout this CD but in a way which just seems to fit so right.  I can't imagine many artists that could have done this.  Even taken out of context (9-11) this CD is excellent.  Throw in the fact that it is written about such a horrific event and this CD is purely a must for anyone.
1563890119|1.0|I bought Sandman number one when it originally came out and although the story was well done it didn't impress me enough to continue buying the comic. Years later Sandman became quite  popular and the buzz comic to read. After having friends who followed it and after telling me how great it was I decided to buy the collected first volume and was pretty confident I would become a fan from all the praise the book had been given. I was even looking forward to perhaps continuing to buy volume after volume of Sandman as I was looking for a lengthy series to get into. When I read Preludes and Noctures I was extremely disappointed by the quality of it overall. The first story was still as interesting as I remembered it but nothing beyond that gave me any enjoyment at all. The stories are very fragmented and don't follow any real pattern. They just exist on their own and the Sandman character seems to just wander in and out of the plots without making any sense. It would not be so bad if the issues were interesting in and of themselves, but they are not. The art is also nothing too spectacular as this is early Sam Keith, his later stuff is much much better. Add to this some guest stars that have nothing to do with the story and serve to dismember the plot even more. Members of the Justice League are very out of place in a comic like this that is not a superhero book at all. Sandman is well loved by many but whatever it is that makes him special is nowhere to be found in this collection. I won't be buying any future volumes for fear of being as disappointed as I was with this, I rather keep my money. If you are looking for a good Neil Gaiman book I would recommend Stardust instead. That one I liked very much.
B00006BTCA|5.0|This is music this is so well put together that you can find something luscious and new everytime you hear it.  The guitar player has his own style, he doenst rely on chords so much as parts of chords.  His sence of composition and design is original and refreshing.  The drummer choses his rhythms perfectly and also has an astounding sence of composition and arraingment.  The singer's delivery is awesome and his lyrics are beuitifully vague at times yet not completely abstract.  The bass player blends harmonies with the guitar and creates bleak and original sound colors.  The production is right on.  About half of the songs make my skin tingle and the other half are just good.  <br />Spend some time with this CD and you will be impressed...if you are looking for some decent songs that can push some limits.
B00005JL2O|1.0|I rented this movie, before I would buy it, and boy, I am sure glad I did.  This movie was terrible.   This movie sucked.<br />Even though there was a surprise ending, the rest of the movie just was no where near the calibre of the first two.<br />In conclusion, don't buy this.  Rent it.  Pay the 4 bucks to rent it, instead of the 20 bucks to buy it.  You'll appreciate it.
B00005NTNM|4.0|While not as entertaining as the original Dirty Harry, (what could be?) The Enforcer for me was the reason you went to see Rated R Movies in the first place, violence, dirty language, a touch of skin and oh yeah, violence, whether Harry is driving a car through a store window or chasing a perp across the rooftops of San Francisco, the Enforcer doesn't disappoint. Tyne Daly puts in a solid performance as Harry's uncertain yet unwavering partner who gains not only her own confidence as the story devellops, but his as well. The enforcer also anticipates political correctness almost twenty years before that plague decended on us all.
B00005JLSC|4.0|I saw this movie and I really liked it.  I was skeptical at first, especially about Richard Gere and Renee Zelleweger, but I was pleasently surprised.  While Renee is no Gwen Verdon, and seemed just a tad miscast, I think she did okay.  I was very pleased with Richard Gere, who I think had a great voice, something along the lines of a twenties or thirties radio personality.  And he did his own tapping, with no tap track! (I checked.).  Catherine Zeta-Jones and Queen Latifa kicked ....  \\"It looked like Queen Latifa stole Renee's bust...\\"  so says one of my friends about the costumes.<BR>Even if you're a purist, this is a pretty good version of Chicago, and if nothing else, go see it for \\"Cell Block Tango\\".  That has become my favorite song of the whole thing.<BR>\\"He ran into my knife ten times!\\"
B00006CXXU|5.0|I was really amazed with the difference of this album, compared to her previous ones. Its a grown up, more mature vertue and it really complemnts her voice. I had my doubts, but its full of different flavor and its an excelent item that stands for respect of woman! I like #5...ITS GREAT and i would reccomend this ro EVERYONE!
B0000009RT|5.0|Remember when you used to hear, &quot;If the Mothers of Invention didn't exist, someone would have had to keep it that way?&quot; It was pretty daring for a rock group to take on the real and alleged hip cliches and pop music pretensions and mash them through what amounted to a musical Sunbeam Mixmaster, but that's exactly what Zappa and the boys did right out of the gate. They weren't exactly the first rock and roll satirists, but they were probably the first a) to make more than a one-trick career out of it, at least for a few years; and, b) other than periodically quoting from their own favourite songs, they were the first rock satirist/parodists to work with entirely original material. And, of course, in Frank Zappa the Mothers had one of the more commanding talents rock and roll had ever yielded.<br />They got craftier as musicians as they went along (their percussive work was hugely singular and frequently a critical ingredient in the band's funnier moments; Zappa was a spry guitarist, even if his real instrument was the band itself); they seemed as much befuddled as enraptured by their musical roots (especially their doo-wop and R and B roots - which didn't stop them from deftly copping, for &quot;Wowie Zowie&quot;'s coda, from the coda of the Four Seasons's &quot;Sherry&quot;). For deadly balloon-pricking of social and musical poseurism past and incumbent (though their political barbs became a little less engaging as time went on), this was as consistent and complete as the original Mothers of Invention - the first version of the band was the Mothers of Invention that really mattered - could be. <br />Aside from which, after all these years &quot;Help! I'm A Rock&quot; and, especially, &quot;The Return of the Son of Monster Magnet,&quot; in all its near-endless, steady-rising squall, remain two of the classic guilty pleasures of mid-1960s rock, and was at least as much ahead of its time for its brash experimentalism as the early Pink Floyd soon enough proved.
0375703861|2.0|Not a single person in our book group could get through this book. I kept trudging through hoping something would happen, then just gave up.
0385720920|5.0|Okay first off Chuck rocks.  He is one of the best new writters out there.  I read choke about a year ago since then I've read the book about three more times.  It is the best book I have ever picked up.  Once you read the first page you won't put it down till its done.  Lots of people have read chucks other books before this but this was my first and fav.  I do also have all his other books which are all very good ; Invisable Monsters, Fight Club, Survivor, Lulaby and Choke.  I hope this review helped you in deciding wrather or not you buy this book.  I say buy it then buy another for your firend/s its a classic and a must have even if you never read.
B00006F83Y|4.0|When I bought this disc I totally was unaware of the fact that any of these guys were in the band Kyuss. A stoner/rock quartet that split in the mid 90's. What you get here is psychedelic but heavy rock played in the vein of early Monster Magnet,Kyuss(surprise!), perhaps a little bit of Sonic youth and something else that escapes me now. I love that really muddy guitar and bass tone. The disc starts out making fun of radio referring to it as &quot;CLONE RADIO&quot;- funny. I think my only real problem with this band and just the genre really is the spaced out jams that get a little redundant. Some the cool riffs they jam out on are good enough to go for a million measures I guess. David Groul makes a guest appearance playing drums on I guess all the tunes. Not really sure though. He sounds like an animal on this disc. I guess one forgets just how good he really is. Overall a disc worth getting...
B00000IAU3|5.0|A Phenomenal release!  Soft &amp; Hard, Sultry &amp; Thoughtful, every song is a winner on this CD!
B000001EAQ|5.0|Ok, this album is amazing. I don't know why people talk about it being to techno and stuff. If you watch U2 play the songs from this album it is all instruments plus some other stuff, but they just put effects on it. This is probaly Bono's finest lyrics ever on their albums. Edge's guitar is amazing onthis one from songs like &quot;Gone&quot; and &quot;Last Night on Earth.&quot; Adam and Larry have great rythem on this album from songs like &quot;Please&quot; and &quot;Mofo.&quot; This album is so misunderstood, but don't listen to critics go buy it and you will be greatly pleased. I am a huge huge U2 fan and i could listen to this one over and over this album is truly great. So do yourself a favor and buy it. You will be pleased.
B000002H72|5.0|Yeah i know that's a very bold statement and you probably won't take this review seriously now, but what exactly do the Beatles have over the Pixies, other than a sickening amount of popularity and publicity? Just like the beatles, the pixies changed the way rock music was played. The soft, quiet verses to the loud thrashing choruses was first done by the Pixies and about 90% of bands since have used that same dynamic in most of thier songs. It's almost criminal the way this band came and went so fast with such little recognition. During thier short time as a band, the Pixies released 5 almost flawless albums, the last 2 didn't live up to the impossible standard the Pixies set for themselves but were still great albums. Doolittle was the Pixies at thier peak. This album has possibly the greatest hooks of any album in the past 20 years. Kurt Cobain and Rivers Cuomo couldn't hold a candle to Black Francis as far as song writing goes. No band has been so subtle and so violent in the same song as the Pixies. Joey Santiago is one of the most underated guitarists ever. He is probably the most insane and violent guitarist since Jimi Page was in his hey day, even though both came from very different genres. Kim Deal and David Lovering make a very tight pounding rhythm section. It's hard to pick favorite songs from Doolittle as every song on this album is as irresistably catchy and twisted as the last. Doolittle is more electic than thier previous albums, which shows Frank Black's amazing versatility as a song writer. Songs like 'Hey' which is thier idea of a romantic ballad, 'Here comes your man', which is pure pop goodness and 'Silver' and 'Mr Grieves' which are inexplainably wierd make this album so incredible. If i had to pick favorites though, 'Debaser' 'Crackity Jones' and 'Gouge away' which has possibly the greatest chorus ever, would be up there. Whats so amazing about Doolittle and all the Pixies albums is they are still as fresh and exciting as the day they were released. No other band has come close to making such dynamic and exciting music since.
B00006879E|5.0|Successful experiment: bought an album by a band that are all younger than me, and I already am completely fascinated by it.  The album's named 'Songs About Jane', the band's name is 'Maroon 5'.<br />It's got the full-on mid-70's soul thang goin' on.  I'm surprised by &lt;b&gt;just how much&lt;/b&gt; I like it.  It's sort of reminiscent of that Santana-plus-Rob-Thomas number Smooth-- however, it's got a lot more funk than that.  This is really good stuff, folks.
B000056NX5|1.0|I was excited about the new modern look and sound. Everything was right, then Judas began singing \\"Heaven on their minds\\" and it was downhill from then on. He sounded like Bono with an even bigger whine. Jesus could not be any more bland than a cardboard sandwich.<BR>Norman Jewison knows how to portray passion, love and agony and knows how to find the people with the talent to perform those emotions. Go get the Jewison version. This is a total waste of time!!!

B00000DHRX|4.0|This is a great collection of Michael's work. I really can't think of anything that's missing. All the slow stuff on one cd, and all the fast stuff on the other. If I have to point out one flaw, I would say that too many of these were \\"almost hits\\". Though it's all good, I believe one disc would have been great. 15-19 tracks from \\"Careless whisper\\" to \\"Outside\\". I mean minus Wham and all the duets, he did only have three albums, didn't he? Also the \\"I want your sex\\" track is NOT the one most of us know and love. But back to the positive. We all need some George Michael in our cd collection. And let's face it. You gotta have \\"Fastlove\\", you gotta have \\"Freedom\\", and above all else, you gotta have \\"Faith\\"!
0553579908|5.0|\\"A Clash of Kings,\\" George R.R. Martin's sequel to \\"A Game of Thrones,\\" retains the strengths that made the first book uncommonly lifelike and multifaceted in the fantasy genre:  round characters with complex motivations described through multiple viewpoints, facing real struggles against each other instead of stock heroics against an evil arch enemy.  <br />As with \\"Game,\\" each chapter takes the viewpoint of one of several characters.  Martin adds two new point-of-view characters, including one seen from other perspectives in \\"Game\\" and one entirely new.  New settings, such as the Iron Islands, Dragonstone, and the wild forests north of the Wall are described with the same vivid detail and forethought featured in \\"Game,\\" against the backdrop of a land split by warring factions.  The seven parts of the religious system in the first book are further detailed, a theological counterpoint to the new religion of one faction.  Unlike \\"Game,\\" \\"Clash\\" includes sorcery, a device common in ordinary fantasy, but Martin only hints at it in one case, and combines it with religion in another.  <br />The major characters work through difficult struggles, particularly Arya, while Tyrion, possibly Martin's most interesting character, masterfully navigates the political intrigue at court.  Caetlyn's point of view describes several important scenes in the first half of the book, but she constantly broods over her broken family and plays a less active role in events than in \\"Game.\\"  Bran receives two guests out of nowhere in the middle of the book and then embarks on a new plot tack.  Some major characters from \\"Game\\" are displaced almost completely, such as Robb.  The uneven pacing of certain character's narratives over the whole book, like those of Caetlyn and Bran, leaves \\"Clash\\" feeling slightly disjointed as an overall story.  The plot flies along much faster than the length of the book suggests, and Martin keeps it moving by describing some key battles and scenes but relating thenews of others instead.  Martin doesn't shirk away from even more brutality than in \\"Game,\\" but the vicious barbarisms do fit the wartime situation.<br />As with \\"A Game of Thrones,\\" the dizzying array of endless knights and soldiers mandates the character lists in the appendix, but all of these characters are uniquely and vividly drawn.  Parts of the epic scope, such as the entire plot line of Daenerys, could be eliminated completely.  Regardless, Martin's sequel retains the rare skill of narrative and the realistic feel of his previous novel, while turning a fast-paced yarn through the clashes of war between the various factions.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This CD is one of the best albums I have bought in a long time. The music is both inspirational and moving, and keeps you wanting to get up and dance. Christina has an amazing voice and despite her new &quot;dirrty&quot; image, she has what it takes to stay in the mainstream for a long time. Keep it up!
B00006CXSS|5.0|Great mini-series that fires on all cylinders, but ...<br />Band of Brothers dvd set does NOT have english subtitles! I consider this a glaring omission that does a great disservice to the men and women who actually served during this war. Many of them are 80+ years old, and hard of hearing. How very unfortunate that the very generation that this miniseries honors may not be able to fully enjoy it!
B000060OWV|2.0|This record is not Robben Ford at his best, uninspired playing and singing and the lyrics are really at a low level, not a good record at all..
B000069HK2|2.0|I would have to say that this cd is not very good.  I am myself a wide listener of music and appreciate all kinds of music.  However, there were only two things going good for this band on this cd:  the song &quot;taste of ink&quot; and the lyrics.  When I say lyrics, I mean the lyrics for most of the songs, not just &quot;taste of ink.&quot;  Anyway, The Used's lead singer is not even close to being anything good, and at times gets on my nerves.  He needs to tone it down some.  Some of the songs were decent, but nothing compares to &quot;Taste of Ink.&quot;  That song just made the cd.  Buy the single if they have it out and bypass this cd.  It'll save ya 5 or 6 bucks.
B000001E3L|5.0|Our greatest artists have always shown themselves to be explosive creators at one time, and egotistical polywogs at other times.<BR> I have seen many many concerts, and there is not much that I have missed. When an artist is in a groove, and the right people are around them, the result is memorable. The central artist does not need to out perform the entire group, but works to blend in with them, letting everyone show their own creativity.<BR> Comparing music to a painting, one color should not control the canvas, but be integral in the presentation of the image. Van does not need to control the performance, and in his restraint, allows for a more balanced and professional show. Such is the strength of this album; Balance between a number of singularly great musicians creating a tremendously great musical product, laced with spontaneity and emotion.<BR>  With that in mind, you can look at a number of compositions which truly shine in this album. The first disc is highlighted with the Stormy Monday, and Good Morning Little School Girl medleys with stand out performances by Junior Wells and Jimmie Witherspoon.The second disc in this album is tremendous, with an outstanding medley in Lonely Avenue highlighted again by Jimmie Witherspoon.<BR>  A friend of mine who leads a blues group on harmonica calls this album  one of the best he has ever heard. Its strength is as I have spoken of earlier; spontaneity and emotion. <BR>  If you live for the blues, or want to learn to, dont let this album pass you by.

B00007KMP1|5.0|Elsewhere you will find many reviews of this album as far as performance and songwriting. What I want to scream out to everyone is that well-produced multichannel is not a gimmick, not hype. It is breathtaking. <br />If you prefer the stereo version of this SACD (the stereo mix is also included on this disc) over the multichannel, you are not human. Of course you need to listen with good speakers. Those little 3-inch cubes found in a lot of home theater setups cannot do justice to this incredibly full and rich sound.<br />Do yourself the biggest audio favor in your life and buy some good surround speakers, and a good center, as good as your front left and right. Then pop in Elliot Scheiner's surround mix of Sea Change. You will laugh that you were satisfied with just stereo for all these years.
0395193958|3.0|I just want to say that the print quality of this book is rather bad, there are many letters with tiny blank spaces and not very well printed characters; there are little black spots throughout the text as well. I was very disappointed by these annoying details as I thought that this leather bound book was the best edition available (as a matter of fact it is sold as a \\"collector's edition\\"). I think it's not worth the price, not at least until the publisher will be able to put these things right. I personally recommend to purchase a less fancy (but better printed) paperback edition. If I had known that this hardback edition contained so many typographic errors, I would have saved my money without doubt. <br />The Lord of the Rings is a great and challenging book but this \\"renowned\\" edition has been a letdown for me and does not do justice to this literary classic.<br />Publishers, edit a new reprinted and revised edition please.
B000069HKH|1.0|The actual recording of this album is absolutely atrocious.<br />If you're looking for a real 9/11/01 album, look no further than Bob Dylan's 'Love and Theft'.  'Love and Theft' was released on Tuesday, 9/11/01.  Dylan said more about 9/11 before 9/11 than Springsteen could say post 9/11; who's the genius here?  Dylan's 'Love and Theft' recording is decent; however, the music and underlying message and insight is much stronger.<br />Springsteen failed miserably on both accounts.  I sense this album was quickly rushed to market to make a quick buck and get lots of radio air time.<BR>  <BR>Whatever happened to Springsteen the &quot;artist&quot;?  Did commercial success destroy this guy or what?<br />The fact that this album was nominated for 'Album of the Year' reminds us all of how musically-shallow, narrow-minded, and clueless the Grammy Awards are today.
B000002I97|5.0|John Prine never has sold as many records as his fellow folk-rockers John Denver and Bob Dylan(both singers I admire) have. However, after listening to Prine's self-titled '71 release, I think he's right up there with those two artists.<br /><br />My favorite songs on here are the humorous ones. \\"Spanish Pipe Dream\\"(called \\"Blow Up Your TV\\" when John Denver recorded it) is John P.'s funny account of a barroom conversation between a soldier on his way to where he's stationed and the topless dancer he meets up with. \\"Your Flag Decal Won't Get You Into Heaven Anymore\\" pokes fun at our patriotic obsessions--and might be more timely in the wake of the attacks on our country on September 11, 2001(and the resulting flag-waving we engaged in). \\"Illegal Smile\\" is a bouncy tune about trying to laugh when everything around you is going wrong. \\"Pretty Good\\" and \\"Quiet Man\\" are blues-rock at its finest.<br /><br />John Prine is at his best, though, when he gets serious. \\"Hello In There\\", which was covered by Joan Baez and Bette Midler, is John P.'s classic melancholy ballad about an older couple whose loved ones live far away and who are dealing with the resulting loneliness(\\"Old people just grow lonesome waiting for someone to say/Hello in there/Hello\\"). In the song \\"Sam Stone\\", Sam is an injured, drug-addicted war veteran whose addiction eventually kills him. \\"Far From Me\\" deals with the pain of a relationship gone bad. Prine's environmental anthem, \\"Paradise\\"(which, by the way, was also done by John Denver), is more lively than the other songs I previously mentioned. Still, it's a serious song. \\"Paradise\\" is about the coal-mining company building its mine in Paradise, Kentucky, near the Green River. John P. is a native Kentuckian, so he tells the story from his own experience. The chorus tells what happens when natural beauty is sacrificed to those who merely want to make money off the land(\\"Daddy, won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County/Down by the Green River, where Paradise lay/Well, I'm sorry, my son, but you're too late in askin'/Mr. Peabody's coal train has hauled it away\\"). Preservation of natural beauty is an issue that's just as big now as it was in '71, when John wrote \\"Paradise\\".<br /><br />This record may seem dated to some people, since it was released over 30 years ago. John Prine, however, continues to make records, and the songs on \\"John Prine\\" talk about issues(war and peace, protecting our resources, substance abuse) that have always been important to a lot of people. John P. also has a great sense of humor. Check out this classic album from an artist who I think is one of the most underrated folk-rockers around.adise lay/Well, I'm sorry, my son, but you're too late in askin'/Mr. Peabody's coal train has hauled it away\\").

B00005B36H|5.0|Tool is alien.  No one else can produce music that is as moving, complex and mind-blowing as Tool did with Lateralus.  This album has changed the way I listen to music forever.  If anyone can pull off the scream Maynard releases in &quot;The Grudge&quot;, I would be amazed, and when he did it live I almost wet myself.  By far, the best album of all time.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers is the best Waorld War Two film, documentary or mini-series. The actors are slightly unknown and incredable. This is the most powerful story out there. Buy this series despite the cost. It is more then worth it.
0375757295|4.0|I'm surprised that the other reviewers on this page are so lukewarm to Persuasion.  True, it is not a perfect book, but I found it immensly enjoyable and well written.  It is different to Austen's other novels, and having just finished Emma the difference was obvious to me, but it is also a completely different kind of book.  It is written by an older and more serious woman than the one who penned Pride and Prejudice and Emma, and tells the story of an older, though still relatively young woman, who is haunted by a terrible choice she made several years ago to please her family and friends.<BR>The book is far more Romantic than anything else Austen wrote, and I also found it more streamlined and focussed.  There are no chapters on how to set the table, like there were in Emma.<BR>I was a little disappointed in the end, as Austen doesn't record the conversation between Anne Eliot and Captain Wentworth, but instead tells us in a detached way what topics they spoke of. Still, that's a fairly minor quibble against what was really a very good book.

B00007BH5C|5.0|Howard Shore's score for \\"The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring\\" was a truly excellent piece of work and his music for \\"The Two Towers\\" is a worthy successor.<br />To appreciate it one has to realise that the score, like the film itself, is not a standalone piece of work. \\"The Two Towers\\" isn't even the second film in a series of three. Rather it is the second act in an epic story spread over three films, the first two of which have been magnificent. <br />That is why there is repetition in some of the music. Shore uses the \\"motif\\" system with particular characters, groups, and situations having associated musical themes. These can be presented alone or in association with others, and can be prominent or subdued. It is no surprise that some of the motifs from \\"Fellowship\\" reappear here and are woven in with new ones. Some powerful new motifs appear - notably for the troubled Kingdom of Rohan and its people's struggle. No doubt there will be more when \\"The Return of the King\\" hits the screen, all too far in the distance.<br />As a CD to listen to it is enjoyable. But for someone who has seen the movie more than once (and everyone should see it more than once) and can relate music to what appeared on the screen it is an emotional experience of great pleasure and intensity.<br />See the film! Buy the CD! And of course read the book!
0066214122|5.0|I first heard of this book when I was on the internet.  I was searching Michael Crichton's webpage and entered a contest.  If you win you get a free signed copy of Michael Crichton's newest novel: Prey.  Well, I won.  Yay, and so on.  But any way, the book was terrific, filled with action, but still with educated lectures that Crichton is famous for(Or at least this is what I think.)  The book starts out slow while giving details of a man and his family.  Jack is a man that is turned into a \\"Mr. Mom\\" and so forth, etc.  Then after you get to triple digits(that means three numbers, moron.) it shoots with action.  I can't tell you in detail, about how this is because you need to read it for yourself.  I realy loved this book because how much you learn(about nanotech, predator and prey, group of animal's \\"social lifes\\" if you will.) and how fun you have reading it.  I highly recomend this book to anyone.  *****stars.
B0000035E7|5.0|It's hard for me to really pick a favorite Nirvana album, becuase they're all very good [if I had to though it'd be their live &quot;Unplugged&quot; album]. While Nevermind probably is the best out of their studio albums, it seems that it and In Utero get far more attention than Bleach and Incesticide. This has a much more unrefined sound then Nevermind does and is a lot more punk influenced. The guitar work keeps true to the fuzz-style of early grunge and most of the songs are short with fast guitars, in the tradition of punk, so this album probably more than any other sowcases Nirvana's punk roots. <br />For this reason this album seems like a somewhat bad choice if you're just getting to like Nirvana [since in Utero and nevermind both sound much more like what you probably hear from them on the radio], however if you like ohter early grunge bands or punk bands of the time, or like songs such as &quot;Lithium&quot;, &quot;Breed&quot;, and &quot;Stay Away&quot; off of Nevermind then this is the album for you. My personal favorites off of here are &quot;School&quot;, &quot;Negative Creep&quot;, &quot;Downer&quot; and the best track of the bunch, &quot;Blew.&quot; And also of course, About A Girl which sounds noticbly different on here than it does on &quot;Unplugged&quot; [where as Penyroyal Tea and All Apologies, both from &quot;In Utero&quot; sound more or less the same on &quot;Unplugged&quot;].<br />So to really get down to it, this album is very good. If you are a big fan of nirvana get it, you will like it. If you are just a  casual fan or mainly liek their radio singles then get Nevermind or In Utero, or their new Greatest Hits collection.

0066214122|4.0|This is good, not great escapist fiction, although from all the hype surrounding the release of PREY, its premise is not that far from reality. Scientists in the fields of computer technology, genetic engineering and nanotechnology are developing the ability to produce molecular sized robots that will be able to manipulate matter at the atomic level. In PREY, these robots swarm together and develop emergent behavior (effective new behaviors developed when old behaviors are ineffective) which is life-threatenning to the scientists who have created them.<br />PREY has some very exciting and thrilling moments and some intriguing information about biology and animal behavior that elevates it above the typical story of \\"science runs amok\\". The problems with it however are found in the elements that, when present, make excellent and satisfying reading. Those elements are very limited in PREY. There is very minimal character development and the dialogue can be simple-minded and at times ludicrous. For example, Jack, after witnessing his wife, who is filled with deadly particles, attempt to murder another scientist, describes his reaction, \\"I felt tremendously uneasy\\". I guess!<br />Nonetheless, if readers are looking for a fast-paced, entertaining thriller that provides enough science and new information to speculate about the world's future, then they should enjoy PREY.
B000002UDB|5.0|For a change, the Magical Mystery Tour version released in the U.S. was superior to the UK version, which was more or less an EP.  The U.S. version gathers some key singles from 1967 (Strawberry Fields Forever and Penny Lane) and makes this a great cd.<br />Not quite the strong thematic accomplishment of Sgt. Pepper's, but this collection certainly holds its own.  The Beatles were still up to their studio tricks, using lots of orchestration, backwards cymbals, unusual instruments, etc. and each song is again unique.  This disk also has some of Ringo's finest drumming.<br />5 star songs include:<br />&quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; with John Lennon singing about a place near his home in Liverpool.  A great thing about Lennon penned tunes was that he always included the listener on the journey.  &quot;Let me take you down...&quot; Trippy and introspective, with slowed down tape to deepen lower his voice, then pieced together with another faster track in a different key.  Great combo of rock instruments and orchestra.  Great drum dynamics, especially the ending reprise and fadeout.<br />&quot;Penny Lane&quot; is Paul's Liverpool trip, a cheerful tune with some nice lyrical twists like &quot;four of fish and finger pies&quot; and &quot;a pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray.&quot;  Also like the horns, especially that solo.<br />&quot;All You Need is Love&quot; is a perfect ode to the 1967 &quot;Summer of Love.&quot;<br />&quot;The Fool on the Hill&quot; ranks among Paul's better lyrical efforts.  &quot;The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud.&quot;  Nice recorders.<br />&quot;I Am The Walrus&quot; is one John Lennon's all-time best Beatle tunes, with, as another reviewer stated, nonsense lyrics that somehow make sense.  This is the quintessential combo of rock meets orchestra that has been imitated very since the Beatles perfected it.  Great drum performance by Ringo.<br />4 star tunes:<br />&quot;Hello Goodbye&quot; has a catchy, singalong melody, nice harmonies, cool guitars, but lyrically doesn't have much substance.<br />&quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; is a good intro piece, with horns, harmonies, and great drums.

B00004STPT|5.0|I have no words for the power, beauty, complexity, and raw emotion of this CD. Gladiator was a great movie (I have watched it more than twenty times) but what was the most important part of this movie was the soundtrack. From the opening battlescenes (can you believe it's a waltz!) to the haunting vocals of Lisa Gerrard on &quot;Now We Are Free&quot;, I was almost too busy listening to the movie to pay the acting any attention. It is beautiful, unique, and well worth the price if you love film scores.
B00006LLJ4|5.0|The plot is very clever -- with a future that is both possible and amazing.  (For the reviewer who thought it was full of holes, go back and see it again.  The answers are there, but your brain has to be on!)  The acting is brilliant!  The special effects are incredible.  And Spielberg proves, yet again, that he is the very best!<br />I'd take the time to explain the storyline, but I see that has already been done.  This is a movie worth seeing over and over!  There are so many layers and so much to see, you can't possibly catch it all on the first try.

Couple this with Robbie's strong unique voice and surely you finally have an excellent Pop Album that even the American Public will find palitable.<br />This is a quality collection that deserves to be heard - especially by Justin Timberlake who's recent work pales by comparrison.

0066214122|3.0|I am a big fan of Mr. Crichton, but he failed in this novel to provide the nail biting tension typical of his earlier works. He seemed to be more interested in explaining and promoting nanotechnology and impressing the reader with his expertise in computer progamming techniques than telling a good story.  This was more like a textbook set in a fictional novel.  It is a good read, but wait for the paperback version.

B00005JL7Q|5.0|It frightened me, at first, to hear that directors Chris and Paul Weitz, the guys who made &quot;American Pie,&quot; were behind the film adaptation of Nick Hornby's novel. Though Hugh Grant was born to play the self-centered, shallow, immature man urged to grow through his relationship with a young boy in need, I forgot about the occasional moments of warmth in &quot;American Pie&quot; and doubted the Weitzes were capable of conveying the heart and seriousness necessary to make this film. I was wrong.<br />Matching moments of true horror involving attempted suicide at the film's beginning with Grant's continuing snarky, sarcastic voiceover showed that the directors had found the precise balance necessary to make the film work. It's a heartwarming, occasionally edgy film about the human need for others and about how a family - whether one we're born into or one that we create for ourselves - can help us grow.<br />Nicholas Hoult, as Marcus, gives a great performance, and Toni Collette, as his hippie, depressive mother, is Oscar-caliber, but the film belongs to Grant. It's the best work he's ever done.
B000063DI9|4.0|This is a great Maiden record.  I first purchased it when I was 14 back in 1989 on LP.  Now 14 years later I still enjoy this great release from one of Britain s finest bands.<br />The UK has been the birth place of many of my favorite bands (i.e. Genesis, King crimson).  Iron maiden was a band that went through many different phases but on this album, and many that came before this, they were breaking new ground in their genre.<br />This very powerful album starts w Moonchild.  Nice upbeat number w the whole band clicking on all cylinders.  Then we come down to Infinite dreams, which picks up pretty good towards the end.<br />The album continues in this fashion w trademark Steve Harris bass, and the guitars of D. Murray and A. smith.  I reccomend this album because it is one of the best in my opinion that this band made, but also because it can be accepted by different peoples of different likes of music.
B00006LSM3|2.0|The best thing that can be said about this album is that it will probably be his last.  I am a huge Beatles fan, and a huge George fan, but he has not had a really good album since 33 1/3,<BR>which was over 25 years ago.  <BR>Perhaps the only thing worse for George's music than discovering Eastern religion was discovering slide guitar.  And Ukulele. And Jeff Lynne.  I tried to like this but can't.  This album is the personification of all that is the WORST of George Harrison's music.  When He sings God God God I'm crying Damn Damn Damn. Comparing this to Traveling Willburys is not necessarily a compliment.<BR>But you know, none of the Beatles has released a decent solo album since John Lennon died.  Give me All Things Must Pass.  Or better yet, compare this dog with Living in the Material World.  Just as preachy, but far more entertaining.  If you want to hear GOOD George Harrison, buy the three albums I mentioned here.
B0000797IO|3.0|After hearing the raves of Jennifer Aniston's performance in this movie, I was really looking forward to seeing it. She does a great job portraying Justine, a 30-something retail clerk who's unhappy with her life.<br />The problem is, Justine as a character is so completely selfish and unsympathetic that by the time the climax of the movie rolled around, and it was time for Justine to choose between going back to her old life or running away with her young lover, I realized I didn't much care which she chose.<br />I can understand and even somewhat relate to Justine; she sees no way out of her humdrum, unhappy life. But that, in my opinion, did not excuse her subsequent behavior: she dumps her ailing coworker, Gwen, at the hospital, says she's going to park the car, then drives off for her first rendezvous with Holden. She later uses the dying woman as her alibi for further romantic trysts. When Holden catches her sleeping with Bubba (to prevent him from telling her husband Phil about her affair with Holden) and, upset, call her a whore, she decides then that he's a child, and the only way for her to move forward \\"on the road to redemption\\" is to dump him...which she proceeds to try and do by buying him a tin of the blackberries she believed fatally poisoned Gwen. Justine then gets pregnant (by whom, we're never 100% sure) and convinces Phil it's his baby, despite the doctors just having told him he has a low sperm count. Holden, who robbed the store safe for money to run away with Justine, is turned into the police by her (to save her name from being associated with the robbery), with tragic results.<br />I suppose you could take the view that the title is meant to indicate irony: Justine is anything but a \\"good girl.\\" However, I think there should have been *something* redeeming about the character, and I just didn't see it there. She isn't even the kind of character you \\"love to hate.\\" She's not much of anything.
1878424319|5.0|I purchased this book 1 year ago...the principals in this book are awesome! I have found it has not only changed my life but also many of my friends lives whom I have shared this book with. It is often the topic of conversation during social gatherings.Life is simply about seeing the good in everyone and in every situation. We as humans must pass this on by the examples we set in our own lives.<BR>If every adult in this world read this book and followed the agreements what a better world this would be.<BR>Thank you for allowing me to share.
0064407667|4.0|This book was so short yet so compelling that I flew through it, and I ran to the store immediately to pick up the second one.<br />Other reviewers who've said that the lead characters aren't as well-defined as one should hope are correct, for you're not truly invested in the uniqueness of Klaus, Violet and Sunny. They're not so much characters as they are tools of the plot. They're the things that monstrous plot twists are built around.<br />By the book's end, after Klaus has been beaten, the infant Sunny has been trapped in a birdcage dangling from a tower and the 14-year-old Violet has been forced to participate against her will in a marriage ceremony, the wicked humor of the book wins you over.<br />Though unfortunate for the Baudelaire children, it was a very pleasant way to spend a couple of hours for me.
B00006RIO7|5.0|I absolutely loved this soundtrack most of the way through.  It is not until the end that it falters with an awful rendetion of Cell Block Tango and a terrible song by Anastacia.

B00005JKCH|5.0|I love the humor throughout this movie - especially when he's trying to figure out how to use the web.<br />Worth buying to watch at home :)
0060934913|4.0|other than cooking magazines.  My husband and I are foodies, enjoy cooking and dining out frequently.  I became &quot;hooked&quot; on Tony after watching A Cook's Tour.  I really enjoyed this book.  Although I now, would never become a chef (he scared me off).  I have to read all of his other books.  He is &quot;tres&quot; witty!
B000067DNC|5.0|I love this show. I started watching it about a year ago. A friend of mine had season one on DVD and popped it in. I've been hooked ever since. I bought season one and as soon as I found out about season two I had it ordered. I can't express the amount of irritation I feel when I think how much longer we have to wait for season three while the Brits are getting it at the end of this month. For all those 'gaters who don't know, there are unconfirmed rumors that season three will be hitting region one in June 2003, with season four to possibly follow in September 2003. I hope this is true. And though I am in no way affiliated with the site.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Ok, let me first prove to you how much I hate musicals. I have actually taken a tour of Saltzburg, Austria, where &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;was filmed, and was the only person on the tour who had never even seen the movie! That's because I hate musicals! I mean, people talking, then suddenly breaking out in harmony, yeah, that happens in real life...NOT. So, I rented Moulin Rouge and brought it home. Guess what, I never even watched it, because I know hate musicals, I just wanted to know what all of the hype was about. I finally caught it on HBO because nothing else was on, and I LOVED IT! First of all, all the stars do their own singing! Know of any stars that put out albums just because they're stars and they think they can sing?(Jennifer Love Hewwitt and Joey Lawrence come to mind, but I bet you could think of more.)While Nicole Kidman, who usually really bugs me in movies surprised me with her performance, it is EWAN McGREGOR that should have got the oscar nomination! He blew me away! His voice is so strong, and he can express the emotions of hurt, and love and anger without uttering a word! He is much better casted here, than in the Star Wars saga.John Leguizamo is refreshning, and the music...THE MUSIC! Music that I could actually relate to!I had to buy this 2 disc dvd, and the extras are great. Check out the Josh Abrams remix of &quot;Come what may.&quot; The video made from outakes from the movie, and I wished that every dvd would show some outakes, they are so entertaining! You'll like this movie, even if you normally hate musicals, like me.
B000005DSN|5.0|First, there is something I need to say : I first thought this album was really not for me. I found the vocals annoying. But I read recommendations of Stratovarius' &quot;Visions&quot; on the web site of a band I liked at this time, so I decided to give it a try.<br />This album began to interest me for its magic atmosphere and the opener &quot;Kiss of Judas&quot;, which was, at first one of the only songs I found really good. Other songs managed to catch my attention, but I still cannot bear the song &quot;Paradise&quot;, most of other reviewers found so great.<br />Here are my personnal ratings :<br />Kiss of Judas - A+<BR>I think it's the most standard song. It's really accessible, it has a good chorus. Someone new to Stratovarius can surely hear it without rolling his eyes. It's also my personnal favorite.<br />Black Diamond - A-<BR>I don't really agree with you saying it is one of the best. The guitar is quite annoying on this one.<br />Forever free - A-<BR>This one has a good chorus. It's quite generic.<br />Before the winter - A+<BR>The 2nd high point of the album, in my opinion. It's a wonderful ballad. Those who say Stratovarius is a cold emotionless band take note.<br />Legions - A<BR>A good and fast rhythm and some of the best guitar riffs of the album. A nice solo.<br />Abyss of your eyes - A<BR>The best synthesisers sound effects, the most atmospheric song.<BR>Sounds kind of a ballad, but not really. Original.<br />Holy Light - C+<BR>I don't really like this instrumental. I don't know what instruments the guys are using (sort of middle between guitar and synthesiser), but it sounds cheesy.<BR>Note that I prefer the instrumentals &quot;Episode&quot; and &quot;Stratosphere&quot;.<br />Paradise - D-<BR>The weak point of the album. I hate this song. It starts well on the guitar, but at the first vocal I hear, I switch it off !<BR>&quot;wondering and watching TV&quot; yeah, &quot;many rare species will perish soon and we will be short on food&quot; argh ! what lyrics !<BR>&quot;sacriFICE&quot; &quot;sacriFICE&quot;, I hate it ! accents placed on the wrong syllable ... etc ...<br />Coming home - A<BR>Nice ballad, but it has nothing special.<br />Visions - C-<BR>The other weak point of the album, in my opinion. It's plain annoying and has no direction. Changes constantly of rhythm and tone.<br />As a whole, this is a pretty good album. I also like the cover art, like in almost all stratovarius albums. <BR>I like the sort of magic world created, but they should stay in the same logic : <BR>why is it about TV screen on &quot;paradise&quot;? <BR>Don't introduce today's reality in it !<br />Stratovarius' Line-up :<BR>Timo Tolkki - Guitar<BR>Timo Kotipelto - Vocals<BR>Jari Kainulainen - Bass<BR>Jens Johansson - Keyboards<BR>Jörg Michael - Drums
1570429596|1.0|This is a good fairy tale, nothing in this book is true.  I will agree that after reading the book you will be motivated and encourage to do many things.  <BR>Haven't you ever heard, that if anything is to good to be true, than it probably is)  Kiyosaki is rich, however only by us the consumer buying his fairy tale books.  <BR>I would recommend that you go to the library and check the book out instead of buying it.  I would rate this book higher, but after reading and looking for information, Kiyosaki does not have any facts to go with his information about the book.  <BR>Amway is one of his major assests/backing.  Did you know that he will give free speeches for Amway, however charges everyone else a fee.<BR>If you look in the Smart Money Magazine, Feb 2003, they will tell you the same thing I trying to tell you.  Kiyosaki is using someone else story and making money off of it.  <BR>No facts to back up his ventures, which is a big downer, ( I thought this guy was the real deal)
B00005JKDR|5.0|This movie is fantastic from start to finish.  Amazing animations, funny for kids and adults, imaginative, entertaining.  I just love this movie and have been judging all other new kids' movies against it.  Tough standard to live up to!  Pixar ROCKS.  Lilo &amp; Stitch and Treasure Planet didn't have a chance against this flick in my mind.  A *must own*!
B000000HHE|3.0|if you are buying this brand new there is a 90% chance you'll get the 20th anniversary remaster with a bonus disc that shares almost the same tracklisting as \\"De La Remix\\", the elusive import album.  <br />the original cd was mixed pretty ..low, and this re-master is EVEN LOWER.  i popped the original in, turned it down just so i could barely hear the words, put the re-master in and i couldn't hear ANYTHING.  tommy boy really ... the guys over on this one.
0966638328|5.0|I was convinced that I was an expert with color. All of my work explodes with color. However, I purchased this book anyway and WOW was I impressed. This book is inspiring. I have incorporated new combinations of color into my work and the results are awesome. Highly recommended book... must have for any graphic designer- amateur or professional.
B000001DVD|5.0|This album is absolutely unique in Def Leppard's carrier. It's their only classic of heavy metal ranking in the new wave of british heavy metal. The previous one was softer and more friendly, the next is more pop-rock. The songs are not polished at all, on the contrary to &quot;Pyromania&quot;. <br />For the &quot;High and Dry&quot; album, Def Leppard has taken advantage of services of AC/DC's producer Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange, which is not nothing. This album is also marked by guitarist Pete Willis, who will be fired after this album for coming drunk to some record sessions. This will be the first big mistake of Def Leppard.<br />Personal ratings :<br />Let it go - A+<BR>This was the other single of the album with &quot;Bringin' on the heartbreak&quot;. It has some amazing guitar riffs, it's sometimes soft, sometimes hard. It has a good chorus, with Joe Elliott's screams as backing vocals.<br />Another hit and run - A+<BR>This one has also some excellent guitar riffs and an excellent intro. Great guitar solos can be heard.<br />High 'n' dry - B-<BR>I'm not too much into this song. <BR>Drinking all day, drinking party, saturday night, that's not my style.<br />Bringin' on the heartbreak - A+<BR>Def Leppard's best ballad. Typically my point of view. I agree with this song.<br />Switch 625 - A<BR>This is an instrumental that follows directly &quot;Bringin' on the heartbreak&quot;, on which you can hear the begining at the end of the song. Best of Vault wasn't well made for that !<BR>Some screams can be heard on this instrumental.<br />You got me runnin' - A<BR>I find this song sounds a lot like the Rolling Stones. It's really pure rock 'n' roll.<br />Lady strange - B+<BR>Strange song. Sounds quite immature, but it's still a pleasure to hear this. It has a good chorus.<br />On through the night - C-<BR>On my opinion, the weak point of the album. Although it's the title of the previous album, it's on this CD. Strange.<BR>Nothing really catches me, the chorus is mediocre, it's annoying.<br />Mirror, Mirror - A+<BR>One other high point. Sounds like a strong ballad, though the word 'ballad' isn't really appropriate. The chorus is catchy and powerful.<br />No no no - B-<BR>I don't like this song very much, it's very immature. Just for fun, when you need something strong.<br />Finally, this is a great album of heavy metal, an album Def Leppard won't make again. There's almost no production, which some don't appreciate and therefore prefer &quot;Pyromania&quot; and &quot;Hysteria&quot;. My opinion is that &quot;high 'n' dry&quot; and &quot;Pyromania&quot; are the best Def Leppard albums.<br />Line-up :<BR>Rick Allen - Drums<BR>Pete Willis - Guitar<BR>Joe Elliott - Vocals<BR>Steve Clark - Guitar<BR>Rick Savage - Bass
B00003CXTG|1.0|Pearl Harbour is a big budget special effects offering from you guessed it Jerry Bruckheimer responsible for such over the top Hollywood films as Armageddon. Micheal Bay director of Bad Boys and The Rock helms this box office terror of a film. Starring one of the worst actors of all time Ben Affleck, the film starts well but ends up in cornville. <BR>What could be a powerful movie after the tragic events that took place in Pearl Harbour about sixty years ago is just an excuse to spend money on high quality effects. Pearl Harbour is a no brainer. Stay away please!
B000002GQL|4.0|I've often wondered why this album was considered the least popular among the late 60s/early 70's period for the Moody Blues.  To me this is by far their strongest work- showing a new depth of song writing while still incorporating some of their tradmark studio experiments, albeit to a much lesser degree.<br />  In my view, their more popular work (excluding Day's of Future Past) such as Lost Cord, Threshold of a Dream, and Childrens Children sound very dated and new age-y; trying to be too much of the guru and not enough of the wise observer.  Where as 7th Sojourn still maintains a desire for spirituality but there aren't so many \\"let's take drugs and escape\\" type songs (it actually sounds like they were sober when they made this album).<br />  I think that one thing that had a great deal to do with the (aritistic) success and maturity was Mike Pinder's influence- he wrote the opening song, Lost in a Lost World, which battles much of the head-in-the-cloud materialism going on today, as well as the haunting When You're a Free Man, which works as a great companion peice to Lost in a Lost World.  John Lodge's song, Isn't Life Strange, could easily be mistaken for a Pinder composition, especially considering how much Pinder's chamberlain leads the melody and the lyrics deal with disillusionment, which always seemed to be Pinder's forte.<br />  Justin Hayward's songs New Horizons, Land of Make Believe, and (the co-comp w/ Graeme Edge) You and me are strong and show his fantastic sense of whimsy and sensitivity.  Although not as popular as some of his contributions from albums like Future Passed and Question of Balance they are just a good.<br />  The final song on the album, I'm Just a Singer (in a rock and roll band) is a perfect summary of just what the moodies had accomplished up 'til then- kind of a humbling of their past achievements and a look towards what may happen next for them.  This is the only song that is sung in unison, which they hadn't really done since Ride my See-Saw.  The guitar solo is one of the gritiest they ever put to one of their songs- and I think the song serves as a great wake up call to the escapism that the Moody Blues had identified with in so many of their past albums...<br />  This may not be the album to start off with if one is interested in getting into the Moody Blues(I would recommend A Question of Balance or Days of Future Past), but I do think this is their best work.  I listen to this album by far more than I listen to any of their other works- it seems to be their most satisfying album.y done since Ride my See-Saw.

B00000AFGM|4.0|this cd is incredible.  it is, however, not as good as &quot;anti-christ superstar&quot;, which others have mentioned previously.  this cd became manson's transformation from dark rock posterboy to pop oddity (see his &quot;beautiful people&quot; performance on the mtv vmas *note, mtv blows) .  it is a long story why this album is why it is (might want to read long hard road out of hell).  manson takes musical leaps on this album that would have been unheard of in the anti-christ days.  the best song on this cd, however not exemplary of the cds sound, is &quot;coma white&quot;.  i cannot believe no one has mentioned it.  sadly, with everything manson has to say, he has lost talent ever since his quarrels with trent (reznor of nine inch nails).  &quot;holywood&quot; is worse than &quot;mechanical animals&quot;.  let's just hope that &quot;the golden age of grotesque&quot; will pull manson out of the slump.  he will forever live in the shadow of nin, no matter how hard he tries to promote himself.  he needs to return to darker music, but this cd is still amazing.  it's worth the money, and after you listen to it, get &quot;anti-christ superstar&quot;.  don't waste money on &quot;holywood&quot;.
0792833236|5.0|Martin Scorsese's 'Raging Bull' is his finest movie to date, a bleak look at 1940s middleweight boxer Jake La Motta. Seen by Scorsese as his final film, the New York director crafted a brilliant, mesmerising movie that captivates and shocks with its brutallity. Jake La Motta - an up-and-coming boxer - cannot get a shot at the title unless he gives in to the local mafia. This is a story typical of any boxing movie, but the plot is not the essense of the film, La Motta is. Based on a true story, Scorsese has used La Motta's autobiography loosley to explore the tormented, paranoid, insecure mentality of the character. The plot is arguably flimsy in this sense. Many scenes that occur in the movie have not occured at all in real-life, and other scenes are moulded perfectly for the film. For example, the real-life friend of La Motta, Joe Savage, and the boxers brother, Joey, are embodied in Joe Pesci's character Joey, La Motta's on-screen brother/manager. The script is dedicated to La Motta's struggles, in and out of the ring - he gets scared, so he beats his wife, he's worried, so he hits his brother - his only emotional outlet is violence.<br />'Raging Bull' was made at a very personal time for Scorsese, and this is reflected much in the film - the black and white photography, the unsympathetic look at La Motta, and even his wife and brother - there is no subjectivity in this film. This is particularly emphasised at one particular scene when La Motta holds the belt after becoming champion and starts to cry - La Motta is charged with emotion, yet the scene is cut away with almost a harshness to life after the event.<br />Martin Scorsese, I feel, is one of the greatest - if not the greatest - active director about. He has created some of the great movies, but certainly not Hollywood movies. 'Taxi Driver', 'Goodfellas', 'Casino', 'The Last Temptation of Christ' - all brilliant in their own right, but 'Raging Bull' is his masterpiece. The acting throughout is flawless - JoePesci and Cathy Moriarty giving great performances as La Motta's punch-bags, but of course, they are outshone by Robert De Niro's earth-shaking portrayal of the Bronx Bull. It is my personal favourite of any celluloid-captured performance.<br />This is not a boxing movie, it is a character study. It treads on all of Scorsese's themes - a sinful protagonist, Catholic guilt, redemption, violence, etc. This is what cinema is all about - an artistic, stylish piece of filmmaking.

0399230033|5.0|This is a wonderful book for children and adults alike.  As a zookeeper makes his rounds and says good night to his charges, a growing parade of animals follows him home to bed.  Be sure to look closely at all of the little details in each of the cages...and be sure to follow the antics of the mouse with the banana as well!
B0000029AL|4.0|I bought this album for &quot;DREAM ON&quot; which is one of the most wonderful songs ever written.  Unfortunately I didn't explore much of the album until I read &quot;Walk this Way&quot;.  Steven, Joe, Brad, Tom, and Joey didn't really think they gave us much of a classic here but even they were wrong.  &quot;MAKE IT&quot; is a clear look into the mind of 5 kids from Boston yearning to be Rock Stars, &quot;DREAM ON&quot; is an obvious classic, &quot;ONE WAY STREET&quot; is a masterpiece of bluesy-rock, and &quot;MAMA KIN&quot; is a staple of the Aerosmith story, although the album track can't do the live version justice.  &quot;MOVIN' OUT&quot; and &quot;WALKIN' THE DOG&quot; are also great songs to top of the album.  Really only a couple of week spots, but its 30 years old and it still holds up.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie blew me away at the theater with its originality. It was a roller coaster ride of emotions. It was the only movie to make me laugh, sing along, and cry. When ever i feel like being entertained i just pop it into my DVD player, I watched it many times on DVD and it doesnt grow old. It became a instant classic. I watched it twice in the theaters and its the only movie i attended that the audience didnt get up to leave when the credits started rolling but stayed in their seats in complete silence absorbing the emotional impact of the ending and wondering what just hit them.<BR>One word sums it up: WOW!!!!!!!!
B000001U3K|4.0|How can one go wrong with this tasty set of glam?<br />The influence of producer David Bowie is absolutely unmistakeable here (that's him playing sax in &quot;Walk on the Wild Side.&quot;)  But Lou Reed is clearly in charge here.<br />Many of these songs have become cult favorites -- and for some good reasons.  They're interminably listenable (none of the harshness that is often associated with the Velvet Underground or Reed's later work), yet they retain a real edge (after all most of the songs detail aspects of life that many of us consciously avoid).
B00005IC2H|4.0|Theres quite a few good songs on this album but with that, theres plenty of filler as well. Creating an atmoshphere in this style of music is important but this band really needs to learn song structure and not fiddle around with sounds until 8 minutes elapse and then call that a song. All in all, this is a worth while album, warm and moving. The band itself should watch there dreadful personalities and watch what they say about bands that could drill them into the ground with pure skill.
0783227019|5.0|There are not very many movies I can say that I have seen over and over, but Carlito's Way happens to be one of those theatrical releases. Well-sequenced plots, fine acting, and fantastic music from the 1970's make this a total package.<br />Though I would not quite put it on par with Scent of a Woman, Pacino's other masterpiece performance from the following year, I nonetheless find it a more all-around, entertaining movie. Just as the chemistry between a significantly older man and a significantly younger woman created by Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer was successfully played out in Wolf, the dialogue and intensity between Al Pacino and Penelope Ann Miller were on the same parallel and quite mesmerizing.<br />I especially loved the &quot;I brought you some cheesecake&quot; scene. Those who have seen this movie know what I am talking about. And if I had to rank all the women who looked great in any particular motion picture, I  would put Penelope Ann Miller's portrayal of Gail in the top five. <br />Along with the eye candy, there is plenty of delight for the ears, as well. Never before was You Are So Beautiful as sung by Joe Cocker ever placed in scenes that could be so passionate and yet so poignant.<br />For those who might have reservations about some of the adult scenes, Carlito's Way is not exactly your family entertainment kind of picture. But it is a great movie, nonetheless.
0385508417|4.0|January 14, 2003<br />Cute little book. For the first part, Grisham must have taken notes for years to list all the things than can and will go wrong during the Christmas season. When Luther and Nora Krank (\\"krank\\" - get it?) decide to skip Christmas and to go on a cruise instead, one is tempted to cheer them on.<br />But wait!! You can't do that! You cheat on Santa Claus, and your name is a vast expanse of mud - if not worse - in the neighborhood and the whole town.<br />So Luther and Nora crank it up and prepare for Christmas after all. Getting there is not easy as it has to supply the humor for the book. A predictable ending. But would it not have been fabulous if Grisham had followed through on sailing into the sunset and had supplied a happy ending of as different sort?
B00006SFLV|2.0|Day-time soaps have nothing over this program. It is a fine example of writing that is badly researched middle-of-the road pop-psych. <br />None of the characters have any emotion or depth and are simply moved through \\"life lessons\\" with no will of their own. It's an after school special for an affected generation. Maybe, however, if you're part of that generation, you'll find some solace in scenarios that are no doubt similar to You're So-Called Life.
B00005JKDQ|5.0|I couldn't wait for this to come out since my daughter was not old enough to go to the theater. I love this movie so much. My in laws got the VHS for my daughters, and I loved it so much I bought my self the DVD,
0738206679|2.0|I am a college student, and I think this book is not a good book because it is an insult to the intelligence of the general public. First of all, any high school or college level student interested in physics/maths or science in general would learn a lot more in a precise discussion of the issues in Linked in a 10-page paper. Moreso, the book is gets so repetitive, explaining the same thing over and over, it almost gets in the way of clarity.<br />This book, is not 'clear' or 'easy' - on the contrary, it applies a few concepts taken out of context to many different fields - but does not do it in a uniform way, yet presents it for the sake of addressing the general audience as if it was uniform. It gives the same NAME to concepts which are different from each other for the sake of generality, making grave errors of consistency throughout the book.<br />As a basis of comparison, when compared to 'The Elegant Universe' this book is really insignificant, badly written, and the worst of it IS full of factual errors. The author, who himself is not really as qualified as he likes to think, presents to the public only his and his' friends papers - whereas as a public promoter of science he is obliged to give credit when it is due, especially in such a book pretending to contain a 'history' of the developments.<br />In short, this book is a scientists scheme to attract attention (thus funding) to his area of research, and itself is of very little importance. It's ambiguous, presents conjectures as if they were facts, and is giving a history twisted on purpose. Two stars - and just because there are books around even worse than this one.<br />If you'd really like to learn what's going on, read a decent textbook, and brush-up your HS math - then will come a better understanding and a deeper appreciation. Instead of awe as a result of brainwashing.

B00006RU5B|5.0|Audioslave may be a new band for some people but I have listened to rage and soundgarden since I was 10 years old (now 16).  And with both of them combined they are unstopable.  With Chris Cornells pure rock n roll voice, and Tom Morello's genius gutar writing, and Tim and Brad's great sense of music thay are the best band going.  Tom Morello is the best guitarist since the Great Jimi Hendrix (r.i.p.).  I am very glad that a real band with real music, that by the way they write thereselves.  I can't believe they are not No. 1 on the billboard.
B000002LCK|5.0|I don't know how many copies of this CD I've went through just from overplaying. I probably haven't put this on in a year or two but man this is such a great CD.<BR>When you listen to the drivel of today you can really appreciate what these guys did.<BR>If you don't own this buy it. If your into the new techno sounding stuff today buy this CD for a history lesson. Or just for an all out good music.

B00005JKCH|5.0|And his movie is bar none the best comic book movie.  Superman, X-men, Batman, Spawn... this one blows them away.  It has his best enemy as well.  The Green Goblin.  When I saw this movie the first time, I almost cried because the effects are that good.  The cinematography is something to behold.  Definitely, the best comic movie ever.  Until Spiderman Returns...
B000002UAR|5.0|Is it possible to create an album better than Rubber Soul? You would think the Fab's would have felt pressure to keep up the quality, but if they did, it sure doesn't show. It seems Rubber Soul was simply a warm up for Revolver, arguably the greatest album of all time. <BR>The band continue to weave excellent pop songcraft with originality and versatility. They make this stuff look easy, and the immediate accessibily of the disc can cause listeners to overlook the tinges of studio experimentation that was slowly creeping into their work. Most think of Sgt Pepper's as the band's first 'studio' album, but it should be noted that while The Beatles were still touring at the time of this album's release, they did not perform a single song from it in concert.<BR>The songs range from straight pop/rock (And Your Bird Can Sing), political satire (Taxman, George Harrison's first classic), a classically-inspired ballad (Eleanor Rigby, with poetically haunting lyrics), Motown-tinged pop (Got To Get You Into My Life), singalong kids' songs (Yellow Submarine) and pre-Industrial, tape looped freak outs (Tomorrow Never Knows).<BR>Every song sounds different from the one before it, yet they all combine and work like a well-oiled machine. This album marked a turning point for the band, and more importantly, for rock music, as the Beatles were helping forge new ground, pushing the envelope of 'pop' into 'rock'. From its compelling cover to its amazing production, Revolver never ceases to amaze.<br />This is an essential album for any music fan.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|This movie was a very pleasant surprise.<br />When this was initially released in theaters, I didn't quite know what to make of the trailers.  It appeared to be a movie about some kid haunted by a scary-looking giant bunny, sort of a demented \\"Harvey\\" as though directed by Alfred Hitchcock.  I was intrigued.  Unfortunately, I never got around to going to see it in a theater, so when I saw it at my local video store, I snatched it up, having very little idea of what to expect.<br />What I saw was a solidly entertaining, thought-provoking, unique and thoroughly original sci-fi time travel tale with very real and believable human conflict (rare for a science fiction flick).  Jake Gyllenhaal (playing the film's title character)-an unusually gifted actor for his age who consistently demonstrates a sense of truthfulness about his work (unlike so many other young actors of his generation, who seem mostly to be more concerned with looking cool and hip than with honing their craft)-gives a great performance, and is sure to have a wonderful future ahead of him.  Virtually the entire cast is an impressive veteran ensemble, all of whom deliver wonderful performances:  Holmes Osborne and Mary McDonnell as Gyllenhaal's parents, alternately worried and amused by their son's eccentric behavior; Katharine Ross (yes THAT Katharine Ross, of such `60s classics as \\"The Graduate\\" and \\"Butch and Sundance,\\" who has unfortunately been all too absent from films since that time) as Gyllenhaal's concerned psychiatrist; Noah Wyle and Drew Barrymore (also the film's executive producer) are perfect as two young liberally minded high school teachers, embattled by a hypersensitive school bureaucracy; and Rachel Winfree gives a flawless performance as a neurotic high school teacher who tries so desperately to teach her students the difference between \\"love\\" and \\"fear\\" on the \\"lifeline.\\"  Jena Malone as Gyllenhaal's love interest gives a very sensitive and well-crafted performance; she forces nothing, and like Gyllenhaal, she should also have quite a career ahead of her.  <br />The most ingenious stroke of casting in this movie, however, is perennial `80s \\"Dirty Dancing\\" icon Patrick Swayze as a cheeseball motivational speaker (a la \\"Up With People\\").  Definitely his finest performance since \\"Road House\\" (har, har).  <br />But the greatest kudos must go to writer-director Richard Kelly (not to be confused with \\"Ally McBeal\\" creator Richard E. Kelly).  It is not easy to craft a sci-fi tale that actually has a believable and compelling element of genuine human drama (George Lucas' stunted and awkward dialogue in his most recent \\"Star Wars\\" epic and the forced, saccharine emotions of M. Night Shyamalan's \\"Signs\\" spring to mind), but Kelly manages to pull it off.  This movie is also part satire, too, offering relevant social commentary without being preachy or obvious.  <br />This movie will surely go on to become a cult classic.
B000069HK2|5.0|I have bought many cd's this year and the one that I think was the best investment has to be The Used debut cd. A lot of people are comparing them to Thursday and bands of that sort, but I dont really see it, I have the Thursday cd and I think The Used's cd just blows theirs out of the water. Bert McCracken's vocals are just so raw and the lyrics are so catchy, I can't see how anyone can not like this cd/the band. The best songs on the cd are ; Maybe Memories, On My Own, and Blue & Yellow. All the songs on the disc are great but those 3 just get stuck in my head. Go to [their website] and read their bio, it gives some song backround for instance Maybe Memories is about Bert's drug dependancy which he kicked. The Used are definately the band of 2002, and will be the band of 2003 with their upcoming tour with Finch.
0060537639|2.0|Having just listened to Menzies on the radio I think that it is important to note a few things.  ONe, his evidence is slim, he claims that European claims to meeting Chinese people  should be taken seriously instead of wishful thinking on their part.  He has produced no significant archaeological information to corroborate his contentions.  THAT SAID, there is little doubt in most historians and geographers of the Americas that parts of the Old World did indeed have contact with the Americas prior to Columbus's voyages.  Basque cod fisherman fished the Grand Banks for hundreds of years before Columbus ventured and indeed their guarded discussions may have inspired him to sail west.  The Norse sailors almost undoubtedly travelled back and forth from the Americas five hundred years (or so) before Columbus.  And, it may well be that the Chinese did indeed reach the Americas prior to Columbus.  What is important to remember and consider, however, is that none of these voyages had the profound ecological and demographic significance of Spanish, Portuguese, and English forays into the Americas.  The earlier voyages seem to have had little impact on native populations save for the possible transfer of some crops (and this is debatable) such as the banana and the coconut.
B000002UAO|5.0|The full expression of The Beatles' growing interest in the folkier side of rock, Rubber Soul stands as the beginning of their more 'serious' phase, but is still as fun as anything they had done up to that point. The balance between serious art and pure asthetic jubilation may be the key to what made these guys so freaking great. I really can't say enough so I will keep it short and sweet.<BR>Where does one start? You have the classics, Norwegian Wood, Drive My Car, Nowhere Man (with one of the most sublime and beautiful Harrison solos ever), Michelle and In My Life. And if that wasn't enough, they throw in some tasty morsels in the form of Think For Yourself, You Won't See Me, The Word, and a Byrds-esque If I Needed Someone. Even the filler is listenable, the Ringo Starr co-written What Goes On, and the album closer, Run For Your Life.<BR>As usual, George Martin was brilliant in his production and really deserves the title of '5th Beatle'.<BR>This is pop/rock 101. Get it. Now.
0375823360|5.0|I loved all three of these wonderful novels.  I owned The Golden Compass for a number of years before I actually read it.  When I picked it up, I inhaled it.  I couldn't put it down.  It was the same with the other two books in the series.  Just because Phillup Pullman writes about the possible dark side to god, doesn't mean that he advocates his downfall.  In fact, God was old and feeble, and being controled by an evil angel.  The whole trilogy goes on the same shelf as Lord of the Rings, Narnia, and Sabriel, Lirael, and Abhorsen.
0316666343|1.0|I am stumped, not only by the popularity of this book, but by numerous critics who have chosen it among the best of 2002.  It is the most maudlin, contrived story I have ever read. Drivel.  Amateurish.  Poorly written.  Cliched.  Over-hyped.  Stunted character development. Tripe.  The book is memorable only because I have been trying so hard to forget it and get beyond my anger with myself for falling for the hype.  I can't believe I made myself finish it.  I have urged others not to begin.
B00000JLWW|1.0|I suppose I was ruined by &quot;A Night to Remember&quot;, the absolutely classic 1958 film version of the wonderful 1953 book about the Titanic disaster.  Anyway, I was forced to suffer through this thing by my husband, who I think rented it only so he could stare at Kate Winslet's physical assets.  I was wretched until the last half hour, when everybody had landed in the water.  I then had the tremendous joy of watching the North Atlantic take Leonardo diCaprio.  I cheered as he slowly died of exposure.  You go, Atlantic!!  I had to go back and rent &quot;A Night to Remember&quot; again, just to clean my mind out.
B000001F3C|4.0|I see U2's career divided into 4 phases: the early years (Boy - War); the political, serious years (Unforgettable Fire - Rattle and Hum); the techno-pop, fun years (Achtung Baby - Pop); and their newest phase, that starts with All That You Can't Leave Behind. This album marks the end of that first phase with an exclamation point. It is a great album.<BR>All of the youthful angst that Bono had been trying to channel on the band's first two discs finds a cohesion here that is only hinted at previously. The lyrics are simultaneously religious, romantic and political, with the lines between all three blurred. It certainly reflects the background of the band, brought up in the atmosphere of strife that Ireland has struggled with for years.<BR>Bono seems to be trying to reconcile these things with balance and introspection throughout War. <BR>The Edge also finds his footing here, as he takes his minimalistic, jangly guitar tones and ethereal landscapes up a notch, blending them here and there with splashes of piano. The rhythm section of bassist Adam Clayton and drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. are not virtuosos, but their playing complements the songs without overpowering them, bringing out the urgency of Bono's passionate wailing vocals.<BR>The production is great, proving that a band can be rootsy without sacrificing contemporary sonic flourishes. This album has a depth and richness that the first two albums lacked.<BR>Individually, the songs are more versatile than their first two albums, and several tracks shine. Starting off the album is the classic Sunday Bloody Sunday. Another classic, New Year's Day, features that irresistable piano line and great bass work. The Refugee is compelling, and Two Hearts Beat As One is interesting, although a bit longer than it should be. Red Light fades in with female vocals and features a nice riff, catchy chorus, and a bit of brass. Surrender builds with a haunting singalong chorus at the end, as the band join in, and is simply wonderful.Finishing off the disc is the pastoral &quot;40&quot;, inspired by the Old Testament Psalm 40. It is far too short, and leaves you wanting more. <BR>This album is a glistening example of what U2 could accomplish. It retains all the basic elements that made the first two discs interesting and takes them somewhere even better. U2 had arrived. An essential album for any fans collection.
B0000039QA|5.0|2pac fans have no business here, they just don't like B.I.G. But really it comes down to preferences, BIG had the illest flow and 2pac was a poet. Now that i got that out of the way Life After Death is in my opinion the Greatest Double disc album, because of one thing versatility. It has about 14 diferent producers, he even mastered the bone thugs flow on \\"notorious thugs.\\" Is it better than \\"Ready to Die\\"?No. Is it more entertaining?Yes.
B00005JKNC|4.0|The Majestic is a sweet little movie. It was released and seemed to have disappeared just as quickly. Directed by Frank Darabont ( The Shawshank Redemption ) and starring Jim Carrey, the movie had very high expectations and it did not quite meet those expectations. The movie was dismissed as not much more than sentimental pap with just about as much depth.<br />Those claims have merit, but they are a bit cynical. Not all movies should be expected to be stoic and serious and have great intellectual depth. The Majestic is not supposed to be that. It is the story of a screenwriter who is in a car accident and awakens on a strange beach without any memory of who he was. The townsfolk who discover him believe Carrey to be Luke, a man who was presumed dead in World War II (the film is set in the early 1950's, around the time of the House Un-American Activities Committee). Peter (Carrey) begins to believe that he is, in fact, Luke and tries to rebuild his life in the town, along with rebuilding Luke's father's movie theater, the Majestic. There is not much conflict since the audience knows that Peter is not really Luke and we know that it is only a matter of time until Peter, and the town, find this out.<br />This is a nice movie that shows the development of Peter's character as he learns who he really is and who he wants to be, and is a nice change of pace from the sex and vulgarity that is so much a part of Hollywood movies today. The Majestic may not be an important movie, but it is a pretty good one.
B00006RU5B|5.0|This is my favorite CD.  Every song is good.  It doesn't sound like either Rage or Soundgarden.  Audioslave is better.  It's that good.
B00006690F|5.0|If Eminem ever comes out with a greatest hits album, all they will have to do is re-press this one and it will sell seven million more copies.  Every single song on this cd is intense, I haven't gotten sick of any song yet and I highly doubt I ever will.<BR>White America - 5/5 a great song, em tells it exactly how it is, and sends a nice message to mrs. cheny and tipper gore at the end<BR>Business - 5/5 one of my favorite songs on the album, em takes a different approach other than the \\"i hate everything\\" scheme and makes a great song, should be his next single.<BR>Cleanin Out My Closet - 5/5 One of the best, not one of my favorites but a great song nonetheless.  He is intense in this one as he sends a message to his loving mother.<BR>Square Dance - 5/5 a song with a great beat, I love this song, he tells it how it is about just about everything in this song.<BR>Soldier - 5/5 Em shows in this song that he isn't going anywhere soon, he is here to stay, and makes a great song saying it.<br />Say Goodbye to Hollywood - 3/5 I didn't really fall in love with this song, but it is nonetheless a good song.<BR>Drips - 5/5 One of my favorites, em and obie tell about the dangers of unprotected sex... in a way that only eminem could.  A truly great song, great beat, great lyrics, it doesnt get better than this.<BR>Without Me - 4/5 This song was overplayed by every single radio station and MTV and BET... they should all be ashamed.  It is a good song though, even though Eminem didnt even want it to be on the album.<BR>Sing For The Moment - 5/5 My 2nd fav. song on the album.  With samples from aerosmith's \\"dream on\\" and eminem lyrics, this song could NOT get any better than it is.  A masterpiece in the history of rap.<BR>Superman - 4/5 A great song.  Em tells about his relationships with the ladies in this one, and I understand he made a video for it.  It is a great song, shouldn't be passed up.. will probably hit #1 on MTV and BET.<BR>Hailie's Song - 5/5 My favorite song on thealbum.  Who knew eminem could SING?  He spills his whole heart into this song, and makes a great song, one of the best I have ever heard.  Hailie is lucky to have him as a father.  Listen to this song every day, you will be a happier person.<BR>When the Music Stops - 3/5 Didnt really like it.  Eminem is better when he is solo, there are too many guest appearances and there isnt even a chorus.  Its more of a freestyle about how they want to stay in the rap game.<BR>Say What You Say - 3/5 Didnt catch on to this one either.  It is still a good song with an appearance by dr. dre.  It tells about people who like to talk [trash] about em and dre.<BR>'Til I Collapse - 5/5 Nate Dogg + Eminem, how could it not be a great song?  Em tells about how he is never going to give up, no matter what the circumstances are.  Nate Dogg makes the song that much better too even tho he is only in the chorus.<BR>My Dad's Gone Crazy - 5/5 Hailie makes an appearance in this song.  I don't know.. its kinda wack to have ur kid in this kinda song when u sing about the WTC and all... but it is still an awesome song.<br />Overall Grade:  5 out of 5<BR>They dont get any better than this<BR>...<BR>GET THIS ALBUM NOW!
B00005JKZT|1.0|Don't be fooled!  All these people saying that \\"The Two Towers\\" followed the original story line - have not read the book!  Or at least they haven't read it since childhood.<br />At almost every turning, this movie bastardized and embellished Tolkien's \\"The Two Towers.\\"  They changed almost everything!  And peter jackson committed a cardinal sin!  He villanized Faramir!  Faramir was one of the most noble characters in \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\"  Aragorn loved him for his true sight and inner strength.  In the movie, Faramir tried to take Frodo and Sam to Gondor!  What?  Where did that come from?  Why did you do that, peter?  Why?  There was no reason for that.  In the book, Faramir did not know about the \\"ring of power,\\" let alone know that Frodo had it.  He only knew that Frodo held something secret and that it was vital and necessary for him to go to Mordor.  He trusted Frodo.<br />Faramir was my favorite character in the whole trilogy (the books).  I walked out after seeing how peter jacksh!t had him portrayed.  I did not see the end, and will not go see the third movie.  I'm ashamed that I joined the fan club.  J. R. R. Tolkien would NEVER have allowed this!<br />Why did peter-eater jackson change the outcome of the Ent-moot?  What purpose was served?  Why change that?  Why?  Why did peter change Eomir's fate?  Eomir didn't turn vagabond - he was imprisoned.  He was released when Theodin was released from Wormtongue's spell.  Eomir was imprisoned for letting Aragorn go and loaning him two horses.  In the movie, Eomir was already an outcast vagabond when he met Aragorn.  Why change that?  What purpose was served?<br />That was only a few instances.  There were many more.  peter jackson can have his movies, but no more of my money.  Thank God I never purchased the DVD!  I'll stick to the books.  They are more than enough.  Hopefully I can find a new edition of hardbacks without peter jackass's movie ... all over the jacket.<br />It's just sad that peter jackson tooka personal advantage over the fact that so many people were clueless to the true storyline.  What a pity that all these people have needlessly been misled.  What will happen when they go back and read the books for the first time?  Will they be disappointed that Tolkien didn't tell it like peter did?  Is that what donkey jackson had in mind?  Probably.  What a cheap trick.<br />Absolutely Disappointed,<br />Gary<BR>Saint Petersburg, FL
B00006LI4S|5.0|I used to think Pink Floyd and Waters were synonimous. Maybe Dave Gilmour was only the super-excellent Roger Water's guitar player. Well...I'm glad I'm proven wrong!!!. After the \\"IN THE FLESH\\" DVD I tought no one else could really express,other than REG, what we -the fans- always knew about Pink Floyd. Clearly and without any pyrotechnia. If you watch this DVD is like rediscovering Pink Floyd and realizing that it is true that Pink Floyd was not about Roger Waters but about the all four fab they were. Defintely like saying The Beatles was McCartney or Lennon. I personally can not immagine The Beatles without Harrison, or Ringo. Of course is unthinkable without the other two. But Gilmour not only shows his virtuosity and his roots, but his humbleness ans human simplicity. He's got the money so he's got the band. (I think all of the performers in this show are virtuosos on their own). I very much appreciate the Pressence of Rick Whright and largely of Micheal Kamen, but as soon as you listen to the whole Ensemble you just say THANK YOU MYSELF FOR BUYING THIS DVD AND MY 5.1 SURROUND!!!!!This is as raw as it can get. Actually you don't even have to be a fan or to know who Pink Floyd are, to enjoy this DVD. Just watch it in a surround enviroment and it will turn into one of the closest to you and most paramount performances you ever heard.

B0000070QN|5.0|Where do you start with something like this? This album is perhaps THE SLEEPER of all time for Hard Rock fans. I only happened to come across it after buying their current release...which is HALF the record that Mood Swings is. Amazing songs from start to finish. This record is in a class of its own. This is a BENCHMARK type of release in terms of production quality,lyrical content as well as the AMAZING musicianship. Sizzling guitar with smooth,strong vocals!<BR> Here is a record that simply came out during a real down period for melodic hard rock and thus NEVER got the fanfare or praise it TRULY DESERVED. If you like this type of music and are considering this record....PUSH 'ORDER NOW'...IMMEDIATELY!! Thank me later.
B00006RIO7|5.0|I just saw the movie on January 10th and while I haven't listened to the soundtrack I can't wait to buy it.  The movie was awesome and it's stars did an amazing job.  Catherine Zeta-Jones' performance was no big surprise, but you'll be amazed at Renee Zellweger's performance.  Two Thumbs Up!
B00006RIO7|3.0|I just got the soundtrack today and am kind of disappointed with the CD because it lacks the original play's funny sense of humor plus missing are some great songs not included in the film.<BR>If you are going to adapt a musical play, please use all the songs as they are all needed to incorporate the story.<BR>I have seen the movie three times and highly recommend the film but felt cheated that the some songs from the show are deleted.<BR>However everyone sounds good enough, but if you want the real thing, get the cast show album instead.It is soooooooo much better. The movie however is very sexy and hot. The men are especially sexy dancers, which makes this boy happy.
B00000DHZJ|1.0|Jimi can do a lot better than this, evan though half his albums contain music that he's already done.
B00005YW4H|3.0|I'm not going to be a Norah-hater and give this one star, but please, folks, if you want to listen to a good jazz singer, you've come to the wrong place. Sure, the CD is easy on the ears, kind of dreamy, and Norah's delivery has interest (I actually thought of a young - and better - Rickie Lee Jones at times!), but Billie Holiday? Put Lady Day on and compare for yourself. No comparison. So maybe Norah has some potential if her next effort attempts true jazz feeling and swing.<br /> In the meantime, check out some great contemporary jazz singers like Meredith d'Ambrosio, Tierney Sutton, Diane Hubka and the late Susannah McCorkle. You'll be happier for it.
B000002C1V|5.0|it is just a peice of work that came mostly from the wall, however none of the songs are the same, and this album does have some good cuts on it, even though this album is how roger waters [messed] up the band.
6304913176|5.0|Knowing Paul Verhoeven's films are a little pervy but this is just plain brilliance. Sex, gore and whole lot more is what you get from this film. Now that doesn't sound like much but given Verhoeven's trademark cynical humour....it all adds up to be one great movie

B000002L7G|5.0|I can remember listening to this on my parents record player when i was 4 yrs old an thinking this &quot;Wow&quot;! this is one of those types of albums where ever song is one you love, From heartache, to love, to the sadness of war, brothers in arms is a magnum opus in its own right. here in my own words is an anology of all the songs<br />1. So far away- opening  up with just a simple drum/bass beat, this song makes us all think about the way it feels when the one you love is not withing your reach. This is one of the earliest DS songs that I remember. but the simple message in this bluesy, <BR>bittersweet masterpiece is that when the one you love is far away, it is pure torture.<br />2. Money for nothing- This hard-rocker starts out with Sting singing very softly &quot;i want my, i want my mtv.&quot; and continues on into the one guitar riff that almost everyone knows. This is a kind of song where you can turn up the volume LOUD and rock out to!<br />3. Walk of life- This cheerful number is about the way ordinary people life very different lives, but have the same object in  life<br />4 Your Latest Trick- this jazzy,romantic track makes you imagine a smoky bar with a saxophonist et al playing in a dimly lit room in the early hours. BEAUTIFUL.<br />5. Why Worry- This gentle lullabye is a man comforting his love <BR>that everything is ok, i'm here. This is a song that has cheered me up in times of need. listen to this when you need to cheer up.<br />6. Ride Across the river- This song is a flighty, almost exotic <BR>sounding song about soldiers and the way that they survive.<br />7. The Man's Too Strong- This song is the sad confessions of an old man who has broken the law, lost love and wasted his life.<BR>Quite interesting.<br />8. One World- this rock/bluesy song is about being frustrated and unfulfilled, wanting a change.<br />9. Brothers in Arms<BR>The classic track that makes me reflect every time. This song is about the truth, and sadness of war. and a perfect way to end a perfect album<br />DON'T WASTE TIME GET IT NOW
B00005QDW5|5.0|This is an amazing greatest hits album by the greatest band in the world.
B000002N3N|5.0|While I believe that &quot;Watermark&quot; was the best of her works overall, &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot; features some delightful offerings as well. &quot;China Roses&quot; will always remain one of my favorites.<br />The one, slim, unhappiness that I have, is that the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; movies didn't use Enya's beautiful Lothlorien piece from &quot;Shepard Moons&quot;. I think Enya's wonderful song did more tribute to Tolkien's vision than the movies did.<br />Apologies if you disagree. Just my opinions.<br />Johji
B00005QZWI|5.0|I think &quot;Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of The Ring&quot; is a GREAT CD. The music is well composed. I really like the song at the end of the CD called &quot;May It Be&quot; performed by Enya. I love the music as well as the words. It's a great song. If you liked to movie, then you need the soundtrack. I listen to this music when I'm on the computer all the time on our music downloader. I just bought this CD at Best Buy today along with the &quot;Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot; CD. If you have the first one, I also recommend the second one! Happy listening!
B0000203YT|4.0|When Shakespeare In Love swept the board at the Oscars, it was more than a little surprising, not least because it was an intelligent and learned and decidedly un-American piece of filmmaking.  Not celebrated with the bombast of previous Oscar-winners there were more than a few puzzled questions as to why such a movie won so many awards.  The simple answer is that it is brilliant, a dazzling example of what the romantic comedy should be and something that will take you quite by surprise.  The story concerns Will Shakespeare (Fiennes) as he struggles to write a new play, Romeo and Ethel, The Pirate's Daughter.  He only finds his inspiration though when Lady Viola dresses herself as a man to win the lead in the production and steals the playwright's heart.<br />Rather than simply being a cheap gimick where love again proves to conquer all, the story of the two young lovers draws innumerable parallels with the play itself.  As Viola is set to marry Lord Wessex (Firth) and Will is already married himself, the romance not only seems but is in fact doomed, and so the play moves from the light comedy and farce to something far more tragic and ultimately more affecting.  It's not often that it is the intelligence of the script that bowls you over about a movie, but Shakespeare In Love is one such rare example.  Anyone familiar with the play will notice several direct quotations of the play coming from Will and Viola's mouths and the parallels are so cleverly drawn it's a marvel.  In this kind of situation it would have been all too easy to go all the way and have the lovers die, but the tragedy of their separation proves to be upsetting enough.  Indeed, where have Shakespeare's themes of eternal love and self-sacrifice been any more universally evoked than here.  And it is in this universitality that the film achieves its goals, because you can identify with the lovers when they separate in a way that it is impossible to identify with the fairytale of Romeo and Juliet's deaths.<br />But by praising the script it is by no way to undermine the acting here.  Fiennes is great, full of brooding intensity and genius as Shakespeare, gradually moulded by the experience portrayed in the movie.  Paltrow again proves that she is one of the most luminous actresses of her generation in another literary adaptation to complement her startling turn as Estella in Great Expectations and no doubt her forthcoming portrayal of Sylvia Plath in Ted and Sylvia.  Dench is also very impressive in an Oscar-winning turn that lasted all of 8 minutes, yet even more surprising is that up-and-coming Ben Affleck doesn't seem out of place as a vain young actor who plays the part of Mercutio.<br />This is the kind of intelligent movie that you wish there was more of, but as it is this is a quite startling film that is at the same time unassuming and subtle.  Never going over the top yet managing to create a firm reaction in its audience this is, quite simply, alongside Luhrman's version, one of the best Shakespeare adaptations of the 90's.
B0000646UN|5.0|This movie is a must see for any WWII buff.  It shows how the Soviet Union forced Finland into WWII and the brave defense of Finland by a small poorly outfitted force.  See how Finland managed to rout the Soviet army and retain its independence, unlike its baltic neighbors.
B00005ATQI|4.0|Realised as a masterpiece of its genre, The Shining incorporates everything a horror movie should have and then some.  Telling the story of Jack Torrance's rapid descent into madness and homicidal impulses towards his family as they look after the Overlook Hotel during the winter, it's very effective in telling its story.  Seeing ghosts and growing more and more unhinged, Jack's character is perfectly balanced by that of his son Danny, who has 'the shining', a rare gift which allows him psychic powers and an insight into the history of the creepy hotel.<br />As the lead character, Jack Nicholson is about as close to perfect as you can possibly be, and in such a movie it would be easy to solely concentrate on him.  However, thanks to the winning performances by Duvall as his wife and that of the child Danny, we are also made to worry for the safety of his family.  Duvall's wide-eyed performance is masterful, implying not only innocence and vulnerability but also the cold determination to protect her son.  The boy who plays Danny is also immensely talented in a role today that would seem tailor-made for Haley Joel Osmont.  His terror and innocence are emphasised to the max, although interestingly enough the actor never continued a career in film-making.<br />Many people have criticised The Shining due to the fact that it isn't very faithful to the book.  Scenes such as the hedge animal attack aren't included and there's a completely different ending.  However, both are really excellent in their own way and if Kubrick's film isn't a by the letter adaptation of Stephen King's novel then it at least follows it in spirit.  The grim and gory hallucination and psychic vision scenes are genuinely horrific, in particular the woman who rises from the bathtub only for Jack to realise that she's dead.  Many of these have become a much-parodied part of pop culture, especially the lift that opens with a gush of blood, and rightly so too.  This is generally regarded as one of Kubrick's best films, and it probably is.  It's original, scary, disturbing and brilliantly acted.  Not only that but it's an adult horror picture, a genre that is so few and far between that it has all but become extinct.
B00005JKZ3|1.0|Without question, this is one of the sloppiest, cheapest-looking, witless films (let alone sequels) ever produced.  First of all, what were Smith, Jones and Sonnenfeld thinking when they approved this tired script?  Don't these pics spend years in development?  This is the best that anyone could come up with?  And the effects!  There might as well be strings attached to the spaceships.  This is the kind of film that gives sequels a really bad name -- and in this case, deservedly so.  Abominable!
B0000640VO|5.0|I was sckeptical about loving this movie, because I'm not a big chick-flick fan. But when I saw this movie, I just fell in love all over again. This movie will not make you cry, but it will make you laugh out loud and will move your heart.  This movie now tops my list of best movies ever! Beautiful cinematography and music as well. Vive la France!! C'est belle!
B00004X01U|3.0|Have you ever gotten the impression something is ok but could definitely have been better?<BR>This album to me is the demonstration...<BR>MUSIC is a great dance track.<BR>DON'T TELL ME shows once again the genius in the lady in bringing together the cowboy theme and the electronic stuff.<BR>WHAT IT FEELS LIKE FOR A GIRL is a splendid ballad built up on synthsizers.<BR>GONE is so emotioonally charged that you can't help but fall in love with it.<BR>PARADISE NOT FOR ME is very dark and haunting, beautiful as FROZEN.<BR>It's the rest of the album i cannot relate to...the voxcoder is used even more than with Cher! The electronica pours out of the CD in tons...some acoustic guitars are not enough.<BR>The woman has talent and likes to change and try different styles. <BR>I really hope the next one will be something that will take the world by surprise once again...maybe country or rock? <BR>That would be a real knockout!
0446677450|2.0|Some what dissatisfied with this book, the primary thesis is to become an independent business person.  It did not present a balanced views of the risks.
B00005JL78|5.0|Minority report is a fantastic movie. The whole idea about pre crime is absolutely fantastic. The story revolves around Tom Cruise and the world of pre crime, which means they arrest the suspects before they even commit they crime. Pre crime has what they call pre-cognitives who sees the crime before it actually happens. Tom Cruise was seen as one of the suspects by the pre-cogs. To make things short, he looks for his minority report (a false pre-cognitive perception) to save his life and find out what truly happened in his past. With all the computerized animations in movies, it's hard for people to get impressed but with this movie, the story has a very excellent twist that will leave the audience boggled.
B000002B7O|5.0|All the songs on this album are great, from 1 to 8. If someone want s to argue he/she must be outta their minds. It is great, fantastic, and unexplainable. Especially, the last song \\"Diary Of A Madman\\" rocks the planet. At least this one is better than those cheesy new bands album. Ozzy is able to bit every member of Linkin Park's heads off. All in all, my advise get this album and you won't regret it.
B000063UR1|4.0|As science fiction should be, Silent Running is powerful metaphor, making the viewer (or at least this one) question the wisdom of our society, then flipping the questions inside out. It's profoundly sad in a mature way. Definitely goes on the shelf with the Planets of the Apes and Logan's Run.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I cannot say enough good things about this movie, it is without a doubt the finest film I have ever seen (sorry Citizen Kane). It is important for those who have not seen the film to understand that this isn't a kill them all type film. This film has a fantastic story, compelling characters, and a soundtrack that Mozart would be proud of. The music should have gotten the best supporting actor, because it completely captures the emotions of the characters, especially Maximus.  The \\"earthy\\" theme that Hans describes in the bonus documentary on this DVD is what I refer to as the \\"victory\\" song.  It is played when he is praying, but it also comes about when the group wins its first fight in Rome during the \\"Battle of Carthage\\" at a much higher tempo.  Those that criticize the ending as being sad, I ask this question (warning, spoiler here) Why is is a sad ending?  Maximus got to be with his family at the end of the movie, which was his goal at the beginning, he got what he wanted.  There was an afterlife, therefore, there is no reason to be sad about it. It's a victory for him. This is a true epic,  I could go on for days.  Buy this DVD if you do not own it yet, it will be something to show future generations. (I still shed a tear at the end when they carry him, not because I am sad, but because of the respect and honor they give him. Honor- a word we in the modern world seem to have forgotten) Enough soapboxing, get the film!
B00005RFAI|5.0|Well i'll just say I hate rockish and punkish music. 3 days ago i went into a music store needing some new tunes when i just noticed everything that i wanted. I already have like Christina Aguilera's \\"Stripped\\", Aaliyah's \\"I Care 4 U\\", Mariah Carey's \\"Charmbracelet\\", which are all albums you should buy. Also don't buy J. Lo's \\"This Is Me... Then\\", I was so dissapointed. Well anyways for some reason i bought Avril Lavigne's \\"Let Go\\" and Pink's \\"M!ssundaztood\\" just to listen since a lot of people recommended them. I got home and listened to \\"Let Go\\" first which is a great album and not so punkish. Then i popped \\"M!ssundaztood\\" in my CD player and it was so surprising. I have her first album \\"Can't Take Me Home\\" which i only listen to 3 songs on there but on this album it gets personal and these songs are really her. I should have bought this the day it came out it is so great even though i usually listen to R&B and Hip-Hop. I never really liked the singles except for \\"Just Like A Pill\\" but as the number of times listening the whole album i luv the whole thing. Here are ratings.<br />1. M!ssundaztood : 9/10 A very catchy song.<br />2. Don't Let Me Get Me : 8.5/10 I've always hated this song buts its ok now.<br />3. Just Like A Pill : 10/10 A perfect song with no flaws. One of my favorite song off the album!<br />4. Get The Party Started : 8/10 An OK song.<br />5. Respect : 9/10 A funny song to me. Very catchy.<br />6. 18 Wheeler : 9.5/10 One of my favorite songs. Very inspiring.<br />7. Family Portriat :  8/10 Another OK song.<br />8. Misery : 6/10 The worst song on the album but ok.<br />9. Dear Diary : 10/10 One of my favorites. <br />10. Eventually : 8.5/10 An alright song.<br />11. Lonely Girl : 9/10 A Great song with Linda Perry.<br />12. Numb ; 9/10 A great song.<br />13. Gone To California : 7/10 one of my least favorites.<br />14. My Vietnam : 9/10 Great Song<br />Overall M!ssundaztood is a great pop/rock album or one of the greatest. Also get the ones i mentioned that are good!
B000002KKS|5.0|I've had this album since it was new in 1979, and song for song it IS the &quot;Best Metal Album of all Time!&quot;<BR>Ozzy left the group and was replaced by Ronnie James Dio(Elf, Rainbow), whose 4 octave voice, and sword and sorcery lyrics blended perfectly with Sabbath's fine musicianship.(anybody who has seen them live will attest to that)<BR>Bring in &quot;Uber Producer&quot; Martin Birch, (Deep Purple, Maiden, Rainbow)and the result is a song for song delight for any fan of this genre
0156012197|5.0|I bought this book for my son when he was about 10 years old.  If i remember right he and i worked on writing a book review of this book for school and the book broadened his mind.  I think I still have this book.
0446678430|1.0|I have been a reader of Kiyosaki for quite some time. Yet I've learned that this book is fiction. I have read in numerous places that there is no evidence whatsoever to substantiate any of Kiyosaki's past businesses or even the existence of a rich dad. He has refused to comment when questioned about it. I didn't believe it, until I took a look at the copyright page: Although based on a true story, certain events in the book have been fictionalized for educational content and impact.
0553274503|4.0|Flowers for Algernon is a deeply touching novel. The story centers around its main character, Charlie Gordon. In the beginning of the book Charlie is selected as the human experiment that will undergo an operation to increase his intelligence. After much testing, the operation is completed. This determined and courageous hero will go through struggles in the areas of love, education, and self-understanding. You will feel what Charlie feels as he goes from challenged to intelligent, but don't get to comfortable. This story has an unexpected ending that will leave you wishing better for the characters. I highly recommend this novel to anyone fascinated with the human condition.
B00005M989|5.0|Even though this album includes only the biggest hits by Prince, every fan should still own it. This album should have another song on it, maybe &quot;Delirious&quot; or &quot;7&quot;, but it's a good way to hear how Prince evolved over the years. It's so hard to get all of his hits in one place, and the The Hits/The B-Sides is a great set but hard to listen to all at once. So while you need The three disc set, you need this too.
1556154844|5.0|I have been working as a software engineer for close to seven years, and have read many books on programming and software engineering.  This is without a doubt the BEST book I have read about programming and software engineering that I have ever read.  It is absolutely required reading for anyone that will be involved in writing code, reading code, or even working close to people involved with code.<br />This book is as close to perfect as you can get.  I refer to this book very often, especially when an arguement comes up at work about how you supposed to do something.  Just this week I referred to it about how the best way to conduct a code walkthrough is.  The book pointed out several things that my group was doing wrong.  Implementing some of the ideas in this book helped to make our code reviews more efficient.<br />I really like the examples and humor in the book.  The writing is clear, and to the point.  While quite a large book, it is both a page turner, and a great reference.  Well organized, and to the point.  I cannot say enough about how wonderful this book is.  If I ever become a software manager I will buy a copy for every person on my team.
B0000844IT|5.0|How many times can they release the same Evil Dead movies over and over? Only God knows.  At least this one has both the original and director's cut.  ALSO IMPORTANT NOTE: ...is selling only one of these that comes with a free dinner with (GOD) Bruce Campbell!!!!  Let's see if this version has anything unique that the previous versions didn't have. Doesn't matter to me, I'm in line to purchase this NOW!!!
B00005JKZT|5.0|Gandolf and the heroes are back to fight against the evil of saruman and Frodo and Samwise are making their way to the land of mordor with Golem. Marrie and Pippin Fight against saruman on Treebread with other treebreads at their side. A story that will keep you guessing what will happen in the next one.
B00005V9IK|4.0|Independence Day is a really good movie. It shows the strength of the human spirt. The human's in this movie were able to win against all odds. There is a lot of action in this movie and some funny moments as well. If you like Science Fiction and Will Smith then this is a movie for you.
B0000041CZ|5.0|Remarkable recording of Bach's WTC. The fugues in D sharp minor and F minor alone warrants the price of the cd's. They're absolutely breathtaking in the slow tempo Gulda chooses (which he usually does for the minor key fugues). This is not a harsh recording as some may say; just listen to the preludes in C major and A flat major. SOME preludes may seem a little rough compared to other interpreters' versions, but Gulda uses his &quot;attack mode&quot; with sense and only when it fits the music. (Not like Gould with his inadequately fast tempos). Sound quality: superb. Do not miss this one. And by the way, Book II is just as good.
B00006RU5B|5.0|The best album since 1995, Chris Cornell and the remaining members of R.A.T.M. fuse the lyrical swagger and classic rock influences of early 90's grunge with one of the most rock-solid rythym sections on earth + Tom Morello's stylistic and innovative playing that seems to defy genre classification. Great songs, great musicianship, great chemistry. Think &quot;modern day Led Zepplin&quot; only funkier (thanks to the Rage rythym section of Tim Commerford and Brad Wilk) The old school is back biatch.
B00003CXQY|5.0|Emperor Kuzco is a spoiled brat and has been since birth.  His will is supreme in his kingdom, and all who interfere with his life are punished immediately.  When he catches the royal advisor doing his job for him, he quickly fires her.  But Yzma doesn't take it easily and hatches a plan to poison the emperor.  This doesn't quite work, however, and Kuzco is turned into a llama.  Accidentally taken out of town, he finds his only hope of regaining his kingdom is to work with the peasant whose village he's just threatened to destroy.<br />This movie is a comedy in the truest sense of the word.  I laugh so hard every time I see this movie, as does everyone I see it with.  There are many one-liners in the movie and in Kuzco's voice over.  And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the hilarity that Kronk adds as Yzma's dim-witted assistant.  His scenes with his shoulder angel and demon are priceless.<br />As always, Disney does it right for this 2 disc collector's edition.  The film looks sharp in its widescreen aspect ratio and sounds wonderful.  And there are so many special features you can spend hours learning about this movie and animation in general.  Of special note is the information about \\"Kingdom of the Sun,\\" the original story that was gutted and turned into this gem.<br />Critics were harsh on this film, and I must admit that I didn't appreciate it the first time.  But on rewatching, my love for this movie has definitely grown.  I highly recommend it for those times when you need to forget everything and laugh.  It'll have you smiling again in no time.
0844663662|4.0|Kurt Vonnegut shows me the reason that this book is considered as one of the greatest pieces of literatture of all time. He sets the main caracter (Billy Pilgrim) as a soldier in World War II. From there he tells the adventures that Billy goes through. Som events are from Billy's real life and opther ar from Billy's imagination. These events mixed wioth Vonnegut's dark humor leave you lauging continuously throughout the book. Yet at times I felt bad for the pain that World War II cause Billy to experience. This is an awesome book and I would recommend it to anyone thatis interested in literature.

B00005JLCI|5.0|Well as if Much Ado About Nothing, Henry V, and Othello weren't enough, Kenny B (my affectionate nickname) has done it again in this astounding version of Hamlet. The only existing full lenth as in, verse by verse, movie to commemorate Shakespeare's original vision, this movie is amazing. The passion delivered by Branagh is as usual phenomenal and breathtaking. Plus being sided with such a wonderful accompanying cast, how can you go wrong???? The scenery is so appropriate for all the many themes of this play, color was done perfectly along with timing, plot, and costume design. For once, Hamlet does not have an Oedipus complex (trust me, that's a good thing). There were interpretations of the text that could not have been any more on target if Shakespeare himself had been directing. Branagh's portrayal of the ghost was a bulls-eye, mixing the perfect concoction of fear and tenderness to both endear the audience to his plight and keep him intimidating enough so they would not lose sight that he was indeed a ghost. I cannot recommend this movie enough.
B000063CPL|5.0|A great live 2-CD set. Nearly as good as LAD but that one is a classic. This is still a must have for any Maiden fan! Glad to hear Bruce D. back on vocals and Adrian Smith on guitar. Yeah the guys are older now but they can still rock on stage! In one word---AWESOME!
B000001IQH|5.0|After only having it for certainly no more than a year, this CD has become a sort of gem in my quickly growing and about 80-strong CD collection which ranges from At the Drive-in to Jurassic 5 to Pearl Jam to Zebrahead. I can't say I like everything in it, though. I've never even been a huge fan of \\"punk music\\", and as of this writing I certainly can't say I can. This album simply rules. It's unquestionably my favorite of the at least 30 \\"punk\\" albums I've heard in my life. It's not really the individual songs, many of which are surely filler--the disc clocks in at 19 tracks and 49 minutes. The whole feel, groove, and attitude of the band deos it: every time I listen, I'm still sitting in that car, crammed in with too many bags, my MP3 player, and my trusty headphones, and I'm pissing off my sister next to me. I can't really describe the... nostalgia(?) that's settled in after such a short time, but I've definitely played the ... out of this thing!<br />This sure isn't great music, but it rules. Want some catchy tunes? Want to hear more punk? Want to hear more music? Want to buy a CD? This album gets my recommendation, but please, just buy it. Just to say you have and make me happy. For Emusic subscribers, this CD as well as most of Rancid's efforts are available through their service. And when you do get the CD, don't be afraid to rock out like you're still in middle school!
B00005N9CV|5.0|The more I listen to this CD the better I like it. When I need some soothing, easy listening music I reach for this CD. If you are not aquainted with Diana Krall this is a great CD to get introduced. Order this CD now, you'll be very glad you did!
B00005JL7Q|5.0|This movie is great. After seeing this movie, I felt so happy and full of joy. This movie is going to be very special to me now. I love it. There is no other movie like it. It shows you there is more to life then you could imagine. I am going to be an actor soon and also, by the time I am 40, I will be living in London England, and after seeing this movie, I know I will get there. It also made me even want to act MORE and it even made me want to go to England MORE too. I hope in the near future, I can make a film as good as this one. I LOVE THIS MOVIE. It kind of inspire me. It is also very funny. Anyone and everyone should buy About A Boy. GO GET THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!! (ALSO, buy Badly Drawn Boy who sang and also made a album for this movie. A VERY GREAT ARTIST!!)
B00005QDW1|5.0|This is a well done peace of art there are some slow spots in the traks but over all a good buy.
B00000JGHM|5.0|I am surprised that none of the reviews I read picked up on this, and perhaps you have to chase bad guys to get an appreciation for it, but this movie depicts the cop's disadvantages in catching these robbers. The cops life is turned up side down and is out of control much like the life you might expect a drug dealer to have, his daughter commits suicide, his wife takes him or leaves him, he gets no respect, his abode is trashy, has limited resources, all he has is his determination to catch a thief with superior means and intellect. Deneiro (the thief) is calm and colleted, disciplined, hardly ever breaks a sweat, always has a backup plan, has endless resources, his abode is luxurious and he finds love. He wears white, he is the good guy! Who has scruples and who doesn't? After knowing the characters, who would you believe in a court of law the cop or the thief? It blurs the lines between good guy and bad guy. It is an excelent film and never realized it was 3 hours. Character development is fascinating and very realistic. It reverses the traditional \\"movie cop\\" roles by having the cop react emotionally (like being cornered & panicked) and the robber react cerebrally (not cornered nor panicked). See it!
B0000640VO|5.0|I'm not always a fan of French movies, but I thought Amelie was great!  Amelie is the story of a troubled and lonely girl in Paris who, with the help of various people around her, begins to turn her life around.  Although the movie has serious undertones, it is very comical - the writer uses simple satire to enhance the movie's entertainment value.  Not only do I enjoy the storyline, but I also like the way it \\"looks\\" - each scene is colorful and fun (kind of like Moulin Rouge).  Other than a couple sex scenes where there isn't much nudity, the film is also very clean.  Definitely see Amelie if you're a fan of intelligent, well-written European films!
0064471837|5.0|This is probably one of the best books i have ever read. My daughter bought it and told me i HAD to read it, grudgingly i obliged, fantasy is not one of my favorite things to read. I would highly reccomend this book to anyone over 12, or someone with a higher reading level, it is deffinatly hard to follow, but well worth the struggle!
B00005OAIE|3.0|I agree John Mayer is a killer musician.  His songs aren't easy to play by any means.  And I'd also agree he's a great songwriter.. One of those album's lyrics that stick with you and you can really relate to. (My stupid mouth, Love song for no one, ect.) But, I hated the cd. I have all of the songs downloaded off the internet, and the majority of them are acoustic and live.  When I heard the CD tracks, or when I hear it in somebody's car it makes me want to turn it off.  Yet the cd I burnt of his live acoustic stuff doesn't leave my cd player.  You can really feel this album and John hearing the acoustic and I definately think he should put out an album of his live stuff.  Room for Squares seriously doesn't compare.
B0000508U6|4.0|The first time I heard the song &quot;Yellow&quot;, I could've sworn it was the Dave Matthews Band. A few months later, I found out it wasn't DMB, but a band called &quot;Coldplay&quot;. Meh..whatever, I thought. To be honest, I wasn't too fond of the song. Then, another few months later, I saw the video for &quot;Trouble&quot;, and I thought both the song AND video were respective works of art. I went out and bought the CD, not really knowing what to expect, and was pleasantly surprised. Now, I'll go track by track to elaborate..<br />It opens up with &quot;Don't Panic&quot;, which is short, but SWEET. A very gentle, beautiful uplifting song with a catchy chorus that assures us, &quot;We live in a beautiful world.&quot; 9/10<br />The second track, &quot;Shiver&quot;, is an AMAZING song. Definetly my favorite song on the album. This is a powerful song, with a can't miss chorus, and some awesome guitar work. 10/10<br />On &quot;Spies&quot;, the tempo slows down a bit. This song may take a few listens to really get into, unlike the previous two, but it's another really beautiful song. 8/10<br />&quot;Sparks&quot; is another slower paced song, with a melancholy tone. 7/10<br />Then comes the song that put Coldplay on the map, &quot;Yellow&quot;. I'm sure you've heard it before. The funny thing is, I didn't like the song before I bought this album, but now I love it. A classic love ballad. 10/10<br />Next up is &quot;Trouble&quot;, the reason I bought this album. Definetly the best slower paced song on the album. Tremendous piano work too. 10/10<br />The title track, &quot;Parachutes&quot; follows. Blink and you'll miss it. A simple, 45 second accoustic song. But there's something about it that makes the band expanded upon it more, into a full song. Oh well. Can't go very high here, just due to the length. 4/10<br />&quot;High Speed&quot; is another one of the best songs of the album. I would say it's the most experimental sounding of any of them, but in a really cool way. 9/10<br />&quot;We Never Change&quot; is another slow, melancholy song like &quot;Spies&quot; and &quot;Sparks&quot;. It's almost a little too slow for its own good, so I can't say it's one of my favorite songs on the album. 7/10<br />Finally, there's &quot;Everything's Not Lost&quot;, an excellent ballad to close the album. As you can tell from the title, it's a really upbeat song, and really catchy as well. I think it could've been a pretty big radio hit, but it's too late for that. 10/10<br />Tons of great songs on here, and easliy worth the money. Although I must say, Coldplay totally outdid this effort with their most recent album, &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot;. Still, &quot;Parachutes&quot; is highly recommended listening to anyone who enjoys well written music.
B00003CX8Y|1.0|When I bought Disney's Beauty and the Beast \\"Special Platinum Edition\\" I was expecting just that, a high quality film with added extras not contained on the original.  Instead, what I found myself with was a tampered work of art, a disgraced former masterpiece.  The entire movie looks like it has had it's color stripped from it and repainted with bargain bin paints.  No longer are there rich colors, sharp contrasts, and beautiful sceney, but now the film looks worse than it's straight to video sequel. The cover looks great, that's what the film used to look like, but the actual DVD is no where near that good looking.  Some of the animation looks like it has had some of its detail removed and when I was watching it seemed like some of the frame rate was reduced because of the sluggish movement of the characters mouths when speaking.  It is a completely different movie and I have since returned my copy and stuck with my original release.  Some of the games and extra features are interesting and entertaining, but that's really like saying a TV show was awful, but there was a funny commercial here and there.  I wish Disney would stop messing around with their work and just leave it the way we all saw it and loved it in the theaters.  Walt would have never let something like this leave the studio if he were still running it, and that's the bottom line.
B00005UEAR|4.0|I have been a huge DT fan for a while now, and have heard pretty much all of their previous material. I had some pretty high expectations from 6doit, and when i first heard it, i though it met, or even exceeded those expectations. However, after listening to it 3 days straight (or something like that), i found that I no longer liked a lot of it as much. Moral - it's good, but a lot of the originality (we're talking prog standards here) and the stuff that makes the hair on the back of your neck stand on end was missing.  <br />Some tracks were extremely cool...Misunderstood, Solitary shell to name a couple. Worth a buy if you like DT already, and don't mind something a little off the usual DT track.<br />Oh yes, that 40 min thing - is that really ONE song?? I think that if it were, then all of SFAM should be one song too!

0671015206|5.0|This book is not the average inspirational RAH! RAH! type of book.  It goes beyond that in delivering REAL DATA in the REAL WORLD today.  If you are trying to keep up with the Jones, don't.  They probably have everything mortgaged to the hilt!  You will find yourself as POOR as they truly are.  If you really want to know how to become WEALTHY - read this book.
B000001FFR|5.0|This is the most fun Anthrax album.   Melodic hooks abound in these fast, catchy tunes.  All of the songs are great, but Stand Or Fall is my personal favorite.  This one will slap a big grin on your face!  Good times...good times...
0316666343|5.0|This was a wonderful book, I have read the other comments and it is obvious that the people who gave this book a one star are use to reading comic books.<BR>I don't remember the last time I had so much emotion while reading a book, I cried, I laughed and I got excited.  I felt as though I was in the story as well.  It took me a good two days to finish this book and it was worth every minute.
B000002H97|3.0|Those of us who grew up on the 'real' Metallica sound were thrown by this one.  No thrash or speed or tempo craziness or any other thing that was a Metallica trademark up to this point is to be found here.  Still, as much as we wanted to hate this album, we all bought it, and even liked it.  It spawned top-40 hits, which we early fans weren't used to.  Non-metal types were at the concerts, which we early fans weren't used to.  This one took a lot of getting used to.  Our biggest fear was that Metallica would completely abandon their 'old' sound, and unfortunately this happened.  No more Lightning, no more Kill 'Em All, and tragically, no more Puppets.  Yea, you heard me Lars, I said PUPPETS!
B000001Y2U|5.0|Despite what onw could say about the questionable sound quality, production, and mixing, (It's an acquired taste.) this is undoubtedly one of the most important albums ever made in the history of commercial music, despite being obscured by a society trying to protect itself from it (ignorantly). <BR>   True, it's not the darkest thing out there, but I don't believe it means to be. This is both an abstract autobiography in music and an important message to be carried out in the world, even subconciously. This is an apocalypse of the mind, hidden away in a less offensive carboard outer packaging, and in the distant future, (or near, depending on people as a whole)it will be seen as an important undertaking in the path of enlightenment and liberation.<BR>   It may not be much to listen to the album by itself. It may even be a somewhat dull experience for some. Others will tremble or frozen nerve simply because of what a friend of a friend said. The ACS projet was to be in tune with the tour that followed: a ressurection of the human spirit, a magickal ritual, and a heartfelt story. <BR>   Even if it .... in your opinion,(I hardly ever listen to it anymore)it is to the true individual mindset (satanic, if you will accept that term) as maple syrup is to pancakes. You may not like it, but that's what it's there for.
0316666343|2.0|Disappointing to see a fine idea drowned in sentiment. The book unfortunately perpetuates the false dream of the victim i.e., all future life is related to the point of trauma. The sad and yet comforting reality is that the world moves on for everyone related to tragedy including, if not especially, the direct victim. In the opening chapter the author is divided into at least three separate entities. There is the innocent girl who dies tarnished but remains pure in heaven. There is the dippy clairvoyant who though unrelated sees the ghost of innocence in everything. Then there is the pragmatic overachieving sister who is able to find a place to put the tragedy in order to allow her to keep moving forward.<br />It would be trite to say that these are all aspects of the author's personality in dealing with her own terible trauma, but as she herself has chosen to record the event, I think it must be considered as a reference in this fiction.<br />It may have been a rewarding and worthy experience writing this book, but reading it was just a little Oprah for my tastes. Child molestation, rape and murder are repugnant acts that cannot be made easier to stomach because someone's sister marries a nice boy. It seems a distinctly American idea that tragedy is only truly defeated by happiness. In Europe and, perhaps even more, in Israel we understand that tragedy and happiness are not dependent on each other for validation. They are not inversely proportional. Tragedy and happiness co-exist - a tough reality not represented in this simplified fiction.
0060977264|2.0|I felt like something was missing, that this was discription of some experience important to the author, that he had a memory in his mind but forgot that we as readers don't have the background.  We never know how these two lovers met, why they fell in love, how they grew apart, or what was so difficult about reuniting.  Often the most profound feelings of love and spirituality the characters experience is under the influence of a lot of wine.  We don't even really find out how it all ends or why a spiritual life and a simple life in the place of ones birth are mutually exclusive.<br />After reading the Valkyries, I felt like the holes were filled in.
B00003CXXP|5.0|People who see this movie seem to fall into two categories: those who absolutely hate it, and those who love it because they see it for what it really is. I'm part of the latter group. This is one of the best movies ever made, sci-fi or otherwise. The events of this movie are so unexpected, the emotions so intense, the sheer scale staggering, and the issues so deep, that I cannot help but admire its beauty. When his innocent and loving motives lead him to extremely dangerous actions, his parents cannot keep him - but they love him too much to let him be destroyed. He is left feeling alienated and confused, incapable of understanding why he has been abandoned. His single drive to be reunited with his parents is beautifully idealistic, but at the same time ultimately doomed. His quest leads him through a nightmarish world with just enough of a glimmer of hope to keep him going. The Flesh Fair's motto, &quot;A Celebration of Life,&quot; takes on a whole new meaning after an otherwise destruction-hungry crowd stands up for David's right to live, neither knowing nor caring that he isn't human. As the movie comes closer to what would seem like a dead end, David's discovery of his true nature - that he is not really unique - leads to one of the most powerful scenes in science fiction history: that of him falling off a tall building into the ocean, no longer caring whether he lives or dies. When he first meets with what he believes to be the &quot;Blue Fairy,&quot; he touches her, and she shatters like glass in front of him. The ending is not guaranteed to satisfy everyone, but is not too depressing either, and it perfectly sums up what the movie is about. I could not imagine a more fitting end for a movie like this.<br />Through it all, the sheer visuals are outstanding. I'm not just referring to the special effects; I'm referring to the camera angles, the lighting, the set design, everything. Even the puddle of water in front of the church serves a purpose.<br />Watch this movie. I can't guarantee that you'll like it. If you hate it, then you will have lost nothing but two hours. If you love it, you will have gained something much, much more important.s movie. I can't guarantee that you'll like it. If you hate it, then you will have lost nothing but two hours.

B00004YRQA|5.0|With games on CD and DVD and no built-in hard drive, having a memory card is a must for anyone who wants to be able to save their progress from session to session.<br />I have always preferred to use the Sony memory cards with my system.  Call me a snob, but I prefer to use them because the manufacturer of the PS2 has to be able to maximize its hardware the best.  If you buy a Ferrari, would you then use no-name parts?  Of course not!  Spend the extra few dollars and get a good card.<br />I have saved games for at least 10 game titles on my one card, so you don't need the &quot;1GB&quot; (or whatever the size of the month is) cards.<br />Please note that this card does NOT work with PlayStation One games.  Only PS2 titles.  You'll need to buy a PSX memory card for those older titles.
B00005JLRR|4.0|If I said this movie was better than Generations or Insurrection, that wouldn't be saying much - most movies are. If I said it's not as good as First Contact, that's also not saying much - most movies aren't. So calling this movie the second best of the TNG movies is pretty pointless.<br />It's a good movie. It has some room for improvement, the fight scenes could have been more intense, the plot could have moved faster, blah blah blah... but overall, this is a pretty good movie. It's one of the VERY few movies in which you can sympathize with the bad guy, and I love that. It's not just \\"Oh, I'm gonna go kill stuff because I'm so evil,\\" the bad guy actually has realistic motives and very human virtues and flaws. Basically, this story is all about Picard and Shinzon, with Data providing a really minor subplot. There is much discussion about really deep stuff that I can't remember right now, mixed well with a slight and creepy feeling that something's not quite right. The plot holds more than a few surprises, the new Romulan ship looks cool inside and out, and... well, I really want to talk about Shinzon some more. This is totally his movie. He's the perfect tragic villain! I still have to wonder why he's bald, though. Isn't that something that should set in later in life? And his tight rubber suit is just funny, how it's so ultra-shiny and squeaks whenever he moves, so he moves really stiffly... it's just kinda funny when you think about it. There's also a lot of other cool stuff in the movie, like when the Enterprise smashes right into the Scimitar, and the part where people on the bridge get sucked out into space because part of the bridge is actually GONE. The fights on the interior of the Scimitar are really cool.<br />The flaws are very noticeable, but really minor. The Remians look like vampires that got assimilated by the Borg (in terms of skin tone and wierd veiny stuff), and no explanation is given for their appearance. The radiation on the Scimitar... where did it go? And WHAT'S WITH SHINZON'S RUBBER SUIT?<br />Nemesis has more depth than most Star trek movies, just the right amount of action, really cool visuals, and enough illogical details to satisfy most Trek fans. It's a very well-rounded and nice movie, but not exceptional.did it go?

0060278269|5.0|OK, basically, i finished Abhorsen about 3 minutes ago and i'm so excited i can barely type!!! it was ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!!! though i loved (and still do love) sabriel and lirael, this one completely blew them away!!! it was amazing!!! i can tell you hardly any of it but there are tons of surprises, plus you find out the true identities of Mogget and the Dog!!! the story basically revolves around lirael and sam trying to rebind the Destroyer (Orannis, or the Ninth) but includes lots of other favorite characters!! Garth Nix has completely outdone himself on abhorsen and i wait in anticipation for another book set in the Old Kingdom (which is hinted at throughout abhorsen)!! If you havent read Sabriel or Lirael yet, i recommend starting with those, but if you have read them, buy abhorsen as soon as you can because it is way more than worth it!!!!!!<BR>~a completely obsessed sabriel/lirael/abhorsen fan
B00005OAIE|5.0|Even though Mayer has become a truly pop guitar wonder, he is still amazing to the core.  People may state that Room For Squares is merely another teeny bopper love, where millions of screaming girls will flock to concerts to oggle at their newest celebrity love, but I beg to differ.  John Mayer's smooth guitar riffs and contemplative attitude about every aspect of his life is intriguing and overflowing with talent.  This album showcases his brilliant guitar work and his amazing lyrical skills.  How many other artists can talk about their lunchbox and make it sound so reminiscent?  If you have hesitations about listening to this album because of the bumblegum sound of No Such Thing, just try 3x5 on for size or Sucker.  Many things can be said about John Mayer, but one thing is for sure, his honesty and guitar playing are amazing.  LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM!  YOU'LL GET HOOKED IMMEDIATELY!
B000002H33|5.0|I absolutely love the look on metallica fans faces when they see i use this cd as a coaster, definately worth the price. I have to say this album lasted a lot longer than the black album(broke it when using it as a frisbee) So i think it might be more durable.
B00006LSM3|4.0|All in all not a bad release when measured against George's previous studio release, \\"Cloud Nine\\". There is still the sense that Jeff Lynne had to resist turning this into ELO Mach 3 as he is wont to do (See his work with Tom Petty, Traveling Wilburys, Roy Orbison), especially on tracks like \\"Rising Sun\\" with it's phased vocals and thudding beat. I suspect that George's son Dhani tempered Jeff's tendency towards overproduction and restored George's unique musical personality to the final mixes. George pulls off a charming slice of cabaret with the ukelele workout \\"Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\\". George comes full circle singing about Lucifer (one of his earliest Beatle vocals was \\"Devil in Her Heart\\") and he seems genuinely comfortable crooning about the dark prince again some 39 years later. The only bummer is the rambling title track, which is full of the preachy, condescending lyrics we'd all hoped he'd abandoned back in the early 80's. At the end of the day, a nice way to remember George.
B000002H97|5.0|This album makes a damn fine coaster, i used for almost 2 years putting everything from soda cans to coffee mugs on it. Absolutely wonderful durability.

B00000811N|5.0|This is album belongs almost entirely to Ron Geesin and it's misleading to give Roger Waters equal billing, so Floyd fans, reconsider.  Roger contributed four of the songs, and three of those are the same tune with different lyrics.  That said, I'm a big Pink Floyd and Roger Waters fan, but that didn't stop this album from being one of my favorites.  With the exception of the Roger tunes, it's entirely instrumental (or at least wordless), with string duets, looped chanting, and other stuff I can't begin to identify.  It manages to be highly experimental without being pointless or grating on the ears.  Most of Ron's other stuff escapes me, but not so here.  Just to clear up any confusion from one of the other comments, it was after Dark Side of the Moon that Floyd considered recording an album sans musical instruments, and that was scraped to record Wish You Were Here, not Animals.  Regardless, Music From the Body was recorded half a decade earlier, prior to Pink Floyd's Ummagumma.  Several Species from Ummagumma is probably the closest you'll come to find anything that sounds like Floyd on this album (though I believe Give Birth to a Smile does feature all of the Floyd members), but in my opinion, Floyd's attempt to impersonate The Body didn't come close.
B0000542DJ|4.0|The investigation is very interesting, the scenario enthralling; the whole movie is both informative and entertaining. Lots of options about the murder are discussed, and although some mystery remains, I appreciate that this movie gives me clearer ideas (or seems to).

0553275976|4.0|This was my second Tom Wolfe book and I enjoyed it even more than the first, being \\"A Man In Full\\" It amazes me how Wolfe can introduce so many characters from so many places and then some how tie them all together. This book may anger certain readers with the frequent stereotypes used by Wolfe to show New York prejudice but they are essential in understanding New York city. I personally enjoyed the theme of how many whites were afraid of blacks and were scared to travel to what seems like another city in Harlem. Wolfe also addresses the situation within the poverty stricken ghettos of New York. This book paints an accurate picture of New York sex and class and the divisions within them.
B000063S6Z|1.0|Alright, I consider myself to be a big fan of Moby.  I've been listening to his music since the very beginnings, over 10 years ago.  He's created albums that I consider to be masterpieces.  This album, however, is a complete disaster.  I knew Moby was on the way to becoming a sell-out, when all of the tracks from the album Play were sold for commercial purposes.  This was something I eventually came to terms with.  But the total lack of creativity that this album is comprised of is truely astounding.  This is clearly evident in the song, \\"We Are All Made of Stars,\\" a total and complete travesty.  He should be ashamed to put his name an album that is soo comercialized and mainstream.  My advice, but any album by Moby EXCEPT THIS ONE!!!!
B00004RJ74|3.0|Apparently this was the movie Quentin really wanted to make. &quot;From Dusk to Dawn&quot; starts off with the traditional Quention recipe and I admit I found it disturbing in scenes.  I had been told many years ago that there was a vampire theme in this, so wasn't sure if I had the right movie because there is no hint of that in the first half of the film.  Suddenly it just changes and goes totally bizarre .... but as I said, this was a theme that Quention really wanted to pursue.<BR>All I can say is, don't take the film seriously.  Just sit back and enjoy.  It will become a cult classic ... slowly but surely.  George Clooney is brilliant in this.<br />DVD EVALUATION:  Early DVD version had poor transfer and limited extras.  Best to locate new Collectors version with sharp clear transfer and plenty of extras. Worth adding to your collection particularly if you enjoyed &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;.
0151008116|5.0|Due to a tragic accident Pi Patel finds himself the sole (human) survivor of the cargo ship in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. From that point forward Pi must fight exhaustion, hunger and apathy in order to stay alive. He manages to swim to a rescue boat that is accompanied by several zoo animals that are part of the ship's cargo. He is able to utilize his knowledge of zoology he had learned from his father to successfully live in the lifeboat with Richard Parker, a tiger.<br />Surpringly, my favorite part of this book was the first section before the cargo ship sank. I loved the details of his life and how he interacted with his family. I almost didn't want this section to end. I would have gladly read a book simply concerning Pi's life in India.<br />THE LIFE OF PI was beautifully written. It is a quick read and well worth one's time and effort. I really appreciated Martel's development of the 'society' that lives underneath the surface of the ocean. This really validates the idea that the ocean is so much more than water and waves. I also enjoyed how Pi, before becoming a castaway, embraced the Hindi, Muslim and Christianity religions and how others reacted to his decision. It really made me wonder if there would be more understanding between these religions if people studied more than one. Maybe walls that divide them would disintegrate? I wonder...<br />I recommend THE LIFE OF PI to others who enjoy reading a good book.

B000071ZZI|4.0|The book is a great story. Bourne is an amazingly capable guy, who doesn't know it, due to amnesia, probably related to the bullets. The book has rich character development, suspense, plot, and non-stop-action. It's one of those books you will not be able to put down, and you may skip a meal or two to finish it in one sitting, so find a cumfy chair. Two subsequent books: The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum by Robert Ludlum are both good, but not as good as the first. Ludlum books have a style that I enjoy, but I've decided that it's as if they're written to formula, so more than one Ludlum book a year makes them less enjoyable. One Ludlum book a year is very nice to read. The 1988 tv-miniseries version of this movie with Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith was OK, but I thought that Bourne lacked the skills portrayed in the book, although he did have some of the brains. The 2002 movie with Matt Damon is just the opposite with Bourne having all of the skills (here's a guy you do not want to meet in a dark alley, or even a crouded policeman's shooting range), but none of the brains. In 2002 the female sidekick shows that no smarts at all is enough to stay alive, whereas in the book anyone without 100% amazing training gets wiped out very fast -- and the need for both honed skill and brains is what gives you the respect for the book Bourne. I'll buy the 2002 movie for the hand to hand combat scenes, like the one in the embasy. I hope they're as good as I remember from the movie theatre.
B000007SPT|4.0|A really amazing album, imajinative and fantasy orientated, by 80's/early 90's often described goth band. 'I'll end in tears' highlight for me is &quot;Song to the siren&quot;, which also appears on the David Lynch film 'The Lost Highway'.
B00006RIO7|5.0|The movie musical has returned in all of its glory!  This recording is every bit as exiting as the movie itself.  Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellweger, Richard Gere, Queen Latifah, John C. Reilly, Christine Baranski, and Taye Diggs are an ideal cast who can sing their hearts out.  Forget the shock factor of &quot;WOW, THEY CAN SING!&quot; and just enjoy the tremendous talent that Rob Marshall assembled and the wonderful new orchestrations.  From the overture until the conclusion of Kander and Ebb's incredibly melodic new song, &quot;I Move On&quot; (with the wonderful inclusion of the original score's &quot;Class&quot;), this is a disc that you cannot stop playing midway through.  Savor the &quot;Cell Block Tango,&quot; &quot;We Both Reached for the Gun,&quot; &quot;When You're Good to Mama,&quot; and the Finale.  In fact, savor it all!  The two tracks by Danny Elfman are subtely moody and jazzy enough to accent the Kander and Ebb score well (matching the music of them is a job well done).  The &quot;all-star&quot; rendition of &quot;Cell Block Tango&quot; is amusing as is Anastacia's &quot;Love is a Crime&quot; (though to hear a rap after a Broadway score is a big gear shift)!  This is a must buy for all who love musicals and want to see more well-done movie musicals.  Broadway's BIG return to the screen is a genuine and glorified HIT!  Can't wait for the DVD!

0060523794|5.0|I was a bit amused &amp; surprised to see the extreme, differering reviews posted here. To me, this book certainly deserves 5 stars for its simple, straightforward style and Gerstner's pin-point diagnosis &amp; prescriptions and of course results.<BR>To those who says he was a heartless tyrant, I say you cant run a huge corporation effectively by being a wishy-washy. To those who accuses him of self-centredness and self-aggradisement, I say well ... he deserved what he got by producing results - we are living in a capitalistic world . . . . finally for those who says that he made it on the expense of thousands of lay-offs, I say get a new pair of glasses ... look at those people's jobs he saved, and the economic turmoil he prevented had a corporation of 300,000 employees bankrupt.

0446310786|5.0|Harper Lee's \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is a powerful and moving story. It follows Jean Louise Finch (Scout), a young girl, through her life in growing up in Macomb, Alabama in the 1930's. It goes through her trials and growth with the help of her father, Atticus Finch, her brother, Jem Finch, her good friend, Dill Harris and other characters that inhabit the small neighborhood. The mysteries of the world began to take meaning to the children. When Atticus takes Tom Robinson's case, a black man wrongfully accused of rape, the whole town is in an uproar. The racist views of the old South have a negative affect on the Finch family, with threats and harassment. This is a well-written story of discovery and realizations of the way things are and the way they can be. In the end, through a hermit neighbor, named Boo Radley, Scout learns that you can always find the good in others if you look hard enough. This book is a great reminder of how cruel people in this world can be, but at the same time how you can find kindness where you least aspect it. I enjoyed this book, once you get into it; Scout was a very easy character to relate with. She is a symbol of childhood, and exudes thoughts and emotions, that everyone has felt at least once.
B00005JKG9|4.0|In an age where movies are judged by how many things can be blown up and what new visual effects are used, this movie stands to the side and [smiles].  This movie is one of my all time favorites by virtue of its intense dialogue.  Each scene depicts men involved in life or death negotiations, alternately sparring with and complimenting each other.  It's hard not to be drawn to Ricky Roma's oratory skills or to feel pity for Lemmon's pathetic character.  GlenGarry GlenRoss is worth every penny if you value the art of dialogue.
0440237688|5.0|This novel is a brilliant work with deep insight into the future should humanity continue to try to control nature.  There are unfortunate things that happen and that is just as important and exciting a part of life as anything else.  <br />The book gives us a look at the moral choices of a 12 year old boy that makes decisions that todays adults should be proud to have such integrity to choose.  The ending is absolutely brilliant.  It allows the reader to think whatever he or she chooses happened to Jonah.  Lois Lowry herself said that the end is up to the reader.<br />If you haven't read this book do.  It is far above its reading level.  Every adult out there should take in this quick read - it has a heart we all need.

B00005JKQZ|3.0|I'm not sure why all the hype about the film, much less the Oscar nod. It's a typical Ron Howard button-pusher with a good cast. I found it a bit slow at times but it finished strong.<br />One total anomaly that is typical Hollywood is the Jennifer Connelly character. I'm grateful that I got to look at her and not Camryn Manheim for 2+ hours, but I for one find it unreasonable that she would hit on Nash in the first place, let alone marry him. He was awkward, antisocial, and rough-looking and a long, long way from smooth with the ladies. It's on the same scale of implausability as Helen Hunt falling for Jack Nicholson in &quot;As Good As it Gets&quot;.<br />(By extension, I wonder how well &quot;Speed&quot; would have done if instead of Reeves and Bullock in the lead roles, they had, say, Dennis Franz and Rosie O'Donnell. But I digress.)

I reckon it beats of the likes of Automatic for the People, Trompe le Monde, OK Computer, and of course Nevermind itself to be the greatest album of the 90's<BR>certainly the best album of the whole 'grunge' thing going on 10 years ago.  People are always disputing that Nevermind is better than Peal Jam's Ten and vice versa but if you want to quickly shut these guys up then put this in you CD player.  Then is when Nevermind and Ten seem like squabbling children while the daddy rocks out! <br />The album starts off superbly, kinda like a story bok 'contents' page with Kurt Cobains Punky guitar and then lyrics that basically tell you what this album is about.  \\"Teenage aignst has paid off well, Now im bord and old\\"  this is just an example.  He goes on to sing about everything from his parents divorce to a certain magazine article on his wife.  Like i said, this first song is like the contents page as every other song on the disc concentrates on individual subjects.  Obvious highlights are the 2 singles Heart shaped box and All apologies.  Pennyroyal tea is also a great song.  Dumb and Rape me also stand out well with the latter, like the song 'Polly' from Nevermind tackling rape issues from in a way, a sarcastic sence that immediatly gets you to listen as the first riff is eerily similar to 'Teen Spirit\\".  Dumb, about Cobains drug use is similar to \\"lithium\\" not in the sence that the song is a rockin' crowd pleaser (its one of the slower songs on the album) but it shows Kurts take on all his problems.  He knows what he is doing and that its not very good for him yet he keeps putting back the moment when he will do something about it.<BR>My personal fave song on the CD is Radio friendly Unit shifter, one of the songs that goes lenghs to alienating the 'fake' fanbase Nirvana got after Nevermind.  There are a few of these on the album but all in all they are still strong songs.  Listen to it 2 or 3 times and you will realise its one of the best albums ever. 5 stars.
B00006JDVV|5.0|This is an Awesome Sci-Fi flick that brings that old Fantasy favorite of Dragons back again.  In Reign of Fire Matthew McConaughey plays an American Dragonslayer that has come to England hunting a Male Dragon.  It is set years after the dragon was discovered and is a last desperate stand against a seemingly unconquerable foe.  The director has put together a special effects masterpiece.
B000063DFQ|5.0|Piece of Mind is one of the greatest metal albums ever recorded. I love the way it starts out with &quot;Where Egales Dare&quot;. Great way to start out an album. &quot;Revelations&quot; and &quot;Flight of Icarus&quot; are really gnarley too. But I think that &quot;The Trooper&quot; is probably one of the best IRON MAIDEN songs there is. There is some great singing by Bruce Dickinson and awsome gutair work by Dave Murrary and Adrian Smith. Steve Harris sure knows how to write some damn fine songs. This is a must have for any MAIDEN fan. -UP THE IRONS-
6301969588|3.0|I don't even think it's up for debate. The script is horrible, the acting, horrible. But, like a train wreck with disfigured people, who can look away?
B00003CXRM|5.0|I often question the critics &quot;rave&quot; reviews of items, but on day I saw the video for &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; with clips from the movie and it got me intrigued.  I didn't know that it was a &quot;comedy&quot;.  I rented it to see what it was about and I loved it.  I rented it again and had my parents watch it.  I don't think that they really got into it though.  A co-worker absolutly hated it.  Couldn't get through watching it even once.  I guess it all depends on you sense of humor.  It needs to be pretty off-the-wall to enjoy subtlties like in this movie.<br />Great visual work, great audio work, FANTASTIC casting.  Rent it and see what you think first.
6304030983|4.0|If you thought 3000 Miles to Graceland was a viloent movie, then I will have to guess that you have never seen Jumanji. But this movie got a PG rating if though there a lot of violence going on during this movie. This was based of a book and there is a game in this movie called Jumanji in which it has strict rules like Don't begin in less you intend to finish. And gives messages to the players like &quot;in the jungle you must wait until the dice reads 5 or 8.&quot; The movie begins wiht a couple of kids or teenagers burying a box. And 100 years later the box is dug up by a boy named Alan (Adam Hann-Byrd). His parents decide to send him away to a school. But when Alan angrys his parents they leave slamming the door and his also packs his bags and also is out the door when a girl named Sarah (Laura Bell Bunty) who has come to Alan's house to return a bike that was wrecked by her boyfriend. Alan shows Sarah the game and before they know it they are playing the game and weird stuff comes out before Alan gets a message to wait inside the game until the dice reads 5 or 8. And Sarah runs screaming from the house. 26 years later, a woman (Bebe Neuwrith) and her neice Judy (Kristen Dunst) and nephew Peter (Beauty and the Beast's Bradley Pierce) move in the house and one day insteading of going to school Judy and Peter find Jumanji and play and without knowing releases Alan (Robin Williams) even though he was rumored to be dead.
0066214122|4.0|This is good, not great escapist fiction, although from all the hype surrounding the release of PREY, its premise is not that far from reality. Scientists in the fields of computer technology, genetic engineering, and nanotechnology are developing the ability to produce molecular sized robots that will be able to manipulate matter at the atomic level. In PREY, these robots swarm together and develop emergent behavior (effective new behaviors developed when old behaviors are ineffective) which is life-threatenning to the scientists who have created them.<br />PREY has some very exciting and thrilling moments and offers some intriguing information about biology and animal behavior that elevates it above the typical story of \\"science runs amok'. The problems with it however, are found in the missing literary elements that, when present, make excellent and satisfying reading. There is minimal character development and the dialogue is simple-minded and at times ludicrous. For example, Jack, after witnessing his wife, who is filled with deadly particles, attempt to murder another scientist, describes his experience to her: \\"I felt tremendously uneasy\\". I guess!<br />Nonetheless, if readers are looking for a fast-paced, entertaining thriller that provides enough science and new information to speculate about the world's future, then they should enjoy PREY.
B00006RIO7|5.0|Definitely does justice to this sensational movie! Not since \\"Moulin Rouge\\" has a movie left me seeing out of the theaters and dying to buy the soundtrack!
B00005JKQZ|5.0|oh, wow....this film absolutely blew me away, so much so, it's difficult to translate the feelings into mere words. It is so rich in textures, a once in a lifetime, brilliant performance from Russell Crowe, with understated, deft direction by Ron Howard, a light dance of inspiration that so rarely comes out of Hollywood. Opee you done well!<br />The power and emotion of this film, Russell's magick, is often nearly overwhelming. Few films affect you as deeply. The tale captures your from the start, gently rapping its hand around your heart and keeping you in thrall, as you follow the spiralling brilliance of genius on the edge of madness. Howard walks the tight rope, never fully revealing the cards he hold, keeping the viewer so convinced that these things are actually happening, though the other characters are telling you it was all in Crowe's mind. It gives you an unique position of 'experiencing' Crowe's delusions, so we more fully understand that delusions can be frighteningly as real as life. Instead of telling you this man suffers from schizophrenia, Howard and Crowe make 'your walk a mile in Nash's shoes', thus making your, for the first time, really comprehend what this disease does to the mind. How despite this all, Nash went on to win a Noble prize so this is a story of personal triumph.<br />Nash, an off the IQ chart mathematician, a socially inept Southern, is pulled into the superspy world by Ed Harris' William Parcher, who claims he is US government agent and needs Nash's unique talents. Christopher Plummer, another brilliant (but overlooked actor) actor gives to the link into reality, for both Nash and the audience, as Dr. Rosen, who treats Nash. Jennifer Connelly's performance as Nash's funny and loving wife, demonstrated a broader range of talent than we have seen from her; amazing to see the little girl who danced with Bowie all grown up and proving she is much more than a pretty face.<br />Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress, Best Adapted Screenplay and all well earned. The DVD is loaded with extras, like a commentary by Howard and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, deleted scenes, scoring of the film, soundtrack and and other material on Nash.ting Actress, Best Adapted Screenplay and all well earned.

B00006CXXU|5.0|It's about time someone with talent emerged from the mass of \\"Pop Princesses\\" to create an album worth buying.  I have always thought that Christina has the voice of an angel, but she shines on this album.  Every song is worth listening to on repeat and I can relate to just about everything she says.  As far as the interior pictures and the in-your-face, balls-to-the-wall sexuality, it doesn't detract from what is there...a great album from a great singer.  Everyone is just looking for someone to complain about....so I just want to tell everyone to shut up and give her the credit she has more than achieved.
B000062Y98|4.0|I will give them this.  This is a unique band with a unique sound.  Though I am not sure that this would be the album to start with from Blind Guardian.  Let's start by saying that this is defininitely in the european brand of power/progressive metal.  That is definitely a good thing since most interesting heavy music seems to come from Europe these days.  A Night at the Opera is exactly what BG has attempted to do.  They have melded their particular brand of metal into a heavy metal opera.  This is a very good album if you are looking for complex songwriting, excellent production and a heavy metal attack that just won't quit.  And I think that is one aspect of the album that is definitely lacking....it doesn't quit.  These guys allow no room for a breath...it is headbanging from beat one to the last.  By the middle of the album you are looking for melody to hang your hat...it's not there.  I personnally really like the album, but it takes a lot of listens and musical analysis.  If you are the kind of person who listens to music intently then this album would be for you..as a background party music type of thing...forget it.  4 stars for pushing the envelope.  The singer has a really cool voice, who I believe takes a little getting used to.  The musicians are all top notch.  Production is very good.  I like the Demons and Wizards project with Jon Schaeffer and Hansi better.  Please continue!
B000005JHP|4.0|If you're reading this review, you're either a die-hard Kate fan checking out the reviews, or perhaps a Kate newbie doing some backfilling.  I like the lush-life Kate, and this album has many beautifully orchestrated pieces like \\"Blow Away (for Bill)\\" which has such a gorgeous melody, multi-layered Kate-isms, and the usual interesting quirks, and it can be listed to over and over -- always puts a smile on my face.  There's really only one weak track on the disk, \\"Violin\\", which makes a failing, silly stab at harder rock.  Other tracks, such as \\"Babooshka\\" and \\"Army Dreaming / Breathing\\"  have great depth, messages, lovely vocals, and superb production instincts.  It's perhaps not fair to give this album four stars, given the goodness of the good material; however, the songs overall are less compelling than they should be on a five-star disk (like The Dreaming, which is so over-the-top).<br />In comparison to other Kate Bush albums, Never for Ever is more in the Lionheart/Kick Inside vein than Hounds of Love -- It's mostly sensitive tone poems, insightful lyrics, and always interesting.<br />How could you not own this album?
0316666343|1.0|I am an avid reader, and so is my friend. We usually like the same books so when she told me this book was wonderful, I believed her. UGH. Well, let's see - in the first chapter the main character gets raped, and CHOPPED UP INTO PIECES. If you can handle books that are SEVERELY DEPRESSING than that's great for you. But I know I can't. <BR> When I read a book I tend to get into the mood of the book. I really feel for the characters. My mother was constantly asking me if I felt all right - because I was wandering around the house moping. Well, I guess it's because I'm sensitive - but I was constantly crying for Susie - I couldn't help it!<BR> I guess I can understand how some people enjoyed it - it was touching - but I still can't see how it got all of that praise! But for the people who are like me - and are sad when the characters are sad - AVOID AT ALL COSTS.<BR> And for those of you who aren't really affected by these things then what can I tell you - read it. You might be one of the few that enjoy it. Well I guess you either love it or you don't. (And I think I made it apparent that I don't)<BR>I Hope I helped!
B00005NI5Y|5.0|What a revelation.  I anticipated I'd dislike this album and expected it to be too twangy or too hard or too overreaching.  Instead, this mid-rocking album highlights its country roots in a fun way.  You can tell Dylan is having a ball and it sounds that way on every song.  It's infectious.  It's always interesting to hear skill on display.  A great disk to have in the car.
0425173755|4.0|\\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" is a murder mystery that is wonderful becuase it is based solely on the wit and wisdom of its detective. Agatha Christie writes a muder mystery in a manner that doesn't dwell on the immorality of the situation; she doesn't stoop to the level of using sex or violence to capturing her reader's attention. This is a wonderful mystery that will keep you guessing up until the end with its brilliant dectective, perfect alibis, and unexpected turns.
0553579908|5.0|A Clash of Kings is maybe the best sequel in the fantasy genre since The Two Towers.  I'm not just blowing wind here; I can't think of a sequel, in any series, that is near as good as the first. (The Great Hunt, Elfstones of Shannarra, Dune Messiah, Stone of Tears, Silverthorn, Stone of Farewell--not that I don't love all of these books/series) It is an unwritten rule that any sequel is not going to produce the same effect as the first.  Truely, honestly, this book is just as good as the first. (Which you absolutely MUST read before you pick this one up)  I loved A Game of Thrones, and was resigned to this book just sort of resting on the laurels of the first book.  Not so. This story is different from the first, and while it moves with the same characters(no duh), it introduces some new characters that are not just thrown in on the spur of the moment.  These (new) characters are there to add a new depth and darkness to the novel--they are not put in to just add pages to the book.<br />Another thing, this sequel does what I didn't think would happen; it keeps you guessing.  I was not sure how this book would end, good or bad.  Maybe I was sort of blinded to it because I found myself rooting for the &quot;bad guys&quot; before the book was over.  I found myself in a weird position; the battles are raging on two or three different fronts, and at one I was cheering for the Starks, and another I wanted the Lannisters to win.  Just great.  You are more drawn to a character for his/her charisma than for him/her being &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad.&quot;<br />I've read a couple of reviewers who pan the book...I'm not sure what book they were reading, or maybe they didn't get it.  Yes, Martin does use some oldish language at times.  It's called poetic language, and you don't come across it very often.  Maybe he does use three words where one could do the work...but if you don't like reading, I've got a simple answer for you.  Either you can just read every third word, or you can just pick up the remote and watch WWF.<br />To sum it up; this is a great book.  I'm talking on a par with the Godfather II adding to the Godfather good.  It is obvious that Martin has a goal in mind for these books, that he is not just writing from book to book, hoping to stretch the series interminably.  BUY THIS!!
B000001GQC|4.0|This CD is an excellent remastering of an earlier recording, but I thought the sound was a little lifeless at some points.  Prokofiev's intentional discord in some parts was a little jarring to my ear, but that's a feature of the music, not the performance.  I think you would be surprised to recognize parts of this music even if you think you've never listened to Prokofiev.  Bits of these soundtracks have been recycled for other films than these.  This is a worthwhile addition to your collection.

B0000797IO|1.0|Despite high expectations, I started groaning at this DVD almost from the first scene. One bogus, Hollywood-fake condescending take on the \\"fly-over\\" zone of America after another, there's not an honest moment or believeable character in this entire sneering exercise. The best performances in the world can't overcome fundamentally dishonest material. Steer clear.
0316666343|4.0|I am only 2/3 of the way through with this book.  Unless the ending turns out to be really disappointing, I have to say it is one of the best books I have ever read.  It's not exactly a literary masterpiece, but it is well-written, and  it is a touching story.  It will not appeal to non-sentimental readers, but it made ME cry at several points (esp. when Susie described the night of her murder, how her family was going on with their lambchop dinner and wondering where she was...I actually felt homesick!)  <br />This is a terrific book, the kind of book that is so good it actually makes you look forward to riding the NYC subway at rush hour just to get a chance to read it.
0316666343|5.0|I am not sure what some of the other folks reading this book were looking for, but I found &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; to be one of the best books I have ever read.  This book provides a perspective that people don't think about all of the time.  The thoughts and ideas of those who have lost thier lives, staying and watching and hoping for those who are still living.....very well put together in this story.  I have passed this book along to my parents and friends, and everyone has walked away from it, touched and changed.  I would also like to add that everyone that I know read this book in its entirity under 24 hours!  It's that wonderful!
B00005JLXC|5.0|I have been a fan of Daredevil since the age of 7. I went to the local comic-book store and picked up the Born Again TPB and had my mother buy it for me and I have read over 50 times since. I have collected everything I could find on DD ever since. I mean, I would save my lunch money and birthday money to buy DD comics. I have a treasury full of DD TPBs, back issues, and Volume 2 issues. As well as toys, mags featuring him, and the Daredevil Vs. Spiderman animated DVD pre-ordered. Get this, I payed 7.15 for a matinee to \\"Just Married\\" so my girlfriend and and my friends could see the new DD trailer. <BR>    So, you could imagine how much I want to see this film...a lot! Everything about it (except the slow and dismal marketing campaign) amazes, it is how I would make a Daredevil motion picture. Ben Affleck=DD fanboy=perfect Matt Murdock. Colin Farrell is perfect as the coolest villian ever: the  insane Bullseye! Jennifer Garner is sexy and smooth as a cool and leather-clad Elektra. Skin color does not matter to me, even though the Kingpin in the comics was a white guy, I couldn't think of anyone better than the inspired Michael Clark Duncan. Duncan is an electrifying, yet terrifying, actor and should light up the screen with intensity and menace. <BR>    We have a devil, a psycho, a kingpin, and ninja all in one film! And the trailer showed us so much, like Scott Terra in the role of a 12 year-old Murdock. He shows great promise. The story is rumored to be based on the Elektra/Bullseye saga, which is a lot to squeeze into one film, which kind of worries me, but who cares! <BR>Best lines from the new trailer:<BR>Kingpin:\\"Is there anything else?\\"<BR>Bullseye:\\"Yeah....I want a costume!\\"<BR>-and-<BR>Daredevil:\\"Time to give the devil his due!\\"<BR>ON FEBRUARY 14th,<BR>TAKE THE DARE!!!!
B000005ITX|5.0|I will make it short but sweet.  This is my favorite album of all-time.
B00006RIO7|5.0|Ladies and Gentlemen, Boys and Girls, Children of all ages...Like a circus big top there is more going on in this album than can be appreciated at one sitting. The casting is just inspired. While the vocalists are not classically trained broadway stars, their acting skills deliver interpretations on these Kander and Ebb classics that should not be missed. While Catherine Zeta Jones has the full force to deliver on the showstopping numbers she performs, the understated warmth of Renee Zelwegger's performances are amazing(but to hear her open up is to realize this gal can really sing). Richard Gere recreates a style of singing right out of the 20's and delivers it true to form. Razzle Dazzle and We Both reached for the Gun  are excellent. But.. the 2 most notable performances are the often underated John C Reily in Mr. Cellophane and Queen Latifah's When you're good to mama. Reily delivers an emotional and soulful rendition, while Latifah is the exact opposite. Over the top, full of inuendo and life, her rendition is rousing and pure joy. What a surprise to hear the pipes that she possesses when given a real piece of music to perform- Queen L- you have a whole new recording career ahead of you. While not Chita Rivera et all.. Chicago mixes the dialogue from the movie (a la Pulp Fiction) into a wonderful new take on classic Kander and Ebb. Bravo
0395193958|3.0|I just want to say that the print quality of this book is rather bad, there are many letters with tiny blank spaces and not very well printed characters; there are little black spots throughout the text as well. I was very disappointed by these annoying details as I thought that this leather bound book was the best edition available (as a matter of fact it is sold as a \\"collector's edition\\"). I think it's not worth the price, not at least until the publisher will be able to put these things right. I personally recommend to purchase a less fancy (but better printed) paperback edition. If I had known that this hardback edition contained so many typographic errors, I would have saved my money without doubt. <BR>The Lord of the Rings is a great and challenging book but this &quot;renowned&quot; edition has been a letdown for me and does not do justice to this literary classic.<br />Publishers, edit a new reprinted and revised edition please.
0316776963|5.0|I like the fact that this book was a fast read, and easy to pick up if you stop reading it for one reason or another.
6305428352|5.0|As a teacher myself, I tend to love those teacher movies where the teacher motivates his young charges to fulfill their dreams (&quot;Dead Poets Society&quot;, etc.).  Part of the fun of watching this movie is spotting the doses of reality that might be recognizable just to us teachers.  For example, at one point, Glenn's wife tells him to &quot;go ahead and write your music&quot; when he has missed a meeting with his son's teachers.  Glenn of course isn't writing his OWN music, but doing something for school.  Everyone who has ever taught can relate to this moment, since teachers work some insane hours (most work more in 9 months than others work in an entire year), yet often aren't recognized for this.  The parts with Rowena and dealing with clueless administrators are also very realistic.  The only thing I don't like is the schmaltzy ending, which made me want to gag.  It would be next to impossible to gather all those past students together to perform his ridiculous music.  Other than the ending, this film is one I will continue to enjoy for years to come.
0312305060|5.0|The Hours parallels three women's lives-Clarissa Vaughan living in the present, Laura Brown in the 1940s, and author Virginia Woolf in the 1920s-and, thereby, enables readers to become \\"unstuck in time\\" (to borrow a phrase from Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.). I personally can get \\"cabin fever\\" if a book only addresses one time frame, and I like to get outside. The Hours enables me to do that by moving from one woman's story to another while, at the same time, plumbing the universal depths and ranges of human feelings that cross all time and space. The Hours, which is both immediate and sweeping, is wonderfully challenging stylistically, intellectually, and emotionally. Read parts of it out loud for the sheer poetry. -- Kathleen Hawkins, president of WinningSpirit.com and author of Spirit Incorporated: How to Follow Your Spiritual Path from 9 to 5
B000006NPY|4.0|Like many Pumpkins fans, I rushed out to buy this as soon as it was released, and was disappointed by the lack of megatonnage that I've come to know and love from their previous efforts. I felt this despite knowing that each of these efforts was in fact 50% fuzzy guitar and 50% mellow. I missed that other 50% (though 'Ava Adore' and 'Pug' do provide some of it). But, after looking at these reviews, I decided to give the disc another chance....and, of course, now I totally love it. All the beautiful melodies touched me once again as I didn't allow them to the first time. You have to be in the right mood for this disc. Sit back, relax, and enjoy.
B00005QEO1|5.0|The only band that has enough filth yet at the same time soul, could make an album that are so dirty yet sweet. THE SONGS ARE AMAZING, ALL OF THEM ARE HITS! A great sound to it. Lets take it up song-by-song!

B00006RIO7|3.0|Enjoyed both the show (original and revival) and the movie very much - both are extraordinarily entertaining experiences. However, regarding the motion picture soundtrack, the two \\"bonus\\" tracks are so incongruous to the 1920's style of music that I think they really belong on another CD. I'd give it four stars without them. My advice: buy the original Broadway cast or revival Broadway cast recordings instead.
B00006EXL5|5.0|I went to see a friend's band play not knowing what other bands were there. The first few bands were forgetable but certanly not My Chemical Romance! It is my new favorite cd! There is not one bad song on the whole albulm. I think these guys will certanly rise to stardom. I would suggest for anyone to see them live for an even bigger surprise! They are also the greatest guys. They Rock!

0780622650|4.0|Why does this movie get panned by 'critics' so much?<BR>Why would anyone have wanted an effort which merely copied what went before?  Folks should just relax!  I too enjoyed the<BR>original series while growing up, but I found this<BR>updated take to be refreshing and what it was supposed<BR>to be: Fun.  The acting is good, the plot revolving<BR>around the father and son relationship actually had a bit<BR>of depth, and the romance factor was kept at a minimum, as it should be in sci-fi.

B00004Y6Q5|5.0|Simply one of the best soundtracks ever composed!  A great music selection to go along with a great movie!  A good cd to pop in if you just want to relax.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Just when you thought rock was dead, an album like this hits the stores. Audioslave takes the most distinctive voice in rock music and the most underated musicians in recent times and fuses them together in one explosive supergroup.  From the thundering, in-your-face, speaker-blowing riffs of &quot;Cochise&quot; to the blues-infested, slow and easy sound of &quot;I am the Highway&quot;, there is something for everyone on this debut.  In short, &quot;Audioslave&quot; is, hands down, the best rock album of the year.

B00005OAIE|1.0|You can't really blame John Mayer, can you?  How many pretentious, self-absorbed singer/songwriter &quot;talents&quot; go on for years without being earmarked for insta-stardom, relegated to performing for the Borders bookshop cafe crowd, consumed with bitterness that their genius remains unrecognized?  So the blame sits squarely with Sony for releasing this slap in the face against music and all artists of true merit.  This is the tailor-made sludge for people who don't give a damn about music (&quot;I love music!  Who do I like?  Erm, I just listen to what's on the radio!&quot;) or desperately want to follow the crowd at school or the workplace.  From the first time I heard the wince-inducing &quot;No Such Thing&quot;, all I could visualize were throngs of over-intellectualized middle class grad students admiring the &quot;aren't I clever?&quot; lyrics and who wouldn't know a good song if it came up behind them and wrapped them on the back of the thighs with a hairbrush.  This music betrays an alarming lack of passion, not to mention personality.  Can several million buyers be wrong?  Absolutely.  But not to worry:  how long before sensitive, self-obsessed John gets replaced by the next wimpy star candidate?  The clock is ticking...
6303442846|5.0|One of the best family movies that has been forgotten as the years have passed is Paper Moon.  It is a family movie, but don't let that category fool you into thinking this is some little \\"pre-care bear flick.\\"  Paper moon offers action and adventure.  It's funny and it gets into your heart.  Ryan O'Neal Plays Moses Pray(a con-artist) who is taking young Addie Loggins(an even bigger con-artist),played by O'Neils daugher Tatum, across the U.S. during the Great Depression.  <BR>   Viewers will love the scandels they encounter, the Bible selling, the boot-leg incident.  Even little Addie's plot to get rid of an unwanted guest Trixie Delight, Played by Madeline Kahn.  The movie is never boring, and language is fine.<BR>   Ryan O'Neal is absolutly supberb in this film. Tatum and Madeline were supberb as well.  Both were nominated for Best-Supporting Actress in 1973.  Tatum took home the Oscar at just nine years old!!!  P.J. Johnson also does a great job playing Trixie's \\"maid\\"  Imogene.  Few will recall that funny man Randy Quaid(the National Lampoon's Vacation's Cousin Eddie)has a part in the film.  You have to point him out for yourself.<BR>The film is in black-and-white, and the music is of the time period, so viewers really get a feel for it be in the depression.  It is something that you will definatly want to share with your family.  A+++
B00005JKDR|4.0|As an adult, I really enjoyed watching Monsters, Inc. I found it to be extremely humorous; however, I was disappointed to see that Monsters, Inc was rated G. It should have been rated PG, as many scenes warrant parental guidance. There are different parts of the movie that can be frightening to small children. At least ten different scenes portray violence, one of which involves strangling. Language inappropriate for small children is used (i.e., \\"you stupid, pathetic waste...,\\" \\"you idiot,\\" \\"jerk,\\" etc). <br />The DVD came with a lot of interesting extras, such as how the movie was made. It is incredible! Pixar did an amazing job with the graphics of this movie.
B00006SFLV|5.0|Like pretty much everyone, while this brilliant show was wasted on Thursday nights, I was watching &quot;Friends.&quot; A few months later, I came across an episode on MTV. It turned out to be part of a marathon they were running. Long story short... I didn't leave the TV for several hours. By the early morning of the next day, I'd seen about half of the episodes, still wanted more but just couldn't stay awake.<br />This series was supposed to target teens. I can tell you that I, in my 40s, was amazed by the depth that Claire Danes brought to her role. In fact the entire cast was magnificent. I'm pleasantly surprised that the series has made it's way to DVD. From what I hear, the story of how that came to be is nearly as dramatic as this show.

B00004BZ0N|5.0|I had always thought that The Clash's eponymous debut was going to be my favourite album by them. However, it is London Calling which is frequently cited as their masterpiece, and despite the fact that I thought the straightahead punk of The Clash was more suited to my tastes, I bought it recently anyway having had The Clash for a few years.<br />Well, the title track alone was enough to make it worth the money. Of course, I already knew the track, but it sounds thrilling on CD, a real classic. But there was more on offer that I liked than I thought there might be. Some of the reggae/ska-ish tracks are a bit cheesy (particuarly 'Wrong 'Em Boyo', surely the worst track on the album) but some of them are great, particularly 'Guns of Brixton' which incorporates the snarling menace of punk into its sound and surely was an influence for The Specials' classic 'Ghost Town'.<br />Elsewhere, however, the Clash do all sorts of other things: straightahead punk ('Death or Glory'), pop ('Lovers Rock'), The Who-esque rock ('The Card Cheat'), campy funk-pop ('Train In Vain'), sensitive indie ('Lost In The Supermarket') and all-round fusion of all of the above ('Spanish Bombs'). London Calling is above all so great because you can hear where modern bands got their sounds from in every track - each song seems to have inspired a different band to form - 'Rudie Can't Fail' clearly influenced ska-punk bands, while 'Lost In The Supermarket' sounds like it influenced 80s indie like The Smiths and early REM; 'London Calling' the track influenced every rock band after it, in fact the whole album seems to have. This is one of the most important albums made for that very reason, and also for its political messages.

0930289234|5.0|Anyone looking for a good read will be floored by Alan Moore's 12-issue classic, Watchmen. In this maxiseries, we are shown a world rife with Cold War paranoia, moral decay, superheroes, conspiracies, and Nixon. It starts off with the mad rantings of a half-insane and fascistic hero, Rorschach, who is trying to solve a mystery of a murdered superhero. Although he is beyond creepy (issue 6 almost will make you pity criminals), the scary part is, most of his theories are accurate.<br />From the spineless Dan Dreiberg, to the robotic Dr. Manhattan, this is a story of complex characters, Machiavellian schemes, and a world not too different from our own. Even non-comic fans will enjoy.
0316666343|5.0|I really liked this book. I am only 15, and found this book to be glued to my hand. The only downside was that 3/4 into the book the years skip by fastly. However, i still give it 5 stars. I laughed, and lord knows i cried. This book is definetly 1 of a kind!!!
B0000584V3|5.0|I am new to Opeth, I just heard Blackwater Park for the first time a couple of weeks ago.  This stuff is great, unbelievable, astounding, words can not express enough how much I like this!!  Incredibly original, these guys are amazing!<br />This is not just a CD for hard core death metal fans.  It is much more than that.  I am a fan of mostly old school metal, but also classic rock like Beatles and Floyd, only some death/thrash such as Slayer, Sepultura, and late Death stuff.  This is like the perfect combination of all these styles, unbelievably beautiful yet dark music.  These guys are like the Pink Floyd of metal.  I haven't had it out of my possession since I got it two weeks ago, and I don't think I've done that since first got Master of Puppets back in 86!!  I can't wait to hear Deliverance, I'm going to get it right now!

B00006RIO7|2.0|Practically growing up on the London Revival Cast with Ute Lemper and Ruthie Henshall, I was pleasantly unsurprised by the vocal talents of Renee Zellwigger and Catherine Zeta Jones. While both have very pleasant voices, they lack the &quot;umph&quot; which the London Revival Recording so well portrays. ALL THAT JAZZ, sounds faded, weak, and missing something. FUNNY HONEY is a nice attempt, and I do give Renee credit, but I still feel that Henshall was best. Overall, get the London CD, you will be much better off for your buck.
6304126360|3.0|This is a bit of a misunderstood sci-fi flick ' not flawless, but worth a second look.<br />In a floating space station near Saturn, we meet Harvey Keitel's character, Benson, or 'The Captain'. Or is he really somebody else? In the first few minutes, he murders a pilot preparing to leave for a remote colony on Saturn's third moon. Taking the dead pilot's place, mission and cargo, Benson braves the rings of Saturn and arrives on Saturn 3, where Major Adam (Kirk Douglas) and the fetching Alex (Farrah Fawcett) are developing hydroponics-grown food for a struggling Earth. It's not just work for Adam and Alex, and Benson's arrival disrupts the family unit that the two have made for each other. Adam came to space to escape Earth (which we're supposed to assume is made unpleasant perhaps by pollution, war or simply the vast numbers that must be crowding it up by then). Alex has never known Earth, which only highlights their apparent generation gap. Benson begins desiring Alex well before he actually gets around to his purported mission, and he figures that Adam's age gives him the edge (monogomay is frowned upon back on Earth, he tells her). It turns out that Benson has come to construct a robot to replace the team's now obsolescent half - Adam, and in this, he throws himself full steam. Benson is so obsessed to complete the menacing robot which will replace Adam, that you begin to wonder which of his loves really rules his dark soul: Alex or the robot. When completed, the vaguely humanoid machine stands about 8 feet high, moves convincingly and menacingly robot-like and is topped with an incongruous thing that looks like a desk lamp. Called Hector, the robot's CPU is a large clear can containing what looks like human brain matter. Not talkative at the outset, the machine (a model ominously called a 'demigod') picks up fast when linked into Keitel's brain through a remote sensor Keitel implants into the base of his own spine (a striking precursor to the decades-newer \\"Matrix\\"). Unfortunately, the neural link also gets the 'bot past the firewall guarding Benson's soul, and we learn through the robot a dark thing or two about Benson - notably that he failed a probably important course, likely one meant to ensure that artificial intelligence would never be tainted by interface with a natural-born psychotic. Unsurprisingly, the machine not only becomes psychotic as well, but decides that Benson is an obstacle to be replaced much as Benson had planned for Adam. Soon, Adam and Alex are on the run from Hector, learning to quickly duck in and out of hydraulic doors and weave through cramped ventilator shafts.<br />This was a pretty slim flick which gets more mileage than it should out of Farrah Fawcett. Her character is vulnerable and compulsively dependent throughout the movie, never displaying the resourcefulness that Sigourney Weaver had established for a new generation of sci-fi heroines in 'Alien' (which came out the year before). Alex has to be the last female character to faint out of fear in a sci-fi film.  We never get an insight into Keitel's character either - obsessed with both Hector and Fawcett. The two can't both be paramount in his mind. You get the idea that to Benson, the robot is just a means to get Alex; but there are scenes when Keitel tries to get into the robot's head, making it a more substantial part of his own psyche. It's incredible to think that Martin Amis had anything to do with this story which, among other things, is strikingly unsurprising. (Case in point: when first demonstrated, Hector crushes a can Benson had ordered the robot to give Adam. There isn't a person on the planet who couldn't guess Kirk Douglas's response: 'I'm glad you didn't tell him to shake my hand.')<br />On the plus side, the visuals are nice. The sets were obviously influenced by Alien at the time, but today look more like a cross between the drab utilitarian interiors of that film and the way-out futurism of visionary artist Chesley Bonestell (the space station, ships and starscapes recall the famous artist's vision) and the thin story will keep you watching - just not that much.  But above all, the real attraction is Harvey Keitel - who speaks in a very precise accent.  It's Keitel as you've never seen him before (with a cool euro-looking ponytail).  You know that the robot will go for him first, and his loss is what kills this film as much as his presence gives it a life that (like the robot) it doesn't really deserve.
0380788624|4.0|I was given this book as a birthday/x-mas gift this past December, it just so happens that I was off due to surgery and I spent alot of time in bed. This book was like chicken soup for me. I couldn't put it down. I truly loved it.<br />I am not a techie but several of my closest friends are. I have just enough knowledge of Unix/Linux and the paranoia of the first generation internet geeks (I worked for a fledgling ISP part-time in '94-'95) that I actually laughed out loud throughout the book.<br />I have not read a novel in years and NEVER read one this long before. I just couldn't put it down. I extended my time off from work just to stay home and finish it! (I am also in graduate school and I don't have much time to read for pleasure)<br />The only thing that I can say is that the ending was disappointing. It had such a dramatic climax and *POW* it was over...Sequal?
B00005JKBC|4.0|this was a movie I've watched more then once to really understand. I feel that Robert Redford and Brad Pitt gave a very solid performance. And if you like moves you need to think through you'll like this, we did.
B00004T8RK|2.0|I don't normally write reviews, but I feel giving this album 4 stars is completely out of step. I am simply writing this review to possibly balance the diehards. I am a big Pearl Jam fan, and I really enjoyed Yield. I just didn't feel like there was any direction or drive whatsoever on this album. The songs will build to what is hopefully a dramatic plain, but just don't seem to reach their ultimate destination. Maybe I'm rating this too low, but I expect much, much more out of a Pearl Jam album. It almost seems as if the band recorded this album with other thoughts on their minds, and missed the mark with the music. I see the potential in many of the songs, but that is what is most disappointing about Binaural. It seems as if they had just spent more time preparing themselves for this record, they would have undoubtedly produced a gem, like most of their previous work.
B000002INJ|5.0|Es un disco memorable, todo aquel que guste del metal y buen rock en general devera escucharlo, es envidiable la manera en que Manowar combina la potenca,la rabia, con la meloda.Incluso creo que grupos ms famosos no lo logran, as como que este es un disco muy fresco y para nada aburrido. <BR>Si hubiera algo crtico para decir, sera hacerca de sus letras, pero yo  como hispano hablante conscidero que en el rock, no es tan iportante lo que se dice, sino como se dice(como opinara John Lennon), y si que me he percatado!.<BR>Es impresionante la nostalgia o aoranza por esa...&quot;gloria y pureza&quot; pica de la poca medieval que ellos ambientan, &quot;Heart of Steel&quot; es un verdadero clsico, as como todo el disco segn mi opinin.
0790733226|4.0|I like the way this movie attempted to put a realistic portrayal on the media frenzy and world wide reaction of our Setti sattlelites transmitting extra terrestial messages. The manner to which that was done was believable. <BR>Nevertheless, &quot;Contact's&quot; ending felt incomplete and it didn't satisfy me. I know this movie is based on a book by Carl Sagan  but, this movie would have been better served  if the director took artisitc liberties by offering a concrete explanation about the aliens who sent the messages rather then leaving that as an open topic that can be loosely interepreted through science and religion.
B00006NSZ5|4.0|I have found myself more and more impressed with what Shady has to offer. He alwayz seemz hungry, like he's alwayz on the grind and never willing to give in. & alwayz fighting with each word spoken for what he strivez for, he seemz to be limitless, az hiz successed yet still hungered appetite atonez. 8MILE iz just the next example. Shady Recz haz put together a great soundtracc. Not since the Row (bacc in the day) have we seen a rap record lable put out great work based loosely on a movie. 50 Cent, before the 8MILE OST, waz just another New York cat that I never really concerned my thoughtz with. After owning the 8M OST for 8 weekz, I am now looking forward to hiz albumz to drop, and Im pickin up hiz release the day it dropz. Im anticipatin it more than OBI TRICE. & Em's Rabbit Run waz an opertunity for Em to really manipulate the microphone, just really push hiz wordz and voice. He iz still steadily improving. I do recommend the OST, az much az I do the EShow LP.
0679809015|5.0|We received this book as a gift (and I'm giving it as one today) and it has been a lifesaver.  We used it dozens of times a day from the time our daughter was about 8 months until now (20 months).  She still oves it and we finally had to buy a second copy (she chewed on it a lot).  It stands up to abuse really well, but this was too much to ask of any paper-based product.  I wish there were more like this one.  It's great for your purse or diaper bag, in the stroller etc.
B00006C79E|5.0|Saint Etienne changes their sound dramatically yet again, from the ethereal lounge sound of the Sound of Water and Interlude albums and the crystal clear swinging 60s sound of Good Humour. This time they borrow a lot of the 80s-retro electroclash sound, and you'll probably never hear a more inspired presentation of the genre. I was skeptical, I didn't think they could reinvent themselves again, but Sarah's voice is a beautiful and sublime contrast to the heavy punkish beats. This is a very catchy album, and one that has a strong theme throughout, a celebration of London life.  And the first time the lyrics actually seem meaningful.<br />Possibly their best work ever, up there with Good Humour. Pay attention to \\"The Way We Live Now,\\" the conclusion to the best song on Sound of Water, \\"How We Used to Live.\\"
B000002WEH|5.0|I have always been a fan and believe me if you are not a fan<BR>after listening to this cd you will be.It's not hard to understand why he was famous.. Every song is better than the one before. I'll hold you in my heart and Any day now are two of my favorites. If you want to get your moneys worth, buy this cd. It's the one I play over and over again and never tire of it.
0783114222|4.0|OK, The Right Stuff is one of my favorite movies of all times, but it was a movie.  You sat down and watched it front to back and felt like you knew more about the Mercury program and the people in it.<br />Well, From the Earth to the Moon gives you that same feel like you know the people, but the mini-series format really kills that sense of story you got with The Right Stuff.<br />Look, if you are a space buff, buy this and watch it with your kids when they are old enough to handle the language (which gets a little rough around the edges at times).
B00006CXXU|5.0|Can't Hold Us Down (feat. Lil' Kim): I'm not a huge fan of this song, but it has a good beat.<br />Walk Away: This song is so powerful.  There is none of the synthesized pop vocals we saw on Genie in a Bottle and the like.  This is purw, raw talent.  She sings her heart out.<br />Fighter: Cute album track.  Love the bridge on this song.<br />Infatuation: Very sensual and melodic.<br />Loving Me For Me: Yes, this is Mariah-esque (think &quot;Bliss&quot; from Rainbow), but she pulls it off.  I'm not a fan of adding spoken parts to songs, because I think it comes off as cheesy instead of candid. <br />Impossible: Wow.  This collabo with Alicia Keys is fantastic, musically, lyrically, and vocally.<br />Underappreciated: Kinda weak, overdrawn, R&amp;B track.<br />Beautiful: This song is perfect.  It's not juvenile, as some reviewers have indicated.  Look at Beatles songs. Were they written with a bunch of 50-cent words?  Nope.  And they're pretty powerful, huh?  So is this.  <br />Make Over: The weakest cut on the album.  I think Kelly Osbourne should be singing this. Ick.<br />Cruz: A really inspired, moving song.  Again, her voice shines here.<br />Soar: Sounds like it should be in a Disney movie, or maybe the Olympics.<br />Get Mine, Get Yours: Love this track.  Very sensual.<br />Dirrty: Great song.  Fabulous beat and great vocals.<br />A Voice Within: An okay song - not single matierial though<br />I'm OK: Very honest and sad.  Not simplistic at all.  Lyrically it's actually pretty good.  She's telling the story of abuse though a child's eyes.<br />Singing My Song: Nice, inspirational end track.  You go, Christina.<br />(...)<br />Get Mine, Get Yours - 9/10.  I like the melody to this song because it's very urban, but I hate the lyric \\"I want your body, not your heart.\\"  I would recommend this song as background music.<br />Dirrty (featuring Redman) - 7/10.  Everyone pretty much already knows this song.  It's danceable and Redman's part is fun, but the lyrics are pretty tired.<br />The Voice Within - 6/10.  Another Mariah Carey-esque, sappy song.<br />I'm Ok - 10/10.  This song doesn't have a memorable melody, but the lyrics will always stick in your head.  Props to Christina for being so brave and vulnerable with this song.  It makes me feel really sorry for her and her voice is so emotional.<br />Keep On Singin My Song - 9/10.  This is an OK song, by the end of the album you get kind of tired of the \\"I'm stronger than yesterday\\" theme.<br />Overall, I'd recommend this album to r&b and ballad lovers.
B000059HAI|5.0|Along with Patton, one of the better movies about WWII. Patton focusses on the European 'theatre' and largely on the personalities of Patton and his arch-rival, fellow Allied commander Montgomery, though both largely represent the Allied point of view, even if Tora attempts to be even-handed, without ultimately showing the extent to which Japan was being threatened, harassed and hounded by the US, which was determined to keep Japan a second or third-rate power in the Pacific. Blasted as the 'day of infamy' by FDR, this movie shows the attack as a desperate attempt by Japan to ward off American acts to curb Japanese aggression in Asia. Japan of course, saw European colonialism as hypocrisy.     At the present time (2003), North Korea's eccentric dictator blusters that 'an embargo would be an act of war'. In 1941, America had imposed an oil embargo on Japan - which in the end led to the attack on Pearl, which in turn justified the American nuclear attacks on Japan, which recent historians have judged were militarily unnecessary, as Japan was all too ready to surrender before they were dropped.....    Although a documentary-type film it is fascinating - the 2001-2 Pearl Harbour movie is contemptible by comparison.     The scenes of the Japanese carriers in the turbulent night seas are particularly realistic - one feels on is on the carriers seeing the Japanese planes take-off. Similarly, the bombing of the harbour is painstakingly recreated - no computer trickery here. And the music, a combo of Japanese and Western by Jerry Goldsmith - underscores the drama,the tragedy,the foreboding of greater tragedies to come - as well as the sense of inevitability.  .

B00000DLUV|5.0|Still having a hard time coming to grips with the events of this past week - such a sad loss.  I love all styles of music (jazz, rock, alternative, blues), however, I profoundly connect to groups that can blend their voices in harmony (Bee Gees, CSN, Eagles, Beatles).  When one of the voices in silenced, it is a profound loss.  A critic mentioned that the Bee Gees achieved an even deeper level of harmony - a level only achieved through a family connection - I believe it.  Have been wearing out Bee Gee CD's.  This CD is a beautifully produced, lively celebration of some great music (I also have the DVD video).  I'm thankful the world woke up in the past few years and recognized the talents of these three.  Genuinely gifted artists and what appear to be genuinely kind people.
B000002J03|4.0|ok, here i go on my first review. it may not really have anything to do with the album, but i am angry, disappinted and upset to see that one reviewer has misspelt the name odf track one. &quot;YOU FOOL&quot; the song is &quot;whole lotta love&quot;, not as you incorrectly said &quot;whole lot of love&quot;
B00006LI4S|3.0|I was the biggest Pink Floyd Fan in the 1970s and 1980s.  Admittedly, I think the Floyd dropped on my greatness scale when Roger Waters left the band (in spite of no longer having to put up with his ego).  Anyway, this DVD is a mostly acoustic collection of what David Gilmour likes--not exactly what his fans would've selected for a concert DVD.  After watching this one, I am even more convinced that Dave is an impressively melodic and creative electic guitarist/soloist.  However, you'll see that he is pretty weak (bland) overall on his acoustic playing (sorry!).  The rather eclectic group of musicians does OK, but it doesn't look like they mix well.  For the Pink Floyd fan, given the choice between this DVD and Roger Waters' &quot;In The Flesh,&quot;  I would hands down go with Roger's show....it just has a better ensemble of musicians, the sound quality is far better, the video shots are far better, and the music is (dare I say) better than even Pink Floyd.  So, David Gilmour is one heck of a guitarist overall, but it truly doesn't show on this DVD.  So, he gets a B-minus:  3 of 5 stars.  Maybe next time!
B000000H66|5.0|This is absolutely THE best metal album in history....thus far.  I doubt any metal band will ever  make an album that can stand up to \\"Symbolic.\\"  Still way ahead of it's time, this will fly over most listeners heads the first few times, but not becuase it's hard on the ears.  This is music that requires a listeners full attention becuase there is so much to take in.  I consider Chuck a composer who was in the same league as Beethoven.  Every musician who contributed to \\"Symbolic\\" is a master of their instrument.  No cheesey satanic lyrics here to speak of either, which so many metal bands resort to in a lame attempt to seem \\"evil.\\"  Chuck's lyrics offer insight into human behavior and the universe that surrounds us.  Screw Metallica, Slayer, Morbid Angel, Emperor, etc., this is as good as it gets.  As the boring corporate bands of today continue to send real people in search of true music, the legacy of Death/Schuldiner will live on.  10+++++++ R.I.P. Chuck.

Unfortunately Reynolds falls way short of the hype concerning both him and the book. Far from a new Science-Fiction genius, he is...<br />As we all have learned the hard way, great ideas do not a great story make. Anyone can come up with plenty of interesting ideas upon which to base a plot, only a very few authors manage to squeak something interesting out of them. Reynolds has not yet shown this ability.<br />Reynolds has a lot to learn about telling a story. For starters, I felt no emphathy, or even mild ambivelance to any of the characters. Who is the protagonist? Sylveste? His father? Are they the good guys, the antagonists or anti-heroes? Are the good guys the crew of the light huggers? How come such a complex ship is run by only six people? Then why do you need them altogether? Why was this book so long?<br /><br />I can really go on and on like this for hours, but that would be boring.<br />Reynolds has made many of the same errors that new authors make. [Most were probably at the urging of his publisher...] He mistakes details with plot. He thinks that a complex story is a compelling story. He thinks that cool technology can take the place of cool characters.<br />To be fair, the story has an excellent ending, but it is not worth the trip. I'd also give Reynolds good marks for at least trying to avoid information dumps. He doesn't always succeed.<br />Don't believe the hype. Don't waste your time reading it. 80% of this book is only barely tangential to the story.
0884271536|3.0|The points this book makes are great - once you wade through the \\"fable\\" part.  The rambling discussions of the characters often makes it hard to focus on the concept being discussed. The key points could have been covered within a chapter if all the fluff was cut.  That said, the concepts are useful - as is the concise summation of \\"The Goal\\" offered by one of the characters.
B00006RIO7|5.0|Following on the heels of Moulin Rouge, Chicago takes the broadway musical one step further and dances across the silver screen.<br />Fans of the musical need not worry, all actors are decent singers, if not great singers. Although Top 40 need not worry about having these actors on their charts, they all do a decent job.<br />Chicago follows the story of Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) and Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) as two women on murderer's row for killing their partners. Both hire Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) as their attorney who is sure to get them off. Queen Latifah shines as Mama Morton as the &quot;keeper of the keys.&quot;<br />The soundtrack includes all songs in the film as well as some songs not included such as &quot;Class,&quot; &quot;I Move On (new song) and Queen Latifah, Lil Kim and Macy Gray do a soulful job of remaking the Cell Block Tango. Anastacia adds a cut, Love is a Crime and although the main review doesnt make this cut shine, it totally showcases her voice.<br />Stand out tracks include the Cell Block Tango, When you are Good to Mama, Roxie.<br />Chicago will shine at the Oscars and the soundtrack is going to rule CD players across the lands. Get on the bus, and get the CD. You'll be hip, you'll be &quot;Roxie!&quot;
B00006F7S4|5.0|I bought this album after the Christmas holidays after reading a million &quot;top 10 of 2002&quot; lists with this included.   I've dabbled with Beck Albums before, mostly played with friends over for a change from either normal classic or alternative rock.  I've always found most of Beck's rifts and melodies a little harsh if listened to often.<br />This album is different.   It's a wonderful album for daily listening.   The melodies are gorgeous with sublime intrumentation and mixes.   Beck is a brilliant musician and writer and this album truly shows his creativity and ability to go outside the box fame, fans or the industry might have created for him.   It's a first rate album.   Great dinner date music or background to getting things done around the house.   I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys music that doesn't have to drown out everything else in order to be good.
0066214122|3.0|I felt like this book was well written, almost scary in its plotting.  Then Crichton looked at his watch and decided the book was over and ended it.  Still, I'll pick up a Crichton book anytime for a good read!!
0553260111|5.0|This is an excellent novel by the great Robert Ludlum.  The author has a way that makes everything really mysterious and keeps the reader intrigued. The characters are all very interesting. This is the story of a man who knows nothing of what he is.  He has lethal skills, but no idea how he got them. It is the story of his journey to find his own idenity. The Bourne Idenity is an awesome book...I give it the  best rating I can (5 stars out of 5 stars).  I suggest you read this novel.
B000002J1M|5.0|While 1970's TRESPASS may have been the first small sight of greatness for the then-young (barely in their 20s) Genesis, it still didn't transfer into substantial sales. Granted, bands like Yes & Emerson, Lake & Palmer sold millions of albums almost solely based on FM radio airplay & endless touring, but Genesis couldn't even get on the radio in their early days. 1971's NURSERY CRYME bettered TRESPASS by a country mile & it's a shock that they remained in obscurity even after retooling their line-up again to include guitarist Steve Hackett & drummer Phil Collins. But the music-buying public began to welcome Genesis with open arms (at least in Europe) on their follow-up, 1972's FOXTROT.<br /><br />What made NURSERY CRYME a huge improvement over Genesis' first two albums was that they no longer sounded self-conscious or eager to impress. They were already great musicians, but that was when Genesis seemed to sound sure enough to be themselves & was also a watershed for Peter Gabriel in the vocal department. All those things just got even greater with FOXTROT, which even now is an album that will satisfy both progressive & pop lovers of Genesis.<br /><br />\\"Watcher Of The Skies\\" was a deserved concert staple in the early days with its eerie Mellotron intro by master Tony Banks before the militaristic drums of young Phil Collins slowly faded in. Live, this intro may have been extended into a tour-de-force of its own, but sounds just as fantastic in the abbreviated version here. Peter demonstrates the more confident vocal style he had introduced on CRYME & his lyrics about the view of Earth from a spaceship reach an enviable high in his early output. The song's performance on the then-upcoming GENESIS LIVE (1973) would be a considerable leap from the one on FOXTROT.<br /><br />\\"Time Table\\" has always struck me as a lesser entry on FOXTROT, but as some have said, it would have made a decent single for the band & result in some overdue attention beyond their cult following. On an album that is the definition of \\"progressive rock\\", this song is the closest to pure pop, but of course you didn't expect them to totally cave in commercially at this early stage.<br /><br />\\"Get 'Em Out By Friday\\" again shows the growth that just spontaneously happened after only 2 albums with more of Peter's slice-of-life lyrics about tenement dwellers & another virtuoso performance by Genesis (fellow progressive rockers were probably floored by what they heard). Another tune that would grow immeasurably when played in concert, \\"Friday\\" is still a dazzler in this somewhat progressive-rock-free atmosphere of today.<br /><br />\\"Can-Utility & The Coastliners\\" is every bit of a hidden gem on FOXTROT & I imagine this didn't get much mileage on stage, which is a shame. The lyrics are both inscrutable & a touch of genius, seeming to be about the progressive rock standard of war. One critic was right in calling Peter's words the work of \\"Ray Davies on acid\\". I think this would have been a good single, too, but maybe the title & its editable length would have turned off most radio stations.<br /><br />\\"Horizons\\" is Steve Hackett's acoustic instrumental that could easily be considered space-filler, but it shows that Hackett was the perfect guitarist for Genesis in their progressive period. I rather consider it to be an intro for the work of art that follows.<br /><br />\\"Supper's Ready\\" has my vote for THE best progressive rock \\"song\\" (more like a suite) of all time! Even better than Yes' \\"Close To The Edge\\" or ELP's \\"Tarkus\\", how the band could stay locked in for 22 minutes & not lose their place is unfathomable. If you thought the lyrics were already great on the previous songs, Peter just shoots into the stratosphere here with a good-vs.-evil tale inspired by a nightmare of his then-wife Jill. The 7-part work is a veritable rock symphony with the last part doing it for me; as soon as Peter sings about travelling to \\"the new Jerusalem\\", you're waiting for the SecondComing to happen anytime! The fact that \\"Supper's Ready\\" fades out rather than finally end just shows Genesis were probably the only band that could have made an epic like this work & not wear on the listener's nerves. An obvious stunner when done in concert, I've yet to hear a version of it, but I hear Phil Collins' vocal version on 1977's SECONDS OUT is supposed to be surprisingly done well.<br /><br />Just when it seemed Genesis was almost destined to remain cult favorites, FOXTROT wound up being their first chart entry in England & their increasingly-ambitious stage shows were only helping to increase their fanbase. While the physical & mental exhaustion would soon do a huge number on the band (especially on Peter Gabriel) & drive a wedge between them, the enthusiasm that is apparent on FOXTROT shows Genesis were in the prime of their lives creatively & had no place from here to go but up.Coming to happen anytime!

6305127689|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorites. When I saw this in the theaters, after the first two minutes I leaned over to my wife and said that it was great and already worth the admission price. I still think that.<br />The editing is great. The camera and special effects are great. The sound is great. The cinematography is great. The transfer to DVD is great. There seems to be a trend here.
B00005A46T|5.0|This effort from Slipknot shows why they have such a devoted following. From the onset, 'knot assaults the senses. It picks you up ; slaps you around ; throws you against the wall, kicks and punches you in the gut... Leaving you to beg for more. This CD has been in my constant rotation since it came out (along with the digi-pak). This is the way metal should be. Cory sounds as (sic) as ever and Mick's guitar work is as dark as 'pitch'. You will not be unhappy with this purchase, as long as you have \\"11\\" on your stereo. peace...
6305842418|5.0|This was one of the first DVDs on the market and it was done very well. The special effects are great (the kind where they are so good that you do not realize that they are special effects). The sound is very good. The movie itself is very good. The actors are excellent and help move the plot along at a good clip. Although somewhat predictable, it seems more true-to-life than many films. I have bought several hundred DVDs and sold many, but this is one that I plan to keep.
B00005U2JL|5.0|I have been a fan of Manson since the Antichrist Superstar era. I must say, I was a little hesitant at first purchasing this DVD. I haven't been a big fan of live DVDs (with exception of NIN: AATCHB DVD) because the quality usually disappoints me. However, this DVD was made to near perfection. The mixing was great. I saw in another review that someone didn't like how each song had different shots from different concerts, leaving you \\"confused.\\" Unless you are entirely stupid, you will not be confused. It was one continuous soundtrack, but the shots match up perfectly (or almost perfectly) with what he is actually saying to how his mouth is moving.. he only appears in different costume. This DVD is great, and the 30 min \\"death parade\\" also exemplifies how much more of an intelligent man Mr MAN5ON is. Dont miss out on this DVD.
B000002IV8|3.0|When guitarist Bobby Gustafson departed, Overkill made the wise decision of replacing him with two talented axe men. As a result of this personnel change, the band's compositions began to exhibit some new elements... such as two-part melodies and adventurous lead trade-offs. These changes first became apparent on Overkill's fifth release, \\"Horrorscope\\" (arguably the group's finest album). It appeared as though the veteran thrashers were going in a more progressive direction (a trajectory wisely assumed by some death metal musicians, like Chuck Schuldiner).<br />On \\"I Hear Black,\\" however, the band amalgamates the groove/thrash elements of Pantera with the grunge style of Alice in Chains. The final product is an album that oscillates between the ferocity of metal and the mundane tedium of contemporary Seattle rock. <br />Now, don't misunderstand. There are definitely some great tracks on \\"I Hear Black.\\" \\"Dreaming in Columbian,\\" \\"World of Hurt,\\" and the title track are some powerful songs with interesting melodies. Merritt Gant and Rob Cannavino exchange some impressive runs. Bobby Blitz explores a wider range of vocal choices, occasionally shifting to a lower register. D.D.Verni lays down heavy rhythms replete with creative embellishments. \\"I Hear Black\\" is certainly a work of substantial merit.<br />Yet, it becomes evident with this sixth effort that Overkill is somewhat restrained. They fail to fully exploit their newly acquired dual axe attack. Radical though it may sound, the group could have amalgamated its traditional thrash style with the progressive guitar interplay common to bands like Queensryche and Crimson Glory. Overkill come close to breaking new ground with \\"I Hear Black,\\" but don't stretch far enough.
0671015206|5.0|Great book.  There isn't any spoonfeeding...  just statistics that help you draw your own conclusions.  There are many lessons to be learned in this book.
B00006RIO7|4.0|The soundtrack recording of Kander &amp; Ebb's &quot;Chicago&quot; is a surprise and a delight.  As a Broadway purist, I really had doubts about a filmed version of any Broadway musical, let alone one as quasi-traditional as &quot;Chicago&quot;.  Rest assured, it is fairly true to the original (and 1996 revival).  The vocalists are fine (not belters, but good anyway); orchestrations good (a little slim, but authentic to the period); and material relatively unscathed (although trimmed). But what is with the 'material inspired by Chicago' on the end of the album?  Is it really necessary to accommodate and mislead a non-musical audience into believing these artists are part of the film? 4 stars for underutilized CD booklet (jacket).  With the possible return of movie musicals to theatre screens, wouldn't it have been interesting to know just how &amp; why &quot;Chicago&quot; came to the big screen??
B00006RIO7|5.0|This album is wonderful! Renee and Catherine and Richard sing so well! If you haven't seen the film..buy the album now then GO SEE the MOVIE!! If you liked Moulin Rouge, then you'll undoubtedly like Chicago. The sounds of the roaring 20's pulsate throughout the whole CD. I especially enjoy track 4 (the Cell Block Tango)and track 6 (They Both Reached for the Gun). I hope Hollywood continues to bring back the movie-musical. Moulin Rouge and Chicago definately prove that not only can a musical put butts in the seats, but also produce a great soundtrack!
B00004YRQA|5.0|Its a memory card. If You need one... get one.<br />Thats all I can say.
B00006SFBD|5.0|At first I really didn't like this CD at all. I really just couldn't get into it. But after listening to it a lot recently it's finally grown on me.. and WOW, I'm glad it has! This is one of their best works for sure. It lacks the beautiful clean parts that I have grown to love Opeth for(although that's what Damnation is for) but all the heavy parts are just wonderful! This is really an amazing cd. Go buy it and let it grow on you, you will not be dissapointed!
B00004WG2X|5.0|My absolute favorite version of this classic! I'm on my second set of vcr tapes and am hoping they release it on dvd. A&amp;E version can't hold a candle to this one!
B00006LWSF|4.0|The 8 Mile soundtrack is being given a lot of publicity mainly because the movie is such a success. However, I think everyone's making too much of a big deal about it. I listened to the CD with high expectations and was left thinking, 'That's it??' Sure, the songs by Eminem are pretty hot (actually they're very hot) but others, such as \\"Spit Shine\\" (XZIBIT), \\"U wanna be me\\" (Nas), \\"R.A.K.I.M\\" (Rakim) and \\"That's my Nigga fo' real\\" (Young Zee) had very similar beats and had me skipping over to the next song before they were even finished! As for \\"Adrenaline Rush\\" (Obie Trice), the excessive use of the word [explicit word]kinda got boring after a while. I like the feminine touch added by \\"Time of my Life\\" (Macy Gray) and \\"Wasting my time\\" (Boomkat), but I've gotta say, the only ones probably worth listening to again are \\"Lose Yourself\\", \\"Love Me\\", \\"Rap Game\\", \\"8 Miles and Runnin'\\", \\"Wanksta\\", \\"Battle\\" and \\"Rabbit Run\\". My fave song on the whole CD was by far, \\"8 Mile\\". It's gonna be huge!<BR>In conclusion, if you're after Eminem only, maybe this isn't the one for you.
0780627024|5.0|This movie got it's biggest publicity for the special effects dealing with two teenagers getting sent through a television to become characters in a popular 1950's sitcom that names the movie.  For this part, it is deserved.  We see the teens in color getting sucked into the TV (this is not giving away anything), where they are transformed into an entirely black and white 1950's world, ala \\"Leave it to Beaver\\" with older kids.  As the movie progresses, color gets gradually introduced to certain elements, which must have taken a lot of painstaking work, even with computers.<br />But it's how they use the colors that makes the story special.  For there is a method to how things in the TV world start turning to color.  Moralists may dismiss it as just [excited] teens who start getting colorized upon exploring sexual adventures.  However, it's not that at all.  If so, the wonderful Reese Witherspoon would have been colorized right away, and wonders why she isn't.  It's her discovery of what actually sets off the color that makes the movie great, which I will not reveal here. <br />Extra special kudos to veteran sitcom star Don Knotts as the instigator of the whole thing.  He is perfect as the person responsible for sending them there, and at first wanting them to stay awhile.  It's when the teens don't really want to come back at a certain point in the movie that you see the old Barney Fife nervousness unleashed.  This was an added gem.
B000065U1N|1.0|British director Ridley Scott showed us a real depiction of modern warfare where the americans are true heroes. With a great photographer that captures the beauty of (Morocko... uhum, I mean) Mogadishu and the essence of combat (Hooten taking the turret of a humvee to blast down the rooftop-hiding-somalis in fine Rambo fashion). He also had a great editor and composer (poor Pietro Scalia and Hans Zimmer not getting the proper time because they had to put this piece of waste together for the Academy Awards where it won 2 oscars, could you believe that?) and not to forget about the writer of the screenplay Ken Nolan (Thanks Ken for being spineless). The cast is great with Josh Hartnett as Sergeant Matt Eversmann(he's the new Tom Cruise) leading the heavies including Tom Sizemore as Lieutenant Danny McKnight (walking along the battlefield with bullets hiting everything else except him), Eric Bana as (John \\"Mace\\" Macejunas no I mean) Norm \\"Hoot(?)\\" Hooten and Sam Sheperd as General Garrison.<br />All three have some great scenes like when Garrison interrogates mr. Atto.<br />Atto: \\"What do you think this is, the K.O Corall?\\"<br />Garrison: \\"It was the O.K Corall.\\"<br />(Yeah, hu, hu, the sorry [man] didn't even know that it was called the O.K instead of K.O and that Garrison didn't come from Arkansas but Texas.)<br />Or the ending scene when Hartnett takes farewell of Smith.<br />Eversmann: \\"A friend asked me when we were shipping out. Why do you go and fight somebody elses war? You think you're heroes or something? I didn't know what to say at the time but I would say no. No way in hell. Nobody asks to be a hero. It just turns out that way sometimes.\\"<br />(Now answer the first question)<br />But my favourite scenes include aussie Eric Bana as Norm Hooten.<br />Hoot: \\"When I come back home people ask me. Why do you do it Hoot? Are you some kind of warjunkie and I won't say a goddamn word. Because they don't understand. It's about the guys next to you, that's all it is.\\"<br />...<br />Eversmann: \\"Can I come with you?\\"<br />Hoot: \\"No. I work better alone.\\"<br />(What happened to the guys next to you?)<br />I think this movie only comes out with one good line and that is once again: Norm Hooten.<br />  Norm \\"Hoot\\" Hooten<br />  \\"When that first bullet flies past your head,<br />  politics goes right out the window.\\"ersmann: \\"Can I come with you?\\"<BR>Hoot: \\"No. I work better alone.\\"<BR>(What happened to the guys next to you?)<br />I think this movie only comes out with one good line and that is once again: Norm Hooten.<br />                         Norm \\"Hoot\\" Hooten<BR>           \\"When that first bullet flies past your head,<BR>                politics goes right out the window.\\"
B00005JKZ3|2.0|The only reason this gets an extra star is for the creative energy that went into creating the alien forms in the movie.  There are different ones from the first, including an entire population which live, in all things, a locker.  It's obvious a lot of work went into this part of the film, and for me was it's only enjoyable part.  <br />This movie has the same problem with the third Austin Powers film \\"Goldmember\\".  The originals of both of these series introduced us to goofy new worlds that did take chances.  With Powers, there was the fun of seeing a 60's character adapt to the 90's.  With \\"Men in Black\\", we got to see Will Smith see the alien world that has been all around him without him even noticing.  <br />With both of these series, that innocence is gone, and there's nothing new to replace it.  In this film, we get another alien threat from another world, and the guys have to find and blast it away.  This time the guns are bigger and fancier and new aliens are introduced, but other than that, you are seeing virtually the same movie.  If this is your cup of tea, enjoy, but for me it was a waste of time.  Even my four kids, who usually eat this stuff up, weren't that enthused about it at all.
B000065U1N|5.0|This is how to do an adaptation of Mark Bowdens excellent book. <BR>Bowden started to write a script and some of the scenes he wrote is still in the movie. <BR>But it's Jerry Bruckheimer that we should thank for this piece of american cinema. After such a fantastic movie like \\"Top Gun\\" that really showed us how american fighter pilots kicked russian [butt] during the cold war. <BR>Now he put up money for a two and a half hour movie that accuratelly shows how Rangers and Deltas was sent to Mogadishu Somalia during 1993 to put a stop to that no good warlord Mohammed Farrah Aidid. They were going in to capture some of Aidids top men when the operation went bad. First young rookie Blackburn fell from a helicopter and then a Black Hawk got hit and went down. The americans were ready to pull out because their mission was over and now had to go back in to save the crew of the downed Black Hawk. Ridley Scott puts us right into the battle carnage with the most realistic violence ever seen on film. One of the best scenes is when Delta Operator Daniel Bush wounded from the first helicopter crash takes out a number of somali militia by himself with bullets riping into the ground and his arms and legs while RPG's fly through the air just missing him. The other one is when the pilot of the second crashed Black Hawk is attacked by dozens of somalis and despite his broken legs he picks up an H&K Mp5 in one hand and put eight of them. Not to forget the heroism of Delta snipers Gary Gordon and Randy Shughart when they went in to save him and end up fighting a whole mob of somalis increasing the bodycount. In a horrible scene Shughart is murdered by the evil somalis.<BR>After this they go after the pilot who is now out of bullets and faces certain death.<BR>In the end, \\"nineteen americans lost their lives and thousand somalis got killed\\" (but they had it coming messing with the great UNITED STATES of AMERICA, and the somalis are scum anyway so who cares right?). In the end with all the support this movie got we can expect it to become a true american classic.
0060975768|5.0|There is a part of this book that takes it from being a very good war story to an exceptional account of human behavior.  It is near the halfway point, when the author takes time to cover the human side of the enemy.  It would seem that the enemy, were actually people.  They wrote poetry, kept detailed diaries, and looked at pictures of their loved ones between battles.  Kind of takes the edge off the illiterate ... peasant impression we are often left with when dealing with the commies.<br />The book's main focus is on a few days of intense battle during the Vietnam war.  It seems like a lot longer, as an incredible amount of carnage happens in this short time.  The intensity of the battle scenes is as descriptive as I've ever read, actually getting scary for quite a bit of the story. <br />There was a time reading this book when I thought it would be lacking in writing pace.  That is, way too much action without a breather.  That would have been a minor flaw in an otherwise exceptional book.  But even that is a not a problem, as the book winds up appropriately.  <br />It begins with a brief history of Vietnam, and pulls no punches by stating that maybe we should have not stuck our noses in there in the first place, given the incredible cost in human life.  But a soldier follows orders, even when it means walking through grass so tall you don't see people coming your way until they are a few feet from you.  Having to decide whether that person is friend or foe in the split second you have must have been a terrifying experience.  <br />And so it goes for battle after battle. While it may not be of interest to have the names of many killed listed to the reader, hey, these guys paid the ultimate price and deserve recognition.  The book also wisely winds down at the end, giving the stories of what happened to the few who survived the carnage.  Some of these stories are happy, some sad, but that's the point.  These were ordinary people thrown into extraordinary situations, and their return to \\"normal\\" life would never look the same again.  <br />This book should be required reading.
0060523794|4.0|I joined IBM about 9 months ago, so this book was interesting to me in understanding some of the culture of my new company.  But I also found it generally quite well written, and very easy to read --- I finished the whole thing in a few hours on a plane.
B00006RIO7|5.0|Great soundtrack, fabulous movie.  I loved the movie, and having the soundtrack to cart around with me is great.  If only the music they make today could contend with what used to be....<BR>Bottom line, if you love musicals you need to to both watch the movie and buy this cd.  Not a single song on here is bad, its all incredible:)
B00004SU5J|5.0|...On the jazz station I heard \\"Sure Thing\\" from this \\"Tourist\\" CD and I found myself listening to it about ten different times .... I wrote down the title and the artist (who I had never heard of) and I bought the CD as soon as I got back, along with \\"Boulevard...,\\" St. Germain's remixed previous album. I can add little to the raves that are already posted. I love both cds ...Wonderful music, so creative and so deep. If you don't have it, and you like jazz that goes bump in the night...you're in for a treat. My favorite tunes are still \\"Sure Thing\\" from \\"Tourist\\" and \\"Alabama Blues: Todd Edwards Vocal Mix\\" from \\"Boulevard: New Version, the Complete Series.\\" Enjoy!
B000069HK2|5.0|The CD was the most amazing listening experience I have ever had.  They are an amazing band and someday they will change the whole spectrum of music for everyone.  Bert has the most amazing voice, despite being the ugliest man I have ever seen, and the guitar and drums are just so original.  You can try to compare them with another band, but there is no other band who can do so many things so well.
B00006DEFA|5.0|I enjoyed this movie on the television screen some years ago, but the DVD version is superior. Amadeus is doubtless one of the finest movies ever made and the actors' performances are riveting. I'm not a particular fan of Mozart, listen to classic music rarely as I normally prefer rock and r&amp;b, but I don't watch this movie for the music's sake. (The soundtrack is terrific, though.) I watch for entertainment, for historical accuracy and for sheer fascination with a portrayal of characters that intrigue me.<br />Highly recommend this!<br />RDP
1573301183|3.0|It begs the question:  Who was more ...up at the time of this otherwise brilliant Alice In Chains swansong performance; the late Layne Staley for being smacked out of his face or Jerry Cantrell, for allowing this one-of-a-kind live show to be performed (and recorded) with a guitar in desperate need of a truss rod adjustment?<br />><br />It's true, this was arguably the greatest single performance \\"MTV:  Unplugged\\" ever staged, and the DVD captures it that much more brilliantly than the VHS or CD versions of the show could ever hope to...but Cantrell never should've been allowed to take the stage with that guitar.  It becomes evident early on that it has a problem, and nothing is done to correct it.  Unfortunate, really, because the acoustic arrangements of all songs included in the show are fantastic, even those that you'd never suspect could be arranged in such a way (\\"Would?\\" and \\"Sludge Factory\\" being prime examples).<br />><br />Layne Staley's vocal performance is actually quite good, not so weakened by heroin as to deprive his voice of all its strength, but sufficiently enough to add an extra level of pain to the anguished lyrics that were surely more personal to him than anyone else.  He and Cantrell harmonize beautifully and reconfirm Alice's position as the best vocally-represented band from the old \\"Seattle Scene\\".  But Cantrell's guitar just wrecks the performance for me, hence the mediocre review of an overwise unbelievable performance by one of my favorite bands of all time.  If you want a good collection of acoustic music from this band, my recommendations are to try \\"Sap\\" or \\"Jar Of Flies\\" on CD instead; if you want a great live acoustic set, well, unfortunately there aren't many (any?) alternatives to this one from which you can choose.
B00007KMP1|5.0|Sea Change is a truly complete work in the category of roots music. Personally appreciative, but by no means a devotee his previous work(s) -bar Mutations- Sea Change was a winner for me from the first moment. Other reviewers are correct to point out the continued development of themes established in Mutations, therefore if more a fan of his other compositions, Sea Change may not be for you.  The blending of simple acoustic guitar melodies with ambient backing + Beck's signature lyrical style makes for a complex, but definitely roots work that keeps the listener coming back and turns them onto something new almost every time through. As any roots fan will tell you - LET IT GROW.

0553208845|4.0|This book Siddhartha is a great book even if you don't like to read. I not much of a reader and when i read this book I recommended it to all readers. The book is about a man that search for knowledge and wanted to learn about life. As he travled he didn't really know what he wanted. but soon found out what life was really about. I loved this book because it just relates so good to tring to find a way in life.
0553579908|5.0|This is the second novel in the Song of Ice and Fire series and is every bit as good as the first. This is an excellent series - completely enjoyable and exciting. Do not attempt to read this book before reading book one \\"The Game of Thrones\\" as the author does not spend much time on existing character development or detailing in the second novel. Only new characters are fleshed out. Also, many plot points are carried over from the first book and hence, the novel will be very confusing if read alone and not in it's proper place in the series.
B0000630BT|5.0|This is the heaviest, loudest, best, and last to feature good ol' Rob. In the re-mastered version, just like on Screaming For Vengance, you'll either like the #11 track or you won't. It depends on patience. This version gets up to 55:08 in tottal. With out the live track of Leather Rebel it's like 51-52. And the original version gets up to 44-45. Don't expect a lot from the bonus tracks on this &quot;Re-master&quot; set. 17 out of 24 of them are live tracks from all the albums, and most of the remaining 7 bonus tracks are slow tempoed songs.
0385335482|5.0|I love this book! As a very girly girl, I found this book delightful. Light, refreshing and fun, but not boring. <BR>I laughed so hard, but, the characters definately remind me of my life. Sophie paints excellent word pictures and keeps the story moving briskly. <BR>A definate girl book.
B00005K9LK|4.0|Even though I'v never heared Point of Entry I'd say that this is the first Priest album to be loud (you know, like Painkiller and not like Sin After Sin). It's got some true metal classics like \\"The Hellion\\"/Electric Eye\\", \\"Riding on the Wind\\", \\"Bloodstone\\", \\"Devels Child\\", and top of all, the titled track. But for some reason on some of the re-mastered albums they put a live track which is the same song as one of the original tracks. WHY?! It's the same freakin' thing!!!!
B00005JLWL|5.0|Can anyone explain why, though released during the Christmas season, this film was barely promoted?<br />I thoroughly enjoyed the film though I knew little of it and had low expectations. I am a Christian Bale Fan, and found his performance nicely understated, and the support cast to be a nice suprise of name-british actors and actresses. The plot, though derivitive of many recognizable sci-fi themes, was extremely well handled, and the action sequences some of the best I've seen in a film of this kind. Kind of makes me wish this stunt arranger had worked on Blade II or Matrix Reloaded.<br />Don't miss it on DVD!
B00003CXAA|3.0|I rate this DVD collection with a 3-star, and not the movies in the collection.  I'd give the movies a 3 1/2 stars... I don't find them as great as everyone else.  This is kind of like people that enjoy Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey... that was horrible, but somehow people seem to accord it this great deference.<br />The Godfather stories are pretty decent and the acting is great, but come one, I had a hard time understanding some of the lines, especially Marlon Brando and his wheezy, smoky voice (or however you described his performance).<br />As for the transfer, I've seen much much better from older films.  The Godfather was very dark, full of noise and the color was off.  Want a look at a great transfer from an old film?  Try My Fair Lady... seriously, I'm a little disappointed.
0385508417|5.0|Great book, would recomend it to anybody.  Only took about two days to read amazingly.  Good story that shows how much people can work together to get something done. Also great for showing how rediculous some of the Christmas rituals can be, funny and true.
B00006RIO7|4.0|This CD is awesome...I mean by no means does it compare to the original and revival...but it still is awesome...Catherine Zeta-Jones does an awesome job as Velma as does Renee Zelwigger as Roxie...the best tracks are All That Jazz, Funny Hunny, and Class (even thought it is not in the movie)...why 4 stars?  Well I was not all to impressed with Richard Gere...I'm a singer myself and I dunno, is voice is just not appealing to my ear...though I  loved his rendition of We Both Reached for the Gun..also, I didn't really like the rap version of Cell Block Tango...other than that I am thoroughlly impressed...go out and buy the soundtrack today!!!
0553573403|4.0|I am an avid reader of epic fantasies from the likes of J.R.R Tolkien, Terry Brooks, Terry Goodkind, Robin Hobb, and many others. I decided to read this series from George R. R. Martin based on several recommendations from the websites of a few of these authors. I figured that if a published fantasy author is recommending Martin, then he must be good. Right?<br />I have to admit, I enjoyed A Game of Thrones and will soon be starting Book #2. However, for those who enjoy George R. R. Martin or Epic Fantasies in general, you must read Terry Goodkind's The Sword of Truth Series. The first book to read is a Wizard's First Rule. It is by far the best and most original epic fantasy that I have read to date and I have read alot of them.<br />With that said, A Game of Thrones is also very well written and the world that he creates is incredibly vivid and unique. He really knows his medieval history and uses it well when explaining castles, horses, armor, weapons, food, etc. The book is a bit of an historical fantasy as well as an epic fantasy since it is really about kings, queens, lords, knights, etc. and their battles for their lands and the political games of intrigue so common to medieval times. There is not alot of magic and sorcery, stange new animals &amp; monsters, different human races in it and that may be a bit of a disappointment to some who are used to seeing this in the genre.<br />But bottom line is once you start to read it, I will bet that you have a hard time putting it down...
B00005JKZT|5.0|I was eagerly expecting for this second installment of the franchise of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\". I liked a lot what I read in the book, it was more intense, and with a lot of action.  <BR>Of course I knew, like in the first movie, this wasn't to be an exact copy of the book, but that was fine to me. If you want to have an exact translation of the book, instead of watching the movie, BUY the book.  There is simply impossible to translate everything into a movie, it just can't be done.  Of course, many will argue about some minor (and major) changes, which purists will loathe about.  For instance, the changes about Faramir.  I know that in the book he was like a noble, untouched-by-the-ring character, but in the movie, a human (brother of Boromir, remember, the one who falled for the ring) who is not tempted by the ring, doesn't fit. Come on, even Frodo now is falling for the ring, so, if you found a human who isn't, why you shouldn't give him then the ring instead? And like this, I could go on. The omission of Shelob, giving more importance to other characters, and so on.  But you have to be reminded that is NOT only for the fans of the books, but also to the major audiences, so, many omissions have to be made.<BR>I, for one,  am pretty pleased with the translation (and I am a big fan of the book!), and can't wait for the next one.
B00005LANG|5.0|&quot;Singin sweet songs, melody's pure &amp; true...&quot; (three little birds) i think this album has the sweetest song &amp; the purest &amp; truest melodies of pretty much any roots reggae album ever.

B000005JA8|5.0|First off, to clarify the editorial review-The Mascara Snake played bass clarinet and did some narration - JOHN FRENCH played drums (and played them like I never knew was possible) Anyway.... <BR>Abstract, very. Disharmonic? mostly. The time signatures and tempo changes don't seem to make sense because most of us have had boring Western music shoved down our throats all our lives.<BR>I understand and respect those who dismiss it as horrid noise-I mean \\"Frownland\\"- what the [heck] is that to open an album? I almost hated it at first but I started to figure out just how orderly the chaos really is. Changed my ideas of musical composition for life... I could go on and on.<BR>Personally, I hold this album dear to my heart...
B000002LFU|5.0|All-around, this is my favorite of their Warner Bros. releases; there are no real clunkers like there are on the others. You Are the Everything (just one in a long line of great R.E.M. ballads) and World Leader Pretend are as good as anything they've ever written. Pop Song 89 and Get Up continue their tradition of great album openers (second only to Reckoning's Harborcoat and 7 Chinese Bros.). Wrong Child and Hairshirt are great for evenings by the fireside (as is You Are the Everything). And Stand really gets a bad rap...it's actually a pretty good pop song.

B00006AVRK|5.0|P.G. Wodehouse wrote funny stories. Obscenely hilarious comedy stories about dim young aristocrats, overbearing aunts and very clever servants.<br /><br />And of all his creations, the most memorable is the ill-fated and blue-blooded Bertie Wooster and his megabrained valet Jeeves, immortalized by Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry. \\"The Complete Jeeves & Wooster\\" brings together all their madcap, bizarre little adventures in England's upper echelongs, with many a disastrous engagement and stint in prison.<br /><br />Bertie Wooster (Laurie) is in need of a valet, and after a wild night out, the low-key, brainy manservant Jeeves (Fry) is sent by an agency to deal with Bertie's everyday needs.<br /><br />But Jeeves doesn't just fold Bertie's hankies and give him hangover tonics -- he keeps Bertie out of all kinds of trouble. Predatory young beauties, ditzy idiot pals of Bertie's, and domineering aunts trying to marry him off, Bertie is always in hot water -- and Jeeves always is on hand, with a plot cooking in his impressive brain, to haul his hapless employer out.<br /><br />\\"The Complete Jeeves and Wooster\\" is quite faithful to Wodehouse's original stories -- some stories are combined and others are separated, but they draw heavily on his kooky, bizarro prose. Lots of overbearing old aunts, exploding safes, Neo-Nazis, a constant merry-go-round of oft-broken engagements, eccentric hobbies (newts!), and young women ranging from horribly hearty to airy-fairy.<br /><br />The only problem is that the stories set in New York just don't have that delicious British flavour that the rest of the series does, although they're still quite funny (Bertie being chased by a berserk cop dressed in a harem outfit). That, and the cast changes continuously.<br /><br />But those small flaws don't keep the series from being hilarious, from start to finish. Every plot is a hopeless tangle of infatuations, mixups, blackmail, little books of mockery, and stolen policemen's helmets -- and yet somehow Jeeves manages to untangle it by the end. And Wodehouse's dialogue is handled in a brilliant manner (\\"Because he is a butterfly, who toys with women's hearts and throws them away like soiled gloves!\\" \\"Do butterflies do that?\\").<br /><br />Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry are perfectly cast as the endearing bumbler Bertie Woosterand the dryly witty Jeeves. Though Bertie's lack of clothing sense (and a trombone) often annoys Jeeves, the brainy valet clearly does have affection for Bertie, and Bertie appreciates Jeeves' ability to save him from fates worse than death (such as marriage to the horribly hearty Honoria or the wispy, fairy-loving dimbulb Madeleine).<br /><br />\\"The Complete Jeeves and Wooster\\" is a simply brilliant stretch of what-ho-what-ho comedy (\\"You can't be a successful dictator AND design women's underclothing\\") and deliciously twisting storylines. Not to be missed.

B0000026J6|5.0|I was introduced to Leonard Cohen nearly a decade ago in my college freshman rhetoric class.  The professor asked us to bring in samples of something that we considered poetry.  Someone brought in Everybody Knows, and I have been a Cohen fan ever since.<br />Cohen's voice fits his dry, black, sense of humor and his grasp of the power of bitter irony like the right pair of sunglasses fit a Mafioso kingpin.  They become one and the same.<br />My favorites on this album have changed over the years, a testament to the longevity of this work.  Everybody Knows is one of the best songs ever written, and Tower of Song is pure brilliance.  Feel free to skip Jazz Police, but have patience with Take This Waltz and I'm Your Man.  You will be rewarded if you give them the chance to grow on you.  They most assuredly will.<br />This album is my favorite of the Cohen releases.  It may not have the classic sound of many of his earlier albums, but his ability to overlay lyrics like<br />\\"Now in Vienna there's ten pretty women<br />There's a shoulder where Death comes to cry<br />There's a lobby with nine hundred windows<br />There's a tree where the doves go to die<br />There's a piece that was torn from the morning<br />And it hangs in the Gallery of Frost\\"<br />with an underlying accompaniment that is at the same time electronic and string driven is genius, pure and simple.  Cohen has the ability of the timeless masters to maintain his style and keep current gracefully.<br />Mr. Cohen says it best.  \\"I was born like this, I had no choice<br />I was born with the gift of a golden voice\\"<br />Do yourself a favor.  Spend an evening in the dark listening to this album over a glass of good wine.  You won't regret it.<br />Five Stars only because they won't give me six.<br />-HawkeyeGK
0316666343|1.0|I had never read Alice Sebold before, but I was very disappointed in this book.  This book was very disturbing.  There are so many horrific things going on in the real world and when you read, most of us would like to escape from all the &quot;reality&quot; of the world.  The author I'm sure is a very good writer, but the ending of this book was rushed.  I would not recommend this book to anyone, as a matter of fact I have told people not to read it.
B000002UA0|5.0|The very first album of Pink Floyd's lengthy career, it's hard to believe that the radically different and far removed sounds of The Piper at the Gates of Dawn were even recorded by the same band, and in many aspects, they weren't.  The only incarnation of the legendary Pink Floyd to be led by the enigmatic Syd Barret, Floyd's original works bear little if any resemblance to the material later produced under the reign of Waters and Gilmour.  While post-Barret era Floyd was closely allied with the 70s progressive movement that strove to enhance and improve rock, Pink Floyd under Barret's direction seemed to be attempting a nearly contradictory feat.  Merging the almost childish pop of early Beatles with the melodic deconstructionist aesthetics of early MC5 proto punk, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn sounds more like a Velvet Underground record than a Pink Floyd one.  However, considering that both bands had a deep affection for and an insatiable fascination with hard drugs, the similarities reflected in their sound shouldn't be that surprising.  In fact, Piper at the Gates of Dawn cannot be fully or accurately discussed without bringing up the drug-addled side of the strange sounding album.  Like Lou Reed, Barret was able to temporarily overcome his severe drug induced disabilities and make the rare transition from being harmed by heavy drugs to being creatively fueled by them.  Acid most notably was an undeniable and integral part of the Piper at the Gates of Dawn patchwork and the enlightenment the drug provided to its members in allowing their music to easily capture the curiosity and brilliant revelation of an acid trip proves that complete condemnation of drugs as a bringer of nothing but evil and destruction is ignorantly short sighted.  In contrast however, living such a dangerous lifestyle eventually caught up to Barret and the very thing that had been the source of his ingenuity became the cause of his demise. A sad and bittersweet tale, Syd Barret was an under recognized innovator who was truly rendered incapable before his time.  Although the later works of Pink Floyd are almost all wonderful in their own rights, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn has a certain carefree charm and sense of humor to it that was never successfully replicated on the increasingly dark subsequent Floyd outings, making it the sole documentation of Pink Floyd's adolescent brilliance.   The complete originality and startling devotion of Barret's acidy masterpiece is as profound today as it was the day it was released and The Piper at the Gates of Dawn still continues to stand as a testament to the diverse legacy that is Pink Floyd.
B00006RIO7|5.0|I have to say that this soundtrack is simply outstanding! I'm not a really big fan of soundtracks at all (let alone one based on a Broadway play). CHICAGO, however, is one exception that I just couldn't miss.<br />While Renee Zellwegger and Richard Gere aren't truly amazing vocalists, Catherine Zeta-Jones is incredible! Her voice is very sexy and powerful! Of the 3 main characters, she is, without a doubt, the most musically blessed. A second career as a singer could be more than possible for her (but I doubt she'll ever travel that road). <br />Queen Latifah (aka Dana Owens) is also a great singer! Mostly known as a hip-hop artist, Queen can definitely sing with the best of them. This is really one of the best surprises on the whole soundtrack.<br />I just love that the entire cd is full of energy from beginning to end. There isn't one part that I would consider boring. Some numbers are a bit slower in tempo than others, but all of the material is really interesting to listen to regardless of the music. All in all, this is one buy I don't regret for a second!<br />(By the way, Anastacia's \\"Love is a Crime\\" also makes this cd a great buy. The Editorial Reviewer says it's 'blah,' but I find it to be quite good. Then again, I'm an Anastacia fan. I don't think anything she sings is boring.)
0312954468|5.0|A most excellent read indeed! This was my first exposure to Wilbur Smith's work, and I was most impressed.<br />The story is narrarated by Taita, a eunuch slave, during the mysterious 14th dynasty of Egypt. He writes about his adventures, accomplishments, thoughts, and feelings throughout. The battle descriptions are exciting and very believable, Wilbur Smith holds back no detail whatsoever, which means that this may not be the best choice for those who have a qweezy stomach. There are some brutally gory parts, which made my face twist more than a few times.<br />Some of the reviewers have criticized the fact that Taita seems like a superhuman because of his accomplishments in so many diverse fields like astronomy, prophecy, architecture, medicine, engineering, etc. Well, let me say this- He was bought at a young age from the nobelest of the nobles in Egypt, therefore he became familiar with all the mannerisms of the educated, and had access to the educational materials of the time. Also he was a eunuch, so he was not distracted as most men are by raging hormones, etc. Add that to his natural intelligence, and remember that back then people probably tended to exagarate their feats more so than now, and you have a rather believable character.<br />Once again, this is an excellent read, packed with history, action/adventure, and romance. Also check out The Egyptian by Mika Waltari, which is the best ever.
0553213105|5.0|My mother has been trying to foist this book off on me for years, but I always resisted.  I thought that the stodgy language, Victorian morality, and melodramatic romance would be tiresome and trite.  I could not have been more wrong.  I instantly fell in love with Elizabeth Bennett, the young heroine of this novel and the \\"prejudice\\" referred to in the book's title.<br />Of course, the \\"pride\\" is the insufferable Mr. Darcy, who looks down upon Elizabeth, her four sisters and her ridiculously self-absorbed mother.  However, what begins as outright animosity between Lizzie and Mr. Darcy blossoms into appreciation and finally true love. (I hope I didn't spoil the book for anyone, but if you didn't see the ending coming, you need to read more!)<br />The language in this novel is terse, elegant and hilarious.  Elizabeth can tell anyone off in such a way as to make the object of her wrath want to shrivel up and fall off the planet, all the while using beautiful language which contains not one bit of profanity.  The characters in this story are also lovable and hilarious even with all their flaws:  the narrow-minded and antagonistic Mrs. and Mr. Bennett, the cunning Mr. Wiccam, and my favorite of all characters--the youngest sister Lydia.<br />The language contained in this novel is not an obstacle to reading it but is instead an absolute delight.  If you have any sense of humor and romance whatsoever you will fall in love with these flawed characters and their absurd predicaments.  Definitely a quick and enchanting read that made me laugh aloud!
0486282147|5.0|Familiar with his stories for years, I finally decided to buckle down and read one of Arthur Conan Doyle's stories of Sherlock Holmes, and \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles,\\" the most famous of the novels, was the one I decided to pick up. To my surprise, I tore through it. It was a simple read, yet a complicated and satisfying mystery.<br />As with all the Holmes stories, his assistant Dr. Watson is charged with telling the tale of the bloody Baskerville curse. Sir Charles Baskerville, who was the charge of the family estate, has recently been gored to death by some sort of animal, and Sir Henry, the new heir to the household and the family fortune, fears that the mythic curse of a hellhound stalking the family grounds is true.<br />A strange twist occurs in this investigation, though, for it's not Holmes who goes to investigate the house. It's Watson, who studies the suspicious neighbors and staff, keeps close watch over Sir Henry and begins to notice that some very odd things are lurking about the moor.<br />Is the curse behind this killing, or is it a villain of flesh and blood?<br />The lead characters are defined well, and, though this is my first Holmes story, I understood the basics and the rhythm almost immediately. The narrative structure that Doyle is famous for is, as expected, charming, and the characters are well-defined. The mystery is properly twisted, and I didn't really guess the middle or the ending.<br />The best twist, to me, wasn't the reveal of any villain or method. It was the twist involving the shadowy figure on the moor. I didn't see it coming at all, and, when I read it, I realized that this old novel still had the narrative tools to surprise me.<br />It's a classic for a reason.

B00005YUNY|5.0|Yeah, its kind of late to be entering a new review, especially since I bought this DVD the day it was released.  But hey, I got inspired.  <br />This DVD isn't perfect, for all the reasons that others have noted (Steve's lack of stage presence, his weak electric guitar tone, less-than-perfect sound mix), but as a visual and aural record of an amazing tour, and as a statement of what Yes has accomplished during its career, this is absolutely perfect.<br />And that's what one wants out of truly artistic music, right?  When the sum somehow magically transcends the individual parts?  Yes has managed to make a career out of true transcendance. Or, &quot;Ascension&quot; rather.<br />Other reviewers have mentioned other highlights (&quot;Starship Trooper&quot;, &quot;Gates of Delirium&quot;, &quot;Close to the Edge&quot;, etc.), but I wanted to point out two others.  The first is &quot;In the Presence Of.&quot;  When I saw the band on this tour in Atlanta, I didn't particularly care for this song at all, except for the fourth section (the &quot;sacred ground&quot; part).  When the album came out, I liked this song even less.  But for some reason I kept listening to it.  Eventually, I got used to it and started liking it quite a bit.  But when I first heard (and saw) the version on this DVD, I was blown away.  This song truly does transcend.  There are parts where the orchestra and Steve's guitar reach this peak where you feel like you're soaring.  This song now never fails to sweep me up when I hear it, whether it be the version here or on the album (MAGNIFICATION).  <br />My other highlight is &quot;Ritual&quot;.  This of course originally came from TALES FROM TOPOGRAPHIC OCEANS, and is sort of the culmination of that album.  It's an astounding piece of music, compositionally speaking.  Originally 21 minutes, their live arrangement has always been closer to 30.  The most inspired and exciting moment of any Yes concert is when the band breaks out into the percussion feature, and the orchestra comes in with that chord that just keeps building and building as the band is wailing away on various drums...and then it all comes to this great crashing climax where everything stops while Steve comes in on guitar with this single note...that constrast between the thunderous excitement and then that almost bittersweet loneliness of Steve's guitar is a crushing moment, and literally brought tears to my eyes on the &quot;Masterworks&quot; tour.  <br />And that's another thing that one wants from truly artistic music: something that has the power to move the listener emotionally, spiritually...to make one's spirit leave the physical world for a little while and soar to another plane...<br />*That's* that reason to buy this DVD.<br />Alan
B0000584V3|5.0|Opeth are geniuses, there can be no doubt about it. Even if you aren't a fan of death metal (and if this would help, I haven't listened to any other death metal band, and Opeth are one of my favorite bands at the moment, just shows how good they are), I think you'll find yourself speechless with wonder at how the band manages to write such complicated riffs and leads, yet manages to bring them across to the listener in a remarkably fluid way. Beautiful created acoustic passages weave in and out of the harsh soundscape created, and brutal roars give way to sweet melodies, all of which happens in seconds, but the greatness of the band truly comes to the fore when these dramatic canges are brought about skillfully, such that they seem like logical steps in the songs. Their 5th album, Blackwater Park (one of the coolest album titles ever in my opinion), skillfully brings together all these traits that Opeth have exemplified throughout theit career, and surprisingly, has an almost pop touch to it. This can be explained by resident genius of Porcupine Tree, Steve Wilson, acting as producer. Thus, anyone new to Opeth would be well-advised to start here.<BR>               Let me remind you again, I am no death metal expert at all, in fact, I had hardly heard any death metal until Opeth. And, now, I think it can be safely said that Opeth can be classified broadly under 'rock', as they incorporate so many different aspects of music culture into their songs. And I've gone into another Opeth-rant again. My original message was \\"I'm no death metal expert, so thus excuse my terminlogy\\", but..yeah.<BR>               Anyways, the record starts with \\"The Leper Affinity\\", which is the prototypical Opeth song, an aggresive, dominating guitar riff intermingled with main songwriter Mikael Akerfeldt's brutal roar. As a little side note here, I must make mention of the quality of Akerfeldt's lyrics. His lyrics read like poetry, rendering images of forests, moors, and all other beautiful stuff you'd only imagine would be present in a romantic's mind. An example of this would be the lyrics in \\"Blackwater Park\\". <BR>                 As \\"The Leper Affinity\\" ends with a piano mournfully playing, the next track, the eastern-tinged \\"Bleak\\" starts up, and this IMHO is one of the best tracks on the album. The above-mentioned Eastern influences are so well-disguised, it's almost sublime. Other standout tracks include the all acoustic semi-ballad \\"Harvest\\", the stunning \\"The Drapery Falls\\", and finally the title track. The latter song has become one of my favorite songs of all time. It starts heavy, then segues into a beautiful semi-acoustic interlude. It sounds heavenly, and the atmospheric lead guitar work by Peter Lindgren truly makes listening to this fine bit of music feel like a long, beautiful trip. After 2 minutes of this, however, the fingerpicking suddenly stops, and the distortion comes crashing in, rudely disturbing the apparent calm of the interlude, and riff upon multi-tracked riff pours out of the speakers. Mikael Akerfeldt lets out a chilling growl, and it's truly a \\"I've-got-goosebumps\\" moment.<BR>                  OK, I know this review sounded like some hopeless Opeth mark, but this band is great. And let me tell you something else, if Mikael Akerfeldt and Co. ever decide to go mainstream, they'd be bigger than the Beatles. They're that good.
B00005NC66|5.0|one of the best films ever made, breathless will take your breath away. no need to say any more. but to all you people who pretend to know about godard and then complain that the dvd is in full screen, how about reading more about how godard shot his films? breathless was shot in 1:33:1 which means it was shot in full screen. so there is nothing wrong with the aspect ration of the dvd. it is the correct original aspect ratio. stop complaining for no reason. and watch the film if u havent. its gold.
0399226907|5.0|The pages are colorful enough to catch the eye of a 6-week old child, and the story is a classic.  This is a must-have for any children's collection.
B00001QEE2|5.0|I know there are a lot of critics out there that don't enjoy how Disney has not stayed true to the original story of Hercules.  However, how many other movies are not completely true to the originals or even to the &quot;real life&quot; events that actually occurred.  (Even the fan-adored-Leo-loving Titanic wasn't true to all the facts and/or people represented on the screen)<br />Take a second and just sit back and enjoy this animated masterpiece.  The wit of Disney story-telling shines through with a perfect fit of rousing musical numbers.  All of this, and still you get characters full of charisma and heart (not all, but most).  <br />I'm sure that you will find something that you will find appealling, whether it be a new insight on something in your own life, or even one as simple as experiencing a creative and touching Disney film for a few hours.<br />Absolute seal of approval from this Disney fan!
0385335482|3.0|I really enjoyed this book and I finished it on a long plane ride.  I recommend it to anyone who loves to shop and loves a little romance!  You don't have to be single to enjoy this!!
0767805712|5.0|A beautiful and poignant film, even more relevant now than when released. This should be required viewing for US citizens lest they think that civil liberties are expendable. <BR>When our inept politicians claim to know who arethe superior persons, and with the scientific advances in genetic research, this may not be science fiction after all.
B000065VB9|5.0|If you like Peter Gabriel then you're going to love this CD.<BR>I can't say much more than what's already been said about this awesome CD from the rest of the reviews.
B0000019PA|1.0|Without wasting too much breath... this album has nothing original or inspiring to offer.. Remember in that movie 'Deliverance' when the hillbilly says &quot;squeal like a pig&quot;?? I think the vocals of Neutral Milk Hotel (whatever that is supposed to mean/aside from random word association) SQUEAL. Seriously.
B00000HZFH|4.0|Every once in a while you come across an album that forces you to sit down and listen.  The music won't let you do anything else, whether it be wrapping tape around a baseball bat or eating a scone.  An album like this grabs hold of your nerves somehow (I propose that this process involves The Spirit--it locks itself onto theoretical &quot;Spirit Junctures&quot; and then proceeds to send Spirit Waves through the arteries of the brain and heart--the overall process leading to an instantaneous atrophy of all muscles [excluding the eyes and ears, of course] and an actute awareness light and audio-influenced vibrations) and takes your body where it wants it to go and makes it feel the way it wants it to feel.  You can tell great music by the way it influences you, how much clout it holds with your emotions.  Keep it Like a Secret by Built to Spill is almost at the level.  It has got its long fingers wrapped around greatness but it is still pulling itself up.  Still, this album makes me want to become some kind of robot.  If I were a robot, I would not have to worry about music making me act so strangely or feel so insane.  I love the meandering guitar.  I love how I feel like I am betraying someone or something if I push pause halfway through &quot;Carry the Zero.&quot;  I would have given this album five stars, but I have to reserve that ranking for albums by Modest Mouse.  Aloha!
0060934700|4.0|While not every story in this collection is perfect hit, \\"The Goldfish Pond\\" and \\"Murder Mystery\\" make up for any flaws. A great book.
0316666343|2.0|This book is just okay.  I finished it in two sittings just so I could be free to move on to something more stimulating.  If you enjoy tears, sappiness, and emotion-fests in general, by all means read this book.  This book is definitely in the teen-girl fiction school of pop psychology.  If you want two dimensional characters and supernatural smarm, look no further.  There are some redeeming qualities: Harvey is a creepy and well-drawn force.  Also, Sebold's idea that there is not a strict separation between the living and the dead is pretty profound and worth more consideration.
B000053VAF|1.0|(Note: I'm not Catholic, but I'm very familiar with the religion)<br />\\"It's a great satire as well as a philosophical/theological statement (the thinking man's movie).\\" \\"As a lapsed Catholic, I appreciate the film's serious discussion of religious issues.\\" <br />Thinking man's movie?! Don't make me laugh. No, wait, please do, cause this movie sure didn't.<br />If anything lambasted in this movie is remotely close to what Catholics think their religion is about, no wonder they're lapsed. But it isn't - and that's where all pretension to satire or farce disappears.<br />See, to satirize something, you must understand it's foibles, present them, and then poke fun at its problems. Otherwise you're trashing something that doesn't even exist except in the minds of your clueless audience, which, sadly, apparently is a gamble that paid off, judging from the praise here - perhaps a self-satire about public education?<br />Is Catholicism really presented in this movie at all? Perhaps in a couple of instances - the contradiction between the Pope's ex cathedra special offer and what we expect divine justice to deny may be one. But the rest bears scant relation to the religion the movie supposedly spoofs. Monty Python would be a better bet by far. Perhaps this is the director's private joke - which is that the people who think they're enjoying watching Catholicism skewered come off looking like fools themselves. And pretentious ones, at that (\\"Thinking man's movie\\").<br />Now let's get this straight. I was looking forward to an irreverent, gut-aching, knee-slapping, if somewhat misguided, Pythonesque ride, despite my respect for the religion. But the laughs are unbelievably lame, the pacing is tedious. The main character looks like she can't wait to finish this movie and get out of Dodge - either that or she can't act to save her life. You don't care a whit what happens to her. She is dead as a doornail throughout. Even Chris Rock as a black apostle cannot bring out the comedyin this movie - isn't he supposed to be some kind of comedian? He is as useless in this movie as Orlando Jones in \\"Evolution\\"?<br />Matt Damon has his moments, an impressive scene where he spouts some puerile pseudo-Catholic conundrums, but that's about it. That guy from Die Hard has some funny British-type moments as well.<br />Some find this movie insulting, but I'm not sure who it insults, except, of course, its theologically clueless viewers.<br />Brilliant? Farce? ...
B00003CXXM|5.0|I saw \\"Bourne\\" within weeks of seeing \\"Minority Report\\".  How can the two compare?<br />Maybe I've seen too many movies, but I saw the ending of \\"Minority\\" coming 30 minutes into the film.  When it unfolded exactly like I thought... kind of a let-down.<br />While \\"Bourne\\" didn't have any huge twists, I didn't care.  I wanted to see how this man with no history would survive his past and move on -- assuming he survived.  Plus, this is a movie you can talk about without having to compliment the special effects -- which, unfortunately, are half the comments I hear about \\"Minority\\".<br />While I think both \\"Bourne\\" and \\"Minority\\" are fun movies, I'd pick \\"Bourne\\" over \\"Minority\\" every time.
B00005YXZH|5.0|The above statement is NOT an exaggeration. I sincerely DO love everything about this album; the lyrics, the music, the packaging, everything. This is one of those rare albums like Agaetis Byrjun by Sigur Ros and Radiohead's OK Computer where you end up listening to the whole thing when you put it in your CD player even if you only intend to listen to one song. The funny thing is, I hated this when I first downloaded it. I honestly thought that the friend who recommended Wilco to me, calling them &quot;the best band in America,&quot; was out of his mind. It took a few months to get used to YHF, but it was well worth it! I listen to this more frequently than any other album right now, with the exception of the ones listed above. Buy this today; you may be disappointed at first, but it DOES get better with time. If you already have this, get Summer Teeth; it's almost as good as this album.
B000000W5L|5.0|Let me make it clear that this album does not contain any huge hits, but that is the best part because a few hit songs do not make a great album. This album is a 200 proof whiskey soaked, sleazy, gut wrenching rock n roll record the way it was supposed to be made. Every song on this album represents what the stones are about: hard rock, boogie, country, blues, and gospel wrapped up into a jamfest of an album. This album sounds the way rock n roll was meant to sound- dirty, nasty, and hard- and that is the reason why underproducing this album is a key ingredient to its succes. Oh yeah, listen through the album a few times before giving up on it, it gets better each time.<BR>An undeniable rock classic.
B000002KEV|5.0|Sicuramente il pi bell'album del Mark II dei Deep Purple e probabilmente il loro miglior album di sempre.<BR>Si inizia con \\"Highway Star\\" che dal 1972 diventa il loro opening act, un pezzo incredibilmente coinvolgente. Dopo solo sette minuti di ascolto avrete gi sentito uno dei pi begli assoli di Ritchie Blackmore (ispirato ad una progressione di Bach). Poi \\"Child In Time\\", dall'album In Rock, un gran pezzo, in cui le stupende parti di chitarra e di organo vengono superate in bellezza solo dalla performance di Ian Gillan (strepitosa!!!). Inutile dire che questa versione di \\"Smoke On The Water\\"  la migliore in assoluto, cantata in maniera ottimale, suonata ancora meglio, con Lord e Blackmore che danno ampio sfoggio della loro bravura ed eseguono il famosissimo pezzo conclusivo \\"botta e risposta\\" organo e chitarra.<BR>\\"The Mule\\", e anche Ian Paice ha il suo momento di gloria (come se non sapessimo che  il miglior batterista rock).<BR>In \\"Strange Kind Of Woman\\" la bravura e la capacit dei Deep Purple di suonare veramente \\"insieme\\" viene di nuovo rimarcata da un \\"botta e risposta\\" incredibile tra la voce di Gillan e la chitarra di Blackmore. Si conclude con \\"Lazy\\" e \\"Space Truckin'\\" due pezzi gi fantastici nell'album studio ma che in questo epico live sono veramente speciali.<BR>Rispetto alle rispettive registrazioni studio, le canzoni di \\"Made In Japan\\" riescono davvero a comunicare ai fans dei Deep Purple la carica di energia che negli anni Settanta questo quintetto di musicisti riusciva ad esprimere sul palco.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Everytime I listen to this CD, I reminded of Southern summer days by the beach with a glass of ice cold tea while I watch the waves just roll on in.<br />Every song moves you in some way and for a CD to do that is a treasure.
B00005OAIE|4.0|As with many I see I was deeply upset by one customer review, I mean a comparrisen to The New Kids on the Block is down right disturbing.  John Mayer has a wonderful voice, and his lyrics are truly enjoyable.  He is a very gifted guitarist.  I am surprised I have not burned a hole in this Cd.  He is a unique artist that deserves praise.  He is so different then many of the songs on the radio today.  I am not a fan of the Backstreet boys and to even compare him to them makes me a little upset.  I am so much more respect for him than many of the &quot;Pop&quot; singers today.
B000008LUN|4.0|Michael Schenker is the star of this album and he sticks out like a man amongs boys.  He plays heavy rock with tons of melody, feeling and technique.  (By the way, if you like Randy Rhoads' or Tommy Bolin's work, you will definitely want to add &quot;Phenomenon&quot; to your collection.)<br />As far as the rest of the material, the lyrics are adequate but nothing special, the vocals are par for the course, all the songs are in four, and there are no truly original musical ideas.  But still, you just gotta love Schenker's phrasing and tone (yes, I'm a guitarist), and for that reason, guitar enthusiasts will want to hear how the good guys used to get it done.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|This is, without any doubt, the best Van Halen cd.<BR>When you listen to this record, you'll find out that all guitar players from 1979 to present day have copied his style, his innovation and have tried to imitate his &quot;brown sound&quot;.<BR>I hope that the band will soon be in tour with David Lee Roth.
B00003CXAA|5.0|In my opinion, one of the most intellegent and thought provoking movies ever made.
B000005RT8|3.0|First a word or three about Paul McCartney...(Review on the last paragraph.) <br />When left to his own devices in musical direction for albums, Paul McCartney has almost always shown his shortcomings.  No one can dispute the man's contributions to popular music.  No doubt, he is a musical genius.  The problem lies in the fact that in the thirty-plus years since leaving The Beatles, he has rarely been able to sustain this genius through the demands of a full album.<br />Can anyone truly say that, other than Band On The Run, there weren't several tracks on any other McCartney album that made the listener a little embarrassed and/or disappointed to hear?  The listener is left disappointed because of knowing McCartney capabilities.  His musical contributions while with The Beatles showed McCartney to be a artist blessed with a rare gift for musical logic that seamlessly and beautifully tranferred from his mind to the recordings that generations have enjoyed and loved.   <br />Why aren't most solo McCartney and Wings recordings as musically developed as with his recordings with The Beatles?  A big reason is that McCartney lost his artistic competitiveness with John Lennon and George Harrison when he left The Beatles.  The  hunger to excel after McCartney's tenure with The Beatles seemed to disappear and the artistic inspiration since that time has never been as strong.  <br />If the past thirty years are any indication, McCartney will continue to rest on his laurels, release the occasional brilliant single alongside other tracks of mediocrity as an album, have fans of the past buy that album, listen to that album and leave that listener feeling totally cheated both spiritually and financially.     <br />O.K. Nuff said.  Here's the run-down on McCartney II.<br />Better, but almost similar to most of his other albums where:  1/3 works; 1/3 promises but doesn't deliver and 1/3 should have been left in the Outtake bin.   <br />Best Songs: Coming Up(PURE GENIUS FOR ITS MUSICAL LOGIC.); On The Way(Slow, steady blues number without the contrived vocal affectations.); Nobody Knows(It's just silly, unfaked fun--makes you want to listen to it again!); Waterfalls(A rare synth ballad that actually blends with McCartney's voice to envoke believable emotion.); One of These Days(Simple, heartfelt and to the point--IT'S ALL WE EVER WANT IT TO BE!!!) <BR> <BR>Three stars because you can tell he tried harder with this one than most of the others.
B00005YJMX|5.0|...the most effective and powerful film based on the Dracula legend. Herzog fills the screen and ultimately, the viewer's senses with a dreamy landscape that though not terrifying, is almost unbearably creepy and penetrating. Klaus Kinski gives an understated and moving performance as the lamentable Nosferatu, a creature seemingly at serious odds with his vampiric nature yet unable to change it, forever trapped in his isolation and doom. What can be said about the flawless Isabelle Adjani, except that she is absolute perfection as Lucy.  Fragile and almost unbearably beautiful, she is to all appearances frail yet determined to bring an end to Dracula's pestilence. The surrealistic scenes are very memorable with Popol Vuh's score adding immeasurably to the atmosphere of corrosion and misery. Nosferatu, Phantom of the Night is not unlike a wicked dream, irresistible and hypnotic, it distracts the viewer with incredible images while it burrows deep into the mind and the bone. My one and only complain concerns Renfield's incessant and incredibly annoying cackling. Fortunately, he is not on screen too often so my quibble is very minor, indeed. Forget Coppola' beautiful, yet everything-but-the-kitchen-sink version or even Tod Browning's original masterpiece with Lugosi as the unforgettable bloodsucker. Herzog's approach is far more subtle and intelligent than anything done before or since. The pacing is dead on, the performance's are uniformly excellent, the cinematography beautiful, though bleak and the direction beyond reproach.
B00006RIO7|5.0|With all the songs, and more, from the movie, this cd is as exciting and entertaining as the movie it is from.  All the performaces are great.  If you like the movie, then buy the soundtrack.
B000070IXT|5.0|Ok I saw this movie twice in theatres and it made me (as well as everyone else in the building) jump many times.  It was fast paced and a great representation of the Resident Evil series (even though it is only loosely based on the games, taking certain things from here and there to give a treat to the die hard fans).  Anyway, as soon as it hit DVD I bought it.  Supurb movie.  No real flaws.  Paul WS Anderson (director) was phenomenal.  I can't wait until the RE: Nemesis comes out later this year.<br />To all you who hated it.  I don't know where you're coming from... \\"plastic dogs\\" riiight... get your eyes checked.  I mean I know everyone is entitled to their own opinion but I honestly don't see what you are seeing.  And as a director myself, I can see what is really going on, but I can enjoy the film on any level.<br />Fastastic movie, great special features (with a funny commentary.  BUY IT TODAY!!!! ;-)
B00006RCNW|5.0|I've been a hardcore fan of The Shield since it first aired.  It is quite simply the best thing I've ever seen on TV.  The writing is highly original, and doesn't lapse into TV-land cliches, but the acting is what stands out here.  For all the nudity and violence, The Shield packs more honest-to-God humanity into one episode than most shows can manage during an entire run.  These actors are not afraid to play the worst sides of their characters -- petty, ugly, stupid, weak, racist, sexist, ambitious, whiny, selfish, vicious, self-righteous, manipulative, dishonest -- and that makes their best moments shine all the brighter.  Benito Martinez, Walton Goggins, Jay Karnes, and Michael Jace are especially brilliant in this regard.<br />Too bad the same can't be said for Shield creator/exec. producer, Shawn Ryan.  The episode commentaries reveal him to be a man obsessed with avoiding self-congratulation, and true to the Middle Eastern myth, what he fears most ends up killing him and every commentary track he's on.  With numbing regularity, Ryan interrupts his colleagues' fascinating stories, comments, feelings, and insights to offer meager insights of his own.  The result is never an improvement; Ryan bulldozes over many potentially honest (painfully so?) moments, especially from his actors.  He needs to learn that the space between others' words is not just occasion for him to figure out what he's going to say next.  For a writer (who is also, theoretically, a trained observer), this is a dangerous tendency.  I hope it doesn't mar the writing of future shows or the commentary tracks on future DVDs.  I can only wish that Fox would release a bonus disc with all the stories Ryan verbally erased just  so he could hear himself talk.
0815411839|5.0|Marilyn deserves respect and to rest in peace and this book frees her from the lies that have been said about her so often.  The author provides letters, and answers to the most toughest questions, and never fails to back anything up.  It is THE book for Marilyn's life and nothing can convince me otherwise.  The last day of her life was a sad one filled with controlling people who were emotionally disturbed.  I would definetely read it and see what you think.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|This was the first DVD I bought and it is definitely the best.  The film looks brand new.  The color and sound are brilliant.  There are also alot of interesting and fun extras on this dvd.  I would recommend this DVD for anyone who loves the movie, Disney, or DVDs in general.  You won't be disappointed.
B000001GQJ|5.0|This is an amazing CD - a must have for lovers of classical pianists. I find myself replaying it over and over again, drawn to it because it so far surpasses any other listening experience in my collection.
B00005JKL8|3.0|A very good action flick, nothing to do beside great war movies but the missile pursuit sequence and the dts soundtrack are enough to put in in my collection.
B00006CYAD|5.0|I think that this CD is amazing.  It's depressing lyrics (nobody cares 'cause I'm alone and the world is having more fun than me) are paired with catchy melodies and harmonies.  Some songs are fun and others send out a profound message (Perfect).  If I had more money, I would get this CD again.
B00001U0DP|5.0|An Italian movie?  Worth watching?  If you are put off by the fact that this movie was produced in Italian, you'll miss the pleasure of seeing one of the most \\"moving\\" movies ever made.  And fortunately for us English-speaking folks, a version has been produced with English voices fluently dubbed over the original Italian.  You'll find that the power of this movie goes beyond languages and cultures.<br />The setting is Italy, prior the Second World War; the protagonist Guido is a bumbling yet charming waiter.  With his Charlie Chaplin style charm, Guido attempts to seduce the pretty schoolteacher Dora, only to find she is already engaged.  In a comic sequences of events, he courts and wins his bride.  But this first half of the movie about romance is mere background, setting the emotional stage for the rest of the movie and the horror that follows.  After their marriage and an interlude of five years, it becomes evident that Guido is a Jew.  Along with his wife and son Giosue (Joshua), he is deported to a concentration camp.<br />The structure reminds me of \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\", which in a similar manner is composed of two halves, the first half developing sympathy for a character and his family, and the second half placing this character in the cauldron of fiery trials and tragedy.  There are also similarities with the movie \\"Titanic\\" - a man falls in love with an engaged woman based on physical attraction, and after the conquest of their love they are together they are thrown into a horrific trial with a tragic conclusion.  But \\"Life is Beautiful\\" has a story far more \\"titanic\\" in its power and passion, and unlike the Hollywood blockbuster, it is genuine love based on self sacrfice rather than immoral passions.  Whatever suggestion there is of immorality (such as Guido's declaration that he desires to make love to her on the street) is presented absurdly and for humor, and is hardly intended to be taken seriously, unlike the steamy car scene in Titanic.  The very vague suggestion that they sleep together before marriage quickly fades behind the image of marital faithfulness, the wife's selfless devotion to her husband and family, and the self-sacrificing love of a husband and father.<br />While the first half is very comic, the second half is very serious. Guido is desperate to protect young Joshua from the horror inflicted by the Germans, and so he pretends that the concentration camp is part of an elaborate game, with the first prize being a real tank.  He tries to keep up his son's spirits by ingeniously inventing this game, saying \\"Isn't this fun?\\" \\"I've never had so much fun!\\"  \\"It sure is fun!\\" These repeated statements ring hollow in the middle of a concentration camp, and the illusion is hard to maintain when the boy says \\"I just don't get this game\\" and wants it to be over.  His father's reply \\"This game is serious\\" has more significance than he realizes.<br />The first part of the movie features many memorable scenes of comedy: the belly-button classroom speech; the couple in deep conversation on the steps, he holding a steering wheel and she holding a pillow over her behind; a passionate kiss that occurs underneath the table; the green horse Prince Charming uses to rescue his princess; Guido's \\"interpreting\\" of the German guard's instruction.  But as comedy turns into tragedy, there are also memorable scenes of tragedy: the old Jew offering to help up the German who trips in the gas chambers; the irony of the German doctor who can help Guido but is obsessed with his riddles: \\"You have to help me!\\"; and the boy's final vision of his father goose-stepping between the guards.<br />The concluding hope (\\"We won! We won!\\") is touched by tragedy.  By not being afraid to include sorrow, this tragic note makes the movie all the more emotional and successful.  I can think of few movies that have affected me as emotionally as this one.  Injecting a movie about the holocaust with comedy was taking a major risk, but ultimately made the movie all the more successful.  The height of comedy in the first half makes the depth of tragedy in the second half all the deeper.<br />The PG-13 rating is primarily because of one instance of blasphemy, and a few war scenes.  Any adult themes that are present, however are not seen, but implied off-screen, including the actual horrors of the concentration camp.  Rather than dwell on the physical horrors of war through sensationalism, this movie focuses instead on the emotional impact.  It is especially the actor Roberto Benigni that makes this succeed.  As well as being the main actor, Roberto Benigni was also the writer and director of the movie.  In the half-hour featurette that is on the DVD, he acknowledges that the biggest influence on his acting was Charlie Chaplin.  Not does his slap-stick humour provide wonderful comic relief, but also emotion.  It's a brilliant performance that deservedly won him the Academy Award for Best Actor.<br />But this film also took out the Academy Awards for best soundtrack - the classical music is a wonderful emotional counterpart to the storyline - and for the best foreign language film.  Over time, it has won a record of over 70 international awards.  After you watch it, you'll understand why.  It's a captivating picture of comedy and of survival and hope in the midst of horrific tragedy.  I can't think of a single movie that has \\"moved\\" me as this one has.  It may be Italian, but this is a movie not to be missed by people from anywhere around the world.ely made the movie all the more successful.

0312305060|4.0|I'm not terribly surprised at the wide mix of customer reviews for this book.  On the one hand, I loved the writing.  Cunningham's style is simply beautiful.  As mentioned in other reviews, his transitions are seamless.  The parallels and common themes running between the three womens' lives are fascinating.  I can't imagine how they were able to make this book into a movie, because I think it's Cunningham's writing style that makes the book worth reading more than the plot itself.<br />On the other hand, I found myself waiting for something to happen as I read the book - more action, I guess, than it provides. That's not to say that nothing happens in this book.  Several significant events transpire.  Perhaps it's the pace of the narration.  It really doesn't change much from chapter to chapter, woman to woman, so much of it feels the &quot;same.&quot;  <br />When I finished the book, I also had the feeling that I had missed something important the author was trying to say.  I found myself wishing I'd read &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; in the hopes that it would provide further illumination of the author's intent.<br />Overall, though, I did enjoy this novel, and was glad I read it.  If you're looking for remarkable writing, this book is for you.  If you're looking for an exciting plot, you might want to give this one a pass.
B00006RIO7|5.0|I saw the movie when it first opened, then had to wait for the soundtrack.  It was worth it.  The soundtrack sizzles, especially Catherine Zeta-Jones and Queen Latifah.  Surprisingly, Rene Zellweger and Richard Gere have great voices.  Loved it!

0060278269|5.0|Of course this book is, for lack of a better word, amazing. The final book of the (some call it a trilogy but I beg to differ)series by Garth Nix chronically the valiant deeds of Abhorsens against the dead in the Old Kingdom. A wonderful finish to a blazingly creative three book series. Sabriel is still my favourite but both Lirael and now Abhorsen rank high on my scale. Obviously not meant to be read before the afore mentioned titles, Abhorsen was definitely worth the wait.
B00003CXI1|5.0|This is a great movie, it has the excapeism that everyone loves and the adventure we often lack in our own lives. It is wonderful to sit down and excape into this movie. You soon feel you know the characters personally, if you have read any of the books then you are waiting on pins and needles for the new one to be released.The same goes for the next movie, it seems 1 yr. is almost to much, but when it is released and you have seen it at least 4 dozen times it is all worth the wait. I know I am counting the days and re-reading the books I have.
0671027379|5.0|I am hooked on Dan Brown. This book was great from page one until the final page. I never read anything of Browns but I will from now on and will hope he continues. The characters are absolutely believable. His imagination, although the gadgits are probably real, has inspired me to read more political thrillers. He is up there with Clancy and the rest.  I not only enjoyed the book but learned about the ice caps as well. And by the way isn't that what is suppose to happen, learning? Well Brown is a good teacher and this student is ready to move on. Let's go!!!

B0000636UN|5.0|Sheryl has done it yet again! An incredible CD, with some songs that are great to rock with, and some that make me so emotional I want to cry. Her &quot;C'mon C'mon&quot; tour is amazing as well. Every time I hear &quot;Safe and Sound&quot; I simply stop whatever it is I'm doing and just listen. Her music is as moving as ever.
B00003CXE6|5.0|I happen to be an ancient historian and I find that I can best enjoy movies and films set in the ancient world if I don't expect them to be realistic.  There are many problems with this film in terms of the reality of the Roman world during the second century CE -- listing them would use up the entire word limit for reviews on Amazon.com.  However, the film itself moves rapidly, the scenery and costuming is eleborate, and the characters are interesting and well-acted.  Its good to see both veteran actors and younger ones interacting so well.  My only real complaint is that some of the filming made me a bit dizzy but then combat is a fast-paced and terrifying experience and the quick, spiraling movements did a good job of making me feel overwhelmed at times.  We're using it in the Roman History class this semester and it should generate a lot of good discussion.
B00005JKZT|5.0|The Two Towers which is the second installment of Tolkein's 3-part book has captured the audience's attention. The movie is the best of all time. Better than The Fellowship of the Ring. The Two Towers picks up where The Fellowship left off. Sam and Frodo are traveling through the Emyn Muil on their way to Mordor to destroy the One Ring of Power. The last of the Fellowship (Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli) are chasing after the mighty Uruk-Hai who have taken Merry and Pippin.<br />Jackson does an excellent job of picking up right where Fellowship left off. He doesn't give a re-cap which is great. The beginning of the movie has a surprise to those who have not read the books. I won't ruin the movie for those many people.<br />The movie starts with Sam and Frodo who are traveling through the Emyn Muil to Mordor. They meet up with the creature Gollum whom, as we have heard in Fellowship is possessed by the ring. Frodo and Sam capture Gollum and make him swear by the ring, his precious, that he will lead them to the Black Gate of Mordor (Minas Morgul).<br />Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are on the trail of the Sauruman's Uruk-Hai who have captured Merry and Pippin. Aragorn's efforts will lead the three to the a camp set up by their quarry. Apparently there was a struggle and it seems that Merry and Pippin are dead. But wait! Aragorn discovers tracks that lead into the Fangorn forest.<br />Merry and Pippin have escaped from the Uruk-Hai, but are pursued into the Fangorn forest by an Orc who is desperate to have them for dinner. Merry and Pippin encounter the Ent, Treebeard, who then leads them to a safe spot.<br />Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli follow the tracks and come across Treebeard who then leads them to the White Man who is surprise!<BR>Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli ride to Rohan to seek council with King Theoden whose mind is being poisened by Sauruman's filthy henchmen Grima Wormtounge. <br />Sam and Frodo are stuck in the Dead Marshes. Frodo questionsGollum about how he came across the ring and also convicts Gollum of once being a Hobbit. Gollum then fights with his other self(his good self) Smeagol. Smeagol in the end wins. They arrive at the Black Gate but it's nearly impossible to get past. Smeagol suggests a new route. Frodo agrees but Sam has his doubts.<br />King Theoden receives word of the advancing forces of Sauruman's Uruk-Hai and has ordered that everyone evacuate and move to Helm's Deep. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli travel with him. On the way, Theoden's small force is attacked by a group of Orcish scouts. Aragorn falls off a cliff and is presumed dead.<br />Sam and Frodo have been captured by Faramir and his band. They are taken to Osgilith. Faramir is taken by the ring as did his brother Boromir.<br />King Theoden arrives at Helm's Deep and awaits the oncoming horde of the Uruk-Hai. The battle of Helm's Deep is the most astonishing feat the CG has to offer. The battle is intense and is depicted very well and it even invites some humor from our little hero Gimli.<br />Merry and Pippin try to convince Treebeard to go to war with Isengard. Only when Treebeard surveys the land surrounding Isengard (trees have been destroyed and leveled as far as the eye can see) does he decide to go to war.<br />Back at Helm's Deep, the victory is hopeless for Rohan as the Orcs pummel the Keep. Just when all hope is lost, surprise!<br />Sam and Frodo are taken to Minas Tirith which is being attacked by the Nazgul and the forces of Mordor. Faramir lets Sam, Frodo and Smeagol go. Smeagol again has another fight with his evil twin, Gollum. Gollum wins and decides to kill Frodo and Sam by taking them to HER. The End<br />The Two Towers is a really great film and I recommend anyone and everyone to see it before it's too late. Even those who are not Lord of the Rings fans will appreciate this movie for what it is. The cinematography is great and the storyline is true to the book and the CG are awesome and breathtaking. Jackson has done an awesome job. I'm counting the days till The Two Towers comes out on DVD probably around August same as Fellowship and I'm also counting the days till The Return of the King comes into theaters this December.<BR>Bottom Line: The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers: an instant favorite
B00006RIO7|5.0|Of course you have to like musicals to even consider buying this CD, and it helps if you've seen the movie.  Richard Gere will blow you away with his smooth vocals.  I personally thought that Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zellweger should have switched roles in the movie, but they both gave outstanding performances.  Catherine Zeta-Jones sounds great in &quot;All That Jazz.&quot;  And Queen Latifah is sure to surprise you in &quot;When You're Good to Mama.&quot;  This is a must for anyone's collection!
B00006X06U|4.0|I grew up with Joni.  As a teen, I painted and dreamed to &quot;Ladies of the Canyon&quot; and &quot;Blue.&quot;  Then her music began to take me places I could not have imagined.  I replayed &quot;Hissing of Summer Lawns&quot; at least a dozen times before I felt I had a sense of what Joni was doing.  The careful listening was worth it and taught me a lesson about art.  Art must be pursued.  That challenge to the audience is part of the reason art is so valuable.  It is what makes art distinct from entertainment, though the two may overlap.<br />This recording is challenging.  Lots of orchestration, dramatic changes of tempo, and the intrigue of the images that accompany the CD make the songs new.  In many cases, the restatements add layers of new meaning to the tunes.  I am still replaying it to follow her.  Today, &quot;You Dream Flat Tires&quot; has come to mean more to me than the same song recorded on &quot;Wild Things Run Fast&quot; of 1982.<br />I have to give it four stars now, but I will probably change my opinion to five stars in a month.

B00005JL95|1.0|We received this video as a gift and I expected it to be wholesome animated entertainment for my young children (ages 5 and 2). My 5-year old was terrified from the get-go and by mid-film we had to turn it off. Not only is the film incredibly violent, but what is a 5-year old to think of social workers taking small children from their homes or aliens capturing said children and flying off with them. <br />While it might be more appropriate for older children,  it remains gratuitiously violent with many bad values thrown in with a few good ones. We won't be watching it again!
B000003S0F|5.0|Primero: este album no es una copia de &quot;In the Court...&quot;, afortunadamente, como si que lo fue &quot;In the Wake of Poseidon&quot;<BR>Segundo: Aun no habian encontrado el sonido &quot;heavy&quot; tan característico que a partir del siguiente album &quot;Lark's Tongues in Aspic&quot; marcaria el sonido de la banda.<BR>Estamos pues en un momento de búsqueda, en el momento de Lizard y de Islands. Los dos álbumes más difíciles de la banda, donde se mezclan rock, jazz, clásica, vanguardia, en una búsqueda y experimentación constantes. Ya no tenemos la voz y el sonido característico de Greg Lake (que hace que los dos primeros álbumes suenen tanto a EL&amp;P) y la mayoria de los originarios miembros del grupo habian abandonado a Robert Fripp.<br />Así que escuchemos este disco como algo diferente y si lo conseguimos, si no buscamos tonterias en plan &quot;cat food&quot; ni sonido EL&amp;P como &quot;Epitaph&quot;, hallaremos uno de los mejores discos de King Crimson, sin duda, la primera obra maestra desde el primer disco con la ventaja de no tener que soportar los minutos experimentales superaburridos de Moonchild (excelente en version reducida!)<br />&quot;Formentera Lady&quot; choca con el conservadurismo que muestran muchos seguidores de KC, pero es un tema increible, es alucinante que haya sido excluido de todas las recopilaciones.<BR>&quot;Ladies of the Road&quot; tiene toda la vitalidad y la fuerza que le faltaba a &quot;Cat food&quot;.<BR>&quot;Sailor's Tale&quot; es sonido Robert Fripp, contundente, guitarrero y hermoso.<br />&quot;Prelude...&quot; es un intento de hacercarse a la música clásica, como si de un cuarteto de Haydn se tratara.<BR>&quot;Islands&quot; y &quot;The Letters&quot; son dos temas emocionantes, intensos.<br />Resumiendo, Islands es un disco imprescindible, sin ni un solo momento de relleno, un disco redondo... despues vendrá la triologia formada por &quot;Lark's-Starless-Red&quot;, donde hayarán por fin su sonido, peroeste Islands es infinitamente superior a un &quot;the Wake of Poseidon&quot; y a muchos les gustará más que &quot;In the Court&quot;.

B00006RIO7|5.0|I've already listened to this album 4 times and i just bought it. It's on right now as I'm typing this! Everyone on the CD, Zellweger, Zeta-Jones, Gere, Latifah, soung amazing. The recording is superb and if you've seen the film, you need to have it. The only thing I'm not crazy about are the hip-hop version of \\"Cell Block Tango\\" and the Anastacia song @ the end of the CD but it's not enough to ruin the rest of it. It's just a lot of fun and, I have to say, a really sweet way to start the new year.

0312265859|5.0|I have read every one of the Stephanie Plum books. I totally enjoy the humorous situations and the wonderful characters woven into the mysteries surrounding Stephanie as she goes about the task of \\"hunting for bounty\\". But this one for me, was so funny, I hated to finish it. I make it a point to read several chapters every night before bed,but I found myself cutting back each night because I didn't want the laughs to end in this latest escapade. Janet Evanovich has the \\"knack\\" of creating a hilarious visual scene like no author I have ever read. What a pleasure to be able to enjoy a mystery with some fun & fantasy tossed in! I think this is her \\"best\\" yet, and I hope that there are many more numbers to come!
B00006RIO7|5.0|Many fans of the hit Broadway show \\"Chicago\\" still consider the 1996 Revival CD the true, definitive recording of the score and undoubtedly so, with a Grammy Award under its belt. So when news came that a movie would be made of this fine musical, the reaction was split in the middle greeted with both skepticism and enthusiasm. Many purists feared that Hollywood would just butcher a pitch-perfect score . . .<br />. . . well, purists, rest assured. This Hollywood version is a strong, amazing (and surprisingly faithful) rendition of this die-hard score. I guess that should be expected with Broadway vet Paul Bogaev on board as the music supervisor. The new orchestrations and tiny variations in the score make this CD enjoyable because the music still surprises, only proving that the score stands the test of time considering it was written in the 70's. It only shows to prove that we don't have to resort to AM Gold and Pop Ballads of the past to come-up with a makeshift movie musical like \\"Moulin Rouge.\\" Hollywood went straight for the Real Thing. And \\"Chicago\\" is definitely the real thing.<br />Catherine Zeta-Jones is the strongest part of this CD (and in the movie, in my opinion) which shouldn't be a surprise since she got her start doing Broadway shows in London's West End. Her sultry song stylings on \\"All That Jazz\\" and \\"I Can't Do It Alone\\" simply stand out. Queen Latifah is another amazing performer and an inspired choice for the role of Matron \\"Mama\\" Morton. Her rendition of \\"When You're Good To Mama\\" is simply  memorable. \\"Class,\\" a song cut from the film (which shouldn't have been because it's one of the shows true showstopper), showcases Zeta-Jones and Latifah's amazing singing. Richard Gere sings well, adding a tinge of 20's style vocals giving the score a newfound authenticity although his \\"All I Care About\\" lacks the sauve demeanor, with his light, thin vocal stylings on that particulary song. Where he stands out is in \\"Razzle Dazzle\\" and \\"We Both Reached For The Gun.\\" Renee Zellweger tries hard (at times too hard) with her singing. Sure she's good on screen, but without the visuals, it doesn't stand strong especially right beside Zeta-Jones sexy Velma.<br />The new Kander & Ebb song \\"I Move On\\" and Danny Elfman's score cuts are a wonderful addition to this CD. The hip-hop rendition of \\"Cell Block Tango\\" could have been something else but it seems like a rushed effort to make the CD more accessible to younger audiences. Nevertheless, it's an enjoyable effort. Anastacia's \\"Love Is A Crime\\" doesn't make the cut as a 'song inspired by the film.' The song isn't a good pop song in general. Originally Janet Jackson was rumored to come up with the inspired pop song which could have worked amazingly well. Listening to \\"Love Is A Crime\\" only makes you wonder what Miss Janet If Your Nasty would have come up with instead of this little ditty.<br />Thankfully the CD focuses on the score and that makes this a strong soundtrack especially if you are a huge fan of the hit film. But if you're interested in the show itself and want more, the 1996 Broadway CD is a great companion and most likely you'll enjoy this soundtrack even more because the music in this show is simply amazing. A must for any collection.For The Gun.\\" Renee Zellweger tries hard (at times too hard) with her singing.

B00006X06U|1.0|Let me start by saying I love Joni Mitchell's music.  And I was excited to have, in one place, a collection of her body of work.  What I got in &quot;Travelogue&quot; was a mangling of many great tunes, accompanied by overwrought orchestration.  In fact, most of the songs are nearly unrecognizable.  <br />Mitchell's songs have always been pretty, funny, a bit wisecracking and sometimes pure fluff.  (&quot;And the sun poured down like butterscotch and stuck to all my sense&quot;  &quot;Hey farmer, farmer put away that DDT now.  You may spoil some apples but leave me the birds and the bees.  Please.&quot;)  This is not deep stuff.  But to listen to this CD set, you have to conclude that Mitchell thinks this stuff is deep.  Thus, the sweet, simple &quot;The Circle Game&quot; turns into a slow, ponderous mess.  Songs like &quot;Just Like This Train,&quot; and &quot;Circle Game,&quot; which were memorable in part because of the lively rhythms that brought to mind their themes, are now ironed flat against a monotonous orchestral backdrop.  <br />Gone is Mitchell's wit, her somewhat self-deprecating humor, her jazzy, unpredictable phrasing and her soaring vocals.  What is left is not worth buying.
B00003CXSP|3.0|Watching Hannibal after reading the book is exactly like rereading Cliff notes and realizing that the writers left out important insights and completely misrepresented several key points.  <br />I won't argue with the talent of Julianne Moore, though I think Jodie Foster's Clarice far surperior.  And Anthony Hopkins is good as Lecter in a role that wasn't written for much depth.  <br />I have to agree that this film sometimes is more comedic than suspenseful or horrifying--the dinner scene with Lecter and Starling being the main highlight.  That wasn't disturbing or gruesome.  It was funny.  I'm not really sure what could have been changed to make it the turning point that it was in the novel, but it came off as particularly black humor.<br />My main issue with this adaptation is the butchering of the ending.  I saw the movie first, then read the book, then watched the movie again and now the ending seems horrible and wrong.  The conclusion of the book was perhaps the most disturbing thing about it, that Clarice had finally fallen into Lecter's final trap--and that it was natural and even right--; that and her line &quot;See if I sound like Oliver Twist when I ask for more!&quot;  <br />I wish the ending that was filmed for Thomas Harris was released with some edition of the DVD.  The alternative ending in the water is better than the one released in the theaters.
B000059HGY|5.0|This film can tell story in very good detail.  NO fictional characters like in the remake Pearl Harbor, and NO corny love scenes to interfere with the action.  Also this film shows more of how the Japanese had planned the attacked than that ridiculous remake.  Very well acted from gifted actors such as Martin Balsam, Joseph Cotten, and E.G. Marshall, and other well acting from the unknown actors for some of us; Soh Yamamura as Yammamoto.  The entire action sequence of the bombing scene was done with great directing from both directors, and beautiful Oscar nominated photography by Charles F. Wheeler, Osami Furuya, Sinsaku Himeda, and Masamichi Satoh.  The Oscar winning special effects were amazing and a lot more realistic than a boucing ship in the remake (which is the worst thing they ever did since a ship can't exactly bounce in water).  The music score by Jerry Goldsmith keeps the film in good tension and never interferes with the action.  A very good docudrama on the attack on Pearl Harbor, this film should really explain about our stupidity and the cleverness of the Japanese during the events that led up to our entering the second World War.
B000075BFK|4.0|First of all Tupac is the best rapper there ever was.  His new album BETTER DAYZ is excellent and is well worth buying.  Better Days has excellent songs that make you want to turn the volume up, but also has song you can just chill to.  This album is at the very top of my favorites, but ALL EYEZ ON ME is still the best. My favorite songs on this album are STILL BALLIN, F**K EM ALL, MY BLOCK, THEY DONT GIVE A F**K ABOUT US, and both the acoustic and original THUGS MANSION. These are all excellent songs.  Another thing is that people are saying this album means Tupacs is alive, but I'm not sure about that.  I wish Tupac was alive but I dont think he is because he is still talkin about the Notorious BIG in some of his songs such as WHEN WE RIDE ON OUR ENEMYS, and F**K EM ALL.  You know how tupac is, don't you think he would have something to say about someone else? Whether he's dead or alive Tupac is still the realest rapper and you should buy this album because if its by Tupac you know its good.
B00005JKNF|2.0|I fully agree with the critics who called this movie Robert Altman's ill-disguised plea for a lifetime achievement award.  Far too often it screams out \\"Remember M*A*S*H!\\"  But what worked in the dark comedy genre falls flat in a drama.  In Gosford Park, the large cast and disjointed dialogue fuse confusion and boredom in the viewer's mind.  Yet, despite the vast array of vague and under-developed subplots, the movie can hardly be called a whodunit, as the murderer becomes easy to identify very early on.  Meanwhile, the viewer is subjected to almost ceaseless tales of woe and despair from a generally weak cast.  Stephen Fry manages to steal the show, completely upstaging his co-stars as a bumbling detective.  Yet, his lighthearted, almost farsically inept character is completely misplaced in Gosford Park's world of angst.  The historical accuracy is questionable; perhaps a few British historians should have been consulted.  I've heard that the visual effects were impressive on the large screen, but that is lost on DVD (unless perhaps you have a projection tv).
B00006RIO7|4.0|At first I was timid to see the movie, but after being blwon away by the movie I had to get the soundtrack. The movie stays relatively true to the Broadway musical. It's a wodnerful, dazzling album. &quot;Class&quot;, which was sadly cut from the film, is Catherine Zeta-Jones at her best! The new song &quot;Love Is A Crime&quot; from Anastacia is blah in content, but none-the-less an upbeat addition to the sassy album. Queen Latifah is a scene stealer with &quot;When You're Good To Mamma.&quot; Her other contribution with Lil Kim and Macy Gray, the reprise of &quot;Cell Block Tango&quot;, is less enjoyable than the movie version, also on the album. Overall, the CHICAGO Soundtrack razzle dazzles the listener; even the non-fans of musicals!

B00003CXA2|4.0|Why is it that Forrest Gump makes my cry while George Bailey's Christmas epiphany does nothing? At some level, I realize that I'm being manipulated and played as a chump. By reclaiming the symbols and events from an American history that I'm vaguely familiar with, Zemeckis has tampered directly with my brain. I know this but I still cry when Forrest's best friend Bubba dies...  or when his mother dies... or when his true love dies. <br />Jenny was Forrest's true love. They grew up together and her life was a shadow of his. It seems that the story of her wayward life provides the negative space for the luminence of Forrest's puritanical life style. Despite this analysis, she's not the villain of the story. She's the victim. The villain is her father. It seems that the abuses that Jenny suffers at a young age set her on the path of self destruction. Despite his best efforts, Forrest only becomes a protector and father figure when it's too late. Is the message that fathers can't protect their children or that parents can be the cause of much pain? Does this make me cry? It should but it doesn't.<br />Sally Field plays Forrest's mother. She always believes in Forrest's future and ability and makes considerable sacrifices to ensure that her son recieves an appropriate education. She stays at home to raise her son and supports all of his initiatives: playing football, joining the army, buying a shrimp boat, etc. Is the message that the value of mothers lies only in the succes of their children and that they should sacrifice their own aspirations for those of their children? Does this make me cry? It should but it doesn't.<br />Forrest is a dim witted southerner. Despite his limitations he attains every accolade of success that American society offers: he's an All American football player, a war hero, an entrepreneur, he meets the President several times, and he is featured on the cover of the National Examiner. Really, Gump is the bizarro-Schwarzenegger. He's a contradiction. His best friend is Bubba- a dim witted black southerner. Is the message that a white southerner having an African American best friend is a contradiction? Does this make me cry? It should but it doesn't.<br />I cry because I've been programmed to. Zemeckis marks the time of the movie with the occurrence of political events and assasinations. He uses these events to invoke emotional responses i.e., JFK Dead = Me Sad. Zemeckis also makes use of common narrative archetypes that invoke an emotional response i.e., Mother Dying = Me Sad; Jenny Dying = Orphan = Me Sad. Only the addition of a debtor's prison and a momma deer being shot by a hunter could complete this sensory assault.<br />The brilliance of this movie isn't its politcal message but the manipulation of my programmed responses...  <br />...it still make me cry.<br />PS- Forrest Gump also features an early performance by Haley Joel Osment. Time can only tell if appearing as a replicant in the Spielberg picture AI will elevate his career the way Blade Runner did for Rutger Hauer and Sean Young.
B0000041Q3|1.0|What is so good about this? Sutherland's diction and phrasing is the WORST ever. This is NOT Italian but some mushy bla bla! Also, she lacks the laser-like power of Nilsson and the dramatic perfection of Callas. Pavarotti is a Nemorino who wants to be Calaf, Manrico, Radames and such. A LYRIC pretending to be a spinto! Caballe saves the recording with a sublime Liu and yet she is NOTHING compared to Olivero, Vishnevskaya ETC. Why anyone would prefer this over the live-recording with Nilsson, Corelli and Vishnevskaya is a mystery.....!!!!!!!!!!!
B00006RIO7|5.0|I've been waiting for this CD (and movie) for so long, I honestly can't believe that I'm actually writing a small review of it!<br />First off...this CD is wonderful.  Like the movie, it's rich in voice and color and is the perfect companion to the movie.  I've added this to my collection of other Chicago recordings from around the world and I'm happy to hold this one in high regard.<br />I agree with the Amazon.com review that the two tracks from Queen Latifah and Anastacia are pretty ho-hum (they are actually just a chore to listen to...not inspired at all.  Anastacia shouts out \\"Chicag-O!\\" a few times but it's pretty lame.)<br />The rest of the tracks are dynam-o!  The show has such a great opening song, it's almost too bad that it comes so early in the movie.  I wish they would have separated the Overture from All That Jazz so you can skip through the opening instrumental to get to the singing but it's a small quibble.<br />For those that were distracted in the theater when the movie would make wild cuts, this CD presents a linear approach to the proceedings.  The Cell Block Tango sounds even better...they really did wonders with this particular orchestration.  <br />John C. Reilly and Queen Latifah shine heartily on their tracks, Catherine Zeta-Jones is a great belter and infuses her singing with that sly sexiness she brings to the screen, and Renee Zelwegger croons convincingly from track to track.  True, at times she tends to dig low and the notes come out a bit growly (the reprise of Nowadays illustrates this) but there is something quite appealing about her voice.<br />The only major flaw with this recording is Richard Gere.  Say what you will about him but his Al Jolson-esque singing just annoys the living daylights out of me.  If there is a weak link, he's it.  He comes off better in the movie I think, his tap dance at the end is exciting to watch.  His singing, though, had me wishing he had played it normally.<br />Here's the thing...if you like Chicagothe Movie, The Musical, or what...this is for you.  I would suggest seeing the movie first if you are unfamiliar with the music.  It's one of the better musical scores of the past half century and it's been given a whole new life with vibrant and booming orchestrations!
B0000028RR|5.0|What a good album!! Most consistent RATM album. Debuts dont get more in your face than this. EVERY song is single material! Best RATM album by a long shot.
B000066F6H|4.0|It took me a few listens to get into this CD.  I listened to the whole record straight through, was unimpressed, and let it collect dust for a while.  Later, I decided to give it another shot.  I ended up liking a few more of the songs, so I tried listening to it again.  Every time I heard the CD, I ended up liking more songs.  Now I really like almost all of them.<br />The band is really talented and they've put together a great little CD.  A few warnings, though: First, the band tries to sound very garage-ish, I liked this little effect, but more than one passenger in my car said that it annoyed them.  Second, many of the songs sound very similar.  Third, it's over all too quickly.  It's certainly not the shortest record I've ever heard, but it is over a bit quickly.<br />If you liked \\"Hate To Say I Told You So\\", you should check this CD out.  Just be sure to listen to it a few times before you make any final decisions.
B000002BYD|5.0|Very solid cd. One thing about pearl jam is that they have never made a BAD cd (even binaural had its moments). A very consistent record. P.J are an unpredictable rock band that are survivors of the grunge era and continue to produce rock music that is far better than 90% of the rock nowadays (ie Creed, Limp Bizkit, Hoobastank, Incubus etc). <br />If bands were to be judged on their consistency and innovation P.J would be considered the best band of the 90s in both these regards.
B000005QKJ|5.0|This is the movie that made Sigourney Weaver a noted actress.<BR>A space expedition is in space on a mission. Unknown to the crew there is a space monster involved that the company they work for wants captured. The spacecraft crew start getting killed off one<BR>by one. There are some very graphic scenes of the alien's craft.<BR>The special effects are also very good.Weaver winds up being the only member of the crew who is alive. She has a classical showdown with the alien. This is a very good movie that you will enjoy watching.The action is nonstop and the movie is very <BR>exciting. This will be one that you will always remember.
B000002BFZ|5.0|This album pretty much sums up Pearl Jams career.. Innovation and vastly different sounding songs. If bands were judged solely on talent and innovation then P.J would be considered one of the best bands of the 90s. Regardless, this album is very consistent and is one of my favorite PJ albums. Hail Hail, Smile, Lukin, Red Mosquito, Present Tense, In My Tree - all very interesting songs. <br />Only really 2 classic P.J songs on this album: Hail Hail &amp; Smile. In spite of this, No Code has NO FILLER AT ALL! - which is why this album is PJ's most consistent. Definitely buy this one if you like Yield. If you are one of those people that ONLY have VS and/or TEN i urge you to broaden your PJ horizons and you will find that Yield, No Code and Vitalogy are on-par if not superior to TEN and VS!
0385720920|2.0|I found this an easy to read yet dull book. I read half of the books pages in about an hour but had no real motivation to go on, nothing seems to happen, the characters by Palahniuk's standards are dull and rather cliche, you have all manor of freaks as to be expected, but theres the trouble with Palahniuk his side show parade of freaks and geeks is what you expect.<br />If you liked Survivor, and Fight Club there should be no reason why you woulnd't like this, more of the same really but I've found all his books interesting on one level but uninvolving on another, Fight Club worked marvelously as a film, maybe Chuck should look at writing film scripts?<br />Anyway I found this book dissapointing, after plowing through Fight Club, and Survivor and not finishing Choke I think I'm all Palahniukied out.
6305013578|2.0|Not a good copy of this great movie. I'd wait and buy the &quot;Restored Authorized Edition.&quot; Even though I bought this version, I've ordered the other. That's how much I like Metropolis is general.
B00006LLNU|4.0|They might not sing in english. They might not even sing in a translateable language, but that doesn't deteriate from the masterpiece that this quartet of Icelanders have created.No title to the cd, not even titles for the tracks. All there is are ( ). And what more would you need. Had they labeled the cd no one would even be able to read it. The band sings in a loosely based Icelandic language which they call Hopelandic. It creates a sense of feeling that just wants to put you to sleep. and once you've started listening to it you feel like you want to sleep. Their smooth elegant sound flows like cool wind on a hot day. This being their major label debut is however not as ambitious and distinctive as their previous album, Agaetis Byrjun. But ( ) has a much better flow and carries like air through your ears. 8.5/10
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I am sooooooooo excited about these songs!!!!!!!!!!!! <BR>They are **GREAT** I really love the beats, the rhythmn is gorgeous. <BR>I cannot stop listening to all the wonderful songs on the album!! <BR>Lena&Julia - the 2 girls of t.a.t.u. - are the pepper that makes this really unforgettable!!<BR>Their voices rock, yeah. It's new, it's AMAZING!!<BR>Ranging from \\"All the things she said\\" to \\"Not gonna get us\\" --<BR>you are nothing but FASCINATED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />So this is a MUST HAVE: AAA
B00006LSM3|5.0|Have you ever listened to an album where the music was so beautiful and moving that it brought tears to your eyes? Yes? Then buy \\"Brainwashed\\". In a word ...extraordinary.There is not a weak song on this cd.From the haunting \\"Marwa Blues\\" to the upbeat remake of\\"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\\",the music never lets you down. The absolute jewel of this cd is \\"Rising Sun\\" this song alone is worth the price of the cd.Although George is gone we can relive the past and see into the future from the music he left behind.
0316776963|1.0|To say I was horribly dissappointed would be an understatement. I bought this book because I am interested in moving to France to study. That and it came REALLY highly recommended.<br />I honestly don't know what other reviewers are talking about. See, I think this is like 2 books in one. <br />In the first part he talks about his family and his childhood. Really I think this book should give some sort of warning. Something like...............warning: extreme use of offensive language. This guy swore all over the place. It really didn't contribute all that much -- it just felt like sweraring for the sake of swearing. I didn't find the first part funny AT ALL I felt sorry for him and his family. It was terrible.<br />The second part of the book was MUCH better. I would give that 2.5 stars. This is the part where he talks about moving to France. Although, even then I will admit that certain chapters could be boring as well -- like the one where he talks about going to see movies in Paris.<br />Point is I really didn't enjoy this book. If you are looking book full of funny anecdotes about France -- buy A YEAR IN PROVENCE. Save your money and spend it elsewhere!
B00005YW4H|4.0|A local radio station here in Denver has played often &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; from Norah's Come Away With Me album, and it was a nice sound that grew on me, so I picked this cd up. It's great background music for a quiet evening alone, or with friends or that special someone. Very relaxing mood setting music, good for a rainy day, good for a sunny day. I like that she covered a classic tune in Cold, Cold Heart, and I was happy to see her performing in the recent cinema release of Two Weeks Notice - her voice was unmistakeable. I look forward to hearing something new from Norah.
B00005JKDR|5.0|From the start of Monsters, Inc. I knew that this one would beome a classic.  The movie is fun to watch for old as well as the young.  Goodman &amp; Crystal were fantastic as the voices of the main characters.  The suspense was metered out with just the right amount of intensity.  I thought that Toy Story was great and it is but move over Toy Story I &amp; II, Monsters, Inc is a must have DVD for young and old movie watchers.  The characters are delightful.  The imagination it took to create all the different variations on normal everyday life was masterful.
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer is a musical delight. His lyrics are personal, intimate and heartfelt, and the musical arrangements on this cd focus on his winning vocal style. Some compare him to Dave Matthews - another great musical talent, but I wait with great anticipation to hear the next new thing from John Mayer. He was a wonderful discovery for me this last year after hearing &quot;No Such Thing&quot; on a local radio station. I missed a chance to catch a concert he had here last summer, but you can bet I will be quick to purchase tickets should he make it back anytime soon. <BR>Personal faves on this album - Why Georgia, Great Indoors, 3 x 5, 83... it's too hard to choose - they're all great!
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I never thought I'd see the day where I'd hear mellotron on a Johnny Cash recording...well, that day is here, and, of all things, on a spellbinding reinterpretation of 'Bridge Over Troubled Water!'  I heard this one whilst browsing in the comfort of my local Borders, and it stopped me in my ever-lovin' tracks.  <br />But wait!  There's more, people...much more.  'Personal Jesus' takes on a whole new meaning with Cash at the mike. Martin Gore and the rest of the Depeche Mode posse have never been better represented in song. <br />And don't get me started with 'I Hung My Head' - he not only covers this album filler track written by Sting...he elevates it and makes it his own.  No longer an album filler, it becomes rife with the kind of raw substance that only The Man In Black can deliver. <br />There are other affectations to be found here, but these revelations alone are worth the modest price of admission.
B000056H24|5.0|I really love this film.  I don't really care that it isn't completely faithful to the Bible, I think this film captures the essence of Jesus' teachings better than the other films.  Max Von Sydow is wonderful and convincing. And Charleston Heston steals the show as John the Baptist. A wonderful tribute to the greatest man to ever live.  You can't go wrong with this one, get it!
B00005QDW1|4.0|After listening to 'Rock Steady', I cannot help but notice that No Doubt have definately got what it takes to be a well-originated band whose music will never expire. Although most media attention homes in on Gwen Stefani nowadays (especially since her marriage to Gavin Rossdale). Here you have an album which shows off the multitude of talents which lie within the other band members. You have awesome, hip-hop driven basslines from Tony Kanal to get your head nodding to. Punk guitar riffs supplied by Tom Dumont to compliment the keyboards, and Adrian Young dishing out the drumbeats to give the tunes an edge. If you are a No Doubt fan, and have been throughout the ages please don't be fooled by the recent opinions which state that No Doubt have gone 'POP'. Though they have found a sound which is popular within todays music in the charts, they have by no means left their Ska-Punk roots behind them. They have used them to expand upon which is more for what I can say about those three-chord wonder bands who think that they are punk in all its glory. Gwen may of had her fair share of collaborations in the past, but here, with 'Rock Steady' she has stuck by her group to prove that No Doubt will continue to be a band which will forever find new sounds and styles to embark on, and are not prepared to stop yet. You have been warned :0)
B00006RIO7|5.0|For fans of the movie this is a must own soundtrack.  Unlike other soundtracks this one is true to the film and maintains all of the great songs and performances.  There are a couple of additional songs that are fun to hear.  Listening to the CD is like being in the movie theater again!
B00006RCNW|5.0|I had always heard tv shows described as &quot;Riveting!&quot; After seeing this show, I knew what everyone else wished they were talking about. This is the show that redefined amazing television.
0440237688|5.0|This is the best book I have read in a long time. I was pleasantly surprised with the lyrical writing and thought provoking topics covered in this young adult fiction book. This would be a wonderful book to use for stimulating a discussion of modern-day values, a must read for youth!!!
0553381709|2.0|In the first two books it was refreshing, but it steadily got worse. Now we've reached my tolerance level. In this book I have to say there is something to disgust all of mankind in some way: Depravity, death on a large scale, death on a small scale described intensely, Necromancy, horrible treachery, likeable characters destroyed as a matter of course, CHILDREN becoming killers...I've had enough. <br />I'll just say one more thing, once I agreed with people who said Robert Jordan was a chicken using \\"immortal\\" main characters etc. No longer. I completely and totally support that style of writing after reading this book. I'm going to get volume 10 of the Wheel of Time and LOVE EVERY PAGE OF IT!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This movie will be a classic.  The story is great with incredible voice acting by Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz.  The visuals are are spectacular!  I have a progressive scan DVD and HDTV and this movie is trually breath-taking.  A few good extras on the DVD like the &quot;making of&quot;/&quot;tech of&quot; and karoke time with the characters.
B0000029GA|5.0|Before this I've never listened to a NAS album before, but this made me a believer. Although he doesn't have the \\"every-song\\" consistency of Eminem, its still a good album nonetheless. New York State of Mind, One Time for your mind & It ain't hard to tell are some of my personal favorites though after much deliberation I'd have to decree \\"Halftime\\" as the most lyrical (As far as punchlines go) All in all, its the rawest nAS album to date.
B00003CX95|4.0|This movie is a classic, I would consider the film itself a five star flick, but the extras on the DVD are pretty weak.
B000053VAF|3.0|Does anybody else have problems with this special edition crashing the DVD player?
B00003CXE7|5.0|This movie is awesome.  Great Battle scene in the beginning, good drama, good villian.  The ending is a little goofy, and not at all factual, but overall a fun and entertaining epic.  The DVD has great extras too.
B00006RIO7|4.0|The arrangements are the best of this material on recording, in my humble opinion.  As most movie musicals take a Broadway score and butcher it with bland pop sensibility and overblown orchestral arrangements, those behind this recording chose to keep it on the minimalistic side, as it should be.  At the risk of sounding a bit cliche, the arrangements succeed in transporting the listener from his car or living room to a smokey cabaret. <BR> <BR>Some of the strongest voices come from the most surprising cast members, noteably Renee Zellweger and John C. Reilly.  For having never really sung before, her voice is surprisingly strong, expressive, and unique.  Those familiar with Queen Latifah's performance in \\"Living Out Loud\\" were most certainly expecting \\"When You're Good to Mama\\" to be as absolutely fabulous as it indeed was (the woman should really do a jazz album and show off those pipes).<br />Catherine Zeta-Jones and Richard Gere were really perfectly cast for the film and played the roles to the \\"t\\".  Zeta-Jones' sexy, husky voice works well and Gere's adequate pipes, again, work well to drive home Flynn's smarmy charm.<br />The bonus material, however, is fairly weak.  Though I am an Anastacia fan, I am really not fond of the track \\"Love is a Crime\\" as it's simply a bland pop song trying to be an R&B track trying to have a showtune sensibility.  The Queen Latifah, Li'l Kim, Macy Gray version of \\"Cell Block Tango\\" is a rather tepid attempt, as well.  <br />The only number from the film that I was dissapointed with was \\"Cell Block Tango\\".  It's always been a favorite of mine and, in the film, it was staged and choreographed perfectly - beyond my wildest dreams, really.  Unfortunately, it seems Rob Marshall felt the need to extract all humor from what should be a very darkly comic number by forcing the women to take themselves entirely too seriously.  If you can get your hands on any of the cast recordings, you'll see what I mean.<br />In the end, however, this recording is a sleek, intelligent, well-performed and well-executed soundtrack.
0060278269|5.0|Abhorsen by Garth Nix is the third book in a trilogy, starting with Sabriel and then Lirael and finally ending with Abhorsen. If you have not read these books, it would probably be very confusing for you, so I suggest you start at the beggining.<br />I have anxiously awaited 'Abhorsen' for almost a year now. I wasn't disappointed! Lirael, Sam, the Disreputable Dog, Mogget, and other favorite characters come back in this tale of the climatic final battle against whatever it is they are digging up in Red Lake.<br />The story is extremely suspensfull, leaving you on the edge of your seat and unable to put the book down. I found myself missing my book even for the day that I was too busy to read it! Filled with life, death, magic, spectacular characters and a wonderful writing style, Garth Nix has successfully put out another winner. The ending is a little vague (not much of an epilouge), but I think it is more fun that way, letting the reader use their imagination to decide what happens to the characters.<br />If there was ever a series that I wish I could get everyone I knew to read, it would be this series. 6 stars, most definately. Don't pass this up.
B0000640VN|4.0|This is not my kind of movie.  While I have seen an occasional good chick flick I would not choose them, normally too sappy and light.  I saw this at the theater ( under protest ) and it was sappy and light, filled with plot holes, but mildly amusing.  Don't ask me why I bothered to watch the directors cut on the DVD, I don't know, but I am glad I did.  This is almost a completely different film.  Many of the inconsistencies of character motivation are cleared up, the characters actually deveolop in signifigent ways, and it contines a bit more of the messiness that accompanies real relationships, even if doing so in a fantasy premise.  <BR>   For example, in the theatrical release there is no reason for the motivations of Meg's ex.  He is fixated on this guy, then fixated on Meg being with him.  In the theatrical release the only motivation I could ascribe to him was to get rid of the pain in the butt ex-girl freind by hooking her up with someone else and sending her away.  In the directors cut issues of fate, the resiliance of the tapestry of time (if one were to interfear directly in their personal history they would already be a product of that interfearence), and a very very attenuated incest theme that probably is what led to this being cut.  In addiiton, Meg Ryan's character is much more fully realized, rather than a wounded woman on the rebound, she is a deeply cynical, perhaps deeply wounded, woman who reacts to the civility of charm of Jackmon not just as a \\" I found someone \\" type, but as one who is awakening to the fact that there are good people, idealism and integrity are not lies, and thus sheds her armour of cynasism.<BR>  The addition of these things create drama in what was otherwise poor fluff ( but I must complement all the actors. )<BR>   The most interesting scean, however, was one in which Meg, playing a marketing expert, tells a director that main character in the movie they are screening is unlikeable etc, and she points out that they are killing cinema.  I notice several reviews note this as hypocracy.  Maybe,  I don't know what was in the directors head when he filmed that scean.  However, it also could have been a brilliant backhand slap at the fools that released the theatrical cut, surely based on such focus groups rather than doing it as the director wanted.  They got what they deserved and he has his little laugh.  He clearly demonstrated his point, not by makeing a great film, but makeing one what was solid, interesting and enjoyable that they turned in to schlock.
1577311523|5.0|My father gave me this book as a gift for Christmas.  Little did I know upon receiving it that it had the power to change the lens in which I view the world.  Living in such a high-paced, money and egocentric era, I have found it extremely difficult to find true joy, and to find myself for that matter.  We are constantly bombarded with ideologies that perpetuate the decadent nature of our existence.  This makes it extremely hard for the individual to break away from these cultural \\"norms\\", as they are virtually hardwired into our ways of being.  Life has always seemed to be a cycle of winning and losing, of ups and downs, of happiness and sorrow.  This book has the potential to break these cycles and bring you true joy and acceptance of not only yourself, but the world [universe] around you -- which Tolle contends is one in the same.  Joy is not rooted in religion, acheivement, money or any other physical or ideological manifestation... it is much simpler than that.  Joy is rooted in YOU (in the form of spirituality), and Tolle tells you exactly what to practice in order to achieve the ultimate feeling.  Perhaps the best part of the process is that it is attainable as you read the book.  It is a very deep book, so read it slowly and relish its every word.  I plan on reading it again.  If you need an ideology to compare it to, I would say that it is very Zen-like, but again, this is only a comparison.  I recommend this book to all my friends and loved ones, and I recommend it to you too.  Stop your suffering, and begin living in the \\"Now\\".  Forget who you were or where you want to go.  Deal with things on a moment to moment basis.  You have nothing to lose and everything to gain by reading this book.  Enjoy!<BR>As one last footnote - if you are a person who is constantly lost in thought regarding past events or future, imaginary points in time, (like I was) this book brings you back to where you belong, and to where true joy exists - you guessed it... NOW.
0446343129|5.0|I read this book last year and have taken it to heart.  It IS very hard to totally eliminate refined sugar in this country, but just cutting WAY back has made major differences.  My wife no longer has mood swings and we both have a more optimistic outlook on life.  I am only slightly affected by allergies that used to be crippling!  <br /> This is good stuff.  This book lays it on the line in an easy to follow manner.  It is NOT a medical review of substances, but what Dufty has to say is backed by results, results which have been duplicated in my own life!
0553278223|5.0|With the passing of the master (Isaac Asimov)the question is hardly asked anymore.  Who's better, Bradbury or Asimov?  The two were both born in 1920 and they made their fame in the forties, fifties, and sixties, writing (and pioneering) a kind of fantastical pulp fiction that would eventually become known as science fiction.  In short, the two men were giants of the genre and so their work, their art, naturally invited comparison.  I have always loved them both, Asimov for his great ideas and Bradbury for his great storytelling voice.  Asimov, the university professor, was trained as a hard science man--physics, mathematics, chemistry.  If he had not made his name as a writer, he probably would have designed the first rocket ship that landed on the moon.  In fact, we owe him thanks for the word &quot;ROBOT&quot;, the rules for governing them (ha-ha-ha, see I Robot), and the fledgling field of robotics itself.  Is there a more representative work of science fiction than The Foundation Trilogy?  Though Asimov is known primarily in literary circles as a science fiction writer, the great man was a thinker of ideas so varied that his books earned him a place in the Guinness Book of World Records: he is the only author who has at least one book in every category of the Dewey Decimal System.  In other words, no matter where you are in the library, you can find a book written by Asimov.  Bradbury, on the other hand, is not a scientist.  In fact, if you check out some of the stories in the Martian Chronicles, his best collection, you will discover working rocket ships that were built with hammers and nails in somebody's barn.  You'll find life forms that are bubbles with voices.  You'll find a variety of strange and contradictory rules for space flight.  And you know what?  None of it matters because Bradbury's appeal, unlike Asimov's, has nothing to do with his grasp of scientific principles and the various real and imagined extrapolations thereof.  We read Bradbury because he is a writer first and a scientist second.  Bradbury could write a story about ice melting in a cup, and we'd be on page 200, reading with pleasure,  before we looked up and said, hey, why the heck am I reading a story about ice melting in a cup?  Bradbury explores the humanity of his characters when he writes, as the stories in the Martian Chronicles prove, and he has an absolutely addictive storytelling voice.  It's kinda like sitting under a tree with your grandfather and listening to him spin yearns.  Time passes before you know it, and you wish he could go on talking forever.  So here it is then, Read the Martian Chronicles not for the science, but for the fiction, and you will not be disappointed by the master.
B000059PR5|4.0|I remember seeing this movie when I was 15 years old.  It has ever since burned an impression in my mind as a movie that should not be missed or dismissed.<br />Just recieved my copy tonight from Amazon, which I hadn't seen in the almost 20 years since it originally aired.  While it wasn't exactly as horrific as I remember, it certainly will leave an impression that is daunting and yet leave you with a sense of incredible sadness as this could be a reality for us at any time.<br />The same school year that this movie came out (one of the best Made-For-TV movies ((IMO)) ever made, I had a World History teacher tell us that it would not be Russia (the former USSR) that would follow through with a nuclear threat, but smaller more rogue nations like we see in this year of 2003.  I can't help but think he is right and knew something many of us didn't understand, including my elders.<br />If you haven't seen this movie, I recommend a viewing through a rental to see if it's something you want in your collection.  It can be very disturbing and definately not for the weak or those easily disturbed by potentially real events depicted in fiction.<br />You may \\"walk\\" away with a sense of dread but maybe some hope given this was 20 years ago and we haven't hit that point yet.  Never mind the clothes, the hair, the whatever, don't let the time period cloud you from the quality of the story and the potential reality of the story line.  It is worth seeing and pondering.  War, no matter it's origins always leaves innocent people in it's wake and this is one of those wars that does such a thing.<br />Jason Robards, those many years ago, at the end of the movie, left an image burned into my brain that I relived this night.  An image that has haunted me for almost 20 years.  I kid you not, this is not for the weak, those that always think the world is coming to an end...
B000002UWP|5.0|I have been a huge Roxette fan for many years. I can only comment about the same things as other fans... Per's pop sound genius work combined with Marie's beautiful melodic voice is quite a treasure. This album is a treasure!! The power and sensuality in the song Do You Get Excited? makes it one of my favorite all-time songs!
0316666343|5.0|I loved this book.  I thought it was written from a unique point of view, and once i started reading it, I couldn't put it down.  It grabs your attention from the beginning.
0140177396|4.0|Of Mice and Men was an excellent book.  It tells the story of two men traveling and working together. Beginning in nature, it gives a sense of peacefulness.  As the story goes on you learn about how one man causes trouble for the other.  It tells of their big dreams for the future, but with a surprise, twisted ending, you learn there dreams will never come true.  It is a very easy read while still giving a good story.
0790734850|1.0|Don't misunderstand me--this movie IS the tour de force that others have expounded on here already--and I love it as much as anyone, ranking it right up there with Chinatown as an L.A. film noir classic. But you will NOT see the movie Curtis Hanson made if you watch this widescreen DVD edition!!<br />   I have watched this movie countless times on videotape and so I was SHOCKED to find that the DVD noticably detracted from what this film is! Though the back of the DVD case details \\"WIDESCREEN VERSION Presented in a \\"letterbox\\" widescreen format preserving the SCOPE ASPECT RATIO of its original theatrical exhibition\\", I did NOT find this to be true (and I am no newcomer to widescreen format). Shots that had appeared as medium shots on video have become head shots--people are now out of frame--this is a CHANGED film! --and WEIRD things also occur with the soundtrack! Dialogue is mixed at a noticably lower level relative to background and peripheral noises that are overly augmented. <br />   I have to say, it boggles my mind that watching this movie in the \\"newest and most improved\\" format has, for the first time, left me feeling like I watched 2 entirely different movies. There is an artistic freedom being threatened here by what is ultimately a revisionist medium, the implications of which are truly frightening--and oddly parallel to current world events.<br />  In all fairness, I haven't even gotten to the special features, and maybe this DVD is worth having for those rarities themselves, I don't know. But if you have never watched this extraordinary film, I beg you, SEEK  IT OUT ON VHS! or you will miss the experience. If you love this film already, be prepared for a letdown with this one.

B00006RIO7|5.0|This Soundtrack is one of the best CD's I have ever heard. All of the energy from the movie transcends onto this recording, and Catherine Zeta-Jones is one of the best singers I have heard in a long time. Actually, surprisingly, so is Queen Latifah. Richard Gere's nasally yet wonderful performance is accompanies Renée Zellweger's beautiful alto and Zeta-Jones's gorgeous belting to make this one of my favorite CD's of all time and a must for any collection. <BR> <BR>There is a downside, though. First of all, I really am not an instrumental piece fan, so I can't make a fair judgement on Danny Elfman's 2 instrumental pieces. The last two tracks, a hip-hop remix of \\"The Cell Block Tango,\\" performed by Latifah, Lil' Kim and Macy Gray is just laughable. And the usually supurb Anastacia sounds worn out in her  \\"Love is a Crime.\\" Neither of these songs really sound like they belong on the CD, so I don't really count them as a part of it. <br />In conclusion, get it. Now. Or you'll regret it. (I would not suggest this CD for someone who has never enjoyed musicals, but for even a casual fan, it is a must-have.)
B000056VPD|1.0|There is no &quot;power&quot; to this concert.  It's like drinking decaf coffee, it feels like coffee but something is missing.  That something is GB's slick guitar work and the free flow spirit of jazz as manifested in improvisation. in fact GB hardly played his guitar in this concert and when he did, his performance was lack lustre, almost amateurish let alone having any improvisation .  GB sang a lot but hardly at the same standard as his &quot;Live in Hollywood&quot; LP in the early 80s.  Even his band members' performance was lacking.  There was a string and brass orchestra to enhance the presentation but no effort was made to  integrate their music with the electric band.  at one point, it feels like the string orchestra was playing in another hall while the electric band was jamming. the worst part of the show was the fat chicks from the audience at the front of the stage.  come on, if you want to show the audience having a good time, get some pretty young girls.  regrettably in the middle of the concert, a bunch of fat chicks swang their fat around.... aweful scene. i already seen enough fat around in my daily suburbia life, no need to see it on DVD.  very disappointing DVD throughout.  i learned one thing from this DVD though, there are lots of fat chicks in belfast Ireland.  the irish diet did it to them.
B000025C85|5.0|Very different from earlier J.M.Jarre and very good . Some people told me : this is not real him , it is too different . I did not agree with them . Technology was developing very fast in mid80's so as J.M.Jarre did . We can't expect him to stay in one place and not to move forward , as he did with this album .<BR> I'll give you 2 opposite examples :<BR>1. Kitaro . After he moved away from Japan ... his music changed from best to worse . He changed ... <BR>2. Pierre Jeunet . The director of \\" City of Lost Children \\" and \\" Alien 4 \\". His new film \\" Amelie \\" is soooo different from earlier work ... I was shocked by it , but I loved it . He changed but he moved forward .<BR> So as Jean Michel Jarre with this album . Try to listen to it while walking in the crowd ... you'll find 2 different rhythms : one for you and another one \\" for them \\". Excellent feeling of being a part of the crowd but being all by yourself at the same time .
B00007E8V4|5.0|No...I can't bring myself to believe that these are rejects. Well, I guess System's \\"trash\\" is another band's \\"aspiration\\". Other nu-metal bands could only hope to be half as good as SOAD's B-sides. I almost didn't waste the 11.99 on this cd but I'm so glad I did.<br />1. Chic N Stu- This might be my favorite song on the whole damn album. Its worth stealing for this song alone! Worthy of anything on Toxicity (except for Needles and Deer Dance and Chop Suey and ATWA and Toxicity....) 10/10<br />2. Innervision- At first I was like, hmmm....its an okay song....but the more i listened to it the more I fell in love with it. Beautiful. 9/10<BR>3. Bubbles- Wow. That's all I can say. 10/10<BR>4. Boom!- I love the chorus to this song and the very end of it too. SOAD really knows how to end a song with a bang. 10/10<BR>5. Nuguns- Not as good as the previous four songs...7/10<BR>6. ADD- Again, this song didnt impress me the first 10 times I heard it. Then suddenly one day I was listening to it and I realized that it was one of the best songs. This CD keeps amazing me. 10/10<BR>7. Mr Jack- A slower song but it picks up speed at the end and I LOVE the way it ends, when he screams and then it just cuts off. Very powerful. 9/10<BR>8. A-E-I-E-I-O- If there were a single to this CD, this song would be it. All around catchy, very singable. 9/10<BR>9. 36- Why so short? I want more! This is the strangest song by far, just because of the voice inflections and weird guitar thingy. \\"Life is so...unnecessary!\\" 8/10<BR>10. Pictures- Another very catchy song. I like the little drum cadence. 9/10<BR>11. Highway Song- Haunting, beautiful melody. 9/10<BR>12. *uck the System- A tribute to what the band is all about. Amen. 9/10<BR>13. Egobrain- A third song that I fell in love with after a few dozen listens. And getting better every time. 9/10<BR>14. Thetaways- It's ok...kind of blends into the rest of the songs, doesn't stand out all that much to me. 7/10<BR>15. Roulette- The guys slow down fora second here to catch their breath, I guess. And I'm glad they did- the result is...well...breath-taking. 9/10<BR>16. Streamline- This one also kind of blends in and doesn't really stand out on its own. Don't get me wrong, still good though. 7/10<br />Hope that was helpful!
B0000648WZ|2.0|Okay, I'll admit it. This movie ... Just look at the character interactions: The main character cheats on his girlfriend, and we're supposed to cheer for him, but if his girlfirend cheated on him, we're supposed to boo her. Not only that, but he girl he cheated on his girlfriend with has a boyfriend of her own! And everybody's... OKAY with this?!? Add to that the bugs who shoot plasma out of their butts, the Giant Brain-Eating Brain, several other completely ludicrous bug types, and the fact that these completely separate species of bugs all seem to peacefully coexist with each other, and you would have one of the least logical and most poorly planned-out Sci-Fi movies ever... WOULD, that is, if not for the sneaking suspicion that it's just too bad to be real. There's just no possible way the movie could be this bad unless it was supposed to be that way. This is like a parody of all those horrible sci-fi b-movie cliches, except that it's not really that funny. Many parts of this movie are so humorously unreal, you can't pretend that this movie was ever trying to be serious. If you're looking for all that stuff about totalitarianism and propaganda or whatever the hell Heinlen's novel was about, then you'll be disappointed by the distict lack of it here. If you're looking for a good movie at all, well, you'll still be disappointed. However, if you're looking for something that makes fun of bad sci-fi movies (while unfortunately becoming one of them), this is the place to go. It's not really funny enough to be a comedy or parody, but it's still oddly entertaining.
B00005RYKV|5.0|Takeshi Kitano is a respected Japanese film director.  His films are brutal dramas of life in the Japanese mafia, not action thrillers, but slowly paced and carefully constructed commentary on the meaning of violence, honor, and even love.  He uses long stretches of silence, and shots in which very little movement takes place.  These serve to give the film a pensive atmosphere, and contrast with bursts of violence coming out of nowhere, with no warning and no stylistic embellishment.  Kitano stabs a man with the exact same level of intensity as he turns on a light switch.  Gunfights in Kitano's movies are often nothing more than two combatants standing in a room firing bullet after bullet into each other until only the one with the most willpower is left standing.  The standard Kitano &quot;hero&quot; is doomed from the start, as are basically all the other characters.  The background of mafia violence is not the focus of the film, but is used to intensify its message.  Kitano's philosophy is that in order to show the greatest of one thing, you must show it's opposite.  In order to show the greatest love, and the greatest peace, one must show the strongest hatred and violence.  The experience of watching one of his films is unique.  They are quite powerful, unlike anything else being made today.<br />That said, 'Brother' is not as good as most Kitano films.  It doesn't seem to have that much original to say.  What is does do well is transplant perfectly Kitano's style from Japan to the United States.  As a fan I enjoyed the film and am sure other Kitano fans will as well.<br />Newcomers to Kitano's films may expect this to be an action movie.  They will be disappointed.  This movie needs to be watched and judged it for what it is, a piece of art first and entertainment second.
B00000G3PA|1.0|Treat the 1 star rating as the sum of -2 stars on the movie and +3 stars for the Criterion treatment.<BR>Armageddon is perhaps the silliest big budget space adventure movie ever made. Don't buy this if you're looking for a movie that makes sense. The characters are stereotypical, the situations are implausible. It's only redeeming quality is that some of the scenes look cool.
B00005LQ04|5.0|The classic Argento film (which inspired Bridget Fonda to get into acting according to an interview on the disc) gets the special DVD treatment from the always great Anchor Bay.<br />The transfer is wonderful, the bonus features, including recent interviews with cast and crew are priceless. The addition of the booklet and lobby card reproductions only adds to this collector's item. Oh, did I mention that the original soundtrack by the Goblins is the third disc?<br />This is &quot;Suspiria&quot; as it was meant to be seen.
B00005O5JV|1.0|I was really excited about going to watch Legally Blonde the first time. Within 10 minutes, I was bored out of my mind and ready to sneak into another movie. But, I stuck it out. It was BOUND to get better right??? WRONG! The plot was completly predictable and unfunny. A blonde girl gets dump by boy. Goes after boy. Finds out boy isn't worth it. Finds a better boy and gains self-confidence. Blah, blah, blah. Throughout the whole movie, I didn't &quot;laugh-out-loud&quot; for one moment. There wasn't even a chuckle. Maybe at the Nail (or hair) salon, but it was a FORCED chuckle. I can never understand what all the hype was about. Just because Reese is adorable doesn't mean the movie is.<br />P.S. I've seen Clueless and Bring It On ATLEAST 10 times each, so you know I know my fluff. This movie was just a disgrace.
B00006NSZ5|3.0|One of the most overrated albums I've listened to for 2002.  Not that it was totally terrible.  Basically, every song by Eminem was garbage...and that even includes that highly overplayed song \\"Lose Yourself.\\"  Don't get me wrong, Eminem is a decent rapper, but when it comes to serious rapping, I can't take him serious.  He ought to stick his more comical approach in his rhymes.  Those are at least amusing.  While his songs were \\"...\\" in my opinion, other artists shined on this soundtrack.  I highly enjoyed songs by 50 Cent, Obie Trice, X to the Z, Gangstarr, and of course the legendary Rakim.  <br />I lost a whole lot of respect for Eminem as a rapper as a result of his contributing to this soundtrack.  Also, what's the deal with putting Macy Grey on it???  Definately don't get it for just Eminem...his songs are weak.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|Rainbow Children is a great and spiritual album!  I bought this album a couple of days ago and I heard some good reviews about it through other fans.  They were right!!  The album is really good!   It makes heart feel good whenever I hear this album!  The things that I like most about Prince is that he is a unique artist and he has a god-given talent and he shows it in \\"Rainbow Children.\\"  My favorite song is \\"Last December\\". What an awesome song!  I recommend this album to anyone!!
B000002H4Q|5.0|Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me is one of my favorite Cure albums.  It's packed with great music and has a discernible atmosphere that distinguishes it from most other alternative music.  The Cure was a big part of my teenaged years, and this music sounds as good today as it did back then.  Just Like Heaven and Hot Hot Hot!!! are the two tracks most likely to be familiar to the uninitiated, the first song catching the group at one of their more mainstream (yet unique) moments and the latter proving that The Cure could appeal to a wider audience while remaining perfectly and distinctively themselves.  My nod for best song on the album, though, would go to Why Can't I Be You? which is actually quite upbeat and danceable (if you're so inclined).  This song is one of several that deliver a virtual cacophony of sound, including prominent horns against the familiar background sounds of the band.  Catch, How Beautiful You Are, and The Perfect Girl have an infectious, ditty-like quality to them, breaking the music free from the clinging maudlin environment one expects to find front man Robert Smith in much of the time.  Of course, melancholia exists among these tracks as well.  If Only Tonight We Could Sleep is a slow, sentimental song which sounds wonderful until you get to One More Time, which outdoes it in poignancy.  And then you get to A Thousand Hours; if ever a Cure song could be called beautiful, this is the one.  Robert Smith says more in a few words than most singers do over the course of an entire album.  When Smith sings \\"For how much longer can I howl into this wind, for how much longer can I cry like this?\\" I find myself quite moved every time; the vocals are raw and impassioned and seem to incorporate so much anxiety and angst into them that the overall effect is incredible.  I don't want you to think that the guys went soft on this album, though: Torture is a release of pent-up feelings, Shiver and Shake tells it like it is, and the final track Fight energizes each past, former, or future Cure addict to be who you are and who you want to be regardless of what others may think of you.<br />You may actually want to look for the tape rather than the CD of this particular album.  While the CD is quite long, extending well over an hour, the tape contains one track not included on the CD: Hey You.  It's actually one of my favorite songs on the album, full of bounce and inspiration, even though it isn't very long in duration.  There is really more variety to be found on this album than on most other Cure releases, and I think this is the best selection with which to introduce today's generation to the music we thirtysomethings indulged in during our youth.  I would still have to name Disintegration as the group's best album, but I really believe Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me is their most appealing offering.h past, former, or future Cure addict to be who you are and who you want to be regardless of what others may think of you.  <br />You may actually want to look for the tape rather than the CD of this particular album.

B00005QDW5|5.0|Anything that is titled \\"Best Of\\" is always suspect to the usual problem of why isn't so and so on it or what is so and so doing off it. Well lets get that bit out of the way. Firstly in this Dog House Best of any Pink Floyd album would contain \\"Saucerful of Secrets\\" from \\"Ummagumma\\", \\"Remergence\\" (the end of Atom Heart Mother) and \\"Mudmen\\" from \\"Obscured by Clouds\\". And certainly would not include the dreadful \\"When Tigers Broke Free\\" who's only inclusion must be because it not available any where else on C.D, as it has only ever been released before as a single (failed) in 1982 from additional material written for \\"The Wall, The Movie\\". Also, nowhere on a `Best of Pink Floyd'should there be anything from the awful last album by the Roger Waters led Pink Floyd \\"The Final Cut\\" represented here by the extremely boring \\"Fletcher Memorial Home\\". Still, enough of griping, the rest of the two hours thirty- five minutes you get here is wonderful. Three from \\"Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\". \\"Set the controls for the heart of the Sun\\" (the only track ever recorded by Pink Floyd as a five piece, before the lovable, but totally mad Syd Barret scuttled off into the sunset,) and \\"Jugband Blues\\" from \\"Saucerful of Secrets\\", \\"One of these days\\" and the mighty \\"Echoes\\" (magnificently edited down to a more manageable seventeen minutes from the original twenty three, although keeping all the beeps, bonks, clangers and David Gilmour's soaring guitar solos - probably amongst the best he ever laid down in the studio) from \\"Meddle\\" fortunately the best half of the tracks from \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" five in all, two from \\"Wish You Were Here\\", one from \\"Animals\\", four from \\"The Wall\\" (about as many as you need, lets face it when you are \\"Comfortably Numb\\" who cares), and four tracks carefully selected from the last two Waterless albums (Momentary lapse of Reason and Division Bell). But unfortunately nothing from their 3 wonderful live albums.<br /><br />Altogether this proves that Pink Floyd still reign as the finest band in space, best of all though is that the album is topped and tailed by two fine Syd Barret songs, which not only bring a bit of light to the generally gloomy Pink Floyd thoughts. But should hopefully bring a few pennies into Syd's coffers as I'm sure they will be more than welcome, at his reclusive home in Cambridge.<br />Disc two climaxes with the soaring \\"High Hopes\\" which looks like being the final expression of their moody majesty, the last track from the last Pink Floyd album. But there's one final twist in the tale as the closing chord decays, a bell rings and up pops Syd to sing \\"Bike\\" a genuinely cheerful, pleasantly bathetic coda to a brilliant career. Which is what makes this such a wonderful \\"Best Of\\" as songs from 1994 slip faultlessly into 1967 songs without missing a beat. Wonderful, that's Pink Floyd, Bye Bye, Thank you for sharing, Have a nice retirement.<br />Mott the Dog.till reign as the finest band in space, best of all though is that the album is topped and tailed by two fine Syd Barret songs, which not only bring a bit of light to the generally gloomy Pink Floyd thoughts.

B00000FCBC|5.0|The best album after Metallica (5th, Black album). The covers are more than excellent, especially the ones in the second CD. Good job for the company, because it's not easy to find all the CD Singles previously released.
6305949980|5.0|In my opinion this is the best stop-action film ever! The plot is unique: The denizens of Halloween Town kidnap Santa Claus and spend their Christmas by making it all a mess. The dark environment is perfectly depicted and the music is great. A Tim Burton creation. Therefore it is dark, a bit frightening and the humor is sarcastic. A perfect animated movie for all tastes!

Michael Chiklis brings a raw intensity and a complicated morality to his cop character that you will never see anywhere else on television--even in the movies! After watching him, it's easy to see why he won an award for it.. The storylines are intriguing, almost shocking, but always fascinating because it will leave with many questions to ponder about in our law enforcement system. <br />Possible downsides for some: disturbing themes/plotlines, language<br />Advantages: unique cop show, writing, Chiklis' performance

0441172717|5.0|Pual Maud'Dip, a Duke's son, a Human computer, the ultimate Fighter, a man who see the doors through the corridors of time. Trained from birth in the musculature and mind manipulation of the Bene Gessirit. He is slamed into manhood, when his father is murdered, his house betrayed and the only survivors are him and his mother. Abandoned on possibly the most unhabitable place in the universe, and coincidently the most valuable, they must learn to learn, learn to move, learn to think, learn to fight, and learn to lead a people who have proclamed Him their Messih. This is one of those few masterpieces that can enthral the mind and wrap the senses. It is a fascinating literary accomplishment spaning time and the human mind in a way never before concieved.
B00006X06U|2.0|Joni's final disc is a big disappointment.  It is too over-produced.  The overblown orchestration overwhelms so many songs and unfortunately comes over as predictable and unadventurous - far too many lush strings.  &quot;Chinese Cafe&quot; &amp; &quot;Cherokee Louise&quot;, in particular, sound positively mawkish/ maudlin.  Joni's voice is rich and powerful as ever though, but it is hardly cheerful. I can't imagine listening to it again very often - there is  an air of depression to it.  I am a huge Joni fan but prefer to keep the original versions to memory.  Beautifully packaged boxed cd though, lets hope she changes her mind and releases a disc of new original songs one last time.
0553213105|4.0|Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austin, is a story of how a girl learns that the outward appearance can be deceiving. In this story many believe that a young man is quite awful. The two main characters, Elizabeth Bennet and Mr Darcy, end up effecting each others lives and changing their ways of seeing. Jane Austin's story truly tells a story with many turns in the road.<br /> With great surprises this book is not easy to put down. When things happen sometimes the least expected people are the ones who are helpful. I found this an enjoyable story with a few exceptions.<br /> Although I didn't really mind the style of writing it may be confusing to a reader. The reason is because of the style used when the book was written. In some parts it was easy to lose concentration, but it would grab my attention again.<br /> This was a wonderful story and perhaps one that would be best to read over and over. Not all people would enjoy this book. I found that it told a good story that gives the message to never judge a book by its cover.<br /> This book may be considered a love story. It truly told how being prejudice doesn't mean you are right about someone. The lesson learned in this book should be a lesson we all know about so maybe we can save ourselves from making the mistake of judging one another.

B00005JLRR|3.0|one can hardly imagine the nextgeneration tv series without the enormous talent of patrick stewart or brent spiner.  they have entertained and inspired many with their terrific performances and their personal integrity.  however, this 4th tng trekfilm, though enjoyable to any trekfan like myself, suffers from a somewhat meaningless plot which focuses on picard and data - AGAIN.  and that's just the problem, since \\"generations\\" these two lead-actors have ensured that their characters are featured prominently in each film's plot.  and it seems to me that there are MANY other great trekstories that will go unmade because the trekfilm producers must satisfy the character demands of picard and data.  i'm confident that the enormously talented trekwriters and producer rick berman could contrive superior plots than they've offered up in the last two movies.  obviously a worf-driven klingon plot or the return of spock or a whoopi goldberg-centered story would certainly spice up the trekfilm series while including more emphasis on the other trek characters.  they need to be free to give us the unexpected in a thg movie.  stewart and spiner should let go of their hold on the franchise and resist the temptation to create the \\"kirk/spock\\" mold that WAS successful for the original series movies - but which appears to be creatively strangling the next generation films.
B000063V8T|5.0|I've been a TNG fan since the beginning, but was hesitant to purchase these dvd's due to the high cost, and the fact that I've seen them all a million times in syndication. Then one afternoon I said screw it, since I'll end up getting them anyway some day.<br />  This fifth season set is what I chose to start with, and I definitely don't regret it. Seeing these episodes again, in dvd format, was like seeing them for the first time. The picture quality is excellent, as well as the sound. It also seems that the special fx take on a new life. Very impressive.<br />  Fifth season was probably one of the best. The season started wonderfully with the Klingon/Romulan plot of &quot;Redemption&quot; pt 2, and continued w/ a Klingon/Romulan theme for &quot;Unification&quot;(not to leave out a visit from Spock himself). We were introduced to &quot;Ensign Ro&quot;, and the beginnings of what would be the DS9 universe. Lwaxana Troi and Alexander returned, Ashley Judd payed a visit, Denise Crosby showed up twice, Kelsey Grammer made a cameo, not to mention Stephen Hawking himself.<br />The Borg returned in &quot;I, Borg&quot;, and &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; gave us &quot;Data's head&quot; (the second time Data's head was seperated this season). More highlights include the &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;-like &quot;Cause and Effect&quot;, a visit to Starfleet Academy in &quot;The First Duty&quot;, the &quot;crew has amnesia&quot; ep &quot;Conundrum&quot;, and the cloaked/phased Geordi/Ro ep &quot;The Next Phase&quot;.<br />  I'm glad I started my collection with this season, an overall good one. Just wish the price was a little more reasonable considering DS9 is coming this year, and Voyager later on. That's a lot of seasons of Trek, at a high price.  There goes all my extra cash for the next ten years!
B00004XQ83|5.0|I never realized that this was the &quot;old time&quot; country music.  I may be wrong, and if I am, then I stand corrected.  Someone told me it was a cross between mountain and country, but, since I am no afficianado of any form of country music, I have no Idear.  All I know is, it is absolutely wonderful.  I do like this music!The movie was so genuinely moving, I went right out and bought the Soundtrack. Again, I am not a country music fan, but I am a fan of this type of music.  Allison Krause is superb, and I know I will be listening to her music in the future.  My advice is...watch the movie then get the soundtrack...you won't regret it.

(I don't know what some of these people are complaining about)<br />Walk Away, Impossible, Beautiful, Cruz, Soar, Dirrty, Voice Within, I'm OK, and Keep on Singin' My Song.  I've played the CD at least once a day since its' October release and it keeps getting better.  <br />I've actually been motivated and inspired...pick it up.
0060537639|1.0|To answer the query of the review which asks, is this book reliable? No. <BR>This is not a work of history. It is fiction. <BR>As a professor of Chinese history, I cringe now thinking about the time that I will have to take during class, time that could be used teaching about Chinese history and civilization, to disabuse students who have heard about this caper. <BR>My opinion: Mr. Menzies is sincere. He seems perfectly intelligent and decent. However, there is no evidence that Chinese were in North America during the early 15th century. The conclusions reached in this book are the product of the imagination. This is not my 'opinion.' The 'evidence' presented is bizarrely not credible. Fantasy. But the publishers knew what they were doing when they signed the deal, the book is selling. <br />The more interesting story, which some scholars are telling, is this: that the technology which explorers such as Christopher Columbus used to reach the 'new world' was borrowed from China. A few examples of Chinese technology that found its way into Portuguese ships: 1. fixed rudder; 2. multiple masts; 3. compass; 4. cannon; 5. gunpowder; 6. airtight bulkheads. <br />Perhaps the most significant part of this project is this: Mr. Menzies stated that he was surprised to meet two professors in China who were making the same argument. This idea, that China 'discovered America', reflects a new nationalism in China. This idea is not popular among professors in China, but I will not be surprised if we discover a few months from now that this project enjoyed support from political circles within China. <br />On the other hand, as someone who cares deeply about China's history and about US-China understanding, perhaps this book will stimulate an interest among people to learn more about China. So, maybe all this will have a happy ending.

0141301104|5.0|I read this book twice so far.... my 7 year son and I enjoyed it very much. It's one of our favourite books. The description of \\"de vitches\\" is hilarious and the thrill of the story makes it a very pleasant reading also for parents. It's also mildly scary and children like scary stuff... but not too much!
0793573742|5.0|This book is a one trick pony, but it nails its subject matter cold.  If you know anything about the vintage guitar market you already know that the Gibson Les Pauls made between 1958 and 1960 are some of the most valuable and highly sought after instruments ever made.  The people that collect them are absolute freaks when it comes to amassing encyclopedic knowledge of every minute detail that relates in any way to the construction and performance of these guitars.  This book is tailor made for those 'Burst-a-holics.<br />The book is also a terrific coffee table book for any guitar collector, or enthusiast who shares the love and interest of high end collectors for this celebrated model but doesn't have a few million dollars in spare cash kicking around the house to build a collection of 'bursts.  The photographs are magnificent and the book on the whole does a marvelous job of entertaining and informing.  It's like buying a multi-million dollar guitar collection for the price of the book.  You don't get to play them and hold them, but you sure can look at them and learn all there is to know about why they play and sound the way they do.<br />Functional sculpture . . . that's what a vintage Les Paul really is and this book does both the art and the craft of the historic '58-'60 Les Pauls justice.
B00005JKZT|5.0|This is the kind of movie you will want to own. Like the Empire Strikes Back, this is a brilliant middle act. Having seen it several times, it remains entertaining. The hyperkinetic cinematography is possibly the best ever filmed. Breathtaking shots. Golem has some outstanding comic moments. The battle scenes are some of the most involving and exciting. <br>Isn't it interesting that in 2002-03 the big hit has moral clarity and is written buy a guy named Tolkien! Maybe classic storytelling is the most universal and the most profitable. Take careful note of this Hollywood! This looks great on DVD!
B00005JKZ3|4.0|Like the editorial review says, MIB 2 &quot;safely repeats everything that made 'Men in Black' the blockbuster hit.&quot; Which is the reason I watched it; the first one made me laugh, so it was a good bet the second one would, too. And it did.<br />Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are still hilarious as Agents K &amp; J. I love K's deadpan delivery and J's over the top posturing. Sure, maybe the movie could have been more original, but it's still worth a watch if you liked the first one.
B00006GA4C|4.0|it will strike a chord.  <br />If not, well, maybe you won't get it.
B00005JKDQ|5.0|oh , these is really my favourite 3d movie i love it and think that it is a perfect  movie for the whole family (kids ,parents,and grandparents)  . it is really an excellent film from all sides .
0375414053|5.0|When I started reading this book, it took me a while to \\"get into it,\\" mostly because I was disappointed that it was written from a British perspective. I want the exact same book, rewritten from an American mom's perspective. Don't get me wrong, I loved it. It's just that I couldn't always relate to nannies, nappies, wellies, and other brit terms that didn't jive with my Midwestern upbringing.<br /><br />ANYWAY, the book itself was a masterpiece of modern mommy angst. As working women, we kill ourselves to make our lives better for our children, yet in the process, we're robbed of the things we hold most dear: time and memories.<br /><br /> I read till 1am last night, putting aside baths, books, and backpack prep, just to find out what Kate Reddy did in the end. Would she choose work? Or would she choose mommydom? I just wanted THE ANSWER to make my own life easier. I found out, there is no easy answer. Kate's choice wouldn't work for me, but at least she got me dreaming about the possibilities.
B000050XEI|5.0|This last spring we believed that our 18 year old daughter was dying of lymphoma.  For a week, while sitting/waiting and meditating and praying, I listened to this CD.<br />I felt as though I were in the presence of angels that were comforting me.  <br />Thankfully I can say that today our daughter is alive and attending college.  My family listens to this music and prays to the Almighty with thanks that she is healed.  This music comforted me through one of the most difficult weeks of my life.<br />Thank you Enya.

B00006EXL5|5.0|This Cd is incredible. I listen to music like Rainer Maria and Braid. I think My Chemical Romance is up there with the best. There is a reason they have opened for Thursday. I recommend the song &quot;vampires will never hurt you&quot;. Do yourself a favor and dont listen to Liam Seery. Save your ears for this awesome cd
B00005AXEL|5.0|The CD has been with me for a while and I must have listened to it 50 times. The tracks on the CD are pretty much all winners, and the sum of that is an album that I have the highest opinion of. My initial reaction upon listening to it was mixed but that soon changed. As always Stevies voice is a pleasure to listen to, and the musical backing is impeccable. Just listen to tracks like &quot;Every Day&quot;, &quot;Too far from Texas&quot;, &quot; I miss You&quot; and you'll be convinced.
0345409671|5.0|I found the book great,excellent and perfect. I really love the book. As a matter of fact I decided to buy every chronicle book as soon as possible. I recommende everyone to go out and at least get a used one like I did.
B000055Y0X|5.0|This might be my favorite film of all time.  Kubrick created a genuine masterpiece with this movie.  The other glowing reviews here pretty much cover every comic nuance of this great flick so I won't duplicate the effort here.  If you have not seen this movie stop whatever you're doing, find a copy and watch it right now.<br />If you have seen this film and even if you own the VHS make the investment in the DVD . . . the bonus features are well worth it and will give you new insights into this incredible dark comedy.<br />FYI . . . keep your eye on the Russian embassador during the scene in which Strangelove gets out of the wheelchair . . . he starts to crack up at Peter Seller's ad libbed performance and then catches himself - - very funny stuff.
B000063UR2|3.0|This isn't going to be long. <BR>I had to get Legend because it's one of those movies people have to have if they consider themselves Fantasy fans.  Also, Tom Cruise is in it, so if you collect his movies, then put this one right up there w/ Top Gun and Risky Business!<BR>However, while this is a beautiful movie, the plot is pretty cliche.  And I don't even mind the clicheness, but you'll probably leave this movie feeling like something is missing.  It's just not the most fulfilling movie ever.  <br />However, it is fun, and since it's only rated PG, you can watch it w/ your little sister if you want to:)  Also, there are some very decent extras on the Ultimate collection, as it is a two disk piece!
B00006M183|1.0|What a disappointment. Yes, Ed Vedder's patented warble is strong as ever but hints at how good the glory days of the mid-90's were for this seminal band. Now it seems all the good tunes are being done by bands aping the PJ style while the originals are content to bore everyone else to tears with uninspired garbage like RIOT ACT. I couldn't wait for it to end. And to think, this from a band whose singer last great work was with the late, great Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan (Dead Man Walking strk). The record label must be counting the albums left on their contract so as to be rid of them. Pearl Jam is to rock what Prince was to funk/soul - dismal failures as the years went on.
B00000099Y|5.0|One thing I notice a lot with bands is that in order to benefit the most from fans, they almost have to stay under the radar their entire career yet still be successful so they can continue making albums. Bands like Radiohead and Tool have the critical and commercial success they should have yet there's a feeling that they're \\"overrated\\", most likely brought on by constant chatter of how they're one of the best bands in rock. But when you have Aenima, Tool's 2nd full-length, I wouldn't say they're the best band today but they're certainly consistent. Btw: I won't bother with the so-called \\"filler\\" tracks. <br /> <br />The album starts with Stinkfist, a very controversial song upon release, it's one of the better crafted songs on the album with some great vocals by Maynard. It's not really one of my favorite Tool songs ever but it's definately a favorite on the album. From there we move to Eulogy, another fan favorite with an odd spoon-sounding intro, big riffs and powerful vocals by Maynard. H. is probably one of the more underrated songs but even though it's not a huge favorite, it's got some great aspects to it and musician interplay. Another popular song off the record, though not a single was 46 & 2, which speaks of the human chromosomes and potentially getting 2 more. An incredibly catchy riff is the basis of the song and it almost sounds like a twisted pop tune if radio embraced this kind of stuff.  <br /> <br />Jimmy, like H. is another rarely-spoken of song and it's actually quite good with catchy riffs and great lyrics and vocals. But again, some might gravitate towards the more popular ones first. Pu**** is weirdly better on the Salival version with powerful-as-hell vocals by Maynard. This version is good but then you hear the live one and go \\"wow, this one's kind of...better\\". Aenema is basically a lyrical assault on Los Angeles and the purging of all that is \\"fake\\". Musically it's good too but I love reading the lyrics. Third Eye is a huge epic, completewith multiple solos, time signature changes and even a sketch by late comedian Bill Hicks. Even if it's the longest song at 13 minutes, it's rarely, if ever, a boring song. <br /> <br />Even though they do offer breaks, with stuff such as a weird threatening phone message (Message to Harry Manback), recipe for cookie (Die Eier Von Satan) and a vinyl reaching its end (Useful Idiot), the songs here are so strong that they seem kind of useless. But taken out, the album rarely missteps and even lesser-known songs like Jimmy or H. are quite listenable. Highly recommended album.
B00007BHOE|5.0|This DVD is defiantely kick [booty]. You see their set from London as well as see them backstage before the show, autograpgh signings and more. If you think you'll see under their masks, well think again. You shouldn't have expected  that anyway cause it's all about the music. You want to see a kick [booty] show, you'll see a kick ass show. There's a 2nd disc which provides all their videos with a special animated version of \\"Wait and Bleed.\\" They have a feature called VIP which while watching, it pops up saying \\"VIP\\" and you hit your subtitle button and you see some more backstage adventures. Everything is just kick [booty]. The sound and video quality is just great and you see a kick [booty] show all in one. Get this for all of your maggots and they won't be disappointed. This is definately and \\"Disasterpiece!\\"
B00005QY5Y|5.0|Appropriate title.  Everything the man touches is pure Gold.  It is refreshing that an artist like Mr. Adams exists in this trendy-filled society.  Same vein as Tweedy, Pirner, Westerberg, etc.  Pure artist.  No gloss.
B00003CXI1|3.0|If you know me, you know Im a sucker for a good  book. And the book was pretty good. The movie was amusing, and had some deacent effects. But it didnt match the book. <br />All in all, worth watching, not worth buying till you can get the set. The second movie is easily 5 times better. if that trend continues, the next movie will be pretty darn good.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Take the genius of any genre'.  Mix in blender.  Jeff Tweedy and co. are pure artists.  If music could be a painting, this is the cd.  All previous Wilco cd's were a warning that this would happen.  Pure genius.  Where does Mr. Tweedy go from here?
B000065U1N|5.0|if you dislike blood, and couldnt be around a real surgery, dont go. In my time as a pre-med student, I have never seen anything to compare. It is extreemely realistic, in terms of the violence and results. It outstrips movies like saving private ryan in terms of realism, and does it without any dificulty.<br />I think that this is a movie that should be seen by any person advocating war, at any time or for any reason. This movie is valuble because it is so objective. It does not glorify war, but neither does it demonify it. It just shows it, good and bad, need and death. <br />Dont watch this if all you want is entertainment. If this is entertaining to you, you really have some issues that I urge you to deal with through therapy or something in that arena. its not a special effects movie, though it has those. it is an educational experience. It is as close to being in war as you can get without actually going. And it is based on the true events, which makes it that much more real.
B000075BFK|5.0|This album shows that Tupac was all about peace but it also shows that he knew there was not going to be peace, you can feel the hopelessness in his songs. I like this album, because it's real just like all his other works. My favorite track is \\"who do u believe in\\" because in it he talks about God, which was his base and what drove him to write. I mean I used to like BIGGIE but once i heard Tupac do his thing i was like....wow he's real. BIGGIE was talking about devils in his songs and Tupac was talking about God that's when I realized, Tupac is the man, so who do you believe in?
B00000K19E|3.0|it was groundbreaking, but now it has been surpassed. It is interesting, but there are better. Its morality is questioned, its value is medium.<br />I used to love this movie. I was one of the fanatics when it came out. As I have grown since then, I have thought about it on occasion, and I do not believe it to be the wonder that everyone thought it was. I wont deny its interesting, or that it has some pretty sweet sound effects, but I no longer feel the need to even own it. anyone want my copy?
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina has definitely changed my mind. I thought she was just another Britney clone when she came out, but I realized that her talent matches Mariah and Whitney. I did not get to buy her first album because I listened to it once and most of the songs were a little too bland. However, I got to download the tracks for \\"Stripped\\" online, and I couldn't be more impressed. All of the songs are great, and this time rather than singing uninspiring lyrics such as \\"I'll be the rain in your summer\\", most of the songs on \\"Stripped\\" have meaning, except \\"Get Mine Get Yours\\" and \\"Dirrty\\". ... I commend her for taking so much time with doing the best she could, and not having to make songs called \\"A Genie is What a Girl Wants to Be\\" nor release albums every day unlike Britney. And I cannot wait when she tours and I get to hear REAL singing. Christina, I'm now one of your biggest fans and you are the best singer ever.
B000002C1V|5.0|The general consensus seems to be that Final Cut is a Roger Waters solo album    While it's true that Roger dominates on this disk in a much more dramatic way than he did on The Wall (about which you could make much the same argument), this album hangs together so much better than Roger's later work that it's impossible not to acknowledge David Gilmour's contributions. Even in his diminished role on this album, Gilmour clearly brings a lot.     And while Gilmour's post-Floyd work has also been strong (though I much prefer the stripped-down \\"David Gilmour\\" or \\"About Face\\" to the ponderous post-Waters Floyd albums), it doesn't have the bite that Waters brought.     I think Gilmour and Waters are like most other famous rock teams: Better together than apart, whether out of competition or complement. Neither has, alone, achieved anything close to what they achieved together.    This album kicks the hell out of Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking and Momentary Lapse of Reason with equal ease.
B000066NW0|4.0|This is not my normal type of music (I usually like techno or metal), but I caught a couple of the tracks on the radio and picked up this cd.  There are no bad tracks on the cd.  All of them are good with Complicated being very good and Sk8er Boi being my favorite.
B00005OAIE|5.0|my friend introduced me to john mayer, and i haven't stopped thanking her yet! the CD is amazing; the songs are beautiful and catchy. john's voice is smooth and melodic, like dave matthews. this CD should definately be on your list if you like michelle branch, nora jones, jack johnson, dave matthews, nine days, goo goo dolls...
B00000K31Q|5.0|I was very pleasantly surprised with the movie itself.  I was expecting a mindless forgettable teen movie, but found that I really enjoyed it.  The dvd is well done, but does not contain many extras.
B00000IPAX|1.0|...Blink 182 was a fine band. Buddha, Dude Ranch, and Chesire Cat were all fine CDs. The along comes this one. It really can't get much worse. Blink went from being a mostly talented punk band to a pop band that just wanted to be on TRL...This CD is an afront to humanity, and an embarresment to punk. I don't mind all pop-punk, but I can't stand a sellout band. Blink, I'm soooo dissapointed.
0316666343|3.0|The Lovely Bones is a novel with great ambition.  With so many in the world fearful of death, the novel gives many people the hope that heaven is not a place where we stop growing, it is just a place we go to continue our learning process.  And, if this were all this story were about, it would be much easier to swallow.  However, the author attempts to make the story too universal and it sinks.<br />I personally found Susie Salmon to be a wonderful main character.  The development of each of the other main characters is well thought out, and the way the author delves into the psyche of the grieving is amazing.  I felt compassion for the father, admiration for Lindsey, and hope for the future with Buckely.  Though I am not really sure I liked the mother character very much, I felt she was justified in her desire to escape the death of her daughter.<br />But that is were my admiration ends.  I am still confounded about the author's need to have an \\"in-body\\" experience with Ruth.  The sex scene between Ray and Susie was uncalled for, and personally I found it rather unnecessary.  I felt the author was making a point that people whom have not had sex cannot go on to the next stage of salvation.  I also did not understand why the character of Ruth was not furious at Ray for the use of her body when she was not consenting.<br />Overall, I believe that Sebold is a talented writer.  She paints a lovely portrait of people and how life affects the way we look at everything that comes next.  However, the ending to the novel is too absurd to overlook and the lack of communication between both the writer and the reader is hard to miss.  Also, the quick death of Mr. Harvey is very convenient and too quick a resolution.  I look forward to reading Sebold's next novel; I just hope she thinks more about her plot line choices before she finishes the book.
B00005JKZ3|4.0|It's not as much fun as the first MIB, but that film was something most of us had not seen before: science fiction that's intentionally funny. Still, Men in Black II, or as the marketing hype would have it, MIIB, has its own diversions and perversions - just enough to keep you laughing on the same frequency with the designs of director Barry Sonnenfeld.<br />The villain this time is not some ugly bug played by Vincent D'Onofrio, vacationing from Lawn Order, but the beautiful temptress Serleena, played by the beautiful temptress Lara Flynn Boyle. She's really a Kylothian monster who had been tricked into looking elsewhere for something she wants to steal, but which Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) hid from her before he was \\"neuralized\\" and took the identity of lowly postmaster Kevin Brown, lacking the memories that could save the planet. His trainee from last episode, Agent J (Will Smith), is now a full MIB and must restore K's memory and save the day. He isn't helped this time by sexy coroner Linda Fiorentino (did I really just write \\"sexy coroner\\"?), but enlists Laura Vasquez (Rosario Dawson), an employee at a pizza parlor. The action gets cracking when K is de-neuralized with the help of returning alien/citizen, and pawn shop procurer, Jack Jeebs (Tony Shalhoub), although Jack loses and grows back a couple of heads in the process.<br />Having directed the original MIB, Sonnenfeld has a sure hand on this sequel. The performances by Smith and Jones were equal to their previous efforts. It was good to see Rip Torn in his role as Zed, and the aliens, including the expanded presence of the \\"worms,\\" and the rather annoying Frank (a dog/alien voiced by Tim Blaney), were well used. Ms. Boyle is believable both as a villain and as a Victoria's Secret model (way too thin!). As sequels run, this is one of the better models. <br />My favorite line comes from Lara Flynn Boyle as Serleena: \\"Silly little planet. Anyone could take over the place with the right set of mammary glands.\\"
B00005JKCH|4.0|First, I confess, I was a teenage fan of the comicbooks.<br />On the surface, I was delighted to see that the makers of the film held pretty closely to the comicbook tale, with some modern modifications. The story reels you in quickly.<br />Sadly, I felt Tobey was a bit wimpy for the role. Am I the only one who felt this way? Granted, he is supposed to represent the geeky, unpopular student in high school, but even after he is bitten by the spider he still seems a bit wimpy for the part.<br />Still, the film is an entertaining ride. Dafoe does an excellent job playing the complex villian. The action and special effects scenes are excellent. Perhaps I saw the film too close to 9-11, but the scenes of the Green Goblin terrorizing people in New York hit just a little too closely to home.<br />Tobey does a good job of capturing the burden of his responsibility as Spiderman. The film ends on a tentative note, hinting at the sequels which will inevitably come.<br />The DVD includes additional screen test shots and interviews that are enjoyable.
B00005JKCH|2.0|Why wasn't this film a cartoon?<br />That's the question that nagged me as I watched Spider-Man. I'm beginning to believe that Computer Generated Imagery (CGI) is a narcotic in Hollywood (second only to the addiction of exporting film industry jobs to Canada). Spider-Man, directed by Sam Raimi (who did so well directing A Simple Plan in 1998), represents the worst of both worlds.<br />As with all movies taken from comic books, this character created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko for MARVEL comics - we are unpleasantly reminded of Marvel at the very first frame of the film - the story starts with the creation of our super-hero. A nerdy high school student (Tobey Maguire), with a passion for photography, is bitten by a genetically modified spider and gains spider-like abilities. These include great strength, agility, the ability to shoot webs from his wrists, and to kiss gorgeous babes while hanging upside-down. Well, maybe not that last one. As befits the super-hero tradition, his name begins with the same consonants (Peter Parker), and he is an orphan, brought up by kindly Aunt May Parker (Rosemary Harris) and Uncle Ben Parker (a geezerlike and underutilized Cliff Robertson).<br />The human story (screenplay by David \\"Jurassic Park\\" Koepp) is not so bad: Spidey, er, Peter, longs for the unattainable Mary Jane Watson (the gorgeous Kirsten Dunst, who I last saw in Crazy/Beautiful in 2001), who longs to be an actress. Trouble is, she sees everybody but Peter because Peter won't ask her out. She only notices him when he becomes Spider-Man... most guys know how that goes. But there's trouble in Gotham City - er, sorry, wrong super-hero! - a soon-to-be-mad scientist (Willem Dafoe, who I last saw in Auto-Focus, 2002), faced with a funding cut-off, transforms himself into an evil alter ego known as the Green Goblin (repeated consonants again). GG doesn't seem to have much purpose aside from urban mayhem, and he can't even move his face, but he does put MJ (Dunst) in danger acouple of times, providing Spider-Man with the occasion to save her life, and to give her that memorable kiss (actually, looking at MJ's rain-soaked sweater was more memorable for me). It's all filmed in New York and LA, too! So far so good.<br />Granted, these are super-heroes portrayed by human actors and real people can't do these things, but I was seriously put off by the CGI/animation of the hero-villain fights. I'm not opposed to a little digital tinkering with reality, but I think the overuse of these effects (the CGI credits list is as long as Spidey's web) reduced the human element to infinitesimal. The characters might as well have populated a cartoon: there was nothing remotely realistic about them, especially their apparent weightlessness. There was never a moment in Spider-Man when I wondered if I was looking at a CGI effect or if I was looking at human actors; it was all fake. For me, this destroyed the verisimilitude, my willing suspension of disbelief mired in a suspension of belief. You can't have that in a movie that relies on a strong element of magic for its power.<br />Maybe CGI is becoming too easy. Why wasn't this film a cartoon? Maybe because the Spider-Man I remember already is.
0061020710|5.0|There are only so many different ways that we reviewers can tell you, the potential buyers, how great a book or series is.  I remember, back in the day...several monthes ago...when I was the potential buyer reading reviews, and I thought to myself, \\"Self, you're cool, you've got a pretty good sense of humor, and you're at least...moderatly...intelligent.  Can all of these glowing reviews be serious?\\"  Yes they are.  It is now just under half a year since I bought The Color of Magic, I recently finished the 25th book in the series, and Pratchett still manages to hold my attention.<br />What's so great about Pratchett?  It is not that he is simply funny; he's smart.  Most of his humor is, too.  Pratchett does not insult the intelligence of his audience by explaining his humor.  He assumes that you are going to get it, and he also assumes that you are going to understand any allusions he uses to make his books amusing. (i.e. Gormenghast, Faust, any Shakespearean play...)  His footnotes are more like short stories than references.<br />Long story short: Pratchett is amazing, funny, smart, cool, entertaining, engaging,...er...a...ma..mammal,...and...ah...british.  Anyway, see what we are all gushing about, try a Pratchett book.
B00006JDVV|2.0|I am at a loss to explain this film. Reign of Fire takes place in a post-holocaust world, desolated by dragons who, some years ago, were disturbed from their underground hibernation by English miners and soon took over the world. What is left of humanity lives hand-to-mouth in enclaves here and there around the world; government is non-existent; technology survives, but not enough of it to fight back on a large scale.<br />One English enclave is nominally ruled by a not-so-mighty Quinn (Christian Bale), the grownup version of the boy who discovered the dragon lair while his mother (Alice Krige) was working. Into their suspicious embrace one day come some Americans: \\"Only thing worse than dragons: Americans,\\" says Creedy (Gerard Butler). Among them are a half-crazed leader named Denton Van Zan (a buffed-up Matthew McConaughey) and his helicopter pilot, Alex (Polish-born beauty Izabella Scorupco, who I hadn't seen since the 1995 James Bond film, GoldenEye). They teach the obviously slow-witted Brits how to fight back against the beasts. This takes them to London, where they battle the king - no, not that King, the king dragon, by whom all female dragons are fertilized. (If the analogy to a queen bee holds, how can they be sure there is only one?)<br />I admire the obvious effort that this film required, from making dragons fly to simulating the scorched-earth look of future London and its environs, but the whole concept of Reign of Fire troubles me. Even granting the possibility of dragons (no beast that heavy could fly; no creature can stand fire, much less spew it), it doesn't make sense that a species that has the weaponry to wipe itself out in mere hours could fail to eradicate this winged menace. It's much more likely that humankind will fall to a microbe than to a monster. It's also not likely that a devastated earth would have petrol (gasoline) and working vehicles, especially helicopters. Finally, the whole film is grim, as if photographed through the grit ofa miner's boot. The human interactions carry no substance and no importance. By the end, I was rooting for the dragons: I just wanted it to be over.
B00000613T|4.0|I agree with another reviewer that the technical merits of this performance are hindered by some lack of urgency.  I am a huge fan of the Mahler 9 and this recording is a good buy for someone looking for a tight performance.  It is my opinion, however, that the performance bears some mechanical characteristics which keep me from giving it more than 4 stars.  Might give it 4.5 stars if I could.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|..as stated by the tatu group. Upon first hearing the \\"All the things she said\\" song on MTV, I was shocked. The video was just so out there and in your face, it was two girls kissing in the rain and nobody could deny it. I remember a couple of my friends reactions, \\"well is the one with dark hair a boy or what, i dont get it?\\" It was totally amazing to me that two girls had dared to break through the barrier that exists in life as demonstrated by the fence in the video. I was insatntly gripped and wanted to know more. Its not often I feel compelled to do so but instantly I searched everywhere...<br />Upon finding the album, there were no disapointments whatsoever. Although about half of the album is simply remixes or russian versians of the songs, the album is absolute perfection. \\"Show me love\\" is a love song with a twist, it questions love and sex and hints at a part of us that craves physical love. The lyrics in the verses are haunting and upon first hearing did send shivers up my spine and the music itself is slow then fast then slow, its amazing.<br />other superb songs include \\"not gonna get us\\" the dancey song of determination at its highest; \\"malchik gay\\" an upbeat song with an undercurrent of homsexuality; and \\"30 minutes\\" with its eerie background noises that do almost make me adicted to the song..<br />Overall every one of the songs is brilliant, for me only with exception to the 30 minutes remix which i couldnt really get into at all. The russian songs are spectactular, especially stars which is half russian half english.<br />This is music at its finest, different, haunting, compelling and with two girls who hopefully could become well known figures, whether or not they are lesbians is beside the point, the fact is they challenge the stigma attached to homosexuality and for that I would say they deserve sucess.
B00004SVID|5.0|The Wall is one of my favorite Pink Floyd albums (along with Animals, Atom heart Mother, Piper at the Gates of Dawn etc...) so I was a little nervous about hearing the quality of the band's live interpretation. My worried were cast aside as I listened through the 2-cd set. This is a great album for any Pink Floyd fan. The performances are rock solid and faithful to the studio cd and they present a few new bits which only serve to make it that much better. Enjoy.....I Do!
B00006RIO7|5.0|When Catherine Zeta-Jones began to belt out \\"All That Jazz,\\" on the screen, I said to myself with a shiver, \\"oh my! I WANT this soundtrack!\\"<br />This doesn't happen a lot; not with musicals.  Ok, so I can belt out all of the Wizard of OZ songs, and I was obsessed by Annie when I was 10 (I'm 28 now), but other than that, I stick to my pj harvey, joni mitchell, tori amos, portishead...etc...for the belting out in the car.<br />But this music is exciting! It's fun, and jazzy, and sexy and a little camp, and just great! I could do without the two hip-hop/r&b songs stuck onto the end of the cd (meant to appeal to whom, I wonder?) Will a different crowd buy the soundtrack only for Missy Elliot's and Anastacia's brief appearances- songs that weren't in the film? Oh marketing!)<br />Anyhow...the cast sounds fantastic-who knew John C.Reilly could sing like that? You should absoloooootly see the film first, it will get you more excited about the music, and then you can buy the cd, go home, sing in front of your pretend audience, and no one will ever be the wiser (not that I would ever sing into a hairbrush, mind you :) ).<br />Not to be missed!
0066214122|5.0|Many years ago Michael Crichton wrote the Andromeda Strain.  The Prey, in away is rewritten for today.  Instead of the danger coming from a mutant microbe it comes from a man-made mutant molecule or nanoparticle, molecule size robots.<BR> Most of the story line takes place in a Nevada test laboratory, Xynos Technology where Jack Forman who wrote the original computer code that made these runaway robots possible, must find a way to confine and eliminate them.<BR> Crichton has, in the past written about genetic engineering (Jurassic Park and The Lost World.  Growing up most of us has seen dinosaur movies and can only wonder if man fooling around with prehistoric DNA could actually achieve this.  In The Prey, we not only wonder but can only think how close to reality can nanopartiles  be engineered and cause all the havoc in Crichton's latest, fast moving, can't put it down thriller.  Definitely a MUST read.
B000067DNC|5.0|Je l'aime tellement que je veux le marier!
B000001DVD|5.0|On Through the Night, High N Dry, and Pyromania are early and best efforts of Def Leppard.  All have a metal type sound as opposed to a Pop sound later albums have.  High N Dry has some of the best music I listened to during high school.  Mirror, Mirror(You look into my eyes)  was my favorite Def Leppard song for a long time.  The whole album has an energy  that was glimpsed with On Through the Night, and continued with Pyromania.  If you like high octane, metal that isn't mainstream, give High N Dry a try.
B00000DC10|5.0|i dont even need to write a review for this really.just simply buy this, steal it, download it, etc.this is one of the best albums EVER, from start to finish.when i first got this it did not leave my cd player for 3 months.i cant say enough about this.bring the revolution!
B00005QG9J|5.0|If you're a fan of rock music, this album is vital for your collection. It's probably the best piece of music recorded within the last 10 years. Buy it alone for the song &quot;Warning&quot;. This song is a musical and lyrical masterpiece, and it has a FANTASTIC message.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This movie was put together by the same people who did Saving Private Ryan, mostly.  If you liked that movie, this one is up your alley.
B00005JL96|5.0|I love this movie. It has been a long time since Disney has brought out a well deserved film. It made me laugh, cry and smile. It was a joy to watch. I feel like a kid again watching this movie 5 times now and counting. Stitch is the most adorable creature. My nephews can't wait to watch this movie everytime they come over. One of nephews has Stitch cuddling in his arms the whole time. A Disney movie definately worth watching over and over again.
6305546789|5.0|I know everyone that is in to the horror genre has seen this movie. This movie, by far, is the most suspenseful and scary movie ever released. If you notice, while you're watching this movie, the abscence of blood, guts, and cheap tricks to keep you watching. John Carpenter does a great job of keeping you on the edge of you seat with background music and a story line that was new at the time of the picture. I know some horror fans think that the Friday The 13th Movie was the movie that started it all but that is nothing compaired to the actual fear and suspence that one will watching Halloween.
B00005JL78|5.0|This is an excellent movie.  Tom Cruise has proven to be an incredible actor over the years. He shows an incredible versatility in his acting.  He never plays the same role from one movie to another.  Definitely deserves an award!!!!
B000002A3T|4.0|This is a good album, but along with Pulse, it could have been a lot better without all the back-up musicians, it just creates too much noise that doesnt need to be there. If they just stayed with Dave, Richard, and Nick, and kept the replacement bassist, it could have been a great album.

0440539811|2.0|I guess I just don't get it.  This book has it's moments, but they're stuck in between the stream of conciousness style narrative that runs through the whole book.  I had high hopes, now I just want to finish it and hope EVERYONE gets killed!  I think that it could have been written in about half the pages and not lost anything.  2 stars is being generous. This one is definitely going to the used book store!

B00005JKZT|5.0|After growing up on Star Wars, I was wary of the middle epic in a trilogy.  Episode V of Star Wars always seemed flat and discouraging.  However, I left the theater after The Two Towers walking on air.<br />Simply put, The Two Towers was magnificent.  I battled my way through parts of The Fellowship of the Ring because of the noise, the violence, and the constantly changing scenes and ideas.  You had to get used to so many characters and landscapes and homes and cultures--literally an entirely different world--while at the same time following an incredible plot.  With TTT, however, I truly felt like a part of the fellowship.  I knew the characters, knew their mission, and knew the bad guys by heart.  People may say that TTT has no beginning and no end, but that is exactly how it is meant to be.  It ties in perfectly with the Fellowship and ends suspensfully for the much awaited Return of the King.<br />This movie followed the book fairly well, although I personally was furious over the confusing part Eowyn played.  Admittedly, I like her far better than Arwen, but she was not meant to be so important or personal in the book.  Also, everyone is complaining about Faramir.  My father simply says that Faramir was a spoiled brat in the book anyway, so the same message gets across in the end.  I'm not excusing Jackson for messing up a character, but let us wait and see what he does with Faramir in the end.  And of course Gollum was terrific.  We'd just begun the first scenes with him and my dad (who has read the trilogy 16 times over) turned to me with a huge smile on his face.  Yes, Gollum was perfect.  My dad thought Wormtongue might have been the best actor in the movie, for his small part was so magnificently played that he shone.  Theoden was OK; not strong, but he wasn't supposed to be.  I also thought Sam did a terrific job.  He's so simple and yet so honest and true... and so wise.  The last scenes almost brought tears to my eyes when Frodo and Sam imagine young hobbits asking about their adventures in the future.  Legolas was great; flipping onto that horse is an art only possible of an elf.  Skiing down the stairs of Helm's Deep on a shield was a little corny, but he still did a great job.  Aragorn also appeared as a very strong character, but all the love scenes with Arwen got on my nerves.  His strength and the king within him are unfolding.  And Gimli was wonderful!  The comic relief in such a long and furious movie was welcomed with much laughter all over the theater.  Gandalf did a great job, although I miss his intimacy from the Fellowship.  He is a perfect picture of Christ, rising from the dead, casting out the evil spirit of Sauron (aka satan), and always coming to the rescue in a glory of splendor.  Frodo did an excellent job as well; thumbs up to Elijah Wood.  He had a hard part to play and can never come across as the most colorful character in it.  Yet Wood doesn't seem to care; he is more concerned with acurately portraying Frodo Baggins, and he does an excellent job.<br />Basically, this trilogy is the movie of the decade, if not the movie of our century.  Well done, Peter Jackson.  What about The Hobbit?
B000002UAR|5.0|(If you like this review, read some of the others I've written!)<br />I received a my first copy of REVOLVER on my eighth birthday in 1967. It was the American version on the Capitol label with the rainbow colors which ran around the perimeter of the vinyl's track list. That same day, I fell off a jungle gym and broke my nose: my parents joked that my face was turning all the colors of the revolving Capitol label.<br />I had a week of out-of-school time to familiarize myself with this stunning transition to the Beatles' Mature Years, the precursor to SGT. PEPPER which also is on a par with ABBEY ROAD. (THE WHITE ALBUM, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR, and RUBBER SOUL, though I love them all, are not quite the equals of the peerless three listed above).<br />This CD restores several stunning songs originally left off of the American vinyl version: \\"I'm Only Sleeping,\\" Lennon's lovely nod to lethargy;  \\"Dr. Robert,\\" the naughty man who supplied illegal substances to pop stars and others; and one of my very favorite Beatle songs, \\"And Your Bird Can Sing,\\" with its transcendent introductory riff which resembles a Bach Clavier Prelude Electrified.<br />What pop-music treasures here! \\"Taxman,\\" Harrison's biting satire whose guitarwork burns even today (including that lovely Lennon line, \\"And my advice for those who die? / Declare the pennies on your eyes!\\"). \\"Eleanor Rigby,\\" whose cartoon sequence in YELLOW SUBMARINE captures its mood so well: Paul's brilliant evocation of loneliness in a world of meaningless rituals; the odd but haunting \\"Love You To,\\" George's sitarical meditation on love and life; the drug-inspired Peter Fonda psychodelia \\"She Said She Said,\\" where forever John notes that \\"She's making me feel / Like I've never been born.\\" <br />Oh, yes: then there's \\"Good Day Sunshine,\\" one of the happiest, jauntiest of all of Paul's love songs (I could sing it forever and ever); the heartwrenching \\"For No One,\\" which is almost as effective as \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" in despair-inducement, with that gorgeous English horn playing its haunting coda; \\"I Want To Tell You,\\" an overlooked George gem which captures adolescent love confusion better than any lyric I know; \\"Got To Get You Into My Life,\\" Paul's horn-driven masterwork of celebration and discovey (which of us hasn't been alone and taken a ride, not knowing what we'd find there--\\"then suddenly I see you!\\"<br />And perhaps my very, very, very favorite John song, \\"Tomorrow Never Knows,\\" whose psychedelic sound effects and semi-religious paradoxes and dream imagery and sense muddling are sheer genius: I would swing on my swingset chanting, \\"Turn off your mind, relax, and float downstream...\\"<br />Did I forget? Oh, yes: \\"Yellow Submarine,\\" always a hoot no matter how one interprets it; and Paul's most beautiful love lyric, one of the best ever penned or sung, the simple and evocative \\"Here, There, and Everywhere\\" (these guys harmonized so well, didn't they? \\"Oooh, ooh\\" never sounded so good!)<br />If you don't own this already and you like pop music, buy it now. It always sounds good. Always Always Always. I've listened to REVOLVER for a lifetime, and it never wears out.<br />It is always 1967; it is always sunny; and even though Vietnam looms large, good things are happening. Woodstock is yet to come.
0316666343|1.0|All I can say is it's very slow.  The few parts it where it starts to get interesting, comes to an abrupt halt.  It's defenitly not an exciting page turner.
0375414053|5.0|I completely enjoyed this book.  Although it was an extreme<BR>exageration of being a dual role person,  I felt it brought<BR>to light the situations you end up in and emotions you feel<BR>as a working mother.  Unlike alot of books I have read lately<BR>it has a strong plot,  characterizations, and an enjoyable<BR>writing style.  It is a book of the times and even is somewhat<BR>ahead of its time by using e-mails to tell the story.   It is<BR>nonjudgemental in its message of the right thing to do work vs.<br />stay home.  I especially liked the realism in her relationships<BR>with her nanny and husband.  The english writers seem to be a<BR>step ahead in their wit and have seemed to capture a sense of the times that the american writers have not.  I say on with<BR>the British writers and thank-you to them for capturing everyday<BR>life and making it seem so humorous.
B000002C1W|2.0|Although &quot;The Division Bell&quot; (94) is a great piece of music, &quot;Momentary Lapse&quot; misses Roger Waters sorely. Gilmour attempts to imitate Waters' bitterly ironic and clever lyrics - a big mistake, as &quot;Dogs of War&quot; will show. &quot;Learning To Fly&quot; is a very nice song, and &quot;On The Turning Away&quot; sounds great indeed. The rest of the album, however, is the sound of a band with no direction (probably because it was mostly played by studio musicians - Rick Wright's playing is missed). Do yourself a favor and make this the last addition to your Floyd collection.
B000005H4K|1.0|If people with ears took a blindfold test,would they give this 5 stars not knowing the players.Mingus is overplaying while<BR>Max is stuck playing broken time.<BR>Miles also thought this record at the time was a joke.
B000002UA0|5.0|You want to talk about where punk comes from? Well, throw away those VU records and listen to this gem of an album. Incredible experimentation. Recorded in the same building as the Beatles &quot;Sgt. Pepper's&quot;, simultaneously, the Floyd go above and beyond the sonic experimentation of the Beatles to create a wonderful and enduring piece of music (not saying that the Floyd could come close to the Beatles in musicianship at this time). The only unfortunate part of this album is that it was the only one with Pink Floyd that Syd made before the onset of schizophrenia. <br />What's most amazing is that the songs, apart from all the sonic noise, are great songs in and of themselves. &quot;Astronomy Domine&quot; might be the first punk song ever. From the opening radio crackle to the closing drone, this is a beautiful piece. &quot;Matilda Mother&quot; is infectious pop with great lyrics (and a cool Waters bass riff!). &quot;Flaming&quot; is another great stream-of-consciousness piece. The most underrated song on the album is &quot;Pow R. Toc H.&quot;. The only song that has the noise-jam feel of their early concerts is &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot;, and it has many great moments itself. This is one of the best rock albums around.
B00005NW02|5.0|I love this cd.  Deerdance and chop suey has to be my favorie songs on here.  I dont see how anybody dosent like this band...I have all of their CDs including Steal This Album and i love them all but some people say that Steal this album [is bad]...it dosent.  If you like any kind of music you should like this so get it!!!  I gave this album 5 stars because it is just a great band.
B00005M91K|5.0|...so how can Baraka be a \\"wannabe\\" Koyaanisquatsi? <br />They are two different films taking different approaches on similar themes. One is clearly linear with a clear-cut, uncompromising message that basically dictates your experience of the movie (Koyaanisqatsi), while the other (Baraka) is non-linear, a patchwork exploration of critical contemporary issues that allows you to make your own subjective interpretations on what you are seeing. That is where Baraka's power lies - that no two people experience and see exactly the same thing, that the experience isn't dictated to you.<br />Some see it as depressing, some see it as uplifting, some maybe even see it as a waste of film! and a lot won't GET it. I'm a major movie buff, and personally, subjectively, Baraka is the closest attempt I've seen spiritual enlightenment depicted on film. It will never cease to arouse a sense of wonder at the miracle of All That Is.
B00006HBUA|4.0|We took our 4 and 6 year old daughters (then 3 and 5), and my wife, myself and our 2 daughters absolutely loved this movie. It was funny and enjoyable. Some of the scenes were a bit scary probably for our 3 year old, but she didn't act like it. What can you say about the whole \\"showdown\\" between Shaggy and Scooby with bodily function noises? I was in stitches in the theatre. It had me laughing so hard that I had tears in my eyes!<br />If you're looking for an in-depth storyline, forget it. It's not there. This movie is playing homage to the old cartoons that I grew up watching UNTIL Scrappy came on board. And yet, they even play homage to that in a way I love. For all the Scrappy haters out there, we get our just revenge with what happens in this movie to him. Many people let this cloud their judgment of the movie and hate it just because of that. Well, I see that the makers of this movie agree with the rest of us: SCRAPPY STUNK! He was obnoxious, selfish and just overall irritating! He never should have existed and that his appearance was the downfall of the Scooby series.<br />Each character is VERY believable, especially Matthew Lillard as Shaggy and Linda Cardellini as Velma. And, with me being a Buffy fan, I just HAD to see SMG in this movie as Daphne. She pulled it off great. As for Freddy Prinze Jr., I'm not so sure he was the BEST Fred, but he pulled it off for me, even though his Fred was different from the cartoon in many respects.<br />As for the DVD, the widescreen edition looks awesome. The features on the DVD are pretty good for a WB release. My kids loved listening to the commentary from the stars. The other features of the movie are pretty good as well and the DVD-ROM features are pretty cool. My 6-year-old daughter loved the games from the DVD-ROM.<br />The deleted scenes are pretty cool. Some, you wonder why they removed them, but if you listen to the commentary while watching them, you can understand why that was done and it makes total sense.<br />Now, supposedly this movie had a lot of sexual and drug references in them that were ultimately removed. I was one of the people who wanted those to be removed when I read about it in a newspaper article before the movie was released and I'm glad those aren't included here. Many people would probably cry foul that they were not included, but since my daughters know how to navigate around the DVD features, I would NOT want them to have access to them. Plus, I do not want to have to lock this DVD out with parental locks. Instead, I would want my daughters to be able to watch this when they want. So, kudos to WB for not including those scenes and for not releasing them at all in the theatres. Otherwise, I would have refused to take my daughters to it and they already knew it was coming, so that would have been a total blow to them.<br />Excellent movie, excellent DVD. I still watch this movie and get a laugh. The soundtrack is pretty good as well. I can't get into a lot of the rap and hiphop stuff, but some of it on the soundtrack is pretty good. I would recommend getting that as well. My daughters absolutely love the soundtrack and dance to it until they drop with exhaustion.<br />I would be prepared that it's PG for a reason: lewd humor (the bodily noises section) and Fred DOES utter a derogatory word about women that you hear alot from today's generation, but it actually was something I didn't catch until someone else said something about it. Since he talks in the \\"lingo\\" after being possessed, it's kind of hard to understand and I think for most kids, it will go over their heads. Also, Daphne talks about opening up a can of whoop, uh, mule on someone. It's too bad they couldn't have left those out.<br />Overall, an excellent movie. Fun and funny to watch over and over again. Did I mention I loved the bodily function duel between Shaggy and Scooby? ;)/>Now, supposedly this movie had a lot of sexual and drug references in them that were ultimately removed.

B00005B36H|5.0|This cd is so far in front of the other cds out there that you are stupid if you dont get this cd.  Tool has raised the bar for generations to come and I cannot personally wait for their next release.<br />Best songs on this cd:<br />1.  The Grudge<br />2.  The Patient<br />3.  Schism<br />4.  Parabol<br />5.  Parabola<br />6.  Ticks &amp; Leeches<br />7.  Lateralus<br />8.  Disposition<br />9.  Reflection<br />10. Triad<br />11. Eon Blue Apocalypse<br />12. Mantra<br />13. Faaip De Oiad<br />All in all this is a great cd and is worth buying.  Tool encompasses all generas so it is sometimes a complicated listen but it is well worth it.  Dont let the fact that it is 79 minutes long or the fact that the songs themselves are long stop you from fully enjoying the cd.

B00003CXI1|4.0|This movie is fun, but a bit jumbled. I think they had a bit of difficulty getting everything into the movie they wanted, and they lost some of the coherence of the book's story because of it. However, I would forgive the movie for this, since you still get to visit Hogwarts, meet Dumbledore, and see an owl deliver the mail.

B00005JL96|5.0|Short & sweet...well, maybe not entirely sweet, but he is cute & furry...And who wouldn't fall for a little girl who knows one of the great secrets: Pudge controls the weather. If you want to understand what this means, buy this movie. This is Disney's (first?) best anti-hero. And in addition to lots of wonderful pieces of humor, and some truly imaginative & heart-filled animation, they manage to slip some great lessons into the story, to boot. They rediscovered Disney's imagination...<br />But if you're not looking for the moral of the story, or the beauty of Dinsey's Hawaii, and just want a good laugh, you still want to see this movie. My husband is not \\"into\\" Disney (and I married him, anyway), yet he has voluntarily watched this movie four times, now (and he wasn't tied to the chair.)<br />Buy it. Watch it. Trust me...

0151003084|5.0|This may be Gorey's best work, ever. I buy this story, in every version I find it in; it's hanging on my wall & this year it travels with me, too. They turned this into a wonderful Datebook for 2003 (and you can buy it on Amazon, too.) This is amzingly good dark humor.<br />DO NOT GIVE THIS TO YOUR KIDS WITHOUT EXPLAINING DARK HUMOR, HOWEVER. Do not let the kids on the cover fool you; pay attention to the skeleton in the scarf. This is not a bedtime story, unless you've already introduced your kids to something like Nightmare Before Christmas.<br />But if you love dark humor, you must buy this book. It is a moral imperative.
B000003S0P|5.0|Evidently somebody called &quot;Kurt Cobain&quot;<BR>is on record as saying that &quot;Red&quot; is possibly <BR>the greatest album ever recorded.<br />Does that mean anything to anybody ?<br />Another gentleman named Jimi Hendrix once said,<BR>and I quote, &quot;King Crimson is The Greatest Band in The World&quot;<br />But Hey, Don't take their word for it, listen with the very <BR>special kind of open ears that are necessary for Crimson, and<BR>make up your own mind.
0375414053|5.0|You read the book feeling breathless, you do not have air and all you want is for Kate to have some rest - but does she really want to rest? do you? and what will your life look like if you did? You think that this book is not going to give you any surprises and yes, it is what you expect - you are acquainted with the daily routine - but there is an added value. The book is funny, sad, makes you angry, is thought provoking - and is also able to put into words all the things you know in heart but are often not able to word to yourself (you don't have time...).  These are the issues of all your discussions with your girlfriends and any other women. I think by the way that the book is relevant to all mothers, not just the working mothers. The guilt feeling is a close partner of all of us and is a central theme in the book. I waited anxiously for the ending to see what is - and can there be - a solution. I have to say I was somewhat disappointed. Some of the ending (and also the Bunce case) are not totally realistic, I think that a realistic ending is a continuous struggle with the price you have to pay (your own health for example). Nevertheless I give this book a 5 stars rating because it was so enjoyable, so relevant to me and my friends and so stays with me for a long time.
B00005JKCH|5.0|This is, in my mind, the single greatest Superhero movie ever made.  The only one that comes close is the original Christopher Reeve SUPERMAN of the late 1970s.   The film is action-packed, and yet it has a heart.   The special effects are awesome eye-candy, but are far from the sole reason to buy this DVD.<br />The forte of this endeavor is that it succeeds where so many Superhero movies have failed:  it humanizes a young man who has almost omnipotent powers.   Tobey Maguire is a credible Peter Parker, and this movie is almost more about Peter Parker than it is Spiderman.  The biggest flaw of most Superhero efforts is that they pay too much attention to the hero and too little attention to the hero's secret identity.<br />Kirsten Dunst is wonderful as the object of Parker's infatuation.  She has an adorable girl-next-door beauty as opposed to a glamorous / COSMOPOLITAN cover look.  In short, this is precisely what the film needs as Dunst's character is the symbolic all-American sweetheart that so many of us guys fall in love with in high school - but are never able to actually date.<br />Willem Dafoe is, quite simply, the greatest Super-villain of all time.   Sure, Gene Hackman was great as Lex Luthor and Jack Nicholson was memorable as the Joker, but Dafoe is utterly PERFECT as the Green Goblin.  What's more, as is the case with Spiderman, the film does a remarkable job of humanizing his character as well.  This is perhaps the least comic-booky seeming villian I've ever seen, despite the fact that they pulled the Goblin straight from the pages of a comic book.<br />I cannot say enough about just how well-done this movie is.  The soundtrack, courtesy of Danny Elfman, is outstanding.  The direction is terrific, as is the acting. <br />  The symmetry and length of the film are right on the $$.   The attack by some movie critics that the movie was too long is nothing short of ludicrous.  It had just the right mix of telling the stories of the Goblin and Spiderman, enough grand standoffs + some mini-adventures along the way.<br />The author C.S. Lewis once made the straightforward and yet trenchent observation that one should never critique a literary work that belongs to a genre that he dislikes.   The same holds true for movies.   If you don't like Superhero movies, you're most likely not going to like this one, for a Superhero movie is what it is.  However, if you do enjoy Superhero films now &amp; again, I can't imagine you NOT liking this production.<br />   The majority of movie critics who gave this film a poor rating did so not because it's a bad movie, but because they don't care for Superhero films.  That is their prerogative, of course, but it also nullifies their tirades.   After all, you can't &quot;blame&quot; a film for being of the genre it belongs to.   <br />SPIDERMAN ROCKS!
0066214122|2.0|Crichton labored through this novel.  He seems to relate well to the hero of the tale Jack Forman (Foreman?? One who supervises work.  The way Crichton does here)<br />A good Crichton novel is one in which you can tell he is in love/fascination with the subject matter.  I get the feeling he was somewhat interested in this and had to get a book out the door after his last \\"Travel Guide.\\"  Its good, don't get me wrong.  But compared to Rising Sun, Timeline, or the Great Train Robbery, Prey comes off as work...hard work.  The story has a lot of build up and seems to end abruptly.  Just because he gets together a voluminous amount of information...doesn't mean it swarms together with some sort of collective intelligence and creates a great story. Just like in his \\"Swarm\\" emotion or lack there of counts for a lot.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|This is one of the hallmark videos in Disney history.  It takes the motif of the damsel in distress and gives it a twist.  As is typical, she is far away from home, in a dark castle &amp; imprisoned by a monster.<br />However, the tale does not find its nucleus in her imprisonment, but in her being set free.  The monster sets about to coerce her to love him naturally for what he is, rather than forcing her to find favour with him.  This is perhaps one of the most poignant of all Disney's fairy-tale messages, both for our children as well as the overgrown children (AKA: adults).<br />As is usually the case, the animation is fantastic.  Disney takes us into the fantasy world of make-believe and makes it almost believable.  I liked the songs on this film more than most Disney films, too.<br />All in all, this makes for a big-time addition to the family-friendly section of your DVD collection.  The beauty of life and the beast of existing;  this one covers it all.
B00005LC1H|5.0|James Rivington... is that guy really from the UK?  Something seems a bit off to me - the name, for starters: is that for real?  James Rivington?  And there's the way he kept referencing how he was, indeed, from the \\"UK\\".  Well, in my experience, citizens from the UK usually call themselves English or Scottish, etc, and not UKish. \\"Here in the UK, John Cleese is regarded as a bit of a genius...\\"  Yes, well, here in the US, many people enjoy John Cleese's work as well, but we don't generalize the entire nation as a load of John Cleese fanatics.  Oh, and learn to spell: I after E, except after C.  As for Fawlty Towers: brilliant, the seminal farce of television history, and really ... funny.
0783217048|5.0|I vividly remember the advance publicity surrounding this movie and thinking \\"Gee, these guys must really be comfortable in their own space not to even worry about any repercussions!.\\" I love this movie more so because it was during this advance publicity that my own drag queen brother died; he was so thoroughly looking forward to seeing this movie. So from that standpoint, each and every time I see it, it is quite uplifiting for it reminds me of him. Even more so, neither Wesley, Patrick, or John made a mockery of drag queens but revelled in playing them to the hilt. Of course, the highlight was RuPaul, as last year's drag queen beauty winner, emerging at the contest in a confederate gown! I could imagine the South just having a hissy fit at that! But the movie celebrates differences and is warm. Those who claim it had a weak plot and it wasn't this and it wasn't that simply need to get a grip. This is a classic example of being unable to see the forest for the trees. Of course there are movies with stronger plots, better direction, more intense performances BUT WHO CARES????!... If you want a nice uplifting movie that teaches a lesson that we, in 2003, STILL HAVE NOT LEARNED, then the lesson itself can NEVER be trite. When you forget our differences and concentrate on our similarities, you'd be surprised at the progress we make! This is a really cute movie with wonderful performances which lift the spirit and really does make one think. If you are looking for a literary masterpiece, go get one - this ain't it - it's better - it is simply fun, something too many lose sight of in their quest to appear pseudo-intellectual! Not to mention, the movie has loads of laughs!
0452282152|3.0|I heard this book was good and read it...let me tell ya, it's not what it's cracked up to be! The imagery and descriptions are less than good and the plot line just gets worse...a better read? &quot;White Oleander&quot; by Janet Fitch... so moving. READ IT!
B000069AUI|5.0|At first I wasn't a fan of Coldplay.  I heard the single \\"Yellow\\" on the radio too mucha dn i thought this was a new band that was overrated.  \\"Trouble\\" was released and I liked it a bit more than \\"Yellow\\" but that was it.  I never got into them or heard any other songs.  Then I heard \\"In My Place\\" and \\"Clocks\\" and was blown away.  I bought this on a whim.  I liked both of those two songs, and went for the album.  And boy was I wrong about this band (I then bought Parachutes).  \<br />First and foremost, Coldplay is one of the best Bands I have ever heard.  I am a massive music fan with over 250 Cd's ranging from Pop to independent stuff no one likes but me.  And I have to tell you try Coldplay!  PLEASE!  If you like absolutely moving music with a ton of character, undeniably tremendous lyrics, and musicianship at its best...Coldplay is it.   <br />Politik starts the album off on the right foot.  A heavy song with an mind entreanching ending.  In My Place...amazing...<BR>Other Standouts include Clocks, Green Eyes, A Rush Of Blood to The Head, God Put A Smile Uopn Your Face, Warning Sign.  A Whisper, and Daylight are great songs, but not as good as the others.  <br />Now Onto \\"The Scientist\\" and \\"Amsterdam\\"  I'm probably can say this but if your reading this Download both of them NOW!  You dont have to buy the CD, just download these songs...  Two of the most well-written emotianlly indulging songs I've ever heard.  There mellow and incredible buildups, especially \\"Amsterdam.\\"  And by the way their really sad too.  The lyrics are jaw dropping, and the singing well, Chris Martin is all I have to say. <br />So please check out this band.   Please! You won't be sorry. By the way if they don't win a grammy for this, no one deserves too...
B00005JL96|5.0|This is one of the most bizarre movies I've ever seen, but I mean that in a good way.  The writers managed to take two very disparate storylines and meld them together seamlessly.  The movie opens somewhere in outer space, where we meet a genetically engineered space alien who was created by a mad scientist to destroy everything in it's path.  The creature is then banished to Earth, where it ends up (in all places) on the island of Kaui in the Hawaiian Islands.  At this point, the movie quickly switches from sci-fi action movie to a tender and heartfelt story of an orphaned Hawaiian girl named Lilo who is being cared for by her older sister.  When she picks up the alien creature in a local pet shelter and names him &quot;Stitch&quot;, we find the two have more in common than we realize.  <br />The movie is like a warped &quot;E.T.&quot;  It's the classic &quot;alien befriends earth child&quot; story, only the alien isn't exactly friendly at first.  The movie is hip, witty, and moving at the same time.  It really celebrates Hawaiian culture, and it's always refreshing to see a Disney movie where the main characters aren't white.  And I loved the strong female charaters who aren't waiting around to be rescued by prince charming.  This is truly a unique and imaginative film that is fun for all ages.
B00005JM09|5.0|I have read two of S. M. Stirling's novels based on the world created in the motion picture written by James Cameron and William Wisher, and I must say, Stirling... four thumbs up (if I got two more limbs I'd give you SIX!!!). I would say, Jon (Jonathan Mostow), you should hire Stirling to write T2 sequel because he's the only one that has got the idea whats T2 is alll about. I would come and watch T3 but I'm sure the message about humanity and all that stuff will probably go down the drain instead I'll be awed with the dazzling special effects and CGI stuffs that you'll find in Star Wars if not The Matrix. I had fallen in love with Serena I-950 that Stirling killed off at the end of T2 Infiltrator (sobs!), her sisters are nuthin' like her... at least more human and lady like than any other, maybe slightly better than Lara Croft, but you killed her at the end and left me... in tears. You know you should talk to McFarlaine to resurrect her into an action figure (I'd buy her!) at least open a fan website and named someone near to Kristanna Loken to play her role if Cameron/Spielberg decided to direct T4! As for now Serena I-950 may you rest in peace, hopefully we'll bump into one another in the near future and destroy the human race so that the earth will be safe from us human who had done nothing but destroy it. Beat that Mostow for that incredible idea from Mojo writer S. M. Stirling! I just hope this Terminatrix (rip off!) or T-X is actually Serena I-950 in disguise and ready to pop out from that energy whirlpool, naked and surprise me with, \\"hey, you, I'm Serena I-950, I'm better than that Vanessa the Fembot rubbish!'
B00006EXL5|1.0|Not catchy, not clever. I picked this one up on a recomendation and regret it. ...basically low end emo.
0316666343|3.0|I thought this book was entertaining up to the point where Number 5 is spotted by the killer.  After that it went downhill and was completely boring.  And the Ruth-Suzy exchange... that was the last straw..give me a break!
0517220784|4.0|Sherlock Holmes, the great consulting detective, hardly needs an introduction, nor do his stories need a synopsis. This hardcover edition of &quot;The Complete Sherlock Holmes&quot; contains all the original Sherlock Holmes short stories and novels published by Conan Doyle.<br />As such, this book is the perfect compilation of a timeless classic, for both those re-reading these wonderful stories or those discovering them for the first time. In addition to this, I loved the cover art of this particular edition - it gives just the right impression and captures the ambience of the tales.<br />The only negative comment I had (hence the 4 star rating) was with the actual presentation of the book. Unfortunately, the publishers have attempted to cram all the stories into a 480-page book. This has resulted in an oversized hardcover, with rather small font, and worst of all, newspaper-style columns on each page. Perhaps the intention was to emulate the original format of the stories as they appeared in The Strand in the late 1800s. Regardless, the book format is therefore slightly unwieldy because of its size and is a little hard to read.<br />Despite this shortcoming, I'd recommend this classic collection to anyone and this edition is definitely worth the price.
014028009X|3.0|Helen Fielding has amazing wit and insight into the most basic female concerns in this first Bridget Jones novel.  While most of us--for sure--aren't as obsessive, compulsive, clumsy, or \\"screw-up\\" prone as Miss Bridget, we can relate to her, if even on the most basic of levels.  We modern, young, singleton women can get along without a man JUST FINE, can provide for ourselves, and know that we are much more than just our looks and fat units consumed. We know this.  We've been taught this.  It's a part of who we are.  To see the humor and absurdity, however, in how some females analyze situations to death is a fun poke at our gender.  To see how modern women face the challenge of being modern, while fighting back some maybe not-so-modern ideas, (lurking behind a bolted door way back in our psyche--of course) is a topic that I enjoy seeing explored.  <br />This is a laugh out loud read, that anyone who's had at least one neurotic moment will enjoy.  If you can't stop laughing afterwards, pick up \\"Bridget Jones:  The Edge of Reason\\" and keep the laughter coming!
0141301120|5.0|Charlie and the great glass elevator is a book for all ages.  It makes you think of things that never before came to your mind.  It is the kind of book that you read for enjoyment and not because you have to.  Rauld Dahl uses great imigry and humor to get you hooked on it.  He invents new characters that just make you laugh or make you think if that could really happen.  This book recieves 6 stars from me but i could only fill out five.
B00005MEPV|1.0|I love Star Wars. I hate Phantom Menace, it is not Star Wars. The only thing that has anything to do with the original movies is the title. This movie is absolutely horrible in all aspects. I was in utter shock at what was done to a series that I love. Take the money you would spend on this and give it to charity or buy a homeless man a sandwich, you will feel better. This movie has nothing to offer and after watching this I have no interest whatsoever of watching Episode 2 or 3. Which is too bad cuz I love Star Wars, but this is not Star Wars. It's just a way to make money, and just because this movie made alot of money at the box office doesn't mean it's any good, the script decides that, and it's not wise to assume that everyone who paid to see it even liked it. That is just silly. It was hyped up alot and fans of the real Star Wars movies expected this to be as good as the others, sadly it is very much below par. Avoid this at all costs.
B00005JKZT|5.0|Anyone who thinks that the movie The Two Towers stays more faithful to the book has either never read the trilogy, or needs to have their head examined.  Peter Jackson himself has said that this movie departs the most from Tolkien out of the three movies.<br />That said, this film is amazing.  The Tolkien purists will have a hard time with the departures, (and there are many), but overall this is overshadowed by excellent writing, acting, and Gollum.  He really is the show stealer in this, and for that reason I recommend seeing this twice.  I don't think there are any movies (even Star Wars) that I would recommend repeated viewings, but I think its necessary in this case to fully appreciate this movie.<br />Gollum has been so well crafted and directed that it is entirely possible to get over the fact that he is 1's and 0's, and relate to him as simply another major character of the story.  I found that the first time I watched this movie, I was staring at the edges and periphery of Gollum's character, to try to see the trickery being used, which was distracting.  The second time I saw it, I was able to stop analyzing the visual information, and just relate to him as an actor.  In that respect, Two Towers was better when viewed the second time.  This movie is worth seeing only on the basis of having revolutionized the CG character.  No other movie has come close to cunningly portraying a real physical presence of a CG character, gotten the lip-synching perfect, and having the character be an integral and entertaining part of the main plot.<br />Other than that, there are great special effects, wide panoramic locations, and phenomenal action sequences that one would come to expect from this series.  My personal favorite action sequence is when the Ents lay seige to Isengard.  It may not be a conventional battle sequence, but it is very original and shows a lot of thought to the idea of living trees in battle.<br />I will say that I did prefer the intimacy and characterizations that made Fellowship of the Ring so enjoyable.  So in that case, the first movie is still my favorite, but this one is just as good.
0060920432|5.0|An excellent insight into the human mind.  He helps you realize how to set your self up for more &quot;flow&quot; situations, therefore, setting your self up for a happier life.  A great book for helping one find what truly interests her and how she can discover a more productive and meaningful life. <br />To the reader from Diamond Bar, CA:  Nowhere in the book does Csikszentmihalyi claim to be &quot;God like.&quot;  His theories can be applied to a religious life as well as a secular life.  If anything &quot;Flow&quot; is a way to further explore your spirituality.
B000000OAN|5.0|You've got your \\"IV\\"'s, \\"Appetite For Destruction\\"'s, \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\"'s, \\"Toys in the Attic\\"'s, \\"Slippery When Wet\\"'s, the list perpetually continues.<br />All of which are wonderful, but stalwart fans refuse to acknowledge that most GREAT bands evolved with even better music following their eternally labeled \\"classic\\" album.  With \\"A Night at the Opera,\\" Queen did both; they made a PERFECT album and made even more perfect music as their tragically doomed career marched on to the day of sadness in 1991.<br />If ever there is an album worthy of putting on headphones and clearing your mind of the rest of the world while meditating to an album, surely this is the one.  The leadoff song \\"Death On Two Legs\\" is perfect, with tasteful piano work, as is the next \\"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon.\\" There's so much going on in so little time!  At this point, you know exactly how to expect the rest of the album: there is no way you can expect anything.  The successful diversity of this band is unmatched to this day. The witty personality of Mercury is splotched everywhere, taking an already-greater-than-ordinary-song and putting something to it that is just .... ah, who needs words.<br />It always helps when there's no filler on an album, and every track stands on its own.  This is one of the strongest start to finish albums ever made.  The grade-A musicianship and quality diversity only make the jaw drop more as you hear such unique compositions as \\"Seaside Rendezvous\\", \\"The Prophet's Song\\", and \\"Good Company.\\"<br />Then you've got the simple stuff.  And only Queen knows how to put an unspeakable magic and emotion into songs with 3 (or in Queen's case 6) chords.  Such songs include '39, the compound metered \\"Sweet Lady,\\" and wellknown hit \\"You're My Best Friend.\\" Even the mandatory insertion of Roger (\\"I'm in Love with my Car\\") is remarkably wellsuited for the occasion.<br />Finally you've got the songs written by God and given to Queen, \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" and \\"Love of My Life.\\"  Enough's been shoved in people's faces about those tunes, so you probably don't need any further commentary.  The works of a genius.<br />A good album 1) doesn't only thrive from its singles, 2) has the creme de la creme of both artistry and emotion, 3) has a wealth of diversity, 4) lacks filler, and 5) flows perfectly start to finish, without even being a concept album.  Again, this album passes the test on all accounts.<br />If you are an American and think you like music AND don't have the majority of Queen's albums (PARTICULARLY this one and Innuendo) then you should be mildly ashamed of youself.  Queen never got the appreciation from America that they deserve, people knowing only \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" and \\"Those Sports Songs.\\" Ugh.<br />But it makes sense I guess.  I'm an American, but devote lots of time to everything I do.  Many prefer the quick fix, and avoid Queen/prog/classical music because it demands to much of the listener.  Queen is the perfect place to start for those looking for substance in music.  Indeed, Freddie pretty much throws it at you and you can't help but \\"get it\\" when Queen performs.<br />Get it.
B00006RU5B|1.0|I don't understand the excitement over this and all the hype like it's the savior of rock. This is Tom Morello at his worst, and the rest of Rage at their dullest and most monotonous. BTW, Soundgarden's Kim KILLS Tom if you use this album as a comparison. Only those who don't play guitar themselves would think otherwise. Cochise is the only descent song on the album. The rest of it sounds like Soundgarden, but drained of all musical ingenuity.<br />And I really don't understand those who keep disrespecting de la Rocha in their reviews here. Especially those who say that he held Tom Morello back -- YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. Morello was FAR more progressive with Rocha in front.<br />This corporate merger is an EMBARRASSMENT to rock because it blew so much potential to be something great.

B00006F83Y|5.0|First of all I am the biggest Foo Fighters fan in the world.  I came upon QOTSA from Dave Grohl talking about them.  This CD is awsome.  It is very hard hitting and is a musical punch in the gut.  The radio bits are really funny.  QOTSA really puts me at ease knowing that real rock still exists.
B000002JR8|3.0|Far Beyond Driven in my opinion is a pretty good album and very heavy too, but Pantera could have done a better job.  There are four reasons why I give this album three stars instead of four or five.  First, this album has less melodic songs than the previous releases.  Second, I think the guitars in this album sound so distorted that it is not possible to hear all the notes that are played.  The production isn't great either.  And fourth, there are some songs on this album that are terrible.  5 Minutes Alone Throes of Rejection, Good Friends and a Bottle of Pills are terrible songs and most of the song 25 Years is boring except the last 1 and a half minutes.  The best songs on this album are Strength Beyond Strength, Becoming, Slaughtered and Shedding Skin.  The remaining songs are pretty good.  For any person who enjoys listening to heavy metal with slower guitars and less melody, this is a great album.  For people who are looking for an album with lots of melody and technique, this is the wrong album to listen to.  This is a pretty good album, but Pantera could do better.
B00004VXF2|4.0|this is the only lou reed(incl. VU) record i know to be listened from beginning to the end.no kitsch. no \\"over\\"sentimental lyrics. it shouldn't been heard in small rooms with lousy accustic-better: halls. best music (as neurosis are) to think things over.
B00007E8V4|4.0|this is really good.  i was very impressed, considering this album consists of mostly toxicity rejects.  here's my song by song review:<br />Chic 'n' stu-  this song is really cool.  fast, agressive, and \\"what is this\\" lyrics.  <br />Innervision-  not a bad song.  more serious than most of the songs on the album.  <br />Bubbles-  a favorite of mine.  only complaint is that it is too short.  <br />Boom!-  i like the lyrics to this one, but the music is slightly boring.  <br />Nuguns-  great music.  good melodic vocals, but i don't have a clue what he's talking about.  <br />A.D.D.- wow.  this song is of the 2 best on the album.  i love the stuff he says in this song...very political.  <br />Mr. Jack- kinda reminds me of spiders.  alright song.  <br />I-E-A-I-A-I-O- the music [STINKS]in this song.  but it has some cool vocal stuff.  <br />36- the only song on the album i honestly don't like.  skip it.  <br />Pictures- a small bit boring, but mostly good.  fast.  <br />Highway song- another un-favorite of mine.  as you can see, this is the section of the album i don't like all that much.  <br />F**k the system- ahh  back to good.  this song has POINTLESS lyrics, but it's hillarious, and has great music.  <br />Ego Brain-  really good song.  good in all aspects.  <br />Thetawaves-  i really like this one.  fast, really good music, and makes you want to jump around and stuff.  <br />Roulette-  slow and pretty.  i like it.  <br />Streamline-  my other favorite on the album.  also on the scorpion king soundtrack.  this song has a variety of music styles.  very...impressive.  <br />as a whole, this is of the best metal albums you can get.  these guys rock.  so buy (or steal) this.
B00005OWEG|4.0|My first exposure to this film was the extended version &quot;Apocalypse Now Redux.&quot;  When it was over, I could see a lot of genius behind the film, but I had no interest in viewing it again.  I had no interest in watching the original either.  However, after reading several reviews of the original 1979 version of &quot;Apocalypse Now,&quot; I decided to watch it the way it was originally portrayed.  I'm glad I did.  Since &quot;Redux&quot; is 49 minutes longer than the original, I immediately noticed the absence of several scenes.  However, I didn't miss the added scenes.  &quot;Redux&quot; overstates its point, in my opinion.  I do not believe that the added scenes provided any further clarification or provided anything that we truly needed to know to better understand the story.  I usually tend to prefer extended versions of movies.  Sometimes key elements are wrongfully removed from movies for the sake of time.  However, in the case of &quot;Redux,&quot; I find the added scenes to be more of a distraction.  The original &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; states its point completely and succinctly.  On the positive side of &quot;Redux,&quot; I must say that the latest DVD transfer of the movie is visually stunning.  That's not to badmouth the visual quality of the original 1979 version, which still looks quite good.  Some may argue that you can still watch &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; in its original version on &quot;Redux&quot; since the chapter list tells which parts are new.  That is true.  However, unfortunately, there are no menu options which allow you to watch it in its original form unless you advance to the next scene yourself.  I doubt most people are going to stay glued to the remote control and the chapter list as they watch this movie -- just to see it in its original form.  The original release includes extra bonus footage, &quot;Destruction of the Kurtz Compound,&quot; not available in &quot;Redux.&quot;  Count me as one more reviewer who recommends watching the original before watching (if you must) &quot;Redux.&quot;
B00005B36H|5.0|im going to do a song by song description of this album.  man...this is going to be HARD.  <br />the grudge- the first song on the album i heard...and...wow.  the first thing i notice is danny's drumming.  WOW.  WOW WOW WOW.   8 minutes of...pure wow.  <br />eon blue apocalypse-  oh look.  tool at it again.  putting pointless songs on the album.  it's ok.  it's of the few on this one.  <br />the patient-  and finally to allow adam to shine.  great guitar playing in this one, and as usual, great everything else.  a section in the middle of this song gets a little..boring.  but it's a great song.  <br />mantra-  NO!  not another pointless song!  fraid so.  <br />schism-  first single.  good first single.  a little over played, but some amazing bass playing.  <br />parabol-  at first i thought this was going to be pointless.  turns out it is of the most beautiful songs on the album.  almost a tearjerker.  <br />parabola- very aggressive, but not of my favorites.  who ever you are, who happens to be reading this review, you'll probably like it.  <br />ticks and leechches-  this has VERY good drums.  everything else is only ok, but its great fun to listen to.  <br />lateralus-  this song rocks.  great...EVERYTHING.  it was great that they end their concerts with this song.  <br />Disposition-  another one of the &quot;i thought this would be pointless, but it turned out beautiful&quot;.  slow, but brilliant.  <br />reflection-  my favorite on the album.  it's ETERNAL, but pure...bliss.  i LOVE the bass.  <br />Triad-  a little repetitive.  better live.  <br />Faaip de Oaid-  not a song, just a strange recording of some crazy guy.  it gave me nightmares.  <br />so, in short, buy this.  now.  you're cd collection is crying for this cd.  if your cd collection had a body, this would be it's brain.  you're making your cd collection stupid.  so go.  stop reading this.  and buy your cd collection's brain.
B00005JLRR|4.0|It has been so long since we really got a good star trek film that I was blown away with this one.  The Next Gen cast really hasn't been given a chance to do a good movie.  Some fans seemed to have enjoyed First Contact, but to me it suffered from an early climax.  I guess that's the way Trek writers these days are getting around the five minute ending.  Nemesis was not perfect, but it is, hands down, the best TNG movie.  A new director and a new writer have given this movie some of the life which has been slowly bleeding out of the series for years now.  It could have been better with the back story, which while important to this story, has never been heard of before and feels episodic.  As some have complained, this movie takes a lot from Wrath of Kahn.  I think the Trek II formula works.  I admit that I only saw this movie because of the new writer and new director.  I would have been happy with a new composer.  Goldsmith's music was fresher for this movie than it has been, but a completely new composer would have helped to clean out the staleness from which Trek is currently suffering.  After Insurrection, I had sworn I would not see another Trek if things didn't change.  Unfortunately looking at Nemesis' box office takings I think too many people just said no more Trek period.  Regardless of any improvements.  This is too bad, because I think it will send Paramount the wrong message.  Current Trek has become boring.  Nemesis is just the kind of change Star Trek needs.  I've stopped watching Enterprise.  I will continue to enjoy the parts of Star Trek that I love, and will wait for the day when someone decides to make innovative and \\"cool\\" Star Trek once more.
0525946284|4.0|Although it is not the best one I read by FOllett, I must give 4.5 stars. Some reviewers say that you know from the start what the ending is like, i must disagree.  You may know from the beginning what the mission is going to be, but you will certainly be surprised by the twists in the story, and you will not go to sleep until you finish it.

B00006JDVV|3.0|This is a curious little movie from the director of the X-Files movie (Rob Bowman).  Is it Roadwarrior?  Is it Dragonslayer?  Is it Aliens?  Is it Godzilla?  The answer is that Reign of Fire is a mishmash of elements from all of those movies along with a slew of other sci fi and fantasy clichés.  But Bowman manages to make this patchwork premise work.<br />The movie begins in present day London when miners uncover a race of dragons who have been sleeping for centuries underground.  Jump to twenty years later when the dragons have all but wiped out the human race.  The focus is on fire chief Quinn (Christian Bales) and the band of survivors under his care living in an old castle.  They try to live quietly and out of sight of the dragons, but when the dragons attack, the firemen go to work.  Enter the American Marine Van Zan (Matthew McConaughey) and his troops.  They plan to take the fight back to the dragons and look for assistance from Quinn?s people.  This messes up the relatively quiet life these people have been living and explodes into an all out war with the dragons.<br />Reign of Fire is a strange mixture of Medieval fantasy and sci fi that works more often than it does not.  The story does not make too many attempts to heavily engage the brain, but it is good popcorn fare.  There are plenty of lapses in logic, but the action moves along quick enough that you do not have time to think about things like that.  The special effects are high caliber and the main characters are strong enough that they do not take a backseat to the visuals.  Overall, it is worth a look when you are in the mood for some entertainment that will not tax your brain too heavily.<br />The DVD contains a few extras including a mildly interesting documentary on the making of the film.
0066214122|5.0|Another great work of fiction from Michael Crighton! I highly recommend.
B00003Q438|5.0|You may think that you have seen The Abyss, but you may not have really seen The Abyss.  If you saw the version that was originally released in the theaters (1989) and on VHS, then you have not seen The Abyss.  Instead you have seen one of the greatest injustices in the history of Hollywood.  That was an edited version that cut about twenty minutes out of the movie that James Cameron had originally created.  As it turns out, those twenty minutes are crucial to the film.  Just as crucial as the smile is to the Mona Lisa.  The original edit of the movie deserves only two and a half stars.  The additional twenty minutes moves the rating from two and a half to five stars (highest rating).  <br />The movie opens with an American submarine encountering a strange object moving very quickly through the depths of the Atlantic.  The object causes the submarine, which is carrying multiple nuclear warheads, to crash.  The military then commandeers an underwater drilling platform to assist in the recovery of the downed submarine which rests at the edge of a deep undersea trench.  Military personnel are sent down to work with the crew of the platform and tensions run high.  To make matters worse, the designer of the drilling platform, who is the estranged wife (Lindsey Brigman played by Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) of the platform?s boss, is along for the ride.  In their attempts to survey the submarine, they encounter an apparently benign alien presence.  Meanwhile, above the ocean a hurricane is moving in and tensions are running high between the American and Soviet governments.  Through a series of mishaps between the crew of the drilling platform and the military personnel, an armed nuclear warhead plunges several miles down into the depths of the trench.  Bud (Ed Harris) must then go on what appears to be a one-way mission to disarm the warhead.<br />In the version originally released, Bud disarms the warhead yet appears to be trapped at the bottom of the abyss.  The aliens,who we have learned almost nothing about, show up to save the day.  They take him and the others from the platform back up to the surface and all is fine and dandy.  I remember seeing this in the theater when it first came out.  When the movie ended, I thought it was just at the intermission.  I thought there was no way that they could end a movie, which had been so good up to that point, like that.  But they did.  As I found out later, there was more to it.<br />The twenty plus minutes that had been cut from the original release focused more on the mounting tensions between the Russians and Americans and explained more about the aliens.  This footage also contained the gut wrenching scene where the aliens launch enormous tidal waves as a threat to destroy all of the world?s major cities then halt them in mid-crest.  Without this additional footage, the movie is not complete.  Search out the special edition (which is the only version available on DVD).  If it does not say Director?s Cut Special Edition, do not even bother with it.  This version is almost three hours long (171 minutes running time), but it is worth it.<br />There are many reasons to recommend The Abyss.  Technically, it has few peers.  It is scientifically accurate in what it depicts, and the special effects are virtually flawless.  The story is very engaging.  It unfolds slowly and smartly and takes many twists and turns.  The aliens and their importance to the story are kept a mystery until the end.  And the movie also has something often missing in science fiction, drama. Science fiction in television and movies often tends to be overly intellectual or overly melodramatic.  The Abyss, in contrast, is a dramatic story through and through.  The scenes between Bud and his wife (particularly when he tries to revive her after she drowns and when she talks to him as he descends into the abyss) are among the most engaging I have ever seen in any movie.<br />The movie did poorly at the box office upon its original release, not surprisingly.  It has since not garnered the attention I believe it rightly deserves.  If you have never seen it ? see it!  If you have only seen the original version ? check out the real version!
B000007T1M|5.0|SYSTEM OF A DOWN HAS TO BE THE BEST BAND OF ALL TIME!! the wide range of lyrics and styles they use are always hard hitting and personally I never get tired of any thing SOAD pumps out, its just so fresh! also if you're trying to write a book I often find the four CD's (yes the live one!) and the book of poetry (by serj) to be very inspiring. go out and buy this CD now if you haven't or aren't right now.
B00004YA66|4.0|Frequency takes an interesting twist on the concept of time travel.  Nobody actually travels forward or backward in time in this movie.  Instead, a son talks to his now deceased father 30 years in the past over the ham radio because of freakish sun storms that occur exactly 30 years apart.  This makes for an interesting movie as we see a son getting to know the father he lost as a child.<br />When it comes to movies or television handling the concept of time travel, you have to make two decisions.  One ? does the story set up and adhere to any rules addressing how time travel and the consequences thereof will be governed.  Two ? are your willing to accept these rules.  In Frequency, the rules are that anything that happens 30 years in the past to change events in the future is noticed exactly 30 years later.  For example, when John Sullivan?s father accidentally burns the desk, the burn mark (still warm) appears before John?s eyes who is sitting at the same desk exactly thirty years later.   I found this somewhat annoying, but the rest of the movie was done well enough that I decided to go ahead an accept this.<br />In the movie, John Sullivan (James Caviezel) talks to his father, Frank, thirty years in the past over the ham radio because of sun storms that occur exactly thirty years apart in 1969 and 1999.  John warns his father that he will die in a fire (Frank is a firefighter), which allows Frank to avoid his untimely demise.  This alters history in ways that lead to John?s mother later being murdered by a serial killer.  John remembers both timelines because he was involved in changing the past (another of the movie?s time travel rules you have to accept).  John warns Frank of what has happened, and they work together to follow the events that lead to Julia Sullivan?s murder in order to alter history once again.<br />If the plot sounds somewhat convoluted and contrived, it is.  But it is done well enough and provides for a rather entertaining two hours.  The focus is on John and Frank as they reestablish the bond they lost when Frank died thirty years ago.  Dennis Quaid does a good job as Frank Sullivan, almost overshadowing James Caviezel?s performance as John Sullivan.  Quaid is an excellent actor who has unfortunately been cast in more than a few mediocre movies.  In Frequency, though, he is given the material that an actor of his talent deserves.<br />The DVD version has most of the usual additional features such as comments by the director and writer as well as biographies of the cast.  One of the more interesting of the additional features is a short documentary on the science behind the movie.  It does not provide a completely sound scientific backing to what transpires in the movie (not that you would really expect it to) but it does have some interesting information on how sun storms have affected ham radio transmissions.
0060005424|4.0|After finishing Sabriel, I could not wait to start this one.  It did not take me long to finish it, and overall it was very good.  However, I did not like Lirael as much as Sabriel, who was barely in this one.  But the thing I did not like most was Sam, Sabriel and Touchstones son.  He was very whiny and annoying, and self centered.  He was very off putting and I hope he will grow up some in Abhorsen- which I cannot wait for!  Don't get me wrong, this is a great book, but the characters are not as good. Though not as good as Sabriel, i still reccomend it for those who liked Sabriel.
6305922748|5.0|In 1984, Rob Reiner helped craft this hilarious masterpiece that would become an instant classic with comedy fans and heavy metal headbangers alike.  Reiner directs and co-writes with Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer (all three of whom also play the main three Spinal Tap members) and we get to see the misadventures on the road and a few live performances of the fictional band on the road.  So much could have gone wrong with this mockumentary, but thankfully Reiner and co. hit the satirical aspect dead on, and many bands from the era that this film was made are rightfully spoofed and no matter who you are you will not be able not to laugh.  All in all, fans of comedies or fans of heavy metal music with a sense of humor should more than give this a look.
B000000HHE|5.0|Back in 1987 a newly signed rap act made it into my recording studio with a new vibe, message and attitude.  They began to lay down tracks that would on a daily basis, blow my mind.  These three young artists developed a style so unique and creative that it was aparent that this record was going to change the face of hip hop.<br />In my humble opinion, Three Feet High and Rising did just that.  It single handedly transformed a fetal stage genre of music into a mainstream multi-cultural phenominon.
B00006J3WH|4.0|I really liked this CD. James Marsters and Amber Benson had exceptionally nice singing voices (although James'was a little out of character) and whenever I hear Under Your Spell it always makes me a little sad that Tara's gone. I'd just like to say that I'm a big Buffy fan, but I've never gotten to see this episode (although I have read the fanfic parody Once More All Naked All Gay which was funny). I still thought the CD was awesome! So even if you haven't seen the episode buy (or download from one of the many Buffy fansites) this CD. The only thing about downloading from the fansites is that they are usually missing tracks.
0151006903|3.0|I adored Eco's THE NAME OF THE ROSE and FOUCAULT'S PENDULUM - and hated THE ISLAND OF THE DAY BEFORE.  Umberto Eco's newest novel, BAUDOLINO, lies somewhere in between.  In it, Eco returns to familiar territory:  the Middle Ages and the theological philosophies that shaped the times.  He begins his story during the Fourth Crusade when Constantinople is under attack.  A Greek priest Niketas is rescued by a mysterious man named Baudolino who amazingly knows the languages of both attackers and defenders.  While the two are in hiding, Baudolino tells Niketas his life story, from his peasant beginnings to his adoption by the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick to his quest to discover the kingdom of the legendary priest Prestor John.  Baudolino is a self-professed liar, so his story unfolds with the authority of his voice but also with underlying uncertainty.  Baudolino believes with passion many of his own lies, lending yet another layer to his tale.<br />Parts of this novel are brilliant, but Eco does not seem to know what he wants this novel to be.  For example, he spends a portion of the book documenting the rise of the Italian city-states, finally focusing on one city and its inhabitants with convincing detail and conflict, only to discard it - just when the situation gets interesting - in favor of a lackluster quest to return the Holy Grail to Prestor John's kingdom.  The books covers events that occurred throughout Europe, and somehow (is it his liar's tongue?) Baudolino is always there with his hand stirring up history.  Eco devotes huge sections to war, mythological beings, and long treatises on the theological questions of the times.  He seems to want to cram everything he knows about the Middle Ages into this novel: myths, misconceptions, historical figures, theological debates, politics.  Unfortunately, by not building his story around one or two of these elements, he has ended up with a scattered novel that can be compelling one minute and excruciatingly dull the next.  The motivations of the characters are often weak, although sometimes the characters spring up with unexpected vividness, only to fade away once again.  I wish Eco had spent more time with the human moments of the Middle Ages to give this era life.<br />Despite the unmoored aspect to BAUDOLINO, Eco is at his humorous best when inventing, with details that made me laugh, the origin of several Middle Ages \\"discoveries\\": the shroud of Turin, the widely circulated letters of Prestor John, the conflicting relics that appeared in various early churches, to name only a few.  Several real figures of the times - Zosimos the alchemist, the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick and his son, and Niketas himself - have human foibles that make them rise off the page.  Baudolino's relationship with both his real and his adoptive fathers are poignant in two separate scenes, and his love for his stepmother is convincingly told.<br />This is a sinuously told tale with no constant conflict or other driving force, but one which will please readers who love philosophy, intellectual history, and theological debates.  I recommend this for patient readers who have a bonafide interest in Eco's work as well as in medieval times.  You will be wholly dissatisfied if you are looking for the mystery or conspiracy of Eco's previously successful novels.ext.

B00005B238|5.0|I picked this up the other night out of sheer boredom. Nothing else was on and so I decided to watch Schwarzenegger shoot some stuff up. I'd seen the movie before in the theater years ago and remembered it was entertaining but I had forgotten how good this movie really was! More than just a commando film, the plot to this film is admirable - a commando team (with the Gov. Ventura himself, no less) is dropped into the jungle to rescuse some hostages. Along the way, they realize they are being hunted by the ultimate Preditor. This alien advisary is phenominal and truly frightening. Even knowing the ending, I was on the edge of my seat to see how Arnold with win against such odds.<br />In a day when action films are only ho-hum and the world is without a true action hero to root for (Vin Diesal is NOT Arnold in his prime), this movie is a refreshing reminder of what a great action movie should be.

B00004Z459|1.0|I first heard these guys on MTV (not surprisingly) and all I can say is that these guys are just a reanimated, heavier version of N'Sync. I don't consider these guys metal or even hard rock for that matter. They're just a bunch of metal posers that only little 12 year old girls consider to be heavy. If you want metal, listen to bands like Hatebreed, Slipknot, Pantera, Otep, and the list goes on. When you compare Linkin Park to these bands, they don't even go in the same category. This is an awful Pop metal CD, and wouldn't recommend it to any (True) heavy metal fans.
6303314015|5.0|By far the greatest disney film ever and the most succuessful animated film of all time.  it had it all. great plot , great animation that couldnt be replaced by any computer, excellent character design, the best voice acting for an animated film ever, incredible score, everything that made a film great.  what citizen kane did for movies today, the lion king did for the animated universe.  they raised the bar three times over for a kids film.  somewhere in this time , disney got into thinking too much of themselves and believed everything they did was going to sell like crazy.  they lost the magic and they started creating some movies of subpar quality like Atlantis, and treasure planet.  i wont stray too far away from the movie im rating.  it was this movie that set disney apart from other companies and thier work.  i hope they get the magic back into filming and soon.
B00005OWIU|5.0|the master gets better and more refined with age. How does Williams do it? I am not a Harry Potter fan but I am a Williams fan, and this is without doubt one of his most majestic and assured scores to date. It is a work of art in its own right, an instant classic which will be remembered for years. The quality of the music is extremely high for a Hollywood mass market movie. It sounds like a soundtrack for a musical from the 1960s, echoing Williams &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; and even the great Rogers and Hammerstein musicals of the 50s and 60s. And you get it in the 21st century! All the years of Williams writing music for the movies over the years has culminated into a orchestral sophistication and artistry worthy of the grandest of classical compositions of yore. Of course he borrows certain musical phrases from Ravel's Daphnis and Chloe, not to mention Benjamin Britten (as you'd expect in an English setting), but he goes the extra step to make the music uniquely John Williams. Bravo John Williams.

B00005JLSC|5.0|Like many of the other reviewers, I saw the theatrical version of Chicago. In my case it was in the 70s, but I still recall nearly every word and note. I loved the show!<br />I went to the movie with optimism and skepticism: Would they do it justice? Simple answer: More justice than the Cook County courts!<br />What a delightful ride! Reality and \\"stage\\" were so well integrated, I nearly applauded after the musical numbers. Everyone in the theater applauded at some point! <br />And who knew Zeta-Jones, Zellweger, and Gere could SING? And Gere can even dance. The (much noted) limitations of the cast in the dance department did NOT detract at all, but actually highlighted the fantasy aspects of the musical numbers--\\"real\\" people of limited ability and means showcased in fantasy splendor.<br />Go see it. See it again. Take some friends who can admit to loving musicals. Take some friends who couldn't before they saw Chicago. <br />And if you aren't all humming \\"Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes they both, oh yes they both...\\" the next day...well I'll be amazed.
B0000797IO|1.0|I heard this movie described as &quot;one of the best movies of the year!&quot;  Well, it was by far the worst movie I have EVER seen.

B00005JL96|4.0|The last great Disney film was The Lion King. That was 10 years ago and since we've had multitudes of mediocre to dismal regurgitations of that formula. Though Disney tried to mix it up a bit with The Emperor's New Groove and Atlantis, they still managed to be only decent. Until now, at least. While Lilo &amp; Stitch does not quite reach the greatness of the Lion King and a few other Disney classics, it is still a really good little film.<br />What makes it work are two things: Characters we care for, and new, original ideas. Up at the forefront are the title characters: Lilo, an orphaned Hawaiian girl now living in the care of her older sister, and Stitch, a genetically created alien with no family. Lilo's life with her sister is full of tension, and a child services agent may put the young girl into a foster home if things don't improve. No one is perfect in this story, everyone has faults and strengths, and it's this honest portrayal of humans (and, er, aliens) that helps sell this film. This Disney movie really begins to capture much of the heart that's been missing for the past decade in their animated films.<br />And the music adds the perfect atmosphere to the tropical animation. Using Hawaiian sounds and Elvis Presley tunes, the film uses the right songs at the right moments. And with the laugh out loud comedy in this film (I haven't laughed as much during a Disney cartoon in years), everything comes together beautifully.<br />With Lilo &amp; Stitch, it seems Disney may be headed in the right direction with their animation franchise. Let's hope it continues in the years to come. And if not, at least we still have Lilo &amp; Stitch.
0060537639|5.0|The book is very interesting, and yes, if it were true, would mean that American schools are all wrong when they teach that Columbus was the first to discover America.  I expect that skepticism from Americans...what do American schools even teach of Asian countries?  How much of Chinese history does the average American know?  I'm guessing...NONE.  In my personal experience in the US school system, the only times that we touched on Asian history was a brief period on Japan in 8th grade World History, and whenever Western history involved the East in European and US History in high school (which wasn't even very much and not at all in depth).<br />That's an extremely limited base for Americans to accurately judge whether or not the Chinese were capable of such a task as circumnavigating the globe.  Being Chinese myself, I have access to resources that an average American doesn't have - my parents and grandparents.  They grew up learning Chinese history, so when they heard of Menzies' theory, they weren't very surprised at all.  China was a great power at the time, and they knew it.  The treasure ships mentioned in the book?  Zheng He, the emperor's trusted eunuch and admiral of his fleets?  They already knew the names because they had learned of them before, so they knew that what Menzies proposes is very possible.  The only thing a person without knowledge of Chinese history would recognize, is probably the reference to the Ming dynasty because of its porcelain vases.<br />With that in mind, the host of evidence put forth in the book can be very convincing - such as wrecks of Chinese junks in places far from their Chinese homes, stone markers left by a foreigners in western Africa and other places around the globe.  The book itself is very narrative and easy to get through.  Menzies does not just give you his evidence, he shows you how he made the connections and teaches you a bit of Chinese history at the same time.  The search for evidence is still continuing andnew discoveries are presented [online.]<br />While reading this book, please keep your mind open and if you're the typical American, recognize that you probably know very little about Chinese culture, history, and accomplishments so even if you remain skeptical about the theories, take this as a chance to learn about the history and culture of the Chinese.<br />-matikin
6303913881|5.0|The film that shocked almost everyone is quite fun...if you don't take it too seriously.

Nomi meets Molly (Gina Rivera), a seamstress who fixes costumes at the Stardust and they hit it off.

0140157352|5.0|This is one of the classics, and with very good reason. You should read it because it will benefit you for years to come, and you will always be able to pick it up as a refresher and will find new things every time. Others along the lines of this one in terms of MUST READ include &quot;Who Moved My Cheese&quot; and &quot;The One Minute Manager&quot; and &quot;Illusions&quot; by Richard Bach. They will inhabit your bookshelf for years, reminding you every time you see their book spine of their role in making you a better human being. A couple others that are more recent but seem to me like they're going to become Classics too include, &quot;9 Free Secrets of New Sensual Power&quot; by Clint Arthur, as well as &quot;The Four Agreements&quot; by Ruiz. Each is different in its style and approach, but will become books that you will cherish.

B000051VWW|5.0|Here is what I did: I took \\"Lover's Rock\\" and \\"Diamond Life\\" and \\"The Best of Sade\\" and \\"Seal\\" and a French Rap CD called \\"Prose Combat\\" by MC Solaar, put them all in my 5-CD changer and put it on automatic shuffle. I had this girl over for dinner who I met in a department store when I was downtown shopping. I got some oysters from the fish store, sliced 'em open on the half-shell, cracked open a bottle of Asti Spumante (that's Italian Champagne) and dimmed the lights. This whole scenario was straight out of this book I read called \\"9 Free Secrets of New Sensual Power\\" which is basically some kind of sex-memoir/instruction book for higher consciousness, that is DOPE! So she comes over and I light some candles, we start dancing to all that Sade music and that killer-sexy French rap (that the guy in the book also turned me onto,) and one thing just naturally led to another, just like it said he would -- and that's basically all I can say in this \\"family\\" environment, except that I WORSHIP Sade! She is God's gift to guys who want to get l--d!
0316096199|5.0|I picked up this book after finishing \\"The Lovely Bones\\".  I had read an article that mentioned this book and decided I had to read it.  It was the most incredible memoir of rape I have ever allowed myself to read.  After being raped 4 times by 4 seperate men, I had found it difficult to relate to many of the books out there on the subject.  But Sebold's heart-wrenching account of the rape and life afterwards helped me deal with many feelings I had not allowed myself to deal with before.  I could relate especially to the way her parents treated her when she came home from school the summer after it happened.  It made me feel like I wasn't the only one who went through this.<br />Anyone who has been through or knows anyone who has suffered a violent sexual attack should read this book.  It humanizes the event and gives you a real and rare perspective on how the victim feels.
0312305060|5.0|This was a marvelous novel!  Michael Cunningham is a true master of prose, a master at weaving a wonderful story.<br />The Hours is the story of three women, living out one day in their particular time line.  Virginia Woolf is struggling with a new story, what will become Mrs. Dalloway.  Laura Brown, living in Los Angeles in 1949, is immersed in her reading of Mrs. Dalloway, and struggling with her feelings toward her husband, her son, and her life in general.  Clarissa Vaughn, living in present day Greenwich Village, is occupied with a party she is giving for her dearest friend, a writer who has AIDS.<br />The author weaves the stories of these three women together with grace and affection.  Although they all live at different times, their stories resonate, and at the end, they come together in unexpected ways.  These women are very real, and their struggles, their loves, and their lives are very realistic.  <br />I don't think you can read this novel and not be changed in some way.  I don't think you can read this novel and not look at life differently when you are finished with it.<br />Only one suggestion: read Mrs. Dalloway, by Virginia Woolf, first, before reading The Hours.  It will enrich your reading experience.
B00005JKN9|4.0|A city bitterly divided against itself, where lines between class, race, and ethnicity are as clearly drawn as the streets on an 1862 map of the Five Points district of lower Manhattan. With detailed and meticulous strokes of his brush Martin Scorcese has painted such a scene to serve as a background for his epic masterwork, \\"Gangs of New York.\\"<br /><br />The movie opens in winter of 1846 with a street brawl between the Nativists led by Bill \\"the Butcher\\" Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis) and a horde immigrant warriors led by Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson). The two groups collide in the snow blanketed landscape of Paradise Square and turn it pink with blood, ending only when Vallon is killed by the hands of the Butcher as his son Amsterdam watches.<br /><br />Sixteen years have passed when we next catch up with Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio) who, having left the Hell Gate Reformatory, returns to the Five Points neighborhood to avenge his father's murder. He soon finds the Butcher has aligned himself with the corrupt Boss Tweed (Jim Broadbent) and his Tammany Hall politicians. In a plot twist that would have made Thomas Kydd proud, Amsterdam, with the aid of his childhood friend, Johnny Sirocco (Henry Thomas), conceals his identity and infiltrates the inner circle of the Butcher to become a trusted lieutenant.<br /><br />Filling out the triumvirate of major characters is Jenny Everdeane (Cameron Diaz), a pickpocket and con artist whom Bill has taken under his wing and is admired by Johnny. When Jenny chooses Amsterdam over Johnny she sets the movie's final act into motion. Johnny betrays Amsterdam by revealing his true identity to the Butcher who, in a confrontation with Amsterdam, brands him a traitor, and throws him into the streets, where he begins to reassemble the coalition of immigrant groups built by his father seventeen years earlier.<br /><br />The movie's final confrontation between the Butcher's Nativists and Vallon's immigrants plays out against the backdrop of the 1863 draft riots which pitted the immigrants and working classes against the upper class who with $300 could buy their way out of the draft and the blacks that the North was fighting to free.<br /><br />The film's screenplay, written by Jay Cocks, Steven Zaillian and Kenneth Lonergan is a masterpiece filled with dialogue which is nearly Shakespearean in its construction and made all the more richer by the acting talents of Daniel Day-Lewis, who as the Butcher, over powers Diaz (who in the movie's largest flaw, has nothing to do) and DiCaprio and nearly steals the show. The movie's art direction also deserves recognition, pulling the viewers into a dirty, dingy, dark and depressing world of the lower classes of 1860's New York. Scorcese has gracefully manipulated all of these elements into an impressive epic that explores a little known piece of our American heritage.e 1863 draft riots which pitted the immigrants and working classes against the upper class who with $300 could buy their way out of the draft and the blacks that the North was fighting to free. <br /> <br />The film's screenplay, written by Jay Cocks, Steven Zaillian and Kenneth Lonergan is a masterpiece filled with dialogue which is nearly Shakespearean in its construction and made all the more richer by the acting talents of Daniel Day-Lewis, who as the Butcher, over powers Diaz (who in the movie's largest flaw, has nothing to do) and DiCaprio and nearly steals the show.

0060537639|5.0|For many years there have been theories proposing that China discovered the world before Columbus, Magellan, Tasman et al. Now, following Louise Levathes' ground-breaking work 'When China Ruled the Seas', Mr.Menzies has drawn on her researches, supplementing them with his own material and, using his specialist nautical and navigational skills, has expanded our knowledge of Chinese exploration immensely.<br />15 years of devoted research has produced a hefty book, which is nevertheless very readable, split into manageable chapters and sprinkled with illustrations, with some fine colour plates. The political intrigue and the maneouvring that went on within the complex Chinese court reads like a novel at times. Then it becomes a detective story; piecing together the evidence of ancient maps and standing stones, a realistic and very plausible theory of the track of the 1421 voyage emerges.  However, as others have noted, he does convert some tenuous relationships into apparent fact, but admittedly without the tunnel-vision of von Daniken.<br />Much of his findings are surmise, backed by a healthy dose of extrapolation and hunch, but the circumstantial evidence is very convincing. This is Mr.Menzies forte, as we see apparently useless maps converted into the real thing by appropriate adjustments for currents; then we smack our foreheads and, with 20/20 hindsight,  say 'Of course, how silly not to have seen that before!'. <br />As we have virtually no records from China - the Ming ruler having expunged most of the records of ship construction, voyages made, lands discovered and tributes collected - it is very difficult to establish the facts in the voyages of Zheng He. But some evidence is hard to refute; for example, Chinese porcelain found in South Africa and Australia, wrecks of junks (which could only come from that dynasty) discovered in far-away places...    <br />... BR>A very satisfying read. *****

0440180295|4.0|For a truly surreal reading experience, it doesn't get much better than Kurt Vonnegut's seminal science fiction/drama novel \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\".  Ostensibly an anti-war novel, \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" transports the readers to many different places and times following the journey of the unimpressive Billy Pilgrim.  Billy is a sad, pathetic individual who seems to have spent almost all of his existence just mindlessly wandering from one station in life to the next without much enthusiasm for it or even much interest.  He's the kind of person that, if you saw him walking down the street or met him at a party, he would leave absolutely no impression.  Billy, like many in his generation, served in World War II.  The story (stories) of this novel center on the Dresden fire bombings in the last days of the war and his survival in an underground shelter, the aforementioned 'slaughterhouse five'.  He survived the war, went back home, became an optometrist, got married, and had a life with all the trappings of suburbia.  None of it really seems to matter to him, though.  He would have been content to die in WWII for he did not want to fight.  He was joke to those that served with him in a German POW camp.  Even in his own life back home, Billy wasn't much.  He married relatively unattractive woman because that's what people did.  His colleagues didn't have much respect for him, nor did his own children in later years.  So, what was Billy Pilgrim's purpose for existing?  He seemed to think it was to spread the message of an alien race about becoming 'unstuck in time'.  <BR><BR>   \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" departs from any semblance of normal story-telling formats.  As Billy Pilgrim has become 'unstuck in time', he feels he exists in an environment where, instead of time being one chronological line, it is a series of points that exist concurrently and perpetually.  Billy falls asleep a widower and wakes up on his wedding day.  He may revisit his war experience or go back to childhood.  Billy journeys all over time because, where he's concerned, everything that has happened and will happen is all happening at the same time.  Perhaps it is the influence of the aliens that enable him to think this way, or perhaps Billy is really just suffering from severe post-traumatic stress following the Dresden bombing.  Either way, Billy is missing something in his life.  His journeys through time are his way to try and find meaning in a life where none exists.  It is a unique and existential journey for the reader and one definitely worth taking.  So it goes.
B000003CMB|5.0|This album is less music, and more a representation of our beautifully frail emotions exhibited sonically.  This album is so near perfection that God wept when it was created.  The first side of this album is essentially Duane Allmann's ode to slide guitarmanship, and his intonation and phrasing is somewhat other-worldy (and possibly was).  The highlight of this euphoric enterprise is the extended version of &quot;whipping post,&quot; with its slow melodic segue led by Dickey Betts mournful solo, and the beautiful interplay Betts has with Barry Oakely, the bassist.  Where this album succeeds, I believe, is during the instrumental parts, and not when Greg Allmann is singing.  That is to say, Greg Allmann is a well-suited bluesy singer for this band, one that I find enjoyable, but the strong suite of the Allmann brothers, especially here, is when thier instrumental virtuosity takes over and paints a euphoric musical soundscape.  I strongly recommend this to every man, whether in the throes of depression, or the elation of human joy, for that is what this album thouroughly expresses, the fundamental joy of human existence.

B00005JKZT|3.0|While I enjoyed this second installment in the LOTR trilogy, I left the theatre with significant qualms about this film.  My concerns center around the changes made to Tolkien's story and characters. Apparently, Peter Jackson thought that Tolkien's story wasn't compelling enough in its original form, so he decided to rewrite portions of it. <br />Jackson also made some changes in the plot of The Fellowship of the Ring, but the changes made in that film were relatively minor, and understandable as part of an effort to cut the story down to manageable length and trim a few tangential characters. Here, however, portions of the story are changed wholesale, and plot elements are grossly embellished.   <br />Some of Jackson's tinkering is not all that troublesome.  To my thinking, the added scenes elaborating on the romance between Aragorn and Arwen were not objectionable, since they flesh out a plot line alluded to in the books. Also, the comic relief provided by Gimli does offer a laugh or two in appropriate places, and seem in the spirit (if not the letter) of Gimli's blustery literary character.  The depiction of Gollum as a split personality is inspired by material in the book, and is a compelling realization of this despicable and ultimately sad character.  <br />Other changes made, however, are much harder to fathom. One example should suffice.  In the book, when Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli meet Theoden in his hall at Edoras, the elderly Theoden is tired and doddering, and under the influence of a pernicious courtier, \\"Wormtongue\\".  Wormtongue has been whispering bad advice into Theoden's ear, filling him with doubts and indecision.  Gandalf, aware of what has been going on, confronts Wormtongue and denounces him to the king, while working his magic (somewhat slowly and subtly) to reinvigorate Theoden.  Although (as Tolkien reminds us several times), Theoden remains an aged man after his \\"cure\\", he gains strength, and as he does so, his mind clears and he begins to doubt Wormtongue. We learn only later in the story that Wormtongue was working on Saruman's behalf to undermine Rohan. <br />In Jackson's version, we meet Theoden as hideously aged and decrepit (if not almost unconscious).  Gandalf undertakes a sort of exorcism of Theoden, in dramatic fashion, and in the course of this it becomes clear that Theoden's body is actually possessed by Saruman.  While conducting this exorcism, Aragorn et al. physically scuffle with Wormtongue and the members of Theoden's household.  At the moment Saruman is expelled from Theoden's body, the scene cuts to Orthanc, where we see Saruman crash to the floor. Theoden then morphs into a hale middle-aged man.  <br />This illustrates how a scene from the book that could have been depicted with subtlety, drama and mysticism was turned into a farcical exorcism, with everything except a spinning head and pea soup. <br />An important dramatic element of Tolkien's story is how the elderly Theoden, with a little help from Gandalf, needs to summon the strength and willpower to fight the good fight one last time in order to redeem humanity. In Jackson's version, the exorcised Theoden's continued doubts and soul-searching don't make sense if he has been freed of his \\"demon\\", and don't seem to square with his middle-aged vigor.  Furthermore, the changes create problems with the plotline. If Saruman possessed Theoden's body, why would Saruman need to have Wormtongue whispering in Theoden's ear? <br />There are at least half a dozen more examples of this. While there was much in the movie to enjoy, a number of us are stunned that Jackson was arrogant enough to think he could improve Tolkien's work. We can only hope that the \\"extended version\\" fixes a few of these flaws, and in any event that the third film is more faithful to the book.
078322687X|5.0|Any child or teen of the 1980's (I was born in '82) can tell you just how important and inspiring this film is.  I remember being very young and watching it on television with my brother who is six years older.  I asked him if the whole movie was going to take place in detention and he said yes.  I couldn't believe a movie could make that work, but then I watched and was amazed.  Every actor is brilliant, especially Judd Nelson.  What a shame that Demi Moore was the only Brat-Packer to become a mega-star...maybe if Rob Lowe wasn't taping his underage sexual exploits things could have worked out differently!  Anyway, this movie makes you feel that there is hope for humanity, that young adults of different cliques can become friends...that is until you go through high school and you see how the movies are quite different from reality :)  So here's to The Breakfast Club...the greatest teen comedy of all time.
B00000IQC8|4.0|One day, after an exhaustingly excrutiating day working at the local retail store (I won't say the name, but it rhymes with Shmal-Smart) dealing with insane customers and idiot bosses, I dragged myself to the video store to rent a movie. I found myself in the dollar section, when I spotted \\"Clerks\\". I'd been told many times over the years that I should watch this flick, but I'd never gotten around to it. So I rented it, figured it'd be good for a laugh. Was it ever. It lifted my spirits in knowing I wasn't alone in thinking the retail world was insane. Dante was the guy I felt like I was and Randall was the guy I wish I could be.<BR>It starts off rather slow, and really doesn't start to pick up until Randall comes into the picture. The interaction between Dante and Randall makes the whole picture, and without either one, the entire movie wouldn't have been as much fun. From Randall's Death Star theory to Dante's ex-girlfriend appearing, from the hockey game to the funeral parlor, to the final confrontation between Dante and Randall, the movie is extremely funny. It does drag in a few spots though, usually when Dante or Randall are separated. Like I said, these two NEED each other.<BR>Also making their first appearance are Jay and Silent Bob, though they are notedly less funny than in their future appearances, but still enjoyable.<BR>I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who hates their job or likes Kevin Smith movies. Or both.
B00006CXXU|1.0|In a nice, compact package, the most vile aspects of humanity have been assembled in Christiana Aguilera's album &quot;Dirty.&quot;  In shocking fashion, pure, unadultered sensualism remains the albums core.  The album's forthcoming success represents the irrationality of humankind; my grounds for this statement is, although music is subjective to taste, the songs played here are neither witty lyrically, and their over-produced musical background only delves into the cliches of big-studio production.  Unfortunatly this album will lead to large sales, and sadly, more insecurity in all of womankind.

B00006RIO7|5.0|The recently released film CHICAGO has the exuberant energy to blow open the theater's doors, and I raved about it to every one of my friends for whom film going is a pastime. The CD of the CHICAGO soundtrack is a &quot;must&quot; if you think you'll love the music divorced from the visuals. (If not, wait for the DVD, which I'm going to buy also.)<br />I've already listened to this disk twice, and the cat is looking at me strange as I thump her cat tree to the beat of the music. I plan to plug this CD into the chariot's boom box tomorrow and see how many noise abatement laws I can shatter on the way to the old 9 to 5. I hope residents of those sleepy streets I pass through like &quot;All That Jazz&quot;, &quot;Cell Block Tango&quot;, and &quot;Razzle Dazzle&quot; as much as I do.<br />The CD includes a couple additional tracks not found in the film.

It has over 20 of their songs performed live at their concert in Londong, England. It also includes the Joey, and Sid solos. It also adds the option to view w/different camera angles (one for each member) for some of the songs. All in all this is the best [$$]I've spent in my whole life. I recommend everyone to get it, I guarantee there's no way you can be dissapointed.
B00005R87Q|3.0|Let it be known that I am not a car buff and I know nothing about hot rods, engines, or anything like that. If there were many inaccuracies in the film pertaining to realism in performance and speed, then I didn't notice them. And it's just a movie, so you shouldn't either.<BR>When the movie was released in theaters, it looked like a jam-packed film full of fast action, insane stunts, and awesome cars. That's only slightly true.<BR>This movie is empty! Devoid of action, but in-depth with story (that went a little TOO in-depth for a movie like this. . .it belonged in a not-so-actiony flick). <BR>Let's see: The opening sequence has a 3-minute chase. Then we have a race or two on the streets that is nothing but fast driving. This takes us to the 25-minute mark of the movie. Now watch your DVD's counter; about a full hour passes before we see another major car chase/action piece, and that is the grand home run stretch of the movie - the last 20 minutes. The last 20 minutes should have/would have some great action regardless of whether the rest of the film was packed with action already. A real letdown in that department - it was a big summer movie that screamed &quot;LEAVE YOUR BRAIN AT THE DOOR AND HAVE FUN!&quot; It seemed like the story was paid more attention to, but I wasn't expecting that to happen. It was &quot;OK&quot;. No more than that.
B00007BH5C|4.0|Then you're gonna like this one! My original LOTR cd case is so mangled from overuse it won't even close anymore.  Hey, why don't they make cd cases more durable instead of putting those &quot;collector's cards&quot; in them?  Huh.  Well, durable case or not, this soundtrack is definitely worth your money.<br />If you know the first soundtrack well, and I have no doubt everyone reading this does, then the second soundtrack is like a continuation.  Just picks up where it left off.  This soundtrack is different, though.  It's a lot darker and WAY more subtle.  The first CD was subtle, yeah, but this one features flowing melodies that you have to listen to over and over before catching them all.  You do catch a few of the original themes, but they hardly ever surface.  There are mostly new themes, and you'd better be listening or you won't hear them.<br />There are a few good songs on this CD.  &quot;The Rohan Riders&quot; is  pretty intense.  &quot;Samwise the Brave&quot; is one of my favorites too, playing a bit on with end of the first CD.  Track 12 is my favorite, though.  It's the battle.  Doggonit, it just doesn't last long enough.  Then you have the elvish themes and all that, voiced with Isabel Bayr-- uh, Byrak--uh...whoever.  She sounds almost uncannily like...hey, that reminds me...where's that Enya chick?  She's not featured at all in this CD, which really surprised me.  Being a continuation of the movie, you'd think they'd have her all the way through.  Ms. Isabel does a great job, of course, but, wellllll...they should've kept Enya for consistancy's sake.  Maybe she refused to work if she wasn't backed by synthesizer.  Still, having another person do the vocals didn't make too much of a difference.<br />So why am I knocking a star off?  It just isn't as good as the first.  Though you do have some great melodies, they never quite reach the brilliance of the songs you get on the first CD.  No &quot;Bridge of Khazad-Dun&quot; here.  You probably will be dissapointed if you were looking for the &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot; and the intense, dark bass drums you found on track 6.  This soundtrack doesn't have the &quot;lightness&quot; and innocence, nor the intense, driving emotional passages you'd find on the first CD.  <br />Oh, yeah, and that last song--&quot;Gollum's Song&quot;?  I won't pass any judgement calls, but it just kind of leaves me scratching my head.  I'm not quite sure whether I like it or hate it.  I'll leave that up to the other reviewers.<br />At any rate, &quot;The Two Towers&quot; soundtrack is worth owning.  --Although I doubt the case will get as mangled as the first one.

Giving the movie its due, it is an ambitious attempt to portray the historical events upon which it is based in a comprehensive and realistic way.  This is the SECOND half of the movie.  The first half is a sub-standard, over-hyped, insubstantial, unoriginal and utterly predictable romance that drags the movie out about an hour longer than it ought to be.  It takes the tired old theme of the little rich girl being swept off of her feet by the working-class hero, adds NOTHING, casts a fairly talented actress (Kate Winslet) in the role of the ingnue and an over-hyped hack (Leonardo DiCaprio) in the role of the working-class hero, and overlays it into the historical context.  If you're interested in a romance, there are far better and far more original romance movies available (Captain Correlli's Mandolin, The English Patient, and A Walk In The Clouds to name a few) that you should consider.  If you are interested in the movie for its depiction of the sinking of the Titanic, it is admittedly the best portrayal of the event.  However, do yourself a BIG favor and skip everything between the point when the captain orders the ship to full speed ahead and the point just before the ship strikes the iceberg.  I guarantee that you can easily guess everything that happens in between, and it actually makes it a much better movie.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Fiona Apple is without a doubt one of the most unique and refreshing talents to come along in the U.S. in decades.  Her fusion of Jazz, Blues, Big Band, and Pop is certainly novel and something you can really get into.  &quot;When The Pawn&quot; picks up where Tidal left off and get somewhat more upbeat and evolved.  There isn't a bad song in this CD and you will never find yourself fast-forwarding past any selection.  This album could legitimately be called one of the top 10 of all time, if you don't count greatest hits and other compilations.  For anyone who is a genuine music lover, this CD is an absolute must for your collection and listening pleasure.
6304806418|5.0|Forgive me for being blunt in this review.<BR>I absolutely loved this movie.  I dont understand what you people are talking about? Madonna cant sing? Are you people the same people who think these FAKE rockers/rappers/etc of today can sing so beautifully. I highly recommend listening to the song \\"La Isla Bonita\\" and tell me if she can't sing? While you people are complaining about this not being the play I will enjoy this movie. I honestly recommend that you listen closer and keep your negative opinions about Madonna out of it.<br />About the movie, Antonio Banderas was suprisingly great. And Madonna is an outstanding singer and she didnt disappoint here. It deserved every award it got. I recommend you to read the review Roger Ebert wrote on this movie because it is very true and well written. It is also very historically true.
B00006CXXU|5.0|When I heard the first single, 'Dirrty', I loved it, but figured the CD would only be mediocre. I was completely and totally wrong! First of all, the CD contains 20 tracks, a few being skits, but most are full-length songs. Second, I found myself listening to each and every song on the CD and liking all of them (except the new single, Beautiful). I've never not had to press the skip button with a CD before.  Now, I listen to it at least once a week. It's become my favourite CD, and it's a huge improvement from her debut CD. It was alright, but basically pretty bubble-gum.  In 'Stripped', Christina's started to show a more mature and developed singing voice, and also wrote most of the songs on the album! A definate must-buy for absolutely anyone.
B00005B534|5.0|this is absolutely outstanding. Id say as good, if not better than symphony x. its slightly less progressive and more classical. the classical influences are very obvious and sound really beautiful. the singing and production is top notch as is the guitar playing. <BR>suprise yourself and purchse this cd, it will be worth it. <BR>best songs - second sight, in nomine
B00006CXXU|4.0|I have to admit I was among the people completely disgusted by \\"Dirrty\\" and its video.  I was pretty disappointed by the career direction chosen by Aguilera and RCA.  After all, Mariah Carey's already made some pretty embarassing ventures into hip-hop flavored pop and an overtly sexual image (though not as abrasive as Aguilera).  <br />So I was pleasantly surprised to find that the rest of \\"Stripped\\" is very different from \\"Dirrty.\\"  I fell in love with \\"Walk Away,\\" \\"Cruz\\" and \\"Underappreciated\\" on first listen.  I was impressed with \\"Impossible\\" and admired the rawness of \\"Beautiful.\\"  And in spite of the lyrics, I have to admit that \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\" is competently constructed.<br />Other ballads--\\"Soar,\\" \\"The Voice Within,\\" \\"Keep on Singin' My Song\\"--were less affecting for me.  And \\"Fighter\\" definitely took some getting used to.  \\"I'm OK\\" is a difficult track to listen to, particularly the twisted lullaby-like opening, which makes it all the more chilling.<br />I think that Aguilera has an amazing amount of talent, a great voice, and an instinctive grasp of her skills.  But she's got to break out of the sexualized image to have others consider her a serious artist.  She keeps insisting that she's looking for longevity, and making herself less of a cartoon would be a step in the right direction.
B00004STPT|5.0|There is no doubt that the Gladiator is one of the best film scores, an unique soundtrack, which bringes a new stlye to the world of the filmmusics. Exquisite duduksolos-To Zucchabar-, dry and hard battlemusicscene with an unbelievable good battletheme, and of course a beautiful voice: Lisa Gerrard. Naturally 5/5 is the mark, and some themes, or parts of filmmusic are not in the soundtrack. <BR>Shame: no Oscar<BR>Honour: Golden Globe<BR>Minority Report: the best!!!
B00006RIO7|4.0|I got this CD yesturday and I've been listening to it ever since. The first track is awesome to get you in that '20s mood. The rest of the CD is excellent too, but it's the first track that reels you in and gets you set for the whole CD! The &quot;Cell Block Tango&quot; and &quot;We both Reached for the Gun&quot; are the best on the disc. The feel of this CD makes me feel like I'm back in New Orleans or New York during the 20s (Yes, I know it happens in Chicago), and the whole album is just fantastic! <br />But if you haven't seen the movie, &quot;Funny Honey&quot; and &quot;We both Reached for the Gun&quot; might seem a bit odd to you, you might not understand what's going on. But I won't spoil it, I'll let you see it. It's a great movie and an awesome soundtrack!
B00005JKED|4.0|I've probably seen a thousand movies about cops, and I'll probably see a thousand more. To my memory, some of the best portrayals of cops on the silver screen come from films such as \\"Serpico,\\" \\"The French Connection,\\" \\"The Prince of the City,\\" and \\"L.A. Confidential,\\" or even minor films such as \\"Q & A\\" and \\"Year of the Dragon.\\" My \\"favorite\\" movie cops, so to speak, tend to be the ones on the edge of the law, or the force, or both. <br />There was a fair amount of pre-release print devoted to this film, so of course I had very high expectations of Denzel Washington's character, who's an L.A. street detective always \\"on the dark side of the force.\\" The parallels between Washington's Alonzo Harris and the real-life Rafael Perez (the LAPD detective notorious for his role in the Rampart scandal) are obvious. But what's most interesting about this comparison is the fact that David Ayer's searing screenplay was essentially completed long before Rampart became a synonym for police corruption. This is not just a story imitating history, but reflecting it directly. Ayer drops you headlong into the gutter to smell, breathe, and taste the world that \\"Training Day\\" brings, the blurred line between good and evil. Along with Antoine Fuqua's stylish direction and Mark Mancina's ominous score, this film doesn't just show you the streets ... it is the streets.<br />The story introduces Alonzo in the most effective way possible ... by using Ethan Hawke's character Jake Hoyt as his \\"straight man\\" (and our moral center), so that as we are bombarded by Alonzo's extremely unconventional methods, Jake's reactions are also ours. In scene after scene, Alonzo's lesson is that in order to get crime off the streets, you first have to get close enough to it to make you a little dirty. Not surprisingly, Washington dominates the screen in every single scene, with language and behavior unlike most of the movie cops portrayed before him. Washington invests the character with one part depth, one part smarts, and two parts swagger, with a street-level expertise that is alternately impressive and repulsive.<br />I was somewhat let down by the final 20 minutes, because Alonzo is suddenly made into an irredeemable villain, which cheapens the character, and we are supposed to accept what becomes of him at face value. Such a giftwrapped ending is in keeping more with Hollywood's peculiar white hat/black hat moral tradition rather than the harsh realities preached by Alonzo throughout the film. It looks like an ending decided in the production office rather than on the keyboard. A more ambiguous ending would have been more explosive in its own way, and I suppose that's why the break is so clean.<br />Denzel Washington's second Oscar is well deserved. Alonzo Harris is one of the most unforgettable movie cops I've ever seen. The moral here, if there is one, is that even a blurred line can be crossed.
B00006L7MR|5.0|I hadn't heard this album in about 8 years. I remembered it rocked. When I found out it had been remixed for surround I had to have it.<br />Elliot Scheiner has done it again. His surround mixes tend to be ambitious and creative. Rather than using them for mere reverb and ambience, he treats the rear channels as equals to the fronts, often placing some instruments and background vocals in the rear only. This results in a half &quot;middle of the band&quot; half &quot;etherial, otherworldly&quot; kind of sound. Many audio enthusiasts and members of the audio press like to diss this approach, and I used to until I heard it for myself for the first time on The Eagles: Hell Freezes Over DVD. The mix on Automatic for the People is a bit more understated than Hell Freezes over, and it's very artfully done. I see nothing sacred about the concert hall, especially for this type of music. Especially on track 4, &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot;. I remembered this as being a depressing song, until I heard it again and listened to the words. As I am currently going through a divorce, I can relate to this song very well, and I felt as if Micheal Stipe and company had come to my house, set up their instruments and played this heartfelt balled just for me, beckoning me to carry on.<br />I don't currently have a DVD-audio player, but the DVD-video compatible Dolby and DTS 5.1 tracks sound first rate, particularly the DTS tracks which I recommend if your equipment can do it.<br />If you've ever had even a casual interest in R.E.M. or late 80's/early 90's alternative rock, this disc should be part of your collection.
B00006RIO7|4.0|Amazing!!  Other then the last two tracks (which aren't bad just merely don't fit). It is an incredible companion to an outstanding movie.  Both (film & CD) are very highly recommended!
B00001ZWBQ|5.0|I watched this performance with my husband and his parents and we all were tapping our feet, singing out loud and smiling from ear to ear.  It was great to see the 3 brothers still singing their hearts out and so gracious to their fans.  I was amazed when they showed the thousands of people in the audiance of ALL ages, having the time of their lives.  My husband and I were singing the various lyrics for days!  I would highly recommend this purchase. ...
B000069AT7|5.0|I'm tired of seeing generic E.T. DVD reviews on this site when this page is specifically about the deluxe &quot;Ultimate Gift Boxed Set,&quot; which I decided to purchase instead of the standard 2-disc set available everywhere.  Personally, I feel that this jumbo set is well worth the extra price.  In addition to the little &quot;collectible&quot; film negative included in the truly deluxe packaging, you get a fantastic hardcover book which does contain the entire screenplay and much, much more.  It has a ton of behind-the-scenes photographs and trivia that I never knew, and although it's a small book size-wise, it's got a coffee-table-book-sized amount of information and photographs.  Then, there's the discs itself.  Anyone who tells you that the 2-disc set is exactly the same as the 3-disc set is a liar or very confused.  This 3-disc set has the full length documentary &quot;The Evolution and Creation of E.T.&quot;  The version of this on the 2-disc set is highly edited due to space requirements, but the entire documentary is included here.  All in all, this set is organized better.  You open the big blue book and take out the certificate of authenticity, the film negative, and the book, and then there's a big silver box set (along the same lines as an X-Files or Star Trek season set) which has 4 discs: the original feature, the new version, a special features disc, and the original remastered soundtrack.  Wow, all this in a case that won't come apart when you try and take the security labels off!  Don't get me wrong, I am not a HUGE E.T. fan, but I am someone who enjoys the film, wanted to own it on DVD, and tried to make the BEST choice.  Spend the extra money, and you'll see that it really is worth it.  Get it while it's still available...
B00005J73X|5.0|I was not a big fan of Bon Jovi until I heard to this album, which is great, really great. All the songs are good. Buy it, and listen to it again and again!
B00000IQC8|1.0|Probably the most &quot;slacker&quot; movie of them all, with its awfully smudgy pseudo-realistic b/w look, it nevertheless doesn't hold true to the feel of self-imposed reality. The characters are simply unbelievable, with all sorts of zingers/puns/&quot;wits&quot; filling their speeches to the brim(and they speak in COMPLETE and grammatically CORRECT phrases, only filled with F-word here and there as if to make them sound natural), proving over and over again that Kev Smith is a shame of the slacker generation cinematographers.
B0000039PW|3.0|Ok the title of my review was pretty lame but o well live with it!!  Anyways I didn't recently get this album I have had it since....awhile!  And it's a good cd.<br />But this cd lacks.  I just think that is P. Diddy or Puff Daddy just made bad production.  None the less Biggie is on top on all his rhymes on this cd.<br />Is this cd worth getting?  Sure, why not?  It makes a nice collection to the cd's in your car of course don't play it in there.......because it doesn't do good with sub woofs.  That is just me though! hehe<br />Anyways this album was Biggie's first and cd's are like Baseball cards.  If you like Cd's just collect them.  This is Biggie's Rookie album maybe it will be worth something some day.  It makes a nice collector's item and it's a pretty good cd.  Get it!  Peace!
B00006CXXU|5.0|Although many mock the fact that Christina Aguilera dresses trashy, no one can deny this girl has one of the best voices of this generation. She has great vocal ranges, and I love the fact that on her \\"Stripped\\" CD she has dance songs, ballads, and r&b/rock tunes and can beat out any other diva in a heart beat. I am personally not a big fan of Christina but this CD is definitely one of her greatest yet. Let her dress how she wants, let her love life run it's course neither of those should over run our opinion on her talent. It's strange that people would \\"hate\\" this CD and start mentioning how she dresses, which has nothing to do with her music...only her life which -- is none of our business. I believe that \\"Walk Away\\" was her strongest vocal performance on this album and by far the best song but not far from it would have to be \\"Beautiful\\", thats just my two cents. We just need to getover watching these celebrites and just listen to the CD's.
B00002R0MC|5.0|This is a fantastic box set of a fantastic and singular artist. Well laid out, great selections, great music. It really is one of the best box sets I own. The Stevie Wonder box set comes close, but so much of the last disc is [bad]. It has as much quality as the Led Zep 4 disc set. There is no filler on these discs. Each track is vital to the understanding of the evolution of an artist. <BR>An absolute essential to anyone who loves music.
B00005JLF5|5.0|Okay, everyone else who wrote a review said that DS9 is the best Trek series ever, so I won't bother saying it again (even though I kinda just did!).  Character depth, story arcs, darker premises, great drama...it just rocked.  However, this review is for the DVD box of the First Season.      The first season, as with any Trek series, is a bit iffy.  There are good shows and bad shows, the characters are still being explored both by the writers and the actors, the massive guest cast that made DS9 such a thick, rich series is mostly not in place yet (although some of them are introduced this season).  So go into it keeping this in mind.  There are the usual exaggherated \\"personality\\" stories as well.    But there are a couple of reasons to get this set.  First of all, you get to see the ground work that is laid for later seasons, both in terms of character development and story development.  Plus, there are some cool guest appearances, like Q, Lurhsa and B'etor, and Vash.    Second, even though the stories are uneven, the series begins and ends with three of the strongest episodes of the series.    \\"The Emissary\\" does a great job of introducing the viewer not only to the characters and personalities that make up the station's crew, but also introduces the strange, mystic-driven Bajoran culture, the plight of the Bajoran people in the wake of the Cardassian occupation, and the prejudices that exist between the two.     Then, the final two episodes are absolutely indispensible.  \\"Duet\\" is incredibly gripping, and possibly the best script Nana Visitor was given (she still names it as her favourite episode from the series).  Kira has to confront her prejudices face to face, literally, and finds that they even in the midst of racial hatred, there is room for compassion.  Then, \\"In the Hands of the Prophets\\" is a very real and strong tale of religious tolerance, and the lengths that people will go to to defend their beliefs.  It's sort of a science vs. religion, \\"Creatismvs. Evolution\\" type of conflict.  Very startling.      Basically, while season one isn't the strongest DS9 ever offered, it does show very clearly the sort of values and style of storytelling that grew into what became, for me, some of the best television happening at the time.  Wait'll Seasons 6 and 7 come out:  That is Trek at it's absolute best.
0066214122|4.0|For a summary of the plot, read the editorial reviews above.  Below is analysis, and there are no spoilers.  However, if you haven't read the book, please avoid some of these other reviews, as one actually ruined the end of the book for me.  As a hint to other reviews: DONT INCLUDE SPOILERS IN YOUR REVIEWS, EVEN NEGATIVE REVIEWS, UNLESS YOU WARN THE READER FIRST!<br />Down to the meat of it:<br />Crichton is at it again with the formula that worked in Jurassic Park, Sphere, Timeline, and his other science fiction titles.  The formula is different for his political thrillers like Disclosure and Airframe, but I digress.<br />Prey follows the \\"plan\\" to the letter, dealing with the familiar themes of arrogant scientists who manipulate nature and are forced to pay the price when they are isolated from help and have to confront the \\"evil\\" face-on.  Crichton writes well, as always, and his prose is easy-to-understand and clear to follow.  As always, he has researched everything related to the content (including, I'm sure, a few baby books to better understand the life of an at-home husband).<br />The only down side to this novel, other than the standardized plot mold (same plot, different technology) is the awkwardness with which he exposes the scientific principles behind the plot.  He does the best a person could considering the amount of information that he is exposing, but instead of saying \\"maybe I should exposure less trivial information\\", he insists on going into detailed paragraphs about technologies that have nothing to do with the plot of the story.  His description of the processing facility is awkward, appearing as an explosion of information that I skimmed over before getting back to the meat of the novel.  In other words, his exposition is awkward, but its not worth ignoring the book over it.<br />On the plus side, Crichton does his homework, delivers great suspense, and always writes some nice characters that we grow to care for.  Plus his exposition rate iswell-timed, keeping our interest while we uncover one piece of the puzzle at a time, and his end-of-chapter discoveries make it hard to put the book down without stopping mid-chapter.<br />The other thing that I love about his fiction is the cinematic aspects of it.  His later books appear written as if the rights are already sold to a motion picture studio (in most cases they are).  Scenes are light and quick, the characters have started an annoying habit of spouting one-liners, and everything wraps up nicely in a very visual climax.<br />This critique has turned more into a criticism of Crichton in general (he's still my favorite author though!), but most of it applies specifically to Prey, which is worth the read.
B00005U11Z|5.0|This DVD is of great sound and picture quality.<br />It really feels like your at the concert,,if you<br />have a good sound system hooked up to your TV..<br />Then this DVD is one of the best...Must have.
B00005JLSC|5.0|The stage-to-film transition for Fosse's \\"Chicago\\" has been many years in the making, but it was definitely worth the wait.<br />It's interesting to me that while I don't particularily care for Catherine Zeta-Jones OR Rene Zelleweger, I think they were both fantastic in their roles in this film, as was Richard Gere.  Impressive that, similar to Evita (Madonna's version) and Moulin Rouge, all of the principal actors did their own vocals.  While they're not going to win any Grammy's for best vocalists, they all did very well.<br />I won't recap the story, but for anyone who enjoyed the stage version of this film (as I did - saw it twice) and/or enjoys a movie/musical, this film is a must-see.  If you want the soundtrack, though, I'd recommend the original broadway cast recording.
0966638328|5.0|I really love this book.  <br />What it IS: This is a lovely little book filled with colors, color combinations, moods, visuals, designs, ideas, and more color, color, color! I find it sparks reactions, starts dialogue, and fuels creativity for myself and for my clients.  As a professional designer, I find this is great to use with clients to help them get VISUALLY into the their project so I can get out of them the things I need to create and produce an effective product that pleases the client AND fulfills its function.  I also leave it out on the coffee table in my lounge (with my portfolio) so clients can look at it and they do.  <br />What it is NOT: This is not a book about color theory or color management. Although it includes some basic text about how different colors are supposed to convery different things in the marketing and communications world, which may be somewhat useful on some ocassions, color can be so subjective to the individual, the culture, the times, that I wouldn't follow the text as absolute.<br />Recommended? Yes, if you want a fun, inspiring and useful little book that is also lovely to look at and helpful to share with your clients.
B00006V9A0|5.0|Im only 13 years old and I was 4 when Kurt Cobain commited suicide. I LOVE this CD unbelievably so and Nirvana is my favorite band.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne can certainly make a good rock record that would lift you six feet off the ground. As for me, I really love this CD; I never get bored listening to her, on the contrary, you'd simply fall in love with her music by every repeated listening. My favorites are \\"Losing Grip\\" and \\"My World\\", though I think all songs are all just as excellent.<br />I believe this album would appeal to guys a lot; it has already carried me away. Finally I've found a good female voice that I can enjoy listening to.<br />So, to all you guys out there: throw Britney Spears in the trash and rock along to Avril Lavigne instead! You'd love her more than all the Britney clones in the world!
B00000JLWW|5.0|that was definitly the main reason i went to see the movie, the thought i had in my mind when it was starting was &quot;wow, leo, can't wait to see his acting...&quot; i had seen him in &quot;romeo and ju liet&quot;, and he definitly was a charmer, so i HAD to see this 3+ hour movie, the more leo the better right? but the thing that surprised me was how my mind wasn't totally on the love story, which is usually the thing with  me when it comes to love stories, but this time i was amazed at the script, at the adaptation of the horrific day, and just the fact that they actually build the HUGE ship, doesn't that amaze anyone? all the actors were amazing, and it wasn't one of those sappy ending things. it was different. so if you haven't see it, i would recommend it, it is PG13, but keep in mind there is brief nudity.. so go see it if you haven't, you dont know what you're missing!
B000002KLP|5.0|Raw, stripped, in your face, and straight to the point.<BR>It's great. What more do u need to know. I truly defines the beginning of the 80's: Reagan, incest, sex, bi-sexuality, heartbreak, and war.
B000002KDW|4.0|This would be my first music review.  I normally review books.  However, I felt absolutely compelled to comment on this record due to what I have read elsewhere about this record.  It is suggested that Ronnie Lane (concerning whom there is a veritable cottage industry of hagiography) is the real star here.  I am writing to take issue with this, and perhaps restore some balance to this discussion.<br />There is no question that this is a brilliant record.  I acquired a CD version of it just the other day -- not having listened to it for, ohh, a good 25 years (why I allowed THAT to happen I don't know).  But it is also an uneven record.  And the Lane tracks are, well, it has to be said, a little shapeless and pedestrian -- none of them have risen above their milieu to become recognised as standards - even Debris which is touted as his work of genius.  And while in his day his vocals were revered, I do not believe they have stood the test of time.  His voice (and I am sure I will be pilloried for this) is, in retrospect, like so many others.  I think the test of this is whether non-devotees coming to this record will be impressed with either his writing or his singing.  In my own admittedly unscientific testing, they are not.<br />Now it is a given that some people have to be dragged kicking and screaming to listen to a record that involves Rod Stewart -- these are the people who know nothing about his early career.  And here, the proof is in the pudding. Many of these people actively despise him.  But try this, I did.  Try slapping on \\"Too Bad\\" or \\"That's All You Need\\".  (Or ANYTHING from \\"Every Picture Tells a Story\\"). Watch the eyes widen.  Then comes the epiphany and the conversion.  From that point on they will buy everything he ever sang on in the late sixties and early seventies.  But you won't find them running to the Ronnie Lane bins.<br />The truly jaw dropping tracks on \\"Nod\\" are not Lane's.  They are &quot;Stay With Me&quot;, &quot;Too Bad&quot; and &quot;That's All You Need&quot;.  All of them sung by Stewart, who's power on this record truly astonishes.  And DO NOT forget that this record was released in the same year as the legendary &quot;Every Picture Tells a Story&quot;.  Rod was working over time.  Woods' guitar work is almost out of this world on some of the tracks on this record.<br />This is also NOT a five star record.  Please.  Five stars means, what...perfect?  And This is by no means a perfect record.  But it IS extremely good and it deserves a place in the collection of everyone who loves to rock.  You will very be happy you bought it.hat's All You Need&quot;.  All of them sung by Stewart, who's power on this record truly astonishes.

B00006RIO7|5.0|Chicago, the film, is something wonderfully devilish and fun. The musical numbers are an extraordinary combination of dance and singing that you can't possibly tear your eyes away from. The soundtrack, unlike most musical films, stays true to this formula. The songs are left in their original state and not tampered with, something I know I disliked with the Moulin Rouge soundtrack. The first number (or song) makes you wish you had a movie ticket to see this acted out by Catherine Zeta-Jones. It's a hot number accompanied by an overture that's just marvelous. Zeta-Jones' singing chops blow you away. As Velma Kelly she smolders and struts her stuff and these things are palpable on the soundtrack as well. Rene Zellweger's Roxie Hart is confection fun and her singing voice is pretty ok for never having done it before. Richard Gere's slimy lawyer Billy Flynn has wonderful numbers and executes them accordingly. But by far Zeta-Jones' voice boasts the most. John C. Reilly's \\"Mr. Cellophane\\" shouts a surprising voice. And Queen Latifah's hot number (\\"When You're Good to Mama\\") as Matron \\"Mama\\" Morton, is so hot you get chills. A plus for fans, a number with Zeta-Jones and Latifah is on this as well. It's reasons for being left off are obvious (they wanted to keep the PG-13 rating) but its good range and scale is delicious. Zellweger's songs are fun and playful and well executed. The reason I would give this album a 4  instead of 5 is for the two \\"pop\\" songs tacked on the end in gross fashion. As an appeal to teenagers in the target demographic. These songs are ridiculous and should've been left off. Other than that, this soundtrack is true to the movie, truly worth all the stars in the universe.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Aaaaaamazing. Everything about it. Richard Kelly is a god and I am stoked to see what he comes up with next.
B00005V1Y0|4.0|If you like dry satire and are a fan of Waiting for Guffman and Best in Show, don't let the title scare you off. I love how colorful and fun the movie is in addition to the humor and music.
B00007BH5C|5.0|Being a major Tolkien fan (and a violinist) what am I supposed to say about such an amazing soundtrack? The music is amazing, though noticeably darker than the Fellowship of the Ring soundtrack. While the Fellowship has the &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot; theme to brighten even the darkest of songs, there is no cheery melody wandering throughout Mount Doom. <BR>My absolute favorite song on this soundtrack was &quot;The Riders of Rohan,&quot; with an AMAZING AMAZING violin melody. This theme echoes throughout the movie/soundtrack, and it makes my spine tingle every time I hear it. (On a side note, it starts on an A, if you feel the need to play in on whatever instrument.)<BR>The only song I thought the CD could do without is Gollum's Song. What an obnoxious song! I mean, May it Be was torchy enough, though I liked it a lot. Gollum's Song just sounds whiny.<BR>Overall, a brilliant piece of composing.<BR>But then again, what did you expect?
B00005JL96|5.0|My 4 year old son and I love watching this movie together.  It is short, fun and snappy.  The music is outstanding.  Also, I am so glad to see beautiful big thigh-ed girls (nani and Lilo).  Any move away from the Princess Collection look is good for girl's self esteem.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|WOW! I got this for my AFI 100 Best Films collection and this by far is one of my favorites. Kids will love this for the same reasons we and previous generations did. And adults and film buffs will love it for the sheer volume of extras that this DVD comes with. It's almost as if the movie is secondary! There is so much here it even comes with a guided tour which I highly recommend taking. Before you do that though, leave the disc on the main menu screen for awhile. The Magic Mirror will let you know what he thinks about you taking your time!<br /> This is also a great way to introduce your kids to Walt Disney as he is clearly throughout the entire DVD. Hopefully they will be as entranced as we were. The &quot;Disney Through the Ages&quot; is my favorite featurette. It takes you decade by decade from the year Snow White was released until the year 2000. You have the option to play each separately or all together. This even has deleted scenes and songs from over 60 years ago!<br />Kudos to the Mouse for the time and effort on a format for much a beloved film! Get this while it lasts.
0553382179|5.0|I didn't think there was ANY hope for me.  I've been chronically sloppy all my life - I love to buy, and hate to get rid of things - but it's been even worse lately since I've been so tired with mono, and am still trying to keep up with my two little boys.  But I signed up on flylady.net and started getting the e-mails, and they inspired me enough to get this book as well.  Amazingly, my home is cleaner and more orderly than it was before I got sick!<br />One of Flylady's mantras is that &quot;You can't organize clutter.&quot;  So I took that to heart, and am slowly (babysteps!) getting rid of everything in my home that doesn't bring a smile to my face.  So far I've gotten rid of hundreds of books, boxes of toys, and all kinds of impulse buys that I had to have but never got around to using.  With the gentle and understanding encouragement from Flylady, I'm beginning to understand my REASONS for doing these things in the first place, and thus am more able to let go of them.<br />I would, without hesitation, recommend this book to anyone - but especially anyone who has a hard time getting on top of things and has to sort through piles of paper or STUFF to find what they need.  This book will change your life!
0780631684|5.0|Yes, this movie is gimmicky; yes, the characters are thin. But although I'll admit to the myriad flaws, I still say \\"Final Destination\\" is more unique and imaginative than the proverbial 99% of horror flicks out there--if you can even call it horror, seeing how there's no \\"evil\\" component in the story. How many other films can you think of entirely based around accidental deaths? Well, perhaps several, but not recently! What we have here most closely resembles a drawn-out installment of \\"The Twilight Zone\\", which makes sense considering that the director (James Wong) and screenwriter (Glen Morgan) worked on some of the better \\"X-Files\\" episodes.<br />It is definitely a teen movie, just not the kind with cliches about popularity, college plans, the rich kid's sexpot mom--you know, the usual Hewitt-Gellar-Holmes tripe. Also it's refreshingly devoid of sentimentality (originally there was a full-blown \\"romance\\" bit, pared down for the final edition and stuck in the DVD's deleted scenes). I predict the most jaded viewer will find something to like, particularly since there aren't any ghosts/serial killers and the plot follows a more-or-less \\"realistic,\\" albeit Rube-Goldbergian, path. The young cast does a great job, best of all Sawa who has you rooting for him from the beginning.<br />The flaws: the director has managed to make a lot of amateurish calls (lame moments of soliloquy; somewhat laughable encounter with a scary mortician; telegraphs some deaths too early; and a clever ending that nevertheless feels totally tacked on). There's a minor pacing problem, with most of the grisly/cool stuff happening in the first half. Overall it's well-written, yet they did miss some opportunities (e.g. Ali Larter's character--mysterious at the beginning, but too obviously \\"good\\" and not sinister enough; otherwise it would be more fun wondering why's gotten involved with \\"Stan\\" & friends in the first place).<br />None of this ruins the experience because director Wong clearly has asense for good storytelling and keeps it moving. The effects are of course important here and they don't disappoint.<br />Somehow I completely missed the theatrical release but after catching the \\"Coming Soon To Video\\" trailer on another rental I vowed to see it. Certainly one of the most under-looked films of 2000, on grounds of pure enjoyability.
B00005LMWI|5.0|OK,so Karma has been out about a year and a half and you probably have it, so why am I writing this review? Because there are people out there who procrastinate aren't there? Well if you're a procrastinator, SHAME ON YOU! This is not only Kamelot's finest offering to date, but one of the top five albums of the genre of this century (so far of course). I won't bore you by disecting this album (several other reviews do that), but I would like to say the improvment of this band, centered around guitarist Thomas Youngblood and singer Roy Khan, has been nothing but phenomenal. You really do owe it to yourself to get this album. I imagine they'll have to allow six stars for the next one.

0380778556|5.0|When the very young, unsophisticated and nameless heroine of Daphne Du Maurier's \\"Rebecca\\" happily turns over the ideas that she will \\"be Mrs. DeWinter\\" and \\"will live at Manderley\\", she hasn't a clue as to how these thoughts, prompted by much older Max DeWinter and his proposal of marriage, will change her life in a far different way than she ever anticipated. Du Maurier's heroine narrates her own story; she is fanciful, as gauche as the prototypical unblossomed teenager who feels everyone is looking at her as she walks down the high school hallway and hears cruel comments whispered at her expense. Imagine our heroine's surprise when handsome urbane widower Max DeWinter spends all his time in Monte Carlo taking her for drives and escorting her to lunch. Think how awed she is when his proposal comes---the dreams she conjurs--the romantic scenarios that bloom in her head with the same wild ferocity as the flowers Maxim tells her grow in profusion around Manderley's grounds. Of course, she accepts and the story changes venue from Monte Carlo to DeWinter's famous estate, Manderley. The narrator's voice becomes more uncertain as she enters Manderley's doors--the house, its servants and the responsibility of actually being mistress of Manderley unnerve and overwhelm her. In particular, the housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, emits a frigid aura that our heroine cannot thaw. Over time, we discover that Mrs. Danvers was very much attached to the first Mrs. De Winter, Rebecca. In fact,from the new bride's perspective, Rebecca haunts nearly everyone in the story: herself, Max, Mrs. Danvers, Frank, Beatrice, Favel---no one seems to be able to function fully without her. Du Maurier's technique of sharing the narrator's fantasies and fears regarding how she measures up to the legendary Rebecca, adds a masterful bit of psychological tension to all action in the story and helps flesh out the rather insignificant narrator whom Du Maurier didn't even think to name. (Younger readers may find these meanderings a little annoying at times and will want the action to continue rather than indulge in more daydreams. Reading these thoughts aloud rather than skimming over them will add more frazzle to the character's already taut nerves and deepen Manderley's already dark shadows.) Equally intriguing and enigmatic is the character of Max DeWinter, tortured by his loss, so wanting to move on, and so dysfunctionally frozen and unable to do so. Du Maurier creates an unequalled atmosphere of palpable unease. Whether you've read the story before and already know Manderley's secrets or are reading it for the first time, you are in for a finely nuanced treat that elicits many different interpretations of each of the main characters with each reading. This is undoubtably the best Gothic novel of the 20th century--the sequels, Mrs DeWinter and Rebecca's Tale (by different authors) do not compare, even though they are sanctioned by the Du Maurier Estate. Many critics dismiss Rebecca as one of Du Maurier's escapist romances; it is anything but---there is no romance here---the nameless narrator does not escape from the odd happenings manifesting themselves within Manderley's walls to love, she, as all other Du Maurier heriones finds herself trapped, first as a servant to an obnoxious American, then again as a servant to her husband who ultimately controls her every thought and action.  Du Maurier creates the eptiome of the 20th century woman.  Enjoy!these meanderings a little annoying at times and will want the action to continue rather than indulge in more daydreams.

B00005UW7G|2.0|I found this flimed version of Don Giovanni to be extremely disappointing. First and foremost are technical issues, specifically the sound. In short, it is wretched. Dim, washed out, low volume, congested, distorted - like listening through a cheap transistor radio. I have a very high quality hi-fi system, and have my DVD player fed into powerful amplifiers which in turn are fed into two large full range speakers, and even with all these advantages, the sound was beyond bad. Even with the volume turned way up, and treble and bass boosted I could derive no enjoyment from the music, which is by far the most important element in ANY opera production.<br />Moving onto the film itself, it seems to me that the whole manages to be less than the sum of its parts. Many scenes are thoughfully shot, and the on-location scenery is beautiful, but overall effect is oddly detatched and cold, and the production never really catches fire, as any great Don Giovanni must. I've seen many staged versions of this opera that possessed far more vitality and and a greater sense of realism than this one, despite its attempts of offering a \\"real life\\" version of the opera. <br />In fact, after viewing many operas on DVD over the past year, I have come to the conclustion that \\"filmed\\" versions of operas rarely work well. There seems to be something vital lost in the process of doing hollywood-style scene-by-scene acting to a lip-synched pre-recorded soundtrack. Consequently all the the opera DVD's that have truly captivated me are live recordings of staged performances. The immediacy of communication present at a live performance simply has not been present in any movie-style film version I have yet seen.<br />Having heard all of the current contenders (Karajan, Muti, Conlon, Harnoncourt, and this one), in my opinion there is no truly first-rate Don Giovanni on DVD at the present time. The one that comes closest is the Conlon, which is very good overall, and will at least hold you over until afirst-rate production becomes available.
B000002UEB|5.0|Somebody described this album 'Edge of the seat'. I could not agree more. The music is dramatic, powerful and very pacy. The whole album actually plays on like a movie. There are dialogues in between the songs. Those who like Iron Maiden will also love this album. This band also have dual lead guitarists and bass, the lineup also simulates Maiden's lineup and so is the music. There is some touch of Pink Floyd also.<br />This concept album is almost 60 minutes long, but it does not seem so. It does produce many melodic hard rocking moment. All the songs are good but my favourites here are 'Needle lies' and 'Eyes of the stranger'. I have  'Empire', their most popular album, but this album beats 'Empire' easily. <br />If you want to possess some great heavy metal albums, buy it right away. It deserves the average rating of 4.9 in amazon.com and also deserves to be one of the first 10 albums you buy in that category. It will storm your mind.
B00005B36H|5.0|I will admit that i did not like most of the songs on this cd when i first bought it. I bought it for \\"Schism\\" and that was it. I first thought the songs were too long and that they were boring and stupid. Only after a month of not listening to it I got it out of its case and put it on and listened to the cd in its entirety. I was instantly blown away by the sheer brilliance of this cd. The guitars blended in better than any previous cd that I own. The different instruments blend in well and you would almost think they have 20 people with them insteand of 4. The opening track \\"The Grudge\\" is pure brillance and it doesnt stop there, even the songs with no lyrics are excellent. They could possibly be better than the songs with lyrics because they exemplify music at its best. If you dont agree then you are not a true music fan. Tool is not a group that can fit into just one category, they are the whole spetra of styles except rap and country. They are heavy, prog, nu at times, alternative. They continue to raise the bar in music with each release and I personally cannot wait for their next release.
0060931736|5.0|Miss Jean Brodie teaches at a girls' school, and is the psychological guinea pig in one of Muriel Spark's most famous novels, The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie.  Six of her pupils become known as The Brodie Set after developing a close, if not inappropriately familiar relationship with the woman.  As her \\"creme de la creme\\" slowly grow up and gradually lose their childish fascination with sex to become--for the most part--little vamps themselves, Miss Brodie and the aesthetic and moral values she instilled in them continue to dictate their decisions.<br />But Miss Brodie, whose lively speech and love of art and the classics are endearing if sometimes pedantic, loses her job in the middle of her prime. She is told by the headmistress that one of her own betrayed her.<br />The mystery in the novel is not who betrayed Miss Brodie in the end, but why, and how did it lead to this?  How this betrayal is slowly unravelled in the retelling of Miss Brodie's prime, from the girls' adolescence through adulthood, is the most ingenious writing manouver in the novel.  Written loosely in the historical context of pre-World War II Scotland, the novel is also a glimpse into Edinburgh and the girls' school mileau.<br />For such a simple story, Spark's novel has refreshingly complex structure which forced me to question characters without reason or abhorr others for trivialities.  And as for the \\"prime\\" of the title, the way Spark deals with aging, coming to terms with the past, and living a full and meaningful life makes me find Miss Brodie all the more lovable.
B00003CXXM|5.0|Exceptional film. Finally, a director who is able to illustrate Damon's talent. Amazing shots, continuous action, and no misplaced love story to water down the plot. This film contains the most exciting action sequence I have seen in years. Shame it wasn't released at a time when there wasn't 30 spy films out. Highly, highly recommend.
0451207521|2.0|I really looked forward to getting this book. I waited till my library had the unabridged audiobook and listened to it as soon as I checked it out. What a disappointment. I've enjoyed a lot of Follett's novels but not this one, I think because I didn't like any of the main characters. The shallow romance and detailed torture scenes weren't enjoyable for me at all. I enjoyed the descriptions of the Jackdaws but guess what happened to most of them. I guess I don't really enjoy reading such stark reality--I get enough of that on the news.

I cannot stop listening to this cd.  It has excellent vocals, this guy can do it all, amazing guitar melodies including my favorite acoutic track &quot;On My Own,&quot; and kickin drum beats.  Its perfect for whatever mood you are in.  The songs range from &quot;I Love You,&quot; to I want to beat your face in!&quot; to &quot;I'm so lonely&quot; to &quot;Go to hell&quot;!  BUY IT!!
B00006RIO7|5.0|I am left speechless by this CD which remains true to the movie.<br />I am not usually left speechless but words simply can not even begin to describe this perfection.  Highlights:  All that Jazz,<br />Nowadays, Roxie, Razzle Dazzle, actually every single track is a highlight with the exception of the rap stuff, but whatever.  Catherine, Renee and Richard Gere all deserve Oscars, as does John C. Reilly.  And Grammys too, how 'bout that ?  And guess what ?  It blows ** ALL ** PREVIOUS VERSIONS *** of Chicago on CD right outa the water !! You'll never be able to listen to ANYONE but Catherine belt out All That Jazz ever again.  Or Richard with We Both Reached for the Gun & Razzle Razzle for that matter.  Or John with Mr. Cellophane which will make you cry.  Everyone involved with this CD deserves Grammys and Oscars.  Extra thank you to Kander & Ebb for giving us I Move On !!!  At the movie screening, the audience applauded after EVERY number - I've never seen that before - it was amazing !  This CD has recordings that are totally true to that expreience, as opposed to some soundtracks that don't sound anything like they did in the movie.  Best Soundtrack Ever ! Best Cd ever !

B00006L7XQ|3.0|First of all, I'm a Johnny Cash nut. So, I tend to be a little more critical than most people when it comes to reviewing his albums. His fourth album in the American series is by far the weakest. Although the title track is by easily one of the best Cash songs ever, the remainder of the album is evidence that Cash needs to ditch Rick Rubin and start writing his own songs. Has anyone noticed how every American album Cash puts out seems to have more covers than the previous one? Sure, some like &quot;Rusty Cage&quot; and &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; (which is featured on this album) work beautifully, but it seems that Rubin has gotten a litte too cover-happy these days. Cash's own tunes are always the best. This album is, however worth every cent, if only for the wonderful title track. For casual Cash fans, its best to buy one of the earlier American albums, or just buy one of the live prison albums.
0066214122|2.0|I have to say that I was very disappointed with Crichton's latest offering.  He does a very nice job of explaining the technology behind his premise.  He describes the &quot;rules of the game&quot; as every good technothriller writer should then he breaks these rules over and over again as he tries to make the story more and more sensational.  I know, you need to maintain a healthy &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot; to enjoy any book, but there was only so much I could take.  The good news is that I read it from cover to cover in 5 days (which is pretty good for me!), so it had to have kept my attention, right?
B000066NW0|3.0|When I first heard the songs \\"Complicated\\" & \\"Sk8er Boi\\" I didn't care for Avril's music. I thought it was too commercial and had no feeling, although the lyrics were cute.  When I heard \\"I'm With You\\" I thought, \\"who is that?\\". Then I found out it was Avril and said, \\"O.K. now were getting somewhere!\\" I thought she was going to be all about premanufactured, pop ... like everyone else, but my opinion changed when I listened to the songs that the radio stations didn't choose to play. The first song \\"Losing Grip\\" is awesome in my opinion, \\"I'm With You\\" is my second favorite, and \\"Mobile\\" is probably my third.  Radio stations seem to pick the songs they think will be most commercial and play them without giving reference to the more interesting and obscure music from an artist. I think they did that with \\"Complicated\\" & \\"Sk8ter Boi\\". Just buy the CD and choose the songs you like for yourself. I would recommend this CD if you like a sweet vocal with a harder edge.
B00006SFBD|5.0|According to another reviewer, we should not \\"pass judgement on [Opeth] based on Deliverance\\".  I don't see why...Deliverance ties Meshuggah's \\"Nothing\\" for best CD of 2002.  In a world where metal bands tend to soften up in order to sell more albums (I.E. In Flames), Opeth and Meshuggah keep it real.    Deliverance is the best work by Opeth so far.  Each song has lots of variety to it, and each section blends right in with the next.  But therein lies a small problem:  sometimes at the end of a song, I start thinking, \\"what does this have to do with the rest of the song?\\"  The biggest example is the last three minutes of the title track.  Yes, it is heavy and great, but it sounds nothing like the rest of the song!  But like I said, it's a TINY complaint.    The guitar solos kick so much ass this time around.  There are a couple instances in which the backing music gets kicked up a notch right before the solo starts (like in Total Eclipse by Iron Maiden)...FUN.  I love it.  Some songs contain multiple solos scattered throughout them.  Fun stuff once again.  The drummer sounds great, but I don't have the best ear for drums.    A Fair Judgement is so great too.  That's a track mellow enough that you can play it for your parents!  If Damnation sounds like this track, I'll buy it the day it comes out.    Anyways, I think it's wonderful.  To me, this album is heavier, more complex, and more varied than any other Opeth release.  An easy five stars.
1881273156|4.0|This book is an interesting but indirect approach to improving love between couples. Its philosphy of using improved love to improve lovemaking has real merit. I know that when I feel closer to my husband the sex is always better. But there are alot of non-emotional, technique-oriented factors that can contribute a LOT to having great sex, and this book doesn't go into that with any meaningful contributions. If you are wanting something of that ilk, you'd do well with the book \\"9 Free Secrets of New Sensual Power\\" or the DVD \\"New Free Sex\\" by Clint Arthur, or if you really feel like being nice to yourself, have them send you \\"Goddess Worship\\" and have your guy follow along with the guy in the video. After that it will be you Expressing!
B000069CWE|2.0|Pretty good for a remix album, but remix albums tend to be pretty weak, so that's not saying much. I suppose rap fans might like what they did with \\"In the End\\" or \\"Papercut\\" but overall there wasn't much improvement. \\"My December\\" was originally an amzing song but it was totally murdered on Reanimation. It's too bad the original wersion is not on any albums except some expensive import cds. \\"Crawling\\" is the only reason to buy this album. Aaron Lewis and Chester are AWESOME together and the violin part makes \\"Crawling\\" totally amazing and the best song on the album by a long, long way. However, if Linkin Park really wants to be recognized, they need to come out with new music instead of recycling old tunes.

B000002J1O|4.0|Many Genesis fans seem to agree that Selling England By The Pound (1973) is the best of the Gabriel-era albums. And itâs hard to disagree, with live favourites Cinema Show and Firth of Fifth heading up a solid set of songs. After this, Genesis would delve into post-modern conceptual experimentation (Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, 1974 ), after which Gabriel left the group for solo pastures green. This, then, is the last of the holy trinity of early-Genesis albums, the others being Foxtrot (1972) and Nursery Cryme (1971).. Selling England is an ambitious album whose key theme â\\" the destruction of traditional English values at the hands of advancing corporate and industrial forces â\\" is expressed in songs as diverse as they are eccentric. Thus we get epic satire on gang-war (Battle of Epping Forest), a 3-minute pop song (I Know What I Like) and thereâs even time for a rare, early lead vocal by Phil Collins (More Fool Me). On the other hand, Iâve always thought I Know What I Like an abomination in the Genesis catalogue, and personally prefer the Seconds Out versions of both Firth of Fifth and Cinema Show (except for the gorgeous piano intro on the former). On the other hand, this is definitely one of Genesisâ most accomplished albums and is listenable from start to finish â\\" which is more than be said of the Lamb Lies Down, or any Genesis record made after 1980, for that matter. To sum up, one of the top UK progressive rock albums ever.8

B00006RIO7|5.0|The soundtrack to CHICAGO the movie made me wonder - could the show's music stand up with Hollywood's treatment left in the theatres and me alone with this CD of famous actors belting showtunes?  The answer is YES!  Catherine Zeta Jones sounds great, and so does the rest of the cast.  Some songs from the show are missing - &quot;I am my Own Best Friend&quot; being the one I miss the most.  But surprise!  The album has a song the movie left out (DVD scene to come I am sure) - the hilarious coupling of Zeta Jones and Queen Latifah for &quot;CLASS&quot;.<br />These are all ultra-faithful renditions of the songs from CHICAGO the musical.  It's a perfect introduction for new comers, and a collector's item for long time fans.  It's slick and gorgeous -- like the movie.<br />OH, BUT IT'S HEAVEN NOWADAYS!
0385486804|5.0|Chris McCandless, a young man from a wealthy family, college educated, intelligent, some one who apparently had it all.  Looks can be deceiving, he gave away his life savings to charity, abandoned his car and most possessions, and set off, on foot for the last adventure of his lifetime.  He hitchiked (or hoboed as he put it) across the United States, and ended up in Alaska.  His goal was to live in the wilderness, although he was totally unprepared for Alaska's harsh winter.  Many people tried to talk him out of it, but he was determined and stubborn.  One person even gave him a pair of waterproof boots, as Mcandless was wearing only tennis shoes.  In the middle of nowhere, he found an old box car for shelter.  He had a rifle, and shot a moose for food.  If he knew how to properly preserve the moose, he might still be alive.  If he had a map to find his way back from a rain swollen river, he might be alive.  The book is filled with many what ifs?, close calls, and Whys?  I'm not sure anyone can answer why, But Jon Krakauer is a fantastic journalist and presents all the facts, letting the reader draw his or her own conclusions.  Whas he suicidal, plainly stupid, or over-confident?  I think he wanted to test himself.  This book is truly a page turner.
B00005NC66|5.0|More than forty years later, it may be hard for modern audiences to understand how revolutionary Jean-Luc Godard and his Nouvelle Vague (French New Wave) contemporaries really were.  So many aspects of Godard's stylistic achievements, such as the unabashedly hand-held camera, have become so popular in music videos, TV, and the movies, that its use here may not seem notable.  Film critic David Sterritt's commentary track does an excellent job of conveying the importance of this first feature-length Godard opus, and also emphasizes the many ways in which the director is having fun with his audience.  As Sterritt demonstrates, Godard uses what he has enjoyed from his life as a lover of movies to deliver a filmgoing experience that contains the humor and action that he enjoys.  Godard lingers on the lengthy interactions between Breathless' two young actors, allowing us all to savor their intimacy, and also uses Brechtian self-conscious techniques to encourage the viewer to stop and consider his filmic experience.  Breathless is a great introduction to Godard, much more accessible to current American audiences than his later work.  Watch the movie first, then watch it again with the excellent commentary track.
B00006RIO7|5.0|I'm surprised I'm the first with a review.  I haven't listened to the soundtrack but I did see the movie January 7th and it was great!  So amazing were the performances by Catherine Zeta Jones, Rene Zellweger, Richard Gere, and Queen Latifah.  I haven't bought the soundtrack yet but I'm planning on it.
B000003TB6|5.0|Their first mainstream album; One of those rare rap albums that you can listen to all the way through.  Their other albums are tight, but this one is untouchable.   Quality music, period.
B00005JKZT|5.0|Last year's The Fellowship Of The Ring, director Peter Jackson's first entry in his three-part adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord Of The Rings, provided little cause for complaint. At once thoroughly cinematic and faithful to the spirit (if not always the letter) of Tolkien's book, it presented Middle Earth as an immersive experience, a world in which every aspect is realized in minute detail. Fellowship made the impossible believable, and without draining the magical happenings, fantastical locations, and uncanny creatures of their wonder, it also never abandoned a sense of dramatic and thematic weight. As embodied by a well-chosen cast, Fellowship's characters had all the depth Tolkien gave them on the page (and sometimes more), and their quest to rid the world of a ring of absolutely corrupting power took on greater urgency as the film progressed toward a cliffhanger that set up its second part. The film has plenty of action, as soulful hobbits Elijah Wood and Sean Astin make their way toward Mordor, friends Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan find unlikely allies deep in a forest, and the dwarf/elf/human team of John Rhys-Davies, Orlando Bloom, and Viggo Mortensen attempts to defend a struggling kingdom from the forces of Christopher Lee.<br />What makes Towers so staggering is the way it brings the full scope of Jackson's adaptation into focus. Without missing a beat in three hours, the film shifts from epic to lyrical and back. It portrays a harrowingly intense battle one moment, then pauses for a father's grief over his son's death the next. It shows in frightening detail the engines of war, then links those engines to the bloodshed they exact and the ecological destruction that made them possible.<br />What Fellowship suggested, Towers elucidates. It's thrilling as swords clash and arrows fly, but it also never abandons the underlying sadness of Tolkien's world, in which each victory only forestalls the transition to a meaner age. Next year, The Return Of The King will bring the story to a close. Until then, it feels almost like a privilege to watch the unfolding of a tale from a fantastic imagined past rich with resonance for the human present.

B0000640VO|5.0|I bought this movie two weeks ago on here, I got it last week without knowing anything about it-other than it was in French. I am glad I did! The setting, the characters and the story are wonderful. It is a great comedy and love story. I thought the subtitles were going to be hard to follow, but it was not at all. If you love a great story-Buy this movie!
B00005B36H|4.0|With something of a negetive response to this album for many Tool fans, some people I know even said the band had 'sold-out'.  The issue is the slight change in style.  But this is NO mass-market latter-day Metallica material.  I've rarely heard anything from this album played even on 'alternative' radio.  Earlier albums: Opiate was raw and cutting. Undertow was more polished and hard.  Aenima, the pinnacle of biting, hard/metal deserving to be played at volume - but with a mixture of experimental wierdness and fun included.<BR>The first two times I played this album I hated Tool for what they had done to one of my all-time favourite bands.  A couple more attempts and I now play it at least once a week (and it's been out a long time now).<BR>More mellow (evil word in the metal world!), more musical, more considered.  Maynard's singing isn't as obviously biting and vehment as Aenima, drums and guitar aren't as downright thumping.  But there is still plenty of power there.<BR>If you are a Tool fan and not sure, definitely give it a go and several attempts.  DON'T LISTEN TO THE WHOLE THING INTENTLY!  Just play it while driving or something.  The longer tracks loose something if you try to catch them in one go.  These aren't 3 minute Helmet headslammers.<BR>The plastic slip-over cover is a PAIN IN THE [butt]!<BR>Stand-out tracks for me were The Patient, Schism (harking back to Undertow a bit), Parabola and the musical Disposition.<BR>Well worth the effort.
0676973760|4.0|One must accept that a novel need not provide only one interpretation to be regarded as a great and unique piece of literature. It is interesting most reviewers/readers choose to believe Pi's story of talking tigers and animal companionship on his long lifeboat journey, while I understand this to be Pi's natural coping reaction to the horrendously tragic ordeal of losing his family - most horrifically having to helplessly watch his mother be murdered and eaten in front of him! The beauty of the ending is in the rose-coloured conclusions of his Japanese interrogators, who have also chosen to believe in Pi's fantastic tale, despite their intense scepticism during their initial investigation. As one surely feels after watching A Miracle of 34th Street, we are all happy to find optimism and hope may still exist in some of our jaded human natures.<br />Despite finding the 1st half of the book tedious,I was glad I persevered (hoping to see what all the Booker Prize fuss was about), as the ending, no matter how naive (Martel has artfully crafted Pi's personality to reflect this innocence)was a breath of fresh air in this post 9/11 age of gloom and pessimism.
B000005IU1|5.0|This album still thrills me, lo these many years later. When Iggy barks at Ron Asheton to \\"tell 'em how I feel!\\" with the heavy emphasis on the \\"I\\", Asheton reels off into one of my favorite guitar solos of all time: desperate, fuzzed-out and wah-wah heavy, spiraling and spinning until you KNOW how Iggy feels!This stuff sounds utterly spontaneous, almost as if they made it up on the spot, which is probably not far from the truth. I saw these guys right after Fun House came out, and they were the loudest, most intense dada-like band imaginable. Sonic Youth later stole their act. If you like your rock and roll primal, this one is it. Ron Asheston steals the show from the Ig.

I learned enough to be convinced many technology advances have a higher probability of being derived through some external source than through the normal progression of technology.<br />&quot;Successful&quot; leaps of technology without underlying research and development are VERY unusual.  Let's just say, &quot;Beyond Belief&quot;!
B000021YQV|5.0|This album is FUNNY! Don't ask why just listen to it and if you have any sense of humor, you'll be on the floor. Best song is Needles.
B00005B36H|5.0|This to me is TOOL's best album yet. I have all of TOOL's albums and this one takes the cake. Every song and the album is great even the little \\"ear candy\\" as they like to call it. If your a tool fan and do not have this album. Then you're missing out on a whole diffrent experience. When you listen to this album don't look at it as just music, but as art somewhere greater then you can amagine. HAVE A NICE DAY :)
B00007E8V4|5.0|This album owns! Anyone who's a big fan of System of a Down better get this album. It's the BEST CD I've heard all year. It's much better than Toxicity and System of a Down. Best song on it is Boom!, only one that makes sense really but who cares hehe.
B00006690F|5.0|I purchased this CD after hearing some of it from a friend.  He's the Charles Barkley of music.  Very intense, brutally honest and in many cases very funny!!  He goes through a whole range of emotions, and takes any listener for the ride.  I thoroughly enjoy this cd, and have since ordered other cd's by him.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Regardless of whether or not Interpol receives comparisons to Joy Division, Turn on the Bright Lights is one of the year's best albums.  Sometimes the comparisons are just inevitable, but who really cares?  Most bands that make the &quot;big breakthrough&quot; get labeled right off the bat.  It's just a method used by critics to attract a certain type of fan base; not a way of dismissing a band's individuality.  The Joy Division comparison is legit because they do, in fact, sound like Joy Division.  So what!  The world needed another Joy Division.  Plus, if you're going to be compared to someone, it might as well be one of the most important bands in history.   <br />So let's get to the point.  In a nutshell, Interpol are basically four young men from NY who seem to be having fun making a record that emulates their live sound.  I must also mention that their live sound is top notch.  Songs like &quot;Obstacle 1&quot; and &quot;PDA&quot; show them delving right into the infamous post-punk genre of 1977-1981, while maintaining the ability to make their sound current and fresh.  &quot;NYC&quot; and &quot;Hands Away&quot; reflect more of the individuality these guys are so desperately seeking.  &quot;NYC&quot; also gets my vote as one of the top songs of 2002.<br />Whatever the case may be, Interpol is a great band who've released an album that is worthy of discussion.  How you choose to talk about them is your business.  Compare them to Eddie Money for all I care.  As Interpol's career progresses, the comparisons will slowly fade away.  But when the dust settles, Turn on the Bright Lights will be an album that people will come back to over the years, and they'll listen with the same adoration then as they do today.

B00006LPK5|3.0|REIGN OF FIRE is a movie which could be described as MAD MAX meets DRAGONHEART meets BLUE THUNDER.<BR>The year is 2020. Underground workers in a futuristic yet medievel looking London awaken a dragon from centuries of undisturbed sleep. The dragon then immediately sets about turning the already dilapidated London into a raging inferno. It's up to US militia man Van Zan (Matthew McConaughey) and tunnel worker Quinn (Christian Bale) to join forces and destroy the creature, who needs to feed on the ashes left by the fires it starts. This movies plot was probably written on a matchbook. There is a medievel style theatre scene early on in the movie mocking STAR WARS light saber battles. There's also an amusing TIME magazine cover which shows up, but it is nowhere near matching the latest Bond film in terms of product placement.<BR>REIGN OF FIRE is produced by Richard Zanuck, best known for the first two JAWS movies. The movie is loaded with corny dialogue (&quot;There's only one thing worse than a dragon. Americans&quot; quips one of the British actors). Features good visual FX and predictably, the movies soundtrack features the old Hendrix classic FIRE. REIGN OF FIRE is a guilty pleasure. Perfect rainy night viewing.
0761119752|5.0|This is our first Sandra Boynton book and a family favorite at our house!  My 20 month old son brings it to me often to have read to him during the day, and it's part of our nightly routine as well.  When it's late and he refuses to get out of the tub at night because he's having too much fun, we mention that it's time to read Pajama Time, and he practically jumps out by himself!  I've read the book more times than I can imagine, but I'm not tired of hearing the rhythm of the words - my husband reads it with more of a rap sound, while I choose to use more of an upbeat cheer.  The drawings are so cute!  My son always points out the moon to us and I love that chicken lying on the ground pulling his pants on!  We enjoy how the last page seems to quiet things down by using smaller and smaller type, implying that the words get quieter, and the use of the words \\"Hush, hush\\" and \\"shhhh\\".  <br />It's a definite keeper although our copy is getting a little hashed.  If I had any complaints, it would be the hole in the moon on the cover was way too tempting for my son - he's bent the little flap there so it doesn't look very nice anymore. <br />I'm considering buying multiple copies to give away as shower gifts, but I suppose it's more age appropriate for kids over the age of 1.<br />If this is any indication of the fun and excitement of Sandra Boynton's other books, we'll be expanding our collection!
0316666343|5.0|First, I must say that I loved this book.  It was most certainly a style of writing that took some &quot;getting used to,&quot; as it is different from anything I've ever read before (I'm not usually one to read such a genre.)  However, because of all the advertisements and &quot;hype&quot;, (to use the word that other reviewers have used), I felt I must at least give it a chance.   It was one of the best chances I have ever taken on a book.  Sebold's writing style does seem somewhat &quot;amateurish,&quot; but this has to be considered:  it is written through the eyes of a fourteen year old girl.  If it were more complex and adult, it wouldn't have been &quot;believable&quot; at all.  As it is, I couldn't put the book down...and I suppose that's a very good thing.<BR>      So, in conclusion, this book is beautifully written.  It has poetry, which is important to me, and it draws you in to the characters like so few books can.  It evokes feelings...it can make you happy and then instantly make you want to cry.  And, if gone into with an open mind, I think anyone can enjoy it.
B00005LKHW|5.0|This movie is definitely worth buying, if you like comedy movies and you liked the American Pie movie when you rented it or saw it in theatres. It has so many extras and is definitely worth buying.

B00006RIO7|5.0|CHICAGO, the movie, is one of the strongest stage-to-film transitions to come out in a long time.  It captures all the joy and Esprit de Corps of the musical.  Because the film is so successful on all levels visually, it runs the risk of closer inspection when the CD of the soundtrack is addressed.  Were the musical numbers intrinsically excellent or were they just bouyed up by visual manipulations (superb as those manipulations were!)?<br />Now that the CD is out the jury is in!  Here is a disc of magic that successfully documents just how fine the cast is in the musical vein.  Renee Zellweger is in fine voice and has just the right sound for Roxie the chanteuse.  Catherine Zeta-Jones knows how to belt out songs like &quot;All That Jazz&quot; and really sell them.  Richard Gere is a major surprise - his 'Razzle Dazzle' sparkles as much in pure vocal form as it did in the wonderfully cinematic form.  Queen Latifah is well known for her Rap gifts, but here she sings like a Mae West or Sophie Tucker, completely immersed in her character.  John O'Reilly has one of the best bands on the CD with his tender 'Mister Cellophane' number that evokes all the beauty of the old vaudeville theater tunes.  The CD is well engineered and a welcome addition to all music lovers' libraries.
B000060P79|1.0|The same rehashed Pop/Punk thats been used over and over again. Flavor of the week guaranteed. Let them have their moment in the sun. Let the little kiddies call themselves &quot;punk&quot;. Let them have a taste of the rock star life style, but in a year they will be forgotten. This is what happened to Blink 182, and Sum 41 was really big for a while, but they're losing it already. Now, it's New Found Glory(who are starting to lose it), Good Charlotte, and this unholy drivel known as Simple Plan. This pop/punk thing will be over... give it a year or two. THERE IS STILL HOPE FOR GOOD MUSIC!
B00005JL7Q|5.0|Just when you think that every Hugh Grant movie is from a template too thinly worn, up pops ABOUT A BOY.  With a fine script, excellent direction and supporting cast this is Hugh Grant's finest hour.  Yes, he still maintains than British aloof gentleman aura, but here he allows us to see the shallow void of his character and then invites us to explore his self-evaluation and and salvation in getting on the trail of becoming a man with a meaningful life.  The cast is excellent - Toni Collette, Rachel Weisz, and Nicholas Hoult are completely immersed in well written roles.  And for once the conclusions reached in this little tale are not force fed: happiness is found around us with a little help form our friends. A surprisingly fine little film.

B00005QAPH|5.0|8 1/2, which graced the ten best films lists of ciritics for decades shines on this DVD edition from Criterion.  I don't think it has ever sounded and looked this good on American shores.  <br />If you love Fellini you must have this film.  It sums up his artistic vision and tendencies perfectly.
0786860707|5.0|This is truly the most important and transcendent book on animation ever. Anything anyone can tell you about this book is not even near of what you will see, learn and enjoy by reading it and experiencing it. This is not a book about exercises or animation techniques, if you are looking for that, get 'The animator's survival kit' by Richard Williams....
B00006LI4S|5.0|Firstly I will say that I am a Pink Floyd fan of all eras and had the pleasure to see Roger Waters - In The Flesh concert when he was in Australia.<br />I was disaponted when I bought the Roger Waters - In The Flesh DVD because I felt it failed to capture the atmosphere as when I saw him live in concert.<br />So I was a bit hesitant in buying this DVD when I first heard about it. After reading several reviews I was intrigued - David playing Pink Floyd songs unplugged as well as Syd Barrett songs and one song from Rick Wrights album Broken China.<br />A few warnings to people considering buying this DVD:<br />. Don't expect lasers, floating pigs, fireworks. This is David playing in small scale venue in some cases entirely on his own.<br />. This is David Gilmour in concert not Pink Floyd so the selection of Pink Floyd songs he has selected to play mostly are from the album The Division Bell and some PF classics such as Wish You Were Here, Comfortably Numb, Shine On You Crazy Diamond 1-4 and 5-8.<br />I love this DVD and have watched it over and over and over. David proves what a phenominal guitar player he is and that his voice and guitar were the musical strength of Pink Floyd. To hear<BR>songs like Fat Old Sun, Dominoes and Terrapin played live are <BR>a treat to the ears.<br />Davids interpretation of playing PF songs and the songs of other artists accoustically is very creative and works very well.
0767817443|1.0|I once read in an interview with Dean Devlin that himself and Roland Emmerich were not pleased with the final edit of this film because of time contraints.  Would it have really mattered?  Although they gave a nod to Gojira's real name not the bastardized Americanized version, it didn't really help and neither would another edit.  This movie seemed to try to cash in on the \\"raptor & T-rex\\" popularity of Jurassic Park.  Godzilla movies were and still are many things, going from all out camp to grim cautionary tale, but when the old (and new) Kaiju movies take themselves seriously, they succeed in their goals with heart and substance, and when they go for camp even those work on some level.  This movie never figured out what it wanted to be and seems all the more shallow for it.  If art is honesty then the old Godzilla is a masterpiece and the American version is just a [inexpensive] copy.  Note:  Godzilla movies are still being made in Japan and if you have the means and are a fan, try to see them.  The last US release was Godzilla 2000, three have came out since, two of which I've seen and they are far better than most.  Also see the Gamera 90's trilogy, in many ways they are superior.  Added note as of Jun 2006:  I watched an episode of the Director's with Roland Emmirich and what he had said about this movie was that it would be neat to see a large monster run around New York and that's why he made it.  Well that certainly explains quite a bit about this pile of...  Roland never got Gojira to begin with, the cards were already stacked against him before he even started.  Gojira recently enjoyed his 50th anniversary with one last movie (yeah right) and it stunk almost as bad as this.  If you are a Don Frye fan, he is in it quite a bit, though only as a novelty.
B0000025ZF|1.0|Reading the reviews of this album I find people say you have to listen to the lyrics to appreciate this album. Trouble is Roger whispers or moans for most of the album and I can't understand what the heck he is singing about.<br />I tried a few times to give this album a listen but gave up. Even Eric Claptons beautiful guitar does not save this album.  also Eric declined playing The Pros And Cons live probably because he discovered how impossible Roger is to work with.<br />Roger strength is definately writing intelligent even poetic lyrics - the trouble is whats the point of listening to the lyrics if the music is weak and Roger insists on whispering, moaning or screaming the lyrics at you.<br />Buy only if you are a die hard Roger Waters fan.
6301763041|5.0|I was watching TV late one night and saw this movie. I got so involved in it i watched it over and over. I'm actually watching it right now. This movie, I believe, is the best movie that was ever made! Johnny Depp is so hott! Everyone should defenetly see this movie!
B000002J2B|5.0|Why is this? Simple, no more Steve Hackett studio work after this and the live Seconds Out. This has everything that made Genesis one of the greatest bands of the early and mid 70's. Two songs at the start that remind us of how good prog rock is. A ballad that points to a diferent future. Then a couple of crazy songs to mix it up and finally the final several pieces ending in Afterglow. I feel that Steve added a texture to the band that is lacking after this. I love Genesis in all of their lineups, but the best was behind them after this (and of course Seconds Out confirms all of this).
B000069HK2|5.0|First of all, for the moment just try to disregard the fact that this band has been totally played out. After all, it's all about the music, isn't it? Well... obviously our friends in the Used think differently, but you really have to take a couple of things into consideration before you blame everything on them. <br />After recording the majority of the album in John Feldmann (producer, and lead singer of the band Goldfinger)'s L.A. home studio, the band was being attacked by major labels left and right. So apparently, the big honchos over at Warner Bros. made some amazing offer that the band just couldn't refuse, and then, a couple snowboarding trips later, they somehow convinced the Used to sign over to Reprise. <br />Who knows what the offer was... the most cash, unlimited creativity, all you can snort cocaine buffet... but they took it, and had no choice but to sell out on TRL and nu-metal/pop punk radio stations all over the United States. These guys used to be homeless, and they got an amazing offer from a major label. Blame Warner Bros. Anyways... about the record. It's an amazing one, and I can't even get through the day without listening to it on the bus ride to school in the morning. :) JUST FORGET THE FACT THAT EVERY TEENIE BOPPER HAS &quot;THE TASTE OF INK&quot; ALONG SIDE HER JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE AND NELLY MP3'S ON SOME MIXED CD. Bert, in my opinion, is one of the greatest singers of the 21st century (so far...), and Quinn, Branden and Jeph are all very talented musicians. While the majority of the record does have some what of a mainstream feel to it... the emotion is still there, with brilliant song writing, musically and lyrically. This is the CD that the emo kids listen to when no one is looking. So... if you like one of their singles... go out and buy the album right now. Because, whether you like it or not, this is one of the best releases of 2002. Enjoy.
B000002MIY|5.0|That &quot;Two Against Nature&quot; is technically the long-awaited follow-up to Steely Dan's 1980 release &quot;Gaucho&quot; is an unfortunate fact of history for me.  This CD, released just 13 years after &quot;Gaucho,&quot; remains the superior work.  The songs are just so much more flowing, the muscicianship tighter, and the songwriting itself heads and shoulders above the later release.  A' la other great releases - &quot;Dark Side of the Moon,&quot; &quot;2112,&quot; &quot;Zen Arcade,&quot; and the such, this CD proports to be a strange little tale about a man and his car and the travels they make and the people they meet.  Okay, i suppose you could vibe on that for awhile, but why?  The songs, in and of themselves, are so absorbing, that any attempt to link them together would only potentialy serve to cheapen the effort on a purely muscial scale.<br />This is one of the most solidly consistant CDs that I have heard in years (which is why it is listed amongst my 50 faves).  From the opening notes of &quot;Kamikiriad,&quot; where Fagens electric piano work meshes oh so smoothly with Becker's bass and then Blam!  Chris Parker lays down a thick groove - to the closing notes of the party-groove &quot;Teahouse on the Tracks&quot;, you know that what you are witnessing is not so much a solo work, but the newest (at the time) Steely Dan recording, even if not so much in name.  <br />All in all, this is a CD that has seen constant play in my household for the past decade, with no signs of letup.
0767817710|4.0|The Quick and the Dead is a often silly and sometimes even cartoonish western about a women gunslinger (Sharon Stone) seeking revenge on the evil town tyrant (Gene Hackman). He took her father away from her when she was a little girl and now she has her chance for revenge when there's a gunslinger tournerment that he just happens to be enteredd in.<br /><br />  Russel Crowe (Gladiator) co-stars as a preacher that reminds Stone of her dad. He's Hackman's prisinor who he loves to be-little and humiliate. I saw Crowe's talent in this film as he's fantastic and steals the show and it's great to see that he's a big star now. The cast is just great, besides there being Hackman, Stone and Russel Crowe.<br /><br />  You also got Leonardo DiCaprio as Hackman's son. Lance Henrikson (Aliens) and Keith David (The Thing) as  gunslingers, Pat Hingle (Batman) as a bartender and Gary Sinise (Forest Gump) in small flashbacks as Stone's father. Sam Raimi the director of Spiderman's direction is always lively and hardly ever boring and his direction here is very lively and always keeps you interested. The film's biggest flaw is the cartoonish big holes you see in a gunslinger when they get shot. Other than that I think this film is a lot of fun, especially for Sam Raimi fans.
B000002H33|5.0|Wow!  That was all I could say after I first heard this.  Then I listened again and again and again. Well, you know the rest. Powerful lyrics, head throbbing fast guitar action. I love it!  Then, afterwards sadly Metallica decided to go Easy Listening. Too bad. Well, enjoy this one, it's a timeless classic.
0316666343|2.0|On a trip to Vancouver I learned about this book during a CBC book review program, called HotType.<br />The story is about a young girl, brutally murdered, witnessing her family coping with the reality of her death from her personal heaven and magically revealing herself to some people from time to time.<br />The story lingers, and lingers, and it suddenly struck me that the book was exactly like one of these cheap hollywood tearjerkers, the one's that give Hollywood it's name for bad taste and need for special effects (read: girl in heaven revealing herself etc etc - drama - blah blah - etc.).<br />If you like this type of hollywood film, this book might be for you. If you like literature: skip it.
B000002UEB|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this album. What a great idea to have a continous story for an album. Wonderful! This album really gets you to think and it showcases Geoff Tate's amazing range as a singer. There is not a bad song on this album. ...this is worth every penny spent. Buy it immediately or else!  Just kidding. Get it, you won't regret it. Revo lution.
B000003TA4|5.0|Nevermind is a great CD, but it is not their best.  In utero is better, in my opinion.  If you heard Smells Like Teen Spirit, and asume all Nirvana will be like that, your wrong.  Nevermind, is soft Nirvana.  In utero, Bleach and Incesticide are all heavier, more depressing, and have better songs.<br />Nevermind is still a great CD, however.
B00005JL7Q|3.0|It's hard for me to imagine how this movie may have stood on it's own had I not read the book, but having done so only a few months before having seen the film on the big screen, I could not help but be disappointed when 2/3 of the way through the movie it took a divergent turn which ended in a rather sappy would-be cathartic moment.  I didn't buy it, but at the same time realized that it would have been hard to get a good &quot;Hollywood&quot; type climax from the book in the first place, so I rented the DVD really hoping to gain some insight into how and why the movie version ended as it did.<br />My first reaction to the director's commentary is that they really make you feel as if they'd rather not be watching the movie again and they can't imagine why we are even bothering to watch it with their commentary - the comments given during the deleted scenes bonus feature really cement this impression - BTW, seems to me they left out a scene at the end which would have been better left in.  <br />As for why they changed the ending, they really don't say, the only reflection upon the changed ending being a reference to a New Yorker critic who said it was horrible  and then a slight against that same critic later in the scene when they more or less question what type of human being could find the scene &quot;horrible.&quot;<br />Personally, I wouldn't say the ending is horrible, but it is a disappointment, especially given the quality of the cast and of the original story.  I'd recommend the book over the movie, along with everything else Nick Hornby has written, but would add that in my opinion &quot;High Fidelity&quot; was extremely well done - perhaps the best book to film transformation I've ever seen.
B000002UCN|5.0|No doubt Beatle George Harrison was one of the 20th Century's most gifted musical geniuses, both when he was a member of the Beatles and after they broke up.<br />This album highlights George Harrison's best pieces up to 1976 when this album was first released.<br />I find some of the complaints that this album did not include such songs as.... Quite strange, as those songs where released after 1976 when this album was compiled!<br />Only one song that was not included in this album should have been included: If Not For You (1970)<br />Otherwise this is a great pleasure to listen to, reminiscent of the gentler, kinder and overall much better world of the 1960's and 70's -compared to the cynical, jaded and twisted days of the early 21st century...sigh...<br />Two of my favourite songs of all-time are the inspirational `Here Comes The Sun' (1969) and `Give Me Love `Give Me Peace on Earth' (1970).<br />Other fantastic hits include `While My Guitar Gently Weeps' (1968), My Sweet Lord (1970), What Is Life (1970) and You (1975).<br />Bangla Desh (1971) is a song of conscience about the hideous war that was taking place at the time. If only there was someone like George Harrison today to create a song about the cruelty taking place in Zimbabwe today, by the genocidal regime of Robert Mugabe.<br />This encapsulates Harrison's genius and the wonder of those years. I listen to it all the time.
B00005UOKM|5.0|Has Blue Note fixed this problem yet? Great music nonetheless.
B00006FXB6|5.0|I bought this album the second day it came out, and I still can't stop listening to it.  I'm not sure if it's better than Rated R or not, as this album is very different.  After falling in love with Rated R, I was very excited to hear the new Queens album, and I wasn't let down at all.  These guys know how to make music that rocks AND is actually interesting.  This is the thinking man's hard rock album.  Best album of 2002 if you ask me.
B00006RU5B|5.0|To the person who said this album is a major dissappointment, you're a major dissappointment. As for what you said about it not being RATM, and Zack being RATM. 1)this is not true  2)they never claimed to be Rage, theyre a new band, and are all the better. Rage was one of my favorite modern bands when they were around, now Audioslave is. Do not buy this album to add to your Rage collection, it isn't Rage, it never will be. This album is a milestone, and I'm sure these guys will influence the way people play as much as Nirvana did for grunge. I'm sure affected by the album. What this album has more than anything else is pulse. You can feel it in your bones, and every song on the album gets me jumping up and down at some point in it. Now that I've yelled at people for comparing the Rage and Audioslave, I will say that there are some similarities. The classic Rage style was to play some sort of lick or something of the sort for a while, then back off and just do some background as Zack rapped his vocals. In Audioslave, the licks of the beginning carry throughout the song. There is no doubt in my mind that if you like good music you will like this band, get the album, support the band, be happy.
B00005RFAI|5.0|I have never written a review but I do read reviews before buying pretty much anything. I did fell compelled to say something about this amazing album. Pink has an iincredible  voice and this amazing way with words. I love EVERY single song on this CD. Although I do not have her first CD, mostly because the songs didn't appeal to me. I am glad the label took a chance and let Pink do 'HER&quot; thing. I am looking foward to more PINK!
B000069AUI|5.0|How I love this band.  I admit that I passionately love nearly all music from the UK...from the Beatles to Oasis to Travis to Radiohead to Keane.  However, none has touched me (or warmed up my CD player) the way Coldplay has.<br /><br />\\"In My Place\\" is reflective.  It's popularity is not without understanding.  It's dramatic, heartfelt, pleading...particularly when he sings \\"please, please come back and sing to me\\".  It's amazing how a little song can well your eyes with tears and help you find your own place in the world.  The background drum beat is fabulous and adds a rhythm to the song that might otherwise have left it feeling somewhat empty.  It's fabulously syrupy and original and beautiful.<br /><br />\\"Clocks\\" is a great song, as well.  Again, you have that soft sound that lets you feel its passion without being sappy.  This and all the songs have the same amazing appeal that Parachutes offered, but without sounding repetitive or \\"been there, done that\\".<br /><br />\\"The Scientist\\", now holds a special significance for me. It was playing as I walked into the operating room to have a c-section to give birth to my son, Henry. Now, that may be a crazy reason to love a song, but to be truthful, I had always loved Coldplay, anyway. To know that my MD and his staff did, too, was really cool. And it made the whole frightening birth experience memorable. The music was comforting - in fact, Coldplay CDs played the entire 30 minutes I was in the OR.<br /><br />It's a play-thru CD...you might originally buy it for one song only or for the sake of owning another Coldplay CD, but, trust me, you'll end up loving everything on it.  Buy it for you and then buy another copy for the most important person in your life!
B000056WTC|5.0|This movie is my favorite of all time, and we will never see another person come close to Bruce Lee... ever.
0679745653|4.0|This book was entertaining and fast moving but didn't make sense at times. A good book for anyone that likes a quick read. there is a lot of underlying messages that need a closer look after reading it once. Reading it over again helps you pick up on little things you didn't get before.
B00005JL96|4.0|Well not really, the Lion King will likely always be my favorite, but this one has tied with Mulan, and The Emperor's New Groove for my number 2 spot in Disney Films.<br /> While I'm not normally fond of Disney for their butchery of classic stories (The little Mermaid was turned to stone, and the Hunchback was killed... leave it to Disney to give it a happy ending) as well as Disney's near Microsoft level of world domination every so often they put out a film that I can't ignore. Lately I've been proud of Disney for their putting out films that are a lot more mature, especially with their humor, and the fact that they are no longer afraid of the PG rating. Lilo and Stitch, like the Emperor's New Groove is a slapstick comedy with a lot of mature themes, but one positive theme throughout the film... Family.<br /> When most of Hollywood is content to underplay the importance of family, and in fact, in many cases diminish it, and degrade it, this film makes it a point to express, to a nearly tear jerking level how important family really is, especially in today's society. I personally felt that the relationship between Lilo and her older sister was very realistic, far from abusive, but misunderstood by the social worker who had been sent to observe the family, or what's left of it after their parents are killed.<br /> Nani, (Lilo's sister) is bogged down trying to pick up where her parents left off, paying bills, working full time, and taking care of Lilo, a task that has her utterly exhausted. Hoping to help Lilo get a friend she takes her to a local animal shelter where Lilo picks out what she thinks is an innocent puppy, not knowing that this puppy is actually a genetically engineered alien whose soul purpose is to destroy everything in sight, clog drain pipes, back up sewers, and steal everyone's left shoe. Lilo is also unaware of the aliens that have been sent to capture her new pet.<br /> This film is absolutely hilarious, yet powerful. I really enjoyed it, and its message. I recommend this film for both children and adults, as the movie is by and large inoffensive, with enough movie parody and references for the older folks to enjoy as well... (Like Stitch's little romp through San Francisco...)sage.

B000066NW0|5.0|Okay... I absolutely love this CD.  It's not punk, but it's not pop either.  Come on, give her some credit.  She &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; doing her own thing.  Leave the chick alone....<BR>I listen to punk, emo, and some pop.... and I can't put her in one category alone.  It's a great CD tho.... give it a try
B00006NSZ5|4.0|I must say that Eminem found the right MC's to make a soundtrack CD. If you've watched the movie, you have to say that music is the right one for it. Rappers such as Gang Starr, Obie Trice, 50 Cent, Jay-Z, Nas, Xzibit,... have shown their best to compile together one of the best soundtracks in 2002. But still not the best.<br />Albums stars with allknown song \\"Lose Yourself\\", i believe you've all seen the video and you have to say it is tight. Albums consists of 16 songs, most of them with tight lyrics and beats, especially \\"Battle\\" by Gang Starr. I Don't like song by Macy Gray, it just doesnt fit in this soundtrack. Maybe some of you like it, but I just don't. Eminem's flow in \\"8 Mile Road\\" is extremely above all and I like those instruments in background, they just fit with that lyric. If you like song \\"Lose yourself\\", eventhough you've probably heard it more than 100 times, i can doubt that you wouldn't like the whole soundtrack. If you are true Shady, like white rappers flows and want to expand your knowledge about hip hop and it's variant beats, buy this album ASAP, It's just \\"8 Mile\\" away.
6304082428|5.0|I absolutely love this film!  It has become my companion -- whenever I cannot sleep, or just feel low, I pop in the movie and enjoy -- Firth's and Ehle's preformances are magnificent!
B000060P79|5.0|I love Simple Plan adn i love this new album!  all of the songs are really fun and easy to sing along with.  It's constantly in my CD player and i take it with me every where.  The boys are so talented at their insturments and I love Pierre's voice!  This CD is definitly one to buy!
B00003CXA2|5.0|What a total performance Tom Hanks gave in this movie. I am so amazed at his acting skills. From Big, to Sleepless, to Gump to Apollo 13, Cast Away and The Green Mile.<br />This will go down as one of his best works, and is a must have for any DVD collector.
0060537639|5.0|Gavin Menzies definitely succeeds in making a dent in the armor of the traditional historian.  Whether he ends up having all the details right is beside the point.  He has taken the material and suggested another explanation for some of the facts, that just may be more right than even he thinks.  <br />Our European heritage just can't let us imagine that someone else might have been smarter than we.  <br />This book is highly readable in most parts, gets a little detailed on some navigational issues that the lay person might not understand, but he still ends up carrying his thesis through; that there was circumnavigation of the globe prior to when we thought.<br />Historians still don't take the Romans and the Carthaginians seriously about their trips to the North American continent either.  <br />What Menzies really does is strike a blow in the middle of the scholarly camp of evolutionists, who insist we couldn't have been that smart this early in our cave-like existance.  <br />You should read this book just to keep the debate for alternative history moving.  Hooray for Gavin Menzies, Barry Fell, and every other person moved to rethink our historical roots.
B00005JKQZ|2.0|I got this movie because of all the hype. I really didnt care for the story at all. Very depressing. Crowe did  a great job of acting the part, but the overall story didnt grab me.<br />I would save big bucks and rent the DVD first, then decide if you want to spend the bucks to add it to your collection.

0375414053|5.0|I was unable to put this book down.  For this type of genre, it is a five star read.  As the mom of a 20 month old boy, I have felt many of the same pangs as the protagonist Kate Reddy.  Some of it is so real (her son pronounced eyes (ayz) the same way my son did at the time I read the book.  While the book is somewhat of an exaggeration, and I cannot imagine any mother of two young children could possibly keep up Kate's schedule, I was a bit disappointed in her at the end.  Without giving it away, I felt like she sold out, at least for a little while.  Despite that minor criticism, I found myself laughing out loud at some things and nodding in agreement with others.  The observations of how differently men and women who leave work for child-related reasons are preceived was right on.  My book club may consider this one, but I am cautious as the group is made up of working moms and stay at home moms.  I fear the book  might ignite a debate that could stray to the unfriendly side of things.  If you are a mom who works outside the home, I strongly recommend this book.  (I read the British version, purchased off the Amazon UK site and loved it-the U.S. edition may have been \\"Americanized\\")

B000002UAX|5.0|I absolutely love this album and everything on it, but by some fluke i purchased a dud album.  The first disc work fine, but as soon as I start to play the 2nd disc, its an exact duplicate of the 1st CD.  Im fairly sure its not a collectors album, I think they just messed up in the production.  Anyways, my favourite song on the album is Dear Prudence, but Back In The USSR, Glass Onion, Bungalow Bill, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Happiness Is A Warm Gun, well lets just say almost all of Disc 1, and Birthday, Everybody Got Something To Hide, Savoy Truffle are all great as well.  All the other song I didnt mention are also very good, except Revolution #9, but I listen to that song if I need a good laugh.  THE WHITE ALBUM IS THE BEST!!!!  I just hope I can find one that works!
0800130928|5.0|This movie is an excellent expose on masculine loneliness (thus, the title of my review).  Scorsese, De Niro, and Paul Schrader all succesfully convey this emotion in this work; Scorsese through his ambient directing, De Niro through his dyspeptic portrayal of a man caught in an ocean of depression, and Schrader's well eluciated and eloquent script.  What becomes most apparent through extended viewings of this masterpiece, is that the same loneliness that pervades Travis Bickle's life also affects that aftforementioned trio: Scorsese, De Niro, and Schrader.  Through their knowledge and humanness in dealing with loneliness, they collaberated to construct a piece of art.  I, being a man that has known loneliness well, can relate whole-heartedly to this movie, and seeing it presented in the optimum by the construction of this DVD (with illumanting documentarires) makes me thankful.
0385503954|3.0|After all the hype about how amazing this book is supposed to be, I am disappointed.

I wish I had just reread &quot;The Life of Pi,&quot; which is perhaps the best novel I've ever read.
0140277447|4.0|Many historians have labled the Japanese soldiers of WWII as the most bestial and brutal of any modern-era army.  Their atrocities throughout the Pacific during WWII make many Nazi crimes pale in comparison, and the fact that many Japanese are still loathe to admit to the barbarism of its soldiers says a lot.  Japanese schools make no mention of the Chinese slaughtered at the hands of the Japanese during WWII.<br /><br />This is an excellent book, well written, and deeply disturbing.  Perhaps it is almost TOO graphic at some points, but that is up to the reader.  Not for the timid.<br /><br />I see there is a sort of culture war going on here in these reviews.  Ignore the China-bashing and the Japanese denials and read this for yourself.  At the very least it will make you want to investigate deeper.
B00005221M|5.0|Ok, so the story isnt very true to William Fenimore Coopers classic, that does not mean that this movie isnt totally sweet.  The music is SO AWESOME, Daniel Day Lewis is such a badass, and so is everybody else.  There isnt much dialog but thats good.  The movie lets the stunning scenery and score take care of what the actions and sparse dialog dont get across.  I have watched this movie like 5 times and in particular the last 20 minutes or so about a hundred times.  The promontory always gets a lump in my throat.  They are so brave and noble.  They are fighting for vengeance, and for honor, but also to get a grip on the life that they once had control of, but which now has been sent into a turbulent spiral.  Great men living in great times.  Im not sure if I like the added scenes but there arent too many of them, its not really a big deal.  \\"He is Uncas, my son.  Please welcome him at the council fire of my people.  We are all there but one.  I, Chingachgook, last of the Mohicans.  This land is not for me anymore, it is for people like my white son and his woman.  And they too shall fade and will be replaced by others, until there is no frontier.  Others will sweat and bleed, and make this land their own.  But once, we were here.\\"  DAaaaaaa da da daaa da da DADAaaa... dude this movie smashes hard.
B00006AW2J|5.0|Beggar's is one of the Stones' best albums--definitely in the top 3 or 4, behind only Let It Bleed, Exile and Sticky Fingers. Other reviewers have said enough about the songs, so no point in repeating their remarks. The only thing I would add is that if you've got this CD release in its original format (or any of the ABKCO first edition releases on disc), it's DEFINITELY worth your cash to get these 2002 remasters. They sound 100 percent better than before--much more clarity, depth and balance to the music. Better bass, more treble, lots of stuff in there that you'd never heard before. I read an interview with Keef where he was saying even he was surprised when he heard them just how much more of the original instruments/vocals sounds were coming through. And I'm talking about simply stereo through a regular CD player. I can only imagine that if you had a SACD player, it would be that much better.<br />Buy this and other ABKCO re-releases. You'll be glad you did.
B000001FA4|5.0|i was five or six when i heard this album from my father's vinyl collection.  at that age, you are easily drawn into anything that makes sounds (usually).  for me, the unforgettable fire is an album that built on sounds as well as songs.  but more than that... it has atmosphere.<br /><br />there is of course the trademark songs: \\"pride (in the name of love)\\" is great (except i personally find it too overplayed) and the title track is heart wrenching (especially when i found out later that it was inspired by an art exhibit of paintings from survivors of hiroshima).  \\"bad\\" is also great as well.  not there's the issue of the so-called \\"filler\\" songs.<br /><br />the rest of the songs provide a buttress for the major songs.  \\"a sort of homecoming\\" is atmospheric and poetic (like early joyce... chamber music i'm thinking).  \\"wire\\" is intense, angry and probably an early precursor to \\"until the end of the world\\" thematically.  \\"promenade\\" is airy and idyllic.  \\"4th of july\\" is airy and bleak (reminds me a lot of godspeed you black emperor in terms of atmospherics and a connection of apocalyptic ends).  \\"indian summer sky\\" is similar to \\"a sort of homecoming.\\"  \\"elvis presley and america\\" - even if the lyrics are difficult to depicher (bono was under stress and strain becoming up with lyrics) - is an ambient piece that uses effectively a drum set (it's \\"a sort of homecoming\\" played at half-speed).  then \\"mlk\\" is a great closer and one of the best tributary songs i've heard (non-clich&eacute;, simple, haunting and appropriate).<br /><br />it is not an album for everyone.  it is an album that enjoys creating atmosphere and whole complex universes upon listening as oppose to have something passively to listen to or to sing to every song.  i like this album both then and now.  and yes i really believe this sets the stage for their future endeavours.
B00006RIO7|4.0|Wih wild hip hop voculs of jazz it's no wonder it's now became a film.Never hearing the music befor I was swayed into the lyrics and also amused at the same time.With sexy and swavy taste of talent and sounds.Loud voices and music have a blast with this soundtrack.
B00006LLNU|5.0|I might be blaspheming, however, I do believe this group may just be better than radiohead.<BR>On a whim, I attended a Sigur Rs concert in Portland after only a vague introduction to their music.  For its small club venue size, it was the most amazing concert I have ever seen.  This band is definitely the most focused and emotionally devoted to their music that I have witnessed.  I was nearly in tears most of the time myself. <BR>Afterwards I immediately purchased the CD.  Right now I'm buying it for my parents.
B000002KN8|5.0|For those of you not in the know, David Gathan does not playing any of the old Depeche Mode songs.  So very sad for us die hard fans.  Albums like Speak and Spell, A Broken Frame, Construction Time Again, People are People, Black Celebration are the true Depeche Mode I know and love before they got over popular with Music for the Masses, SOFAD, etc.  Its the early albums like these you can really feel some of the raw untamed energy the band really had.  Thankfully, I still have a new album to look forward to from Martin Gore!  Oh how I miss these songs!!!
B000002UB3|4.0|Most of the songs here are very well-done, specifically \\"I Want You\\" and the three-song medley at the end. As far as Beatles albums go, only Sgt. Pepper's (and possibly Revolver, which I haven't heard yet) is better. Although this was recorded in 1969, it sounds a lot like what 70's rock would turn out to be, minus the \\"sex and drugs\\" philosophy that ruined many a halfway-decent band. George plays some excellent guitar here and Ringo is finally starting to make some major contributions to the band. It's too bad that this was the last Beatles album; who knows what they could have done if they hadn't broken up.
0140177396|5.0|This story talks about Migrant Workers. It is set in the Great Depression, Lennie and George are best friends. They always travel around together looking for a job. Lennie is a huge man, but he has his mind like a little child. George is small. He is the one that puts things in order and makes decisions. They are together because they don't want to fell lonely and they wish to have their own house. In this story the characters have funny names about their appearances. For example: Lennie Small is ironic because he is a huge man (big) and strong, and symbolic because his mind is like a kid (small). When Lennie and George are in Weed, Lennie has some problems so they run from Weed and go to another job. In their new job they live in a bunkhouse. Everybody was looking at their relationship. In the new job they meet a lot of people. That is when the struggle begins. George prevents Lennie from having a conflict with some workers. But in some moments Lennie doesn't have George and he cannot guard Lennie from the provocations of a flirtatious woman. The woman doesn't have a name in the story. Probably you can find out why she doesn't have a name?<BR>This is good story. The most important knowledge that you learn from this story is the differences between loneliness and friendship. I thought that at the end something would happen, but I was surprised because other things happened. Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck is a true story about how people lived in the 1929 - 1930's. I give 5 stars to this book.
B000069AUI|5.0|With their first album, Coldplay slipped by my musical radar.  It took a great sophomore album for me to discover their passion.<br />While many new artists strive to be different, while many producers jiggle buttons to &quot;create&quot; music, Coldplay goes blithely about their artistic business, proving that less is more.  Through deceptively simple lyrics, melodies, and vocals, this band reaches for and attains greatness.  Chris Martin delivers heartfelt words with slippery and carefree nuances that actually punctuate the deeper meanings.  The piano and guitar glide together and swirl apart with the grace of a dancing duo.  At the core, the bass and drums drive at full speed or measured restraint, based upon the mood of the song.<br />Going back to explore the first album, &quot;Parachutes,&quot; I heard the wonderful honesty of a band coming to terms with themselves.  Here, on &quot;A Cold Rush of Blood to the Head,&quot; I am awed by the simplicity on a grand scale.<br />Coldplay has done what so many forget: They abandon themselves to their art rather than trying to capture it.
0066214122|5.0|What else can you say to a book like this but, wow. I had so much fun reading it that I finished it in record time and handed it off to my wife. A fun, flippant but disturbing look at nanotechnology and the ramifications of using others theories, as Ian Malcom said, \\"Riding on the shoulders of geniuses.\\"<br />The hero is the \\"stay at home\\" dad with a good sense of humor. You have to wonder if Mr. Crichton has performed this duty himself as it was very well played out and true to form. There is very little time for character buildup, but who needs it when the events are so well put together and new catastrophes unfold on every 10 pages.<br />Crichton has not performed this type of \\"can't put down\\" writing since Jurassic Park. Although the reader figures out the ending way before everyone in the book does, it only adds to your wanting to find out when and how the characters will figure it out for themselves. The end is another great roller coaster ride from a master. Sit back, buckle up and enjoy the ride!
B00003CY0V|5.0|This is a very good movie.  It has a good cast, a good storyline, and a few top-notch action scenes that rival James Bond movies.  John Travolta seems to be the villain in many of todays action movies (Broken Arrow, Face/Off, Battlefield Earth), but in this movie, he plays the best villain of them all.  He doesn't hesitate to pull out a minigun and blow up some cars, or strap bombs filled with ball bearings and blow a street up.  Halle berry looks great in this movie, her hair/chest, clothes, everything looks good.  Hugh Jackman, sporting an aftershave ad hair cut, is a computer hacker who helps travolta get 10 billion dollars.  this is a very good movie if youre looking for an action movie with a little less action, and a little more plot.
B000021YQV|5.0|Man, this CD is definantly one of my favorites. Honestly, how can someone not like it? Heavy, fast, political rock that is as good or better than Rage Against the Machine.<br />Prison Song - Wow, this is such a fast and heavy song, and with a strong political message. 9/10<br />Needles - Very cool vocals on this one, with a super-cool bridge. 9/10<br />Deer Dance - Yet another fast song, but with a slower bridge. It's totally cool, with a good message for peace. 10/10<br />Jet Pilot - A very hard rock song, with somewhat of a hidden message in there. Can you figure it out? 9/10<br />X - This song is my least favorite, but it's still a pretty good song. Through this song, there is no song that is not super heavy and hard. 7/10<br />Chop Suey! - Awesome song, it's really one of the best on the CD. If you haven't figured it out yet, it's a first person narrative from Jesus. Very cool how they hide their meanings. 10/10<br />Bounce - A pogo stick orgy is kinda a wierd thing to sing about, but its still a cool song. 8/10<br />Forest - Another great song, a little similar to Chop Suey! he lyrics on this one are really great. 9/10<br />ATWA - My personal favorite, it's supposed to have something to do with Charles Manson. ATWA stands for Animals Trees Water Air. I'm not totally sure on this one about the meaning, but it's very cool. It's the slowest song on the CD, and it's totally cool. 10/10<br />Science - Another really cool political song, another of my favorites. 10/10<br />Shimmy - It's such a cool song, it's unbelievable. The coolest song on the CD, definantly worth a 9/10<br />Toxicity - Another incredible song, this one slower with a fast chorus. The video is awesome for this one too. 10/10<br />Pyscho - Another fast and crazy song, not as good as most of the stuff. 8/10<br />Aerials - A perfect end to a perfect CD, a great slower song, also a cool bonus track on the end.
B00003CXXM|5.0|You know most of time you read a book and then they make it into a movie and even if they stay very true to the story, you walk away feeling a little disapointed.  Not the case with this movie.  Even though they changed quite a bit about the story, it really works with the cast and the action and the updated setting.  You could see where they wanted to make his character not as ruthless and more likeable but still very effective against the bad guys.  I really liked Matt Damon in this role and Franka Potente gave the character a really quirky, real person feel.  I don't get to see many movies in the theater, but this was one that was definitely worth the money.  I can't wait for it to come out next week on dvd!
B00004Z459|4.0|When I first got this CD, I though it was the greatest thing since sliced cheese. After awhile, however, the novelty began to wear off. Just recently I listened to it again, and I realized why I first loved it. It's still a great CD, I just listned to it to much. I really don't know why it's good. I'm certainly not a &quot;nu-metal&quot; fan, but I can honestly enjoy Linkin Park. It's a good CD to have around.
0446677450|1.0|My opinion of Kiyosaki has only dropped with time. I am now of the opinion that he is a total fraud and that any money he may have made is only from selling these books. The only good point Kiyosaki makes (indirectly) is that the public school system teaches [less] about finances. However, Kiyosaki's \\"solutions\\" are ridiculous.<br />Kiyosaki mouths platitudes like: \\"Don't buy liabilities\\". Duh. Of course you're not going to buy liabilities. -and- \\"Your car is not an asset?\\" Oh really? Tell that to the individual who works two jobs that the ease of commuting that his car affords doesn't make it an asset. The \\"spend your money wisely\\" theme that Kiyosaki touches upon is much better researched and presented in the book \\"The Millionaire Next Door\\".<br />Kiyosaki also makes things like real-estate investment and business building seem like endeavors one can do during the  commercials while watching an episode of \\"Friends\\". Serious investing takes time, dedication and lots and lots of patience. It means combing through hundreds of real estate listings or plowing through voliminous 10-k statements. He mentions one-in-a-million investment opportunities, such as severely discounted properties, as if they were everyday occurrences. He never supports his claims that these opportunities even exist.  Kiyosaki makes the reader believe that one can waltz into a foreclosure auction and pick up a one million dollar house for twenty bucks.<br />There is a most indepth review with backup web links about Kiyosaki available on line. It is more than I could ever do (or ever care to do). It's a very long read, but it's very well-researched...<br />I first read Kiyosaki when I was in college about 5 years ago. After reading his book, I mentioned his \\"points\\" to my successful small-business owning father. My father looked at me and said, \\"That's ridiculous.\\" I didn't agree with him then. I do now.

B00005T7I1|3.0|This is a fun movie all around, Warren Beatty who starred & directed this really understands the Comic-Book elements that fans had come to expect from it, & what a ride it is, the cartoonish characters & scenery is neat to look at, In this Beatty is Tracy who is trying to bring down the mobsters led by Big Boy Caprice, played Al Pacino who has a field day here, not since \\"Scarface\\" has Pacino had such fun with a character, & you can tell he had fun here, Madonna does a pretty good job as Breathless, she is perfect in this character role, many other stars are here as well, such as James Caan as a rival crime boss, Dustin Hoffman as Mumbles, Kathy Bates as a police secretary, Dick Van Dyke as the mayor, Charles During as the police cheif & others such as Henry Silva(Sharkey's Machine), Ed O'Ross(Lethal Weapon), E.G. Marshall(Predator), James Tolkan(Back to the Future), & William Forstyhe(The Rock) as Flatop, & Glenne Headly as Tess, & Paul Sorvino(Goodfellas) as Lips, & who could forget Mandy Panikin(Chicago Hope) as 88 Keys, the piano player, how Beatty assembled this cast is anyone's guess, but they all give it their best, & it works, although released in 1990, it was heavenly critisized by the media, the same way \\"Batman\\" was a year earlier & the way \\"Star Wars\\" is being now, as I have said before, why hype gives people the impression that it is the second coming is a mystery to me, just enjoy movies for what they are, \\"Dick Tracy\\" may not be \\"The Godfather\\", but it is a technical acheivement nonetheless, & is downright fun, & doesn't take itself too seriously, which is good, if you want a serious movie, stay away, but if you want a fun movie with big actors letting loose, then you won't be disappointed here!!!
B00000JTB2|5.0|I have always been a huge fan of Albert King, but this recording is sheer magic. Both he and Stevie are at the height of their powers here, and the interplay and mutual respect between them is absolutely awe inspiring. Albert calls each tunes as the session roles on and Stevie matches him on every turn, even when he is not familiar with the tune. The banter between the songs is priceless. When Stevie plays an Albert King lick, Albert says: &quot;Play that again...That sounds familiar.&quot;  At another point Albert shows him a tune he thinks he should include on his next LP (Matchbox Blues). After they play it he says &quot;You can probably do something with that...but change it like you want it.&quot; Wonderful stuff.<br />I saw Stevie back when he was still playing small clubs in the early eighties and this was how he sounded then. This is one of the best live recordings I have ever heard.
6305622914|4.0|This movie was surprisingly funny!  I originally thought that this one wouldn't be good just on the basis of it's plot but in the end, this movie delivers a lot of laughs and for the ladies, some great male stripping that's really funny.  <br />It starts out with 2 friends, Gazzer and Dave.  Both are recently laid off steel mill workers and are looking for work.  After they get turned away from their favorite bar because of an all ladies Chippendale performance, Gazzer gets a great idea, \\"what if we were strippers?  We'd make a lot of money\\".  Just one problem, there's only 2 of them and they can't dance.  After holding some open tryouts, they find some other guys they used to work with that want to do this as well, including their former foreman that's also unemployed.  While working on their routine, Gazzer realizes that they have to do something special, they have to do THE FULL MONTY (be completely naked).  Now it's a question of who's still in it.<br />O.k. even though I'm a guy, I still laughed at this one because it's still pretty funny.  The guys are really funny, the music and soundtrack is great (a lot of great hits from the 70's) and just because the guys are the most unlikely strippers is pretty funny.  That and this movie took a lighthearted look on some very serious topics like suicide, divorce, homosexuality, unemployment and even the difficulty of being overweight.  You'd be surprised, but this movie might hit somewhere with some people.<br />Ladies will definitely get a kick out of this one and even the guys can take a laugh out of this.  And for any of you guys plotting to do your own type of Chippendales thing, here's an instructional video for you = )  In any case, this is an enjoyable movie.  And who could forget the \\"fun with Garden Gnomes\\" scene?  That scene alone is hilarious.  Anyway, check out THE FULL MONTY and if you're looking for another good International movie, check out WAKING NED DEVINE, CHOCOLAT and this is a good one from Japan, TAMPOPO.  Enjoy!
B00005JL78|5.0|First off, if more people had the level of ambition to try to adapt Philip Dick's work to the screen, we'd be seeing greater and greater movies in this lifetime.  The great thing about \\"Blade Runner\\" was the story; Ridley Scott ended up making a classic movie because he had the guts to attempt something with work that ran that deep.  When I heard that Spielberg, fresh off making \\"A.I.\\", had the guts to work with material adapted from a Dick story, I thought this might end up being a great movie.  Well, it is.<br />Steven Spielberg is at the peak of his powers here and makes a truly great movie, probably the best science-fiction movie in the last 24 years (since \\"Alien\\", and frankly you could argue a case further back).  The story runs deep, and his treatment of it is the work of a great filmmaker.  I'm not someone who's easily impressed - I thought \\"Schindler's List\\" for example was wildly overrated - but this guy here is doing work on par with greats like Kurosawa and David Lean, and possibly exceeding anything that they could do.<br />I am literally awed by this movie.  In a just world, this would have been as big a hit and pop-culture phenomenon as \\"Jaws\\" and \\"Jurassic Park\\" were.  The world is not just, but it is full of great art, and this definitely qualifies.
0767804724|4.0|Okay, so it might be a stretch of the imagination that the presidential jet can sustain hundreds of rounds of machine gun fire. That aside, \\"Air Force One\\" poses the (then) unlikely premise of a terrorist group commandeering the First Plane (maybe not so unlikely now) and how Harrison Ford, as a strict anti-terrorist commander-in-chief, has to abort the plot while saving not only himself but the First Family. Ford, one of the acting business' most professional artists, is absolutely believeable as both the most powerful man in the Free World and a family man, often struggling not to let the lines of both intersect. The multi-talented Gary Oldman (Francis Ford Coppola's \\"Dracula,\\" \\"The Contender\\") is in his element as the thoroughly and dastardly evil leader of the terrorist group, and the incomparable Glenn Close is riveting as the loyal Vice President who refuses to grab the reigns of power as long as her president stays alive. But Close's bigger contribution is her unparalled ability to convey her character's sense of subdued panic while maintaining calm as an uncertain nation looks on. Director Wolfgang Petersen (\\"Das Boot\\") has come up with a terrific nail-biter despite a couple of stretches of imagination. And, as for Ford's role as president, even Indiana Jones would have his hands full with the guy. Fast-moving with seldom a lapse in the action, this one is well worth the watch.
B00005OM4N|3.0|I'm a big Britney fan, but now I realize that this album does not show enough transition. She promised that it will be edgier, but most of it is still the same stuff from the previous albums. Hopefully she learn that lesson on the fourth album. ...

B000002H33|5.0|If you own only one metal album ever, make it this album.  It has everything from thrasher speed numbers like Damage Inc., to an intense majestically orchestrated instrumental in Orion.  Not like newer metal that whines about mommy and daddy, or just kinda comes off like some weak repressed punk kid taking out agrression in music 'cause he can't stand up to the real world, this album stands tall and mature taking on issues like hypocrisy in religion, bioethics in sanitarium, drug addiction, wages of war, etc.  There isn't a weak track on this album.  I've owned this for about 15 years, and it has become a part of my life.  Master, Master!!  Just purchase this album, you can't really live without it (and I don't know how you have if you don't actually have it!)
071198042X|4.0|I have been a long time fan of Freddie's and when someone bought this for me I was thrilled and yet scared. Scared because I have tried on Many occasions to read biographies and failed miserably. Luckily this book was really well done and the topic was close to my heart.<br />The biography is written by a man who obviously loved Freddie and was very close to him in life and affected immenly by his personality. The book covers who Freddie really was to his friends, family and fans. It covers several albums and inspiration behind the music. It also covers his very sad sickness and I must admit I cried quite a bit.<br />I only have one qualm about this book and this is the time line as it jumps around quite a bit. But it is still followable and you can piece it together.<br />However in the end I was left feeling like I really did know Freddie and it gave me a warm feeling inside. Now when I listen to his music it brings back parts of the book to me and helps me build a better picture of the artist that Freddie really was.
B00006RIO7|1.0|By far the worst soundtrack i've ever listened to.  Even if you liked the music in the film you will be tortured by the sounds on this CD
B00005JLEU|5.0|I went to see this in the theater with my teenage dughter and we both loved the movie. Princess Mononoke was my first exposure to anime, and in my opinion, Spirited Away far surpasses that movie.The animation is exquisite, with beautiful colors and motion. It absolutely carries you away to another realm. The plot is not difficult to follow, and the characters are all so memorable, it's hard to single out just one. I especially appoved of the voice-casting, as Princess Mononoke had some jarring problems with voice/character connection. I was surprised to read Suzanne Pleshette's name in the credits, as well as some of the others; they had done such a wonderful job of inhabiting their roles. This movie was made to be aimed at 10 year olds, but it does not shrink away from mature ideas and values. Some parts might be scary to American youngsters, but it wins my approval for ages 10 and up. I can't wait for the DVD.
B000066NW0|5.0|This CD brings me up when I'm feeling bummed and smooths me out when I'm getting anxious.  Again, not a bad track on the whole thing.  It ROCKS, it's truth, it's Avril.  She tells you who she is cause she knows it.  Good for her, some of us never know.<br />You could say that this will be hard to top.  I say she's not doing this to compete with herself or anyone else.<br />Other people are just too picky and have nothing better to do than crab about something.  I say, go back to the trailer park you came from and shut-up !<br />This music is NOT just for teens, it's for everybody, because it is everybody.  Truth.
B000001FA4|5.0|Sure a castle (Ireland's Slane Caste in Meath Co.) may not be one of the most acoustically friendly structures but the ancient setting must have lent U2 a formidable muse in order to turn out this gem.  Out of U2's big back-to-back-to-back triumvirate of The Unforgettable Fire (1984), The Joshua Tree (1987), and Achtung Baby (1991); The Unforgettable Fire is at the height of their artistry.  It is a moodscape with each song seemingly blending into the next and outside of &quot;Pride in the Name of Love&quot;, no real radio-friendly hit.  Speaking to the power of the album though, is the fact that The Unforgettable Fire brought U2 to a broader audience despite not having a litany of hits like Achtung Baby.<br />The Edge really owns this album as his weaved hyper-kinetic seemingly looped guitar work is a wonder to behold.  Bono is lyrically strong and sings with conviction all over the album.  Such does not seem to be the case in the days of &quot;Pop&quot;, &quot;Zooropa&quot;, and the return to form but somewhat inconsistent, &quot;All That You can't Leave Behind.&quot;<br />&quot;Wire&quot; is manic and driving, perhaps the strongest tracks of its kind on the album.  The words are stream of consciousness with Bono all over the map with howls and grunts and sung/rapped/spoken ranting.  It's pretty amazing really.  &quot;Indian Summer Sky&quot; is another dark and driving track in the same vein.  The Edge is edgy here.  The album closes with a beautiful and haunting near-a cappella lullaby hymn titled &quot;MLK.&quot;  I sing this to put my newborn son to sleep at night and it hasn't failed to calm him yet.  The lyrics are simple but effectively convey a sense of rest putting off your worries onto a sacrificial being, &quot;Sleep, sleep tonight and may your dreams be realized. If the thunderclouds passes rain, so let it rain, let it rain, rain on him.&quot;  Beautiful, like the whole of the album, muted and sincere.
B000002KHF|5.0|I'm only 24, and I had the fortune of buying this cd a few years ago on a whim.  I had heard &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot; and recognized a few tracks on the cd (Moondance, Crazy Love), and decided it looked good enough, and was worth it just for Moondance.  <br />All I can say is, this is probably one of the greatest albums of all time; it's just beautiful from start to end.  Every song is musically perfect, with all the tracks and instruments swirling around, it'll remind you of someone you were in love with at one time, or someone you're in love with now.  It's not sappy like McCartney can be sometimes, and it's not too artistic like others get at times; it's just perfect.  Extremely well written, beautiful songs, every song on the album will stick with you.  The best to me are &quot;Moondance&quot; of course, if you haven't heard that song, slap yourself.  &quot;Crazy Love&quot; I never realized Morrison wrote, but his version is twice as good as any cover you've ever heard.  &quot;Into the Mystic&quot; is just beautiful, beautiful stuff.  &quot;Caravan&quot; is a little rowdy, very soulful.  &quot;And it Stoned Me&quot; is a great song; really, you can just go down the line, they're all great.  &quot;These Dreams of You&quot;, another classic, perfect song.  I really can't say enough about this album, it's amazing.

B00005JL7Q|5.0|\\"About a Boy\\" is a great romantic comedy based on Nick Hornby's best-selling novel. [I haven't read it.] It's not an ordinary entry in its genre because of its points of view [those of an eleven year old boy who's old for his years and a thirty-eight year old man who's never grown up] and its refusal to follow the normal boy-gets-girl formula. The story could easily have veered into the maudlin and sentimental, but directing brothers Chris and Paul Wiesz [\\"American Pie\\"] inject wit and often acerbic humor at just the right moments. <br />Will [Hugh Grant] lives off the royalties from a hit song his decesased father wrote. He keeps telling himself that the axiom `No man is an island' is no longer true in our world filled with technological marvels. He uses his money to live well and his good looks to get women. One day he discovers the world of single mothers and decides to invent a child of his own in order to charm these women. The plan works well enough at first, but when he meets a lonely boy [Nicholas Hoult] and his depressed mom [Toni Colette], he finds himself in a situation where, for the first time in his life, someone else's happiness might be more important than his own. <br />Hugh Grant is an acting treasure. The movies today are filled with plenty of tough guys and rough guys, sweet ones and soft ones. Grant is one of the few actors around who are charming, funny and sophisticated in a loveable bad boy way. This may be his best performance to date - other contenders include \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\" and \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\". Newcomer Nicholas Hoult is great, playing the boy as eccentric and worldly wise rather than as cute and cuddly. Toni Colette plays his mother and is superb as always. <br />There have been several decent romantic comedies in the last year or so, but \\"About a Boy\\" is one of the few I can describe as \\"Brilliant!\\"
B000066JES|4.0|This CD has it's excellent points, it's good points, and maybe one bad point. First off, the excellent points. The songs \\"Call To Arms,\\" \\"Warriors Of The World United,\\" \\"Hand of Doom,\\" \\"House of Death,\\" and \\"Fight Until We Die\\" are all what fans of the Kings of Metal would expect: Hard, heavy, and brutal! (\\"House of Death\\" has to be one of the most brutal Manowar songs I've heard so far.) \\"Swords in the Wind/Valhalla\\" are nice ballads done in classic Manowar style. \\"Fight For Freedom\\" borders on excellence in my opinion, with a positive message that encapsulates the American Spirit. \\"Nessun Dorma\\" and \\"An American Trilogy\\" are both very nicely done, once you get past the shock of hearing Eric Adams sing opera and Elvis. \\"The March\\" is just \\"eh;\\" It's just an intrumental and a cheesy one at that. But overall, the good far outweighs the bad on this CD in my opinion. Buy it if you're a fan of Manowar and if you're prepared for a couple of surprises.

B000004286|5.0|In short, Braveheart is a story of a Scotsman who rallied his compratriots to fight for freedom from the English, but it is so much more than that. It is fitting that much of it was filmed in Athlone, Ireland, because Irish people share an affinity with the Scots that goes back to our Celtic origins. This is why I love the scene in the movie where the Irish conscripts join their Scottish brethren on the battlefield to fight their common foe, the English.<br />This is just a little of the background to why I love the score to this movie so much. Watching it and listening to the music made me want to get up out of my chair and don a broadsword and shield on many occasions. The victory theme in the &quot;The Battle of Stirling&quot; truly made my heart soar and made me proud to be a Celt.<br />The love themes throughout this CD are touching to say the least, as are the more downright depressing numbers. After Gladiator, I thought there was no other music that could touch the senses as much as Zimmer's did for me... I was wrong.<br />Buy it! A movie score that has all your emotions wrapped up in 78 minutes. Enjoy.
B000063DFN|4.0|Two minutes to midnight to me is one of the great heavy metal songs of all time, great riff, great lyrics. Aces high another great song. Powerslave another great song about how eygptian kings were viewed as god like. Back in the village another great rocker with great lyrics. The ancient mariner a little long based on coleridge's poem.

B000063DI9|5.0|The strenght in this cd lies in the songs Moonchil, Can I play with Madness, Seventh Son, the prophecy, and the Clairvoyant. Great guitar passages throughtout and at timely places whether electric or accoustic. It's not quite as heavy as other maiden cd's but still it is excellent.
0452282152|2.0|&quot;I was chopping vegetables in the kitchen when I heard voices outside our front door--a woman's, bright as polished brass, and a man's, low and dark like the wood of the table I was working on. They were the kind of voices we heard rarely in our house. I could hear rich carpets in their vioces, books and pearls and fur.<BR>    I was glad that earlier I had scrubbed the front steps so hard.<BR>    My mother's voice--a cooking pot, a flagon--approached from the front room&quot;<br />Most of the prose is unsophisticated, but might have been fine considering it is written in first person and the protagonist is young teenager, but ridiculous passages like this (from the first page) stand out. The strained metaphors only get worse as you read on. The characters are unsympathetic and worse, unbelieveable, and the plot is paper thin.
B00005JKGK|4.0|This movie is a favorite because of its focus on mother\daughter relationships and its epic format.  I was immediately immersed in the story from the first scene.  It has flaws... a bit melodramatic and chinese men get the &quot;screw&quot; big-time. Overall however, its a wonderful movie and the performances are moving and inspired.  Rent it for a test run... then buy it.  Its one that you'll want to watch again and again.
7119005901|5.0|&quot;What of the typos and errors?&quot; whine some reviewers. &quot;Or the tediousness of the story as a whole?&quot;, cry others. One even proposes the introduction of a television show based upon the events of the Three Kingdoms, so as to alleviate the &quot;dullness&quot; within this epic. So, before I begin my review, I must submit a brief warning: <BR>   If you possess the attention span of a five year old, have the vocabulary skills of a newborn (all errors can be corrected mentally, within seconds of their discovery)or prefer movies to books, than this is not for you. Hopefully anyone that suffers from all three ailments has not defiled this book by even considering its purchase. Enough ranting. To the book itself. <BR>   This is a passport to the ancient China of lore, where great heroes mingled with Taoist sorcerers, where the pageantry and lavishness of the Emperor's court was matched only by the suffering of the peasants at the other extreme. This is the China of the treacherous yet mighty Lu Bu, the wise Zhuge Liang, and the ambitious Cao Cao. And lastly, this is the China of the Three Kingdoms: Wu, Wei and Shu.  <BR>   From the rout of the Yellow Scarves in the opening scenes of the novel to the fall of Wu and the unification of the Empire over a hundred years later, this story flows seamlessly, intricately weaving the clash and bloodshed of battle with the scheming and intrigue that fills the tale's early pages. This is a blend of fiction and fact, after all, so Luo Guanzhong does not have the ability to twist the plot in any one direction (though Liu Bei emerges as a hero to Cao Cao's brutal villain)and so some of the lesser fights are told matter-of-factly.        <BR>     However, there is something about The Three Kingdoms - the Taoist magic, the great warriors, the colorful picture that the author paints of palace life - that keeps it fresh, and wipes away the dryness that fills other legends. While Jiang Wei's endless string of defeats at the end of the novel appears to grow old, it is only because the reader has grown so attached to the Kingdom of Shu that its losses are your losses, and so, when Liu Shan capitulates so suddenly, you are disgusted. But it had to occur, did it not? As promised in the novel's opening line: <br />&quot;The empire, long united, must divide. The empire long divided, must unite. So it has been...&quot;
B000002UB3|5.0|1969's &quot;Abbey Road&quot; is a historic recording for a number of reasons.  It has one of the most recognized covers in rock history; it's the final album the Beatles recorded, and it features &quot;Come Together,&quot; a Number One single that shows the foursome at its most soulful and bluesy.  As with all Beatles albums, the majority of the tracks are Lennon/McCartney compositions, but I will be bold enough to say that two of the strongest cuts on &quot;Abbey Road&quot; are written by neither John nor Paul.  That honor belongs to George Harrison's &quot;Something&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the Sun,&quot; which stand as the quiet Beatle's most stellar work, in my opinion.  Not that Harrison steals the show on &quot;Abbey Road.&quot;  I also dig the twang of McCartney's agreeable &quot;She Came in Through the Bathroom Window,&quot; as well as &quot;Oh Darling.&quot;  &quot;Abbey Road&quot; is one of those records that's as much a contribution to history as to music.  If you're not at all familiar with this CD, not only do you have my sympathy, but you are also urged to get it and take a journey down this impressive &quot;Road.&quot;
0618001905|2.0|Although Adam Hochschild's work is admirable it is not the masterpiece it is made out to be. In fact the author's holier-than-thou attitude and his un-nuanced view of foreign affairs in the late Nineteenth Century, makes his book an irritating read. Irritating because the Congo deserves better: with so much horror and so much bloodshed, the author really did not have to pepper his literature with his own chewed out opinions. He should have let the facts and the stories speak for themselves. Additionally, he should have taken more time to fit the Congo into its historical perspective. Narrative history should show some balance, this book doesn't.
B00004RFFS|5.0|I personaly am a huge fan of Anne Rice books. This was one of the best adaptations from book to movie I've seen. Unlike almost all Stephen King books, which are great, the movies always seem disappointing to me. The settings and music were great and the actors played their roles perfectly. I didn't think I would like Tom Cruise as Lestat but he did a wonderful job and everytime I reread one of the vampire books from Anne Rice I always think of Tom Cruise as Lestat. I highly reccomend this movie to anyone interested in vampire movies, it definately adds a new twist to the common vampire genre.
B00006RIO7|5.0|I bought the soundtrack to Chicago before I actually saw the movie. I had rather high expectations for Catherine Zeta-Jones, knowing that she was from a musical theater background. I was a little more skeptical about Renée Zellweger and Richard Gere's vocals, though Gere DID play Danny Zuko in his high school's production of Grease. Needless to say, that didn't give me too much confidence.<br />Chicago's soundtrack is unlike any soundtrack I have ever heard before. From the very first note heard, until the very last, you are moved from your living room to Chicago, 1920s. Danny Elfman's score, the songs themselves, and even the vocal style of the singers (except for, possibly, the speaking parts in &quot;Cell Block Tango&quot;) all sound as if they were recorded by singers from the Twenties.<br />The standout tracks on this disc are &quot;Overture/All That Jazz&quot;, &quot;Cell Block Tango&quot;, and &quot;I Move On&quot;, an original song written for the movie, with the hopes of being nominated for a &quot;Best Original Song in a Film&quot; Grammy or Oscar.<br />Certain songs are well enough on their own, but enhanced greatly by seeing them on screen as well. Some of these tracks are: &quot;Roxie&quot;, &quot;We Both Reached For The Gun&quot;, and &quot;Nowadays/Hot Honey Rag&quot;.<br />Anastacia contributes a great song to the soundtrack, which also sounds very...Chicago. The only odd song on here is the Queen Latifa/Lil Kim/Macy Gray version of &quot;Cell Block Tango&quot;. It's just unnessecary and brings down the disc some. Besides that, the soundtrack is worth buying. It's beyond worth buying. It should be mandatory.
6304779356|5.0|I love movies that you can take both seriously and laugh at and this is one of those movies. This movie brings a new twist to the vampire genre while not forsaking it all together. Lost Boys also has some twists in it to keep you wondering while laughing at some of the charaters trying to fend off the vampire gang. This movie also has one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard. Every song gives you the feel of where the movie is taking you. I highly reccomend this movie to everyone.
019431510X|3.0|One problem with the Oxford University Press is that she gives similar titles (i.e.: names) to a variety of products. This &quot;Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary&quot; has close to ten variants. And, although most of them are good, there are a few bad eggs. Buyers should pen-down the ISBN numbers of the one they are interested in, if they do not want any misunderstanding.<BR>This particular edition is among the good ones, but be aware that it has got some bad 'cousins'.
B00005JKWJ|4.0|Blade was a great movie and I actually liked it a little better then Blade II but if you are into action this is the movie for you. The first quarter of this movie tells the story and explains a few thing then the rest of it is one long ... action sequense. Of course, Wesley Snipes plays Blade to perfection, he is the comic book hero of a new era. There are a few twists to keep you guessing and thinking a, little bit, thoughout the movie which with the brutal violense makes this movie great.
B00006F83Y|4.0|Their latest effort is actually the first album I've had the pleasure of listening to by this band. Although the fake \\"DJ\\" interludes range from humorous to tiresome, the album stays steadily in the grunge rock groove. I must admit, one of the main reasons I like this album so much is that it seems to me very Soundgarden-esque. That being said, I'll try to describe the sound and  feel of the album.<br />The pounding guitars throughout the album make sure your brain knows this is definitley a rock album. They ooze grunge throughout this record by combining those pounding guitars with a nice rhythm at times. Another thing I like about this album is that the bass guitar is allowed to do it's job of building the foundation for the sound. As for the drums, you may expect having Dave Grohl on board would give you some exceptionally strong feeling of \\"wow\\", but they do seem to under-emphasize this particular instrument (despite other comments of 'over-mixed drums). I'd say that the vocalist (Josh Homme) shines on 'Songs For The Deaf' I especially found interesting the use of mis-matched tempo between the vocals and the guitars. One one hand you have this driving guitar beat and on the other, a drawn out, slow-paced vocal track. It's quite effective at strengthening the overall impact of the songs that utilize this technique.<br />If I had to name a downside to this album, I'd mention that while they have a great sound, it doesn't seem very diverse. All of the songs (with 1 or 2 exceptions) feel similar, like a magnet to your ears and a weight on your head (and that's a good thing). Some of the songs seem to make use of similar riffs, albeit implementing them in different ways.<br />A few notable songs:<br />'No One Knows' is a very catchy song, yet carries a bit of weight to it.<br />'Six Shooter' seems to be just a tyrade of nothingness, which seems to be that one 'stand out' song on the album which everyone wonders how it got there.<br />'God is in the Radio' Another heavy song with a bouncy, melodic beat. Good lyrics in this song \\"God is naked through the stereo\\". I could see this being a radio song.<br />'A Song for the Deaf' A good title track, placed near the end (track 13) serves to anchor this album as firmly as it was planted in track 1. Some usage of noise and more whining guitars show a glimmer of diversity not found in most of the other songs.<br />'Mosquito Song' (tr 14) An acoustically played song as good and deep as any on this album. Some Zeppelin-ish rolling guitar flicks combined with a synthesized wind instrument kind of thing allows the listener to \\"listen to the leaves\\" in this great song.<br />'Everybodys Gonna Be Happy' (tr 15) This, is without a doubt, the most unique song on the album. It's got a peppy title, which transfers into the lyrics and tone of the song. Complete with hands clapping to the beat, this song could have come from the 60's hippy era, or from a band like Iron Butterfly.<br />I would surely recommend this album to any fan of the grunge side of the alternative genre, or rock period. And, as a fluke, the radio hit does actually give you a good idea of what to expect on the album, since most of it stays in the same spectrum of sound.song with a bouncy, melodic beat.

B00005JKWJ|5.0|this is propbably one of my favourite movies. What i mainly like about the movie is that it is one of the best comic stories turned into a movie (apart from spiderman). The movie also did have a great story plot and i enjoyed the action and the sound track. One of my favourite scenes is the intro or very beggining where blade chases after the vampires on the motor bike and then threatens to push the vampires face down into the motor bikes wheel while it was spinning. If you can't handle gore you propbably won't like this movie seeming there is alot of gore. i recomend this movie to people aged 11 to 30 though if you where 11 it would propbably be best you watch it with your friends or parents and especially do not watch it at night(it gave me nightmares).
B00005JKTF|3.0|...the story of Charlotte Gray, who risks her life as a spy behind the enemy line during the WW2, is all based on the historical truth about those brave women who parachuted into France occupied by Germany...  \\"Charlotte Gray,\\" starring Cate Blanchett as the title role, is a film not to be missed for me.  And it's Cate Blanchette, so many films in these four years, and not a single bad performance with so many different roles.  So why not see this?  But sorry, I was very disappointed with it (not Cate, who is fabulous as ever).<br />Charlotte Gray, as I said, is an English secret agent in occupied France with the false identity.  But her original motive was more than love for the country (which she has plenty); she wanted to seek for information on her missing love who was shot down in France.  But after she landed there, she realizes that her mission is far more dangerous than she thought, and moreover, she has to be in charge of two boys who, if found by the authority, are certain to be sent to concentration camps.  While deeply engaged in her work with the Resistance leader Billy Crudup, and his father Michael Gambon, her original purpose is forced to give way to more immediate needs; that is, survival of herself and her mates.<br />The director Gillian Armstrong gives gorgeous costumes and pictures of France.  As she did in her excellent \\"Little Women,\\" Gillian Armstrong gives very credible portrait of countryside, but as to the script, the result is simply lamentable.  Many flaws can be seen -- uneven pace and unfocused tone of the whole picture, for instance -- but the most damaging is very unconvincing love story between the characters.  Despite the best efforts from Blanchett, Billy Crudup does not look like a guy with whom Charlotte is likely to fall in love.  Even the main character Charlotte's actions are inconsistent, sometimes making us wonder what she really wants to do.<br />Inconsistent may be the best way describe the film's flaws.  After trained inBritain to speak French fluently, Charlotte drops her French language completely once she arrived at the country.  Is this for subtitle-phobias?  If so, they should have known that such careless decision for mainstream audience would kill the reality of the film.<br />But as for cameleon-like Cate Blanchette, she deserves unanimous praise from all of us, who have seen her films with wonder.  Most regreattable thing is that obviously Billy Crudup is no match for her, and even veteran Michael Gambon suffers from the  underwritten screenplay.  \\"Charlotte Gray\\" is, therefore, for those fans who want to see another testimony that Cate is one of the best actresses of 21st century.  But you already know that her brief shining presence in \\"Lord of the Rings\\" did the same job, and much better.
B00004Y7SF|3.0|I give it 3 stars. Some songs are cool and some could've been better. I didn't see the need for track #10. It could've been replaced with a song...But overall it's ok!
B00007BH5C|5.0|...<br />This soundtrack CD is worth writing about. That is it, as simple as that.<br />I don't know how many times I'd been listenning to this daily, and not sure how many times already for today alone.<br />I understand that someone who listenned to FotR might be disappointed about this soundtrack. However, please also understand that the theme for these two stories are different (as they were in the original books). Considering the theme and tone of the Two Towers, the music composed for it was outstanding, and astronishing.<br />It would be difficult for me to answer, if I was asked which track(s) I like best, as I like most, if not all, of them.<br />Here are some that I'd like to say what I think of:<br />\\"Forth Eorlingas\\" is a very grand theme, which open quietly but gradually gain the power through the middle, and its ending is dramatic. <br />\\"Hornburg\\" protrays well the image and grandness the Hornburg of the fortress Helm's Deep, which (according to the book) was describe as \\"as was built by the hands of giant\\".<br />\\"Isengard Unleashed\\" is a very dynamic theme. It combines a lot of things, a lot of elements, with some twist of feeling toward the end as the fate of Isengard's force is changing.<br />\\"The White Rider\\" is another good theme, with great opening and ending.<br />This doesn't mean that I don't equally like the rest. I, as mentioned before, like all of them.<br />Also, don't miss the OST of FotR, which also contains many nice pieces of music, like \\"The Black Rider\\", \\"A Knife in the Dark\\", \\"Bridge of Khazad Dum\\", etc.<br />Nevertheless, The Two Towers OST stands well on its own feet. It can be listened well, even you never seen the film, as it captured the imaganition and feeling well.<br />Definitely worth a recognition in the Hall of Fame.
B00005AQE8|5.0|I haven't listened to all of 2pac's albums yet but I doubt that there's one better than this one. So many songs I love! I give this album 5 stars all the way!<br />~R.I.P 2Pac~
B00000AFFF|4.0|...because Costello and Bacharach are not meant for each other, artistically, stylistically, or in any other aspect concerning the work presented here. Let's face that, accept it, and sit back and enjoy this collaboration anyway.  It is seamless. Two hardcore musicians who can't screw up much no matter what.<br />And I'll give you this, too:  Elvis was gracious and respectful throughout this album. Burt got the lion's share of the coverage here.<br />Yes, it's Burt's album all the way.  It's his style, romantically.<br />Therefore, it made me want to put on a red velvet sheath dress with a slit up to the knee, stick a gardenia in my hair, and lie around on a piano singing in some smoky nightclub about loves lost long ago.  Sort of cool, once in a while, to get out that old desire, from some back drawer in your head, to be a smoky nightclub chanteuse.<br />Yep: They are such great musicians they can pull this album off.<br /> Oh--and I love you, Elvis.  You can do no wrong.
B000006TRV|5.0|The Wall is plain and simple one of Pink Floyd's best albums, and is easily along with Atom Heart Mother and Dark Side of the Moon my favorite Floyd album. The only other Floyd one I have is their totally insane album Ummagumma that though it does have an awesome live disc and has some decent moments on their experimental studio disc, for the most part just isn't all it's cracked up to be. But The Wall thankfully is nothing like that one. Every song is just unique with some notable highlights being the Another Brick trio, Young Lust, One of My Turns, Comfortable Numb and In The Flesh. But really this is the only album that I've ever listened to that definitely deserves to be listened to all the way through with no breaks in between, and each and every song relies on each other to make this the most cohesive album I've ever heard. I can't even imagine listening to certain songs by themselves out of the context of the album. In my opinion one should only hear Pink Floyd's The Wall in it's entirety or not at all. This is just a really awesome album that I believe everyone should own. The Wall all the way!!
B00003CXZ1|3.0|We all know Angelina Jolie is a great actress, but most of her acting talents are put aside in place of her other &quot;assets&quot; in this big screen adaption of the video game hit.  Director Simon West (Con Air) directs with his usual big action packed style, but some parts of the film can be just mindnumbingly dull.  Jolie is picture perfect as Lara Croft and is as beautiful as ever, but believe it or not her true acting talents could have brought so much more to the film, but the lacking script can be partly to blame on that.  Jolie's real life father Jon Voight plays her late father in the film, and Noah Taylor (Vanilla Sky) is humerous as Lara's bumbling helper.  All in all, those craving some mindless action with some gorgeous eye candy should give Tomb Raider a look.
B00003CXS4|4.0|I thought that this movie was really good. It had a lot of funny parts and a good storyline. I thought that The big black guy was funny as the get-away driver and Brad Pitt was a great boxer. The squeeking dog was also funny.
B00006RIO7|5.0|I saw Chicago for the first time the day it hit theaters.  I instantly fell in love with the performers and the music.  Immediately after the soundtrack [was released] I ordered it.  The best songs are definetely the overture/all that jazz where Zeta-Jones shines vocally.  Number three:  When you're good to mama is an excellent showing of Queen Latifah.  Cell Block Tango has such power and sex appeal in the vocals and the music.  Mister Cellophane is a great song in which John C. Reily does an amazing job.  His voice is beautiful.<BR>    All in all, this soundtrack is amazing!  The last two additional songs aren't as good. But I reccommend buying this album for a great music listening time!  Or should I say a rockin' music listening experience!
B00006690G|4.0|In the beginning there was The Slim Shady LP. This album introduced us to Eminems sick sense of humor. It was almost entirely fun and games. Then there was The Marshall Mathers LP. This was the same, but it added raw anger to the mix to make something that was only half-joking. Now we have The Eminem Show. This CD killed Slim Shady save a couple of tracks and mostly took the sick sense of humor out, and replaced it with other things. Pain, politics, and (who would've thought) love. He matured. This scared away a lot of fans, but Im glad he progressed.<br />One of my favorite things about this album is that its very diverse. There are two Slim Shady tracks (Without Me, My Dads Gone Crazy) to give the Shady fans something, at least. The first one is a mostly a diss track and youve all heard it. The second reminds us that even if hes gotten a little more normal, he still has his sick sense of humor and hes still a drug addict. Theres a couple political tracks(White America, Square Dance). The first one cusses out the government, plus it talks about how hes sold records because of his controversy and skin color. The second is partly about how tough he is, but its not really as focused. I dont know how I feel about these because I doubt Eminem knows very much about politics, but they make things more interesting. Theres some tracks about how theres been a lot of pain in his life and his fans(Cleanin' Out My Closet, Sayin' Goodbye to Hollywood, Sing for the Moment). The first tells you why he hates his mom so much and the second is about how fame is tough. These are pretty good, but not my favorites. The third one is. Its a different kind of thing because its about his fans' pain, not his. But I like it because its not just about him and I can sort of relate to it, even though theres not a lot to complain about in my life. Since its a cover of a rock song, it also ends with a really good guitar solo. Theres a few \\"Im so tough, so dont [mess]with me\\" tracks(Soldier, When the Music Stops,Say What You Say). Soldier is the angriest song on here, and gives me an anger release song that this album is usually lacking. The second is a D12 track thats better than almost anything on the D12 album. The third is a Dr. Dre track warning off anybody who would dare oppose Em or Dre. Theres a few mutant tracks that dont fit in any of the other categories. Business is an upbeat track about how Eminem is skilled and an essential part of rap. Good beat by Dr. Dre. Drips and Superman are both misogynist tracks, and I dont like either one. Hailies Song sticks out for a few reasons. One is that its about how he loves somebody (his daughter) instead of how he wants to murder them. The other is that he sings. No, Im not joking. The other reviews all probably mention it. He isnt terrible but he isnt great either. I would like that track better, except he swears in the intro...before the song even starts. He doesnt even sound happy when he says it. Also, he uses this track to hate on his wife. Putting hate in your love song isnt cool. The last mutant track is Till I Collapse. Its about how hes really skilled and doesnt get the respect he deserves, but the good part is that the skill and flow here is amazing. Its proof that lyrically Eminem is unbeatable, and Nate Dogg makes it even better.<br />This album isnt as angry, dark, or vulgar as The Marshall Mathers LP. The beats vary as much as the tracks. Some are soft to make sure you concentrate on Eminems aggressive raps. Some are fast with a lot of drums, some are slow and brooding. The skits are nothing special. All of them minus the intro and outro involve guns. Theres ups and downs on this CD, but I think the dissing was getting old and its good he moved on. This CD has a real, more long-lasting appeal. If youre getting sick of Eminem or just want his sick sense of humor and disses, dont get this. But if you want a more mature Eminem, and dont mind a change in sound, check this out.<br />Closing Comments:It helps that the lyrics are in the booklet.

These two left Weed to Soledad where they attemped to realize their dreams which is to get their own land and have a good life, not to spend their money at a cat house. Since they are not lonely like the other migrant workers. Lennie and George have each others.<BR>This book is wonderful and at the same time sad.I recommand this book because it exlains the value of friendship ,how the migrant workers are lonely,how they live and what their dreams are.In this book i love the innocent Lennie as well as George who did his best to protect his only and best friend.
B00005AFVR|5.0|Like many young adults in America, I remember Bruce & the E Street Band from their heyday in the 80's. The \\"Born To Run\\" album is still fresh in my mind to this day. That was back when Bruce & Company played 4-hour shows each evening. Although I'd never seen one, I did listen to part of one on the radio. <br />     Some years back I had a chance to listen to \\"Live 1975-1985\\" by Bruce & The E Street Band. Taken for what it was at that time, it was great. Mind you, it was recorded at different dates and places over a 10-year stretch, ranging from clubs to stadiums. So you essentially got the full effect of his live career up to that point. <br />     \\"Live in New York City\\" was a Christmas present from my mom in December 2002. While I liked the last live collection, this one is better than its predecessor. There are a number of reasons. First, Bruce & the E Street Band hadn't played together live since the Tunnel of Love Tour (they did record some new songs for the greatest hits cd, but played no live gigs together afterwards). So, you're listening to 9 people playing together after a long break. Their playing has matured, both individually and collectively. Secondly, this current line-up is the first to feature 3 different lead guitarists-Bruce, Steve Van Zant, and Nils Lofgren. Their playing styles are so different, and yet the chemistry works. I think that having all 3 guitarists play together actually gives the music a shot of adrenaline. <br />    But one of the noticably changes is that the songs take on a new look. Most of the music here has been chnaged a little. I know that some of the other reviewers didn't like this. I personally thought it was great. After all, who wants to hear the same music, by the same band, played the exact same way all these years later? You could buy \\"Live 1975-1985\\" if you wanted to hear the songs in thier original format. I think the facelift that these songs got were an excellent idea. <br />     But perhaps the best part of thislive collection was that it was recorded over 2 nights. You get the same 9 people jamming full throttle on the same tour, during a 10-night run at Madison Square Garden. This added some continuity that the last live collection didn't have. <br />    If I had to change anything about this collection, I would have added a third disc and included more music. A lot of Bruce's old catalog unfortunately didn't make it here. But that's only a minor suggestion. <br />     To those that didn't like this live set, I think it's because they're holding Bruce & the E Street Band up to old standards. Instead, they should take them for what they are right now. <br />     Kudos to Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band! Here's to the future!

076790382X|5.0|This is a good read, funny and self-deprecating, but also full of the rabid insanity that passes for daily life in these United States when one sees it from the perspective of a good, honest corn-fed American who has lived outside this particular box for a while. <br />Here is a man who reads newspapers, not just one, and not just the headlines on the front page, but the briefs and the page 13 stories that sharp-eyed, cynical and probably subversive editors find a way to tuck into the paper when they can. Check out \\"Drug Culture,\\" \\"Hotel California,\\" and particularly interesting, and still (the book was published in 1998) oddly relevant if you glance at, say, the New York Times, \\"Why Everyone is Worried,\\" and \\"Those Boring Foreigners.\\"<br />There are also good bits, done by a truly funny man, on how to piss off a nun, the folly of flying, a chicken-or-the-egg discussion on walking. There is also, inevitably TV; \\"The Wasteland,\\" \\"Commercials, Commercials, Commercials,\\" free speech; \\"Spinning the Truth,\\" and a wide variety of other delights. <br />A reviewer from Canada mentioned differences between the U.S. and British editions of the book. I have not seen the U.S. edition (the British edition is called simply \\"Notes from a Big Country), but it will be interesting to sit down and see what the U.S. publisher felt it needed to add or subtract.<br />Martin Amis had a similarly good run in his \\"Moronic Inferno,\\" but Amis was much more serious about the whole thing, and later also moved to the U.S. And one wonders what to make of the fact, is it that the U.S. is bigger, and so by the law of averages simply provides more grist for the mill, or are they, and people like Gore Vidal (pretty much everyting), and Michael Moore (check out \\"Stupid White Men\\") on to something?  <br />Brian Anderson<BR>Cologne, Germany

B00005JLRR|5.0|I, like many star trek fans, have been waiting for years for this flim, downloading all the trailers, reading news and info, so when it came out I was in the first showing. Was I disapointed NO!. The film had everything from the battles to the marrige of riker and troi(something we all wanted to see). But like all films to was'nt perfact(like any movie is) some of the characters were underused but it would be very hard to make a story that would allow all characters a fair go. <br />The Character of shinzon was one hell of a bad guy, much better then Ru'afo from Insurrection, shinzon is more like the borg queen, my fav. Rom Perlman as the reman viceroy was exalent.<br />So the film way not have done so well at the Box office but that does't make it a bad film just underrated, if more people just started to ignore the critics and just go and see the movie then I think it could have done much better. It has what every movie goer wants action, action, action and for die hard astar trek fans it gives us a lot as well. Lets just hope that Paramount do a good job on the DVD when it comes out.

B00000JLWW|4.0|The special effects were really touted as being top-notch. I beg to differ. I think they were just okay. They were better on a large screen in the theater, but still not great.<br />The story, although fairly well known, is still pretty captivating. The romance factor is not overdone, so it is tolerable for even most hardened viewers. Still, it may be a tear-jerker for some, making it a good &quot;date&quot; movie.
0451191153|5.0|The Fountainhead is no simple book; it discusses society in some of the deepest and most unique ways I have ever read.  What starts out as an eloquent yet simple tale about Howard Roark the striving architect becomes a struggle to maintain man's individualism.  The true hero of this novel is egotism, while selflessness, as surprising as it might seem, is the evil.  This is easily one of the greatest, most profound, books I have ever read.  By the end of this book you will be thinking really deeply about your personal ideals and societies.  Sure, it is not short but it is definitely worth the length!

B0000648WZ|1.0|...as someone said to my wife before we went to see the film.<br />If you want a gory special effects bonanza, this might be a good film for you. If, on the other hand, you are like me and a fan of RAH's novel, DO NOT waste your time on this dog. Every bit of Heinlein's social commentary was stripped out and replaced by the director's spin on things. The coolest science fiction part of the novel, the powered armor that defined the Mobile Infantry, is gone, as is the combat drop technique Heinlein described. The characters in this film are ones you have no empathy with, most of the time you're just as happy when you see them killed off as you are to see them survive.<br />I will say that despite hating the movie for what it did to one of my favorite novels, I was very impressed by the some of the scenes, as for example the one where thousands of bugs are overrunning an outpost. However, 2 minutes of enjoyment out of an entire movie aren't enough to make it worth watching. Watch the trailer, it was the best part of the whole movie.
0790729342|5.0|There are certain movies that become classics the moment they are released.  \\"The Road Warrior\\" is such a movie.<br />While not necessary to understand this movie, it is helpful to watch \\"Mad Max\\" to understand how Mel Gibson came to be the person he is in this movie.  In \\"Mad Max\\" we see Mel's family brutalized by a motor cycle gang in a post-apocalyptic Australia.  After exacting his revenge on the gang, he drives off into the sunset, literally.<br />\\"The Road Warrior\\" shows Max still essentially a nice guy, but interested in continuing to drive into the sunset.  At the beginning of the movie Max is in serious need of a gas station, and finds one in the middle of the desert, besieged by a gang of hot rodders led by an apparently deformed Humungus.<br />The story line is simple.  The people at the desert refinery want to pack up their gasoline and move off to a place where there are more people, food, and perhaps some remnant of civilization.  Max wants a tank of gas.  In order for the desert people to look for the better place, they need a semi tractor to carry off their gasoline.  Max still wants his tank of gas.  Here is where the two needs meet.  In exchange for helping the refinery people, Max will get all the gas he can carry.<br />Max seeks out and finds a semi tractor, and manages, as part of one of the best chase scenes of all time, to get the tractor back to the refinery.  With a variety of violent interludes, comes the time to move the gas, which involves another, even better chase scene that lasts pretty much to the end of the movie.  The last chase scene is best experienced in surround sound with the biggest screen you can find.  Turn the sound up.<br />Each incident in the chase is carefully choreographed so that the viewer won't miss a minute of action, of which there is a lot from the time that everyone bails out from the refinery.  Arrows, guns, car (if you can call some of these behemoths cars) wrecks, creative death, all ending up with a few of the bad guys remaining, a heavily injured Max, and the refinery people heading off to find some semblance of civilization.<br />This review does not do this movie, which was one of the movies that launched Mel Gibson's carrer, justice.  This movie is one that would take a book to describe.  It's easier to watch it.  One of the best and most potentially realistic of all post-apocalyptic movies, this movie is science fiction as it can be: well-plotted, logically sequenced.  One of the best science fiction movies of all time, a must have for the serious fan, and a definite 5 star movie.he bad guys remaining, a heavily injured Max, and the refinery people heading off to find some semblance of civilization.<br />This review does not do this movie, which was one of the movies that launched Mel Gibson's carrer, justice.

B0000797IO|5.0|I've always been a fan of \\"Friends\\" and Jennifer Aniston is good on the show as Rachel, but I must say that her performance in this movie is so much better than she could ever be as Rachel. Where most people would typecast Aniston as some sort of flaky ditz as she is at times on Friends, Aniston has a chance to shine in the brooding drama that incited emotions that I've never felt before in me.<br />Giving an awesome performance as Texas girl Justine, Jennifer Aniston really makes you believe that her life has been tough. Her husband and his friend are potheads who seem to do nothing for her life, and you sense that the marriage was once something semi-happy, but has deteriorated into nothing but a rut. John C. Reilly takes a character that could easily be the \\"stereotypical stupid pothead husband\\" and made him into a character who, though he has his severe flaws, really cares about Justine.<br />The character of Holden too was very believeable, in my opinion. He's younger than Justine and a welcome change in her life, and I enjoyed how she tried to shoddily cover up their friendship/affair with such unbelievable lies.<br />The ending saddened me for days. The fact that neither of these interesting characters could find happiness in their lives made me feel so sad for them as if they were my family members, and wondering whose baby it was also left me pondering.<br />This is a great movie and a welcome change from Jennifer Aniston's flaky work. She and the rest of the cast play their roles so well, you wish this movie, even with all the thought-provocation and sadness this movie brings with it.
0151006903|4.0|I was surprised to read the disappointment in the other reviews.  I felt that this book was classic Eco.  It is not only an entertaining romp through a curious period of medieval history, with a would-be Forrest Gump - Baudolino, in his confabulations, would have us believe he was equally fortuitous in his own actions and encounters.  Baudolino is also a philosophical discussion of truth, belief, and history.  We should never expect a simple story from a professor of Semiotics, and Eco does not disappoint.  As we enter a period as curious for its religious beliefs (religious relics, saints etc) as for its the peculiar necessity of reconstructing its history often out of very thin air, we are treated to a fascination meditation on how greatly belief dictates what is truth....at least for the believer.  I found Baudolino entertaining and enlightening on a number of levels, which often is the defining characteristic of a truly great work.
0060934913|3.0|I entirely agree with Joe Haschka's review of this book... The author is (still?!) too narcisistic and too self-absorbed to write a trully classy and entertaining book. His other books had left me with the same (frustrating) impression. For example, rather than reading about the &quot;dermatological curiosities&quot; it would have been a lot more informative to read (and understand) how the typical menu gets decided upon and by whom...To be fair, the author clealy loves the concept of food and at times it's quite infectious...Anyway, I expected a bit more but then again, it seems that the author expected a bit more of himself...

B00007BH5C|4.0|For those of you expecting a reprise of the FOTR soundtrack, prepare to be surprised.  While Shore deftly weaves many of the old themes into this soundtrack, most of the musical themes are very new.  This is a darker movie, with a darker soundtrack.  And it's magnificent.   All of the tracks are memorable, but the last six are simply fantastic.  Gollum's Song especially may at first not seem to fit, but just listen to the lyrics and you'll remember why Gollum was the best character in the whole movie.  I highly recommend this soundtrack -- great for listening to over and over.. and cheaper than buying tickets to keep going to see the movie.
B00005V4O5|5.0|I don't think I can add anything that has not already been said from the other, more articulate reviewers, but I just feel compelled to talk about these guys. I have been listening to Progressive music since 1974 (boy, does that date me) and I have never heard a band that is able to convey as much emotion as PoS. While their chops are appreciable, they do not wear them on their sleeves as many other Prog-Metal bands do. Their musicianship always seems to serve the music. Their complexity never sounds showoffy, it always adds to the emotional content of the pieces. And the way they juxtposition crushing riffs with the dark beauty of vocal chorases is unique in progressive music. Out of their 4 CD's it is impossible for me to pick their best. As my friends and I say &quot;their best CD is the one that is in your CD player at the time&quot;. I was lucky enough to see them at a music festival on the East Coast a couple of years ago, but that only wetted my appetite for more. Will we ever see them on the West Coast? This is a band that cries out for more exposure. I eagerly await their next release.

B000063DHK|5.0|I reviewed this album years ago but since all the reviews have been wiped I'll re-review it.<br />In my opinion this is one of the greatest releases ever, not just by Iron Maiden, but by any band, metal or otherwise. The musicianship is incredible, the songwriting is impeccable, the passion is fierce and the musical bond that Maiden have when playing together is rivaled by so few other bands. I have been a fan for four years now and whenever I realise I haven't listened to them for some time I simply put this album on and remember why they are my favourite band.<br />If you haven't heard Maiden before, then I couldn't think of a better place to start. Don't know what they sound like? Think melodic interplay and crunching heaviness between guitarists Dave Murray and Adrian Smith (without a doubt the greatest guitar duo ever), driving bass from Steve Harris and a variety of tempos. Some songs are fast paced while others are more mid-paced, not to mention the ballads such as Revelations and Children Of The Damned. Don't forget that Maiden aren't a cheap soft metal band (I'll refrain from name-dropping) - they know their music. If it wasn't for the bad image that 80s metal has then maybe thay would be given the credit of the great musicians and songwriters that they are. It saddens me that some non-metal fans are so narrow-minded (not narrow-minded because they don't like metal, but simply because some people feel metal is somehow inferior to whatever they listen to) will not accept that fact. Some of the songs here are very epic (Rime Of The Ancient Mariner is a whopping 13 minutes, while Phantom Of The Opera and Powerslave are over 7 each) and their intricacies and technicalities are clearly not the work of talentless morons.<br />The live performances are also great. Not all of these are quite as good as the studio, but in my opinion some (Powerslave in particular) surpass the original studio recordings. Bruce isn't so good live, but he's not terrible and he's also a very good frontman. What I will say though is that sometimes it is his live vocals that prevent some of these songs from being quite as good as the originals. Nonetheless, the passion is there, as is the sheer energy of the entire band. That can't be created simply from good musicianship - it takes true talent and genuine feeling.<br />If I had any complaints, thenthere would be two. Firstly, the aforemention vocals of Dickinson (don't get me wrong - in the studio he's one of the greatest vocalists ever). Secondly, I feel that there could have been a bit more from Iron Maiden and Killers. Killers in particular only had 1 song on this album. And I'd have liked to have heard Where Eagles Dare. Still, setlists are really a personal thing so I won't dwell on it or drop marks because of it. I mean, I personally, despite being a huge fan, didn't think that highly of Piece Of Mind, despite many fans feeling it was their greatest. So really, what songs should have been included is the difference between Pepsi and Coke.<br />In conclusion, I recommend this to any metal fan. Music has changed since, and I doubt we'll ever see a band quite like this again. Buy this and listen to one of the greatest bands of all time at their peak.very good frontman.

B000002H6C|5.0|I was fotunate enough that this was my first experience with Metallica (10 years ago) and throughout those 10 years, it has always been my favourite Metallica album pre-Black (what is after the Black album is not Metallica afterall) The sophistication of the riffs, topics, the best of Urlich amazing drums (bf he acquired a Ride Cymbal ;) Kirk's best, and Hetfield is at his most mature angst (Jason was not really allowed to shine on)<br />Certainly one of the best albums of all times
0517123207|5.0|A well-written, well-argued treatise on the volatile subject of the evolution of new species by natural selection. At the time, this flew in the face of accepted theories, and especially upset current theological doctrine, Archbishop Ussher would be particularly upset!.<br />Darwin agonised for years over the publication of his book, and it was only at the urging of his friends (that he was about to be upstaged by Wallace) that he finally published. The delay was of his own making - torn between the evidence of his notes and correspondence with Wallace, and the furore that would inevitably result. The furore was bound to happen anyway, surrounded as he was by small-minded [people], so he should have published earlier. But ... this might have deprived us of the brilliant arguments he puts forth in support of each section in the book. <BR>He obviously knew what he was up against, so he tried to present his case as lucidly as possible - and here's the unusual aspect of the work - in layman's language! This was almost unheard of in a Victorian Scientific treatise - they were meant to be read by Scientists, not the hoy-poloy! He tries to counter every conceivable objection to each statement, as nicely (in both senses of the word) as possible, without any of the fervour and tunnel vision that one expects from a convert to a new ideal. He takes us by the hand and gently walks us through the evidence in support of his theory, helping us to realise that, yes, he is talking sense, no matter what our pre-conceptions of life might be.<BR>Discover for yourself that evolution is not 'survival of the fittest', but 'survival of the most fit' - that is, fitted for that particular ecological niche - fittest being a Victorian word that has taken a different modern meaning.<br />An amazingly good read, even for our enlightened times, but recommended reading  - I'll bet there are hundereds of copies on dusty bookshelves that have never been read - time to dust it off and find out for yourself the genius of the man.
B00006F2TV|5.0|This movie is amazing, and the DVD is even better! I never read comic books, or really cared to listen about Spiderman, and a LOVED this movie! It has all the makings of a great movie: action, drama, romance, and a great cliffhanger. The plot is amazing, the speacial effects are awesome, and surprisingly, there's very little blood, and no gore. The DVD has great extras, like commentaries and actor profiles. The second disc was really informative. It was all about the comic-book Spiderman, and it gave great backround information, especially for someone like me who has never read Spiderman before. All around, this DVD is worth the buy, so get it!
B00005JL7Q|4.0|I must admit I have never been much of a Hugh Grant fan.  It seems to me that in most of his previous movies he plays the same stuttering lout who is more or less likeable or not likeable and who you really don't ever get to know.  These characters are primarily two-dimensional creations used to move a plot along.<br />In About a Boy something different happens.  Yes, Grant plays a man who is primarily a layabout lout who pretends to have a son in order to score with the women at the local single parent's group.  On a parallel course, a boy with a suicidal mom (Toni Collete) seems drawn to Grant and their paths converge.  But Grant's character seems to exist outside the movie plot, and although in retrospect the plot may be somewhat predictable, I found that while watching the movie I was so engrossed in the arc of Grant's character I really didn't have any of those irritating stray thoughts that throw you out of the movie by telling you where it is going.  The story here is stronger than the usual Grant vehicle, and he rises to it by turning in the most complex  performance of his career so far.  I really liked this movie.  <br />The DVD edition has an interesting &quot;making of&quot; documentary, and there are some deleted scenes.  About a Boy is definitely worth a look.

I can't wait.
B000059HAI|4.0|After reading all of the deservedly dismal reviews of Michael Bay's lamentable, insulting 2001 \\"Pearl Harbor\\" (and posting one of my own), I noticed many of the reviews recommending 1970's \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\" as a much better alternative, so when I had the chance to buy it, I did so.  I'm not sorry I did.  Particularly for a movie that's 32 years old, this one does everything that \\"Pearl Harbor\\" failed at so spectacularly.  P40s and Zeroes actually fly like... well, P40s and Zeroes, not F-16 fighter jets.  There were Asians aplenty in 1941 Hawaii and this film actually depicts that.  They smoked like chimneys.  Again, accurately shown.  Watching this movie, I actually FELT like it was 1941 when new technology like deciphering equipment and radar was being smugly bandied about.  Conversely, in \\"Pearl Harbor\\" they used handheld radios to communicate with fighter pilots in the air, an utterly nonexistent application of radio technology 60 years ago.  There really was no sense of the time period in that movie.  I'm surprised Michael Bay didn't have the Japanese attack squadron using GPS to plot the locations of the U.S. battleships.  I particularly like how this film gave the background leading up to the attack and presented the story from both American and Japanese perspectives.  Although there were no central \\"hero\\" characters, and much of the storyline is presented in an almost-documentary format, this does nothing to impede the sense of thrill and dread as the tension leading up to the attack grows.  Watching this movie makes it even more apparent how many things Michael Bay just got dead wrong in his movie, or just didn't bother researching at all, which makes it that much more shameful. (An example: When the Japanese attack planes launched from their carriers, the sun hadn't even yet broken over the horizon -- this is accurate.  In Bay's movie, however, it was full daylight.  But of course, he had children playing Sunday morning baseball games at 7 a.m. too, so you can't expect much from him.)  I gave \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\" four stars instead of five because it still overly sanitizes the attack.  The G rating is a bit misleading -- if this movie were to be rated by today's standards, it would get at least a PG for occasional mild profanity and scenes of peril.  However, there's no overt death or carnage whatsoever in this movie, and although the attack is very well-done (particularly the airfield attacks -- it was heartbreaking to see pilots struggle in vain to get their P40s off the ground), it surely doesn't accurately depict what had to be a savage, brutal attack.  Over 2,400 Americans died, and this movie doesn't give you the thrust of that, emotionally.  In all other aspects though, this film is good standing on its own, and superb when compared to the $135M  train wreck that Michael Bay forced on the nation two summers ago.  The supplementary material provided on the Special Edition is also worth watching for those interested in history.  While you'll really miss seeing all those frighteningly close-up shots of Ben Affleck's magnificently capped teeth in this movie, you might actually feel somewhat educated on the attack as compensation.  Definitely recommended.
B00000063U|5.0|When I first listened to this, I thought : \\"How come I NEVER heard of those two earlier ?\\". I mean, not all songs are masterpieces, but four of them certainly are. Withered and died is one of the most moving ballad I've ever heard - Linda's voice sounds very much like heaven to me. Down where the drunkards roll is great too. The Great Valerio is terrifying. The very bleak \\"the end of the rainbow\\" is one on the only RT vocals from this period that I really like. The song seems to cast a spell on the listener.<BR>The little beggar girl & Has he got a friend for me may be the two weak tracks on the record, and still .. they are not bad at all....
B00006LLNU|4.0|Personally I like Sigur Ros' debut better.  ( ) is a good album, but only the first &quot;side&quot;.  The first four tracks (unfortuatly the shortest) are very good... the perfect soundtrack to cold days with gray skies.  The last four, however, border on post-rock/GYBE noodling which to me gets boring and flat.  If only this had been an EP, I would have loved it.<BR><BR>One techincal note I'd like to add...  Sigur Ros clam that the lyrics are supposed to mean whatever you'd like them to mean (since there in a non-existant language), however I swear to you that every single track with lyrics sounds like the phrase &quot;you sigh&quot; is being repeated over and over again.  My personal lyric sheet reads: Track 01- &quot;you sigh/ you sigh/ ooooo/ you sigh&quot;, and etc for the rest.
B000002IZM|5.0|I'm not sure why including snippets from the movie, on a 'movie' soundtrack seems to bother so many people, but if it's such a big deal, just rip the CD and reburn it without the dialogue.  This is an outstanding soundtrack either way.

B00005UW9T|4.0|\\"Anastasia\\" is a animated musical that works despite some serious problems fundamental to the story for anybody who knows anything about Russian history.  The legend of Anastasia has in roots in a historical truth: that when the Communists executed the Romanovs and gunned them down, the young Grand Duchess was not shot; she fainted.  When it was discovered she was still alive she was clubbed and bayoneted to death.  But the \\"truth\\" remains, she was not shot dead with the rest of her family.  In this version that issued is rendered moot because the young Anastasia never joins her parents as they fled St. Petersburg.  However, the greatest historical liberty is the idea that the Russian Revolution was the result of a curse the mad monk Gregorei Rasputin laid on the Romanovs.  Forget Lenin and the Communists overthrowing the Czar; it was a crazy monk and his friend, an albino bat named Bartok.<br />However, \\"Anastasia\\" has several things working in its favor to counter-attack this nonsense.  First, there is the haunting \\"Once Upon a December,\\" which carries the mood of the story perfectly and comes into play at several key moments in the film.  The rest of the music is above average and avoids cuteness for the most part (the bad guys get the fun song with \\"In the Dark of the Night\\"), but \\"Once Upon a December\\" is musically the cornerstone of the whole film.  Second, there is the wonderful vocal work by Kelsey Grammer and Angela Landsbury as the supporting characters Vladimir and the Dowager Empress Marie; they are the pair who provide the film with its heart while Anna and Dmitri wait for their brains to catch up with their hearts.  Third, in true giant cartoon movie style, the film reduces everything to the fundamental desire to go home and be part of a family.<br />Ultimately, the backbone of the story is more the 1956 Ingrid Bergman film version of the \\"Anastasia\\" story than history: a con artist wants to earn the reward for finding the lost heiress to the Russian thrown and turns an amnesia victim into Anastasia only to discover that she is the real thing and that he is in love with her.  Then basically they throw in the standard evil person trying to keep the princess and her boyfriend apart (think Disney's \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" except instead of an evil queen it is a mad monk and instead of a giant dragon there is a small albino bat and the princess is really a Grand Duchess and the prince is now a former servant boy, but other than that they are remarkably the same).  Besides, kids like this film and they should be allowed to do so for a few years before they discover they can not learn history from movies (and should never let watching a movie substitute for reading an assigned book).an thrown and turns an amnesia victim into Anastasia only to discover that she is the real thing and that he is in love with her.

0066214122|5.0|Michael Crichton's book was excellent.  The scientific jargon lost me a couple of times.  Overall the book was exciting, I couldn't put it down!  The way Mr. Crichton has a habit of showing mankind of it's giant leaps in technology, but major mess ups figuring out the cons of such technology, is uncanny. Keep up the great work Mr. Crichton!
B00005JKG7|5.0|I have always been quite fond of this film, and its &quot;low-budget&quot; appeal. However, after seeing this film only on HBO and VHS, I never truly appreciated what a beautiful film this is. The DVD transfer is GORGEOUS. The film looks crystal clear and the cinematography, which I always found breath-taking, are truly magnified and enhanced by this format. For fans of this film, this jaw-dropping DVD will forever change the way you view this film. A must have for Carpenter fans, this truly wonderful DVD catapults this already good film into the all-time great ghost story movies such as &quot;Poltergeist,&quot; &quot;The Changeling&quot; and &quot;The Blair Witch Project.&quot; Few films get better with time and viewings, but this version of &quot;The Fog,&quot; will IMHO turn this from a cult classic into an American horror masterpiece. You can look up my old review for the VHS version of the movie, but it would no longer apply as I have witnessed this marvelous DVD. Here's hoping that John Carpenter (one of America's most under- appreciated film masterminds) gives &quot;Escape From New York&quot; the same wonderful treatment.<br />Movie: A+<br />Picture Quality: A+<br />Sound: A- (JLC's screams were a little too loud)<br />Extras: A+
B000002UZ4|5.0|This is one of the best greatest hits albums I own.  Every song rolls right along and before you know it the CD is done.  Anyone who even slightly likes Pet Shop Boys has to get this.  The best songs are West End Girls and their cover of U2's Where The Streets Have No Name.

0060512806|4.0|Stephenson did a great job with telling the story of encrytion from WW2 up to and including what the near future holds.  The book could of been about 150 pages shorter, but still keeps the readers attention.  The story goes back and forth between 2 men and their 2 grandkids in different times in history.  Although this can be confusing sometimes, the ideas and concepts, like all Stephenson's work, is very timely.  The hope for a &quot;data haven&quot; is something that is in the mind of every person, or will be after reading this book.  All in all it's a very witty, real, and great written story.  We'll see if he decides to make a series out of it.
B00006J9OT|4.0|First things first, if it weren't for the intermittent periods of audience ovation you'd swear this were a studio recording rather than a live one. The sound quality is excellent throughout while maintaining an all important live edge. In such a setting, Canadian jazz vocalist Diana Krall gives each song she performs room to breathe, allowing for some rather electrifying, virtuosic improvisation moments with her talented band. Throughout, the performances are some of Krall's most jazz-sounding yet, indicating she seems to really understand and feel jazz.<br />As ever, choice of repertoire sees Krall taking the safe and familiar route, which you might argue is starting to make her sound somewhat `established', yet never tedious. There is no need for concern. In ten years time if her albums sound like this there will be few complaints. Krall's voice - developed, adaptable and oh so finely tuned - is an extremely complementary lead to her band. In addition, her piano performances are nothing short of brilliant. The improvised sections flaunt Krall's great rhythmic and technical aptitude, while her solo introductory piano solo to \\"Devil May Care\\" reveals a keen grasp of restrained, subtle jazz. Moreover, she sings and plays piano at the same time, which adds to the overall shape, form and versatility of each piece.<br />The most interesting thing about this album is the charm and spirit that Krall manages to inject into long-standing and endlessly covered songs. She makes them entirely her own. The improvised sections lend a hand to this also, making A Night In Paris sound remarkably fresh and new. In the gorgeously serene \\"Let's Fall In Love,\\" Krall's seductive, sensuous voice smoothly graces the jazz harmonies, while tracks like \\"`Deed I Do\\" and \\"I Love Being Here With You\\" best suit the band's great rhythmic panache. Meanwhile, the Billy Joel-penned \\"Just The Way You Are\\" is a studio recording generously treated with Krall's sumptuous, subtle musicality. An album, then, that is well worth investigating. The entire concert sounds excellent and delivers jazz how it's intended - live.
B00006LFGD|4.0|Everyone else pretty much covered the fact that you could buy Streisand's previous CD, \\"Esentials\\" and get most of the same songs on this CD.  They're right.  With that said...this CD is a great collection and makes a nice gift for any fan.  <br />The two new songs, one duet with Barry Manilow and the other with Josh Grobin are both plain and forgetable.  It's not so much the artists as it is the material.  The songs [are horrible], quite honestly.  I can't be the only one out there tire of David Foster's rediculous song styling (he's managed to make every diva out there sound exactly the same).  <br />The CD is worth getting simply for the remastered version of \\"One less bell/A house is not a home\\", which Streisand sings with herself (in the 70's this would be considered pure genius) and sounds better than anything she's done in some time.  The song is amazing and she's never sounded better.  It's one of those songs that makes you feel an assortment of emotions and you can't get it out of your head.  <br />There are a few other high points, but for the most part it's simply slick packaging (the cover art is beautiful even by the most vocal critics).  Buy it...it's can't hurt.
B00005JKNF|1.0|Typically I like these kinds of movies. With so many oscar nominations and wins, I really looked forward to this movie.  However I was greeted by an utterly boring movie. The plot was slow, the movie just sludged along at an overly-leisurly pace. And plot? What plot? You wait for the entire movie for something to happen and when it does, the movie ends a few minutes later. I think that the oscar judges fell asleep when watching this movie; when they woke up and the movie was over, they couldn't remember whether they liked it and so decided to be on the safe side, save some shame, and award this movie.<br />Never again will those precious minutes of my life come back.
B00006L9ZT|5.0|German romanticism, as well as opera itself, reached a zenith when Richard Wagner composed the four part opera cycle, Ring Of The Nibelung. It was his most ambitious and his most innovative opera. Wagner spent many years working on the score and libretto, changing the course of opera's history. Opposed to the traditional bel canto and grand opera styles that dominated the opera world in the late 19th century, Wagner composed what he considered music of the future, \\"music dramas.\\" The focus was not so much the brilliant singing, nor the lavish spectacle, but the music engaging the audience with the drama unfolding on the stage. Drama and music combined created a tremendous power like audiences had never before seen. Wagner's professional jealousy of other composers, and the frustration that some Europeans disliked his new art, lead him to misunderstanding and belittliing Jewish composers such as Giacomo Meyerbeer. When his friend, the German existentialist philosopher Nietzche approved of Carmen and took a strong disliking to Wagner's operas, their friendship was broken. Wagner was a man whose tastes and ideas were radical at the time. Some of his music was even shocking, much like rock stars of late project themselves. Wagner created the motif, a theme that represents a character or part of the story, such as romance, jealousy, a curse, etc. He woved those themes delicately and combined them to fit high drama. Never is this more accurate then with Ring of the Nibelung. The great operas have influenced psychologists, fiction writers and epic filmmakers. The motif has been used by John Williams (music composer of such films as Indiana Jones and the Star Wars Trilogy) and there has to have been some influence over the fantasy writers J.R.R. Tolkien, whose \\"ring of doom\\" forged by Sauron and Frodo's task to destroy it, seems to be similar to the ring on the Wagner operas.<br />Taken from the Norse legends, the opera Rhinegold begins when Albrecht, a hideous dwarf, proposes sexualand romantic encounters with the mermaid Rhinemaidens, who guard the Rhinegold. When they mock him and tease him with the magic gold, Albrecht is tempted to steal the gold for himself. Even if he never finds love, he will have the greatest power in the universe. Stealing the gold, the problems that ensue are the tragedy of the opera- mankind's greed and thirst for power. In Valhalla, the home of the gods, Odin has problems of his own. His wife Freya has been promised to be sold to the giants who constructed Valhalla castle. The complicated first opera ends with the curse of the ring. <br />The second opera, The Valkyrie, introduces the characters of Siegmund and Sieglende, parents of the later hero, Siegfried. Their love is forbidden, and this angers Freja who convinces her husband Odin to have them killed. Odin sends his right hand Valkyrie, his own daughter Brunhilde, to do the job. Brunhilde is the archetypical, stereotypical opera heroine, with the horned helmet, breastplate and spear, as she is a divine warrior who gathers the fallen Norsemen to Valhalla. Her catchy operatic cries are \\"Hojotoho Hia!\\" which she repeats ad nauseum with the rest of the Valkyries during the famous \\"Ride of the Valkyries.\\" Brunhilde sympathizes with the lovers Siegmund and Sieglende (who is now pregnant with Siegfried). She spares their lives. But when Odin hears of her defiance and disobediance, he casts a dark spell upon Brunhilde. She is to sleep surrounded in fire until a hero awakens her with a kiss.<br />That hero is Siegfried, who is the title hero of the third opera. In the story, Siegfried forges his father's sword Nothung from a tree. He defeats the dragon Falfner. With the dragon's blood, he is able to commune with nature. Siegfried then brakes through the mystic fire and awakens Brunhilde with a kiss. The two are married and live happily along the banks of the Rhine river. In the final opera, Twilight of The Gods, Siegfried longs for adventure again after marital peace, and journeys down the river Rhine. But he falls into enemy hands, the Gibechung giants, who kill him. When Brunhilde hears of this, she become so grief stricken that she immolates herself in Siegfried's funeral pyre. The world comes to an end through fire and flood, Valhalla burns, the Rhine river overfloods. The ring, the symbol of power and greed again comes into the hands of the Rhinemaidens. The romantic, serene strings in the orchestra seem to say that true love (Brunhilde's love for Siegfried) has triumphed, and a new world order will begin as fresh and new as the first day of creation.

Everytime I hear one of their songs, I worry about that friend of mine that cuts her wrists just to feel the pain.

0151008116|5.0|I admit it- I read this book because I liked its cover.  An overhead image of a boy curled up in a fetal position in a tiny lifeboat, with a tiger three times his size at the edge of the bow, seeming ready to attack the sharks, fish, and turtles that surround them in the clear blue water.<br />The novel beautifully elucidates this image into a story full of wit, anxiety, compassion, and survival as the boy uses his exceptionally sensitive demeanor to 'tame' this tiger named Richard Parker (which, incidentally, is what I will name my next pet!).  Pi uses his experience and knowledge of zookeeping to conquer his fear and what he believes is the tiger's killer nature.  But most of all, it is Pi's faith which leads him to survive- his faith in Allah, Buddha, and God (yes, all of them), and his faith in his fellow shipmate.  This book is an amazing and unique story which I will gladly pass on to all of my friends and family, and one I will read time and again.

B00006IUOZ|4.0|This finely wrought remake of the Norwegian film of the same name (1997)--an excellent film by the way--is something close to a thriller masterpiece flawed only by a too-hurried resolution.  Christopher Nolan, whose strikingly original Memento (2000) is among the best films made in recent years, planned this out very carefully, tying up most of the loose ends without relying on any phony motivation, which we sometimes see in passionate cop dramas.  However, the guns blazing at the end was a cheap way out of this psychologically complicated story.  Still, I think we can overlook that small fault since the rest of the film is so very well done.<br />The incomparable Al Pacino gives a mesmerizing performance as Los Angeles police detective Will Dormer who is sent with his partner north to Alaska ostensibly to help in a murder investigation.  However we quickly learn that being out of town may help him and his partner avoid an Internal Affairs investigation to which Dormer may be vulnerable.  By the way, \\"dormir\\" in French means \\"to sleep,\\" which is something Dormer does not do for six days, which is very close to the edge of human tolerance.  Indeed Dormer's last line in the film is \\"Just let me sleep.\\"<br />Pacino is supported by Robin Williams as Walter Finch, a morally-deranged mystery writer who doesn't appear until the film is about half over.  He makes up for keeping us waiting with a dramatic performance that will curl your toes.  He is even more despicable than Bjorn Floberg was in the Norwegian film.  Not only is Robin Williams's appearance subtly altered and his demeanor strange, even his voice is not the same.  He is a long way from Good Morning, Vietnam (1987) and Mrs. Doubtfire (1993), but I think this is, in a more modest way, one of his best performances.<br />Also featured is Hilary Swank, whom you should see in Boys Don't Cry (1999) if you haven't, as Ellie Burr, an ingenue Alaskan detective in awe of the master cop from the big city.  Notable in a modest role is Jonathan Jackson as Randy Stetz, a high schooler with a chip on his shoulder.  I also liked the brief appearance by Katharine Isabelle, who played the murder girl's trampy girlfriend.<br />The key psychological question in both films is why does Will Dormer decide to cover up the accidental shooting?  In director Erik Skjoldbjaerg's 1997 film the answer is human nature.  That certainly worked, but was not enough for Nolan, and so he gives us Dormer's Internal Affairs problems back in L.A. as further motivation.  This works very well for two reasons: One, it is convincing.  Recall his spontaneous confession to the hotel clerk (Maura Tierney).  And two, the cop problems in Los Angeles are right out of the headlines of recent years.  They are real.  Nolan even has Ellie find a copy of the Los Angeles Times with one of the stories on the front page.<br />The next psychological question is, is the villain a serial killer in the making?  If he is, then Dormer must stop him regardless of his own problems.  And therein lies the internal conflict of the film so well projected by Al Pacino.  We know that there is something more than the midnight sun to account for Dormer's disintegration.  He is a flawed cop.  Like some of his real life counterparts in L.A. and elsewhere he took it upon himself, by falsifying evidence, to administer justice to a man he knew was guilty.  When he did that, he knew (and this is something he teaches Ellie) that he had lost his integrity as a cop.  The temptation to frame somebody we know is guilty of a horrendous crime is very great and many of us would fall into it.<br />Since I cannot discuss the ending here in any concrete way, let me just say that if Nolan had really taken his time with the ending he might have had Dormer simply murder the villain and face the consequences (or even commit suicide).  But I suspect Nolan believed that the heroic character of his star would have been compromised.  In Skjoldbjaerg's film the police detective actually shoots the dog to obtain the spent bullet he needs.  In Nolan's film the dog is already dead.  I think this minor blush of character actually taints Nolan's film to some small degree and leads Nolan down the path to the Hollywood ending to come.  But judge for yourself<br />One final point.  A lot can be gotten out of a single camera shot.  This is something that Nolan does very well.  A case in point is the shot on the plastic evidence bag holding the bullet that Dormer picks up in the lab.  Nolan has the camera show us the words on the bag, \\"chain of custody,\\" and he has the camera linger long enough for us to read them.  This nice touch reminds us that THAT very chain of custody is being compromised, another echo of real life criminal investigations from recent years in L.A.<br />See this for Al Pacino, at his best here, one of the great stars of our era whose ability to command the screen is second to none.tective actually shoots the dog to obtain the spent bullet he needs.

B00006RIO7|4.0|I can't quite pinpoint what I find wrong with this album, other than the awful, pop misfires of non-show track \\"Love is a Crime\\" and that rap version of \\"Cell Block Tango.\\" The songs featured in the film are well-done, and \\"Class,\\" the song that should've been in the film but wasn't, is back in place here - giving Catherine Zeta-Jones and Queen Latifah another showcase.<br />I prefer Renee Zellweger's rocking, daring take on Roxie to that scary-voiced version that Ann Reinking gave us on the '90s Broadway album, but, other than that, the revival soundtrack is way better. Richard Gere proves he's a good actor onscreen as Billy, but the man cannot sing and doesn't do particularly well with Billy's songs. His voice is weak, and he sounds like he's doing the numbers in the style of Jimmy Durante, more breathing and speaking than actually singing.<br />Zeta-Jones' Velma is competent, even good at times, but she can't hold a candle to Bebe Neuwirth, who stole the entire show on Broadway. Besides, Zeta-Jones doesn't get as many numbers in the movie or on the album as Neuwirth did.<br />I'm not mad that I bought this album, but it's not great.

Coverdale's voice here is annoying, and there are early signs of where he would lead his career after Deep Purple (come on, a Deep Purple song called &quot;I NEED LOVE!&quot;??!)The best moments are when Hughes sings, sure.
