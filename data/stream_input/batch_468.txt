B000089RVX|3.0|Thier best music is buried in the past and not likely to ever be re-released. I don't have a problem with Fallen, but unlike Origin this disc will never rate five stars with me. Untill I hear something that reminds me of the band I fell in love with I'll stick to Lacuna Coil, Nightwish & Within Temptation.
B0000TB01Y|3.0|This musical was more or less written for tots following the lives of Glenda and The Wicked Witch... it's a better alternative to the predictable Wizard of Oz when it comes to taking the kids to see a Broadway show.<br /><br />It follows mainly the life of the Wicked green witch from Wiz of Oz and sets out to make you feel sympathetic towards her which in the end you do.<br /><br />Both of the lead females did a wonderful job in their performances. Especially the Green witch who won a Tony for her performance although Glenda got nominated as well.<br /><br />All in all it has been a bad year for broadway but, this cutesy musical did a good job at trying to salvage some of broadway. But, I'm afraid it's too cutesy for any adult to enjoy. A good one to take the kids too though.<br /><br />I admit I own the c.d. and I'll tell you why the song \\"For Good\\" is the most beautiful song I have ever heard in a musical and I'll urge you to BUY the C.D. simply to have that song. Which is talking about the people that come into our lives and changes for the better.<br /><br />I'll give it one star because I have to, One for the ladies' performances, and one for \\"For Good.\\"  This IS so much better than seeing The Wizard Of Oz for the uptenth time.
0553213105|5.0|Almost everything that can be said about this book has been said. It has appeared in countless other books and media. I love this book for it's wit, it's humor, it's unconventional love story and because it is almost the singly best early example of individuals rebelling against conformity. This book is amazing, and I recommended it to anyone.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Perhaps. I believe it to be. Whether Thom and company were trying to create a classic (and from what I've learned about the band, probably not), they did in spades. The introductory lick to \\"Airbag\\" is a clarion call. The cello counterpoint only enhances it.  <br /> <br />For those only introduced to the band through the video for \\"Paranoid Android,\\" you must understand that the video was actually produced as a separate entity, without knowledge that the band would use it someday. The band saw the cartoon and thought the song would go well with it. Sort of what some heads thought of when \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" was married to \\"Dark Side of the Moon.\\" A cool, unintended marriage. <br /> <br />Chills go through my spine whenever I hear \\"Exit Music (from a Film)\\" A funny story: I was a member of a theater group that used to party pretty heavily (I think you know what I mean) when rehearsals were done. I once picked up a guitar, and proceeded to play and sing \\"Exit Music....\\" An incredibly beautiful woman started screaming, \\"STOP PLAYING THAT SONG...IT MAKES ME WANT TO COMMIT SUICIDE!\\" It was at that moment that I decided that this was the greatest music I have ever heard. That a relatively simple song in B minor could evoke such passion from a woman who had never heard it before convinced me: the emotion in this album is universal. <br /> <br />We all feel alienated by society/technology/lovers/family. As much as Thom Yorke doesn't/didn't want to take the mantle of a \\"voice of a generation,\\" his album/CD really captured a certain feeling at the time. It may have not been universal, but the fact that it may have not been universal makes it more important, as it might enlighten some that some people are not thrilled by instant gratification or instant information.  <br /> <br />I think this is a very Romantic album, in the classical music sense of the word. It appeals to whatever sense you submit to it. And yes, I can actually smell a lost love when I hear \\"Exit Music ...\\" or\\"No Surprises.\\" If there was a more effective way to embody how technology/the \\"ruling class\\" dictates how we should feel about society, I cannot imagine a \\"song\\" better than \\"Fitter Happier.\\"  <br /> <br />\\"OK Computer\\" also, conveniently, allows a human who has been so affected by the previous tracks to have a respite from the emotional rollercoaster that the band has sent you upon. I always thought of \\"The Tourist\\" as someting emotionally restful, yet provocative. If the CD had ended with \\"Exit Music,\\" I fear mass suicides. Had it ended with \\"Electioneering\\"...then the American election of 2004...well you get my drift. The band doesn't want to leave you in a bad state, but not a good one either. It wants to leave you how you entered: somewhat the same, but somehow different. <br /> <br />I'm on my third CD of \\"OK Computer.\\" I lent out the first; you know how that ends. The second I literally wore out between my home and car CD players. I'm on my third. I couldn't live without it. I couldn't die without it. It speaks. Perhaps the music listener in the 21st century has been spoiled, or spoilt, by the vapid music of the time, but just know, that at the end of the 20th century, a few guys from England truly \\"got it.\\" I don't believe that it's happened since. I anxiously await the next people to \\"get it,\\" whomever they are. <br /> <br />Until then, \\"OK Computer\\" is the best album/CD I've ever heard. <br />
B00000JCB2|1.0|I'm glad there are used record stores, as that is the only thing this band is good for.
B000002L68|5.0|The album will leave you inspired to do something worthwhile with your life. From his hair-raising guitar licks, quirky and thoughtful lyrics to his unbelievable vocal range... I'm searching desperately to find an album that comes even close to matching the ease and brilliance that flows endlessly from Purple Rain, but I soon learnt, this is a one-off masterpiece (with exception to Sign 'o' the Times). <br /> <br />Perhaps a welcome edition to the album would be the legendary b-side 'Erotic City'. But one thing can be said, Prince is certainly a true original producing songs of this standard and quality. 'Computer Blue' is a class showcase of everything Prince stands for - Powerful funk, lyrical expression, ripping vocals and masturbating his guitar. 'Darling Nikki', a salacious rip-roar of sexual tension and body-grinding funk. 'The Beautiful Ones', a song which climaxes with a melody rivaled by no other artist... his screams are passionate and meaningful, they blow you away. 'When Doves Cry', a stand-out track produced by exceptional talent and deep lyrical content. <br /> <br />I could go on forever, but all the tracks read a story of their own. Buy this album and you will never look back.
630460291X|3.0|The Bryan Adams theme track for this film stayed at no.1 in the UK charts for 16 long, dark weeks. A particularly low ebb for this nations collective psyche.  <br />Despite this and despite the strong American accents, I actually find it hard to completely loathe this movie. Perhaps it's due to watching it as a rather geeky young lad, when Kevin Costner actually seemed quite cool (- as opposed to the self-important, greasy goat turd I now realise he is). Or maybe it's down to the slow-mo arrow shooting scenes, which must have been a precursor to the whole John Woo white dove phenomena prevalent today.   <br />I expect its more likely though that this films success is in a large part down to the performance of Alan Rickman as the Sherrif of Nottingham. A true pantomime villain that, despite Kevin Costners best efforts, prevents the film from taking itself too seriously. <br />All in all, an enjoyable romp. <br />

B0001BKAEY|4.0|It is interesting when you watch a movie having heard a lot of negative criticism about it, your expectations are low and so without anticipation you can enjoy the film for what it's worth. That is the frame of mind i was in when i viewed this film and i must admit, i was a little pleasantly surprised.  <br /> <br />I will not go into a plot synopsis in detail here. The first movie was a breath of fresh air, original yet weird and strangely resonant enough to stay in your mind, that was a good film. After the first the second was (to me anyway) a bit of a dissapointment. The philosophical arguments got on my nerves a little, and i must admit i did not pay enough attention to the 'free will versus determinism' stuff to really grasp enough of what was going on.  <br /> <br />The third film actually clarified the second film better, we understand a lot more of the roles of the architect and oracle, order versus chaos, a kind of dual divinity Yin and Yang thing going on. The first third of the film was the weakest (with the exception of the train concept), too much dialogue, too many lesser characters and too much time spent in Zion which was far less interesting than either the matrix or the machine city. It's hard to imagine a bunch of scruffy looking humans living in a backward little hole in the ground surviving for so long against such an opponent as the machines. The 'Nazi' speaking character also got on my nerves a bit, the accent was more farce than invention. The second third of the film was better, i dont normally like action films per se (all the fatally narrow and ultimately bland predictability of hero facing impossible odds with special courage and inevitably triumphing means the total absence of any real suspense) but i admired the way they did the attack on the city, it looked very good. The final third was the better of the three, the killing off of a main character was interesting and spared us the nauseating end credit kiss we have come to expect fromHollywood. The final battle between Neo and Smith was well done, the special effects were exceptional, the dialogue not too corny and the leering villain suitably psychotic. This is a special effects film which succeeds in it's main premise, bringing closure to the trilogy, tying up loose ends and providing entertainment, there are no exceptional feats of acting or brilliant strings of dialogue, cinematography being rapidly erased by cgi in most blockbusters these days there was not much camera trickery either, but ultimately the film was worth watching, not nearly as bad as i thought it would be.

0385483821|5.0|Andy Grove, CEO of the phenomenally successful Intel Corp, is clearly<br />worth listening to on the subject of management.  The \\"Wintel\\"<br />success story is well known.  More harrowing was Intel's earlier self-<br />transformation from making memory chips to making microprocessors.<br /><br />How to steer an enterprise thru a major change in its business, per<br />Mr. Grove:<br /><br />1)  Figure out if a major change is imminent.  If so, you're about to<br />enter what Grove calls \\"the valley of death\\".<br /><br />2)  Figure out how to deal with it.  Largely (for CEOs), this involves<br />listening to your employees & doing your homework.<br /><br />3)  Set a new course, sell it to your company, and stick to it.<br /><br />The \\"secret\\" to success here is identifying the oncoming crisis early &<br />reacting sensibly.  He relates the story of Apple, a company with clearly<br />superior products - the Mac operating system, the first good laser<br />printer - completely missing the shift from proprietary to open<br />PC standards, and ending up as a niche player.  John Sculley, then<br />Apple's CEO, acknowledged this crucial mistake years later.  Groves<br />thinks Sculley knew this shift was happening , but wasn't able to<br />overcome Apple's \\"inertia of success\\".  Curiously, this was pretty<br />much the same problem IBM had when PCs began displacing<br />mainframes.  It's very hard for an organization to give up a strategy<br />that has been richly rewarded in the past.<br /><br />In management, as in engineering, we often learn more from failures<br />than successes.  Grove's case histories will make informative reading<br />for anyone in business.  Not many of us are CEOs, but we'll all go thru<br />Grove's \\"strategic inflection points\\" in our careers.<br /><br />Review copyright 1998 by Peter D.

B000002N2N|5.0|Exactly why Sire Records chose to release this in Britain only in 1979, when being critics' darlings and cult favourites wasn't exactly translating into the chart and sales success they clearly enough deserved, remains a mystery. As thrustingly glorious as their first four albums were, this set--cut from a Rainbow Theater performance around the time of the third's release, \\"Rocket to Russia\\"--showed the Ramones in their best habitat and, in an era when live albums were still reasonably good to make the ho-hum and yawners graduate from ho-hum yawners to stars for a short enough while, would probably have made them the chartbusters they wouldn't have minded being.  <br /> <br />And it would have done so when the Ramones of their reputation and legend were still intact. Before they began trying too hard to \\"mature\\" their style and sound, before they began to fear (maybe) that the joke was over and the song remained too much the same, before they walked into ill-advised experiments with Phil Spector and Graham Gouldman, before they threatened to become little more than pleasant memories until \\"Bonzo Goes To Bitburg\\" (which sounds exactly as dated now as most of the Ramones' repertoire doesn't) got them their credibility back, before they went from there to just churn it out for the faithful for another decade, with the people who needed to hear them blissfully ignorant of them, until a 1990s generation of punks began wearing their influence on their sleeves...by which time the Ramones had just about had it, anyway. <br /> <br />If you (like me) bought it when it was an import-only offering and finally wore out the vinyl, here's your reminder of what you loved about them from the hey-ho-let's-go: the zip-gun churn; the mocking lyrics; the three- or four-chord blasts which were too celebratory of rock and roll's history to be as purely punk as most of what they inspired (in England, especially) was, and too sincere to be mere throwaway smartass satire; and, above all, theattitude which betrayed these guys as nothing less than New York kids up on the roof who could handle being misfits but couldn't stand that the rock and roll they loved--the 1960s garage bands in particular--had been buried alive in an avalanche of \\"progressive\\" pusillanimity and decided, the hell with it, to do something about it like yesterday.  <br /> <br />And you might even forgive whomever chose the track sequence (or the set list, depending) for leaving out \\"Beat on the Brat\\"...

I highly suggest this for any Frusciante fan.
0385507755|3.0|A frightening glimpse into the darkest side of self-loathing and self abuse. In simple, unadorned language Frey recounts his time spent at a rehab clinic recovering from crack-cocaine and heavy drug addiction. The stories are nightmarish - in raw language Frey probes the perimeters of his pitch black womb of suffering. A lifelong victim of his own propensity toward the self-destructive common in young adults, the author recalls how he had to decide how to turn over a new leaf and put the pieces of his life back together. The prose can be frustratingly jumbled and repetitive at times, but the gravity of the subject matter carries the story along in addition to an uncertain romantic relationship Frey has in the hospital with a girl called Lily. A Million Little Pieces is tear envoking and will make you think twice before ever feeling sorry for yourself again.

Tan adeptly translates these unique Chinese \\"sensations\\" to the reader through cleverly created characters of gimlet-eyed mothers and their incorrigible daughters. An indirect dialogue between mothers and daughters is set up through Tan's flawless storytelling. It is edifying without being didactic. Readers from all walks of life will walk away feeling wiser.

I would actually love 4 her to return with a new album and a new attitude. 'Cuz the last time she put out more albums I couldn't even afford to buy it but just watch and enjoy. Not to say I hate her or dislike her for what reason 'cuz we know what have happened. She just got lost into sum things and never made a quite decision to let it out and move on. Now that's she revisit back to her former style and all that, she knew she had a chance to make in the public. Well anyway, things done and said back to the album. I luv every song that it is on this album which I'm feelin' today since I listen to it in my early childhood. This could be I got involved in my parents' music collection along with artist I love and liked: Earth Wind & Fire, Marvin Gaye, Diana Ross, Lionel Richie, The Commodores, Phil Collins, Steely Dan, Saturday Night Fever Soundtrack, Grover Washington, Jr., Donald Byrd, Kool and the Gang, Barry White, Lisa Stansfield, Patti Labelle, Aretha Franklin, Ray Parker Jr., Bobby Womack, Isaac Hayes, Luther Vandross, just to name others I mentioned. Cool album, best breakthrough 2 make would give it a A- 'cuz of it's intention and vulnerability of that records. Incls. duets from Jermaine Jackson, Kashif and the legendary Teddy Pendergrass.
B000002572|5.0|I first heard Boston's debut album in the summer of '94 when I was only 11 years old. I remember I was a huge Toto fan back then and asked my dad to lend me some of their records. Dad, who is also a huge rock n roll fan handed me a cd of some strange drawings that I later found out after hours it was guitars as UFO's. That was Boston, their debut album which as soon as I heard the first electric guitar introduction on \\"More Than A Feeling\\" I just raised the volume up and enjoyed what was for me the bestest guitar sound I had ever heard. Once the song was done since I have a bad habit in playing one more time the songs I enjoy, \\"Peace of Mind\\" came on, with which its exciting acoustic guitar playing again became a true instant rock n roll classic tune. After that nothing goes down hill and it keeps its high level of rock n roll intensity. <br /> <br />One of the best rock n roll albums and debuts of all times and a must for any music fans collection.
B00005JKGK|5.0|I thought I'd never find myself reviewing a movie of this standard. Nor did I expect myself to love it at the same time. A Oliver stone production movie, in a pivotal film about both eastern, and western cultures. I adore all of the stories that were told [the character auntie lindo adds awesome humor] but it was the story of June I related to the most. The best actress that has ever graced the show ER. In my opinion. I've found myself into leaning towards Japanese, and [for this movie] Chinese cultures and their ways, and everything else for the last 3 months. This movie has kept me on that steady road.

This is a tasty britpop album with some Blur ingredients in it. If you're a britpop fan and don't own this record then you're no britpop fan at all.
B0000DD7NL|3.0|I'm sorry, but I couldn't help that pun there, even though it was weak.<br /><br />I know you are going to look at my album review and be like \\"he's a hater\\".  Trust me, I love Alicia as much as the next person, but come on!  We waited so long just for this?<br /><br />I'm NOT saying the album is bad, it's just that her lyrical skills seemed to have faltered a bit since her classic debut album.  Sometimes the lyrics are a bit juvenile, whereas other times there actually are some decent lyrics.  Musically, I can see some attempt at growth, but more or less it seems as if people tried to capitalize off the first album.  Case in point:  Even though so many others have said it before, it's quite true....\\"Wake Up\\" and \\"When You Really Love Someone\\" sounds too much like \\"Fallin'\\" to really be interesting enough to like.  I mean, I was like, no.<br /><br />Nevertheless, there are some decent songs on here that actually work.  \\"Karma\\" takes a while to get used to, and the video for the song doesn't help, but the lyrics are great, IMO.  One of life's old adages is put to good use in a song and doesn't sound too cliche'.  \\"You Don't Know My Name\\" is pretty good, with its nice old school feel and catchiness.  Alicia sounds good even if this song was seriously overplayed!  \\"If I Ain't Got You\\" is probably the best song on the album, and Alicia shows off those pipes that we have all come to love.  It's the perfect segue into \\"Diary\\", which has the perfect piano arrangement and flows efforltessly throughout.  Whoever that is singing with Alicia complements her voice toward the end.  \\"When You Really Love Someone\\", \\"Fallin'\\" sample notwithstanding, actually sounds good and is kinda catchy.  And both the interludes work well.  \\"Feeling U, Feeling Me\\" is a nice interlude that sounds good, but \\"Nobody Not Really\\" has the perfect mix of vocals and tight lyrics.  It really should have been a full song because it sounds so good.  I know this might sound sad, but that song is my favorite on the album.<br /><br />Now let's get to the bad....sometimes it's good to use some old-school flavor on your album (Beyonce' actually did it well on her album), but when you use it too much, it gets unlistenable.  \\"If I Was Your Woman/Walk On By\\" is just downright wrong from the jump.  When I initially saw that on the tracklisting, I thought Alicia was going to remake it with the soul....instead, we get a overproduced hip-hoppy song....you can't take a sould classic and make it a hip-hop joint that actually is good.  Come on Alicia!  \\"Dragon Days\\" is just not a song that I expected Alicia to have on here, it's definitely filler.  \\"Samsonite Man\\" would have been better had a male artist played the Samsonite Man and sang a verse.<br /><br />Of course, the album is not a total waste and possibly can be listened to throughout as background music while you are reading.  But if you are looking for something to really listen to, this isn't quite it.  You may have to skip a few songs, but it's still decent.favorite on the album. <br /> <br />Now let's get to the bad....sometimes it's good to use some old-school flavor on your album (Beyonce' actually did it well on her album), but when you use it too much, it gets unlistenable.  \\"If I Was Your Woman/Walk On By\\" is just downright wrong from the jump.

B00006690G|1.0|Eminem's third LP clealry shows how much this man is trying to still be up there where he was back when he first started. At first it was interesting bashing his mom, being angry, saying how he would kill you and all that gang-sta garbage. Now, it's pathetic. This man has more money than he could ever dream of aswell with success and yet he's still trying even harder to do it again when there's no need to. Besides, it's an insult how he could take Aerosmith's \\"Dream On\\" and flip it around like he did, converting a classic tune into a real waste of plastic.  <br /> <br />Unless you're 13, wanna wear P.

Bargain-Another classic that is as great as Baba O Riley. 7/10 <br /> <br />3. Love Ain't For Keeping-Good but short. 4/10 <br /> <br />4. My Wife-Some people say this song is funny and it is. Good song too. 7/10 <br /> <br />5. The Song Is Over-Good but not as good as the rest. 3/10 <br /> <br />6. Getting In Tune-This is a good song, but ends good. 6/10 <br /> <br />7. Going Mobile-Another classic. 5/10 <br /> <br />8. Behind Blue Eyes-Great vocals by Daltrey and overall great song. 8/10 <br /> <br />9. Won't Get Fooled Again-What can I say, this is the best hard <br />rock song ever did. Great vocals by Daltrey and Keith even better <br />on the drums. Great closing with my favorite Daltrey scream. <br />And it's my favorite song on the whole album. 1,000,000,000/10 <br /> <br />10. Pure and Easy-Good, good guitars and good ending. 5/10 <br /> <br />11. Baby Don't You Do It-Pretty good. 6/10 <br /> <br />12. Naked Eye-Keith does good work on this song working on his <br />drums. One of the great ones. 8/10 <br /> <br />13. Water-This track is no good, bad vocals but good guitars. <br />I say this is the worst track on the whole album. 2/10 <br /> <br />14. Too Much of Anything-Weak not good but better vocals. 2/10 <br /> <br />15. I Don't Even Know Myself-Little better, better riffs. 6/10 <br /> <br />16. Behind Blue Eyes-Same track 8 tracks later on. 8/10 <br /> <br />Overall great album. You aught to get this album.
0452282152|1.0|I can not understand all the hallaballoo about this work. I kept waiting for the story to unfold. OK, the principal character is 16, but must the writing style be of a 16 year old. If this book had not been give the promotional spin it recieved, it would have been relagated to the fiction section of the local supermarket.<br /><br />Perhaps it would make a good Hollywood movie.
B0006B2A2E|5.0|This movie is not only original and creative and extremely well acted . . . it's also funny, touching, moving, sad, and thought-provoking.  While I enjoyed Charlie Kaufman's previous work (Adaptation, Being John Malkovich), I found them to be \\"original,\\" but mostly for the sake of originality.  In the end, the finished product did not add up to the sum of their interesting parts.  Eternal Sunshine, on the other hand, was a delight from start to finish.  While it may be difficult to follow for some viewers, it is worth the effort and stands up even better over repeated viewings.  It's the most romantic of any movie I've seen in years and probably the best movie of 2004.  I found it far better than Finding Neverland, which although good, did not come close to resonating as deeply as Eternal Sunshine.
B0006HXXBA|5.0|This is going to be a great year.  First, Cradle of Filfth makes people aware of black metal.  Next, Judas Priest comes out with their first album with Rob Halford in a helluva long time.   <br /> <br />Then Kreator comes out with this.  What a great album.  I just love it.  I listened to it four times over the weekend and it gets better every time I hear it.  It says so much and does it without an ounce of compromise.  All ye other Metal Bands, this is how it's done.  No BS, just pure, unadulterated metal!  From the opening title track, this record just goes and goes.  Kreator just keeps expanding their sound and their music, and the metal just gets better and better.  My favorite songs are \\"Enemy of God\\" (it just rocks) and \\"Suicide Terrorist\\".  But every track is a joy to listen to.  It must be played at volume to get the full effect.  And I loved the extra video added at the end. <br /> <br />With that said, this is going to be a great year for metal, and thankfully Kreator started this year on a huge note.  Along with Cradle and Priest, expect great new material from Slayer (hope they get it done this year), Venom, Nile (a wonderful death metal band from Florida), and an overdue new release from Opeth.

B000002MUW|5.0|Bedtime Stories is the best. How could anyone say it's not her best?! I guess they're not into R&B music. But I love Secret, Take A Bow, Bedtime Stories, and Survival. I like how Madonna went all soulful in this album. It's so different and that's just like her. This is the best album, so there!
B00005JN2Z|1.0|Everything up to the climax was decent, then the whole movie just crashes and burns when the story takes an unbelievable turn and then it ends.
B00018D44U|4.0|This one was a tough review.  I fell in love with Norah Jones' first album Come Away with Me.  Her lyrical power was immense, her voice has that wondrous flow to it that so many try to capture, but few actually reach.  Her songs too, were intensely personal, probably one of the aspects of the album that captivated me the most.  Her decision to keep the record on Blue Note was a great one, IMHO.<br /><br />Her second effort I purchased without hesitation and, after listening to it several times, feel as if there is something missing.  Her voice is still powerful, the music enchanting, but it just doesn't quite have the \\"it\\" of the first.  Her tunes have changed a bit, altering from the blues-jazz emphasis of her first album to a more country vibe.  Also, her lyrics became less of that personal quality that Come Away With Me displayed, where it was isolated in her own realm, to the more general lyrics of her new album.<br /><br />Overall, still a great album, and I recommend it.  Just be prepared for a different aspect of Norah.
B00000JZJ0|2.0|This tepid,disappointing sequel is far better than Beyond the Re-Animator but dosen't equal a good sequel to the excellent original. Dr.Herbert West and his friend Dan re-animate dead bodies and when Dan's girlfriend is dying she is re-animated just like Bride of Frankenstein. The gore effects are good including the crawling eyeball but the movie becomes tedious and more predictable as it goes along. The new director Brian Yuzna does a good job taking over Stuart Gordon but this movie fails to entertain and make watchable that this looks like a Sci/Fi channel movie that would debut on TV and the movie is just disappointing compared to the first with a new cast(Except Jeffrey Combs and Bruce Abbott),lower production values and lower budget,and tepid to atrocious acting. If you seen the first your not missing much but for some reason you can recommend this instead of Beyond the Re-Animator.
B000002JSN|2.0|This album as most knowlegeable fans will tell you is the true Zeppelin magnum opus, not Led Zep IV. If you're thinking of getting it, well, I'm in a postion to do you a real favour. You  might be better getting the Howlin' Wolf, Elmore James and Stevie Wonder albums that Zep were obviously listening to at the time they made these albums.  But that leaves one of the few Zeppelin originals here,  Kashmir, to marvel at. The greatest song, by Page and Plant's always modest admission, by quite possibly the greatest band the world has ever known, or ever will see. If you're thinking of downloading it, don't bother , because I can give it to you now with much less fuss. It goes..      Duh duh duh...duh duh duh....duh duh duh, ( goes higher) duh duh duh... duh duh duh... (repeat for 9 minutes)    And try Zeps other true classic, Whole Lotta Love, which goes    Dah dum duh dum dum.....dum.....dum....dum......dum......dah dum dah dum dum...dum ......    Music doesn't get much better than this, people.
B0001ADAVK|4.0|The social phenomenon known as \\"Women's Lib\\" was years away, yet Miss Katherine Watson, an art history teacher at an exclusive New England all-women's college in the fall of 1953, seemed about to bring its ideas into terra incognita and thus come into conflict with just about everybody. <br /> <br />Julia Roberts plays a character actively challenging the stereotypical thinking behind the motives of the young - and spoilt - twenty-somethings, who have already been more than happy to remain indoctrinated by both men and women into believing that they could achieve all the happiness in the world simply by being in the home at the beck and call of their hard-working husbands. <br /> <br />For them, domesticity seems to be a calling, something which rankles with Watson, who has come all the way from sunny California in the belief that she is preparing tomorrow's leaders at a college, yet, as she says in a moment of emotion to the \\"philandering Italian professor\\", Bill Dunbar (Dominic West), it appears that she is simply grooming tomorrow's leaders' wives at \\"a finishing school disguised as a college\\" instead. <br /> <br />Challenging the status quo via \\"subversive\\" activities is not tolerated at this college by the president, Jocelyn Carr (Marian Seldes), who summarily fires the school nurse, Amanda Armstrong (Juliet Stevenson), for \\"being seen to promote promiscuity\\" by distributing contraceptive devices in spite of having been associated with the college for nearly a quarter-century. <br /> <br />Practically everyone's nemesis appears to be the insufferably overzealous Betty Warren (Kirsten Dunst), whose mother (Donna Mitchell) just happens to be the president of the college alumnae association. Watson will not tolerate any challenge to her own authority from this student, who appears to be just as ready to be as subversive as her, yet at the same time is receptive to questioning her expected role as devoted wife, domestic, and future mother in the light of her mother's insistence that she stay with a husband who thinks more of his job than he does of her. <br /> <br />In the meantime, Watson is exasperated by everyone else's blind acceptance of this kind of role for \\"educated\\" women and openly asks Carr if she is proud of her students. The president's response serves only to drive Watson almost to the point of telling everyone exactly what she thinks of the whole situation. <br /> <br />Through not teaching what is on the art history syllabus, Watson encourages those who wear rose-tinted spectacles to think outside the box. She expects them to challenge accepted norms about what is supposed to be acceptable, who is supposed to think so and, above all, why it is supposed to be so. She uses modern, not classical, art as her medium for getting the young women to become forward thinkers, much to the consternation of Carr, who urges Watson to remember that \\"we are traditionalists\\", to which remark Watson says dryly, \\"Yes, I've noticed.\\" <br /> <br />This is mainly Roberts' movie, as she maintains her screen presence by never exaggerating the emotions of the main character, being as abrasive and blunt when she needs to be (\\"'A girdle will set you free'? What does that mean?!\\") and as compassionate about her work and her students when she needs to be. The main cast of female supporting actors, Dunst, Julia Stiles, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Ginnifer Goodwin, give sterling performances as the young women who seem ready to embrace the lifestyle of middle-class wives pushing vacuum cleaners and using washing machines, but gradually become accustomed to thinking that there just might be a way to balance both being wives and being career women.  <br /> <br />This is despite the fact that, for one, Joan Brandwyn (Stiles) is totally prepared to throw away the chance to go to Yale law school by telling Watson that \\"this is all I've always wanted - a home and a family\\". Watson's face shows her predictable reaction yet congratulates her on her sudden marriage in the hope that she might just think about her actions. Certainly, Watson believed that she was definitely not ready to marry herself, and the scene in the common room where she publicly scotched the rumors of an impending marriage was memorable, since it challenged the young women's perception of her as \\"anti-marriage\\" and \\"anti\\" anything else she was thought not to like. <br /> <br />Overall, Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal have written, while Mike Newell has directed, a very enjoyable movie about the pros and cons of embracing a particular piece of (now largely outdated) ideology, even if it was never meant to be a social history polemic. However, the characters, including those who may be perceived as being utterly shallow and narrow-minded, are made quite believable by the actors. The contrast between the initial naivety of Watson and her disillusionment with the mindset of the staff and students is quite stark, and Roberts does a good job from start to finish in portraying the one \\"caught in the middle\\" between traditionalism and feminism. Watson is uncompromising in her views, yet proves to be dedicated to her job - even if she is basically a misfit in the college - and compassionate to those around her. <br />
B0006IUDXA|5.0|ALL I CAN SAY IS HOT DARN! IT'S ABOUT TIME and WHAT IN HECK TOO YOU SO LONG, PARAMOUNT?    Seriously, they could be the worst DVD's in all of creation and I'd still be THRILLED. I love MacGyver to death, always have, and have lived with CRAPPY tapes since the show was first on. This show is a CULT CLASSIC, to the point where \\"MacGyver\\" and/or \\"Macgyverism\\" is actually now in some dictionaries as being popular slang for \\"rigging an answer to a problem out  of the unexpected!\\"  I mean where CAN'T you go on this planet, and say the name \\"MacGyver\\" and NOT get a grin in response?     RDA could probably travel to Tibet and he'd still hear the name somewhere I am sure and yet, no tapes, no DVD's not for decades?      LONG OVERDUE this one....    I only hope that the last set also includes the movies as well...    I'd like a COMPLETE set of MagGyver DVD's if you please...    Now excuse me, because I am going off to order mine....    :)     PS: Thanks Rick! I am quite sure you must have had something to do with this one finally being released...For years this series was treated like a second class citizen by the PTB. The fans clamored but we got ignored. We begged for tapes (and later DVD's)and never got them. I do know that several times you stepped up to the plate to say \\"Hey, this one deserves better\\" and that \\"someday if they heard you\\" we'd get our \\"Mac\\" DVD's and I do indeed thank you for that...    Now if you can just get them to release \\"Legend?\\" I'd be one happy RDA fan indeed....
B000000OAL|4.0|As an avid Queen fan, I was quite impressed with Queen's debut album. The opening track, \\"keep yourself alive\\" is the strongest, while the album also contains other strong, heavy tracks such as: \\"liar\\", \\"great king rat\\", and \\"son & daughter\\". Another highlight to the album is Roger Taylor's short, but upbeat rock song, \\"Modern Times rock n' roll\\". I wouldn't suggest you buy it if you're new to Queen though.<br /><br />Song by Song:<br /><br />1. Keep Yourself Alive: The best song off the album which has a brilliant guitar intro into the song. One of Queen's best. 10/10<br /><br />2. Doing Alright: A pretty ballad, with a very nice piano intro. At times it drags on though. 8.5/10<br /><br />3. Great King Rat: A powerful, heavy rock song from Queen that is of excellent quality. 9/10<br /><br />4. My Fairy King: A nice, high pitched tune which is very strong in tone. 9/10<br /><br />5. Liar: An energetic, fast moving rock song that gives you a different chorus each time. 9.5/10<br /><br />6. The night comes down: A strong intro with the guitar getting heavier and heavier. However, the song weakens near the end. 8/10<br /><br />7. Modern Times Rock n' Roll: One of Roger Taylor's best despite the short length of the track. 9.5/10<br /><br />8. Son & Daughter: A heavy rock song which offers nothing you see from Queen as the years go on. 9/10<br /><br />9. Jesus: Bad. I'd rank it Queen's worst song if it weren't for the guitar riff at the end by May.4/10<br /><br />10. Seven Seas of Rhye: Seemingly pointless as they hadn't developed this song on its release for this album. This version is only 1 minute long and contains no lyrics. 8/10<br /><br />11. Mad the Swine(previously unreleased): There is a good reason that they didn't release this when they first put out this album. Far from Queen's style, it is more of a Christian pop-rock tune.  4.5/10<br /><br />12. Keep Yourself Alive(long lost re-take): A very strong re-take which offers a totally different sound. 9/10<br /><br />13. Liar(1991 bonus remix): This isn't a strong remix because there are very minor, practically unnoticable changes. 8/10e changes. 8/10
B00005B364|4.0|I was introduced to Focus through the song Hocus Pocus. A quite bizarre song BUT a good one. Some of the best drumming and guitarwork in all of classic rock! <br /> <br />Not only that, it was The Guess Who who introduced me to it. When the fake Guess Who (only Jim Kale & Garry Peterson were a part of it from the classic line-up) played a show locally (free so i went) they did Hocus Pocus to do their band introductions... at first i couldnt figure out what Guess Who song it was, then i heard the yodeling and thought wow, thats not Guess Who, so who the hell is it? After the show, replacement vocalist, Terry Hatty told me who Focus was and urged me to check them out, so i did. <br /> <br />This was one of the 2 albums i got. (The other being the best of 16 track cd) I was blown away. Just sit with headphones on and listen to gems like Focus 2 over and over. You will hear a different part every time. Same with Eruption featuring some of the greatest guitarwork (in the Bridge section) and some of the most beautiful piano work (in the Eurdice section). Janis sounds like a slow Jethro Tull song (in fact when i DJ i play it during dinner hour and people ask me what Tull album it is on. Le Clochard is a short piece and decent. Moving waves is bizarre with the only vocals on the album except for a short piece in Eruption and that damn yodeling. <br /> <br />Actually i love the yodeling, drive down a 65 max limit interstate with it playing. Especially when you are angry. I guarantee Yodeling along (and driving at around 85 by the time you are done) will reduce the stress. (just make sure the windows are closed) <br /> <br />A Must have if you like Emerson Lake & Palmer & Jethro Tull. <br /> <br />Please check out my other reviews and vote for them. <br />
B000000OQF|5.0|The debut album for Guns n' Roses was and will remain one of the greatest debuts of all time for a rock group. In a time where disco-pop music ruled the music scene, Guns n' Roses unleashed a new phase of rock which was at the time unsurpassable. Guns n' Roses brought raw, vicious rock n' roll to the charts as lead singer Axl Rose screeched lyrics about sex and drugs, and guitarist Slash smashed out brilliant guitar riffs.<br /><br />Song by Song:<br /><br />1. Welcome to the jungle: one of the three huge hits of this album. An outstanding beginning to one of the best rock n' roll albums of all time. Who can dislike it: \\"sha-na-na-na knees, knees!\\"<br /><br />2. It's so easy: Although fairly underrated, this track is one of my favourites of the album. A wonderful opening guitar intro into the heavy rock side of the track. It is very well paced and contains a highly energetic beat to it. We here Axl go lower in this one and Duff Mcgackan backs it on vocals throughout the heavy track.<br /><br />3. Night Train: It's your typical GNR song. Heavy, rockish guitar playing from Slash and Axl Rose unleashes the powerful chorus throughout the last minute of the song.<br /><br />4. Out Ta Get Me: This track contains explicit lyrics which is the most appealing part of the song. Similar to night train, Axl is closing out the song screeching the chorus: \\"they're out ta get me, they won't catch me, cause I'm innocent!\\"<br /><br />5. Mr. Brownstone: This song was written by bassist Duff and it is nothing short of brilliant. He explores the life of himself and Slash as they once struggled through a heroin addiction. This is probably the best song written by Duff in his time with GNR.<br /><br />6. Paradise City: This track is an all-time favourite for most GNR fans. Axl is especially strong singing this track live, but of course the original is nothing short of brilliant. This touched many GNR fans including me and should be considered one of the greatest rock songs of all time.<br /><br />7. My Michelle: This is a heavy, ugly rock song in the lyrical stand point. Rose shouts out lyrics relating to cocaine and sex in this track. It has a classic intro, somewhat similar to the intro of the \\"Use Your Illusion I\\" hit, \\"Don't Cry\\". However, this track becomes heavy and contains outstanding energy and excitement in the chorus.<br /><br />8. Think about you: This track is one of the lightest in terms of the lyrics. This is a beautiful song that can be appreciated by most rock n' roll fans as a touching song.<br /><br />9. Sweet Child O' Mine: This song made Guns n' Roses superstars. It begins with a beautiful guitar solo from Slash and then Axl begins singing the beautiful lyrical tune. This is probably GNR's best ballad.<br /><br />10. You're Crazy: This is heavy, quick and entertaining. Non GNR fans won't like this song but it's a favourite for any hardcore GNR fan. It stays quick throughout and Axl delivers powerful lyrics. GNR Lies sticks in a slower paced, and sensational version of it if you're interested.<br /><br />11. Anything Goes: This song relates to sex and is one of the weakest off Appetite for Destruction. It still contains an upbeat rock n' roll sound but lacks in the lyrical standpoint.<br /><br />12. Rocket Queen: This is a nice way to end the album. It begins with a 45 second instrumental intro which leads into an all-around solid track.<br /><br />Therefore, it is clear in my mind that this is a must own Metal album, featuring superb guitar riffs, awesome lyrics with a vengeance, and definitive and catchy tunes. A must buy for all metal fans and someone interested in GNR music.he lyrical stand point. Rose shouts out lyrics relating to cocaine and sex in this track.

B00006AW2G|5.0|First of all, I'm going to say this is not any rip off from the Beatles, in fact, it may even be the other way around: This one came out in 1969, and the Beatles album came out in 1970. Of course, Let It Be was recorded before (1968-1969), but nothing was known of it until 1970, in fact, until 1970, the name was Get Back, and the single, Let It Be, was something no one, not even the Stones, knew about until 1970, a year after the release of Let It Bleed! <br /> <br />Let It Bleed is one of my favourite albums of all time, if it's not my favourite. It starts off with my favourite song of all time, Gimme Shelter, a song about how war is going to kill us all. Simple, happy beats thanks to Charlie at the drums, \\"oooh yeahs\\" and \\"woo\\"'s by Mick and Mary Clayton (hope I got the name right) and happy piano are the opposite for the dark basslines, the dark lyrics, and the storm-like feeling the song has. Excellent solo by Mr. Keef Richards.  <br /> <br />Next comes a Robert Johnson song, called Love In Vain, that isn't exceptionally great but it isn't a feeling either. I don't understand why people don't like Country Honk, it's equally great to Honky Tonk Women, and that is good. Live With Me is a great song, the happiest up to now. Let It Bleed is even happier, with provocative lyrics and catchy melodies, great to sing along. I don't understand why people don't like this version of Midnight Rambler, it's awesome! One of my favourites here. You Got The Silver isn't very interesting, it's just Keith on vocals and a normal slow rock n' roll song, though it's final moments are excellent, and make the song. <br /> <br />Another highlight is Monkey Man, my second favourite on the album. It starts off creepy, like Gimme Shelter's legendary superintro, that will make you dance, and when Mick's funny lyrics with Keith's fantastic guitars, and they are truly amazing, you will play air guitar and pretend you're singing even if you don't know the words. The first verses are a mix of pop, rock, and a lot of pace changing. Then comes a Keith solo, that is good, but Stu's piano solo is the second greatest solo in the album! And in the final moments, Mick does sound like a monkey and you'll laugh your head off.  <br /> <br />You Can't Always Get What You Want is the weakest moment along with You Got The Silver, it's an epic that everyone knows but it isn't that good for me.  <br /> <br />Well, I often put \\"stop\\" after Monkey Man or play the album again, and sometimes listen to YCAGWYW. This album is great.
B000000OSG|4.0|I am one of the biggest Guns n' Roses fans you'll ever meet but the reason I'm giving out 4 stars is because this album is strictly for hardcore GNR fans only. This album displays Axl Rose's outrageous instability, however the song writing is remarkably well done.<br /><br />Song by Song:<br /><br />1. Civil War: This is the most powerful song on the album in terms of the meaning. Lyrically its brilliant, as the GNR crew is not afraid to touch on a very controversial issue. GNR decided to bring in Steven Adler on drums for this one and he did a wonderful job. Also, I'm charmed by the fantastic solo coming from who else other than Slash. When I bought this album, I listened to this track over and over again, and each time I loved it. Truly brilliant. 10/10<br /><br />2. 14 Years: This song is typical GNR, however they're not especially heavy on this track. Once again, the crew gives a strong lyrical performance. It's tune isn't wonderful, but its pretty good. 8.5/10<br /><br />3. Yesterdays: This is probably the best song, musically, off the album. It has a beautiful tune to it and it's one of GNR's classic ballads. 9.5/10<br /><br />4. Knockin' on Heaven's Door: This Bob Dylan cover has a splendid beginning to it, however they drag this track on much too long. Bob Dylan wrote it as being 2:32 while GNR felt it necessary to be 5:36. They give a beautiful melody, however some feel that Axl Rose's screeching, high voice doesn't fit well with this song. I like the song, but it has been criticized. 8.5/10<br /><br />5. Get in the ring: This song gives us the idea of how psychotic and disillusioned Axl Rose is. He yells out profanities at reviewers who gave GNR bad reviews and continues on cursing until the end. It carries an interesting melody to it and can be catchy but this is a little too outrageous of a track for me to praise. 6.5/10<br /><br />6. Shotgun Blues: This song is falling back on the quick, sharp rockish sound we heard from alot in \\"Use Your Illusion I\\". It has a great flow to it, and is paced very nicely. It's one of my favourites off this album. 9.5/10<br /><br />7. Breakdown: Breakdown carries a beautiful, touching tune to it with a lame, pointless chorus that puts it average overall in terms of GNR music. The ballad is beautifully orchestrated and it is strong lyrically until you reach the chorus that could've been so much more. 8/10<br /><br />8. Pretty tied up: The tune is catchy, yet possesses nothing to consider it a great song. It's quite overrated. It's a good song, no more than that. 8.5/10<br /><br />9. Locomotive: WOW! This song is a true classic from GNR, and what's so great about it is that it's something totally new. None of the other hits coming from GNR resemble this song. It has an excellent melody mixed in with nice guitar riffs from Slash. 10/10<br /><br />10. So Fine: Bassist Duff McKagan should receive a ton of praise for this heart-warming ballad. This is the best song he ever wrote in his time with GNR and it's built upon a wonderful melodic tune. I was quite impressed with the lyrical quality of this song too. 9.5/10<br /><br />11. Estranged: I don't no how to describe how good this song is so I'll just use one word. Amazing. 10/10<br /><br />12. You could be mine: This tune is possibly the heaviest off the album and they've done a great job with it. An outstanding chorus as they took a phrase that can be read in the \\"appetite for destruction\\" album: \\"with your b-tch slap rapping and your cocaine tongue you get nothin' done\\". 9/10<br /><br />13. Don't Cry (Alt. Lyrics): This tune taken from \\"Use Your Illusion I\\" is a beautiful ballad. However, the original is far superior on the lyrical standpoint. Still, I can't get enough of this tune so it still gets 9/10<br /><br />14. My World: Hmmmm. This one is hard to describe. It's whacky, confusing and interesting. It shows us the twisted mind of Rose and also has a nice little punk side to it which I eventually caught on to a little despite Rose'scrude lyrical insight on supposedly how he lives his life. 7.5/10

B0002IVN9W|5.0|I've been listening to this album for a couple of months and just saw these guys perform in Houston a couple of nights ago.  They had 7 people playing and the instruments included guitar, bass, drums, marching band drums, upright bass, accordion, keyboard, and 2 violins.  Man they tore the house down.  Powerful music.  Makes the album even better now when I listen to it.  Believe the hype.  I am still blown away.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I think this movie was about how awkward and weird childhood is-and the eccentric people we meet.  Yeah, he's different-so-the more enduring part, i think, is the details-having a long friggin telephone extension cord-double image school pictures-funny as hell and all the other things that make childhood fun to reminisce about. <br /> <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|[I have also written reviews for the other album of the year nominees]    It had never before occurred to me that I would buy a Green Day (GD) album. But after the grammy nominations were announced, I decided to pick it up for a listen. I was throughly impressed. Don't get me wrong - I have heard Green Day stuff before this, but none sounded as right as this album did.    Musically, albeit tightly laced with loud guitar riffs and pummelling drum beats, is musical bliss; each song carrying a definitive melody. Plus - the songwriting is excellent; GD has a great sense of putting together chords that make you smile and have your feet tapping and head nodding and before you know it you're just sucked into their zone...    Amongst all the noise which IS rock, GD has enlisted many instruments and executed them most creatively that make this album an artistic masterpiece. You have the basic rock track in \\"American Idiot\\"; on \\"Give Me Novocaine\\", you hear something reminiscent of a steel pedal which one finds in most country tracks; on \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\" the track builds up deliciously layer by layer - the muscial craftmanship of GD is admirable; the two medleys are also standouts with different tunes chalked up giving you a wide array of tastefully composed songs.    The anthemic \\"Are We The Waiting\\" brings to mind audiences at a live GD gig, all pumping hands up into the air and chanting along with these 3 rockers who have indeed come a long way.    Don't let a fear for loud music put you off - this is no hard rock stuff. It's rock like you've not heard before; it is melodious, it is nice to sing to without screaming your voice hoarse and blowing up your lungs attempting it; every track is interesting standing on its own. Green Day exhibits the rock n roll skills of U2 and mashes it up with the good 'ol tunes as one would find in Sheryl Crow's CDs. THIS IS 'OLD SCHOOL'.    Out of the 5 album of the year nominees - American Idiot by Green Day is, in my opinion, the standout winner.
0316172324|4.0|Like Gladwell's first effort, \\"The Tipping Point,\\" this book is fun and easy to read.  Gladwell uses well-chosen stories to illustrate each of the points he makes and has a gift for telling the stories in a way that flows and keeps you interested.  That is the great news about this book.    Unlike \\"The Tipping Point,\\" however, \\"Blink\\" doesn't arrive at a coherent and usable conclusion.  It starts with the promising premise about the power of first impressions and gets you interested to learn how you might be able to make first impressions - both your own and others' - work better for you. It seems a very reasonable expectation if you've read \\"Tipping Point.\\"  Unfortunately, \\"Blink\\" breaks down into an ambiguous \\"sometimes first imprssions help, sometimes they hurt\\" conclusion that leaves you underwhelmed.    If you haven't read \\"Tipping Point,\\" go there first.  If you have and you really liked it, you will get more of the great writing and story-telling from this book, but not the useful conclusion.
B0000DD7LC|3.0|[I have written reviews for other Album of the Year nominees] <br /> <br />Alicia Keys: She came, she saw, she conquered. How else to describe this new phenomenon that seems to get bigger with each track or album she releases? Who still remembers the day when she just debuted with 'Fallin' and then went on to sweep 5 grammys, when you look at her now? <br /> <br />Now, her sophomore effort is just as good, if not better. The songs here are more approachable than Songs in A Minor, albeit only after a few listens. The upside is you don't get tired of listening to the songs like how many felt with Songs in A Minor. <br /> <br />The disc starts of very strongly, with Keys' signature intro: graceful and masterful piano playing and then joined with some 'drop the beat' good thumps. This basically lets you in on what to expect on the whole CD. The music here is organic and the feel is so edgy. If Keys wanted to convey her groove amidst the melody, she has successfully done so. Every song has your head nodding to it. <br /> <br />The songwriting is immaculate on Karma, Harlem's Nocturne, If I Ain't Got You (a definite winner for If I Ain't Got You) BUT the consistency falters a bit here and there on the disc. There are times when the songs keep playing but they simply don't grab your attention. And you can't easily hum those tunes.  <br /> <br />I would give this CD 3.5 stars if the grading system allowed me to. 3rd choice for album of the year. <br /> <br />It's just Keys' 2nd album - she'll be here for a long while, and we can keep expecting good stuff from her.
B0006399FS|5.0|Giving this album less than three stars just shows how difficult it is to be one of the world's biggest bands. Giving it three stars means that you don't like the band. That's ok. Not everyone can like U2, but let's be reasonable. Any other band would automatically get five stars on this album. Let's stay focused on the music. It's great. They are making their kind of music, and you can't say that they are repeating themselves: <br /> <br />All That You Can't Leave Behind - different from HTDAAB <br />Pop - Very different from HTDAAB <br />Zooropa - Extremely different from HTDAAB <br />Achung Baby - different from HTDAAB <br />The Joshua Three - different from HTDAAB <br /> <br />But of course, there will always be something like U2. You can't demand that they should put away the guitar for one album and the drums for the next. No band has ever made such original albums as U2. They will always be U2, and this album shows that they're one of the greatest right now.
B0002F7I9Y|4.0|[I have also written reviews for the other Album of the Year Nominees]    This album is RICH. It is rich in its musical arrangement; it is rich with voices as contributed by the 12 artists; and it is richly filled with great songs.    The standouts are \\"Here We Go Again\\" (with Norah Jones), \\"You Don't Know Me\\" (with Diana Krall) and \\"Over The Rainbow\\" (with Johnny Mathis). I could listen to these tracks over and over again. But this CD has a couple of dull moments particularly around tracks 8-10; hence 4 stars.    Ray Charles was a musical genius, truly. But his voice here seems tired, though still emotionally showy. In my opinion, it is the Company that brings the light to this Genius's album.     If this CD should win the Album of the Year, it would be purely out of respect and as a token of appreciation as well as closure to a musical great. Having said that, Genius Loves Company is a must buy - CDs such as this are very rare nowadays when manufactured pop and overrated R&B/Hip-Hop saturate the music scene. Unlike the lifeless digitally enhanced beats and voices, this is pure soul and music - and of course, musicians and artist enjoying what they do and doing it to their very best.    This album is be my 2nd pick after Green Day to win Album of the Year.
B00005N5RM|5.0|I thought maybe this was going to be another B-movie remake of a classic with lame affects since it was the eighties. I was extremely surprised to see how real everything looked. the special effects were incredible considering it was somewhat low-bugdet. The underrated actors played good rolls too, especially Shawnee Smith. Donovan Leitch, brief but efficient.  <br /> <br />When a strange, and mysterious comet suddenly crashes to earth in the outskirts of the small quiet town of Arborville, only four seemingly innocent people have witnessed the scene. When two of them suddenly disappear without a trace, and even more residents of aborville do too, the people who are left know something has to be wrong.  <br /> <br />Witnesses claim that the meteor that came to earth produced a strange gel substance that sticks to anything it touches. The blob like thing has also been seen devouring people by absorbing, and melting them. As the blob gets bigger, the population of the town gets smaller, and things get even stranger though. Before anyone even knows what's going on, a shadowy organazation group made up of scientists has been investigating the site where the thing crashed. As the scientists grow even more interested, the Blob grows even bigger, and nothing in it's path will stop it.  <br /> <br />I have to say that all the versions of the blob had pretty good special effects for their time. The first was good for thrills, the sequel to the first was good for laughs, and the last one was made for extreme gross outs, and scares. Just make sure no one under the age of 11 sees this version. I saw this when I was merely ten because of the fact that I had seen the original and was interested in the remake. There's a scene where the underrated Donovan Leitch gets devoured by the blob (a very subtle image of it on the front cover compared to what really happened in the movie) and it devistated me for life.  <br /> <br />As a result, I only saw it one other time, and that was when I was eleven. Not much a difference in the scares, but for about a year, I had to sleep with a blanket over my head to make sure the blob wasn't going to ooze out on top of me. I'm 14 now, but I'm not really sure I want to take the risk of seeing it again. Those nightmares can be pretty scary. The movies still very vivid to me anyway. Make sure to sleep with your fire extinguisher after watching this movie. You'll need it. <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The shortest lived of Whedon's shows, Firefly was, ironically, the one that most deserved success. It possessed all the wit, intelligence, drama and Charm of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and its spinoff Angel, and then some. Every aspect of the show was exemplary: its thrilling plots, clever dialogue, amazingly likeable characters and and a smattering of entigueing mysterious which were never resolved, combined to make this the most unique and interesting science fiction TV show in years. Here's hoping the upcoming movie, Serenity, will match its quality and provide closure for some of the many dangling plot threads.
0553801546|5.0|Robin Hobb is one of the most amazing authors whose books I have ever read, especially compared to modern fantasy writers.  The characters are so complex and multifaceted and so are the plots.  I found myself in fool's fate and in the liveship series completely emotionally attached.  Honestly, I have to say that Fitz is not my favorite character.  I love the Fool and I love all of the secrets that come with the Fool.  I love the way that Hobb works all three series together.  It's fantastic and a breath of fresh air for those of us who don't want to read 10-book long fantasy series that all follow the same format. I was sad when this book was over, because it really was the end....  Maybe Hobb will write about the Vestrits and the Liveships again??
B00009QG73|3.0|On the good side, this DVD has a good selection of songs, drawing at least one song from each album. There is even a leaning more towards the older material.  The songs are fairly well played and are fairly close to the original versions.  Phil Manzanera and Paul Thompson get high marks for really getting into the concert and seeming excited and showing some youthful spirit.  Another bonus with the DVD is that you have the option of displaying the lyrics/words on the TV as they are being sung.  There is also a video that shows the behind-the-scenes activities leading up to the show.    On the down side, this is showing a sort of fake version of Roxy Music.  Although there are four original members, there are 5 or so other younger members that sort of drown out visions of the classic Roxy lineup.  Ferry does a fairly good job with many of the songs, but kind of lazily drifts through some of the heavier songs (most notably Out of the Blue).  So some of the songs lack the vocal dynamics that made him so interesting in the \\"good old days\\".      In all fairness, we can't expect the core band musicians - now in their 50's - to be the energetic guys they were in the 1970s (when they were in their 20s).  If you like the later, mellower Roxy albums, you'll probably get into this.  If you long for the stranger early period, check out the MusikLaden video.  That shows them back in the days when they were actually creating these songs.  But nonetheless, Live at the Apollo is still a decent represention of the band, especially of their wide variety of music, from heavy to soft, from pop to weirdness, and everything in between.    Highlights include Both Ends Burning, Re-make Re-model, Out of the Blue, Virginia Plain.

B0002X314C|5.0|This has to be the one of the most mature and soulful R&B albums ever.  \\"Get Lifted\\" has enough to satisfy the musical tastebuds of everyone.  Such a talented and skillful writer, Legend exceeds the expectation of a newcomer and has deemed himself to be just that, A LEGEND!  More than music, the lyrics, tunes, and ever changing vocal sounds create an atmosphere to get you lifted.
B0006IIPIK|2.0|\\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\", is a futuristic 1930's movie serial drama type of genre. This movie reminded me of an old colorized classic like \\"The Maltese Falcon\\" but not as good. A sort of Flash Gordon meets Star Wars kind of film. The \\"hero\\" of the move is a piolit of a flying tiger air craft that can go for ever on a tank of gas and if in trouble; can dive into the ocean at a great speed with out falling apart. It then has the ability to become an under water mode of transportation. The heroin she's the 1990's women's liberated Lois Lane news reporter type, who is out for the next big news paper, hold the presses, stop everything scoop of her life.  Campy at times and cute, this movie falls a little short of being a classic by any stretch of the imagination. But then again, I think, that was what the movies intent was all along. One wouldn't miss much if they missed this film but it is good wholesome family entertainment. 2  stars.
B0006A9FKA|2.0|It seemed this movie was quite confused with it self. It wasn't sure if it was a comedy, love story, horror flick, slap stick, serious???? What ever, I made it through it...barely. Of the entire movie one part hand me laughing to tears. It was a long road to get there but it was ALMOST worth the watch just for that one scene. I'm not going to give anything away aside from saying, Queen and pool.
0380778556|5.0|Daphne du Maurier's love story is a story about love, yes, but it is also a testament to her love for Cornwall.  The moors , beaches and woods in this beautiful part of the world are described and portrayed as only by one who has lived and loved in this part of the world can.  The story is about a house as well as people.  The mysterious house of Manderley with all its secrets is the setting of this novel.  Ms. du Maurier actually based her Manderley on an actual house found in Cornwall called Menabilly.  The story is about a well-bred, but penniless young woman who makes a brilliant marriage to Max de Winter.  All seems to be wonderful for her, but then it becomes sad and quite menacing to Rebecca because her Max seems to be ruled by another woman, and that woman is not alive, so it's very difficult for her to compete.  The novel is a haunting and lovely story about the sadness that this young woman encounters during her married life and what she did about it.  A true Gothic treasure.
B00005JNBQ|2.0|How ever much money it cost to make this movie you can bet that 3/4 of that budget went to buy pot to keep the lead characters stoned out of their minds. <br /> <br />I was surprised they didn't drool on them selves, although I'm sure they did at some point, maybe if they ever release out-takes you'll see it. Couple of funny parts sprinkled in to a story that seemed to have been made up as they went along. To be honest with you I think I laughed at parts that weren't meant to be laughed at. <br /> <br />I was pretty let down with this movie after all the hype. I guess if you are still in Junior High it might have been hilarious. But over all I feel it was a wasted 2 hours of my life. But what else would one expect from brain-dead MTV? <br />
B00005YW4H|2.0|Honestly, I tried to like Norah Jones's whole thing, but I am hard pressed to be interested on an ongoing basis.    It's certainly NOT because of a lack of talent, nor for lack of capable musicians (she's got 'em both in spades), but the harsh truth is, her music is so monochromatic and one-dimensional, at least on disc. Doesn't she do anything besides MELLOW?    These same songs, if given varying tempos and arrangements could've been very cool, but here, it's just the same danged thing over and over.    ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
B00004SCX6|4.0|I actually like this CD... I don't agree with the others who say she's crap... I think they are jealous. It sounds good to me, and obviously somebody likes her if she's continuously selling millions.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|I saw this movie in the theaters when it came out and i was not very impressed, but because i am a will ferrell fan i bought it on dvd when it came out. I enjoyed it so much more when i watched it on dvd alone, instead of in the theaters. The movie put me back into the holiday spirit, even though the holidays were over about a month ago and what arrive again for a long time. It is a classic Will Ferrell comedy, because they give him so many chances to improvise. The movie has a great story about a misfit Elf in the big city, reminded me a lot of 'Jungle 2 Jungle' with Tim Allen. The Infinifilm features are amazing. You can watch the movie, and then little popups on the bottom will give you the choice to \\"see how Will Ferrell shot this scene\\" or \\"See Will's Double shooting this scene\\", etc. I learned many things about camera movements and special features such as how Buddy seems so BIG in the workshop while all the elves are making toys, and then how the elves seem so small when Buddy is at his home with papa elf. Pretty amazing stuff on a lot of different camera perspectives. The movie is great for the whole family, and the DVD features are great. highly recommended!
B00005JNBQ|1.0|Is this supposed to be art?  Because it has no other value, other than perhaps for the purpose of studying the effects of boredom on the human psyche.  I kept expecting the main character to be a hero, instead he's just a loser.  I can appreciate a movie without a hero (i.e. Being John Malkovich) but can't they at least make the loser character someone who does something...anything...interesting? <br /> <br />Also, the other characters are really weak.  The best potential characters, the grandma for example, are barely ever on screen. <br /> <br />I  thought this movie would be like Rushmore, and I couldn't have been more wrong. <br /> <br />I will say one thing positive about it, though, there is a scene where Napolean goes to jump his bike on a ramp and instead just plows through it - a really funny gag, I have to admit...most of us have done something like that. <br /> <br />In summary, might be worth it if you can rent it cheap and get a backup movie, but I wouldn't recommend buying it.
B000001Y79|5.0|This is a great album. Before the rec execs got to her and she was changing her look every other day, she really had a good sound and image, I think.
0385510454|2.0|Grisham takes a break from his usual legal thriller to give us a just plain thriller. The broker is Joel Backman, a former high stakes DC lawyer who went to prison for trying to sell control of a spy satellite system to the highest bidder. He took prison when several of those in on the conspiracy with him died. Now, four years later, he's released on a last minute presidential pardon so the CIA can figure out who the buyer was when they try to kill him. Joel is sent to Italy where he is immersed in the culture and language and tries to blend into his new life.<br /><br />As usual, Grisham writes a page turner. I chewed up large chunks of this one in a relatively short amount of time. That said, this is not his usual legal thriller. Grisham seems to want to try and just write a thriller and, for the most part, it's not that successful. There are long stretches of the novel where next to no action occurs and the plot doesn't move foward. It reads almost like a travel guide to Bologna, Italy for large sections of the middle of the story as Joel learns about the culture and people. And the suspense sequences aren't quite that suspenseful as there's never any impending doom facing Joel as in other cloak and dagger type thrillers.<br /><br />A good try, John, but not a successful one. You've branched out before with A Time to Kill and A Painted House, both of which are far better novels than this one.
B0006A9FKA|4.0|The more I try explaining Shaun Of The Dead to people, the more puzzled their expressions get...I mean, just how DO you explain the premise of this film without making it sound incredibly dopey? But SOTD delivers as both a zombie flick and a comedy (a zomedy, if you will), and on many levels. There's some great, ummm, brainless slapstick, but there's also many Seinfeld-esque setups hatched throughout, always coming full-circle & paying big dividends. On the other side, it offers a little credibility as a horror flick as well, delivering some genuinely startling moments...arguably, moreso than many of the so-called \\"straight\\" horror movies of late.     But Shaun Of The Dead mostly succeeds because of its characters. Instead of just being zombie fodder, they're people you get attached to & hope make it out alive---and be able to meet you for a few pints afterward. In fact, this film probably wouldn't have worked if it wasn't for the great character development. And I'd also like to add: Lucy Davis (as Dianne) can melt the entire room with her puppy-dog eyes, without her saying a single word...she'd own me, for sure LOL     Anyway, Shaun Of The Dead is destined to be one of those \\"instant cult\\" flicks ala This Is Spinal Tap, so jump on the bandwagon early & see it ASAP... 4.5 stars.
B000007T2Z|2.0|I am a pretty big supporter of the post rock genre. I enjoy bands like slint, explosions in the sky and bits and pieces of sigur ros. I simply like beautiful and innovative music in general. I mean, if it is beautiful and moving to me in some way than i will listen to it. It realy doesn't matter to me what genre it comes from.  <br /> <br />  Anyways, for christmas i recieved a thirty dollar gift certificate to a music store in my area and i had heard alot about the band \\"gybe.\\" So i decided to give them a shot without ever hearing any of their music before. Usualy i like to hear songs from a band before i go out to buy their cd but their songs are so long and my computer is so slow that there was no way i could accomplish that. I had read some things from people on this site that this cd was one the saddest cd's ever made and that it was very \\"tragic\\" or \\"depressing.\\"well there are two types of music that i like; dark music and sad music-So i figured this cd was right for me.  <br /> <br />  The first six minutes of this album do not dissapoint. The spoken word part over the top of that swirling melody is truly a beautiful thing, but, after those six minutes are over, there arent many possitives left to talk about. This band has a great talent for creating very subtle, dark atmospheres. The problem though is that they rarely do anything dynamic with it. for example, using delay or vibrato, or whatever affect they use to achieve those silent, dark sounds, they create an atmosphere. But creating an atmosphere is worthless if you arent going to build on it or do something with it. So what happens is that atmosphere just becomes noise without any substance.  <br /> <br />  There are times when they do build up, but, even in those times the chords and the progressions that they use dont match up with the sound of the atmosphere that they created. Which goes back to my main point that most of that \\"subtle noise\\" that they waste so much time with is pointless, Making these songs way longer than they should be. When they do play louder the progressions that they choose to play are mostly bland and are not sad at all but they actualy have a country western kind of feel-almost like something you would hear in an old western movie.  <br /> <br />  There just isn't alot of substance in this album. Which is hard to swallow since the first six minutes are so moving-i almost question there musicianship, as if they hide behind all that quiet noise and when it realy comes down to play you find that they are nothing special. At least that is how i feel.
B00005JLFC|4.0|I went to see this film with my  then 14 year old daughter 21 years ago. We both loved it but she was so impressed she named <br />her own daughter Yentl. Naturally I would love to have the DVD.
B000667FN8|1.0|SP is the worst band on the face of the earth. they disgrace everything that former great bands tried to make. they disgrace the word punk and rock. if Sid Viscious were alive these people would be dead by now. they r helping in the downfall of rock which has been happening since the tragic death of Kurt Cobain..RIP. now the only band that is really good that is still around is Green Day.. but they stared in the 80s. I will admit i lisin to older (better) rock. like the Sex Pistols and Ramones who INVENTED punk, Metallica, AC/DC, Nirvana(my all time favorite), Queen and many others.  <br /> <br /> <br />Them and Good Charlette are the biggest butcherers of rock and r killing it(rock's downfall is partially rap/hip hops fault and also bands like this)  <br /> <br />All they do is complain and whine..WE DONT WANT TO HEAR THIS IF YOU HAVE EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS TALK TO UR MOTHER!! all these bands r complaining about how hard it is to be famous and u hav no privacy like GC in \\"I JUST WANNA LIVE\\" and Lindsy Lohans song called \\"RUMORS\\" or somethin. wen u become an entertainer u give up ur privacy. they should hav known that before they became famous. now the fans should back off and not bug them for autographs and stuff wen they r out wit their family and stuff   (look wut happened to Kurt Cobain since he couldnt take the fame). but wut else can u expect form people. these people should be ashamed of themselves!!! <br /> <br />PS.This whole thing goes for Good Charlette too. email me at headbanginbean87@yahoo.com GO LISTEN TO GOOD BANDS LIKE THE ONES LISTED ABOVE!!!
B0006SSOHC|5.0|I saw this movie at the theater and was VERY impressed with the storyline.  However, the cinamatography was not very well done but overall it's worth watching.  I am waiting for it to come out on DVD so I can get it for my mom who loves a good thriller film.
B000002J09|5.0|I am 17 years old, and probably one of the only kids of my generation to enjoy only 60-70's music, and from what i have listened to by Led Zeppelin and other bands, all that i have to say is that this album is one of the greatest all time albums if you readers did not even consider that yet. From classic staples such as Black Dog, Rock and Roll, and Going to California to the undoubtedly greatest song of all time, Stairway to Heaven. Also, how can anyone forget about Robert Plant's Vocals in Misty Mountain hop. Four Sticks, When the Levee Breaks, and Battle For Evermore are also songs that you can listen to over and over, and keep liking them better each time you hear it. This whole album shows that Led Zeppelin never lost its touch or its roots from its previous great albums. I have most of the led zeppelin albums, and i gotta say that this one tops them all. If you do not have this album, then get it or your record collection is not complete.
B0006B2A2E|1.0|People always get excited when something \\"different\\" comes out in theatres.  Anything that's \\"different\\" is always praised by the foolish movie going public.  Eternal Sunshine is one of the most overrated films I've ever seen.  Kate Winslet is also one of the most overrated actresses ever.  Why on earth was she nominated?  Actually, why has she been nominated FOUR TIMES for an Oscar?  Avoid this movie if you have self respect.
B000000WF0|4.0|When reviewing an album, it is easy to form your own, biased opinion, rather than look a little deeper. Rather than doing that I will review it by analysing 3 main features: <br /> <br />Lonetivity: This album was released 7 years ago, and it is still being played in my stereo as much now as it was then. The music seems to have grown on me, as at first, I never really liked this album aside from Bittersweet Symphony. - 5/5 <br /> <br />Originality - Alot of the music is not that original, and can be quite derivitave of 70s music. Bittersweet Symphony in partucular. - 2/5 <br /> <br />Creativity - As with the last point, the album isn't the most creative this I have heard. But it sounds good without the music being creative. - 3/5 <br /> <br />After that I give it a 4 star rating. And yes, this review was pretty bad, but it's still a review...
0441172717|5.0|I read Dune in high school and loved it then, and it was such a pleasure (more than a decade later) to pick it up again. <br /> <br />Dune is to Science Fiction what The Lord of the Rings is to Fantasy.  It almost defines the genre and you can see its influence in almost all Sci-Fi literature today. <br /> <br />What makes Dune especially exciting is how complex and thorough it is.  Dune is not a simple story, but then, neither is life.  You have so many characters and groups of characters all with different and opposing objectives.  You see how the decisions and actions of one can influence the course of so many other groups of people. <br /> <br />The characters are all so real, deep, and believable.  The plot is sensational.  Getting this bird's-eye view of the rise, the fall, and the rise of the Atreides family is a real thrill unmatched by very few other books. <br /> <br />Yes, this book is a must-read even for those who do not read the science fiction genre often. <br /> <br />On a side note, I was warned in high school about continuing the series as most people I talked to considered it dull and boring.  I'm in the middle of Book 4 right now and I attest that while the next two books are not as fast paced as this one they are still quite interesting with a fun and complex story line.
B000002JQ6|5.0|I'm not the \\"metalmaniac\\" I used to be anymore, somewhere along the road I \\"grew it off me\\" somehow, but every time I hear AC/DC I feel this strong urge to turn up the volume, and rock away!  <br /> <br />\\"Sin City\\" never becomes old, \\"Dirty Deeds...\\" still rough, \\"Back In Black\\" (need I say more??) -and so on and on... <br />  <br />Not a boring moment on this Live-release of one of the greatest Heavy Metal-performing bands ever. All there is to say is WOW!  <br /> <br />I'm getting the DVD, the show still brings out the youth in me!
B000065V41|1.0|This is a great movie, but a poor DVD, and here is why. 20% of this movie is missing--cut out by Disney. 10% is missing on the left, and 10% is missing on the right. It's called full screen and this title was originally released for movie theaters in Widescreen. The only widescreen version available is on Laser Disk. This title is not worth the one star I am forced to give it. Don't be fooled by all the 5 star ratings who watch all their movies on a TV set, the original movie is great, but this DVD release is bad.
B00068IOWC|5.0|I recently finished listening to all 11 U2 studio albums (I include Rattle & Hum, which is 1/2 studio), and Atomic Bomb now stikes me as the work of a mature and confident band that know's itself, knows its audience, and has something to say.  The album is not as daring as Zooropa or Discotheque or as commercial as Joshua Tree, but it is fun and stimulating.  Comparing Atomic Bomb to the prior albums led me to organize U2's entire output into the following loose categories: <br /> <br />(1) Irish Phase:  Boy (1980), October (1981), War (1983); <br />(2) American Phase:  Unforgettable Fire (1984), Joshua Tree    (1986), Rattle & Hum (1988) <br />(3) European Phase:  Achtung Baby (1991), Zooropa (1993), Discotheque (1997) <br />(4) Universal/Mature Phase:  All That You Can't Leave Behind (2000), How to Dismantle and Atomic Bomb (2004). <br /> <br />U2 has always played well on the radio, from I Will Follow (1980) to Beautiful Day (2000), and Vertigo (2004) is as strong and edgy a radio rocker as you can ask for.  U2 has always strived to put spirituality into their music, from Sunday Bloody Sunday (1983) to the spiritual degradation of Discotheque (1997), and Atomic Bomb is replete with perhaps more spiritual striving than any other U2 album.  They always appear authentic and not preachy in their faith, though Bono cannot help preaching on social issues (see Crumbs From Your Table on this album).  The love songs are not as tortured as Achtung Baby's, and the whole album is much more affirming in general.  Together with All That You Can't Leave Behind, Atomic Bomb seems to hearld a plateau of maturity that continues to strive and stretch and rock, but does so more with more reassurance and less angst. <br /> <br />One final point:  Looking back at the start of their recording career with Boy (1980) I was surprised just how mature and broad the band's vision was from the start.  They speak to real people in the real world, and they affirm spiritual answers, or at leastspiritual questing, to solve real problems, both personal and political.  The band has been through several phases exploring that vision, including some popular (Joshua Tree, Pride), some beyong the mainstream (Zooropa), and some downright dark and disturbing (Exit, Pop).  If you think that rock has nothing to do with the soul, then you probably don't like U2 in the first place.  But with this album U2 appears closest to speaking from the heart, song after song, and its fun, too.  You can't ask for much more from record.  <br />

B00005JNBQ|5.0|I saw this at the weekend and can honestly say it is the funniest film I have ever seen. All those idiots who say it doesn't have a plot are missing the entire point of the film. Watch this movie. I guarantee if you see this you will leave laughing.
B0002KVUKM|3.0|yes,the plots lameness is exceeded only by the miserable acting.but this isnt an acting driven movie.going into this,my expectation was either this will thrill me as did league of extraordinary gentlemen did or be the waterworld of the 2000's.here,where it lacked acting ability,it more than made up for with effects.as did LXG did.the plot,if you want to call it that is as far fetched as they get.but it had charactors that we all know and grew up with.dracula is after the frankenstien monster,it is crucial for some convoluted world conquering scheme.along the way the wolfman is also included in this monster mash.van helsing is the indiana jones of the church and his mission is to capture monsters.his initial battle with mr hyde was impressive.theres plenty of action and acting to laff your butt off to.the one annoyance i couldnt stomache was that beckensdale chick.she was the lamest tough chick ever.she would run up to the action only to get either slapped up or run away.chicks acting like bad-asses usually come off lame.karate chop,kick,head butt.yawn.the one exception of course being s weaver in aliens and that chick in the long kiss goodbye(a very underrated action flick).i would equate this aslo as a greatest hit complilation cd.the songs are no classics but they serve the purpose;dance,sing along to,whatever.i would recommend this with an asterics....THIS IS ALL ABOUT THE ACTION/CGIs.

B000002I2M|5.0|The Doors' \\"L.A. Woman\\" (1971) remains a classic recording with its emphasis on hard-driving rock and blues. \\"Love Her Madly\\" (the hit single), \\"Riders on the Storm\\" and the title track have been endlessly discussed, yet \\"The Changeling,\\" \\"Been Down So Long,\\" \\"Cars Hiss By My Window\\" and \\"Crawling King Snake\\" are definite highpoints in the Doors canon. Jim Morrison's voice may have been shot, but no one could have sung these songs better. Sadly, Morrison's death prevented the group from expanding their blues-oriented sound. Though the surviving band members recorded two albums without Morrison (now out-of-print), \\"L.A. Woman\\" represents the Doors' legitimate swansong.
B0006M4SO6|2.0|Let me start by saying that I'm an enormous fan of Pat Metheny and especially the Metheny Group. I've been following him since around 1978 and have basically everything he's put out and then some. I'll also tell you that I've been listening to this CD for about three weeks now, giving it repeated listens. My ultimate opinion is that this is a CD for Metheniacs only and even some of them may be lost with this one.  <br /> <br />The long format attests to be one coherent piece of music with various themes. I find two problems here. First off, I recognize one of the themes as being something that was performed by the Pat Metheny Group as a stand alone piece back in 1978. How can this song suddenly be part of a larger whole? My main complaint with the recording, however, is this; there's entirely too much repetition. I'm not talking about the kind of repetition you hear on say a movie soundtrack in which a theme comes back over and over, I'm talking about a not-so-interesting pattern being played over and over for 20 minutes or more.  <br /> <br />Metheny has talked for years about the analogy of using layers of sound the way a painter uses layers of paint. Well, this album is a lot like watching someone put layers upon layers upon layers on a canvas. Trouble is, it ultimately falls flat and the long form doesn't have a payoff. There is next to no build, even at the end of the 68 or so minutes of music. This is odd because Metheny is such a master at that kind of building; look at songs like The First Circle or Half Life of Absolution for example.  <br /> <br />Another thing that I don't find pleasing about the CD is that there are really no memorable melodies, which have always been an integral part of the Metheny Group sound. The album takes on an almost mechanical feeling as it goes on and on but never really goes anywhere.  <br /> <br />Pat added an accomplished harmonica player to this record but he is generally used to add only yet another layer repeating those patterns over and over. He gets only one solo section. Lyle's soloing abilities are also underused and he gets only one solo section. The human voice, which has been carrying so much lyricism and melody for the Group since 84's First Circle album is all but gone from this record.  <br /> <br />One group of people who might dig this record is guitar players. There are tons and tons of layered guitar parts. And the fretless bass makes a welcome appearance, albeit briefly. <br /> <br />If you've got to have everything he does, get it. If you don't already own everything else, I would get every other album he's made before this one with the exception of Zero Tolerance for Silence which is an entire album of, well, noise. <br />
B0006M4SO6|4.0|Reminiscent of Metheny's solo \\"Secret Story\\", \\"The Way Up\\" is expansive and cinematic and features a continuous, thematic format.  At the heart it all is their signature sound along with numerous layers of guitar, much more so than any of their recent recordings.  The band also welcomes a new member, swiss-born harmonica player, Gregoire Maret who's melodic swells blend seamlessly along with the electic layers of guitar provided by Pat Metheny. <br /> <br />Trumpeter Cuong Vu's presence is felt here more so than in \\"Speaking of Now\\" where he made is auspicious debut.  There is more of an assertive and confident manner to Vu's playing now that he's had time to gel with his bandmates.  The same goes for drummer Antonio Sanchez who's command of his instrument is more on display here with the overall, \\"loose\\" feel of the record.   <br /> <br />This record is worth the money.  The \\"Opening\\" and \\"Part One\\" launches into the stratosphere and ends in a satisfying blaze of glory. (Check out Pat's distorted lead guitar ala \\"Half-Life of Absolution\\")  \\"Part two\\" and \\"Part Three\\" settle into more of the \\"group\\" sound. <br /> <br />A defiinite kudos to PMG for injecting kinetic and evocative power missing from \\"Speaking of Now\\" and even \\"Imaginary Day\\".   But I must say I am missing the more melodic pieces of music present in \\"Letter from Home\\" and \\"Still Life, Talking\\".  I suppose one could surmise that a true artist rarely does redux and is on a constant musical journey.  It is now evident that the band's fans are now split into the nostalgic group yearning a little of the old magic, and the ones who admire their fanatical search for the highest truth in their music.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I thought this movie was great!  Where is it written that every movie needs a plot?  Napoleon Dynamite is just what the doctor ordered when you want to sit and watch something that you don't have to pay close attention to.  I look forward to seeing how Kip's wedding turns out. :>)
B00005JNBQ|1.0|I don't know what all you people see in this movie.  There's really no plot, just about some nerd.  It's not about anything.  The way he speaks gets really annoying after a while.  The only reason I got through the whole thing was because I was seeing it with someone and didn't wanna be rude by turning it off.  She didn't like it either...
B0006399FS|1.0|Talk about being lame. <br /> <br />U2,if they wanted, could be so much more than this terrible album. <br /> <br />Can't beleive it.
B0000024JA|4.0|First, let me start by saying how ingenious it was to spinoff albums from most of the members of the Wu-Tang Clan.  These brothers were'nt kidding at the end of the 36 Chambers about making cream.  This was unheard of in successful rap groups back in their time.  It used to be that members spawned their own albums because of beef w/in the crew (Ice Cube from N.W.A), or various creative differences (Dr. Dre and his producing, Busta Rhymes because his lyrical talent is far superior to the rest of the L.O.N.S, etc).  It was unfortunate that the Wu-Tang Clan reunion album wasn't up to par with the hip-hop listening population.  At least they set a record for the fastest descent in the pop charts. <br /> <br />The RZA tailors his production to the rap style of the artist, and this grimy, stark production suits Method Man.  Even Meth's raspy voice has various styles.  This most anticipated album release did not disappoint.  \\"Bring the Pain\\", \\"Release Yo' Delf\\" and \\"All I Need\\" are obvious classics which sounds as good today as it did over 10 years ago.  They will sound just as good 10 years from today.   <br /> <br />This album is great from first song to the second to last (Why did Meth remake Method Man?  What a mistake.).  Meth shows off various styles of rap from the sensitive (All I Need), to battle rap (Meth vs. Chef, I thought Chef won), to being part of the crew (Mr. Sandman).  This album really deserves 4 3/4 stars.  If it wasn't for that damn remix (they should have put the All I Need remix instead) this album would have received a 5 star rating from me. <br /> <br />The Wu-Tang Clan were true pioneers and were at the top of their game during their reign.  Meth's \\"Tical\\" was one of the many great examples of Wu's greatness.  This was a CD for the ages.
B00006M183|5.0|I don't know about you lot (and the guy beneath me), but I think Pearl Jams first two (most popular) albums are awful. <br /> <br />\\"Jeremy\\" \\"Alive\\" - ergh boring. Some of the biggest hits of that album.  <br />\\"Deep\\" \\"Once\\" and \\"Black\\" are the real great tracks on that album and the follow up Vs is just awful. <br /> <br />The thing thats great about this record is,  <br />it has character. <br /> <br />Eddie Vedder does'nt perfect his singing - it sounds good <br /> <br />The songs are'nt overproduced and polished up like a commercially sickening mainstream albums or single <br /> - it sounds good <br /> <br />So shut up and keep out an open ear for this album cause its their best, and comaparing albums is just pointless anyway.
B0006IUDXA|5.0|Beware, there is some reference to the Pilot Episode so if you want to watch that without knowing anything about it, please feel free to skip this review. <br /> <br />It has a Canadian Home Video Rating of PG and carries the warning that it is not recommended for young children and that it has a mature theme.  I, on the other hand, think that MacGyver should be shown to children at a very young age because it teaches people to exercise creativity when given severe constraints and to be calm even when adversity is giving you a death stare.  Also, MacGyver's moral messages are still casually contagious during Season 1, unlike the in-your-face-and-lungs The Truth commercials.  First of all, he hates guns worse than I hate how Paramount waited so long to release this (except in the Pilot Episode when his moral system wasn't completely intact yet and Pete Thornton was some other guy).  Second, his reaction to cigarettes in the Pilot Episode is golden.  The D.A.R.E. (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) program should look into getting the rights to show that clip to children because it would show them secondhand that firsthand smoking can be a source of great discomfort.   <br /> <br />I''m quite satisfied with the picture quality.  However, the visuals weren't remastered so the picture is noticeably grainy sometimes.  However, the 80's synthesizer beats that are prevalent throughout every episode sound exquisitely crisp and more than offset the picture quality. <br /> <br />This really is Patty and Selma's nondry dreams come true.  The plots are entertaining and the frequent use of explosives is sufficient enough to keep Vin Diesel living his life a quarter mile at a time. <br />
B000001EAQ|5.0|The only U2 album thats not so nice - no wonder not many people like it. <br /> <br />Very Cool album.  <br />If you don't have this your insane! So buy it!
B0006M4SO6|5.0|This is an awesome recording that runs in similar styles of \\"Secret Story\\" and \\"Imaginary Day\\" while including all the best parts of what the PMG has recorded in the past.  When I first heard about this recording a few months ago..and how it was one composition of 68 minute length..I was intrigued but hestitant that it would be difficult to pull off and maintain emotional excitement for that period of time.  But not to fear, just like compositions from the classical masters, Pat and Lyle have conjured up many images beneath a common theme that is not beaten to death over the course of the recording.  It is actually broken up into 4 seperate tracks with numerous transitions occurring in each of those tracks.  All I can say is this is another brillant PMG recording that continues to push what we can expect for the next PMG outting.   <br /> <br />I have no clue what some reviewers have written about this being some \\"off-the-wall\\" recording and that Pat needs to sober up.  What the ?#$%??  This is no different than what the PMG has produced in the past with the exception that it is a single composition.  I wonder if Pink Floyd would have gotten this response if they had not gone and named the individual tracks on Dark Side of the Moon.   <br /> <br />Enjoy-
B00003CXTG|4.0|I'll just say this and bring it to the table; Pearl Harbor ain't that bad.     Have you clicked that \\"No\\" button yet? Great, I'll continue.     Sure if you're a war buff you'll pick out inaccuracies, perhaps find it a tad offensive (Don't you love it in action films when a character is about to swear before being blown up to kingdom come? \\"Oh, son of a... *BOOOM*\\") and that whole love story might turn even the most forgiving viewer off. However, as a film buff, a VERY forgiving film buff, I've got to hand it to Michael Bay; he recreated a beautifully contructed romanticised view of the forties and the whole bombing sequence is impressive and compelling to watch. The big budget certainly shows in the film even if the script sacrificed a little intelligence, but this is a Bruckheimer production with Michael Bay in the helm; all you can ask of them is a hell of a ride and nice set designs. (Good soundtrack too.) Also, I'm not being sarcastic or anything, but even though this film is about a dead serious subject matter and set 60 years in the past, they still managed to figure out how to slip in product placement from Coca-Cola. Now THAT'S clever.     I've always had a feeling this film was critically panned because the critics didn't want another Titantic on their hands. I don't like Titantic because that story dosen't interest me; people get on a boat, boat hits an ice berg, boat sinks, everyone dies, the end. Pearl Harbor on the other hand does interest me, it's a pure escapist fantasy that reflects a certain time in history where America was jolted to join in fighting the \\"people's war\\". If you want to watch an anti-war film, watch Platoon. If you like war and want to pretend you're anti-war so you don't sound like a blood lusty nut, watch Saving Private Ryan. If you want to see a big budget homage to classic war films of the forties, give Pearl a whirl.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|i never listened to slipknot a whole lot and  then i heard \\"duality\\" n became interested. i picked up the album and was amazed that a band with 9 people can actually come together for a musical sound. its very had to do and they pulled it off. the acoustic tracks are very well written and enjoyable even to people who are into the fatser, harder slipknot. i think if you are into the \\"slipknot\\" scene get the album, if not, try something new. flippin right!

1592400876|2.0|The description of this little book supposedly about grammar and \\"zero tolerance approach to Punctuation\\" is misleading.  The title alone intrigued me, but that's as far as it goes.  I was married to a college English professor and my best subject in high school was English grammar.      She dedicates it \\"to the memory of the striking Bolshevik printers of St Petersburg who, in 1905, demanded to be paid the same rate for punctuation marks as for letters, and thereby directly prececipitated the first Russian Revolution.\\"  If you believe that, then this possibly is the book for you.    Robert MacNeil, on PBS, recently hosted a program about the \\"English\\" and dialects in American language.  He indicated that the way commoners speak in the Midlands in upper Middle Western section of the country is the preferred enunciaiton of words.  The Southern sound is generally easy to take, his poll showed, though many dialects prevail.  His show even explored black talk which is a language separate and apart from the general population.  The use of the work 'that' is an example.    This is a comedic, actually absurd, narrative of Ms. Truss and not grammar at all.  She has a phobia about the apostrophe and the semi-colon.  Didn't she learn anything in school?  What's her take on the word 'that' which I detest.  It's true she didn't try to Americanize any of the contents.    She explains the pandas on the cover (one with a paint brush, other has a gun) thusly:  \\"A panda walks into a cafe, orders a sandwich and eats it; then draws a gun and fires two shots in the air.  \\"Why?\\" asks the confused waiter, as the panda makes towards the exit.  The panda produces a badly punctuated wildlife manual and tosses it over his shoulder.  \\"I'm a panda,\\" he says, at the door.  \\"Look it up.\\"  The waiter turns to the relevant entry and, sure enough, finds an explanation:  Panda.  Large black-and-white bear-like mammal, native to China.  Eats, shoots, and leaves.\\"  This must be British humor, a la Benny Hill; it's supposed to be a joke, I guess.  But I am wondering why a panda is out on the loose eating in restaurants in the first place.  Only in Britain.    A local newspaper columnist does a weekly explanation of the use of obsolete words, and their preferred pronunciation.  His material comes from the Associated Press.  Whatever happened to the Harbrace Handbook?  I say, they obviously have never heard of it in England.

B000000H7I|5.0|If you are reading this, bay_area_thrasher, I hope you feel mortified. Because you bashed an excellent Technical Death Metal band and say that Immolation is better than this band. Have you not realized that Suffocation is one of the very first bands to create the brutal side of Technical Death Metal? And have you also not realized that this band is the most plagiarized band in Death Metal? Did you not know that Immolation and some other DM bands have attempted to copy Suffocation's sound? How could you even call yourself a \\"True\\" Death Metal fan when you bashed a DM band that is so talented in technical structure? I must say that you are a false and hypocritical DM fan who hates technicality in Metal music. To all the fans of Suffocation and some great DM, don't listen to bay_area_thrasher. He is a fatuous, false DM fan who hates technical skills in Metal music.    Now back to reviewing this album. This is the one album from Suffocation that invented all of the brutal side of Technical Death Metal. This is a very commendable effort from Suffocation. Their songs all have the skills and lyrics that make this band excellent. Drummer Mike Smith is unlike any other boring drummers from Metal music. His impressive array of broken double bass kicking and technical blastbeating are noticeably apparent in this album. Guitars are very bassy, sometimes they are difficult to discern by hearing but still makes it unique in a very good way. And vocalist Frank Mullen has good growling, though he is not one of the best vocalists. I highly recommend this album who love great Death Metal. Suffocation are one of the very few DM bands who possess impressive technical skills and songwriting.    bay_area_thrasher: I hope you will be put to shame for bashing a great Technical Death Metal band like Suffocation. Revoke those words of what you said to this band, you false and hypocritical DM \\"fan.\\"    Long live Suffocation and excellent Death Metal! \M/\M/
B000002TQV|1.0|This album is ok. But it is is sooooo far from their pop *creep roots. the main problem that i have with this album is with thom yorke. why would he try to copy a genius like gary barlow? give me a break. this guy is helpless and clueless, and the people who buy this album have the same size of a brain this guy has. nd I'm not joking. there's like 1 good song on it, the rest are trash. he sounds like a pre-teen girl when he sings and his songs suck. throw this in the garbage. this is certainly one of the worst albums ever made in recording history.this guy can neither sing or dance. His voice sounds like a little wisp, sort of like a short breezes that dies after it hits a big tree. If you ask me, Gary would sound much better singing these lyrics. Overall the songs and the production are not bad, almost any other male singer could make these songs decent. His voice is high pitched and doesn't work well with guitar contemporary music. His is best suited to well-crafted Dance-Pop music. I strongly suggest you listen to samples from the CD, as to avoid dissappointment. With this cd in print, I started to shiver, my palms started to sweat, and my ears swelled in torture. Arrest the man who gave this band a record deal. It is a crime against humanity. <br />
1594200106|3.0|This book starts out with an engaging premise and an appealing narrator, a ten year-old boy.  The author's prose is lyrical, and so much admired by this wordsmith that I was certain I was going to love the book to the end.  Unfortunately, I was soon disappointed.<br /><br />I found the plot unnecessarily convoluted and involved too many characters.  Each time I picked up the novel and turned to my bookmarked page, I had to re-read the previous half a dozen pages to put myself back into the scene and remind myself of the who's whos. If an avid reader has to do that, there is something wrong with the writing. As the novel progressed, the plot became so blatantly melodramatic and predictable that my frustrations mounted. By the end, I just wanted to get through to the final page so that I could open my next novel.<br /><br />For me, the battered, homeless hero remains an unforgettable character, and perhaps the book is worth reading for that image alone.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|In the throes of a depression that Avril followed up her blockingbusting album with this result which is a bleak testament to melancholy and alienation that has a haunting and pristine beauty. What makes it so silly is that album is very raw  There's as much raw emotion here as on any singer-songwriter album, but you have to go looking for it. Nothing about this album is easy or straightforward. But that's why it's worth listening to again and again until it all clicks.  Although the album was recorded in quite a short, it features a polished and rehearsed sound, as if Avril had been working on these selections for years to settle on just the right vocal and instrumental combinations.  Reading the lyrics on the page is a bit like reading impressionist poetry, and listening to them in Levignes edge-of-death whisper hardly clarifies the picture much. A few of the songs still have me wondering if there's any meaning to them, but they're nothing if not thought-provoking. Since I have bought 'Under my Skin' i have listened to it compulsively feeling compelled to try and grasp the fleeting music before it fades away to silence, for this, at times, the music of quiet. Perhaps it is the vocals, often a hoarse whisper that cannot compete even with the solo acoustic guitar, or perhaps the hollow wisdom of youth trying to lament honestly life's shortcomings. There are moments of unfathomable insight and heartbreak encapsulated here.   This album shocked me to the core of my existence, and as a result my nurse has had to start doubling my medication for sleeping. It is an album with much to say but ultimately means nothing. i Think it's about time to Avril either started to put up or shut up. Someone better start laying down some smacks in her next album or we could have a new Britney Spears here. She should try and refocus her attention and join a new band which play to her 'girlie girl' strengths like the cheeky girls

B0001XAPX8|4.0|Two lonely people come together, Coleman Silk (Anthony Hopkins), a professor who quits his job after a supposed racial slur and Faunia Farley (Nicole Kidman), an eccentric younger woman disabused by the harsh realities of her life. A former welterweight boxer who has turned his back on his race, Silk lives as a white man caught in an ironic twist of fate. In a fine blend of racism and religious intolerance before the gratuity of political correctness, the young Coleman makes irreversible decisions that critically affect his later years. As a deeply melancholic mature man, Coleman finds sudden happiness with Faunia in spite of her personal despondency and refusal to believe in joy.<br /><br />Moody and dark, played out against countryside covered with snow, the fine-tuned cinematography catches every nuance of shadow and flesh, as the movie evolves into an agonizing collision of desire vs. reality. Acting out the role of Achilles, pitted against fate and the grim determination of the gods, Silk refuses to give up the younger woman, no matter the consequences.<br /><br />The film is carefully balanced, shifting from present to past, exposing the painful histories of the characters, the roots of their flaws. The supporting roles are beautifully played by Gary Sinise as Nathan Zukerman, a reclusive writer and friend of Silk's and Ed Harris as Lester Farley, an ex-Vietnam vet unable to purge the violence from his life. In the end, seeking an island of comfort, Silk and Faunia gravitate to one another, sensing at least a temporary respite from an often cruel world. \\"The things that restore you can destroy you.\\" Luan Gaines/ 2005.

B0007TKNII|4.0|THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is a fairly close film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's famous musical by the same name. The movie opens in a black and white, reminiscent of an old movie newsreel. It's 1919 and the Paris Opera House is dilapidated. Items from opera poster to music boxes to the famed chandelier are being auctioned off. As the chandelier rises for the bidders to see, the theatre is restored to its magnificent and colorful glory and the audience is transported in time to 1871. The story goes something like this. A young orphaned girl, Christine Daae (Emmy Rossum), is raised in the opera house. In her dreams she is taught music lesson by what she believes is the Angel of Music that her dying father promised he would send to her. In reality, her teacher is the Opera's infamous Phantom, a man seldom seen but whose presence is always felt and known. The Phantom (Gerard Butler) has been tutoring Christine not only so that she can one day become the opera's star, but also so that she will one day become his wife. The Phantom has a physical deformity that (in this version) that has horribly scarred half his face. Things start off well and Christine finally gets her big moment to shine. But then her old boyfriend shows up and things escalate from there. The Phantom is torn by rage and the two-faced nature of his soul, represented by his disfigured face, causes lots of havoc. But things have a mostly happy ending.<br /><br />The movie follows the plot of the musical it's based on fairly well. There are some minor changes in plot done for more dramatic effect, but overall the story structure is the same. The costumes and set design of the film are magnificent and the acting is superb. Rossum looks like Christine and she sings well. Actually, most of the singing in the movie is good.<br /><br />However, there are a few things that I felt distracted from the overall flow of the film. Gerard Butler is a great actor and has a nice voice. However, his voice just isn't right for The Phantom. At times I think it sounds too high and other times it sounds too low. It's not that he doesn't sing well, because he does. However, his vocal talents just weren't adapted well to capture the physical passion and spiritual torture that embodies every syllable The Phantom speaks (or in this case, sings). Also, Butler looks almost the same age as Rossum. The Phantom is someone twice Christine's age and in the movie he looks like a big brother instead of the elder tutor and father-figure he's supposed to be.<br /><br />Also, only part of the Phantom's face is disfigured. Actually, it's about 1/4th of his face. For the duality approach that the film seems to be going for it would have been nice to see at least a full 1/2 of his face scarred. However, what the filmmakers did does fit because in the end the Phantom does the right thing. It's just that through most of the film there's this whole two-faced, dual nature motif going on and the face is a huge part of that. I think if exactly 1/2 his face was scarred it would have made The Phantom's final act even more poignant.<br /><br />In the movie, most of the singing between Christine and Raoul has been reduced to dialogue. I'm not sure about the reasoning behind this. Patrick Wilson (Raoul) seemed to be a decent enough singer and should have been able to handle the vocal challenges. Perhaps it was done to appeal to a wider audience. Who knows?<br /><br />Finally, there is the Masquerade scene. The attendees are mostly dressed in black and white costumes with the occasional dash of gold. The Phantom makes his appearance in a Masque of the Red Death costume, but other than that there isn't much color. Masquerades are usually colorful and it would have been nice to see some of that color during that scene.<br /><br />There are several allusions in the movie to other Webber works and to the original PHANTOM OF THE OPERA novel by Gaston Leroux. For instance, the horse that the Phantom places Christine onis an allusion to a scene in the novel that is almost identical and when the theatre owners are told to &#34;grovel, grovel&#34; the music and lyrics are almost identical to a piece in JOSEPH AND THE AMAZING TECHNICOLOR DREAMCOAT (another Webber musical).<br /><br />Overall, PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is a delight to watch. Joel Schumacher often messes things up when he directs, but for once he got things right and made a film that though full of excess, is also beautiful and meaningful.is an allusion to a scene in the novel that is almost identical and when the theatre owners are told to &#34;grovel, grovel&#34; the music and lyrics are almost identical to a piece in JOSEPH AND THE AMAZING TECHNICOLOR DREAMCOAT (another Webber musical).<br /><br />Overall, PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is a delight to watch.

B000000JO3|5.0|I pretty much wrote this review to knock that fool kid who gave this album one star and had the audacity to reccomend \\"older Thrice albums\\" because they have \\"skill\\" and \\"enegery\\", which according to him minor threat lacks...yeah to knock him off of the main page. Well, simply put this discography is essential to any study of the roots of hardcore. And maybe the key to the importance of this band, for me, is the message. I was never SxE or anything, but album made me think about issues that I related to in Mr. Mckaye's lyrics. He was pist off, and the music matched his intensity and biting wit. This band had a skill that is basically non-existant in today's nu-emo/metal/hardcore, and that was excellent, simplistic, and congruent song writing.
0385510454|3.0|Like many others, I've been somewhat disappointed with JG's recent efforts (Painted House and Last Juror excepted). The Broker is better than most of his other recent books. Not the most inventive plot, but I found the characters interesting and the story engaging. My only real complaint is that the book has WAY too much Italian. In the parts of the book set in Italy, virtually every line of dialogue is stated in both Italian and English. It got pretty tiresome and added nothing to the story. I get it - Joel/Marco is trying to learn to speak Italian, but that could've been established in a better way. I think JG went overboard with the translations. If all of the English to Italian and Italian to English translations were taken out, this wouldn't be much more than a short story. Still, for a bit of light \\"brain candy\\" reading, you could do a lot worse than The Broker.

B00009V7T2|5.0|Very few albums in our time have the quality to be called instant classics, especially in hard rock.  From Linkin Park to the Used and back to Velvet Revolver, it's all pretty much cut and paste songwriting.  However, this album's original sound, incredible musicianship, complete with bewildering lyrics sung by a haunting voice and jam-oriented psychadelic interludes does not at all hinder its ability to contain catchy songs that are pleasing to the ear.  On top of all that, it's a concept album which is something else that's rarely pulled off very well these days. That being said, it's no wonder that they're on the lineup for Bonnaroo 2005. <br /> <br />Son Et Lumiere (4/5)- Cool intro song to build up to the first full track <br />Inertiatic Esp (5/5)- Holy sheit can he hit those high notes anbd write some insane lyrics. Everyone thinks the same thing when they first hear this song: \\"He sounds like a girl.\\" I did too, but he doesn't sound like a girl as much as Coheed and Cambria's singer which a previous reviewer of this album recommended in place of this band. <br />Roulette Dares (5/5)- Damn, that drummer is insane on this track!  Excellent song with great ups and downs, it was unbelievable to watch them play it live.  The end bleeds right into Tira Me a Las Aranas. <br />Tira Me a Las Aranas (3/5)- Nothing great, just a latin-sounding guitar intro to the next song <br />Drunkship of Lanterns (4/5)- This song is nuts with a great breakdown part that's used a few times.  Cool lyrics as well. <br />Eriatarka (5/5)- One of the best songs on the album with some of  the most complex drumming in a chorus I've ever heard. <br />Cicatriz Esp (5/5)- The standout track on the CD. If you don't like this song, you don't like Mars Volta.  John Frusciante from Red Hot Chili Peppers plays guitar on this track and I think a few others.  Btw, Flea plays bass on the entire album. <br />This Apparatus Must be Unearthed (5/5)- Another great song full of crazy voice effects.  The ending is a digitally reversed drum solo <br />Televators (5/5)- The only song on the album that's fully soft and also the only one that has a feature video (I don't count the Inertiatic Esp video because it doesn't go with the song at all).  Beautiful song. <br />Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt (5/5)- A marvelous finale to an out-of-this-world CD. <br /> <br />Much of the credit from this album belongs to producer Rick Rubin who is one of the masters of honing in on a band's vibe and expanding it to the fullest.  In this case, he brought out the best of Mars Volta's latin style and transformed it into a unique feel that's just as ingenious as it is marketable.  If you have an open mind when it comes to music and can stand to listen to high-pitched singing and an average of five minutes worth of instrumentals per song, buy this CD and you will see the brilliance of this experimental group that has changed the rules altogether.  Their new album comes out in March
B000003N7R|5.0|Jazz's greatest tenor (apologies to Coleman Hawkins) and it's greatest composer team up in a memorable small group meeting.  The versions of In A Sentimental Mood and Billy Strayhorn's My Little Brown Book are definitive.  Coltrane has never sounded more beautiful.  Ellingtons wonderful compositions, all but two are by Ellington, push John to play in a oftimes tender, melodic way unlike what he was normally playing in 1962.  Not that there isn't some passionate playing, especially on Take the Coltrane and the wonderful The Feeling of Jazz, its just that Ellington brings something lyrical out in Coltrane.  This album brings tears to my eyes, makes me laugh and is swinging from beginning to end.  Its a marvelous meeting of two very different musicians one nearing the end of his career, the other heading for the stratosphere and the chemistry between these two very different men is great.  Just beautiful.
6302468027|5.0|This is one of the funniest and most poignant movies out there.  Jessica Tandy was a treasure and Kathy Bates was so funny in a role that I certainly could identify with.  I do want to correct some misinformation in a post two down from me!  Fannie Flagg IS the author of the book on which the movie is based...but she is not Patricia Neal, the actress who starred in HUD.  Patricia Neal was Fannie's given name but when she went into acting, the name was obviously taken, so her father told her to make up a memorable name.  Fannie Flagg is nothing if not memorable.  She is a very funny lady...and an excellent author.  The movie is worth seeing over again.
B000002KET|5.0|I wanted the heaviest thing I could get my thirteen year old hands on and Black Sabbath were it.  At the time this was their newest album and unknown to me their most experimental and produced album.  Sabbath were getting a little more ambitious:  they added strings to some of the songs and synth courtesy of Rick Wakeman, and by doing so created one of their best albums.  It holds up today as it did back in 1973.  The riffs are killer, the songs are moving, the arrangements are complex yet still crunching.  Its a masterpiece.  I even like the aptly titled acoustic song Fluff because it adds some contrast with the rest of the material.
B0006IIPIK|4.0|Let me start off by saying that \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" is not a movie for everyone. If you're looking for a tightly knit story with intriguing plot twists, or deep and interesting character studies, you won't find those in here. But what if I told you that the film falls short on those elements on purpose, because director Kerry Conran's vision is a highly stylized film that devotes itself to the aesthetics, and makes everything else secondary. <br /> <br />The plot is intentionally filled with clichs of vintage cinema. We begin by the mysterious disappearances of scientists, with a city newspaper reporter (Gweneth Paltrow) chasing the story. Soon giant robots are marching through the streets of New York. And who does the world call to its salvation?---A lone pilot in a WWII-style fighter jet named Sky Captain (Jude Law). The pilot and the reporter, who happens to be ex-lovers, soon pair up to unravel the evil plans of a mad scientist, whom we eventually learn is in the process of deploying something called the \\"doomsday device\\". <br /> <br />The art direction of this film recalls aesthetics of an era that is long past. Being my age it's not easy for me to relate to a lot of the artistic references being made to a world reminiscent of the 40's and 50's. But being somewhat appreciative of older things, I can say everything in the film invokes imageries of a \\"film noir\\", and the artistic composition of a WWII propaganda poster. The fact that this is a movie about a vintage world made mostly with CGI is a clever joke that Conran seems to enjoy playing on his audience throughout the movie. He amuses himself with plenty of tongue-in-cheek references, such as a screening of \\"Wizard of OZ\\" at the beginning of the movie, foreshadowing a later scene where the characters encounter an ominous hologram projection of the villain in front of the gate to his lair. <br /> <br />Despite the characters being mere supporting acts in this movie, I thought the cast does bring a nice touch in a story that is otherwise a tribute to symbolisms of an older era. First of all it must be awkward to act in environments that are pretty much added on later but are nearly non-existent at the time of filming, but they manage to make it look convincing. Jude Law as Sky Captain and Gweneth Paltrow as Polly Perkins have good on-screen chemistry. Their romantic tug-of-war and playful bickering are welcome distractions when the film's nostalgic imageries become a bit repetitive at times. Angelina Jolie as Frankie Cook, commander of the British Air Force, has a very pretentious accent, but looks ravishing in a Nazi-like tight-fitted pilot uniform, with an eye patch no less. <br /> <br />A film like \\"Sky Captain\\" succeeds in what it does because it makes no pretense that it's purely about the aesthetics here, and to that end it's a marvel in its execution. Everything's done in meticulous detail. The pace of the film is very fast and tight, so tight that it seems at times almost unsentimental. It's also a film that's so unique it seems almost out of its time and place. And for that, I applaud it.
B0006B2A2E|2.0|Has any film in the last I don't know how many years been more over-rated than ESOTSM.  I think not.  Honestly, I was  disappointed I didn't enjoy this film because my expectations were very high.  Maybe too high.  I LOVED Being John Malkovich and for the most part LOVED Adaptation; both Charlie Kaufman screenplays.  So why didn't I love this?  I thought the idea behind the film was very good and the cast excellent.  Though I can think of several other actors who could probably have given the character of Joel a little more depth than Jim Carrey.  Sorry.  I hate to dump on the guy but he doesn't have much range, as far as I'm concerned.  Anyway, if you're to buy this film and its premise then you need to believe in the relationship at its heart between Joel & Clementine.  And I just didn't.  Carrey played the role with a perpetual \\"sad sack\\" expression on his face and Winslet came across as more annoying than anything else.  What exactly attracted these two to each other?  I didn't see it.  And I didn't find either character particularly likeable.  I usually like Winslet in just about anything.  Even her famous peeing scene in Holy Smoke.  LOL!!!  Anyway, another problem was Gondry's direction.  To me, he kept us far removed from any emotional attachment to his characters.  And the eccentric editing & cutting didn't help at all.  And don't get me started on the annoying background music that accompanied certain scenes.  I can't really say there was anything about the film I liked except for the cast & idea, adding up to 2 stars.  And I think that's being generous.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|This album is a masterpiece by a true master. I have been a fan since the late 70's and have followed the progression of this group's ever evolving sound. What they have accomplished here is amazing and unsurpassed. I can't wait to hear this in concert. I hope they play it from start to finish in it's entirety. It is one of the few Metheny albums that my wife and I actually danced to...so deep and soulful are the grooves. No elevator music here. Just the exciting, incredible and highly creative sounds of a genius. Please produce another one of these \\"full-length\\" gems Pat! Congratulations.
B00018D3JQ|3.0|The general idea - let's take songs of some specific genre (hard rock, reggae, punk, disco) and redo them in absolutely different way (remember Pat Boone singing metal?) - was used so many times that it is not funny anymore. Still this rates as a rather enjoyable attempt although I can understand old punksters and new-wavers having heartattacks at the sacrilege. Put it on as a background and don't take it too seriously, then you'll get some kicks out of it. \\"Guns of Brixton\\" is pretty cool, \\"Marian\\" and \\"Love Will Tear Us Part\\" are very listenable. I could give this a 2 stars rating but I must confess that I liked the overall ambience so here...
B000002H33|5.0|possibly one of the best albums ever, period.  'nuff said
B000099T2L|2.0|If you heard the excellent singles and thought the album might provide some more, stop. After two stunning tracks 'Crazy in Love' and 'Naughty Girl', the album lurches through some forgettable collaborations and slushy, sentimental ballads. There is little to look forward to when the bits you already know are removed. 'Bonnie and Clyde 03', another single, is welcome partly because it heralds the end and a quick change of pace that helps forget the middle tracks.  <br /> <br />Perhaps it's naive to expect tracks like 'Crazy in Love' to fill the album, but it quickly steps down a gear and seems to stop trying. I'm glad I own the tracks that persuaded me to buy the album but would probably not buy it in hindsight. No danger of loving the rest.

1592400876|2.0|Several editors are what this oeuvre needs.  Editor Number One would lop off the run-on, overly preachy epistle comprising both the ten page preface and thirty-four page introduction.  I'd suggest scuttling perhaps another two dozen pages from the closing chapter: it is a continuation of the repetitive sermon.  Lynne Truss is worried that text messaging, Virginia Woolf, and the local green grocer each threaten to annihilate punctuation standards of twentieth century English.  She is a self-described fuss about proper punctuation. She would arm us all with whiteout and magic markers, and set us upon the too-easily-found advertisements, road signs and government forms that are riddled with errors.  A comma-less \\"Slow Children Crossing,\\" aggravates her to no end.  Fair enough, but many of these examples are of a similarly low-hanging fruit variety.<br /><br />Editor Number Two would insist on clearer distinctions between British and American standards.  Too often the Yankee reader is left befuddled as to precisely how to employ the mighty comma, or the bracket (that's a parenthesis!) at sentence-end; or whether to trust The New Yorker, Strunk and White, or Lynne Truss.  Her many British colloquialisms overpower the American reader: just when her text is bouncing along merrily in a Monty Pythonish silly-British manner, we're inundated by yet another avalanche of obscurities from the tiny island nation and need to come up for air.  Also helpful would be chapter summaries or definitive lists  regarding the rules. Ms. Truss takes great pains to educate on the deteriorating state of punctuation; disappointingly, EATS, SHOOTS & LEAVES is a poor guidebook.  Another editorial remedy: request that Ms. Truss include her suggestions for recommended resources and further reading.<br /><br />Editor Number Three would insist on more anecdotal sidebars, and famous quotes.  This is where ES&L is at its best.  In her all-too-long fret about the Internet's detrimental effect on written language, she references a gem from long before the Web. A worried Truman Capote commenting on beat author Jack Kerouac's work: \\"That's not writing, it's typing.\\"  Similarly, she borrows a terrific passage from P.G. Wodehouse's 'Over Seventy' that chroncicles a fictitious author giving dictation to a bored secretary, providing us with the biggest howl of the book.<br /><br />These mirthful snippets surface too infrequently - the book is generally tedious and repetitive.

B0000CD5FN|5.0|If, due to high expectations because of all the great reviews,  you're not absolutely enthralled with this gem of a CD the first time you hear it...give it a little time to grow on you...you'll soon realize that your high expectations were right on the money.  The song Joe wrote for Johnny Cash (Long Shadow) sounds very Dylan-inspired...could have been on Blood on the Tracks.  This is one of those rare CDs that you don't have to program.  There are no bad tracks. I must also add that, of all the Mescalero  CDs, this one is by far the best.
B0002O7Y8A|4.0|...to be honest, prospective purchasers would be better served by purchasing a copy of the novel and the DVD separately. The book included with the set is very cheaply printed, is often difficult to read because of poor typesetting (facsimile of the original printing?), and doesn't even include a copyright. My suggestion is to find a good-quality paperback (Everyman's is probably fine and is certain to be priced right) that includes critiques, some annotation, and all the other goodies included with contemporary printings of literary classics. There's a reason why Jane Austen has been in print for 200 years, and it's not due to her being a \\"dead white chick.\\" First-time readers are to be envied.  Austen translates very well to the screen, and this film joins a group of other very enjoyable screen adaptations of her works. The only extras on this disk are a trailer, two commentaries (both fun and informative), and a few deleted scenes that really would've served no purpose other than disturbing the pace of the film. There are a number of subtitle options, including various Asian languages (perhaps a concession to Ang Lee fans). The print is nice and sharp, and is widescreen but not--unfortunately--anamorphic, the sound is clear, and the soundtrack is beautiful and sparingly utilized.  The movie itself is a joy, and I'm delighted that something of this quality is actually produced these days. It's very true to the spirit, if not the exact letter, of the novel, and contains not one expletive or hint of innuendo (except of manners). Ms. Thompson and Mr. Lee manage to treat us to a consistently engaging slice of Regency life that reminds us that the reason why classics are still read is that they're relevant, ultimately, to the human experience in general. Virtually anyone, regardless of background, can relate to these characters and their situations.  Ignore quibblers who complain that Thompson is too old for the part; these are the same types who'd complain that Mary Martin was too old to play Maria in The Sound of Music. My advice is to always judge a performance, ultimately, as the sum of its parts, which often really is greater than scrutiny of its individual components would indicate. This film is a winner any way you add it up, and is definitely worth owning.

0393035158|5.0|Ending Faith <br />by <br />Robert Guy Barrows <br /> <br />Copyright © 2005 Robert Guy Barrows <br />All rights reserved. <br /> <br />January 23, 2005 <br /> <br /> Sam Harris, a bright, well-educated young man, has written and published a book with the provocative title \\"The End of Faith.\\" <br /> He has debated on radio and television with many religious people and others who are either inspired or outraged by his book. <br /> The theme of his book is simple:  Harris believes that faith-based religions are endangering the human species by putting them on the slippery path to nuclear war. <br /> Whoa!  Quite a premise!   <br /> Faith-based religions?  Meaning?  Yes:  Judaism, Islam, and -- are you ready for this? -- Christianity -- all of the three major world religions! <br /> He holds Islam especially responsible because of its inherent theme of violence, urging its followers to \\"kill the infidels.\\" <br /> Harris argues his premise clearly in the following five paragraphs. <br /> Our situation is this:  most of the people in this world believe that the Creator of the universe has written a book.  We have the misfortune of having many such books on hand, each making an exclusive claim as to its infallibility.  People tend to organize themselves into factions according to which of these incompatible claims they accept -- rather than on the basis of language, skin color, location of birth, or any other criterion of tribalism.  Each of these texts urges its readers to adopt a variety of beliefs and practices, some of which are benign, many of which are not.  All are in perverse agreement on one point of fundamental importance, however:  \\"respect\\" for other faiths, or for the views of unbelievers, is not an attitude that God endorses.  While all faiths have been touched, here and there, by the spirit of ecumenicalism, the central tenet of every religious tradition is that all others are mere repositories of error or, at best, dangerously incomplete.  Intolerance isthus intrinsic to every creed.  Once a person believes -- really believes -- that certain ideas can lead to eternal happiness, or to its antithesis, he cannot tolerate the possibility that people he loves might be led astray by the blandishments of unbelievers.  Certainty about the next life is simply incompatible with tolerance in this one. <br /> Observations of this sort pose an immediate problem for us, however, because criticizing a person's faith is currently taboo in every corner of our culture.  On this subject, liberals and conservatives have reached a rare consensus:  religious beliefs are simply beyond the scope of rational discourse.  Criticizing a person's ideas about God and the afterlife is thought to be impolitic in a way that criticizing his ideas about physics or history is not.  And so it is that when a Muslim suicide bomber obliterates himself along with a score of innocents on a Jerusalem street, the role that faith played in his actions is invariably discounted.  His motives must have been political, economic, or entirely personal.  Without faith, desperate people would still do terrible things.  Faith itself is always, and everywhere, exonerated. <br /> But technology has a way of creating fresh moral imperatives.  Our technical advances in the art of war have finally rendered our religious differences -- and hence our religious beliefs -- antithetical to our survival.  We can no longer ignore the fact that billions of our neighbors believe in the metaphysics of martyrdom, or in the literal truth of the book of Revelation, or any of the other fantastical notions that have lurked in the minds of the faithful for millennia -- because our neighbors are now armed with chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons.  There is no doubt that these developments mark the terminal phase of our credulity.  Words like \\"God\\" and \\"Allah\\" must go the way of \\"Apollo\\" and \\"Baal,\\" or they will unmake our world. <br /> A few minutes spent wandering the graveyard of bad ideas suggests that such conceptual revolutions are possible.  Consider the case of alchemy:  it fascinated human beings for over a thousand years, and yet anyone who seriously claims to be a practicing alchemist today will have disqualified himself for most positions of responsibility in our society.  Faith-based religion must suffer the same slide into obsolescence. <br /> What is the alternative to religion as we know it?  As it turns out, this is the wrong question to ask.  Chemistry was not an \\"alternative\\" to alchemy; it was a wholesale exchange of ignorance at its most rococo for genuine knowledge.  We will find that, as with alchemy, to speak of \\"alternatives\\" to religious faith is to miss the point. <br /> In the above five paragraphs Harris sums up his thesis in \\"The End of Faith.\\"  He believes and argues persuasively that unless we give up our childish faith in the myths and superstitions of all faith-based religions, we will almost certainly blow each other up in the inevitable world-wide wars that loom before us all in the near future. <br /> Superstition and faith, Harris says, are beliefs without any provable evidence.  All three of the major faith-based world religions are living examples of such fantasy. <br /> With this damning premise which no reasonable person in any of the three major religions can deny, he then continues to lay out his case for ending faith in seven well-written chapters with a brief and sobering epilogue. <br /> The entire book is documented with footnotes and a 30-page bibliography listing about 600 books related to the premise Harris has laid out for the world. <br /> For this is a world-shaking book.  If it does nothing else than provoke discussion and conversation, as Harris puts it, \\"The End of Faith\\" may change the course of history. <br /> No small job, to end faith and thereby end all war! <br /> \\"The End of Faith\\" is not an eye-glazing academic treatise for scholars.  Harris writes easily and conversationally.  Andhe writes eye-stopping quotes! <br /> Such as:  \\"This world is simply ablaze with bad ideas.\\" <br /> Or:  \\"If religious war is ever to become unthinkable for us, in the way that slavery and cannibalism seem poised to, it will be a matter of our having dispensed with the dogma of faith.\\" <br /> And:  \\"People who harbor strong convictions without evidence belong at the margins of our societies, not in our halls of power.\\" <br /> As an example of faith-based convictions in the halls of power, Harris writes: <br /> \\"The House majority leader, Tom Delay, is given to profundities like 'Only Christianity offers a way to live in response to the realities that we find in the world.  Only Christianity.'  He [Delay] claims to have gone into politics 'to promote a Biblical worldview.'  Apparently feeling that it is impossible to say anything stupid while in the service of this worldview, he [Delay] attributed the shootings at the Columbine High School in Colorado to the fact that our schools teach the theory of evolution.' \\" <br /> Clearly, Harris is not afraid of stirring up a controversy among the Red State voters, and especially Christian conservatives everywhere. <br /> In the same chapter, titled \\"West of Eden,\\" Harris takes on Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, whom he quotes at some length, \\"because [Scalia's] remarks reveal just how close we are to living in a theocracy: <br /> \\"This is not Old Testament, I [Scalia] emphasize, but St. Paul...  [T]he core of his message is that government -- however you want to limit that concept -- derives its moral authority from God...  Indeed, it seems to me that the more Christian a country is the less likely it is to regard the death penalty as immoral... I attribute that to the fact that, for the believing Christian, death is no big deal.  Intentionally killing an innocent person is a big deal:  it is a grave sin, which causes one to lose his soul.  But losing this life, in exchange for the next? ...  For the nonbeliever, on the other hand, to deprive a man of his life is to end his existence.  What a horrible act! ... <br /> \\"The reaction of people of faith to this tendency of democracy to obscure the divine authority behind government should not be resignation to it, but the resolution to combat it as effectively as possible.  We have done that in this country (and continental Europe has not) by preserving in our public life many visible reminders that -- in the words of a Supreme Court opinion from the 1940s -- 'we are a religious people whose institutions pre-suppose a Supreme Being.'...  All this, as I [Scalia] say, is most un-European, and helps explain why our people are more inclined to understand, as St. Paul did, that government carries the sword as 'the minister of God' to 'execute wrath upon the evildoer.' \\" <br /> Scalia's views, as stated above, come from published writings by Scalia and dissents to Supreme Court decisions, which are cited in the footnotes. <br /> Harris has a clear, easy-to-read web site at [...] where many reviews of \\"The End of Faith\\" can be read. <br /> Also on that site are reader forums where people on the internet can express their views and debate with each other about the book. <br /> Harris ends his book with these lines: <br /> \\"The days of our religious identities are clearly numbered.  Whether the days of civilization itself are numbered would seem to depend, rather too much, on how soon we realize this.\\" <br /> People of faith may discover in \\"The End of Faith\\" a new reason for believing in evolution, rather than trying to forbid its being taught in our schools -- by realizing that our minds must evolve before we can truly love one another. <br />* * * <br /> \\"The End of Faith\\"  Sub-title:  \\"Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason\\" by Sam Harris, W.W.

B00009V7P8|1.0|I can't believe so many people like this album.  Seriously, it doesn't explore anything interesting, it wonders through some poor man's day-dreams.  I have a tendency to question the sobriety of those claiming how great it is.  Otherwise, have fun with it if you're an angst-filled teenager, locked in your room, crying in self pity.
B00005Q4CS|2.0|I wanted to like this film. the trailer made it look good, and I thought \\"Pi\\" was at least worth a look. but this movie about bored me to tears. <br /> <br />ok, ok I get it. drugs are bad. with some \\"cool\\" & \\"dark\\" music-video type imagery & a pretty girl. and drugs are bad. gee, uh, thanks.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000025RI|5.0|I never heard an album where I love most of it. This record can't be beat. 'Billie Jean' & 'Beat It' are off the handle. 'Thriller' is more famous than anyother song in history with that amazing video. This album is like fine wine. It gets better with age. Especially when put against the sub-standard music around today. Get it, it's essential listening!!!!!
B00005V0X5|3.0|This DEBUT seems just like any other debut from an 80s thrash band.  I'd recommend this for die hard fans only, but for the real megadeth sound get Peace Sells or Rust in peace. <br /> <br />Mechanix has a good solo.
B0006IIPIK|5.0|Sky Captain and The World Of Tommorrow is probably the best movie to be ever released. It's full of action, it's got a great storyline, and the acting is superb. I don't understand why anyone doen't like it. The story is about gigantic robots flying in the air, and an aviator and a newspaper reporter have to find out why they are going about. This movie is action-packed, filled with explosions, guns, and good old fistfights. It is really a shame that this movie flopped at the box office, bringing in only $37 million dollars, because that eliminates the chance of a sequel. But if you are looking for a fantastic action/adventure, look no further, you will find it in Sky Captain.
B000000H66|5.0|To anyone who loves Thrash, Black , or Death Metal (or Metal in general) I cannot emphasize enough YOU MUST HAVE this CD!! The musicianship on this album is Amazing!!!Chuck IS amazing on the writing ( not to mention He is an incredible Guitar player!!) Once you hear Death your instantly hooked!! A great album for new listeners to this band to start!! ( although any of the Death catalog will work too!!) Even though the band is no more, they will be immortalized by thier excellent quality musicianship and fantastic Thrash metal!!LONG LIVE DEATH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0385510454|4.0|I've been a fan of John Grisham for years but it seems his last few books have been short on ending. I loved THE LAST JUROR but it tried to combine two different stories in one and I don't think was effective. The ending just sort of dropped away, like a bad Monday Night Movie. <br /> <br />Bleachers was good and I enjoyed listening to the tape with Grisham talking. <br /> <br />THE BROKER is better but I wish it was a little longer with more of an ending. He tends to \\"hurry up\\" and finish these days and there seems to be much more going and then tries to wrap it up quickly. <br /> <br />THE FIRM and TIME TO KILL were favorites.  <br /> <br />
B0000AGWJ7|4.0|Yes, so Ill admit it. The way these guys look is pretty cheesy, they do fit the description of your typical high school \\"goth\\". But behind the eye liner and fingernail polish they have loads of talent, and if you discredit a band simply because you dont like the way they look you are a moron. <br /> <br />The guitar in this album is exceptional, the guitarists have grown by leaps and bounds since Sounding The Seventh Trumpet. The riffs are much more epic and in more of a metalcore direction this album, which works very well. The drumming is also extremely impressive, very fast, and any drummer should appreciate the way he attacks the kit. M Shadows is a good vocalist in my opinion, although he is disliked by many. His screaming isnt the most intimidating that youll ever hear but it still sounds very good, and he obviously puts emotion into what he does. His clean voice is quite good, unlike other metalcore bands like Shadows Fall who have good screaming parts and awful clean vocals, M Shadows can really sing. I almost wish he would sing more. <br /> <br />The songs on this album are very long and creative, almost every song reaching the 5 minute mark (and the few that dont are off by mere seconds), and the songs never stay the same throughout. This is definitely something Id advise you to check out if you liked Avenged Sevenfolds previous albums, or if youre just looking for some good metalcore.
B00005JLEJ|5.0|At last, the full version of this film! I'm confident the DVD will have the usual high quality one associates with the Criterion Collection. I missed the limited run of the full-length version in theaters, two years ago, and am looking forward to this *a lot*. Yes, Coppola and Lucas produced the film and they should be thanked for it. Unfortunately, they also asked Kurosawa to shorten the film, for purely business reasons, thus mutilating the vision of a man they claim to admire.  <br /> <br />Which tends to mitigate the sincerity of their praise.
0380789019|5.0|In the mid eighteen hundreds, an author named Henry Mayhew traveled London's streets gathering life stories from real beggars, thieves, prostitutes and other humble folks  and criminals ordinarily ignored and avoided by those outside their invisible underclass. Mayhew compiled their first-person testimonies into a huge, oral history project focusing on their degradation and the desperate circumstances in which they existed,  his real life characters rivaling those in fictional works by Dickens.    Surely Neil Gaiman is paying homage to Henry Mayhew with the surname of his unassuming protagonist who explores an underworld he never realized was there before -- a thoughtful touch. And I like the blatantly expressive, funny names Gaiman has chosen, in the manner of Dickens,  to suit his characters.  I love the mix of subtle details and over-the-top silliness. I love the way Gaiman, without showing off by explaining too much, plants entertaining bits  through the tale, and I appreciate how well the story holds together despite my missing some.    Roller coastering through Gaiman's London in Neverwhere reminds me of experiencing Mark Helprin's New York in Winter's Tale and gives me similar enjoyment. Readers who require the journey to make sense may not derive the same thrills, but I delight in the effortless ride through London Above and London Below.     The same way beauty is in the eyes of the beholder, the success of this sort of tale depends not only on readers' receptivity to the genre , but also partly what each of us brings to it, the connections and associations it has for us, just as reading the same poems may charm some readers but  repel others. Of course, that's how literature generally works,  but Neverwhere  is especially that kind of story.
B0002UXBD6|4.0|Let's face it; as good as young punk bands are when they first come out, after they've been around for, say, ten years, they'll have gone from making great albums to making about one or two great songs on an otherwise sub-par album (ask the Offspring). But Green Day proved the opposite with the political American Idiot.<br /><br />The album kicks off with a bang with the title track (but wow; are ALL musicians anti-Bush?). As the album goes on you'll find other good tracks like \\"Letterbomb\\" and \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\". And on each of Green Day's albums you'd find a song that you'd be stupid not to like, and this album's example of that would be the hit single \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\".<br /><br />There are also a few general themes on this album. The songs \\"St. Jimmy\\" and \\"Whatsername\\" are referenced throughout other songs, which makes things flow well. Another theme is that there are two five-part songs that seem to show different personalities of the band. \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" is fine (except for the segment \\"I Don't Care\\", which made me say just that), but I really didn't care for \\"Homecoming\\" at all.<br /><br />Oh well, Green Day still proved that they have the skills to rock out like it was 1995. Despite being called American Idiot, picking this up would be a smart investment.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B00020BVXI|5.0|i gave this as a gift and since then i have seen it my self. i saw the movie in theaters, but this was just as great on the 30in lcd tv. very nice and complete gift set here.
0380733358|5.0|In the midst of WWII, with the Germans skeptical of an Allied offensive, Hitler dispenses his most trusted spy into the fray to perform reconnaisance. A man who's been in espionage for what seems an eternity. A man who's definitely worth his salt. Die Nadel (The Needle). All to determine the when and where of the infamous \\"D-Day.\\"<br /><br />This book concerns this man, his mission, and those trying to stop him. Given this is around the Storming of Normandy, a lot of people will be drawn into this book. The subject matter is interesting, to say the least, and so much can be done with it. Ken Follett does NOT disappoint!<br /><br />The character development is fantastic . The storyline is great. The reality portrayed is crystal clear, and highly possible, which can be very hard tofind in other novels. The emotional roller coaster is real.<br /><br />'The Eye of the Needle' is not a long book, but it is made much shorter with the gripping story-telling. This book makes me an instant Follett fan. If you're on the fence about starting this, jump over and dive in. This is a great one! Happy reading!
B0002858YS|5.0|There is a similarity between Franz Ferdinand and The Killers. There is one big difference though. The Killers are better. Franz Ferdinand is okay but I love listening to this CD. It is good all the way through. \\"Somebody Told Me\\" is probably the most popular on the CD, but all the other songs are just as good. I would normaly give you a list of songs and tell you which songs were good, but they are all excelent. I havn't had this CD for too long but it is in my CD player all the time. I got Hot Fuss primarly to get a different type of music in my CD collection. When I started to listen to it I was extremly surprised with how good it was. It is very addicting and very good. BUY THIS CD! <br /> <br />***I also recommend Get Born by Jet***look it up please
B0002IU988|1.0|Mark and Scott are great, as usual, but Kennedy just doesn't have what it takes.  His voice is VERY whiney, and the lyrics aren't as good as Creed's.  Mark and Scott should have stuck with Stapp!
B00005JNBQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It was along the lines of Rushmore, but with quite a bit less to the plot.  It was, however, VERY funny, very unique, and heartfelt.  The main characters are not to be pitied, but admired for their kindness, uniqueness, and good attitude (except when feeding a pet llama...) ;) <br /> <br />I don't know why some folks don't seem to like it, unless they can't get past the indie vibe oozing from the movie.  It's quirky, choppy, and it almost seems \\"homemade\\", but it's a wonderful movie and I would say almost ANY age could watch this movie safely.  There are very few \\"adult-like\\" themes and no swearing whatsoever. <br /> <br />Just a good buddy, feel good, hilarious movie.  I took away one star because the plot could have been punched up quite a bit.
B00004XPPB|5.0|Although I haven't read the book from which this movie is based on, I loved \\"Donnie Brasco.\\" Also, this movie was a blind buy. I've heard good things about it, so I decided to buy it. I was sceptical as to what this movie would be like, because I always had this vision that Johnny Depp was a \\"pretty boy\\" romantic actor. However I did like him in \\"Secret Window,\\" the only other movie I've ever seen him in. Neeless to say, I was impressed with his performance in this movie. I wasn't expecting him to come close to standing with my favorite actor, Pacino. In this movie, however, Depp showed that he can stand toe-to-toe with the best in the business. Of course, Pacino was excellent in this movie also. I also enjoyed Michael Madsen (better known for his role as Mr. Blonde in \\"Reservoir Dogs\\") although, the entire movie I wass waiting for something as memorable as the infamous \\"ear scene\\" from \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" from him. All in all, I have to say that \\"Donnie Brasco\\" is a great, underrated movie, and is now amongst my favorites.
B00005JNLY|4.0|While I had reservations about a semi-serious role played by Adam Sandler, and the concept of yet another spanish speaking \\"maid\\", I found this movie a surprising delight.  It strayed from the stereotypes, yet the situations and reactions of each character were real.  The premise of the story is that Adam Sandler and Tea Leoni are high school sweethearts who got married, started a family, and the wife quit her sucessful full time job to raise the children.  Both parents have different philosophies on how to raise their children, with the wife being distant and disappointed with her overweight daughter, yet she wants to be supportive - just doing it in an insensitive manner.  Tea Leoni decides to hire the help of a housekeeper, who she finds is not able to speak English, but can communicate through her daughter.  The housekeeper is trying to get by day-by-day raising her daughter as a single mother and teaching her solid values.  She struggles with her daughter losing her culture and values through the immersion in this new American upper class culture and she works hard to protect her from this.  On a side note, Adam Sandler and the housekeeper being to develop a relationship based in mutual respect and are drawn to each other for comfort (Tea Leoni becomes a slight agitator to this as she is spending much of her own time away from her family), but both know that they can not pursue this.  Overall, I found the movie to be endearing, if not slightly bittersweet.
B00004Y9PP|5.0|<br />I absolutely loved this movie. I watched it at least 5 times. The story is one of a kind and it happenend in an exotic and unique setting. I enjoyed this movie very much. I strongly recommend it!
B0006IIKS0|3.0|Upon first purchasing this movie i was pretty pysched because it was totally behind the scenes and not just about the big bad history of the mighty Metallica.And although its loaded with great footage of the band at each others throats it also sheds some insight on the inner structures,and emotions of each individual member.But at the end of the day when all is said and done i still don't see how it has or \\"will\\" make them a better band or better people.In fact i think this should have been a go out with our dignity and with a great legacy,instead of letting people see this first hand and continuing on.James still doesnt have any of the aggression or creative ideas(angst)that he once had,its all to forced and doesnt come natural anymore,nor can he sing without his voice crackling above 2 octaves,which isnt totally his fault.Once married,the anger tends to leave and the band and the song writing ability take a back seat or have no place at all anymore,from watching this you can see that the issue is,family first,Metallica next,(doesnt work in the music industry)sorry.Need to choose one or the other,and it looks as though from this feature James has choose family,which i can relate to first hand.Plus's of the disc are Lar's dad coming in and criticing the new disc,the first FACE TO FACE and HEART TO HEART(at least from Dave's side) of Dave Mustaine and Little Danish Lar's,in which Dave basically gets blown off even though he poors out his soul to Lar's in reminiscing about the early days,in which Lars is quiet \\"cold\\"in his responses.But all in all this disc should have been a Farewell,NOT a continuation into something that the main member doesnt feel he wants to be a part of,in his sober happy self.So basically whatever the future holds for Metallica has yet to be seen i just wish they would fade away instead of kicking a dead horse over and over till there is nothing left but some left over old \\"bones\\".
B0001KZM3O|1.0|As a Roger Waters' album, I would give this two stars. As a Pink Floyd album, it gets a one star rating at best. It isn't really until the last three songs that it even feels vaguely like \\"Pink Floyd\\" (and that's \\"The Wall\\" era Floyd, at that), or that there's much musicality at all in Roger's poetic lament. There was a time that I enjoyed this album, when I appreciated everything Floyd in the '80's. But in retrospect, I think it's an outrage that this was released under the name \\"Pink Floyd,\\" and Gilmour and Mason need to be blamed as well for allowing Waters to take so much control. At least they remedied the situation with two fine Floyd releases sans Waters, and a great Gilmour solo release in 1984.
B0002X314C|4.0|I love this cd! I was anxious for it in October but it came just in time.  My favorite track is \\"Let's Get Lifted (Again)\\". I can't wait for the next cd.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Who is Matthew Cooke, on what basis did he write this ludicrous review, and will he continue to review Muse discs in the future? <br /> <br />To those of you at Amazon.com, it's hard to take your highlighted reviews seriously when they consist of tripe like this. <br /> <br />Mr Cooke, the only one running in circles is you.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|A friend of mine recommended this movie.  I had never heard of it and didn't know what to expect. My husband and I (who are almost senior citizens) watched this movie and laughed all the way through.  I highly recommend this movie if you are ready for something truly different.
B0000004V2|5.0|The best Stone Roses release, and one of the best albums I've heard. The Stone Roses put a full stop to the grey wash that hung over the late 1980s British music scene after the departure of The Smiths, bringing melodies, harmonies, and (sometimes) funky beats together in a fusion that hangs incredibly well together on this album. From the simmering opening to the final funky beat of 'Fool's Gold' 'The Stone Roses' is a tour de force, with echoes of Beatles, Simon and Garfunkel, Rolling Stones, and even Sly and the Family Stone. No bad tracks, but highlights are the opening track, 'I Wanna Be Adored', 'Waterfall', 'Made of Stone' and the clever 'Don't Stop', which is 'Waterfall' backwards with some lyrics and instrumentation added.  <br /> <br />Oasis, The Verve, The Charlatans, and more recently Kasabian are some of the bands most overtly influenced by the Roses, but none of them have ever done anything this good in my opinion.  <br /> <br />Everyone I've played this to has loved it. It's an exhilerating first listen (yep, I remember), and still great 16 years on. Buy this twice before you even think about their dismally disappointing second album 'Second Coming'.
B00005BKZJ|5.0|Percy Aldon built a simple but haunting script in the middle of nowhere between two women. Both  will enrich the life through a set of clever and incisive vignettes. Two cultures will join the best of its nature and the result will be a very original picture.<br /><br />A powerful and funny film which joins to the elder major film Babette Feast as the two greatest films dedicated to the friendship : that treasure of the Gods.
B0000TB050|2.0|\\"All that you can't leave behind\\" is a lame boring album. <br /> <br />The concert is so \\"happy and everything is fine.\\" <br /> <br />Popmart tour is way better than this.
B0006IUDXA|5.0|I have LOVED Macgyver for years, and was not-so-patiently waiting for it to come out on DVD.  I'm thrilled to be able to watch on DVD, instead of my ten year old vcr tapes.  I'm thrilled that the PTB finally granted our wish to have this wonderful program on DVD.  My only disappointments are that it's only available in Full Screen, and there are NO special features.  I hope in future season releases they add  interviews with some of the recurring characters like Penny Parker(Teri Hatcher) and Murdoc(Michael des Barres).
B00006RU5B|1.0|Mainstream, Fake sounding, plastic rubbish. <br />Its stupid. <br /> <br />Adults to little kids are listening to this bollix, so it seems. <br />Not to mention its very boring. <br /> <br />It would be nice to hear Chris Cornell do some actual singing, instead of roaring and droning all the time. <br /> <br />This band could do so much more with their sound. <br />I think they'll prove that with thier next album - .......I hope.
B000063DGC|5.0|A tribute to Randy Rhoads is necessary and I am glad this release sounds as excellent as Randy Rhoads the guitar player/song writer was.  Recommended to any rock fan, this cd rocks from start to finish with awesome live tracks.  I feel that Ozzy's best solo moments and songs were during the Randy Rhoads era and unfortunately it was way too brief.
B000669GAI|2.0|Some good moments. <br />\\"I Got ID\\" is awesome. <br /> <br />Pearl Jams first album should of been \\"Riot Act.\\"
B000000OS2|5.0|I guess this was the innovation of the \\"unplugged\\" era, excellent release and very recommended to any rock fan.  Tesla nails this and brings a whole new sound to their awesome catalog of Tesla songs and other well known songs that seem to fit right in to the set.  Buy it, play it, and you won't want to put it away.
B0006399FS|1.0|What a dreadful album. <br />U2 are'nt even a shadow of their formerself. <br /> <br />Just for the record their last \\"actual\\" album is \\"POP\\" -  musically amazing, and no body noticed - and that is a good thing. <br /> <br />Please think of the \\"trees\\" who were cut and down and tunred into wood chips so they could make the CD booklet, which is actually better than the album, although the front cover is terrible. <br /> <br />U2 are'nt cool anymore. <br />
B000000WJZ|5.0|Because Pink Floyd was more experimental, and Dark Side of the Moon is my favorite album ever, the Pumpkins come in as a close 2nd, but alas, this album is the best \\"rock\\" album of all time.  It came at just the right time, and totally blew Nirvana out of the water.  Everything here is just masterfully done.  A drum roll and electric guitar open up \\"Cherub Rock\\".  Who can forget the amazing song \\"Today\\", one of the best radio rock hits of the 90's.  Songs like \\"Hummer\\" and \\"Rocket\\" really add to this album, and \\"Disarm\\" was an instant radio hit as well.  My personal favorite on this album has to be \\"Mayonaise\\"  There just hasn't been a song like it.  \\"Silverf**k\\" is a long song that really shows the impressive drumming of Jimmy Chamberlin.  <br /> <br />Nothing can compare to this album.  It just came at the right time.  It brought the Pumpkins instantly into the light, something that Gish didn't do.  Don't get me wrong, Gish is a great album, but if you want somewhere to start if your a new Pumpkinhead, this is the place.
B000056TKD|5.0|These 2 recordings are simply the best ones available, and it's due to the combination of a masterful conductor and a world-class orchestra in a superb hall with killer organ, and inspired interpretations. If only RCA or Mercury could have recorded these instead of DGG. Even with thin bass, overly close micing at times, and curiously distant micing at others, the performances survive as the best ever. <br />     Much of the magic here is summed up in one word: tempos! Many have noted Steinberg's fast tempos in the Holst, often sighting Mars as particularly too fast. Well, they are plan wrong. The composer himself recorded this suite electrically in 1926. You think Steinberg's 46 minutes is fast? Holst gets through it in under 41! Now some have said the engineers rushed him so as to get the music to fit on the old 78 discs. That is totally false. Others have said he wasn't a good conductor. OK, ensemble sloppiness bears that out, but doesn't hold water when it comes to basic tempi. Holst marked Mars as \\"Allegro\\" which means, quite simply, \\"fast.\\" At a timing of 6:18, Holst conducted it fast. He wanted it fast! Steinberg comes in at 6:34. In every other movement but Uranus, Steinberg is 0:30 to 0:70 slower than Holst, but still closely approximates the interpretations, and those interpretations are superb. Only in Uranus is Steinberg faster than Holst, but at 5:22, it's the tempo you're used to hearing, but with precision that's rarely matched, and an organ gliss that will blow you across the room! <br />     Again, on the Strauss, the forward motion is always there, making Zarathustra as wonderfully unified as it can possibly be. <br />     Bernstein and the 1962 Karajan [Vienna Phil] in the Planets have superior moments [especially Karajan's use of metal hammers on the chimes in Saturn as specified by Holst] and Reiner and Karajan also turn in superb Zarathustras, but here are both on one CD about as close to perfection as one can get and, I suspect, closest tothe composer's intentions.
B000000WA4|5.0|The Smashing Pumpkins did something that only a very small amount of grunge bands did hailing from the grunge era, they survived it.  The Smashing Pumpkins were never about grunge, and I don't know why they fall into that category.  The great thing about this album is that it's so diverese, that every song is different.  There are no two songs alike on this album, something that a brilliant songwriter such as Corgan should be proud of.  To the person below that wrote he threw out the 2nd disc: your an idiot.  You fail to realize that there was more behind the 2nd disc then just noise.  Sure tunes like \\"Bodies\\", \\"Where Boys Fear To Tread\\", and \\"XYU\\" were metalish, but your forgetting the amazing songs such as \\"1979\\", \\"33\\", \\"Through The Eyes of Ruby\\", and \\"Farewell & Goodnight\\".  Heck even \\"In The Arms of Sleep\\" is a good tune.  So failure to follow that results in you being a very terrible pumpkinhead. <br /> <br />With all that said, there's nothing quite like this double album.  From the start of the album with the piano intro, to the ending with all four band mates singing a part, this album shines.  It's incredible.  And it's worthwhile to note that I've always conceived the pumpkins as an artistic rock band.  This album shows it.  Every album that the pumpkins did was great, in my opinion.  This album doesn't beat Simaese Dream, but it stands next to it as being a key element in the 90's.  The pumpkins were a true force that got alot of high school kids and alot of people through the troubled times of the 90's, and it's a shame to have seen that mtv ruined them.   <br /> <br />But I plead with everyone out there, if you want an essential album, get this album. You will not be disapointed.
B000002VMH|4.0|My list of favorite female vocalists is rather short but Annie is right at the top.  This album is not perfect but it sure is good.  She could recite the alphabet and make it sound superb.  I finally got to hear her live this past summer and she had the most powerful voice I've ever heard.  The majority of her concert consisted of songs from this cd and they sounded as fresh as the first time I heard them.  \\"Why\\" \\"Cold\\" and \\"Money Can't Buy It\\" are fantastic.  This is a must-have collection of songs.
B000006NPY|5.0|With there 1995 release, \\"Mellon Collie & The Infinite Sadness\\", The Smashing Pumpkins showed the world how hard they could rock, but also a softer, more mellow side.  Then with the departure of Jimmy Chamberlin, and the death of their pianist to a drug overdose, The Pumpkins had to scramble with what to do next.  Then the death of Billy's mother in 1997 really put a strain on things.  You can't help but realize that this is what makes this album so much different from the other pumpkins albums.  Alot of people hate this album, and think that this is the downfall of the pumpkins.  I think this is where the pumpkins really started to shine.  They showed the world that they could grow up and stop singing angst written songs and start writing brilliant ballads and amazing acoustic songs.  This album is just magnifacient in comparison to all the other Pumpkins albums.  Sure it's definitly not the place to start if you are a new Pumpkinhead, but it's defintily a worthy purchase down the road.
B0006IIKS0|5.0|I loved this movie. Even though I've been a longtime Metallica fan, I like to think that I'm unbiased in what they do. Let me address a number of things that were brought up by reviewers. The reason why the DVD is in this TV screen ratio is NOT because it was supposed to be a reality show or a reality tv series. It is because the film material was supposed to be released as bonus material, much like the St. Anger Sessions DVD was released with St. Anger itself. After filming was well underway, the band saw that there was much more than that in what had already been filmed and (after the film's original financial supporter wanted to stop the filming) bought the movie so that filming could continue. Also, that comment Lars made about Cliff Burton not cutting it if he were auditioning for the band at that point in time was supposed to make fun of the band itself, not Cliff. He meant that the way they're auditioning without any clear structure and/or recklessly that even if they came across the greatest bass player (a.k.a. Cliff), then they still would've messed up and sent him away. Regardless, I thought that the film itself was very entertaining. It was unrelenting in the sense that it portrayed the band in a light which the public has never seen it before. I must admit that the scene with Dave Mustaine was extremely entertaining. If you want more, make sure to watch the second DVD, as it has an alternate take (and a couple more minutes) of the Mustaine talk. Even though it goes without saying that Metallica fans should definitely watch this film, it surely is a film that everyone will enjoy. Just make sure to leave preconceptions about the band at the door.
B000002HAJ|5.0|Sounds kind of trite and cliched, huh? But cheesiness aside, I have always been eager to listen to Wish, since I own the previous Cure albums from Disintegration to their recent, self-titled release. Constantly sampling the album's tracks on Amazon.com itself, I knew I had to own it. When I first listened to Wish in its entirety, I must say I was dumfounded by its brilliance, which was subtle and explosive at the same time. While Open's lyrics are well-written, it wasn't my favorite track, and I'm usually into dark songs far more than I'm into happy songs, but I found that High was probably my favorite track on the entire album. The Cure will go down in music history, let alone alternative and/or goth music history, as a band which has carried the most distinct sound, especially in Bamonte and Thompson's guitars. Wish is definitely a departure from Disintegration, considered by many to be a definitive masterpiece, but I enjoy the fact that Boris Williams gets to showcase some real drumming skills, as does the rest of the band in its vibrant instrumentals. This is mandatory to a Cure fan, hardcore or not.
B00064YTMU|5.0|Beautifully shot and directed, this tour de force features stellar performances by both Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx (should have gotten a \\"Best Actor\\" nom...there's nothing \\"supporting\\" about his role...it's 50/50 with Cruise, who also does some of his best work to date).<br /><br />Novel concept, smartly adapted and interpreted.  Fantastic supporting cast led by Pinkett Smith and Ruffalo.  So much care and attention went into the detail of this film that it is a pleasure to watch and gripping from beginning to end.<br /><br />The DVD contains many interesting special features, particularly rehearsal footage and Director's Commentary.  Kudoes to Cruise, Foxx, Mann and Beattie on a wonderful work.
B00008S2VG|1.0|It's no wonder this album wreaks of insecurity. If I had no talent, I'd be just as insecure, and try anything to get my failing career back on track. This feeble attempt at art proves once again that Manny is in deep trouble w/a career that is looked upon as over and will never have any new music heard on the radio again. Any new efforts will be ignored.
0316172324|3.0|While this book is well written as an introduction to the influence of Intuition in decision making, it is relatively \\"thin soup\\". I would suggest that folks with an interest in this topic read \\"Educating Intuition \\" by Robin Hogarth. R.Olsen, Decision Scientist.
0783225547|4.0|Pierce Brosnan is the main reason for recommending this movie, (although the whole movie does have a polished feel) as a battle hardened Vulcanologist sent to investigate some unusual readings in peaceful upper Washington State. Soon after his arrival he becomes alarmed at what he discovers, and dutifully informs the authorities of impending disaster who choose (of course) to ignore him, in time honored fashion. Although you know pretty much what is going to happen thereafter, this movie is pretty gripping, and was arguably better than \\"Volcano\\" with Tommy Lee Jones, which was released around the same time. Yes, it's riddled with cliches, and has an essential mixture of characters you might find in any disaster based story, but it has a certain something that gives it a more dramatic feel. Linda Hamilton of Terminator fame is the love interest/only person sensible enough to believe Mr Brosnan, and around the mid way point the story changes (reliably almost) into an escape flick. One or two scenes of intense peril, make this unsuitable for smaller children, but otherwise it's fairly tame. Considering the year of production the special effects are pretty amazing, and the acting all round adds more than credibility to the storyline. Although others will I'm sure disagree, this is a far better picture than say, the more recent Day After Tomorrow for not relying solely on good visuals, and is testament to the fact that a good story, makes for a good movie. Worth a revisit even if you've seen it before, and a decent amount of extra's on the DVD make it worth a purchase. Enjoy.
B000002WYT|5.0|The first CD i ever owned was Crash when i was 13 years old. Even then i loved it.  There are a few things that make this album great. 1)First of the instumentals on this album are incredible.  For example the acoustic guitar in \\"so much to say\\" and \\"lie in our graves is great.  It offers and catchy and exciting opening to the songs that make you come begging for more.2) One thing i love about this album is that is all upbeat all the songs make you feel good inside. Overall this is one of my favorite albums of all time and I highly recommend it to anyone.  [...]
B00064MW6A|3.0|Halle Berry has certainly got the look (and \\"got milk?\\" in one fun scene), in this attempt to bring the marvel character up to date, but sadly that's about it. The most recent comparison would of course have to be Michelle Pfeiffer as the leather clad feline fighter in Tim Burtons Batman Returns, and whereas I understand characters must evolve with the times, they should not be changed altogether. Pfeiffer and Burton came close to encapsulating the multi faceted role, whereas this time around the production team and director seem to have missed by a mile. Ms Berry plays Patience Phillips, a Plain Jane artist, seeking her inner self, and trapped working for a large cosmetic conglomerate as a designer. She overhears something bad about the companies latest product and is dispatched forthwith, by the villainous Sharon Stone, as wife to the head of the company. Reborn with the aid of a mystical Egyptian Mau cat, and a seemingly all wise \\"little old lady\\" she emerges as Catwoman, and sets about bringing her erstwhile foes to justice, and in so doing discover her true self. The visual distraction of her in a costume that would have fried the censors back in the 60's may be enough for adolescents, or the less demanding viewer, but this is a pretty poor attempt really. The darkness and depth of the Marvel creation is never seen, as Ms Berry plays out a little girl lost turned Vigilante with a muddled ambivalence. Staying well inside the Politically Correct (PC) line, she is almost shown as a goody two shoes, reluctantly playing a part and keeping everyone happy, rather than getting inside the storybook character. Another BIG complaint for me is the CGI fusion with live action. Much like the \\"Blade\\" movies, seeing a cartoon computer overlay scramble up walls, flip, turn, jump and perform inhuman stunts doesn't work I'm afraid, even if you do seemlessly match it with the actor in places. Even impressive SfX should compliment a films story,  NOT try and carry it altogether. There are some nice extra's on the DVD however, and the story is not too ridiculous. The supporting cast are sound, and the visuals OK, but you keep feeling that the script writer and director should have taken the plunge a little more, rather than just dipping their toes into an Iconic character such as they have here. OK for a wet afternoon, and a PG audience, but that's about it. Disappointing.ere are some nice extra's on the DVD however, and the story is not too ridiculous.

B000001E3V|4.0|Any young drummers looking for hints on playing good rock live need this cd. Jim Gordon is flawless and the drums are the best recorded instrument on the cd.  Aside from that, this set really misses Duane.
B000002GJH|5.0|The one and only release by supergroup Temple of the Dog is one of the best and most emotionally powerful albums of the 90's.  If you want an album that perfectly exemplifies the early 90's grunge scene, one of three albums comes to mind: Soundgarden's \\"Superunknown\\", Pearl Jam's \\"Ten\\", and this one right here. This monumental release is just a perfect blend of perfectly crafted musicianship, sensitive and sophisticated songcraft, and pure soul power.<br /><br />For those who've been living in a spider hole and don't know, Temple of the Dog was basically the current Pearl Jam lineup (with Matt Cameron on drums), with Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell on vocals.  Musically, it's a bit more laid-back and atmospheric than either of those bands, awash in bluesy, folky melodies, arising into driving hard rock from time to time.  Chris Cornell's vocals on this album are just perfect.  He achieved a level of soul power here that no white guy should ever be able to attain.  This is easily one of his most powerful vocal performances of all time.  However, he's not the only one who takes the spotlight, as Mike McCready's blistering blues guitar attack, and Cameron's thunderous Bonham-like drumming are quite prominent as well.  But the music, on the whole, is just plain perfect all around.<br /><br />You might remember the mega hit \\"Hunger Strike\\", which is an excellent song, and gives me a solid dose of nostalgia like few others, but there's plenty more to enjoy here.  \\"Say Hello 2 Heaven\\", the opening track, is a sprawling emotional ballad, with Cornell's jaw-dropping vocal performance, and a huge guitar solo.  \\"Your Savior\\" and \\"Pushing Forward Back\\" are killer hard tunes, \\"Call Me a Dog\\" and \\"All Night Thing\\" are soft and beautiful, and \\"Wooden Jesus\\" and \\"Times of Trouble\\" are folky, Zeppelin-esque tracks.  \\"Reach Down\\" is a mammoth 11-minute epic, with scorching jams, and super-soulful choruses, complete with female backing vocals.  It's almost worth buying the album just for this one song.<br /><br />This is, simply put, one of the best rock albums of the 90's.  If you don't have it, get it.  If you don't get it, you are quite evil.m just for this one song.   <br /> <br />This is, simply put, one of the best rock albums of the 90's.  If you don't have it, get it.  If you don't get it, you are quite evil.   <br />
B00004S873|2.0|This is a stereo SACD not a 6-channel remastering.  It's nice, but if you've heard 6-channel, it's somewhat disappointing.
B0000027RL|5.0|There's really not much that needs to be said about this album, other than it's perfect.  From start to finish.  Every note, every song.  Hard rock seriously does not get much better.  Nearly every song has become a classic, and the ones who didn't should have.  Hopefully you already have this album, and hopefully if you don't you've been in some manner of bomb shelter for the past 15 years.  But for whatever shameful reason you don't own it, buy it now.  Seriously, just do it.  You will not be disappointed, and if you are, you probably worship Saga.
B000002MFN|5.0|This is Madonna's very underrated album Erotica which came out in 1992. I remember I was a freshman in college and received it for Christmas.  Everyone assumed it was about sex from the title track and the picture on the front cover of the CD. It was also when her controversial book \\"Sex\\" came out. Erotica and Where Life Begins are the only 2 songs that really deal with that subject matter. All the songs talk about your everday emotions, feelings, and basically life. This album next to ROL from the 90's is a masterpiece. Ray Of Light being the 1st of course. When I got I; I fell in love with Deeper and Deeper, Rain, and Thief Of Hearts.    Erotica is a great song and deals with sex, but not the whole song does. It starts off great and I like the way the record is scratching  in the beginning.  It's supposed to be like that very cool.I like how she says \\"I don't think you know what pain is\\" and \\"I dont think you've gone that way\\"  So true in life. Many people dont really know what pain it. Physical or mental pain that is. It ends brilliantly with the record scratching.    Fever is a great classic remake of the original song by Peggie Lee. Madonna really nothces  this song up by about 10 amps with more energy and sounds its great.      Madonna gets nasty in Bye Bye Baby and talks about \\" Does it hurt you to see me cry, I think it does\\". That happens a lot in life unfortunately. This song is a semi- fast song. There is a unique sound before she says \\"I'd like to hurt you\\" and a another similar sound repeated a few times. Overall a great song.    Deeper and Deeper is my favorite fast dance track where she talks about \\" a sin from heaven above\\" \\" I am never going to hind it again\\" Meaning the song deals with homosexuality. It's really difficult to understand at first from the lyrics. I thought it was about something else. The video all disco and its not too bad. Madonna's looks great in it with her long blonde hair. She sings a line from her own song Vogue \\" You got to just let your body Vogue to the music\\". This will always be remembered as a definite classic expecially on this CD.    Where Life Begins again talks about life, working, sex, and food, interesting. The title can will tell you a lot of the lyrics from this song.It has a pretty good beat to it.    Bad Girl is a somewhat of a good ballad about a girl getting drunk by six and who is unhappy with her life and invited all guys up without knowing the real consequnces which is shown in the amazing video. Christopher Walken plays her guardian angel in this video. I like the extended version better of Bad Girl better that can be found on the maxi single. The beginning with the piano opening is very well done.    Waiting is not too bad of a song. She is waiting for a special person and she doesn't want that person \\"to break her heart\\". This song probably incorporates the best and most sounds. Toward the 3/4 of the songs she raps a little and then goes back to the regular beat. This song has great lyrics to it and get back and the person who she has been waiting for.    Words talks about \\"actions are louder than words\\" very good message and how \\"you tried to manipulate me with your words\\". This is a fast song too. There is a section in the song towards last 3/4 of the song where the music get different and you can hear Madonna's voice more pronounced and sings \\"how they warned me about you\\". The ending is great and you hear the typewriting typing and the return button used very clever!!    Thief Of Hearts starts out with a shattered glass being broken and she says \\"b**ch\\" and she sings about \\"stealing your boyfriend\\" and  \\"when she acts like she is your best friend\\" behind your back  I just love the end. Powerful words here with more swearing and the end where she says \\"stop b**ch\\" with the shattered glass being broken and ends it with  \\"sit you a$$ down\\"    Rain is  beautiful ballad that I absolutely love. It talks about feelings and love. The thunder and the rain at the end ofthe song is breathtaking. My favorite ballad from this CD and will go down as a classic.    Why Is's So Hard is where she explains how it's hard to love and and tell us no one has the right to tell us what to believe in, brilliant. I love WISH. I listen to it more than before and have just recognized what a great song it is with such powerful words. You can hear Madonna's voice and how powerfully she feels about what she is singing about. There are some great mid tempos to dance to in this one too.    In This Life she talks about how people would rather turn the other way and how she lost a good friend from AIDS who was only 23. This is a sad slow song and you can hear the emotions in her voice where she sings.    Did You Do It? Is a rap with Waiting in it brillantly mixed in. Did you do it is mostly rapper just rapping in it and its not really a song.      Secret Garden has a good dance beat to it is pretty good too and has a lot of jazz and piano incorporated in this song. Madonna sings this song in a very seductive voice like \\"will you undress me so you can caress me\\".    I highly recommend this CD if you do not own it yet!! This is her second best in the 90's era!!!  It has a lot of great songs on it and I do not know what it was so harsly panned by the critics. . The best 5 songs are Erotica, Deeper And Deeper, Rain, Thief Of Hearts, and Why Is It So Hard.
B0000508U6|4.0|Parachutes is a melancholy, emotional disc with mellow guitars and Chris Martin's cracked, pained voice.  The first few songs are the heaviest, and the end of the CD is that much less boisterous.  Yellow, which got heavy airplay is, for me anyway, the catchiest song on the album. <br /> <br />My picks for songs to check out now: Yellow, Trouble, Shiver, High Speed. <br /> <br />If you like Coldplay's A Rush Of Blood To The Head, you will probably like this one too.  Parachutes is more upbeat than their later disc, but just as enjoyable.  Whatever Coldplay do, they do well.
B000002LCD|5.0|I am rating this for the 4 Madonna songs on the CD. As usual Madonna has done it again. Who's that Girl is a good song, not the best but pretty darn good, Look Of Love is absolutely breathtaking, Causing A Commotion is my favorite a typical catchy pop tune and Can't Stop another catchy pop tune. I recommend the CD too bad the other songs are on it but you get to hear Madonna so thats important. Can't wait for the new CD, love ya!
B000069AUI|4.0|Coldplay pulled at the listeners' heartstrings with Parachutes, and they do so even more with A Rush Of Blood To The Head.  The songs on this album are tamer, more melancholy, and Chris Martin has perfected his cracked, pained, whiny voice. <br /> <br />I like this CD, but I find I have to be in the right mood to listen to it.  When I am in the mood though, I really do enjoy it.  It is so emotionally weighty and the piano sounds so beautiful, that I just can't help but like it.  Clocks is a perfect example of this. <br /> <br />My preferred tracks: Clocks, In My Place, The Scientist, Daylight, Politik. <br /> <br />Once again Coldplay has made a deep, moving, satisfying album.  This is typical Coldplay, so if you like them, you will like this one.
B0006IIKS0|5.0|I am a major Metallica fan first and foremost.  I drove out of town to see this in theaters, and read the book \\"This Monster Lives\\" prior to the DVD release, and bought this immediately on release day.  So, this review is coming from the standpoint of a fanatic.<br /><br />The movie itself is a fascinating look that gives Metallica a new face.  It shows them as people struggling, but not in an extreme \\"rock star\\" way.  It makes them look human, and almost normal.  But without being this way, they probably would have never progressed.<br /><br />St. Anger was a rather controversial album.  This documentary shows the turmoil that went into making the album, and will give the audience a new view of the album.  It doesn't answer EVERY question (such as the drum sound, which is addressed in the book by the way), but it does show how several of the songs came about.<br /><br />The documentary is fascinating, funny, and very revealing.  You see each member evolve into something new.  Without giving away details of the overall narration of the movie, there are definetely \\"must see\\" moments, especially when they are told to do the radio promos, which is funnier than most of this summer's comedies were.<br /><br />The Bonus scenes are hit and miss.  Some are gold, such as the Raiders game, gig at Kimos, Kirk's driving school song, and Kirk's birthday.  Others are rather short, and wouldn't have been missed much in any situation.  I highly recommend reading the book to accompany the \\"This Monster Lives\\" section, because it gives some great insight into each of these scenes, which are for the most part the best of the bunch among the deleted stuff.<br /><br />If you are a Metallica fan, do yourself a favor and pick this up.
B00000373U|5.0|This is simply the best pop album ever recoreded. Elliott Smith is the best songwriters of our generation, and much like a certain beatle left us far too soon. \\"Ballad of Big Nothing\\" and \\"Say Yes\\" are in my humble opinion the best songs on the album, perfect for sinking back into a leather chair and drinking a bottle of whiskey, \\"Between the Bars\\" and \\"2:45\\" will make you shake your head, gulp down 4 tylenol and wish you hadn't. \\"Alameda\\" and \\"Angeles\\" are beautiful songs about an ugly city (Take that LA). It's almost scary how damn good this cd is.  Elliott Smith is a lot like a Hitori Hanzo sword, you don't compare his songs to each other, but to every other song ever written that was not written by Elliott Smith. Someday heaven will stop stealing the good ones and start taking the idiots like 50 Cent and The Killers (Just buy a Joy Division CD instead). Bright Eyes, Pedro the Lion and their Ilk owe Smith some royalty checks. Buy it, steal it, download it, just get it.
B0006MT314|5.0|Although I haven't seen the show, they certainly have great taste in music, as seen on the album. With already known stars including Sheryl Crow, Michelle Branch, Gavin Degraw, and Jimmy Eat World, and rising stars Story of the Year, Keane, and Tyler Hilton, this album is a MUST HAVE!!! With a few exclusive tracks including a live performance of Gavin Degraws \\"I don't want to be\\", and Acoustic tracks of Tyler Hilton's \\"Glad\\", Story of the Year's \\"Sidewalks\\", and Sheryl Crow's \\"The First Cut is the Deepest\\", this album will have you singing the sweet serenade that is music. And don't forget the new Michelle Branch and Jessica Harp group...aka..THE WRECKERS!!! Their song \\"The Good Kind\\" is easily one of the best songs on the album and has a strong folk feel to it with a hint of country...a nice blend! And how about the hidden jewels of Trespassers William soothingly beautiful \\"Lie in the Sound\\", Butch Walker alternative \\"Mixtape\\", Travis funky \\"Re-Offender\\" that sounds like a cross of Moby and Fatboy Slim, the 22-20s \\"Shoot Your Gun\\" and the Rock n Roll Soldiers funky-ly kick a$$ song \\"Funny Little Feeling\\"...top-notch work!! Tyler Hilton and Bethany Joy Lenz's rendition of \\"When the Stars Go Blue\\" is a pleasant rendiditon of the classic verson and ready for Adult Contemporary Radio! Anyway, Go out and Buy the album!! You won't be disappointed
B00005JNEI|5.0|This important 'film of our times' is not to be missed.  It is a scathing and mostly truthful view of this inept and foolish administration that is leading us down the wrong road in so many ways, domestically and internationally.  True patriotism is not a 'party dependent' concept.  Yet the right wing would have you think it is, as they feel they have the market cornered on patriotism, morality, and truth. Moore, like millions of Americans and people around the world, shows his patriotism, outrage, and concern throughout this masterpiece by exposing Bush for what he is.  Mainly, an arrogant, inept fool who uses 'god' to illegally invade another sovereign country based on WMD lies and the fear of terrorism brought to focus on 9/11.  Even though it was mostly Saudi nationals who attacked us that day, not Iraqis!  Most of the world believes that our retaliation in Afghanistan was a 'just war', whereas this Iraqi invasion was folly and wrong.  The geological areas that were hit on 9/11 (NY, PA, D.C.) even voted against Bush last November.  That says it all.  If you care about America, see this great, truthful patriotic film, or ignore it at your peril!  I have a lot of respect for Michael Moore's work, and his penchant and talent in exposing hard truths, which is in many cases the road less travelled these days in America.  God Bless Michael Moore!
B0006M4SO6|3.0|I have been a huge Pat Metheny/Metheny Group fan for years now and will continue to buy pretty much anything he puts out.  That being said, I must admit that this album is not all I had hoped it to be.  After several years of anticipation and after hearing the concepts that were being used to make this record, I assumed it would be similar to Speaking Of Now except in a longer form.  I was also very excited when I saw Richard Bona's name on the liner notes...and dissapointed when his appearance was only brief.  When the water boils out of the pot, the record is absolutely brilliant, but it does lack the memorable melodies and textural developments that Imaginary Day or Speaking of Now posess.  Unless you really understand jazz theory and solo development this may not be the album to buy. <br /> <br />To Pat Metheny's credit though, I cannot imagine the pressure that comes with being one of the most creative, prolific and competent musicians of the twentieth and beyond centuries.  Honestly, who would want more of the same from such an outstanding artist?  I think we have Norah Jones to fill those shoes.  Besides, he has won more Grammy's than one should care to count. I give major props to PMG for their constant pursuit of new and fresh ideas. I wish the best for PMG and am looking forward to their future creations and to seeing this concert live.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This is the type of movie that is both painful to watch, and painful to not watch.  And when you are done watching you will just want to watch it again and again.<br /><br />This movie is stuck in a period of time that never really existed.  Combining the worst of many eras in truly entertaining ways.  Velco wallets, moon boots, hoopties, and the internet.  I constantly wondered when this movie was supposed to take place.<br /><br />The emotional connection that is made is incredible.  Everyone either knew someone like Napoleon or were Napoleon themselves.  This make you kringe at what he does, but just laugh as you can relate what he does to something you remember from your past.<br /><br />The commentary on the disc is excellent.  It is really surprising how many bizarre events throughout the film are based on actual events of the writer and director.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|Great movie, laughed all the way through it, laughed at both sides.  Puppets were great, sex scene very funny.  As for a fellow critic \\"J. Broomham \\"A Non-American\\" (UK)\\", just shut up about how this is an obvious protrayal of how the world looks at americans.  Of course some guy has to bring that up sparked by a movie with puppets.  I have traveled around to a few places around the world and I have not really seen the typical response to Americans.  What I see is the typical response to all morons.  If you are an ass, people will see you as an ass.  American, British, French, German, Chineses, and all others have asses in their own societies but they do not represent the whole culture.  People can judge how ever they want but if you are the kind of person that J. Broomham \\"A Non-American\\" (UK) is than keep your mouth shut till you and your whole country is rid of asses.  And to be childish, your monarchy sucks, they are a joke, your all a bunch of fag (cigarette) smoking whiners, the french smell and are rude, chinese still think they are the center of the universe, germans are stubborn, italians are all mobsters, and your all jealous of the US.  Sounds kind of silly and a stereotypical defense of an american, well don't take it seriouse or that guy serious.  make your own opinions, treat others as you want to be treated and respect others cultures, beliefs, and religions because no one is asking you to be the judge of all humanity.
B0002X314C|5.0|I love this album! The songs are fully realized, lush, melodic, and sort of remind me of Lauryn Hill's \\"Miseducation\\" CD. And for once, New Soul that isn't full of itself! \\"Live It Up,\\" \\"I Can Change\\" and \\"Number One\\" are awesome songs. Way to go, John Legend!
0201485672|4.0|Some of the reviews here have focused on this book as a way of learning coding techniques for refactoring. Other reviews have focused on refactoring being another term for what they have already being doing. While learning some new coding techniques might be a side effect of reading this book, the real value of this book is descibing a process and terminology for facilitating refactoring - something that many developers have done on an ad-hoc basis for years. It has been invaluable in broadening the acceptability of refactoring, an activity that was often dismissed as not being a good use of development resources time. It also gives a vocabulary for discussing refactoring rather than relying on engineers own adhoc practices. And there's probably a few refactoring techniques that won't seem obvious. <br /> <br />For C# users,  you may wish to look at NUnit.org for a .Net version of the JUnit software mentioned in the book. <br /> <br /> <br />
1400032717|5.0|I was totally blown away by this book, especially by Christopher's unique understanding of his world.    <br /> <br />The ways in which Christopher perceived his world and those things that happened to him that he couldn't possibly understand were written with incredible skill, sensitivity, and understanding.  To me, as the mother of an autistic spectrum teen, this  was the amazing value of the book.  I am never quite sure how my son sees his world or himself in it, and I gratefully found this book to be a window into how he must be thinking.   <br /> <br />I also identified closely with the struggles encountered by Christopher's parents and the obvious strain that his autistic behaviors put on their marriage.  When Christopher's father brings him home from jail, he cried.  I did, too--It's all too real.  Yet there is NO way that the reader is allowed ever to feel sorry for Christopher.  He manuvers through his world with courage and optimism.  He knows exactly what he must do, and he does it.   <br /> <br />Throughout the book it is interesting to me how Christopher describes the actions of his parents in such an adept way that the reader can clearly intuit their feelings, while Christopher was totally oblivious of what they were or what the responses meant.  <br />   <br />I am sure I will re-read this book many times and would still welcome a book of Christopher's further adventures. <br />
B000093BDX|4.0|ahhhh, what happened after track 16???  Kokomo instead of surf's up, till I die, please let me wonder?  what about don't talk (put your head on my shoulder), kiss me, baby ? where are some of my favorites?...  This hits collection is better for value than most other beach boys single-disc collections, but like most of them it picks the worst of the late-period beach boys stuff, when it could have chosen some really interesting later-period brian wilson tracks.  your best bet is this:  ask your friend who is a huge beach boys fan to make you 3 cds.  1. a pre-pet sounds best-of. 2. pet sounds 3. post-pet sounds (including smile tracks, tracks from surf's up, love you, smiley smile etc ...ok, if you really like kokomo stick that on there too...
B000002KE2|4.0|Now things start to get interesting.<br /><br />Not that the albums they had released before this were minor, or inconsequential, but you knew where they were heading in their songs. First of all, I'd like to proclaim them the true pioneers of what you hear today. I'm sorry, but no band really sounded quite like Black Sabbath in the 1970's. But the way 'they' sounded was the the direction so many bands went in 10 years later. Of all the bands I've heard coming out of the 1970's, 'Childen of the Grave' (Master of Reality - 1971) still comes out sounding 10 times meaner and heavier than anything else around.<br /><br />But between 1972 and 1975, Black Sabbath get extremely interesting, rising on each album to a height that they could barely climb again. I hate saying stuff like that, but I did, so what can you do? The 3 albums I'm speaking of are Volume 4, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, and Sabotage, which I rank as their greatest work of them all. Each album just got better in its vision, how it melded different ideas into one, and its overall message. Funny, but as the drug problems got worse, somebody's vision of the world got much much clearer in this band. (See more on that in Sabbath Bloody Sabbath review).<br /><br />Volume 4 has probably one of my all time favourite Sabbath songs, ''Supernaut''. I'd recommend the album just for that song, and I always wondered why I never heard it once on radio, while I had to endure Led Zeppelin's 'Black Dog' for the 2000th time. Radio criminally ignored Sabbath past Iron Man/Paranoid/and Sweet Leaf, and thankfully I never trusted radio to actually tell me what was good and what I needed to listen to. It's not that I don't like Iron Man/Paranoid/ or Sweet Leaf, I just wonder why there are so many songs that Sabbath did deserving of constant rotation like Zeppelin's 'Misty Mountain Hop' gets. ''Supernaut'' was one of them, as was ''Snowblind'' from the same album, Volume 4.<br /><br />What happens here on this album is that the style gets changed, and the appearance of multiple ideas in one song starts happening. Halfway through what you think is going to be the same riff repeated over and over, you get a completely different song, and then another one, all within 5 minutes or so. And you're wondering, okay, which part is the main part and which isn't? By the time they got to Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and Sabotage, they had perfected this to the point that you didn't care anymore, and the cohesiveness between different musical ideas is slicker and done with less effort. Volume 4 is where it starts, and it is a clear indication of this band's talent and its willingness to experiment.<br /><br />As said, ''Supernaut'' should have been on radio, as well as ''Snowblind''if not a good majority of these tracks. That 'Changes' has gone through two stunning revivals in its 30+ year history just says how good the song was back in its time. It was a decidely different tone to the Sabbath song, and 'Changes' by any other band would have been a radio standard. It's almost criminal how much people avoid this band, when there's every indication that they have had more influence on ''Heavy Metal'' or ''Hard Rock'' than any other band, including Zep and Purple. There are ideas on this album that you would later see Metallica, Megadeath, Slayer, Venom, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Nirvana, King's X, Tool, Soundgarden, Pantera, oh well let's just list everyone why don't we? It's not surprising that bands that gained greater commercial success (like Pearl Jam/ Stone Temple Pilots) went the Zeppelin route in their music. Lighter touch all around. Sabbath has been one of the most influential bands on a wider scale than popular success can claim in sold units.<br /><br />''Cornucopia'' and ''Wheels of Confusion'' are clear standouts as well, along with my 'second favourite' song from this album ''Tomorrow's Dream''. This album has 'riffs'' galore, they just don't stop. It's to the point that you wonder where they got them and how did they keep coming up with them? Sure it could have been something from Bach, or maybe Robert Johnson, but it was immersed in this heavy sound that sounded like no one else. They dared to play 'The Dark Chords'. Surprisingly, and not surprisingly enough, I see in most reviews it's the music being praised. For me, it has been both the music, and what Sabbath were saying lyrically that was the attraction. The music was incredibly heavy and dark, but lyrically was a different matter. I never got depressed listening to Sabbath, trust me. Nor suicidal. Not if you actually listen, and not let the 'music' instruct you to what its saying. It's two entirely different things (see Sabbath Bloody Sabbath review to see how 'Evil' Black Sabbath were)<br /><br />I think I may like Volume 4 better than Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, but not as much as Sabotage, and Never Say Die!, but does it matter? They are all incredible albums, as influential as they come, and things to be proud of should your name be Iommi, Osbourne, Butler or Ward.re they got them and how did they keep coming up with them?

B00005YW4H|5.0|i would give it 10 stars if i could. i listen to it all the time.
B0002ZEUB8|5.0|Obviously \\"The Joshua Tree\\" was U2's breakthrough album, but in retrospect I would make a case for \\"War\\" being their most pivotal work. In a word, this is the point where the lyrics catch up with the music. You can listen to \\"Boy\\" and \\"October\\" and find the sound, which in the beginning was focused on the Edge's jagged guitar riffs (\\"I Will Follow\\" is the best song from those two albums), but the lyrics are pretty much just something for Bono to do while the band plays on.<br /><br />However, when we get to \\"War,\\" things have clearly changed. If the title and the cover shot (a young boy, his lower lip bloodied, his hands locked behind his head a standard pose of submission), then the lyrics of \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" quickly settle the matter. Along with \\"New Year's Day\\" and \\"'40'\\" they place \\"The Troubles\\" at the heart of the album's gestalt. The political position they are taking vis-a-vis the sectarian strife in Northern Island is rather nebulous, but there is a potency to the music and the lyrics hitherto unfelt in U2's songs (forever captured in the music video of the group performing the song at Red Rocks). But then there is nothing wrong with offering awareness and concern rather than solutions. This is a problem that has been boiling over for centuries.<br /><br />When an artist or group makes it big, there is a tendency among their true fans (defined as those who were in on the action before the bandwagon loaded up after the big breakthrough album), to look back at one of their \\"early\\" albums with great nostaglic affection. For U2 that album would obviously have to be \\"War,\\" even with the presence of \\"Two Hearts Beat as One,\\" a song that is basically just there to dance to.
B00004R99U|2.0|Basically the movie wasn't so good as I espected it  to be .I mean the first movie was way much better I could say the Pocahontas 2 discussed me .The hole thing of the movie was that she stays with John Smith and finally she ends up running with another guy that was much more uglier than John Smith .   The cartoon is pretty well realizes the characters looked  somehow the same as the ones in the first movie but the context is very poor .So if you really want to enjoy you're Fridays don't choose Pocahontas 2 because it will leave you with a sour taste in you're mouth .
B000008HZB|4.0|A little gem of an album that is becoming increasingly rare as it spends further years inexplicably out of print.  Other reviewers got it spot on when commenting that this is definitely not ELO.  But it was never meant to be.  There is a very down to earth and back to basics feel to this very personal and intentionally self-indulgent project, clearly influenced and possibly inspired by recent collaborations with Tom Petty, Roy Orbison, George Harrison et al.  The sound that Lynne played such an integral part in creating on albums such as 'Full Moon Fever' and 'Cloud Nine', also runs through this work.  Beautifully crafted songs appear all over this rather too short masterpiece, interestingly most of which were recorded in various rooms in Lynne's very own mansion.  Although often accused of \\"over-producing\\" songs, this is not very apparent on this album, as most of the songs have an almost 'live' and intimate feel to them, perhaps because we're listening to Jeff as he is rocking away in his living room or kitchen! Other than his enormous producing expertise, Lynne's biggest asset is his astounding and unfailing voice that lends itself so effortlessly to multi-layer harmonies, to best effect on my personal favourite 'What Would It Take'.  The covers of a couple of standards detract a little from the overall direction of this album, leaving the listener a touch confused about what Lynne was trying to achieve. My personal feeling is that Jeff made this album and recorded all of the stylistically varied songs on it because he wanted to do it, which is not at all selfish or too much to ask from someone who has greatly inspired others over the years and more recently, resurrected the careers of some of his own musical heroes.
0321213351|5.0|Kerievsky has written a very useful book and I recommend that all programmers read it.  The unification of the two worlds of \\"patterns\\" and \\"refactoring\\" makes perfect sense, and I find this book an excellent companion to the GOF Design Patterns book.  While the original Design Patterns is a classic, it's presentation of finished patterns made it difficult for programmers to relate these abstract concepts to their own everyday experience.  Kerievsky addresses precisely that problem, and my only criticism would be that the source code associated with each refactoring is not available online.  Hoewever, even in the absence of digital copies of the source code the book is extremely useful, especially for the legions of programmers who must maintain legacy code from earlier systems.  An issue that every programmer faces on a daily basis to a greater or lesser degree.
B000002KIK|4.0|When I was buying Black Sabbath albums, catching up to what had happened before I found out about them (pre-Dio/Heaven & Hell), so around 1978, I bought everything, except Never Say Die!<br /><br />I think what made me stop at Technical Ecstasy (1976) was that it wasn't Sabotage (1975). I took one listen to Sabotage and thought these guys aren't just about Iron Man and War Pigs. There's so much more here, and it made Black Sabbath simply one of the most important bands I ever listened to. If you were to mention The Big 3, I would say ''Led Zep'' -- ehh Bonham & Jones are cool. ''Deep Purple'' -- I thought Glenn Hughes era was terrific, but . . . ''Black Sabbath'' --- aahhh now you're talking. They just nailed it as far as I was concerned, and from Master of Reality to Sabotage they were just hitting benchmark after benchmark.<br /><br />And then I bought Technical Ecstasy, loved the cover, wasn't knocked out by the songs, except for 'Dirty Women' and 'All Moving Parts&lt;Stand Still>'. So I never bought Never Say Die! because I read critical and fan reaction to it as not worth it, so I just avoided it.<br /><br />Then in 1991 I had a friend who lent me the album, and he was shocked that I hadn't heard it and me saying I was a 'Black Sabbath Fan'. Never Say Die! blows Technical Ecstasy away easily. I mean, get Technical Ecstasy, I don't want you to stay away from it, but Never Say Die! surprised me as to how good it actually was. It became my 'second favourite' Black Sabbath album after Sabotage, it really is that good.<br /><br />I guess it depends on what you're looking for. If you want ''Iron Man'', well its not here, but I didn't find Iron Man on Sabotage either, which is I guess why Technical Ecstasy was such a 'bring-down' for lack of a better term. Sabotage was an altogether different album, and when you start going in that direction, it's hard to top it. Never Say Die! is a very good attempt at getting back on creative track, and I can't think of a song I do not like on this album. In fact, I play the title track much less than the others! To me, it was the ''safest'' song on there because you get songs like 'Johnny Blade'' which is simply one of the best Ozzy/era Black Sabbath songs out there. My favourite track from this album, and it made me wonder why I waited nearly 12 years to actually buy this album. I missed 12 years of enjoying 'Johnny Blade'.<br /><br />I see a lot of complaints about 'Breakout/Swinging The Chain' but honestly I thought this was just such a surprising style for Black Sabbath to be doing. I had this one on REPEAT> for quite some time, never quite figuring out if it actually was Ozzy singing it. Now I know it wasn't, but it was fun figuring it out!B/STC has to be for me 2 standouts of Never Say Die!<br /><br />This whole album really is something you just have to hear, forgetting what your expectations from their other albums says they should be doing, or what you'll expect to hear next. It's varied, creative, interesting, and it is in no way a poor effort on their part. I don't get any feeling of 'if they had stuck with Ozzy where would they have gone next . . . '' because I'm quite happy he went to form his own band. And when that all went down, I went in his direction, buying Blizzard Of Ozz albums like I had bought Black Sabbath albums. I was familiar with Ronnie James Dio from Rainbow days, and to be honest, I was very much on the Ozzy side of the argument :). Never Say Die! is a great way to end the Ozzy era, on an inventive peak, taking chances, and writing some great songs.<br /><br />I'm very surprised 'A Hard Road' isn't a staple of American radio, its got all the signature hooks of those 'classic' songs that get played endlessly on FM stations. It's almost the Sabbath anthem by default. When I first heard it, I wondered why I hadn't heard it at least once before. But it seems like the mainstream totally avoids this album, when really it deserves to be heard. ''Over To You'' and ''Junior's Eyes' just don't disappoint what is overall a strong album.<br /><br />I was glad I heard Never Say Die! finally, and put any doubt to rest about its worthiness. It's no. 2 on my Top Black Sabbath albums.You'' and ''Junior's Eyes' just don't disappoint what is overall a strong album.  <br /> <br />I was glad I heard Never Say Die! finally, and put any doubt to rest about its worthiness. It's no. 2 on my Top Black Sabbath albums.
B0002IU988|3.0|Below is my original review...I've had the CD for awhile now and I am bumping up my rating to a 4 (although for some reason the editing function won't let me add a star).  My first run through I was a bit disappointed because I thought the music sounded too much like Creed.  Now,(again) I LIKE CREED, but I was hoping for a new sound.  After listening more, I am finding that the band is not nearly as much like Creed as I originally stated.  I know a LOT of Creed fans are still really bummed out that they broke up, but take it from a former Soundgarden fan, musicians can go their separate ways and still make good music!  It takes some adjusting, granted, but truly gifted artists can collaborate in new, albeit different ways and create something just as nice, or even better.    So give it time, and see if it grows...I did and I'm glad!  -------------------------------------------    The first song on the album--Find the Real--is GREAT!  It is the reason I purchased the CD.  Myles Kennedy is one of the best vocalists around (and I had never heard of him before this CD).  However, the rest of the CD (with maybe the last song as an exception) sounds too much like Creed.  It is not that I dislike Creed, but I don't think the former members of Creed in the band have taken advantage of the great opportunity they have been given with this vocalist.      I think Audioslave is the perfect example of what they should strive for--an outstanding vocalist forged with another band who lost their vocalist that now sound very little like their former bands.      I would really like to give this band more of a chance, given the awesomeness of \\"Find the Real\\" which shows the incredible potential this band has to become really good.  Work harder on finding a new sound that is less like Creed and more focused on Myles Kennedy's outstanding vocal abilities.
B000003FPN|5.0|RCA has a vast and incredible library of classical music recordings, particularly in its LIVING STEREO series, and over the years has re-released some of its great titles. One of the more popular and enduring recordings in this series is Fritz Reiner's recording of Dvorak's Ninth Symphony with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. People familiar with the LP version will instantly recognize it distinctive cover with a photograph of the Statue of Liberty, the same monument which would have greeted Dvorak when he first visited the United States and where he was inspired to write this great work.<br /><br />The showpiece of the recording is Dvorak's 9th. Recorded in 1957, the orchestra has a hearty sound. Both Reiner and the orchestra seem familiar with the work. Reiner moves the work along, and is particularly vigorous in his conducting of the fourth movement, which may not be to everyone's liking, but works well with this recording. The CD also contains three other works that are in keeping with Dvorak's 9th. Two are overtures: a robust version of Dvorak's \\"Carnival Overture,\\" and a lively recording of Smetena's overture to \\"The Bartered Bride.\\" The third piece is Weinberger's Polka and Fugue from \\"Schwanda the Bagpiper.\\" Interestingly, while he conducts the Dvorak's pieces with energy, the Weinberger piece, while conducted and performed beautifully, is a bit slower paced than other recordings of the work.<br /><br />One bonus of the re-release of the \\"Living Stereo\\" recordings is that they contain the original liner notes from the LP. Since this CD is a compilation from two different LP's, the liner notes from both are included in this set. RCA has not re-released as many of the titles as they promised ten years ago when they first opened the vaults. Let's hope some of the other great titles will be released in the near future.
B00005JN2Z|3.0|***************contains spoilers**************** <br /> <br />Great action, up until about the final third of the film...when it degenerates into nonsense. <br /> <br />Cruise is the infallible hitman, nailing his victims even in a crowded nightclub crawling with feds, cops and bodyguards. <br /> <br />Foxx is a sensitive, mild-mannered cabbie, definitely not an action hero. Hijacked by Cruise, he does a bunch of soul searching...until he gets fed up. This is where the film starts to lose it. <br /> <br />He deliberately flips the cab at high speed. The cab is totalled; neither Foxx nor Cruise so much as sprain an ankle. <br /> <br />An LAPD cop arriving at the scene finds a reason to regard Foxx a violent, dangerous criminal. Cabbie is on the ground, just about cuffed...and the next instant, it is the cop in the cuffs, and the apologetic cabbie has the gun. <br /> <br />Cabbie continues to go superhuman. <br /> <br />Does not seem to know how to use the gun, but that does not stop cabbie from zooming up the builing and getting the drop on infallible hitman. Not only does he get the drop--naturally the same instant hitman lines up on his last target, the damsel--but this cabbie that does not know how to use a gun drops the hitman with a single head shot from across the room. <br /> <br />Not the end, though; gets worse instead. <br /> <br />Hitman not dead. Chase ensues. <br /> <br />Final faceoff: the hitman that can precision nail running targets fifty yards away in the dark empties a full clip at the cabbie in a face-to-face standoff, with the cabbie and the damsel trapped in the narrow compartment at the end of a subway car. Shooting fish in a barrel, you say? The cabbie, and the damsel, walk away without a scratch! <br /> <br />With a different ending, would have been a great movie!

B00014TJ6Q|5.0|The typical thing you get with a George Harrison album is it being compared to All Things Must Pass.<br /><br />An ironic thing you get is that with almost every major release since All Things Must Pass, critics and fans have said xxx album is his best work since All Things Must Pass.<br /><br />And when you have a majority of your solo work being compared to what is considered your finest offering, it suggests something. Well, it suggests a few things. One thing being that maybe critics and fans are amazingly forgetful about what they said for a previous album. The other thing, the much more ironic thing, is that Harrison's solo career was filled with high watermarks over a longer time period than his former partners. It means that for almost every album he released after All Things Must Pass, the 'reaction' to it compared it to his 'finest' work. And that is an amazing track record. Considering that all of his albums in the US were never below the Top 20 (barring ''Gone Troppo'' - which had no promotion whatsoever), is another testament to this man's track record.<br /><br />So if Living in the Material World, Thirty Three & 1/3rd, George Harrison, Cloud 9 and Brainwashed were all ''the best album he released since All Things Must Pass'', it must mean this composer did far better than his partners, correct? Because in ''units sold'' All Things Must Pass outsold Lennon and McCartney's first solo albums put together (Plastic Ono Band / McCartney 1). And I don't think other albums by Lennon or McCartney are compared to 'Imagine' or 'Band On The Run' with as much a success rate as far as ''reaction'' or that person working to their best abilities. What I mean to say is, reaction to London Town or Mind Games isn't the same as , the best album since All Things Must Pass, when the watermark SET by All Things Must Pass is so high. Maybe some would say its overrated. But how can the most underrated composer, in the most overrated band, have an overrated album. Shouldn't it make him come out about 'even'? Or just right?<br /><br />Well, that's the ''ironic'' stuff done.<br /><br />The remastered ''George Harrison'' was a long time in coming, this title being off the shelves for years. Though I am not particularly fond of the remasters, I am gratefully happy that they are anywhere in the retail market at all. You have to count the blessings as they come, and Olivia Harrison's involvement in getting these back out there will never be slighted by me. Though I was disappointed by the sound quality (particularly Thirty Three & 1/3rd), I still say not enough of the world owns a George Harrison album in their collection, so please start somewhere. Anywhere. Even here.<br /><br />There are some beautiful pieces of music on this album, remastered or not. And I think there is material on here that rivals his ''best'' work with The Beatles. One being, 'Your Love Is Forever', which could have been 1979's 'Something'. It's a beautiful song, and the craftsmanship of the guitar work is sublime. Harrison's chord construction leaves his partners behind, I mean, he ''was'' their guitarist. This album also features a beautiful spanish guitar solo on ''Dark Sweet Lady'', dedicated to his wife Olivia. The playing is understated, simple, but full of how great a guitar player he was, even though he'd probably disagree. I've seen guitar solos played by a lot of people, and its very rare that someone gets a George Harrison guitar solo 'right'. It was probably his few years of training with Ravi Shankar on Sitar (he was the only Beatle who could write and read music -- Indian Music) that got some of the unusual bends and pulls he coaxed out of his solos.<br /><br />I remember getting this album on vinyl when it came out, and it still sounds great in whatever format you so choose. You can't really mess up this album too much, because Harrison's albums were recorded very well, mainly by his longtime associate Phil McDonald (he engineered every Harrison solo album from ATMP until Gone Troppo, or in some capacity), and when you compare the sound quality of Harrison's 70's output to his partners (Lennon & McCartney), the differences are quite amazing. (One exception is Paul McCartney's Back To The Egg, but this was engineered by Phil McDonald! Though RAM sounds very good.) Ringo's albums have the same recording quality, near perfect.<br /><br />This has always been one of my favourites of George's albums. Each song is crafted meticulously, lyrically it is as upbeat as one can be when mentioning the forces of Yin and Yang. It resurrects the criminally 'not used' Not Guilty from 1968, in a far jazzier tone, and no matter what anyone says about Harrison's vocal range, he meant what he sang, and has a far more emotive quality than someone singing goo goo g'joob.

Each song is crafted meticulously, lyrically it is as upbeat as one can be when mentioning the forces of Yin and Yang. It resurrects the criminally 'not used' Not Guilty from 1968, in a far jazzier tone, and no matter what anyone says about Harrison's vocal range, he meant what he sang, and has a far more emotive quality than someone singing goo goo g'joob.

0786869143|4.0|All right, this book is as I read someone saying above \\"no hocus pocus\\". The COLD fact is there is no psychic crap interferring with tachyons and stuff so that this makes you a lucky or unlucky person. If you believe that (like I think some of the commenters do) then DON'T bother buying this book, try instead some psychokinesis crap and spend the rest of your life trying jedi tricks (btw, to the REALISTIC reader I'd like to point to the Skeptic's Dictionnary, to which WISEMAN did a small contribution AGAINST frauds) <br /> <br />So let's get back to the book. First, what's being lucky? Of course there is no OBJECTIVE measure to \\"luck\\". How could there be, since its something one does or doesn't believe! So who is lucky? Or better yet, WHAT is lucky? What is a \\"lucky\\" event today may turn out to be the worst thing happening ever! Remember chaos theory? <br /> <br />So in essence, the point in that book is that YOU CREATE your own luck. What he does is to test \\"lucky\\" and \\"unlucky\\" people (by self-definition) with different classic psychology tests, and from the results tries to dictate some general characteristics. <br /> <br />As I say, it is about YOURSELF. You are the only one to blame for your bad luck (or indeed to congratulate for your good luck!). Let's squarely face it, if you are the kind of person that says \\"Oh Why me? I am doomed, I am sourrounded with bad karma, i surely deserve this from being a tyran in a previous life!\\" then you surely deserve it just for being such a jerk!  <br /> <br />So, a good book, a book that tells the things as they are. There is no magic. There are no people blessed. We all step into chances, whereas many of us just dont know how to handle them. This book is an honest book, and the results are honest, straight-forward results, that if followed MAY change your attitude towards lucky breaks (if you like to believe things blindly then again this is not a book for you) <br /> <br />Cheerio
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|Good adaptation of Steinbeck's superb novel.  The Joad family were farmers in Oklahoma (referred to as Okies) during the \\"Dust Bowl\\" years when drought caused a lot of farmers to lose everything.   <br /> <br />There are promised work in California and pack up their dilapadated truck with their family including the grandmother (I wonder if the idea for The Beverly Hillbillies came from this) and have a grueling trip there.  When they arrive they are treated like \\"slaves,\\" not even paid enough to buy food.   <br /> <br />This was probably Fonda's best role as the noble Tom Joad.  John Carridine is also excellent in a supporting role. <br /> <br />This film is historical and an important statement on how corruption lead to the formation of unions and workers rights!

B00005JNDZ|4.0|First of all, this movie has been unfairly (I feel) panned by almost every reviewer out there. However, if you check closely you'll note that practically ALL of them are male.  <br />And, frankly, they just don't get it. <br />Bridget Jones is a woman's heroine. Yes, she falls, trips, says the wrong thing at the wrong time, and worries constantly about her weight,...but who doesn't? <br />This film picks up where Bridget Jones's Diary left off; Bridget (Renee Zellwieger)is happily in a relationship with the lovely Mark Darcy (Colin Firth), and trying to figure out how to keep it going strong despite the obvious differences in their careers, backgrounds and general dispositions.  <br />Yes, she's insecure and quick to jump to conclusions, but on the whole, I thought the writers handled her (and his) reactions very well.  <br />In the middle of all this angst comes Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant), who hasn't changed a bit despite his promise to having been reformed. As luck would have it he's now working at the same TV station as Bridget, and as double luck would have it Mark Darcy has a new, beautiful assistant. <br />So here we have the basic premise which, of course equals many potential problems.  <br />Some of the slapstick does get a bit out there, such as her jumping from an airplane right into a pig pen (what's the chances of that happening I wonder?), or when she slides off of Mark's roof and suffers nothing worse than some plantlife stuck in her hair. But, all in all, these are two of the most irresistable characters in movies today, and I personally find all of this worry and insecurity rather...well, sexy. <br />By the way, as much as some other reviewers have obsessed on Bridget's weight, and been most insulting to the rest of us while doing it (you mean a woman who's not a perfect size 5 can't be loved?), I thought she looked very good. Even at 130 lbs., she displays a curvaciousness that up until the last thirty years would have been considered the norm andnot just \\"fat\\". <br />The other point I'd like to make is that contrary to those reviewers who said that Daniel was not even in the 2nd book, check again. Although his part is small, he not only IS included, he gets punched in the mouth by our dear Darcy (well done, Mark!).  <br />All in all, I found this movie delightful, and am anticipating the DVD with high hopes. <br /> <br />
B000002KFJ|5.0|This is quite simply, my favourite of the 1970's Black Sabbath albums. It will show up easily in my top 10 desert island discs without a bat of an eye. This is the album that made me say Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple had no claim on Heavy Metal quite like Black Sabbath, and the influence of this band on modern rock is literally undeniable.<br /><br />But why do I love Sabotage so much?<br /><br />One reason is because of the ''obsessed'' loop that is in the song ''Megalomania''. You're never sure if it's obsessed, or sessedob. When I heard this as a kid, my first thought wasn't, wow that's weird. It was how did they do that? And that's the impression that has always been left by Sabotage on me. It is an immensely creative album, no matter how many drugs or things were happening in the Sabbath world, Sabotage is the work of pure creativity in the Black Sabbath catalogue. Sabbath Bloody Sabbath (1973) gave an indication of this direction, but Sabotage steps it up about 3 notches from there. To me, it is quite factually, their greatest album.<br /><br />One thing that has always bothered me about the perception of Black Sabbath is the lyrical interpretation of their work by the public. If you have ever read any of their lyrics, truthfully, you will find this band was no darker than Bugs Bunny. Sorry to ruin any ''image'' they may have, but on Sabotage, Master of Reality, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and Volume 4, the lyrics are quite spiritually inclined. They embrace a wider perspective of what life's about. They deal with reincarnation, the journey of the soul, material pleasures and pitfalls. Honest, I'm not making this up! Black Sabbath had to be the most self-empowering, know thyself bands of that era. Which is what disturbs me about their demonic association, because to me, these guys made sense. And lyrically they never prompted me to go shooting anyone, or to worship the Devil. These guys were so anti-AntiChrist it was funny. ''And God is the only way to love....''. You figure with all the 60's idealism they sought to crush with their heavier music, the message they still put in lyrically was one of intelligence and the pursuit to be 'free'.<br />Read the lyrics sometime . . . . . . ..<br /><br />One of the scariest moments I can remember is hearing ''The Writ'' for the first time. And as others have said, make sure you don't get a version where ''Am I Going Insane&lt;Radio>'' is after it. It's one of the worst howls I think I've ever heard, and I'm not sure if its a baby's cry slowed down, or an adult. Either way, it's creepy. The song itself just doesn't relent, and is really the highlight of this album. ''The Writ'' Iommi, Osbourne, Butler & Ward should be proud of.<br /><br />''Symptom of the Universe'', to me, has always been one of the first start points of Thrash Metal. If that song in 1975 didn't sound ten times different than what else was going on, then maybe I just don't have my history right. But I hear every Metallica/Megadeath/Slayer idea being born right from this track. That it ends with one of the nicest pieces of Black Sabbath music put to wax/plastic maybe stops it from getting its due, or its rightful place as a groundbreaking piece of music that doesn't sound out of place 20 or 30 years later. The beginning of ''Symptom . . . '' is thrash. It's the heaviest thing I've heard so far coming out of 1975, until 10 years later.<br />It makes the ''Immigrant Song'' sound like a pony ride. ''Symptom of the Universe'' sounds like your driving a steel tank from the lands of the ice and snow  ;)<br /><br />Another favourite is 'The Thrill of It All'. I think for a long time it has been my favourite track from this whole album. One thing you rarely hear about Black Sabbath, is how ''groovy'' they could be. Rhythmically, these guys were just leagues ahead of their contemporaries. ''Lord of This World'' from Master of Reality is an example from earlier recordings, but The Thrill of It All is just funky. In a Black Sabbathkind of way. I don't know why newer bands bother, because Black Sabbath has already been there, done that, etc.......<br /><br />Am I Going Insane&lt;Radio> is obviously people's least favourite track, and to me it sounds like a continuation of 'Who Are You' from Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, but I don't mind the song, because it leads directly into The Writ!<br /><br />There's really too much going on on this album to comment fully on what I consider to be Black Sabbath's masterpiece. But it will always be the album I recommend to anyone just figuring out Black Sabbath are worth checking out.use Black Sabbath has already been there, done that, etc.......

0440539811|5.0|First, let it be said that the Illuminatus! Trilogy is not an easy book for anyone to read unless they are familiar with the philosophy of Robert Anton Wilson.  Anyone who wants to read this book should first read at the very least Prometheus Rising and Cosmic Trigger I beforehand.  A familiarity with the concepts of Aleister Crowley, Georges Gurdjieff, Tim Leary, etc., would also be advisable.  That said, here's the review.<br /><br />The Illuminatus! Trilogy is a combination of philosophy, science, occultism, and obscure ideas that is unlike anything I have read before.  It's also a wonderful combination of fact and fiction, so the wise reader will enter with a skeptical but open mind.  I say skeptical because they should not BELIEVE any of the novel, but they should be open to ideas because the novel will appall them otherwise.  I guess you could actually say that being skeptical but open is the whole point of RAW's philosophy.<br /><br />The review from Rolling Stone on the page of reviews on the first page describes the novel as a \\"shaggy dog joke,\\" and you won't really understand how true that is until you read the book.  The basic storyline is the storyline that has been repeated throughout mythology and history: \\"good versus evil.\\"  Of course, being a RAW novel, sides get flipped and everybody seems to be a secret agent working for twenty four different conspiracies.  It can basically be described as very funny and blasphemous in the best possible sense.  Your basic view of \\"reality\\" will probably not survive this book.<br /><br />And, as a word to the wise (or the foolish), don't buy the paperback version of Illuminatus! that is available these days.  Get a hardback copy; an 800 page paperback gets destroyed fairly easily, as I've come to find out.
0792845730|4.0|Along with the Terminator this was the best scifi action film to come out during the 1980's.  Though Peter Weller didn't become a household name, he does an excellent job as a murdered police officer, who is resurrected as a type of cyborg programmed to fight crime.  As \\"Robocop\\" he dispenses justice with computer controlled pinpoint shooting accuracy.<br /><br />There is a lot of camp (some of it is extremely funny) which does nothing to diminish the serious drama of the film.  Nancy Allen does a good job as Robocop's partner and look for the guy from That 70's Show as the evil villian.

068987474X|5.0|Incredible book!  Every bad relationship that I justified with some excuse was practically given as an example in \\"He's Just Not That Into You\\".  The ones that were not ready for marriage with me were ready a short time later with someone else. The one that was so \\"madly in love with me\\" but never had time; made time when he eventually fell in love with another. I was in love with my ex for nine years, and every year he had a new excuse. This book helped me to look at that relationship and see that his words would never match his actions, so my words were \\"Goodbye.\\" A few months later I did find someone that called, had time and made a commitment.  My heart goes out to all my sisters that have suffered though someone that wasn't that into you.
B000002KET|5.0|With its cover image, one would expect to be led into some dark, abysmal, terrifying journey. Flip to the back cover, and everything is serene and 'heavenly', yet all the same people are intact and present. ''What's going on here,'' you say? Are these people intrinsically evil or are they good? Is the hell image truly how things are, and the heaven is what it's supposed to be like? On the inside cover, which was gatefold, there was the image of the band (Iommi/Osbourne/Butler/Ward) guarding a bed, like on the front cover, like spirits, warding off some bad karma or energy. It was all very weird.<br /><br />And you haven't even heard the songs yet!<br /><br />And what you get lyrically is the Black Sabbath manifesto. There is so much on here about 'heaven' and what 'hell' is made of it, that I am so surprised that they get the tag 'Evil'. No, what they are is quite knowledgable and self-empowering. What they are is quite critical of people who fill your head all full of lies. There are some amazing lyrics on this album, that totally go against what someone would have you believe Black Sabbath stood for. Devils and Demons. As if.......<br /><br />If you didn't tell someone it was Black Sabbath, and printed the lyrics out, you'd be surprised at what answers you would get as to what was being said. Put the Black Sabbath 'tag' back in, and a preconception enters the head. ''Don't believe the life you have will be the only one, You have to let your body sleep, to let your soul live on'' - yea thats evil alright. Sheesh - get out my beads and incense, I'm in danger of being 'possessed'. Woooo-oooo-oooooo-oooooo. The whole album lyrically is like this, in direct contradiction to Black Sabbath's perceived image as Satan's Minstrels.<br /><br />So how best to approach it? Do you take Sabbath Bloody Sabbath as an indictment of everything Evil, or some sort of give up hope, all is lost tome? I don't think it can be summed up even remotely as easy as that, because there's so much on this album just in its music alone. The end section of Sabbath Bloody Sabbath (the title track) is one of the heaviest sounds of 1973. I mean it is just dark. The mid-section where the insistence is that no one here will help you, you're on your own even when you ask for help, is musically melancholy and so out of keeping with how this song ends. It actually ends angry, as if what came before it has totally frustrated it and it wants to get that out. The title track alone is worth admission, just for its many moods, and its kick*** ending. Ten times heavier than Zep or Purple. On any day.<br /><br />''A National Acrobat'' has always been my favourite song on SBS. It's Sabbath 'Funk'. Heavy style. And Osbourne's vocal is literally quite amazing. ''Just remember love is life, and hate is living death'', o my God these guys are so evil! They reek of it. I'm not sure what a national acrobat is, but I just love how the title has nothing to do with the song, and if you heard it on the radio (as if) you'd be left wondering what the hell is that song called? It'd be one of those songs the DJ never said the name of after it was done, and you'd have to buy 18 Black Sabbath albums just to find the song that goes, ''dada da da, dadadadadda da da .. I am the world that hides the universal secret of time . . . '' Did I tell you how Evil these guys were?<br /><br />''Sabbra Cadabra's'' Ozzy vocal is another standout, and boasts the great Piano/synthesiser work of ex-Yes member (at this point) Rick Wakeman. A simple song about loving a lady a lot, it's the vocal that sends the song past that, one of Ozzy's best moments.<br /><br />''Killing Yourself To Live'' became 'the song' from this album, or the one people immediately think of. Sorry if I've skipped ''Fluff'', and it is a pretty song, but we'll just deal with the non-instrumental tracks. Black Sabbath dared suggest that the world was not meant for pain, suffering or misery on 'Killing Yourself . . . '', and I'm hard-pressed not to believe them.<br /><br />''Who Are You'' I just enjoy simply for the pleasure of hearing such a heavy track employing synthesisers to do the work. It's something quite different, but don't let anyone tell you Black Sabbath weren't experimental before this. They were a very experimental band beyond Iron Man. 'Planet Caravan' was an indication of this, as was everything off of Volume 4 (1972). In fact, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath just improves on Volume 4's direction, by adding more cohesion to the multiple songs in one format. And far more interesting than 'Band on the Run'. And Sabotage(1975) just nails it.<br /><br />''Looking For Today'' is an in your face indictment of 'the music business', and the temporary nature of it all, and how futile it all is. Not only of the music business, but of popular culture in general. Sabbath aren't the first to cover this ground, and another great indictment is Ray Davies (The Kinks) 'Top of the Pops' from Lola Vs. Powerman & The Moneygoround(1970), but rarely does it get so summed up lyrically as well. Another great example is Andy Partridge's (XTC)  ''Travels In Nihilon'', and Tool's ''Hooker With a P****'<br /><br />And actually its funny now that I think of it. The same year this came out, was the same year as George Harrison's ''Living in the Material World'', and looking lyrically at both of them, they cover the same subject matter in the songs, but one gets labelled 'preachy' and one gets labelled 'Devil worship', that its no wonder that George Harrison and Black Sabbath were such an influence on me as a person, and how I looked at the world around me. They seem so at odds with eachother stylistically, personally, musically, but I see them saying quite the same things about Life on Earth as we know it. You may not see the 'link', but I see no difference really in what these people were saying about our time here.<br /><br />''Spiral Architect'' could be just be a kazoo player, I wouldn't care, because i just love the title of the song alone.<br /><br />Has anyone noticed ''Fluff' is just that? Fluff? I thought these guys were evil!nd I'm hard-pressed not to believe them.  <br /> <br />''Who Are You'' I just enjoy simply for the pleasure of hearing such a heavy track employing synthesisers to do the work.

B000002KDX|4.0|I recently attended an America concert, they perform 130 concerts a year throughout the world. The quality of the performance and versatility of the band was impressive. The audience included the young and old. Yes, some of their music is a too sweet for some, but the raw and basic songs of the early years are classic and timeless. When I met Dewey Bunnell I told him that ' A Horse with No Name' has immortalized their band, not too mention many other great songs like 'Tin Man', Ventura Highway', etc. Turn on the radio for awhile and then listen to America, that may help you appreciate these song masters.

I definitely recommend reading that book if you \\"don't get\\" the Sex Pistols. <br /> <br />Anyway, yes... this is one of the first and best punk albums ever. Oh, and it's their only LP, so don't be fooled into buying 10 different \\"Sex Pistols\\" LPs. There are singles, but I haven't put the time and energy into tracking them down and verifying them as actual Sex Pistols songs. <br /> <br />Lastly, if this lone LP leaves you wanting more intelligent punk, I'd recommend checking out the likes of Operation Ivy, Bad Religion and the Dead Kennedys (in no particular order).
B00003CY5K|4.0|Yes even with all the stereotypes about blondes and their love of fashion the movie moves at a good pace and has a great story line.

B0006IIPIK|4.0|Sky Captain was a treat to watch for me.  I am a huge movie buff and am often very critical of films because quite frankly I have annoyingly strict tastes.  Sci Fi is a difficult genre for me because of the \\"cheese\\" factor.  You find this in blockbusters like Chronicles of Riddick or other mid range sci fi flicks.  You know the ones I am talking about.  Decent budget films with heavy special effects, maybe one known cardboard actor and an unknown female willing to bare skin.  Sky Captain luckily avoided these stereotypes by creating a unique, comic book like world and a rock solid cast. <br />   <br />  The exact story line is pretty much a tried and true Bond (007) like story of a maniacle mastermind hellbent on ridding the world of all social ills by \\"cleansing\\" or destroying it.  Here we have the out of touch scientist playing Noah as he scrambles to re-start society as God had in Genesis of the Old Testament.  To carry out the plot line the story is nicely done and not too difficult for the average viewer to follow but intricate enough to keep hardcores happy.  The downside to the plot for me was that the producers really did not have the time in a major motion picture to develope the story more efficiently.  In other words to keep the film rolling and exciting you (the viewer) may feel you are being wisked through the story on a rollercoaster as events happen extremely fast and often with very little to no explanation.  Also the story is interupted by numerous and sometimes baffling or unnecesarry action sequences. <br /> <br />  The quality of the production however was extremely good.  The use of Blue screen filming for an all CGI background film was not cheesy or campy as some might expect.  In fact it creates a unique atmosphere to this fantasy setting.  I especially like the 1920's atmosphere with a futuristic twinge. <br /> <br />  The casting was well researched with most characters adequately placed and performed nicely.  The only exception I would gripe with is that of the female lead or Gweneth Paltrow.  Usually a fine actress heralded for past performances she seemed too rigid and out of place in this film.  Many of her lines were delivered with such a lack of emotion she seemed to be a robot.  Quite ironic since the film is full of robots but sadly they seem to have more personality than Paltrow could give her character.  She obviously was cast for her name and star power and the role probably would have been better suited for someone with a bit more flair as one would stereotype in a comic book journalist.  Beyond that gripe the cast performed very well. <br /> <br />  Overall Sky Captain was simply a fun film to watch.  Die hard sci fi and Anime fans will enjoy the film as a basic action filled adventure but will probably want more from the story.  Overall I think had this film been a trilogy or a TV mini series it would have been more free to explore the story and develope the plot lines more adequately.

B00025ETIW|5.0|Sometimes you get a little tired of the same crap over and over again. I was looking for something outside the emo-screamo genre and found My Chemical Romance. It was almost a breathe of fresh air to find a band with such intensity and originality like these guys. Some may find their lyrics a little too \\"gothy\\" for them and i was trying to steer clear of that crap myself, but this band is a major exception. Try \\"Helena,\\" \\"The Ghost of You,\\" and \\"Thank You for the Venom.\\" It'll knock you flat on your ass.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|It's about time someone came up with a movie that accurately portrays nerds with all their quirks and qualities.  Who is the first person to sincerely greet a new student?  A nerd.  Who will risk his last scrap of dignity to defend his friend's honor?  A nerd.  And who, other than a nerd, can possibly have a life that, without forced plots and fancy filming, is interesting enough to sell?<br /><br />Napoleon Dynamite makes us laugh because the producers very accurately capture an underappreciated subculture--the subculture that is at best disregarded and at worst supressed daily in American high schools.  Nerds.  They have an excessive fixation with all things medieval and fantastic.  They combine fashions from different decades in one mismatched ensemble.  They retain their passion for youthful entertainment.  I don't think we're laughing at Napoleon Dynamite in mockery, rather we laugh because we recognize in him someone we know who we're appreciating for the first time.<br /><br />True there's not much plot in this movie.  But there are only so many plot lines in the world, and we've seen them all, so who cares?  The tone of the production is lighthearted, not cynical; it captures every aspect of nerdiness, without prompting us to scorn the characters.  And what sets Napoleon Dynamite apart from all other movies is the lack of sex, violence, and foul language.  It's a good, guilt-free laugh.
B0001CCXGG|4.0|I loved this album as a Satriani fan. Vodoo Child was very unique to listen to. This is an audio CD of three unusual men, but you need to see how they play it on stage, so if I didn't get it as a present I'd defenitley buy the DVD to see them on stage...Prefer DVD
B0000067L4|4.0|Most people could feel cheated when buying this album, since it is only 1/2 hour of music. One track is a throwaway, probably their worst song ever (that scrpayard thing). Yet, if you are interested in the Cream or Clapton, you need this album. It includes one of Clapton best composotions of his career (Badge) and some of Clapton best live performances ever. Eddie Van Halen selected this version of 'I am so glad' as his all time favourite solo.
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|The story involves our hero \\"Jason Bourne\\" (Matt Damon) who has, in the previous movie, rediscovered after a bout of amnesia that he is a highly trained American asassin who was involved in illegal and unsanctioned covert activities. He has since moved \\"off the grid\\" with his loyal lady friend, trying to figure himself out in Goa, India. When someone shows up trying to kill him, the ball gets rolling and our story unfolds. It turns out that his existence is being used by other unsavory sorts in the CIA to cover some dirty deed of their own (it links back to the previous movie...sort of). The movie bears close watching as the plot is, well, convoluted. Our hero has flashbacks, a guilt complex, and some epic deadly moves including the construction of a toaster bomb (\\"We heard you had amnesia.\\" \\"You still should have moved\\"). The movie careens to an exhausting climactic chase scene through Moscow which is truly an edge of your seat event.<br /><br />Yes, the camera action is perhaps most kindly described as \\"lively\\". It didn't bother me at all and in fact added to the paranoid sense that I got from this, and it helped to keep me unsettled. In fact, I saw this movie first and found the original movie \\"The Bourne Identity\\" dull by comparison.
6304493681|4.0|alot has been said and written about this great anime film.you know why ? because it diserves it.and all the good reviews  you heard about it are true.so go a head,buy it. <br />full of amazing and unforgettable scenes .like the one after the opening credits when motoko wakes up in her apartment.took my breath away .in a story about cyborgs questioning their humanity,and  a virus trying to become one. <br />the dvd features are your typical making of video and trailers .there is also a production report and a guide to ghost in the shell.you have to read them though. <br />like akira, the plot isn't that great,but you can't resist watching the film. <br />great anime.average dvd. <br />unrated.suggested 17. means R rated then.alot of artistic nudity.
B000002OZY|5.0|This wonderful tale of a young deaf, dumb, and blind kid's treck to be saved is a classic. Told through the sound of excellent rock music. This has stood the test of time and will always be one of the best albums ever made.
B0006IIKS0|5.0|Metallica are one of those kind of bands that if you grew up with them during the 80's, they were practically your idols, big heavy music but without just being heavy for the sake of it. Then the 90's came, and despite having some really good songs and James Hetfield emerging to be a formidable lyricist and vocalist, people started to hate the band for their stylistic change. When news broke that they were working on a heavier release, fans got excited. Then the album dropped. Piss poor production and only a few good songs which were just riffs riffs riffs all the way through. The DVD takes a look at the making of St. Anger. <br /> <br />On the IGN review of the disc, they mentioned that it's hard to like St. Anger after watching the film and I agree. The film shows infighting and looking to the future thinking there wouldn't be a Metallica anymore. It's like this record had to be made, regardless of what happened to the band emotionally, yet it's still a bad record.  <br /> <br />I could almost call this a sequel to This is Spinal Tap. If that film showed the inner workings of the industry and what happens when outside influences affect the band, this film shows what happens to bands when they're not on stage or hamming it up for the camera in videos. They fight, swear at each other and yell.   <br /> <br />What really sells this film though is the sincerity and honesty. Scenes which could make you hate a member(personally, the thought of James Hetfield, a brutally fast guitar player and great rhythm guitarist going bear hunting and getting drunk instead of a birthday party for his own kid is downright unacceptable to me) or even seeing the same guy, all tattooed and whatnot at his daughter's ballet recital may seem un-metal like but they kept it in anyway. <br /> <br />As for other highlights, one particular standout is when Lars and Dave Mustaine, former Metallica member and current Megadeth frontman, have a chat little while after September 11th and you can tellDave is still bitter about being booted for his addictions. It's like the success and great songs he brought with Megadeth don't mean a thing because he got ousted by Metallica. <br /> <br />All in all, at 2 and a half hours, it could be a hard digest but you'll laugh and might even learn a thing or 2 about the band, which is the point, no?
0385510454|4.0|Joel Backman is the Broker.  After wielding his power in Washington DC for some years, he goes to federal prison to serve a twenty year term.  The outgoing President grants numerous pardons creating a suspicion of  \\"pardons for cash\\" and unexpectedly grants a pardon to Backman.  So after six years in prison Backman is released from prison but is not really free.  He is whisked out of the country by federal agents and soon realizes he has nobody to trust.  While in DC, Backman had become involved in attempting to sell an advanced secret software system to other governments.  Some Pakistani scientists had discovered some previously unknown advanced Chinese satellites while investigating a satellite launched by India to spy on Pakistan.  The software they developed could render these mysterious Chinese satellites useless and could otherwise control them.  The scientists went to Backman to ask him to broker a deal which would probably be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.  Of course several nations would be interested. <br /> <br />For most of the book Backman is hiding in Italy for there are several countries with agents who want him killed.  We are introduced to Italian history, customs, food and language.  Much Italian is used throughout the book, but luckily for me, English translations are given for each use of Italian.  There is a great deal of suspense as to the survival of Backman as he moves about Italy and finally attempts his escape back to the United States.  <br /> <br />I found the book to be one of the more interesting books of the author but felt some loose ends were left hanging at its conclusion. <br />
B0000AFX64|2.0|I picked up a copy of the LaserDisc edition of this film a while back from a cut-out bin.  I'm sort of glad I did, but not because watching it is in any way a pleasurable experience.  Remember how cool Galactica was when you were six years old?  Well, it was only that cool because you were six years old.  Watching it as an adult is a bracingly awful experience: you can almost feel those happy childhood memories crumpling to dust against the onslaught of cheesy costuming, ham-handed cold war allegories, awful dialogue, stilted acting and tacky sets.  Thrill to the same special effects shot repeated over and over again!  Gasp at the termites shed by Lorne Greene as he attempts to emote!  Shake your head in disbelief that you ever liked this stuff! <br /> <br />Having the LD of this movie has provided me with many fine hours of entertainment by letting me watch the faces of my friends who claim to have liked the series as a child as I force them to watch it.  Usually they start clawing their eyes out by the Space Disco scene.  (Yes, there really is a Space Disco scene.)  I'm overjoyed that they're re-releasing this on DVD, since this will allow me to continue torturing people with this fine slab of cheese without having to keep a functional laserdisc player around.
B00006GFAB|4.0|Yes I am a KISS  fan. So , any new KISS  item is a must buy. However, given that compilations like this one are available, why are there so many \\"Best ofs\\" under the rubric of KISS  available ?? <br />Gene never has enough cash, but surely he could write some more KISS  tunes??? It is not like someone with the remastered  items could not put their own disc  together. <br />It's about time that Gene and Paul ( the remnant  of KISS ), start to push out the originals  visual  shows, and stop the plethora of compilations.
0767834739|4.0|I watched the third (and hopefully final) installment of the Resident Evil series last night (Resident Evil:Apocalypse). <br /> <br /> You should see it if you want to see the most expensive (tens of <br />millions) and well done violent zombie destruction - huge monsters with <br />rocket launchers- exploding helicopter machine gun violence - fashion <br />models with dual machine guns - even a good nuclear explosion - ever put <br />in a movie. In addition, all the heros are really fashion models <br />(really, they are.). There is also no dialogue. Really. Not even a <br />little. Just screaming, barking of orders and commands to \\"LAUNCH!!!\\". <br /> <br /> The best part about the movie is that the plot is so horribly <br />unbelievable it borders on comically insane. Characters that were <br />formerly captured and imprisoned suddenly show up fully armored, healed <br />and ready to save the day. The story is not even cohesive in any manner, <br />and is so absurdly indigestible as to be insulting. Suspension of belief <br />doesn't even begin to cut it and at some points in the movie I was <br />forced to yell \\"OH COME ON!!\\" in disgust. Deus Ex Machina literally <br />rains down from the sky like a hurricane. It was clearly written by a 12 <br />year old, and a poorly educated one at that.  <br /> <br /> But the explosions are great. Especially the nuke. Highly <br />recommended. A+++++
B000669GAI|5.0|First of all, let's not confuse this disk with \\"LOST DOGS\\" as many reviewers here have stated these are B-Sides, they are not but for a few tracks released on ep or compilation.<br /><br />There is a format here, hard stuff on disk one, sofer on disk two, yet I kind of wish they would have done it chronologically or, like Tori Amos, remixed the entire album so all songs from all era's have a single, collected feel not the jolt of two year lags between studio time.<br /><br />The optomistic point of this collection is that Pearl Jam seems to really know where it's stregnths are, unlike Metallica who chooses widely the songs least appreciated by fans for there live shows / disk; Pearl Jam knows what the favorites are for those who don't do the entire album thing.<br /><br />This collections certainly contains no downside, and the subtle re-mixing of three TEN tracks to enhances various facets like Vocals or Acustic guitar is a nice touch.<br /><br />If you already contain a full Pearl Jam library there's just no need for this, the singles, lp's and Lost Dogs will nicely cover all this material. However, it does sound like much of this has been re-mastered, there's some nice sound clarity here on the early material that is not re-mixed which the originals seem to lack. Not surprising, digital recording has come a long way and transfering analog now is much better than 10 - 15 years ago.<br /><br />These songs are simply outstanding and perhaps a great way to bridge the gap between thier grunge roots and alt-rock, even folksy current years for those who don't like one or the other.<br /><br />A worthwile buy.
1559408855|1.0|I would give this zero stars if possible not because it's a good or bad film, but because I feel it's not a film that can or should be rated. A four or five star review seriously makes me wonder about the person who rated it so highly.  A one or two star review is being a bit generous.  I'm a fairly opened minded person when it comes to movies that push the envelope or cross the line of good taste as long as there's a point to it.  Salo seems to have no point at all.  It's a bit reminiscent of Caligula in its graphic displays of sexual and violent excesses but even Caligula had a point.  Essentially the story is about a group of Nazi aristocrats who kidnap a group of teenaged boys and girls and whisk them off to a secluded mansion.  Once there under the watch of gun toting guards, the teenagers are humiliated, physically abused and forced to participate in extreme sexual debauchery.   Once the aristocrats have their fill with the teenagers they, in turn, torture, mutilate and murder them.  After viewing the film, I was puzzled.   I couldn't grasp the point of it all.  My guess would be some visual discourse on being jealous of youth and beauty.  The aging unattractive Nazi aristocrats revel in making the young attractive teenagers participate in disgusting and ugly acts and finally take sick pleasure in the most extreme acts of mutilation and violence and yes, you get to see it all.  I'm amazed that this film was made, that actors would actually want to participate.  Salo is loosely based on Marquis de Sade's 120 Days of Sodom.  It's probably a book that was better off left as a book.  Salo is an interesting film but certainly not a film worthy of a star rating.  It's a disturbing, disgusting and from my perspective an utterly pointless film whose visuals will stick with you for days.  Worth a watch if you can stomach it, but in my opinion it lacks any redeeming social or cultural values.  Either that or something must have went completely over my head.
B00005JL78|1.0|I guess I am in the Minority. <br />I am not a Tom Cruise fan at all. And  with such a great story at the core of the film, it should have been used as the sequel to TOTAL  RECALL. Personally I would have liked to have seen  Arnie, or at the Very Least Paul Verhoeven, do this story in their  own way. <br />Visually nice, and Tom Cruise do not a good film make. <br />

B00020HEL6|4.0|There are two reasons I haven't given this album a five star rating.   <br /> <br />First, Renee goes over-the-top on some songs.  She has an amazing instrument in her voice.  She needs to learn to discipline that instrument.   <br /> <br />The best example of this is her interpretation of the Gershwin-Hayward song \\"Summertime\\", from the opera \\"Porgy and Bess\\".  The song is a lullaby, just as it says on the sheet music.  Instead, Renee and her producer, David Foster, turn it into a kind of version of \\"Minne the Moocher\\".  The song suddenly becomes about sex rather than a mother singing her baby to sleep.  It makes me cringe every time I hear it.   <br /> <br />The second issue is going to make me sound like a prude.   <br /> <br />Here is a 14 year old singing songs about love-gone-wrong and the longing to have sex.  Yes, 14 year olds absolutely think about having sex.  I was 14 once.  Been there, done that.  Can't say I had yet experienced \\"love-gone-wrong\\".  It just seems very odd to have one so young as Renee sing about such things.  I mean how different is it for Renee to sing \\"Midnight at the Oasis\\" and \\"Sunday Kind of Love\\" (the latter which she does BRILLIANTLY) and for Britney Speers to sing (if that's what you can call it) \\"Baby, one more time\\"?  It's not.  The former songs approach the subject far, far more tastefully and artistically, but the underlying meaning is still the same. <br /> <br />My point: I love these songs and her interpretations are mostly excellent, but just because these are older pieces of music doesn't necessarily make their subject matter \\"quaint\\" or \\"old fashioned\\".  They are about very adult kinds of feelings and desires.  I question whether these songs are appropriate for a young teenager to sing.  Go listen to Peter Gabriel's version of \\"Summertime\\" and see what I mean.  It is not a contemporary teenager's song.   <br /> <br />That said, the arrangements are lush.  Her voice is spot-on perfect.  Most interpretations are well crafted, with a minimum of the nonsense where the singer legatos all around a specific note without actually hitting it, much like you hear from Christina Aguliara and her clones.   <br /> <br />Renee has a long, long future in popular music if she wishes.   <br /> <br />And thank goodness David Foster discovered her before Disney did, otherwise we'd have another Lindsay Lohan on our hands (gag). <br /> <br />A solid four star performance!
0375703861|4.0|The beginning of Zadie Smith's debut novel White Teeth is marked by an extraordinary voice:  confident, affectionate, satiric, witty.  Archibald Jones attempts to kill himself in a car outside a Muslim butchery while pigeons fleeing from the murderous butcher leave streaks of purple excrement across his windshield.  Archie's life is spared by the irate butcher because \\". . .dying's no easy trick.  And suicide can't be put on a list of Things to Do in between cleaning the grill pan and leveling the sofa leg with a brick.\\"  This irreverent, comic beginning launches the novel into Archie's life and into that of his best friend Samad Iqbal.  Archie, given a new chance at life, marries the much younger Clara, the daughter of a Jamaican Jehovah Witness mother and a passive, emotionally absent father, while Samad, who is always striving to be a good Muslim, enters into an arranged marriage with Alsana, a woman who was not even born while he fought alongside Archie during World War II.  Their children - Irie Jones and the twins Millat and Magrid Iqbal - struggle to find their niche in their overwhelming white British surroundings.  If Smith had left her novel at that, at exploring the cultural rifts that divide the families and their cultures, this book would have succeeded admirably; however, the author departs from this course to explore a world that contains a snobbishly intellectual English family, genetic engineering, radical Islam, and the end of the world as predicted by the Jehovah Witnesses.  While these separate plots often serve as metaphors for the struggle to assimilate, they simply don't do enough to engage the reader.  The result is a tedious, wholly unfunny second half.  Characterizations that were done so well in the beginning become lost in the noise of the rest, making it difficult to care about what happens to Smith's inventions.  Plot turns begin to feel forced, and reactions, unnatural.  Most disappointingly, the witty voice of the narrator fades into the background, and is never as strong as it is in the first hundred pages.<br /><br />The novel owes much to the literary tradition of Victorians such as Dickens and Thackeray, who wrote sweeping novels with comic and/or biting wit.  Smith's range is impressive for a first-time novelist, but her skills and literary instincts are not yet honed enough to carry off the sprawl of such a complex concept.  Despite this, her descriptions and characterizations are first-rate, even if they get lost among the rest, and her turns of prose can be astonishing.<br /><br />This is one of those rare instances when I find it difficult to rate a book using the five star system.  White Teeth is an ambitious, unconventional novel that ultimately tries to be too much.  Readers who want to keep up on literary trends and celebrities will want to read this, since there is much to admire in Smith's work.the background, and is never as strong as it is in the first hundred pages. <br /> <br />The novel owes much to the literary tradition of Victorians such as Dickens and Thackeray, who wrote sweeping novels with comic and/or biting wit.

B000001EKX|5.0|Easily the most outrageous Cover that the Band did... if you believe the stories  about the photo  session :-)  The songs on this album have a patchy quality... all good in their own way, however, ALL THE WAY, and LET ME GO ROCK AND  ROLL, are easily the best. I know that ALL THE WAY is not a fan fave, but then, I love ROCKIN IN THE USA, so I guess mine is another minority view.  Overall, its a good listen, but it has some great work by Ace, and some superb work by the Demon; seems like the Gene  Jeanie actually did care in those days.
B0000640VO|5.0|Not knowing what this moive was or even that it was related to a film I enjoyed many years ago (city of lost children), I picked this movie up based on the Cover alone.  <br /> <br />This movie is so wonderfully optimistic, and beautiful. The only trouble with this movie is trying to convince people I know to watch a subtitles french movie :(  <br /> <br />Its easily one of My top 10 movies of all time, oddly enough a top ten thats packed tight with much darker films (Tidus, Natural Born Killers, Akira, THX 1138) I have refered to this as the ray of sunshine in my top ten movies :) <br /> <br />If you havent't seen this movie please watch it.

B0002Z0EYK|4.0|Wolfgang Peterson's \\"Troy\\" is a film for action buffs and not for classicists.  Here, immortality does not belong to the gods but instead to the fierce warrior, Achilles, who intends to fight the kind of battles that will etch his name in history for thousands of years.  A bit egotistical, yes, but it makes for a ferociously buff Brad Pitt intent on stealing the show, both as an actor and as a character.  \\"Troy\\" gives us an insolent Achilles (Pitt), lethal killer and hedonist, who fears no one, not even Agamemnon (Brian Cox), the king he fights for and for whom Achilles has nothing but disdain.  When Menoleus' wife Helen (Diane Kruger) steals off with the effete Paris (Orlando Bloom), brother-in-law Agamemnon sees the perfect opportunity to launch a war against his nemesis Priam (Peter O'Toole).<br /><br />Bloom's Paris is such a moronic wimp that it's hard to imagine he had the guts to convince Helen to escape with him to Troy.  Diane Kruger's Helen is equally clueless; even when she finally realizes that her departure from Sparta has jeopardized an entire nation, her attempts at rectifying matters are feeble and easy to put aside.  This choice to steer away from true passion and to present the couple as ineffectual is partly what makes \\"Troy\\" such a riveting film; the battles rage around Paris and Helen even though neither is worthy of such passion and violence, making the war seem unstoppable and stoked by more deeply rooted issues of pride, power, and greed. Despite its failings, \\"Troy\\" doesn't not have a boring moment in it.<br /><br />The stupidity of bringing the Trojan Horse inside the city walls recalls Monty Python, and some of the lines spoken by Paris and Helen are laughable; however, the film contains some fine roles and performances.  Peter O'Toole portrays a human Priam, gentle and full of love for his sons, and Cox's Agamemnon makes a dangerously arrogant foil for him.  Eric Bana as Hector exudes nobility and honor as well as a fierce passion for his family.  Sean Bean's Odysseus is so natural and likeable that I wished he had a bigger role.  The most astonishing performance is Brad Pitt, who is wholly believable as the unparalleled warrior and lover Achilles. He evokes barbarianism and passion in one sidelong look.<br /><br />As long as viewers don't expect accuracy, those looking for a riveting story and physical clashes will enjoy this film.for his family.

0780622553|5.0|As a film, I think it is best to say that this is a more defined story along the lines of THE CUBE. <br />It is not until the big reveal at the end that you discover why things are so undeveloped, and why no-one can remember when, specifically, they last saw the sun. <br />This is a great film to watch, and like all of Alex Proyas's work I know of, it is a very fulfilling story... at least on an entertainment level. <br />All the actors are well crafted in their roles, and fulfill  their acting roles in superb  form. Lots of material left to the imagination ... both visual and ( not in a pretentious manner) literary in a good way.
0767834739|2.0|I love resident evil, and the first movie is one of my favorites. <br /> <br />This movie was such a huge let down. First off the Directing was horrid. The action sequences scream of low quality. The director uses quick jagged camera movements to obscure the action in the movie and give the moive a \\"sense\\" of action, but people who are used to the matrix/jackie chane show whats going on aspects of a fight sequnce will be aggrivated with the final show down. <br /> <br />Ontop of that the movie down right STEALS from the various RE stroy lines. and re-writes resident evil 3 completly,. <br />I much rather have had a RE type story or one that could have ran parrel much like the first movie. In stead we get whole a scene stolen from RE code veronica and they actually look less stunning.If it wasn't a complete rip off (say if the character was the same) it wouldn't have been so glaringly bad, but when you go to see a movie you go to see \\"new\\" thoughts and ideas not just shifted image stolen from video games with different characters doing things that run logically against the game that the images are being stolen from. <br /> <br />An ok movie for people who have never played the game..  <br />But the action super hero twist and rip-off only serve to tarnish the fact that its supposed to be a \\"resident evil\\" movie. The director probably should have looked at some of the movies that RE borrwed from before he went about trying to turn this into a horrible wanna be super hero flick
B0002MB7QW|4.0|The title tells you why this movie didn't get 5 stars.<br /><br />I really like this movie. I like the storyline, the acting, the ending, almost everything. The scene where the ocean is rising up around the Statue of Liberty and on to the city is one of the most awesome I have ever seen.<br /><br />Elsewhere in other reviews you can get the storyline and other facts. I'm here because of that one niggling little gripe. For whatever reason, somebody decided \\"We don need to use no stinkin' real wolves, we have ANIMATORS!\\"  Guys, what would it have cost you to go rent 4 freakin' wolves?! Nah. You spend a few million bucks on making a movie then do this. The result of that decison was so fakey it ruined the entire scene in a place where I should have been on my seat edge wondering if the kids were going to get out in time. Instead, we're all siting there making snide comments about it. While all the slamming into metal walls (that moved) was all well and good, the animals couldn't even walk right.<br /><br />What were you thinking?

B000001E8P|4.0|The debate in the summer of 1995 centred around the Blur v Oasis debate. The correct answer was Pulp. Unlike Blur or Oasis, Pulp underwent a long gestation period before their instant classic 'Different Class', and their sound on this album reflects the development of a band who had gone through their probationary period and hit exactly the right tone at the right time.<br /><br />The mid 1990s were marked by the 'St Martin's college' culture -posh kids pretending to slum it. The signature tune on 'Different Class' skewers this custom in a build up of bitterness and class confrontation, deliberately attacking the bourgeoise 'poor' - 'You'll never fail like common people/never watch your life slide out of view'. Puncturing the middle class attitudes of the time is a theme that runs throughout the album - wittily and acidicly too. Take the following lyric from 'I spy' - 'My favourite parks are car parks, grass is something you smoke, birds are something you shag. Take your Year in Provence and shove it up your ass'. Cocker evidently does not suffer pretention gladly.<br /><br />Elsewhere there is the quizzical look at the ecstacy culture 'Sorted fo E's and Whizz' - 'Is this the way they say the future's meant to feel?/Or just 20,000 people standing in a field'.<br /><br />And the other main hit on the album, apart from 'Common People', Disco 2000 with its nostalgic remembrance of a childhood sweetheart who has grown up and become pregnant: 'Would you like to come and meet me maybe? you can even bring your baby'.<br /><br />A star deducted, because there are some unmemorable songs on this album. But 'Different Class' is a Britpop classic
B00005V3Z4|3.0|Having been into the wierder, darker movies my whole life my friend pushed me to see this movie after I told him some of my favorite movies. (Tidus, Natural born killers, THX 1138) <br /> <br />Unfotunatle even though the movies entertaining. and the ending somewhat suprising, the movie failed to leave me with any lasting effects. I just wasn't really that interested in the \\"depth\\" alot of people seem to get out of this movie, since all just pointless depth for depths sake. It doesn't address anything important, just uses a tapestry of sci-fi, religious schitzophrenic psycological under tones to enhance a other wise normal love story with a pretty cliched, sacrifice ending.  <br /> <br />I would reccomened it for people who are in desperate need of something different to watch, but please \\"Rent\\" the movie or by it cheap first.
B000002MTU|5.0|i bought this album for 3 songs: <br />1. i'm tore down <br />2. hoochie coochie man-if you bought radio one by jimi hendrix, he does this song too <br />3. motherless child-if you have ever seen the movie \\"twister\\", you'll notice that dusty is playing a video of eric singing this song while he has his van parked. <br />by the way, excellent album. get it, no matter what genre you listen to.
0385510454|1.0|This is an edition of a previous review of mine, \\"It's a strange price\\" (Jan 26, 2005). Apparently, it went over well with only a strict minority, as only 1 out of 8 readers (12.5%) found it \\"helpful\\" (what a cloy adjective for a review). However, it was VERY helpful to ME, because after having submitted it pointing out to Amazon the error that had been made in the price (almost $160.00) marked in my cart, once I put the order through it came down again to its real, much more sensible $16.77. About the book, now that I've gotten and read it:  I tend to agree with those who gave it a one-star rating, my second one is added out of respect for the average level of Mr Grisham's previ-ous production. Mr Grisham's effort in Italian is meritorious, with just a few imperfections; and, very uncommonly for an Anglo writer, he never presents us Italians as a people of hoods, beggars, beasts, boors, bimbos, and buffoons. There is a few discrepancies, such as this guy Joel Back-man/Marco Lazzeri finding himself in hiding and without two dimes to jingle together in his pocket, who has to beg for a 200 Euro's/week allowance from his case officer, Luigi, and at a certain mo-ment, all of a sudden, starts spending right and left on clothing. I agree that the descriptions of Bo-logna's topography and buildings, of the food to be found in our restaurants, and of our \\"slow\\" way to consume it, is excessive (you over there leave that to us, and keep on with the Big M, Burger King and the other American fast food joints). One point I can make (besides of that of the Italian train fares, which has already been dealt with by somebody else): the GRU is not the successor of the KGB, it has always been the Soviet Military Intelligence (in deep rivalry with KGB, which however almost always got the upper hand).. I guess, also, some of the worst reviews have been written by people - including the chest self-thumpers - who can't stand the idea of seeing Italy de-scribed as a civilized place. However, Mr Grisham compensates for the way he's expressed himself about Italy when he writes about Zrich, Switzerland (page 307, hardcover edition) \\"a city unbur-dened by traffic and tourists, gawking at cathedrals and museums and worshiping the last two thou-sand years [...] about money, the refined management of it\\". Yes, the Zrich gnomes at their best, that surely  sounds more to the American taste.
0131103628|2.0|No offense intended - but this is for the old version of ANSI C (known after the name of this book!) and does not cover the new 1999 ISO standard and there have been significant changes to this language.  Go with something newer.
B0000057C5|5.0|Rammstein is so absolutely awesome, there is not a single song of theirs that sounds anything like the other, every single theme they come up with is original and beautiful.  These are the guys that reminded me that music isn't made by stupid 13-year old punker bands or \\"gangster\\" rappers who can't go a sentence without restating that they are black or live in the ghetto.  Here is the anatomy of this CD (not counting the special added english versions or Stripped). <br /> <br />1. Sensucht - I love this song.  When you first listen to the cd, you'll probably skip it because of its freakish monk-hymns, but holy crap, if you listen through it you will love it.  SENSUCHT!!! <br /> <br />2. Engel - Ooo, such a relief from hard clanging noises.  Beautiful song, if you understand German then you'll learn an awesome lesson from this.  The whistling is what hooked me the first time. <br /> <br />3. Tier - Woah, this is an insane song.  \\"Tier\\" means \\"animal,\\" which is obviously the theme of this song.  I love it, you'll keep pressing previous track to listen to it over and over. <br /> <br />4. Bestrafe Mich - \\"Punish Me\\" is the name of the track, and trust me, this song is highly addictive.  I cannot believe how well Rammstein plays the guitar. <br /> <br />5. Buck Dich - Oh my god, this song makes me wanna break stuff its so awesome.  I love it, love it, love it.  The weird smashing noises during the chorus get the adrenaline pumping.  CAUTION: DO NOT HOLD FRAGILE OBJECTS WHILE LISTENING TO THIS SONG. <br /> <br />6. Spiel Mit Mir - The english translation of this song is \\"Play With Me,\\" but if you don't understand german that will be the last name you ever guess.  The joyfully dark sound in the background during the chorus is sooo cool, you will be listening to this song wayyyy too many times.   <br /> <br />7. Klavier - Now this songs freaky.  Apparently, it's about a curious boy who listens to a girl playing the gentle instrument of piano, when he suddenly snaps and murders her.  Still, the song is really beautiful. <br /> <br />8. Alter Mann - When I first got this cd this was my favorite song.  And after listening to the entire cd, this is still one of my favorites.  Shows that despite Rammstein's insanity, they still show respect.  And that's cool.   <br /> <br />9. Eifersucht - This song doesn't seem like much at first, so give it some time, it will definitely grow on you.  I love it. <br /> <br />10. Kuss Mich - WTF?!?! This song is so cool, especially with all those sounds that confuse you.  Shows that Rammstein's got a sense of humor. <br /> <br />So that's it.  Go buy this CD, then go buy Reise Reise.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|I have seen this movie and I think that it is the absolute WORST movie in history. The jokes are corny, and the movie just has no point. I don't know why everyone raves about this movie it is totally overrated>
B00000G3I2|4.0|First of all, if you think the film is too \\"WHINY\\" then PLEASE GET OVER YOURSELF!!!  I love how people who complain about others \\"whining\\" always do it in such a whiny fashion: \\"Oh, i just had to leave the theater, it was SUCH torture\\".  If youre too self-absorbed and smug to gain insight or inspiration from hearing about other people's sincere doubts and dissatisfactions then you're just plain shallow and crass as a person.  Go watch some reruns of \\"Freinds\\" and keep pretending this bears some relation to real life.  Second, the \\"their grief wasn't convincing\\" complaint comes up again and again.  I can understand this take on it, but consider this: Everyone grieves in their own way; when i was but a mere twenty-one years old, one of my closest freinds died suddenly and unexpectedly.  I cried at his funeral, but within a few hours of the service i was at a restaurant drinking and having a good time with all our other mutual pals - that night we stayed up getting drunk and high on the roof of an apartment building as much in celebration of our dear comrade's life as in grief over his and our loss.  I talked to a buddy that night saying, \\"It just hasn't sunken in yet\\", and it hadn't. And it never did hit me the way i thought it would, at least partly because people don't always mourn the same way they so often do in movies.  I loved my freind like a brother, but i only ever wept for him once, very breifly, at the funeral service - after that I was as normal as ever, even while discussing him posthumously with other freinds.  I find this movie to be quite realistic and endearing - even profound in certain moments.  I am of a much younger generation than the one portrayed, but their conversations (whininess, self-pity, intellectual conceit and ALL) still resonate with me and my veiw of the world.  If that makes me a whiny gen X archetype then so be it - but i'm still smart enough to take any of your bogus \\"self-absorbed slacker\\" accusations throw them right back in yourface to reveal you as the vapid, unreflective, self-righteous, self congratulatory, and plain-old SELFISH jerk you are . . . plus, i can probably kick your ass.  This is a great film with some amazing, career-defining performances by some equally great actors - especially Goldblum.  I highly recomend this to anyone else who has ever had the presence of mind to doubt yourself, what youve become, or your station in the world.  If youre willfully ignorant enough to feel totally secure in all those areas already, then by all means, write a book and share your secret with the rest of us - otherwise shut the hell up.       Yeah, i suppose my life story isn't all that helpfull, but it was meant to illustrate a point (that people mourn in many different ways, and that doesn't make them shallow)which i was making in response to one of the more frequent criticisms of the film found on these pages. As for the rest - i stand by it: you can dislike this film for any number of reasons, but simply labelling these characters as whiny and shallow is narrow-minded, ignorant, and indicative of some serious flaws in your approach to other people.  Keep those unhelpful votes coming!!!    \\"deadheads in caddillacs\\" - yeah, i could just as easily pin all the social ills that one reviewer above so absurdly blames on the cliched mythical stereotype of the \\"baby boomer generation\\" (as if any such thing actually ever existed outside of Time magazine cover articles) on the bogus liberal pieties of Don Henley listeners (grow some friggin ears, for god's sake!) - but that would be just as arbitrary, and equally disingenuous. Again: GET OVER YOURSELVES!
B00005JL7Q|4.0|...if this movie had fallen into the hands of a lesser director, particularly a cloying and schmaltzy American one (read: Steven Spielberg, Joel Schumacher, etc.) this movie could've easily turned into your standard full-blown Hollywood blockbuster of a catastrophe.<br /><br />Amazingly enough, it fell into the hands of the directors of \\"American Pie,\\" who were wise enough to keep the film's location in London rather than transplanting it to say New York or LA as was done to Nick Hornsby's other book, \\"High Fidelity,\\" which was also London-based and barely survived its transplantation to Chicago.  Most importantly, they were also wise enough to preserve most of the original book's characteristically British flavor.<br /><br />You know the kind of vintage Hollywood cheesefest I'm talking about: one of those kitschy, brain-dead, focus-group-spawned, tear-jerking, cheesy-feel-good plotlines affirming \\"family values\\" and other assorted crockery with the painfully melodramatic UPLIFTING HAPPY ENDING you could see coming about ten miles away.<br /><br />Well, this movie comes close to the edge of that abyss but thankfully gets pulled back every time by a very potent antidote: British humor!  Otherwise known as sarcasm, irony, wit, and other terms seldom understood in this Bushian age of \\"reality\\" shows and semi-retarded presidents.  This film is full of that, with a very strong snappy script that could only have been written on that little island off the western coast of Europe...and no, I don't mean Ireland.<br /><br />There are sprinklings of cheese here and there but plenty of merciful restraint, so all the parts that had me cringing in anticipation of a full-frontal CHEESE ASSAULT actually turned out to fairly well, it was done in the most admirably tasteful moderation.<br /><br />The special features on this DVD are also noteworthy.  I've never seen a film with so many deleted scenes that made me wish they had NOT been deleted!  (With most films it's easy to see why the \\"Deleted Scenes\\" were deleted.)  There's also some music videos and artist info about the British pop band whose music dominates the pleasantly catchy pop soundtrack, and an \\"English to English\\" dictionary feature which I'm sure Americans who've never been exposed to British English idioms will find extremely useful.<br /><br />I'm not sure I could sit and watch this movie more than once, but it was nonetheless an VERY fun 2 hours!s easy to see why the \\"Deleted Scenes\\" were deleted.)

B00000099Y|5.0|Tool is amazing. Eulogy, Forty Six and 2, Anenima is amazing, the whole CD is riddled with musical power. Everything blends together with perfect harmony. For all Tool fans, this album, Undertow, and Lateralus is a must.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|I tell you, i've been listening to Micheal Jackson since I was 5. There's no need to be fooling everyone that he's the king of pop! He should be nominated the best R&B artist of all time, seriously. And now that im 20, he's the all time favorite artist of mine. I don't care what people say about him in the news, he's still the reigning king of R&B/Soul, or you might say pop artist of all time. For a spotlight of what im talking here, listen to him on 'Never Can Say Goodbye' when he was in Jackson 5. And also 'Rock With You' and 'Break of Dawn'. Enjoy!
B00005JMEW|5.0|The way Quentin mixed up the live actresses/actors and cartoon characters is so funny. The use of background music is comical. The fighting is professional crafted. And the conversation is Quentin-ism.
B00005JNJ7|4.0|If you felt the the south park movie had an episode's worth of jokes stretched along an hour and a half... Prepare to feel that way again.    Keep in mind that means this movie does have its moments.    Lloyd Harris.
B00005JMUA|5.0|Only Quentin pulled out this wonderful ending.    With Carradine gave this punch-line \\"Baby, you ain't kidding\\" before the grand final battle. It almost killed me with laughing but Quentin didn't give me enough time enjoy it, he threw in the sword-fight and fist-fight immediately. Luckily for me, I watched DVD so I could rewind it. ;-)    And the conversation between Thurman and Carradine is masterfully written in both the living room and patio.    I believe Quentin could pull out Kill Bill 3 and Kill Bill 4 as well as Kill Bill Episo One easily.    Carradine's act is favorite one since Tommy Lee Jones in MIB when he bought the Tabloid at the counter and when he accepted the drink offer from the lady at the farm house. So funny and so professional. ;-)    A few points I observed from this movie:    1) 2 seemingly unrelated scenes: killing Bill and killing Elle. We know Kiddo would kill Bill at the end but how? The whole 2 movies revolving around the Hanzo's sword. Then it had been what we all anticipated. Then Kiddo poked out Elle's last eye after Kiddo questioned Elle about the first lost eye (Mei Pei did it). I could not realize it until now that it was an introduction to the ultimate technique that he taught her. And she kept it secretly so that she could use on Bill at the end. (See human complexity below.)  2) Long fight between Bill and Kiddo: we all waited to see a long violent fight between them. It didn't happen but it DID happen. The whole 2 movies are about how Bill tried to kill Kiddo violenly but unsuccessfully. Then he stacked up the killers to stop her.  3) Bill did not want to kill Kiddo: he stopped Elle when she was about to kill Kiddo in the hospital in the first movie. He could just kill her by gun when they were in the living. Or ordered Budd to terminate Kiddo. And so on.  4) Bill is a complex person: He admitted he was a murdering bastard. He confessed he was so upset when he felt betrayed by Kiddo. He took on the job of single-dad. He didn't try to kill Kiddo after the first time, he just tried to stop her from killing him.  5) Quentin deleted one very good scene: I guessed the blood flowing was so \\"ridiculous\\" to even Quentin's standard. ;-) But on the first movie, he showed Lucy Liu with half of her brain exposed... ;-) What a sicko! ;-) (Great job, man!) And Thurman looked the best in that deleted scene. Wow!  6) It's about a love story: At the end, Kiddo and Bill still had feeling for each other.  7) Quentin admitted that the whole movie is almost all about Bill. His purpose is for the generation after Kung Fu will remember Carradine as Bill, not as Kwai Chang Caine.
B0001BKAEE|2.0|This movie is called Matrix. Something the characters were not in as much as they should have been if viewers were to feel traped. The atmosphere went sour in some parts of the movie and yes. The ending was rubbish. <br /> <br />I admit. I did expect more from the matrix. It were Superman and Doomsday in the \\"Super Brawl\\" I would have been astonished. But, alas, I was not. I wish I had a movie eraser I could rub out revolutions and the sex scene in reloaded while I was at it. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong for a hollywood movie this gets a 8/10 or 9/10. But for The Matrix... all it gets from me is a 3/10 to 4/10 and a dissapointed viewer. <br /> <br />Lloyd Harris.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I have a few points to make about some of the reviews I've read here. The Greedo shoots first scene? Done almost eight years ago and revised for the dvd. Why are you complaining about it now for a review of the dvd? The Jabba The Hutt scene? Done eight years ago, also slightly revised for the dvd. Luke's scream down the chasm in Empire. Added eight years ago and taken OUT of the dvd version. Why? Most fans didn't like it and logic says if he made the conscious choice, the decision to step off, why would he scream? Meh, he sounded like the emperor anyway. The added shots of Darth Vader in Empire? Yep, eight years ago. The Ewoks \\"Yub yub\\" song? Yep, changed eight years ago. Since this is supposed to be review of the dvd, I'll say that I've never seen Star Wars looking or sounding better and the bonus disc is excellent. Back in the early eighties, trailers weren't all that they are today, but here we've got'em. Even an advanced trailer for *snicker* Revenge of the Jedi. That was of course before Lucas decided that a Jedi wouldn't take Revenge and called it Return instead. All in all this is a great set to have. I would also have liked the originals in all their gritty, grimy glory, but what I do have here is awesome indeed.
B0001ZMWQO|1.0|What's up with all of these bands with \\"Ferdinand\\" in their names? I mean, come ON already; there must be a hundred of 'em right now! Franz Ferdinand put the name \\"Ferdinand\\" right on the rock map! Right between the feuding border towns of Hummingbird, NJ and Intercourse, PA.  If you don't think that \\"FF\\", as I like to call them, bring the rock, then brutha you'd best catch the live show.  Let me tell you, I caught the boys several years ago when they were dual headlining with Alice in Chains (the opening act was, at the time, a little know band call Limp Bizkit!) -- this crew ran AiC right out of the Brew and Spew! For those of you not familiar with the Brew and Spew, it's only the most spectacular bar/club on the rock tour circuit.  Those are some discriminating rock fans, but they know rock when they hear it... and its name is \\"Ferdinand\\". <br /> <br />On a more serious note -- RIP Layne Staley.  If it weren't for your considerable skills at evaluating young rock talent, the world would never know about \\"FF\\".  Peace out, my brother!
B0006M4SO6|5.0|Only PMG could pull off this project - if any mere mortals tried this, it would fall flat.  With this release, Pat Metheny and his musical collaborators raise the bar still higher than they have previously as simply the best ensemble in contemporary jazz today.  I see \\"The Way Up\\" as a sort of magnum opus, career summation record.  It is everything it wants to be and I really dig it.  To paraphrase John Madden, \\"PMG knew where they wanted to go and they got there.\\"    NOT for those new to Pat Metheny Group, however. (or those with short attention spans).
B00005R62N|5.0|Released in 1979 (it would go Platinum ten years later), Unleashed in the East isn't just the best live album available from Judas Priest, it's one of the best live albums ever recorded.  Purists can nitpick all they want on whether this is considered a \\"live\\" album or not, but you'll rarely find anything that sounds better than this.  Classic Priest songs like \\"Exciter\\", \\"Sinner\\", \\"The Ripper\\", \\"Green Manalishi\\", \\"Diamonds and Rust\\", \\"Victim of Changes\\", \\"Tyrant\\", and \\"Hell Bent for Leather\\" are re-produced live with faster tempos, edgier riffs, and grinding solos that are pure old metal bliss.  Rob Halford's voice booms, and the guitar combo of Downing and Tipton can be heard in their prime here.  All in all, any Judas Priest fan most likely owns this disc, but if you don't, consider Unleashed in the East an absolute must own.
1932100385|5.0|T. Colin Campbell has made a career of challenging the conventional wisdom around nutrition, and this book is the culmination of his work.  His integrity, brilliance, and unflinching courage shine through every page.<br /><br />The main point of this book is that most nutritional studies that we hear about in the media are poorly constructed because of what the author terms \\"scientific reductionism.\\"  That is, they attempt to pin down the effects of a single nutrient in isolation from all other aspects of diet and lifestyle.<br /><br />While this is the \\"gold standard\\" for clinical trials in the pharmaceutical world, it just doesn't work when it comes to nutrition. Given that the Western diet is extremely high fat and high protein compared to most of the rest of the world, studies that examine slight variations in this diet (i.e., adding a few grams of fiber or substituting skim milk for full fat milk) are like comparing the mortality rates of people who smoke five packs of cigarettes a day vs. people who smoke only 97 cigarettes a day.<br /><br />Campbell's research, which he describes in a very accessible and engaging fashion, has two tremendous advantages over the typical nutritional study. First, there is the China Study itself - a massive series of snapshots of the relationship between diet and disease in over 100 villages all over China.  The rates of disease differ greatly from region to region, and Campbell and his research partners (including some of the most distinguished scholars and epidemiologists in the world) carefully correlated these differences with the varying diets of the communities.<br /><br />It's not lazy \\"survey research\\" either - the researchers don't rely on their subjects' memory to determine what they ate and drank. The researchers also observed shopping patterns and took blood samples to cross-validate all the data.<br /><br />The second amazing part of Campbell's research method is his refusal to accept any finding without taking it back to his lab and finding out how exactly it works.  In other words, we discover in The China Study not only in what way, but precisely how, the foods we eat can either promote or compromise our health.<br /><br />The book is part intellectual biography / hero's journey (although Campbell is always wonderfully humble - there's no trace of self-congratulation, just a deep gratitude for what he has experienced), part nutrition guide (the most honest and unflinching one you'll ever read), and part expose.  The final section leaves no sacred cow standing, and names names!  From the food industry, to the government, to academia, Campbell calmly reports on a coverup of nutritional truth so widespread and insidious that all citizens should be enraged.<br /><br />I have a PhD in health education and a Masters in Public Health - and I can honestly say that no book has shaken my worldview like this one.  Anyone interested in health - their own, or that of their family, friends, or community - must read this book and share it.  Campbell has started a revolution. Skip this work at your own peril.ck to his lab and finding out how exactly it works.

B0006M4SO6|3.0|Well this is a little better than Metheny's \\"Zero Balance\\"cd.  Its says it all  The way up to what? I listened many times to this Cd,and still said \\"I think this group after some 25 years has lost their wonderful approach to that thing they call \\"the Metheny sound\\" I have every Pat Metheny Cd(including his solos). It first starts with track one (there are only four track,but we cant even call them tracks) Sounding like a nice groove ,but fails to reach that \\"way up\\",only to be doodling around waiting for the next groove to happen. The good Pat cd's always had ,what I called a \\"repeating melody\\",something at the end of the record ,you would be whistling. If you are a \\"die hard\\" Metheny fan,buy it,other than that wait till it hits the discount Cd house. The only thing that always shines are the musicians.(Of course not as good without Paul Wertico) But the \\"new\\" people,Coung Vu,trumpet,Gregoire Maret,harmonica and drummer Antonio Sanchez,  do a good job. Now its time for these fellows to write some descent music.I waited for weeks for this to come out,what a disaappointment! The way up for  Pat Metheny's band is nowhere but the way down. I am hoping the next CD will be a little better.

B00005JMUA|5.0|This two-parter is the best thing Tarantino has done since Pulp Fiction. My wife hated the first part last year, so I had to go to this one with some like-minded friends, and we loved it. We know now that the Bride's real name is Beatrix Kiddo (nice bit of tongue-in-cheek) and Umas Thurman long, lanky style fits the role perfectly. Michael Madsen is terrific as Bill's brother, Budd. And David Caradine is an instant classic as Bill. Again, Tarantino builds great individual scenes, including the last fight between Beatrix and Elle (Daryl Hannah), the black mamba bit, Bill's analysis of comic book superhero character-types, and the entire burial alive chapter. My friends felt a bit cheated that the showdown between the Bride and Bill wasn't a cataclysmic samurai sword scene, but I thought the rather understated Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique was a perfect, unexpected Tarantino ending.
B0006399FS|1.0|It's about time someone draw the line about U2: U2 have huge control over their empire, including [...] tickets, propaganda, memberships, etc, etc.     Pre-sale tickets was a disaster and it is unacceptable. They choose to not only charge their fans exorbitant ticket prices but outrageous club prices as well. Do you still believe this is the peacemaker and activist band ?.     EVERY one are disappointed with u2.com, but they don't do anything to change things, they just take care about cash, grammy and their upcoming \\"Vertigo\\" Tour. We are so angry at U2 today. We've never been angry at them before in such way. U2.com has been a disaster, specially for paid memberships, and the band themselves ought to make an apology rather than stay quiet and act like nothing is wrong.    We wish that U2 would just strip themselves of their fashion, their money, their pride, and start from scratch all over again.    Yet some fans don't want to blame U2 for all this mess. It's kinda like the abuse of Iraqi prisoners, the ones who take the heat are directly the top level people - Bush and Rumsfeld, even if they may not have been the ones to actually perpetrate the crimes. FACE THE TRUTH: U2 ARE GUILTY. WE are the victims, not them !!.    The business seems to be far more important than the band itself, and all press - Rolling Stone, Time, Mojo, NME, Billboard, etc - are so happy for that. HOW TO DISMANTLE A U2 FAN-BASE - the actual title - was a lie, We all got taken. And the \\"guarantees\\" all were lies as well. Bono's sly grin on the cover of HTDAAB says it all.    U2 have dropped the ball. U2 are clerarly & profoundly much more involver in the music industry for money, fame and fortune than they are for making music. Shame on U2, shame on the press, shame on the critics.     POWER TO THE PEOPLE
B0002858YS|5.0|When was the last time an American band broked into the music scene thats far more than to be played on Mtv? Prolly too long (3 years since when The Strokes 'Is This It' came out). <br /> <br />Nice drumming, wicked guitar playing, groundreakin bass and incredible keyboarding aswell. These 4 guys from Las Vegas decided to break the ice and proved that America's music is not dead yet. Good writings that will make you wanna either stand up and dance or jam along if you can. <br /> <br />Will be looking foward in listening their second lp.

U2.com has been a disaster, specially for paid memberships, and the band themselves ought to make an apology rather than stay quiet and act like nothing is wrong.     We wish that U2 would just strip themselves of their fashion, their money, their pride, and start from scratch all over again.     Yet some fans don't want to blame U2 for all this mess. It's kinda like the abuse of Iraqi prisoners, the ones who take the heat are directly the top level people - Bush and Rumsfeld, even if they may not have been the ones to actually perpetrate the crimes. FACE THE TRUTH: U2 ARE GUILTY. WE are the victims, not them !!.     The business seems to be far more important than the band itself, and all press - Rolling Stone, Time, Mojo, NME, Billboard, etc - are so happy for that. HOW TO DISMANTLE A U2 FAN-BASE - the actual title - was a lie, We all got taken. And the \\"guarantees\\" all were lies as well. Bono's sly grin on the cover of HTDAAB says it all.     U2 have dropped the ball. U2 are clerarly & profoundly much more involver in the music industry for money, fame and fortune than they are for making music. Shame on U2, shame on the press, shame on the critics.     POWER TO THE PEOPLE
B00004ZAV3|5.0|There weren't gonna be any surprises as if \\"I wonder what songs would be on the track list?\\" since it's not a greatest hits ablum. All the #1 singles that the fab four ever had are posted on this album and all thou there should of been so many more it's still a great record to have. Again, there won't be any disapointments due to it's just their number 1 hits throu out their history. Simple!
B000002UAX|3.0|This isn't really a review as such, more a comment on people's attitudes. The Beatles and Led Zeppelin, along with much Pink Floyd and U2 have an unfair advanatge. People will buy their albums simply on the basis of their NAMES. Who hasn't heard of The Beatles or Zeppelin? The few castaways who haven't soon will if they have at least any contact with civilization. People will fall over themselves in the rush to buy their albums, even if they don't really like them , they will at least try them to see what all the fuss is about. And to show their friends , that yes, they too own The White Album. But if I say that (here  insert some band names you've no doubt ever heard of) are good bands that I think are worth exploring, will you all rush out to buy their albums? of course not- no hype, no compulsion to buy. I've often noticed that people say that The Beatles, Zeppelin and Pink Floyd are the greatest bands of all time. Tell you what, go buy, beg, borrow or steal every single album by every artist who has ever recorded and listen to them. And then you can truly make up your mind as to whether or not The Beatles , Floyd and Zep are the best. And too often peope will judge a band on one or two songs, or an album. well what would people think of the Beatles if they heard only Why don't we Do It In The Road, Revoltion 9, or Octopus's garden?, or at most Beatles For Sale? Which in my experience is what people judge some of the music I like by. A few lacklustre songs =  bad band. (Math for the retarded.)They hear a few songs that they might not like all that much ( and ones that I too don't care for much) amd decide they don't care for the band.  The Beatles and Zeppelin however are bands whose  sins are always forgiven! Keep buying their albums! I used to be a Beatles fan, and I still respect them, but too often the \\"mighty\\" bands are used as a crutch for the lazy.
B00005OM4N|1.0|If you like CANNED music then this is for you.  Britney does not make real music.  She can not sing.  If you buy this CD then you are buying into the marketing scheme that has been thrown into our faces on every second of everyday on every media outlet.  Don't fall for it.  Don't be brainwashed to think everything Britney is wonderful.  Think for yourself.  Save a buck.
B0000844I8|4.0|Fantastic story of intergalactic travel that's certainly a worthy rental. Imagine a cross between the Twilight Zone and The Ten Commandments spruced up with laser guns and bazookas. Mili Avital is quite the bomb as Sha'uri. Keep an eye out for Horus (Djimon Hounsou), none other than Cinque from 'Amistad.' Russel and Spader need little applause, they go about their business with a single-minded devotion. Don't expect E.T. type wonder and awe at every alternate pace, the whole extravaganza is fast-paced and compulsively watchable in a way that only a foolhardy scifi movie can be. Highly recommended for people looking for some action.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|Anyone out there likes this movie as well?  I like it very much.  Yes, I am not talking about the real \\"butterfly effect\\" theory.  I am talking about the Hollywood movie.   <br /> <br />The butterfly effect states that any slight change in one part of the world would have a massive domino effect on lots of subsequent and perhaps unrelated events.  On top of this, the movie has an extra message, which is, of course, not being mentioned in the original theory:  if we could go back in time, what ever we do differently - and positively, it would some what has a negative effect on the other aspect on our own life.  It is because the world is fair. <br /> <br />In the story, no matter how hard Evan (the main guy) try to go back the time and change the history to save himself and to save the people around him, there would always be some new bad things pop up to balance out the change.  I see this as a very hash but real observation of our life.  Wouldn't it be great if we could always run our life as how we play show hand: keep the good cards and change the bad cards?  It reminds me how we play those RPG games.  During set up, we always have to tune the statistics of the character at the start.  Everybody is given certain among of total score.  It is the user who would decide how to allocate the score.  If we want to have more \\"wisdom\\", then we might have to give up some \\"strength\\".  That's life. <br /> <br />I watched the movie at home, which is the director cut in the DVD.  I love the ending very much, and I feel lucky that I didn't watch it in the cinema.  For the welfare of those of you who has not yet bought the DVD, I am not going to spell out the difference.  Please go and buy the DVD and watch all 4 different endings, and you will know what I mean. <br />
0767817729|2.0|Was this a western? Number of Mexican hats per capita would suggest so. Was it a romantic film with flaring passions gone awry? The sizzling chemistry between Stowe and Costner had me foxed. Was this a mafia theme with vengeful retributions? Quinn is convincing as a jilted, betrayed, and thus ferocious husband, so I half-expected a thrilling picture. Even Tony Scott's cinematography is servicable. Sadly, my refrigerator has expired eggs that stink lesser than the script for this utterly insipid dreck.
B00005JM1F|5.0|This movie is no doubt going to be a classic for years to come, especially among college students. Vince Vaughn and Will Ferrell are histarical. No doubt on my Top 5 Comedies.
B00005JL7Q|2.0|I wanted to like this movie, I really did.  But I was disappointed by it.<br /><br />The premise of the film is that Will (Hugh Grant), a selfish slacker who has no job and lives off his father's old royalty fees, decides to start preying on single mothers who are looking for a little romance.  He then meets Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), the young son of a suicidal woman who is desperately seeking help and friendship.  Will eventually asks Marcus to pretend to be his son in order to have a shot at dating an attractive single mom (Rachel Weisz), and everything goes downhill from there.<br /><br />\\"About a Boy\\" isn't at all what I expected it to be.  I didn't think it was all that funny or moving, and I probably wouldn't have sat through the entire thing if it weren't for the fact that I adore Hugh Grant, and he really does a great job in the film.  I think my biggest problem with the movie is that the kid who plays Marcus is kind of freaky, and I cringed every time his creepy little face popped up on the screen.  I do not recommend seeing this film unless you are a big fan of Hugh Grant, in which case I suggest tuning in only for the final fifteen minutes so you can see him sing a rousing rendition of \\"Killing Me Softly,\\" which is pretty freakin' hilarious.  Otherwise, this is definitely a film to pass up.
B000002H33|5.0|Metallica are metal gods, and if you're wondering why, just pick this cd up. Even if you're not an 80's metal freak, myself included, Metallica is still the best band you will ever have the privelige to listen to. It doesn't get any better than these guys, it just doesn't. The Beatles can't even touch them. Of course everyone knows the track Master Of Puppets, but another you may not know about is Orion, a masterful orgy of guitar genius. Throw the insane speed metal of Damage Inc. and the ahead of its time, detuned Thing That Should Not Be, and you've got the most rounded record of it's time. Don't believe me? I challenge anyone with some music theory knowledge and little guitar know how to prove me wrong. SIMPLY THE BEST BAND TO EXIST ON THIS EARTH. Proove me wrong. You can't. <br />
B00005JNBQ|4.0|This is definitely a \\"love it\\" or \\"hate it\\" kind of movie.  I personally LOVED it.   <br /> <br />Yes, there was no plot, no character development and no obvious \\"moral to the story.\\"  It's a movie about nothing.  That's okay because it was truly funny.  It gets funnier the more you think about it.  How can you not love lines like, 'You know I'm training to be a cage fighter' and 'Girls like guys with skills, nun chuck skills, computer hacking skills...' <br /> <br />I disagree with others that say the only reason you'd laugh at this is because you feel superior to Napoleon.  I empathized and liked him and, for Pete's sake, it's only a movie!  I think the people that don't like this movie are the ones that feel distain for the characters OR maybe they relate too closely with them (Hmmm).
B0001CNRS4|4.0|I have to admit, I loved this movie. Sure, it doesn't take brains to watch it, but it's easy to watch, and enjoyable too. It's along the lines of Save The Last Dance too. I'm never going to be a dancer; I don't have the discipline or the patience, or the body for that matter, but I still love these movies. The soundtrack needs to be played blaring, without anyone else in the house, which I did today.<br /><br />I hadn't previously heard of Jessica Alba, I only knew she's in a TV series called Dark Angel, and she's going to be in the Fantastic Four movie? (How do I pick this stuff up?!) She was bubbly, and great to watch though, although I preferred her hair straight, as it was on the cover. I loved the cover for this DVD, it instantly makes you want to pick it up & buy it - plus it looks Holly Valance on the cover.<br /><br />I wasn't so keen on Lil' Romeo being in it, he's not that big over here in the UK, although I see he appeared in Jo-Jo's last video. Lil' Romeo grew two inches and his voice deepened before shooting completed. In the scene where Benny and Raymond go to class and Honey says that she has to go to a video shoot, Romeo had to stand with his legs far apart in order to appear shorter, because he was as tall as Jessica Alba.<br /><br />OK, so quite a few people are slating this movie, but they're probably expecting it to be some kind of gritty, realistic movie, when really it's for people who love to dance - or who love to watch it. There's some quibbles about this movie: there's not a single dramatic moment, and the setbacks come right on cue - Lil' Romeo's character gets arrested for example. The characters are straight on the train from Cliches Central, from the saintly title character of Honey, to the sexually predatory rival dancer. And I'm sorry, but no music video ever has the choreographer's name on it. It's just the movie's way of showing Honey Daniels did become famous. There's a lot of R'n'B cameos in it, although I know who Missy Elliot is, I was scratching my head when it came to a lassie called Tweet, or Genuine. There's also a love story, with Mekhi Phifer as the barber, basketball playing love interest, but the story is barely shown, apart from a few scenes with lingering looks, and chaste pecks.<br /><br />This is one of those films which is always going to be compared to others, such as Save The Last Dance, Dirty Dancing, Coyote Ugly or Glitter, and sure it's not original, and it's totally formulaic, but it's great fun.liot is, I was scratching my head when it came to a lassie called Tweet, or Genuine.

0783114222|4.0|On the whole a very strong series, but not without some bothersome issues.  For example, the episode on the near disaster of Apollo 13 split time recounting the actual story with the tale of a fictional news anchor's career crisis in the face of a young reporter's unscrupulous journalism.  If the story detailed a crisis Walter Cronkite had at the time of the mission, I would not take issue with it.  But for the incredible story of Apollo 13 to take a back seat to a fictional melodrama is as wasteful as it is useless to anyone who bought the series to learn about Apollo.  The message it sends to me is, \\"If you really want to learn about Apollo 13, forget our mini-series and go watch the movie Apollo 13 instead.\\" <br /> <br />I am also annoyed with the third episode, which uses the clich device of storytelling through the eyes of a documentary team (which I presume to be fictional, as well).  Yet another example:  the final episode, \\"Le Voyage Dans La Lune,\\" robs an otherwise tasteful series conclusion by accounting an early 20th century French filmmaker who made the first sci-fi picture about moon travel.  Fortunately the picture he made, sharing the episode's title, is a real movie that was really shot during the early 1900s.  However, in the context of 11 other episodes solely about the 1960s-1970s U.S. space effort, I find that the French filmmaker story does not fit well with the overall theme of the series. <br /> <br />I might also add that for the most part, the actors don't really resemble the original astronauts. <br /> <br />But the story still has some extraordinary moments.  I (and it seems many other reviewers here) absolutely loved \\"Spider,\\" the episode of Grumman Aerospace's seven-year ordeal overcoming the challenges in making the LEM moonworthy.  Matt Craven's performance as dedicated Grumman project manager Tom Kelly was fantastic.  \\"Galileo Was Right\\" is another home run, showing that sometimes a good teacher can make all the difference in the world...or on the moon.  The stories of the tragic Apollo 1 and triumphant Apollo 11 are very strong in their own right, as well, accurately fleshing out their respective stories in great detail.  Part 11 deserves attention, too:  \\"The Original Wives Club\\" tells of the important but often overlooked lives of the women who kept their astronaut husbands' lives together.  They were companions and mothers, but also spokespeople for their husbands and the space program, and they were publicly-scrutinized American icons.  Very well-done.  Part 7, \\"That's All There Is,\\" is most people's favorite episode; it's the story of three friends who went to the moon on Apollo 12, perhaps the closest of all the Apollo crews. <br /> <br />What makes the whole series remarkable is not the stories of Apollo 1, Apollo 11, and Apollo 13, but rather the untold tales of the Grumman and North American folk who designed the LEM and Command Module, the flight controllers, the pad leader Guenter Wendt, and the astronauts of the later, forgotten Apollo missions. <br /> <br />At its worst, \\"From the Earth to the Moon\\" has plenty of annoying fiction and melodrama that takes time out from the \\"good stuff\\" in the series.  Fortunately, DVD players come with fast-forward buttons.  At its best, it's a top-notch tale that brings not just the stories of those on the front line, but also those of the many thousands who made Apollo come true.  Despite its flaws, it's a very good series, and I strongly recommend it.
B00000IAU3|5.0|I bought \\"No Angel\\" because of Dido's great pop-singles from \\"Life For Rent\\". Though only a few songs on the album have the immediate hit qualities that seem to be all over its successor, I was by no means disappointed with it. The songs seem to be growing on me the better I get to know them. There is something heavenly about Dido's breathy voice. I sometimes think of her a British counterpart of Suzanne Vega, though she actually does not sound like her, or like anyone else that I know of, for that matter.<br /><br />My favourites are \\"Here With Me\\", \\"Don't Think of Me\\", \\"Thank You\\" and the title track.<br /><br />\\"Thank You\\" Dido!
B00005JN2Z|4.0|\\"Collateral\\" was a very pleasant surprise in the summer of 2004. Unlike most modern suspense films, which are really just thinly disguised horror movies, \\"Collateral\\" served up adult-sized portions of stomach-twisting suspense.  <br /> <br />When hitman Vincent (Tom Cruise) steps into a yellow cab driven by Max (Jamie Foxx), it's the audience that gets taken for an often chilling ride. The film falters badly in the last third of its long running time, reverting to a standard Hollywood action formula. But until that happens, we're treated to a suspense film that is equally strong in atmosphere and in characterization. Much has been written about Jamie Foxx's \\"star-making performance\\" - but I would rate it as competent dramatic work, certainly a step up from his \\"Booty Call\\" days but nowhere near as memorable as his press agents suggest.  Tom Cruise delivers yet another overlooked virtuoso performance, on the other hand, playing a heartless killer. Cruise altered his appearance for the film, dying his hair white and wearing a powder grey suit; he looks like an angel of death, which is exactly the point. Both Foxx's and Cruise's characters have plausible, believable motivations, which adds to the fun. Foxx's Max is a mild-mannered hack whose big dreams are nothing more than a a delusion to make his life a little more bearable, and Cruise's Vincent is a reptilian sociopath, moral relativist and master manipulator. Foxx and Cruise have excellent chemistry together, and it's the interaction between those actors that help make \\"Collateral\\" a film that will be remembered years from now. <br /> <br />A two-disc set is excessive, however. I always welcome well-thought out extras, but there comes a point where too much information is shared. This is a flaw common to many of Cruise's feature films. I'm  getting tired of needless \\"special\\" editions with bonus discs. Wouldn't it be nicer (and cheaper?) if only the best extras were included on a stripped-down *single* disc? Extrasare great if a film is technically groundbreaking in some way, or if a film is adapted from a difficult novel. Neither seems to be the case here. Padding a film like this is a lot like adding demos to a reissue of a CD; it's rarely enlightening and often tedious.  <br /> <br />The hasty, Hollywood happy ending will ruin this film for many. I myself left the theater more than slightly disgusted at how Michael Mann's film backed away from its scariest implications, and retreated into action movie cliches. To me, the greatest pleasure of the film is watching the way the night-time cinematography reveals so much about two characters most of us would innocently pass by on the street. Adult pleasures like this are rare in summertime blockbusters, and should be applauded. Suspense and noir fans will definitely want to add this to their collections. Maybe next time we'll get a suspense film that doesn't cop-out near the end and give the kiddies a happy ending with a standard-issue action showdown.
B000002IWQ|4.0|It seems that we have unknown musical talents here, criticizing this wonderful album with words like \\"cheesy\\", \\"Rush's worst album\\" and so on... Yes, guys, come on : you are so talented, why don't you write songs ? Rush are sure known as an overrated band with untalented musicians (Alex who ? Geddy who ?) and an awful writer, Neil Peart : you have your chances on the road to success ! <br />Sorry, but these critics really drive me nuts : songs like \\"the speed of love\\", \\"nobody's hero\\" or \\"double agent\\" are fantastic. It's not because this album is different that it is crap ! This album is the work of an amazing band, that explores what music is all about : making people dream... <br />
0380789035|4.0|I bought this on a whim after seeing it for sale at a used bookstore. The only thing I'd read by him prior this was the amazingly funny \\"Good Omens,\\" which he co-wrote with the great Terry Pratchett. While a bit darker in tone, and not the avalance of jokes that \\"Good Omens\\" was, I was happy to find that \\"American Gods\\" was still farily humorous.<br /><br />The main character, Shadow, is set in the present day and has the same level of understanding at how the world work as we do. He lives (albiet in prison), has joys and tribuation and looks forward to getting out. Unfortunaty, the way he gets out of prison is less than ideal. With his whole world smashing around him, Mr. Wednesday offers a helping hand in the form of a job.<br /><br />Early on, Mr. Wednesday displays some... unusal qualities. It doesn't take too terribly long to figure out what he is (a god created in the minds of people long ago) and what he's trying to accomplish (surviving against modern gods)... and in doing so needs to unite all the different \\"old\\" gods.<br /><br />Shadow ends up his assistant, and as a result his perception of the world has to change. (I mean, how many people will have the television god talk to you in the form of Lucy from I love Lucy?)With his new position he sparks a lot of interest in the god sub-culture... and a lot of danger.<br /><br />Overall the book is written well. Toward the end things get a bit confusing and muddied, however, by the time the book rolls to it's conclusion, everything feels in order. The characters are mostly written well, with one exception.<br /><br />Shaddow runs into a girl named Sam. She is one of those interesting girls whom can make or break a story. Unfortunately, after her first appearance, she drifts into the background and only makes a few more appearances. She should have become a semi-main character, instead it feels like she was discarded.<br /><br />The writing does tend to feel a bit pop culture, it won't be a stunning epic. But it is a fun and enjoyable read. And unlike one reviewer tried to imply, the book isn't all violece and sex. While there are two or three graphic sex scenes, they aren't long and easy to skip over. The violence actually seems minimal for a book like this and isn't overly gruesome or reveled in.epic.

B0006MT314|5.0|I love the show since the first second and was waiting for the soundtrack to be available.It's the case now and i'm not disappointed at all!... <br />All the songs are great and some of them are inedit versions which gives more credit to this CD because it's not just a compilation,it's real mix with a spirit (the lyrics of each songs can be relate to the atmosphere of the serie and its characters). <br />As a Michelle Branch i was glad to hear her new song and can't wait for the weckers to have their album available. <br />I love bethany joy lenz's voice and was a little disappointed that her version of elswhere wasn't on the CD...But gladly,her duet with tyler hilton is!... <br />Anyway,it's a really great CD so buy it!
B000001FS3|5.0|I forgot how great this CD is. I never play it because of the extensive airplay it got on just about every radio format. You couldn't go anywhere without hearing \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\", \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\", or \\"With or Without You\\". Radio almost made me hate U2. If you had nothing but filet mignon every day you would start to hate filet mignon after awhile. But this album is a masterpiece. The key to fully appreciating it is to use your imagination and pretend you're hearing it for the first time. I did that and it blew me away. The other key to enjoying this CD is by just skipping the first three tracks and begin with \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\" which also got lots of airplay but not quite at the same level.    <br /> <br />
B000026ESX|4.0|Released in 1983, I've had this album since 1989, when it was first relased in the US, and I've never lost interest.  \\"Europe\\" captures the band at the start of their career when they were young and naive, and closest to their Deep Purple, Thin Lizzy influenced roots.  Ahh, the innocence of youth.  This album was recorded in just 2 weekends which is the strength (and weakness) of the recording. <br /> <br />I often think of this album as the little brother to \\"Wings of Tomorrow\\".  The music has good live energy and sounds very honest and uncompromised, while not having quite the same feeling of accomplishment that would've been provided by a more expensive studio production.   <br /> <br />All 9 songs are great.  \\"Seven doors hotel\\" is reason enough to buy this disc.  Long before the world outside of Sweden and Japan discovered the band, this song was a major hit in Japan and remains a classic to this day.  The ballads \\"The King will return\\" and \\"Words of wisdom\\" have much depth and charm.  \\"Boyazont\\" is a great instrumental and example of why John Norum is one of the most underrated guitarist in the history of rock.   <br /> <br />
1594200106|5.0|I have never before said this about a new novel, but I have little doubt that Zafon's 'The Shadow of the Wind' will in time attain classic status. The novel tells about the experiences of a young boy named Daniel living in Barcelona, who one day innocently comes across a book called 'The Shadow of the Wind'. After enjoying the book, he is puzzled as to why nobody, even those knowlegable in literature, seem to know anything about the novel's mysterious author - Julian Carax. It is his curiosity to discover more about the life of Julian that sets him on the path to a thrilling but equally dangerous adventure.<br /><br />The novel contains twist after twist as the story progresses, and the numerous characters, especially Daniel's hilarious friend Fermin, are all likeable. Highly recommended.
B000099T2L|5.0|Like T. Turner, Cher, C. Lauper and S. Nicks, Beyonce has an incredible vocal gift. She is a real Diva, who knows how to use her voice in a most sensuous way. She is blessed with a great vocal range, and excels on almost every cut throughout this award winning CD. The younger teen pop sensations of today need a lesson from her and her other talented contemporaries, in showing what makes a \\"True Diva.\\" She is a perfect example of one.
B0000CAXID|5.0|The Foo Fighters debut album is one of their best. Dave Grohl created the band in 1995 following the Nirvana break up and he goes with a more pop-rock approach. The album has great, catchy tunes, and it features some heavier stuff as well for the hard rocker.<br /><br />Some of the songs:<br /><br />This is a Call: This tune is an excellent opening to the album, with a very energetic, catchy chorus. It's one of the best tracks on the album.<br /><br />I'll stick around: This is the heaviest track off the album and it is also one of the best. It has a strong, upbeat feel to it with great drums.<br /><br />Big Me: This short, clean electric ballad made the Foo Fighters a success. All around good song, with a great music video.<br /><br />Alone & easy target: This is my favourite off the album. It has a wonderful guitar feel to it at the beginning, and possesses a strong chorus.
B00008S2VG|2.0|Yeah..I rather feel sorry for the aging Britney wannabe. Sounds like the old coot Madonna is trying to emulate those teen pop sensations. This CD is just not very good. It makes LAV and ROL sound actually good.
B0002NRQTS|2.0|**Note that this refers to the 2004 remaster of Presto, and not the original 1989 album.<br /><br />Presto is one of my favorite Rush albums and easily gets a five-star rating from me. And while the album's sound is quite tinny and flat, no amount of remastering is going to fix that.<br /><br />The sound quality on the remastered CD is better and clearer, I guess, but not much. Soon after I bought this, in fact, I mixed up the original CD and the remaster and could not tell which was which (the CD itself, artwork and packaging are exactly the same as in the original, with no mention of the remastering). I had to figure out the remaster from the original just by listening to the sound quality, and it was not easy to tell the two apart.<br /><br />I think I was eventually successful, but the fact that I couldn't really tell which version was which speaks volumes about how essential this is.
B0006A9FKA|3.0|After seeing the tralier on the Dawn of the Dead DVD, and after all the hype I'm sad to come to the conclusion that I was pretty disappointed with Shaun of the Dead. It definitely was not all it could've been. For one, it was only moderately funny. I only got a couple of laughs through the whole picture. Most of the parts were kind of funny, but they weren't that laugh-out-loud kind of funny I was looking for. Two, for being a \\"real zombie movie\\" it really wasn't that bloody. Either way, a horrific zombie movie or a comic zombie movie, I expect liters upon liters of blood in the movie. There was only one real bloody part towards the end in Shaun of the Dead. And the zombies didn't really remind me of zombies, they reminded me of actors playing zombies. The only thing I liked about the zombies in Shaun of the Dead was that they were slow and decrepit like George Romero orginally made them in Night of the Living Dead and the films that followed. That was about only the real justice this movie did for any of its predecessors. And  underlying the whole thing was a stagnant love story. I've said enough.
B00005JNEI|2.0|I am from Canada where a clear majority of the citizenry is against the US invasion of Iraq.  Yet, this film is an example of a contrived presentation of the \\"truth\\" that can anger a Canadian, like myself, who is already against the war before watching the film's introductory credits. <br />This film is a work of propaganda that seeks to convince its audience to agree with a particular point of view by showing a collection of carefully screened and selected snippets of \\"reality\\".   Michael Moore interviews only those US soldiers that have doubts about the war.  Mr. Moore carefully chooses to interview a mother of a fallen soldier who is emotionally traumatized and angered by the on-duty death of her child, who had VOLUNTEERED (not conscripted) into the US military.  Mr. Moore thoughtfully decides to show footage of Iraqi children killed by US aerial bombardments rather than footage of Kurds massacred by Saddam's soldiers.  Mr. Moore deliberately wants us to watch scenes of US soldiers in Iraq arresting a terrorist/insurgent suspect (who could possibly be released later on) rather than a horrific scene of Saddam's secret police abducting a political dissident (who could well \\"disappear\\" forever).  Mr. Moore degrades America's coalition of allies by listing only the smaller allies (Morocco, Coasta Rica, etc.) and not mentioning the larger allies (Britain, Australia, etc.).  Thank you Mr. Moore for showing only what you want us to watch and omitting everything else that goes against your misguided anti-Bush crusade.  None of your facts are erroneous, but there are a lot of deliberate omissions designed to give a distorted view of \\"reality\\".  Further, Mr. Moore prefers to interview women rather than men, or rather, HYSTERICAL (and irrational) women who will provoke an emotional (rather than cool and rational) response from the audience.  Why doesn't Mr. Moore interview a parent of a fallen soldier who can rationally look beyond the death and understand the \\"bigger picture\\"?  Further, it is not natural for any mother to become traumatized by the death of her baby boy even if he had died fighting a more \\"just\\" war such as the war against Nazi Germany? <br />Finally, could Mr. Moore stop demonizing the Saudis?  The Saudis are like any other people, even if one is disgusted by their method of capital punishment (public beheading) which is actually more swift and humane than death by electricution or lethal injection. <br />Yet, I will give Mr. Moore's film some stars for showing us things that one does not see on CNN, but always watch with a critical eye!  For example, one learns from the film that the Bush family has business ties with rich Saudi families such as the Bin Laden family.  Then again, I personally find nothing nefarious and shocking about this Bush family secret.  Any member of the Bush family should be free to make money by associating with persons from so-called \\"evil\\" countries as long as this is done while not holding public office.  Unpatriotic, perhaps, but certainly not unethical.
0517123207|5.0|\\"Origin of Species\\" differs from most other scientific books or original articles in that it can be understood in its original form by an average person.  When Newton wrote his Principia, only a handful of people could understand it.  It had math and it was written in Latin.  But Darwin's method is the same as Newton's:  both developed a theory which \\"explained\\" observation.  Neither gave nor claimed to give the final word.  Neither is a discussion of ethics, politics, religion. business, etc.  It was known to everyone that variation in life existed with some sets of living organisms being more akin to one another than to other sets.  Some sub-sets within a given set of organisms were able to interbreed with one another, but not with other members of the set.  Darwin attempted to explain how this happened.  Science is never \\"true\\" in the sense that <br />religion is \\"true\\".  Science does not depend upon the authority of individues.   <br />The idea that the Pope may pronounce something true and it becomes \\"true\\" is a different definition of the word \\"true\\" than Darwin or Newton or any other scientist saying someing is true--on the one hand the \\"truth\\" exists because of who made the statement, but on the (scientific) hand, the one making the statement is not relevant.   <br /> <br />Some reviewers have stated that \\"Origin of Species\\" is hard to read.  I suppose that is true compared to a novel, but compared to most scientific literature it is a piece of cake.  It is about as hard to read as \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" by Adam Smith.   <br /> <br />Darwin's work, like all science, is based upon the concept that nature is consistent over time.  To throw out Origin of Species <br />based upon the idea that God creates inconsistencies now and again to effect this purpose or that mekes no more sense than throwing out Newton, Einstein etc and physics and chemistry as well as biology.  No amount of evidence to the contrary convinces those who insist upon God's intervention because it cannot be absolutely disproved.  Such views are OK, but they are not science and must not be introduced into science classes. <br /> <br />
0790729628|2.0|I'm sorry but this movie, while it looks great, is really boring. I like Ridley Scott but 50 minutes into the movie I was ready to fall asleep. Plus the transfer pretty much sucks.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|The movie while having many strongpoints lost its appeal the minute someone told me about it. Though I do fancy films that have little or no points, and bear irrelevant characteristics to other films, I feel like my time has been wasted. I had the distinct pleasure of going over to a frinds house and having some leisure party time when the clan of visitors in the apartment desided to pop in Napolean Dynamite. My gut instinct was to give it a chance to maybe have a chance of liking it. Nay, it didnt happen. It seems that this movie is more or less mellancholy trying to be funny. The acting is good (pariculary napoleans g'd out brother and push-over uncle) but its so dull. Perhaps the only funny part is when naploean dances for his school to elect pedro but otherwise it falls flat on its face. I can understand how some people could connect with this flick but  it's certainly not for <br /> me.

B000002UJQ|5.0|\\"Ok Computer\\" deftly articulates the paranoia, anxiety, and negativism permeating a post-modern world in which the \\"technological machine\\" threatens the human element. This may come as no surprise to most people vaguely aware of the band's socio-political concerns.    However, amidst \\"Ok Computer\\"s \\"negative utopias,\\" we see a possibility for hope:    Orwell's \\"1984\\" instructs and warns against the dangers of the technological movement which instead of bridging the gaps (as it promises) among the human population, it is instead alienating mankind while stripping us of our uniqueness. For instance, with songs like \\"Let Down,\\" Thom points to the vast infrastructures of modern cities that although propagate commerce, rarely further the sense of community. The irony lies in the idea that transportation as connective devices have somehow led to an emotional and spiritual schism, a demoralizing disconnect.    Almost ten years after it was written, \\"Ok Computer\\" maintains its relevance as we may apply the same idea to the ever-expanding internet \\"community.\\"    Radiohead's \\"Ok Computer\\" shares \\"1984\\"s spirit of warning - and this is very important to note, for it is in this same spirit that the band declares that change is still possible and hope continues to exist.    So, we have hope and relevance. We have an album which has remained timeless - an album which deserves musical/literary analyzation (and does so far beyond the province of teenage interpretation).

B0002Z0EYK|5.0|Comparing Troy to Homer's Iliad will make a great difference in the outcome of a review. I noticed that most negative reviews here are a result of dissatisfaction with the changes made, and while I love the Iliad and respect canon sources just as much as any scholar, I also think it possible to enjoy a film for what it's worth.<br /><br />Yes, I know that many important elements of the original story aren't included in Troy, such as the gods and goddesses, and that a lot of characters who should've died lived and vice versa. I can understand the frustration fans of the Iliad have with Paris and Helen's escape at the end, or even the fact that Patroclus was recreated as Achilles cousin, instead of his best friend as he originally was in Homer's epic. All these changes are sins in the eyes of many expecting an accurate adaptation of this beloved classic, but for the record I also know quite a number of people (knowledgeable in all things Homer or otherwise), who were able to enjoy the film in spite of these. I happen to be one of those who enjoyed the movie, and I think that it had much to do with my expectations- or lack thereof.<br /><br />First off, Greek mythology has always been a rich source for the movie industry over the years. From Disney's animated movie Hercules to last year's Helen of Troy miniseries; from the 1956 Helen of Troy movie to the 1960's sandal and sword epics...Greek myths have also never been portrayed 100 percent faithfully to the sources and whether this is a good thing or not is a matter of debate, which I will not delve into. One thing I am certain of is that while I still love the idea of an accurate portrayal of the Trojan War onscreen, I also appreciated Troy- though it was not what everyone hoped for.<br /><br />Troy's casting choices were excellent. Brad Pitt's Achilles failed to convince during my initial viewing, but after a second and third viewing I could not see anyone else in the part. Overconfident in his abilities, invincible as a warrior and demi-godlike in appearance (yes, Achilles was a blonde), Mr. Pitt had the role pinned down. His fight scenes were the best I've seen in a long time and they were made more impressive by the fact that no stuntmen were involved in the shooting. Achilles signature fighting style was also interesting to watch and made you believe that he was indeed, `a man born to end lives.' Nowadays, when Achilles' character comes to my mind, it is Brad's face that accompanies it. Eric Bana played a very sympathetic Hector, the man you alternately root for and grieve for every time his wisdom is ignored and he is forced to obey orders against his will and better judgment. Critics were right when they said that Hector was the emotional core of the story, for the only time I cried during the movie was when Hector bade his father farewell before confronting Achilles. Orlando Bloom was perfect as the selfish and impulsive prince Paris, his fight scene with Brendan Gleeson's Menelaus one of the best after the Achilles-Hector duel. Many hated Paris' weakness and Bloom's silly facial expressions- ironically, these were what made him Paris, as Paris WAS a coward and Bloom's fear during his fight with Menelaus was altogether real and perfect. The Paris-Hector scenes were well written, and I found the chemistry between the brothers even more believable and endearing than the relationship between Paris and Helen itself.<br /><br />Brian Cox's Agamemnon was a little over the top at times, but he amused me to no end. Cox really looked like he was enjoying his part, and he took me on the ride with him. To his credit, he is the only actor who can act and look greedy while being funny and believable at the same time. Brendan Gleeson also made a satisfying Menelaus. While I disagree with the scriptwriters rendition of the jilted husband (as Menelaus was both young and a good husband who loved Helen), this has more to do with the scriptwriter's version of the character, rather than Gleeson's acting. His rage at his insulted honor was convincing and I truly felt scared for Paris during their fight.<br /><br />The supporting characters also came up to par with the main cast.<br /><br />Sean Bean portrayed a wise Odysseus whose lines are witty enough to be quoted every now and then, and the way Bean spoke also had me convinced that he was always right about everything. His intermediary role between Achilles and Agamamnon was entertaining to watch, as was his tone when exercising his powers of persuasion.<br /><br />Peter O'Toole was both mesmerizing and frustrating as Priam. Mesmerizing in the scene were he begged for Hector's body in Achilles' tent, frustrating in his disregard for Hector's opinion and dependence on the gods.<br /><br />Julie Christie had only one scene as Thetis, but she was regal enough for me to doubt that there were no goddesses in the film. She was either a goddess, or *very* close to it.<br /><br />But IMHO, Rose Byrne was the best among the female leads, considering what she had to work with. Her expanded role as Briseis is another thing many complain about, but in the interest of being objective I will say that she did very well with what she was given and held her own against Pitt himself. She also displayed more range (fear, anger, hurt, happiness, etc.) than Diana Krueger's Helen and it is no wonder that the warrior was so taken with her version of the spirited temple maid.<br /><br />Vincent Reagan was another face I could not forget while watching Troy. His portrayal of Eudorus truly defined the epitome of a supporting character, and I have no doubt that there has never been a right hand man as likeable as he. Like Briseis, he too was able to express a range of emotions- pain, fear and loyalty- and I find this impressive, given his relatively small number of scenes.<br /><br />As a whole, my only complaints with regards to the movie are the compression of events, the musical score, and a weak performance or two.<br /><br />The timing of the events, for it seemed as if the Trojan war was compressed from a span of 10 years to a period of 5 days in the movie. While 10 years may be too much of an exaggeration for translation into film, I feel that the creators of Troy could've made the war last for up to a few months, at least.<br /><br />I was also disappointed in their choice of Helen. Diane Krueger is lovely to look at (perhaps not beautiful enough to play Helen, but pretty enough to keep both Paris and myself happy), but her performance seemed flat in comparison to Byrne's. Her role may have been toned down, but I felt that Helen still had a lot of scenes where she could've displayed emotion more convincingly. Her romance with Paris was also less interesting than what Hector had with Andromache, or even what Achilles had with Briseis. On a more positive note, Krueger was very regal in her bearing, and I had no trouble believing her to be every inch a queen.<br /><br />Saffron Burrows was a likeable Andromache, another character one could look up to and sympathize with; my only complaint was that she was not given more to do. Aside from happiness with her family, the only other emotions she displayed were that of sorrow and worry, suppressed or otherwise. Still, she displayed these very convincingly- and the part where she banged her head against the wall when she knew her husband was being killed moved me.<br /><br />Garrett Hedlund's Patroclus was the worst of all performances- and this had nothing to do with his demotion from best friend to cousin. As I mentioned above, the script changes from canon are not an issue with me since I am judging the movie *in itself**. Initially, I could see what the scriptwriter was doing. Since Troy focused on Achilles and Hector largely, Benioff tried to create parallelisms between the two men at different points: Hector had a love interest in Andromache, as Achilles had in Briseis. Hector had a filial, protectiveness over Paris, as Achilles had with Patroclus. But the difference is that while Hector's brotherly love for Paris and Paris' childish dependence on Hector were very touching, the interaction between Achilles and Patroclus did not strike the same cord. Perhaps it was because Hedlund's Patroclus seemed too modern; while Pitt MADE Achilles, Hedlund did not look as if he belonged in the same era at all...in fact, he looked as if he belonged to a surfing movie...which is strange, considering that his appearance was similar to that of Pitt's. I feel that he could've also acted better in spite of how his role was written. I wanted to sympathize with young Patroclus' in Troy. I wanted to empathize with his need to fight- I wanted to feel his frustration in not being able to prove himself. Sadly, what could've been pent up fury (or an impressive display of teen angst), only came across as mere childish tantrum, which was annoying at worst and laughable at best.<br /><br />Lastly, the musical score was painful to the ear. The woman's moaning in the background was not mysterious and exotic as the composer intended...it was only strange a tad grating, which aroused my curiosity on how the original rejected score, must have sounded.<br /><br />And yet, these faults have not dimmed my enjoyment of the movie. I did not view Troy as a deep, historical epic but as a brilliant fantasy-action adventure which had a little bit of everything to keep most movie goers happy. When I made this distinction, it was possible for me to watch it without comparing it to the Iliad every five minutes. It is possible to love both the movie and the book as two *separate* things after all, and I can only hope that those who loved Troy as much as I did will now be curious enough to pick up the Iliad, learn how it differs from the movie, and even enjoy the differences in BOTH mediums.mance or two.  <br /> <br />The timing of the events, for it seemed as if the Trojan war was compressed from a span of 10 years to a period of 5 days in the movie.

Not so, with Trouble.  He takes you there.

Since Troy focused on Achilles and Hector largely, Benioff tried to create parallelisms between the two men at different points: Hector had a love interest in Andromache, as Achilles had in Briseis. Hector had a filial, protectiveness over Paris, as Achilles had with Patroclus. But the difference is that while Hector's brotherly love for Paris and Paris' childish dependence on Hector were very touching, the interaction between Achilles and Patroclus did not strike the same cord. Perhaps it was because Hedlund's Patroclus seemed too modern; while Pitt MADE Achilles, Hedlund did not look as if he belonged in the same era at all...in fact, he looked as if he belonged to a surfing movie...which is strange, considering that his appearance was similar to that of Pitt's. I feel that he could've also acted better in spite of how his role was written. I wanted to sympathize with young Patroclus' in Troy. I wanted to empathize with his need to fight- I wanted to feel his frustration in not being able to prove himself. Sadly, what could've been pent up fury (or an impressive display of teen angst), only came across as mere childish tantrum, which was annoying at worst and laughable at best. <br /> <br />Lastly, the musical score was painful to the ear. The woman's moaning in the background was not mysterious and exotic as the composer intended...it was only strange a tad grating, which aroused my curiosity on how the original rejected score, must have sounded. <br /> <br />And yet, these faults have not dimmed my enjoyment of the movie. I did not view Troy as a deep, historical epic but as a brilliant fantasy-action adventure which had a little bit of everything to keep most movie goers happy. When I made this distinction, it was possible for me to watch it without comparing it to the Iliad every five minutes. It is possible to love both the movie and the book as two *separate* things after all, and I can only hope that those who loved Troy as much as I did will now be curious enough to pick up the Iliad, learn how it differs from the movie, and even enjoy the differences in BOTH mediums.
0316172324|5.0|Having enjoyed his previous book on idea manipulation and selective networking, \\"The Tipping Point\\", I am happy to report that New Yorker columnist Malcolm Gladwell has come up with an even more interesting treatise in \\"Blink\\" about overcoming our biases against first impressions and snap judgments. Once again, he does a superb job in integrating anecdotes with some impressive research data to present his theories without pontification. I really like how he makes the seemingly obvious utterly fascinating by turning upside down our preconceptions and lifelong learnings. In fact, Gladwell sometimes runs the risk of turning his concepts into arguments against intellectual rationalization, i.e., why study and analyze anything if our gut reaction is so sound?  But before one can dismiss his thinking, the author comments repeatedly that he is not advocating abandonment of careful research. In support of that perspective, he talks specifically about the \\"Warren Harding error.\\" Voters across the nation voted for Harding for the White House because he looked and sounded so presidential. But he was poorly prepared to serve as U.S. president. Underneath the façade, he was deceptive and morally at odds with the first impressions he made on the country. Gladwell asserts that guarding oneself against this type of error is key in harnessing the power of using first impressions on important decisions.<br /><br />Consequently, it's not the gut feeling of the layman that counts but that of the expert who has been trained to feel correctly through thousands of relevant experiences. I like an example he used in relation to a Greek statue acquired with great fanfare by the Getty Museum. When the new acquisition was unveiled to renowned antiquities historian Evelyn Harrison, she blurted out, \\"I'm sorry.\\" Her instantaneous feeling that the statue was faked wasn't based on a careful examination or any quantifiable factors, just her sense that something was wrong with the artifact in front of her. As it turned out, she was right, and Harrison's two seconds uncovered a forgery that 14 months of work by the museum's team of scientists could not. The reality is that those who harness the power of first impressions most powerfully are ready to do so through years of preparation, in the science laboratory or in the realm of day-to-day life. The origins of Gladwell's book provide one of the most telling observations.  The author, who is half-Jamaican, half-Caucasian, began to build his theory based on a personal experience. When he wore his hair closely cropped, police never hassled him. When he grew an Afro, he found himself hassled more than once. He understandably wondered why were police making incorrect snap judgments based on hairstyle. Gladwell's natural curiosity about his own situation has led to this wonderful book. Strongly recommended.As it turned out, she was right, and Harrison's two seconds uncovered a forgery that 14 months of work by the museum's team of scientists could not.

0393316041|4.0|Richard Feynman's hilarious voice is very prevalent in this book, as he describes growing up fixing radio's, working in a hotel, life at MIT and Princeton and working for the military. He gives an ingenious and insightful reflection on society along with an interesting autobiography. I began reading this book afraid that I would have science concepts forced in my face, which did occur occasionally, but I was left with a feeling that I actually got to know Feynman's personality and that just a little bit of his genius rubbed off on me. Toward the end of the book I began to get a little lost by the concepts and equations while he was a professor but I do not think that was a problem in the writing, more of a lack of scientific concepts on my part. Feynman has a knack for the description and deciphering of peoples personalities, while oddly enough he complains of trouble with his social ability.   <br /> <br />Overall I enjoyed the book, more because I enjoyed Feynman's success and personality, than because I enjoyed the science.  <br />
B00070Q8DQ|4.0|It's been awhile since their last CD, but make no mistake, these guys are still setting the bar for brutal death metal for the next generation. The sound these guys give are like Morbid Angel on steroids, and they have some good songwriting with lots of tempo changes. Yah, they're mostly fast and pummelling, but they have enough variety to pull in metalheads who aren't this extreme.  <br /> <br />I don't know what it is about the sound of the drums, but it really does feel like an earthquake...like hell is opening up right in front of you.  <br /> <br />Good stuff - if you're into extreme metal, this is a necessity. <br /> <br />
B0006IIKS0|5.0|I was one of those \\"I hate Lars Ulrich, he ruined Napster!\\" kind of guys.  If you look at my other ratings, then you will notice I have given high marks to most of them.  However, this DVD has really earned 5 stars.  I wanted to see the documentary in theatres, but I missed my chance.  I bought and watched this DVD immediately upon its release.  I was impressed at how sincere Lars Ulrich is with his love for Metallica.  He doesn't appear to be as controlling as I thought he was.  It seemed that the real ego in the band is James Hetfield, who as we learn in the DVD is working on that.  I liked how they covered Metallica from James Newsted leaving to Robert Trujillo joining the band and then starting the tour.  My nephew has been really into Metallica, and I have been burned out on them since my high school days.  However, he dragged me to a Metallica concert recently.  They blew me away.  They put on a show to end all shows and really showed they appreciated the fans who were there.  They did like 4 encores and were kicked out of the venue by the management.  I have a new respect and admiration for Metallica...check out this DVD!
B00005JLEX|5.0|If you're a Seinfeld fan you will love this set.  Some of the features I've enjoyed are the Kramer entrance counter and the Jerry girlfriend counter along with the pop-up video-ish interesting facts about the show, stars etc.  The best DVD tv series boxed set ever.  Worth every cent.
020530902X|1.0|I suppose that this book might be of some use as an antidote for semi-literate Americans who've read one too many articles by William F. Buckley and decided that they'd like to posess his \\"eloquence.\\" But for anyone who thinks that written English should aspire to beauty rather than mere functionality, it's about 100 pages of the worst imaginable sanctimonius claptrap, pressed between two glossy little covers.
B0006399FS|3.0|Critics seem to automatically give a band or artist a very good review simply because of the band and not necesarrily because of the music they make. U2 is one of those bands. Critics have hailed this as an excellent album. How To Dismantle an Atomic Bomb is nothing of the sort. The songs, while well-written, lack a lot of the natural emotion heard and felt in classic U2 songs. The lyrics are all different, but Bono seems to be saying the same thing on all eleven tracks. He seems to have traded in his soaring powerful vocal delivery heard in more recent songs like Walk On and If God Will Send His Angels for a more tender, almost whiny vocal delivery. Highlights of the album include City of Blinding Lights, All Because of You, and Vertigo. As a whole, I think this album will be forgotten.
0316286850|5.0|Kevyn Aucoin,   THE  makeup genius, shows a wide array of beauty tricks, tips, and photos to help the everyday woman interested in makeup (i.e.; me!) showcase her best features.  The book and its photographs are beautiful.....such a joy to look through...........
B000001DTM|5.0|Perfect. From begining to end its perfect. Each song stands as its own achievement and the whole cd washes over you as a complete piece. Bono's lyrics have never been better, and his voice fits each song like a glove. The Edge pushes far beyond his trademark sound, and Larry Mullen and Adam Clayton keep the whole thing charging forward right from the start. More than a decade after its release it still crackles with freshness. With Achtung Baby, U2 looks at the world with weary eyes, aches with real-raw emotions, and hopes for something maybe just alittle bit better. That it was recorded from the vantage of superstardom is amazing. There is no posturing and preening, and they took a true career risk with it. Definitely their crowning achievement...and that's saying alot.
B000002H97|4.0|Metallica has searched. Metallica has destroyed. Metallica has changed. Metallica has matured. And they've never sold out (except concert halls all the time). This self-titled so-called Black Album took Metallica to new musical universes. The Metalibashers that gave the world \\"metal up your ass\\" with most unprecedented scorchers \\"Seek And Destroy\\" and \\"Whiplash,\\" evolved on this album into a band capable of diving deep into the soul to pull out melodramatic epics such as \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" and \\"The Unforgiven.\\" A Metallica first. . . and second. Not one, but two, ballads on a Metallica album!  <br /> <br />For those staunch in their view of what Metallica music should sound like, there are plenty of familiar sounding songs to appease. The classic first single \\"Enter Sandman,\\" \\"Sad But True,\\" \\"Holier Than Thou\\" and \\"Through The Never\\" are all classic Metallica. Y'know the type: big, bad, beefy, crunching, uncompromising pure heavy metal. This album isn't as instantly palatable as previous Metallica albums, but upon repeated listens, it sure is one of their finest moments ever.
B000063CMK|5.0|I took a damn long time getting around to actually listening to any Pain of Salvation, cause although I'd heard lots of praise I'd also heard some particularly intense criticism.  But, just over 2 weeks ago I just kinda randomly picked up 'Be' and was really, really impressed, once I kinda adjusted to their general sound, and quickly got the 3 studios albums prior to it.  I haven't had them all long enough to come up with a definitive judgment, but as of right know I like 'Remedy Lane' the most.  It can be pretty melodramatic, as is all of their stuff that I've heard, but the song craft is strong enough that it sucks me in.  Pain of Salvation is definitely a powerful, unique band, one of the few truly progressive 'prog' bands that I've heard, and definitely the band which has the best grasp of combining complex, dense song writing and instrumentation with melodicism and memorability.<br /><br />This is the only PoS album I've where they got the production precisely correct.  'Be' isn't quite heavy enough when it's trying to be, 'One Hour by the Concrete Lake' is to mechanical and inorganic sounding, and 'The Perfect Element I' isn't as sharp and clear sounding.  It's not as clear as 'Be' or 'One Hour...' but it's clean enough, and it doesn't compromise a thick, pulsing sound that it needs.  It's also just got their most consistent song writing of any album, and is eclectic without being self-consciously or distractingly so.  That, and it's just very consistent from beginning to end.<br /><br />'Of Two Beginnings' is just a fairly brief introduction, but it's pretty effective, particularly the first loud section, which gives you a fairly good sense of how much of the album is gonna sound.  'Ending Theme' is one of the more straightforward, normal, songs on the album, and while it's not one of the best tracks, it's still quite solid.  Nice, varied vocals with some effective spoken word stuff, and a sufficiently grandiose, memorable chorus.  Things really get going, however, with 'Fandango'.  I didn't much care for this track initially, but it may be my favorite one, now.  It's an abundantly weird track, densely layered with snaky piano lines and static-y roaring guitars, moving from whimsical to dark to romantic tone and back.  They use some weird, clipped vox which are off putting initially but provide a nice contrast to the more lyrical sections.  It does get a bit too overwrought towards the end, but it's a minor concern.  'A Trace of Blood' is a relatively typical prog-metal track, but it's a very good one.  It's  got a prominent piano part which seems out of place initially, but proves to really work, and it's got another very memorable chorus, and some particularly powerful, emotional vocal work.  The unfortunately entitled 'This Heart of Mine (I Pledge)' is the target of much criticism, and while it's the weakest track here, I don't hate it like some others do.  The first half of it is way, way too wussy and syrupy, and while the second half is damned wussy too, I actually rather like that part.  Nice melody, what can I say.  'Undertow' is a very good, dark and brooding track.  It's starts with a slow, sad and distant guitar melody and slowly builds from their, with haunting, reverberating guitars, piano and eerie, oddly distant sounding drums.  The middle section is particularly good, with the guitar playing a highly 'sadified' variant on a melody from the previous track.  One of the best tracks here.  'Rope Ends' is another dark track, with some great, heavy rhythm guitar work, and a nice progression towards the perhaps a bit overwrought, but still powerful chorus.  It's also got a nice, jazzy middle break.  'Chain Sling' is a folksy piece, but still with some rock flavor.  The main guitar melody sounds rather familiar, and is very memorable, for sure.  Not the best thing here, for sure, but still pretty good.  'Dryad of the Woods' is mostly a gentle, acoustic instrumental.  Not the most fascinating thing ever, but I like it quite a lot, anyway. The title track is another instrumental, mostly just 2 minutes of keyboard based variants on stuff from the rest of the album.  'Waking Every God' is another more straight prog-metal piece.  One of the happier works on the album, with another epic, dramatic chorus.  Not one of the very best tracks on this album, but very good by absolute standards.  'Second Love' is another power ballad-ish piece, but it's better than 'This Heart of Mine'.  There's not that much too it, but it's got a very nice chorus with some good harmonies.  'Beyond the Pale' is probably beats out 'Fandango' as my favorite track on the album.  It's just beautifully constructed, consistently compelling throughout it's ten minutes with a powerful, varied vocal performance and a nice pairing of droning, mechanistic acoustic work with a slow, bruising electric riff for the verses.  The dual chorus is great too, with the powerful, epic pre chorus giving way to the softer, more minimalistic chorus.  Very nice soloing too.  It's just a great, great song.<br /><br />Yeah, that's it.  Truly great stuff, here.I like it quite a lot, anyway.

6300151379|5.0|This is the best movie ever! I've watched it a billion times since I was about 5 years old, and it never gets old. All of the songs are great, and theres one that I love. Someone who reviewed this was right, though, about the scene where the orange firey creatures throw their heads......it scared me when I was little and my mom had to fast forward it for me! I still don't like that one part, but other than that, it's a \\"must buy!\\" I've made a few of my friends (when I got older) watch it because they had never heard of it, and they loved it too. The best!   :o)
055321263X|5.0|Wilkie Collins's The Woman in White is an excellent suspense novel written over 100 years ago.  It's 650 pages, and has the relatively wordy passages indicative of that era.  How then, you ask, could it be that suspenseful?  My response:  Read it and see!  I found myself reading 200 pages a day in it, simply refusing to put it down, as I HAD to find out what happened to these characters. <br /> <br /> <br />And speaking of characters, what about them?  Victorian novels are renowned for their character development, and this one is no exception.  The protagonist, Walter Hartwright--a drawing instructor--is the perfect English gentleman, sometimes maddeningly so.  While he explains what is happening and the proper course of action, the villains are running around wreaking their havoc.  Walter's partner in good is Marian Halcombe, the driving force of the novel.  She's more decisive than Walter, more courageous, and more determined than anyone else.  Think of her as Scarlett O'Hara, but without Scarlett's flaws.  At one point the villain even says that as long as Marian is against him, he must work harder than ever before!  The villain himself, Count Fosco, is one of the most wonderful creations in literature.  Collins melds the character--a mass of contradictions--perfectly, creating the consummate villain:  witty, urbane, knowledgeable, always ahead of the good guys, and seemingly able to be in two places at one time.  The only weak character in the novel is Laura, around whom the plot revolves.  However, even though everything hinges on her, she's not actually in the novel that much, so her lack of development is barely noticed. <br /> <br /> <br />The novel, as other reviewers have said, requires some suspension of belief.  Two unrelated women look like twins.  One of them changes so much from grief that her family doesn't recognize her.  People happen to be frequenlty at just the right place at the right time.  However, none of this seriously detracts from the novel.  The suspense is marvellous! <br /> <br /> <br />The plot is very complex.  In a very brief synopsis, Marian and Laura become the victim of an apparent perfect crime.  They and Walter must find a way out of it, as a mysterious woman in white (the titular character) seems desperate to share a secret with them.  Is it what they need?  The novel, however, is so much more than that!  As twenty narrators provide their parts in events first-hand (one picks up as the other leaves off chronologically), the suspense mounts! <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom Line:  Get this excellent suspense novel, and don't let the length or publication year deter you!  The Victorian Era adds to the great characters, each of whom is so real that I made comparisons with people I actually know.  The language, while somewhat stilted, is quite readable and intriguing, and in no way, deters from the suspense.  You'll find yourself unable to put the book down; there's a reason it hasn't gone out of print in 150 years!
B0000A7W14|5.0|The 1991 classic film \\"Boyz N The Hood\\" is an unforgettable masterpiece. \\"Boyz N The Hood\\" takes place in South Central, Los Angelas and is the story of 3 boys turning into men. The three friends, Tre, and Ricky and Doughboy, who are half brothers, have to deal with the harsh reality that is South Central and the consequences of their actions. Throughout the whole movie they deal with different choices to make in their lives and the effect of these certain choices. The movie is very touching, depressing, and can teach you a lesson all at the same time.<br /><br />You start out with Tre and some of his friends walking to school, and Tre ends up getting into a fight which lands him at his father's doorstep, due to a written agreement between him and his mother. His father, Furious Styles, tries and successfully teaches Tre to be responsible and teaches him about things he will deal with throughout his life. Ricky and Doughboy, on the other hand, don't really have anybody to teach them the ins and outs of life. This really has an affect on both of them later on in the movie. Doughboy, early in the movie, ends up in the pen at the early age of ten. 7 years pass, and Doughboy returns. It's from here when the story really picks up. It takes you through the daily lives of all 3, with Tre and Ricky trying to get into college and Doughboy hanging out all day on street corners with his friends. Toward the end of the movie, Tre's endurance is definitely put to the test, along with everything his father tought him. The ending is a serious tearjerker, or atleast it was for me. To see what happens, you'll have to rent it.<br /><br />The bonus DVD comes with a few cool extra features. It includes the awesome video \\"Growing Up In The Hood\\" by Compton's Most Wanted. It also has a nice documentary on the movie. The documentary is lengthy, and very informative on how the movie came about. Audio commentary is included on the first disc, with John Singleton, the director, talking about different parts of the movie. He claims that most of what he used in the movie was taken from his own childhood. Alot that happened in the movie did happen to him, like his father raising him and teaching him about life. The picture is good, the sound is good, everything is brilliantly crafted in the drama. Cuba Gooding Jr., Ice Cube, and Morris Chestnut do a good job at portraying Tre, Doughboy, and Ricky. Lawrence Fishburne and Angela Basset also do a good job at playing Tre's mother and father. All of the actors did a fine job at playing their roles.<br /><br />So I say atleast rent the movie, if you're still skeptical about it. It's a great movie, and will definitely keep you in your seat the whole time the movie is playing. Everything is made wonderfully, there's no doubt about it. However, if you're easily offended by racial comments, I don't think you need to watch this movie. Many racial comments are made about Caucasions, so like I said the easily offended should not view this movie. Other than that, this is a great movie that anybody could enjoy. It even adds jabs of humor throughout the movie, which kinda takes away from the drama a little bit. So, get this movie, it'll be worth your money spent.bout different parts of the movie.

B000000W6F|4.0|(4.5 Stars)    The Pumpkins' 1991 debut album \\"Gish\\" has the unfortunate duty of living in the shadow of \\"Siamese Dream\\" and \\"Mellon Collie..\\". In fact, I've heard many people wrongfully refer to \\"Siamese Dream\\" as their first album.     But \\"Gish\\" is really good. It's not as layered and experimental as \\"Siamese Dream\\" or as diverse and bombastic as \\"Mellon Collie\\" or as gorgeous as \\"Adore\\", but it's really good! Don't overlook it!    There's powerful, guitar-driven rockers like \\"I Am One\\", \\"Tristesta\\", and \\"Bury Me\\" that the Pumpkins do so well. They seem like a bit noisy and tuneless at first, but there's a lot of melodies to be uncovered.     \\"Rhinocerous\\" is a cool song that starts off all hushed and dreamy, then explodes at the end with a killer jam session. Billy Corgan may have a giant ego, but he can toss off some incredible guitar solos..and Jimmy Chamberlain has always been an awe-inspiring drummer.    \\"Suffer\\" is a hushed, moody song that never 'explodes'. Quiet through and through, and it becomes glorious after a few listens. \\"Snail\\" is even better; this wasn't even a single, but it's the most upbeat, anthematic, catchy piece of rock on here. It's one of my all time favorites from them.    Other highlights include the Eastern-tinged hard rock of \\"Siva\\", the gorgeous ballad \\"Crush\\", and the brooding, volatile \\"Window Paine\\" (which culminates in another groovy jam session).    A little hard rock, a little psychedelia, a little pop, a little artsy; that's \\"Gish\\". A terrific album. With each listen, you'll discover more and more to like about it.    Best Songs: Suffer, Snail, Siva, Crush, Rhinocerous, I Am One.
0393035158|5.0|Sam Harris' book ties it all together.   \\"The End of Faith\\" is reasonable, cogent and before its time.   This is a look at a thinking future in spiritual life; one that is possible after we get our religious lives in order.   On the twenty-fifth of January, 2005, Frontline, in the documentary \\"The Spread of Al-Quaeda\\" put on film and on television just what Sam Harris is talking about; Muslim Jihadists - most from the middle class - hijacked mentally by the fundamentalist Mosques, taking up the sword in response to the Koran.   This same behavior happens among Christians and Jews with regard to their bible.  The fault is in the dream world of scripture; it should be outlawed until it can be seen for what it is - not written by God, but flawed visions; some great poetry, some excellent ideas, but so mixed with Iron Age violence as to be a very dangerous tool indeed. <br /> <br />Harris' hopefulness is unique.   He points out that the \\"eastern religions\\" such as Buddhism have done excellent groundwork research on spiritual growth; meditative techniques that can be observed scientifically.   Harris shows that strong communities, ethical concerns and issues of spirituality are natural to human beings and do not need the ignorant detritus of the past to flower among mindfull people. <br /> <br />This book is before its time, not just because we are an age bound to scripture but because the union of eastern and western meditative spirituality has barely begun.  The West's \\"activity\\" is not all bad and Harris touches on the theme when he decries \\"passivity\\" as a mode of life.    <br /> <br />An excellent book.

I have been a fan of Sandra Boynton since I was a sticker collector in the eightier., I then laughed over and over to \\"Chocolate: the Consuming Passion\\"  and now I find her children's books are my children's favorites. Love them all but this is hands down the most popular.
B0002X314C|5.0|I hardly ever listen to an r and b album the whole way through. Only ones I ever listened to where every song was good are as follows. Marvin Gaye, Jodeci, Lauryn Hill. This album right here, John Legend. Wow!!!!  The emotion and the voice is unbelievable. I love what he has to say and my favorite is Ordinary people, How high.  But the whole album is worht listening to.  Album is just simply amazing and I am a rap person.
B00000IB4D|5.0|Wow!! This is my favorite Santana album. It is not a rock album or a fusion album but a classic improvised Jazz album with strong Latin, fusion and eastern influences.  <br /> <br />The album has John Mclaughflin (fellow Chinmoy disciple at the time) playing on some tracks including the 11 minute `Flame sky'. <br /> <br />This album has some of the most delectable jazzy songs ever done by any rock or fusion artist. Songs like 'love Devotion and surrender', 'yours is the light' and 'when I look into your eyes' are clear masterpieces. All very hard to digest initially (like the first ever taste of beer) but amazing once you get the feel of the songs. <br /> <br />There are quite a few instrumentals all very fine and interesting with the opener being relatively mundane but all the other instrumentals are really great from mellow Latin jazz to furious concoction of heady fusion in 'flame sky' where the guitar duel between Carlos and John is worth the money of the album. <br /> <br />A few important points on this album: <br /> <br />1. This is not the average Santana work, rock or from the jazzy period. One needs to here this one with an open mind. <br /> <br />2. With the exceptions of a couple of numbers the guitar is not the most prominent instrument. <br /> <br />3. Vocals are very different and mellower compared to anything you would have ever heard by the Band. <br /> <br />4. Tom Coaster on the Keyboards really shines on this one along with the rhythm section of drummer Michael Shrieve and percussionist Armando Peraza. <br /> <br />Every time I listen to `Welcome' I love it more as all the songs are great and one can find something new, interesting and amazing with every listen. <br /> <br />All in all, `Welcome' is one of those albums which cannot be compared to any other album or style because of its uniqueness.
B00003CX9E|4.0|I bought this movie expecting great things, and boy was I not disappointed! The story runs from the beginning to the end without letting up, and all the plot points are well spoken of. I don't understand why he discovers oil and becomes rich when he's so young at the beginning of the movie (not a spoiler!  it's the begining!) and cuts his parents out of the equation, but I guess this is besides the point. <br /> <br />The only real problem I have is that the it isn't a color version too. I know there's one out there because I saw it on television in the 80s. When DVD is supposed to be the definitive version aren't we allowed to choose to see color as God intended through our God-given eyes? I know everything isn't grey, althogh some people would have you believe the same. I think the black and white version is fine too it looks kinda neat but I wish we could watch any version and the magic of Dvd usually provides this, let alone the wide skinny kind and full boxy kind of movie which this also doesn't have, but I don't mind that as much because let's face it, a black and white movie would look funny if they stretched it all skinny like a color movie like 2001: a space Odyssy. <br /> <br />But I digress. I like Citizen Kane fine and recommend it to you. And I could really relate to the scene where the old man talks about seeing a hot chick on a ferry boat white dress or no because I see lots of hot women when I commute and especially at the Starbuck's, where it's like being in heaven.
0375420525|5.0|For anyone who has ever listened to Danielewski's sister Poe, and been completely enthralled by her music, this book will surely lead you to discover that talent does run in the family.  Danielewski parallels Poe's ability to draw in and captivate the audience with wonderfully beautiful and chilling language that is set to a rhythm and pace which will only suck you in further.  Don't be surprised if you sit down intending to read for an hour or so and snap out of the book to realize that you have been in there for hours.  His control of the English language is beautiful, haunting, and classic.  I feel like it is beginning to sound cliche to label it Nabokovian, only because he captures something that Nabokov himself never really did for me.  Truly stunning.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie simply stated is genious.  It is THE best movie of 2004 by far.  It is worth every penny.  And the features are great.  The deleted scenes are actually worth seeing and there are some cool features.  Maybe the only bad part about this movie is some of the soundtrack.  I thank God for a movie like this.
B00029LNHS|4.0|The Black Eyed Peas have been around for years and years trying to make themselves the biggest name in Pop. With new, vocalist Fergie, they can. This young, white woman sure can blow (not saying that offensively). Fergie, Will.I.Am, Taboo, and APL make up the weird, crazy, but Grammy deserving Black Eyed Peas! <br /> <br />1. Hands Up (4/10) - Could have been shorter to be an album intro. It isn't that good as a song. There is nothing special about it, but I listen to it time to time. <br /> <br />2. Labor Day (It's A Holiday) (7/10) - The lyrics are creative and the beat is fun! This song is hot! <br /> <br />3. Let's Get Retarded (10/10) - One of the singles from the album that almost every person in the world knows. This song is kind of corny when your parents start singing it. It's so original. <br /> <br />4. Hey Mama (10/10) - Another single from the album. I love this song. It is funky and up-tempo. It is like reggae mixed with rap and pop. <br /> <br />5. Shut Up (10/10) - YET ANOTHER single from the Black Eyed Peas. I LOVE this song. This is the song that made me go cop the album. Fergie's vocals are amazing. <br /> <br />6. Smells Like Funk (5/10) - An album filler but has a sort of fun vibe to it. Are they callin' themselves stank? <br /> <br />7. Latin Girls (20/10)!! - I LOVE this song. Although I'm not Latino, I love their ode to the beautiful Latinas all over the world. Puerto Rican, Cuban, Mexican, they are all sexy according the Peas. <br /> <br />8. Sexy (4/10) - Never really pay much attention to this song. It's basically another boring album filler although it has some soul to it. <br /> <br />9. Fly Away (9/10) - I really like this song. This is basically Fergie's song. Her soulful vocals blend in well with the Peas' hip-hop vibe. <br /> <br />10. The Boogie That Be (3/10) - Yet another album filler. When will they stop? <br /> <br />11. The APL Song (7/10) - A really deep song about APL's home country (The Philippines). <br /> <br />12. Anxiety(featuring Papa Roach) (10/10) - I love how Papa Roach and The Black Eyed Peas make Rock mixed with Hip-Hop sound so perfect together! This is a great song to listen to when you're upset or angry. \\"Feels like I just wanna turn around and bitch slap somebody!\\"\\"Lord please, please, please, take away my anxiety!\\" <br /> <br />13. Where Is The Love? (featuring Justin Timberlake) (8/10) - The most popular song from the album. It wasn't that good to me. It had a positive message, but it's kind of corny! <br /> <br />Overall Grade: B-
B000002LPD|4.0|I've never listened to any of Van Halen's other stuff, (i'm new to Van Halen) but this is a pretty sweet album.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Although this album was made of the same sessions of Kid A it sounds different and it has a different feeling to it then Kid A. This is by far the most underrated Radiohead-album, and its greatness stand in the shadows of Kid A. Well, I can say without any doubt this is my favourite RH-album.  'Packt Like Sardines In A Crushed Tin Box' was the first song I heard off of Amnesiac and was one of the main reasons why I bought this CD in the first place. Although is a quit simple song, it is amazing. The intro to the song is very good, and the rythm is danceble. The use of the different instruments is excellent, they use instruments they never used before. The lyrics are poorly but that's not important for this song. Some people though might concider this as 'bleep-bleep' on a keyboard, I say it's about time Radiohead did something totally different.  Then even a better song follows named 'Pyramid Song'. Slow paced, use of piano and beautiful vocals. Classical Radiohead you'd say, yet still different. This song is as underrated as this album.  Following is a track that many fans don't like. Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors. To be honoust I like it, to be very honoust I love it. Although I can see why alot of people hate it. If I would concider it as a song I would put in my list of favourite Radiohead-songs, but I don't call it a song. It's more like a collection of weird, fascinating and interesting sounds. Travelling comes to my mind when I heard this song. It's like a train, travelling in and out of tunnels, slowing down and going faster.   Next in line, You And Whose Army?, is more a return to the classic Radiohead, wich is again slow paced. It's good but just a little too short.   I Might Be Wrong is my favourite song on here (it's in my Radiohead top 5). It's quit accesible, also for fans who dislike Kid A and Amnesiac. It has some electro-influences but there's a guitar in it, so it still reminds of previous Radiohead. It's catchy enough to be on the radio, most catchy song on Amnesiac.  Knives Out is pure classical Radiohead-stuff, but there are alot better songs then this one on here. For me, it is one of the weakest songs here.  The remake of Morning Bell was not really neccessairy. It's not bad, but the original was better. This is the obvious link between Kid A and Amnesiac.  When you hear the promessing intro of Dollars & Cents you know it's going to be a great song. And it is. A chill-out track with an energetic climax and a nice choice of instruments.   I liked Pulk, but I don't like Haunting Bears. Some weak jambing on the strings of a guitar for 2 minutes. It's a useless track but yet listenable and not really annoying, just very useless. When I hear what kind of excellent B-sides this CD has (Kinetic, Fog, Worrywort, Meeting in the Aisle and many other outstanding B-sides) then I can't help think what the hell Thom was thinking to prefer Hunting Bears above all those excellent B-sides.   Like Spinning Plates, arguably the weirdest song on the album, and like many already know it's 'I Will' recorded backwords. So this is supposed to be weird. An experiment, but not a failed one. Extraordinary.   Finally we got Life In A Glasshouse, yet another experiment of Radiohead. It seems to be quit out of place on this mainly electronic album when you first listen to this CD, but after many listenings it fits perfectly. It's a song you got to get used to (well, at least I had to). Nice effort.  Pretty weird, yet fascinating, yet amazing,...yet Radiohead's best effort...ever...
B000003S0P|5.0|This is one of, if not the best King Crimson album. \\"Red\\" is a classic, \\"Fallen Angel\\" is dark and wry, \\"One More Red Nightmare\\" sounds decades ahead of its time, \\"Providence\\" is an adventurous improv, and \\"Starless\\" is probably the best piece that King Crimson has ever composed. This album also has the best recorded sound that this lineup managed to commit to a studio album. Very highly recommended. <br /> <br />As an additional note, I would like to correct a previous reviewer who made a comment about John Wetton's abilities; the bassist you are thinking of is Boz Burrell, from the Islands line-up, not Wetton. Wetton had already been playing bass with several other bands before King Crimson and was considered to be one of the best bassists in the UK at that time. Burrell was the bassist who Fripp had to teach. Wetton was/is an amazing bassist with a phenomenal tone and tasteful creativity. Maybe somebody could learn to play his parts in a month (though I doubt that), but there are very few people who could learn to write his parts at all to begin with.
B000092ZYX|4.0|I doubted long between giving this the perfect 5 or the still excellent 4. Turns out this is my least favourite Radiohead-album (excluding Pablo Honey that is), so it will has to be happy with 'only' 4 stars. Why isn't it perfect like their other albums you ask? It's in the details really... <br />2 + 2 = 5 -the first single- is a good track, but doesn't really fit as an opener. In my opinion a single schouldn't open the album. Anyway, I find the song very good, and it's not a bad choice to make this a first single. <br />Sit Down, Stand Up. I find it to be equally to 2+2=5, might even be a little better. Song starts of slow, but really explodes near the end. The melody is great. <br />Sail To The Moon really has to grow on you, it's not as accesible when you hear it for the first time. Very slow-paced, but sweet as candy. <br />The return of Kid A/Amnesiac on Backdrifts. The 'bleeping'-sound, that I find so good, is present during the whole song, later back-uped by a synth and a piano. Many people concider this a weak track, but I disagree heavily. It might even be a stand-out, who knows.. <br />Go To Sleep, a nice straight-forward rock-song, with the only instrument being a guitar. It certainly isn't bad, not at all, but it was wrong to choose this song as the second single. It's simply not strong enough to be a single. On the other hand, you find Thom Yorke at his lyrically best on this track. <br />Words can not discribe how heavenly Where I End And You Begin truhly is. The perfect mix of electronica and guitars. Irionically this is my favourite Radiohead-song to date. So my favourite song is on my least favourite album. My spine shivers when I hear this song. This song was the main reason why I was doubting to give this 5 stars. Only negative comment on this one is that it is way too short, I wish this would have been a 10minute-song at least. But you can't wish for everything in life, eh. And why is this no single? It's alot stronger then Go To Sleep or even 2+2=5... <br />We Suck Young Blood reminds me of Life In A Glasshouse on Amnesiac. This too had to grow alot on me before I liked it. It sounded very whiny when I first listened, but it turned out to be a good track. <br />The Gloaming starts of with a very 'thick' sound (you get pretty much the same sound if you try to drink something that is barrelly flewing. Slow paced drums get 'through' the thick sound, later fused with a light beat and then Thom starts to sing. <br />There, There -the third single- is alot stronger then Go To Sleep, and sounds like classical Radiohead. Thom's voice reminds me of 'High & Dry' on The Bends. <br />I Will is beautiful, yet too short. If this would have been just a few minutes longer this would have been perfect. Arguebly the most beautiful and touching song on the album. <br />A Punch-up At A Wedding, has a great rythm and it's fun to listen too. It's really amazing when it's played live. <br />Myxamatosis starts with a heavy sound, followed by Thom singing. Great song. <br />Scatterbrain is a stand out, and so is A Wolf At The Door wich is one of the best closing track a Radiohead-album ever had (yet, Street Spirit was a better closer on The Bends). It's the most catchy song with light vocals. <br />So why did I put one star off? Well, because all of the song are good, but not all of them are great. When I listen to this album I'm not satisfied. Still, that doesn't make this less of a great album made by Radiohead. This fits Radiohead's collection of perfect albums well. I recommend buying their other albums first, save this for the last..   <br /> <br />
0140157352|4.0|This book is a great overview of negotiation for the beginner or those interested in improving relationships in general. Advanced management types will most certainly get something from it as well.    The information is well-organized and the writing style is extremely accessible. The chapters build on each other logically and you'll get something from this book almost immediately.    Great to keep for reference, especially before big meetings. A solid addition to any manager's bookshelf.
B00004XONN|5.0|Many people are saying Kid A and Amnesiac are practically the same album. I disagree with that. I fell in love with Radiohead because of Amnesiac, and logically it's my favourite album of my Radiohead-collection. Amnesiac was the first RH-album I bought, Kid A was one of the last I bought.   Anyway, after buying Amnesiac, The Bends and Hail To The Thief I bought Kid A. My expectations were average high and I was slightly dissapointed when I listened to the whole album the first time. It wasn't bad but nothing really grabbed my attention, the only song that grabbed my attention from the beginning was 'Idioteque' wich is arguable the best track on the album.  I listened to it more often and some tracks began to interest me. The opening track -'Everything In Its Right Place'- wich I already heard before buying this album, was always a good song by my opinion. It's emotionally in a cold, frighten way and very computeralized (is that a word?). It perfectly sets the tune of Kid A. The next track that grabbed my attention was 'Motion Picture Soundtrack' that has this beautiful melody. Then all of the sudden there was this click. Suddenly I loved every song on the album, and I really mean every. The alienated title track 'Kid A' is weird and beautiful together. First it sounds like a spaceship is landing then this incredibly haunting piano comes in, together with some other 'spooky' sounds. The alienated voice makes it really complete, I just can't get enough of this song. 'The National Anthem' is probably the most energetic song on this piece of art. The use of many instruments and amazing combinations of the instruments makes this an great song. Still it didn't lose the alienated voice wich I'm thankful for.  'How To Disappear Completely' starts off with creepy and haunting sounds. This is one of the more 'rock'-songs on the album. It's very emotional, it makes you cry sometimes.   Hmmm...'Treefingers'...this is suppose to be the weak spot on this album. I wonder myself,why do Radiohead-fans dislike instrumental songs? I mean, of course it isn't the most magnificent track on here, but come on. It's a nice interlude and even as a track on itself it's good. Two 'rock'-songs follow: 'Optimistic' and 'In Limbo'. Don't fool yourself, the electronic influence isn't gone at all on those tracks. 'Optimistic' is a great song, 'In Limbo' is my least favourite, but the bleep-intro is more then nice. 'Idioteque' is my favourite on the album, and it stands in my top 10 of favourite RH-song of all time. Electronic and danceble, great beats and beautiful vocals. 'Morning Bell' is good, better then the Amnesiac-version. Now how can I write a review this long about only 10 songs?  Now, many people say Kid A and Amnesiac are twin brothers. I'd disagree. While Kid A gives me a fascinating and icy, yet nice feeling, Amnesiac gives me a warmer feeling (maybe it's the red cover of the album) and more experimental sound.   Kid A stands on third place in my Radiohead-collection.  Stand Outs: Everything In Its Right Place, Kid A, The National Anthem and Idioteque.
B0001CCXY8|5.0|when my buddy introduced me to Cannibal Corpse, i was between a rock and a hard place so to speak. my life was in shambles...my dad had just died, i was diagnosed with depression, i got fired from my job because i was so unmotivated from the depression, and my wife was threatening to leave me and take our children. so i turned to the bottle.<br /><br />the alcohol helped me for a long time, but eventually i just began binge drinking and passing out - slowly killing myself. i was spiralling down into the depths of depression, liquor, and hellish suicide. my life was as good as over.<br /><br />and then one day my friend, barry, let me borrow this Cannibal Corpse album. he said they were a truly inspiring, original death metal band, and despite my apprehensions to this type of music, i would be able to find something in it that spoke to me. it was worth a shot, right? i had nothing to lose - except for my life.<br /><br />from the minute i popped in the album, it was like a message from god. i had an epiphany that day while i was driving down the interstate. life IS worth living. without life, there can be no death; without death, no life, etc.<br /><br />my point is this: Cannibal Corpse make music so highly spiritual, intuitive, and relevant for this cultural climate that they should be canonized. if you have any interest in music whatsoever, you must own this album.<br /><br />who knows - maybe it will just save your life.
B0002OERI0|2.0|There's good news here for fans of Green Day's past singles. Most of the songs on their new concept album \\"American Idiot\\" sound like they could have easily been recorded during the 90's. Obviously, if a band has a winning formula, there's no need for a major overhaul. However, when the results are as ordinary as this, someone needs to make some dramatic changes (other than trying to string together a rock opera).  Unfortunately, the members of Green Day seem incapable of expanding their songwriting palette beyond Dookie's relatively basic perimeters, although with \\"American Idiot\\" they make a valiant  effort to do so.                    With a few notable exceptions, (don't worry, I will get to them) just about every song on \\"American Idiot\\" sounds like a distant echo of an earlier (and possibly superior) Green Day tune. If you love that sound, you'll probably dig \\"American Idiot\\". The contours of the melodies, Billie Joe's pseudo-accent, the guitar tone, the power chord changes... they all remain firmly entrenched in the patented Green Day style.  While I personally loved earlier songs like \\"She\\" and \\"J.A.R.\\", I now find myself wishing Green Day would add a few more tricks to their musical bag.               Oh sure, the boys TRY to branch out a bit here, but their musical prowess is just not up to the level of their concept-album-scale ambitions. Throwing in an acoustic guitar, or military drums, or bells, or the odd effect here and there cannot disguise the fact that this is a relatively weak batch of derivative songs, with very simple musical motifs that are usually played out by the time the first chorus ends.  Every time Green Day shows some promise in the opening bars, (\\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\", for example, sports a decent chord progression and a great guitar line) they invariably fail to develop the idea or introduce any further material that might fulfill the song's promise, a problem that began way back with singles like \\"Hitchin' a Ride\\".This is particularly damning on a track like \\"Extraordinary Girl\\" which opens with a reasonable chord progression and a fairly strong verse melody. Sadly, the boys repeat the same ideas so many times (without ever varying them or building on them in any significant way) that the song sounds repetitive and dull by the time it ends. Not good for a song that runs less than 4 minutes.             \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\", a would-be weepie, suffers a similar fate. There's nothing wrong with simplicity, but SOMETHING has to keep us interested. No doubt recognizing this, Green Day opts for bombast, and tries to distract us from  their shortcomings by speeding up the beats per minute every third song or so, and trying to sound really pissed off in the backing vocals. (Hint: it doesn't work.)             With this in mind, it doesn't surprise me that they decided to break two of the songs into 5 parts.  So many of Green Day's songs feel like unfinished ideas (or simple ideas they didn't know how to develop) that at some point they must have decided to lump a few of these odds and ends into a \\"suite\\", in an effort to create a whole new song. This does manage to generate some artificial excitement while the sections are careening headlong into each other, but it doesn't succeed for the most part because the parts seem glued together arbitrarily without any real musical cohesiveness specific to the song.  In other words, the suite's sections just sound like standard Green Day songs, albeit a bit shorter. Hence, just about any track on the album could have easily slipped into these larger compositions, which sort of defeats the purpose of even having a \\"suite\\" (except that all rock operas have to have them!)               One of the notable exceptions to all the \\"Dookie\\" deja vu on \\"American Idiot\\" is \\"Tales of Another Broken Home\\" which actually does NOT sound like a re-write of an earlier Green Day song. This is chiefly due to the fact it is a blatant re-write of Johnny Cash's \\"Ring of Fire\\", sans the catchy chorus. One of the other exceptions to the Green Day rule is \\"Are We the Waiting\\" which sounds to these ears like Billie Joe had Peter Gabriel's \\"Biko\\" on endless repeat before entering the studio.  Mind you, emulating others (even lifting a riff here and there) is no crime in and of itself.  In fact, many people (myself included) would say that it is inevitable and often desirable. The problem comes when you bring little else to the table other than what you recycle from others and what you showed up with over a decade ago.             This is not to say the album is without its pleasures: smatterings of tunefulness can be found on the anthem-like \\"I Don't Care\\" and \\"We're Coming Home Again\\". Likewise, \\"St. Jimmy\\" is an old school rocker that features an attractive coda. Ultimately, however, the unintended consequence of all this is that I found myself reaching for my old Clash records, rather than hitting the repeat button on \\"American Idiot\\".                   Speaking of the Clash, it is interesting that Billie Joe claims to be a huge Clash fan. One can only hope that he learns from his heroes on the next Green Day album, because one thing the Clash never forgot was that growth and  experimentation consists of more than just adjusting the tempo or breaking songs into 5 parts. Green Day's collective hearts are in the right place, but someone really needs to tell them that when you serve leftovers, you've got to at least spruce 'em up a bit. Hell, sometimes they're even TASTIER the nextday.  However, serving them on a different plate as a 5-course meal with a side order of election-season- induced hype doesn't really improve the recipe all that much. As Mick Jones might have said (after being forced out of the Clash), \\"Cut the crap, guys!\\"      ** stars out of *****  (fair)
B000001FTQ|2.0|If you read the Amazon review (as I did), its easy to be misled into thinking that you are getting the magnificent 14 minute version of BAD from the Live Aid concert within this EP.  It is NOT.  This is an 8 minute version from someplace else, and while its very good, it isn't special, and I would NOT have bought this if the editorial review had been clearer. <br /> <br />In fact, many of the 43 others who have written reviews are still under the impression that this is the Live Aid version, which is really unfortunate, because if this myth continues, people will still buy this for the wrong reasons. <br /> <br />The version of ASOH is not very good at all.  The two unreleased tracks are good, and perhaps could have, and maybe should have been on the Unforgettable Fire in place of a couple of the others that the band put on instead. <br /> <br />I am a big U2 fan, especially of the 1980-1988 era and am really happy that the past 4 years they have returned to there roots to some extent.  But the editorial review is a bit of a misrepresentation and I am hoping that others don't get similarly disappointed. <br /> <br />Amazon-please do not post this review to page 5. <br />
B0006AZMFM|5.0|Mistaken Identity is an exceptional album and it feels to me that you can tell Delta has put her heart and soul into this follow up to her hugley successful debut, it pays off and the result is nothing less of a masterpeice. Although I am not a HUGE Delta fan, I have to say this album is absolutley stunning, I like the darker edge to this alubm in comparison to Innocent Eyes, which while being a good album was a little too teeny bopper for me, Mistaken Identity doesnt have that sort of feel to it, the lyrics are darker and the vocals more powerful. Most of the songs on this album are beautiful, my personal faves are ELECTRIC STORM, which in my opinion is one of Delta's best songs EVER, Sanctuary, Extraordinary Day, The Analist, Miscommunication and the amazing hidden track. All in all, if you are just getting into Delta i reccomend this album over Innocent Eyes, this is Delta's finest yet. I've gotta say Delta has come a long way since the corny Born to try, she just keeps getting better, and i hope she continues to do so.
B00004HYLF|4.0|This was where many consider RTF to have peaked, and listening  to these compositions, it's quite understandable why many think that. The Fearsome Foursome pulled out al the stops and just let it rip!  <br /> <br />Chick definitely gets the best writing here (Mediaeval Overture, Romantic Warrior and Duel of the Jester and the Tyrant) with many colorful sections that somehow tie together very well, not to mention tons of colorful keyboard sounds! Each piece has very strong melodic material and never loses your interest. <br /> <br />Stanley Clarke's \\"The Magician\\" is a lot of fun with its utterly wacky and even hilarious transitions, handbells, tight ensmble play and freewheeling spirit (and even an alarm clock). Lenny White's \\"The Sorceress\\" is a smoldering and mysterious funk workout that Herbie Hancock would've been proud of, great groove and Chick gets in a smoking piano solo here. However, Al DiMeola's \\"Majestic Dance\\" doesn't fare that well compostionally compared to the others, coming off more like a riff-rock tune with some mediaeval window dressing than a fuly realized musical idea, <br /> <br />Production-wise, the recording is crisp and detailed, every instrument sparkles and shimmers, no complaints there!  <br /> <br />As far as the muscianship, these guys were MONSTERS technically, but the strongest and deepest musicality clearly comes from Chick, Stanley and Lenny in that order.  <br /> <br />To me, Al DiMeola was the weak link in the RTF chain. Yeah, he can play REEEEEEAAAALLLLYYY FAAAAASSSSSTT MMMAAAAAANNNNNNNN, but I honesly find his soloing COMPLETELY lacking in any actual ideas or flow, not to mention very one-dimensional. Basically, he's just running scales up and down at 19,000 MPH through Marshalls. Whoopee, ANYONE could do that, but it takes a very deep, thoughtful and creative soul to let off spontaneous fully-formed ideas and melodies. He does fare better in the framework of a good Corea piece far better than he did on his rather wanky solo outings. Al's best playing on here may actually be in the all acoustic \\"Romantic Warrior\\" where his excesses seem to have been toned down. <br /> <br />But my Al DiMeola rant notwithstanding, this is a VERY fun and energetic RTF set to feast your ears on.
0671027387|2.0|I loved Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code, so I thought I'd try one of Brown's earlier works. I was sorely disapoointed, as you can tell from my title. It lacked the flash and panache of his works already mentioned. Too much invention, rifles that fire ice and sand bullets, ships capable of near impossible speeds, and of course \\"black\\" helicopters firing missles at the FDR Memorial? Uh uh, I didn't buy it, but I did finish it, mostly because it was a fast read, and I didn't feel like I was devoting too much time to a mediocre book. Not that they can all be great, maybe I should have started at the beginning and worked my up, might have been pleasently surprised.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|This CD is very very good. All of the beatles number one hits on one CD, and all digitally remastered. They all sound great! Personal favorites include Let it Be and Hey Jude, but like i said, all of the songs sound great. How can you go wrong with all of their Number one hits from the U.K. and U.S.? Great CD and defitely worth buying.

B000002J09|3.0|The Beatles \\"White Album\\" <br />Pink Floyd - Dark Side Of the Moon <br />Led Zeppelin IV <br /> <br />What do these all have in common? They're arguably the 3 most lauded albums of all time. They all have some good music on them. And... they all have an aura of mystery about them. <br /> <br />Why did The Beatles choose only a plain white album cover?! It's bizarre! Is there any significance to Revoluton 9? ( I don't know but people have fun trying to find it) The mumbling at the end of I'm So Tired- play it backwards and it sounds like \\"Paul is dead man, miss him miss him\\" Freaky- and cool! Dark Side Of The Moon. Even the very name hints at something obscured. We can't see it. On The Run...from what? And why? The Great Gig in The Sky, life after death? Any Colour You Like, why's it called that? Just who is that old man carrying the sticks on the cover of Led Zeppelin IV? What do the four symbols mean? Zoso? What does it mean?! \\"The drums will shake the castle walls\\" Cool imagery! It's all so intriguing!What castle?  Page and Plant were into the occult. Maybe that's where the lyrics to Stairway To heaven came from. And who is the hermit? <br /> <br /> <br />An aura of mystery will do wonders for a bands career. Given the same songs, If Tool had ditched all the enigmatic occult stuff and sang about how much they enjoy doing DIY about the house, where would they be? And Led Zep have that enigmatic \\"quality\\" about them. (I personally think it's pretentious but that's another matter) <br /> <br /> <br />All 3 albums have that appeal of something that keeps you guessing, that goes beyond just cathcy pop songs. People like enigmatic things. It's the reason why The Mona Lisa is probably the most famous painting in the world. The enigmatic smile has captured the imagination of thew world since it was painted. And yet if you think about it,  what's so special about the Mona Lisa beyond that? Sure, it's a good painting, but compared to thousands of other paintings by mastersbfore and since, it doesn't really stand out as \\"the best painting ever done\\". But it was done by Leonardo Da Vinci, one of the greatest minds in history, so people assume he had the \\"Midas touch\\" I personally would put a dozen painters ahead of him in both technique and imagination. I could apply the same to this album
0385510454|4.0|Grisham has done much better.  I sometimes think we hold good authors to a higher standard. <br /> <br />My complaint.  Mr. Grisham needs to talk to an engineer before he starts into the technical field (just like I need to talk to a lawyer when I get into the legal field). <br /> <br />See if any of you catch the problems here: <br /> <br />A satellite hovering over Pakistan at 300 miles altitude? <br /> <br />Several Satellites moving to the North-North-East three hundred miles up traveling 120 miles per hour? <br /> <br />It would be a great honor to provide technical information for Mr. Grisham, but nobody ever seems to ask. <br /> <br />Ignoring the technical flaws (which is hard for an engineer), it is still a good book; getting better as it goes. <br /> <br />Anyway, John Grisham, ya woulda got five stars if you had called me and asked the technical questions--maybe next time you will ;-)  He's still my favorite author, for more reasons than one.
B0000CFW87|1.0|Why on earth is this guy popular? He's young, and he can sing. Big deal, my four year-old has perfect-pitch, can she make an album please? I find Josh Groban's voice so annoying, I can barely stand it. He wavers with vibrato on every single note that he holds longer than 2 seconds. I guess it's good that I am so distracted by it, so I don't notice the really bad songwriting.
B000002H33|5.0|They were like nothing that came before them, raw, fast and powerful with amazing musicianship. They took the energy and social issue laden agnst of hardcore punk rock and blended it with the tight orchastration of heavy metal. There is good reason Metallica gained the global following they have. In the beginning, they had almost no commercial exposure. They didn't start out having their music showcased to kids between cartoons on the Disney channel, like our current crop of nasal, studio tweaked pop stars. <br /> <br />Their newer works -in my opinion- are not as inspired lyrically or musically as this album. Read the other reviews people have left and you will get an idea of what this album means to the history of this band, it's fans, and finally the entire genre of music itself. This album is a more focused, polished fusion of the musical genres Metallica so skillfully began to craft in their first two releases. When \\"Hit the lights\\" appeared on the first issue of the Metal Massacre compilations you knew instantly this band was destined to change things the way they did. <br /> <br />If you actually take these reviews into consideration when buying a product on here, click on the reviewer's link \\"see all my reviews\\" before taking what they say into consideration.

B00009V7P8|5.0|I can't believe that this CD came out in mid 2003 and I am only getting around to hearing it in 2005! I buy a ridiculous number of CD's but for some reason this one passed me by and it would have been my loss. Thank God for the movie \\"Closer\\" (which I am not reviewing here) as the third song from this release (\\"The Blower's Daughter\\") plays an integral role in setting up the movie by introducing us to two of its core characters. This song is simply STUNNING! While some don't like to have their favorite songs \\"ruined\\" by third-hand imagery attached to them (via MTV, car commercials, and even movies), I for one see the upside as had it not been for this movie I may not have been introduced to what is quickly becoming one of my favorite CDs.<br /><br />Damien Rice is one hard guy to categorize and maybe that is why I am enjoying this release so much. This release has definite folk roots, but its melancholy and lushness takes it to a world of its own. Some may hear a little Coldplay, Tom Waits, Jeff Buckley, but again the similarities are just that as I am still having a hard time trying to disclose a listening experience that feels very intimate yet has a sweeping scale, and I don't remember being seduced by a release that reveals itself a little at a time. Some don't like Damien's voice and everyone has a right to their opinion, but although I tend to love powerful soul balladeers, this voice has its own unique power and intimacy rarely seen in music with commercial appeal.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this CD has got to be experienced first-hand to truly appreciate it. My feeling is that you will love it or hate it depending on how you like your music. If you only like your music within easily definable genres (R & B, pop, rock, etc.) and sung by widely recognized great vocalists (Stevie Wonder, Sam Cooke, and say Seal to name a more contemporary singer) with strong pipes, this release may not be to your liking. On the other hand, if you are open to different sounds and see beauty in things that other people may find downright annoying, this may be what the doctor ordered. I give this release a solid 5 stars based on its originality and scope. Note: I am not usually a huge fan of \\"Alternative\\"/\\"Modern Rock\\" (I hate these adjectives but the music industry has to find a way to group artists) or other groupings that are intended to say \\"not popular\\" and the fact that I like this  release so very much says more about the quality of the CD than myself.hings that other people may find downright annoying, this may be what the doctor ordered.

B000021YQV|5.0|AND BUY THIS CD!! It's one of those moments in time that everyone refers to, a time when everything stands still for something great to happen. This CD is perfection. It's a revolution. Every song is excellent. Every song is a new adventure. The political awareness and straight up ferocity it brings with a very tight production quality make it an absolute standout. Oh, it's not for the uptight, or those sensative to loud noises. <br /> <br />Maybe no one else should buy it? That way they won't get complacent like some other bands and release meaningless carp for the masses. Yeah, DON'T buy this CD. I'd rather keep this band all to myself. I hear Britney has released a greatest hits CD, you definately should give that a look. Now. Go! Search for it!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Picture your most awkward moments magnified.  Then take out the perspective you have on those moments-- you don't see how uncomfortable they are.  What can you do but love these characters?   <br /> <br />I never found their treatment to be condescending or pitiful.  Uncomfortable sometimes, but not as uncomfortable as, say, a lot of Michael Moore moments.  These characters have good hearts, and the film promotes an appreciation for that above appearances and social graces.   <br /> <br />Boring?  I couldn't take my eyes off it.  Sometimes because it was like a train wreck, sometimes because the teen plot moments caught me up.  With a 4 star average on over 500 reviews, it's worth a look.
B0006SSOHC|1.0|I'll keep it simple.  This is a trite and contrived attempt and making a thriller.  Basically the entire movie is stolen from previous thrillers like Seven.  The characters are boring and the acting is comically bad.  Danny Glover and the rest of the cast should be ashamed of themselves.  If you're like me you'll be hoping everyone dies at the end.  I love how people we're going on and on about how gross the movie was.  It was so weak. If you saw the trailer, you saw the movie.  Save yourself the time and money.

B000683VI4|5.0|This was one of the best love stories that I have ever seen, I also read the book and it was great too.  I could watch this movie over and over again, I have seen it twice.  I give it a close to first place in love stories, my first would still have to be Splendor in the grass but this one comes very close.
B000002U8G|4.0|Meddle, if theres one album you burn out to, its Pink Floyd's Meddle.Take Sauceful of Secrets, and add Dark Side and you get this very remarakable album. One of these Days has to be one of the coolest songs ever, which in some odd way, reminds me of Floyd's Sheep. Pillow of Winds is my least fav on the cd.Very poetic, but has the pulse of a wax museum.Fearless is a nice jammin song, and really stands out.San Tropez is a great track, one of the best in the cd. Seamus, is a great way to lead into Echoes, very bluesy, very odd, however, the dog has won my respect.And of course, Echoes ends it all, it just takes 24 mins. to end, but worth every minute.Whoever said Shakespear had a knack for poetry obviously hasn't heard of Roger Waters, and needs to get their head outta their ass.Wihtout this album. who knows if Dark Side would have been the way it was,good buy.
B000641Z90|4.0|I pre-ordered this DVD over a month ago and waited anxiously in anticipation.  I went to two of the concerts from the tour in Ann Arbor and Columbus.  I am a loyal fan.  HOWEVER, this whole Paris taping it wasn't the best selection.  One of my favorite duets by Phil is Separate Lives and in it he sang with both (I believe) Amy Keys and maybe Lamont Vanhook?  Anyway he used two of his singers in the song and it was AMAZING.  I only wish he would have used the same trio in his DVD.  Does anyone know where I can get ahold of that song????  My only other complaint about the tour in general was the lack of songs from Both Sides of the Story, which was a good album.  Anyway the rest of the DVD is perfect and a must-have for any and all Phil Collins fans.

0553802534|5.0|Bobby Dodge, member of the elite STOP team in Boston, MA, which deals with dangerous police situations, has just completed a grim task: as a sniper he has ended the life of a husband Jimmy Gagnon, who seemingly was on the verge of harming either his wife Catherine or his son Nathan. And to add to Bobby's distress at having to kill another man, he is immediately attacked by Jimmy's father, Judge James Gagnon, a powerful Boston personage, for acting rashly and caving in to the manipulations of Catherine.<br /><br />But what is it about the past of Bobby, Catherine, and Jimmy, and even the Judge, that has led to this point? Lisa Gardner expertly combines the unfolding of traumatic disturbances in their lives with rapid fire developments in the present. Given her history, could Catherine, one with elegant, fragile beauty, orchestrate her own husband's death? Maybe Bobby knew more about the Gagnon's then he is telling - are his actions completely innocent? Why is the Judge's and his wife's past shrouded in mystery?<br /><br />This is Lisa Gardner's best book, and most of her previous books were quite good. The plot is great and it moves. Yet the characters get the right amount of attention. And there are some nice twists. This latest effort by Gardner will disappoint few.
B0002S943O|5.0|This performance was shot during the height of Depeche Modes creativity.  <br />Visually this concert is fantastic. It was shot by Anton Corbijn, the bands long time photographer and video director. The colours are super saturated and it has that distinct grain youll find in most of Antons works.   <br />The audio is also very good. It features both 5.1 surround and 2.0 stereo mixes. There is also second disc which has tons of goodies on it. <br />Even if youre not a huge Depeche Mode fan, I highly recommend this DVD.
B0006GAOCW|3.0|Do not confuse \\"First Daughter\\" with \\"Chasing Liberty,\\" even though both films are about the daughter of the President of the United States and the title of the former was the working title of the latter.  Actually these two films are a lot closer than \\"Armageddon\\" and \\"Deep Impact,\\" but there was never a notion of the two films battling it out to be the best President's daughter movie of 2004 the way those films dueled for best object from space trying to hit the Earth movies did back in the summer of 1998.<br /><br />Having succeeded in progressing beyond the role of Joey that got her noticed on \\"Dawson's Creek\\" in films such as \\"Wonder Boys\\" and \\"Pieces of April,\\" Katie Holmes is forced to take a step backwards in this 2004 romantic comedy.  The same thing can be said for her leading man, Marc Blucas, who had his part in \\"The Alamo\\" left pretty much on the cutting room floor and is basically back to doing the Riley Finn character he played on \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\\"  Both Holmes and Blucas deserve better, but while the script is dressed up with the trappings of serious things, once you get passed those you are talking strictly predictable clich&eacute;s.  Although director Forest Whitaker adds some lyricism with the narration and opening sequence, the script keeps this one from really going anywhere good.<br /><br />Samantha Mackenzie (Holmes) is the only daughter of a first term President (Michael Keaton), and she is heading off to college during an election year.  Of course Sam yearns to be a normal kid when she arrives at the University of Redmond in California, but that is pretty hard when the school band and drunken frat boys are all doing \\"Hall to the Chief,\\" and pretty much impossible when reporters are sitting outside your dorm and you sit in class surrounded by roped off empty seats and a buffer of Secret Service agents between her and her classmates.  Sam's only initial success is in convincing her skeptical roommate, Mia Thompson (Amerie), to stick around for the fun and be the stalwart best bud through the nonsense to come.  Then she meets her new resident advisor, James Lansome (Blucas), and discovers for the first time in her life somebody with who she can be herself.<br /><br />The only problem with that is that given the political world in which she grew up it is hard to believe that Samantha Mackenzie ever had the chance to develop a real sense of self.  However, \\"First Daughter\\" has a bigger problem in trying to keep things real.  Since I started voting for President there have been a lot of teenage daughters in the White House, from Amy Carter to Chelsea Clinton and the Bush twins, and the basic rule has been to leave them alone (remember when \\"Saturday Night Live\\" apologized for making jokes about Chelsea?).  Clearly one source of inspiration for this movie has been the exception to this rule, which is when a first daughter is busted for underage drinking, because as we all know if a teenage girl makes a major mistake like that it is fodder for the national grist mill.<br /><br />But \\"First Daughter\\" jumps the gun on this one.  This is a film that has Joan Rivers making a joke about Sam looking like a terrorist had dressed her while the President is making thinly veiled references to exactly that possibility.  Even Jay Leno is making jokes on \\"The Tonight Show\\" about the way this teenage girl dresses before she actually does anything to embarrass her parents.  The justification is that Sam is a target throughout the entire film.  Students protesting her father's administration feel free to call her out on the quad and reporters with their cameras are apparently allowed to camp out in front of her dorm, when they are not stalking her out on the streets.  Yet in the real world such things would not be allowed and first daughters tend to be surrounded by a cadre of friends who fiercly protect their privacy.<br /><br />There is a moment in \\"First Daughter\\" where the film touches us when Sam is out jogging with her secret service detail, stops running, and breaks down.  The agents keep their distance and the sense of the painful bubble of isolation in which she lives her all too public life becomes palatable.  Her life has reached rock bottom at that point and as the rest of the film quickly plays by the numbers without trying to build on the emotions it has finally revealed.  Sam's mother (Margaret Colin) turns out to be a political Machiavelli, the election becomes more important than education, and the last act of the film disintegrates into real basic connect the dots to hurry along to the ending (despite some nice moments by Keaton).  Throughout the film Sam is being urged to say what she thinks and not what is written for her, but the big payoff for this I was expecting never showed up.  Then there is the final shot of the movie, which is supposed to be the requisite happy ending.  But ask yourself if Samantha really wants to be doing what she is doing given what she is wearing and what time it is?  Just so you know, the answers to both parts of the question would be \\"No.\\"<br /><br />In terms of the obvious double-bill with \\"Chasing Liberty,\\" it would be interesting to see which one you like best because both films have pretty good chemistry between the boy and the girl but suffer from weak scripts and less than satisfactory endings.  In fact, the way both films jump to the (semi) \\"happy\\" ending is a rather odd coincidence, which is a strange complaint given they both have the same semi-shocking revelation.  I like Holmes' performance a bit more and the running gags with the secret service agents in this one, but the other film has better locations and more interesting supporting characters.  However, if these films did not have Katie Holmes and Mandy Moore as their starts I shudder to think that they would have each lost another star and have descended to the level of not worth watching., and breaks down.

0156027321|5.0|This book reminds me of a good joke...no, no, don't get me wrong now, my '5 stars' rating is correct.  It's like a good joke because of its structure. <br /> <br />The book is divided into three sections, as a good joke should be.  First is the set-up; the story of Pi's life in Pondicherry.  The second section is the meat, or more importantly the means to the third section.  The third section is the 'punch line' or the slap in the face.  The shot across the bow. <br /> <br />The book makes you question the purpose of stories.  As with everything throughout the story it is divided into two sides; science/biology and religion.  The two stories involved in this book (section 2 and part of section 3) are representative of the two sides.  Religion is big and full.  Science is bare-bones.  In a way it's like 'Total Recall' where it's easy to mull over for a life time what really happened.  The ultimate point is is that it doesn't matter.

It just makes common sense to me and I grew up in Montana where my dad used to buy a whole cow and have someone butcher it up for us to stick in the freezer. Now he's had lung cancer (asbetos from work) and he had a stroke 2 summers ago. I hope that this book knocks some sense into the people supporting the high animal protein way of life.
0062502182|5.0|<br />Most people who pick up this book are not going to walk away enlightened, enriched, or even entertained.  The select few who are totally floored by it are the people who have a connection to the \\"soul of the world\\" and a \\"personal legend\\" they are likely trying to follow - just like the main character.  This book is worth a shot to anyone who thinks they might be able to enjoy it, because what you might get out of it is far more than what you have to loose.   <br /> <br />The sentence structure and vocabulary of the book makes it an easy read, however the message it's conveying and the thoughts that are being passed along are the deepest and most complex of unexplainable feelings and encounters that could ever exist.
B00004WLXZ|5.0|Important to see for many reasons, \\"Triumph of the Will\\" is a masterful example of cinematography, the forerunner of propaganda \\"documentaries\\", and a remarkable piece of history, where we get to see some of the most sinister men that ever lived, and the world of extravagance and power  that surrounded them.<br />We also get to see a seemingly hypnotized people, who took pride in what was going on in their country, and women who gazed adoringly at a strange weaselly looking man with a cowlick and silly mustache. The people who went along with all this were the same people who read Goethe and listened to Beethoven...one of the most highly cultured, civilized people of recent history, proving that intelligence and education does not prevent brainwashing or political madness and evil.<br /><br />Filmed on September 4 - 10, 1934, there is tremendous symbolism used, starting with the aerial footage of Hitler arriving in Nuremberg, through the clouds, as though he were a god coming to save his people. For those who viewed this film in Germany during the mid to late '30s who had never been on an airplane, this footage must have been spectacular; also marvelous are the views of the city seen from the air, so much of it since bombed, and then re-built.<br />Like all propagandists, Riefenstahl started with the message, and spliced and diced her film to fit it...she just did a better job of it than anyone else has since, and unfortunately, it ruined her career as a filmmaker, and as she would say later, it \\"cast a shadow\\" over her life,<br /><br />The vastness of the scenes has never been achieved in any Hollywood epic...the ocean of saluting arms, the endless line of marching men, the sheer enormity of the \\"Commemoration of the Dead\\" ceremony, where Riefenstahl had cameras set up high for panoramic views, and where Hitler gave one of his fiery speeches.  There are also a multitude of happy, tow-headed children, strong, firm-jawed youths, and those salivating women looking at Hitler. This is a trip down the rabbit-hole, and a strong reminder that as George Santayana said, \\"Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it\\".<br /><br />It is fascinating to watch this with the added commentary by historian Dr. Anthony Santoro, which sheds a lot of light on the events, as well as watching it with subtitles, and if you want to get the full impact, view it with no subtitles, just the German and the rather Wagnerian soundtrack.

B0006IJ5PM|4.0|\\"Friday Night Football\\" tells a sports story about a sports crazy town in West Texas. Well I've played football and I live in Texas. Was it really like that? Was so much expected out of the team and the coach? Was it really so coercive? Odessa Permian was in a football crazy town. I have no doubt that the idea was win at almost any cost.<br /><br />What about some of the other facts in the story? Odessa Permian and Midland Lee have long been bitter rivals. Something that does not come out in the story is that Midland is largely whitecollar workers compared to the bluecollar workers in Odessa. In the story, Permian defeats Marshall 45 to 7. Uh... that one did not happen. Mighty Permian lost that game in East Texas.<br /><br />Did Permian lose to Dallas Carter in the finals and then win the next year? Well, yes and no. Permian did lose to Carter and then win state the next year. However another fact that does not come out in the story is that Carter had to forfeit its *entire* season due to an inelligible player.<br /><br />These historical inaccuracies are interesting, but they do not compare with those of \\"Housiers\\" or \\"Remember the Titans.\\" Other than that, it's a good sports movie.
B0002IU988|5.0|I'm convinced this album will be revered many years down the road. Why? Because it's got alot of upside. For starters, \\"One Day Remains\\" has great production values. The album has a big asskicking sound, not to mention the amazing musicianship. The guitarwork of Mark Tremonti is killer. Sometimes flamoyant and sometimes heavy as rolling thunder (Check out \\"Watch Your Words\\" to see what I mean). I was never a fan of Creed so I didn't notice what a talent he was before. The vocals are also dead on (with a smattering of Robert Plant methinks)and the lyrics are insightful and sometimes cryptic (ie: \\"I will kill what hurts with something pure\\" from \\"Find the Real\\"). Everything seems carefully measured on this album. The songs have a little more breadth to them than alot of the stuff I hear lately. They're a little longer, lusher and painstaking in detail. It's just a fun album to listen to over and over.<br /><br />Now for the downside. \\"Down to My Last\\" is very generic sounding with nary a hook in sight and \\"Open Your Eyes\\" is an overrated single, but I've never heard a flawless record before... I don't believe there is one (Slip from Quicksand is close).<br /><br />Even if this band becomes huge and hated because of it, I will always admit I rocked out to this album. I could never deny it.
0385510454|2.0|I wish I could say that \\"The Broker\\" is worth reading, but it's really not.  The plot is predictable and the pacing poor.  As for the setting in Bologna -- one of the main reasons I bought the book -- Grisham really does not do the city justice.  Bologna is Italy's great non-tourist city.  Amazing food.  The arcades.  A vibrant university culture.  Grisham touches on all of that but doesn't really capture the city. <br /> <br />His hero -- Joel/Marco is a schmuck and the ending makes no sense at all.
B000002R48|4.0|This is it, the debut of one of the greatest bands in history. There are two members present in this CD that do not form a part of current Dream Theater which are Kevin Moore (keyboards) who unexpectedly quit because of \\"musical differences\\" and the other one, perhaps the most important one because he changes completely the sound is singer Charlie Dominici. Dream Theater fired him after WDADU because he had a different idea of what this band should become. After that, James LaBrie was hired to sing in Images and Words (if you are new to Dream Theater, you should start with IAW, not with this one) and has done so in the rest of their albums.  <br />The fact that all musicians were rookies makes the music present quite impressive. I think most MTV \\"hit-bands\\" can't do half of what Dream Theater did in their debut. However, I give it four stars because of the terrible sound. I mean, When Dream and Day Unite was released in 1989. There is no reason why it should be that bad. Just like another reviewer said, even Rush 2112 (1976) sounded better.  <br />Even though, out of the eight songs, I consider four of them to be superb.  A Fortune in Lies, the one which opens the album, Ytse Jam, the only instrumental song in this album (their next instrumental was until Awake (1994) called Erotomania), The Killing Hand, and Only a Matter of Time.  <br />Ytse Jam may sound to you like a strange name for a song, but it is actually Majesty backwards, which would have been the name of Dream Theater had it not been for a band with the same name who told the band members to change the name.  <br />As I said before, if you are new to Dream Theater, don't start with When Dream and Day Unite, even though it is their debut. Buy Images and Words (1992), and then follow the rest of them in chronological order. This CD contains a way-too-80's sound which is not characteristic of Dream Theater. This CD is for those who already have an idea of what this band is capable of doing, and just want tosee how it all started.

0152164154|4.0|At first I wasn't crazy about the book.  I first read Le Petit Prince in my Grade 12 French class.  I thought it was going to be a little silly story.  Well, I learned 2 lessons--don't judge a book by its cover and don't judge a book until you have finished reading it!  I found that this story, with its silly characters and planets, held a deep message that not even a highly philosophical book could express.  The story is a refreshing change--one with characteristics of a children's story and yet one with a serious message for \\"les grandes personnes\\"!  It really grew on me!  So I encourage you, when reading the book to: sit back and relax, rediscover your imagination and learn a lesson or two!!!
B00063MBU8|4.0|Even though this cd might not seem worth it because it only has eleven tracks I would still recommend it. The lyrics are catchy and they have a good beat until songs 8-11 then it turns into slow boring songs that fade together.  <br /> <br /> 1. Shut Up is a good song that many can relate to. Great lyrics and a great beat. <br /> 2.Welcome to my Life their hit single is good you wouldn't want to skip over that song. <br /> 3. Perfect World is an o.k. song they keep repeating themselves over and over to many times. <br /> 4.Thank You is a wonderful song. It's pretty short but the gutarists make it great. <br /> 5.Me Against the World is my favorite it will really get you moving the drummer is great plus the lyrics make it overall the best. <br /> 6.Crazy it talks about good issues and how people act toward other people. Love it! <br /> 7. Jump this really makes you want to jump. Awesome beat and rythm.  <br />    After that I just start the cd over again. If you were a fan of the first cd then I would defenetly BUY THIS! Great cd to listen to on trips and to work and back.
0953104907|5.0|This book is excellent. No, it will NOT take you step-by-step through building a cookie-cutter guitar. It will not show you how to copy a Les Paul or a Telecaster. It will not show you how to use that new jointer you just purchased from Sears. It does not contain wiring schematics for every single pickup and control combination. What it WILL give you are the fundamental techniques used in the construction of a solid-body electric guitar with a style of your own choosing. The three basic styles of guitar are presented: set-neck, bolt-on neck, and neck-through. Mr. Hiscock is not going to hold your hand nor would I expect him to do so. His style is to impart the important fundamentals and details of guitar construction and leave the design work and heavy lifting up to you. If you cannot understand this book or how it is written, you should not be allowed to use power tools, either. There are plenty of basic woodworking books on the market to get you started with basic carpentry, too. There are hundreds of sample measurements and router template tracings included as well. This book is a great combination with Dan Erlewine's Guitar Player Repair Guide. If you have experience in woodworking and some basic familiarity with electric guitars, this is a great book. If you're 15 years old and have never owned or used shop woodworking equipment and electric guitars, this book will not work for you until you have some basic woodworking skills.
B000050HTO|1.0|Yo gang, what id down?? When i buy albums, I expect to be familiar with most of the songs either from MTV or from being played on the radio!! Well a guy at the check out line at the super market who looked like a cross between Gary Glitter and Gary Barlow said I should check into Dylan for some hopping tunes!! Wow, that was a big mistake, as the music was not only boring but none of the songs were ever played on radio or mtv, I felt so ripped off!! This is just my opinion and everyone will have different views on any type of music because it is purely subjective. However I think he is an awful singer who is trying to be Mariah Carey but isn't in the same league. His version of Tambourine Man is truly appalling and is an insult to the Byrds original. I very much like him as a person but as an artist Dylan needs to totally re-evaluate himself before he is taken seriously... His pronunciation is terrible, on most songs, you can't decipher the words at all. <br />It is just terrible in a way that mere words CANNOT describe... You have to hear it to understand and when you are done you will wish you could erase the memory from your mind and hearing. <br />This self-reverential posing/preening/touching is wholly inappropriate. Made worse with the breathy start/screechy finish of his vocal performance No comprehension whatsoever. I'm embarrassed for him. He's arrogant. He has called himself the future of music. He wants to be the richest person in the world in the next few years. That's impossible. He would have to literally sell BILLIONS of albums, which will never happen. He doesn't care about the fans. WAKE UP PEOPLE! All he cares about is that his album sells and everyone eats up his insipid music.  <br />Okay, I don't want to come in here all jumping to conclusions, so I listened to the album so I'm not unfairly judging him. I have to sound spiteful, but I hope his commercial decline begins with his next album and I'll like it. Before you accuse me of being jealous, know that I'm too mature and self-fulfilled to be jealous of some singer. Thank you for reading this. At least you took the time to get the perspective of a non-fan. <br />People like Dylan disapoint me, in that in certain lyrics they can be Mr.Wonderful, and in others they can be a total pig. Whoever thinks Dylan actually MEANS any of the romatic things he says is quite foolish. <br />Perhaps Im being a bit harsh, having seen him live Dylan's a not very talented dude, he sings badly, but suprisingly is a very slick dancer, but he still puts on a poor show. <br />Having seen this guy recently \\"perform\\" on stage and it had to be the most boring thing I've seen since Usher!! I've never heard music so bland, slow, corporate, and just downright dumb!! Also I was never fond of this guy, that comment he made about Gary Barlow in the late 90's forever scared his credibility as far as I'm concerned.  <br />People complain that this record is too arrogant, too over produced, too big, and in some ways they are right.  many people may have difficulty relating to the theme of egomania that runs through many of the songs or perhaps it's just that the album lacks balance not enough variation from the grandios, lumbering anthems that make up the majority of the material. This album is just horrible. Bob sounds like a girl singing (and hes not even good at that). After all I've seen, and after all I've heard, Bob Dylan is garbage. He's a disgusting man who needs to be rescued from the sleez he is. <br />To sum up, Tamborine Man made me think I would like this cd but aside from that song the rest of this album is boring, trite, badly sung, badly written, boring, (I know I said that already, but damn, this is one boring album which needs some editing!) <br /> <br />
B0000029AP|5.0|Toys in the Attic is simply a masterpiece and a prime example of true talent and excellent music. This is where Aerosmith made it big. Every song on here is a stand-out. The tracklist is as follows with my personal ratings: <br /> <br />-Toys in the Attic - 4/5 - Really good, but gets old after a while. <br /> <br />-Uncle Salty - 5/5 - Excellent guitar work and Steven Tyler does good without screaming on this one. It's very good. <br /> <br />-Adam's Apple - 5/5 Awesome guitar courtesy of Joe Perry. Nice vocals from Steven. It talks about Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden and it's pretty cool. <br /> <br />-Walk this Way - 3/5 - Now I know what you're all thinking. \\"Oh great! It's that song they did with Run-DMC, right?\\" Wrong. This is the original \\"Walk this Way\\" which is just them, not the Run-DMC version. It is good, but I don't like it as much as the other tracks because I'm so used to the Run-DMC version released in the '80s. I don't really like the chorus of them singing the words \\"Walk this Way\\" because it's not Steven screaming like we're used to with the Run-DMC version. But it's okay nonetheless. <br /> <br />-Big Ten Inch Record - 5/5 - Shrot, funny, song, that sounds like it was made in th 50s. <br /> <br />-Sweet Emotion - 5/5 - I love this song. It never gets old. This song is just amazing. It's really really cool and never gets old. Excellent job on the guitars and vocals. <br /> <br />-No More No More - 5/5 - Excellent song, good lyrics and instumentals by Steven and the rest of the group. The vocals seem to fit right in the instruments perfectly. It's awesome! <br /> <br />-Round and Round - 3/5 - Well, this really doesn't make much sense. Maybe it was a side-effect of the drugs or something, but this song is just weird. It's good, though. And kinda gives you the same feeling you got when you first heard The Beatles' \\"I Am the Walrus.\\" It's like, \\"Hey, this doesn't make any sense, but it sounds pretty cool, so I guess it's a pretty good song. Notsomething I listen to a lot, though. <br /> <br />-You See Me Crying - 5/5 - Unlike most of Aerosmith's songs, this one is a slow song, where Steven sings like he's never sung before here. It's nice, slow, and never gets old unless you don't like the occasional slow song. It reminds me of The Beatles' \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" with the piano and all. <br /> <br />All in all, once you've heard this album, you're going to listen to it over and over. It's a classic and always will be a classic. Once you hear this, you will be wanting to hear a lot of Aerosmith's other work, too. This is a masterpiece!
B000641Z90|5.0|Im 17 Years old. And i Must Say, that this i very well a dvd to own if you are a phil collins fan. I also have to state that i dont like the way you cant play all of the videos at once. But who i really dont care. Now if he only gets back together with Genesis. Phil will always Rule.
0316666343|3.0|I thought the Lovely Bones had a fascinating idea for a story line, but the author could have done so much more with it.  It is well written, yet the maturity of the narrator is unrealistic.  The mother got on my nerves the most.  The characters were too thrown together and could have been so much deeper with one another. <br /> <br />The absolute zero reference to God or a higher power was very distracting.  I mean, if your entire story is about a taboo like death or an afterlife, you have to mention something about \\"God\\".  Heaven is such an unexplored area and she had the opportunity to describe it through a child's eyes, yet was reluctant to do so.   <br /> <br />I did enjoy reading the book but was fairly disappointed when I had finished.  So much potential!!!
B00013RC9I|4.0|Unfortunately, some silly billys with brain defects have posted reviews giving this piece of brilliance (and one of the best albums of 2004) something less than three stars...but that is okay, since it is up to you, discerning music listener, to simply listen to this album (preferably with headphones, it is definitely a headphone experience)and hear it for the work of goodness that it is (the duo is French too, which might help you feel like marginally less of a philistine as you listen to it.) Venus and Cherry Blossom Girl are hopelessly romantic works of shimmering pop that serve as a good introduction to the rest of the album. Everwhere you look, you are surrounded by Nigel Godrich's fantastic production, better than usual here (if such a thing is actually possible for Godrich...listen to Radiohead's \\"OK Computer\\", Travis' \\"The Man Who\\" and Beck's \\"Seachange\\" to hear the magic he has worked on other artists albums...they're all headphone experiences too.) Then there is the instrumentation-banjos on \\"Biological\\", the tuneful whistling throughout \\"Alpha Beta Gaga\\", piano on \\"Mike Mills\\". It's just a fantastic album.
B000066C1N|5.0|I`m completely amazed to see so many websites and reviewers bash this album. Obviously, too many are too busy bashing Adams Voice to listen to the music, because its really great. Hans Zimmer and Bryan Adams is actually quite a good combinatino, because of Zimmers Past. The pairing of Zimmer and Adams have in this case crafted several great pop rockers, with some classic memorable Zimmer Instrumentals. Maybe most reviewers have become too cocky to see the fun and spirit in this album, but I know many listeneres who does. Great songs like \\"Here I am\\", \\"I Will Always Return\\", \\"You Cant Take Me\\", \\"Brothers in the Sun\\", \\"This is where I belong\\" and \\"Sound the Bugle\\" makes the Adams part far better than even his normal studio albums. It could be because of Zimmer though, but it sounds great,it is catchy and it is wonderful. \\"Sound the Bugle\\" is a beautiful and haunting song, one of the best Adams have ever sung. <br /> <br />The Instrumental parts are a joy for fans of Zimmers lighter and older scores where his need for experimentation wasnt so big. The focus is on creating rolling themes, rich soundscapes and memorable melodies, something Zimmer has strayed away from lately.  <br /> <br />I definitely recommend this album to fans of both Adams and Zimmer.
B0002858YS|3.0|This album is just hopelessly overrated-the first four tracks are not bad, but after that things fall apart as The Killers run out of memorable ideas. The final track Everything Will Be Alright is aimless filler, while those in the UK got put through hell with the inclusion of the horrible track Indie Rock 'n' Roll replacing the far superior Change Your Mind. All in all, Hot Fuss suffers from feeling like too much style over substance, and for putting all the singles and best tracks at the start, with the lesser efforts weighted towards the end.
B000002LGW|4.0|OK, it's a live album that contains some of their greatest and most well known hits from the 80's.  But there is something special about this album.  Could it be the fact that there are over 100,000 fans screaming to every song?  Or is it the fact that DP take all of these songs to another level because of them?  It's both really. Songs like \\"Master and Servent\\", \\"Stripped\\" and \\"Behind The Wheel\\" sound even better then their original studio counterparts.  The best, however must be \\"Shake The Disease\\" which gives me goosebumps every time I hear it.  Dave Gahan's voice with Martin Gore's backup vocals are just mind numbing.  Yes, some of the music is outdated sounding (\\"Just Can't Get Enough\\" comes to mind, though still a foot tap worthy song).  But when the crowd starts singing \\"...the grabbing hands grab all they can, everything counts in large amounts\\" at the end of this disk, the emotion and power this \\"synth\\" band has over their audience is unmatched even today.  So to say that this album is DP's greatest achievement really isn't that much of a stretch.  If you have seen the 101 movie with Dave G. just bursting in to tears, he had to realize that it would never get any better then this concert was.  In some ways, it's a correct statement.
B000002L7R|4.0|Typical of Prince to all but dare his newfound \\"fans\\" who climbed on the bandwagon during \\"Purple Rain\\" to buy this inconsistent neo-psychadelic effort - fans like me who were into him during \\"Dirty Mind\\" and even before knew what was in store: everything but the kitchen sink!  Many of these tracks are weak, drag on, or overblown, but buy it simply for the three great traxx: top of the list is the manic, off-kilter stone-cold funky TAMBORINE - one of Prince's most demented, yet potent jams - WOW!  Pop confections like \\"Rasberry Beret\\" and \\"Pop Life\\" run close second - both are perfect radio-friendly singles that scored big - Prince knows how to write a hook, but he also indulges his own tangents - I just wish he could write songs as tight and simple and perfect now...can he still?  Dunno - let's pull some more 80s nuggets outta the vault!
1594200106|2.0|I was never in my life so glad to have finished a book!  It was sheer torture from the first page, but I endured it to the end, thinking something really surprising and worthwhile had to come out of such a lengthy, convoluted and depressing narration.  But nothing!  No convincing characterizations, no historical insights, no heart-rending love story, no thrilling eroticism, no genial plot.  On the other hand: too contrived, too many characters (that are never fully developed), too illogical, too dismal.<br /><br />I was rather intrigued in the beginning, which emphasized the boy's yearning for his dead mother.  I expected this to be the red line throughout the book, but instead the line becomes just a hazy memory as the boy moves on to his strange infatuation with a beautiful blind girl and then later on to his unconvincingly intense relationship with the soulless Bea.<br /><br />You get the feeling that the author wrote scene to scene, thinking that now it was about time to have a romance, now a murder, now a bit of mystery.  Apparently he also took too much too heart his creative writing teacher's advice to \\"complicate, complicate!\\"<br /><br />Sorry, but there are too many good books out there to praise this one.  Zafon can write, that is sure, and Fermin's language was witty, but if I were an editor I'd suggest a thorough rewrite here:  he needs to simplify (and at the same time strengthen) his plot structure.  He also needs to reduce the number of characters and consequently give these more space, and life.
B000002KMV|5.0|True Prince fans pre-Purple Rain own and love this one - I don't understand the many reviews on this site bagging the CD as \\"uneven\\" or \\"poor\\" - HELLO?!  This was released way back in 1981, post-DIRTY MIND, but pre-1999, before Prince would breakthrough as one of the first artists on MTV (with 1999/Little Red Corvette), but it's on \\"Controversy\\" he truly hones his trademark musical style, image, and vision - look at the \\"cheap\\" version of the signature purple trenchcoat that would later become glitzy - all the tracks are stripped down and potent blasts of socio-sexual-political electro-funk NO ONE else dared to produce/release at the time - listen to CONTROVERSY (the full version w/ prayer!), SEXUALITY, PRIVATE JOY, JACK U OFF, ANNIE CHRISTIAN, LET'S WORK, and more to know where Prince's head was at during the early 80s - side two (yes, remember LPs) is a bit more experimental and off the mark, but STILL you gotta give it up for the Purple One - hurry up, someone remake PRIVATE JOY today (Gwen? Britney?) and have a #1 hit all over again...and you cannot forgot those like me who bought the original LP when it first came out were treated to a ltd. editon POSTER of PRINCE almost butt-nekkid in the shower with his cross - YOWZAH!!
0553256491|4.0|If you have ever wondered how a dishonest, drunken, whoremongering, bar-room-brawling junkie can also be a Nobel-prize-winning physicist then this book will provide the answer. <br /> <br />At least Feynman was not boring. Considering how many physicists nowadays are, this is no small thing. <br />
B0006B2A2E|5.0|Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind represents those few movies that come out every so once in a while that represent a truly unique and original idea, no remake or sequel is going to accomplish this, but when the writing credits are attributed to Charlie Kaufman, the genius behind Being John Malkovich and Adaptation and the director is Michel Gondry, you now have the talent that is ideal for creating a movie with warmth, comedy, and an ingenious plot.<br /><br />  This is the story of a guy, Joel (Jim Carrey), who discovers that his long-time girlfriend, Clementine (Kate Winslet), has undergone a psychiatrist's (Tom Wilkinson) experimental procedure in which all of her memory of Joel is removed, after the couple has tried for years to get their relationship working fluidly. Frustrated by the idea of still being in love with a woman who doesn't remember their time together, Joel agrees to undergo the procedure as well, to erase his memories of Clementine. The film, which takes place mostly within Joel's mind, follows his memories of Clementine backwards in time as each recent memory is replaced, and the procedure then goes on to the previous one, which is likewise seen, and then erased. Once the process starts, however, Joel realizes he doesn't really want to forget Clementine and that their love was real, so he starts smuggling her away into parts of his memory where she doesn't belong which alters other things about his memories as well, Dr. Mierzwiak and his crew (Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood) however chase him through the maze of his memories, leading Joel to take desperate measures, hiding Clementine in obsolete, long forgotten childhood memories, some of which  are embarrassing moments. Interestingly enough however the beginning of the film loops back at the end as surprises galore end up affecting all the characters, some good, some bad.<br /><br />  The main theme is basically that of accepting faults in one another and giving love a chance. Realizing our own faults in a relationship and adjusting compromises in order for it to work is a key component of successful couples. We all have things we'd like to forget, but what would be the point, we learn from our mistakes and experience the good and the bad otherwise we would simply repeat the process, getting heartbroken again and again.<br /><br /> The directing is excellent; nearly all special effects in the memory scenes were created using special camera and lighting effects, the movie itself is in a moderately shaky camera, with a cold New York winter setting adding to the mood.<br /><br />  The soundtrack is great, made by Jon Brion, the main song being Polyphonic Spree's \\"Light and Day\\" also featured are The Willowz, and Don Nelson. Jim Carry provides a decent not so comedic performance, but the real star is Kate Winslet, who perfectly pulls off the quirky, multi colored hair, Clementine. Nominated for several Golden Globes, this movie attracted many critics' reviews and was featured at the Sundance festival last year.<br /><br />  A beautifully crafted romantic comedy that's not your typical romantic comedy, with a sense of sadness about it, this movie will satisfy and fascinate nearly all who watch this.ve a chance.

B000089RVX|4.0|This CD is gets me in the blood pumper! Sad, spooky and downright deep. I loved it and look forward to more.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|I don't like Tom Cruise. I don't like him, his Scientology `religion,' his strutting style of acting, or the horse he rode in on. BUT. He's really good in Collateral. He plays a ruthless hit man out to eliminate 5-6 people who might potentially testify in an upcoming high-profile trial. He hops into a cab driven by Max, superbly played (I mean, SUPERBLY) by Jamie Foxx, and sets off on an all-night shooting spree. <br />Cruise doesn't change one whit throughout the film: he's a killing machine, period. <br />But Foxx. Omigod, Jamie Foxx begins as a taxi hack in a nowhere life and slowly becomes the reluctant hero of the film as he valiantly (and very improbably, but hey, this is an action movie, so sit back and just take it on faith) tries to save the life of Cruise's last and ultimate victim: the pretty DA in charge of the case. <br />It's exciting and edge-of-your seat tense throughout, and only 3 things really bothered me: 1) It's not believable that a car would overturn and crash to smithereens without either of the occupants getting more than a bruise, and Cruise's clothes don't even get mussed up, 2) It's not possible for women to run that desperately fast in 3-inch heels, and 3) The very last scene of them outside at dawn overlooking a freeway and parking lot was just...empty. Anticlimactic. <br />Anyway, it's a terrific shoot-`em-up film, if you like this sort of thing. <br />
B000056K04|1.0|This is CR@P! I returned it promptly! I bought it last year and was not happy, but what do you expect? it sounds like all the other tripe thet put out. <br />
B00000ING2|2.0|This is not one of Newman's better flics.  The plot is ridiculous, the acting is so so and the characters are actually annoying.
B000002N2P|5.0|Name one punk rock album better than this??? <br /> <br />The Sex Pistols - Never Mind the Bollicks? <br /> <br />I don't think so. <br /> <br />Unbelievably awesome loud and and heavy and edgy guitar riffs and playing. <br /> <br />Panic Song has great instumental. <br /> <br />
B00005JNBQ|4.0|As a guy that grew up in the \\"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\\" era, this movie brought me back. It's the cult hit of this era...guaranteed! The characters are a scream and the plot cannot be discovered because you are laughing too hard.  <br /> <br />This movie is a MUST see and a MUST own!
B00066FMVU|3.0|A nice remastered 2-disc version of an album which is a classic for post punk era and pre-new wave. The songs sound a lot better than before but some stuff on the second disc sounds terrible (especially live stuff!). I hope that the next round of remastered Cure albums get a better treat. And why do we miss Killing An Arab on this one? Wasn't this a single in the same era? I thought it was! Anyway... it's good enough for me. Cure fans should buy without any doubt.
B000641Z90|5.0|Just received my dvd and watched it all. I went to see Phil when he was on this tour. Watching the dvd was like being at the concert again. When I was at the concert I did not want it to end and I feel the same way about the dvd. Definitely worth the wait and the price
6305807086|2.0|I adore John Malkovich. I havent missed any of his movies. Intelligent, super suave, extraordinarily attractive,  a true gentleman (or so he seems), superior actor.  How could he allow even his name to appear in this so-called movie? How could he allow to be represented in such a manner?  Was he really in such a need of money that he accepted this shameful parody of himself?  I could not believe my eyes when I watched this...., I do not know what to call it:  it is not a movie, it is a farce and an insult to the intelligence of any living person.  Ugh, and ugh and ugh!!! Pure trash.
0452282152|5.0|I found this book to be incredibly enjoyable. The way that Tracy Chevalier brings the art work of the Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer to life is amazing. Not only to you get to see the paintings vividly in your head but you also can understand the feelings of the characters. Griet is a young girl that is torn two ways, one of which she knows is wrong. She knows that there is a connection between her master and herself but at the same time realizes that nothing can ever happen between them. Then ther is her butcher boyfriend who, though he is a great man, is not what Griet wants in life. You watch her struggle as she works for the Vermeer family living only for the time in His study. It is a thrilling story about the hard truth of the 17th Century. <br /> I absolutly loved this book and would recommend it to anyone. I have never before had a book that gave me such amazing visual images.
B0006GAOCW|3.0|I am not really big on comedies, but this wasn't that bad. It had some good funny moments, and it is family safe which is harder to find now of days. It was better than Chasing Liberty, and Katie Holmes continues to have a sort of \\"girl next door\\" quality that makes up for her lacking acting ability. Michael Keaton was good in it as always. It was also interesting to watch some of the things the president's kids have to go through that normally cross your mind. I don't think I could handle comedians making fun of my appearance during those awkward teenage years or my college class choices. You also have to feel for the guy playing the love interest. It must take a lot of nerve to ask a girl out with a 300+ gorilla guarding her at all times. The movie doesn't have much depth or plot, but over all not a bad choice for a rental on a night when the kids are going to up while you are watching. I would recommend it if you just wanted something light to watch that require much attention to follow.
B0002Y4T92|1.0|Amazon won't let you select 0 Stars so 1 is lowest I could select. <br /> <br />At least one other reviewer had the same problem as me - Both Discs are UNPLAYABLE in all (4) of the DVD Players I have in my house. <br />I just sent Amazon an E Mail indicating this but I believe their policy is to exchange only - I'll have to wait and see if the replacement is another defective product. <br />Shame on Warner Strategic Marketing for using such Powerhouse Content to Rip people off!!!!!
B0006IIPIK|3.0|First off let me say that this is not a bad movie. The effects are very well done with the cinematography and such doing a very good job of masking the fact that the movie is almost completely CGI. The plot is not too thick and doesn't need to be. One of the best things about this movie, or I should say my favorite part, is a bit cameo by the late Laurence Olivier, who was resurrected from the grave to play a bit part in the movie. The majority of the acting was very good, with Giovanni Ribisi and Jude Law pretty much carrying the movie.<br /><br />So why only three and a half stars? First off, Gwyneth Paltrow was miscast. I don't think she lived up to her potential in this movie as she tries to play the Indiana Jones style heroine/strong female lead character; which has never really been her strong suit in the first place. Secondly, can someone explain why Angelina Jolie has like third billing in this movie even though she's only in three scenes? She has higher billing then Ribisi who is in the majority of the movie. Will anyone ever give Ribisi the respect he deserves?<br /><br />I can't really think of any other problems I had with the movie, it was a great movie, and I will one day own it. I just thought everyone should know how it is before they see the movie.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|I have to admit that when I first saw the trailer for this film. I didn't know what to make of it. It looked like it was supposed to be a comedy, but the trailer, which was supposed to be a condensed and \\"best of\\" version of a movie (in this case the funniest moments of \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\"), wasn't really that funny at all, at least not immediately and apparently. I was still intrigued, nonetheless. And finally curiosity got the better of me and I decided to give it a look at home, and I must say while I don't remember falling out of my seat from laughing at any point during the movie, it did bring a almost perpetual smile to my face with its sense of subtle and dry-witted humor. And it carried a feel good message throughout too. <br /> <br />The film brings the trials and tribulations of high school adolescence to a level of quirkiness that is unseen in any other films that I've seen in this genre. Most of the film's delightfully eccentric humor can be attributed to its colorful cast of weirdoes: The main character Napoleon Dynamite who's friendless and painfully un-self-conscious about his nerdiness; His brother Kip, who's a 32 year old live-at-home self-professed lady's man; A self delusional uncle Rico, who peddles herbal breast size enhancement to the local women, and dreams of traveling back in time to the glory year of 1982, when he was the football star of his high school; just to name a few. One would also be exposed to the life of rural Idaho, where the next house is always a mile away, and where Napoleon earns a 6-dollars a day salary with the chicken farmers. The movie is funny because none of the characters are aware of their flaws and awkwardness, but somehow in the end good things happen to those who happen to be doing nothing but just being their weird little selves. <br /> <br />While some may argue that there's no character development in this movie, I disagree. Napoleon for one clearly goes through a transformation during the film. He is a nerd and a conceited loser in the beginning, throwing around petty lies like claiming the girl in a promotional glamour shot is his girlfriend. But eventually he learns to be truthful to others, and most importantly to himself, by building meaningful friendships with those who can identify with him, and through unabashed self-expression.  <br /> <br />The moral message of self-expression is central to this movie and very admirable.  But ultimately I liked this film due the superb and genuine performance of its cast. The portrayals of the characters are very dead-on and that's a big part in what makes this movie funny and watchable.
0684859106|5.0|Absolutely the sweetest, old-fashioned baking book ever!  I am a collector of baking books and this is my very favorite among them. What I love about it is the ease, the  recipes only take up one page each and the simple ingredients (butter, sugar, vanilla, flour), well most bakers will have on hand. I have made several of the cakes for birthdays in our family and the Traditional Vanilla Birthday Cake was an especially big hit with the kids. It tastes like something Grandma made when you were a kid. I agree with my co-reviewer who said her daughter and her friends could not believe how much better homemade is. If you want a break from your crazy, busy day, step back in time with these old-fashioned recipes - this book takes me back to a simpler, slower time when sitting on Grandma's back porch with your pie, in your barefeet,was all you wanted to do.
B00030590I|5.0|WHAT A BEAUTIFUL MOVIE. I normally don't like fight movies and fast forward through battle scenes but this movie had me mesmorized...the use of color and light...Great! Eventhough I enjoyed watching the movie in the original language a neat option is you can watch the movie in english. Definitly a must buy and this is coming from someone who normally only watchs movies once!
B00005QY5Y|3.0|I really enjoy Ryan Adam's work because it is not often that I find in popular music such talent and depth in singing and songwriting.  After listening to Ryan Adams, I found it hard to return to my other music; it just didn't compare.  \\"Gold\\" is the third cd that I have purchased and unfortunately, while it is still pretty amazing, it just did not live up to my expectations for Adams.  The way Adams sings in \\"Love is Hell\\" and \\"Heartbreaker\\" makes you feel the music as more than just sung words; each song is an emotion.  I can't feel the emotion as poignantly in most songs on the \\"Gold\\" cd.  The songs on \\"Gold\\" are accessible and catchy, but if you really want to feel what Adams is singing go for \\"Love is Hell\\" or \\"Heartbreaker.\\" \\"Heartbreaker\\" has mostly country music, but don't be scared off if you don't like country. I don't think Adams is so much of a country artist, as a singer who uses country music as a metaphor for his sadness.  I really am not a fan of country music,  but the feeling that Adams puts into Heartbreaker makes the country music so beautiful.  The harmonica almost sounds like crying.  Adams is so amazing because he can turn tangible objects and sounds into emotion.  Gold does not seem to have this power for me.
B0006IIPIK|4.0|I liked this film a lot at the cinema.  The special effects were excelent and the plot was interesting.  Even Jude Law wasn't that bad in the role of Sky Captain.  He wasn't great,  but he wasn't too bad.   <br />I don't really have anything particularly bad to say about the film.  Another actor in the lead role might have made the performance a bit more involving but it's not enough of a reason to stop me saying, it's definitely worth watching.
B00020HEL6|2.0|Renee Olstead clearly has talent, as evidenced by this album.  Her voice has incredible jazz capabilities, and I look forward to seeing what she comes out with inthe coming years.  However, with regards to this her self-titled album, she is like a student who has just learned to do impressive tricks and not much more.   <br /> <br />Renee Olstead's voice is supported, thankfully, by more experienced musicians.  But she herself has not learned that excellent vocals are not necessarily those with excellent range, but those with excellent expression.  She gets carried away with her vocal riffs, and seems to forget what she is singing about; Just arranging music with more unique chord progressions doesn't make them more inherently interesting.  Most noticably this trouble comes in Summertime, where she seems to be trying to prove all of her ability in the first track rather than focusing on the task at hand:  singing an operatic lullaby.  Maybe I wouldn't have been so immediately turned off if this hadn't been the first track, and maybe she wouldn't have been trying so hard if it weren't a song with such an aura.   <br /> <br />In Someone To Watch Over Me, she comes closer to figuring out what she's singing about with only a few flights of listening to herself sing, and her duet with Peter Cincotti is pleasant.  But then she moves back to experimenting with where her voice can go rather than figuring out how best to express the emotion in a song.   <br /> <br />That being said, I will definitely check her work out as it progresses.  I am hopeful that she will reign herself in and prove to be an outstanding new voice in the world of jazz.
0156027321|5.0|\\"Richard Parker\\" may go down as today's Moby Dick, captivating in descriptive prose, and as real as the great whale from Melville's epic.  Martel writes a book that at times is hilarious, while always tettering on the edge of death for a young boy stranded on a life boat.  The interplay between human and animal is remarkably well-written and if one did not know it was a novel, it would strike you as based on a true story.   <br />  There are many good books out there that you should read, but none are more original or imaginative than \\"Life of Pi\\".  You will NOT regret reading this book, and will spend days thereafter wondering if it was just a story based on a unique idea, or a metaphor for the pain and suffering that one goes through when something horrific occurs in their life.  When \\"Richard Parker\\" disembarks from the 227 day voyage, leaps in the jungle and glances back at young Pi, you know that Pi has exorcised this horror from his life forever and will be fine.  Is this a story of hope and renewal?  You decide!
0061015725|2.0|I used to really like Michael Crichton, he was cutting edge and new. The problem with Prey is that in truth it owes an awful lot to a book that came out two years previous to his called Decipher by Stel Pavlou. Nanoparticles that can mimic humans, eat flesh and become a formidable foe. Sure that book is far more complex and the nano tech is just one part of that book, but it's so obvious to me having read Prey that Crichton read that book and borrowed the bits he liked that Prey has made me lose a tremendous amount of respect for him. Prey on its own is okay for the first half, strange things are happening and the hero doesn't know why, but many of the questions are left unanswered, and perhaps the most annoying thing of all was the lame last minute attempt to wrap everything up with a two page excuse near the end. It made the book very unsatisfying. Disappointed.
B0006IIPIK|4.0|An anonymous note brings Polly Perkins, ace woman reporter, to Radio City Music Hall to watch \\"Wizard of Oz.\\"  An elderly gentlemen comes to her and tells her that he has information on the scientists who are disappearing.  Before his precipitous departure he tells her he's the next scientist to disappear and when she asks who's doing this, the one-word reply is Totemkopf.    Next thing you know, a machine driven blitzkrieg hits NYC.  Mercenary \\"SSky Captain\\" (Jude Law) is flying over the city doing his best to kill the invading enemy machines.       Perkins and Joe team up to solve both of the cases.  There's a lot of romentic and comedic tension between the two.  They used to be an 'item' til she caught him cheating on her and messed with his plane's fuel line.      The effects are stunning.  The pellucid colors remind me of a vintage comic--or an old photo colored with Marshal oils.  The scenery is pretty amazing and the action good enough to keep you riveted in your seat for most of the show.      True, the performance is not up to the actor's standard, but this is not a drama.      The running plot about Paltrow and her camera was one of the funniest bits in the movie.  I can so relate to her problems with taking pictures.      Overall, a very worthwhile film to own and watch again.
B00005JMXX|4.0|Disaster flicks! Probably the genre that has the most dichotomic following! Fans are usually fully fascinated. the rest of the cinema goers find the movies despicable. <br />This seems to be a basic phenomenon. Fascination (well beyond appraisal) or utter rejection. <br />What it means is that there are those of us who are indeed captivated by disaster flicks as by magic. And that group is not a minority! (if it were, the genre would have no commercial existence!). <br />All of you probably know people who love going out into a storm! Who crave lightning. Should you be interested in a more appropriate analysis of this intriguing behaviour, I suggest you read Velikovsky's \\"Mankind in amnesia\\". An eye-opener! <br />In a way, it is like being drawn to Disney fantasies or being repelled by them. Not the same group, but the same phenomenon! <br />The conclusion is that, once drawn into the disaster \\"magic\\" (pandsemonium is probably a better term), our sense of reality goes dormant, and we submit to the pressure of the events, revelling in them, coming to expect them and still being shocked by the occurrences. in other words, the overwhelming aspect takes precedence over the scientific realism. <br />Cinema makers have understood and encapsulate such an need into commercial (success) formulas: panic events, some human misery, unexpected heroism, narrow escapes and a happy ending (or at least a soothing one). The story in itself is totally irrelevant, better even: there is no need for a story! The formula, as expected, is made of a series of horrendous events of which the sequence is the sole required motor! <br />In that respect, \\"the day after tomorrow\\" serves the objective splendidly. It has the appropriate (very) bad news (irreversible climatic change: wow! What can you do against that?). The emotional bits (likable people being frozen to death). The make-believe objective: group of (also likable) people trapped inside the library, who are in need of being rescued, even more so as it become neigh impossible. the hero (scientist and father of one of the trapped kids) who will travel God knows how many miles, using some kind of sleigh. And all the cliffhangers are there as well.  <br />At the level of acceptance by disaster fans, the whole thing works perfectly well. Visually splendid, correctly paced. So who cares about basic physical impossibilities? Who cares about the two-dimensional characters? Who cares about the flimsy story line? <br />I for one don't. I just recline in my seat and enjoy! It's the best thing to be in (for two hours), apart from the real disaster! <br /> <br /> <br />
B0006Z2KYI|5.0|You know very little about Jack Benny?  Don't matter.  This film has no right to be this funny.  No film that deals with Nazis and death has any reason to be this hilarious.  And yet, Benny and director Ernst Lubitsch found the perfect balance between wittiness  and suspense.  The scene near the end where Benny is put in a room with the body of the man he is impersonating?  Genius.  I actually had been laughing ten seconds early and then my chest tightened up.  Great film with classic lines, terrific acting and genuine charm.
0451169514|5.0|This book is, simply put, awesome.  Although it takes a little while (okay, okay - a long while, like 500 pages) to get into, the rest of it is totally worth it.  & even though the first part you're not all the way into it there are still enough exciting scenes & suspense to be good.  I finished the book last night & it is just amazing.  It all kind of ties together & there are keys to understand the rest of it (Eddie's aspirator).  It is more than worth the money spent on it & the time it takes to read it (it took me a little less than three months). <br /> <br />THE VERDICT: Go out and buy it now!!
0812550706|5.0|This first part of the Ender saga, Ender's Game tells the story of the boy Andrew or `Ender' Wiggin who is destined as a child to lead the military forces of humanity against the buggers; aliens who have attacked the earth before and who seem hellbent on wiping out mankind. Ender is a child who early on in life is identified as being gifted and a potential supreme commander for humanity's forces. Most of Ender's Game takes place in Battle School, an installation aboard a space station where children are trained to become future military commanders in the coming war against the buggers. But before we are taken to Battle School we see briefly see Ender's life at school and with his family. Then most of the book is spent in Battle School detailing Ender's trials and tribulations; the challenges he faces and the friends - and enemies - he makes. After that it's on to Command School aboard an asteroid called Eros and finally the final battle with the buggers. Ender is a kind and sensitive boy who finds himself in some very difficult situations. He encounters bullies at school and is forced to take severe action to deal with them. He loves his older brother Peter but Peter bullies him because he hates Ender because Ender was found to be more suitable for Battle School than he was. He is isolated by the teachers at Battle School and set up so that other boys despise him. And although he does make friends at Battle School he is hated by some and eventually finds himself in a life or death situation, whilst the Battle School teachers look the other way. And even with his friends he in time begins to feel separate even from them, because he is seen as mankind's last, best hope against the buggers. So throughout the book we see much of Ender's sadness and Ender's pain. We also get to see his close relationship with his sister Valentine, who is 2 years older than him, whilst he is still living at home up to the age of 6 (during this period Valentine does her best to protect him from Peter's bullying tendencies), during a brief holiday he has in between Battle School and Command School and also when they are reunited again later on in the book, and this relationship is quite poignant.<br /><br />Ender is the youngest of the three Wiggin children. All the Wiggin children are gifted - although only Ender was seen as suitable for Battle School - and as a sub-plot we have Valentine and Peter using their giftedness to pose as adults on the internet under the pseudonyms Locke and Demosthenes, posting essays, writing on forums and talking part in online debates in order to become influential in world affairs and to influence world opinions. This is all part of Peter's masterplan to eventually become Hegemon of earth; to unite the entire world under one supreme authority. This subplot actually leads to Card's Shadow saga and whilst you do have to suspend your disbelief somewhat (because Peter is twelve and Valentine is ten) it is still good fun.<br /><br />I found this to be an excellent book, with a generally likeable and most sympathetic protagonist; about the nature of friendship, about ends being used to justify means (which I don't agree with), about how cruel children can be to other children, about ambition, about sacrifice and even about redemption. And the book's climax is momentous, with a most unexpected twist. Although the book is largely about children, I recommend this book to young and old alike (I am 32).

B0000029DD|4.0|Jeff Buckley is an artist you could have easily missed (at least during his lifetime, before the Buckley-legacy machine started to elevate him to almost God-like status)  but one which, once you get to know him, you will not easily forget. Still, the first contact with Grace, the only album Buckley made during his life time, is not an easy one. The first thing you notice is the voice: that incredible, angel-like voice; soft and sensual and able to reach dizzying heights that would normally shred the throat of a lesser singer - and that's before he even switches to falsetto! But the songs themselves are hard to get into, mostly because they don't form a coherent whole.  <br />The best songs on 'Grace' are not Buckley's compositions, which are not fully fleshed out and, as such, do not serve as the ideal vehicle for his enormous talent. It is the covers, like Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah' or the old jazz classic 'Lilac Line', that instantly mesmerize while Buckley's songs - even the best ones, like 'Lover you should've come over' or 'Dream Brother' - take much longer to get used to. <br />One of the reasons for this resides precisely in his enormous talent: Buckley is a performer who soared and his compositions sometimes soared with him, which means that most of them don't have a strong centre. Usually, you get into to his songs by one of its parts, and eventually you learn to love it as a whole, while the covers strike an instant punch, since they have a strong centre, through which Buckley channels his considerable talent. <br />Having said that, once you do get into 'Grace', and Jeff Buckley, it'll be very hard to let go. Because even after you manage to get used to his astounding voice, you will be surprised by how good the guitar playing is, and how off-beat the chords are, and how rich the imagery in Buckley's lyrics is, and, finally, how sensible a man he must have been. <br />I have to admit that 'Grace' was not my first Jeff Buckley album - it was 'Mystery White Boy'. I found out about it after strolling, one summer afternoon, into a Virgin Megastore in Paris, and hearing the haunting chords of 'Dreambrother' on the speakers. Finding the music unusual for a megastore, I asked who was playing, and got hooked ever since. <br />'Grace' is, in my opinion, one of the best albums of all-time from a very gifted artist with a very unusual voice. If you are a music fan, you really have to give it a try. <br />
B0002EXH5O|5.0|The period before this album was recorded could have easily been the end of Megadeth. Mustaine had just fired several members of the band and had seen dozens of potential replacement guitarists, but none of them worked. Finally Dave reluctantly settled on a guitarist with half-black, half-orange hair named Marty Friedman. That move really payed off for \\"Rust in Peace.\\" The songs on this album are some of Megadeth's best.<br /><br />1. Holy Wars...The Punishment Due 10/10- Possibly the best song that Megadeth has ever made with several awesome riffs and a number of great solos as well. Dave and Friedman sound great together and their chemistry is instantly obvious.<br /><br />2. Hanger 18 10/10- Yeah, the verses are kind of weak (although I don't mind), but the highlight of this song is the four spectacular riffs and nine (9!) solos that are sprinkled thoughout the song. Also one of Megadeth's best songs and a live staple.<br /><br />3. Take No Prisoners 7/10- Decent song, but the memorable part is the chorus \\"Take No Prisoners, Take no Sh*t!\\".<br /><br />4. Five Magics 9/10- For some reason the lyrics are a little different on the remaster. Still a pretty good song with great guitar work.<br /><br />5. Poison was the Cure 8/10- There's not much wrong with this songs besides the fact that it is kind of short (just over three minutes). More great guitar work.<br /><br />6. Lucretia 9/10- That laugh in the beginning is annoying, but the rest of the song sure isn't. Great solos by Freidman.<br /><br />7. Tornado of Souls 9/10- Lame title but awesome song! Marty Freidman's best solo can be found on here. The only thing that keeps this from being one of Megadeth's best ever is Dave's vocals, which are terrible.<br /><br />8. Dawn Patrol N/A- It would be infair to judge this song because it is too short to really enjoy (1:43).<br /><br />9. Rust in Peace...Polaris 8/10- For some reason this song works better on some days than others, I guess it depends on what kind of mood I'm in. Anyway, a decent song, but a poor closer (at least back when this was the album's closer).<br /><br />This album sounds slightly different than the original, but there was not much that needed to be improved upon. As for the bonus tracks, \\"My Creation\\" is pointless because it is so short, but the demos all have Chris Poland playing lead guitar on them, so if you are a big fans of him, buying the remaster might be worthwhile. Even if you don't like Poland that much (like me) the demos are different enough from the originals (different speeds and solos different from the regular songs) that the bonus tracks are fun to listen to. I'd say if you already have this album on CD though, that the remaster is not necessary.what kind of mood I'm in.

B0002XVQNU|4.0|This is the true Daredevil movie.  It is grittier, more intense than its PG-13 version (added scenes of violence, nudity, and profanity earn it an \\"R\\" rating!).  Scenes are added, rearranged, or discarded all together, the end result being a better film (the best example is Matt's relationship with the priest).<br /><br />I can understand why the producers would have been hesitant in releasing an \\"R\\" rated Daredevil.  After all, the Daredevil comics are aimed at a juvenile audience and such a rating would keep them from the movie leading to a loss in revenue.<br /><br />Fortunately, the director's cut gives adults a Daredevil they can truly enjoy.<br /><br />Go get 'em, Matt!
B0002OERI0|5.0|I listen to large variety of music that I have either downloaded or bought on a CD and I was never really a big fan of Green Day, until this Album. I thought all of their music sounded the same. Once I saw the great reviews that people have given this CD I thought I would give it a shot. And wow was I impresed. This CD is honestly amazing. I have listened to it a countless amount of times and I am definetly not sick of it. BUY THIS CD!    Here is an honest overview of American Idiot:    1. Ameican Idiot - 4/5 - A great song but after a while it gets slighty annoying to listing to, but still good.    2. Jesus of Surburbia - 4/5 - This is a 5 part song, some parts are very entertaing some...just decent.    3. Holiday - 5/5 - This song is just so good, thats really the only way to put it.    4. Boulevard of Broken Dreams - 6/5 - With as many times that I heard this song, I should hate it, but no...still amazing.    5. Are we the Waitng - 5/5 - A very, very good song that I didn't really expect from Green Day.    6. St. Jimmy - 4/5 - A good, expected song on this CD. Probably my least favorite on the CD, which says this CD is really good.    7. Give Me Novacane - 5/5 - Another great song that I didn't expect to hear.    8. She's a Rebel - 4/5 - A good song that you probably won't get sick of any time soon.    9. Extraordinary Girl - 4.5/5 - Almost a 5, but no. This is the type of song that makes you get up and do a little dance.    10. Letterbomb - 4/5 - Another one of those typical Green Day songs but still great.    11. Wake Me Up When Septeber Ends - 6/5 - This song is absolutly phnomenal, I can't put in words. It is a type of Green Day song that is not heard on the radio.    12. Homecoming - 4/5 - Another one of those 5 part songs. Once again, some parts good, some just okay    13. Whatshername - 5/5 - A sweet closing song for one one of my favotite CDs    ***I also recommend Get Born by Jet***(another great CD)
0786869143|5.0|This book is about the parameters of luck you can account for.  Chiefly the ability to recognize opportunity when it presents itself.  Wiseman has shown through excellent research that \\"Lucky\\" people see opportunities in newspapers in their environment more so than \\"unlucky\\" people.  He talks about making yourself open to this.  Some people get this.  Some don't.  Some people don't want to hear that.  They want a magic explanation or a kook theory.  Wiseman validates things that have been obvious to people like Benjamin Franklin and others who promoted a positive attitude and industrious behavior.
B0006IIPIK|4.0|Impressive, cinematic flight of fantasy. A treat to watch with surround sound that ROCKS. The Special Features add to the enjoyment.  You'll enjoy this movie more if you can suspend your judgement about it until the end.  The last line is the \\"topping on the dessert\\".  HIGHLY recommended. STRONG 4+ stars.
B00008976Y|2.0|If you think you've seen enough French films that suggest they are not for you then this film won't make you change your mind one iota. Although it's Polish written and directed, it takes on all the pretensions of French cinema which is *usually* dull, and over bearing with artistic self-indulgence. It's devoid of all realism, acted by women that look like they came straight from a L'Oreal make-up commercial (Binoche is mesmerising if you like the china doll acting), acted by wimpy corduroy wearing men, pointless shagging (no nakedness here, must be the Polish Catholic background), and self consciously \\"artistic\\".    The worst thing I can remember was that it was supposed to be about a composer who had written beautiful music, but even the music was dull and too OTT. One of the sub-plots involving the stripper was laughable and when you really would appreciate some real emotion involving Binoche actually acting (messy and weepy and a bit more drama generally!), then it was back to the same old dreamy close-ups.    It's not that I came to the movie with a closed mind, I wanted to see a decent French movie - the ones everyone raves about. In my humble opinion this just isn't it.
B000002UA0|5.0|Its been said that the Floyd was next door to the Sgt. Pepper Beatles while they were recording this one. listening to this, I get get the impression that you can hear Floyd's influence on the Beatles, but not the other way around. These days its hard to say which album has made more of an impact. Traditionally Sgt. Pepper is credited with hailing in the psychadelic era, but Floyd to me were without a doubt the real creators and innovative practitioners of pyschadelic music--and listening to Piper today, it is obvious to me which group was more creative, experimental, and took more chances. You can still turn on college and public radio and hear bands that strongly echo this album--(Why is this so? While Beatles have the great melodies and song strucure and perfect vocals, there's simply more that a band can do with a Floydian soundscape creatively--there's a broader pallet of colors to choose from, and more room to move creatively when you use Piper as an influence and starting point). From what I gather, San Francisco was the birthplace of Psychadelia a mere one or two years previously, but it was the Floyd that really defined this kind of rock.   While I first became familiar with Pink Floyd through the stellar 1970s albums, Dark Side, Wish You, Wall, etc, today I feel that those later great albums were under a greater Syd Barret influence than I first realized. This album was the seed of all that was to come, and it is more fresh and vital than any Waters era floyd.
B00006FIAZ|4.0|I got this album after I got Storm Of The Light's Bane, so I am comparing this to Storm Of The Light's Bane. <br /> <br />The production is definitely more garage than Storm Of The Light's Bane, but the guitars are still recognizably Dissection, and the drumming is for the most part the same, except Ole Ohman doesn't use as many blastbeats in this debut.   <br /> <br />The songwriting is a bit raw compared to SOTLB, but it is still way up there.  It achieves atmospheric heights in songs like Black Horizons, The Somberlain, and Mistress of a bleeding sorrow.  Generally, the songs were harsher and more heavy than SOTLB, but this album does convey emotion, but isn't quite as haunting and grim as SOTLB.   <br /> <br />Where this album is good, it excels.  The garage production actually fit some certain songs, such as Black Horizons and The Cold Winds Of Nowhere, and the songwriting did use a whole lot of harmonizing to achieve a dramatic effect.  However, the problem is, where this album was poor, it was abysmal.  A couple of the songs took a whole lot of developing before they achieved a \\"personality\\", like A Land Forlorn.  Also, I found the acoustic guitar pieces, while technically astounding, very flat and boring, and not nearly as dramatic as their names would suggest, and they tended to not be as cold as the intrumentals on SOTLB.   <br /> <br />However, the production is still clear.  Though slightly muddied, it was irrelevant because it was for the most part clear and representative.  And the songwriting is still Dissection, and if you liked any other of their releases (Storm Of The Light's Bane, Past Is Alive, Live Legacy) then you will like this.  In fact, it easily surpasses Past Is Alive and Live Legacy.   <br /> <br />This album is clearly still influenced by Melodic Death Metal, as that's where Dissection's roots lay.  (By contrast, Storm Of The Light's Bane is definitely Melodic Black Metal.)  The Somberlain appears to be part of the time when Dissection were still in transition, as it is not recognizable to either genre.  What Dissection did, in fact, was take a Melodic Death Metal melody, and then \\"blacken\\" it, and then add a sense of Iron Maiden style harmonization, and the riffs are less \\"blackened\\" than they are on SOTLB.  Though there are other minor differences (production, vocals), the main difference in the fact that the riffs are more blackened on SOTLB than on this release.  <br /> <br />Is this good Dissection?  Yes.  Is it worth your money?  Yes.  Is it their best?  No.  Is it sensational and will it affect you tremendously?  No.  It is not an incredible album, and does have its flaws.  But it isn't bad; in fact, it is quite good.  I just urge you to get Storm Of The Light's Bane before you get this.  However, this album fails to disappoint.  It does carry the Dissection name, and it lives up to it every minute of its existence.
B00005BJ9W|5.0|Duran Duran was perhaps the quintessential 80s pop band, and 1982's \\"Rio\\" was the quintessential Duran Duran album.  Birmingham, England's \\"Fab Five\\" were primarily known for their hit singles and the lavishly produced videos that accompanied them.  \\"Rio\\" includes some of their very best hits: \\"Hungry Like the Wolf,\\" \\"Rio,\\" and \\"Save a Prayer.\\"  But this is more than just a singles album. With \\"Rio,\\" Duran maintained their New Romantic pop excellence over the course of an entire album.  They would produce many more hits throughout the 1980s, but they wouldn't release another full album as strong as \\"Rio\\" until 1993's \\"The Wedding Album.\\" <br /> <br />On \\"Rio,\\" Duran perfected a formula that they devised on their first album, 1981's \\"Duran Duran,\\" and would repeat throughout the 1980s: a \\"side one\\" of catchy, up-tempo songs and a \\"side two\\" of moodier, atmospheric numbers.  For those who remember the days of vinyl, \\"Rio\\" is truly an album of two perfect sides. <br /> <br />\\"Side One:\\" The opening chords of \\"Rio\\" explode like crashing ocean waves, with Nick Rhodes' ingenious use of synthesizer arpeggios setting the stylistic tone for the record.  The title track's euphoric, eternally memorable chorus is equaled a few songs later by that of \\"Hungry Like the Wolf,\\" \\"Rio's\\" other smash single.  \\"My Own Way,\\" a bigger hit in the UK than in the US, doesn't quite match the catchiness of those two songs, but nowhere else is Simon LeBon's braggadocio so gloriously evident (\\"I'm on 45!\\").  \\"Lonely in your Nightmare\\" is a lovely, piano-driven midtempo song, while \\"Hold Back the Rain\\" is an aggressive, pulsating dance track that spawned endless 12\\" mixes. <br /> <br />\\"Side Two:\\" The ominous intro of \\"New Religion\\" segues to a bass-driven groove that exemplifies Duran's moodier side.  \\"Last Chance on the Stairway\\" is a giddy paean to youthful romance, a teenybopper's guilty pleasure.  \\"Save a Prayer,\\" a lush, calypso-flavored ballad, evokes romantic nights in tropical paradises,while the final track, \\"The Chauffeur,\\" builds dramatically from a sparse keyboard ostinato to a dense instrumental coda that became the highlight of many a Duran Duran concert. <br /> <br />There's no doubt that Duran Duran relied on visuals as much as music to achieve their fame.  Indeed, \\"Rio's\\" exotic, exuberant Nagel cover girl succeeds as well as the music itself in establishing Duran's jet-setting zeitgeist. But with \\"Rio,\\" Duran Duran proved they're more than just well-coiffed video stars.  As emblematic of the 1980s as they are, these songs have nevertheless stood the test of time.  Like a glittering, multifaceted diamond, \\"Rio\\" endures as a shining example of 80s pop music at its best.
6305291446|4.0|A very \\"tight\\" movie - can't recall a single bit of \\"fluff\\" - action/story moved right along.    They could have made this longer - even by adding \\"fluff\\" - without hurting the over all quality.    A good scary movie - and one where you don't feel exhausted after watching it.     I especially like how Laurie Strode sees her brother stalking her in reflective surfaces or even broad daylight; She closes her eyes and takes a breath (or several) to make the hallucination go away - the viewer keeps watching wondering when she's going to try this and find out that he's really finally tracked her down!!    I give this only 4 of 5 stars for the following reasons:  * They briefly teased us into thinking JLC's boyfriend was posing as MM to mess with her mind and then stopped. Would have been awesome if they could have developed this area more and kept us guessing longer.  * LL COOL J played the security guard - what a waste of a good story character. They could have had any 'unknown' take this part and make something good of it - he just created a distraction to the point where I was glad someone shot him.    Wonderful detail and references to other horror movies woven into the fabric of this film - watch the Bonus material!  (The Bonus material is very interesting with the exception of the interviews with the German accent guy who is beyond boring!)
B00006LI4S|5.0|...and this dvd prove it. Classics songs, an amazing good taste in selecting and performing those songs, which are in the heart of many ..Gilmour have the charisma of those who have everything clear....Of course, tracks like Confortably Numb (one of the 10 songs i loved more) and Wish you Were Here doesn't need too many words, but check out for the MARVELLOUS version of \\"Don't\\" and the SUBLIMEEEEEE!! \\"Sonnet 18\\"....This DVD deserves of all the attention. Don't miss it, please, and you'll be a happier person...
B0006399FS|1.0|<br />Maybe you 5 star people like wasting your money on such a crap album but how many times are you going to listen to it?. There is nothing on this album that you haven't heard before. Listen to Pop instead.
B0001I561E|5.0|Aladdin is one of my favorite movies, and it's great that it is now on DVD! The color has been enhanced and it looks better than ever. Plus, the DVD has tons of bonus features, including deleted scenes and songs, and a tour of the Genie's lamp (so huge!). The only bonus feature I suggest NOT watching is the \\"A Whole New World\\" music video performed by Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey. They have completely messed up this magical song. Instead, view the feature \\"A Diamond In The Rough: The Making Of Aladdin\\" to see the original singers, Brad Kane and Lea Salonga, record the song back when the movie was being made... Or even watch the 1992 music video of \\"A Whole New World\\" performed by Regina Belle and Peabo Bryson.  <br />Well, all I can say is Aladdin is a great movie, and it's even better on DVD. This should definitely be added to everyone's Disney collection. <br />
B0006IIKS0|5.0|It seems to be the trend to rate anything by Metallica \\"post-AJFA\\" poorly. Metal fans seem to be convinced that Metallica have \\"sold-out\\" or have lost respectability because they have ventured into different musical territory (ironically, many of us started respecting Metallica because they played the music they wanted, and then we deride them for not conforming to what the metal scene thinks is cool). So, as for the content of the film, those that have already decided they now hate Metallica will hate watching the \\"spoiled rock stars,\\" and those that still support Metallica will love this realistic look at their human side and the extermely interesting group dynamics. <br /> <br />However, what makes this film such a tremendous achivement is not the appearances of the great rock stars (although they deserve tremendous credit for keeping the project alive and letting the film-makers produce their work without egos getting in the way). This is a great film because of the artistry of Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky. (check out Paradise Lost and Brother's Keeper as well.)Watching them transform the thousands of hours of footage into a workable, intersting narrative is a lesson in film-making. Because of the controversy among metal fans regarding the quality of more contemporary Metallica products perhaps the only truly reliable critics are those that are film critics first and could care less about the world of heavy metal, which is ironically as trendy as any other genre or musical scene. Most of these critics agree that this is a great film.  <br /> <br />Drop the hang-ups about the band--whether you are one of those who are blinded by the hype that Metallica has sold-out, or blinded by the idea that Metallica can do no wrong--and watch a great film by two amazing film-makers. I would also recommend Joe Berlinger's book about the making of the film. It offers an interesting perspective of the band, but more importantly a terrific exposition on documentary film-making. <br /> <br />Metal fans will also find the scenes with Dave Mustaine and Jason Newstead very interesting. I know I wanted to see more resolution on these fronts, but the film keeps that tension that obviously still exists. Sad that all these talents could not work together--what I feel is James Hetfields' greatest downfall. (I think Rob Trujillo is tremendous, but Metallica missed the boat by not capitalizing on Jason's abilities.) <br /> <br />This film reflects a classic story-line of talented artists who work hard at their art, achieve greatness and fame, and lose themselves and their relationships along the way. SKOM allows us to see these dynamic and powerful personalities (love 'em or hate 'em) deal with their fame and their genius and discover who they really are as an artistic entity. Sinofsky and Berlinger tie the multiple threads of this story-line together brilliantly. <br /> <br />Again--get past the hype, from both camps, and enjoy a nice artistic achievement.
B00005JMXX|3.0|Day After Tomorrow is a great film in the visual sense. It uses all sorts of excellent special effects to make it look like the planet Earth is about to be overtaken by weather- related disasters. But aside from the great special effects work, this film is really nothing special.<br /><br />Dennis Quaid is the main star in this film and, once again, his performance is only average. The other actors/actresses in the movie are also average. None of them delivers an Oscar- caliper performance, but none of them are really bad, either. In this area, the film gets a passing grade, but not by much.<br /><br />The other problem I have with this movie is the plot itself. With a story like this- one of such Earth shattering, weather- related proportions- so much could have been done to make the movie more interesting and more entertaining. But the director, Roland Emmerich, decides instead to make the film rather dull and forgettable. To give you an idea, one of the major parts of the storyline involves Dennis Quaid heading for New York to find his son. All of these global weather changes are taking place all around and people are fighting for their lives and here's Dennis Quaid's character hiking through the snow to reach New York.<br /><br />Political messages pop up all throughout this movie and I don't know if the director was trying to push a particular point of view or not, but it seems like he was. The topic of global warming and its potential to be a disaster, the subject of foreign debts owed to U.S. banks, and other political talk come up throughout the movie and it appears that Emmerich is trying to persuade viewers to take political action.<br /><br />I recommend this movie, but only because of its great special effects. The rest of the film- the acting, plot, script, etc.- are average or below average. But watching those gigantic waves crashing through the streets of New York City makes this film worth a look.
B000002KC5|5.0|I could write a full essay on the genius of this album but I see that others have already done that.  This is simply one of the best collections of songs ever produced.  I admit that I'm biased because I'm a HUGE fan of Randy's but don't let that keep you from enjoying the uniqueness of this cd.  There's just nothing else like it out there.  It is one of America's premier songwriters at his peak.
0786890754|5.0|Please, don't listen to the negative reviews- this book is fantastic! One minute I was laughing hysterically and the next I was bawling... It is a quick, easy read- but absolutely excellent. You really feel like you're going through the grieving process with Holly, and trying to accept that life does move on. If you're a woman and are looking for a great, quick book that you can't put down, but that has a little bit of depth, give this a shot. I guarantee you won't regret it
B0002XDODU|5.0|This is a great album, not unlike Mutter. <br />In my opinion, the music is more mature than the first Rammstein albums. It's not simple head banger music - it is much more mature, with a lot of texture. It is more lyrical than the first albums, but this doesn't mean it lacks energy. It is very heavy and aggressive, but not in the beats-per-minute sense. <br />I like all songs except \\"Amerika\\" - it lacks musical depth; a clich. <br />If you're looking for more than a primal high B.P.M head banger, this album is for you! Punk head kids may be disappointed. <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|I've always liked Green Day but this is the first album of theirs I've bought (actually my wife bought it for me.)  American Idiot is all I've been listening to for the last week-at home, in the car, at work.  I really like the political bent of the album and I'm hardly a leftie. The title track expresses some interesting ideas about the good ol' USA that I can actually relate to.   <br />I can't help but compare this album to U2's \\"Atom Bomb.\\"  The packaging is similar (use of black and red graphics, atom bomb and hand grenade concept) and they both came out around the same time.  Whereas U2 has appeared on every media outlet available to sell the album, Green Day basically let their music speak for itself.  And what music!!  There's not a bad track to be found.  \\"We are the Waiting\\" kinda meanders a bit, but that's it.  The songs rock. The lyrics are incisive, both politically and personally.  U2 debuted at no.1 and have been slipping down.  After 4 months on the chart, American Idiot is now no. 1 on the chart.  This is music that bears repeated listening and it just grows on you.  Is Green Day a modern Who? Who knows. Who cares. Go buy this album and listen to the some of the very best music of the past year.
0140177396|4.0|I think that the book Of Mice and Men is a really good book. I had fun reading of Mice and Men with the characters George and Lennie. I understand their personality by knowing their backgrounds. However, the fact that made the story better is that the characters had many ideas. Although, I really like this book because its very interesting. Some people think the book was overwhelming because they liked it so much. Besides, I learned many more things about the book while I was reading it. To conclude, I recommend that I should give the book a five stars because its really fun and understanding to read. <br /> <br />I understand that Of Mice and Men was the author of John Steinbeck. He is the American author who writes differnt kind of books about good and evil. Somehow, he created the book himself by working hard successfully. He even won many awards because of his novel and creativeness. However, he makes lots of money to improve his skills of writing. Also, Steinbeck was born in Salinas Valley where he works hard even more. He is the legend author who writes books among others. <br /> <br />I think that John Steinbeck is a great author because he works really hard every freakin day. But for me, Steinbeck is the man also because I like his books read them specially good and evil books.
0671027387|1.0|After reading Davinci code I was full of hope in finding some more good reading in this novel. Well, it started out quite good (if you are good at suspension of disbelief) but later you cannot go on any further.<br /><br />The characters are pathetic, the story line poor, the details and data used wrong and pathetic. Well, I kept on reading until about half way, saying to myself `it cannot get worse, it has to start picking up now'. Well, no, it did not. It went from bad to worse. How it ended I don't know as I could not force myself any further.<br /><br />So if you are looking to buy this, please, please stay away. Read the DaVinci code and call it a day.<br /><br />I see some people give it 5 stars, well I suppose that just goes to show - it takes all kinds .....<br /><br />Well, what can I say. I am just being honest.
B00020HEL6|5.0|I have seen Renee sing \\"Summertime\\" during a dream sequence she was playing on her sitcom: \\"Still Standing\\", and I was totally mesmorized. I remember thinking; \\"if this is really her singing, then she is too talented to 'give it away' like that on a sitcom. Her voice and technique is beyond what anyone could hope to learn through schooling and practice. I am buying this CD just for the title song, and I'm sure that I will love the other tracks. I am a little leary of the duets though; in my opinion, any other voice cannot compliment hers in any way (except for MAYBE Harry Connick Jr), and I wonder why she felt like she had to add duets at all. <br />Still, listen to this girl, and buy her CD. You won't be dissapointed and if it encourages her to go on singing, hallelujah! <br />
B0001I561E|5.0|Aladdin is surely one of the BEST BEST BEST movies Disney has ever made...this is the golden era of Disney when Alan Menken just dazzled audiences with his majestically beautiful score. This movie has an incredible plot of friendship, love, betrayal, and responsibility. If you notice, the picture in this DVD edition is very clear and crisp, unlike the previous vhs version that was a bit muddled. <br /> <br />and what's something you absolutely CANNOT MISS is the dvd's music video PROUD OF YOUR BOY!!!This is an INCREDIBLE song composed by Alan Menken and written by Howard Ashman. What an honorable tribute to Howard. This song is absolutely amazing and captures the essence of Aladdin's development and feelings. I was stunned and touched by the song's beautiful flow and heartwarming lyrics that just sound so REAL and not artificial. This song is a great great performance by Clay Aiken! This is the style of music that makes Clay's voice shine. <br /> <br />However, the disappointing part to the new music video is Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey's new rendition of A Whole New World....i was very very disappointed at this song and i think this couple just destroyed the magic and beauty of this song...... <br />but...this dvd is a MUST GET DISNEY MOVIE for fans or non-fans <br />ALADDIN IS THE BEST!!!!
1592400876|4.0|Droll British humor seems to be as much the point of this book as an examination of the many misuses of punctuation. The differences between British and American standard punctuation at times made reading this book as disorienting as driving in Brittan. Great fun to read while brushing up on some very fine points of grammar.
0316172324|4.0|This is a very entertaining and enlightning book.  The author introduces the concept of \\"thin slicing\\".  Which is basically how people extract information about others and about situations from a minimum amount of information.  It is the analysis of our first impressions and their value in our lives.   <br /> <br />The book analyses how people use this skill, when they are more likely to be successful in interpretation, when the ability is overshadowed by other circumstances, or when the skill shuts down completely.  <br /> <br />The reason why I give the book 4 stars is that the author did not make a very clear argument as to when can we trust our impressions and when not.  For instance, there are long discussions about how experts are more likely to see the \\"picture\\" instanteneously for what it is.  But then, the beginning of the book tells stories about lay people making good quick assessment on people's personalities based on their rooms alone.  So do we have to become experts first, or can we trust our instinct now and then?  That could be made a bit more clear. <br /> <br />As to the writing style, in addition to being versed in various aspects of psychology, the author is an excellent story teller.  The book is full of lively anecdotes and examples from life, news, history etc...  The book also has a cohesive structure, with stories told in earlier chapters brought back again as the book progresses so we can gain a deeper insight into the workings of the mind. <br /> <br />The bottom line is the book is great entertainment.  It's a page-turner where you care about the people in the anecdotes and about the message of the book in general.  Plus, after reading it you will feel that you learned something new about yourself and those around you.
020530902X|5.0|The gentle humor that one finds in this book makes learning grammar painless, even enjoyable. It was the \\"Eats, Shoots, and Leaves\\" of its day, but is broader in the elements of grammar and style that it covers. I recommend it to all my grant writing classes as an essential.
B000003TA4|1.0|God, Nirvana have to be the most overrated band in existence. People obsess over Nirvana, but stop yourselves and think, aside from alright songwriting skills, what talent did Kurt Cobain really have? he couldnt play guitar, my friend has played guitar for 6 months and can play almost every Nirvana song flawlessly. The riffs are simple and extremely repetitive, along with most of his lyrics, and he sounds like a dying camel when he sings. As for the other members- Dave Grohl is not a terrible drummer, but hes not great either, hes average at best. As for Novoselic, his bass lines are inaudible until Kurt starts whacking his guitar and screaming, and the song settles down again when hes done.  <br /> <br />The only reason Nirvana was revolutionary was because they were different. Metal and pop dominated the Tv and radio, which Kurt, unlike anybody else at the time, actively disliked. So, he formed a talentless band and practically revolutionized, if not created, grunge. The only reason so many people like Nirvana is because they havent heard of any of the other Seattle grunge bands, almost all of which are more talented than Nirvana. So Nirvana comes along, and all of a sudden it sucks to be a teenager and we need to throw away our hairspray and spandex and wear crappy flannel shirts and be depressed.  <br /> <br />In my opinion, Kurt killed himself because he soon realized what he had done. After Nirvana started a revolution in crappy music, hundreds of other bands were able to get record deals because they knew thats what the public wanted now, hence the birth of Green Day and pop punk. Green Day released Dookie, and soon hundreds of kids got interested in \\"punk\\" because they believed that was what punk was- catchy hooks and simple guitar riffs. Once Green Day got going, music was never the same again. The only metal still alive is classic metal bands making comebacks (Megadeth, Iron Maiden) and new underground VERY talented foreign metal bands (Children of Bodom,In Flames). I believe if Kurt was still alive, even he would be crying because of what he had done to music. no longer do we have fun metal around, we have rap and terrible pop. thanks Nirvana. thanks alot. <br /> <br />If youre debating whether to get this album, dont. by doing this you support a talentless revolution and instead of rebelling against todays music, you are simply buying right into what started it. Its a sad world in music right now, but at least we can live off the underground bands. <br /> <br />As for the album itself: Smells Like Teen Spirit is the only alright song, as it has an infectius guitar riff, but Kurts crappy vocals muddle it. the rest of the songs have crappy simple and repetitive guitar riffs and sound like complete sh*t. not worth a dollar, but i was dumb enough to buy it.
6302468027|3.0|Through the admirable acting  of  Jessica Tandy, and the talented Kathy Bates we will be the silent spectators of a brutal drama in the late years of the WW1 in the South.<br /><br />But this central nucleus has another parallel dramatic line. Meanwhile , Bates will experience the lack of affection of a terrible boring and predictable husband who only thinks in himself and his favorite passion; the sports.<br /><br />The admirable storytelling will captivate your heart and soul.<br /><br />Arresting photograph and remarkable artistic direction make of this film a must see.
B0006SNL2K|2.0|This album really SUCKS! But if it weren't for the songs like SCREAM and the live songs, I should've given this album 1 star. Too commercialized....
B00007BHOE|5.0|this is the coolest concert dvd ever! i hope they are as great when i see them in april.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|If you've liked songs from Shania Twain's CD's but never enough songs on one CD, this CD is one for you!!  All the songs incorporated in this cd were all songs that I have liked by her, so when I saw it I bought it.  Granted, there were a couple that weren't on here that I would have liked to see in this collection, but all-in-all, it is a good CD.
B00005ASHM|2.0|I can't believe what I'm seeing.  I am 36 years old and have been a fan of rock and pop music for at least 26 of those.  I had barely even heard of \\"Pet Sounds\\" until recently.  The Beach Boys sound, and yes, including \\"Pet Sounds,\\" which, yes, I have listened to, has always been and always will be nothing but bubble gum surfer music.  When did society decide that this mediocre piece of fluff was greater than truly legendary fare such as Sgt. Peppers, Dark Side of the Moon, Exile on Main Street, Highway 61 Revisited, and on and on and on?
B00008ADPF|4.0|While track # 7 'Figured You Out' is playing, I absolutely have to move. It has such a gut-thumping bass line, it just makes me rock with it. I don't even care how many other drivers are checking me out, thinking I'm completely whacked, as I sit in my car pounding the gear-shift with the palm of my hand.<br />The retrospective lyrics of track #3, 'Someday' tell a tale of a situation nearly all of us have been through. Love gone horribly wrong and a heartfelt desire to whatever is necessary put it right. If your heart doesn't recall at least one lost love you wish had turned out differently as you listen to this tender rock ballad, you must be made of stone.<br />I also very much enjoy track #5 'Feeling Way Too Damn Good'. Also touches on something many of us have dealt with in our lives. Everything going too well to be believed... and being astute and realistic enough to know it probably can't last.<br />I like this album... I can recommend it with only one reservation. A few of the other tracks are much too metal crunching to be enjoyed by someone like myself, who prefers remarkable lyrics blended with a tune that entices you to participate in it. Nickelback managed to do that for me on several tracks from this collection. That's all one can hope for when they lay their money down hoping for a good CD. Mission accomplished.
B00062J00S|5.0|This rates up with my top 5 favorite movies of all time.  I grew up on the Donna Reed show and remember that this was the movie I always saw her in and she was a lot more beautiful then.  James Stewart is great as George Baily, the guy who wanted to help everybody and sacrificed his own financial success. <br /> <br />The idea that one doesn't realize one's worth until you are removed from the equation has been copied hundreds of times since but never as well as this movie. <br /> <br />Clarence is probably the most enjoyable bumbling character that I have ever seen.  There is a cameo by an adult Alfalfa Sweitzer (for the Our Gang series) and the characters of Bert and Ernie later were immortalized by Sesame Street. <br /> <br />The ending of this movie is the \\"feel good\\" ending of all-time!
B000056IKS|5.0|I grew up listening to Kraftwerk thanks to my older sister, but I've never been exposed to any actual Krautrock until now. I bought Neu, Neu 2 and Neu 75 recently. I have to say, this is amazing. I really mean that... I'm literally amazed. This was recorded in the early 1970s? How can that be? This is so far away from anything else that was going on at the time. These guys were 20 years ahead of their time, at least. I would have guessed it was recorded in 1995 or so. So many bands that I thought were innovative and original... all this time, it turns out they were just ripping off Neu. My world is crumbling around me. And I like it.
B0007DA6GI|5.0|\\"A man tells his stories so many times, that he becomes the stories. They live on after him and in that way he becomes immortal.\\" Fiction as a vehicle for passing on mundane facts that in themselves are not worth telling, but nonetheless are part of who we are. The value is not so much in the facts themselves, but in the storytelling. Has anyone ever personally met God, or visited heaven? Has the absence of a factual basis prevented people from happily entertaining this notion as another reality? This film is about the exploits, real or imagined, of Ed Bloom, a fascinating, larger-than-life character who is loved by all. He has the uncanny ability to suspend disbelief in favor of wonder every time he tells a story. And these stories, loaded with imagination and wit, are animated by wonderful performances by an exemplary cast that engender their characters with life, rendering them almost believable. The narrator of the film is Ed Bloom's son Will, who attempts to discredit the stories as complete fiction, and therefore of little value. He is an embittered skeptic, who as an adult resents his father for taking advantage of his childhood innocence by having filled his head with lies and deception. Since the stories bring so much joy to the listener, and to us as viewers, they are much more satisfying to accept at face value; therefore, when Will admonishes them with scientific scrutiny, it is not the storyteller who ends up looking foolish and deceptive. In THE BIG FISH Tim Burton has created a masterpiece of fantasy that is firmly grounded in human relations, especially the complex relationship between a father and a son and the understated emotional bond between a husband and a wife. The immortality of that which cannot be verified or understood by the facts, the magic of faith and love, and the enduring power the imagination are all part of this \\"big fish\\" story.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Yes, we've heard the songs before. Yes, we already own the original albums, although perhaps updated to CD from viny, but this is still a must-have collection for hardcore fans and a great way to introduce a new generation to these giants of the genre. John Lennon lives on through his music a quarter century after his brutal murder. Let It Be, detractors of this collection; we still Need The Love.
B0006IUDXA|5.0|Finally Paramount comes out with Macgyver on DVD. This is worth every penny if your a macgyver fan. If you buy it from Best Buy its 27.99 and theres 22 episodes so it comes out to about $1.27 an episode when you think of it that way it sounds pretty good, and if each episode is about 40 minutes that comes out to about $0.03 a minute for commercial free Macgyver. <br /> <br />I cant wait for season 2 <br />
B00003CXA6|4.0|\\"Gettysburg\\" is an almost direct adaptation of \\"Killer Angels\\" which works because \\"Killer Angels\\" was an excellent book.  The general public will find the length and detail a bit too much, but anyone interested in the Civil War will find this an excellent recreation of the turning point in the war.   <br />I teach high school US History, but I can only use parts of the movie for my classes because the kids start to glaze over by the third hour, but since the movie is filmed on location and so detailed I just use selected scenes to help explain the war and how it was fought.  Keeping track of who's who can be difficult for people unfamiliar with the Civil War - the book had descriptions of the main characters at the beginning so readers could keep track of the main characters, but obviously the movie could not really do this.
B00005JLPK|5.0|Salma Hyak looks amazingly like the actual Frida Kahlo in this wonderful testiment to one of the most misunderstood and fascinating personalities of the 20th century!  Frida was the victim of a bus accident that nearly crippled her and left her in agony throughout her life.  As a result, Frida saw the dark side of life and painted some of the most amazing abstract works of art that I have ever seen. <br /> <br />Frida formed a bond with the famous political painter, Diego Rivera.  The two share a stormy relationship and eventually marry.  Frida overlooks most of Diego's extramarital affairs until Diego goes after Frida's sister.  Thus, she feels betrayed and leaves him. <br /> <br />Frida herself is a kinky persona sharing relationships with both men and women.  There is a very erotic scene of Frida dancing tango with another woman. <br /> <br />Frida eventually meets Leon Trotsky and the two united by their socialist political views end up having an affair.  When Trotsky is murdered, Frida and Rivera are suspected but are later exonerated. <br /> <br />In a touching scene in the movie, an incredibly ill Frida is brought in her bed to attend her own art exhibit at which her talent is expounded to a crowd by Rivera. <br /> <br />This movie should not be missed and anyone with an appreciation for good art would love it!
6305627401|5.0|This is the ultimite testment against censorship that I have ever seen. This is based on the series South Park by Matt Parker and Trey Stone. They write it, direct it, and even voice it. Stan,Kyle,Kenny,and Cartman go see the Terrance and Phillip movie Asses of Fire, and it warps their little minds to the point where whatever they say has cuss words. The parents are upset, They gather the kids and ask them where they heard those words and they say the movie. They are outraged that the Canadians made that movie and they put the kids in Group cussing therapy, and they seem changed but they go back into the movie and start cussing again, and they copy something from the movie that kills Kenny(You Bastards!). The moms are furious, they blame Canda and declare war on them and take Terrance and Philip hostage and plan to kill them so they can end it. But, they don't know that Satan plans to take over the world if they kill Terrance and Philip. so The kids form La Resistance and try and save Terrance and Philip, and they don't. The movie ends with cussing by Cartman, which was the funniest thing ever.<br /><br />The movie was simply put, HILAROUS, and Brillant. Matt and Trey speak out against censorship and do it in a very funny fashion. They also know how to take it overboard but they stay on the border, and just get belly laughs from you. This is one of the funniest things I have ever seen. It is so good. The voice acting is hilarous. This movie is a must see, must own, and must buy.<br /><br />I recommend you see Team America, if you like this movie.<br /><br />WARNING:THIS MOVIE ISN'T SUTIABLE FOR KIDS UNDER THE AGE OF 17.
B00004TJKI|5.0|Anatomy of a classic film: (1)Excellent opening title sequence by the great Saul Bass. (2)Music scored by jazz legend Duke Ellington, who even has a cameo. (3)A strong lead performance by James Stewart as the defense attorney that is direct and wholesome but has an undercurrent of complexity which is often sly and evasive. (4)Excellent supporting performances from all but special kudos to Ben Gazzara as the short fused soldier accused of 1st degree murder; Lee Remick, the incredibly sexy and alluring trailer trash wife of the soldier who may or may not have been raped by the murder victim; and Joseph Welch as the substitute Judge Weaver, affable and homespun, but very much in control of his courtroom. (5)A well-crafted script that builds in complexity and rarely disappoints in the dialog department, which is often loaded with innuendo and racy subtext. (6)Taught direction by Otto Preminger that carefully, but often daringly orchestrates all of the above seamlessly into a courtroom drama that is nothing short of brilliant.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|If I have ever heard a masterpiece, this is it. Whatever the style - progressive jazz, symphonic jazz, contemporary American music - Pat Metheny has once again created a unique, intelligent, colourful, sensitive, uplifting and utterly wonderful music that is entirely his own. Don't let yourself be intimidated  by long compositions - this is nothing new in jazz. Remember Coltraine's \\"A Love Supreme?\\" Remember Miles' \\"Bitches Brew?\\" So what's so unusual? The compositions here contain the essential Metheny sound - full of light, space and movement.  <br /> <br />The overall sound remains similar to Speaking Of Now and Imaginary Day, with memorable melodies that you just want to sing along with. You will find all the famiar elements: the soaring synth guitar, the wistful harmonica, the wordless vocalizing, that really BIG piano sound, the pristine bebop-influenced guitar soloing, the intricate acoustic guitar arpeggios, the delicate cymbal-work, the impossible time signatures... What more can one want from a Pat Metheny Group recording? Well you get more anyway, there are new elements here as well. Steve Rodby plays occasional cello which adds a sense of depth, Lyle Mays puts in some Moog-like hightlights throughout the album and Pat tries some new synth settings. But the biggest innovation is the extended composition. This is a structured work, with a couple of interlocking themes which appear at various times throughout the three parts. I know that I have not yet fully understood the structural aspects of the recording, but it will become more apparent on subsequent spins. Despite the structured approach, this music has much feeling and is very cinematic, so you don't need to analyze it to understand it. It works well on both levels. <br /> <br />As is usual with Pat Metheny, this music is multi-layered and as a friend of mine put it so well, once you peel away the layers, you discover new things, every time you listen. The \\"real\\" Pat Metheny fans will eat it up and ask for more. Kenny G afficionados be warned: it may be hazardous to your health.

B0002DKCMG|5.0|definately teh funniest movie i have seen this year i suggest you go buy it
B00005N5S5|5.0|I remember going to this movie thinking it would put me to sleep.  After all, back then Arnold was just a muscle guy who had made Pumping Iron and then the not too good, Conan the Barbarian.  Boy was I wrong!  This movie hooked me from the opening scene and even Arnold's stiff sounding dialogue was perfect for the cyborg he was playing!<br /><br />The chase scenes and narrow escapes had my heart pounding throughout the film!<br /><br />There were many scenes in this film that were firsts for movies such as Arnold removing a damaged robotic eyeball, seeing how the robot mind decided on what dialogue to say and having a robot disguise their voice to sound exactly like a dead human!<br /><br />The other Terminator films may have had the computer enhanced special effects, but they could not match the storyline of this action/SciFi classic that is probably the best all time of its genre!
B000002UAO|5.0|Rubber Soul marks the beginning of a musical transformation for the Beatles, from four loveable mob-tops, who churned out pot boilers every other month, into a mature rock and roll group now writing their own material, unlike most of their contemporaries.  All of this is true, of course, but Rubber Soul offered much more than this.  It was the first Beatles album to clearly demonstrate the uniqueness of the Beatles as musical expressionists as well as the now fully unfurled songwriting partnership of Lennon/McCartney.  The opener, Drive My Car, simply blows you away.  In the next song, Norwegian Wood, George is sporting his new sitar showing us that Indian music is more than just one note.  Nowhere Man has introspective lyrics and complex vocal harmonies.  And for the beautiful McCartney ballad Michelle, the cousin of Yesterday, Lennon wrote the middle eight.  But Girl was all John's own.  The nostalgic and yet mature In My Life suggests Lennon's lyric and McCartney's melody.  Rubber Soul found Harrison stepping out as a brilliant songwriter showcasing Think For Yourself and If I Needed Someone. And Ringo rises to the occasion too co-writing and singing What Goes On.   <br />On Rubber Soul you will find many different musical genres, such as rock, folk, blues, country and Indian.  And you will even discover a couple of new ones, like the psychedelic The Word and the pre-heavy metal I'm Looking Through You, both ahead of their time in musical genre and style. <br />The secret of the Beatles' greatness is often a topic for discussion.  Indeed, many contemporary artists could match the Fab Four in terms of playing their instruments well together.  Few, if any, could match the songwriting genius of partner-rivals Lennon/McCartney.  But none, absolutely none whatsoever, could match the vocal brilliance of the Beatles, in particular their vocal harmonies.  Here is a reality check!  The Beatles wrote more than 200 songs, and their catalogue has been covered by thousands offamous artists over the years.  And in truth, how many of these covers do you remember? 100? 50? 20? 10? 5?  Come on now!  Maybe Joe Cocker's version of With A Little Help From My Friends rings a bell?  Why is this exercise so difficult?  These songs are classics, remember?  I bet you do remember some of the songs covered by the Beatles themselves, like for instance Money, Long Tall Sally and Roll Over Beethoven, but do you know who wrote these songs, let alone the original recording of the song?  Many of the songs the Beatles wrote are now classics, but only when performed by the Beatles themselves.  If a song can be improved or interpreted differently, go ahead and do it!  And if it can't, it might be better to just leave it alone.          <br />Indeed, although Revolver or Sgt. Pepper may be regarded as the Beatles' finest hour, Rubber Soul still remains a cornerstone in their career, an artistic statement simply impossible to ignore.  The lead vocals on this record are all superb, but the vocal harmonies are so achingly natural and utterly original that they'll send shivers down your spine.  Lennon was right, Rubber Soul is where it started happening.......        <br />
B0000WN0ZK|5.0|It's the swinging  sixties in London, and Thomas is a fashion photographer who has grown weary of his hedonistic existence and finds himself on a quest for something more. By chance he follows a couple in a park, taking pictures of them as they wander and display their affections. Of course, nothing is as it seems and soon that girl will arrive on his doorstep willing to do anything to get the negatives. Has his camera captured an illicit affair?  Thomas intentionally gives her the wrong negatives and immediately developes the right ones. Curiosity? Once developed, he thinks he sees something in one of the photos and proceeds to blowup the questionable image. He studies the results, and the more he searches through the pixels the more he begins to see. A dead body? A crime?  He asks the girlfriend of an artist who who works adjacent to his studio, \\"That's the body? It looks like one of Bill's paintings.\\" Earlier in the film we actually see Bill's work and he explains that trying to make sense of the components of art is like \\"trying to find a clue in a detective story.\\" Thomas has indeed become a detective, suddenly aware of an existence that lurks under the surface of things. An illusive existence . . . imaginary? Everything about this picture questions structure and the idea of reality. Begining with a great Jazz score (the most improvisational of music), we see Thomas indistinquishable from a mass of downtrodden homeless men only to turn the corner and step into a Rolls Royce convertable. Things are not what they seem.  A troup of mimes cruises through London pretending to see and interact with things that are not real and when they make a reappearence at the end of the film, playing tennis with imaginary rackets, we can almost see the ball bouncing from one side of the court to the other.  In the end one might ask if Thomas really did uncover a murder or was it only imagined? Perhaps this is a question we might just as well ask ourselves concerning our own realities, but once you start questioning things, the answers will inevitably lead to more questions. In this alone there is value. As Socrates said, if we can believe Plato's account, \\"The unexamined life is not worth living.\\"

0066620996|5.0|Jim Collins is one of the few business writers that has delivered thoroughly fact-based and academic conclusions as to how companies become not only successful, but also sustainable.      The author's insights into effective leadership qualities are unique--and probably particularly challenging for traditionally arrogant, flashy, loud leaders to transform into.  One unique insight, which I find interesting but struggle with, is the idea of gradual and ongoing \\"tweaking\\" that occurred in featured companies instead of relying on comprehensive strategic planning processes.  I do not recall having run across similar conclusions in any of the other business books I've read.    The best part of this book is that it is written in a very readable and understable way that people at all levels of business can understand and use.
B0002X314C|5.0|there aint nothin i can say about this cd that hasnt already been said. i love it. damn good. this album is just refreshing. thats all i can say bout it. screw it im a keep goin. the thing that i really love about john legend, is that he isnt like other singers. What i mean by that is in alot of live performances the lip-synching is just so obvious and that dystroys the art involved in making music for me. the only live performance that i have seen john in was when he performed \\"around my way\\" with talib kweli on Chapelle's show. and HOLY CRAP he sang for real. he sang so well on Dave that to me he actually sounded better than he did on the album track. he's so talented you gotta cop this for real. peace
B00005Y7PS|5.0|Gotta love these Ozzy fans... they all seem to have the same thing to say: no Ozzy means no Sabbath & Ozzy-less albums suck. They seem to be a lil forgiving towards the Dio era ones but never warmed up to any other replacement for the very ordinary, yet lucky, vocalist. Come on, Ozzy's vocal skills are highly questionable, he's got a very thin tone, sings with pretty much no emotion. He was lucky to have some talented musicians play with him (Iommi, Rhoads, Wylde) and subsequently made a lot of money. Otherwise his $$$wife$$$ probably wouldn't even have married him in the first place.    Anyway back to this record... this is probably my fav Sabbath album. Tony Martin probably has a voice that resembles Dio's a lot, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but is still unique. He sings with a lot of fire and this abum was his best vocal performance for Sabbath. As always, Iommi's excellent on guitar and not only does his rythm work stand out but also his solos. The killer drums from Cozy Powell is another positive. This album rivals Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and Heaven & Hell for my favorite Sabbath record. The stand-out tracks are Anno Mundi, Jerusalem, Sabbath Stones, and Heaven in Black.    If you like this record, you might wanna check out the other Martin era albums, except for Forbidden. They are similar sounding and very good.

B00028HBKM|5.0|There has been much talk about how gory this movie is, and that it was over done. I disagree. In the bible, Isaiah 52:13-14, ( please don't stop reading because I said the \\"B\\" word, Bible)it says that His visage was marred more then ANY man. Even though others during Jesus' time were beaten brutally, (it was a very brutal time) Jesus was marred beyond recognition, as the bible tells us. That's pretty darn marred if you are not recognizable. You must also remember that at the core of Christian belief (based on scripture)is that fact that we believe that Jesus took ALL of our transgressions, iniquities, griefs, sorrows and sicknesses through being stricken, afflicted, beaten and crucified. All of which are listed in Isaiah 53 and Galations 3:13. This includes believers and non believers, past, present and future. All of mankind. So please, before you question the necessity of the amount of beatings in this movie, know that it was actually much worse for Jesus... as we see from the above scriptures. Thanks for your time... John 8:32... and God bless you ...
0385510454|4.0|The book is an exciting page-turner and as enjoyable as most of his previous books. My only problem came in the closing chapters, and that has to do with credibility. I realize it is a work of fiction but it seems to me a better effort could have been made at some degree of realism. Retired military people like myself tend to be a little sensitive on these matters.<br /><br />John Grisham admits that he knows nothing about technology, espionage, et al, and that \\"if something in this novel approaches accuracy, it's probably a mistake.\\" It is quite obvious that he knows little about the intelligence community and/or the military. In this novel the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) is a 60 year-old Major. First of all, there are no 60 year-old officers on active duty, especially in a rank that low. Secondly, the DIA Director is a 3-Star Position, e.g., Lieutenant General or Vice Admiral.<br /><br />Other than that, it was a great read.
0385510454|4.0|By the title you would think your getting another legal thriller--I know, thriller's not really the suitable term for many of his previous novels--but this time Grisham has written, what I think, is a pretty darn good espionage/spy thriller. It does move along at a gradual pace yet still draws you into the story and characters. You'll certainly learn quite a bit about Bologna, Italy and the surrounding area (almost too much?).<br /><br />I wonder if Grisham might write another Joel Blackman novel? I kind of hope so.<br /><br />Recommended
0553256491|3.0|Surely, Your Joking Mr. Feynman is a comical and interesting book about Mr. Feynman's life and his passion Physics. In this book he talks very in-depthly about his life everything from his very early childhood years to his adult life as a professor. The book is very well written with just enough detail to make you interested in all of his adventures, but not too much that you would loose interest. This book does not use complex equations or terms to explain physics terms, but creatively words each concept so that any level of reader and physics explorer could understand what he was doing. Giving this book great word choice and a nice flow that keeps you wanting to read along. Through all of this, the book is comically written and tells about Mr. Feynman's crazy experiments and pranks he played on people. Everything from hiding a door from a member of his fraternity to casually moving around the information for the atomic bomb from safe to safe. Mr. Feynman thrives on crazy adventures through the physics world and does many crazy things along the way to satisfy his hunger for comedy. This book is recommended for anyone who enjoys a good educational book, but also has a good sense of humor and enjoys practical jokes themselves.

B0000027I6|5.0|After shortchanging Pink Floyd's musical foundation and causing that band to implode, Roger Waters must have had some sort of creative rebirth. This is his best album in years. You get his thought provoking lyrics as usual, but this album also features a strong musical foundation. The music here IS reminiscent of Floyd, but it's mostly a gritty blues/folk hybrid, bringing to mind Clapton, Dylan(his electric work), and even a hint of Use Your Illusion-era Guns N Roses. Roger sings in a world weary tone, backed up by swirling keyboards and female backup singers. This isn't really a concept album per se, it's a political protest album that would make Rage Against The Machine and Radiohead proud. It's a pretty good medium for Roger, as he tells you what's wrong with the world in a way that combines RATM's passion and Radiohead's cerebralism in one package, sometimes mixing in the sarcastic humor of classical satire. Song highlights: <br /> <br /> <br />What God Wants: A pretty accurate sendup of religious fundamentalism, with some strong guitar soloing. <br /> <br /> <br />Perfect Sense: Anti-war song. Roger duets with Patricia Arnold, and there's a cameo by NBA commentator Marv Albert. <br /> <br /> <br />The Bravery Of Being Out Of Range:  A sarcastic critique on the bombings conducted on Iraq for the past 15 years. One of Roger's most venoumous compositions, but there is still a trace of humour. <br /> <br /> <br />Watching TV: VERY sad song about a girl who was killed in Tiananmen Square. Features harmony vocals from Don Henley. Tugs on the heartstrings. <br /> <br /> <br />Three Wishes: One of the few songs without politicking, this is a very catchy, bluesy number, fairly radio friendly. <br /> <br /> <br />Amused To Death: The closing title track sums up all the various themes on the album. And there's a cameo by Rita Coolidge. <br /> <br /> <br />So if you a good protest album, here you go. It could also be considred a good forerunner to Radiohead's OK Computer and RATM's Evil Empire. <br />
1400032717|4.0|The Curious Incident of the Dog In the Night-time <br /> <br />Christopher Boone is an autistic fifteen year old boy who delves himself into a cobweb of deceit, murder and scandal through his deep infatuation with Sherlock Holmes. Throughout the novel, Christopher is able to unlock a maze of mystery with his keen use of logic over intuition.  <br /> <br />The novel becomes very tragic in tone as Christopher unravels his family mystery. He discovers that his mother is in fact alive and has had an affair with a married man. He learns that his father killed the neighbourhood dog, Wellington. He eventually finds his mother after taking the train from his home in Swindon to London, expecting to be able to live with her happily, but is brought back down to earth by an antagonistic Mr. Shears. <br /> <br />The Curious Incident has two major plots within its story that are not intermingled but quite blatantly separated; the first half of the novel is a simple murder mystery involving Wellington, Christopher and Siobhan, who is Christopher's special needs teacher. Once Christopher solves this puzzle through logic, this plot is removed from the story entirely, and the novel takes a far more serious, adult tone. Christopher then becomes estranged from his father and delves into a world of unsympathetic people who know nothing of Christopher's condition. Christopher is able to weave his way through London using his sharp knowledge of math and logic until the book reaches its climax when he finds his mother. <br /> <br />Because of the incident with Wellington, Siobhan suggests that Christopher should write a novel about his attempt to catch the dog's killer. Christopher's purpose in writing his book is to emulate his hero, Sherlock Holmes; whose logical mind he greatly admires to solve the case. But his investigations reveal more about the relationships between his family and his neighbours than about the identity of the dog's killer. Incapable of decoding sarcasm, jokes,or figures of speech (he calls them all \\"lies,\\" since they aren't the truth), Christopher devotedly notes down his conversations and observations; though the reader, able to read between the lines, will guess the truth fairly quickly, Christopher's inability to understand social cues makes his struggle for answers all the more affecting. Constantly bewildered by the (to him) incomprehensible behaviour of those around him, Christopher resembles nothing so much as a human plunked down on a distant planet, trying desperately to figure out how to interpret the language and behaviour of an alien species. And, in a way, many of Christopher's conclusions and actions make logical sense; but because he lacks a normal person's ability to make intuitive connections or understand the unspoken, Christopher has to rely on the imperfect set of rules he's learned about human behaviour. This is not to say Christopher can't also be infuriating, with his startling rigidity and resistance to change; he's prone to loss of bladder control and groaning fits when confused or scared by his surroundings, which is rather often. <br /> <br />Other characters, such as Christopher's father and bereaved dog-owner Mrs. Shears, are realistically flawed and very convincing. They're not saints, by any means; Christopher's father tries hard to be patient, but can't control his frustration and anger, and all too often takes it out on his unresisting son. Mrs. Shears, for her part, is icily distant to Christopher. At first we assume that it's because of his insensitive poking into the death of her pet, but as the story progresses, we learn that her hostility stems from other, understandable (though not very noble) reasons. Obviously, Christopher's not responsible for his condition, and obviously he wouldn't have chosen to be as he is; but even though he can't help it, the boy is a heavy burden to those who must care for him, and frequent flare-ups of resentment and bitterness occur throughout the novel.<br /> <br /> <br />In the end, though, the only mystery here is one that's beyond Christopher's, or anyone's, power to solve: how people can be so brutal, violent, and cruel to each other in the name of love? <br />
6305750750|1.0|Waking up after a 24-hour drunk and looking in the mirror at your new \\"face\\"?  <br /> <br />Priceless.  <br /> <br />Yep, that's exactly what happened to your Gentle Reviewer just days after I saw George Lucas's masterpiece \\"Stars Wars Episode I: The Phantom Anus\\". Dude, I tell ya, I was ready to rock and roll on this one, having just gotten into Seattle and never been to the Redlight/PornFlick district before.  <br /> <br />That's when my buddy Ragnar said \\"you dufus, this ain't gonna be porn---it's dat Star Wars prequel mammy-jammy everybody's talkin' bout\\".  <br /> <br />That was fine with me. I took a swig of the NightTrain, settled back in my seat, and let the power of Lucas's magnum opus take me for a magic carpetride.  <br /> <br />The last Star Wars flick was \\"Return of the Jedi\\", and I saw that back in 1983. Sixteen years had intervened. Ten of 'em had been spent doing really hard time in the Laughing Horse Pentitentiary just outside Mad Dog, Texas, paying my debt to society. Anyhoo, to make a long story short, your buddy the Armored Eunuch was real excited to see what Old Man Lucas had taken sixteen long years to cook up. Here are my rough impressions:  <br /> <br />1) JAR-JAR rawwwwwks! Everytime he was on screen he went to town and showed us some serious OWNAGE! It's a pity he doesn't get more screen time; Lucas should seriously go back and digitally introduce Jar-Jar Binks, everybody's favorite Gungan, into the three original flicks. They'd be tons better.  <br /> <br />2) Cheap racist stereotypes? Nahhhhh. People need to mellow out about Lucas making all his aliens one-dimensional racial caricatures of the Italians, Japanese, and Jamaicans. Yeah, Jar-Jar looks a little like Bob Marley; yeah, Wotto (WOP-o? say it ain't so, George) needs only a sleeveless t-shirt to look like he just clambered outta the Tiber; yeah, the Trade Federation aliens can't do \\"R\\"s right. And have blubbery lips, and epicanthic folds at the corners of their eyes....HEY! <br /> <br />3) When I go to a Star Wars flick, I really wanna spend most of the time with an annoying, smarmy, 6-year-old kid who looks and sounds like every other annoyingly smarmy 6-year-old kid. Naturally, I *don't* want lots of light saber fights, and I think it's a really good call to give the main villain, Darth Maul, about three minute of screen time. That way you get more JAR-JAR, man! And *everybody* loves Jar-Jar!  <br /> <br />4) More of the two-headed sports announcer! Boy, whadda great character he was, and the CGI was just GREAT!  <br /> <br />That's pretty much all I got to say about this fine cinematic classic \\"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Anus\\"; it's right up there with Uwe Boll's \\"House of the Dead\\" and \\"Gigli\\" in terms of movie greatness. I could watch it again and again.  <br /> <br />In the meantime, can anybody e-mail me the name of a surgeon who can get this Darth Maul face tattoo off? Thanks.
B00009MGQL|5.0|Any fan who doesn't like this CD is just too old. This is great music, with all the amazing stunts we love from Jeff's ax. Way to go Jeff!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|In a long running series of stupid cancellations by stupid networks, this has to be THE stupidest. Before we get too far into recriminations and name-calling, let's start at the beginning, where one should start.  <br /> <br />I am a SciFi fan, but not overly so. I do not attend convetions, I don't know the names of every secondary character on every show, I don't collect memoribilia, and I do have a fairly wide field of interest which includes things other than adventures in space. Yes, I watched Star Trek, Star Wars and  other SciFi shows and films, and I do own DVDs of Stargate SG1, but that's about it. I like SciFi, but I don't go overboard with it. That is why I sat through about 10 minutes of Firefly on TV when it first premiered and then shrugged it off. In addition to being shown on a Friday night which is a night out for me, the show just didn't interest me. I barely remember the show. <br /> <br />Couple of months ago, a friend of mine mentioned that he bought the Firefly DVD and was blown away by it. I thought he'd gone mad. This usually mild mannered fellow became enraptured over some silly western in space. I resisted his invitations to borrow the discs, I simply did not want to waste my time with a show that was cancelled and a WESTERN IN SPACE, for crying out loud. <br /> <br />I finally gave in. Well. I am now a converted fan. I watched all the episodes in two nights. I bought my own DVD. I follow every bit of info about the series and the upcoming film. I've gone nuts. This can't be good for my health.  <br /> <br />Acting: fantastic. The ensamble is great even at this early stage of the show. They gel very well, almost as though they've been doing the show for a number of seasons. <br /> <br />Stories: creative. Just when you think you know what's going to happen, there is a twist. I thought that the horsees and western themes would be a disaster, instead, they are so well executed as to be totally believable and more importantly enjoyable. <br /><br />Sets: could this be the reason the show failed? The sets are rich and look VERY expensive. Perhaps the moneybags got nervous about spending so much money? Whatever the reason, the sets are very, very good. The neat and clean sets of other scifi series are not here, and it's a good thing as it adds to \\"realism\\" of the show. <br /> <br />Cinematography and CGI: Oh, yes. Bravo on both. Well done and finally, realistic portrayal of outer space, with no sound effects. <br /> <br />I could go on and heap further praise on ths show, however, others have done that already. I will simply say that I am exteremly upset with FOX and their decision to cancel the show. To FOX: you guys messed up big time. You started off by NOT showing the pilot episode, instead jumping right into the action. A universe as rich and complex as the one gifted to us by Joss Whedon, deserves and needs a proper introduction, giving us a chance to get used to the characters and setting. As I've said at the top of the review: start at the beginning, you... you... bad people. <br /> <br />Firefly vs other scifi: <br />1. Firefly <br />2. Battlestar Galactica (new series) <br />3. Star Trek The Next Generation <br />4. Stargate SG-1 <br />5. X-Files. <br /> <br />I do hope the film is successful. I would love to see Firefly make a return to TV screens. Perhaps the SciFi channel can pick it up and dump some of the gosh aweful stuff that passes for scifi these days.
B00006RU5B|5.0|This CD is really excellent!  Chris Cornell is one of the best all time vocalists, and I was very bummed out when Soundgarden broke up.  When I heard he would be joining up with the Rage Against the Machine band members, to say I was skeptical would be an understatement!  However, I was very very pleased with the sound of this new band.  It sounds nothing like Rage (I like Rage, BTW) and only a little like Soundgarden (which should be cherished, not copied).  And this is a very good thing.  I think Audioslave is the BEST \\"merger\\" band I've ever heard.  A Perfect Circle and Alter Bridge are examples of \\"merger\\" bands that do not work as well.  I like both APC and AB, but Maynard needs to return to Tool and you can see my review of Alter Bridge also on Amazon (they are too much like Creed, but do have a GREAT new vocalist).    If you like this CD, you might also want to get the Audioslave DVD which has several videos, interviews and a live performance in New York.    My only issue is when is Audioslave going to release a new CD?  Come on guys, we're waiting.......
B00067BBQE|5.0|This DVD was so awesome beyond words.  Most people might not like the way the editing was done, but personally, I loved it. All those special lighting effects and other stuff was just phenomonal, and I bet Evanescence themsevles loved it. Well, anyway, they basically perform all there songs off the Fallen album, with the exception of Hello. The only 2 problems I had with this DVD are when they are performing the song Going Under, it seems like to me it sort of loses its rock edge because the orchestral cue is played so loud that you can't even hear the guitars hardly. And the second thing is when Amy is singing My Immortal, that damn audience won't shutup. I didn't pay for this DVD to hear other people sing it. Jeez. Well, anyway, other than that, this DVD was absolutley perfect. All there 4 music videos (going under, everybody's fool, my immortal, bring me to life) are also included, plus about an hr of behind the scenes footage.  Defintley recommend to all Evanescence fans and any music fan that loves awesome music. You don't even have to like rock to like this. Buy it! <br />
0385510454|2.0|The first half of the book is so bad that I thought it would be worse than \\"The Chamber\\". Most Grisham novels start off with a bang, a great opening chapter that immediately grabs your attention. Not the Broker. The first chapter is a yawner, with Grisham getting into national politics with a poor caricature of a dumb president and his advisors (probably a shot at Bush).    The story quickly goes further downhill, with chapter . . . after boring chapter . . . after excruciating chapter about a guy getting language lessons. There is nothing more boring that he could possibly write about. The \\"interest\\" in this section is supposed to be the travel descriptions of Italy, but it does not approach the travel writing of Simon Winchester or others.     In the second half, the story gets moving and ends up quite interesting and more in Grisham's style. Therefore, if you can survive the boredom of the first half of the story, the pay-off in the end is pretty good.
B0006IIPIK|2.0|As most of this film is shot with the actors reacting to imaginary CGI creations plugged into the movie in post-production, the Director gets all the blame for hiring such a slip-shod Film Editor.  The characters frequently react late to the effects, making them look stupid.  Like saying \\"Dynamite\\" when the audience can clearly read the word on many CGI boxes in front of the characters.  Or \\"We're under water\\" when we can see that as all too obvious, thank you.  At first, I was laughing at how ridiculous the script seemed to be, but later realized that this really could have been a fun flick to watch with a little more attention to the finer details.  Like the underrated art of Film Editing.  The Art Direction in this film is interesting making all the live action characters look like comic book characters watching hordes of giant robots fly or walk by.  But with so much CGI surrounding the actors, and very little chemistry between the lead actors besides, the film is eventually soulless and two dimensional.  Anyway, this is a passable rental.  It is worth seeing for the look of the film, but the acting is average, the direction is lame, and the film editing is absolutely dreadful.
B0002849JI|4.0|As I stated in Vol 1 anybody else doing this movie would be told to make just one movie from the footage as some times the movie just goes off on one.<BR>What was the point of the bar sceane??????? the story did not move along, and it would not be missed if removed.<BR>Reason for 4 stars then well good fight sequences, some classic quotes and Uma
B00002MZ4W|5.0|I don't know why on earth I haven't put attention to Fiona Apple before. I heard Criminal, Limp and Fast as you can and loved them but I never hadn't sit myself and listen to her. <br /> <br />Bottom line is: this album is great. I can't have enough of it.
B00064MW6K|4.0|This movie worked, not so much because of the action sequences which were impressive, but because of the way Halle Berry's character developed in a plausible way as she came to terms with her new abilities.  The personality changes were entertaining and quite amusing.  Sharon Stone, unfortunately, made a less than convincing villain and the scenes between her and Halle didn't seem to work.  It was less of a typical comic-book type adventure and more of a human story, centering on one woman whose life gets turned upside down.  Overall, the movie held together well and is worth seeing.
0393035158|1.0|What religion caused the most deaths in the last 100 years ? <br />Atheism. <br /> <br />
B0002KVUKW|2.0|The plot to this movie is wierd. Count Dracula has to obtain electrical life force from Frankenstien. All this to hatch a bunch of eggs to be his children. V.H. does every thing to stop him even turning into a werewolf himself. Its not a crappy movie just a weird plot which drags it down. There is also a sub-plot about V.H. and Drac. meeting before 400 years ago but Helsing has no memory of it. Wierd stuff like that, not fully explained.
B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead's creativity was at its peak in 1997. They released OK Computer, which I consider to be the best album of all time. When Radiohead released their follow-up album, Kid A, they were still in that \\"High creativity\\" mode. This album was unlike anything else out there, and even won a grammy. Years have passed, but this music still captivates me. The album is very coherent - songs flow and blend together to create a sonic soundscape. I still enjoy listening to every song on this album. My personal favorites: \\"Everything in its right place\\", \\"How to disappear completely\\", \\"Idioteque\\" and \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack\\" (probably the best song on the album). <br /> <br />This is an experimental album, with less emphasis on vocals and more emphasis on the music. If you give it a fair number of listens (this album is pretty hard to get into), you will appreciate the music and effort that has gone into this work. As attested by thousands of reviewers, this is indeed one of the best concept albums ever! This is what makes Radiohead, Radiohead!
B0002OERI0|5.0|OOOOOOOOh, poor me.. they left their all punk roots.. oh no, they took a giant creative step forward.  Oh no! they are *gasp* better than they ever have been!  KILL THEM NOW! THEY NO LONGER USE 3 CHORDS AND A DRUM BEAT!   <br /> <br />Get over yourselves people.  A band isn't allowed to expand creatively without being sellouts? If you like old Green Day, listen to old Green Day and stop bitching about new Green Day.  I'm sure people complained when they changed the Model T automobile, but doesn't everyone agree that improving on an idea such as that was for the best?  Same situation. <br /> <br />I was amazed to hear some of the musical ability on this album and never thought I would hear from this band, but they surprised the hell out of me.  The first 4 tracks are perhaps the best opening to an album I have heard in a long long time. <br /> <br />Don't be afraid of change people.  Embrace it, because if you overlook this album because it isn't Dookie or Nimrod, then you are sorely missing out. <br /> <br />
6303921248|2.0|What a disappointment to see this DVD after viewing the VHS version. Though presented as an upgraded version from the video, the colors are awful, the contrast is terrible, subtle light colors go to white and anything vaguely dark goes to black--all the beautiful details of the original VHS are lost for some reason. I wrote to A&E asking about it and they did not respond. And it's not isolated to my DVD or TV (I checked). What a sad way to treat an otherwise great piece of film.
B0002N4ZEW|5.0|Here is my review from the other Voyage 34: The Complete Trip:<br /><br />This is great music, especially the first 2 phases. It is truly music that you can float away in, though the narrations are the one thing I could have done without.  (Actually, I've grown to enjoy the narrations now.)<br /><br />I concur with the other reviewers about the Pink Floyd sound. Just think of the guitar riff from Another Brick pt. 3 and the synths from Welcome to the Machine. Add a dash of the Orb a la the narratted parts and the mixing, and you have trip 34. As these long songs progress, the Floyd influence diminishes, but is still recognizable.<br /><br />Since I love both groups, and The Porcupine Tree, I was quite happy with this recording. If you like any of them, I think you will be too. Definately best appreciated in a dark room on a good stereo played loud.<br /><br />---<br /><br />This is a re-released version of the now very expensive version I just reviewed.  It looks to me like the only reason to get this if you have the other is for the new cover artwork and digipack format, and the music has been remasterd a 3rd and final time.  I personally like the remastering on my Delerium copy so will stick with that one.<br /><br />If you don't have this album yet, then by all means pick this one up for the better price and possible better sound quality.  Look for their next full album, Deadwing, near the end of March.<br /><br />** Hey Woofbear (Anthony), can you tell me anything about this new Warzawa CD?  My email is at kramerkreationsdotcom.  Thanks.  :o)  **
B00005JN0T|4.0|Will Smith has become a great action star, showing his ability to draw audiences to watch his action packed movies, such as 'Independence Day' and 'Bad Boys'. This movie is another action packed movie and is taken in the future, and is supposed to be a glimps of what could happen to man kind if machines could think for themselves. And yes, it goes on the same story lines where we struggle with our own creation in movies such as the \\"Terminator\\" series, etc. Again, we have a movie pointing the potential dangers of machine vs. man, which is the ultimate battle. Besides, some flaws in the movie, where the previews show Will saying to his boss, \\" I sure miss the good old days...when people killed people..\\" in the movie, they have the boss saying it to Will's character instead. But regardless of the few other mishaps, Will Smith's performance and personality with the great action scences makes up for it.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|My friend Katie knows that since I never listen to the radio, I never get into new bands. She heard Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels) on the radio and bought me this CD for my birthday. Now when we commute to work, we listen to it every day. You should too.
B000069AUI|5.0|This is one of the best albums ever made. Coldplay is a remarkable band that grabs your attention with their unique sound and heartfelt lyrics. What's so amazing about Coldplay is the fact that each of the albums they release has a plethora of great songs that you could listen to all day. If you don't have this album or Parachutes, you definitely need to go out and get them. You won't regret it.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|This album was so bad that I threw it at my wife, striking her in the head. I felt bad about that afterwards. I think I'm getting a divorce now. Don't buy this album.
B00004SCX6|1.0|Look I dont generally like B. Spears, this album to be honest is not very good. I mean a real artist is someone who writes their songs and the songs mean something. You can tell she didn't write the songs. She does nothing but lip synch and dance half naked to get more attention for herself, because she has low self esteem.<br /><br />Avoid her.
B00005JN0T|2.0|When you want to see what's wrong with the vast number of big budget action movies, you needn't go much further than I, Robot.  Based extremely loosely on the book of short stories by Isaac Asimov, this film is a crude assembly of action-movie cliches that somehow make an entire film. <br /> <br />In a near-future Chicago, robots are commonplace and something of a servant class, bound by the Three Laws of Robotics, which prohibits harm of humans and compels obedience.  When a robot apparently commits murder, the cop who investigates the crime finds something much more threatening afoot than a single homicide. <br /> <br />Executed well, this could have been a decent movie, but no one involved seems that interested in any real level of originality.  The writing is loaded with cliches, most prominently with Will Smith's cop character, a sullen but wise-cracking detective who has a deep dislike for robots.  You've seen the same character in a dozen other movies, as well as the wise-and-feisty grandmother, the hard-nosed police captain, the sinisterly pragmatic CEO and the idealistic-and-nave scientist.  The action sequences are also often comically stale, with slow-mo, Matrix-like effects that more intrusive than effective. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the movie does have some good stuff; I say \\"unfortunately\\" because if it was completely bad, it would be more likely that this sort of movie would be rejected by audiences and we'd stop seeing these relatively tedious flicks.  But the special effects with the robots are often interesting and the story does become a bit more watchable in the last act.  So, although this movie is unoriginal and generally lacking, it has just enough good stuff to merit two stars. <br />
B000002KIT|5.0|I got this CD because I heard a couple tracks over at a friend's house. I love the version of \\"The Boys Are Back In Town\\" that is on this album. It sounds better than the album version! Check this out if you're a fan!
B0000DI7UR|5.0|this masterwork is a metaphor for the constant struggle between the ego and superego, a neverending battle between good and evil.
B0006399FS|5.0|I am sorry that you one star reviewers don't get it,but, however, musically this IS one of the best EVER. Production wise as well as writing and musicianship this is one of the best, if not the best ever. I like the other masterpieces in their repertoire but this one takes the cake.Get it, you will not be sorry. It is healing for the soul and is great rock and roll.    P.S. To all of the one star reviewers, of course you are all entitled to your opinion, and I am writing this p.s. a week or so later. Not meaning to offend anyone, just don't want other people to miss out on, in my opinion, a great album. thanks for listening
B000002JSN|4.0|This album has some of my fave Zep tracks on it and the only ones I can't stand. The main frustration is the frankly balmy order of the tracks and the addition of below par material. Bearing in mind that you could only have a max of 25 minutes per side on an LP in those days, here is what i think Physical Graffiti should have looked like (in Order): <br />Side 1:   In The Light, Houses Of The Holy, Trampled Underfoot,, Ten Years Gone. <br />Side 2: Custard Pie, Bron-yr-aur, Down By The Seaside, The Wanton Song, Kashmir. <br />That's my opinion of what could of been regarded as the greatest Led Zep albums ever and I would give it 5 stars instead of 4. It still would have been an epic album at 49 minutes but a much more elegent and refined one. I like 'In My Time of Dying' but it really drags; and I generally like long songs! Tea For One and Achilles Last Stand  from 'Presence' are awesome. Sick Again is another good song but could have been saved for later. the rest are not that great. <br />
0792833201|5.0|When Steven Spielberg enlisted visionary Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Salem's Lot director Tobe Hooper to helm this 1982 horror film, both ended up crafting one of the most surreal and terrifying suburban nightmares ever filmed.  We all know the story of Poltergeist by now, so I won't go into it, but what I will tell you is the film has aged gracefully, and it proves you don't need to shed a single drop of blood and it can still be truly scary.  The DVD itself is pretty much bare bones wise in terms of extras besides offering a great looking picture and a trailer, so hopefully someday MGM will release a Special Edition version of the film that fans have been looking forward to for some time.  Still, Poltergeist is still scary even to this day, and fans can only hope for a future Special Edition release.
0783225881|5.0|I saw this movie just the other day, for the first time. I never had an interest to see the movie, because i was stupid and judged the movie by its cover, which i did not find very appealing. Well my dad (who absolutely loves this movie, its his all time favorite) finally talked me into watching it. I was blown away. The movie was just absolutely amazing. This movie moves ahead of 'Rudy' and 'Hoosiers' in my book as the best sports movie of all time. It was just that good. I mean, the movie is just perfect and inspires you to dream and the impossible can become reality. A GREAT MOVIE ABOUT AMERICAS PASTTIME; BASEBALL...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
1881273156|5.0|...IF you use it!!  This book is so fantastic!  It is an easy read and the material seems so obvious you sit there nodding to yourself as the chapters go by. Finally you think - \\"I get it!\\"  I have read this book at least 3 times.  It's always good, it's always true, and I always pull something away from it and am gently reminded that to receive you must first give.  The \\"Five Love Languages\\" is really a simple concept. After I read it, my husband read it.  He even wrote notes in the sidebars.  We talked about it after he was finished.  I later bought my Mom the book, my dad the book (Five Love Languages for Men), and now that my husband is deployed overseas, I sent him the Male Version in one of his care packages.  This is a book that you will not only want to read, but keep for future reference and reminders about what it takes to have and keep a good marriage.  If you read it with an open heart...this will be one of the best book purchases of your life.  You can even apply the principals to the rest of your life long relationships/friendships.  Part of the book is about looking past your own wants and needs to your mates wants and needs...but it doesn't leave you in the dark.  The book tells you what to look for...gives you ideas on what to do.  Inevitably, you BOTH come away winners.  You may even discover something about yourself you didn't know.  You won't be disappointed!!  Two enthusiastic thumbs up!!
B00006AG5N|5.0|This is an amazingly  accessible  disc. All the songs are listenable, catchy,and just plain superb. <br />Very representative of Elvis's varied skills, and just  plain great to listen to. <br />Up loud, the great remixing sounds even better. Little more to say other than if you like Elvis, and you want to have a single CD  that shows his range of skills during his life, and even post mortem ( :-) ), then Do yourself a favour and get this brill  disc. <br />
B0006IIKS0|3.0|What this documentary revealed to me is that Lars Ulrich the band's drummer is a classic sociopath.  Lars runs the show and you'd best not cross him.  He has no empathy for James Hetfield's struggle with alcoholism and treatment.  When Hetfield comes back with limited availability, he discovers that Lars has been working on things behind his back.  Uncomfortable, he expresses to Lars that he would like them to review the tracks together.  Very understandable.  However, not for Lars.  Lars proceeds to give Hetfield a speech accusing him of being selfish and controlling.  Isn't that the Pot calling the Kettle black!  <br /> <br />After 20 years together, doing everything there is to do, making millions upon millions, Lars just can't profit off the other members enough.  And when they say or do something that is against his plan, Lars convinces them they are the problem. <br /> <br />So in another disgusting scene we get to watch Lars selling his paintings for millions.  Not to mention trying to throw young fans in jail and fineing them for downloading his songs (a la Napster).  It's clear that this man is a sociopath, exploiting all around him, in his quest for world domination. <br /> <br />Please also let me give insight into the REAL reason he kicked out Dave Mustane early in the band's career.  After understanding Lars character and watching the scenes between him and Dave Mustane, it is clear he didn't kick him out of the band because of Dave's drinking problem.  He kicked him out because Mustane posed a threat to Lar's control and power. <br /> <br />Lars M.O. thrives on exploiting, manipulating, and confusing other people.  It is easy for him to do it to Hetfield, their producer, and Kirk Hammett, as is evidenced in the film.   He can't do that with Mustane.  While watching the exchange between Lars and Mustane, I noticed several things. One Mustane is very bright, stands up to Lars, and is clearly not confused or afraid of him.  He quickly understands Lars game and calls him on it.  He doesn't get intimidated and presents as a real leader.  The only thing I was wishing he would have said to Lars is \\"Lars tell me the REAL reason you kicked me out\\". <br /> <br />In Lars mind 20 odd years ago, he must have posed a serious theat to his power within the band.  His pathology dicates that he must control everyone in the band so he can exploit them to get them to do his bidding.  He couldn't do that with Mustane.  AND Mustane is a leader with a lot of Charisma.  So what he does is make a big deal of Mustane's drinking problem and use it as an argument to get rid of him.  The other members being not so bright are easily persuaded.  And there he goes.  Notice how Mustane kept telling Lars that he never \\"warned\\" him.  Yes that's because Lars had to get rid of you quickly. It wasn't about having the most talented and charismatic members, it was about keeping the members that he could control and getting rid of the ones he couldn't.   <br /> <br />I can't wait for the next Metallica film. I hear the title is going to be. Lars Ulrich as RICHARD III....
B000001ELL|5.0|Turned up loud, this album works superbly. <br />Ace's songs really do make this album work well. If the comments are true, the disco bass that is played in the main track is all because of Ace's skill and precise work( not Gene's sometimes erratic Basswork). <br />On this album, as well as some others, Ace proves yet again he is the balls of KISS. <br />Such a pity, since when Paul and Gene are a little more focused, they can crank out some great material. <br />Worth buying, even if you just have it for the poster available with Vinyl copies and special  releases.
B0006IIPIK|2.0|Its 1939 New York, and reporter Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) finds herself caught up in a giant robot attack on the city.  But that's only the beginning.  It's part of an evil plot by German scientist Totenkopf to take over the world.  Reluctantly joining forces with Joe Sullivan, a.k.a Sky Captain (Jude Law), she sets out to discover and foil his plan.<br /><br />I heard great things about this movie before I saw it, comparing it to Indiana Jones and raving about the effects.  I'll gladly concede the movie looked great.  Using almost nothing but real actors and CGI settings, the movie is amazing.  It looks like it was filmed in the 30's or 40's, and easily evokes that feel.<br /><br />Unfortunately, looks aren't enough for this movie.  The plot is not the exciting storyline I was looking for, but rather boring and at times very hard to follow.  And the characters were hardly sympathetic.  This came to a head for me at the climax.  The heroes were in danger, but I couldn't bring myself to care if they made it out alive or not.<br /><br />I appear to be in the minority in this movie, but it was not the fun escapist ride I had hoped for.  Rent it before you buy.
B000063JZQ|5.0|If you have never seen a film of Macbeth, start with this one. <br />You must surely know at least part of the plot ( if not, you can check the text on line easily enough); however, polanski takes this film and adds a final twist in the only manner Polanski can... and its awesome, and to be honest, I think a logical  extension of the story. <br />Polanski scores high points again.
B000750OEA|2.0|In addition to other criticisms of this set (an edited Can't Get You Outta My Head video and leaving a number of videos off), the audio is only in 2.0 stereo.  This is a big disappointment as her concert videos were released with 5.1 Dolby and DTS tracks.  Also, full-frame versions of Slow and Red Blooded Woman were included when widescreen masters exist (and were included on the \\"Money Can't Buy\\" DVD).  Finally, all the widescreen videos are non-anamorphic and look horrible when (if you have a widescreen television) you have to zoom in on the videos.
B00028HBKM|1.0|Don't waste your time with this exagerated depiction of Jesus Christ. It seems that it only helps to create more hysteria in easily led people. Instead, spend your hard earned money in something constructive.

B0002OERI0|5.0|I'm not a Green Day fan. I have never bought a Green Day album before and would usually change the station when they came on the radio. Then I heard the title track of this album. <br /> <br />Green Day has created a work of great scope, intelligence, wit and power. This album speaks to the disenfranchised in all of us. Its politics is that of those left behind or who cannot accept this new world order. The lyrics are cutting and smart as we follow St. Jimmy to his unavoidable fate, yet the music itself is catchy. This album speaks to those who wonder why their country has left them behind. <br /> <br />As the song goes: <br />I'm the son of rage and love <br />The Jesus of Suburbia <br />From the Bible of <br />None of the above <br /> <br />Hum along with the bouncey music, but pay attention to the insightful lyrics.
0451457994|5.0|An excellent book, which really had an impact on me when I first read it. I had of course seen the movie and loved it. Reading the book though, was a completely different experience - much less frustrating than the film. <br />The ideas raised by Clarke concerning our own evolution are fascinating and brilliantly presented. The way he mixes these big questions with an eery yet tense sci-fi plot is truly expert. I can't understand how anyone could find this boring. <br /> <br />Another reviewer stated the book came after the film. Not entirely true. The story was actually based on a number of short stories by Arthur C. Clarke, the most notable being 'The Sentinel' written in 1951. Kubrick approached Clarke to collaborate on a screenplay for the film out of which came this novel. <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|I've always been a Green Day fan.  Went to a Jimmy Eat World, Green Day, and Blink 182 concert a while back.  Well Blink was the headliner but Green Day blew the others off stage in terms of music and stage present.  Since I heard about this album, I've thought about buy it.  Bought it yesterday and I've listed to it non-stop.  In my car, at my apartment, and at work its been on non-stop.  This is the first Green Day album I've ever owned and it probably one of the best albums I own!
B00004TJTS|5.0|As old as I am, this story brought a tear to my eye because it brought me back to the time when I was given a small dog like Skip at the age of nine. In fact, my dog's name was also skip.  He became my best friend and to this day,I will always remember the joy and fun he gave me growing up as a small boy..If you're a dog lover like I am, you must watch this story!  The story is great and the music is excellent!
B000002IZ4|5.0|Great music from a great band. <br /> <br />Unfortunatly a lot of the music from the Grunge era was over shadowed by Nirvana (of course Nirvana were an awesome band). This is one of those bands that had critics arguing over if they were Grunge or not. <br /> <br />\\"Intersate love song\\" and \\"Vasoline\\" are my fav tracks. <br />After the 3rd listen I couldn't believe how good this album is. <br /> <br />A million times better than this \\"New Metal\\" (lame a-- Metal)    junk coming out today.  <br /> <br /> I'll go on living in my Grunge time warp thank you. <br />Now where did I put my Flannel shirts??? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0743243307|2.0|Just really never got in to the characters and I felt the book jumped all over the place. Also, thought the relationship w/the young man Nazneen meets would be more exciting or refreshing -- a total let down. <br /> <br />I didn't care about the characters at all and felt overwhelmed by all of the \\"letters\\" regarding Hasina, Nazneen's sister. <br /> <br />Really didn't enjoy it at all.
B0002OERI0|5.0|First of all dont judge this cd by the song American Idiot because that is in all honesty probably the worst song on this CD.  This CD is 20 tracks of great song after great song
B000006NUW|5.0|IF I could give it more stars I would. This is the perfect companion to \\"Standing in the Shadows of Motown\\" the wonderful DVD that finally gives the 13 musicians who made all this beautiful music their propers. <br /> <br />As some reviewers have said, some hits are missed.  But that is an excuse to go out and pick up re-released Motown albums to really see what these guys are capable of laying down.  If you think Stevie's \\"For Once in My Life\\" is a great tune, find the album \\"My Cherie Amour\\" and listen to the way The Brother's and Stevie turn Etta James' \\"At Last\\" into a heavy funk workout. <br /> <br />Motown and Stax, along  The Philidelphia International crew really said all that needs to be said about rhythm and blues.  I spelled it out for a reason.  The young kids don't know the music from a historical perspective anymore and modern pop is worse off for it. <br /> <br />I am on my SECOND boxed set.  Essential music for anybody who even claims to be educated on R&B.
B000002ADT|5.0|If you are going to own only one Miles Davis album, this is the one.  If you are going to buy only one Jazz album in your lifetime, this is the one.  If you want to buy one of the greatest albums ever made, this is the one.  Out of the 750 CD's that I own, this is in my top 5 favorites.  I listen to this CD at least once a week. This is the seminole Miles Davis album.  You can play it for a pick me up, when you want to wind down, or set a romantic mood.  It is a must have for any collection.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|Most artists who have more than 30 years of success behind them usually talk about that one unfinished masterpiece, the one that's swimming around in the brain just waiting to come out at just the right time. In the case of Pat Metheny, his latest effort \\"The Way Up\\" could very well be such a piece.<br /><br />Consisting of a single 68-minute piece broken into four sections, \\"The Way Up\\" finds the Pat Metheny Group diving head first into unknown yet familiar musical territory. Musically, the piece is not too different from that heard on previous efforts such as \\"Speaking of Now\\", \\"Imaginary Day\\", \\"Letter From Home\\" or even \\"First Circle\\". However, there are some brilliant new elements heard in the music as well. Metheny's latest drummer Antonio Sanchez plays with more complex syncopations and has a unique style different than his predecessor Paul Wertico. The addition of the young harmonica player Gregoire Maret gives the music more of a folk flavor at times. Maret has an excellent harmonica spot which can be heard in the middle of part two of this piece. Pat's guitar work also seems to be more varied as well alternating between electric, acoustic, slide, 12-string, fuzz and guitar-synth. His playing is acceptional through the piece especially from the middle of part one to the part's conclusion. Trumpeter Cuong Vu shines with brilliance throughout the disc as well displaying a style that echoes Miles Davis with a slight hint of Arturo Sandoval and (dare I say it) Herb Alpert.<br /><br />Despite this CD being comprised of a single piece of music, there is plenty to digest here. The changes of mood and texture heard throughout the piece make the 68-minute running time almost seem like nothing at all. The strong musicianship between Pat and his bandmates is sensational while the compositional structure is flawless.<br /><br />Applause must be given to Pat Metheny and keyboardist/collaborator Lyle Mays for taking such a daring step and successfully pulling it off. This is Pat Metheny's definitive magnum-opus, a mountain-top acheivement for this brilliant guitar genius. Bravo.y's definitive magnum-opus, a mountain-top acheivement for this brilliant guitar genius. Bravo.
B00005JNEW|2.0|I am not quite sure where this movie rates as great or excellent or just about any other superlative that so many want to give it.  My girlfriend and I planned a night of \\"Friday Night Lights\\" with pizza and her big screen.  We even skipped \\"West Wing\\" & \\"Law & Order\\" to watch it!   <br /> <br />We must have missed the boat on this one.  With films out there such as \\"Remember The Titans\\", \\"Hoosiers\\" & \\"Rudy\\"... how can anyone bring themselves to even think about calling this (one of) the best spotrs films of all time?  It was terrible!  Both my girlfriend and I agree... Where was the powerful leading actor?  Who were supposed to sympathize with?  Boogie with the torn ACL?  The kid with the drunk father?  And by the way... no coach on any football team would take a player's word for it... that his knee was fine to play.  Now some of you are going to say \\"it was just a movie.\\"  But I contend that IF this is supposed to be a true story then let's make it real.  If a kid tears an ACL, he will get medically cleared to play... not some \\"A-OK\\" from a kid and his uncle.  All in all, this movie lagged along, had no strength in actors with grea roles, had much build up but no pay off and personally was a waste.  Sorry to those of you who loved it or want to love it.... we didn't.
B0002X314C|5.0|John Legend gives a whole new meaning to the term Urban Legend.  His voice and style is reminiscent of the Donny Hathaway era, while at the same time one can't help but compare his sound to the likes of contemporary crooners like Carl Thomas.   <br /> <br />\\"Live it Up\\" with its' infectious melodies leaves you looking forward to your next celebration.  With lines like \\"no more robbing Peter so we can pay Paul, going to mama's house to make a phone call\\"  you find yourself smiling in agreement while bobbing your head to the smooth beat.  In the soul-stirring ballad \\"It Don't Have to Change\\" featuring the Stephens Family, you can feel the love as if you too were right there gathered  <br />around the piano.   <br /> <br />With lines like \\"come on and go with me\\" \\"So High\\" will leave the ladies running to respond to the irresistable invitation.  In fact I invite you to RSVP right away...Put \\"Get Lifted\\" in your shopping cart and take John Legend home with you tonigt.  Get Lifted is undoubtedly the making of a lyrical legend.
B00065JTBA|5.0|Wow! I read, heard, and now I believe. Lots of excellent music <br />that is new and waiting for fans. The only chuckle I had over the set was listening to Tico trying to sing. Sorry but that was American Idol 1st round elimination.  <br /> <br />Waiting in Wisconsin for 2005 tour! D.B.
B0006399FS|1.0|Zero Stars would be appropriate. Many of the folks who have spent their money on this are obviously interested in validating their purchase, which is fine. However, what it comes down to is this: does this CD contain anything worth buying? wise fans opinion, NO. Brianwashed posers whom try to be cool among their classmates, YES.     This was the most horrendous U2 album I had ever heard! I apologized to my poor ears for putting them through the grief of listening to it. Really devoid of substance. Music is so lame and repetitive. It's ALL about the fashioned and overhyped name U2. Even critics seem to be brianless when they pushed this piece of crap forward. Bono can't sing, period.     Please stop supporting this corporation. U2 2000 exemplifies how superficial and empty music has become.    [...]
B00005JM0B|3.0|I didn't figure this movie would be able to match the first <br />two and it surely didn't. No need for me to go into depth <br />about the characters and stuff because there are 700 and <br />something reviews already that tell you this.... <br /> <br />The reason this movie didn't live up to the first two is <br />that the characters lack the emotion. The new John Conner <br />is a below average actor... He doesn't have the emotion <br />or doesn't have the charisma of Ed Furlong. Also, the <br />other female failed to come close to replacing Linda <br />Hamilton. She seems to average and lacks the toughness <br />and grit of Linda..... Arnold doesn't show his age THAT <br />much but seems alittle weak in this. He just doesn't seem <br />very tough in this movie. His character seems to get beat <br />up the whole movie. <br /> <br />However, the movie holds the action well and doesn't really <br />slow down the entire movie. If the movie had more emotion <br />it would have turned out better. But the cast just didn't <br />not do a good enough job esp Conner. If you haven't seen <br />this yet I suggest you lower your expectations one notch <br />or you probably will not like this very much. I give it <br />3 1/2 stars because the action is awesome and it had some <br />funny lines.
0385510454|5.0|Grisham's books are generally the only ones I run out to get the day of their release and this one was no exception. In addition, I read it in 4 days -which is quick for me - setting all others aside.  I enjoyed this book as it gets more into government spy, CIA and FBI \\"stuff\\" - which is always intriguing to me.  It layed a bit lower on the law aspect, although the lead character is/was a lawyer.  I definitely recommend this book!  A great read!
0451204530|4.0|I've read several Ken Follett books and he is in top form with Code to Zero.  It's written very well with developed characters and an intricate plot with some surprising twists.  You get a real sense of the 1950's and the space race during that time.  The repeated snippets during the story of counting down the rocket on the pad with all the technical details really added to the book's depth and created tension and suspense. I'd rank this as one of Mr. Follett's best books.  A definite must read.
B0002Z9HT8|4.0|Throughout the history of the 20th century not many musical events have resonated throughout the world as much as this one.  I mean  you can count them on one hand ...The Beatles at Shea Stadium, Woodstock, Elvis' Aloha from Hawaii via Satellite..and then Live Aid.   You can say what you want about this DVD but the facts are this....  Live Aid along with the other live musical events mentioned above were probably the only moments during the musical history of the 20th century WHERE THE ENTIRE PLANET WAS LISTENING. <br /> <br />Get the DVD and share in the event.  Some musical acts werent very good others were excellent and incredible.  If you were old enough to remember ( I was 21 at the time) you will get a warm feeling watching this DVD.  Its almost like getting in a time capsule and jetting back to 1985.  What a wonderfull decade of such diverse music. <br /> <br />For those of you that werent old enough to remember, get the DVD anyway and watch and listen to a decade when music was still creative and energetic, unlike the horse crap we are forced to listen to today.  Its a shame knowing what MTV was back then and what is has regressed to today.
B00005YUAC|4.0|I really can't see why this cd is getting so mediocre ratings - it's very good. Maybe cause there are no ''classics''? A silly reason to low-rate it.    Slow Yourself Down is an awesome track with great keyboard/guitar interplay by two overlooked players - the late Peter Bardens and Andy Latimer.    Mystic Queen is a superb ballad whose soft-spoken vocals contributes a lot. The acoustic intro is beautiful and so is the later crescendo until the pace slows down again.    Six Ate is not my favorite instrumental on the cd (That is Arubaluba) but nevertheless shows how accomplished musicians they were, even at this very early point in their career.    Separation is an average song on the album but not mediocre either.    Never Let Go is my second-favorite sang-track on the album. Lovely acoustic intro once again and superb playing by everyone.    Curiosity is another average song but enjoyable once again.    Arubaluba rocks all the way through. The musicianship here is stunning - the keyboards, guitar, bass and drums shine all the time. Perhaps due to being an instrumental, it has been severely underrated, when in fact it's an incredible song.    In a nutshell - an overlooked debut album, and although not their best, it deserves to be among the best Camel has ever done.    4/5.
B00000AFGM|5.0|This as Bowieish as Manson comes, experimental and creative. The problem with Manson is that he went back to his old ways after this album, because apparently, it was what he thought the mainstream wanted. Whatever the case, he never made an album better or anywhere close after this one. Too bad, because this album rules. IT has great melody on almost every track,and lyrics you can truly believe in and relate to, unlike most of his animated and over-the-top God mockeries. These lyrics are intelligent and relative, and unlike the latest manson (which basically just blends into a bunch of white noise), the musical distinction shows a very talented Manson. If he made albums like this in my opinion, and continued to experiment like this rather than just going back to the easy, I think he would still be popular today, rather than being trapped into a cliche cartoon.
B0002O06N0|5.0|Disregard the review below titled \\"Generic Bar Rock\\".  I don't usually do online reviews, but that horribly wrong review made me want to write this.  Rubber Factory is very good.  But, do not overlook their first 2 releases (thickfreakness, and the big come up) cuz those are equally as good.  I don't have much to add that hasn't been covered in the other reviews.  Check these guys out live if you get the chance... bet yer bottom dollar that yer ass doesn't stop shakin for days.  Patrick assaults the drum kit with reckless abandon, and Dan can lay down the fuzzed out swamp-stomp boogie like no one else.  Every note seems to come straight from the heart.  You will not believe the amount of 100% pure rock these two young men can produce.  Oh, by the way, the black keys have been my favorite band since i first heard them a year ago so my review could be a bit biased.
B0006IIKS0|5.0|this is by far, the best documentary dvd i've ever seen. i'm not a fan of documentaries. but i wanted to see the film for a long time, ever since i heard that it was gonna get played in selected cinemas. so i bought the dvd yesterday from borders. it was a blast. u get to see the \\"real\\" metallica 'n not just the surface. altho it kinda upsets me when the rest of the bandmembers seemed to ignore their last bassist, jason newsted. but u still get to catch a little of him. this is not ur typical documentary of a band on a trip around the world or somethin'. 'n i'm sure the guyz did have a real hard time watchin themselves. Both james 'n lars were, lets put it in a good way, whiny. not wat i expected. 'n kirk's just, i really think he should speak up more, instead of tryin to be \\"a model of egoless to the rest of the guyz\\". The times were real, it might not be wat u wanna c, or wat the guyz themselves want to see. but it's reality, very real 'n upsettin at the same time. <br /> <br />it's a mustbuy for die-hard metallica fanz. even if ur not a fan at all, i'm sure it can touch u in some way.
B0006IIKS0|2.0|Let me start by saying I am by no means a hardcore Metallica fan. I enjoyed listening to  them in the early years and dug them right up through the Black Album. Then I guess I just sort of tired of their sound.  <br /> <br />I had no interest in this movie when it was in theaters, but figured it might make a decent rental, and who knows, maybe even get me back into them. It's safe to say after watching this that I won't be listening to them much anymore. <br /> <br />Maybe I'm being unfair or unrealistic. I mean, I know these guys are much older now, and their priorities have changed somewhat due to trying to raise families. But I was still hoping to see some of the intensity they had back when Hetfield belted out Master Of Puppets from the deepest region of his guts, and Hammett accompanied him with the most blistering solos imaginable. What I got was a bunch of older guys that were too busy getting in touch with their feelings. <br /> <br />The simple fact is, to be in a rock band, particularly this heavy, you need to uphold a certain image. Something is lost when we see James Hetfield recording lyrics while sitting on a couch and holding a small child. And it's really hard for the audience to sympathize with people that have achieved the level of financial success these guys have, who need to have regular therapy sessions to better relate to one another.  <br /> <br />While I do credit them for their bravery in allowing for some of their more personal moments to be publicized like this, as well as their honesty with themselves (particularly when Hetfield was man enough to admit that he didn't want former bassist Jason Newsted to pursue side projects because he feared Newsted might enjoy that more than Metallica), I think it was just a little too much for the casual listener who enjoyed the air of mystery these guys once had. <br /> <br />If you're a hardcore Metallica fan, you're going to enjoy this regardless of content. If you are like me and listen occasionally, it probably won't make you a much bigger fan.
0679721037|4.0|I gave Hiroshima 4 stars.  I gave it 4 stars because this book uses real characters from the experience of the bombing on Hiroshima in Japan.  John Hersey actually interviews these 6 people.  Which these 6 people became the main authors of Hiroshima.  I also gave it 4 stars because in the book Hersey used very good details to explain what they did during the bomb was dropped.

B0006IUDXA|3.0|I grew up with MacGyver, watching him in two different households on two continents (one with subtitles!) as I was growing up.  For about three years, after having watched shows like 24, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel on DVD, I wondered when they would release MacGyver on DVD.  I raced out in my car this past week when this DVD set was released and prepared myself for a MacGyver marathon.    As I plowed through the first two discs, however, my enthusiasm began to wane a little.  The first thing that made me wary was the DVD menu.  This is without a doubt the single laziest DVD release I've ever seen -- no chapter selection menu, no commentary tracks, no appreciations, no cast/crew comments (even in written form), no interviews, not even episode histories or a booklet.  See, MacGyver had existed for so long in my world that I had wanted to know exactly how the show began, when, and in what context.  You will get *nothing* of the sort on this DVD.  This DVD set redefines \\"no frills\\" -- each episode is divided into six chapters that aren't accessible by chapter menus, only by pressing track forward and back keys.  Six chapters per one-hour episode!  Do the math -- each episode is 46 to 48 minutes long, so each chapter is eight minutes.  In TV terms, enough for four to six scenes.    The picture and sound quality are pretty bad as well.  On some episodes this is not noticeable, but on others, I notice degraded sound quality, film scratches, and worse still, shots that look like compressed Avid outputs, where even colour correction appeared to have been skipped.  Sure, it's an old show and some degradation may have happened to the original film and tapes, but geez, the Rhino releases of The Transformers, Celestial Pictures' release of even older Shaw Brothers films, and the Criterion Collection's restoration of Fritz Lang's M (a film over 70 years old) all had far more impressive restoration jobs.  This MacGyver DVD set didn't seem to have any restoration at all.  For a show like MacGyver, as close to my heart as a grade-school trophy, this was disheartening to see.  Paramount Home Video seems to have taken the garage-sale approach to this release -- sell it like it is, warts and all, and with the show's loyal fan base, it'll probably get bought no matter what.  I certainly bought it without batting an eye, but I'm not entirely happy with the product.    The content is fairly erratic.  The pilot was exactly the MacGyver I'd remembered and loved -- fast-paced, enjoyable, with a lead character who's become a towering pop-culture icon, the ultimate boyscout, the most wholesome of action heroes, who despises guns, is not that great at melee fighting (sore fists after punching -- a MacGyver trademark), and relies on wits rather than brawn.  Richard Dean Anderson is the lovable, boyishly handsome hero we remember, and his work holds up well; not too hammy, charming, quite subtle with both his comedic and dramatic work.  I was also glad to see ubiquitous '80s actress Darlanne Fluegel in the episode, playing a sidekick who isn't just a wallflower, and the credits held two major shocks -- I had never known that it was Randy Edelman who had written the opening theme (one of my favourite TV themes), and the fabled Tak Fujimoto (The Silence of the Lambs) was the cinematographer on this episode!    A couple of things in this set of episodes, however, don't hold up well.  One is the general acting.  Especially in the first 10 episodes or so, I was shocked to see some of the worst acting I'd ever seen on TV, especially on the part of many of the villains and a few of the love interests.  Most glaring are Peter Jurasik as Dr. Charles Alden in the episode \\"Trumbo's World\\" and Christopher Neame as maniac Quayle in \\"Deathlock\\".  The directing, writing and editing varied wildly as well -- \\"The Heist\\" was often positively amateurish in execution.  It's no wonder on this episode we find the DGA's long-standing pseudonym \\"Alan Smithee\\" in the director's credit, a rarity in television which happens when a director refuses credit on a film or show.  Sometimes the acting and dialogue are almost cartoonish.  These elements in combination suggested to me that maybe this show was better for younger audiences than myself, which may account for why it's held the imagination of so many of us years ago.    But a large part of the problem was because the first chunk of this first season was an anomaly among TV creations.  For reasons unknown (this is where I wish they'd included some bonus materials to account for this), the pilot aside, the first shows just don't resemble the MacGyver I've known and loved.  The MacGyver I loved has Dana Elcar as the indispensable Pete Thornton, the terrific villain Murdoc (Michael des Barres), and a certain kind of character dynamic that helped ground the central conceit of MacGyver as super-boyscout hero.  Somehow, the first episodes of this season dispensed with what most TV shows call their \\"franchise\\", which is a core group of developing characters, familiar settings, and throughlines which extend beyond each episode to arc the entire season.  Maybe the creators of the show were going for something different, but on the first third of the season captured on this DVD set, the only constant character is MacGyver.  And I love the guy, but I couldn't watch just him, and having no other recurring character meant that there was little room for MacGyver himself to develop emotional relationships either.  Gradually, however, the show's producers seemed to recognize this problem and Pete Thornton is introduced -- Murdoc wouldn't appear until Season 2, if my research proves correct.  Dana Elcar is a very good actor and his perfect straight-man turn helped Richard Dean Anderson and the show immensely, and the show began to grow wings.    I feel bad giving this DVD set this low-ish rating, because MacGyver is one of the holy grails in my TV experience.  There was no show I'd watched for longer,reruns and all, and rewatching something I'd first seen nearly 20 years ago is just mind-blowing.  However, given the poor restoration job, the lazy packaging, the lack of bonus materials, and the story problems outlined above, I just didn't find rewatching these DVDs to be as much of a kick as I'd imagined it would be.  However, there are still gems I remember from my MacGyver journey (Murdoc please!  And who remembers a young Jason Priestley, playing as a youngster who tries to get a gun as protection?) that have yet to appear, so I'm hoping Paramount will still continue releasing MacGyver episodes from the vault.  Even more so, I hope they will do a more comprehensive, in-depth job on the next batch of DVDs.  This is a seminal show, a personal favourite of mine, and it deserves a royal DVD treatment, which it isn't getting right now.
B000001E7T|5.0|While the world hopped on the bandwagon and sang the prasies of alt-rock bands of the '90s, P.J. Harvey delivered the most compelling album of the decade.  Though her contemporaries sold more and received more press, critics and fans labeled her the supreme rock star.  Her poetry, her songwriting, and that infectious voice...her music is theatre. <br /> <br />This album represents several musical generes...each busting with flare and drama.  Ms. Harvey rocks with \\"Long Snake Moan\\", eases down to guitar based \\"C'mon Billy\\".  The highlight here is the techo-laced \\"Down By The Water\\" which, in my humble opinion, is one of the greatest poetic statements to have emerged in the past 25 years. <br /> <br />This is the album to own.  In fact, if the world came to it, it should be the only album you own...
B0002XDODU|4.0|As an American, I find The European Continent to be especially interesting--I come from Germany.  Rammstein is a great hardcore industrial/Rock band from Dtland, and I've loved them since I first heard them.  This Album contains some mellow songs, but is mostly pumped-up keep you going stuff.  \\"Amerika\\" is a favourite of all of my German and Dutch friends. I think you shoul buy this, and also at least \\"M&uuml;tter, and for you David Lynch weirdo people, the soundtrack from \\"Lost Highway\\"<br /><br />Enjoy!
B000002WPI|5.0|If you dont have this album you are just lame. If you dont love this album stop saying you like hip-hop. This is a no brainer. True classic from The Wu
B000044TZU|5.0|Natalie Merchant shows off her vocal talents in \\"Ophelia.\\"  The songs all seem to speak directly to the soul, I am a lyrics-person, and I've looked up many of the tracks to try to better understand where Natalie was singing from/about.<br /><br />Ophelia is a great opener, and from there to the last almost spiritual song, this album is dope.
B000002WU9|5.0|This is probably my all-time favorite album. When this dropped Rae took the title of MC away from Rakim. Everything is lovely here. Beats, Rhymes, content is fresh and original. Really before its time. This isnt for people who like pop-hop. If you like grimey hip hop. You will love this
6304806442|5.0|I watched this movie for the first time last night and I had no idea this movie would be as good as it is. Ewan McGregor is a very underrated actor and he's brilliant as a junkie in this film. This movie really hit me hard showing the despair of addiction. Some people survive it and some don't. This movie is a great depiction of the struggles each character goes through in their fight with addiction. Heroine was already something i would never do but after this movie it shows that its one of the most dangerous things you can mess with. Anyway I was pleasantly surprised at how good this movie is. I enjoyed it more then any Tarantino movie I've seen and those are all excellent films. Trainspotting is definately a winner so go out and see it if you haven't already.
B0006399FS|1.0|First of all, the TRUE U2 died just after the Hold Me Thrill Me Kiss Me Kill me single in 1995. Period. POP had some great songs and moments (about half of the album is great) but it was the beginning of their downfall. Consider the fact that almost all of great POP songs were written in Zooropa-era and you'll see what I'm talking about. POPMART tour reassured me I was right. One positive note though - Vertigo is indeed their best 1998-2005 song for me.    Many old fans said it already - U2 are now nothing more than bad money makers, hidden behind the fame and glory of the past days. Does anyone who hail them now really remember their great songs and how they used to be?! Now, it's almost a crime. Bono IS THE BIGGEST HYPOCRITE I KNOW IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY! He tries to be a peacemaker, a judge, a humanitarian... everything just to inflate his ego, earn some more money and power. He is too politically driven, too rich & famous, almost untouchable with a VIP status. I guess that's why mainstream-critics often leave him (U2) alone without saying something really bad.    What was once a real unforgettable fire, a real honest heart and a truth is now a lie and a bittersweet joke. I guess he didn't notice that everything he fought against in the '80s represents him now.    I was a U2 fan since 1987 till 1998 and no more. No thanks. I'm fed up with his \\"peacemaking\\" and bad, tasteless music. He even lost his BONA VOXE (good voice) for god sake! I dare him to try singing his FatLady falsetto. Ha - no way he could do it. No way he could sing Lemon, With or with out you, Hawkmoon 269, Heartland, The fly, etc. He lost it.    They should better split as soon as possible and stop ruining their BRILLIANT work of the past.    U2 1980 - 1995
B000003TAW|5.0|Weezer burst onto the scene back in 1994 with their self-titled debut album. Its everything you can want in an album and you can never get bored of it. It starts off quick then ends with the amazing guitar epic 'Only in Dreams'. This album is full of songs taht are true classics and will be legendary in 30 years like Zeppelin and Floyd are now. Here is a song by song analysis: <br /> <br />1.My Name is Jonas 5/5 - awesome rockin' intro that will soon grow on you and be in ur head all the time <br /> <br />2.No One Else 4/5 - great song...simple lyrics but sooo true <br /> <br />3.The World Has Turned and left Me Here 5/5 - another bomb tune <br /> <br />4.Buddy Holly 5/5 - The Original Weezer breakout single w/ a great video <br /> <br />5.Undone 5/5 - great weezer classic that makes u wanna pump ur fist and laugh while you sing along to the chorus <br /> <br />6.Surf Wax America 4/5 - jsut a fun songg <br /> <br />7.Say It Ain't So 5/5 - one of my fav Weez songs ever...classic lyrics and tune...jsut plainn amazing <br /> <br />8.In the Garage 5/5 - good song w/ catchy chorus <br /> <br />9.Holiday 4/5 - coool song that leads right into the closing <br /> <br />10.Only in Dreams 5/5 - Wow i would kill for weezer to make another guitar epic like this song...amazing and great to fall asleep to...worth all 7 minutes and 58 seconds of it...gets stuck in my head for hours <br /> <br />Weezer really can't be compared to any other band cuz theyre in their own league and have their own style. Thats what i love about them. PIck up this classic if u dont alaready have it <br /> <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|I have to say that this CD has to be the best one I have ever heard.  They have great songs that tell the truth about life and that is what people need to hear.  I dont own the CD, but I am getting it soon, and I am always borwing it from my friends!
B000003S09|5.0|This band has evolved over the decades and kept a faithful following all through their changes. The judges' comment about rock and roll is like saying \\"this ain't real classical\\" or \\"this ain't real jazz\\" - this, my friend is the area of fusion. Nobody in King Crimson or their listening base is trying to wave a rock and roll banner and say we belong. If you don't get what they're doing you just don't get it. Don't get mad. Just try a little more to appreciate music outside your current reality tunnel. Think of it this way. If all these long-time fans and new listeners are enjoying what they are producing and you don't.... Where are you? Open your mind dude. Let down the walls.
B0006IUDXA|5.0|Now I know why he never said his first name.. (did he ever say on the show?)  MAC GYVER IS MY ALL TIME FAVORITE TV SHOW.  The first couple seasons of Mac are absolutely the best (Mac the international problem solver)..loved all the extra 5 minute preview stories.  Then Paramount lost their edge in the last half (Mac the urban avenger).  This package is certainly worth every penny for commercial free, uninterupted Mac although I agree with most that they could have put in more work to talk to the frequently shown cast and explain where the idea for the show started.  This show deserved some frills to be added but a true fan like me is just glad after 20 years to have something better than my worn out tapes.  After the first show I was hooked, I tried back in 1985 to record each show but tape gets old, mess ups on pausing/recording, or tapes accidentally get ruined.  For years I have wished for a set like this to come out and as I do every so often when I watch a show on TVland or WGN I hoped something like this would be made and just this past weekend I saw the commercial and couldn't order the set fast enough.      For a kid of only 14-15 in 1985 to see someone think on his toes like Mac and save the day made him my hero and I still think of him that way.  A TRULY INSPIRATIONAL GOOD GUY!!  RDA is a class act and SG1 shows he wasn't just a flash in the pan.  He is my generation's James Bond before we really knew of James Bond.  I hope this package does well to illustrate just how popular the show was and is.  The shows in this package to me are the best of the best.  Extras would be the only thing they could have added to make the set complete.  Paramount, HINT..HINT for Season 2!!!
B0006IUDXA|2.0|I was very disappointed in the quality of the season 1 DVD box set. There is absolutely no bonus materials, no enhanced/restored video and audio, and the packaging job was cheesy as all hell.  This TV program is a cult classic and it should be treated as such. I certainly hope the season 2 set has more features and better picture and sound quality. I think I'm going to write to Paramount Television and tell them what a bang up job they did.  And by the way, Bilbo Bayonets is a shmuck. <br />
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Reminds me of the original Slipknot but with the added twist of the acoustics. Corey Taylor has brought his ideas from Stone Sour and intergated them into a sound the is worthy of being on this album. By far this is the culmination of their best work to date, 5 out 5.
B00008977N|1.0|I purchased this DVD in good faith; Peter Gabriel performing his excellent songs live. Imagine my surprise and disapointment when after 2 songs I became suspicious that Peter was lip synching the entire concert! After a few more songs I was convinced. I myself am a musician and have played in many bands over the years. I have also been to many concerts and I know what a live show sounds like. The musicians are playing their instruments but over many different sequenced tracks; keyboards, percussion etc. The female back-up singer is singing but poor old Peter is simply prancing around mouthing the whole thing. He manages to actually address the crowd on two occasions (I assume). The lip synching is particularly noticeable on the end of \\"Solisbury Hill\\" where, if you look closely, Peter forgets to even open his mouth as he dances around with the band.  Now, whilst the stage show and theaterics are well done, I can't help but feeling ripped off when something is packaged as live but in fact is not. Some people may disagree but I felt compelled to write to warn people who were considering buying this DVD that they may not be getting what they think are buying...
B0001I55OC|3.0|It looks, from other \\"reviews\\", that only astrophysicists have been watching this movie and picking apart something that isn't even possible yet at the level of technology the human race is capable of. <br />Michael Crichton is the Master of Future Probability. He takes an intriguing idea and makes his best guess at how to solve it. Is the solution perfect? Of course not, because if it was, it would be Science Fact not Science Fiction. <br />Having said all of that, Timeline can be entertaining if you don't watch it only to pick it apart. Paul Walker is no classically trained actor but his job is to portray a young man who doesn't seem to have a focus in life except to visit Dad and try to charm a woman who is way beyond his capabilites. This he does. Gerry Butler should have been considered the \\"hero\\"; he is the archeologist and expert in the time period, and he is incredibly handsome, beyond the boyish looks of Walker. <br />The movie is not Oscar material, but it can be entertaining, as long as you don't mind the historical inaccuracies of the weaponry used by the French and English during The Hundred Years War. <br />Watch it and judge for yourself. Don't rely on the opinion of others.  Thank you.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|The movie itself - compelling, bizarre, incomprehensible (slightly less so once you listen to the director's commentary, but still a baffling story), and completely addictive.  It's a film you won't be watching every week, but certainly once you put it on, you've pretty much committed yourself to falling under its spell for the duration.   <br /> <br />But I'm here to primarily discuss the diffrences between the two editions of the DVD.  If you have the previous edition of this DVD, don't bother getting this one thinking that you're upgrading.  The \\"limited edition\\" disc itself is absolutely no different than the old one - same menus, same extras (nothing more, nothing less), same audio encoding and video transfer, even the same artwork on the disc.  The packaging is the only difference here, and it's a beautiful slim digipak that looks more like \\"The Wall\\" album than the original box did.  Of course, the original box mimicked the film's promotional poster, so if you're more of a purist in that sense, get that one.  The box is then slipped into an clear acetate case with the movie's logo printed on the outside.  Inside is a fold-out of the movie poster and a few photos.   <br /> <br />What's odd though is that the \\"limited edition\\" is actually 5 bucks less than the previous version.  Five bucks more just to get a standard plastic clamshell case?  I think not!  That in itself is what finally led me to purchase this movie, was the lower price!
0783240236|3.0|I'm a freshmen in high school. In my english class we read the short story that \\"The Birds\\" which the movie was based on, and I thought it was pretty interesting. But the book has nothing to do with the movie (totally different charectors/different setting) the only thing the same was the birds attacking. I remember watching the movie when I was little and being really scared, but It just seems dumb now the way Hitchcock did a new storyline and stuff. But overall the movie itself isn't to bad (for a 60's movie) although alot of the action is very cheesy and the charectors make all the dumb mistakes people do in modern horror films it's still decent if you want a old fashioned horror film.
B0006399FS|4.0|A lot of the negativity directed towards this album stems from Bono's image of being a corporate sell-out. It's true that Bono is a political activist as well as a humanitarian. Whether or not his true motivation is to increase his own ego is open for debate but completely irrelevant. It doesn't change the impact of his work. Indeed I could argue that all actions are ultimately selfish, even that of self-sacrifice. It's a little disappointing if the band is simply trying to cash in nowadays, but in the end it doesn't change the quality of their music or my ability to enjoy it. <br /> <br />If this was a stand-alone album produced by a different band the reviews would be quite different. Also this album should not be judged based on comparisons with past ones. It exists by its own right.  <br /> <br />Admittedly the lyrics are in simplistic in places (\\"..for people like us\\"). Never end a line with a collective pronoun, you just come off sounding retarded. Fortunately this is balanced with lines such as \\"dayglow hearts, neon eyes, city lit by fireflies\\". <br /> <br />This album was slower to grow on me than \\"ATYCLB,\\" but songs such as \\"Miracle Drug\\" in which Bono professes his willingness to sacrifice being loved for a drug which can cure everything, are quickly becoming favorites.  <br /> <br />U2 has proved they have what it takes to go the distance. In 5 years when most of the bands listed here that people claim are \\"better\\" than U2 have faded into obscurity, U2 will still be going strong. Deal with it.   <br />
1400076943|5.0|Purple Hibiscus is a beautiful story. The plot is based on a 14 year-old who grew up under the stifling patronage of a stern father. Her domineering father frequently physically abused his family alongside her, creating terror at home and stunting the psychological growth of his children. Against the backdrop of the deterioration of the socio-economic and political life of Nigeria as it undergoes a military coup, the life Kambili knows is shattered and she has to seek for refuge in the home of her aunt. Kambili the sheltered but highly restricted child, who never thought of herself as lucky and who had earlier been absconded by her peers and cousin because of her supposedly privileges, learns to assert herself and becomes a beloved character, a character who easily understood the plight of those around her.. Kambili at first came to terms with her father as someone who regarded himself as a pillar of the community and someone she genuinely loved. Even the emotional and physical pains he inflicted are seen only as a gesture of love for her own good, but later she comes to consider his actions as abnormal. With its vivid portrayal of Nigerian life, and brilliant dissection of the characters , this novel moves at a pace which is electrifying.  [...]
B0000TB01Y|5.0|First i read the book and thought it was brilliant and wonderful. Then i found out they were making a musical and was thrilled. I went to go see it with a friend of mine who hadn't read the book and we both absolutely loved it.  Most of the music is great and inventive.  My favorite song is \\"Popular\\" but i'm not sure i would like it so much if i hadn't seen them acting it out. It was hilarious. Everyone in the audience was laughing. A great score to a wonderful show which i recommend everyone see.
B00020HEG6|5.0|At certain point I would rather say I was kindda disappointed for most of John Williams' recent works includling \\"the terminal\\"... again sorry Mr. Williams, you are one of the best composers I know of in this life time. But anyway this one totally blew me away up 7000 ft in skyhigh! The most obvious thing is I did like this 3rd movie a lot more than the first 2, but I didnt notice I like the sound at any rate until I watched every parts in the 2nd disc's documentary stuffs.. the one that actaully force me to buy this CD is \\"A window to the past\\", quite flanky I dun even notice its in which part in teh movie.. ^^ , but then it's so beautiful like a sound belong to an antiquity's small village, and I also watched the MTV on the 2 disc with the song \\"DOuble Trouble\\", these 2 alone are enough for me to buy the Soundtrack, the following are the tracks I highly recommend to listen to if u choose to skip the rest while playing: <br />*** <br />lumos: <br />aunt marge's waltz <br />apparition on the train <br />Double trouble <br />buckbeak's filght <br />a window to the past <br />the patronus light <br />werewolf scene <br />dementors converge <br />*** <br /> <br />The rest are good as well, but these meant special to me, especially \\"patronus light\\", quite immidiately I think it create an instant art piece in my head. BUY it folks, it works like magic.
B0006IIPIK|4.0|I rented Sky Captain on DVD and I really enjoyed the retro sci-fi atmosphere of the movie. I won't go over the plot too much since many other reviews have good summaries. I thought I would share my feelings and observations.  <br />Almost all the motifs in the film are recognizable from both real history and the sci-fi from the 30s/early 50s although there are many interesting twists that definitely show the world portrayed is a type of alternative universe. For example, the great opening scene shows a German Zeppelin flying over New York City to dock on the top of the Empire State Building but when the scene zooms close to the dirigible you seen the name Hindenburg with a roman numerial III attached to it. (An interesting side note is this Zeppelin has no swastika on it hinting perhaps this world avoided the horrors of the Nazis.) The first half of the movie takes place in 30s/40s New York City in all its art deco splendor. In many ways this movie is a tribute to Manhattan during that era. You see all the beautiful elements from that period: the art deco of Radio City Music Hall and the interior of the Chronicle newspaper offices, the clothing of the period (I must admit Gwyneth Paltrow as crack journalist Polly Perkins looks really nice all \\"dolled\\" up in her 30s/early 40s clothing including trench coat and fedora), movies including Radio City hall showing Wizard of Oz and you see the marquee of Wuthering Heights on another theater. (As a side note the 6 minute short this movie was based on had a theater with a marquee for King's Row. This movie starred Ronald Reagan in what critics regard as his best performance). All the ugliness of that period have been eliminated so there are no signs of the Great Depression and definitely no hints that World War II is being waged or might break out in the near future. The second half in the movie has our heroes, Joseph Sullivan (Jude Law) and Polly traveling to the Tibet and then to the middle of the Atlantic to discover an uncharted island that definitely a reminder of movies like Lost World. <br />The visual feel of this moving and the attention to detail is amazing. The movie has a intentional washed out effect with a warm glow to it. The retro sci-fi elements really catch the spirit of that period. The robots shoot rays like the one would see in movies and comic books from that day. You see the white halos representing radio transmissions. The ray gun Sullivan's resident genius Dex produces shoots circular beams and the gun looks like something out of the Flash Gordon series of the period. The robots are clumsy rectangular steel mindless machines. The wing flapping robot planes are really cool with their flying wing aerodynamic shape. Sullivan flies in a P-40 Warhawk with the characteristic shark teeth on the nose although all the gadgets Dex has put on this plane would make James Bond envious. The British planes under the command of Francesca \\"Franky\\" Cook (Angelina Jolie) have the blue and red circular insignia for the RAF of that period. The clothing is perfect from the normal everyday clothes to the military uniforms. The movie uses themes from movies from that period. For example, when the robots are flying over NYC you see several hands, in black silhouette, point up simultaneously at the flying robot host. The way the movie shows the robots flying over NYC is itself strongly reminiscent of films from that period.  <br />The plot and pace of the movie was pretty good. I never got bored. I thought the main negative of the movie were the performances of Law and Paltrow. Maybe this was intentional but their performance were very low key, especially Paltrow. It seemed she was taking valium at the time she was filming this movie. Law does not have the intensity of Harrison Ford in the Indiana Jones movies. The two have some humorous banter between them especially when Angelina Jolie enters the picture. I thought Jolie was pretty good in her brief appearance in the movie and Giovanni Ribisi as Dax was very good as a type of JamesBond Q serving as resident inventor and genius for Sullivan. Perhaps the flat performances of the main heroes was intentional to more reflect the movies from that period or because the movie was all shot in front of a blue screen these two actors had a tough time adjusting in what must of been an alien environment for them. But overall I am glad I rented the movie. If you want to be entertained and escape reality, the movies of the 30s/40s were all about escaping the reality of the Depression and War, for 90 minutes then go rent this movie. My wife enjoyed it and she is no sci-fi fan. <br /> <br />The movie is rated PG. This is entirely due to robots causing mayhem, the aerial combat scenes, objects getting blown up, and the action/adventure theme of the movie. The language is clean and no sexual references.         <br />     <br /> <br /> <br />
0060005688|5.0|From the title of Barry Schwartz's \\"The Paradox of Choice,\\" we know the argument will be that choice perhaps might not always be a good thing. He likens the current situation in America to the small town resident who visits Manhattan for the first time and is overwhelmed by all the activity (choices). Although most of his research involves everything but investing, I was struck by how much his concepts fit perfectly into what would be a good way to approach a successful investing program.  <br />If we put less emphasis on his discussion of whether or not we are better off with more choices (obviously we are), and more on his advice on how to deal with this product of freedom, we get a book that is logically laid out and argues its point well. He first describes the environment in which our choices come at us, then investigates how our inability of deal with them leads to numerous problems - personal, professional, psychological. The most important part of the book is his summation of how we can adapt and learn to live with this new phenomenon. <br />His solutions, which he says require practice, discipline, and perhaps a new way of thinking, very closely follow the ingredients of good investing: <br />(1) Choose when to choose - focus on what's important. Be jealous of how you spend your time. Prioritize. Some things just aren't worth the time and effort. <br />(2) Be a chooser, not a picker - A chooser actively creates directions; pickers take whatever is available.  Choosers choose when; pickers select whatever's available. Choosers are people who think actively about the possibilities before making a decision. Choosers reflect on what's important and the consequences of the action. They makes decisions in a way that reflects awareness of what a given choice means about themselves as people. Choosers are thoughtful enough to conclude that perhaps none of the available alternatives are satisfactory. The pickers grab this or that and hope for the best. <br />(3) Satisfice more and maximize less - (His definition of the two types of people in the world - satisficers and maximizers). \\"It is maximizers who have expectations which can't be met. It is maximizers who worry most about regret, about missed opportunities...and it is mazimizers who are most disappointed when decisions are not as good as they expected.\\" - (225). The satisficers settle for something that is good enough and don't worry about the possibility that there might be something better. They have criteria and standards. They search until they find an item that fits those standards, then stop. Maximizers are constantly nagged that they haven't chosen the best. Therefore they get less satisfaction out of their choices than do satisficers. <br />(4) The opportunity costs of opportunity costs - Don't belabor the alternative - beware of getting bogged down in comparisons. If it works, go with it. <br />(5) Make your decisions nonreversible - Being able to reverse the decision makes you always wanting to do just that. A \\"the grass is always greener\\" mentality that leads to failure and unhappiness. <br />(6) Practice an \\"Attitude of Gratitude\\" - Appreciate what is, not what might have been. <br />(7) Regret less - Realize that one decision isn't going to make or break you. Live with it and move on. <br />(8) Anticipate adaptation - Don't become dissatisfied with something that was satisfying.  <br />(9) Control expectations - Don't expect too much. <br />(10) Curtail social comparisons - Don't compare yourself to others. <br />(11) Learn to love constraints - Set up your own rules and live by them. They help protect you from yourself. <br />All in all, an excellent course on dealing with an increasingly complex world. Schwartz's next work should be decision making in the investment world. He's already done all the ground work. <br />
1564029654|5.0|This book is a sweet board book all on it's own.  The illustrations are great and the pace and repetition make it a good read for babies and toddlers.  This book was nearly a daily ritual for my daughter from 9 to 18 months.  It helped reassure her that I would always come back for her whenever I had to leave her with a sitter (and at the worst of the separation anxiety even with dad).  When I was gone Daddy would remind her \\"Mamma always comes back\\" and when I'd return she and I would remind each other the same.  I'm sure she'll never remember any of that as an \\"independant\\" teen or pre-teen but it's a great book to have during that tough stage.
0974872407|5.0|La historia que cuenta este libro me parecio muy interesante, pero aun mas que eso me impresiono como Ruiz Zafon maneja el español. Hace mucho, mucho tiempo que no me deleitaba de esta manera. <br />El tema del libro es precisamente un libro que un niño escoge en &quot;el cementerio de los libros olvidados&quot;. Al terminar de leerlo, fue tanta su fascinacion con la historia que decide buscar mas libros del mismo autor. De ahi empieza una serie de eventos que cambian radicalmente la vida del niño: misterios, romance, violencia, las sombras de la guerra, en fin. De todo un poco. Pero no se desanimen: a lo largo de toda la novela, Ruiz Zafon - a traves de uno de sus personajes - logra poner una chispa de comedia aun en las situaciones mas sombrias y tristes.<br />Altamente recomendable!!
B0006M4SO6|5.0|As a 30 year  fan of Pat Metheny's music, I was pleasantly surprised by this recording.  Ever since first hearing the contributions he made to Gary Burton's music back in the 70's, Metheny has always strived to be innovative and original.  He has grown to be one of the most recognized sounds in Jazz & he keeps growing as an artist.  This recording takes his group to the next level.<br /><br />Using four distinct parts to break up the 68 minute epic composition, Metheny manages to offer the listener a detailed tour through his past musical terrains while showing you new and different sights & sounds.  Witness his edgier guitar tone and how he locks horns with Trumpeter Cuong Vu in Part Two.  I love the digital circus sound at 18 minutes into part two - very original to mix trumpet & harmonica against a textured background.  The constant shifting of moods & textures are brilliant.  Part Three revisits the \\"First Circle\\" 1980's period of the groups' development before returing to the beautiful 2005 melody stated in Part Two.  Lyle Mays offers some great linkages to transition the pieces to their next stage of development. This is very dynamic music and you have to hear it more than once to appreciate the beauty.  After my third listen,I was completely hooked.  I recommend you turn up the volume to really feel the full effect.  When the music finally ends, you feel like you have traveled to a new, yet familiar place.  What a great trip.<br /><br />I once read a Metheny article in Downbeat where he stated that Jazz was a dynamic & living music that reflected the present state of the artist's life.  If innovation is the true tradition of Jazz, then Pat  Metheny has succeeded in painting a very colorful tapestry of  his life - and I give him five stars for presenting it in such a bold and unique way.  This music is emotional, moody & full of reflection.  I hope you enjoy the journey as much as I have.  Peace!
B00005NTP2|3.0|\\"Prisoners in Paradise\\" has been my favorite and least favorite album in the Europe catalog.  The album rocks and was the most raw album the band recorded up to that time.  It's melodic.  It has great live energy and big hooks.  I totally loved this album when I was a teenager and I still like it.  Yet today I have to say its' the one Europe album I don't like as much now as I did in the past.  Today it sounds a bit too juvenile to me.  It doesn't have as much personality as its predecessors, and this is probably due to the outside writing influences on the album and new producer Beau Hill, plus the fact that the band was living in Los Angeles when they wrote and recorded it.  It sounds very American and this is great, except Europe is a Scandinavian band and I think they were at their best when they were more connected to their homeland.   <br /> <br />\\"Halfway to heaven\\", \\"I'll cry for you\\" and the title track were the singles from the album, with \\"I'll cry for you\\" being a #1 hit in Sweden and peaking at #25 in the United Kingdom.  Tracks such as \\"Talk to me\\", \\"Bad blood\\" and \\"Girl from Lebanon\\" are also big standouts.  A good album all around.  Deserved more recognition than it received.  It was released in 1991, just as the \\"Grunge\\" scene was beginning.  Had this been released a couple years earlier it probably would've been a bigger hit.   <br />
B0006399FS|1.0|This band has become the crapiest one out there. All of their lyrics are cliche and meaningless. The airtime these men get on the radio with every first single is so incredibly much that they practically own music stations. By far this is their most shameful album ever.  <br /> <br />Bono's voice is annoying as hell, and the songs are unvaried and unimaginative poppy fake-love songs for snobs. This music is trite and belongs on a commercial for panty hose. I'm endlessly amazed at the music industry's lack of scope and artistic integrity. <br /> <br />What is How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb ? yet another boring lame album that is pushed forward by media hype, this simply doesn't mean that it's good music in anyway shape or form, I know good music when I hear it. Simply put is that their music is not the same as its used to be, now we have overhyped rubbish such as this crap making overrated annoying music that people sadly buy and \\"think\\" it's one of their best albums ever, listen to REAL U2 (1980-1998) instead of this  and then you'll see what I mean when modern U2 really suck. <br /> <br />Some current U2 facts: <br /> <br />1. The rare and unreleased songs were not made available for individual or single disc download. No communication or explanation from U2 through u2.com. <br />2. The collectors edition did not come with a lyric booklet. <br />3. The collectors edition was $40 whereas the cd/dvd was $12. The only difference being a book and a very small and short book. And oh the bonus track Fast Cars. <br />4. U2 mp3s ordered and forced off and mp3s stopped from being distributed on u2 fan sites! No communication or explanation from U2 through u2.com. Many of the songs that were being requested were out of print or songs that would have cost $50 or more for one song or a couple songs! Besides being from fans who have already spent thousands on U2 and that mp3s allows people to \\"test drive\\" them and then encouraged to purchase (what can be purchased) them. Or atleast allow individual songs to be downloaded at ITunes for 99 cents. The rest of the songs not available in the U2 ITunes Collection could be encoded in such a way that can't transferred and then hosted on u2 fan sites. I imagine the technology exists and we know for sure that u2 has the wealth. Something else? <br />5. U2 lyrics ordered and forced to be taken down from u2 fan sites! No communication or explanation from U2 through u2.com. And then these sites were never given a response regarding obtaining permission to re-host them. <br />6. U2.com re-launch with \\"bugs\\" and more bugs. <br />7. Thousands of people not getting their u2.com cards at all or not in a timely manner. <br />8. Has anyone got the Christmas u2.com key chains? <br />9. Double billing of subscriptions. <br />10. 2 tickets for only 1 concert which is worse than the old Propaganda offer. <br />11. Sebastian Clayton \\"laughing\\" at u2 fans complaints and then saying that \\"we're <br />just passing on (the expenses) to them.\\" <br />12. Not informing members if their pre-sale code was only good for the Legs 1&2 or all 3 Legs. <br />13. Scalpers having tickets and advertising them on ebay before the presale and immediately after it! <br />14. The pre-sale complete fiasco and utter disaster. No GAs available instantly! and the audacity to even offer nosebleeds to longtime loyal fans who paid for u2.com memberships. <br />15. U2.com Zootopia crashing <br />16. 7 hours later u2.com responds. And still no full response.  <br />17. If many fans are not going to be able to get GAs for all of the concerts that they will be attending and they are definitely not going to purchase the $165 seats then a Tour Conference Announcement could have been made which described some of the details of the Show.  <br /> <br />
B00002687X|5.0|Europe's 1984 sophomore effort, \\"Wings of tomorrow\\" is one of the more underrated metal albums from the `80s and is considered the band's masterwork by many fans, including myself.  It sold very well in Sweden and Japan, but it would be a couple more years before the band became well known to the rest of the world with their breakthrough song and album \\"The final countdown\\".  This album showcases the band at the height of its heavy metal prowess before entering the pop metal world later on.  The songs are definitely more suited for live performance than for Top 40 radio. <br /> <br />The album is solid from start to finish.  There is great live energy, strong vocal performances by Joey Tempest and contains some of the most memorable shredding by John Norum.  His guitar solos are nothing short of magnificent throughout this album, especially on \\"Wasted Time\\", \\"Lyin' Eyes\\", \\"Aphasia\\" and the title track.  \\"Scream of anger\\" is another highlight.  A fast and furious song that the band still plays live to this day.  The ballads \\"Dreamer\\" and \\"Open your heart\\" are well done.  It's a little known fact that \\"Open your heart\\" was the first Europe song to get airplay in the US, receiving limited exposure on some AOR stations.  Four years later it was rerecorded for the \\"Out of this world\\" album (1988), but the second version didn't have quite the same magic as the original. <br /> <br />It's too bad \\"Wings of tomorrow\\" wasn't the album that first introduced Europe to the mainstream world.  Had it been, I think the band would have had stronger rock credibility, and maybe could have built a stronger legacy.  There's a saying: \\"You never get a second chance to make a first impression\\".  Let's hope there will be an exception to that rule, as Europe have reemerged with 2004's \\"Start from the dark\\" which is a strong return to the band's heavy metal roots (with a more modern touch).  I strongly recommend both albums to fans that like it HARD and HEAVY! <br />
B000002KOG|5.0|Neil's first is actually his second?!?  Huh?  Confused?  Ok, here's the story:  When \\"Neil Young\\" was released, the cover was simply the artwork, no title.  Also, the mix is WAY different.  The story is that Neil, at the time, was somwhat embarrassed by his voice and that he deliberately buried it deep within the mix so that it wouldn't offend anyone.  But apparently after the album had been out for awhile, he and/or the record company had second thoughts about the original mix and decided to do a 'remix' version, long before that was the cool thing to do.  And when that version came out, the cover now contained the title above the artwork.  And the mix?  Just about every song is different, not just the newly-resurrected voice but the instruments are either amped up or reduced or just plain taken out.  Very interesting to compare the two versions.  If you should ever come across the original, hang onto it.  It's rare, very rare. <br />Okie doke, just a little bit of little-known history behind this record. <br />What do I think about it?  I love it.  I just prefer the first version.
B000001DWG|5.0|If there was one common \\"Grunge\\" thread to bands as disparate in style as Mudhoney / Nirvana, Alice In Chains / Soundgarden it was that they all took inspiration from the 70's and then put a post-modern or otherwise unique spin on their primary influences. Mudhoney and Nirvana took punk rock as their starting point and then dirtied it up. AIC and Soundgarden looked to the best of 70's metal like Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin and then tried to make it even more intense and heavy.<br /><br />To understand Mother Love Bone, you have to understand that their music was a collision of irony and hero worship. I have always suspected that on some level, they began by making fun of the swaggering excesses of '70's cockrock but at the same time were completely caught up in celebrating the undeniable rockness of the music. It is as if they ended up transcending an inside joke.<br /><br />This collection is pretty much the Apple LP and the Shine EP combined with a bonus single. The only reason it was released at all was to capitalize on the Pearl Jam buzz of the time. Thank goodness, it came out because it is a fabulous record of a band that was supposed to be huge. If only they would remaster it and re-issue it with outtakes and live material. That however, is highly unlikely.
020161622X|5.0|This book will really make you take a step back at examine how you develop software.  It will show you all the things you (and your team, if you're on one) could improve to really bring up your processes and skills.  It goes through a series of best practices, going from topics like reducing duplication of all information (Don't Repeat Yourself - DRY), to the value of automation, to keeping separate systems distinct.  It has many practical examples, both in code and diagrams, and a lot of resources to follow up on.  Highly recommended.
B0006399FS|5.0|This is the best album U2 has released since Achtung Baby-every track is solid. My faves are Vertigo, Miracle Drug, Crumbs From Your Table, and Original of the Species. Making this kind of music after being around 25+ years is amazing. Simply put, this album is a masterpiece and the songs will likely sound even better live.
B00000J2PH|5.0|Tapestry is on the very short list of the greatest Rock/Pop albums of the 1970's. There are 4 or 5 monster hits still burned in to my brain from 1971-72.  <br /> <br />The most amazing thing is how well the whole album has held up. Artfully written tunes with accessible lyrics and clean arrangements and production carry the day. Carol King's voice won't make anybody forget contemporary vocalists like Karen Carpenter or Marilyn McCoo (5th Dimension), but it works well here.
B000069HK2|5.0|I loved their new album, though it was a lot slower (and sometimes not in a good way) compared to \\"The Used\\", it was still great. My favorites are \\"All That I've Got\\", \\"Cut Up Angels\\", \\"Let it Bleed\\". The only song I don't like is \\"Lunancy Fringe\\" - it's countryish and pop-ish at the same time.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|This CD is 68 minutes of tightly interwoven jazz themes and variations as only PMG can accomplish. There is so much here to hear that every listen renders a different experience. I've listened to it while driving, while exercising, while working, and with the lights out and the headphones on. If you enjoy everything that is best musically about PMG, you will never outgrow this innovative masterpiece. I bought my ticket for the March Clearwater, FL show today....see you there.
0790729628|1.0|I totally agree with the person below me. <br />I was sleeping at most scenes of the movie. <br />This film its Freaking BORING! <br />I don't know why so many people love this film. <br /> <br />The film its way out of date. The special effects look awful. <br />The whole atmosphere of the film sucks big time. <br />Everybody looks 1980ish type. I HATED that time period! <br />The only part I liked was when Blondy was killing the guy <br />with the glasses nearly at the end of the movie. <br />That was pretty cool. <br /> <br />The worst thing is that this dvd doesnt have any supplemental material! <br />No special features! <br /> <br />Anyway, go see 'Fifth Element' or 'Equilibrium'
B00004KD11|4.0|First off most of the songs on this cd i gave a 4/5 but Hush on the other hand is a song that wont leave your cd player. Get this CD!!!!!! or die trying to.
B00015TOCY|1.0|All of Eno's albums up to \\"Descreet Music\\" sound like variations of John Cale's \\"Vintage Violence\\". I didn't really like \\"vintage Violence\\", but I keep it just so I can play it for people who think Brian Eno, Roxy Music, Frank Zappa, and all those stupid guys were original.
B000002KHB|5.0|This Cd is excellent in all ways possible.  Just the fact that these guys dont get a lot of respect pisses me off.  Smoke on the Water baby!! Keep on rocking Deep Purple!!!!!!
B0006FFRW0|5.0|Trent Reznor makes great use of your 5.1 Surround Sound audio system. It is so great to have an artist that embraces technology in his art. He gives his listeners an audio experience that no one can beet. This is not only a great improvement over the original album from a pure audio point of view (even if you just use the CD side), but is a great pick up for anyone that want to make the most out of their spanken new Audio System. I would not only recommend this to fans of Nine Inch Nails (I am one), put to people that want an out of this world audio experience.
B0006IIPIK|5.0|I have to say, as I sat down to watch \\"Sky Captain\\" my enthusiasm for this sort of flick was somewhat tempered by some of the reviews that I had read beforehand. That, while an extraordinary visual achievement, the film is hampered by a weak story, corny dialogue, lack of chemistry between Law and Paltrow and overall subpar acting performances by the principal performers. Sadly, I had let some of this negative talk influence my decision to hold off seeing it in the theaters, instead waiting until the release of the DVD. So, as hit the play button, I wasn't expecting anything special.<br /><br />Now that I have seen the movie, I remember the feeling I got when I was 9 years old and my parents took me to see \\"Star Wars\\" for the very first time. I have never again felt that way after seeing a movie, except for maybe \\"The Incredibles\\" to some extent. Now, I'm not saying \\"Sky Captain\\" is the movie experience \\"Star Wars\\" was. Nothing will ever top that, not in my lifetime. But after seeing this movie, I felt something similar (albeit in a much smaller way) that reminded me of the feeling that I got after seeing \\"Star Wars\\".<br /><br />This is simply one of the best movies to come along in recent memory. What imagination translated to screen! Fantastic air ships, flying giant robots, spectacular aerial and undersea battles, exotic locales, hidden fortresses; what more could you ask for? Now, all this nonsense about the corny dialogue, bad acting, lack of chemistry, etc. that supposedly hamper the film? I just don't buy it. I thought the story was great, the acting first-rate, and the dialogue to be reminiscent of the films of the early 1940s. I also found the chemistry between Law and Paltrow to be engaging and very believable. I even liked the aged sepia-toned look of the picture, in keeping with the whole \\"comic book come to life\\" theme. I just wish there had been more of Angelina Jolie!<br /><br />Seems that a lot of people has a big polarizing effect on people: They either love it or hate it. If you're a big fan of \\"Star Wars\\" or \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\", then this movie is tailor-made for you. If \\"The Matrix\\" is the best sci-fi flick you've ever seen, \\"Sky Captain\\" is probably not going to do it for you.<br /><br />Thank you, Kerry Conran, for reestablishing my faith in movies and moviemaking. You have truly done something wondrous and special, and I do think that history of cinema will reflect kindly upon you.t.

B0002X314C|5.0|John Legend has lived up to his name. There was one Sam Cooke, one Donny Hathaway, now one John Legend. As a previous reviewer mentioned, this is the rare CD that you can listen to all the way through and the skip button is not used at all. I've listened to this CD almost every day for a week and a half and each time is fresh and I'm still not tired of it yet. By this CD if you appreciate food music. I hope that he gets all of the props he deserves, and if this album doesn't receive a Grammy for best album of the year, then the Grammy's are devoid of meaning.
B000000W6R|4.0|\\"Pisces Iscariot\\" is a collection of B-Sides from the \\"Gish\\" and \\"Siamese Dream\\" recording sessions. And, like most B-Side collections I own, it's a lot better than you'd think. In fact, most bands would die to have A-Sides this good. <br /> <br />It runs the gamut from harder songs to softer. On the former side, there's stuff like \\"Frail & Bedazzled\\" (a blistering, yet insanely catchy rocker), \\"Plume\\" (which captures teenage ennui perfectly), \\"Pissant\\" (volatile and intense), \\"Hello Kitty Kat\\", and the tempo shifting \\"Blue\\".  <br /> <br />Then, there's the more subdued stuff like \\"Soothe\\" (a lo-fi, melancholy accoustic song), \\"Obscured\\" (very atmospheric and smooth), \\"Blew Away\\" (one of James Iha's best songs), and \\"Whir\\" (delicate accoustic pop).  <br /> <br />Best of all is the epic \\"Starla\\", an 11 minute marvel that ranges from eeriely calm to ear-splitting, feedback drenched guitar noodling. It's practically worth the price of the album alone. <br /> <br />Other highlights include the hypnotic \\"La Dolla Vita\\" and their two cover songs - a note-for-note perfect version of Fleetwood Mac's \\"Landslide\\", and a raucous rendition of The Animals' \\"Girl Named Sandoz\\" <br /> <br />B-Sides Schmee Sides, this is great stuff. This is really just as essential as their studio albums, even though it's not as top to bottom consistent.  <br /> <br />Best Songs: Starla, Frail & Bedazzled, Obscured, La Dolly Vita, Blew Away.
0596007124|5.0|I bought this book because I felt I was missing crucial parts of programming \\"theory\\" and it definitely filled in the gaps.  Then, there was the added bonus of re-inspiring me about programming. <br />First of all, they claim at the outset that they study educational theory and wrote the book with these theories in mind.      Their theory is to present the material so that several different parts of your brain have to get activated to work on it, facilitating better learning.  So, you are hand copying code, drawing diagrams, answering short essay questions, following arrows around the page jumping out of the text for little side notes. <br /> <br />They aren't afraid to crack the whip.  \\"The exercises are not optional\\", they say.  I like a book that grabs my collar and shakes me around.  I found most of the exercises worth while, but some made me feel a little silly.  The book can be tackled at a good pace, maybe two hours per chapter. <br /> <br />One of the most valuable things for me is that explanations of the way some of the java APIs are set up accompany many of the design patterns.  This helps make plain old java code more understandable.  For example, Swing EventListeners follow the observer pattern and the Java I/O follows the decorator pattern.  Now that I know this, those two APIs aren't so baffling. <br /> <br />An interesting thing to mention is that while I am working through the chapters, I feel a connection with the authors and the person on the front cover.  I feel like I am doing the work for them and they would be disappointed if I didn't learn the stuff and use it.  Kind of like the comp-sci prof I never had (sniff).  I have not felt that with any other computer book. <br /> <br />It says at the outset that this book is not a pattern reference and they are not lying...  It is meant to be read through like a novel and enjoy over coffee.
B000006NPY|5.0|A couple things shook up Billy Corgan's world after the success of \\"Mellon Collie\\". First, drummer Jimmy Chamberlain was booted for drug issues. Second, Billy's mother passed away. \\"Adore\\" is the result; a downbeat, intimate, beautiful album that trades in the mammoth rock riffs and towering epics of Led Zeppelin for the new wave-ish pop and dark ballads of The Cure.     This has been referred to as an \\"electronica\\" album. Sort of, but not really. \\"Ava Adore\\" is a throbbing, techno-rocker, and \\"Apples & Oranjes\\" is a New Order-like electronica-pop song. Most overtly experimental is \\"Pug\\", a song that's both eerie and soothing. It's one of the coolest songs they've ever done.     There are lots of electronica flourishes (drum machines, synths), but for the most part, these are lush, delicate ballads. Mainly accoustic guitars and pianos. The album opens with \\"To Shelia\\", a gentle folk song. Billy Corgan's vocals are as frail as ever on most of these songs (especially on \\"Blank Page\\" and \\"Annie-Dog\\", two mournful piano ballads).     \\"Once Upon a Time\\" is a bittersweet waltz about Billy's mother. Also dedicated to her is \\"For Martha\\", the pinnacle of Billy's career IMO. A towering power ballad of sorts that reaches an amazing crescendo in its 8 minute course. Words can't do it justice; listen for yourself.    The album also features claustrophobic goth ballads (\\"Crestfallen\\", \\"Tear\\", \\"Daphne Descends\\"), beautiful accoustic pop (\\"The Tale of Dusty & Pistol Pete\\", \\"Perfect\\"), and soothing, nocturnal dreamscapes (\\"Behold! The Nightmare\\")    Depending on my mood, \\"Adore\\" is my favorite Smashing Pumpkins album. It's different, but I love the dark (very gothic), lush, atmospheric feel. Also, I love The Cure, so it's great to hear an album so influenced by them.     It may take a lot of listens, but these songs are incredible. Don't buy into the bad reviews.    Best Songs: For Martha, Behold! The Nightmare, Blank Page, The Tale of Dusty & Pistol Pete, Pug, Crestfallen.
B000000WJZ|5.0|\\"Siamese Dream\\" was The Smashing Pumpkins' breakthrough album, spawning a few modern rock mainstays and even a crossover pop hit. The production here is given a \\"Wall of Sound\\" treatment. The songs are wrapped in layers of noisy guitars, creating a dense, dreamy sound.    There's also a heavy emphasis on melodies and hooks. The anthematic opener \\"Cherub Rock\\" is perfect evidence. It's loud and powerful, but it has an irrestible hook.    \\"Today\\" juxtaposes blissful pop verses with a heavy chorus to perfection. And the ballad \\"Disarm\\" is pure chamber pop - sweeping strings, bells, pounding percussion, etc.    Songs like \\"Quiet\\" and \\"Geek U.S.A.\\" are noisy affairs that aren't overtly catchy at first. The musical prowess displayed in the latter always blows me away - there's an absolutely incredible guitar solo, and some of the most awe-inspiring drumming you'll ever hear (courtesy of Billy and Jimmy, respectively).    There's a few epics on here too: \\"Hummer\\" (a dreamy, laid back song that culminates in a hypnotic groove), \\"Soma\\" (gentle ballad that explodes into a psychedelic haze), and \\"Silverf*ck\\" (which ranges from whisper quiet to headache-inducing noise. Awesome stuff).     Other highlights include \\"Space Boy\\" (accoustic pop with swirling orchestral flourishes), \\"Mayonaise\\" (melancholy, guitar-driven bliss), \\"Sweet Sweet\\" (sugary dream pop fluff at its best), and \\"Luna\\" (a gorgeous, Middle Eastern-tinged ballad).       \\"Siamese Dream\\" is The Smashing Pumpkins' most consistent album from top to bottom. It's also one of the landmark albums of the 90's that no rock fan should be without.     Best Songs: Mayonaise, Hummer, Soma, Geek U.S.A,  Silverf*ck.
B0000CAXID|4.0|The Foo Fighters self titled debut is really a Dave Grohl solo album. He sings, he plays guitars, he drums (duh). It's his work, and it's pretty impressive.    So, does it sound like Nirvana? At times. \\"I'll Stick Around\\" works the soft/loud formula into a perfect modern rock song. \\"Weenie Beenie\\" and \\"Wattershed\\" are cacophonous slices of punk that aren't too far removed from some of Nirvana's less radio friendly stuff.     But Dave certainly has his own muse as well. \\"Big Me\\" is a breezy, bubblegum pop song that definetly wouldn't have fit on any Nirvana record. He also ventures into power pop (the incredibly catchy \\"This is a Call\\") and even jazz (mainly the opening verse of \\"For All the Cows\\").     Other highlights include the lush, dreamy \\"Floaty\\", the raging rocker \\"Alone & Easy Target\\", and the pensive \\"Exhausted\\".     Although \\"The Colour and the Shape\\" and \\"There Is Nothing Left To Lose\\" are slightly more consistent overall, this is a terrific album from a talented multi-musician.     Best Songs: This is a Call, Floaty, Exhausted, Alone & Easy Target, I'll Stick Around.
B000000WA4|5.0|\\"Siamese Dream\\" was pretty epic, but nothing compared to this. \\"Mellon Collie\\" is The Smashing Pumpkins' massively successful double album; a bloated, 28 track affair that works a good 95% of the time.    This is obviously Billy Corgan's animal, and he put painstaking effort into it to make sure that every song sounds different from the last. Thus, it's like \\"The White Album\\" - massively diverse, with no common theme. It worked with The Beatles, and it works here.    Thus, you have everything from gentle piano instrumentals (the title track) to raucous, raging rock anthems (\\"Zero\\", \\"Bullet With Butterfly Wings\\", \\"Jellybelly\\") to sweeping prog-rock epics (\\"Porcelina of the Vast Blue Oceans\\") to orchestral pop bliss (\\"Tonight Tonight\\") to power pop (\\"Muzzle\\") to sonic noise assaults (\\"An Ode to No One\\") to wistful, beautiful ballads (\\"Galapogos\\", \\"To Forgive\\") to elegant dream pop (\\"Cupid De Locke\\") to sappy James Iha fluff (\\"Take Me Down\\").     And that's just the first disc!     The second disc is all over the map as well. There's towering, tempo-shifting guitar freakouts (\\"X.Y.U.\\"), raging rockers (\\"Bodies\\", \\"Where Boys Fear To Tread\\"), blistering death metal (\\"Tales of a Scorched Earth\\"), new wave pop perfection (\\"1979\\"), gorgeous ballads (\\"Farewell and Goodnight\\", \\"Thirty-Three\\"), stark accoustic confessionals (\\"Stumbeline\\"), soul (\\"Beautiful\\"), more majestic prog rock (\\"Thru the Eyes of Ruby\\"), carefree romps (\\"Lily\\"), sugary love songs (\\"By Starlight\\") and weird crap I can't describe (\\"We Only Come Out At Night\\").    I don't even think I named every song, and I'm still exhausted! However, don't be afraid of the sheer length of this album; \\"Mellon Collie..\\" is The Pumpkins' most accessible work. You're bound to find something you like, if not everything.     Best Songs: Tonight Tonight, Thru the Eyes of Ruby, Where Boys Fear to Tread, Bodies, Galapogos, Thirty-Three, Zero, Farewell & Goodnight.
B00005JN4O|5.0|When it comes to The Academy Awards, I would be hard-pressed to find a more deserving movie for as many awards as Finding Neverland.  Adapted Screenplay (from the original play), Costume Design, Original Music Score, Best Picture, and Best Actor are all potential winning categories for this gem of a movie (although I do like Sideways for Best Picture and Jamie Foxx for Best Actor, however).<br /><br />I vehemently feel that Kate Winslet was slighted by The Academy Awards after not being nominated for her amazingly mesmerizing performance as the widowed Sylvia Llewelyn Davies.  She was, in my opinion, even better than she was in her nominated role from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.  In any event, Finding Neverland is anything but devoid of sublime acting from all involved.  Depp is equally impressive as enigmatic playwright J.M. Barrie.  All in all, one of the year's best -- period.
B00005B4GU|4.0|Despite rumors that it was going to be a return to \\"The Bends\\" sound, \\"Amnesiac\\" is just as experimental, if not more experimental, than \\"Kid A\\". However, it does have a few guitar driven songs..but they're still very avant-garde; nothing like \\"The Bends\\".     What hurts \\"Amnesiac\\" slightly is its lack of flow. But maybe that's the point. There's a wide mix here, from robotic techno-pop (\\"Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box\\"), atmospheric blues (\\"I Might Be Wrong\\"), pointless guitar noodling (\\"Hunting Bears\\"), to the pounding \\"Dollars & Cents\\".     Then there's \\"Pyramid Song\\", the most chilling, eerie, gorgeous dreamscape ever. The lush, pounding piano melody is backed by this sublime, spooky orchestra. It's like jazz fusion being performed by ghosts. Incredible.    \\"You and Whose Army\\" is also great; a morose piano dirge that gradually builds into an anthematic, gospel like crescendo. And \\"Knives Out\\" is the clearest link back to older Radiohead; a haunting guitar driven song that's not unlike the first half of \\"Paranoid Android\\".     Other highlights include the ambient \\"Like Spinning Plates\\" (a highly experimental, but heavily rewarding song based on a backwards tape loop) and the New Orleans jazz dirge \\"Life in a Glass House\\".     If you didn't like \\"Kid A\\", you're not gonna like this either, unfortunately. But if you loved \\"Kid A\\", you *should* (not a gurantee) find enough to like about \\"Amnesiac\\".
B00009V7P8|5.0|I saw Damien Rices CD previewed online for a while and never checked it out. I heard Cannonball on satalie radio and immediately fell in love. Next came the commercials for Closer, his track \\"Blowers Daughter\\" was in the commercial, i knew it was him immeaditally and knew I had to buy the CD. I have not regretted it, and have hardly taken out of the CD player. Damiens voice is full of emotion which brings each song to life. I cant say i have a favorite song on the album, each has its own charm and meaning. I absolutly love the operatic portion at the end of Eskimo Friend, and have actually got a few people interested in the album by playing it too loudly. Damien Rice is a great choice for anyone interested in great lyrics, and a singer who is not overpowered by the band.
B000020617|4.0|(4.5 Stars)    On \\"There Is Nothing Left To Lose\\", The Foo Fighters turn the volume down a bit, and toss off their most polished, radio-friendly album yet.     The majestic \\"Learn To Fly\\" was a huge hit for good reason. The type of song that crosses over to Top 40 due to its blissful pop hook; but it's like, the coolest, most rocking thing on that chart by far.    There's more pop goodness to be found; the mid-tempo \\"Next Year\\" is a dreamy sort of ballad, and the closer \\"M.I.A.\\" is the type of insanely catchy pop/rock song that the Foo Fighters are known for.     They haven't gone totally soft though, don't worry. \\"Stacked Actors\\" mixes snarling, punk-like guitar riffs and pseudo-jazzy verses into one awesome opener. And songs like \\"Gimmie Stiches\\", \\"Live-In Skin\\", and \\"Breakout\\" are all crunching rockers with infectious melodies.     Best of all is the meditative \\"Aurora\\", a wonderful rock ballad that never gets boring in its 6 minutes.     Other highlights include the country tinged (twangy steel guitar and all) \\"Aint it the Life\\", the atmospheric \\"Headwires\\", and the passionate rock of \\"Generator\\", in which Dave noodles around with a talk-box. How cool is that?    If you're into that whole punk rock mentality type thing, this would be The Foo Fighters' \\"sell-out\\" record. It's very clean, crisp, and loaded with pop sensibilities. I can see where people might criticize that; I think it's great, though.. and I applaud them for letting their melodic side show through. They're one of the few mainstream bands who know how to write engaging hooks, and this album proves it through and through.    Best Songs: Aurora, Gimmie Stiches, Stacked Actors, Generator, M.I.A.

B0000CAXIC|5.0|Unlike the self-titled debut, \\"The Colour and the Shape\\" is the work of a full band (as opposed to Dave Grohl multi-tracking everything by himself). It's a bit heavier than its predecessor, but even more melodic. Also, the production has that big, stadium-sized gloss over it, whereas the debut album felt somewhat lo-fi at times.    There's full throttle rockers like \\"Monkey Wrench\\", \\"Wind Up\\", and \\"My Poor Brain\\", some of which contain metal-like screams from Dave (which, might I add, he can do quite well). In fact, the entire hook on \\"Enough Space\\" is Dave screaming.    What's great is that, despite the sheer volume of some of these songs, they all manage to hook you in some way. The melodies are so strong that they can overpower everything else. This is best demonstrated in the anthematic \\"My Hero\\".     There's also tastes of emotional power ballads (\\"February Stars\\"), power pop (\\"Hey, Johnny Park!\\"), jazz (\\"See You\\"), and lush love songs (or perhaps stalker songs, depending on your interpretation of \\"Walking After You\\").    Then, of course, there's \\"Everlong\\". It's raw, energetic, rocking, but also atmospheric and incredibly haunting at the same time. And the lyrics are gorgeous.     The album closes with the amazing \\"New Way Home\\", a catchy rocker with a euphoric outro that utilizes a few minutes to go from whisper quiet to intense screaming; it's insanely catchy.    \\"The Colour and the Shape\\" is The Foo Fighters' strongest album. It's like a combo of their two proceeding albums - the pop hooks of \\"Nothing Left to Lose\\" combined with the raw power of \\"One By One\\". It's perfect.    Best Songs: Everlong, New Way Home, My Hero, February Stars, Wind Up, Monkey Wrench.
0312263120|2.0|Techno thriller. Somewhat like the Matrix Trilogy, and equally difficult to follow, much less comprehend. If, like myself, you were born before 1960, it may be that you will never completely 'speak' in the lanquage of the computer. Perhaps the best you can aspire to is to be an excellent \\"driver\\" and leave the really esoteric thought processes to others.<br /><br />So the \\"Digital Fortress\\" will attack, corrode, erode, and implode all that is pure in America. How we save foreign people from themselves, put terrorists into the ground, let Ma and Pa use their 401K plan to 'save the farm,' help Father Flanagan run Boys Town.<br /><br />TRNSLTR, what the good guys have, is a symbol of the computer that runs the world. The free world. The good world. It is an encryption device to break codes and I suspect, make codes but it is also the guardian at the gate, Horatio guarding Rome, that will keep everyone safe on everything from moon flight to Amazon.<br /><br />Except . . .it seems to be run by folks with hidden agendas. Like Trevor Strathmore, the gifted genius at the head of NSA's TRNSLTR. What's he all about? And why Trevor Strathmore? He sounds like the head of 'bloody Len Deighton's MI 5.' Why not Bill Johnson or Mary O'Reilly?<br /><br />Anyhow. Just having fun here. It is a great spy-mystery-techno thriller. If Digital Fortress can eat it way into TRNSLTR, we're all watching Leave it to Beaver re-runs on black and white Zeniths we found in Grandma's garage and eating Kraft macaroni in a box boiled over a campfire. It's just that these characters . . . the lovely Susan Fletcher, brilliant, with fabulous legs. Her boyfriend, the English Professor, who is sent on a kill or be killed mission to Spain. HE'S AN ENGLISH PROFESSOR!!! (I can't help but see Cary Grant on that train in North by Northwest.) And Strathmore, the genius behind all this. Is he crazy? Is he Mother Teresa?<br /><br />I rate all books from Robert Parker to Arturo Perez-Reverte in simple terms. Wherever the characters find themselves, do they make sense? These don't. If NSA is run by these wackos, the terrorists are the least of our problems. Larry<br /><br />Scantlebury. 2 starsterms. Wherever the characters find themselves, do they make sense? These don't. If NSA is run by these wackos, the terrorists are the least of our problems. Larry  <br />Scantlebury. 2 stars
B000001E7V|5.0|I just recently purchased this ablum after hearing it was a major influence in the recordings of Waterlog's album Brained Off Drugs. I immediately got a hold of this album and was absolutley blown away to say the least!!! Maxinquaye's influence over the world of trip hop has been amazing. This album is boundless and full colors. I recommend to anyone!
B0002DB52M|5.0|Saw Dogville in 2003 and I still haven't forgotten it, the ideas presented in this movie creeps into my mind especially in this period of atrocities being reigned on every continent of this plant.  The theme, subject are absolutely on the nose and the performers were game to give Lars Von Trier what he wants, Kidman is especially sublime, this is one of the best performances she has given.  Not for everyone, love it or hate it, it is unforgettable.
B000000WJ2|3.0|When Keith's two solo records came out , (especially the first), the comparison to Mick's solo efforts made Keith's seem to be works of genius. A lot of time gone by has put this stuff into the broader perspective of Stones work in general ,and specifically, the best Stones stuff. Keith's hoarse voice seemed soulful at first, now it just seems limited...the band tracks  have a rawness that at first gave me the feeling of being on the inside of the process, but now it's time for them to be more finished, and of course, they never -can- be....The real shame is that, while Mick records can , for the most part, be ignored, Keith's can not, because they could have been great Stones records, with a little more work, and course, the Stones.
B000035Z1Z|5.0|This movie is, I believe to be, Meg Ryan's best movie to date. She and Kevin Kline have such amazing chemistry in this film that it makes other similar movies like \\"You got Mail\\" and \\"When Harry Met Sally\\" pale in comparisson. Bold statment, eh? I mean every word of it too.<br /><br />Meg Ryan once again plays the quirky control freak aside a flighty frenchman (Kline) with alterior motives. This movie truely taps into certain stereotypes but also reveals some sincere attributes that both American and French cultures don't make apparent. It does have the typical \\"opposites attract\\" theme that is ever so popular with comedic romance films, but it works in this case. French Kiss has been categorized as a \\"chick flick\\" but take it from me guys... it's a pretty nice movie. Don't be affraid to check this movie out.
B00005NKKY|5.0|This was Simon & Garfunkel's 4th studio album and what an album. Although in my opinion, their 3rd album \\"Parsley, Sage, Rosemary & Thyme\\" was better but only slightly better. <br /> <br />The album starts with instrumental \\"Bookends Theme\\". Crunchy (by S&G's standard) \\"Save the life of my child\\" follows it. \\"America\\" is wonderful, \\"Overs\\" is overtly sentimental. \\"Voices of old people\\" is not really a song, it is basically an intro to the nex t song, \\"Old friends\\". \\"Bookends Theme\\" with vocal is superb with his lyrical content. \\"Fakin' it\\" starts with t he best harmony Simon & Garfunkel has ever done. \\"Punky's Dillema\\" is one of the best of the album and followed by one of the most well known songs by them - \\"Mrs Robinson\\". The original album ends with two fast paced tracks.  <br /> <br />The remastered edition has two more songs. \\"You Don't Know Where Your Interest Lies\\" and another version of \\"Old Friends\\". The remastered sound is very good. Get some of these S&G album for a peaceful evening. All of their album are worth the investment, you can buy the Columbia Studio recordings 5 CD box set, or Old friends box set. In case you want to get individual albums, get the last three albums first (first Parsley, Sage, Rosemary & Thyme, then Bookends and then Bridge over troubled water or you can buy all three together). You will be delighted.   <br />
B000286RNY|5.0|This movie is great! Yes... it's very silly, but it's supposed to be! I guess some hoity-toity reviewers are too smug to enjoy a lighthearted comedy like this. It's a shame. Why be serious all the time? Real life is so serious anyways. Thats why people enjoy  these kind of movies. Oh well.<br /><br />Anyways... I found myself giggling about this movie, just thinking about certain scenes, all day the very next day. This movie has some decent special effects, funny dialogues, and some crazy characters. All in all, this movie is definatley worth checking out. :)
B00001OH7P|5.0|This is an album that must be heard to believe it. Calling it epitome of glam-rock does not say anything. From start to finish, it is such an unusual experience that I have no idea how to describe it. I though album like \\"Heroes\\" cannot be topped, I was a fool because Ziggy can do anything. Although the album has to be listened in its entire but even the single tracks are brilliant. Apar t from the hit \\"Starman\\", the other standouts are usual rocker \\"Suffragette City\\", \\"Soul Love\\".  <br /> <br />No, can't even find a good track here, all are either very good or excellent. I am quite sure this is a great starting point to Bowie's music. I agree with most of the world, that it is a masterpiece which cannot be ignored. I fail to understand why the most entertaining album of all time has not sold too many copies. <br /> <br />This particular version is remastered with good artworks. Get  it without any hesitation, you won't regret if you like rock n' roll in general.  <br /> <br />
B000006TRV|5.0|I'm a huge Pink Floyd fan. I still cannot put into words how great this album is. I have been listening to it for over 20 years. I think my first copy was in 82 when I was 8 or 9 years old. To go through and break the songs down one by one would take away from the purpose of the album. If you listen to this it must be all the way the through. Sure, I can now skip around but that is because I have the thing memorized. I don't even think I can name favorites because at one time or another every song except the story pieces was a favorite. The vocals as with anything Pink Floyd releases are less important then the actual words, the music, nothing compares to this. It has more of the Roger Waters feel to it then any other release except The Final Cut. You can talk all day about concept albums, The Who's Tommy, Queen Night at the Opera and Genesis Lamb Lies Down on Broadway come to mind but none compare to The Wall. You get the story of a young man who is named Pink. The songs weave a story of his overprotective mother, infidelity and loads of paranoia. This is Roger Waters masterpiece. Sure I am a bigger fan of David Gilmour but Roger shows that he had a touch of Syd Barrett-esque genius. Please do not buy this and only listen to Another Brick in the Wall or Comfortably Numb. Listen to it all the way through. I find it works perfect at work. The lady in the cubicle next to mine has even started to like it. I heard her singing some of it the other day. I still do not consider this their best album or their most essential, I would go in this order, 1. Wish You Were Here 2. Dark Side of the Moon 3. A Saucerful of Secrets 4. The Wall and after that is up to you but be warned. Once pulled into the world of Pink Floyd it's hard to get out. My collection now consists of over 100 cds, bootlegs, live and studio and I am still looking for more. No question in my mind they are the greatest band ever, Radiohead, U2, listen to Floyd and hear the influence whether they admit it or not. Sure The Wall has some teenager-angst but still it is perfect in telling the story of the life of Pink. Don't forget the DVD, it's great too. Definite buy
B000065VA1|5.0|No doubt, if there is one Peter Gabriel album which won multi-million hearts, this is it. When I say this I am not only refering to its multi-platinum status but its accessible body of work. It is quite understandably his most popular among non-fans. While fans are almost equally distributed to call \\"So\\", \\"PG3:Melt\\", \\"PG4:Security\\", \\"Up\\", \\"Us\\", \\"Passion\\" as his best. I really can't clearly decide which is my favorite among these but I think...I like PG4 a little more than others.<br /><br />On to \\"So\\", as I and other reviewers indicated this is less brooding in nature and contains two of PGs roller coaster tracks namely \\"Sledgehammer\\" and \\"Big time\\" which has some BIG sound. They are also two of the hits from the album but I like the seven other tracks more. One of his most wonderful tunes \\"Red Rain\\" opens the album, PGs vocal reflects the perfect emotions required to sing this song. After the perfect opening, comes the Earthshaking \\"Sledgehammer\\" and followed by another gem \\"Don't Give Up\\", a song of hope against all odds, which also got a vocal contribution from Kate Bush. The lilting \\"That Voice Again\\" and \\"Mercy Street\\" continues the flow of great songs. \\"Big Time\\", a good song, breaks it. \\"We Do What We're Told (Milgram's 37)\\" is average but the album closes with two very good songs, among those \\"In Your Eyes\\" is fan favorite.  This is a must have in every regard.<br /><br />If you are a Gabriel/Genesis fan you probably have it, if you don't, what are you waiting for? Get this now. If you a not a fan but want to try some Gabriel, I would say start right here and after satisfaction, get \\"Us\\", \\"PG3\\", \\"Up\\", \\"PG4\\", \\"Passion\\" in sequence. I am quite sure Gabriel is about to get a new admirer. Can you see that \\"Add to shopping cart\\" button in the page?

0553212737|4.0|My mom got this book from the library not long after we saw the movie with Gwyneth Paltrow. She found out in the movie credits that it was based on a book (we caught the movie on TV by chance) and found out it was by Jane Austen. Since her favorite book is Pride and Prejudice (which she had tried to get me to read for years without success) she read the book, as I did soon after. It's funny that even though Emma is one of Austen's longer books, it took only one movie to render it perfectly, whereas the much shorter Pride and Prejudice needed seven videos altogether!<br /><br />However, this is a review about the book, not the movie. Ahem. The book was great, and like all Austen's books never loses your interest. It is a bit drawn out and your mind may wander a bit during the course of the story, but it was a great story. Emma, the character Austen said no one would like, is much more likeable to me than the pathetic sop that is Fanny of Mansfield Park. She is much different than all other Austen characters; she is rich and has a thirty thousand pound dowry (at least I think so, I forget exactly; I read the book a while ago) which is a lot compared to the other penniless heroines who have at the most a thousand pounds. She is twenty-one, handsome, and though her snobbery is a turn off at the start of the book, you can't help but fall for her charms. She is, as the reviews say, irresistible. And Mr. Knightly is just like most other Austen heroes; a real dreamy guy -sigh- I'm so jealous of these girls. He's not romantic though, and unlike other books, the romance is a minimum, with barely an, \\"I love you\\" in sight.<br /><br />The situations are original and entertaining, and the mismatches of Emma the would-be matchmaker (with no sight in mind of marriage for herself) are very amusing. I would recommend this book to any Austen fan, but for beginners I would recommend Pride and Prejudice or Northanger Abbey, as they are shorter and much lighter, funnier stories. Emma is a bit more quaint. My only complaint is the speeches of that girl who talks too much, what's-her-name; she talks for pages on end, interrupts herself and is in general much more boring than amusing. Highly recommended, buy it now!!!a is a bit more quaint.

B000002ILG|4.0|I didn't even know the names of the band members. All I knew is the band had some great songs off this cd!!! This was actually one of the first cds I ever bought!!! It came out in the spring of 88', the year I graduated so \\"Wait\\" always takes me back in time when I hear it. This project had some staying power by the way. \\"When the Children Cry\\" took \\"Pride\\" into 1989! I loved all styles of music back then and when an artist had good stuff, I bought it. This is good stuff. Not for each member of the band, but the band as a whole and the music.
0553213105|5.0|This is my mom's favorite book, which I have finally read this year after long years of her trying to get me to read it. Since I had to read Sense and Sensibility for my college course, I went on to reading all of Austen's novels. I am currently on my last one; Persuasions. Pride and Prejudice is the most popular of Austen's novel, I think, and for good reason. The characters are funny and interesting, the plot is original, and the social satire of England in Austen's time is hugely enjoyable. Elizabeth Bennet, Austen's own favorite character, is a headstrong, affectionate girl who represents the `prejudice' of the title. And Fitzwilliam Darcy (aka Mr. Darcy, but I like his name O_O) is the `pride' and is filthy rich, arrogant and rude. It goes without saying that I fell in love with him at first sight (or first mention of him in the story). Mr. Darcy, Mr. Knightly and that hero from Northanger Abbey are the cutest heroes of all Austen's novels!!! (=^-^=) &lt;Purrrrr)<br /><br />Anyhoo, enough drooling. (Mentally slaps face-get your act together--!!)<br />The characters of the novel, though the most colorful and animated, are also the least believable. They are larger than life, great for the story, but I don't see them as flesh and blood people. Mrs.Bennet, with her obsession for marrying her daughters is perfectly understandable, but her happiness even when one girl elopes with a good-for-nothing, and the way she won't understand her husband's complete disapproval is just mind-boggling. The stupid characters are soooo stupid, Elizabeth's father- even though he is very likeable- is actually a pretty bad father concerning his duties towards his daughters and fear for their welfare, though all that changes near the end.<br /><br />In any case, I loved the book, it was funny and highly enjoyable. I'm glad I read it. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in reading a classic, and even those who are not. If you don't mind quaint-sounding passages and writing that is sometimes a bit confusing, try out Jane Austen. Once you get the hang of the language you can really enjoy this great book!! Buy it now!that is sometimes a bit confusing, try out Jane Austen. Once you get the hang of the language you can really enjoy this great book!! Buy it now!
B0006SNL2K|5.0|Sure its all Mainstream and not as hard as you thought but it is a good metal album and this album is not worth 2 stars dude. Its worth more than 5, the orginal version is 5 this one with the extra tracks i must say liek 8 becuz i have heard all these songs even tho i dont own it i heard them b4 they came out onto this cd and the tracks are amazing, true maggots will love this <br /> <br />dont forget SlipKnoT is on tour now with Shadows Fall and Lamb of God!
0141439661|4.0|I had to read this book for my college novel course. It hooked me on Jane Austen. I am currently reading Persuasions, which is the last book I have to read to have finished all her books! And then I can go around showing off how cultured and well-read I am. Blah blah blah.<br /><br />Anyway, this book has a really great heroine, Elinor, who is perhaps my favorite heroine because she's so much like me, introspective and cautious, and carefully controlled. Her sister Marianne, who is said to be the `life of the novel' and `more likeable', is actually a silly, foolishly romantic girl who is passionate and loving. Sure, you love her, but you don't really like her (at least I didn't) and you certainly don't respect her. Elinor however, earns your respect and admiration for her steady character and sense. If you don't know, `sensibility' is the opposite of sense, it means emotionality and imprudence etc. (I learned that in college!!!) It isn't a common word nowadays, so I thought I'd let you in on the plot. Elinor is sense, Marianne sensibility, and you should be more like Elinor etc. It's a story with a moral, you see, like Pride and Prejudice (Elizabeth is prejudice and Mr. Darcy pride).<br /><br />The mother, Mrs. Dashwood, is really weird; she isn't always after her daughters to marry well. She is looking for romance as much as her girls are, as opposed to Mrs. Burton from Pride and Prejudice, who rejoices even when her daughter marries a good for nothing, simply because she's married. It was a good book, with surprising and unexpected plot twists that are pretty complicated, plus loveable characters and a good romance. It almost had me in tears at the end which is a miracle because I never cry, and almost never am moved to tears by a book or movie. Great book, try it out!!
0767834739|2.0|i didnt have high expectations to be crushed simply because this isnt that kind of franchise.this isnt like the disaster AvsP is.nothing is.but this is a typical big budget action/horror movie.i dont beleive in leaving my brain,the most important part of most movie goers,at the door,but i didnt have to.i kinda got the gist from part one and this continues from that well.if i were a rabid R/E fan then maybe i would be more thrilled with this.video games turned into movies doesnt really get my undying attention.something about it seems for lack of a better word,''fake''.i liked it enough where as i wasnt bored.i took whatever i saw for granted,i didnt get a headache if everything didnt make sense.so on those terms,its not a bad movie,coming from a person not a R/E fan to begin with.
B000063DFN|5.0|In the 80s, Iron Maiden never failed to deliever to their fans. with each album they took it up a notch, until they peaked at Powerslave. If your a metal fan and this isnt in your collection, somethings seriously wrong! <br /> <br />Aces High: 10/10- great song! one of the two hits on the album, really fast paced and energetic. guaranteed to get you pumped for the album <br /> <br />2 Minutes to Midnight: 10/10- great lyrics and a classic guitar riff. the other hit on the album <br /> <br />Losfer Words: 8/10- im not big on instrumentals, but this is short and to the point so i suppose it deserves a good review <br /> <br />Flash of the Blade: 9/10- catchy but gets a bit boring sometimes <br /> <br />The Duelists: 9/10- Alot like Flash of the Blade, pretty good and catchy but boring at times <br /> <br />Back in the Village: 10/10- Sequel to The Prisoner from \\"The Number of the Beast\\". i personally like this song, pretty fast song <br /> <br />Powerslave: 10/10- High point on the album, very good song with an egyptian theme. classic chorus <br /> <br />Rime of the Ancient Mariner: 10/10- A little overrated but still a wonderfully composed song with a good tune. 13 minutes can be hard to endure, but its well worth it. <br /> <br />Grade: 76/80 A <br /> <br />awesome album
0688170528|5.0|Annotation: Two teens who have grown up next door together from birth and have spent most of their lives with each other are now 17 years old and dating. One night both sets of parents get the phone call no parent ever hopes to get: their daughter is dead and their son is hurt but alive and with her. This is first considered a suicide pact and then a murder. As the months go on the son ends up in jail awaiting his trial. This story follows two families that are as close as can be but are now seperated. It has a suprise ending... this is all I want to can say because I don't want to ruin the book  <br /> <br />Author Bio: Jodi Picoult has received an A.B in creative writing from Princeton and a master's in education from Harvard. The Pact has just recently been made into a film by Lifetime and she has also written 6 other novels. She resides in New Hampshire with her husband and 3 children.  <br /> <br />Evaluation: I could not put this book down. It was a tear jerker and you could feel the emotion of book very strongly. This is by far one of the best books I have ever read and I would like to find a copy of the movie. All I have to say is that I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone and it's a very touching story. You will not forget it.

0385510454|2.0|I appauld the writer for arriving at that sweet spot in life where he can go on a working vacation to Italy for however long he chooses to write another book.  Grisham is a great writer, but this is not a great book by any stretch. It's not even a good book even though Grisham's talent at wordcraft and sentence structure is ever apparent.  The story was dull, the outcome insipid and tired.  I listened to the audio version and the speaker  is truly outstanding in bringing this tired book to life.  Save your money or you will be as exhausted as the protaganist as you struggle to jusify your purchase.  Not Grisham's best - almost his worst.
B0002O06N0|2.0|Contrary to popular thought the Black Keys do in fact not rock. In fact they are quite boring. Akron, Ohio was once the home of Devo and the Rubber City Rebels. Good stuff that had gusto and energy. Albeit a long time ago. This is flat, \\"young white guy trying to sound like an old weathered black guy\\" blues. I'm insulted I ever listened to the reviews.  <br />To rock you have to put forth some passion and some kind of drive. This has none of that. And hooks? None to be found. The lyrics are quite simple. Woe is me...my girl is gone. But I got no sympathy here.
B00005RHGL|4.0|<br />They say Gone with the Wind seems richer than it really is because it had something like four directors, each of which put his slightly different vision into his scenes. <br /> <br />Well, much of the appeal of Tombstone is pretty well from the same source. I believe that the first director of this film was a history fanatic and wanted to make the movie extremely historically accurate - and then he was replaced by George Cosmatos, a total action movie director. He made the movie much more of an action movie...but still heavily informed by the script, acting styles, costuming and props that were already in place. <br /> <br />The result is a glorious mishmash. Had this movie been simply a action movie from the start, we wouldn't have got all the period costumes and dialect which is so much a part of the experience. On the other hand, without Cosmatos, would we have had the badass style and gunplay? We might have ended up with something more like Costner's Wyatt Earp (yawn). <br /> <br />I was obsessed with this movie in high school, and it is still the epitome of cool. Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday is just too cool - a Gone with the Wind aristocrat who has taken up killing, drinking and poker for his trade. He gets the best lines in the movie - \\"Why Johnny Ringo. You look like somebody just - walked over yo' *grave\\"...\\"  <br />But his character is also rather pitiable, and his final deathbed speech is extremely moving. <br /> <br />Kurt Russel as Wyatt Earp is also extremely cool. Especially with his red ties. <br /> <br />Portions of the movie are exhaustively accurate. The leadup to the OK Corral shooting is excruciatingly accurate, with every action being shown, blow by blow, such as the pistol whipping of Ike clanton. In the shootout itself, every line is accurate as reported in the ensuing court case, and the incidents of the gunfight are accurately staged. <br /> <br />Yet the shootout is also a fantastic piece of gunplay. Here again is the interaction between two different aesthetics - see Costner's film for an equally accurate reconstruction of the exact same scene which is nontheless very dull... <br /> <br />Despite the above, this movie is very flawed. The movie seems to have been made in a rush and without much care. The inconsistencies between the two directorial styles makes some characters difficult to understand, and much of the post-OK Corrall portions are a complete mess. But the very end of the film is well made and wraps up all the characters, so the movie manages to survive its own flaws.

0060589272|2.0|Surprisingly, I still don't know what this book was about. Too short to really develop a character, too abrupt to set an atmosphere, but too long to be a short read you can quickly decide to put away. It talks quite a bit about sex, a bit about love, but doesn't really develop either of these subjects. It lacks the depth of insight into the many variations of love and sex that are the part of our varied race. It focuses on stereotypes (there are three types of men, there are three types of prostitutes, etc), and as such, may be even brutal in bringing our attention to the reality of life as many see it. However, BECAUSE it focuses on stereotypes, it paints everything in black and white and misses out on the grey hues. And life, for the most part, is not about black or white, but about everything that is in-between.  <br /> <br />It presents only one point of view of a very young person who prefers to see the glass half empty. One a positive side, the story does end letting the reader know that life has so much more to offer, and those taking the risk may be rewarded for it. <br /> <br />I haven't learned much from reading of the novel. It was probably worth the time, but dissapointing in the long run. Just another novel, but I've seen others do a better job at exploring human sexuality and love. So, no big \\"O\\" for me.

B000001EAQ|5.0|<br />This is U2 at their most experimental and darkest hour. Simply fantastic. As a fan pointed out, this is actually their last masterpiece, trust me.  <br /> <br />Don't believe what brianless 'fans' ( who love the crappy mainstream sell out U2 2000 ) say about this masterpiece. Easily the most original in U2's career. ATYCLB and HTDAAB lovers simply can't say the same about U2 2000. The Ipod band - former U2 - is just a horrible joke from their 80's albums, Ridiculously overhyped and overrated by the mass media ( surely paid by U2's marketing team ). <br /> <br />By far Pop is the least appreciated and understood of the U2 catalogue. That's just makes the album something even more brilliant, because it feels just like something prohibited that it urges to you to listen to it. Pop is extremely  <br />addictive, hallucinating, delirious, magical, exciting and moving. <br /> <br />Standout album. The Best collection of songs on any U2 album
158799190X|1.0|I had been looking forward to reading this book for some time but I was too busy in my job as a securities analyst. The title was enticing because it seemed to hint at some of the same conclusions about stock markets that I had come to in my 20 years of analysing stocks. <br /> <br />I was very disappointed with the book. I couldn't bring myself to finish it. Much of the text is full of long-winded padding. The smugness and the name-dropping and the sneering at those less brainy than the undoubtedly smart Mr. Taleb himself were intensely irritating. Frankly, a huge opportunity was lost here. The title promised much more than what was delivered. Mr. Taleb's rambling self-absorption in his own cleverness and the stream of consciousness style that pervades much of the book is offputting and slightly nauseating.
1558808000|4.0|I have concluded that I have probably used \\"The Secret of My Succe$s\\" as an example in class more than just about any other film ever made. Part of the reason is that most students have seen this film, so I am likely to get nods of recognition more than if I mention \\"Battleship Potemkin\\" or \\"Citizen Kane.\\" This 1987 comedy tells the story of Brantley Foster (Michael J. Fox), who heads from his family's farm in Kansas to the Big Apple to put his business degree to use, but all he can get is a job in the mail room of a firm owned by a distant uncle (Richard Jordan).<br /><br />Brantley comes up with a short cut but there comes a moment when he has to step up to the plate and impress a group of potential investors with a brilliant idea. We see Brantley explain but his idea to an enthralled group of rich businessmen, but...WE HEAR NOTHING. The script by Jim Cash & Jack Epps, Jr. and AJ Carothers (\\"&\\" does not mean the same thing as \\"and\\" in Hollywood) could not come up with anything good enough to carry the scene so they just turned up the music and figured if we had enjoyed the movie to that point and if we liked Michael J. Fox then we would just buy this and proceed to the happy ending.  We do like Fox and we proceed to the happy ending.<br /><br />However, contrast this scene with its counterpart in another familiar film, \\"The Karate Kid.\\"  That would be the great scene where Mr. Miyagi explains to Daniel-san that \\"sand the floor\\" means a whole lot than he ever imagined. That is the sort of scene that makes an entire movie (and gets an actor an Oscar nomination), and \\"The Secret of My Success\\" has a big hole where that scene should be and it really bugs me that the writers could not come up with something that proved our hero deserved to be the hero.<br /><br />There are more holes in this film, which allow Brantley to create the persona of Carlton Whitfield, a young executive in a previous empty office (being in the mailroom has its advantages in such a scheme) and provide a fairy godmother in the person of his Aunt Vera (Margaret Whitton). Meanwhile, Brantley (or Whitfield, depending on your perspective), is interested in Christy Wills (Helen Slater), who is introduced in the most erotic display of drinking from a water fountain in the history of American cinema.<br /><br />This is Michael J. Fox's movie and his engaging performance forgives most of the film's faults in this mindless comedy (mindless in that you will like the film if you mind the holes in it less). Actually, I was amazed to really see how many stupid things happen in \\"The Secret of My Succe$s,\\" but I still like Fox's performance. If nothing else, this film is a reminder that Fox was a gifted physical comedien. The world of business does not come out looking well, but then it is hard to find too many movies in the past twenty years that make you think kindly towards big business.e) and provide a fairy godmother in the person of his Aunt Vera (Margaret Whitton).

B000051S3H|3.0|Watching this DVD is heartbreaking because all you can do is wish for what might have been.  Scott is an amazing Rochester -- not a feely or spiritual type, but a solid, gruff, passionate, masculine Rochester.  York does an excellent job as Jane, giving the character a refreshing intelligence, frankness, and independence -- she makes Jane's refusal to stay with Rochester understandable and believable -- something that few other actresses have been able to do.  The problem is that the quality of the DVD is so bad that you are actually distracted by the technical problems.  Since I didn't see this when it came out on television, I can't tell if the editing problem is a problem with the movie or the DVD.  There are scenes that appear to have been intended, but are missing, and at least one scene that just starts in the middle of one of Scott's lines.  The film quality isn't great either. Incredibly frustrating because if not for the technical problems, this would have been an excellent version of Jane Eyre.  Still, Scott and York's performances  make this worth seeing -- even in this state.

The guitar players are so much more skilled than Kirk Hammet! <br /> <br />&lt;/sarcasm> <br />This is basically mainstram crap that makes me look like a great guitar player and I just started 4 years ago! I've probably been playing 3 years and 11 months longer than the guys in this band, and it really shows. <br />This isn't rock, it has RAP lyrics which ruins it. This is not rap/hiphop, it has really pathetic guitar playing accompanying the rapper, this is not metal or nu-metal, it's way too wimpy to be even Nu-Metal, and this isn't punk, it's too poser. <br />Listen to real rock (blur) real rap (eminem) real metal (Metallica) real \\"Nu-Metal\\" (KoRn), or Death Metal (Dimmu Borgir) or real punk (NOFX). this is totally pathetic, I can't even describe it. <br /> <br />You posers know I'm right...

B00005B36H|4.0|I've had this album almost 3 years now and I continue to enjoy it.  There are alot of heavy songs and alot of soft songs, which I think are perfectly balanced out.  Even though \\"Disposition\\" only contains 2 lines of lyrics (repeated over and over), its one of my favorites off here.  The guitar line in \\"Lateralis\\" is phenomonel, the song starts out with it and then the band comes in... wow!  Alot of people might not think this as their best album, but I think it's pretty damn good.  The band has yet to disapoint me and hopefully their new album will be just as good!
0792844890|5.0|I remember back in 1987, when MGM had released Spaceballs; I saw it 5 times in theaters. Then in 2001, I bought the Spaceballs dvd, i loved the audio commentary; and the behind-the-scenes i never knew it existed. But come may 3rd, 2005 they are going to release a Spaceballs Collector's Edition 2-Disc DVD set. I cannot wait. Once amazon.com has it on their site, i'm gonna pre-order it and tell my friends about it. The new 2-Disc DVD set is gonna have DTS 5.1, Commentary by Brooks, art gallery, costume gallery, behind-the-movie photos, and a stack more. I highly recommend any spaceball, sci-fi, or comedy fan to pre-order it on the day it's available on amazon.com
B00028HBKM|5.0|I have no idea whether the filmmaker is a prejudiced zealot, as opinions to that effect abound. But in the actual movie (a film about the voluntary sacrifice of Christ) I found nothing of that sort. Beyond all lesser contexts of tribe, kin or creed, the story contained in PASSION is the far more universal Eternal Drama, that of MAN destroying the best thing that is his, namely the possibility of opening his eyes and seeing change, seeing a way in life to be less violent. We crucify the Truth now today as we always have; with metaphorical stones we continually \\"kill\\" and suppress people and ideas. <br /> <br />Why, in the Drama of Christ did Judas even need to 'betray' Jesus before they crucified him? The authorities could have found Jesus without much trouble, so Judas' action makes no sense except for its symbolic meaning. That meaning is: Christ (through Judas) handed himself over to the baser men who could not see what he was, and (if you review the last supper) Jesus essentially commanded Judas to help him. That is missing in Gibson's presentation, although the spiritual suffering Judas must have willingly undertook to play his role is itself portrayed as a horror for any man to endure. But for what purpose, what result? The crucifixion was necessary, fully intended... and at the moment Christ says \\"it is done\\" before slouching down on the cross, we realize something has been done TO the men who brought him there, ie. some deep frightening realization of themselves has been touched. This moment is for all of us, and the effect of the event has not gone away. <br /> <br />A very thoughtful film overall. We are made to experience the viscerality of Christ's especially fervent subjection to suffering (and why such fervor?) not just through gory makeup and effects, but equally through the depths of psychic pain we see in the faces of Mary his mother, and his devoted Magdelen. I was never so utterly moved contemplating the event of Christ's death. And never so surprised and elated by the event to follow! <br /> <br />Just see it. It is hard to talk about this film apart from it's meaning in Christ's teaching and life, things themselves very layered in meaning. The film (and our reactions to it) evokes in me many thoughts, like this one: <br /> <br />Can zealotry and critical thinking exist in the same mind? And which thinking did Christ call us to use in the world?
B000002J0B|5.0|Houses of the Holy was the first Led Zeppelin album I ever listened to, and it's always been my favorite. There's just something magical about the songs on this album. <br /> <br />I can't choose which song on the album is my absolute favorite because they are all very good. When I first heard the album, though, I was extremely attracted to \\"Over The Hills And Far Away.\\" It's such a beautiful song...as are the other ones. <br /> <br />The only song that I don't particularly like is \\"The Crunge\\", but I admire it's originality. How many rock bands could pull off a song like that?  <br /> <br />The first three songs, \\"The Song Remains The Same\\", \\"Rain Song\\", and \\"Over The Hills And Far Away\\" might just be the most elegant songs ever, and to listen to them sequentially is amazing.  <br /> <br />In fact, the whole album is amazing, and I'll always remember the first time I put this album in my CD player and fell in love with Led Zeppelin and their music.   <br /> <br />
B000002JPA|5.0|This was Dream Theater's breakthrough album and it was only their second! Images and Words also meant the debut for singer Kevin James LaBrie. In IAW, you will find three unbelievable masterpieces. The first one is Learning to Live, that in my opinion, is way up there competing against A Change of Seasons for the title of DT's best song ever. Metropolis Part 1 is a classic. John Petrucci wrote this 9'32'' minutes epic as a fantasy being inspired by Rush and Yes ([...]) unaware that years later there would be a sequel called Scenes From A Memory which is ....perfect.   The third great song is Pull Me Under, a big-time MTV hit. However, that video was only 4 minutes and half long, while the original song is over 8 minutes long. That video made Dream Theater famous around the world. It opened various strategic markets like Japan and Europe. This is probably the only positive contribution of MTV to humanity.   The rest of the songs are very good also. I enjoy Another Day even though most metal lovers will despise it because it's just light rock accompanied with a melodical soprano sax.   With Images and Words, Dream Theater left that 80's sound and began their odyssey in search for their long-achieved innovative sound. This album would easily rank in the top five of the best music of the 90's. Furthermore, Images and Words is considered by the majority as Dream Theater's best; though I dare not drop into those conclusions thanks to Scenes from a Memory (1999).   If you are new to Dream Theater, begin with this album and experience what true musicianship is about. If you are a die hard Dream Theater fan, you already own this album and were just reading the review to see what other people think.
0385510454|1.0|Mr. Grisham has reached the point in his career where he seems completely happy to churn out drivel to meet his contracts with his publishers.

B00009TB5G|5.0|The Two Towers Extended Edition is, by far, the best film of any of the Lord of the Rings endeavors. I know that's not the widely held opinion so I realize I'll have to give my reasons: <br />1. The action is constantly moving among the three story lines (Legolas/Aragorn/Gimle; Merry and Pippin; Sam and Frodo) so there's never a chance to look at your watch or get the least bit bored. <br />2. This movie introduces all kinds of new characters. The best of these is Treebeard, brought to life through the voice of John Rhys-Davies. But the people of Rohan are fabulous...Eowyn, Eomer, Theoden...what a great family. And of course we meet Faramir and, in this EE, Denathor. And this film introduces the amazing CG creation, Gollum.  <br />3. One of the best scenes of the three movies: Boromir reclaiming Osgiliath for Gondor. How COULD they have left this scene out of the theaterical release?  <br />4. The best \\"goose-bump\\" moment in the trilogy--Eomer and Gandalf leading the charge into Helm's Deep. The second best \\"goose-bump\\" moment in the trilogy...the elves marching into Helm's Deep under the leadership of the mighty cape sweeping Haldir.  <br />5. The best battles in the trilogy...the Warg battle and the ultimate...\\"The Battle of Helm's Deep.\\" Let me explain why I prefer this battle to Pelannor Fields....I feel a greater personal connectedness to those who are fighting at Helm's Deep. We've spent time in the city, seen the faces of the people of Edoras, seen their hardships. By contrast, we hardly catch a glimpse of the people of Minis Tirith before their city is under seige. Don't get me wrong...I love both films. I just love this one a little more!  <br /> <br />So I make no apologies for the fact that The Two Towers EE remains my favorite movie of all time and probably will have that spot in my heart for some years to come.
B000092ZYX|4.0|Radiohead has changed over the years. In fact, they have been so afraid of staying the same that they reivent themselves every album. Hail to the Thief, however, finds Radiohead not entirely changed- different, yes, but with a semi-familiar sound that's more than just Thom Yorke's voice, incorporating not only rock and prog-rock, but techno (clicks and bleeps), actual drums, and occasionally, a piano. <br />And for those of you who have listened to Kid A for hours, trying to find the hidden meaning, yes, I said it- his Voice. <br />On this album, Radiohead has concentrated less on being different and more on simply playing music. And they do it masterfully, as always. Thom is unfettered by gurgling experimental noise, and lets his emotions shine through on every track. And the music- oh, the music! This album is all about unfairness, anxiety, and just wanting to hole up in your house and die. <br />2+2=5, the opening track, is a classic reference to Orwell's 1984, and the basic gist is that the world is messed up.  <br />Sit down. Stand up. is a strange track, beautiful at first, but suffers from repetition. <br />Sail to the Moon is a beautiful track employing many guitars, piano, and a smattering of drums that somehow leaves you shivering in the cold. <br />The two singles, Go to Sleep and There, There, are probably the most accessible titles on the album. While There, There is a long, steadily building ominous song, Go To Sleep is a shorter, rawer song about letting \\"it all wash over\\" you. <br />A few unmemorable tracks are on here as well. Where I end and You Begin, The Gloaming, and I Will, despite their innaccesibility, help the cd feel like a whole, proving that Radiohead has finally mastered the art of the album. We Suck Young Blood, however, is possibly sonically too wierd for its own good, and Myxomatosis fails to build on its stale fuzzed-out bass intro. <br />Litle gems like the haunting and depressing Scatterbrain and the failure of control in A Punchupat a Wedding abound. An eerie piano combines with something that sounds like industrial fan blades on Backdrifts to give the strange feeling of non-existence. And A Wolf at the Door is the most emotionally charged piece, expressing anxiety, disillusionment and depression simultaneously with lines like \\"help me call the doctor put me inside, put me inside,\\" and  \\"someone else is gonna come and clean it up, born and raised for the job, someone always does.\\"  <br />This is not a good starting point for someone interested in Radiohead. If \\"Creep\\" is the only thing you've heard, then I'd suggest The Bends as a great starting point (Pablo Honey isn't all that great as an album). This is also not an instant classic like Ok Computer. But it's also not as pretentious as Kid A or as uncomfortable as Amnesiac. Something big is coming. You can feel it. You're not sure what it is. And it lurks just on the edge of every song on this album. It'll make you want to scream, \\"I want my mindless rock!\\" by the end, but you'll find yourself listening to it again and again, while bands like Stone Sour, Linkin Park, and Muse fade into obscurity on your dusty CD racks.

B0000AGQ26|4.0|The late 1970s were a great time for movies. JAWS, STAR WARS, and a slew of other movies changed not only the way movies were made, but how movies were viewed as well. Though there are some whom cannot seem to admit it, ANIMAL HOUSE falls in that same category. Not only did the film father (REVENGE OF THE NERDS, PORKYS, and a host of others originate from ANIMAL HOUSE) a whole new type of movie (raunchy, but humorous college film), but because of the movie's success, &#34;different&#34; types of movies were made that never would have gotten past the script stage. The film was original titled NATIONAL LAMPOON'S ANIMAL HOUSE and was the first of many movies to bear the National Lampoon name in its title.<br /><br />ANIMAL HOUSE revolves around the hijinks of a fraternity at Fraber College somewhere in Pennsylvania. The fraternity, Delta House (whose official name changes subtly in the movie from Delta Chi Tau to Delta Tau Chi), is put on probation and Dean Wormer wants to shut the place down. Delta House is a frat that accepts everyone that the other frats won't accept. Therefore, the movie ends up becoming a crazy story about a bunch of mismatched underdogs who band together to, well, just keep their fraternity.<br /><br />Directed by John Landis and written by Harold Ramis and Douglas Kenney, the movie was loosely based on their own personal college experiences. The movie has an ensemble cast, but it is John Belushi as Bluto who steals the show. His role in movie is the one that fixed his place as a Hollywood star. The movie started the career of several other actors (e.g. Tim Matheson) and revived the careers of other (Donald Sutherland). It also features Kevin Bacon in his first movie appearance.<br /><br />ANIMAL HOUSE is the college movie. Despite the low laughs, nudity, and sophomoric pranks, every college movie made since ANIMAL HOUSE lives in its shadow. Though there times the movie becomes somewhat tasteless, it tempers those moments with wit and quick dialogue. Personally, there are several scenes in the movie that I could have done without and which really didn't add anything to the plot. However, I can appreciate the film for what it is and take something away, despite my misgivings. Now, may I have ten thousand marbles, please?gue.

B0000AUHOH|2.0|There are so many bad movies out there, it's difficult to get too upset about Star Trek V.  In fact, compared to the sludge that Hollywood mostly produces, this is an above average film.  The plot while a bit silly, is moderately coherent.  It does attempt to engage the viewer intellectually, albeit in a clumsy manner.  In some ways, therefore, it's exceptional. <br /> <br />The only problem is that it isn't exceptional compared to other Star Trek films; it is definitely the worst of the lot.  Some things, such as Sybok allowing his emotions to govern him, are unforgiveable; the Vulcans learned emotional control in order to prevent violence from breaking out amongst them.  Sybok's emotionality seems to suggest the Vulcans controlled their emotions to prevent hammy acting.  Which is reasonable, but less compelling than the original explanation.   <br /> <br />Overall, this is a \\"Rainy Saturday Afternoon With Nothing Better to Do\\" kind of film, a bridge between IV and VI that only occasionally seems worth watching.  If you have a completion fetish or just want to ensure you don't miss ANY good Star Trek moments (and there are a few in this film), get it.  If not, skip it.
B000002J27|5.0|Love this Art Rock album-great road navigator music! Genesis overall best single album, and for good personal reasons! Back in July 1976, when America patriotically celebrated its 200 anniversary, I was a 17 year old teenager, with a part-time, door-to-door job, making gobs of easy, no-questions-asked money from penniless, mostly white newcomers coming in from all over America, experiencing sudden-found wealth. [The then-explosive growing, promising, positively-viewed Houston, TX economy seemed to work wonders for all arrivals!] My boss played the album incessantly for hours(8 track format) in his van while stuck in horrendous traffic jams-a van filled with youth salespersons, transported from one city sector to another. The quick, shifting drums blasting, the meloncholy mood, the psychological feeling of overcoming obstacles while staying a faithful musical course that reverted to positive toons at each songs end. Looking back almost 30 years, this was a heady, once in a lifetime experience, and the \\"Trick of the Tail\\" contributed mightily to this positive time in my life.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm very sorry I missed seeing this on TV.  I never saw any commercials for it.  Anyhow, it holds a special place in my DVD collection.  It's one of the best bargains I've ever seen too. <br /> <br />If you're curious, I'm not a trekie or a StarWars freak.  I watch very few shows on TV anymore.  This show, however, has fun (and interesting) characters, great dialogue and a neat plot for each episode.  It is probably the most realistic portrayal of what the galaxy might be like in 500 years or so which matters to me since fantasy is sometimes hard for me to watch when it's so dumb.  I could go on but I'd rather you check it out. <br /> <br />I've shown it to my wife who only likes sappy things like American Dreams and Party of 5 and she loves it.  Everyone I've played it to is now addicted.  Can't wait to see the movie!!!!!!!!
038572179X|5.0|Ian McEwan's \\"Atonement\\" works so well as a multi-perspective study in early 20th century English manners that you want it to remain there for the length of the novel. The narrative is as liquid as the fateful pond ambivalent Cecilia plunges into to spite future lover Robbie Turner, and just as refreshing. Psychological acuity, assured pacing, dry-as-toast wit; these are the building blocks McEwan uses to construct the first-half of \\"Atonement\\", and he reminds us of their importance and their potential to galvanize and provoke the reader. <br />Yet, like thirteen-year-old Briony, the novel cannot remain one thing forever. \\"Atonement\\" captures the no-man's-land between childhood and adolescence with intimate detail, something few writers are capable of. As she metamorphasises, so does the narrative. I was a bit dubious when McEwan jumped from the townhouse to the battleground. The transition felt a little too Masterpiece Theatre-ish at first. Shame on me. I should have known I was in masterful hands, as McEwan guides the reader through the private hell of a wronged, damaged man seeking salvation through far-off love.  <br />Naturally, the final focus comes back to Briony, first as a eighteen-year-old nurse attempting to bury her guilt under grinding repetition, and finally in a completely different incarnation than expected. I won't reveal the devastating intellectual and emotional surprises that comprise the finale of this masterwork. I will say, however, that it secures McEwan's reputation as one of our great writers. <br />\\"Atonement\\" is about alot of things: the insanity of war, the confusion of childhood, the joy of first love, the ennui of middle age, the darkness of the human heart. However, it's mostly about the stories we tell ourselves and each other, and the way art is used to find forgiveness and peace. Few of us find the atonement we're looking for, McEwan sighs. Why would we need stories if we did?
B0001XALTG|4.0|One of Ewen MacGregors first big films, I find this one of the most realistic, gritty and at times, digusting films to come out in a long time. <br />Not for the faint hearted, there are some gross scenes in the movie- the public toilet scene for one. <br />A very dark movie, with the most accurate potrayal of junkies perhaps ever seen in a major movie, this movie is also sad, funny, and full of hope in some places, and the depths of woe in others. <br />You find yourself sympathasising with the main character, hoping he can overcome his addiction and move on to a better life. <br />Very hard genre to describe, except to say definitely black humour, with some drama, tension and action thrown in for good measure <br />Well worth a look!! <br />
0312995423|4.0|This is an excellently compiled and highly detailed insight into the world of cryptology.Fast paced and intelligent.It is plainly obvious to the reader the astounding amount of planning and research that must have gone into this book.....and yet people say they dislike it!  <br />   I have concluded that these people obviously do not understand the ideas, theories , or the techno'-world type background within the story. This book appeals to a certain type of person ....definately a person who understands todays technology. <br />   Just because Dan Brown wrote 'The Da Vinci Code' , and you enjoyed that does not mean that you will enjoy , or understand for that matter, the complexities within this book.  <br />   This is a highly engaging book which if you buy on the basis of its summary on the reverse of the book YOU WILL ENJOY....THANK YOU AND GOOD NIGHT!
0590353403|5.0|Well, here's where the phenomenom all started. <br />It's hard to compare Rowling with any other author ( CS Lewis...? ) suffice to say these books are highly enjoyable for child and adult alike <br />( Really Amazon- age group 9-12- c'mon, are you deaf and blind???) <br />I read my first Harry Potter book only in 2004- (I am aged 33 ), after seeing the first two movies, I can say I ignored the phenomenom for a few years, but the first movie was just so enjoyable and well done, that in a few short weeks I had thirstily read all the first 6 books. <br />Comparing all the books, this is one of the best, and although much shorter than the last few, perfectly introduces the reader to the world of Harry Potter and Hogwarts. <br />Don't worry if you have already seen the movie- the two are very similar, and you'll get all the extra little bits, like characters thoughts and a few scenes that weren't included in the movie as a bonus. <br />A truly really great book, and for all ages. <br />Do yourself a favour!!! <br />
B0006ZE7G2|1.0|Don't get me wrong, I love Pink Floyd (and The Wall too) but this constant rehashing of DSOTM and The Wall into \\"Anniversary, Special Editions...ad nauseum\\" is just plain ripping off the fans.<br /><br />How about the long awaited DVD release of Pulse or Delicate Sound of Thunder instead?
B0002858YS|5.0|I bought this album originally because I liked the songs Somebody Told Me and Mr. Brightside. I didn't think I was going to like this album to much. I grown to like Jenny Was A Friend of mine and Smile Like You Mean It.        So far The Killers got out 3 songs. Most artists are lucky to get 1 or 2 songs out from their first album. Look at Switchfoot, their first three albums were not to great. Who knew The Killers would get this good. They peaked their album in 14th on the billboards.       I was in a chat room, it was about 3 weeks after Somebody Told Me came onto the radio. The people in it were saying that The Killers were just going to be a one hit wonder. I argued about that and thought they would do better. I thought the same for Franz Ferdinand, because some people were saying they were another one hit wonder.       If you like mainstream rock this is the album for you. I hope you like this album.
B0002Z0EYA|2.0|Another one gone, and another one gone....<br /><br />I don't understand Hollywood. They want their movies to sell, right? I love the idea of taking old stories and making movies out of them. All those lovely stories that have been around thousands (or hundreds) of years....<br /><br />But there's a reason they've been around so long - people LIKE them. So why does Hollywood feel it has to add so many twists to the story? Why does it have to change it so much? Take King Arthur, for instance, or Robin Hood. And Troy. It's true they are just myths, but there IS actually a limitation to the different possibilities for the original version.<br /><br />They ruined this story! Ok, ok, so maybe you don't care about the story, or all willing to enjoy a changed version. Well, I was prepared to enjoy it, even if it was changed.<br /><br />But, even NOT looking at the legend... it was no good. I mean, I think that the actors did a good job, but it was BORING. The fight between Achilles and Hector was pretty good, but that's about it. There were basically two types of characters: Whiney and annoying, and cruel. Not wonderfully cruel - but cruel like a child's character (like Char's uncle in the movie 'Ella Enchanted'). And then there was Achilles, who seemed to fall in love with a girl but really showed no emotion throughout, and Hector, who was the hero of the movie (in my opinion), and was the only good character.<br /><br />They should have taken out a few bad scenes, and made this movie PG.<br /><br />Now, looking at how they changed it from the legend... well... they portrayed the Trojans as the 'good guys', and made the Greeks the 'bad guys'. Menalus, instead of loving his wife (Helen) and wanting to get her back, just wants to kill her. Paris, instead of being a cruel whiney coward, is just a pathetic sort of person you either feel sorry for or want to strangle.<br /><br />And the gods. WHERE are the Gods?! It is my solemn duty to inform you that there aren't any in this movie. According to the legends, it was all the gods fault that Paris stole Helen (and half of Sparta's treasure) in the first place. The gods intervened - like Apollo, who guided Paris's arrow to Achilles ankle.<br /><br />Oh, by the way, in this movie, Achilles is a totally normal guy. Apart from showing no emotion, being some sort of great fighter, and having a water nymph for a mother, that is. What about the Achilles Tendon? That's who it was named for. Achilles supposedly was dipped, held by his ankle, into this stuff that made him immortal. His ankle was the only vulnerable spot. In the movie, they erased that fact, and Achilles simply died with arrows in his chest. Yahoo.<br /><br />Ok, I'm drawing out this review, but I'm trying to be helpful (and express my disappointment, too). If you are a Brad Pitt fan, or Orlando Bloom fan, etc., then you might like this movie. After all, Pitt seems to be the central character, and Bloom wins in the end.<br /><br />If you like fighting movies, this isn't a good choice, because there doesn't seem to be a lot of fighting. Hmm - I don't see how they manage 2 1/2 hours, considering there isn't any story either.<br /><br />Sorry - what I mean, is, it goes like this (If you don't want to know what happens, don't read this): Paris and Helen are in love. Paris takes Helen away. They get to Troy. Then the Greeks get to Troy. Then they fight for 3 days. The Trojan horse makes its appearance, the Greeks win, though Agamemnon and Achilles die, some Trojans flee, the end. That's all.<br /><br />There's the great story! Yay!<br /><br />They were trying to make something great, but they didn't realize that the story of Troy IS great - and trying to make a great story better isn't going to work (85% of the time, at least).<br /><br />Sure, borrow this movie from the library, spend a few dollars to rent it, you might like it - after all, lots of people apparently did.

B00008H2LB|5.0|You may heard the song In The End, which a few years ago helped make Linkin Park become one of the most well known rock bands. Then Numb and Breaking The Habit helped push the band higher than most bands reach. Other songs of course were good, like Somewhere I Belong, Lying From You, Faint, and even Easier To Run. On their past album One Step Closer and Crawling helped. <br /> <br />   Linkin Park uses a mix of rap and rock. About twenty years from know these guys will be entered into the rock hall of fame, with Blink-182 and Green Day at their side of glory. <br /> <br />   I suggest that if you haven't gotten this album yet, you should look for it as soon as possible.
B00005JMJG|5.0|Jim Carrey (Lemony Snickets, Bruce Almighty, Truman Show) plays Joel Barish who finds out this his girlfriend Clementine, played by Kate Winslet (Finding Neverland, Titanic, Jude), erased her memories of him and her. Soon after, he realizes he should do it and he signs himself up. After awhile he realizes he doesnt want to lose her so he tries, in his mind to hide her so she cant be erased. A bizarre and mind warping experience that is fun and emotional and everything else. Carrey gives probably so far the best performance of his career and Winslet is beautiful and simply a marvel...the other cast are amazing as well...Mark Ruffalo (Collateral, My Life Without Me, In The Cut) and Elijah Wood (The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, Ash Wednesday) play the mind eraser guys...Kirsten Dunst (Spider-man 1 and 2, Interview With The Vampire) plays the secretary to the doctor that was the creator of the erasing minds project, played by Tom Wilkinson (Rush Hour, The Patriot, In The Bedroom). It pulls you in from the beginning and then it brings you for a wild and unforgettable ride. Charlie Kaufman proves he is a genius when it comes to writing original and clever stories...he proved it with both Being John Malkovich and Adaptation and now he's done it again here. Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind is a masterwork and will remain one in my mind. Also starring David Cross (Men In Black 1 and 2, Run Ronnie Run) and Jane Adams (Anniversary Party, Lemony Snickets). \\"Two Thumbs Way Way Up\\" for me
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day gone away for a little while and came back with this awsome album. I thought that Green Day dissapeared, but they came back. American idiot is for people who love punk rock and other similar genres will love this album.       Boulevard Of Broken Dreams is played on the radio more than usual songs, but for some reason people aren't getting sick of it. Holiday and Jesus Of Suberbia are starting to get played on the radio a little bit.       It took me a while to find this album, because it was sold out everywhere I looked. Finally I found it, so good luck for all of you that are looking to buy this album.       If you don't like this album, you are truly not into punk and hard rock. I always liked Green Day, they were the first rock/punk band I liked, I liked them since 1996. I was five then, and yes, I have loved music forever, but Green Day was one of my first influences to listen to rock music.    Best Songs  1. Boulevard Of Broken Dreams  2. American Idiot  3. Jesus Of Suberbia  4. Holiday  5. St. Jimmy
B0007CNXUK|5.0|Johnny Depp (Ed Wood, Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas) plays Peter Pan author Sir James Matthew Barrie who puts on plays but never sits threw them. He soon starts to write a familiar story inspired by a a family, a wife, Sylvia Davies, Kate Winslet (Jude, Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind) and her boys. He soon becomes a part of their life making them work their minds of imagination. He has a wife, Radha Mitchell (Pitch Black, High Art), who cant take the pressure of him not being home because he is out visiting Winslet and her boys or he is out walking and written his story. He soon creates this phenomenon, Peter Pan and it is considered his greatest achievement. Also starring Dustin Hoffman (American Buffalo, Runaway Jury), Kelly MacDonald (Entropy, Trainspotting), Julie Christie and Ian Hart (Enemy Of The State, Monument Ave). Depp proves again he is a master at what he does and he should win lots of awards after this. He even channels some of Jack Sparrow in the pirate ship scene and he has a cool irish accent. One of the best movies of the year...wonderful and we know, there's a lot of movies being thrown at us about Peter Pan but I was impressed by this movie, but this is only about him and him writing it, its not actually Peter Pan. Depp fans wont be disappointed because I surely wasnt.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|Jet has a style of music which you would hear if you lived in the 1960's. About a year ago when Are You Gonna Be My Girl came out I knew that this band was just warming up. Later came (in order) Cold Hard B****, then Rollover D.J., next out came Look What You've done, and around Europe and Australia Get Me Outta Here is starting to pop up. I am sure it will come here to U.S.A. <br /> <br />   Most of Jet's music is slow rock. In honesty, I never liked slow rock, beside Green Day's Good Riddence (Time Of Your Life). Jet's song Are You Gonna Be My Girl is not slow, but it made the album famous. <br /> <br />   Try to find this album if you like 60's Rock and Roll, or even Modern, Alternative, and Mainstream Rock. This album is not to hard to find. Around my house it is always in stock on stores.

B00001OH7P|5.0|\\"Ziggy Stardust\\" is a stunning, mind-blowing album that throws one incredible song after another at the listener.  The lyrics are bizarre, the story is weird, the characters are strange, and the music is fantastic.  This album is the single best justification for glam-rock, which is usually light-years behind this masterful release.  How did Bowie do it?  Well, his voice is outstanding, the song-writing is top notch, the musicianship is great, and the production is meticulous.  The remastering was also done quite well.  Every song here is great, but my favorite would have to be \\"Suffragette City\\", which rocks like nothin' else.  \\"Ziggy\\" is one of rock 'n' roll's finest moments.
B00065U08Q|5.0|This I feel is one of John's best works so far, next to Inside of Emptiness. My favorite song off of this album is song six, Surrogate People. It has an amazing acoustic guitar in the background with dual vocals by both John and Josh. I think this album shows the more creative side of the artist through experimental electronic synthesizing. Though I think it would be best to start at the beginning and work toward the newer releases.
B000084T18|1.0|Take one inarticulate, mumbling, nearly unintelligible, mentally dim criminal sociopath who personifies every vice that has turned inner city black neighborhoods into the equivalent of third world countries; add some pro music software tools and loops that do not require any musical knowledge; unleash it on the \\"community\\" without any regard for morals but only greed (hey, get the title), and you have this album. The companies that produce this sewage are evil parasites that have caused more damage to the black community than hundreds of years of slavery ever did. Hey, 50 cent, you talk as if you are too stupid and too immoral to handle money or success. I hope it becomes your undoing. You and your handlers make Mike Tyson look like a nobel laureate.
B0000070QN|5.0|I was lucky enough to have access to some Canadian radio and TV when these guys released their first CD in 1991. That was a great album all by itself...lots of harmonies, amazing guitar work and hooks galore. It just jumped right out at me...then Mood Swings came out two years later and I ordered it sight unseen, music unheard...and I was just blown away by every single song on the album. This is one of those amazing collections of music that does no wrong from the beginning of the first song to the tail end of the last one. It's nothing less than criminal that these guys haven't had a single thing released in the US, but kudos to Canada and Japan (especially Japan, they're huge there) for putting their music out there. I've bought everything since the first album (even their albums under the Rubber name...they're a bit different but the work is still supreme quality stuff). Mood Swings is that album that shows just how good hard melodic rock can be, and should be in the collection of every young band wanting to venture out intio the melodic hard rock field...THIS is how it's done right! It would be pointless for me to single out any one song on this album. Listening is the key. Some of the other albums can be a bit pricey (some are Japan-only issues) but I can say without reservations that it's ALL worth the price of admission. Nobody, and I mean NOBODY does it better than these guys.
B00000K31V|1.0|I have to say that I am astonished to see that the general reviews of this film are positive!  <br />This is without a doubt high up in the \\"nosebleed section\\" of my \\"I can't believe that someone paid to make this flic let alone pay to see it\\" list ! <br />It was confusing, disjointed,confusing in the extreme and just plain bad filmmaking. <br />The action is all over the map, the characters are not the least sympathetic enough to be interesting to the viewer and the storyline was likely fleshed out at a evening  serving too many halucinatory party favors! <br />Don't even rent this one ... borrow it from someone who believed the other reviews and bought it ! <br /> <br />
B00007E8O5|5.0|First of all, I'd like to say that almost all the previous reviewers said just about everything there is to say about this album.  Despite the tragedy of Layne Staley's death, and perhaps on account of his death, Jerry Cantrell continues to rock harder than ever before.  This album is not only metal at its best, but it's also extremely introspective and thought provoking.  Jerry Cantrell has thrown his soul out for all the world to see and that is why this album rings so true.  You cannot fake this kind of emotion and you cannot buy the kind of experience that Jerry has had.  Listen to any other hard rock album that came out in the past 5 years and then hit yourself in the head because you are a moron.  This double album is complete in every way.  It has tender, soft moments as well as grab-you-by-the-sack-and-twist moments.  While some parts seem, at first, borken and uneven, every note is intended and rightly placed.  The punch-you-in-the-face rhythm of \\"Bargain Basement Howard Hughes\\" is ridiculously heavy.  The guitar riff is so huge that you cannot help but raise your fists and bang your head.  The whole first disc is so amazing that you don't ever want to take it out.  But the second disc is loaded with even more great songs.  They just keep coming. <br /> <br />An earlier reviewer mentioned Nickleback. I have a quick, funny story to tell about them.  I live in Seattle, of course, and I go see Jerry whenever he plays.  Well a couple of years ago he was on tour with Nickleback and my friends and I went to go see him at Key Arena.  He rocked so hard it was unbelievable.  After his set was done, the lights came on and there were a bunch of hot chicks standing behind us.  They wanted to know what we were doing after the show and I said, \\"the show is over.  We're leaving now.  Nickleback sucks!!\\"  Needless to say, we got a bunch of bad looks from the posers in the audience, but we did manage to get a couple people to take a stand and leave with us.  It was awesome.Too bad Jerry couldn't see our complete and utter devotion.  Rock on!  Buy this album, you won't regret it!
B000002B5L|5.0|the fugees are brilliant... they came out of nowhere with 'fu-ge-la' and dominated the world... they brought the reggae feel to hip-hop (one of the first to do that) and hit it out of the park.... <br /> <br />the only problem is that they have too many remakes... 'killing me softly' by roberta flack and 'no woman, no cry' by bob marley'... they did a great job on both but normally if a artist does a remake it would only be one on the album... <br /> <br />'ready or not' IS one of my favourite songs in hip-hop history... they wrecked this song.... too bad that mario winans dude did a bad job on his remake..... pras was flawless on this song... lauren hill sounded like a angel, and wyclef keeps it crunk as usual... <br /> <br />this album is hot to def and you need to buy it soon nobody should have this LP if you are a true hip hop fan...
B0006HXXBA|5.0|Like many of you, I've been a Kreator fan since the 80's. It's hard to think of another band who has turned out consistently good material after 20 years in the business. Kreator is truly one of the great metal bands of our time. I believe they've never done a \\"bad\\" album, although of course I like some more than others. After 'Violent Revolution' I expected 'Enemy of God' to be good, but I still remain in awe at just how good it really is. There is not a bad song to be found. After about 20 listens straight thru, I still can't get the lyrics out of my head or bring myself to listen to anything else. This is definitely one of, if not THE the best metals CD's I've bought in years. Anyway, I could go on endlessly about this one so I will stop it here. The CD is awesome, and Kreator is better than ever. =)
0316172324|5.0|New Yorker columnist Malcolm Gladwell noticed that when he wore his hair cropped short, the police hardly noticed him, but when he let it grow out into an Afro highlighting his Jamaican side more than his Caucasian half, the police hassled him more than once. So began a fascinating investigation into first impressions - how we make them, how accurate they are and how to make your first judgments more accurate.  <br /> <br />BLINK is entertaining, illuminating and at times humorous. In a highly readable account, Gladwell gives a clear description of implicit cognition and explains the most up-to-date theories of neuroscience and psychology through a series of fun and accessible stories. The examples, drawn from a wide range of situations and fields of human endeavor, illustrate the complex thinking processes that support \\"snap judgments.\\"  With case after case, Gladwell demonstrates how the depth of knowledge and expertise developed over years of observation informs the mind to \\"thin slice\\" - make quick decisions at the blink of the eye that seem instantaneous but are actually based on years of experience. Thought-provoking, entertaining and worth a read. <br /> <br />Charleen Touchette Author of IT STOPS WITH ME: MEMOIR OF A CANUCK GIRL <br /> <br />
B0006IIKS0|4.0|All right, the DVD arrived today and I watched it as soon as I checked the mail. I was sort of expecting it to be better than I thought it would be, but although I won't be listening to their latest album ever again, it did indeed help to give another perspective on it. I'm a huge documentary buff and they did an exceptional job. I wouldn't ever watch it again, but it's a nice piece of modern history. The tracks are so much easier to listen to when they're being performed either in the studio or live. The scene with Dave and Lars with the therapist was a little tough to watch, and how anyone can't empathize with Dave by the additional scene on the second disk is beyond me. It's like, you let James stay the entire time with his own problem and behavior, but I was kicked to the curb in no time. By the way, although people have recommended this for people that aren't even fans, I sure as hell wouldn't. I don't see what the point would be, because they definitely wouldn't become one afterwards. Their '92 documentary was incredibly long but it was so great, especially part II. This one just sort of begs for them to just hang it up.
B00062RCBW|4.0|I purchased the \\"chinese\\" version. If you investigate the cheaper options, you will find these are \\"chinese versions\\"  running about $200, a considerable savings from the english versions. The only difference is the style of packaging, and the writing on the box and the DVD's is in chinese (except the title \\"Star Trek The Next Generation\\", and the numbering on the discs). Also, chinese subtitles can be enabled if you want them. The text, spoken lines, credits, content, and the entire show is perfectly identical to what was broadcast on TV. English subtitles are also an option, or no subtitles at all. The \\"catch\\", however, is that some of the episodes are clipped slightly short. There are four episodes on each disc. The last episode on the disc stops short by about 2 to 4 minutes. Most of the time, this means you just miss the ending credits. However, the first disc of each season runs a little long, and about the last four minutes of the last episode on that particular disc will be lost. Therefore, only seven episodes out of the total are significantly affected, and there is not enough missing to \\"leave you hanging\\". But if you are a serious collector who wants every minute accurately archived and obtainable, you might want to pay the extra $400 or so for the english version. For those of you who won't be upset over a total of 20 minutes, that don't significantly affect the content, missing from 7 episodes (of the approximately 175 total episodes), you can save a fair amount of dollars. The quality is similar to the original broadcast, there are some extra features and interviews, and we thoroughly enjoyed seeing all those great episodes again, in order and without commercials. There are about 50 discs in the chinese version that are in induvidual plastic sleeves, and fit compactly into a nice wooden box that is about 8in. x 10in. x 2 in., and doesn't take a large amount of space. Hope this helps you \\"make it so\\".
B0002Z0EYK|2.0|Those of you who have seen Troy will probably remember the beautiful sunrises over the Aegean. However when you are actually in Troy-since Troy is to the east of the Aegean-the sun never rises but sets over the sea. We know the movie was not shot in Troy, but couldn't they have as least picked a spot where the sunrises would be consistent with the map they have shown at the beginning of the movie?  <br /> <br />It is not only the geographical details which have been overlooked in Petersen's Troy. The dialogue is just awful. We watch Greeks and Trojans speak and act like characters from a soap opera, i.e., Helen-who is wearing a Vogue make-up-turns to Paris and says 'last night was a mistake'. <br /> <br />I so much wish Peter Jackson took up this very challenging project. I am sure he would have done justice to Homer and would make a great job creating the world depicted in the Illiad.

How could one get even halfway through it?<br /><br />I was guffawing every time I picked it up. Clouseau playing Indiana Jones, brilliant!<br /><br />A thought for any Americans who think this is some kind of hyper-historical European Disney tour. Try driving a rental up the Tuileries any time, please!

0596007124|2.0|Don't get me wrong! This is a very interesting book, but it just doesn't work for me. If you are anything like me, you love those good old serious books with less funny pictures. I find reading this book to be a waste of time because the style of the book is distracting.As a manager, I don't have time to spend several hours of my time trying to follow this full-off picture book. If I am to spend 100 hours on a book, I rather get more material and less buffer, if you will. I know a lot of people who love head first series and it works for them. But I don't understand why? We are not kids anymore, unlike what authors of head first series think. Some of their jokes are really funny. Some others are just stupid! I give 2 star to the sense of humor of this book, but since the book is far less efficient for me than for example Manning Pulishing Books, I would give Zero to other parts of it. Again, this book covers a lot of good material, but just isn't for everyone. Beware!

B00006879E|5.0|Maroon 5 are one of the few bands out there that can successfully fuse r&b and rock together. Adam Levine's vocals are amazing, as is the music. People have been puting down this band alot, i have no idea why. I guess they dont see the magic that this band produces. Absolutely amazing.
068987474X|1.0|When I saw the Sex and the City episode where Miranda and \\"the girls\\" find out that sometimes \\"he's just not that into you,\\" I thought it was about time someone told women this truth. Stop the second-guessing; stop the excuses. If a guy doesn't make the effort, he's not the guy.<br /><br />There are a few problems with this book, though. First of all, when I buy a single CD, I expect a song or two--maybe three. That's what singles are good for. When I buy an album, I expect at least ten different songs. This book is like an entire album with the same song repeated thirteen times. You won't learn anything from this book that two minutes of hilarious Sex and the City won't teach you.<br /><br />The other major problem with this book is that it takes a good premise and twists it beyond reason. Yes, it's true, men who don't make an effort aren't worth your time, and you shouldn't make excuses for them. On the other hand, that doesn't mean you shouldn't also make an effort. Anyone's who's interested in someone else should make an effort. This whole men want to pursue crap is obviously the author's own values that he's trying to impose on all of the male gender.<br /><br />Some men like to pursue. Some like to be pursued. Some like both, depending on the situation. Somehow \\"ditch him if he doesn't call you\\" morphed into \\"don't call him.\\" Weird.<br /><br />Much like Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus, this book thinks its thesis is so brilliant that it's worth repeating ad nauseum. It's not.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Van Halen's debut came out in early 1978.  A time where punk and disco were changing the musical atmosphere.    <br /> <br />It's really hard to say anything new about this album that hasn't been said before,  but... this album completely reset the template for hard rock music.   Eddie's guitar playing skills in the early VH albums STILL leave me breathless.   Roth wasn't the greatest vocalist, but he was such a great charismatic showman that he was brilliant.   I'm admittedly not the biggest hard rock/heavy metal fan,  but Van Halen, at least the DLR lineup, is still one of the best bands ever to walk the face of the earth. <br /> <br />There isn't one clunker on this album, or in the entire Roth lineup of Van Halen.    If you don't have this album and you are a fan, what's the holdup?  You don't get much better than this.
B000002KDG|5.0|I'm not that big of a Neil Young fan (or Crazy Horse, for that matter). The only other Neil Young song I heard was \\"Old Man,\\" which was featured in the \\"Wonder Boys\\" soundtrack (the underappreciated 2000 \\"dramedy\\" starring Michael Douglas). That song was brilliant, but it didn't exactly show why Neil Young is hailed as the \\"Godfather of Grunge.\\" Upon finally listening to \\"Rust Never Sleeps\\" on my parents' old record player, I think I have an idea why. But what I was more surprised is how much I ended up loving the album. \\"Grunge\\" isn't important here now. What's more important is the album content, such as the state of rock music (at the time), American history (Native American mostly), death, the need to get away, or just a very cool story about space.     He presents all material from folk-sounding melodies, to punk rock, to all out hard rock... perhaps even a hint of \\"grunge.\\" There's not one other band/artist that can have an album that presents their material in different song styles... well, there's the Clash... and Bob Dylan... and what's-his-face... and whozits... and that guy, the one who always wears a shirt. Okay, so there are others, but Neil Young is the only one I feel that did it perfectly without slipping up or sounding weird or out of place.    The first side is nothing but folky and acoustic songs. Starting off with \\"My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue),\\" the most famous line, \\"It's better to burn out than to rust,\\" grabbed my attention right away. Naturally it would since I listen to a lot of Nirvana stuff and read some bios on Kurt Cobain (Kurt writing in his suicide note, \\"It's better to burn out than to fade away.\\") But the song's main topic is rock. During the '70s, it seemed as if rock was dying... or was already dead. The '70s was mainly disco and punk, from the Clash or Village People. And even rock and punk seemed to have incorporated disco into their music (eg: Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" or the Clash's \\"London Calling\\"). Distant memories of \\"Dark Side of the Moon,\\" Jimi Hendrix, or any Beatles stuff were fading because everyone would rather hear the Bee Gees' \\"Stayin' Alive.\\" Jim Morrison once declared \\"Rock is Dead,\\"... but not until Neil Young made what is arguably his finest work (some still say \\"Live Rust\\"). And his first song reverses what anyone thought at the time or still thinks so to this day. Right away, Young declares, \\"Rock and roll is here to stay,\\" then later on, \\"The king is gone but not forgotten/This is the story of Johnny Rotten,\\" talking of both Elvis and the Sex Pistols. Then... \\"Rock and roll can never die/There's more to the picture than meets the eye.\\" Rock music has returned with this album.    \\"Thrasher\\" has subject-matter remotely similar to a few songs in Pink Floyd's excellent \\"Wish You Were Here\\" album (the songs \\"Welcome to the Machine\\" and \\"Have a Cigar\\"). Like how Pink Floyd lashed at greedy music execs, Neil Young lashes at those who \\"sold out.\\" He says they were poisoned, lost, became \\"park bench mutations on the sidewalks and in stations,\\" and waiting. Young implies that he would never sell out, which, according to Flea (Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist), he hasn't done yet.     But the biggest surprise for me was the song \\"Pocahontas.\\" There are extremely few songs that can make me shed a tear... Neil Young's \\"Pocahontas\\" is now one of them. In just 3 minutes 22 seconds, Young is able to tell the entire Indian story from the beautiful beginning, to the \\"White Man\\" occupation, to the slaughter of Indians and buffalos, to a tragic present-day poor Indian living in a slum \\"at the top of the stairs/With my Indian rug and a pipe to share.\\" A soft, blissful, romantic, beautiful, and tragic song... not even Bob Dylan can top this. Native American history is quite sad and tragic, and the present-day state of Native American life isn't any better. Not many people would give thought to this issue. Neil Young just told it like it is without holding back. There is not one other personoutside of the Native American race or who isn't some politician that can come out and talk about it (maybe Iron Maiden, with their song \\"Run to the Hills\\"). I guess the song just means so much to me since I am a so-called Native American (Navajo, to be exact). Perhaps I am taking it more personal than how it should be accepted or viewed. But nonetheless, \\"Pocahontas\\" is a tragic, emotional, and powerful song. As for \\"blissful, romantic, and beautiful\\"? Young later on sings:    I wish I was a trapper  I would give a thousand pelts  To sleep with Pocahontas  And find out how she felt  In the mornin' on the fields of green  In the homeland we've never seen.    Maybe a love that can't happen is what Young is suggesting here? But then adds that \\"maybe Marlon Brando will be there by the fire.\\" And talks of Hollywood, an astrodome and the first tepee. What lies in the future, perhaps?    Side two of the LP is when Neil Young and Crazy Horse comes fully blasting with their electirc, hard-rocking pieces, beginning with a narrative by a \\"young boy\\" who ultimately gets killed in battle in the song \\"Powderfinger.\\" \\"Welfare Mothers\\" is a hilarious song about divorced lower-classed women. It's supposedly a \\"punk\\" song, and it may not sound like it, but the backup vocals and funny lyrics, complete with a hard-rocking sound, makes it all the more \\"punk.\\" Sedan Delivery\\" is a song about being with yourself and finding yourself by just getting away for a while. This is something that applies to everyone.    The album then ends on \\"Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black).\\" Similar to the beginning track, only with slightly altered lyrics and being a loud, anthemic, hard-rocking masterpiece, making the former acoustic piece more powerful than ever with fuzzy and distorted guitars, giving a hint of \\"grunge.\\" With Neil Young still around, rock and roll is definately not dead.     From \\"out of the blue\\" and \\"into the black,\\" Neil Young and Crazy Horse provides a true masterpiece that I'd add tomy top ten albums of all-time list. He tells us a brief history of our country, more about rock and roll music that can still apply to this day, a story told from beyond the grave (\\"Powderfinger\\"), and tells each song from different times, whether it'd be past, present, or future, and sometimes even \\"time travels\\" in just one song. Some time ago, Rolling Stone magazine called \\"The Velvet Underground & Nico,\\" quote, \\"The most prophetic album ever made.\\" Pish! Not a chance. Give me \\"Rust Never Sleeps\\" any day.

B00013F38K|5.0|I remember watching this show religiously when I was a kid and thinking it was the best thing on TV. The philosophy of life exemplified by the character Kwai Chang Caine (David Carradine) had a real and lasting impact on me. Watching the same episodes all over again 30 years down the road, I find that they have not lost their original power. I would recommend watching this show with your children. If everyone learned to behave more like Kwai Chang Caine, the world would be a better place indeed.
0061015725|3.0|Let me tell you, I was so hooked the first 50 or so pages, I couldn't stop reading. <br /> <br />I thought this whole \\"nanotechnology\\" business was fascinating...I couldn't get enough of it. As you're reading, you yourself will imagine dozens of horrific ways this sort of stuff can go awry. Thinking back to \\"Jurassic Park\\", he does something similar: a cutting-edge, just-in-the future technology that has one obvious but still quite interesting focus (dino-DNA cloning), and then takes you on a rollercoaster that springboards from that initial conceit. <br /> <br />This book has that locomotive start. You learn more and more about these swarms and computing technologies that seem ominous and powerful and mysterious. <br /> <br />Then, and fairly suddenly, the plot devolves into a sub-standard B-movie scenario.   <br /> <br />You know, a group of people, isolated, with \\"something out there.\\"  <br /> <br />Ooh...run outside! Quick! Get back inside! <br /> <br />I dunno...I just expected so much more from the way this novel opened...something more disturbing, I guess. It seems that the misuse of what Crichton describes could go so way beyond what is conjured here, this seems slight. <br /> <br />Halfway through you'll think this might make a cool movie. Then you think, well, maybe a TV mini-series or something. <br /> <br />Now I think (hope) this is merely a prequel to something far more sinister and suspenseful.
0671015206|2.0|When I set out to work hard so many years ago, it was because I wanted to live in a beautiful home and be able to buy stuff.  I did not want the severe restrictions of poverty that I had endured as a kid.  Now that I have made a decent income, why should I choose to live otherwise?<br /><br />The point of education is lost.  Although I cannot, yet, live very long in my current lifestyle if I lost my income (yes, in small part because of student loans), the fact I have a good education means I could find another job tomorrow that would enable me to do so.  Since I hit the work force, I've been offered every job for which I interviewed (but have chosen to stay where I am).  I have ample disability insurance if something awful should happen.<br /><br />So, now that I can buy what I could not buy before, I'll go right on my merry way and do so (when the desire strikes, anyway).  For me, it has nothing to do with keeping up with the Jones - I drive a Honda- but because I always wanted to live in a beautiful home - and now I do.  Everytime I pull in my driveway I smile and think \\"this made the day worth it.\\"  Giving my husband a Harley for Christmas (and to charity) gave me more joy than any net worth could.<br /><br />Also, no one has ever explained to me, why, if I did lose my level of income, I couldn't just at that point live in squalor - as per the book's directive?  It would feel like defeat, but so would having an income but not having anything I really wanted.

B00000295Y|4.0|When I first heard Cypress Hill's music I was amazed that I actually enjoyed it.  Not only that, I loved it.  As a metal fan, when rap appeals to me, it's something close to a small miracle.  Cypress Hill has a catchy beat with incredible lyrics, however like metal they use their fair share of curses and \\"swear words\\" so if you're not into that, you're probably not reading my review right now.  But anyway even if you're not a rap fan you should try Cypress Hill because at worst it's a small reprieve from today's rap about bling-bling, Escalades, and all that other \\"good\\" stuff.
B000000OAN|5.0|What can be said about this album that hasn't been said a million times already? That it's Queen's crown jewel? That it's a masterpiece? That it features some of the most lush, gorgeous music ever featured on a Queen album? All of that, and so much more, is true.  It is possibly the best cross-section of Queen's various styles, featuring head-banging rock (Death on Two Legs, I'm In Love...), quirky jauntiness (Good Company, Lazing..., Seaside Rendezvous), movingly sparsity ('39), dripping lushness (Love of My Life) and epic masterpiece (do I even have to say it?).  Everything about this album has Queen stamped all over it.   <br />My personal favorites, \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" aside, are \\"'39\\" and \\"Love of My Life\\".  '39 is just a real toetapping folksong type of number, and definitely not a song Freddie could have pulled off the way Brian does, with his simple interpretation of the lyrics.  The harmonies on this song are amazing as well.  As for Love of My Life, a great crowd singalong in future concerts....it simply soars.  From the arrangements to the harmonies (and seemingly impossible high notes), to the harp which Brian learned to play JUST FOR THIS SONG, it's impossibly gorgeous and heartbreaking.   <br />And of course there is \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\".  Again, what can be said about this song? Mainly that it is the shining example of Queen's vision, not to mention the writing talents of Freddie Mercury, and no other band could have matched it. <br />I adore this album and have listened to it, beginning to end, many many times.  There are few albums which I feel so strongly about.  Just listening to the opening notes gives me chills.  The Beatles had their Sgt Pepper, The Beach Boys had Pet Sounds.  Queen had A Night at the Opera.
B000002U84|5.0|Duran Duran was perhaps the quintessential 80s pop band, and 1982's \\"Rio\\" was the quintessential Duran Duran album.  Birmingham, England's \\"Fab Five\\" were primarily known for their hit singles and the lavishly produced videos that accompanied them.  \\"Rio\\" includes some of their very best hits: \\"Hungry Like the Wolf,\\" \\"Rio,\\" and \\"Save a Prayer.\\"  But this is more than just a singles album. With \\"Rio,\\" Duran maintained their New Romantic pop excellence over the course of an entire album.  They would produce many more hits throughout the 1980s, but they wouldn't release another full album as strong as \\"Rio\\" until 1993's \\"The Wedding Album.\\" <br /> <br />On \\"Rio,\\" Duran perfected a formula that they devised on their first album, 1981's \\"Duran Duran,\\" and would repeat throughout the 1980s: a \\"side one\\" of catchy, up-tempo songs and a \\"side two\\" of moodier, atmospheric numbers.  For those who remember the days of vinyl, \\"Rio\\" is truly an album of two perfect sides. <br /> <br />\\"Side One:\\" The opening chords of \\"Rio\\" explode like crashing ocean waves, with Nick Rhodes' ingenious use of synthesizer arpeggios setting the stylistic tone for the record.  The title track's euphoric, eternally memorable chorus is equaled a few songs later by that of \\"Hungry Like the Wolf,\\" \\"Rio's\\" other smash single.  \\"My Own Way,\\" a bigger hit in the UK than in the US, doesn't quite match the catchiness of those two songs, but nowhere else is Simon LeBon's braggadocio so gloriously evident (\\"I'm on 45!\\").  \\"Lonely in your Nightmare\\" is a lovely, piano-driven midtempo song, while \\"Hold Back the Rain\\" is an aggressive, pulsating dance track that spawned endless 12\\" mixes. <br /> <br />\\"Side Two:\\" The ominous intro of \\"New Religion\\" segues to a bass-driven groove that exemplifies Duran's moodier side.  \\"Last Chance on the Stairway\\" is a giddy paean to youthful romance, a teenybopper's guilty pleasure.  \\"Save a Prayer,\\" a lush, calypso-flavored ballad, evokes romantic nights in tropical paradises,while the final track, \\"The Chauffeur,\\" builds dramatically from a sparse keyboard ostinato to a dense instrumental coda that became the highlight of many a Duran Duran concert. <br /> <br />There's no doubt that Duran Duran relied on visuals as much as music to achieve their fame.  Indeed, \\"Rio's\\" exotic, exuberant Nagel cover girl succeeds as well as the music itself in establishing Duran's jet-setting zeitgeist. But with \\"Rio,\\" Duran Duran proved they're more than just well-coiffed video stars.  As emblematic of the 1980s as they are, these songs have nevertheless stood the test of time.  Like a glittering, multifaceted diamond, \\"Rio\\" endures as a shining example of 80s pop music at its best.

B000062YAZ|5.0|What can I say about \\"Reign In Blood\\" that hasn't been said? Mmmm, tough one! So intead of doing a regular review, I'll share some of my thoughts when this baby came out. There was a high anticipation for this album, not only from underground metal fans but also from more mainstream metal people. SLAYER was, at the time, the epitome of underground thrash, still untouched by major labels, so some of us fans were a bit nervous that the band would go \\"soft\\" for this release. My fears were, obviously, unfounded: METALLICA's \\"Master Of Puppets\\", released earlier in 1986, proved to be an even heavier record than \\"Ride The Lightning\\" and so was ANTHRAX's \\"Spreading The Disease\\". So, it seemed, that thrash bands signed to majors were actually getting heavier and faster! RIB was released, I think, in mid 1986, after some push and shove from CBS records, SLAYER settled with DEF JAM Records, distributed by GEFFEN. I open the vinyl (yep, it was vinyl back then!) and drop the needle on \\"Angel Of Death\\". Not only did it sound loud and fast, but the production was superb. Every instrument was listenable, clear, yet sounded like a train about to derail. The guitars were particularly crunchy. Prior to this album, SLAYER's guitar sound, though menacing and fierce, paled in comparison to the much chunkier sounds of ANTHRAX and METALLICA. Now the band was getting a much more brutal and chunkier sound that only made the overall record more violent. In fact, not even recent SLAYER albums have matched the sheer CRUNCH of this album. The drums, courtesy of maestro Dave Lombardo, were also crisp and clear. The snare sounded like a battering ram. The bass drum sounded incredibly powerful. Dave's drum work here has captivated the minds of hundreds of thrash drummers around the world, with his unbelievably fast drum rolls. One thing I'd like to point out is that there isn't that much double bass work. It's just \\"Angel Of Death\\", \\"Post Mortem\\" and the end of \\"Raining Blood\\". Another thing is the speed. Sure, this album has virtually no SLOW songs (\\"Post Mortem\\" is probably the \\"slow\\" number here, but picks up the pace at the end) and it sure is faster than what ANTHRAX and METALLICA were doing, but they certainly weren't THE fastest band at the time. KREATOR's \\"Pleasure To Kill\\", DARK ANGEL's \\"Darkness Descends\\" and even crossover/grindcore pioneers CRYPTIC SLAUGHTER, played at much more frenzied speeds to the point of being ridiculous. You have to remember that during the Thrash era, heaviness was measured basically by how fast a band could play, where as today, a \\"heavy\\" song might probably be a slow, lumbering number a la MELVINS or CATHEDRAL. Still, SLAYER outlasted all the bands I mentioned, which probably goes on to show that it's also the good songs that count, and RIB is filled with 28 minutes of them. Enjoy this album at full blast and please, DO annoy your neighbors!!!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|There is no gray area for this movie: You either love it or you hate it. Full f marvelous  visual and sound effects, Donnie Darko is not for the faint of heart. It blows away much more gory thrillers with it's tense building rhythm and shocking insights into the mind of a disturbed young man. My personal favorite  character is Frank, the demonic spirit rabbit from the future. His creepy voice and sudden ghost-like appearances really make you shiver. Anyone who likes  Johnny The Homicidal Maniac would absolutely love this movie. It has the  same dark humor and twists.I was somewhat expecting a more violent end like perhaps a school shooting but the finale is  infinately more surprising and thoughtful.
B0000027I6|5.0|It's a composition masterpiece. This is the unrestricted Floydian style that you won't hear on the radio.  <br /> <br />I think the only people that won't like this album are one's that might take offense to his references to religion and how it's used to persuade the masses. <br /> <br />I've listened to this album a thousand times and love it more than most of any other Floyd album....  <br /> <br />If you like The Wall you WILL love this album.... <br /> <br />
B0006399FS|4.0|I was the same as alot of you people on here.. I first heared this album and hated it. I have always been a big U2 fan and after getting use to and really loving \\"Vertigo\\"I was really looking forward to this realease....Well it wasnt until my 5th or 6th listen that I really started to get it and now I have to say it is atleast my second favorite album of all-time..    1.Vertigo-Probably my favorite rock song of 2004. It did show a freshness and youthfulness in thier music that I personally thought Beautiful day lacked.    2.Miracle drug-Not an epic but still a nice,sweet song and good to hear Edge singing(I think)in a part of it.It did take me awile to warm up to it though    3.Sometimes you cant make it on your own- Anybody who has had a love/hate relationship with a parent can definetly relate and its just overall maybe the most emotion BOno has sung with in a song in a long time.    4.Love and Peace or else-Do not like this song much. I think it sounds like something they must of worked on since the Rattle and hum era. I think it does show the potential to be good live though.    5-City of Blinding lights-Again another song that it took awile to warm up to but I now really enjoy it. Very pretty and though the music is a little cheesy still a very nice song.    6.All because of YOu- One of the first songs that I really kind of like right away. Its a catchy and also in my opinion very Christian rock oriented.    7.Man and a women-the little sister thing is a little wierd at first but its a very good song and I think a very unique sounding U2 song    8-One step closer-least liked song on the albulm. Almost always a skip.    9.Crumbs at your table-After Vertigo it was the first song that jumped out at me but now its kinda getting old.Still a cool song though.  10-original of the species-Favorite song on the album.DOnt know why but its just something that jumps out at me the same way \\"when I look at the world\\" did on the previous album.    11.Yahweh-Hated the song atfirst but have grown to really like it alot now.    P.S. I think Bono is the least coolest of the Band and I hope the rest of the members get credit for creating a semi-masterpiece.I think if your combined the last 2 efforts it would be a really good album    1.vERTIO  2.ELECTRICAL STORM  3.eLAVTION  4.Miracle drug  5.sometimes you cant make it on your own  6.Kite  7.All because of you  8.summer rain  9.when I look at the world  10.City of blinding lights  11.Original of the species  12.beautiful day
0393057658|5.0|Rarely do you come across a book on pro sports like this one, that manages to infuriate one group, enlighten another, and, at the end of the day, have a significant impact on the sport it covered.  Moneyball essentially is a baseball how-to guide on constructing a team through maximizing the talents and abilities of low- to medium-cost players, rather than building one by overpaying for high-priced talent or marquee names.  It is also a study of how one man -- Oakland A's GM Billy Beane -- and his followers go about finding these low- cost players, and what qualities and statistics they look for and value the most.  Overall, it brings to the forefront a debate that has already played itself out in Major League Baseball in the 1-2 years since this book hit the shelves -- old-time, traditional scouting vs. statistical analysis and theories. <br /> <br />Michael Lewis is provided a great deal of access to the Oakland A's mid-season, and it's surprising to me that Beane allowed so many of his ideas to be publicized while he is still in a competitive position.  Lewis portrays Beane as restless, not satisfied with mere wins, but seemingly moreso with constant tinkering with and improving the team. The actual game on the field is of little use to him, but the numbers that flow in once the games are over are his main course.  Beane challenges what he perceives as the outdated scouting machine across the league, the idea that a player's value can be assessed by watching him throw or hit, looking at his frame and how he can fill out physically, and \\"meaningless\\" stats like batting average and RBI.  Instead Beane ignores a prospect's physical attributes (see Jeremy Brown), and focuses instead on a player's ability to draw walks and get on base.  Lewis deserves a great deal of credit in taking all this information, analysis, and statistics and writing it all in a way that readers can easily understand. <br /> <br />As for Beane's theories themselves, several of them have workedtheir way into the game already.  The Red Sox built their 2004 squad with Moneyball in mind (GM Theo Epstein is one of Beane's disciples) and won the World Series employing OBP guys like Mark Bellhorn, and buying low on plenty of middle-tier free agents in the past two years, most notably slugger David Ortiz.  But there are also a bunch of his ideas that are a little puzzling, and quickly have been tossed aside by baseball minds.  The idea that the dominant closer is a myth (and that any journeyman can close out something like 98% of leads in the 9th inning) has quickly gone by the wayside -- even by Beane and his followers (Oakland and Boston have both invested in high-priced closers in the past two seasons).  And Florida quickly disspelled Beane's staunch belief that bunting and stealing bases are counterproductive and meaningless, by merely winning the World Series in 2003 through speed and aggressive baserunning.  And I wonder what Beane has to say about the impact of Dave Roberts on last year's ALCS. <br /> <br />Whether you buy into what Beane is selling or not, whether the introduction of \\"rotisserie\\"-type analysis and team-building is upsetting to you or not, the book is great, and on top of that, it's had a significant and increasing impact on Major League Baseball.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|When you see the trailers and see Will Ferrell in that dumb Elf suit it is easy to dismiss this movie.  Just don't give in to that first impression.  This is a very funny, often witty, sometimes delightful film.  It has a very good heart and Will Ferrell gives a performance with an amazing innocence.  Yeah, I know.  This is the same guy who gave us \\"Old School\\" and \\"Anchorman\\".  But this is better (although I liked \\"Anchorman\\").<br /><br />Here you have a guy, Buddy, who ends up being raised at the North Pole among Santa's elves as if he were just another Elf.  A huge elf.  There are some very funny scenes at the North Pole that lead to him being told by Papa Elf (drolly played by Bob Newhart) that he is a human.  Buddy is sent to New York to find his father (played to perplexed perfection by James Caan) who is on the Naughty List.<br /><br />Much of the fun in the film comes from the predictable cluelessness of someone raised as an Elf at the North Pole trying to find his or her way in New York City.  However, there is such freshness to the approach in this film that it is positively joyful.  Buddy interprets things literally with a good heart and everyone views him as being impossibly clever and full of cynical motives or dangerously insane.<br /><br />One of the great moments in the film comes when Buddy takes his new friend who happens to be a girl, Jovie (played by Zooey Deschanel with an inviting softness), around New York for a tour of his favorite places.  I won't spoil this delight for you.  However, one of the great lines is simply a toss away, \\"Watch out for the yellow ones.  They don't stop!\\"<br /><br />Did I expect a movie like this?  No.  Am I happy my expectations were not met?  You bet!<br /><br />Recommended and for any time of the year.
B00005JMEW|5.0|This was one of my favorite films of 2003.  Tarantino is a genious writer/director and his fourth film is by no means a let down.   <br />Kill Bill Vol. 1 opens in a wedding chapel with a bloody dialouge between a  brutally beaten pregnant woman known only as \\"the Bride\\" and her associate, the notorious Bill.  He puts a bullet in her head and leaves her to die, but of coarse, she lives.  Comatose for four years, she awakes with receding memories of what happened.  Uma Thurman gives a wonderful performance when conveying both the Bride's sadness and ultimate fury upon learning of the loss of her baby.  She escapes the hospital and heads for Japan.  There, master sword craftsman Hattori Hanzo makes for her the ultimate weapon of death.   <br />And so, sword in tow, she makes a list that she calls \\"The Death List Five\\" - including the names of her 5 former coworkers, all of them part of the assassin coup known as The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (DiVAS).  These are the same people who showed up unexpetedly on her wedding day, the ones responsibe for the bloody carnage and the murder of her unborn baby - and now, it's time for her to exact revenge.  She numbers them in order of her anger, saving the top cats for last: <br />1) O-Ren Ishii (aka Cottonmouth) - Queen of the Japanese underworld of crime.  (Portrayed in a show-stealing performance by Lucy Lui) <br />2) Vernita Green (aka Copperhead) - A vicious woman, once one of Bill's most ruthless assassins, she is now a stay-at-home mother, married to a doctor in Pasadena, CA. <br />3) Budd (aka Sidewinder) - Budd is the enigma in this film.  Not much of his identity is revealed. <br />4) Elle Driver (aka California Mountain Snake) - A one-eyed sociopathic killer, she is Bill's deadliest assassin and, second to Bill, the person the Bride wants a piece of the most.  In the wake of the Bride's four year slumber, she is currently Bill's lover. <br />5) Bill - In this film, Bill is the man without of face.  Never shown,we know only that he the Bride's former boss and is responsibe for her attempted murder. <br />Now, mind you, many people argue that this film doesn't have a plot.  But in a way, that's the beauty of it.  This films proposes many questions (thus Volume 1), and trust me, Volume 2 answers them all and then some.  This is an excellent movie that I would highly recommended.
0385510438|3.0|Being an avid reader of John Grisham's novels I've reluctantly come to the conclusion he's run out of those superb story ideas that has made him famous.  While \\"The Last Juror\\" will hold the interest of many people, it is most likely a different group of people than those who devoured books such as \\"The Firm\\", \\"A Time To Kill\\", \\"The Client\\", \\"The Pelican Brief\\" and \\"The Partner\\". <br /> <br />\\"The Last Juror\\" is more a description of a small town newspaperman and his relationship with the last juror chosen for a trial, than it is a legal drama.  It continues the slide from greatness, a slide including \\"The King of Torts\\", \\"The Summons\\" and \\"The Painted House\\".  All are descent writings in their own right, but are a departure from the action and intrigue that most of his fans long for.
B000001E18|5.0|This is the most interesting albums i have ever heard and although I am a fan of Radioheads music I think only KID A comes close to the same greatness that Zooropa does as far as Radioheads last three experimental albums. <br /> <br />Zooropa-Just a great opening song with nice change in the middle <br /> <br />Babyface-Addicted to TV.This song is Bono at his best <br /> <br />Numb-yes Edge sings(MUMBLES)incoherent words that turn out to be the most creative masterpiece of a song U2 has <br /> <br />Lemon-Again where the heck were they getting these ideas from?But still a really good song. <br /> <br />Stay-beautiful song.One of top 5 fav's <br /> <br />daddy's gonna pay for your crashed car-dont like this song.

B0006213WG|5.0|Since Sum 41 burst onto the scene with their tongue-in-cheek, take it with a grain of salt hit, \\"Fat Lip,\\" I've been a fan. While everyone was labelling them as a novelty and a passing fad, I was just hoping they would stick around to keep making more refreshing, fun and unique punk records. 2002's \\"Does This Look Infected\\" made good on a promise of more metal influence, and in turn created almost a new face for the band which is pushed even further on \\"Chuck.\\" Now hold on, I know, to use metal and Sum 41 in the same sentence seems absurd, and may ruin what little chance I have of being accepted into any metal community, but Sum 41 embrace the old-school metal influences and turn them into completely original and, well, entertaining compositions. Sum 41 move further away from the label of just being snotty trouble makers and take things more seriously than ever before, with obvious Metallica and Iron Maiden influences to boot. The politically inspired first single \\"We're All To Blame\\" sets the tone for this album, a breezing, fast-moving piece that never lets you down for one minute. The next single \\"Pieces\\" embraces the more melodic and down-to-earth side of the band, while the almost Oasis-esque \\"Some Say\\" takes things in completely unexpected directions. The rest of the album is filled with familiar, fast paced songs that will put a grin on the face of any fan. Not bad for a band that rapped about Judas Priest and mullets in the past. If you never liked Sum 41 before, you might still like this album. It's got something for everyone, it's very entertaining, addictive, straight, and to the point. You don't have to be a fan of pop-punk to enjoy \\"Chuck,\\" because Sum 41 are too good and too special to be placed in that category.
B0002J4X1Q|2.0|This is the first movie in the supposed Resident Evil trilogy and so far, things aren't off to a great start.       For a horror movie, it borders on all-right to bad. For a movie based on a video game it's pretty bad. Not much from the original games is really intact in this movie.  Mainly just the monsters and some of the lab type levels from the first two games are intact, but thats were the comparisons end. Although, to give the director credit, he did say this movie was more of a prequel to the games, rather then a movie version.     Horror movie wise, there isn't that many great moments in the movie. The zombies are mediocre, I'd take Romero or Jackson zombies over these ones any day.  They're just not that frightning and they don't do a whole lot.  The part with the dogs is fairly decent, but the licker at the end of the movie is just plain laughable and crappy. The budget wasn't very big for this movie, but I've seen TV movies with better special effects then this movies licker. Although I must admit, the part where they're trapped in the corridor with lazers that our out of control, is one of those \\"wow\\" moments of horror movies.       The characters are one dimensional and not very fun. Milla doesn't seem to comfortable in her role yet, but that changes in the second movie. Other characters in the movie could live or die without the audience caring much, unless you're like me and would rather just see them all die. The story is descent enough for what this movie is, but it's nothing to write home about.      Overall, it's all right, but I'd stick with the 2nd movie, Resident Evil: Apocalypse for a better time being entertained.
0312995423|5.0|I can't believe this book got an average of 3 stars.  It was an excellent book.  The topic was an interesting one dealing with code breaking, which most people have no knowledge of, so just that makes it interesting.   <br /> <br />The book developes it's main charactors right away and then takes off.  It's a page turner to the end without a clue to how it will end.  It's a great adventure.  If you have the last few chapters to read and it's 12midnight, you are guaranteed to stay up to find out the conclusion no matter what time you may have to get up the next day for work or whatever.
B000001EAQ|3.0|Had another band realeased Pop it surely would have been a masterpiece but with all the hype i think that came with this album the end result was U2's second most creative work after \\"zooropa\\" and Second unfinished work after \\"<br /><br />OCtober\\" The album really is good as had the potential to be thier greatest work but ended up falling short by in my opinion a pretty good margin.<br /><br />1.Discoteche-catchy fun and fun song live.I thought the video was awesome although some thought U2 were being serious and didnt catch the joke.<br /><br />2.DO you feel loved-Underatted song that I think could have been more.<br /><br />3.MOfo-its intense and Dark but something still seems missing from this song<br /><br />4.God will send his angels-I like the WHERE IS THE HOPE WHERE IS THE FAITH AND LOVE part but the rest of song bores me.<br /><br />5.Staring at the sun-Again seems just inches away from being the masterpiece that it wasnt.<br /><br />6.Last night on earth-Interesting video but song really kind of bores me and I think is really bland.<br /><br />7-Gone-Best song by far on album<br /><br />8-Miami-Did Bono really think People would like this?of course some do but I freakin hate that song more than any other in the U2 Catelog.<br /><br />9-Playboy mansion-I have always enjoyed this song and I think it deserved to be on a masterpiece like ZOoropa.<br /><br />10-Please-Pretty good song although the single version is better<br /><br />11-Wake up dead man-DOnt like the fact that he's on Jesus case but probably the most intense song on the album.<br /><br />B-sides<br /><br />Holy Joe-Actually pretty darn good<br /><br />North and south of the river-THe live version of this song is gorgeous<br /><br />Two shots of happy oneshot of sad-Awesome<br /><br />Slow dancing-I like WIllie nelson but I wish Bono would have sung on this non-acoustic version of the song.
B0006MT314|5.0|One thing we can all thank the WB for is its committment to great music to help fuel its shows. This is no different. OTH offers some truely fantastic material and that standout here is Keane's contribution. The theme song, \\"I Don't Wanna Be\\" is excellent and the whole disc flys by as a great listen. The only downside is Sheryl Crow's \\"First Cut...\\" cover. A bit too played out.
068987474X|4.0|I found this book to be really funny, however it wasn't what I needed at the time. This book went farther into relationshsips than I needed to go but I'll hold on to it for the future.

0679428895|5.0|I could barely put this book down; now, having just finished it, it is definitely going on my \\"best reads\\" list for 2005.  A thriller, yes, but just as captivating are the details and research (meticulous, indeed) that brings the geography and those few days in 79 A.D. to life again.  Anyone even remotely familiar with or interested in Pompeii's history will relish this fictionalized account.  Robert Harris has done a superb job!
B0002IVN9W|5.0|This is one of those rare albums that, to paraphrase from that \\"Jerry McGuire\\" movie, has you at hello. The first track on this dark-meets-light pop-rock masterpiece made me stop what I was doing, sit down and gape. It's really that good...and I'm not someone that falls for silly, Rolling Stone magazine-type hype.  <br /> <br />This sextet from Montreal mixes multiple instruments (plaintive guitars, xylophones, accordians, drums) with wild post-punk vocals. Critics have called many of the songs anthems, and I don't think that's off base. Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels) is so haunting, rocking and well-constructed it should've been a radio hit. The ballads are also strong..Une Annee Sans Lumiere is as good a lullaby/love song as an early U2 song.  <br /> <br />Overall, I hear strains of Bowie (in lead singer Win Butler's punky, dramatic vocals), Bjork (his wife Regine's strange soprano), Roxy Music (the lush orchestration), the Talking Heads (this is art-rock, after all) and even the Mekons, those critic's darlings that spin out songs with gazillions of instruments like this. I've got tickets to see the AF live, and I can't wait...
0375713751|4.0|This debut novel by Brit writer Allison Pearson is at the same time typical fun and breezy Brit Lit, and more...it's a truly devastating look at working mothers and the toll their work takes on their marriages, their mothering and their lives. All ensconced in the frothy, fast and fun tone typical of the genre, the book nevertheless tackles some truly serious issues...and tackles them well.<br /><br />Having been on the Mommy Track, having agonized every time I had a sick child and had to be at work rather than at home making soup, I sympathized heartily with Kate Reddy, fast-track female superstar in the all-male world of stocks and bonds. Star of her company, Kate pays and pays and pays as no male colleague would ever be expected to do: It's her nanny Paula who knows how much baby Ben weighs; it's Paula who knows what 6-year-old Emily likes to eat. And it's Paula they turn to for comort. And Kate's husband Richard? Somebody with whom to share the chores and exchange one-sentence orders in the morning; somebody to turn away from at night from sheer exhaustion.<br /><br />Something has to give in Kate's world, but what? Her marriage? Her career? Her sanity? Her soul? We don't have the answer until the very end of the book, and even then we are left to wonder why only women have to make these decisions.<br /><br />A truly delightful easy-to-read book, but one with some meat on its bones. Highly recommended.

B0002OERI0|3.0|Let's get something out of the way right now: Green Day's latest, critically lauded opus American Idiot is NOT PUNK. The band was only borderline punk to begin with (and in more of a Descendents/Buzzcocks/Husker Du sort of vein) on their first three albums, and they more or less completely rejected that basis for alt-rock after Dookie. Nimrod had a sappy ballad with STRINGS, for chrissakes! For the last few albums, the trio have been extensively channeling The Kinks and The Who--one of their songs even swiped the riff from the former band's \\"Picture Book\\" (off of the overlooked '67 classic Village Green Preservation Society).<br /><br />So, throw out the word \\"punk\\" entirely in reference to Green Day. They've now adopted a solid power-pop direction, taking their classic rock influences along with their previous pop-punk roots and making some nice polished catchy tunes.<br /><br />American Idiot is a concept album that sort of parallels The Who's Tommy (also elements of Quadrophenia, whose central character has the same name--ripoff or homage, I'm not quite sure) set in modern-day American suburbia. You've got a sort of messiah figure, disaffected youth, veiled political references (rather obvious jabs at the current Administration), a love story, and split personalites. A \\"punk rock opera?\\" It aspires to that level, with some decent songwriting here and there, but doesn't make the grade.<br /><br />Green Day are hamstrung by a tendency towards cliche--song titles like Boulevard Of Broken Dreams (oh brother) bleed of it, and some of the lyrics are just plain ill-advised (\\"Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me/ 'Til then I walk alone\\"--c'mon, even Conor Oberst writes better diary scribblings than that). However, the multi-part \\"epic\\" Jesus Of Suburbia has notable passages (my favorites being \\"I read the graffiti in the bathroom stall/ Like the holy scriptures in a shopping mall/ And so it seemed to confess/ It didn't say much but it only confirmed that/ The center of the earth is the end of the world\\") and the catchy title track has got some nice bite. It's not Dead Kennedys or Bad Religion, but it'll do.  Armstrong's snotty, affected delivery doesn't sound as old as it should (computer trickery?) which helps.<br /><br />Occassionally the old-school Green Day sound emerges (St. Jimmy, Letterbomb), but most of this album is a departure from Dookie, with some acoustic guitar and lots of production gimmicks. It just sounds entirely too slicked-up. Wake Me When September Ends and Extraodinary Girl bear this out.<br /><br />American Idiot has received a huge amount of attention from the critics, especially considering that everybody was releasing albums with some political content to cash in on the 2004 election (we all know how that worked out); and in light of the current musical climate (two words: Ashlee Simpson) and the fact that the previous two Green Day albums were subpar at best, some of that attention is deserved. However, I really miss the early albums' casual, adolescent wit.

B00005UKE0|5.0|I've known this album since 1973 in which time ofcourse it was in the LP format. It's a very good album, with good songs and somehow some Beatle-style influece on it. After all Ringo Starr also appears on the album. I think that George had so much in him at the time since he only wrote a handfull of songs with the Beatles, so in making of All Things Must Pass he had no problem making it a triple album. The sound is rich and the arrangements and production are excellent. In all this album and, in my opinion, the Living In The Material World are a must have for Beatle fans. They sort of continue the Beatles legacy as do ofcourse Paul's Ram and John's Imagine. After these albums Gearge, Paul and John's style slowly drifted away from the Beatles-style (if you will).
B0006399FS|1.0|I'm going to be honest. I try to find the best in everything when it comes to listening to music but this album is far from good. The music is bland and the lyrics are sub par. Most of the choruses in the songs are cheesy and you imidiately forget about it as soon as the song ends. From front to back it's a real sleeper. I was actually glad to get it out of my CD player when it ended. But I'm sure it will sell 10,000,000 copies just because their name is labeled across the package.  <br /> <br />Bono and The Edge ( Adam & Larry just appear for the bucks, they just care about hanging out ) must have spent 20 minutes producing or at least writing the songs for this crapola of a CD. I can't believe some people like this drivel. U2 just promote selfishness and greedyness. They've disinigrated as a MUSIC band. They're finished. <br /> <br />How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb music just reminds me of 16-year-old white kids who just got their driver's license and is borrowing dad's car to drive around the city with U2 blasting on the car stereo in a lame attempt to look cool. Or even worse, those guys in their early 20s who drive Honda Civics with a mega watt stereo installed and the bass cranked up so obnoxiously loud that the windows vibrate. LOOK AT ME, I GOT THE NEW U2 ALBUM,  YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH I'M SO COOL !!. <br /> <br />This album just seems as though U2 don't care anymore and just want to make more money. This album should have never been released. The last U2 album you should listen to is Pop.  <br /> <br />PS: For the Amazon.com mates: recomended items should be:  <br />War - Unforgettable Fire - Joshua Tree - Achtung Baby - Zooropa & Pop ( you can't recomend a \\"Best of\\" !! Where's the music integrity ? ). Gracias <br />
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Rarely could a pop album stand the test of time, most of them feel tired and old after a few months at most. However, there are thsoe select few the stick in the mainstream and stand the test of time, the work of Madonna and Cindy Lauper, and now Britney Spears with In The Zone.  <br />There isn't any filler here, this is non-stop Side-A music. From the hot openings of Me Against the Music and Boom, Boom to the down right dirty Outrageous and The Hook-Up to the gutsy Touch of my Hand to the sensual Everytime. This album encompasses a wide variety of work that shows that Britney is a entertainer that has got the goods, she is here to stay. <br />
B000002BBY|5.0|I wish I could give this 1,000 stars! Oasis is the first group to EVER cross the Atlantic and educate us Americans on what real music is all about. I remember EXACTLY where I was the first time I saw these boys on the Ed Sullivan Show. They rocked out and taught the Beatles and the Who just how it's done. Oasis set the standard for what a British rock group is all about. Keep it up fellas! Sgt. Pepper was a complete ripoff of what Oasis can do.
B000002UB3|5.0|Abbey Road to me is just as the title of my opinion implies and I find it distinguishes its self from all the remaining Beatle albums in that it fits right in the psychedelic era along with early albums from e.g. Santana (Abraxas), Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Rolling Stones (not their early albums ofcourse but e.q. Sticky Fingers), Deep Purple, Led Zepelin (II, III and IV), Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon etc etc. Abbey Road was therefor also included with albums of the above mentioned groups when going to dance parties (1969 - 1972) with Somthing being the (only) song to be slow danced. Whereas Let It Be was never spotted on dance parties (atleast I didn't see it). I became 13 in '69 so in the summer holidays in '70 - '73 Abbey Road was on my daily play-list along with Al Kooper-Mike Bloomfield-Steve Stills's Super Session among others. It was also released as an Original Master Recording along with Magical Mytery Tour. It also ranks as the highest sold Beatle album along with Sgt Pepper ... <br />So anybody who as much thinks of The Beatles should have atleast that album. As for me I have two Abbey Road LP's (one being an Original Master Recording) and a cd. <br />Enjoy it
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This is pure cinema magic. They hardly ever produce movies like this. Ewan and Nicole have such chemistry.
B00014TJ7K|4.0|I think this is one of the best in music writting both in lyrics and style. I first got wind of this album when I saw the video for Got My Mind Set On You and rushed out and got the 45 record. I played it alot and everytime I did play it I always flipped over and played the other side titled Lay His Head. When I bought the original album, tape and cd the song Lay His Head is missing. I was disapointed, the song could have fitted on it, there was enough room and time. Side 2 was shorter than the other side and could have been placed on the second side.  <br /> <br />When I saw the cd in Wal Mart and saw that it was remastered, I said to my self YAHOO!, it will may have the song Lay His Head on it cause sometimes remaster releases have extra bonus tracks on it and some of those extra tracks are B-sides and what do my eyes see, Lay His Head is missing for the second time! I said \\"Forget It!\\" and put the cd back and I told myself that I will keep my original cd and just have to find the single cd somewhere of the song Got My Mind Set On You.  <br /> <br />This terrible find of the good B-side missing from this remaster of a great album happened before on another great artist's remastered gemm. That gemm was Cyndi Lauper's She So Unusual when they forgot to include Right Track, Wrong Train the B-side to Girls Just Want To Have Fun single 45 on the remaster release of the cd.  <br /> <br />When will we get the proper remaster releases that we been expecting, time will never tell?
B0006M4SO6|2.0|First of all, let me say I've been a HUGE Pat Metheny fan since around 1990. He's influenced me heavily as a musician and composer for years. I gotta say this too. I think the best album he's put out to date is IMAGINARY DAY. Before that SECRET STORY. I just don't understand the reviews here so far, comparing it to the aforementioned albums. It lacks the depth, soul, imagination and experimentation that both those albums have. <br /> <br />I agree with another reviewer here that said this CD basically goes nowhere. Yes, there is a recognizable theme that he carries throughout the whole piece, but what he does with it is not very interesting at all. Everything just seems to be slapped together, and things don't really interweave at all. In fact, there are some stops within the parts, then it goes into another section, which logically should have a track break. If you really want to properly do a large scale work like this without indexing the tracks, why did he break it up in the first place? His whole point was to go against the grain, why is he offering listeners the convenience of \\"parts\\"? If you really want to hear examples of large scale masterpieces, then you should seek out some Morton Feldman (Philip Guston, String Quartet II, For Christian Wolff), Iannis Xenakis, or the Hafler Trio trilogy (Kill the King, Mastery of Money, How to Reform Mankind)  <br /> <br />When I listen to his old stuff on ECM and most of the stuff on Geffen, I get goosebumps when I hear most of that stuff. What's up? I NEVER thought I'd give a Pat Metheny album a bum review, but I guess I am now. If you are a new fan, start from the beginning, Bright Size Life. If you are a long-time fan, just don't bother with this one. Slap on Secret Story instead.
B00004RFFS|4.0|the lost boys is definately the best vampire movie i have ever seen. i was expecting this to be a little differnt then it was but its still very good , actings awesome, excellant cast, etc but i cant really c tom cruise as a vampire still i think stuart townsend in queen of the damned was better.
B00007G207|5.0|There's something magical and timeless about the movies. The stars that inhabit them are like fixed points in a firmament created out of the imagination; ageless reminders that despite the fact that our bodies deteriorate during the passage of time, in our minds we are forever young. Images projected across the distance and onto a screen like ghosts from far off memories have the ability to take us back through time like bookmarkers for important events in our lives. Giuseppe Tornatore's glorification of the movies in CINEMA PARADISO is really a celebration of life and the limitless possibilities for the individual with determination and imagination. There are really three protagonists in this film; Salvatore, the principle character who's story is told primarily through flashbacks; father figure persona grata, Alfredo, projectionist and Salvatore's mentor; and the theater itself, Cinema Paradiso, that refuge for the weary. A place where dreams, if only for a couple hours, can be found. A place where, laughter, sadness and joy can be shared. Paradise! Salvatore is fatherless and Alfredo childless. The two will form a special bond and remain virtually inseperable until Salvatore is a young man. A bond forged primarily in the projection room of the Cinema Paradiso,  and fired by their mutual love for the movies. The years will be marked with tragedy, love won and lost and the realization that perhaps \\"life isn't like in the movies.\\" Alfredo, having lived most of his life through the movies, encourages Salvatore not to make the same mistake, urging him to  \\"Get out of Dodge\\" and direct his own destiny. \\"I don't want to hear you talk anymore. I want to hear others talk of you. Don't come back. Don't give into nostalgia.\\" When Salvatore finally does leave, making it big as a successful and respected filmmaker, it will take the death of Alfredo to bring him back after an absence of 30 years. A trip back in time that will inflame old wounds, but also provide an opportunityfor them to heal, and after the final kiss of CINEMA PARADISO's inspirational last scene, any lover of the movies will find it almost impossible not to give into nostalgia.
B000002H33|5.0|I can understand people not liking Metallica until they say something like \\"You kids need to hear some REAL metal like (insert corny, leather-clad bunch of twinks here). Worse yet, they rate this album a one just because they're mad that it gets more exposure than their favorite band. I'm sorry, but you're not going to convince anyone that Helloween is a better band. Look at the reviews for this album, it's mostly 5 stars or 1 star, nothing in between. Admit it, if you rated it one star you did it out of spite; they at least deserve a two for putting some effort into it.     <br /> <br />90 percent of heavy metal from the 1980's sounds ridiculously corny today but Master of Puppets still holds up. Highlights for me are the title track, Orion, and Damage Inc., but every song has cool moments in them. Also, If you play guitar, there are a ton of great riffs to learn on this album.
B000286RKW|5.0|Few films ever express a wider range of emotions than Goodfellas, a contemporary American classic directed by Martin Scorsese. Goodfellas, based off of the book Wiseguys, depicts the life of half-Irish Henry Hill, a member of a notorious mafia clan that makes money by stealing from the local airport, among other things. Beginning when he enters the mob at fifteen and ending when he ruins it at forty, Goodfellas, which is based on a true story, will entertain you from start to finish, and you'll find yourself wanting to watch it again and again. However, the films gets very violent at times, and it may be hard to watch for those with a weak stomach or a non-violent demeanor. Still, I'd reccommend this to anybody above the age of thirteen, and since, as stated above, the movie is filled with all sorts of emotions, there is truly something for everyone. At times a thriller, a romance, a comedy, or a violent crime drama, Goodfellas never ceases to amaze me with its astounding nature, and it is truly an American masterpiece worthy of the highest praise.
B00005UW7G|5.0|Joseph Losey's Don Giovanni is masterful. The opening scenes resonate perfectly with the music. The gathering clouds slowly darkening the sky and the melancholy sea beating against the shoreline foretell of a sea-change. Bad days are ahead for the Don. Ruggero Raimondi is the perfect Don Giovanni - totally believable and true to Mozart's characterization. The location shots add a dimension to Opera that take this production to another level. Losey makes sure the music is always in sync with the action. When Don Ottario is singing in the Gondolla, for instance, the oarsman is keeping perfect time with the music which, esthetically, is a major improvement over what is normally a dry section of the Opera. Another interesting touch that Losey gives to this production is the character, played by Eric Adjani, called the \\"Silent Valet.\\"  A sly mephistophelean presence that provides an excellent counterpoint to the levity of Jos van Dam's Leporello. Though he never speaks, his demeanor encourages the Don's baser instincts (one might even argue that he is an image of the younger Giovanni). Losey is masterful in creating visual images that give the story more depth. There is a scene in particular, in which Giovanni watches  a nude girl bathing. While she is unaware of his presence the scene is a combination of innocence and sensuality. When she does become aware of the intrusion, Giovanni gives her his penetrating stare, which she returns with a look that is knowing and somehow sad. There has indeed been a sea change and the Don is travelling inevitably down a road that will lead to his demise.
B0002XDODU|4.0|If you're a true fan you'll love this cd. Rammmstein has definetly grown over the 10 or so years they were mainstream. Not as great as \\"Mutter\\" but definatly worth lookuing into. I also noticed that they talk about recent events/issues alot, especially in Amerika and Mein Teil. <br />Reise, Reise- [5/5] great song. Very different from their usual style, in a good way. The accordian at the end is especialy pleasently surprising. <br />Mein Teil- [5/5] strange, yet catchy song. Starts out very hard and maintains that way all the way through. An interesting spin on certain events in the German news. <br />Dalai Lama- [3/5] this song had to grow on me. Although it has very meaningful lyrics, but not a very good beat. Again, this took me a while to like. <br />Keine Lust- [4/5] nice. Not their best, but still very good. Good use of guitar, but it sounds too much like the next song, \\"Los\\", with the constant repitition of the title. <br />Los- [4/5] this song is original in that it has no electric guitars, only acoustic. This totally blew me away. Not very Rammstein, but it shows they can play anything. <br />Amerika- [5/5]this is an awsome song. It is extremly meaningful, and you don't even have to know german to figure out from the english chorus that the song is about the spread of Amricanization. Similar in meaning to \\"American Idiot\\" from Green Day, but less rebelious. In fact, its lyrics are ironiclly funny, just like Rammstein from the past. <br />Moskau- [5/5] also an amazing song but very strange meanings. Basically, if you put Amerika and Mein Teil together, mixed with some russian instead of the english on Amerika, you'd get Moskau. Nice use of instruments and very catchy. <br />Morgenstern- [3/5] this song is another that had to grow on me. <br />Kind of slow and gets annoying after a while. <br />Stein um Stein- [4/5] this is a good song that again, has to grow on you, but once it does, it doesnt let go. Very good vocal use from Till. <br />Ohne Dich- [2/5] Ididn't especially like this song. The beat was too slow and it wasn't very hard. Granted, hard is not always a good thing, but I think this song could have used some heavier music. <br />Amour- [3/5]This song took me a while to get used to. It sappy, for those who like that. Compare to \\"I Hate Everything About You\\" by Three Days Grace.
B00004XPPK|5.0|Johnny is a small time, but talented, hustler who finds himself at the wrong end of a gun on the dark back streets of Buenos Aires. He is rescued by a mysterious and controlling stranger, Ballin Mundson, who ends up being the owner of a club/casino that operates under the radar of the law. Johnny and Ballin form a close partnership with Johnny being the \\"man who runs the joint\\" and Ballin the Master. When Ballin takes a short leave and comes back married to the gorgeous Gilda, a threesome develops that puts a strain on the partnership. There is a burning mutual dislike between Johnny and Gilda. When Gilda feigns ignorance over not remembering his name, she coyly replies, \\"Johnny. So hard to remember . . . and so easy to forget.\\" Of course there's much more to their acquaintance than they are willing to acknowledge, and a fusion of sexual heat, jealousy, fear and hatred keep the tension tightly wound which fuels the film. And of course there is Rita Hayworth up front and center. All the accolades that have been showered on her sexy \\"striptease\\" interpretation of \\"Put the Blame on Mame\\" are true! And still this film has much more to offer; an economical but effective story line; a tight witty script loaded with innuendo; and superb acting all around, especially the overlooked icy performance of George Macready as Ballin Mundson.
B000002UJQ|5.0|When I just reviewed The Bends, I wrote heavily about this album, so I thought I should give this one a try too. <br /> <br />Liked The Bends? Good. But when you first listen to this, don't expect the same. The lyrics are shattered and broken, like Thom Yorkes beautiful voice, and this almost metaphoric melacholy runs all the way through the album. <br /> <br />This album needs at least 3 listens to appriciate. After The Bends, this may be a shock to the system. You must give over all your atteention to this music to appriciate that this is the same band, but with a twist. And I must say what a fabulous twist that is. <br /> <br />This album is carefully crafted. For example, it is unfair for a song like 'Fitter Happier' to be assess on its musical merit. It is an album track. If hammers home the albums central message, if the Title and 'Paranoid Android' hadn't already done so. <br /> <br />Best tracks? Paranoid Android, Airbag, Exit music, and Electioneering. <br /> <br />Buy---> Listen (properly) ---> Enjoy ---> Buy all your friends one.
B00005JKGO|5.0|\\"He who looks for God, finds him where he wants.\\" LA DOLCE VITA is a thoroughly modern film that longs for certainty and permanence in a world where the edifices of the past are crumbling. A world where love is illusive. Where the sacred has become sacrilegious. The opening scene of the film has a statue of Jesus being flown past crumbling aqueducts, the \\"modern\\" marvel of ancient Rome. The message is clear: nothing is sacred or permanent. The solution? escapism. And so the alcoholic oracle in the film states, \\"the three great escapes are drinking, smoking and going to bed.\\" What is the point of reflection when a \\"phone call can announce the end of the world?\\" Indeed, one should live \\"outside of passions, beyond emotion.\\" LA DOLCE VITA is a visual spectacle that is as dazzling as it is exhausting. Too much of a good thing can make you sick, and then you have to ask yourself: is it really a good thing? <br /> <br />Marcello Rubini has a gig as a writer, and along with his photographer sidekick Paparazzo, cover (and often uncover) the night scene of the rich and famous, a surreal experience that usually begins around midnight and ends when it runs out of steam in the wee hours of morning just before daylight. This scene is peopled by the privileged few who want for nothing material and yet are bored out of their minds, plagued by an addiction to \\"the sweet life\\" which has deprived them of the taste for anything more substantial. Marcello is both a part and apart of this world, and in his quest for meaning, will encounter fantasy in the arms of movie goddess Sylvia(Anita Ekberg); philosophical insight within the intellectual circle of his friend Steiner; spiritual revelation during a Madonna sighting by two young children; commitment from his live-in girlfriend and the possibility of romantic love with Maddalena, another lost soul.  But fantasy awakens by the light of day; intellectual honesty is hollow, contrived; the \\"holy\\" Madonna is all too human; commitment is a prison; and romantic love is like an echo bouncing from wall to wall until it eventually fades into nothingness. Somewhere in the middle of the film, during  a quiet moment of daylight reflection Marcello gets a glimpse of truth in the innocent eyes and warm smile of a beautiful but unglamorous young waitress, and he is enchanted. In a moment there is recognition and understanding but this moment will pass. Our young waitress will make an appearance during the last scene of the film, calling out to Marcello like an angel through the darkness, but the distance now is too great and he cannot understand what she is saying. After several fruitless attempts to grasp at meaning, he turns around and walks the other way - forever lost.  <br />
B000002TQV|5.0|I have often heard this album referred to as Radiohead's second best album. Whilst it is certainly true that 'Ok Computer' is Radioheads defining album, I think they're totally different. <br /> <br />If a friend of yours is talking to you about music, and you want to introduce them to their music, believe me, you will not want to give them OK Computer. Ok Computer takes 3 listens to appriciate. And you have to listen. It's not the kind of music you can put on while you do the dishes, at least, not at first. <br /> <br />There is, too, a reason why Radiohead fans will Hark back the the days of 'The Bends'. It's Radiohead at their most vibrant, rocking, and accessable. Every song is brilliant. <br /> <br />If I've offended any hardcore Radiohead fanboys, I do apologise. Radioheads best music is definately Ok Computer, but this is cool, fun, and open music, and I will hold it dear forever for introducing me to my favourite band. <br /> <br />Oh, by the way - buy both :-)
B00003OSU4|5.0|Bert Stein captures the Newport Jazz festival of 1958 in vivid color and with clarity. While jazz is the primary focus of the film, Stein does meander to the America's Cup race that was being contested off Newport at the time, along with some diversionary local flavor, which gives us a sense of what it was like to actually be there. Continuing along this vein, during the festival itself, Stein spends much of his camera time observing the audience caught unaware reacting to jazz on a summer day; after all, live music does not exist in a vacuum. It's this footage along with the incredible jazz music that makes this documentary really special. As a viewer we get to react to the music, and react to the audience reacting to the music. That girl with the seductively cute smile in the yellow dress, and that gruff man hiding behind the shades with the nervous twitch are people that we can connect to from our own personal experiences at open air summer concerts. The feeling of community one gets as the music breaks down the barriers and the sun begins to set. Stein allows his moving compositions to develop and flesh out the character of his subjects, giving us a nostalgic feeling for a time gone by that may have occurred long before we were even born. It does not matter because we are there! But this particular slice of time has special significance, because jazz would soon be replaced in popularity by Rock & Roll. We watch it happen before our eyes as a young Chuck Berry takes the stage. Backed by some excellent jazz musicians, all looking \\"amused\\" but not taking very seriously the music that would knock them off the charts for good within a couple of years. As Berry's classic Rock & Roll riffs project across the audience, young people spontaneously jump to their feet and start moving to the rhythm while their parents watch, perplexed.
0596007124|5.0|Ok, I need to admit that I'm only into this book about 30 pages, but I've already had some very big Ahas. I checked out a couple of books on this subject, and this one is quite readable. I didn't get it on Amazon (I wanted it now), so I paid too much, but it's worth it.
B0000DJZ8R|4.0|Fans of John Steinbeck's masterpiece are bound to be somewhat disappointed by the structural and textural changes in John Ford's adaptation, especially the complete elimination of the controversial (even by today's standards) ending. In fairness, the late 1930's must be considered, in particular the (1) Communist \\"menace\\" in it's infancy, and the often spurious accusations leveled against labor rights organizations and their connections to the \\"threat\\" (real or imagined) of communism. (2) The very real threat of the California Farmer's Association - portrayed by Steinbeck as a neo-facist organization. (3) The strict Hays codes for \\"decency\\" in film. Given these substantial hurdles, it's amazing this film ever got made.    The Story: GRAPES OF WRATH deals directly with the plight of the migrant farm workers from Texas, Arkansas, Missouri and Oklahoma during the \\"dust bowl\\" of the early 1930's when a combination of over planting and record droughts decimated the farmlands of the lower plains states, forcing the Westward migration of entire communities not only in search of a better life, but for their survival. Steinbeck directs his focus on one family in particular, the Joads of Oklahoma, led by elder son Tom, who in time becomes filled with an almost missionary zeal in his determination to relocate the family to greener pastures. By the story's end, this reluctant warrior will achieve almost mythical status as spokesman for a movement. The journey to California is filled with disaster, small triumphs, hunger and thirst,love, death, sickness and prejudice. California, advertised as the land of milk and honey by ruthless businessmen seeking to exploit the cheap labor, turns out to be a hotbed of hatred and violence. The collision course of the migrant workers, FDR's Resettlement Administration funded to assist those workers, and the powerful California Farmer's Association controlled by even more powerful business interests, sets the stage for the drama after the Joads finally reach California and a new struggle begins.    The Film: Gregg Toland's starkly gray cinematography perfectly captures the mood of the novel, and even though many scenes are obviously filmed on a sound stage, the primary drawback seems to be a slight echo, which at times can be a bit distracting. The casting of Henry Fonda as Tom Joad could not have been better and the acting throughout is very good, especially Jane Darwell's portrayal of Ma Joad, the \\"rock\\" and moral compass of the family. There are so many brilliant scenes in this film that make up for the exclusion of text, creating a visual editorial that is actually more visceral than dialogue and clearly establishes the farmers interdependence and love of the land, that substance that gives them their identity and manhood. When the men can no longer provide for their families, you can see the change of status on their weary faces and then the women forge ahead almost instinctively to ensure the survival of the family in a changing environment. The only real letdown of the film is the ending, which considerably tempers the unrelenting intensity of the novel, and indeed of the previous two hours of brilliance.    The Commentary: The two \\"scholars\\" employed to provide commentary for this DVD edition, spend about a third of the time arguing whether Steinbeck became a conservative during the 1960's - a subject completely irrelevant to the discussion at hand. Furthermore, the connections they attempt to make between the plight of the dust bowl migrant workers of the 1930's and the Mexican workers so prevalent in today's agro business is absurd. Steinbeck's migrant workers were U.S. citizens that had worked their lands for generations, not illegals crossing the border because their own government continually refuses to provide redress for their plight. Additionally, the American migration of the 1930's often displaced Japanese and Mexican laborers. A more accurate comparison could have been made with the black population around the same time period and indeed all the way up until the 1960's. American citizens who were victims of prejudice within the borders of their own country by fellow citizens. Indeed, the Okie's (a negative epithet of the 1930's) were often called \\"white Negroes.\\"
B000002J2B|3.0|I'm in the Peter Gabriel art-rock Genesis camp rather than the Phil Collins pop-rock one. That said, the post-Gabriel Trick of the Tail ranks with their best work. Wind & Wuthering, which seems like an extension of Tail, is probably their last decent record. However, signs of what was to come are evident in W&W. The record seems rather lightweight in comparison to all their previous work. Steve Hackett's guitar work has been push back in the mix, and the mix itself doesn't pack as much punch as previous efforts. The lyrics seem less interesting and have started to lean a bit too much toward sentimentality; there is still a fair amount of humor, although it seems a bit forced at times. The songwriting does not seem as strong as in Tail, which feels like more of a group effort compared to W&W. Still, the instrumental passages, one of the group's consistent strengths, remain interestingly intricate, and the musical quality of the record outweighs most of the lamer lyrical moments. The pretty Your Own Special Way, which reached #62 on the US charts, is a very listenable heartfelt ballad that manages to work in some of the band's instrumental deftness. Eleventh Earl of Mar recalls Nursery Cryme's Harold the Barrell, casting that shorter song's jauntiness and humor in a more epic musical context like Tail's Dance On a Volcano. One For the Vine similarly recalls Tail's Mad Man Moon, and sticking with Tail's formula, Quiet Slumbers . . ., which feels like the most Hackett-influenced moment, recalls Los Endos. Hackett left before the next studio album, the appropriately-titled And Then There Were Three, and the best of Genesis as a progressive rock band was behind them. If you are like me and prefer the old Genesis, W&W is a must-have because of its flashes of the intrumental and creative brilliance that made, and still makes, the old Genesis so appealing.
6305972591|3.0|The success ratio for Stephen King movies would not indicate what a successful writer Mr. King has been.  This one, CHILDREN OF THE CORN, is one of his adaptations that isn't quite bad as some (Thinner, Cujo), but can't reach the best (Carrie, Dead Zone, Dreamcatcher).  The short story is not one of King's real winners and adding padding to the story for the movie didn't help much.  However, there is an eerie atmosphere within the movie, and the concept of a town ruled by children is to say the least unsettling.<br /><br />Peter Horton's character, Burt, is annoying as he spends most of the time doing stupid things and arguing with his supposed significant other.  Linda Hamilton is listless and unusually ineffective.  The rest of the cast goes through the motions, although Courtney Gaines as Malachi has a malevolent presence that adds to the foreboding of the movie.  John Franklin (who played Cousin Itt on THE ADDAMS FAMILY) neither looks nor sounds like a kid, but that might have been the director's intention.  A quicker pacing would have also enhanced the level of suspense.  Not dog doo doo, but not a real winner either.
B0006399FS|1.0|Like many Born Agains, Bono believes that he owes a lot to God, and God has made him a success. I believe that he owes this debt to incredible luck - there has never been a singer so average and a lyricist so mundane that has ever made as much cash as Bono & his band. U2's previous album just about scraped the bottom of the barrel of banal, but this one has bottomed it. <br />How to dismantle this aboninable bum? Stop believing the hype and stop buying this stuff!
1573226521|5.0|I loved this book at first it starts out and I think OK its a bunch of rich shallow kids who are looking for some Nihilistic experience. But then they move on and find the Beach, and its culture, Richard and his 2 French companions find that Nihilistic experience there. Only in the beginning I think Richard was a little disapointed when no one sat around all day and talked about it. \\"Its just a beach resort.\\" Sal told him. But in the beginning it was so much more, Richard is mesmerized by action of fitting in, in this utopian experience. At first he sees no petty differences, just everyone living \\"the Life,\\" fishing, gardening, cooking, talking. There's no television, no radio, no newspapers, and no phone. So they only have each other for company and contact. There are some symbols of the outside world, only really two to be precise, the GameBoy, and the boat. Entertainment and transportation. Two of the bigger catalysts from the modern world. But then things sour, events don't just begin to sour, there were rifts previously there already, but they are made worse by some events that cause these rifts to broaden and engulf the commune. And it becomes evident that these people are in fact spoiled brats of rich parents and think only of themselves and how things will effect them and their time at the beach. They become completly irrational, they do not help people who are in life threatening danger, and allow them to be killed, they do not notify family members that their loved ones have died. In fact when some people are killed by other forces they in fact see this as a blessing, a particular problem that was bothering them has been taken care of, and the commune did not have to confront the issue. This bit was almost completly frustrating for me. I hated the people in the book for this. Read the book, enjoyed it very much, be sure to catch all the Vietnam references, one screwed event compared to another. One reference in particular is the Tet Celebration which signifies a change in the commune's way of life as did the Tet Offensive in Vietnam. <br />
B000001ELR|2.0|First off, let me admit I am extremely biased in favor of 1970's KISS.  To put it another way, I think 1970's KISS was rock and roll done to absolute perfection; post 1980 KISS is utterly bland, generic metal.<br /><br />What truly sinks this album is not so much the increasingly weak songwriting, which is only further marred by the numerous contributions from non-members like Bryan Adams (?!).  No, what really kills it is the drum sound.  Eric Carr may have been a better drummer than Peter Criss (which isn't really saying much), but his drums sound hideous.  If you like that cheesy 80's metal drum sound with the massive gated reverb so it sounds like he's playing in an empty gymnasium, then you'll like this.  I prefer my drums to sound like... well, like REAL DRUMS.<br /><br />The only reason this gets 2 stars and not 1, is \\"I Love It Loud\\" a great rock anthem and the only thing on this turkey of an album that is worthy of the band's 70's heyday.<br /><br />And putting Ace on the cover when he wasn't on the album was such a crass commercial move, only KISS could have done it.
B00005JNEI|1.0|This work has already been shown to be full of deliberate misrepresentations, distortions, and outright lies.  Moore admitted his bias up front, and people that were included in some of the scenes have complained that their viewpoints were totally distorted.  The liberal Hollywood community pointedly failed to even nominate this turkey for anything such as a Golden Globe or an Oscar.  The effect of this silly mish mash is to reduce Moore's credibility on his other projects rather than to say something real.  Alhough he may look like the proverbial 800 pound gorilla, all he can produce is minor monkey shines.
B00005ATQD|5.0|From his introduction into filmdom's big time with \\"Spartacus\\" to the widely discussed \\"Doctor Strangelove\\" Brooklyn born Stanley Kubrick was immersed in frequent controversy.  It was only natural, therefore, that reacton to his final film \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" sent the brilliant director out in a blaze of controversy. <br /> <br />British screenwriter Frederic Raphael, who secured an Oscar for the 1965 drama \\"Darling\\" with Julie Christie and Dirk Bogarde, recounted in his book \\"Eyes Wide Open\\" which dealt with his relationship with Kubrick, recalled how he got a call from the director one day about a potential project.  The novel he was sent as an adaptation possibility he guessed to be a work by Austrian Arthur Schnitzler, a friend of Sigmund Freud.  Like Freud, Schnitzler was interested in exploring the sexual side of humanity as a clue and index to the species as a whole. <br /> <br />That initial call resulted in close collaboration with Kubrick sending a cab to Raphael's South Kensington flat near Gloucester Road and transporting him to his suburban London mansion in quiet and leafy St. Albans.  Kubrick was a man of privacy and after he was satisfied with Raphael's adaptation of Schnitzler's novel \\"Traumnovelle\\" he undertook a vigorous 400 day shooting schedule that saw him succumb to death before the film could be completed.  The setting was moved from 1920's Vienna to 1990's Manhattan.   <br /> <br />Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, then married, developed such a close bond with Kubrick during the filming that he ultimately became a surrogate father of sorts to the attractive couple.  They were compelled to juggle their schedules and eliminate other work opportunities as the production was extended while perfectionist Kubrick insisted that as much time as was necessary would be taken to finish what he hoped would be a fitting masterpiece to culminate a brilliant career. <br /> <br />Cruise and Kidman play a highly successful yuppie couple.  Cruise is a doctor whileKidman runs a gallery.  One night after coming home from a party, while Kidman is particularly high on marijuana, she picks an argument with him on the subject of sex.  She tells him about a Cape Cod weekend in his company when she observed a handsome young naval officer.  Kidman confesses that at that point, had the officer been willing, she would have given up her marriage to have sex with the stranger. <br /> <br />Kidman's revelation results in Cruise exploring sex in Manhattan.  He observes an instance of child molestation in which an angry father berates the men seeking to take advantage of his young daughter, who begins flirting with Cruise when she shows up to rent a costume.  The costume is needed to crash a sex party at a Long Island mansion that features costumed participants wearing masks.  Before they engage in sexual activity a cult ceremony is performed.  Cruise looks out of place, is discovered, and told to leave.  Patient and friend Sydney Pollack, who was also an attendee, later warns Cruise of the dire consequences of ever crossing such powerful people.     <br /> <br />During Cruise's wild night of adventure he meets and befriends a prostitute.  He pays her following conversation without exacting sex.  Cruise later learns that she had terminal aids, recognizing how he had barely dodged a sexual bullet. <br /> <br />Eventually Cruise realizes following his sexual exploration how much Kidman means to him.  At film's end they are seemingly closer together than ever.  The resulting irony is that following this film the couple in real life terminated their own marriage.
B000000H57|5.0|I take 5 star ratings very seriously.  This one deserves so much more than 5.  I've sat down before and really put a lot of thought into making a top 20 albums list of all time (for personal fun, and not just a quick 5-minute deal...  a LOT of thought into it), and guess which album ended up #1?  Ahead of things like...  (probably going to get shot for this one) Pink Floyd - The Wall...  The Smashing Pumpkins - Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness...  Tool - Aenima... <br /> <br />Yes, October Rust.  Most commercial album?  I really couldn't give any less of a damn because it's the most erotic, beautiful, dark, somber, entrancing album I own and have heard. <br /> <br />If you're a huge October Rust fan like me (well, I'm also a huge Type O fan, but I'm talking about the October Rust sound in particular), don't waste your time trying to satiate your hunger by finding something else that sounds like it.  There's nothing out there.  Or if there is, I hope someone posts another review here and informs me.  The closest things I've found are Moonspell - Darkness and Hope, and Paradise Lost - One Second.  But all listening to Paradise Lost did was make me want to listen to Type O, so I traded it not long after purchasing it...  however, I do still listen to Moonspell sometimes.
B0006399FS|5.0|A delicious album, much better songs than the ones from ATYCLB. <br />BEST SINGING since RATTLE & HUM (Thanks Bono!Your voice is BACK!) <br />BEST SONGS since ACHTUNG <br />THere's not a single boring song on the album <br />The sour reviews are mainly from people trying to look smarter than what they really are. just shut up and enjoy the GOOD MUSIC
B000002L9J|5.0|I was accidentally given this album by a math teacher who had a stroke. While this sounds like some bizzarre lyric from a smiths song it is the way I received this album and how I got into the smiths.  In my earlier days I was a huge cure fan and upon finding out my math teacher was too we began sharing material.  Not long after this he had a stroke from which he never recovered.  However he had remembered me and the albums that he had borrowed but not able to remember exactly which one I had lent him he reurned a bunch of albums to me through his daughter most of which weren't my albums albums at all.  When I alerted her to this she said sadly that he wont be able to figure out which one are mine and his.  So I took what I had received.  One of the albums was the Smiths' \\"The Queen is Dead\\".  So while sad about the fate of my math teacher I took a listen...    Enough about my past lets get to this album.  I think as an introductory to the smiths it is a most fitting work.  The smiths are really the finest Jangle Pop band and I would surmise that they are the most accessable to the modern listener.  They as a band take that jangly sound out of the 60's and 70's and give it a Post-Punk New Wave influence that makes them a relevant band today. This album is a showcase of upbeat poppy songs and more melencholy tunes and overall is not too imposing on the new fan. While I prefer \\"Louder than Bombs\\" as the finest collection of work of The Smiths this album ranks highly among their work at all.    The album flows well and you really can listen to it through without having to skip through monotonous tracks.  Among the highlists I believe that \\"Bigmouth Strikes Again\\" is a little absurd but remains one of my favorite uses of vocal effects ever.  \\"Cemetary Gates\\" was the hardest track for me to get into but is now a favorite of mine.  And of course \\"There is aLight That Never Goes Out\\" needs be mentioned.  This track, an oft played concert track is great in its studio version and is the melencholy nadir of the album.      Overall, I  recommend this work highly to Morrissey fans of course but also to fans of good UK rock.  Those of you out there who find Modest Mouse and Franz Ferdinand so catchy and irrestible (they are good) might also find something great in this Album and the Smiths as a whole.  Show your friends something original and play them the track \\"Frankly my Shankly\\"... they are bound to love it!  Enjoy years of listening pleaseure with \\"The Queen is Dead\\".
B00068IOWC|5.0|Lots of fun, energy and heart. what else could one want? <br />BEST SINGING since RATTLE (thanks BONO!) <br />Delicious set of songs, not a single filler IMO. <br />The negative reviews are from people trying to look smarter than what they really are. <br />ENJOY
B000002AS3|5.0|Name one f*ckin band better than OASIS!!! <br /> <br />You can't - you just can't!!! <br /> <br />No ones got attitude like them, no ones got songs like them, no one can f*ckin touch them. <br /> <br />BEST BAND IN THE WORLD, and best album in the world to be released so far - ever!!  <br /> <br />Its their first <br /> <br />Are you dissagreeing with me? <br /> <br />Pink Floyd?- Boring, The Beatles- Old, Radiohead - hah!
B00007KQKM|4.0|Joely Richardson is repressed Constance Chatterly, married to an embittered, paralyzed man (James Wilby) who suggests she take on a lover, the earthy, lowly, gamekeeper Oliver Mellors (Sean Bean).<br /><br />Ken Russell's LADY CHATTERLY (Acorn), is a faithful adaptation of D. H. Lawrence's controversial novel that was the center of the 20th Century's most celebrated obscenity trial. Russell's film does not shy away from bold, passionate love scenes that include full frontal nudity.  He pulls out all the appropriate stops in this nearly four hour (2 disc) BBC production that lets us not only understand but sympathize with all the principals in the adulterous affair.<br /><br />Don't be misled into thinking this is a staid and proper (read boring) British mini-series.  Joely Richardson's brave performance as the repressed wife whose passions are awakened made this one of the most talked about TV movies of the 90s.<br /><br />Don't miss this exquisite, intelligent adaptation of a true literary classic with all the heat intact.
B000001FS3|5.0|U2s Joshua Tree contains alot of U2s best songs and is their best album, closely followed by \\"Actung Baby\\" and \\"POP\\" U2s last proper release. <br /> <br />Now that U2 have let their \\"real\\" fans down with \\"All that you can't leave behind\\" and \\"how to dismantle an atomic bomb\\" <br />all you can do is turn back to their other albums. <br /> <br />Hard to beleive they sound so washed up these days. <br />Their last two albums don't even come close to comparing to this.
0060536357|5.0|Based on exhaustive research, the authors have done a fantastic job putting it all together.
B000003TA4|5.0|Nirvana are a great band and so is this album. <br /> <br />How can anyone with a decent ear for music deny  <br />\\"Smell Like Teen Spirit\\" \\"Come as You Are\\" \\"Stay Away\\" etc. <br />as some of the best songs of all time. <br /> <br />Its a good kick in the teeth thats what it is. <br />And who cares if Kurt Cobain was'nt the best guitarist ever, and his songs are eas to play. <br /> <br />It just shows you that some of the best songs can be the easiest ones to play. <br /> <br />Better than f*cken Pearl Jams TEN!!
B000000OQY|3.0|Before I start I have to ask, as of April 2011 what's up with amazon's search results for Guns N' roses?  This album was on the second, I repeat SECOND page, and you had to go down pretty far, that's what she said, to get to the Spaghetti incident.  They've got that roots of guns n' roses hollywood rose ep above this and other GNR albums, plus a stupid ass bluegrass, I repeat BLUE FREAKIN' GRASS tribute.  Yes music people who have sex with their sisters covered Guns N' Roses apparently.  And I grew up in a redneck town, so don't say they don't, cause I've seen what they're like.<br /><br />Ok, now that's out of the way..  During the late 80's I can only assume GNR was touring heavily for their successful debut Appetite For Destruction.  Axl had big ideas for not only the next, but the next 2 albums, and apparently they were going to take a while, thus they released this little Ep/album to tide people over, and make sure they weren't forgotten upon the Use Your Illusion releases.  Honestly this would have been better if it'd been an actual album release.  They recorded 4 songs, 1 remake of You're Crazy, which served no real purpose beyond being an interesting take on the song.  And they put 4 demos which they added crowd noise to thus making them sound live.  Their first mistake was making these songs sound live.  Their second was, they had recorded covers of the Rolling Stones's Jumpinjack Flash, and Elvis's Heartbreak Hotel, and another cover of Axl's previous band's Shadow Of Your Love.  Those 3 songs are really good and should have been included on here.  I believe Shadow is Steven Adler's favorite, or one of, songs he did with the band, according to something I read on wiki.  they could have added them, and made a full length album out of this stuff, which would have done more than tide people over until the illusions.  But, they didn't, so I guess we'll discuss the actual album, whilst I listen to Judas Priest..  Awesome!!!<br /><br />Reckless Life 8/10 opens the album, and is a cover of Axl's previous band's.  It's a high energy rocker and is pretty decent.  It took a while to grow on me, but was easily one of my 2 favorite songs from this section of the album.  Axl sings/screams higher than ever.  The musicianship and melodies are decent.  Overall a good opening track.<br /><br />Nice Boys 6/10 is a cover I think, but don't ask me who did the original.  I can't get over the ridiculous title of Nice boys.  I don't know it just sounds kind of dumb, but fits with the lyrics of \\"Nice boys don't play rock n' roll\\".  The melody is pretty decent but the chorus is a little too repetitive.  Still it's ok.<br /><br />Move To The City 5/10 how this made the live album is beyond me.  It's ok.  They use a different style here, with more of a groove, ad I believe there's a horn or sax somewhere in the song, but I can't remember.  this one just doesn't do much for me.  I like the attempt at something different, but it needed work.<br /><br />Mama Kin 9/10 is a nice rocker, Aerosmith cover.  I like this one better, though you can't go wrong with Aerosmith, except the just push play album which sucked.  I love the opening riff, and the way the drums fill in in the intro.  They also do a dueling guitar part in the verses which works well.  I could do without hearing Axl sing \\"and suckin' me\\" though.  Please leave SOMETHING  to the imagination.  We don't need to be that direct, course Steel Panther has gone way beyond that by now.<br /><br />Patience 8/10 is the first of 4 acoustic songs.  This one is just a bunch of acoustic guitars, seriously there's at least 3 going, and vocals with a nice harmony at the end.  I like this one, and bought the album just for this song, without having heard it.  I'd just got into the band and heard of this song, so I had to own it.  Oh and Axl can sing at times, well he use to be able to.<br /><br />Use To Love Her 7/10 is a fun little ditty.  Oh yes, I went there.  It's primarily acoustic with an electric doing some soloing here and there.  It's pretty straight forward, and a bit repetitive, but fun.  Granted the subject matter of \\"I use to love her and I had to kill her\\" kind of takes away from that.<br /><br />You're Crazy acoustic 4/10 I hate it when bands put remakes of their own songs on albums, b sides are fine, but not on the actual album.  Heck they did that with Don't Cry, but that was even worse, because those 2 were exactly the same, except the lyrics.  This is an interesting take on the rocker from Appetite, but overall I don't listen to it, and never put it on my computer/ipod.  I like the original better, and don't want anything to do with this.  Now if they'd done an original song in this style, that'd have been cool.  Still it's ok, but not for me.<br /><br />One In A Million 9/10, ah the infamous song to end the album.  Before we get into that controversy let's discuss the song itself.  I love the melodies and guitar work.  This is another acoustic song with some muffled sounding electric guitars playing alongside the acoustics.  This creates a cool effect hearing both.  The melodies sound very reflective, and overall I love this song.  Now some have problems with the second verse, would be my guess with the racial and sexual orientation slurs.  I don't fit into either of those categories, so it's not a problem for me, but honestly I think people are way to sensitive anymore, and our society caters to that.  If you don't like something don't listen to it.  Now I'd understand not wanting something forced on you, but as long as that's not happening, I wish people would stop being wimps and stop crying because something someone said itn't \\"politically correct\\".  Heck I remember sometime in the early to mid 2000's Shaqille O'Niell, I know I butchered the spelling, made a racial comment about the Chinese, no pun nor reference to Axl's later album intended, Yo Ming, probably butchered that as well.  And, no one seemed to care.  If it'd had been a white player saying that about a black one, EVERYBODY would be in an uproar.  You can't have it both ways.  So I went off on a tangent, and I'm not done, what are we going to do when a major crisis happens?  Cry about how it hurts our feelings?  Seriously the people in the US need to grow several pairs, because most of us are children anymore.  Political diatribe aside I like this song and it's a great closing track.<br /><br />So overall this could have been much better with a few changes, and done more than just serve as a bridge to the next albums, but overall if you're a GNR fan this is worth your time.  If you're new to the band get Appetite and the Illusions first, and then this one.
B000068QY7|4.0|Good to see Oasis still mean it. <br /> <br />Great songs - needed to be a bit less polished sounding.
B000000P17|2.0|Ok after listening to his solo material I honestly feel GNR, well the Axl Rose band, desperately misses him more than Slash.  Don't get me wrong, they either need Slash back or someone who can actually play the guitar, buckethead sucks.  And, I can't speak for the other random people who played on Chinese Democracy, as probably short of a billion guitarists contributed to the industrialized nonsense that is that album.  But Duff's songwriting, on his solo/loaded albums, which i recently heard for the first time, is definitely missing.  Now I don't know if he had the chance to write much for the band or not, but his solo stuff is very well written.  He can't sing worth a flip, but still.<br /><br />Anyways, with this album, Guns N'Roses release their final, as of 2012 to date, album.  I'm guessing this was intended to be a release to tide fans over until the follow up to the Illusion albums could be made, but..  Well we all know how that went now.<br /><br />Here we have a bunch of covers.  Now if anyone could make an awesome covers album, it'd be Guns N'Roses.  Their previous covers, as well as Sympathy for the devil, and a couple demos of Jumpingjack Flash and Heartbreak Hotel proved how well they did covers.  But unfortunately this album didn't work out.<br /><br />Musically this album is solid.  Slash, Duff, Gilby and Matt are all solid.  However, there was way too much unnecessary piano.  Sure, it worked ok in Since I Don't Have You, but that's the only song that should've had it.  The production is solid.  Guns N'Roses has always had solid sounding albums, unless you count Chinese as a GNR album.  And, this one's no different.  The large problem here is all the different vocalists.  Sure Axl isn't the greatest vocalist in the world, and his vocals on Human Being pretty well sucked, but he's the voice of GNR, and for them he worked just fine.  Here we get several non vocalists, usually Duff, but I think Slash did some lead vocals too.  This completely ruined most of the songs, as Axl is really only lead vocalist on 6 songs.  Raw Power, New Rose, Can't put your arms and Attitude would've all been awesome GNr versions of these songs had he been the vocalist.  I guess maybe Axl wasn't around for all these recording sessions, so someone else had to do it.  I have no idea.  Either way the vocals on here are mostly terible.  Heck if someone else was going to sing these, bring in someone who can actually sing.<br /><br />Also I couldn't get into all the random nonsense they put in between the tracks.  One moment sounded like someone playing a kazoo or something.  We are also treated to Axl baaing like a sheep.  Pretty stupid if you ask me..  And you did.<br /><br />Please forgive any misspellings or mis ordering of the tracks, as I'm not looking at the album, nor do I have the entire thing on my computer at the moment.<br /><br />Since I Don't Have You 7/10 a ballad to start the album?  What?  This one took me a little time to grow on me.  The 50's style piano threw me.  But, once I got over it, the song is pretty decent.  Axl's vocals tend to screech a bit, and are kind of annoying at times, but again, it's Axl, so it's mostly ok.<br /><br />New Rose 5/10, musically this is a very solid track.  It's a straight up ricker.  The melodies are also fine, and the band does a good job covering it, however whoever is singing on here, Duff or Slash, not sure, can't sing worth a crap, and this has become a song I haven't listened to in years, and probably never will again.<br /><br />Down On The Farm 7/10 doesn't really have a chorus.  For a straight up rocker that can make things tough, but the song has a nice riff and Axl sounds like he's trying to immitate the Sex Pistols or something.  Hell this might be a cover of their's for all I know.<br /><br />Raw Power 6/10 is another rocker with a nice riff and melodies.  Again we get another vocalist, with Axl coming in as a backing vocalist.  After the first verse or so he's actually singingthroughout the rest of the song, but he's too far back in the mix.  The other guy overpowers him.  Ruins an otherwise good song.<br /><br />Human Being 5/10 is another up tempo song.  Axl actually does the vocals on this one, but they aren't that good.  The chorus is ok though.  Why did they decide a piano in this song would be a good idea?  Like nails on a chalk board.  Overall it's ok, but not great.<br /><br />Ain't It Fun 5/10 Axl trades vocals with someone else.  I love the opening guitar parts.  This song has a sinister sound to it that's awesome.  The other vocalist is tolerable on here, but the chorus sucks, too repetitive.  And there isn't a good enough melody for it.  I'm sure it's probably how the original was, but still.<br /><br />Buik Mcain or however you spell that 1/10 makes no sense to me.  It's like they heard part of Soundgarden's Big Dumb Sex, and decided to make a song around a ripped off portion of it.  Axl does the vocals, and his efforts are wasted.  This might have been fine as a straight up Soundgarden cover, but I already like the original, so it's not a big deal.  This would have been a good spot to put their Stones cover of Sympathy For The Devil, which would have been awesome to have on here.<br /><br />Hair Of The Dog 9/10 hells yeah.  This is pure GNR goodness, a mid tempo rocker with a nice riff and groove.  This is one of the few songs that actually sound like GNR.  Pretty much easily my favorite song on here, except Black Leather is also awesome.<br /><br />Black Leather 9/10 is another rocker with kind of a darker tone.  Again this one actually sounds like GNR.  Nice music, nice vocals.  An all around good song.<br /><br />Attitude 4/10 is a very short rocker with a nice melody.  It'd have been awesome if they'd got Glenn Danzig to do the vocals on this one, as the guy who does them sounds terrible.  Danzig is the only person other than Axl I could have accepted here, and the didn't have him.  Actually this would have been an awesome song with him.  Oh well.<br /><br />You Can't Put Your Arms Around A Memory 5/10 is an acoustic, mostly, ballad.  I think it's Duff on vocals, and he sounds terrible.  This is another one I haven't heard in years.  The melody in the chorus also needed work.  Otherwise it's an ok song.<br /><br />I Don't Care About You/Look At Your Game 2/10 the first track is a short punk cover.  it's a rocker, with Axl and another guy doing vocals.  Overall it's pretty chaotic, and really doesn't sound that good.  Soundgarden does a way better job covering this one.  The hidden track is ok, but nothing special.  It's an acoustic ballad, very short.  I just couldn't get into it.<br /><br />Overall this is a fantastic sounding album, but it really didn't sound very GNR.  If this had been an ep with Hair of the dog, and Black leather being the 2 featured songs, Since I don't have you and Down on the farm also included, I'd have given it a better rating.  If you're a GNR or a Duff Mckaigen fan it's worth checking out, at least for the 4 songs I like.  It's ok, but they could have done so much more.  And, where the hell is a Rolling Stones cover?  I can't believe there isn't one here.
B000002C25|5.0|...they blew it with Standing on the shoulder of giants. <br />There are some terrible songs on their. <br /> <br />This is better than Morning Glory, and the only reason why no one liked it was cause there were'nt any real classic tunes on it - but who gives a f*ck!  <br />The songs are great, the musics great it f*cken rocks. <br /> <br />Top Stuff - rock n roll! etc.
B00005614N|5.0|Norman Grantz who set up these dates was always casual and a bit cheap on production for the series of great ones together records he made. Many of these Louis with Ella or the Duke or whomever were done on a day or two's notice when Louis and whomever else Granz wanted him to record with happened to be in New York in the midst of touring.<br /><br /> Yet, for many of the artists, Louis and the Duke included, the natural chemistry that comes with genius, and knowledge of each other's work produced something great and new and wonderful.  This is certainly the case here.<br /><br />  What is never said here, overlooked entirely, and can be a joy to the truth jazz lover is this is Louis's Swing Album. Louis transcends jazz genre to be sure, but I know of no Louis Armstrong album that is so much of a swing album. Thus it is to be studied or enjoyed or both as  a special treat<br /><br />  You get things here that are simply not available anywhere else. There is never enough of Ellington playing piano solid with solos like he takes here, without the band being behind his driving rhythm, his subtle inflections, his commentaries.<br />On the other hand, there is very little of Louis playing and singing swing tunes as opposed to the New Orleans or Pop repertoire.  For both Ellington and Armstrong there is hardly any other time when they are working together with an equal, perhaps only in the great Armstrong/Fitzgerald combinations, and in the live concerts with Ella that the Duke did do we find anything near an equal.<br /><br />  While I like Barney Bigard's work here, it really doesn't rise to the occaision the way that it sometimes did working with the Duke in the late 1930s, or some of his work with the all stars. Frankly, I think Jimmie Hamilton would have been more interesting here, helping the occaision be what it is, Louis showing he can swing too.
B0006399FS|5.0|Ok, first of all I need to tell that I follow this group for the begining ,I have all the collection and this is one of my favorites groups.This album takes the sound of their first songs, a special king of rock that put this group at the top of the peoples preferences, not only with a incredible sound but also with a special message in every song. Some of them like \\"crumbs for your table\\" and \\"sometimes you can't make it on your own\\" have a incredible performance, not only because Bono's voice but also for the sound of The Edge guitar.<br /><br />Everytime I listen to this cd I like it most.<br /><br />Back to the begining ...it could be the other title for this Album.
B0006399FS|3.0|It is not as good as the U2 of the 90's, but is certanly better than the weak ATYCLB. This album sounds more focused and more polished than anything they have done since Zooropa (I love POP but even they accept that it is an unfinished album, you can tell because almost all the songs end with fadeouts) The production is flawlees and the sound is almost as good as POP. The problem here are the songs. There are one or two that deserve to be among U2 best (City of Blinding Lights and Love and Peace or Else), the nice U2 ballad you can count on (Sometimes you Can`t Make It on Your Own), and a whole lot of recycling (Vertigo is a better Elevation, Yahwe is Falling at Your Feet from the Million Dolar Hotel Soundtrack, Crumbs From Your Table borrows guitar parts that seem sampled directly from the Walk On mix tape and One Step is The First Time part II.....even Miracle Drug is cross between With or Without you and Beautiful Day) That does not mean that this songs are neither good nor enjoyable it is just that it is the same patented U2 formula and you start to think that their creative capacity is drained and they have nothing left but to repeat themselves. There are some interesting new sounds (The Beatlesque Original Of The Species, the electro year 2100 blues of LAPOE, and the simple Man And A Women, which to me is their first succesful acoustic guitar driven song) However, it is hard for myself, being a 90`s U2 lover, to admit that this band will never comeback again to being as experimental and as artistic as they were then...they are old and acting like it....i mean is there any other explenation to why they wrote such a crap song like All Because of You? This song can be found in any Bryan Adams album and it has midlife crisis written all over. It also a concern that it is been two records since Bono has written any outstanding lyrics (Pop being the last time and ATYCLB being the worst, I mean he destroyed the song New York and the clichs in Peace on Earth are unbearable, even if the intentions are the best). Right now he is the least talented member of the band, because as Brian Eno said in a 1991 interview for Achtung Baby \\"lyrics are the bottleneck of songwriting\\" and cheap lyrics is what keeps this record from being outstanding, because apart from All Because of You (the Brian Adams song), the sound is very U2 wich is always very good even if they are not experimenting. The guitars, the bass and the drums are very well played....the album does have some amazing instrumental moments great melodies and beatiful arrangements. The lyrical part is not as bad, I have to admit that in this album there are some memorable lines in songs like Vertigo, Yahwe, Man and a Women and City of Blinding Lights but the overall is not as consitent as it was in Achtung Baby for example, but neither as bad as ATYCLB. In the end I think altough it is an enyoable record, U2 has to carry the burden of being mesured against all the great records they did in the past and that is to hard a mesure. I mean, no one can expect to be experimenting in every album and get away with it, they would probably have blew it by now. Also if they had continue that path, we would be complaining right now that we wanted a \\"down to earth\\" U2 record. So I recomend you to relax and enjoy this album because it is an above average record by still an above average band, just no the best band right now as it was in the 90`s  but just the most popular.
B00064MW6A|1.0|The movie sucked.  No ifs, ands or buts about it.  But nobody in their right mind could legitimately say that they weren't captivated by the sight of Halle Berry in that suit! She looked amazing, and I give that walk 4 stars. <br /> <br />Its pretty sad that just anyone can have a movie made these days, and take advantage of the already existing fan base by conjuring up a lame shallow version of a character that someone spend ALOT of time and energy and love building via comics.  Wu-Tang said CREAM (cash rules everything around me).  This is soooo true.  And it rules to the detriment of creativity.  A marble-faced villain who gained her powers from moisturizer?   Sharon Stone's career must be hurting right about now to accept this role. A cosmetic company out to rule the world? I'd buy resurrection by cat breath before L'Oreal global domination. Hey, did anyone see the similarities between this and the original Batman (Tim Burton) story?  Cosmetics driving people mad?  Very very unoriginal. At least Tim Burton made it cool. <br /> <br />I'm not sure who this director Pitof is, but someone should smack the hell out of him.  He had almost no vision. And someone should smack the folks at DC comics for selling Bob Kane's creation to the highest bidder - Halle Berry.  Speaking of Halle again, I really dont respect her as an actress these days.  Her performance in Monster was overrated (make me feel goooooood!!!).  Her portrayal of Dorothy Danridge was pretty shallow.  Anybody see Rich Man's Wife?  Exactly my point. But there was a time when she had promise. Whoever saw Jungle Fever may remember a brilliant crackhead performance. <br /> <br />4 stars because Halle dropped it like its hot... -3 stars for the wickedly suspect CGI integration, crapadocious story, and horrific acting. Net stars = 1.
B000007S5B|5.0|This was supposed to be the Doors' poppy little album. I would have agreed until I got to track 3, Not To Touch the Earth, one of the strangest Doors songs outwith an American Prayer. Love Street is a wonderful little ditty that women all imagine was written about them. Spanish Caravan is just outstanding, and best appreciated played as loud as you can bear. The closing track, Five to One, sparked controversy about its Vietnam connotations, and is a frighteningly powerful number. Jim was obviously drunk (listen for the hiccup!) and belts it out in his sexiest, angriest voice. This album is horribly underrated by true fans, but there's something on here for everyone.
0446677450|5.0|People are always looking for get-rich quick schemes.  Kiyosaki is not selling you a bunch of secrets on how to get rich.  What he is selling is a new way to look at personal finances, and how to train the children around you.  He is selling the idea that most people (Americans) are too wrapped up in conspicuous consumption and trying to obtain those material goods that define wealth in our society.  He shows us some really basic ways of thinking that can stop the cycle of living check-to-check and actually accumulate wealth.   <br /> <br />Many reviewers are confused.  This book does not teach you the secrets of the rich, nor does it try to.  Don't give it 5 stars because it showed you the 15-yr old trick of buyging foreclosed properties.  Take his investment ideas for what they are - creative ways of using the tax and real estate market to your benefit.   <br /> <br />First thing we should all do after reading this book is sit down with a pencil and paper, and draw our personal balance sheets.  If Assets are less than liabilities, reconsider your spending habits, and get smarter.  If not, good job.  Now start making that equity work for yourself by using your natural abilities of creativity.  Thanks Kiyosaki for putting this in an easy to read book.  Let it serve as an educational tool or a reminder to all of us.
B000002I2M|5.0|Even if you only listen to three songs on this album, make it \\"L.A. Woman\\", \\"Riders on the Storm\\" and \\"Love Her Madly\\". The other songs are good but completly overshadowed by the two epics on this album. \\"L.A Woman\\" paints a vivid picture of the both the bright and dark side of L.A. My favourite is \\"Riders on the Storm\\". The end is near, and Jim Morrison knows it. He is telling us that that we are only insignificant pawns in a much bigger chess game. That game is life and death. We should live life to the full, because either the \\"storm\\" or the \\"killer on the road\\" coulld take us at any time. Absolute heaven if you listen to it in the small hours of the morning.
B0000E6I1J|5.0|If you were even a marginal George fan, this concert (DVD or CD) is essential to your collection.  The quality of musicianship is remarkable.  Each performer, has so much emotion as they play, &amp; it shows.<BR>There are almost too many incredible moments to mention, but the short list is:<BR>Clapton's &quot;Beware of Darkness&quot;<BR>Joe Brown's &quot;That's the way it goes&quot; &amp; &quot;Here comes the sun&quot;<BR>Paul's &quot;For you blue&quot; &amp; All things must pass&quot;<BR>Petty's &quot;I need you&quot;<BR>This is the best &quot;tribute&quot; concert I own
B00005NB0H|5.0|Live at Leeds was The Who at a live peak early in their career. The original was a must listen along with Who's Next for straight up ROCK w/o the complextities of Townshends experiments.. i.e. this is THE WHO at their best, they're playing like a band!<br /><br />I must admit I liked the original songlist as being all equally great, there seems to be some filler on this expanded re-issue.. but maybe its good to hear how the Who would try different styles. Just on the original.. it was a start to finish rock bomb explosion. Live rock at it's best.
B0006M4SO6|3.0|Not the usual Pat, for sure, and that is fine; he has gone from places to places and I admire this profoundly. But after a few rounds of listening, this CD sounds as an eternal, 60+ min-long introduction that leads to nowhere.  No creative melodies, no \\"main themes\\", nothing that sticks into your brain, just a layer-after-layer-after-layer composition with no clear direction.  Where is the genius of \\"September 15th\\"? \\"Lone Jack\\", \\"Are you going with me\\"? \\"question and answer\\"?, even \\"imaginary day\\" and your previous works with Steve Reich? Where is the substance here, Pat? Am I missing something?  Lyle, I could barely feel you throughout this record!    You and other listeners may argue that I am not that smart to get the substance; fair enough. But I have been listening to Pat Metheny since 1980 and before then, many other, lengthy works such as \\"in a silent way\\", and \\"a love supreme\\" had made their way.  This is not Pat's \\"in a silent way\\" nor \\"a love supreme\\" either. With all due respct to all PMG listeners, go back 30 years in time so you can reflect a bit.
B000002I25|5.0|This first album by the Doors is truly one of rock's finest. This album includes one of the Doors most famous songs, and the song that got them the recognition they deserve, Light my fire. Most of the songs on this album are good old rock and roll songs, except for the Alabama song (whiskey bar) which the Doors got from a German opera and The End which is the Doors' acid song and The Crystal Ship which sounds more mournful and sad. The End was featured in Apocalypse Now. This is a must listen album with popular songs including: Break on Through, Alabama Song, Light my fire, and The End.
B0006B2A2E|1.0|Save your money - do not rent or buy the movie, and most definitely do not go a theatre and spend $10.  This movie is just plain awful.  What a waste of great actors.  Also, what a waste of my time spent watching it.  I could only get through about half of the movie before I shut it off.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|This album is a great summary of Hendrix's brief but amazing career. Although the album may seem front-loaded, many of his less well-known tracks are some of the best. Some of my favorites were Voodoo Child and the softer songs The Wind Cries Mary and Castles Made of Sand. I was intrigued by this album during my first listen, and have liked it more and more with each subsequent listen. Some very fine tracks are missing, but this is by far the best one-disc summary available. For anyone who likes Hendrix, or is even simply interested in his work. this is definitely a worthwhile buy.
B00005JMYI|2.0|I saw Anchorman in the theater and loved it. This, however, is not the same movie.  They took out one of my favorite lines (when \\"Brick\\" announced, 'Yeah, I ate a big red candle') and added several scenes that were pointlessly crude (the cat turd scene was especially disturbing).  They took a crass but funny movie and turned it into something only a second-grader (or someone with a second-grade mentality) would find funny. <br />Having said that, I'm still giving this movie two stars instead of one for the following reasons: <br />1. The teleprompter jokes ('I'm Ron Burgundy?' and 'Go f*** yourselves, San Diego.') <br />2. Tim Robbins's 'No commercials, no mercy!' line and the ensuing news-crew rumble <br />3. Christina Applegate. \\"Veronica'\\" deflection of the come-ons by \\"Champ\\" and \\"Brick\\" are hilarious, as is her reaction to \\"Brian's\\" Sex Panther cologne and her recovery from \\"Ron's\\" prank (getting the announcer to introduce her as \\"T*** McGee\\"). If only the movie were \\"Anchorwoman: The Legend of Veronica Corningstone\\" instead. <br />
B000002GK1|5.0|Badmotorfinger is definitely not Soundgarden's best work, but it's still a worthy title. This album does contain some filler, but it has enough good stuff to make it a worthwhile purchase. \\"Rusty Cage\\", \\"Outshined\\", and \\"Jesus Christ Pose\\" are what I would consider essential Soundgarden, and both \\"Searching with My Good Eye Closed\\" and \\"Somewhere\\" are eerie and mindbending, the best aspects of Soundgarden. Get Superunknown and Down on the Upside first, but if that's not enough, definitely pick this one up.
B00005LMBK|5.0|I love this CD. I dont listen to much music like this (more rock) but i love it. You wont be disappointed. And i cant wait to buy there new CDs. Groillaz is worth the money.
B000002P6R|5.0|This of course was the first studio album by the group following the tragic, but yet unsurprising death of drummer Keith Moon. I was remarkably pleased how well the group forged on without the bombastic batterie of Keith Moon. However, in stark contrast, Kenny Jones' more subdued and more coherent style opened doors for the other band members, especially John Entwistle, to show their own talent for solos. But nonetheless Keith's enigmatic, sometimes heretic drumming style is missed, not because of any lack of talent by Kenny, just because Keith was such an original...no other drummer can come close to his unpredictable-yet \\"fit so right style\\", except maybe E.L.P.'s Carl Palmer or Bill Bruford of the Yes/King Crimson fame.
B00000099Y|5.0|First of all, I'm not a real fan of metal, prog rock, industrial, or whatever you might label Tool if any of those labels even fit. Oddly enough, I would equate this band more with the experience of listening to jazz or classical than any standard \\"metal\\" band. Their sound is richly tectured and layered. Keenan's lyrics, while sometimes crass, are often poignant and always crammed with raw power and emotion. While my musical tastes have shifted over the years, this is an album I constantly find myself coming back to. 5 stars for this incredibly introspective album.
B000099T2L|1.0|Her album sucks. The ballads are long and boring. With the exception of \\"Crazy In Love\\" and \\"Baby Boy\\" the fast songs sucks, or are good and then just get boring. There are only four good songs on this CD. If you are going by the singles, save your money. The only thing good, is that I borrowed the album from my cousin, so I didn't waste my money. And too many of the songs sound alike.. it's just a boring, repetitive, put-you-to-sleep kind of album. It could be a lullaby, it's so boring.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|A sign of birlliance in any field, Metheny/Mays and the PMG has always had a unique capability to capture very complex ideas in a manner accessible to a large audience.  In that sense, this CD resembles much of what they have done before. <br /> <br />Again, they have often been able to paint a landscape of sound in which music takes place - nothing new here. <br /> <br />What is new here is the degree of the complexity.  Conceptual unity over something this grand is something to recognize as pointing to genius.  Conceptual unity is not merely weaving a theme in and out, though they do.  It is also not merely creating an atmosphere that is conducive to a musical intention, though that does exist here.  Rather, it is a certain sense that the music gels as a unity.  That something with so much diversity in tonal color, thematic material, variation, harmonic diversity, and affects can hang this well is simply amazing! <br /> <br />Not only that, but Metheny's guitar playing (esp. in part I, and the middle section of part II) has rarely been so heated.  There is a definite sense that he has a statement to make, musically and on the instrument - and he does it here with little pretension. <br /> <br />Thank you Pat - Can't wait to see you in Detroit!
B000002I27|5.0|This follow up to the first album really established the Doors as a force to be reckoned with back in the late 60's. Not only are the songs on this album great but i also love the cover on the album. In this album the songs are very psychedelic and groovy. This album also gives some of Jim's poetry some nice airtime with the little ditty Horse Latitudes, no instruments, just a bunch of people screaming in the background and banging on things while Jim does his thing, Cool! One of Jim's favorite songs is on this album, Love me two times (which was written by Robby Krieger). I highly recommend this album! Popular songs on this album include: Love me Two times, Moonlight drive, and People are Strange.
B00002ZMNV|5.0|Escucharon el cuento de una banda de rock tocando con una sinfonica??? Pues no es cuento!!! En una increible fusin de musica metal y clasica, este DVD es uno de los mejores que he visto. Muy buen sonido, la seleccin de canciones es excelente y los extras que trae son muy buenos(incluyendo la separacin que pods hacer de solo escuchar a la banda o solo a la sinfonica, yo recomiendo escuchar todo junto!!). Si queres explorar esta interesante fusin pues a comprarlo!!!
B000000OF6|5.0|Hey, if you ever wondered what's QUEEN all about, now it's time to find out. This compilation is great! One of the best compilations I have ever seen, and I know what I'm talking about. And one of the most complete ones, too. Of course, there is so much more about QUEEN than this, but this one pretty much sums it up. So, whether you're a real fan or you're just curious, this is the ultimate QUEEN album. A must have!
B0002MPU1K|3.0|I must agree with reviewer R. Cornell when he laments the wrong-headed, misdirected production of this second effort by the solidly talented Cincotti, whose spare, distinctive debut CD was an impressive, artful success. By comparison, this unfortunate, wayward, mixed bag leans much too heavily upon overproduction, sappy arrangements, and misguided material -- even though, as before, Cincotti's own songs offer some fresh respite. Both he and Michael Buble are clear winners vocally,  even if the latter seems determined to walk the safer path between his Sinatra warm-overs and more shallow contempo-pop fare. But Cincotti is a natural jazz talent (another reviewer's comparison with Nora Jones is merely superficial, and approaches insult), with much better piano chops than either his apparent musical mentor, Harry Connick, Jr., or Jones, and a real flair for songwriting. If genuine creativity and artful exploration is his interest -- as his New York-bred jazz talents deserve -- he should lose the commercial Phil Ramone 'treatment', and stay closer to the impressive debut CD which makes this one look pale and forgettable.  [Postscript: Sadly, after sampling Cincotti's later two efforts, \\"East of Angel Town' and 'Metropolis', it's clear that this uncommonly talented singer-pianist has chosen to 'go the other way' with his career. Perhaps that choice was made reluctantly, given the long wait between his ambivalent pop-leaning 2nd and totally co-opted 3rd albums (?). Whatever the case ('pop' culture and money obviously speak louder), the complete shift to 'pop' may make some younger knee-jerk listeners (and Nora Jones fans) happy; but it's a real loss for those of us veterans of music-as-art who looked forward to more of the uncommon creativity and sensitivity Cincotti displayed so impressively on his first CD.]
B00005OM4N|1.0|Anyone who needs to flash skin in order to make their music appealing (with little exception)doesn't have much talent to begin with, and Britney Spears is a perfect example of this. The prototype for all porno/pop stars and the goddess of countless logo sticks across America, her music is a by-product of an overhyped, over-sold, teen-obsessed culture. Although the song \\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\" has a danceable beat, the rest of the insipid whining that accompanies it doesn't justify this CD's purchase. Don't waste your time with this album.
0446310786|5.0|\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is a classic tale of a child's perspective as she comes to learn about the difficulty of choosing between doing what is right and doing what is easy. She grows through her own experiences and by observing her principaled father, who is a lawyer, struggle through a controversial trial in a small southern town.<br /><br />The writing here is fantastic, the lessons run deep and the story is engaging and keeps the pages turning.  Highly recommended.
B000002I2I|5.0|What immediately grabs your attention on this album is the crunching opener, Roadhouse Blues. The Doors were back, Rock 'n' Roll style. It is the best rocker on the album, but others are just as good like You Make Me Real, Peace Frog, Ship of Fools and Maggie McGill. What also hits you (but not as hard) is the gentle, haunting blues like Waiting for the Sun, Blue Sunday and Indian Summer. Still can't decide which is the best: their first, their last or this one. It's best if you enjoy all three of them as a whole.
B00008PW2D|5.0|Sex and the City is absolutely the best show ever made, no matter how long the seasons are.  This season revealed and resolved many issues, including Samantha finally getting rid of Richard, Carrie's newfound success, the intro of Berger, AND the intro of Harry.  It is vital to the completion of the series.  I have all seven dvds sets for the series, and I would pay for even a final episode (if it wasn't in the last half of the sixth), because it's that great.  You can't be a real fan without appreciation for this season, no matter how short it is or who is pregnant (and wearing funny clothes).  In fact, I think it's even funnier with SJP pregnant, because her outfits are more creative so they can hide her belly.
B0006399FS|5.0|I am not sure I can describe in words how great this album is. I would not consider myself a U2 fan but I have enjoyed alot of their music in the past. This album brings them to a brand new level in my book.<br /><br />If I were to comment on every song I would have something positive to say about each one. Orginal of the species WILL win best song of the year whenever it is allowed to compete. And quite frankly if the album does not win best album it will be a grave injustice.<br /><br />I know that once the reviews start coming in this album is going to go down in history as one of the greatest albums ever made.<br /><br />It has been a long time since I have heard an album where every song is a winner.<br /><br />BUY THIS ALBUM ASAP
B00006GFAB|4.0|This is a good way to get into KISS, or collect some of their more popular tracks without having to buy all of KISS's records.  There is not a weak point on this album, with the exception of the song \\"I Was Made For Loving You\\" which is either a hit or miss song depending on your tastes.  Every other song is very good, however, and the album features a nice mix of rocking tracks, with some love songs and ballads scattered throughout.  I definately recommend this to anybody that wants a starting point for listening to KISS's music, or wants to listen to some good, fun songs.
B000000W5L|5.0|This is one of the 'Stones best, but it would have been \\"the best\\" if it were a single album vice double. I hate to say this, but there are some average songs on this double LP, but the good ones are worth having. This is definitely better than their next two albums. (I also really can't make out much of any of the lyrics, even though that's pretty normal for the 'Stones anyways.)
B000001ESP|5.0|Rush, the Canadian trio with a drummer by the name of Neil Pert (spelling?) who is considered by some to even surpass the abilities of John Bonham, the most interesting and one of the most influential bassists/vocalist around in Geddy Lee, and Alex, a guitarist with great abilities as well. A band who has been around for 30 years, that alone is a great achievement. So why do they not get as much recognition as they deserve? Beats me. \\"Moving Pictures\\", the 1981 release is considered by many as their greatest recording. And I agree. You can't listen to a classic rock station all day and not hear \\"Tom Sawyer\\", or \\"Limelight\\". More heavy oriented songs like \\"Red Barchetta\\", \\"YYZ\\", and \\"The Camera Eye\\" gives everyone something to love about this album. A must have for any rock fan, and especially Rush fan. This is the recording that got me hooked to Rush, and will hook you too. It's great the band is still together and going strong, I missed the 30th anniversary tour though. Add this to your collection now!
B00006690G|1.0|The whole anger thing is getting old. Especially coming from a scrony little white dude. That hair, you look like \\"Pony Boy\\". Rappers are supposed to be \\"crunk\\", you're just annoying. I hope this Vanilla Ice phase ends soon along with his career.<br /><br />Eminem is an awful rapper who over glorifies himself in self idolizing lyrics, he went through three seperate personas before reaching this new super serious \\"I hate my mom\\" persona. He tries and make you feel sorry for his life. Boo hoo.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|It's about a guy named Napolean trying to get a date to the dance and to find love.It's weird but that's what makes it funny.I reccomend this movie to the people who know that when things get weird,they get weirder.Power to the people!YEAH!!!
B000063DFN|5.0|This album has Powerslave, Aces High, and 2 Minites to midnight, all great songs, especially the title track. <br /> <br />The cover arts pretty cool as well :) <br /> <br />As ive said in other reviews, maidens good songs are scattered around their albums and the greatest hits alubums dont do justice, so this is 1 album ur gonn a have to get if you want their best songs.
0609610570|4.0|I got a bit tired of Larry while reading this book. Having said this I think it is fair that he tries to cash in on the success he has obviously had with his management mantra \\"following through\\". It seems that he got very impressed with the results of digitisation and Six Sigma - but anyway, those mantras were probably very new and very impressive back when he sharpened his pencil and started to write the book. Nowadays it is hardly such a big revolution. <br />Well - I grew fond of the book anyway. Because even though his conclusions seem to be stating the obvious - it is sometimes hard to \\"walk the talk\\" in real life management. <br />I actually also bought the audio book and now I have it in my car. Every now and then I take out a chapter or two to get my \\"windscreen washed\\". Like the chapter - set clear goals and follow through. One can't say this too often in today's business climate. This is not an academic study but more a practical view of how things can get done - get executed. I was - if not inspired by theory - thrilled with the practical approach to execution described in the book. Great for sitting on a highway trying to get to work having heard the news already three times. <br />
B000002H33|5.0|From start to finish this albums blows almost any cd i own out of the water, songs like master of puppets and damage inc make this one of the best metallica albums and one of the best all around albums that will ever be made. <br /> <br />Best song: Master of Puppets
0887307396|4.0|To make a long review short - this is a great book. But reading it 6 years after it was first published makes it even more interesting. Many of the companies described in the book (Boeing) has had a hard struggle since then.  <br />As a former COO and now as an entreprenuer, the book is relevant and well written. It shares some amazing insight about the companies it evaluates and it brings on som very interesting conclutions. Being in sales I began shortly after reading this book to change my stock portfolio into companies that was run based on the same leadership mantras as the book describes. It is hard to get beyond the marketing story telling of such companies - but fact is my portfolio has never been better since I changed my investing paradigm. This review is not about investing - but trying to dig out the the conclutions of this book from the real world companies of today is truly interesting. I love it - I hope the visionaries will continously beat the pragmatists.
B000063DFQ|4.0|This albums not bad, but has 2 good songs, The trooper and Flight of Icarus. <br /> <br />The thing i find about maidne is all their good songs are scattered   from one cd to another, and the greatest hits albums dont have half the classics.. Quit a sin really but yeah, average album with a 1 classic(The trooper) and one OK song (Flight of Icarus)
6305603847|5.0|What more can be said that hasn't been said already? If you liked the album then definitely get the dvd. You'll never hear The Wall the same after you see this.
B000002H2H|5.0|This is 1 of the 3 best metallica albums (master of puppets, this and kill em all).  With fast rifts and beutiful ballads, this album does it all and does it exceptionally. <br /> <br />best songs: <br /> <br />Ride The lightning <br />Fade to black <br />For whom the bell tolls
1400032717|5.0|A good quick read that's a welcome change from the ordinary.  However, I could not help but noting one editorial error (maybe)?  When Christopher crosses the street he knows to look \\"left, right, then left again\\".  But this is England (cars drive on the left).  The story takes place in England and the author has an English address.  Wouldn't a native be taught to look right, left and then right?  This of course does not damage the story but it did interfere with my \\"reading zone\\".
0553296981|3.0|The hype for this book was really overwhelming. Whenever talking about the holocaust, this book comes up. Though a good book about growing up, it really has no insight into the holocaust. It's mostly just Anne writing about things most girls growing up write about. You know, liking boys, getting boobs, etc. But really, there's nothing to really make you sad about the holocaust. A much much better book is Night by Elie Wiesel. Yeah. Now that's a really powerful book. And I guess this is too, just not in the same way.
B00064MW6K|2.0|I havent written a review in quite awhile, but this poorly crafted feline fiasco complelled me to pull out the ole keyboard again.  Now, I really like Halle Berry, and she has made some fine films, this isnt one of them. Add this to the wasted talents of Benjamin Bratt and Sharon Stone and you have a complete waste of time. Not that it hasnt been tried before. We all remember Catwoman from the ole Batman and Robin series with the luscious Julie Newmar, that worked ok. Scroll down a few years to Michelle Pfeifer, in agan Batman, ok, not bad.  But somewhere between there and here something got terribly lost in translation.  The dialogue is cheesy, the plot weak, the wardrobe needs a makeover. Sorry, but I just couldnt find anything good to say about this one.
B00005JN0T|3.0|Being a big fan of the short stories it was always going to be difficult for me to really enjoy this film.   <br /> <br />The tone, plot, and characters of the film are wildly different from those of the more sedate and intelligent short stories. The only similarity between the two being the rather clever 3 laws of robotics. <br />That said, the film is still enjoyable in it's own right as an action sci-fi. The effects are excellent, the pace spot-on, and the vision of the future convincing (actually aided by the many shameless product placements). Will Smith did'nt really work for me as the lead, someone more brooding and less of an obvious 'hero' would have given the film more credibility. <br /> <br />Overall though, worth a watch.
B00004Z459|2.0|Linkin Park is a really bad band in my eyes. I've tried to like them but their music isn't good and the rap lyrics ruin it all for me.  <br />If you're thinking about buying this I'd STRONGLY suggest getting Slipknot's self-titled album instead, it has some rap but it's heavier, more intense, and the singing (or screaming if you will) is a lot better on Slipknot than it is on this album.
B00005JNEI|3.0|I watched this film last night, and having sympathy with many of Michael Moores views, I was expecting to enjoy it. I was in the end a little dissapointed. I felt the movie would have had a much stronger impact had it adopted a more neutral tone.   Michael Moore's self-righteous pushing of his own agenda quickly became irritating, clouding many of the issue's he raised. Anyone with a reasonable knowledge of world events will have noticed him being economical with the truth (e.g. the omission of Britain from the coallition) with the sole purpose of manipulating emotions. I found this a little rich considering his scathing attacks on the US government's fear promotion tactics.  Nonetheless, this is an important film. These issues needed to be raised, it's just a shame a greater focus was'nt place on the facts in hand rather than Moore's own anger.
1559408898|4.0|Generally I'm not a fan of the work of director Paul Verhoeven.  He seems to wallow in the decadent and take a bleak world-view, particularly as it pertains to the United States.  \\"Robocop\\" contains a number of Verhoeven's favorite themes but there are a number of redeeming features that elevates it above his normal fare.  First off, it is deliciously darkly comic.  The special effects and sound editing are superb.  Ronny Cox as a corporate shark and Kurtwood Smith as a hired thug give outstanding villainous turns.  What ultimately redeems this film, though, are the humane performances of Peter Weller as Alex Murphy a.k.a Robocop and Nancy Allen as his partner.  Weller in particular shines because he is not only called upon to act with heavy body armor on but also make his character sympathetic.  It is debatable whether \\"Robocop\\" is classic sci-fi but it is terrifically entertaining.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|Even though Avenged Sevenfold mellowed out a LITTLE on this album compared to sounding the seventh trumpet, it's for the better. This CD reminds me of Atreyu's debut cd only better. The vocals are WAY better than their last album. This cd's one of my favorites. My favorite songs are Unholy Confessions and I Won't See You Tonight Parts I and II.
0790729342|5.0|The summer of '82 I remember it well.  \\"E.T\\", \\"Wrath of Khan\\", \\"Poltergeist\\", \\"Blade Runner\\", \\"Annie\\"(heh-heh).  Why is it that this turbo charged import from down under has more resonance for me than these high-profile domestic releases?  I did see the original \\"Mad Max\\" on it's initial release in 1980.  It was a huge international success while it was a cult favorite here in the States.  I remember first hearing of \\"The Road Warrior\\"(or \\"Mad Max 2\\" as it was known outside North America) in a long piece in Time magazine in the spring of '82.  Time's critic hailed it as \\"Apocalypse!Pow!\\" and went on to rave about the film's virtues.  Later in the year he put it on the list of the ten best films which was no small feat.  I finally got around to seeing this film in August of that year as the bigger releases were winding down their runs.  To say I was blown away is an understatement.  \\"The Road Warrior\\" had energy and imagination to burn.  Director George Miller did with a fraction of the budget what other director's with bigger largesse could only dream of.  The film's basic premise, a group of post-apocalyptic survivors holed up in an oil refinery while rampaging hoards of leather-clad hoodlums hover outside looking for the smallest fissure to crack this fortress and take the \\"juice\\" is a compelling one.  The exodus of this band from the Outback to the promised land while the marauders attempt to hi-jack their trucks is viscerally exciting.  Throw in a burned-out mercenary anti-hero, Max(Mel Gibson), and you've got a classic on your hands.  One can marvel at this film and say that Miller has created an original work but his influences are subtle.  I can see him paying homage to Ford, Leone, and Kurasawa here.  What also distinguishes this film are the rich characterizations.  Aside from Gibson whose star was starting to grow with this film memorable performances are turned in by Bruce Spence as the Gyro Captain and young Emil Minty as the Feral Kid.  This film is generally hailed as an action classic but I say it's classic,period.
B000002P2V|4.0|WHO ARE YOU has many of the qualities people have come to expect from this band. Daltrey in great form, Townshend fighting back against the punk movement that had accused The Who of being behind the times, one of Entwistle's tried and true oddities and Moon's barely controlled fury. But there are a few flaws with here that keep it from standing with the band's best work. These flaws include an over reliance on synthesized sound that threatens to bury the purity of the band's performancesalong with tunes that are basically forgettable like \\"Music Must Change,\\" (Nice sentiment but tired tune) and \\"Sister Disco.\\" \\"Trick of the Light\\" would have been a lot better with Townshend's questioning vocals, rather than Daltrey's powerhouse that makes the lyrics less believable. that being said I really like this recording and the title track ranks with anything the band has done. The overall picture is a less than stellar effort, a good one but not a great one.
B000002J03|5.0|This is one of the best album of Led Zeppelin, and is a classic rock/psycodelic album in the world. <br /> I recommend to listen it with time. <br /> All tracks are great. In \\"Moby Dick\\"(8), John Bobham makes a great and imprssive drums solo, and it has a great Jimmy's riff when it starts and when finish the track. <br />  <br />
B000002KKS|5.0|This album is great, especially in the remastered   version. <br />The key element here is that whatever DIO  does, he OWNS !!! This man puts his mark on a song in a manner that few singers do ( I can only think of Freddy  Mercury and Robert Plant as people who also do this). <br />The song HEAVEN AND HELL is so clearly  the standout piece, that all else falls in line with this song. It's a great listen, but DIO  makes this album, not the rest of the band. <br />The radical  way a vocalist defines  Iommi's work can be seen in Tony's  solo  album , with many guest vocalists, including Ozzy, and it is with Ozzy that Iommi  sounds like the essential  Sabbath tone. <br />Anyways, well worth the price, and essential  album for any DIO   fan, as well as a nice  addition for any Sabbath fan, and since I am both, its a doubly good buy.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Hard to add to what's already been said about this album, but it truly is a fantastic album as a whole.  The story of St. Jimmy pulls the listener in and mesmerizes.  If I could give it 6 stars I would.  Green Day: I've been a passing fan of yours to this point, but you've got me hooked with this one.  It's going to be one of those albums still talked about in 10 or 20 years.  Green Day has grown up and is doing remarkable things...  can't wait to see them top this one.
B0006399FS|5.0|This is not a music review, and I acknowledge this is a bit off-topic. However, there have been so many negative comments directed at 'Corporate Bono', that I think it would be helpful to examine Bono's character a bit further. First, I want to say that I do not idolize Bono. He is not a superhero or messiah(gimme a break). I have been inspired by his words and actions from time to time, though. Of all the evidence given by other reviewers to his greed and power lust, I think the most damning is the very unfriendly U2.com site. But does that alone mean that Bono is evil? Let's look at it closer:    - U2 asked for $0 from Apple for the 'Vertigo' commercial.   Personally,I find it hilarious that some people see Apple as a big corporate bully. For the past TWENTY YEARS, Apple has been the 'alternative' and the 'champion of the people' in the personal computer market. Heck, U2 could even be applauded for helping out the little man (the 'big man' is Microsoft in case you don't know). I have a favorable view of Microsoft myself, but there are plenty of Mac-activists out there who make them out to be the devil incarnate.    - U2 were offered over $20 million dollars for the rights to use 'Streets' in a car commercial. Guess what? They didn't sell out (literally). They kept the song for themselves and their fans. Would a captilist pig do that?    - People who do good deeds to boost their ego usually brag about their accomplishments to anyone and everyone. I don't know Bono personally, so I can't say that he's not a braggart behind closed doors, but publicly, I can't recall ever reading a quote where he boasted of his good works. On the contrary, he frequently gives credit to others instead of himself. See the articles at [...]  stable/heart_america_map where Bono describes Agnes as the real hero of the tour.    - One reviewer said \\"U2 just promote selfishness and greedyness\\". Well, I've read the whole book that accompanies the Deluxe edition [...] and I haven't found that part yet. Again, ON THE CONTRARY, there are many handwritten (by Bono) anecdotes, short narratives, and prayers that present the EXACT OPPOSITE view. Fair trade is promoted (check out EDIN), there's a self-depracating drawing of Bono as a rat on the 'Mighty' page, he opens up on some of the harder moments in his life (death of his mother and father). He writes that the day after his mother died, \\"I lost nearly all my confidence...I've been trying to get it back ever since.\\" (Aside: Listen to 'Tomorrow'(Mom's death) and 'Sometimes'(Father's death) back to back, and then tell me that Bono is not an honest songwriter). He tells of his lifelong friend Guggi \\"sharing with me anything he had...he really taught me to share\\". I don't have a list of all the people that Bono has given money to (such a list would only prove that he does want attention for his philanthropy), but I believe he is a giving person because of his character. Just read his interviews/lyrics, watch concert videos, check out Bill Flanagan's \\"U2 at the End of the World\\", and you will see a much different picture than the one painted by the reviewer's who said Bono is \\"politically driven, too rich & famous, almost untouchable with a VIP status\\". Bono is the total opposite of 'untouchable'. Even though it may be \\"hard to get in the door\\"(he does attract a crowd), he seems to always value people as individuals (those are real people in the 'Peace on Earth' lyrics). One reviewer said that U2 gives 'fake interviews'. Well, I saw a very honest interview on MTV Europe recently, where the subject of death came up. When the journalist raised her sleeve to reveal a tatoo that she had gotten in memory of her mother, Bono got out of his seat, came over, and kissed the tatoo. If that sounds corny to you, it doesn't matter. The journalist was very moved by it, and that's the person with whom Bono was trying to communicate. He has a true gift when it comes to compassion and being able to express emotion (he has actuallyshouted \\"I love you, Adam Clayton!\\" while onstage).     - Bono has had meetings with and hung out with so many different people that it is foolish to try to say things like \\"He's in with George Bush\\" or \\"He's Oprah's buddy\\". Bono has had connections with people ranging from Bill Clinton and George Soros (one of the biggest Bush/conservative haters out there), to Dr. Dre and Sister Ann Carr (a nun, not a rapper), to Salman Rushdie and Bill Gates (the anti-Steve Jobs). Another important 'connection' in Bono's life has been his childhood sweetheart whom he's been married to for 21 years. And isn't it hard to believe that someone who smokes, drinks, and curses is admired and respected by evangelical Christians? How is that even possible? I suggest that people make INFORMED statements when it comes to personal matters. It appears that many reviewers have absolutely no idea of who Bono really is. I  understand that Bono has faults, but this site really needed someone to describe his good points also. I'm glad I could oblige.
0425170349|5.0|Tom Clancy rainbow six was one of the greatest and most memorable books I have ever read.  Hi my name is Master C and for the following I will explain to you why I enjoyed this book.  First off there is the main characters consisting of John Clark, Domingo Chavez, Ding, and Alistair Stanley.  Firstly I liked this book because they are always either off doing some mission or they are getting ready for a mission or even reflecting on how good they did on their last mission, and personally that's what kind of stuff I would enjoy doing any time of the week.  Even when they are not on a mission they are always involved in a action and dangerous situation.  They are always getting ready for missions by practicing and practicing, practice makes perfect that's what I always say.  I also like it because they always are traveling places like Switzerland and Germany, and Russia and by the sounds of it they are not there for a holiday it is serious mission involved trips.  I also liked it because when they are doing their missions they don't just storm in there and try and kill as many people as they can without dying.  They have lot of pre mission practice and when they get there they wait in till they now the coast is clear and then they throw bombs (non-explosive off cause) to either blind them or make them delusional so they can not react to the special forces flooding in and securing the area.  Finally I liked this book because it was not just all fighting and killing it was also like real life situations that either us or some one we now has been in, so I kind of connected with the book in that way.
0380002930|4.0|I was first introduced to this book in seventh grade.  We referred to it as the dreaded, hated, despised bunny book.  I was much too young to even begin to understand the deaper meanings of this book or to appreciate it in the least bit.  I have now revisited it as an adult.  It's as if the light bulb came on.  It all makes sense to me now.   <br /> <br />Richard Adams does an amazing job of explaining the inner workings of the rabbit world.  You learn new vocabulary and begin to appreciate the complexity of nature (Yes I know it's ficiton, but for a second you can almost imagine this is all real, and that's the beauty of the book.)  This is another one of those books that just because you are capable of reading the words does not mean you are capable of understanding the book.  This should not be read to seventh graders or junior high for that matter unless you are an excpetional teacher and/or have exceptional students.
B0006A9FKA|4.0|A quirky \\"black\\" comedy, but very British.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|It's unusual for a sophomore record to be better than a first album, but this one certainly is. While some songs are better than others (they get stronger toward the end), all are entertaining, listenable, and first-rate. Wonderful songwriting and incredible production with hints of '50s-era popular jazz and, yes, the Beatles (Fast As You Can, Paper Bag). Apple has a lovely voice that will only get better with age, and Jon Brion is a genius. The use of a variety of traditional instruments rather than synthesizers is refreshing. Now if we could only get Extraordinary Machine...
B0006213WG|5.0|If \\"Does This Look Infected?\\" was a foreshadowing of the great music that was to come from this Canadian punk band, then \\"Chuck\\" could arguably be the fulfillment of all their hardwork to perfect this recently-found \\"pop-punk-meets-metal\\" formula. This is the album that they should've named \\"All Killer, No Filler\\" because that is exactly what it is. Buy it now.
B00005JNEW|4.0|I attended Permian. I graduated in 1995 and can tell everyone for sure this is an honest film. The pressure put on these football players is astonishing.<br /><br />This movie shows real grit the way I saw it walking down the halls of school. The shame felt after a loss and the victory and chanting down the halls after a win.<br /><br />The movie does an excellent job at showing life in Odessa, TX.
B00004ZAV3|1.0|Not sure why this is out now, except for the record company to make money.  Good music, recorded 40 yrs ago.
B00005JNEI|5.0|This is a film everyone should watch. Like another reviewer mentioned, it seems to only be the patriotic (and maybe rather naive) Americans who object to this film.     They cant see that their leader is a terrorist himself. I think Michael Moore did a fabulous job with the film, and presented all the FACTS. He didn't make any of it up, he should it for how it is. Of course it was made to represent Michael's point of view, but that can't take away from that fact that nothing in this film is a lie.     This is indeed a shocking film, and includes very graphic scenes of war. I think he did need to show this though, as so many people turn a blind eye to the poor victims of war.    (...)    Good job Michael, just a shame more Americans didn't watch and believe in your great educational film.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Led Zeppelin was the greatest band of all time, and this DVD surely proves it.
B0000VD04M|5.0|Thusly, Orson Welles (possably the greatest director of all time) sends Edward D. Wood Jr. (possably the worst directer of all time) into the world to make his mark. <br /> <br />The fact that this exchange between the two film-makers probably never took place, is irrelevent. This is a story about blind enthusiasm, not talent, and it is told with unlimited talent by Tim Burton. <br /> <br />There is not much I can say about this film, that has not been said by my 5star colleagues. I would only like to stress that this is a story of the heart. Those who love it tend to be a bit more sentamental than those who do not. <br /> <br />What keeps me coming back to this film is the friendship that develops through the arc of the story between Bela Lugosi and Ed Wood. It's the heart and soul of the experience. Everything else that has been knitted together to form this movie is of the highest caliber and could not have been improved upon, but if you miss the emotional cruxt of this truly magnificent experience you probably won't return to it as so many of us have, so very often. <br /> <br />A movie that will only increase in prestige over the next fifty years, forget about intelligence, and embrace the niave, with Ed Wood!
B00005JNEI|1.0|If all the facts were public regarding what has happened in our world, information which you will never see from our jaded media, the election would have been a landslide and Moore would have been nothing more than a blip on our screen.    I have found as a rule if you want to know how to live your life or you are in search of truth... observe the direction of Hollywood and take an alternate route.
B0006399FS|1.0|The music and songs are really bland. <br /> <br />Awful, terrible album. <br /> <br />the \\"real\\" U2 is dead. <br /> <br />Last \\"actual\\" release by U2 - \\"POP\\" <br /> <br /> <br />
B0006399FS|1.0|I noticed you mentioned that the people who have given this one star reviews are people who   like easily accessible, popular, commericalised music.....which is certainly not the case, as that is exactly what this piece  of a [...] of an album is.    Have'nt you noticed the one star reviewers are praising \\"POP\\" U2s most disliked record by many cause its not very accessible, and was actually a commercial disastor (thanking god)    This album is just unbearable, Vertigo, is the most commercialized sounding song I have ever heard, and sounds designed to sell records.    U2 should NOT go on tour with this album, they should record a     new album and say sorry to everyone who likes actual music and a band who writes actual rock n roll guitar tunes and who mean it - instead of selling themselves and looking lame on a IPOD commercial.

B00006RU5B|1.0|To fancy, to mainstream, to unrealistic. <br /> <br />Bring back Rage Against The Machine, and make one more Soundgarden record - please. <br /> <br />Or they are serious, their next one will be a proper album that sounds \\"real\\" and not just that awful sound of \\"wanting to sell records!\\"
B000001EAQ|5.0|Where do you start. <br />Very diverse album, not one song alike. <br />U2 reinvented themselves with this album and they sound just brilliant. <br />U2s last great album. <br /> <br />

B0006M4SO6|4.0|You could criticize this CD on a number of fronts, and most would be valid, but still I find it to be a captivating disc. Yes, PMG recycles some themes from previous recordings, but so did Miles, Diz, Trane, and countless others. The point is that reworked in a larger context, they have a renewed energy and direction, like turning a diamond to capture the light in a different way. I'm not sure how the track breaks were decided, and there is a sense of arbitrariness to this element, yet I found myself really paying no heed to the breaks. In fact, the whole is so much more than the sum of its parts, that you just have to get past it and let the music stand on its own. <br />It stands up much better than SPEAKING OF NOW. The personnel are essentially Metheny, Mays, Rodby and Sanchez. Cuong Vu, Richard Bona and the Swiss guy are along for some texture, but this is really a guitar disc with keyboards, bass and drums and it plays to Metheny's strengths: soundscapes that suggest the urban and the pastoral. There is a lot less of the global element in this disc, and to my ears, the main quartet still seems to close ranks from letting protean talents like Vu or Bona move the music away from the PMG trademark. There are no soaring vocals on this disc, and I for one applaud that. That was getting as irritating as Jarrets' grunts. Instead, you have four extended improvisations, or semi-improvisations, that will live with you. <br />Any hummable tunes? No. A logical catharsis? Nope. A little to avant-smooth? Maybe. But it is for PMG a more concrete way to begin again. I know I'll return to this disc a lot, especially when I need to concentrate, for it does inspire concentration. This is not his best, but it is a very fine effort and raises the question more inescapably, where is PMG going in its upward trajectory?
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This bands music is brilliant and amazing. <br />Need I say more. <br /> <br />Much better than Tool, although their new album may prove that statement to be wrong.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|I love the types of movies that keep me on the edge of my seat throughout, and this one definitely did.  There are so many twists and turns throughout the movie that it'll make you dizzy!   <br /> <br />Cruise was good as the bad-ass hitman Vincent (not his best acting job though) and I absolutely loved Jamie Foxx's portrayal of the honest cabbie Max.  I think my favorite part of the movie was when Max slowed down to let the coyotes cross the street.  It cleverly showed just how different these two men are from each other. <br />   <br />The only problem that I had with the movie was that the last \\"hit\\" that Vincent needed to accomplish was pretty predictable, but other than that, it was an excellent movie.  I'm just disappointed that I didn't go see it when it was in theaters!

1592400876|3.0|If nothing else, this book simply makes one think about preserving the English language by implementing, at the very least, the fundamentals of grammar.  There is no need to take it as personal as the writer, nor brush it off as a useless writing guide.  Not everyone owns Simon & Schuster's Handbook for Writers.  If this is the book that people pick-up, and it helps improve their writing, so be it.  Every little bit helps. <br /> <br />As for the many reviews citing the \\"British humor,\\" it is far less a regional humor as it a smarter type of humor.  Humor that doesn't slap you in the face with its boldness.  Humor that makes you think and laugh.  Humor that satisfies you for \\"getting\\" it.  It is a unskilled mind that needs even a laugh handed to them.

0440234743|5.0|In the midst of the fast-paced world of litigation, this book provides us with a glimpse into a less cluttered, more serene lifestyle where none of the former matters.  The main character's life is transformed by his contact with a young woman whose simple, selfless existence is in direct contrast to his own.  John Grisham has a definite talent in making the reader feel as though he wishes that he knew the characters personally.  This book is one of my personal favorites.

B00006LLNU|5.0|I am addicted to music - this much anyone who knows me can confirm. I own hundreds of cds and always have my ears and mind in something; listening for a novel combinations of sounds and efforts, or reviewing past successes and preserving their respective talents. <br />This all being said, I don't know if I will *ever* come across an album this incredible in my lifetime. <br /> <br />For those familiar with ( ), try recommending it to a friend. The raw facts of this album are difficult for most to overcome (e.g. there are only 8 songs, the shortest song is 6:30, there are no real lyrics as everything you hear is spontaneous vocalization, not a single word is printed on the disc or in the disc jacket...). But how would you describe the sound? A short list of fitting adjectives that span numerous points on the disc: dynamic, mesmerizing, passionate, climactic, elegant, bleak, explosive, imaginative, lush, vibrant, heartbreaking, resonant... <br /> <br />Do I have your attention now? <br /> <br />( ) is a masterpiece in its ability to paint a luscious, beautiful soundscape. Many reviews equate it to the diversity and endlessness of a calm winter's night, but even this is limiting. This album is so incredibly deep that you can listen as closely as possible, and still fall in love with the intricacies you will find. Without wasting a second of your time (an amazing feat to have it persist for 70+ minutes), Sigur Rs take you on an aural adventure. <br /> <br />In other reviews, you will read about the equal division of the album into the 'positive' half (tracks 1-4) and the 'negative' half (5-8), reinforced by the 30 seconds of intentional silence in between. You will read about the invention of \\"Hoplandic\\" (pronounced hope-landic), the fictitious language created for this album, a derivative of proper Icelandic. You will read about the post facto titles for the songs, the material's debut in Cameron Crowe's \\"Vanilla Sky\\", and the creativity behind some of the instrumentation. <br />In my review, I won't hold your hand and walk you through each track, telling you what you're going to hear, because different listeners focus on different elements. I won't try to be as articulate as I can hope to be in an effort to verbally capture its musical elements, partly because I don't think it can be done. I won't rate each song on a scale from 1-10, because this album is synergistic, in that to isolate a piece compromises and belittles the whole. But, I will tell you what you might find in exchange for one trip to your cd store and a measly $15: <br />It will fill your soul in ways you find comforting and unsettling. It will break down listening barriers with the use of the human voice as a purely musical instrument. It will extend beyond your comprehension the ability to translate emotion into music without any lyrics. It will generate mental imagery more vivid and resonant than any other music can. To be crudely simple, it will blow your mind, even after the hundredth listen. <br />  <br />Give this album your undivided attention, from start to finish - perhaps in the middle of the night, perhaps amidst a long drive or walk, or even perhaps in your living room with just a candle lit. Turn off your eyes and let your ears take over; let ( ) take you on a true journey at whose conclusion leaves you to open your eyes and struggle to comprehend just how much this one disc is.
B00000K0DQ|5.0|That's the penitent outcry of a hard-boiled criminal awaiting the chair.<br /><br />No mean feat to make such a heartfelt film on a sensitive subject (capital punishment, with religious undertones) without being preachy or lopsided. I can think of several movies that have reached for similar heights (Life of David Gale, Rampage, Vigilante) but Dead Man Walking is probably the only one that pulls it off with so much sanity and compassion.<br /><br />Our protagonist (Sean Penn in probably the role of his life, other than Mystic River) is on his final leg on death row for an allegedly racially-instigated rape and murder of a young woman and her boyfriend. Sister Helen (Sarandon) is a nun called upon to console and befriend the man in hopes to evoke remorse for his dastardly act, and hence redemption according to the Catholic faith.<br /><br />Doing thus, she soon becomes the viewers' eyes; we see events as she experiences them, facts revealed as she discovers them. She visits not only the callous inmate but also his victims' families. Interacting with them takes her into their world, which she finds is seething with anger.<br /><br />We understand this of course given the gravity of the crime, but this is where the script excels, it's not a strident, single-minded indictment of a murderer. The raped girl's family are a loving folk yet viciously spiteful of the rapist, with a near-maniacal thirst for revenge. At one point, the father shrieks, \\"I could kill the beast with my own bare hands.\\" Lines blur here about who the \\"beast\\" is.<br /><br />Sarandon and Penn won their deserved accolades but the true winner here is the story for showing us the harrowing realities of executions. The dialogue is subtly witty and has interesting takes on big issues. At one stage, a prison guard says to a nun, \\"You know what the bible says, an eye for an eye\\". The nun says, \\" You know what else the Bible ask for death as a punishment? For adultery, prostitution, homosexuality, trespass upon sacred grounds, profane in a sabbath and contempt to parents.\\" An educated nun with an open mind. Truly refreshing.<br /><br />The film is unequivocal in its position on the death penalty (against it), but never forces it. Pro-death penalty folks will hardly change their mind after this film, but it won't drive them screaming from the theater either. It may not be for everyone, but it has its heart and head in the right place.<br /><br />Very, very moving, thought-provoking stuff. A copy of this DVD belongs in every sensible library.n sacred grounds, profane in a sabbath and contempt to parents.\\" An educated nun with an open mind.

0930289455|1.0|Yesterday I gave this trade paperback a second read, and I can't say it changed my first impressions. As a Bat-fan, I picked up the book because it contains an important moment in Bat history, central to the story of a character I care about. /Batman: The Killing Joke/ is the storyline in which the Joker paralyzed Barbara Gordon, former Batgirl -- a constraint that eventually led to her becoming &uuml;berdecker to the hero world, Oracle.<br /><br />I've bought some fairly cheesy trade paperbacks in the name of Bat history lessons -- /Batman: A Lonely Place of Dying/, for example, is the story of how Tim Drake becomes Robin, and it's dripping with cheese and earnestness. I can cope with cheese (see my enjoyment of 70's X-Men) but there's something about /The Killing Joke/ that really rubs me the wrong way. It was written by Alan Moore, one of the two \\"dark\\" writers of the 80's, who shocked the comics world out of its idyllic 70's fluff and into grittiness. The other was Frank Miller. And while it's obvious that Frank Miller has dark thoughts and muses far too much on sex with Wonder Woman, it's equally obvious that Frank Miller loves superhero comics. Alan Moore, I have read and I now believe, hates superhero comics.<br /><br />I omit my summary of the plot of the book, out of respect for Amazon's no-spoiler guidlines, but you aren't missing much; a linear plot with no real twists or surprises, or acts of astounding intelligence or fortitude by our hero. The only thing that enlivens the very twistless story is the counterpoint of a possible creation story for the Joker, where he's a loser stand-up artist who can't get a gig, tries one night of crime to support his pregnant wife, etc. The creation story is a little more interesting than the rest of it, but it's a little more set in stone, a little more definitive, then I've ever seen DC let anyone do for a Joker story. He's SUPPOSED to be mysterious -- an image of the madness that can be birthed without reason from man. Except for \\"he fell in a chemical vat\\", there is no bottom line on this man, and this weak explanatory backstory detracts from the Joker mythos, it doesn't add to it.<br /><br />The story lacks emotional punch where it needs it -- the crippling of a major ongoing character, for heaven's sake, and Gordon finding the resolve not to snap in the face of this 'sophisticated' psychological torture -- and, in fact, seems emotionally illogical. Gordon doesn't ask Batman whether Babs is ALIVE when he's rescued. The fiercely protective Batman, after never laughing at a single thing the Joker has ever said (I mean, that's part of why Mr. J hates him!), laughs at a mediocre joke he tells after nearly killing Batgirl. Are these human beings? Flatly, no they aren't. They're mouthpieces for Moore's shallow conceits -- \\"one bad day makes people insane, in different ways,\\" and \\"the world is so awful you just have to laugh\\" -- and the only thing they show any commitment to is disputing those overblown theories.<br /><br />On top of that, the story makes no LOGICAL sense, something I am more than happy to overlook in a comic book, provided something else -- emotional punch or comedic value -- fills the void. Who was the guy in the Joker suit in Arkham? Where did the Joker get the money to buy the amusement park, or, for that matter, to outfit it with vast flat-screen displays and deadly traps within a few days? Where did the Joker find so many sideshow freaks who like to hurt people? And finally, when did bondage dwarf minions  become part of Joker's schtick? Joker is, Jack Nicholson aside, an asexual villain (please see Harley Quinn's sexual frustration for details.) Stripping Babs for the pictures, naked Gordon leashed by bondage minions, et cetera, are Alan Moore saying, \\"Ooh, I'm so BAD!\\" NOT anything the Joker would do.<br /><br />In short, I do believe Alan Moore hates superhero comics. And as Lana said on Smallville once, \\"If you hate your job so much, why don't you just quit?\\"<br /><br />Bottom line:<br /><br />Pretentiously \\"meaningful\\" and pretentiously dark, not to mention painfully 80's. Characterization shallow and perfunctory, story trite and unexciting. Pictures okay -- a few very good Joker portraits.
B0006IIPIK|4.0|This is an extremely anachronistic yarn that reminds me of a Guy Maddin movie for two reasons.<br /><br />It borrows the colors, camera angles, whipes, dissolves, designs and tone of an old German expressionist movie and it also seems to be specifically for people who love film and can identify the homages being paid here. I'm not sure why they did it, exactly, but I'm glad they did and I'm glad they dove in, unapologetically, and made this beautifully artificial machine that has heaps of heart and humor, even if the heart exists entirely in binary code.<br /><br />\\"Sky Captain\\" also pays great nods to the old Superman matinee cartoons, Orson Welles and both \\"Indiana Jones\\" and the myriad influences that made Indy possible in the first place.<br /><br />A strange and wonderful experiment that won't be for everyone but that manages to outweigh its indulgence with sheer stylistic audacity. Oh, and it's also a lot of fun.
B00020HEG6|5.0|Out of the 5 nominees, this is the one that could really give Finding Neverland a run for its money. John Williams scored excellently for Harry Potter and the Philosopher/Sorcerer's Stone; dipped a little on Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets but has come up with his best ever effort for the Harry Potter chain of movies in the score to Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. <br /> <br />Everything good and memorable that John Williams first created from Stone is found here, in some form or another and that really sets the scene for everything else to happen. It's almost like how JK Rowling reminds us each time the book starts that it was summer and Harry's at his uncle's place waiting to come back to Hogwards. It readies us for what next to come.  <br /> <br />The musical palate is so diverse here. Indeed, Double Trouble stands out so much because it pictures Hogwarts and the Marauder Map so well; you feel that you're part of the mischieve making. The piece evokes a sense of ancient-ness. Knight Bus is the odd one out of the entire score - but purposefully so. It fits the movie scene perfectly. As Steven Spielberg so aptly wrote in the CD booklet of the Artificial Intelligence CD booklet, John Williams truly is a master storyteller with his music. Listening to the score reminds you of everything from the movie. <br /> <br />If you loved the movie, then I'm pretty sure you would have already bought the soundtrack. If you like good scores, then get this CD too. The music is expressive, interesting, lively and just so good. <br /> <br />
B000021Y77|5.0|The teaser for this film is that, every second of every day, you come across a choice that can change your life. Tom Tykwer's film appears to show that, rather than the main protagonists making alternative decisions the whole time, their actions are more or less governed not just by other people's decisions and actions, but also by the timing of those decisions or actions.    The plot centres around the girlfriend, Lola (Franka Potente), of a would-be gangster, Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu), who has to come up with a way of grabbing a whopping 100,000 marks (this was in the pre-euro days!) in just 20 minutes, otherwise the do-not-trust-anyone head of the mob, Ronnie (Heino Ferch), may do unspeakable things to him, if not give him a quick headbutt as he did for keeping a packet of fags from him once.    One particular event, the theft of Lola's moped (shown as a flashback in monochrome), starts a chain of events, which will either see Ronnie get his money successfully or else see other outcomes. As a result, Manni, speaking in a desperate tone of voice from a phone booth, tells Lola that he will rob the nearest supermarket if she does not come within 20 minutes, preferably with the money.    Three alternate scenarios, with three very different outcomes, are played out during this film, all of which are accompanied by a thumping, racing soundtrack composed by Reinhold Heil, Johnny Klimek and director Tom Tykwer, as Lola runs, firstly, to a bank where her father (Herbert Knaup) just happens to be the bank manager, and lastly arrives at the intersection, where the phone booth and the supermarket are, by one means or another.    Lola encounters characters who recur throughout the film, including Jutta Hansen (Nina Petri), who is Lola's father's mistress, Herr Schuster (Armin Rohde), who is the security guard at the bank, an old lady pushing a pram, whom Lola almost crashes into at exactly the same spot during her headlong dash to the bank, a young man who wants to sell her abike he stole, and the tramp who managed to get hold of Manni's plastic bag containing the money he was given from the deal, which he had accidentally left on a Berlin subway train in panic at seeing two inspectors come into the car.    Only one scene out of all three scenarios remains precisely the same, namely that of Lola's mother talking to a married man on the phone when Lola runs out of the flat at the start of the 20 minutes needed to get the money. Franka Potente is spared running down flights of stairs in the apartment building via the substitution of animation, first seen on Lola's mother's TV and then seen as part of the main story, although we do see (the live-action) Lola lying at the bottom of the stairs at one point after being deliberately tripped over by a young boy wearing a baseball cap, albeit in animation only.    Not in any particular order, the scenarios include a bank robbery, a supermarket robbery, the same two cars involved in crashes, the moped thief crashing, Lola screaming, Lola almost being run over by an ambulance, Manni being actually run over by the same ambulance, the ambulance narrowly avoiding a huge piece of glass, the ambulance smashing the glass to smithereens, Lola being shot by a police officer, Lola doing her nut in her father's office, Lola being told to get away from the bank by an armed police response team, the security guard having heart problems ... and, as for the money, I will not say!    Also, the characters of the old lady pushing the pram and the guy on the bicycle are shown in still \\"flash forward\\" pictures in rapid succession, accompanied on the soundtrack by the sound of a camera warming up before a flash picture is taken. Though they are minor characters, they are just as much affected by alternative events and outcomes as anybody else, so this is quite an interesting technique to show what happens to these people in the space of a few seconds of film running time.    If you want to know which events come where, you will have to see this imaginative movie, which also contains two scenes where Lola and Manni are alone together, discussing how they really feel towards each other and what they would really do if particular situations were to occur. Each scene follows each of the first two scenarios and, though not at all action scenes with any music, they serve to help the audience realize that even the best of relationships may not be as solid as one might think at first.    Tykwer has crafted a film that focuses very much on fate, not just determining one's own, but also having it determined by other people and events, both predictable and unpredictable. This is very much Franka Potente's movie, since it was the one which catapulted her to worldwide fame and a bourgeoning career as a Hollywood actress. I have heard both British English and American English soundtracks (as well as the original German!) yet only the DVD with the American English soundtrack also has the English commentary on the film by Potente and Tykwer. Here, Potente reveals that, one evening when it looked like it might rain, she had gone to a bar and met Tykwer, who would eventually cast her as Lola. Had it been raining that evening, she admits she might never have gone to that bar in the first place, so she never would have met Tykwer, so he never would have cast her as Lola, so she might never have eventually become famous and gone to Hollywood. Life imitating art, indeed!

0385659806|5.0|Such an intelligent book! So clever! I started reading it and was instantly grinning and laughing! And then I started realizing how much the author knew its subject and was a sensible person. It became a fascinating trip into the different mind of a different person, an autistic child. Halfway through the book, I could just not leave it, especially with the little surprise encountered at page... But I'll leave that for you to discover!
0140177396|5.0|This book is really great. I really enjoyed reading it. It really showed true friendship between the main characters George and Lennie. Even thought they were different in many aspects. George being the \\"normal\\" one... as for Lennie being mentally handicapped. Lennie even thought being mentally handicaped obeyed George and had great respect for him. And even thought as George had short temper he still managed to control himself and see that Lennie really needs him. As for the case of when Lennie killed the girl, George helped him run away and end his suffering by shooting him behind the head. But George new Lennie was a great guy, not to be a killer. As he, George, said to Lennie on his last moments \\"think about the rabbits\\"... so we now know Lennie died in peace, thinking about his farm full of rabbits.  <br /> <br />   I really recommend this book to anyone who wishes to read about a great friendship. Even though these guys were poor and low classed and had nothing to live for, they still had hope. They still had dreams of one day having/owning a farm of their own. This book is really touching and its great to read. So if your thinking about reading a good book in the future... you should read Of Mice and Men.  <br /> <br />
0385473788|4.0|I was struck by the many remarks that this book was not a good \\"holocaust book\\". I think that depends on what you characterise as a \\"holocaust book\\".<br /><br />If you are looking for stories of concentration camps, and people dying etc., then the Diary of Anne Frank is not the book you should read.<br /><br />It is however one of the very few original accounts of life in an occupied country for a child of a minority that was hunted down. Nowadays hardly anyone will be able to understand what that was like. What this diary shows so perfectly is that life indeed does go on, also in occupied territory and even in hiding. But it also shows the ghost of fear that is present in every aspect of that life and not knowing when it might end.<br /><br />Because the diary from which springs this definitive edition was not written with the intention to be read, it may be less 'readable' than other books on the war, or the holocaust. It is therefore all the more important to appreciate it for what it is: true life through the eye of the author.<br /><br />I sincerely hope that young people reading this book do not underestimate the hardships in the annex, as not \\"being really holocaust\\". Until you have read this book and/or have visited the annex, imagining yourself sitting there for two years with people you love and hate, you cannot possibly imagine what life for jews in the occupied countries was really like.
B00005JLRT|1.0|I'm a huge Star Trek: The Next Generation fan.  That said, this movie is just about unwatchable.  The plot doesn't make any sense and it's just bad.  Bad bad bad.  Horrible.  Blech!
B000002552|5.0|I love this collection because you hear 2 things going on, Bob in a transition and The Band coming out from behind his shadow.  <br /> <br />This is a great one for Band fans to own if you loved \\"Songs from Big Pink\\" as well as people curious to hear Bob transitioning from the urgency of \\"Blonde on Blonde\\" into the more laid back \\"John Wesley Harding\\". I'm sure back in '67 the change was far more jarring to Dylan fans who had just started warming up to his rock sound and then \\"going country\\" (although country was already in Dylan's blood).   <br /> <br />I think this release was a \\"beat the boots\\" campaign to try to squash \\"The Great White Wonder\\" which is considered one of the first rock bootleg records ever. Since then, there have been 3-5 hours' worth of \\"Genuine Basement Tapes\\" outtakes as well (ask a Dylanologist or search engine it). In Dylan's \\"Bootleg Series\\" he did 3 volumes of outtakes and 3 volumes of outstanding live performances from different eras, hopefully #7 will finally satisfy longtime Dylan and Band fans alike, but because \\"Basement Tapes\\" is a classic in its own right, is an essential recording worthy of 5 stars, I doubt that people will brush this one aside anytime soon.  <br /> <br />
1400043662|4.0|What a wild ride this bewildering, almost maddening novel is, and what an intensely creative talent author Haruki Murakami shows here. Make no mistake, this book is a challenge to read unless you are open to mystical characters, supernatural phenomena and a willingness to avoid basic story conventions. The basic outline of the plot will give you some idea. Two main characters drive the story. The first is fifteen-year-old Kafka Tamura, who runs away from his Tokyo home. He is burdened by his father's dire prophecy that Kafka, like Oedipus, would eventually kill him and sleep with his mother and sister, both of whom fled the family home when Kafka was four. He stays alone in a cheap hotel, and after a blackout period, ends up at a shrine with no memory of the last few hours or how his clothes came to be saturated in blood. The second character is Mr. Nakata, a man in his 70s who lives near the Tamura household in Tokyo. He supplements his welfare subsidy by tracing lost cats, and his success rate is excellent because he can, literally, talk to cats. On the surface, Nakata is a simpleton, unable to read or write, since his memory has been wiped out during WWII by a paranormal incident in the local woods.<br /><br />Both Kafka and Nakata find themselves in the middle of incomprehensible, sometimes shocking events. In fact, their parallel quests eventually merge, as Nakata feels his way toward realizing his destiny, which is entwined with those of not only Kafka but also Miss Saeki, a fiftyish library director whom Kafka meets on his journey, and get this, the ghost of her at age fifteen. In certain ways, the book is a primer on existentialism, but Murakami does not weigh down his story with heavy, complex arguments about the universe. Instead, he uses his surreal writing style as a means to get to the heart of a poignant question posed by Kafka, who never got over being abandoned by his mother and continues to wonder if being alone means being free. The journey that both Kafka and Nakata take is purposeful, though marred at times by Murakami's intentional excesses, such as bringing to life such advertising images as Johnnie Walker and Colonel Sanders to play pivotal plot devices. That's when the author's stylized world becomes rather contrived and the narrative even more convoluted as a result. Regardless, it's a powerful read overall for those willing to take this wild toad of a metaphysical ride.and Nakata take is purposeful, though marred at times by Murakami's intentional excesses, such as bringing to life such advertising images as Johnnie Walker and Colonel Sanders to play pivotal plot devices.

B0002S943O|3.0|Being a true Depeche Mode fan and having seen all their concerts since \\"Music for the Masses\\" I was excited to find out about this Devotional DVD and promptly bought it.  I think the album \\"Songs of Faith and Devotion\\" shows the darker side of Dave and this truly reflected on his stage presence during this concert.  Although the visual of the concert footage is stunning, I was very disapointed with the audio and video synch.  Being a musician myself, I hate to see a concert where the drummer (Alan Wilder) pounds away and there is an obvious delay between the beat you see and the beat you hear... This is very dommage... <br /> <br />
B0006M4SO6|5.0|I had to listen to this disc a few times before I 'got it'. The way Metheny/Mays allow the themes to creep through all the different changes is what stitches the whole thing together for me. Sure, they've been heard before, but not at this level of complexity. To hear musicians play/compose at this level is an absolute dream. What a celebration of humanity. I can't wait to hear this live.
6303430570|5.0|Kevin Smith directed this low budget comedy about a 22 year-old that dosen't like to work at a convenience store and meets weird people and has an obnoxious friend that works at a video store. Director Smith directed this movie on a low budget and it is filmed in b&w and has an unknown cast and filmed completely in a convenience stor and movie store. The funniest parts in this hilarious movie are when the gum seller makes the customers think twice about getting cigarettes and the dialogue is funny. the new 3 disc DVD is a must for fans of the classic with a restored picture and better sound. the picture looks clean with no grain and looks better than the old VHS and DVD and filled with tons of special features and even has a 2nd disc with an extended version.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|If you're a fan of the Metheny/Mays collaboration, including the Pat Metheny Group, this is one CD your collection MUST INCLUDE.  Pat likened making this CD to making a movie.  If so, I need to borrow someone else's hand, so I can give it THREE THUMBS UP!!!  Beautiful winding key changes made it just spectacular to listen to.  I closed my eyes and sat in a dark room and just soaked it in. I was almost overcome.  I have been a fan of Pat's since college, almost 25 years ago, and his music is just as evocative as ever.  I will see Pat, live, for the first time when he comes to Atlanta in March 2005, and now that I have this CD, I am just twitching with anticipation.  A MUST LISTEN!!
068987474X|3.0|For the most part I enjoyed the book.  I think that it gave me some helpful hints and opened my eyes to somethings in the past and some issues in the present. I don't think that it is the Bible of dating but I do think that you can get a good laugh at the book and yourself for being so silly over a guy at times.  We all have lets admit it, even me!   <br /> <br />I feel that at times it is okay to call a guy or maybe chat one up in bar.  What I feel the book was trying to get across was that you don't and shouldn't make all the moves.  Let him make some becuase if he is into you, you will not have to do all the work.

0618526412|5.0|This is not the kind of book that the average Oprah-watcher likes to read and understand. That's why so many complains. Oprah-readers like fast and shallow books, and she has disappointed them picking profound and complex novels -- like this one and Anna Karenina. I think it is great that this lady want people to read, but she must realize that most of her audience is not able to read complex novels -- let alone classics. <br /> <br />And regarding the 'comunism' in this novel... please, the 50s are over. It is really narrow mind of a person to say such a thing a of book in the XXI century. Whitch hunting is over!
B000001FDQ|5.0|At the time it came out, the playing was so far above the typical rock/metal guitarist's that it set the bar MUCH higher. <br />It still stands up very well today. There have been many guitarists to duplicate this style since this album came out in 1984, but this is still one of the best records of it's kind. <br /> <br />  Not only is this album full of technical mastery, but the songs themselves are interesting, and well constructed. The vocal tunes are weak, but that is a small part of the recording. <br />To be honest, this album is a lot to listen to in one sitting. Usually I'll listen to a couple of songs, and put it away for a month or two. It is something I listen to several times a year, and I have had it since it first came out! <br /> <br />  A lot of guitarists critisize Yngwie for being overly technical, and having no emotion. While it's true Yngwie focuses on the technical and flashy playing, his playing is very emotional. He has a GREAT vibrato, and on occassion does play slow passages. Not many of his detractors could do what he does, but Yngwie could almost certainly do what the armchair guitar critics can do with their basement guitar playing..:-) He overuses the technique card a bit, but that is why he is famous. <br /> <br />  The technical nature of this album, and it's baroque stylings make it very different from most popular music, and unique among guitar records in general. I doubt it is something you'd want to listen to over and over in one sitting, but for the type of album it is, it's one of the best of it's kind! <br /> <br /> <br />
B0006HXXBA|5.0|For those like myself I miss the glory days of Thrash Metal, or more defined, just straight-up killer Thrash Metal. Be it Bay Area Thrash(Exodus, Vio-lence), Canadian Thrash (Annihilator, Razor), Brazilian Blackend-Thrash(Vulcano, early Sepultura), or German Thrash (Destruction, Kreator, Sodom)...I love it with all of my blackened heart. The later of these scenes has given us some classic albums. And it has done so again with Kreator's \\"Enemy Of God.\\" It has been called upon at a time when Nu-Metal has taken it's last breath and Hot Topic/Ozzfest/Headgiver's 'Nu' Ball has replaced it, forcefully shoving god-awful Metalcore music down our throats and expected it us to accept it. A new genre of music used to replace the dead Nu-Metal Trend. Catering to the masses given it it's sneer and claimage to 'street' and such. But those such as me and those who truly keep the faith of real Heavy Metal nknow the difference. This is our rallying cry against the fashion-obsessed kids with 'emotional' lyrics, faux screams, and wacky haircuts that are parted to the side. <br /> <br />THIS IS THRASH F'NG METAL. IT'S TIME TO DIE!!! <br /> <br /> Kreator are a legend, and \\"Enemy Of God\\" helps seal that title with every tempo-twisting riffs, double-kick jolting, headbanging moment. Here you won't find any of the 'emotional'or even 'heartfelt' crud. None of this false 'hardcore' or even the always ripped-off Gothenburg riffs. NONE OF THAT. This is straight-up German Thrash Metal. It's in-your-face, it's down-right brutal, with lyrics about real-life violence, murder and Biblical fates. And does it make one want to smash the faces of poseurs in a brick wall.  <br /> <br /> Song-wise Kreator have finally reached where they left-off with their 1990 classic \\"Coma of Souls.\\" But much like \\"Coma Of Souls,\\" \\"Enemy Of God\\" is like a skilled fighter that takes it time with taking time beating you senseless, and then delivering it's merciless final blow. Staring off the album thrashing, and raginglike no other band can do the title track, \\"Impossible Brutality,\\"(It's the same groove taken from Slayer's \\"Skeletons Of Society\\" off 'Seasons In The Abyss\\".) and \\"Suicide Terrorist\\" deliver a good pounds to the rib-cage. Then a killer upper-cut with the next two song. \\"World Anarchy\\" starts off with a blood-curling scream that only Mille can pull-off. The riffs are nothing less that BRUTAL! There are heavy riffs, and there are riffs that make Slayer cry themselves to sleep. Kreator are not afraid to use those devastationg riffs. About 2:34 it cuts into a really melodic and soft-spoken part and then.....BAM! ARRRRGGGHHHHH!!! Mille screams \\"TOTAL CHAOS!!!\\" YESS!!! THRASH LIKE YOU'VE NEVER THRASH BEFORE YOU WORTHLESS CRETINS!!! The anthemic \\"Dystopia\\" continutes the brutality in good fashion. But like their previous album, their return to proper form after their mediocre 90's material \\"Violent Revolution\\"; it does have a small dip in where it does slow down a bit to let one catch their breath. \\"Voice Of The Dead\\" starts off with a nice acoustic piece and then into a killer galloping Maiden-esque riff(Don't confuse it with Gothenburg bands!)that would make the brummies themselves raise a pint. \\"Murder Fantasies\\" has a killer scream-along chorus chant \\"I WANT TO KILL YOU, TAKE AWAY YOUR LIFE!!!\\" \\"\\"When Death Take's It Dominion\\" features a slightly more technical riffing but continues the headbanging nonetheless. \\"One Evil Comes-A Million Follow\\" follows in the same fashion. After what seemed like a tedious moment in the album, it then picks right back up with \\"Dying Race Apocalypse.\\" Again starting-off with a nice, but longer acoustic bit at 0:40 it kicks in with the the guitars and what definately is, in my opinion, the best track off \\"Enemy Of God.\\" Ventor's double-bass is triggered, but who cares? It owns. \\"Under A Total Blackened Sky\\" is pretty much the same song but with a different tile. Not that it's a bad thing, because as long as it keeps up the momentum...more of it then I say. After eleven tracks \\"Enemy Of God\\" ends with it's final, epic delivery. What is the epic moment? It lies within the mastered melodic riffs starting at 4:30 and then builds up, and keeps building up until Mille screams with every blood cell in his veins...\\"AND SATAN IS HIS NAME!!!!\\" With such such a moment, you are then left with two things: A moment to raise your devil horns so high that it reaches the heavens and defiles everything that is holy. And one hell of an album. <br /> <br /> Kreator have achieved what others have tried, but failed miserably. Kreator have conquered where others have retreated. Kreator have truly forced terror back into Metal more-so than the immature, Hot Topic-loving Slayer's God LUVZ Us All.\\" Kreator wipes their rear-ends with Failtallica's \\"St. Anus.\\" Not forgetting the ones who have kep the faith strong...Destruction's \\"The Antichrist\\" pushed for the true alligence of old-school bands to come back with their metallic onslaught. Exodus proved why they were ALWAYS the true kings of Bay Area-Thrash with their come-back \\"Tempo of The Damned.\\" With much and many kudos faithfully given to those two bands, Kreator now has thrown down it's spiked gauntlet and drawn the line in the sand. You're either one of the true Metalheads, or you're sleeping in the commercial bed of the wretched Metalcore. Plain and simple. <br /> <br /> This ain't no lamb of god, this is ENEMY OF GOD!!

B00005JNBQ|5.0|There is no plot to this low budget movie. It is just the compialation of everyday life of Napoleon an ultra-nerd. This movie is devoid of sex,drugs,crime and profanity, sure I like that stuff in some movies but, not in every movie...This is a great change.       Many negative reviewers say there aren't any redeeming qualities of the main character this, however, is definately not the case.  Napoleon does good deeds for his friends and takes a lot of punishment from others without lashing out at the world. Where most people would just fall into self pity, Napoleon keeps on trucking.     If you have a decent sense of humor you might find yourself quoting this movie nonstop and watching it 9 times in a \\"two day rental period\\"-Good thing Blockbuster got rid of late fees.      People who hate this movie either A)Have no sense of humor or B) were very popular and can't relate at all to Napoleon.  People who hate this movie give perfect reviews for movies like \\"Catwoman\\" and music like Linsey Lohan and it could reasonably be inferred that they have little taste.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I'm not a huge pop-punk fan. I have always liked Green Day because they are incredibly good at writing catchy songs that I can enjoy enough to rock to with my pre-teen cousins, but not because I think their lyrics are incredibly insightful. However, this has all changed now. This is the best album in years. Moreover, it is arguably rather timeless -- since they do not reference any politicians directly, aside from their alluding to Bush's disagreement with France over the war in Iraq (and oh yeah, that's right, France was right about that, so perhaps Bush owes an apology to them), this album would have worked in the recession of the early 90s when Nirvana became huge due to disenchantment with the American Dream. Hell, it would have workedin the 1970s, when the punk broke during that recession. So basically, even though eventually this album will fall off the charts, it is worth buying simply because it is so powerful, and every time you get irked at the US government, economic woes, or how crappy the punk/political rock scene is, you will be able to pull this out and reflect on the situation through the graffiti in a 7-11 bathroom. Buy this album. Downloading this one is a mistake quite simply because half the fun is singing the lyrics along with it!

0385513755|3.0|For sometime now I've read and heard reports of how good this book is.  I finally jumped on the bandwagon and decided to see what all the fuss was about.  I found the story to be good but not great.  This may be due, in part, to all the hype about the book.  Once a book, or anything else, has been hyped the way this book has it is probably difficult to meet the expectations of the reader who has taken all the hype in.<br /><br />I must admit that I was really intrigued with all the history given to the various works of Da Vini.  I think I'll be doing a little more research into some of the hidden symbols that may really be present in his works.  The American professor made an interesting and unconventional hero.  The story moved at a quick pace, at least early on it did.  About half way through the book the story began to slow down and in some cases become repetitive.  While interesting at first, I found the constant explaining of the Sacred Feminine to get a bit old.  Brown, the author, presents an interesting take on the life of Jesus.  I doubt it will shake the Christian beliefs of those who are confident in their belief in God and his son Jesus.  However, it does raise questions that Christian or non-Christians will probably want to look into.  For example, the portion of the book that deals with the changes Constantine made to the Christian (Catholic) religion are true.  I've talked to some people that are offended by that part of the book, as well as other parts.  I don't know why, it's verifiable.  Books like THE DA VINCI CODE are, by design, meant to challange the accepted beliefs for many of its readers.  The fun in reading a book like this is to look into matters and discover if you, as the reader, may have the wrong take on a particular matter  or to find out where the author went wrong or fabricated part of the story.<br /><br />My biggest complaint about the story is the ending.  I don't want to give anything away but I expected more.  After spending hours reading hundreds of pages I bet most readers were expecting a more detailed ending.  Now that this book is being made into a movie it will be interesting to see just how close Hollywood stick to the source material.ndreds of pages I bet most readers were expecting a more detailed ending.

B000002U82|5.0|Of all the albums I've loved in my life and still do, this one takes the proverbial cake! <br /> <br />I have heard it hundreds and hundreds of times since I discovered this gem in about 1976, I still have the vinyl (although it's well worn) the cassette tape is a bit more worn out as this served me well while driving thousands of miles with it playing over and over. <br /> <br />It capitivates the listener, it radiates with complete charm and smart sound. It's a rock n roll revelation and celebration. <br /> <br />Another must for any real serious musical catalog! <br />
B00005JN0T|1.0|Well, a lot. More than a lot. Poor Will does his best with a doggie script. He accounts for the one star. <br /> <br />I don't know why those enlightened movie companies insist in making one SF dog after another. Did you watch the \\"The Chronicles of Riddick\\", \\"Sky Captain\\", or \\"AvP\\"? There are plenty of others around, all of them sucking money out of our pockets.  <br /> <br />They need to fool us in order to pay for the great CGI effects I suppose. They fail to understand that if CGI is used to generate profits, it will kill the emotional content of the movie. What's left is the customary Hollywood Pablum dulling our senses. <br /> <br />Do not relate this dog to any of Isaac Asimov's works. They stole the title and we shall punish them by forgetting this miserable mutt.

1401301010|4.0|I thought it would be intersting to read about a rock star's life & see if it's as glamorous as Hollywood makes it out to be. For the most part, Anthony's is anything but glitzy! Sure, he's lead a very full life, making mine seem mundane, boring, and uneventful by comparison, yet I'm not sure I'd want to have walked a mile in his shoes! <br /> <br />His childhood is spent between California & Michigan, between his mom & his dad. Kiedis' childhood ends prematurely as he's sucked into the constant partying of his father's lifestyle. This is when the decadence begins. Sex & drugs & rock 'n' roll! While most of Scar Tissue is about the stuggle to keep the Chili Peppers going, the vast majority of the book deals with Anthony's addiction & drug binges. Anthony also writes in great detail about his (many) relationships, his travels, and a lot of screwed-up things that have happened to him along the way. While many of these stories are dark, there are a lot of funny/humorous/entertaining ones here, mainly from the road. Kiedis comments every step of the way, enlightening us with his personal thoughts & philosophies.  <br /> <br />This book gives a lot of insight to what inspired certain RHCP songs, what certain lyrics mean and how/when he wrote them. The recording process to all of the albums is revelaed in great depths as well. The journey of the group from local party band to international mega-stardom is a remarkable one. Yet, even if you aren't a HUGE RHCP fan, this book is very entertaining & enlightening. I'm sure it's an enjoyable read for all who want a glimpse inisde the entertainment industry!
B000002I2I|5.0|After getting themselves a bit bruised with the less-than enthusiastic response to their fourth album, \\"The Soft Parade\\" (a great album for the most part, but it did contain a couple of clunkers), the Doors bounced right back with the outstanding \\"Morrison Hotel.\\" No horns, no strings, and no country-western stuff to be found on this album, just pure bar-band rock & blues, all played to perfection by the Doors. These are great songs, such as the rollicking Doors classics \\"Roadhouse Blues\\" and \\"Peace Frog,\\" the powerful rock of \\"Waiting For The Sun,\\" the very slinky \\"The Spy,\\" the fun of \\"You Make Me Real\\" and \\"Land Ho,\\" the great beauty of \\"Indian Summer,\\" and finally, the awesome dirty rock of \\"Maggie M'Gill.\\" The charismatic Jim Morrison is simply outstanding on the microphone, while keyboardist Ray Manzarek, guitarist Robbie Krieger, and drummer John Densmore sound amazingly tight. So buy this album, and enjoy your stay at the Morrison Hotel.
B00006M183|5.0|The funny thing (and good thing) is all of Pearl Jams albums are very uniquley different. <br /> <br />Their most popular releases were TEN, VS, and VITOLAGY mainly because they had the more classic tunes on them, and at that time they were a new band. <br /> <br />Of course that certainly does'nt mean that thoses albums are their best, on the whole as albums, or musically. <br />No Code saw them turn away from the spotlight of popularity and they created a different (and probably better)sound to their music than they had done before. <br />It was'nt till Binuaral that Pearl Jam stopped with the more experimental side of things (not that their was much) and turned back to putting out a more stright forward rock album. <br /> <br />Riot Act: Pearl Jams 7th album, and most different, is their best album as a whole and is a very rewarding listen. <br /> <br />The funny thing about it is, the tracks lack the alot of screaming that Eddie Vedder used to do in his singing alot,  <br /> <br />and the more powerful catchy riffs which made alot of their more rocky songs so accessible to many, and the easy on the ear melodies of their previous slower songs. <br /> <br />While they are lacking those things, its does'nt actually matter, cause they have taken an interesting approach to their sound which is, not making it catchy or in your face but more of a sound which draws you into the song, rather than it hitting you in the face. <br /> <br />Thats why it does take a few listens to get used to, as its very different and unoverworked music compared with past Pearl Jam albums. <br /> <br />But thats whats so good about it, and anyone who has a good ear for music will realise this. <br />
B0002YCVXI|5.0|I listened to this CD in a music store and tears came unbidden. Yo-Yo Ma's precise, subtle, deft touch on his cello with Morricone's scores reached in and touched my soul. This is beautiful music no matter what your ear is attuned to. Good music evokes pathos, eros, memories and imagination but only in its rarest form does the instrument, the score and the musician's abilities transcend to some indescribable level. By some divine gift or ethereal power Yo-Yo Ma coaxes, urges, persuades, insists that his cello lift your humanity and separate you from the lower kingdoms. Absolutely stunning!
B0006399FS|2.0|This is'nt the album U2 promised so no wonder everyones so dissapointed, not to mention it is a bit dissapoiting. <br /> <br />They've got one more chance to make  <br />\\"The old rock n roll U2 updated - sounding album.\\" <br />and reinstall themselves as the biggest and best band in the world, and not just in popularity - I mean musically. <br />And we better not have to wait 4 years for it!!! <br />Besides they're not as young as they used to be. <br /> <br />For U2s last \\"good\\" album check out  \\"POP.\\" and don't buy this, its really a big dissapointment.
B0002OERI0|2.0|Green Day could never disgrace themselves unless they headed (eventually) to the spotlight of crappy, fake sounding music, which they did do. <br /> <br />Of course not entirley, this album is no way near as bad as something like Blink 182, or Simple Plan or Yellowcard <br />(the biggest and most annoyingly stupid band on the planet) <br /> <br />It just does'nt have the sound on Billie Joes edgey heavy guitar that was so significant on \\"Insomniac\\" <br />(their most punk rock album) or their other albums either. <br /> <br />But the real problem is the far to polished sound of the songs and effects used on some, and as for the punk rock opera - well it just does'nt work. <br /> <br />Whoever stole their original album (so they had to start again and make this one ) should return it back and say sorry to Green Day and everyone of their fans because they have just destroyed Green Days actual image. <br /> <br />The real Punk Rock Green Day is on these albums: \\"Dookie\\" \\"Insomniac\\" and a fair amount on \\"Nimrod.\\" <br /> <br />Lets hope they spit in the spotlight in disgust next time and get on with being a great band.
B0001ENYKS|5.0|Listen very closely to what I'm about to say: THIS ALBUM F'ING ROCKS.  <br /> <br />When my friend had bought the CD and shoved her headphones on my head, then turned it to what was (at the time) a random song called 'Auf Achse', I knew that Franz was going to be one of the biggest things. I'm not saying that Franz is single-handedly going to deliver us from the \\"Pop Hell\\" that we've fallen into, because, quite frankly, it can't; we've sunk too far inside of it. But Franz certainly will be a safehouse for those who wish to escape MTV. <br /> <br />Being as young as I am, people often tell me that I don't know anything about music. Bull. I was raised on Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, and nearly every rock band from the 1960's and 70's. Some bands from the 80's were introduced to me as well, but not too many, seeing as the 80's was dominated almost completely by 'glam rock'. I was only three when grunge burst onto the mainstream, but when I was six, I was able to name any Led Zeppelin song my parents put on. And I've gotten even better, sometimes being able to not only list the album it (or any rock song, even, not just Zeppelin) came from, but in some cases, even the year the album was released. <br /> <br />So when I say that I feel Franz is going to be a grand thing, it should be taken seriously. Of course,it's only my opinion. I now know every song on the album, word for word (even the few German phrases and their translations), and I love this CD. If you're going to buy it, congratulations. If not, hey, that's your deal.
080010367X|4.0|Firstly I'll agree with David a few reviews up in that they've stuffed up the concept of what the Men In Black are supposed to be.  I too in my days of reading constantly about alien abductions and the like would always find that the MIB were alien life forms, not humans.  But all I could do was sit back and say \\"That's Hollywood for you\\" and try to enjoy it for what it was. <br /> <br />When I saw this in the cinema I didn't enjoy it as much as I could have as I went with someone who was not enthused to see it.  Don't ever do that!  Go alone if you have to.  It's amazing how much that, even in a darkened room, a disenchanted person next to you can alter the atmosphere. <br /> <br />That being said, since I've bought it on DVD and watched it many times since, it's got to be a favourite.  My kids like watching it with me, which is great as it means we can sit down together to watch something and I don't have to be suffering through some kiddie stuff.  Sonnenfeld seems to have found his niche of material with this sci-fi/comedy stuff, and he's hilarious on the commentary, and very insightful compared to a lot of other commentaries I've heard. <br /> <br />The effects are great - Stan Winston is undoubtedly a master at big screen make up, and the cgi work wasn't overdone to the point where it bugged you, like a lot of films are getting to these days.  I thought the pairing of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones was pretty inspired - I'm a big fan of Tommy and it was good to see him have some fun (or as much as he can) for a change.  Vincent rocked as the bug, he's so over the top he's hilarious!  And so gross!!!  LOL <br /> <br />Look, it's Hollywood, so you can never expect too much.  Enjoy it for what it is, and it's a movie where you can laugh, go \\"oh man, gross!\\" on occasion, and then have a sing to a Will Smith song at the end.
B000059T1E|5.0|I have a very heavy heart as I write this review---I've just heard the sad news that Traffic drummer Jim Capaldi has just passed away from stomach cancer at the age of 60. The rock world has lost one of it's greatest drummers, and an exceptional singer & songwriter as well. His contributions to Traffic, and to music in general, were fantastic, and I will miss him very much.Thankfully, Capaldi, like fellow late Traffic member Chris Wood, lives on in his recorded work, including all his wonderful albums with Traffic. One of Capaldi's finest moments with Traffic was this all-time classic, 1970's \\"John Barleycorn Must Die.\\" It was recorded at a time when Traffic had presumably disbanded for good after the release of their album, \\"Last Exit.\\" Steve Winwood started work on what he thought would be his first solo album, but retained the services of fellow Traffic men Capaldi and Wood to help him record it. When they had finished, it became obvious to the trio that what they had recorded could not possibly be released as a Winwood solo album, but a brand-new Traffic album. The album was christened \\"John Barleycorn Must Die,\\" and Traffic were re-born. And the album was a huge hit, too. \\"John Barleycorn Must Die\\" is an outstanding Traffic classic. Originally just six tracks in length, this album simply COOKS. The opening instrumental \\"Glad\\" is a masterpiece, with Winwood, Capaldi and Wood playing off each other and trading licks like musicians possessed. The number *totally* rocks, as do the two breathtaking tracks that immediately follow it, \\"Freedom Rider\\" and \\"Empty Pages.\\" The band slow things down a bit with the excellent \\"Stranger To Himself,\\" followed by the hauntingly beautiful \\"John Barleycorn,\\" a traditional song that Winwood, Capaldi & Wood play with quiet, exquisite perfection. The band then head for home with the rockin', atmospheric gem, \\"Every Mother's Son.\\" Winwood's vocals are outstanding throughout, and the trio's performances are simply sensational. \\"John Barleycorn Must Die\\" is a phenomenal Traffic masterpiece, one of the band's signature works. I'm very glad that they made it, and I'm very glad that they got back together again for several more incredible albums because of it. And so long, Jim Capaldi, we will miss you. Say hi to Chris for us.
B0000VD04M|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Tim Burton films - every one of them has been entertaining in it's own quirky way, and he really seems to know how to bring out the best performances from actors that generally don't impress me a great deal.  I have to say that Johnny Depp never fried my burger until he started working with Burton.  That said, I couldn't tear my eyes away from him in this particular film.  The humourous audacity and the parallel tradgedy of Ed Wood's life came out effortlessly, not only through Depp's performance, but that of everyone else, particularly Martin Landau.  The fact that it's in black and white escaped me at times too, I was so engrossed in \\"the moment\\" in just about every scene.  This is what I love about Burton films, you get so engrossed in the worlds he creates you forget you're watching actors.  And the fact that this was based on real life events made this film even more engaging.  If Burton doesn't win an Oscar soon, I'm gonna have to have a chat with the Academy myself.  He is a truly entertaining director.  If you love movies AT ALL, you have to see this film.
B0006B2A2E|4.0|I'm still rather confused as to why this movie has been listed as a comedy in many places. Sure, there is comic relief - but there is in Scarface too. It has been about a month since I last saw the spectacular Eternal Sunshine, but when I saw it, I don't think I really laughed, other than the scene when Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are really young, and they try to bathe him in the sink. But anyways... <br /> <br />This movie is so well done. Another reviewer put it best, saying \\"Just when you thought romantic comedies were unoriginal\\". That's so true. When I went into my school's movie theater, about to watch this movie, I had NO idea what to expect. I had heard nothing about it, other than the buzz about Carrey and Winslet's Oscar-worthy acting. As I participated in the adventure that this movie took me on, I found myself totally engrossed in the movie, unlike 95% of the other films I have seen. I never looked at my watch. I never talked or whispered to anybody around me. I was so involved, trying to figure the movie out. <br /> <br />That is why I gave the movie 4 out of 5 stars. At some points the plot was confusing, and I really had to sit back for a minute and try and figure out what was really going on. Thankfully, however, I was able to figure it out quickly enough. <br /> <br />The acting in this movie is superb, the directing excellent and the storyline provoking. What would you do? If someone so special betrayed you by erasing her memories of you, would you erase your memories of them? It's confusing and a hard question to answer. \\"Eternal Sunshine\\" may not answer that question for you, but it is truly amazing to see what the characters do in the movie.
B00005JKCH|1.0|I'm sorry, but I hated this film.  So much so that I refuse to see the second one. <br /> <br />Tobey Maguire looks about 12.  He did not convince me that even with super powers he could battle evil.  \\"I did all my own stunts.\\"  Please!  In just about all the action sequences, Spiderman was so cgi that he looked like a slimmed-down Shrek with red spandex on. <br /> <br />The only positive feeling that this film left me with was knowing that I was right in all those school yard debates many years ago:  \\"Who is the better super-hero, Spiderman or Batman?\\"  I was on Batman's side, and this film made me feel all the more justified in my choice. <br /> <br />I felt sorry for Kirsten Dunst.  She's a good actress, and she got stuck with this. <br /> <br />The best thing about it was it had a Nickelback song, and it's to Nickelback that my one lonely star for this film goes to. <br /> <br />Sorry.
B0002OERI0|1.0|I've been a fan of greenday since I was in 3rd grade(about 11 years ago now) and have been ever since.

It truly breaks my heart. Welcome to the machine guys.
B000060P79|1.0|...but come on. Just look at the cover and the title, and remember that horrendous song MTV and the radio would play, the one that goes \\"I'm Just A Kiiiiddddd\\". Now laugh hysterically like I'm doing right now.
B000001EUN|5.0|I am writing this as I listen to the album for the first time in years.  You see, I am not a heavy metal fan.  OK, I do have a certain fondness for Led Zeppelin, but generally, I'm more likely to be found listening to \\"Heartbeat - It's a Lovebeat\\" then anything that would be considered heavy.  Heck, I think \\"This Guy's in Love with You\\" by Herb Alpert is one of the best songs even written.  Yet, while it would surprise  most people who know me, the Scorpions are one of my all-time favorite groups.  The reason?  The Scorpion are not actually a heavy metal group, but a fusion group - combining heavy metal and pop.  And I mean this as a complement.  After all, there are many heavy metal bands.  But the Scorpions have the sweet voice of Klaus Meine (the Tony DeFranco of heavy metal?) and lyrics hardly more weighty than those sung by the Partridge Family.  Even if you are not into heavy metal, try this one.

B0002I831S|1.0|I am a devout Trekker, I came of age during the time that the original series aired. I found it childish and I had no interest in watching it. However, Gene Roddenberry's vision inspired me, I had the feeling that better things were on the way. I was right, the Next Generation series was proof that his vision was alive. Further proof was provided by Deep Space Nine and Voyager. <br />The fetus, the original series, was simply an absurd \\"William Shatner Show\\", the acting was ludicrous and Shatner's overweight and over acting destroyed the essence Roddenberry intended. <br /> <br />The Star Trek legend was born when Patrick Stewart and company came on TV in 1987. Before TNG, Star Trek was childs play and nothing more. No exploration of characters was possible with Shatner's vanity, he ruined the original series. Majel Roddenberry said that and I agree with her.
0793573742|5.0|'Beauty of the Burst' is hardly a deserving title. Given the reputation in collector/enthusiast circles this book has, it should be re-titled 'Bible of the Burst'.<br /><br />A picture tells a thousand words. Importantly, whilst there is significant text examining the technical aspects of the 'Bursts, the real emphasis in BOTB is upon glorious photographs of these mythical guitars. This is an honest representation of these much-debated guitars, as beauty is surely in the eye of the beholder (and the buyer), and BOTB, whilst classifying figure differences, etc. by no means attempts to define 'THE' 'Burst above all others. Indeed, these photgraphs indicate just how varied the guitars from '58-'60 were...<br /><br />Simply put, the Old Testament and the New Testament of 'Burst documentation rolled into one.
0446677450|5.0|First, I want to give my comments for `Rich Dad, Poor Dad' by Robert T Kiyosaki. I want to thank him for such a great book and has opened my mind to a whole new angle about financial freedom. <br /> <br />According to Robert T. Kiyosaki's book \\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\", he mentions about the Cash Flow Quadrant. The Cash Flow Quadrants are Employee Quadrant, Self-Employee Quadrant, Business Owner Quadrant and Investor Quadrant. <br /> <br />Most parents think that their kids need to go to college after finishing high school to achieve higher education in hoping to get a good job in a real life. This perception is not wrong but it's just not perfectly guarantee that their kids will be rich or success after getting a good job. As long as you still working for a company, you still can not be richer than the owner of the company. <br /> <br />I also have a bad experience before. I worked for couple years in a start up company until I got laid off because the company was not doing very well. At that time, I thought that working with people can not guarantee me for life. Then, Robert Kiyosaki's book changed my mind. <br /> <br />The book makes me realize that I had to move on and move to business quadrant or even investor quadrant. I want money works for me not me works for money. Again, I am not selling Mr. Kiyosaki's book here. I am just applying what he wrote in his book in my real life and I am starting to get the result now. And I am happy with it. <br /> <br />Now, you might asked me then how to make money works for us not vice versa. Well, one ways is that by creating a passive income. Passive income can be sustained by many ways, like Mr. Kiyosaki, he created passive income by dealing in the real estate business. He even joined Amway and he was focusing in this business for 5 years until know he must earned a lot of money from his passive income. <br /> <br />In conclusion, what I want to say is that again you have to open your mind not working with people for the rest of your life. You might need to work with a company for couple years to get enough investment for you to move to business owner quadrant or event moving to the highest level of the quadrant which is an investor quadrant. <br /> <br />The book is highly recommended.
0393317552|4.0|I am currently reading Guns, Germs, and Steel and having considered not buying it due to two reviews prior to mine, I bought it because in reading more reviews below them, I found that it seemed some bias on the part of the two reviews was at work.  While refuting another review is really not my object, I can say this, if you read the book, you will find that to every point these two reviews make, the ideas the reviewers made were taken out of context; the personal experiences Diamond mentions are put in a framework much larger than is mentioned, and germs, guns, and steel are brought up as signposts, as take off points  from which interesting discussions are brought up in analyzing the strengths in cultures which may or may not come to dominate others.   <br /> <br />I believe Diamond makes his points successfully, and further that this book is on par or higher with Robin Lane Fox's Pagans and Christians.  Then again, the only way to be convinced is to open a book to any page and consider the merit of what that page says. <br /> <br />--Matthew Hahn <br />[...] <br />
B00005OAIE|5.0|While I am very interested in exploring the new releases of good pop music, I am pushing mid-40s & increasingly find it difficult to fit into the new genre. <br /> <br />But Mayer's music is new, cool, hang-loose and different with good blend of pop/rock/jazz.  Almost 3/4 of the album could be released as singles.  Touche Mr Mayer!  You score with the young and still struck good chords with the young-at-hearts!!  5 stars no less!
B000089CJI|5.0|This album is music as good as it gets. It's quality from track 1 to 10, as if all songs were written with the same love by the songmakers, which nowadays isn't the case, as industry is driven by \\"top-single-bad-album\\"-writing bands. I listened to \\"Give Up\\", loved it. Showed it to my brother, he loved it, too. My father was amazed. My friends are surrendered. My car doesn't want anything else. It''s just good, fresh mood for one hour! It doesn't require you to be a fan of any special music type, this is a unique piece, and listening to it makes one feel as such, too. Where else can you find \\"There was never any mistery of who shot John F. Kennedy. It was just a man with something to prove, slightly bored and severely confused\\" ?
0316172324|4.0|The mistake was too try and get all of these wild animals onto the same boat. The book a series of semi-socio-scientific articles on insight and intuition. It is not a cohesive theory.  <br /> <br />The writing is enjoyable - I read the most of it in a single plane flight. Some of the insights provide building blocks for understanding how certain professionals (people who practice a subject or skill for many years) are able to develop an additional sense about things -- gamblers, art curators, policemen. They are essentially seeing something that doesn't register at the conscious-level but provides them a gut-feel about the thing. Actually, I should say that these articles are how this MIGHT be happening - it's more speculation based on the diverse theories of a number of different researchers. Individually the stories and ideas are believable. Unfortuately, Gladwell fumbles in trying take them into some unified theory that is comprehensible let alone cohesive -- at times you wonder \\"where is he going with this?\\". Without that thread the indivudal beads get lost and fade into memory as clever ideas...and not much more. Without confidence in the grand idea, the individual pieces begin to feel simply exploratory. It's a shame because there are some remarkable ideas. He's a good documenter of curiousities of research (sort of like a Ken Burns is to historical things) so the storytelling is good enough for entertainment. Another reviewer likened it the addage about Chinese food, tasty but hungry an hour later. I agree. Flawed but still some interesting ideas to puzzle over.
B0001AP12G|4.0|well this album is just amazing It has the 4 singles slow jams, through the wire, jesus walks and all falls down.the album also has other great songs like workout plan we dont care and breathe in breathe out.but there are a couple of songs that just aren't any good like never let me down and two words.so really he has got a great album but it could be better.
0767834739|1.0|What is this trash?  Anyone who thinks this movie is any good must be insane.  I don't care who liked the videogame, this is supposed to be a movie.  The dim-witted plot is carried out so drudgingly, it bores me to tears.  How superficial can a film be?  This kind of trash is only suitable for possessed retards with anxiety dysfunctions.  The movie deserves not only the lowest rating possible, but it begs submission to the Golden Turkey Award, where it would gladly see some glory.  Either that or the makers should have their heads examined.<br /><br />For the parents with genuine concerns that gullibly think videogame violence is the root of leading teens astray and decide to connect this movie to it, this piece of unadulterated garbage is a three-pointer for them.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I have never written a review before and probably never will again, but this is worth it to me.  I absolutley love Sara Mclachlan.  I have all of her albums and I can not honestly pick a favorite, I have a 6 disc changer in my car and 4 out of the 6 are Sara because I can't chose which cd I want to listen to.  This new album is great, the lyrics in her songs come from her heart and you can tell.  Although I am still a big fan of the old music, I love the new too. <br />I have one suggestion for anyone who is a true Sara fan, click on the concert tickets link above and find a concert near you.  I went to her concert in August '04 and I have never experienced anything like it!  She puts so much emotion into her music and you can see it in her face. I am not the type to get mushy over music but I had tears in my eyes watching and listening to her perform Arms of an Angel at the piano alone.  She is funny, cute and an EXCELLENT vocalist.  I loved Sara before but after going to her concert I have a whole new perspective and view of her, she is unbelievable.  I am going again in May '05. <br />There is nothing negative to write about Sara, she is an all around excellent performer.

If you don't like it it doesn't mean that the whole world thinks the same.

0385510454|2.0|This had all the makings of a great spy story. And failed to deliver. It reads like a novella that was stretched out to novel length to sell. The \\"hero\\" Joel Backman spends half the story studying a new language. It reads more like a tour guide of Europe. <br />The story is very implausible (but I won't spoil it.) <br />Read the story if you are bored but otherwise don't waste your time. This is the first Grisham book I've read. I will never waste my time with another. <br />
B0000VAFO0|3.0|This turned out to be a fairly entertaining movie.  It takes the classic Hatfields and McCoys story line and substitues vampires and lycans(werewolves) for the two families.  The vampire elders ensure this by forbidding their people to learn any history.  I must say though the weapons that each side use are much more impressive than backwoods shotguns.  Each side has highly engineered weapons that target the others weakness.  The vampires have bullets containing silver nitrate of which the werewolves cannot surive.  Similarly the werewolves have ultraviolet bullets that are lethal to the vampires.<br /><br />The plot hinges around the revenge that the werewolves seek on the upper class vampires.  Kate Beckinsale gives a good performance as the central \\"death dealer\\" of the vampires.  In the beginning diligently carries out her duty to hunt down and kill the werewolves, but as the story progresses she will learn of betrayals on many levels.  In the midst of this she falls in love with a \\"human\\" Michael Corvin who holds the key to everything.  Meanwhile, Lucian, is rallying the werewolves to defeat the vampires while conducting some odd genetic expirements.  One of the differences between this and other vampire/werewolf movies is that genetics is used to explain these creatures rather than myth and lore.<br /><br />The effects and sound of the movie are great.  After watching the special features, you will learn that the techniques used in this movie are much more traditional with very little CGI animation.<br /><br />At the end of the day, what you have is a moderately interesting movie with nice special features.  However, I doubt seriously that this is something that you will want to watch time and again.  For me that puts this DVD in the rent, don't buy category.
B00005OAA6|5.0|It's been almost 4 years since this CD was released yet its Miss Posh's only one to date...sadly.  You see the Brits are jealous of her...VERY jealous...she married David Beckham so no one can blame them yet still their a bit harsh!<br /><br />Victoria did make another attempt at her solo career in 2003 with Let your head go/This Groove yet apparently hitting #3 is flopping nowadays in the UK *rolls eyes* oh well on to the review!<br /><br />This CD is the epitome of pop right before it went bad.  Ya know when hip hop, rock, and 'punk' all mated and made the bastard child we now know as 'popular music' of 2004 hopefully not 2005.  Not only does this CD have the sounds of good ol pop but it also has something a bit more intimate: Victoria's soul.<br /><br />Now Im still waiting for my copy of 'Learning to fly' to come (I hate you Wal Mart!) but Victoria has said herself in interviews and such that this CD reflects a lot of her, and it shows!  Maybe thats why it wasnt as well recieved as other solo Spice projects: If it speaks to me it apparently speaks to no one else in the general populace!<br /><br />'Victoria Beckham' kicks off with the 'catchy for a short while but then annoying' 'Not such an innocent girl'.  It was her first single and I love it and all but ever since I found out it was intended for Willa Ford well...I just...cant...<br /><br />The next track is the more 'spoken word' 'A mind of its own'.  BRILLIANT!  Very sweet, vulnerable, and true.  'That kind of girl' kicks off her 'to David haha to rest of you cuz I have him' songs.  Its really sweet none the less...the type of sweet ballad that could end a good romance comedy movie.<br /><br />'Like that' goes back to the 'Not such an innocent girl' vibe and like the first its nice but gets old quickly...its never spoken to me...maybe it will someday.  'Girlfriend' finally gets the 'fast song' vibe and does it RIGHT i.e. you dont tire of it.  The only problem here is it goes along the lines of the Spice Girl's 'Weekened Love' i.e. its great BUT the lyrics make no freakin sense what so ever!  One minute she's saying 'look dont be calling me cuz you find my # thats his fault not mine' THEN she tries to say 'sorry he wants me BACK' insinuating that she had him before...listen to the song its kinda puzzling...but still enjoyable and catty which well just makes it brilliant!<br /><br />'Midnight fantasy' is one of the faster tracks before the 'this is me' songs kick in.  Nice and very 'Girlfriend' but less confusing.  'I.O.U.' is one of the better tracks on the whole CD!  Its so sweet...honestly if your very bitter this CD is hard to listen to at times.<br /><br />'No trix no games' gives us a small interlude of fastness before they slow it down again *yet* it stays with the 'this is me' vibe.  It tells of a girl who may hide herself to the world and usually does to men too but to this certain love she wont...<br /><br />'I wish' is one of the more meainful songs. This one has the confusing 'Girlfriend' problem...either this girl in the song is a tease or shes just like me and scared out of her wits of men...either way it could confuse the normaler people of the world.<br /><br />'Whatchu talkin bout' is rumored to be written about Miss Ginger Spice though thats never been confirmed...listen to it the song does scream 'BETRAYER SOCIAL CLIMBER WANNABE!'<br /><br />'Unconditional Love' is much like 'I.O.U.' in the sappy true to self songs area.  So sweet!  A hard song to listen to when bitter or hurt though...<br /><br />'Every part of me' is a song dedicated to her then only son (shes pregnant with her 3rd now) Brooklyn.  Sweet but eh boring way to end a 'true to me' fanatastic pop CD.<br /><br />Overall a great millenuim pop piece and a great CD for the little odd girls everywhere!  Maybe we're not so odd afterall...after all one of us snagged David Beckham...mmm...the Spice Girl's 'Weekened Love' i.e. its great BUT the lyrics make no freakin sense what so ever!

068987474X|5.0|I'm a female that has just graduated college and I'm in grad school now.  I have really never grown out of my college habits and especially my habits with men.  It was the same pattern over and over again.  Things were never going my way.  This advice changed my life.  I realized that I wasn't seeing what was clearly in my face the whole time.  Its so easy for a ex-party girl like me to lose fact of the values I took for granted.  We do have the power to walk away and find someone else.  If he is \\"JUST NOT INTO YOU\\", then he is just not into you!!!  I was in a toss-up relationship talking to man when I took this advice.  Things couldn't be better now.  He came crawling to me.  I was miserable because I could never get the control and now I do.  My love life no matter if this guy works out or not will be better because of this advice.. Maybe the world would have a lower divorce rate if all women took this advice and didn't marry the first smuck that came around.. thank you!!!!

B000066C6Z|4.0|The creators of \\"Airplane!\\" wanted another challenge, and thus they chose to spoof war films, rock films and anything else that came to mind.  In doing so, they nearly lived up to the classic \\"Airplane!\\".    Strangely enough this is Val Kilmer's introduction to feature films.  I know...  He sings (yes, it's him), and really he fits fairly well into the overall spoof scene.    Ah yes, the plot.  Well, the premise is that Kilmer plays an American rock-star that is requested to play at a German concert to help some elaborate plan; however, he gets more then he bargains for when he winds up beholden to a damsel-in-distress and an attempt to maybe even save at least a good part of the world.    Of course, this film is filled with mocking humor, but this time it appears gradually.  At the beginning, the humor is more subdued and as time goes on the humor is more often, and thankfully, more funny.    Now, this is not a great film and if I could I would give it 3.5 stars.  However, it still is pretty funny, and well, it's by the people who did \\"Airplane!\\" right?
B00005JN4O|5.0|PETER PAN was never my favorite childhood story. It has come to life in a number of versions on stage and screen, but the story of the boy who never wanted to grow up never appealed to me. Who knows, maybe I need to release my inner child and that is why I react negatively to it. Since I am not the greatest PETER PAN fan, I had no string desire to see FINDING NEVERLAND. I read reviews in the paper, some of which lauded the work, others which gave it less than favorable grades. It was not until a woman in a writing workshop I attended praised the film that my interest was peaked. She said it was something all writers would relate to and it was well done. Since she, like many of the participants of the workshop could tell an interesting story and appreciate a good story as well, I decided I should go see it. I put it off until after it was nominated for various Academy Awards and decided I had to see it before the Oscars.<br /><br />I will not say that FINDING NEVERLAND deserves to receive all of the Oscars that it is the running for, but it does deserve all of the nominations it has received. It is a beautiful film with a riveting story. It tells the story of the writer J.M. Barrie and the relationship he has with the widow Sylvia Llewellyn Davies and her four young sons.  Barrie is in an unhappy marriage and his friendship with Sylvia, as well as his fascination with her sons brings him out of a slump. The relationship resulted in his writing the play PETER PAN. The main focus of the film is the relationship between Barrie, Sylvia, and her sons. Little attention is paid to the marital conflict, nor is undue attention paid to the rumors regarding the friendship of Sylvia and Barrie (e.g. Is it Platonic? Why is he so mesmerized by the boys?). Both situations are mentioned so the viewer is aware that Barrie's world is not Neverland. While some could se this as a glossing over of the conflict in the film, the brief attention speaks powerfully and allows the viewer to be aware of the whole situation, which in turn allows the viewer to see how this family inspired what many consider to be a great work by a genius.<br /><br />The acting is superb. Once again Johnny Depp shows he is a great character actor and Kate Winslet is wonderful as Sylvia. Rahda Mitchell plays Mary Barrie, J.M.'s wife with great skill. She is neither a vixen nor a shrew, which makes the marital difficulties easy to believe. Two of Hollywood's greats, Julie Christie and Dustin Hoffman, play supporting roles which are integral to the success of the film. Hoffman is the theatre owner Charles Frohman who produces Barrie's plays and has misgivings about PETER PAN. Julie Christie plays Sylvia's mother Emma du Maurier. Emma is a socialite who appears to be snobby, but we see as the film progresses that it is out of concern for her daughter and grandchildren. Perhaps the characters who have the most emotional pull in the film are the Llewelyn Davies boys George, Jack, Peter, and Michael played by Nick Roud, Joe Prospero, Freddie Highmore, and Luke Spill respectively. While Highmore's Peter is endearing, viewers' hearts go out to Roud's George, who cannot be a Peter Pan like figure when his mother is dying. The setting for the film is beautiful. Early twentieth century England comes to life in a realistic manner, and the props and stage equipment in the theatre are also accurate for the time period. The music is moving and adds an emotional element to the film.<br /><br />So will it get Best Picture? Maybe, but the competition is steep. I would not expect to see Depp receive best actor in place of Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles, though in another year Depp would be a contender for the award. It could easily win awards for art direction, music, adapted screenplay and costume design. If there was an Academy Award for moving the heart, FINDING NEVERLAND would easily win.<br /><br />Enjoy!!!be aware of the whole situation, which in turn allows the viewer to see how this family inspired what many consider to be a great work by a genius. <br /> <br />The acting is superb.

B0006399FS|1.0|'How To Dismantle an Atomic Bomb' is so dissapointing because its merely a rehash of former glories, they barely challenge themselves to create an original sound, something they strived to do throughout their 1990s peak.     Since 1999 U2 have been too pre-occupied with being \\"the biggest band in the world\\", has opposed to the best. The songs on 'How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb' show that U2 are obsessed with getting their music onto US radio and making it grammy-worthy, and so a lot of the album comes over has bland and boring adult pop.     If you are new to U2 or are only familiar with ATYCLB you may well love this album (i'm sure the Grammy's will) but has a dedicated U2 fan it merely sounds like an attempt to make a 'worthy' album that will appeal to the mainstream masses.
B00003CXCT|2.0|This is blatant false advertising, this is not the OT but the much reviled SE. The picture transfer is top notch but Ive heard complaints about the 5.1 mix. The extras are ok but are weak compared to what PJ did with LOTR. Give us the OT George.
B000001EAQ|5.0|This album was given a very heavy \\"whipping\\" when it was released back in the late 90's. Unfairly, brit-pop was still living out it's (soon to be) final embers of success, so anything too electronic was looked at as nonsensical <br /> <br />Flood and Howie B took production duties here, and it really shows. Some complain that the organic \\"feel of the band, man\\" has gone, but the use of loops, textures et al really come to the fore on various tracks , such as mofo, miami, and discoteque <br /> <br />It's sad that Flood himself has occasionally also been a little scathing of this in some reviews, not to mention the fact that even the band tried to dissmiss it at the time?  <br /> <br />This was the \\"apex\\" of the triumverate that began with achtung baby (not including the passengers album), and after this, they went back to a more \\"natural\\" sound. I personally think it's sad they went so far back in the other direction after this...a shame <br /> <br />But this is brilliant, and with so many hidden depths and layers that aren't always obvious on a few (or even ten)listens, this deserves to be a REAL classic  <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005QEO1|5.0|Pump is what can be best described as brilliant.  Brilliant mainly because you get a raw form of rock on this album that is rarely accomplished, and nearly non-existent today.  Young Lust, Love in Elevator, and The Other Side are staple good feel rock hits.  What it Takes does what no rock ballad has ever done before... stay cool and well played and liked from its release to 16 years later (My god has it really been that long!)  The backbone of the album is of course the mega smash hit Janie's Got a Gun which is a true classic rock gem.  Telling of the story of child abuse it delves right into the soul of all that listen by being as cut-throat as it gets but while not being preachy.  The MTV videos also took these singles to a new level of iconic status as well. All in all, A masterpiece album of great writing and performance levels.  A true 10 out of 10.

B00005QENZ|5.0|1993's Get a Grip signaled the more commercial album for Aerosmith which delivered 5 hits.  Livin' on the Edge and Eat the Rich delivered classic Aerosmith rock. But then came the 3 mega hits that would send Aerosmith into rock/pop immortality.  The Cryamazy trilogy of Cryin, Amazing, and Crazy which all won countless MTV video awards, became mega #1 smashes and launched the acting careers of Alicia Silverstone, and Liv Tyler.   <br /> <br />The album's only other good single was the song used in Waynes World 2, Shut up and Dance, which in itself is catchy.  Aside from those 6 songs, the rest of the album is standard filler.  This album could have easily dropped off the Earth after Livin on the Edge debuted, but thanks to MTV, those staple videos of the Cryamazy trilogy had fans craving for more.  This would be the last crossover megahit album for Aerosmith (as of Jan 2005) that would spend weeks at #1 with huge singles loaded on an album.  Call it a sell-out album for Aerosmith of not, one thing is certain about the massive sales Get A Grip generated and the single and videos.. Get A Grip was and still is Amazing.

1577311523|5.0|Well, I am glad to read all those who think this book is codswallop. <br /> <br />Those who insist on judging the book as negative, do it by criticising the man \\"see his website?\\" \\"uses the same crap language as other new-age books\\"  <br /> <br />An insistance on using names and putting down, and a sense of deep seriousness/importance <br /> <br />Thats what you get in this ego society. But as Eckhardt says \\"arguements are a way of surviving. Wars have been created to win arguements\\" so for all the critics, keep criticising, but one day you will need to face what you are saying this book is so crap about. <br /> <br />For those who are attracted to this book, I say start practicing now! For $20 you can get a guide to how to live in the moment, which makes all those not in the moment very very funny. <br /> <br />Then go out and create, make this a way of living, then teach for those willing to listen. <br /> <br />For those sitting on the fence, my advice: read it, take what you need to take, then move on. He is not your guru, you are your own. This, of course, is the way to enlightnment, but by taking the responsibility yourself, there are no more excuses.  <br />That fear that Eckhardt talks about is truly able to be overcome. <br />So, read & pass it on, and bring others in as fire to your flame. <br /> <br />Then we can move on from being a world so easily manipulated by the Murdochs and Bushes, manipulated by ads that want you to consume, and gets you in touch with the planet so you arent sucked in by greenwash. <br /> <br />Teach the kids how to be in the now (or how to stay being in the now) and we will have a changed society within 50 years.  <br /> <br />So, its not so much a review of the book and taking apart its syntax, but using the advice he has to help change and bring to equilibrium <br /> <br />Have a great read!
0345350499|2.0|I saw the movie first. Thank goodness. Then I at least got to watch Michael Vartan in bed. The book after the movie was too long, too slow, and followed very much the same story. The movie had beautiful imagery and was other-worldly. So I stopped reading and watched Alias so I could watch Michael Vartan again. But if you want to read a LONG book with great characters, read the Time Traveler's Wife instead. It is a much better use of your time and portrays a much better love story. <br />
B00003CXCT|4.0|This just in:  A new version of Casablanca is coming out because Warner Brothers didn't get a chance to make the movie they originally wanted.  New scenes will be amazing, even if they are stupid and have nothing to do with the movie at all. <br /> <br />Ok, just kidding.  But I have to admit that I belong to the camp that would like to have the original version of the films, without all of the extra scenes that have been added along the way.  Especially annoying to me is the Jabba scene in IV, which should have just been one of those \\"deleted extras.\\"  And of course VI ends with a whole new sequence, and the Ewok celebration music is gone.  But even with the minor and major changes, the sound and video improvements are as good as any DVD set ever released.  And since there are no other versions available at this time (hint hint) we're stuck with this one.

Everybody has got their own taste in music, so it's normal for one to ask questions like \\" Where is E.Van Halen, Jimmy Page, Ritchie Blackmore, Al di Meola, Steve Morse, Joe Satriani, Gary Moore, Brian May, Eric Gales,Gales Bros, Walter Trout, Steve Lukather?\\" as the name of the festival is \\"Guitar Festival\\" and these names represent the meaning of \\"guitar\\" for many people, notwithstanding my respect for the guitar players who took part at the festival.     We have legends like , Santana, Robert Cray, Steve Vai, Eric Johnson, John Mac Laughlin, BB King, Jeff Beck(was he there actually?) and Buddy Guy and that's wonderful, but they are covered for only one song each (Jam sessions do not count), and they definitely deserved more coverage than some of the others, such as the ones singing about what they like about Oklahoma girls, why they prefer the Oklahoma girls over the Texas girls, what the cowgirls do and the consequential results, etc...    We have great non-guitarist musicians, or should I say legends in their own field of interest like Dennis Chambers, Donald Dunn and Steve Gadd playing at the festival, which is great, but unfortunately they didn't get noteworthy spotlight (check out Dennis Chambers' solo during John mc Laughlin's set, we can see anything, including ladies with sexy outfits, but we can't see the solo of the best drummer in the world, perfect camera selection(!)) Probably the person who edited this DVD does not know who these guys are, and he should have known better!!    Overall,a good and an enjoyable performance, and a good DVD, but not without shortcomings..
B0002OERI0|5.0|I'm not a huge Greenday fan either, though I love a couple of early songs from Dookie like Longview.  <br /> <br />But this is an important step for the men of Greenday, and I love this album, and I thoroughly endorse it for the Grammy for record of the year. <br /> <br />How anyone could listen to songs like Dearly Beloved, Wake Me up when September Ends, or Whatsername and not be deeply moved escapes me. <br /> <br />If you've ever liked even one song by Greenday, please press \\"add to cart\\" right now - you won't be disappointed.
B000092ZYX|5.0|When I first heard of Radiohead, a friend at camp told me they were good so I went out and bought this as my first Radiohead CD. I bought it along with some other CD's which I already knew I would like so after one listen, it went back on the shelf barely listened to. I hated Thom Yorke's whiny voice and the strange elctronica on a few of the tracks. A little while ago I decided to listen to it again. After a few listens it started to grow on me and, all of a sudden, it was my favorite album. For my birthday, I bought OK Computer which is judged many here as a better album. I liked it but I think this follows as a close second. I like almost every song except for We Suck Young Blood
B00005YW4H|1.0|I'm going to center this review around a lyric off of R.A. the Rugged Man's \\"Die Rugged Man Die\\". The song is called \\"Lessons\\". <br /> <br />\\"I knew this chick named Norah, a lounge singer, a year later, she a 6 Grammy award winner.\\" <br /> <br />I've already written a review on Norah's latest musical Ambien. Read that for a better idea on what I'm saying. <br /> <br />As for this CD, it meets all my standards for a one star CD.  <br /> <br />Unoriginal/unoffensive subject matter? Check. <br />Talent being flushed down the drain? Check. <br />Uninspiring? Check. <br />Would you be embarrased to buy it? Check.  <br />Cannot relate to CD at all? Check. <br />Would my mom listen to it? No. She'd think it's boring. <br />Would you most likely find this in a Ford Windstar with Celine Dion and Whitney Houston? Yes. <br />Is it bland and tepid enough to play in a grocery store? Check. <br /> <br />Now, Norah Jones may or may not have talent. She can sing quite a pretty tune. However, I can find you 5,000,000 lounge singers who can do just as good of a job if NOT better. And, they also aren't Ravi Shankars daughter.  <br /> <br />Nepotism does not a good artist make.
0316172324|4.0|Malcom Gladwell has a unique ability to see connections where no one else has. Blink may not provide stunning original insights that make you fall out of your chair.  It's more like you smack your forehead and say \\"why didn't I think of that?\\" It's fascinating to read the articles in the archives of Gladwell's website and see the evolution of his books.  I can't help but wonder at what point these disparate topics coalesce into one idea. Gladwell then melds them into an entertaining, enlightening, and cohesive narrative.  Read and enjoy.

B0000AGWJ7|5.0|Before we begin, realize the album cover gives the impression that A7X (that's what they like to call themselves - I guess Avenged Sevenfold has too many syllables) is a Venom-style death metal band. It is not. At least, I don't think so. <br /> <br />To figure that out, let's start cooking: <br />     Start with one pound of Iron Maiden <br />     Add 1/2 cup of Pantera/Dimebag Darrel riffs <br />     Throw in 3 teaspoons of Government Issue, and 2 teaspoons of Weezer or other emo-sounding band <br />     Mix with three layers of Swedish Gothenburg metal sound <br />     Pinch in some early Metallica (preferably Kill 'Em All) <br />     Add another pinch of early TSOL <br />     Layer with Stryper, or some other Christian-rock (I'm not kidding about this) <br />     Bake at a temperature suitable for Napalm Death <br />     Serve with some vague and introspective, Maynard James Keenan-style lyrics (he's the lead singer of TOOL you dummies) <br />     Keep leftovers at room temperature (I'm not sure what that means) <br /> <br />With all of those ingredients, cooking can be very dangerous. But A7X managed to put all that into one album. Confused? Waking the Fallen will help you figure it out. I'm flat out impressed with it, and that takes a lot for the MODSQUAD.
6305910340|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite films. It is about a chess playing kid who went on to win numerous national chess championships. It really doesn't have much to do with Bobby Fischer himself (except for some occasional film clips). But the growth and struggle of this kid and both the pressure and support he gets from his father makes this a great film to learn from.
B00000099Y|5.0|Dick Schapp once said of his interview subjects: I hated him for being such an extraordinary person, because it made writing my story so difficult - nothing I penned was good enough to describe a phenomenal human being. Such is the problem with this review.  TOOL is led by the most phenomenal frontman in heavy music. His name is Maynard James Keenan. Luckily for TOOL, the rest of the band is equally amazing at their instruments. And their third recording (if you count Opiate) is probably one of the top 5 albums ever made - I kid you not.  TOOL is about right-brain, manly metal music. It is about introspective lyrics that, on the face of things, are difficult to figure out. It is about anger (read the words to Aenima, the song). And it is about creating songs not for radio, but for texture, for complexity, for emotion, and for density.  Eulogy may be one of the most offensive songs ever written about Jesus Christ (it questions his Messianic qualities), but look inward, and you'll see what MJK is saying - you may have thought this yourself. Hooker [...] is offensive in its own right, but it also has a message that is fueled with hyperactive riffs and sonic drumming. Third Eye is an epic that leaves you stunned. And Stinkfist? It's the song that MTV would only call \\"Track #1\\" on its video rotation. Obviously, they missed the whole point. There's also a song that has someone reciting something in German - don't worry, it's not about the Third Reich - it's just an egg recipe.  In the world of music, TOOL does more. Most bands record a few good tracks, and toss a load of crap in, just to fill an album. In the age of dowloadable songs, is that such a great idea anymore?  TOOL is a metaphor for intelligent, heavy, industrial, angst-ridden prog rock that grabs you by the scrotum, twists you around, and throws you up in the air. Before you hit the ground, it throws you curve balls like the mind boggling \\"Ions(-)\\" and continued references to water and crying. What is going on?Remember, this is a band that lays claim to the practice of lachrymology (the study of crying), has a lead singer who tattooed his vertebrae to his back, prances around on stage (at least during this tour) in a wig and [...], tricked everyone into thinking they all died in a bus crash, and produces videos with agonized clay-mation figures being mutilated.  Are you intrigued? Well then, what the hell does it take?
0345440900|5.0|I read this book while I was pg with my daughter.  I followed the advise and everything Tracy suggests in the book worked perfectly!  She has a very middle-of-the-road approach and stresses ROUTINE vs a strict time schedule.  My daughter (since she was only a month or 2 old) has fallen asleep by herself and slept thru the night, she is also a fabulous napper, there is NEVER any battle to get her to go to sleep.  She loves her crib and actually asks to go in it when she's very tired.  Every babysitter I've ever had is completely amazed at how she goes \\"down.\\"  They have said things like, \\"she's the easiest baby to put to bed\\"  and \\"she falls asleep so good by herself with no rocking and no bottle.\\"  If I had not read this book, my daughter would not be such a good sleeper. I also read Tracy's book for toddlers, which was also VERY helpful when dealing with tantrums, hitting, and other bad toddler habits!

0345440900|5.0|I buy this book now for my pregnant friends, I wish I had it when I came home from the hospital.  I'm not a big believer in using one person's philosophy or system to raise your child, but sometimes its nice to have some guidelines, suggestions or encouragement.  I like this book because its a nice middle-of-the-road attitude.  Some reviews said she is judgemental, but I don't feel that's the case. She is saying what's worked for her, and specifically says that if you're doing something else that's working, don't change it. She does include some 'baby types' and general schedules, but states specifically that every baby and family is different and these are just general guidelines. Really, in this book, she presents PATTERNS rather than schedules.  Babies like to have predictable days, this shouldn't be a surprise to anyone.  With this book you can help yourself see what patterns your baby is trying to set up for himself and help him do so.  At least, that's how I used it.

B0006M4SO6|5.0|The Way Up is another Pat Metheny classic. It seems like Pat Metheny with Lyle Mays and Steve Rodby outdo themselves each time they create a new album. The trio has worked together for over 20 years and this album showcases their masterful skills and collaberation. This album is unique in the fact that it's content is a continous 68 minute album that is cut into 4 stages of music. This album, like many of Pat's other albums, is a journey into life. There are quiet and peaceful moments that elicit bueatiful charm and repetitious yet compelling moments in the album that are alluring in detail. The album is very unique in it's mix and any true music lover would say that it is not only a creative masterpiece but also one intricate in detail and design. While many consider Pat Metheny a jazz classic I have always been of the opinion that Pat Metheny has created his own style and brand of music that mixes jazz, rock and classical styles all in one CD. The Way Up is another example of painless detail that produces an incredible musical experience. I am very excited about seeing Pat and his wonderfully talented group of friends create this masterpiece in concert!!

B0001HLVS2|5.0|The best thing about this movie is they tried to convey what it must have been like aboard a 18th century Naval Frigate (The HMS Surprise).  My Uncle who served in WWII said Saving Private Ryan did this for the European battles he was in, but all the military men of Captain Aubrey's day are gone, so we have to take Patrick O'Brian and Peter Wiers word for it.  Attention to detail was key in this movie; the costumes, the weevils, the ships rigging and the English Language of the day took you to that time and place.  It's a fun movie to watch, so sit down and enjoy the ride.
B000065U1N|5.0|Well, maybe one would give Saving Private Ryan or Patton that nod, but for my money this film is *the* best war film ever made.  Its astonishingly realistic and detailed, and chronicles the events and political context of our presence in Mogadishu in pristine fashion.  If you have ever wanted to know what it might feel like to be an elite soldier trapped in a hostile situation with seemingly no way out, this is the film for you.  The film highlights the bravery, valor, skill and outstanding training of the elite in our military... 18 of whom did not get to come home that day. <br /> <br />If one thinks this film is racist you are digging very, very, very deep and ending up with a skewed view of the film that could only be born from intense hatred of war, America and anybody who signs up for the Armed Forces (which in total is far more diverse racially than New Hampshire).  The context is 100% correct, bottom line, end of sentence.  Somalia was a nation full of oppressed people, we went there to try to fix the problem and the color of the indigenous people was IRRELEVANT.  Interestingly enough, those same people that try to make that vapid and wholly ignorant case about this movie are the same people that didn't criticize President Clinton when we went to Kosovo - apparently its okay to kill people as long as they are white, eh hypocrites?  Those are the facts, neg away if you like.  Deal with it.
B000089CJI|4.0|In the world of music, there are always surprises in store. Indie, underrated or overlooked, you can say anything about The Postal Service but they are certainly a rare find.<br /><br />Give Up is a sublime piece of pop, rock and electronic music, producing an almost updated sound to the synth-pop of yesteryear made popular by Depeche Mode, New Order and others.<br /><br />Clever arrangements and upbeat melodies fill the CD, packing in afew mellow tracks in between to give an ambient feel. Gibbard's vocals complement the songs perfecly with an almost impish innocence. The lyrics are often simple but never shallow. Some of the most heartaching lryics go like this: \\"Will someone please call me a surgeon who can crack my ribs and repair this broken heart that you're deserting for better company?\\" And that's part of the beauty of The Postal Service.<br /><br />Perhaps like what the record label is called. This is sup-pop music. Fab.
B00009V7P8|4.0|People annoyed with Rice's vocal range need to relax. Who says you have to have some classical voice to be successful singing songs? You write lyrics and music and then sing with all the passion you can muster. I believe Rice succeeds. Nice tunes to drift with.
B00009W0U4|1.0|My thoughts about this movie had very little to do with its quality. Frankly, it didn't matter how good or bad this movie turned out to be... that went right out the window, 15 minutes into it.    Im annoyed, the DVD didn't come with enough warnings. I have never seen such a gruesome movie in my life, and I've seen just about everything at my video store. Im not \\"faint hearted\\"... but this... this was borderline traumatising. The images are stuck in my head as I write. I hired the DVD cause Belluci was in it and there was nothing else to see. So im sitting there with a few mates... and bam!... this thing just hits us like a tonne of bricks.     The beginning almost made me throw up... and it hadnt even started yet... the camera swirls around until you feel real nausea... and just when you're about to dry reach... this guy gets his arm snapped in half... and before you can squint... another man gets his face bashed violently.... Now i dont mean... bashed until his bloodied and bruised... I mean his maxilla (face) caves in, and his brain comes out... It looked so realistic... my heart was honestly pounding...    The next few minutes was a blur... I was debating with the guys to just turn it off. I wish we did... then came a gruesome 10 minute rape scene... stuff I frankly dont care to see... And just when you think its all over and you're picking what's left of your sanity off the floor... the guy beats Belluci until her face is splatterred across the concrete.     The rest of the movie is pointless.     I really really hated this film... and someone needs to stress how gruesome this movie is. Its documentary style 'tell it like it is'... is too much.. its traumatsiing... this needs to be communicated... specially when the DVD is creeping up onto shelves all over video stores right about now with Belluci looking seductive as ever on the front cover.     There is no point for us to analyse/discuss the moral/social/philosophical issues behind this movie... because its too traumatic, and depressing to think about. It sucks you so deep into its turmoil that you become a victim of it, rather than an outside observer.      Last time I felt like this, was when I stupidly witnessed an Iraqi beheading clip. And really, in hindsight, how different is this from that expirience. And why would I want to expirience it. We spend our lives trying to avoid and protect ourselves from such horrible encounters. We know its bad. Are you pleople that bored with your lives that you need to resort to watching snuff.     (Some people cut themselves to induce emotion). Are we at a point in time where mankind welcomes and embraces this kind of assault onto oneself for mere excitement\entertainment.      Watching A movie is like needles pinching nerve and muscle tendons, to inspire some sort of emotion. It can be relaxing, atmoshperic, thought provoking, entertaining. This movie is like a knife straight through the heart. Maybe I've still got a bit of life left in me to NOT need this sort of adrenaline pumping through my veins.
B00005JCAA|4.0|Communications tycoon, Bill Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) has everything.  He's got a business he's built from scratch with his own hands and ideas, two daughters he loves, and many friends.   <br /> <br />He's also got angina and a voice talking inside his head.  When that voice finally manifests, it's Death alias Joe Black (Brad Pitt).  Mr. Black is ready to make a deal.  Parrish gets a little extra time if he'll be Death's guide to life.   <br /> <br />Parrish accepts the offer.  Death discovers he has far more to learn than he thought.  <br /> <br />This is a wonderful thought provoking drama that leaves you with a good feeling and tears in your eyes.  Brad Pitt, who I didn't think could act until this movie, even holds his own against Sir Anthony Hopkins, which is no mean feat.  \\"Meet Joe Black\\" is a film you'd want to buy and occasionally view again.  Every time I do, I get some new insights.

0316172324|3.0|The premise here is how we make quick decisions with little data; some of these decisions are suprisingly accurate,some, not suprisingly, quite inaccurate. As to the former, there are examples of art historians who can spot well executed  frauds at a quick glance and pshycologists who can watch small snippets of spousal conversations and very accurately predict who will or won't be married fifteen years forward. As to the latter, there are examples of how people make bad decisions based on the unconscious use of racial and sexual data. One of the final chapters on how some specialists have learned to read facial gestures using a scientific method by analyzing specific muscle movements is, as I recall, adapted from a more extensive and more interesting article which appeared in the New Yorker several years ago. I would recommend the article over the entire book. When I finished this book after a few hours, I realized there was a lot of filler--some of the stories seemd interesting but not connected to the overall theme. As an example, there is a chapter on a talented singer who, for some reason has not been able to catch on. As I read this, I thought the chapter had little bearing on the subject matter and it seemed to me that Gladwell was using his book to see if he could ignite this singer's career --that is using his audience to see if it could generate a tipping point, the theme of his last book. <br />   In all the book has some superficial appeal; it moves around to a range of stories which are not well connected. Some chapters are very interesting without regard to their connection to the overall theme and there is very little information explaining how the \\"blink\\" phenomenon operates. <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|I have been through all rock music has had to offer since 1969, and I believe this album would make it into my top 25.  What brings such merit?  Any number of things.  The band has shown a continued advancement musically while retaining some sense of its originality.  From the catchy title song, \\"American Idiot,\\" to the frantic and punkish \\"St. Jimmy,\\" each tune has something different to offer.  There isn't a weak song on the album, and while it is extremely difficult to pick a favorite, mine would be \\"Jesus of Suburbia.\\"  Like other bands that have stood the test of time, Green Day moved to another level of accomplishment with this album.  I highly recommend you add it to your collection.
B00005JN0T|4.0|This is not your father's \\"I, Robot.\\"  As the final credits explains, this movie has been \\"inspired\\" by the works of the late sci-fi grandmaster Isaac Asimov.  True, the three laws of robotics are clearly spelled out during the opening credits, yes, there are characters named Del Spooner, Dr. Calvin, and Sonny, but pretty much everything else is a traditional, modern summer blockbuster take on the \\"misunderstood good cop against the system\\" story.  They even have the infamous \\"give me your badge\\" line! <br /> <br />However, this is not necessarily a bad thing.  Firstly, they have a nugget of brilliance by taking ideas from Dr. Asimov's works; secondly, they have a charismatic lead action star in Will Smith, who has buffed up considerably for this role (as a matter of fact, we see just how \\"improved\\" he is during an extended morning wake up scene right at the beginning of the movie); and finally, the special effects, although clearly CGI at times, are extremely well done and well integrated with the action. <br /> <br />Mr. Smith plays Chicago detective Del Spooner, who harbors a deep distrust and resentment towards the now ubiquitous robots in 2034 Chicago.  The script reveals via flashbacks that Spooner had a previous run-in with a perfectly well functioning robot that lead to less than perfect consequences.  Every time Spooner brings up his issues with robots, everyone around him raises an eyebrow and mention the inviolate three laws - and if you don't know them by now, you are probably locked up in a cave somewhere without internet access anyway ;-) <br /> <br />However, Spooner's fears seem to become reality when Dr. Lanning, the father of robotics, dies in an apparent suicide.  It seems that Dr. Lanning, played by the always exceptional James Cromwell, flung himself through a window in his 31st story office, where he was by himself...along with some robots.  Coincidentally, US Robotics (not the defunct modem maker), the company which Dr. Lanning founded, is about to roll out its newest robot model, the NS-5, which is smarter, has improved facial expressions, and can be updated wirelessly.  That an NS-5 robot named Sonny becomes Spooner's main suspect in Dr. Lanning's death raises the stakes considerably for all involved. <br /> <br />Dr. Susan Calvin, played by Bridget Moynahan, is assigned to assist Det. Spooner in the investigation.  She was a colleague of Dr. Lanning, and an in-house US Robotics expert in robot behavior.  Of course, there is the requisite suspicious industrial multi-billionaire, played surprisingly well by Bruce Greenwood given his brief screen time. <br /> <br />The movie includes some amazing set pieces, such as rollicking, physics defying clash in a freeway tunnel (just don't ask why the freeway is absolutely empty but for the key players, and how can a car do THAT, no matter how futuristic - I guess the screenwriters, too busy with the laws of robotics, forgot about the laws of physics), huge warehouses full of robots, and an amazing final showdown. <br /> <br />The video quality is beautiful, and the DTS soundtrack is, for lack of better words, powerful, with plenty of action for the surround speakers.  Special mention must be made of the set designs, where a near-future urban metropolis is realized in believable fashion - I applaud the decision NOT to have flying cars in this future city. <br /> <br />All in all, if the viewer does not sit down expecting a brainy, complex sci-fi movie, she will be more than satisfied with this movie.
1592400876|3.0|It is curious that someone so fastidious about punctuation should be so insensitive to style. This book is littered with awkward, inelegant and banal turns of phrase which some of us consider a greater crime against the English language than any solecisms of punctation. This is surprising given that Lynne Truss herself is a novelist. Though perhaps not, bearing in my mind the state of the modern novel. She also has a tendency to write whole words in upper case for emphasis (I find italics preferable for this purpose) which is far more visually grating than an accidentally dropped comma. <br />As mentioned by others, this book has many desperate and laboured attempts at comedy, most of which fall flat. She says, for example, of the rennaisance inventor of modern punctuation (whose name I forget) that 'she wants to have his baby'. This just about sums up the chick-lit level of the writing. <br />The book does, however, contain some interesting thoughts of modern punctuation and its history. Much of the confusion about commas, she explains, comes from a dissonance between its two historical origins, as a breathing pause and a need to clarify sense. This was new and valuable information to me. <br />She also sheds some light on those baffling twins the colon and semi-colon. Dismissing the notion that they are weightier than than a comma but lighter than a full-stop (or period in the USA), she strongly (and, in my view, correctly) advocates their continuing usage in English. <br />The apostrophe, in particular, raises her ire; yet after a long period of griping, she concludes than some usages are a matter of personal preferance. This is not strictly true; the answer requires some subtlety on the part of the writer and depends on the sound of the word. Should this book, for example, be called Lynne Truss's or Lynne Truss'? I would say Lynne Truss's in this case, though 'st. James' park' sounds better to my ears than 'St. James's'. She is annoyed by people placing apostrophes into plurals, but later admits that some words simply do not look right without them.  <br />The main value of this book has been to raise awareness of punctuation and grammar in a time when it is considered relatively unimportant. She rightly realises that a well-punctuated passage can greatly contribute to the flow of an author's style. Good punctuation, however, cannot compensate for a style so lightweight and threadbare as Lynne Truss's own.
B0006B2A2E|5.0|I didn't quite know what to expect when I popped this movie in my player, because none of the categorizations I have seen apply so far.  I don't even know where to begin as far as category is concerned, but really, that just doesn't matter.    This movie pulled me in from the first moment.  Jim Carrey's beginning solemn narration is like listening in to the minds of most people.  Simple, honest, and pulling at you in some way you can't define.  I have always been a HUGE Carrey fan, but I was blown away by how brilliant he was in this movie.  He completely captured the essence of Joel.    The best way I have been able to describe this movie is this:  It's about a man who tries to erase Clementine (Kate Winslet) and their painful breakup from his memory, only to realize he can't erase the love he felt for her from his heart.
B00005JNEI|5.0|This film is unbeleivable, not only does it show the true lies about Bush and his stooges (RICE - POWELL - RUMSFIELD - CHENEY AND ALL THE REST), but also how stupid some Americans are about their own Gov'mnt. Michael Moore has done an excellent job  and I dont care if he has made money from it. 2nd point, if this film is a lie then why dosnt the likes of Condy Rice take Mr Moore to court? I let you decide that if you have any sense. Great insight into the ILLEGAL WAR, great footage of SADDAM TAKEN DOWN ( EVEN THOUGH TEN YEARS EARLIER SADDAM AND RUMSFELD WERE BEST OF BUDDIES).
B000008LOU|5.0|The Traveling Wilburys, was the short-lived Superstar of Group of Tom Petty, Bob Dylan, Jeff Lynne and the late greats George Harrison and Roy Orbison.   They only produced 2 official albums, the first generally being the preferred of the two.  Not to take anything away from Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1, it is a fantastic album, but I think Vol. 3 is the better of the two. <br />   Although the first has more hits, some of the songs after a while can get a little stale (just a little, it is a fantastic album).   Vol. 3 however is a CD made up of 11 solid rock songs that don't get stale even if in constant play.   Although every track on the album is fantastic, the four that really stick out to me are \\"Inside Out\\", \\"If You Belonged to Me\\", \\"Devil's Been Busy\\" and \\"Poor House\\".  <br />   Any fan of Vol. 1 or a fan of any of these superstars solo careers, MUST get this album.   It truely gets better everytime you listen to it.   Good luck finding a copy at a reasonable price, but if you do, you will not regret it.
B000006O7C|5.0|Jeff Buckley was a beautifull guy, inspired composer/poet, great guitar player, wonderfull and versatile voice, he had troubled issues with his short memories of his father, the also great 70s musician and saddly late Tim Buckley from who Jeff inherited his natural born gifts, Buckley were sorrounded by a variety of influences that determined his talent characteristics , smiths, Leonard Cohen, MC5 , Chris Cornell, Genesis etc. this influences are also evident in the records he made, booth official and not official, is important to remark the way he impressed his own influences for example Mr Leonard Cohen, commented in one ocasion about Buckley cover for Halleluya included in his first album \\"grace\\", \\"I wrote the lyrics but definitelly is a Buckley song\\" , this simple fact can give to you an idea of how great was Jeff, \\"My sweetheart the drunk\\" was destined to become maybe the second Jeffs album to be inducted into the list of 100 greatest rock albums of all time followed by Grace that was the only album that Jeff had the time to complete in life, you can appreciate here the musical evolution and maturity he had reached at the time , for some strange coincidence since the release of Grace , Buckley seemed to have a constant soncience of his own mortality, you can verify for yourself in cuts such as \\"last goodbye\\" and \\"grace\\", in Sketches great songs were also recorded, \\"yard of blonde girls\\" , \\"witches rave\\" , the amazing \\"Everybody here wants you\\" and the most beautifull song i consider he have wrotte in his whole life \\"Morning Theft\\" my favorite, cd two is a compilation of 4track recordings home made he created wich despite doesnt have the necesary quality that regular recordings offer, are good enough to enjoy the genious and sensibility that Buckley for a brief happy period of our lives gived to us. saddly now we dont enjoy the company of Jeff Buckley anymore, we have a few years missing more awesome recordings he could made for us, how much did we loss? i dontknow but we all are sure that we are missing a lot. <br />HM
6305949980|5.0|This is why DVD was invented...to give viewers a closer look at the film and how it was made. This DVD has everything a TNBC fan and aspiring animator could dream of, from character development sketches to pre-production animation tests. The film-to-storyboard comparison alone is worth it even if it is only for a small section of the film. It is a friendly reminder of how much planning goes into making an animated film, before any frames are even recorded. Just a script and lots and lots of drawings. The other bonus materials highlight the \\"tweaking\\" that occured during production, really bringing you in to the artists' decision-making process. Fun fact: Jack Skellington's legs are so thin that early animation tests revealed \\"strobing\\" problems in the film. The deleted scenes are fascinating, and reveal unknown plot twists (spoiler alert: Oogie Boogie = the evil scientist in disguise). The inclusion of Tim Burton's early short films \\"Vincent\\" and \\"Frankenweenie\\" is the icing on the cake, and its clear upon seeing them that Mr. Burton had been nurturing the character and style of \\"Nighmare\\" long before it was made (look for Jack and Sally look-alikes in \\"Vincent\\"'s nightmare sequence) . Besides all these wonderful bonus features, the movie is a classic must-see.
B000002KXO|4.0|When asked why was this album called 'Mirage' in 1982, Christine McVie, with her typical english humour, replied \\"because that's what the band is now\\". One feels that isolation in the album, and concludes that it was probably broken only when the extense tour to promote it was over. The album happened as the result of coincidences, since (as it would be the tonic for at least three more upcoming Fleetwood Mac albums) it was going to be a solo Lindsey Buckingham album, in which he, almost confused by the mixed reviews that the raw and experimental Tusk album (1979) had gotten through the press, the fans and even the rest of the band, was wanting to return to a somehow 'popper' approach to the music, without leaving the experiments in its entirety. He took the role as the producer of the recordings of the band (formally, as he already was the main producer since he joined in), and the arrangements were, as always, in his hand. Stevie Nicks was saying, prior to the release of Mirage, that it was going to be 'Rumour-esque'... and it's clear that it was the attempt, although the results were not as succesful, mainly because the quality of most of the songs was far inferior than the ones we could find in Rumours, and because this albums sounds more fragmented.  <br /> <br />Still, the results, even though not as brilliant, are not bad at all. The tight and strong rhyhtm section that gives the band its name (Mick Fleetwood on drums and John McVie on bass guitar) is still there... and in song quality terms, the album is saved, especially because of the two women in the band. Singer/songwriter Stevie Nicks was already beginning to have a very own shining star as a solo artist, having released her wonderful album Bella Donna in 1981, but her loyalty to Fleetwood Mac was untouched and she remained a member of the band after a few dates of a solo tour to promote her own release. But one feels that she was somehow 'punished' for her success, as she's only allowed to perform three of his numbers in this album. She manages to shine, nonetheless, since \\"Gypsy\\" is one of the best songs in her album, and even in her whole carrer, an astonishing travel to her youth, and projecting it with suggestive metaphores (\\"lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice\\") to her troubeled present. \\"That's Alright\\", a simple country-ish rock ballad, is another of the high points on the album, showcasing some of Stevie's roots; and \\"Straight Back\\" has to be one of her most underrated rockers ever. It could have used a little more guitar, and perhaps that's the way they'd work it out nowadays, but it is still a great song, with brilliant witchy imagery and strong harmonies by Christine McVie, in one of the few duets between the two women of Fleetwood Mac.  <br /> <br />Speaking of keyboardist/singer/songwriter Christine McVie, her songs are also strong and competent. With \\"Only Over You\\" being a track that I ALWAYS skip (the only one by her at that), at least two of the others (\\"Wish You Were Here\\" and \\"Hold Me\\") deserve extreme praises. Whilst the first one features a haunting melody, vulnerable lyrics, a great lead vocal and ends up the album with an oh-so-powerful guitar/piano duel with Buckingham (and it's injustly underrated most of the times), the second one, a huge hit single around the world thanks to its own merits, is a vocal duet with Lindsey Buckingham which proves just how good do their voices sound together, when joined by a catchy melody and the impressive bed of arrangements that Buckingham prepared for the ocassions. It is one of the anthems of the 80's rock. \\"Love In Store\\" was also a single, which featured touching harmonies between Nicks and Buckingham, but was a little bit weaker in terms of lyrics. <br /> <br />From Buckingham's side we get two REALLY good songs (\\"Can't Go Back\\" is a short and simple way of showing desperation and dispair with very well-crafted short verses; and \\"Eyes Of The World\\", in spite of the never-ending repetition inthe chorus, is a rocker that works out perfectly as a crowd-pleaser), another pleasant one (the meaningless but catchy \\"Book Of Love\\") and two that help the quality of the album to become lower: \\"Oh Diane\\", a terrible attempt to pay tribute to Elvis Presley or another 50's idols (strangely enough this was a succesful single in some european countries), and \\"Empire State\\", which is not helped that much by the weird instrumental background and the terribly bad lead vocal. He did explorations in terms of sounding, of course, in both his songs and the songs by the girls, and that's what we thank him a lot for.  <br /> <br />A mixed bag, really. You'll really like some of the songs in this album, and you'll probably hate some others. Plus there's the problem of the horrible mastering that this had to suffer in the transference to CD, which lets the mix be only partially audible throughout the songs. This needs urgent remastering with bonus tracks (there are lots of studio outtakes; rehearsals like \\"If You Were My Love\\" or \\"I've Been Loving You Too Long\\"; B-sides or hidden songs from the sessions like \\"Cool Water\\", \\"Goodbye Angel\\" or \\"Teen Beat\\"; alternate versions of songs from other albums like \\"Smile At You\\" and so on...), and one really hopes that a reissue would help this album to be more appreciated between fans. For now, buy this version only if you're a really big Fleetwood Mac fan. If not, there are always the compilations to get the hit singles. Oh, and by the way, the title of the album was really an idea of Lindsey Buckingham's aunt.
B000002HRE|3.0|I have to admit, this album has grown on me in the time I've had it. It has its share of great songs, okay songs, and terrible songs. It has a more unique sound than Load, but not as many good songs. Although I think Load was more enjoyable, I'll probably end up giving them close if not the same ratings. <br /> <br />Song by song: <br /> <br />Fuel: It seems like everyone loves this song but me. Good adrenaline, not great lyrics, merely average. 7/10 <br /> <br />The Memory Remains: Again, like Fuel, everyone seems to love this song; however, I really don't like it that much. The lyrics are better than Fuel's, but \\"na na na na\\" part turns me off to the song. Very good beat, good riff. 7/10 <br /> <br />Devil's Dance: In my opinion, the first standout track of the album. James' vocals come out with a sort of cocky aggression, and the music and vocals just come together right. The song succeeds in what it tries to do. 9/10 <br /> <br />The Unforgiven II: I was scared when I saw they tried to make a sequel to The Unforgiven. But it's not a terrible song by any means. Good lyrics; however, I don't like the guitars in the chorus. Very good singing on James' part. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />Better Than You: I'm not sure what to say about this song; it seems perfectly mediocre. Not great lyrics, singing, or music, but it doesn't particularly fail in any aspect. I don't like the vocal effects in the chorus, though. 6.5/10 <br /> <br />Slither: You'll either accept this song, or hate it completely. It's not anything like anything Metallica had done up until this point, though it's not quite the weirdest song on the album (that's still coming up). I don't mind it, personally, as the music is good, the lyrics are okay, and the vocals aren't bad. 7/10 <br /> <br />Carpe Diem Baby: I hate Metallica using the word \\"baby\\". That said, it's probably one of the better songs on the CD. Good lyrics, decent riffs, and a sound representative of Load/Reload's laid-back sound. 7/10 <br /> <br />Bad Seed: This song doesn't quite live up to the others. The lyrics are okay, the vocals sound somewhat forced, and the music isn't great. 5/10 <br /> <br />Where The Wild Things Are: The weirdest song on the album. Co-written by former bassist Jason Newsted, this song is weird in every definition of the word. But it works. The vocals, lyrics, and music work together to make a genuinely eerie sound that works better than most songs on this album. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />Price Charming: Nice, fast beat. The vocals and lyrics don't quite live up to the music's quality, in my opinion. It's still not a bad song; like Carpe Diem Baby, it's simply 90s Metallica. It isn't quite as good, though. 6.5/10 <br /> <br />Low Man's Lyric: A good, though strange sounding ballad. I'm not sure how to describe it; the lyrics are about a homeless man, and the guitars are very soft throughout. It works, but gets tiring after a while. 7/10 <br /> <br />Attitude: Not good. The lyrics just don't work, and the vocals don't sound great. The music's okay, but the song comes across as sounding quite forced, much like Bad Seed. 5/10 <br /> <br />Fixxxer: Save the best for last, I guess. Much like Load, this album ends with an epic, long closer. Everything just works right on this song; it starts out slow and somewhat soft, then comes out heavier. The lyrics work well, and the vocals which are the standard of Load/Reload fit into place perfectly. The song sounds good, means something, and ends a mediocre album in a spectacular way. 10/10 <br /> <br />If I could give it a 3.5, I would. But I don't feel as if I can round it up to a 4. It's a good album, but probably not for hardcore 80s Metallica fans.

B000055Y0X|5.0|The genius of this film is that it spans all generations in its key scenarios. Sometimes comedy masks reality by disguising the syntax in humour. For instance, the depiction of lunatic military and political leaders stands throughout history. Look at today's situation. War prosecuted in various places around the world; for what reason? To enhance the business of the military-industrial complex as much as anything else. So what if thousands die? Yes, shocking but not suprising to realise that the same fruitcakes who ruled the world then, rule now. Why not take the late Carl Sagan's advice and spend the $trillions on exploring the universe rather than bombing people not so different from us? Or as aka 'Elvis Costello' so eloquently put it: 'Why are we shipbuilding when we could be diving for pearls?'
B00005JNEI|5.0|F 911  hits the bullseye dead on, and then hits it again repeatedly for the next 90 minutes. Critics be damned, The Prez and his cronies hang themselves here with their own sound bites, none which are edited out of context, and none which are monkeyed with by Moore. What you have here is another Michael Moore painstakingly researched documentary (like all his others)with no filler, and since the 911 Commission's report has been released, no points to question, or called by some, outright lies. The facts are there for everyone to see, and hear, but some won't accept because of some false political ideology, or worn out political dogma. But they are here, folks. Straight from the commander in chief's mouth, and memos, and press conferences. Step right up folks and see the President sell the public a bad bill of goods. Some say it's not a documentary. WRONG! Documentaries HAVE to have a point of view. If it doesn't it should be called the evening news. F 911 is explosive, and outright depressing in the way the current administration are willing to go to war so the \\"powers that be\\" can make lots of easy bucks. Moore has balls, no doubt, big brass AMERICAN balls.
B0006IIPIK|3.0|I have to confess to finding this movie very difficult to review for a number of reasons, the main ones being the extremely implausible and silly plot, and some bad casting. I think people will either love or hate this movie, with little chance for middle ground, but whichever way you fall, you have to admire Writer/Director Kerry Conrans, vision and resolve in getting this (his first movie) onto the big screen. This is a loving homage to a bygone era of Biggles, Saturday morning heroes, 50's Sci Fi movies, and the Wizard of Oz. It is fantastical, tongue in cheek, inventive yet predictable but somehow it's just TOO much of a mixed bag for my taste. The complete blue screen CGI production gave Conran unlimited artistic licence, and the effects are impressive, even if they are almost a pastiche on old Sci Fi flicks, and serial cliffhangers. The trouble is that he has deliberately shown them as special effects, the sepia drenched resolution throughout, and not exactly seemless matching of live action with CGI is obviously on purpose in trying to emulate the back cloths, rockets on string, and dodgy effects of the aforementioned films, on which this is loosely based. If (and it's a sizeable IF) you can embrace this idea, you will love the movie, but the average viewer will probably be completely misled by the trailers, DVD sleeve, and advertising, and think EH?. It helps to understand that Conran spent 4 years at home on his own computer making 6 minutes of screen time of this mythical \\"World of Tomorrow\\" and that was enough to sell the production team and actors. That said, most of the talent is wasted with the exception of Jude Law as the sprightly gentleman \\"hero\\" of the title. Of course, the script was not exactly taxing, and the supporting cast have adapted the role well, but Gwyneth Paltrow trying to be a female Indiana Jones style intrepid reporter was simply a job of bad casting, or was it? - perhaps this too was designed to mirror the often wooden performances in old B movies?<br /><br />This is not a bad movie, but it's really not one thing or another, and came across as a bit of a mess I felt - It'll probably hold your attention until the last reel, but my advice would be rent before you buy. I often watch movies many times, but one viewing was about all I could take here.in old B movies? <br />This is not a bad movie, but it's really not one thing or another, and came across as a bit of a mess I felt - It'll probably hold your attention until the last reel, but my advice would be rent before you buy.

B00005RHGL|5.0|I have watched this movie so many times that I've lost count!!! As an old western buff (with favorites like Gunsmoke, Have Gun Will Travel, the orignal Return of Frank James, etc), I first watched this movie out of curiosity.  I did not think that a modern day western could possibly match up to the powerful guns of yesteryear.  How wrong I was!  Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer shine in this movie, and Kilmer makes Doc Holliday a lovable character, even though the real Holliday was anything but.  The story itself did not totally match the true lives of the characters, i.e. the violent relationship between Doc and Kate in real life was replaced in this movie by a 'girlfriend/boyfriend' type situation even though, clearly, Kate's desire was Doc's demise.  <br />All in all, Tombstone, in my opinion, is one of the best movies ever made.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and although the budget was much lower than the 4 hour Costner movie, Wyatt Earp, which was released around the same time, Tombstone blew it's competition out of the water!  Hands down! <br />It is a definite 'must see' not only for western lovers, but for those who enjoy good action movies.  You will not be disappointed. <br />
1400032717|4.0|I read the book in about 2.5 hours. It's cute, it's touching, it reminds us of our failings, the innocence of childhood, the things we take for granted daily, the hopes we put into relationships that fail us, that good intentions aren't enough, that there are many uses for garden forks, etc. This book is very creative.  <br /> <br />I don't understand the reviews that degrade the book because it doesn't accurately describe autism or Asperger's syndrome - that is not the point of this book. Nor is this book like Rainman which severely simplifies autism. The author never even indicates what the boy has. This is a fictional novel for goodness sake.  <br /> <br />I did get a little tired of the boy's point of view in the middle of the novel but this was excellent because it really put me in the place of his parents, having to deal with it every day. It helped me understand their actions.  <br /> <br />At the very least, give the book a try because it is a fast read and it is very creative. Whether you ultimately like it or not is a matter of personal preference but it won't take much time to find out and you will get some great ideas from its inventive approach. Ultimately, it will prove worthy of a few hours.

B0002858YS|5.0|After seeing Somebody Told Me, I knew I was curious about this band that called themselves The Killers. It was a wonderful song, but I hoped I wouldn't buy the record just to find that song their \\"one hit wonder\\"-esque track. I didn't. The Killers are a breath of fresh air from everything else out there, and their CD has gotten me excited about music again. I recommend wholeheartedly that you give this band a chance and I urge you to look for their b-side tracks online and give them a listen as well. Some of these tracks have a different flavor then the album, but all are beautiful. Some especially show off Brandon Flowers' wonderful voice, and these songs should help you either a) decide if you would like the album or b) help tide you over until the next album arrives.

068987474X|1.0|My sister and I both read this book yesterday and after raising 3 children apiece with our high school sweethearts who both suddenly want to be free - and pay no alimony -  we found out that our husbands just weren't that into us from the beginning. <br /> <br />Oh they chased us for years and proposed to us and there was never anyone else but... you know if a guy is INTO you he wants to do things you're doing. We wanted to raise our children and looking back on it, they really just wanted to have sex without that drag on their reality. <br /> <br />After years of hearing horror stories of men leaving their wives for other women over and over - a national plague, I consulted professionals with doctorates in psychology about my own husband - not these fake LPCs running around today - and you know not one of them said, \\"He's just not that into you.\\"  <br /> <br />What they all said was... he had the emotional maturity of a 5-year-old.  <br /> <br />Maturity. Now that's a word you never hear mentioned in these books by guys telling women why men don't like them. <br /> <br />Further sociological research turned up this fact, which is much more interesting than the book: that the lack of church influences that used to force men to grow up on moral grounds, combined with new grossly unfair alimony/child support laws are actually encouraging  men to stay immature  and think of women only in terms of sexual satisfaction! That's an old idea revived! Dates back to the middle ages! <br /> <br />These new power imbalances are actually keeping entire GENERATIONS of men at this 5-year-old level of maturity, spawning a flood of pornography, infidelity, web sites on how to get a divorce secretly, and sending a message to our male youth that there's nothing more to a relationship with a female than sex.  <br /> <br />Guys - ask yourselves: would you really feel comfortable telling your DAUGHTER when her husband ups and leaves her with his babies for another woman...  <br /> <br />\\"Honey... I'm afraid he just wasn't that into you?\\"  <br /> <br />If you don't, then maybe there is something wrong with the maturity of the guys who wrote this book.
0553801546|5.0|Robin Hobb creates truly wonderful, engrossing characters whose lives and relationships are created with superb writing. Several readers have expressed dissatisfaction with the ending of the tale.  But do you really feel like its an ending when you get there?  Some do, others feel there are many things left just a little too tidy (and very bitter about it, they seem).  However, people of the Fool's kind live a long time.  Would it be fair that he should see his Beloved's death?  Likewise, if you recall, Skillmasters tend to be long-lived.  So what a twist of Fate, that Fitz would be in that role instead.  And where do you think Fitz would go to live out the rest of his long, unambitious life?  Lots of things left to think about. And write about.  Maybe from the Fool's perspective?  Now that would be worth reading.
0743424425|5.0|Most horror books I read don't get me anywhere near getting scared, but while reading this I just couldn't help it. It starts off a little slow, then it begins hinting at major problems in the future. The suspense becomes almost unbearable. Then everything just goes wrong.

B00000099Y|5.0|I don't normally go to the trouble of doing reviews unless they are to the extrem in either direction. <br /> <br />This album is worthy of a 5 star rating.  The compositions by Tool are mindboggling.  Rich layered textures, deep lyrical introspection, vocals of uncompromising creativity. <br /> <br />Individually, these guys are not noted for their \\"Trailblazing\\" exploits, but collectively they create (and support for that matter) art of the highest calibre.   <br /> <br />\\"If they're this good, why aren't they on the radio\\" you may ask....  They're not on the radio because of the length of their compositions or (most commonly) due to lyrical content, and by contract, they will NOT re-engineer their music to be \\"radio friendly\\". <br /> <br />Granted, I'm a Tool listener, but I'm also a listener to many other artists that are good.  They're just not *this* good. <br /> <br />In addition to the wonderful music, their discs, liners, and covers display a wide array of artistic tastes, albeit unusually dark in retrospect.   <br /> <br />But as a previous listener observed, listen to this disc at least 6 times before you begin forming an opinion.  I have owned it for YEARS and still enjoy it every playing. <br /> <br />I hope this helps.
1878574590|5.0|This one of the best written graphic novels, which would not come s a suprise to anyone who has read any other works of Frank Miller.  This story is one you can read over and over again.  Nothing beats the character Marv.  For all fans of Frank Miller, or Daredevil, Watchmen, the Punisher, the League of Extrodinary Gentlemen (the comic) or just graphic novels in general I recommend.  Though if you have low tolerance for nudity or violence or swearing in any form, I would not suggest this comic, but fo everyone else...have an awesome time.  Also, a major motion picture is being made of 3 different stories of the 7 series Sin City comics (one of them being this one).
B0002DB52M|5.0|To put it plainly, there has never been a more eloquent film made than \\"Dogville\\".  I knew very little before seeing the movie, and know very little now, of the film's director and writer, Lars von Trier.  The mega-talented cast (of which includes Nicole Kidman, Lauren Bacall, James Caan, Patricia Clarkson, Paul Bettany and more) is what compelled me to check it out, and thank God for that.    What is important to convey first is that this movie is unlike any other with regards to set design and stage direction.  There are few props besides the clothes that each character wears, and little more than a large black room with white outlines on its floor in the place of walls and doors, trees and roads.  This will put many potential views off before they even begin watching the film - I know, because I hardly had interest in such a bizarre arrangement myself... no doors?!  You've got to be mad, Lars!    Watching this movie puts a new perspective on cinema.  If you become as submersed in the film as I have, you'll likely never see another movie the same way again - a new angle is opened up.  The angle of a character's emotions becomes the central device rather than action shots or props commanding your attention.    Grace (Kidman) is a wealthy woman on the run from gangsters when she stumbles across a quaint town full of honest, hard-working people willing to save a ravaged soul like hers.  What we find is that those who are willing to save us can be just as apt to annihilate us for their own survival.  I might say that this movie features the greatest twists I have ever seen develop on screen, but they're far more than twists, they're erratic developments of unfathomable and philosophical proportions.  If you let it, the power of this movie has the capacity to blow your mind.    \\"Dogville\\" is an examination of the human condition, as seen through the eyes of a small American town, located somewhere in the Smokey Mountains.  The way these humans react to guilt, desire, and threat can shock the views' soul to the core.  It's a profound experience to see emotion running so raw, so vivid, and so extreme.  I never knew that a movie could so acutely replicated sincere expression - the things that happen to each character are so very real that we not only witness, but experience it for ourselves.    It has the ability to pull your eye lids open farther than any other instrument can.    This is the movie that knocked \\"Citizen Kane\\" from atop my favorite films list.    BREATHTAKING.    Grade: A+

Put it this way; if this sacd disappoints you, take the surround sound back the store and forget it. The music takes you on a trip from the beginning to the end. A very good chill out album after a rough day at work. Pop the top off a cold one, and take the phone off the hook.. that's all that needs to be said. ;-)

B00003CXCT|4.0|It seems  that its quite hard to hate Star Wars, for what amazing innovation and thought went into the creation of the universe and the characters that exist more than just their actions, but their emotions and opinions make them for literary then they should have been. This makes Star Wars so unique.<br /><br />As far as the new DVD trilogy, I think that the Special Features disc was excellent. I thought that the changes Lucas decided to make were HORRIBLE, at best.<br /><br />One of the most prominent ones was the switch of Sebastian Shaw to the new boy in the prequel trilogy, a very, very sad move. It is possible to see Lucas' thinking, which was shortsighted, at best. Since anakin must become 'good' or 'light' (supposedly impossible, becasue 'once on the path of the dark side, forever will it dominate your destiny') so the YOUNG Anakin must be portrayed. I, on the other hand, think that by having the AGED Anakin, we see that in the end, the great Skywalker realizes his crimes and disillusionment.

A single unit is much greater than the sum of all its individual parts, and this stellar truism is manifested magnificently in Peter Berg's sensational film FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS.<br /><br />Again, I love football, and I particularly enjoy football movies that capture the grit and dark hubris of the sport, but this film stands alone in its overwhelming ability to portray a game, a west Texas town, its residents, its players, and its shameless addiction to the gridiron to a degree that transcends every single facet of human existence.  In a community intoxicated with football, in a culture intoxicated with football, in an infrastructure that lives, eats, breaths, and sleeps football, the 1988 Odessa Permian Panthers are about to embark on a spectacular odyssey that will catapult and devour them at the same time:  a magical, mystical season taking the coaches and players up and down the peaks and valleys of high school sports nirvana.<br /><br />This is a film that garners attention to itself for infinite reasons.  A great story, based on a bestselling book.  Cinematography second to none, thanks to Tobias A. Schliessler, that gives the movie its gritty, handheld, \\"documentary\\" feel.  A fast-paced, action-packed, totally believable series of scenes, augmented by an absolute killer soundtrack.  And acting--oh yes, some very convincing, authentic, been-there-done-that acting.<br /><br />As great as this film is, it is enhanced by the talents of the players who bring west Texas football to life before our very eyes:  Lucas Black as a scowling, brooding, ultimately insecure quarterback Mike Winchell; Derek Luke as the budding NFL superstar \\"Boobie\\" Miles, whose knee injury derails his career and summons one of the most poignant scenes in the film; Jay Hernandez as steady, reliable Brian Chavez; and Billy Bob Thornton as Coach Gary Gaines.  Thornton is a gifted actor, but this is perhaps his best role, as he portrays a man obsessed with getting his team to the pinnacle of success--yet disgusted with the one-dimensional, win-at-all-costs mentality of his current gig.  Thornton is flawless; he does exceptional work.<br /><br />Three other characters moved me, and moved me considerably.  Perhaps, because I can readily identify with all of them.  Garrett Hedlund plays Odessa tailback Don Billingsley--a troubled soul because his father, a former jock (Tim McGraw) refuses to accept his son's perceived inattentiveness and does nothing more than relive his own glory days two decades before.  I know so many men who suffer exactly from the same malady, and could readily identify with the character, despite his shortcomings.  Yet, at the end of the film, when troubled father and son reconcile problematically, I was very much affected.<br /><br />Finally, I identified with \\"Preacher,\\" the stoic, silent, solid defensive end from Permian, played by a somber-faced Lee Jackson.  He went through the hell of two-a-days, saying nothing.  He went through the trials and tribulations of the regular season, saying nothing.  He saw games won, games lost, players come, players go, but still his resolve was not shaken, and at last--during halftime of Permian's game against very formidable Dallas Carter for the state championship--he released his fury and anguish to his teammates to fight and scrap and persevere, the character rose above the din and ruckus to prove, very admirably, how sports is, once again, a splendid microcosm of life.<br /><br />FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is a whirling Texas twister of entertainment.  The film is priceless; the DVD extras remarkable.  This product is quality entertainment, top to bottom.  Highly, highly, highly recommended.<br /><br />--D.

B000001EEN|3.0|I always had a soft spot in my head for the original 1973 'Rainbow Concert' album - Clapton, in the midst of his heroin addiction, was helped out by a cast of famous friends who together turn in a loose, touching, and sometimes dessicated performance that captures the era as well as other druggy, haunted post 60s documents, like the Stones' \\"Goats Head Soup,\\" Traffic's \\"Shoot Out At The Fantasy Factory,\\" and Lou Reed's \\"Berlin.\\" For the so called cd 'upgrade', Jon Astley has committed - and multiplied - the same revisionist sins that marred the Who's box set, utterly transforming the original performance and the album that resulted from it. This cd has more than twice as many tracks as the murky, dark original (6, clocking in at under forty minutes), but 5 of those tracks have been severely shortened, and many of the unreleased tracks are suspiciously short, clean and neat sounding as well. Example, the deliciously sleazy sounding \\"Roll It Over\\" has been cut from 7 minutes down to four; \\"Little Wing\\" (with Ron Wood's beautiful lead soloing atop Townshend's slashing chords)has 2 minutus lopped off the original 6:32. Etc, etc. Thus, the 1995 cd remaster (and, 'remix')is utterly different in sound, mood, and spirit from the more honest original album (and cd, which went out of print in the mid '90s).  It's a shame, for now we have to own both the 1973 album (issued just a few months after the Dominos' \\"In Concert\\" and providing a fascinating, stark contrast) and this silly, cleaned-up 'medley' of the Rainbow shows to hear most of the songs Eric and his friends played those dark winter nights in January 1973. Maybe we'll get a full-length \\"Deluxe edition\\" on 2 cds? It would make more sense than the recently issued, padded \\"Disreali Gears.\\"
B00063MBU8|5.0|I am a sp fan. I love this cd. if your a sp fan you should get the cd. My fave song on this cd is track 8 everything. and i also like track 2 welcome to my life. So i highly recomened this cd.
0316168815|2.0|This book was really interesting in the beggining but it totally fell apart and dragged on in the middle.  The ending straight up sucked.  It seemed like she just totally ran out of ideas.  I don't know, I didn't like it at all.  I thought this book was totally over rated.
B000002B1M|5.0|This is clearly one of the most under-rated rap albums (next to Big L 's ''Livestylez Ov Da Poor And Dangerous''). On tracks like ''the message'' , ''street dreams'' , ''take it in blood'' , ''suspect'' and ''if I ruled the world'' , Nas delivers some of the hottest lyrics since Illmatic (the greatest rap album of all time). <br /> <br />Nas 's flow is one of the illest , his rhymes are classics and thats why he's one of the Top 3 MCs of all time. DONT SLEEP ON THIS HOT LP. Niggas under-rate this album just because its not as greate as from Illmatic but its still better than every Jay-Z alubms EXEPT Reasonable Doubt. Cop it NOW.
B0006IIPIK|4.0|First off, you CAN skip the previews. Hit the chapter advance button and you'll skip to the next preview. True, you can't hit the menu button, but this is better than some Universal DVDs from a few years back. Still, it's something that has kept this DVD from getting 5 stars.<br /><br />The DVD itself contains your run-of-the-mill features. A 2-chapter featurette that goes over how the director started making a 6-minute short and how he eventually was able to pull together all the elements needed to make this movie that plays homage to a by-gone era. There's also a gag real and deleted scenes section. But, that's about it. Hence, the DVD itself, coupled with the previews, would give this a 2-star rating.<br /><br />But, the movie itself brings the entire package to 4 stars. I myself love special features, but I usually watch them once. What  Kerry Conran has achieved is nothing short of brilliance. Sky Captain, played by Jude Law, must try and save the world from a mad scientist and his giant robots. The story itself takes place somewhere between WWI and WWII.<br /><br />The story has so many plot holes, even Jello would flow through it. There are so many inacuracies in the story, some might start shaking their heads in disbelief. But it all serves a purpose. Sky Captain plays homage to movies of a bygone era. From the sci-fi b-movies of the 50's all the way back to the cliff-hanging serials from earlier on, the wooden acting, the halos around the actors, the fuzzy coloring. It all plays homage to movies from an era that I never got to experience except on TV.<br /><br />The plot holes and inacuracies are dangled out to the audience in complete glory. It's done on purpose. Those movies were NOT there to send a statement or make you think. They were made for escapism at it's purest form. Sky Captain is all that and more.<br /><br />For those that just want to escape, this is a movie to add to your collection. It's worth watching over and over again.
B000002KIE|1.0|First of all, the Sex Pistols were all about image and did not have an ounce of musical ability. They only gained fame through their antics and stage behaviour; indeed, if you strip all that away I doubt they would have a fraction of the fans they had and still have today. While not a fan of early punk myself, the two other commercial punk acts; The Clash and the Ramones at least produced solid, memorable music as opposed to the trash the pistols churned out. <br /> <br />I should know because I went out and bought the album. Although I do admit I know little about the early punk/new-wave scene, I could barely listen to a single song on this album with any amount of enthusiasm. 'Anarchy in the UK' with Rotten's vocals and 'Holidays in the Sun' are the only justifiable tracks. While I understand early punk was less about catchy hook-filled melodic 'pop-style' songs, these songs are merely filled with repetitive riffs and lack any semblance of song structure. A good song does not have to be obviously melodic, but the sheer blandless of this album will put any young music fan off 'true' punk for life. <br /> <br />For those just discovering early punk The Clashs' self-titled album is a far superior album. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0006M4SO6|5.0|The Way Up is the Pat Metheny Group's debut offering for Nonesuch Records. Comprised of a single, sprawling, 68-minute composition by Metheny and Lyle Mays - divided into four sections on CD - it is an unprecedented new direction for the band. The lineup is the same as on the live Speak of Now from 2003 - Metheny and Mays on keyboards, bassist Steve Rodby, drummer Antonio Sanchz, and trumpeter/vocalist Cuong Vu. New to the roster is Swiss/American harmonicat Gregoire Maret. While the sound here is instantly recognizable as PMG, it is dazzling and labyrinthine in shape, sound, and texture. Painstakingly composed, The Way Up also offers large open sections for solo improvisation and group interplay. The work's theme is stated in part one, unfolding gradually as skeletal layered guitars, samples, and other gentle electronics ease the frame into view, Sanchz's drumming creating an insistent pulse. Mays' piano and Metheny's guitar engage in contrapuntal arpeggios and Vu enters haltingly with the actual line before the ensemble engages it as a whole. Brief melodic interludes usher in the longish second section seamlessly, where lyric fragments become full-blown statements, as the band's trademark restrained dynamic slips in unobtrusively before erupting into sheer euphoria with layered, crunchy, and fat six-strings, lilting harmonicas, and trumpets in tandem, all buoyed by Mays and Rodby, who underscore Sanchz's skittering cymbal dance. As it progresses, the band takes more chances, walking out onto a ledge and simply jumping off - while never losing the deep, lush lyricism inherent in the composition's body. The thematic body and the hook at its core are infectious. These, too, open inwardly to an entirely new set of musical ideas in the middle of the section that changes no less than three times in its 26-minute duration. Mays' piano, an acoustic guitar, and Rodby's fretless bass tiptoe ghostlike into part three before Vu once more shimmers and spatters colorful notes across the top in a hush before allowing Maret to bring the entire line into being. Spare, careful, and emotionally moving, it builds until the entire band gels and cracks it into a breezy elegant walk through airy harmonics and slippery rhythms before notions of counterpoint, dense syncopated rhythmic figures ( la Steve Reich), and tight, tense dynamics segue into the final section. Here is where all previous elements come together into a swinging whole. Fueled by Mays' ostinato in the intro, Metheny's soloing winds around the outside, punctuating and stretching it as electronics paint the backdrop. The band locks into the groove before Maret and Vu add banners of expressionistic color. The Way Up feels more like a jazz concerto than anything else. If anything, it may actually be the record Metheny and Mays have been trying to make for over two decades. It is the place between the cracks, where defined genres disappear into a poetic whole and what emerges is something utterly new, guided and inspired by the limitless creativity of the jazz tradition.
B00005AQF7|5.0|No Doubt, the greatest album to ever hit the streets. <br /> <br />The year this album came out, people didn't even have CD-Players. HAHAHAH!  <br /> <br />Everybody would have clips and jack this album. If you had this Tape or CD, you got jacked like 6 times!!!. Greatest CD of all time even the songs that are not classics are still listenable
B00005JNBQ|1.0|This movie is so awful.  There are a few chuckle moments if you think someone getting hit in the face with a steak, or ...well actually that was the only chuckle moment.  I was bored stiff and actually started reading a book during it.  I can't believe I finished it but it certainly wasn't worth it.
B0002IVN9W|1.0|Nowadays the trend in music seams to be taking styles and sounds from older bands and repacakaging them.  It would be okay  if it were only a few bands  but now it seams  that ALL of rock n roll is following that format. except for a few orignal sounds here and there  most of it  is just echoing the 70s and 80s. After listening to this cd i did not feel exicted or inspired, i found parts of it pretty boring. There is nothing special about the band or its music  nothing special at all it just follows all the rock n roll hipster \\"indie\\" trends and follows them real well..which probably explains all the praise and attention this forgetable album has been recieving.
B0006IIKS0|1.0|Way too long.  Way too boring.  Way too narcissistic.  James is selfish.  Lars is well....Lars.  Cries over the pain of parting with his precious paintings while the auctioneers rack up the millions they sell for.  They talk about their feelings and their anger and they talk about it endlessly.  I couldn't even finish it.  Kirk is the only one that even comes close to being anything short of a caricature and even he has to talk about how \\"real\\" he is.  Once you have to start telling people how \\"real\\" you are, you're already too far gone.  And the $40,000 per month life coach is ripe for a twelve step parody on Saturday Night Live.  This is just dreck.  And they poke fun at Jason, which if they were in touch with reality at all, they would know that he's the only one in the band that anyone ever thought had any integrity at all.  Unless you're a total brainwashed Metallica sheep, don't waste your time.
B000001OAA|5.0|Every once and awhile an album comes along that changes your musical taste and your life, and the way you see artists.  I was fifteen when i first heard of Garbage. I had seen the \\"Queer\\" video once, but being the son of a minister I was rarely allowed to watch MTV.  It was probably '96 before I saw the video for \\"Only Happy When It Rains\\" and that song hooked me.  I liked the fast and upbeat sound, but loved the depressing words that were underneath the sugary surface. <br /> <br />I took my allowance down to the music store and got my first copy. (i've had to get it several times, due to over playing) <br />What I heard when i got home was like no music I'd ever heard.   <br />With heavy guitar riffs and seductive singing, Garbage blew me away!  As I said earlier, an album can change the way you look at music.  Before I found Garbage I was listening to the likes of Wilson Philips, Mariah Carey, and (don't slaughter me people!) Yanni!!!  This album let me feel my darker side, unlike the others.   <br /> <br />With songs like \\"Only Happy When It Rains\\", and \\"Milk\\" both of which are beautiful but morbid.  To the anger behind \\"Not My Idea\\" and \\"Stupid Girl\\" to the self doubt in my favorite song on the album \\"Stroke of Luck\\".  This album seemed to have it all.  Even dealing with the feeling of wanting to be something other than what you are, like \\"Fix Me Now\\".  All of these songs hit me at once and after the first time listening to it, I actually cried.  There were other people, adults none the less, that understood my angst against the world!!!   <br /> <br />I stopped listening to it for awhile, taking it on long trips; and putting it in the cd player to sleep to. Then years later, I was really paying attention, and found my second favorite song; \\"My Lover's Box\\".  That was probably '02, and it is almost always in my cd player.  I'll buy an album from one of the hundreds of new rock groups out there, yet come back to this album.  And now with the pending release of the groups 4th album \\"Bleed Like Me\\", I don't take it out of the cd player. <br /> <br />Trust me people, if you want a hard rock album, or even an industrial rock album; that shares the feelings that all humans go through; this is the one.  The only one.  Garbage will never go bad and definitely never spoil.  <br /> <br />
B000084T18|5.0|okay, we all know 50 is on point! enough said...the new album comes out in a few weeks and the rap world is holding its' breath! when i first heard \\"in da club\\" i knew this album was going to be tight. I listen to all types of music and yes JOHN, in your review you said rap is taking over and it's scaring you!! haha! IT IS. heavy metal and all that gothic rock crap is just plain terrible. they talk about rap ruining the black communities?? what about the heavy metal crap that spawned 2 idiots to cause one of the most tragic shootings in school history!? don't hate the rap artists or the music man, go grab your Manson CD, put your headphones on and go jump off a building...cuz heavy metal is dead.
B000002KDS|5.0|Produced by Bob Ezrin, Killer included hits \\"Under My Wheels\\", \\"Be My Lover\\" and \\"Desperado\\".  <br />It's also include some of Ezrin's studio musicians or friends. On this album Rick Derringer was un-credited for his work on \\"Under My Wheels\\" and \\"Yeah, Yeah, Yeah\\".  <br />\\"Be My Lover\\" has that Lou Reed \\"Sweet Jane\\" sound to it.  <br /> <br />\\"Desperado\\" is Alice's way of paying homage to his drinking buddy Jim Morrison. <br />In fact Alice emulates Morrison's voice in this song. <br />Alice said at one time instead of sending flowers I wrote this song. Alice compares a rock star as being a gunfighter. There is always someone who thinks he's better than you and you're always looking over your shoulder at the new gun in town. Alice also inspired by the movie \\"The Magnificent Seven\\". <br /> <br /> <br />\\"Halo of Flies\\" is a big number and spotlights Neal Smith's extraordinary drumming. This song has that suspenseful TV drama sound from the 70's. The character in the song is like Secret Agent 007. <br /> <br />Another epic song is \\"Dead Babies\\" which people have misinterpreted by just reading the title and who haven't listen to the lyrics. \\"Dead Babies\\" is about a child who's neglected and ends up overdosing from medicine she has found in the home. <br /> <br />Which leads into the last song \\"Killer\\" another theatrical song. Alice uses his Jim Morrison voice again in the beginning. As the Killer character gives his confession <br />Once he's caught & is being escorted down death row to meet his fate. You hear the last rites being read in latin while the haunting organ fills the corridors. Then it's followed by a swirling sound as it gets louder and louder then cuts off into dead silence. It sort of reminded me of water drain as the water gets sucked down the pipes. I supposed it could be the killer's life being snuffed out at final execution. During this concert the gallows were introduced as one of Alice's execution. <br />
1592400876|5.0|Truss's surprise best seller demonstrates two important facts: \\"wit and the comma\\" is not an oxymoron, while the much besmirched public appreciates a guide through the foggy world of punctuation as long as it's entertaining. Let grammarians quibble over the finer points, but this is the most encouraging sign guardians of the written word have had in some time. Grammar lessons have all but disappeared in many high schools for reasons teachers painfully recognize, at the same time writing skills have suffered accordingly. It's time to reintroduce the world of comma's, hyphen's, colon's, et. al., to the curriculum -- not in the old way, which too often produced the deadliest sessions on record, but with dollops of creativity and wit. Truss has shown the way. Punctuation may never be \\"cool\\", but neither must it be academe's biggest snoozer. So, grammarians of America, Unite! -- you have a world of clarity to win, and only a gradgrind reputation to lose.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|Hey, look everyone!  It's the first movie to combine all the annoying things in indie films with all the annoying things in Adam Sandler films!  Look!  That kid's wearing moon boots!  That's so funny!  Let's go around quoting it, because that makes it funnier! <br /> <br />Oh my God, Napoleon Dynamite was awful.  Let's list all the reasons it stank with bullet points, since that would be just as lazy as the film itself. <br /> <br />1. There's no plot. <br />2. There are no characters, only people with \\"hilarious\\" quirks. <br />3. The guy playing Napoleon is about ten years older than your average high school student. <br />4. Napoleon is a geek and a loser. <br />5. No really, I mean it.  If I saw him walking down the street, I'd beat him with my boot.  He's not a charming nerd.  He's a moron who walks around with his eyes barely open.  I wanted to run him over with my Accord. <br />6. Oh yeah, the acting was miserable.  But i can excuse that, since the script was apparently written on the back of a cocktail napkin. <br />7. Bringing up numchuks is not a joke.  Putting your main character in an ugly suit is not a joke.  You see, a joke actually has to have a thought behind it.  People who like this movie also think Donal Logue is hilarious on the I Love the 80's. <br /> <br />I hated this movie.  If you're over the age of 12 and you still have your frontal lobe, avoid it.  Go see a good movie, like Sideways or Kill Bill 2.  Otherwise, you're just encouraging them.
B00079FUI6|5.0|I can't stop laughing. I LOVE these insane people. I missed 2 episodes and I can't wait for the season DVD to come out! <br /> <br />Unlike many shows, each episode is part of an ongoing mystery with all the melodrama, intrigue, comedy & insanity you could hope for. <br /> <br />I've never followed any TV show before but this one has me looking forward to the Sunday night airings faithfully.
B00000IL67|5.0|This is a 4 disc set of Alice Cooper which ranges from the early days when they were known as The Spiders then briefly The Nazz to Alice Cooper. Put together by one of Alice Cooper's biggest fan and assistant Brian Nelson who's been w/ Alice since the early '80's. So this box set is filled w/ a lot of unreleased material compared to other artist box sets. This also comes w/ an 80 page booklet which I talk about at the bottom of this review. <br /> <br />Disc 1 <br />Total of 21 tracks this starts off w/ 4 prior Alice Cooper tracks. Known as The Spiders they include 'Don't Blow Your Mind' which is very Rolling Stones influenced. \\"Hitch Hike' a Marvin Gaye song but they covered it cause they heard The Stones sing it and 'Why Don't You Love Me' has that Beatle sound to it. For a brief time The Spiders changed their name to The Nazz (until Todd Rundgren's band of the same name became popular) and came out w/ 'Lay down And Die Goodbye' which they say is very Yardbird's sounding. Matter of fact they say it's \\"Over Under Sideways Down\\" by the Yardbirds. So right then and there you know the top three influences of The Alice Cooper Group were The Rolling Stones, The Beatles and The Yardbirds. These songs are all very well done in showing how the band grew.  <br />Now w/ the Alice Cooper moniker this disc starts off w/ 'Nobody Likes Me' which wasn't officially released until this box set came out. There are other versions of this song most notably in the changeable title bootleg of 'Toronto Rock N' Roll Revival 1969\\" or other titles such as \\"Freak Out Song\\", Slack Alice\\", Snorting Anthrax, etc...  <br />'Levity Ball' was a studio version which wasn't on their first album \\"Pretties For You\\" but they did had a live version of 'Levity Ball'. This song is one of my favorites from their first album \\"Pretties For You\\" which was influenced by Pink Floyd.  <br />Another rare track is 'Call It Evil' which was around the \\"School's Out' recordings noted in the booklet. Michael Bruce says \\"Luckily, the tape recorder was rolling or it would have never been thought of again.\\" Other tracks on this disc came from their first 5 albums from \\"Pretties For You\\" to \\"School's Out\\".  <br /> <br />Disc 2 <br />20 tracks total which starts off w/ five songs from \\"Billion Dollar Babies\\" album and 'Slick Black Limousine' which came out on a flexy disc in Britain's 'New Musical Express' magazine. The was originally titled 'Coal Black Model T' which had that 50's feel to it sort of Elvis sounding. The next five tracks come from 'Muscle Of Love' album which was the end of the original Alice Cooper Group. One of the songs 'Respect For The Sleepers' was a demo from \\"Muscle of Love\\" lp which is where 'Muscle of Love' track developed.  <br />The next two tracks are from \\"Fearless Flash versus The Zorg Women\\" a compilation of artist including the first  solo performance by Alice.  <br />Now starts Alice's solo career which leads off w/ 'Welcome To My Nightmare' album of the same title and ends w/ 'Go To Hell' from \\"Alice Cooper Goes To Hell\\" album. <br /> <br />Disc 3 <br />22 tracks from \\"Lace And Whiskey\\" to \\"Dada\\" albums. This also includes 'I Miss You' which is from the remaining original band (sans Glen Buxton) as The Billion Dollar Babies off their debut album \\"Battle Axe\\" a very good album which didn't get any good air play. Some other songs are from soundtracks such as 'No Time For Tears' was a song that didn't make it on \\"Sextette\\" Alice did w/ Mae West. She decided on the other song 'Next Next' which isn't on this box set.  <br />'Because' the Beatle cover from \\"Sgt Pepper\\" movie. 'Road Rats' from the movie \\"Roadies\\" which didn't included \\"Pain\\" which both songs are w/ Utopia and produced by Todd Rundgren.  <br />Two songs from Alice's \\"Monster Dog\\" movie which have that new wave sound to it. Then the track Alice fans have been asking about ever since they saw \\"Friday the 13th Part VI Jason Lives\\" the song \\"Hard Rock Summer\\". Another rarity is the missing trackthat was listed on \\"Special Forces\\" album 'Look At You Over There, Ripping Sawdust From My Teddybear' when you hear it you know why it never made it to the album. <br /> <br />Disc 4 <br />18 tracks from \\"Constrictor\\" to \\"The Last Temptation\\" albums. You have 2 versions of 'He's Back' one is a demo the other the movie mix, both outstanding versions. Also includes 'Under My Wheels' w/ Guns n Roses from \\"Decline of Western Civilization Part II\\". 'I Got A Line On You' a Spirit cover song done w/ the Alice touch from the movie \\"Iron Eagle II\\".  <br />T he B-side of 'How You Gonna See Me Now' titled 'No Tricks' w/ Betty Wright an R&B singer. This is the first time Alice ever did anything like this. I thought it was one of the most beautiful songs w/ such soul in it. I always thought this was an amazing song I wish they gave it air play I think no one really knows how versatile Alice can be.  <br />Then you have Alice's mix of 'Hands Of Death (Spookshow 2000 Mix)' w/ Rob Zombie which is different than the version on w/out the \\"Rosemary Baby\\" sound bites that Rob spliced into his version on \\"Songs In The Key of X: The X Files\\" CD.  <br />Plus you have the 'Is Anyone Home?' from Alice's \\"Fistful of Alice\\" which was the only studio song from that live recording CD. <br /> <br />Includes an 80 page book that gives you insight to each track. You have comments not only by Alice but by the original band members as well as other musicians who worked on the songs. The introduction is written by John Lydon which also contains quotes from many artists such as Slash, Lemmy, Joey Ramone to name a few. Also this book includes tons of pictures that show all stages of Alice Cooper. Each disc sleeve has the Alice of that time and on the opposite side features a 45 sleeve of that era. Again this a must for any Alice Cooper fan. <br /> <br />This is one awesome collection of Alice tunes you can have in your collection. Of course people may complain not enough of this and to much of that. Ithink Brian Nelson did a an outstanding job of picking and selecting the material. I bet it took plenty of time sifting through all the material which we'll be hearing more of during other CD re-releases in the future. <br />
B0006399FS|1.0|<br />Bad and getting worse. That's the only way I can describe U2's dwindling career, topped off by this miserable release. How does a band labelled at every turn as complete sell-out's with a dimunitive sound make a comeback in the eyes of the fans?... The answer: They attempt to re-create the once cutting edge sounds of their previous works.  <br /> <br />This album is so bad that it does not merit a worthwhle review. <br /> <br />U2 have sold out, and they will never put anything more out worth listening to, they have betrayed their own fans, and this album shows that they got what they deserve, it's that painful to listen to.  <br /> <br />Buy any 1980-1997 U2 album instead of this mainstream band, and you will be completely satisfied, and even more so knowing that your money is not going to help already rich corporate rock sellouts.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000006XSD|2.0|During Alice's period of heavy addiction of drinking, partying and watching tv came \\"Lace And Whiskey\\". Alice creates a new character who's a detective from the 1930's called Maurice Escargot (Alice's answer to Inspector Clouseau).  <br />I believe Alice was getting tired of the Alice Cooper character and wanted to separate himself from Alice. Using Maurice Escargot was another character Alice tried to introduce as a film noir concept album with tracks like \\"Lace And Whiskey\\", \\"It's Hot Tonight\\".  <br />It also could be seen as part autobiographical \\"Road Rats\\", \\"I Never Wrote Those Songs\\". \\"Lace And Whiskey\\"  album included Alice's third hit ballad \\"You And Me\\".  <br />Alice still gives us humor with \\"King of The Silver Screen\\" and cover song from 1956 \\"Ubangi Stomp\\" which he does his Elvis impression.  <br />I think \\"Crazy Little Child\\" from \\"Muscle of Love\\" could of fit into this album. <br />The musicians again are the same since \\"Welcome To My Nightmare\\" with Alice's co-writer Dick Wagner and Producer Bob Ezrin.  <br />It's not one of my favorite Alice albums but has a few gems in it such as \\"It's Hot Tonight\\", \\"Lace And Whiskey\\" and \\"Road Rats\\" which inspired the 1980 movie \\"Roadie\\". <br />
B000001EAQ|5.0|<br />What happens when one of the most popular bands in the world gets bored with mainstream rock and roll?  <br /> <br />It creates Pop.  <br /> <br />Pop was just the most bold and exciting chapter in the band's  career. Like its predecessors, the album is consistent, clean and superbly produced. U2 has mastered the ability to stay near its simplistic roots, yet successfully venture bravely and enthusiastically into new realms of rock.  <br /> <br />The sound-shaping journey began more than a decade ago, when studio genius/producer Brian Eno helped U2 create The Unforgettable Fire, derailing the group away from the more accessible sound of Boy, War and October.  <br /> <br />The incredibly successful The Joshua Tree, the Euro-trash romp Achtung Baby and the bold and technically creative Zooropa followed, as U2 cemented itself as one of the highest-profile bands of this era.  <br /> <br />Enter Pop, a smooth and creative effort that delves deeper into a world of tricky rhythms, funky bass-lines, distortion and sound effects. The title itself almost mocks rock and roll, further evidence of U2's efforts to break free from the mainstream and explore techno, electronic chaos, sampling and digital manipulations.  <br /> <br />A scary concept, perhaps, for fans who long for the rock precision of The Joshua Tree. But before wary listeners dub Pop a complete leave of absence, energetic album opener \\"Discotheque\\" will set cautious minds at ease. The song is a magnificent blend of techno glitz and gritty guitar, reassurance U2 hasn't forgotten the forceful riffs and driving rhythms that fueled its rock stardom.  <br /> <br />The subsequent tracks are a concoction of experimental gems, such as the distorted, soul-searching \\"Wake Up Dead Man,'' the Achtung-ish \\"Gone,'' and feel-good rock anthems such as \\"Do You Feel Loved'' and \\"Last Night On Earth.''  <br /> <br />Pop stays consistent throughout, almost to a flaw. Yet it contains enough subtle surprises -- hear the grindingelectric guitar in the dynamic \\"Mofo,'' the trip-hop wizardry in the sedated struggle \\"Miami'' and the soothing wind chimes in the dark and lustful \\"If You Wear That Velvet Dress'' -- to keep things interesting.  <br /> <br />Musically, U2 has always tried to stay ahead of the pack, and while Pop is their most necessary album they`ve ever made, the group had once again left the mainstream far behind - at least until their horrible ATYCLB. U2 cuold do it, the band had proven its staying power.
B0000028PI|5.0|One of the most underrated albums to be released since \\"DADA\\" It was produced by three producers Andy Wallace (one of the best), Don Fleming for Instant Mayhem, and Duane Baron and John Purdell (I know that's four but the last two worked together). Also the last recording with Epic label. <br /> <br />In 1979, Bob Dylan release his most Christian album \\"Slow Train Coming\\" which caused stirs in the music business among his fans. <br />In 1994, Alice moves into a moral aspect theme and this will be a new stage that Alice will be heading into for now. Being raise in a religious family Alice has biblical references as far back as his first album. What do you think \\"Fields of Regret\\" was about in \\"Pretties For You\\" album? But this will be not just one or two songs it will be the major theme of the album. \\"The Last Temptation\\" can be viewed on different levels and you don't have to take it as a repentance album. Temptation comes in many forms spiritually and physically. This is taking Alice back in doing a concept albums since last one was  \\"From The Inside\\"  1979 album.  <br /> <br />Alice also reprises the Steven character from \\"Welcome To My Nightmare\\" days. Steven is a teenager now dealing with temptations that typical teenagers are bound to come across which are basically pare pressure in the three basic themes sex, drugs, and money. Alice also collaborates with writer Neil Gaiman who's known for his graphic novels most noted \\"The Sandman\\". What they both came up with was a Three part comic book. The comic book illustrations are done by Michael Zulli. The first issue would be included with purchase of the CD, cassette or album. The other two issues you would have to go to your local comic book shop. The comic book comes across more on a higher level of temptation as the songs are written could be interpreted on both spiritual and physical realms. Some of Alice's guest who co-wrote were Chris Cornell (Soundgarden), Tommy Shaw (Styx, Damn Yankees), Jack Blades (Damn Yankees), Brian Smith (Beat Angels).  <br /> <br />\\"Sideshow\\" written by Alice and The Beat Angels gives the carnival atmosphere as in \\"Here We Ago Again\\" from \\"Welcome To My Nightmare\\" album.  <br />I can't help but think of Dylan especially the \\"...and the hunchback midget and his twisted friends...\\" line. <br /> <br />\\"Lost In America\\" is so simply written it reminds me of an Iggy Pop song. <br /> <br />Two songs written by Chris Cornell are \\"Stolen Prayer\\" and \\"Unholy War\\". Alice altered some lyrics on \\"Stolen Prayer\\" which made it as co-writer. \\"Stolen Prayer\\" is an excellent song and Cornell's background vocals give it that extra feel to it. <br /> <br />Alice's ballad \\"It's Me\\" which is very well written. <br /> <br />The final song \\"Cleansed By Fire\\" which Steven triumphs his temptation. <br /> <br />What's great about this album is you can play any song and it stands up on it's own as well as in the story.  <br />
B000065V9Y|5.0|US lets Gabriel examine the emotional ups and downs of relationships. Starting with the plaintive cry for communication on \\"Come Talk to Me,\\" US takes the listener on a journey through the passion,(\\"Steam\\") playfulness, (\\"Kiss That Frog\\")and the pain (\\"Digging in the Dirt,\\" Blood of Eden\\")of life's great challenge, our ability to love and what can happen when it doesn't last. The music's softer here than on his earlier work; it has a meditative quality befitting the subject matter. The emotional depth here is stunning; Gabriel allows you to feel what he feels. A daring example of an artist whose willingness to share his turmoil has resulted in a moving experience.
B000002I99|5.0|Released in 1975 on Atlantic Records this was the 27 year old's first solo record from the original band. Alice and his Manager Shep Gordon have both sunk all their life savings into this project. It was going to either make or break them. Luckily it was successful and provided Alice the fuel he needed to step out on his own. Alice wanted to get more into the theatrics than he usually did in the past albums. If \\"Muscle Of Love\\" album talked about New York then \\"Welcome To My Nightmare\\" could be one of the shows that appear on Broadway.  <br />Produced by Bob Ezrin with the use of some of his studio musicians he used in the past such as Dick Wagner. The backing musicians were Lou Reed's from \\"Rock n Roll Animal\\" and \\"Berlin\\" albums which was produced by Bob Ezrin and consist of Dick Wagner and Steve Hunter on guitar, Whitey (Pentti) Glan on drums, Prakash John on bass. \\"Welcome To My Nightmare\\" included Jozef Chirowski and Ezrin on keyboards, Tony Levin on bass, Johnny Badanjek on drums, Summerhill Children's Choir and special guest star Vincent Price for narration which in 1982 Michael Jackson would use Mr. Price for his \\"Thriller\\" album. <br /> <br />\\"Welcome To My Nightmare\\" is a full fledge concept album. Unlike Alice's previous albums this one had all songs related to the theme of the record. Alice greets us on the first title track  <br />\\"Welcome to my nightmare, I think you're gonna like it, I think you're gonna feel like you belong...\\" <br /> <br />\\"Devil's Food\\" leads into \\"Black Widow\\" as Vincent Price is the Curator explains the deadly bite of the Black Widow spider. <br /> <br />\\"Some Folks\\" is the Broadway number of the album.  <br />As \\"Only Women Bleed\\" starts out as the very first ballad of Alice Cooper who would have three more ballads just as good. It's interesting to note that when Alice recorded this song it was taken around to different labels and no one knew it was Alice's voice. One label even thought it was a new James Taylor song. <br /> <br/>\\"Cold Ethyl\\" is a collaboration of \\"Refrigerator Heaven\\" that was on Alice's second album <br />and \\"I Love The Dead\\" from Billion Dollar Babies album. It has cyber cryonics and necrophilia. <br />\\"...Ethyl's frigid as an Eskimo Pie, she's cool in bed, she's oughta be cuz Ethyl's dead...\\" <br /> <br />\\"Years Ago\\" and \\"Steven\\" are the most haunting songs that'll give you nightmares. Alice's sings these 2 tracks with a voice of an innocent child. Is Steven actually a child or a man <br />\\"Steven\\" has a Liszt piano notes that raises the hair on the back of your neck. <br /> <br />\\"Escape\\" is the final song as Alice escapes his nightmare was co-written by Kim Fowley and Marc Anthony. Fowley known for working with The Runaways and Anthony worked on a track with Ezrin who produced in 1976 \\"Destroyer\\" by Kiss. Which is very similar to \\"Welcome To My Nightmare\\" especially if you listen to Kiss's \\"Beth\\" track. <br />Another artist practically pattern his own album after \\"Welcome To My Nightmare\\" with Vincent Price as guest speaker and a ballad as well. This album is known as \\"Thriller\\" by Michael Jackson. Quincy Jones was quoted as saying they needed something on MJ's album and that's when they brought in Vincent Price after hearing him on Alice's album. <br />
B0001MDP3G|4.0|Saw COLD MOUNTAIN last weekend. And - dang if it didn't stick as close as a movie can to the book itself. I was mighty impressed.<br /><br />Everyone did a lovely job - although the chemistry between Kidman and Law was ... watery. Renee Zellweger was astonishing as Ruby. And my favorite surprise was recognizing Kathy Baker as a woman who loses everything. The same Kathy Baker who plays the seductress neighbor in EDWARD SCISSORHANDS. She was painfully beautiful in her role in COLD MOUNTAIN. Oh - and until I read the credits, I didn't even realize Natalie Portman was in the mix.<br /><br />Anyway ... definitely not the feel-good hit o' the winter, but still watch-worthy.
1572814748|4.0|This deck is a very nice travel size. I even like the little card holder. The only thing I did not like was that they were very difficult to shuffle. The reason the cards are so difficult to shuffle is the card stock seems just a tad thick and the major reason is because the cut is not clean. They are quite staggered. I got a sharp razor and very carefully began lining them up and shaving about 15 at a time gradually, over and over, shuffling then starting again. After I got them very close to the same sized the shuffle was much smoother. On a lighter note the coloring and detail are excellent. I am glad I got the cards, I just wish the stock and the cut would have been better.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Last evening - F911. If y'all have never gleaned, I am not terribly informed on a political basis and typically just steer clear of discussions in politics. I have no basis but emotion and intuition on which to place most of my discussion.<br />[...]<br />I am still absorbing so many of the longstanding connections to all the wrong folks that this family has and how designed the presidency of Dubya is and continues to be.<br /><br />And it just puts an awful lump in my gut when thinking about 9/11 and how much that man and his family have actually benefited and profited from that day's events.<br /><br />Then, on DVD we watched VERONICA GUERIN, which was also an amazing film.<br /><br />And both left me feeling like - against such big meanness - what can anyone one person do?
0385504209|4.0|I definitely enjoyed this book more than Angels and Demons. For me, time seemed to linger by and moved so slowly to accommodate the events. I can understand now the controversy that the book created as it hits a major belief of Christianity.<br /><br />I enjoyed it because I think it was intended, as Sauniere wanted it to be, a puzzle for his granddaughter to discover the truth about her family. That simple! All the adventures and discoveries that Langdon and Neveu uncovered were part of Sauniere's world, whether they are facts or not, is yet to be unearthed.<br /><br />The writing style is simple, repetitive which I found necessary with all the bulk of information. Brown is clear and although he tries to complicate the plot, it releases itself very naturally in seconds. I could imagine Langdon thinking and rushing from one place to the other, now I feel I need another trip to Paris to discover those mysteries on my own or maybe a movie will do!
B00005JNBQ|1.0|I watched this movie because all of my friends said, \\"you just have to see Napoleon Dynamite\\". So I caved in and watched with a few of my friends. I have to say that this movie didn't even come close to living up to my expectations. In my opinion there were maybe one or two funny bits in the movie, but that's it. And the part that I hated the most was that if you took the scenes that actually had something to do with the plot, this movie would have been about 15 minutes long. The main character was genuinely unlikable and painful to watch. If I had to see this movie again I would probably drop alot of acid first, then I might be able to enjoy it. MAYBE!
0140177396|5.0|Book Review <br /> <br />In the book, Of Mice and Men, two men are estranged from society.  They are two nomads roaming throughout the state of California for a farm to live off of.  The two men's names are George and Lenny.  George is a small, keen, bossy type of guy.  George tries to be very independent but one day his Aunt asks him to take care of her nephew, Lenny. Lenny is a contrasting character compared to George.  Lenny is an outcast to society because he is depicted as to be incapable and inferior to American citizens.   Lenny is a tall, robust, mentally challenged human who deep down is very caring and sensitive toward his feelings about George.  Although these two men are lower on the social class structure, they have one thing that many people take for granted, hope.  Without hope these two men would be the stereotypical poor man trying to live their lives day by day.  They find a job on a farm, whose the owner's name is Curly.  While George and Lenny work there, Lenny encounters Curly's wife who he was a life changing experience with.   After Lenny has the experience, George's life will change forever.   <br />          I highly recommend this book for all types of readers.  This book has loyalty, trust, and most of all friendship. This book is very descriptive and paints visualization in your mind of how the characters are thinking and what the scenery is like.  This book keeps you on the edge of your seat just waiting to know what will happen next because it is so intriguing.  The book is all around phenomenal and is a classic for middle school- high school kids to read.  The author of this book shows the hardship and the mindset of each and every character during the Depression.   The only comment I'd like to say about this book is that it needs to be a bit longer.  The book is very short which makes the plot go by a lot faster than it should.  The ending is the best part of the book.  The only way to find out the ending of the book is to read it, but it is a classic.  It will leave you stunned and surprised of how the characters lives play out.      <br />
0060920432|5.0|This is a superb book, with nearly limitless application! <br /> <br />The author manages to lay out in simple terms the core aspects of happiness.  While many of these facets seem simple, it can be incredibly powerful to recognize just how much influence they have over your enjoyment of a particular task.  I have used found these concepts to be especially valuable when it comes to managing people, not the least of which is managing my own career. <br /> <br />Many other books in the realm of personal effectiveness fall short by basing the entire text on the author's anecdotal experience, which ends up turning into meaningless platitudes.  That is not the case here, as the author bases his conclusions on sound research. <br /> <br />My one gripe with the author is his choice to jump to the conclusion that since focus is sharping there is a loss of self.  It would be pretty depressing to think one's own self is what's holding you back.  More likely, I think what we're really giving up is our anxiety.
