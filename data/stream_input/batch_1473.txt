0345803485|1.0|...for the trees that gave their lives to become this book.  It is the most poorly written and banal piece of muck I have ever read.<br />  The female lead is a whiny, simpering, passive aggressive idiot.  She hasn't a single redeeming quality to make me give a damn about her predicament. By the second chapter I wanted to beat her senseless(and not in a fun way).<br />  Our \\"hero\\" is a stalking dullard with apparently 50 shades of pedophilia lurking about his psyche. Jeez, I wonder if he's handsome?  I wonder if he's rich? I wonder what colour his eyes are?  I had a headache from being whacked over the head with those hammers.<br />  This book is one long assault on the King's English and every known rule of grammar!  I believe my sixth grade teacher is trying to claw her way out of her grave to get a copy of 50 and a bright red pen!  I was so distracted by the deplorable construction of this mess that I started skipping the ridiculous sex scenes.  I kept wondering if anything of interest would ever happen.  It didn't.<br />  I wish I had done as another reviewer suggested and made a drinking game out of the the repetition of phrases. This author is queen of echo, ingemination,  iteration, recapitulation, recurrence, redundancy, reiteration, replication, reproduction, and restatement.  Please lady, for the sake of all that is holy, BUY A THESAURUS!<br />  As they say,\\"You can't unread book.\\" That may be true, but I sure as hell am going to try!

0805091742|5.0|This books challenges us to question our methods of dealing with inevitable human fallacy and push ourselves to do better. It's almost like a form of Occam's razor - the simpler approach is the more effective one. Of course, there are times and places for checklists, but the power of communication cannot be understated. Highly recommend!
055358202X|4.0|This fourth book in the series seems to be the culmination of the establishment of the backgrounds of all the main characters and the world in which they exist.  I was at first dismayed at the casual slaughter of seemingly important characters, but it now appears that Martin was simply clearing the stage for the next generation to carry the story forward.  Each of the surviving Stark children seems to be hurtling toward an important role in the game being played across Westeros.  We have Jon Snow now in charge of the Wall.  Bran seems destined to be the rebel king in the north.  Arya is in training with the assassin's guild from across the sea.  Sansa's fate is still a mystery, but my hunch is that she will be a powerful courtesan.  And then there is Danaerys Targaryen, last of the dragon royalty and mother of dragons.  If I were writing this story, by the end of this fourth book I would have all of my pieces in place for the grand finale in book number 5.<br /><br />\\"A Feast for Crows\\" is a bit tedious in places, as is Tolkien's \\"The Silmarillion\\", and I think it is for the same reasons.  The author is creating a world and a power structure as a stage upon which his players will work out the closing acts of the story.  At least I hope that's what Martin has up his sleeve.  If I were writing this story that's what I would be doing.
B004I744AS|4.0|I downloaded this for my kindle fire.  The fire came with the Websters dictionary already loaded on it, but found it really difficult to use since the search didn't take you to the word definition, just to everywhere that word is used.  Mostly it is used by my third grader for her homework and we would get frustrated with Websters which led me to look for an alternative and this app.  It works so much better - the search is super easy and brings you right to the word.  She mostly uses it to confirm what type of word it is (adverb, adjective, etc). I also like the fact it includes definitions for technical and medical terms.  I can see a potential use for that, but haven't used that function yet.  Overall, a much better tool for homework!
0439023491|5.0|Quite compelling. Despite it's potentially depressing content, Collins manages to stay hopeful. And Peeta, while not the exciting, macho hero, gives the good guys a good word and encourages the teenage girl not to only look at a handsome face and an ambitious attitude.
1609613937|5.0|Why do I love this book?  Let me count the ways...<br /><br />First you have it written by THE LEADING EXPERT in nutritional-medical science backed by 40 years of practicing medicine, scientific studies and hard facts, and the thousands of people who have lived his lifestyle program and reversed their maladies. Hmmm, sounds like a winning combination to me!<br /><br />I love that Dr. McDougall has presented us with another new book and not a re-hash of past books, like so many authors' do. He has thoroughly and brilliantly researched the scientific facts and presented them to us in an enjoyable and easy to understand scribe peppered with his famous humor.<br /><br />It was fascinating to read about the falacies of the glycemic index and what actually happens when you consume a diet rich in starches.  Equally as fascinating was the information on diabetes and how to reverse and elimate it from your life.  But, this holds true for other diseases of affluence such as obesity, cardiovascular problems, digestive problems, and the list goes on and on.<br /><br />Dr. McDougall is a giant in this field and many doctors, both young and old, owe him a wealth of debt (and their own health) because they stood on his shoulders first and foremost.  He doesn't get the recognition he so rightfully and richly deserves but he is not in this to turn a quick buck.  He stands up for what he believes in and what he knows to be true to make a significant difference in our lives.  He turns lives around.  He saves lives.  By educating us and giving us the correct information and tools we can then make intelligent and informed decisions related to our livelihood. In my book, this is the real meaning of physician!

B00338QELU|2.0|The primary reason to read a fiction is for its story: plot, character, setting; and not for the lecture.  Although mostly correct and I was impressed by the research on both China and Africa, I was disappointed by the general plot.  Yes, San's suffering was sad, but, at the end, the mass murder was solved only questionably.
B00845MRKE|5.0|...Or it would have been, if you were able to pick it up a year ago or so. Through the latter half of 2011 the blu-ray set of [[ASIN:B000UBMWG4 Blade Runner (Five-Disc Complete Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray]]] was selling for about $30.00. The price was a steal as everything about that set looked beyond beautiful. It also included a fifth disc with the much-talked-about work print of the film. Unfortunately the price on both sets is now quite a bit higher than thirty bucks. As this is something like a quintuple dip, the true time to make this purchase has passed for me. I'll be sticking with my five disc collector's edition blu-ray, as it lacks nothing in picture quality, sound quality or added content. Knowledge is power when spending money. Purchase wisely.

B00003CXCT|2.0|The amount to which George Lucas sucks in damaging his own trilogy is unfathomable.  His ego must be enormous.  To change the films over and over AND totally \\"disappear\\" the originals is an act of breathtaking megalomania.  Change some fine, but let the originals also be sold.  Not to mention the prequels just plain stink.  He should be embarassed and go into hiding.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|I was a bit late in becomming a fan of Mr. Jackson (unfortunately!) so I'm trying to catch up on his works. Hopefully I'll find more CDs to add to my collection; this CD is a great start. I definitely recommend this to other fans--existing ones as well as new ones like myself.
1469984202|5.0|Howdy!<br />I have been reading SciFi for about 40 years. I have read about 1000 SciFi books during this time.<br /><br />Now I come across this Masterpiece of SciFi and wonder why hasn't it always been this good.<br /><br />The story is really about us, isn't it? All the hopes fears secrets dreams and prisons of our world are bottled up inside these Silos.<br /><br />Historically, I have avoided End Of type stories, not realizing how damn uplifting some of them can be. Wool Omnibus is worth more than the asking price. It is premium writing and stands with Dune and Hyperion in that regard. There are very few mistakes and I am hard pressed to remember what they were. I am going to be a reader for a long time I think!<br /><br />If you are on the fence about the subject matter, or the Self Published nature of this book rest assured, you will like it if you are a fan of hard SciFi.<br /><br />It is worth much more than the asking price. It is destined to stand the test of time and become a Classic!<br /><br />Thanks for reading my pitiful review!<br /><br />Dave H.

B000IZ1HP4|1.0|I kept falling asleep and when I awoke the movie was still showing close ups of somebody's eyes.  I'm not sure what editors did in 1968, but this one had no idea what \\"cut to the chase,\\" meant.  If you liked this, you'll like Bullit.  I watched both movies and thought WTF?? each and every time I woke up.  5 stars???  You guys must have seen this at a drive in and been the beneficiaries of some kind of oral gratification for the first time and this simply brings back terrific memories.  Here, allow  me to describe a scene.  Lady shows up at her new home, 20-30 people are standing around, she sees her husband, step daughter, and two step sons laid out on picnic tables, dead, and asks no questions.  Nah, she just walks over and gently fondles a lock of hair from the youngest boy.  She's never met him, just her husband.  No tears, no questions, sounds plausible, right?  I mean, who would think to ask questions at a time like that?  Shortly thereafter, everyone leaves the grieving widow.  It's a complete exodus, probably because she was coping so well with her new dead family.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended to people who want a really long movie with a super minimalist dialogue, and lots and lots of extreme eye close ups.  A real hallmark of motion pictures, as well as stellar acting, the character remains motionless while the camera to zooms in so close, it's nearly identical to a still picture, except it's concept art because, you know, the producer is doing still life with a motion picture camera.  Wooooooo living on the cutting rebel edge.
0439023521|4.0|Great book.  I am 70 years old and wondered what all the hype was about.  A friend had seen the movie and loved it.  And my granddaughter was reading it, so I wanted to know more about it.  I was spellbound and had trouble putting the book down.  I cannot wait to read the sequel.
1609611543|5.0|If you think giving up wheat is going to be easy, think again.  Wheat is in everything!  The third ingredient in tomato soup.....Wheat!  The first two weeks were really, really difficult.  Everyone said that I would feel better, sleep better, etc.  I felt lousy.  I finally made a deal with myself, that I could try going low carb, as opposed to no carb.  It's working.  It's been about 7 weeks and I have lost 14.5 pounds - a dress size.  My jeans are falling off, too.  What a great feeling!  When I do have a piece of bread, it's a chewy, rosemary and olive oil loaf that is a wonderful treat.  I'm experimenting with rice flour, corn starch and similar ingredients to give a crunch coating to fried chicken or sauteed fish.  I'm getting results and I'm buying new cookbooks!  This book isn't magic, but it comes pretty close.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|Movie was new, as described and arrived quickly.  My granddaughter and I enjoyed watching it many times already!  Great way to introduce the older, classic films, especially musicals to kids who are drenched with the Disney Channel.
0345803485|2.0|Wow I am pleasantly surprised by the number of people who gave this book one star. I thought I was the only one who thought the book was subpar.<br /><br />This book is like an abusive relationship. You know its toxic and bad but you make excuses for it. Trying to convince yourself that it'll get better and that its really not THAT bad....but in reality it is.  I bought this book (before the whole 50 Shades mass hysteria hit American women) based on recommendations on Good Reads. Usually the women pick great books so what is it about this book that has made millions of women go insane? I wanted to like this book and I REALLY tried to get into it but I guess I am too much of a snob, because some aspects of this novel I just couldn't get passed and it drove me nuts. I knew when it took me over two weeks to get to page 100 that 50 Shades and I were going to part on bad terms.<br /><br />I agree about the repetiveness of the writing and the dialog. The progression of the story was too slow for me. I kept yelling at the book to get to the point and I'm not even sure what it was! One example was it seemed to take her half the book just to sign the stupid sex contract (and I am not entirely sure she ever did), but t I do know she spent worthless chapters, excessive amounts of dialog and several emails haggling over it.<br /><br />My biggest pet peeve was Ana. She was so mousey and timid that it made her unlikable, I kept wanting her to grow a pair and really stand up to Christian...to everyone for that matter (I've heard that that comes in subsequent books but I can't stick around to find out.). A close 2nd was the way Ana talked! She sounded like a British exchange student living in America. Her slang/vernacular literally made me cringe.<br /><br />Christian's issues with intimacy and his views of sex were slightly more interesting but I just didn't find him appealing as the \\"hero\\". The supporting characters were weak or boring and not in the least memorable.<br /><br />I'll give the book two stars for effort and the sex scenes I got through were definitely original.<br /><br />Sidenote: There is a wait of 436 people at the Dallas Public library for this book!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book, takes you off guard several times. Would recommend to anyone who wants a little something extra in there reading.
B0002VFXFE|4.0|Works but I have seen no noticeable difference in core temp of my processor from the compound I've been using for years. But a good product at a fair price.
1780332009|4.0|The book is bearing a publishing date of 2012, in fact, this is the UK publishing date of the 2006 edition, no more recent info here. This is misleading and it takes forever to get here since it is a UK book.
0345803485|5.0|Wow, this book was the best erotic romance I've read and it's been a while since I've found a good series....I love Ana she's like me and Christian is just if I could pick one word for him it would be DAMN ;) !!! I loved Fifty Shades of Grey cant wait to see what happens in the second book....AWESOME :)

B007V5CF5K|5.0|Great game.  Wonderful graphics, intriguing story line.

B001EGFQNU|5.0|Definitely the sheer number and great choice of music videos on the DVD is well worth it.<br />  If you love O.M.D. as I do, you need to get this for your collection.<br />  I do need to say this though - about Andy McClusky's dance moves on a couple of videos.. it is so excruciatingly embarrassing and absolutely funny to watch.<br />  Hope he could read this, it's just a valid complement. Love the bands' work every single one and on all your albums/remix guys.
B0083GPDBO|2.0|Wish I would have waited to rent this.  Not worth the new release price.  found footage film.  In my opinion, found footage films look cheap.  My low review might be partial to that, however, I found the story line to be nothing great either.

B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Got an additional amount of data this a.m. &quot;required to run on your device,&quot; and the biggest issue I have noticed is that the letters that the other settlers use to provide you with tasks for points is not working properly. When you click on the envelope, it immediately jumps to the &quot;Accomplished&quot; screen. I sort of enjoyed the tasks because it gave your character some kind of goal to work towards. Hope they fix it soon.

B0073LWEXK|1.0|Does not work on kindle fire/cant get past first two items. Not worth the change or the tome it took ti figure out it did not work!
B0072OFOM6|5.0|I only have one criteria for Movies, and that is: do they entertain me and are they believable. This whole series has met those. I too enjoyed how Andy Whitfield played Spartacus, after all he did introduce most that watched the series to the Character for the first time, but his replacement did a splendid job in the role as well. Sit back and enjoy without looking for messages.
0316069906|4.0|Surprising balanced and objective considering it was written by a vegetarian with an agenda. Cleary well studied and considered, although there are places where his statements are biased (but within the normal range of scientific opinion).  If it convinces anyone to not eat factory farmed animals, or to demand more humane conditions for them, it's well worth it.  Factory farming is a moral disgrace for everyone in this country; for those who eat the results and for those who \\"stand by\\" and allow it to happen. Alas, not the only moral disgrace in our food system, but I digress.<br /><br />He does have some convoluted logic and seems to sometimes step on his on points by later points. And he clearly hasn't actually raised chicks or turkeys.  In general, I'd say Omnivore's Dilmena is the better, less biased book. But I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this book to either a vegetarian or carnivore as an engaging way to understand the ugly meat industry.<br /><br />The material is mostly well known and there doesn't seem much really new since the 90s. But I did learn something: just how much bycatch waste there is in fish and seafood industry.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was an lacto-ovo-sometime pescatarian/vegetarian for 8 years (healthy and happy) until we started eating meat we raised ourselves (10 years ago). We don't eat a whole lot of meat, but I believe meat/eggs/dairy to be healthy if not essential foods.
B007EVQAFC|5.0|Disc 1 starts off with great live versions of \\"Brutal Planet\\" and \\"Eighteen\\". The band sounds heavier than usual, a stripped down garage band sound, and Cooper's voice is holding up pretty well!  I wasn't sure whether I wanted yet another live Alice Cooper show, but there are a lot of songs that haven't been on the setlist for a long time. \\"Mr. Nice Guy\\" is raw and punchy with clean LOUD guitar.  \\"Hey Stoopid\\" - from 1990 or so, haven't heard this one in a while An energetic \\"Is It My Body\\", then an oldie not often played - \\"Halo of Flies\\" with the whole song - guitar jam and all. WOW!  Disc 2 opens with the new single, \\"I'll Bit Your Face Off\\" -  a new classic Cooper song, followed up with \\"Muscle of Love\\" is here, along with some other welcome old ones, like \\"Clones\\" (really? Cool!) :), \\"Poison\\" and \\"I Love the Dead\\" \\"Schools Out\\" - of course, and \\"Elected\\"  Overall, a good addition for Cooperphiles, or anybody who would like to hear what the band sounds like these days.
B00846REIS|5.0|This is the story of two broken people who find each other.  It is pretty well developed except for a few places where you go hmm. Like I thought she was from CA but was unclear how the therapist she saw with her mother regularly was in NY. Didn't she just move to NYC.....Anywho enjoyed this story line but truly wish the sequel could be out this summer. Really October!!!

B00633W614|5.0|The first book- Only Time Will Tell was a wonderful read. the second book was not quite as good but put the 2 books together and you have a real treat. and The Sins Of The Father leave a hint that more might be coming.I have told all my friends that the 2 books are a reading must.
B0062P332Y|3.0|This film was supposed to be based on a true story although it is a remake with a different story than the original!  I doubt most of the stunts in this film took place in real life.  This film is the typical, 'trained' killers who are so well trained that they appear almost like super heroes with their fighting skills!  We all know that they can only go as far as their weapons tkae them.  This films is nothing to get excited about. What I really dislike about the hilm is the leader of Oman.  Aside from having the wrong turban on, the Omani leader looked very weird.  He did not look like a natural man.
140053271X|4.0|So I purchased this item after my last ebook reader (Amazon with keyboard)broke in my bag.  So I was between this and the amazon touch and the only thing that swayed me to buy the nook was that I could find for cheaper online.  and I must say that I am very pleased with my purchase.  It is an excellent Ebook reader, I like the fact that it gives real page numbers (though at this point I am sure amazon's does as well).  But I also liked the fact that there are physical buttons in conjunction with a touch screen.  Overall, my reading experience with his device and Amazon is pretty much the same.  The two BIG differences is that the ebook store on amazon is WAY better than the ebook store on B&N (which is a big deal to me) and I like the fact that I can search content on WIFI with the Amazon reader (such as wikipedia).  But in terms of purely reading, there is no difference to me between the two.<br />But when an Amazon ebook reader with a light comes out I am jumping back on the amazon ship....
B005J6LKVI|2.0|If you have seen any 1970's or 1980's film about blacks having been terrorized by whites in the 50's or 60's, then you kind of know what to expect from this.  In short: Blacks are terrorized by racists (was the rule) whites in Jackson, MS, most whites are evil, some actually care, most who were evil ended up caring without traces of evil (although blacks are still the help and whites are the masters!) and blacks have something to smile about in the end - but whites end up looking like saints!<br /><br />This is pretty much what I expected from this film before I saw it and it was as expected.  I know it goes along with the story, but the black leads were so terrified of whites that they anticipated the feelings of the whites, did not talk back, did not think for themselves and were basically slaves in a new era.  This was shameful to watch, but this type of thing was indeed real.  THe actreses (black leads) were great and the acting was indeed worth of Oscars, but they played their parts a little too well, especially Octavia Spencer!  She over-played that \\"fried chicken\\" scene too much.  I would not have played that scene.  With all of the hate from whites, it was shocking when we only heard the \\"N\\" word about once or twice!<br /><br />Of course a feel good film about blacks getting an eas in racism from whites and white seeing some of the light while only one is still a hard-core racist, could not be comeplete without making the black MAN look the most evil of ALL!  We did not see his face, but Minnie's husband was a woman beater and vicious, while the other black males in the films had minimal lines and were all willing servants and scared stright while the black women were strong!  The only strong black man was the woman beater!  This is a trend in Hollywood.  I trend I don't like!<br /><br />The picture quality was excellent and the film itself was great, just much of the content is what I don't like.  Ocatavia Spence reminded me of some Amos N Andy type characters with her eye movements, body movements such as he acting nervous whenever something happened to a white character and he hands almost flailing up as well.  Either she did some great acting or this reminded me of watchin blacks in a 1930's or 40's film!  Sometimes you need to ease up on your performance!

Please ignore the 1 star comments and get this app. (besides if you download it now you wont need the update)
B003EYVXVY|1.0|Avatar has been re-released on 3D Blu-Ray and is available for $29.99 at Local retail stores...DO NOT be fooled into the \\"this is so rare!\\" or \\"Panasonic RARE!\\" gimmick.  I bought mine at Walmart 5/25/2012 and there where still 2 others on the shelf. And yes It is 3D Blu-Ray and not DVD or The old school 3D with the Red/Blue glasses.
B000H6SXMY|4.0|I bought this for my daughter's Birthday It was delivered  quickly and she loves them. Now she can watch the entire series in order.
B00280LYIC|4.0|At first, I only began reading this for the movie, but when I started and started digging into the book, I was forgetting about the movie more and more and began setting this in my own imagination--which became compelling and amazing as the realistic characters embarked on a quest to solve the mystery of who stole Zeus's weapon, the Lightning Bolt, filled with a wonderful twist of ideas between Greek Mythology and Modern Culture as the main character tries to transfer from living a normal, mortal life, to becoming a powerful demigod in the arts of magic. This book was very well thought through and was captivating until the very end. Riordan did his best and brought it all!!!
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|what happened 2 gale? hows mom dealing with prims death? hows annie and the baby after finniks death? how did the games end? hows plutarch after his precious games were distroyed? was the capital really overuled? these are the questions Suzanne didn't answer and will always put an impact on R lives. (plus i hate gale)
1439127700|5.0|Really a great book, a must read for anyone who always wanted to know if the X-Presidents shared their knowledge with the current President.
B004JHYRAE|5.0|So far this book is very good.  I haven't finished it yet but that's only because I have 5 books on the go and it is a challenge to find the time with working night's and sleeping during the day.  Buy it though, it is worth it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This varies of game is ol school fun. The fact that the game holds your points and funds to purchase new games is pretty cool. FUN TIMES!!!!!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|If you were born between 1970 and 1980 , this is a book you HAVE TO read.<br />Feels like watching a 80s flick, and somehow it has the magic of those sci-fi movies. An awesome book from page one.<br />I wish that Ernest Cline would write a sequel.
B0063IH60K|3.0|this app is wonderful. movement of cards is great. game plays well. the only drawback is the advertisement between the games.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Great graphics and sound effects to keep your attention .  I'm addicted to it in both modes. Awesome way to pass time!
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Scoot your TV closer to the screen.<br /><br />ARE YOU KIDDING ME?<br /><br />Just the part when he's leaving the Kremlin is better than 99% of entertainment media!<br /><br />Scoot up and watch the special effects in that scene again!<br /><br />Despite Cruise's seemingly unforgivable person beliefs, he has been the most prolific butt-kicker for 3 decades.<br /><br />I patiently await MI:5.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|This is a good song. If you are in a bad mood put this song on and I bet you it will put you in a good mood. It is one of those feel good songs you could listen to forever.
B0076NKNLA|4.0|But it held my interest from start to finish and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Very entertaining and interesting especially if you're my age (51) and are fairly familiar with the main real-life characters.<br /><br />Very good film making.
0385737955|3.0|I had high hopes for this book considering the number of positive reviews it received.  Unfortunately, I just could not get into the book.  The plot was decent, however I didn't find myself liking any of the characters (except for maybe Minho) which made it hard to care about the situation they were in.  The question I kept asking myself was \\"what's the point?\\"  I found the Grievers to be a ridiculous creation and the language the Gladers used annoying.  There just was not a lot of substance to this book.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Unfortunately every update to the game has created some sort of glitches, large or small depending on where u are in the game.  It is very annoying and it appears they don't play their own game because if the did they would see their own mistakes.  I realize the game is free but the quality has been diminished by these mistakes.
B003KUSUG8|3.0|OK so Eminem's latest solo album isn't my favorite, It's actually my least favorite of his albums. I'm not saying it's bad but it's not my type of music. In my opinion Eminem has a good flow in this album more mature songs and has good beats. Those are the good things but there are many flaws. One I feel that this album consist of 80% love hurt songs. I enjoy a few songs like that but this album is pretty much just love songs. Space bounds the only good one because it has good lyrics and isn't straight bitching about bitches (haha). The rest have a lot of singing which I couldn't stand. Also it seems like Eminem is trying to be like the new mainstream rap (which is horrible). It's like he's just giving people what they want not his style. If you noticed his fan base has turned into a lot of teens and most only like this album. This albums not Eminem at all, I don't mean it's bad because there no slim shady killing and raping but he's forcing himself to have a new style. The songs sound awkward. He's trying to hard and needs to really do what he wants to do. I mean relapse was his style and only came out a year prior. He got out of rehab before relapse so obviously he still has his own style and topics. This album seemed like a test to see how people would take this style. It really is mixed opinions though. if you like love songs about missing people and singing with raping then I guess it's for you. If your a old eminem fan and like good rap topics and I suggest getting the new bad meets evil album.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|great fun with all the cool foods and always keeps you waiting but sometimes it is hard to keeptrack and yoou endnup messing up
1439127700|5.0|Highly entertaining and very informative, « The Presidents' Club » provides fascinating vignettes into how the current and former Presidents, have interacted in their all-boys club.<br /><br />Though I thought I knew everything there was to know about Nixon (and have been trying to forget), the amount of conniving Nixon engaged in after his ill-fated Presidency (sometimes with good results) was news to me. He sought a role as the puppet-master pulling Ronald Reagan's strings (better Nixon I suppose, than Nancy's astrologer.. but that's another story) and frequently succeeded. For all his dastardly deeds, there is no denying Nixon was a brilliant man and an innovative foreign policy tactician. It was amusing to discover he developed a political crush on fellow policy wonk Bill Clinton.<br /><br />I was also unaware what a kamikaze Jimmy Carter could be when he went rogue. His work post-Presidency (which is largely admirable) is interspersed with episodes of Carter trying to conduct a parallel US foreign policy and embarrass the current occupant of the Oval Office - whoever he might be - always in front of the cameras of CNN, his hometown TV channel. Carter comes across as a principled man but bitter and prone to waspish comments (in public) about other members of the Club. An easy man to admire and a very hard man to like.<br /><br />JFK comes across as an enigmatic figure, surrounded by arrogant, inexperienced advisers, whose disdain for Eisenhower comes crashing down in the wake of the débâcle of the Bay of Pigs. A great quote from Ike about Kennedy's commanding that disaster: \\"I don't run no bad invasions.\\"<br /><br />A couple of the relationships that developed into close friendships (across party lines) was that of the instigators of the Presidents' Club (Harry Truman and Herbert Hoover) and the father-son affection that grew between Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush - to the point that in a Bush family photograph, Bill Clinton was included as the other Bushbrothers had decided Clinton was \\"The Brother of Another Mother\\". This goes a long way (in my mind) to explaining Clinton's reticence in criticizing George W. (and how I had wished he would), but also Clinton's view of the Presidents' Club as a support group for the man in the loneliest job on Earth. Though I loathe George W., I have been impressed by his discretion and lack of criticism of Barack Obama since he left the White House. His father (who comes across in this book as the man everybody wants as his Dad - maybe even Barack Obama) taught him well.<br /><br />I was struck by the fact that former Presidents of the same party, don't seem to get along as well as former Presidents from different parties. Sibling rivalry?
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|love this app. finally something I can use when out and about.  Especially. when I'm at a clearance. sale.  or at a restaurant.
B007Z9RAX4|1.0|I gave this movie a full hour to develop and yet it kept dragging. The plot is the usual as other spy double cross movies and it just seemed like it was not going to deviate much from it. Maybe the ending will be good, but I could not take it any longer. First movie in a long time I had to stop watching.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|This album is her best, in my opinion. I played it over and over. I have two of her other albums, but this one seemed to come from the soul, truly. The price from Amazon was more than reasonable and I would recommend this CD to anyone who loves music.
B0063IH60K|4.0|New user. So far, it's my new favorite solitaire app: Clear, colorful graphics. Smooth touch on tablet. Good choice of game options. Would like to see even more game options in future. Thanks!
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This heat sink is kind of difficult to install with just one set of hands but once you get everything in its place, put an additional fan on it (sold separately; comes with 1 fan) and you've got a great heat sink. I use this to cool a 125w 8-Core AMD processor and it usually idles around 66-70 degrees Fahrenheit. Under a load, the processor will not exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit unless you max it out but even still it won't go over by much. I love this heat sink and would recommend it to anyone who is looking to save a few bucks but still wants performance!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Never thought I'd be a fan of young adult stories but I read this one because of the movie. Rekindled my love of reading. Great story.

B007JM4CWY|5.0|A great game. Very simple to learn the rules, but mentally challenging. I enjoy the way the game looks like it is printed on a scroll.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|It's sudoku, minesweeper, and pictionary all rolled into one. Very challenging, extremely fun, and insanely addictive. I definitely recommend it.
B0061S073A|5.0|This app is amazing and just keeps improving with each update! I never worry about letting my kids or grandkids accidentally making purchases, calls, etc. There's also no chance they'll change my phone settings or have access to any inappropriate content.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|This is a great reference book when you don't know what to say. I recommend it to all. Thanks for having it on Amazon.
0062124293|5.0|Come for the laughs, stay for the empowerment.<br />While the reviews compare \\"How to be a Woman\\" to \\"Bossypants\\", Moran has written her memoir with a much stronger feminist agenda.  This is not to say that the book isn't  incredibly funny, it is.  Moran's stories and thoughts kept me laughing throughout,  but she is in your face about the need for feminism, and why we shouldn't be afraid of the word.<br /><br />Most of the book is lighthearted, but she doesn't shy away from more serious aspects of gender inequality.  The piece about her abortion is incredibly frank and honest.  She is clear-eyed about motherhood and the way women are pitted against each other.  The funniest parts of the book are her descriptions of her childhood and early career.  If you were a teenager or twenty- something in the early 90s, you will recognize a lot of your own experience.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent subtle reference to horrors of BIG Government .  Must read all three books.<br />It was suspenseful without being gory. Appropriate for youth ninth grade and up.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I just down loaded this a bit ago and &quot;played&quot; with it for a while. This app was well worth the $0.99 I paid for it. Like another reviewer said, I'll never delete this app.
B001CDLATE|5.0|I've seen several of my top 10 films only once because I can remember almost everything from one viewing. It's rare for me to watch any film more than once except for Baraka.<br /><br />In the past 4 years I've watched this film about 10 times.<br /><br />Baraka doesn't have a word of dialogue; the film communicates its message using the language of imagery, music, and juxtaposition.<br /><br />This isn't an narrative film, it's visual poetry. The viewer is taken across several nations and cultures. The horror and triumphs of the human race are painted across the screen in a beautiful mosaic.<br /><br />The title, Baraka, means `blessing' in Hebrew, Arabic and Arabic-influenced languages. And that's exactly what this film is, a blessing.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and watch this on blu-ray with the biggest screen possible. Even though this film was released in 1992, no other film has matched its cinematography. It's a dream of mine to shoot a film in 65mm or 70mm someday just as Ron Fricke did.<br /><br />Ron Fricke did almost everything himself, the cinematography, building the camera, editing, and the color grade.<br /><br />Oh but that's not all, Mr. Fricke has been working on his newest film over the past 20 years and it's coming out for wide release this August! It's titled Samsara, which means the eternal cycle of birth, suffering, death, and rebirth.<br /><br />Above review was originally published on my blog over at artofthestory.com

B0063GORYU|5.0|Easy to play and free. I can't ask for much more. Ads are minimal and not intrusive. Fun game. I recommend it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Lots of games and lots of fun!!  Games are not hard to learn and are tons of fun!  Some games can even be played by kids.  Try this app. and I'm sure you will agree.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Great gaming fun and a little bit addictive so beware.  Once you start playing you won't be able to stop!
B007L3BMGA|4.0|A good read. This is the second book in the trilogy, and I found it almost impossible not to go ahead and order the third book. There has been a lot of controversy about these books. Perhaps the sex descriptions are overdone, but by this second book I realised that they are an integral part of the life of Christian Grey. You will be surprised as the story unfolds, and will possibly not put it down until it is finished.
0525478817|4.0|This book is depressing. It made me shake with tears at the end. But there are earlier moments of the story when you can't help but giggle out loud. Just don't be in a public place like I was-my parents were looking at me strange when I spontaniously burst out laughing. The characters really sound like teens, no joke. And the love story is so cute. I didn't like how she thought so negativly-definatly not a repeat read for a while because I'll start talking/thinking like a depresed 40 year old, menopauseal woman. I didn't like the ending because 1-we all hated it, lets be honest. And 2-it didn't end @ Gus's death...it went on. I was like \\"WTF why doesn't it end at the sad part like a Nickolas Sparks book.\\" I say that because everything after the death made me start balling. The death itself wasn't sad- but that dang reflection killed me. Also, your sad because the voice in your head knows she's gonna die soon too. Bt I still liked it. Buy and enjoy:)
B007L96SI6|1.0|Like listening to a \\"pirated\\" CD.  Get a new company before they ruin you, Hailey. I couldn't tell ig the music was any good because the quality was so bad. HATED IT!
0439023521|3.0|Ok, don't hate me but I was super disappointed by this book. I was expecting this to be freaking epic. But it is just an average book in my opinion. I think if I werern't an avid reader I would have enjoyed it more. There wasn't enough romance. Now I haven't read book 2 or 3 but I don't think I'll read them becuase I didn't get attached 2 any of the characters. I saw the movie and it was like my 2nd fave movie of all time[behind the Avengers of course].
B0000046KM|5.0|Shirley Horn is the great jazz vocalist least known by the general public.  She is also one of great jazz pianists, primarily as an accompanist to herself.  Here though the piano duties are not all by Shirley.  Nevertheless, this is one of best works, her wonderfully nuanced, soft, slow vocals backed by an orchestra.  This a definite 'must have' by any Shirley Horn fan or someone wanting to discover a timeless jazz CD. Enjoy!
0810989956|3.0|My middle schooler loves Wimpy Kid and I do too so I feel a little bad saying this but here goes. The Do-it-Yourself book is mostly blank pages. The extras added in no way make it with $8 or $10. Looking at the books and using a blank notebook would have been just as effective.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun to play...great graphics...remember the old computer game...this is way better...good job...love it...wish i had more time to play...fun and good time.

I'll never look at my dogs the same way - wish this information would have been around 50 years ago.  Hope shelters and rescues make this mandatory reading!
B004FOA84A|1.0|The game ended no sooner than it started. The developers review should have disclosed the length of the game since they are charging for it and they no the duration.<br />I want to purchase more of these games but hesitant.
0061692042|1.0|I could hardly wait for a new Richard Ford book to come out!!  I loved Indepence Day, The Lay of The Land, and The Sportswriter. Wonderful wit and observations of the times but this book couldn't have been written by the same Richard Ford.  It is a mundane tale of no humor. I really thought it was a terrible book and I would have quit reading it about a third of the way through if I wasn't such a Richard Ford fan and kept thinking the old Richard Ford would surface..to no avail.
0545265355|5.0|Story line in this Trilogy is a must read! The complete set once you start reading doesn't get set down until all have been read. I look forward to the next two Movies.
B00004RCNJ|4.0|When it turned out that they had no more cheap copies of the movie \\"Run Lola Run\\" with no box they not only sent me a copy with a box for the same price but also included a Soundtrack CD from the movie for no exrta charge!
B006UG90RM|2.0|David Lee Roth, what happened to your voice? Ouch. These songs are stupid boring. Can't stand the sound of that snare drum, or is it cardboard he's hitting?
B000R3NNDQ|5.0|A quick to the point book that will get you thinking about your business model. Very helpful for a successful operation to make certain you do not become complacent.
B007N0REX6|4.0|But wow, not a bad album. The production is top notch. I like tracks 6, 7, 8 and 13. The album has some really wild solos. I didn't know Slash was still in his prime. Replace that singer with somebody good and this album would really rock.
B000O8OTNC|1.0|Compact, nice size, take with you, piece of ****, dont do anything for my blades; I wouldnt advise useing this item. Aside from there being many rave reviews for this item, I didnt have such an experience.

0345803485|5.0|I was skeptical about purchasing this book.  After I heard so many women have read the book, I decided to give thebook a chance.  I am glad I did.  I will be purchasing the other two books by this author.  Please buy this book.  A Must Read!!!!
B00328R21C|4.0|My kids always love the lego sets - free shipping a little cheaper than in the stores makes it a good deal.  It does have some different Star Wars characters - which my kids always love to collect.  Shop around and be sure the price beats in store ones.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Works as advertised and seems pretty accurate. Provides me with the forecast and I can even get a radarimage if I need to.
B007BLEKPM|5.0|This is a great movie and went along with the true history of the man, except he did not wear his TuTu. Should of been an Oscar here for Leo.
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|Though short, I believe this review is an important one to read as many of the others are lacking important details. Everyone is complaining about the ending being a mystery. It is no mystery, just watch THROUGH the credits and you will see the conclusion comes on which answers everyone's question. Though there were many parts in the movie that could have been performed better or filmed with more realistic ways I do believe, as per usual, Liam Neeson, makes up for any negatives. His performance is amazing and he stays true to character through the entire film. I believe the main focus on the movie is what it truly means to live. Should a human simply live their life day by day confused and unsure or should they take risks and be willing to LIVE their life to make it worth it in the end, when ever that may be. The inner struggle of Neeson's character is very prevalent and he overcomes many obstacles and grows strong mentally as a result.Definitely a deep story but a movie everyone should give a shot!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Some of the combos seen a little odd, but it is a fantastic game. Makes you think and challenges kids in a good way.
0345803485|1.0|This trilogy is the worst read ever.  She found a few words in the thesaurus and used them over and over.  The character development was elementary at best.  I have no idea how this made it's way to the best seller list but I wish there was a way to get my money back.  The kindle version had typographical errors.  I managed to finish all three books in 4 days and the hope that they would get better as I kept reading evaporated by mid-book 2.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|there are so many games to play it will blow you mind!! you get more points if u continue play the same game multiple times. u should get this app!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008133DO8|5.0|The BBC update of the Conan Doyle stories has been cheeky and refreshing. The unsettling aspects of Sherlock's character that Doyle could only hint at are here brought to the fore as a combination autistic savant and schizoid type. It is brilliant and it works. Watson is a far smarter foil than he has ever before been allowed to be and the adaptations of the stories are for the most part inspired.<br /><br />Irene Adler is working for Moriarty, as in the stories, but here she is much more her own woman and is also a dominatrix. Is she the only woman that can turn Sherlock's head or has he turned hers? It speaks to the quality of the acting that the viewer is never quite sure. Irene Adler holds blackmail materials on everybody who is anybody in England, but she doesn't use them to blackmail, she uses them to insure her continued safety in the world. Until Moriarty wants one secret and Irene manipulates Holmes to get it. The plot is fast and fun and as long as sexual innuendo doesn't offend, pretty stunning stuff. Acting, writing and production values are all top notch and the London of the eye is so nicely photographed, along with Georgian townhouses, that the viewer doesn't miss the gaslight of Victoria's London as much as might be expected.<br /><br />Highly recommended to fans of Holmes, BBC mysteries and mysteries in general. It is also recommended that the original stories be read - not to explain the current offering but for their own sake.
B005723JSQ|4.0|I really enjoyed Sophie Kinsella's latest book. It was cute, fun, and witty. The storyline was good, light-hearted with some aspects of suspense. It was a good travel read.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I got this app when it was the FAOTD and have enjoyed playing it.  With a. little logic you can solve the puzzles in a few minutes.

B007GP1CC2|5.0|What else to give Du Pre but five stars?  The packaging, however, is another matter.  The box in which these recordings are collected is very attractive, but a warning needs to be given to all who purchase it.  The interior container holding the discs is not secured in any way and easily escapes one's grip.  This has already happened to me once and if I don't remember to grasp the container very tightly it is bound to happen again.  Some sort of clip should have been attached to lock this container in place until manually released.
0545265355|5.0|I had been hearing the hype about \\"The Hunger Games\\" trilogy for months (and had actually bought one of the books to give away as a gift) before actually settling down to read it. I found myself very grateful that I had put off the experience until the time in which all three books were close at hand. It must have been a terrible waiting period for those who were reading as each book was published, for Collins has crafted a story that is so fast-paced, so compelling, so addictive, that it's near impossible to put down.<br /><br />Collins gifts are twofold: the first is her impeccable pacing in a narrative where tension builds, things advance, and there is very, very little padding, and secondly, her ability to make a reader clearly visualize a character and care deeply about them after an extraordinarily short space of time. Five pages into the book and I felt as though I'd known Katniss all my life, and I don't think many characters have come so vividly to life on the page for me as the likes of Haymitch, Effie Trinket, Peeta, Cinna, Rue and the other tributes. Their physical attributes, their mannerisms, their modes of speech - I don't know how she did it, but Collins made all of them instantly distinct and interesting with a backstory that wasn't info-dumped, but which you could *tell* was just there.<br /><br />Told in first-person narrative by the books' protagonist, seventeen year old Katniss, we discover that in the far-flung future North America is known as Panem, in which a wealthy city known as the Capitol maintains totalitarian control over twelve poorer districts that produce food, energy, coal and other raw materials. Years ago, there was a thirteenth District, but it was obliterated by the Capitol after an uprising which saw the city take complete power over the remaining populations. In order to maintain control, they initiate an annual event known as the Hunger Games in which two tributes (a boy and a girl) are randomly selected from each district and forced to partake in a fight to the death.<br /><br />These games are broadcast live to Capitol and Districts alike. Whilst the Districts watch their children die, the people of the Capitol view it all as extreme entertainment, and can bet on the winners, sponsor their favorites, and send supplies into the arena to give their contestants an edge. The winner of the Games is the sole survivor, and wealth and glory awaits them when they return to the Capitol. Tributes can increase their chances of being picked for the Games if they sign up for extra fuel during the winter months, and as a child goes, their name is entered more times into the lottery until they become too old for it.<br /><br />I trust it won't come as much as a spoiler to say that Katniss finds herself called up as a tribute (more specifically, her little sister Prim is, and Katniss volunteers to take her place) and is whisked away to the Capitol with her fellow competitor Peeta Mallark in order to be fed, groomed, styled, interviewed, trained and eventually escorted into the arena where a range of weapons, obstacles and the other competitors await.<br /><br />As the title would imply, the Hunger Games is the focus of the first book, and the two sequels expand on this premise, going from revolution in \\"Catching Fire\\" to all-out war in \\"Mockingjay.\\" Although the motif of a life-or-death game is present in all three books, Collins doesn't repeat herself, and the stakes are raised with each passing chapter. It's a complex story without being convoluted, raising difficult questions about warfare without providing an easy answer, and often Collins does the unexpected when it comes to storytelling conventions, subverting or deconstructing familiar tropes such as the battle between good and evil, romantic entanglements, and the traditional definition of heroism. It's haunting and thought-provoking stuff, and it certainly veers away from a typical \\"happy ending.\\"<br /><br />Katniss makes for a wonderful heroine, and Collins really excels in bringing her to life.

0062060562|3.0|I felt sure I would be giving this novel five stars, but it got a bit saggy in the middle and went on too long at the end. Well and skillfully written, this appeared to be a highly original story, although I generally tend to steer clear of fiction relating to amnesia. Since the writer (a man, I see from the Amz page!) is/was a mental health professional, I thought I'd give it a try, especially as it was recommended by a sales clerk at B&N. Not sorry I did, as it was overall a gripping read. Just too much action at the end, by which time I was, in any case, ready for the novel to finish, and I can't say that I thought Christine was highly likeable. Plus, I wish the US publisher had not tampered with British terms. I think American readers would have been able to figure out what a mobile (flip) phone is, and ditto for petrol and biscuits. Having a British setting and the British narrator write about cell phones, gasoline and cookies (and \\"pig out\\" used by herself 20 years prior) was jarring. On the subject of cell phones, I think it incredibly smart of her to know how to use one, even as she professes never to have seen one before. Muscle memory?  Plus-plus, if I woke up and saw myself in the mirror suddenly twenty years older or my nose missing, or whatever, I think I would scream and never stop. For the whole book.
0345803485|1.0|Totally agree with the bleh and the meh. Not a fan of the romance novels, never have been, never will be so I will not be reading book 2 or 3 in this series. I found the book a bit formulaic. Other than the setting of S & M I didn't find this to be any different than a Kathleen Woodiwiss novel (only got through one of hers too). Same 'ol schlock from the romance genre...heaving beasts (yes, I meant to write that), throbbing loins and screaming O's from the woman's deflowering (also formulaic) to end of relationship. By the time of the character's third or fourth encounter I found myself more bored than aroused thinking....\\"Here we go again, here comes the formula: the electricity is going to course through her body, she's going to feel out of control from all the sensations, he will be skilled and masterful holding back on his explosive and shuddering ending and she will be left a quivering mass of jelly. Yawn....time to turn on Colbert or Chelsea Lately.\\"

B001T6KMFM|4.0|The music itself is fantastic, and one on Sigur Ros' best albums. The vinyl is very high quality, DMM pressing.<br />However, this is listed as the 2009 vinyl release. While it is almost identical to that release, this is a repressing of the album done in 2012, or at least the one that I bought was. To my knowledge, this and Agaetis Byrjun were both repressed this year, that's why you can find them for about $30 on Amazon now.<br />Also, the packaging was a bit weird. The inner sleeves has some glossy parentheses on them that are supposed to fit right in to the die-cut cover, but they're offest by about an inch and a half on my inner sleeves, on both sides, so it looks bad no matter what way I put it in.
1416550550|4.0|Nell's life has been a complete lie until now and she has no idea who she is.  On what she thinks is her 21st birthday, her father, the man who Nell thought was her father, told her the truth about her life.  He told Nell that she arrived in Australia, abandoned on a ship with a little suitcase that contained a dress and a beautifully illustrated book of fairy tales. He estimates that she was about four years old, in the year 1913.<br /><br />Telling no one about the family secret, Nell continues to live her life focused on the past and sets off on a quest to find out who she truly is.  Unfortunately, she doesn't find the answers to her life's questions but what she does find is a cottage in England with a forgotten garden on the Cornish coast.<br /><br />Nell passes away in 2005 and her granddaughter Cassandra inherits her assets, including a cottage in England and a family secret she knows nothing about.  Cassandra's destiny is to search for her grandmother's history, put together the puzzle pieces of the past and unlock the family secrets.<br /><br />The Forgotten Garden is a sweeping mystery with a fairy tale backdrop.  The book travels between two continents and through many generations of woman in the same family.  It is beautifully told and imaginative as the stories intertwine and unravel the past.  The Forgotten Garden is an ode to fairy tales.  The book contains a wicked woman (lets just call her a witch), a beautiful princess, secrets, foggy nights, murder, crazy carriage rides, a mysterious man, a ghost ship, pirates, a maze, a locked garden hidden behind a door and so much more. The Forgotten Garden is a place to lose yourself, smell the roses and try to solve life's mysteries.<br /><br />Kate Morton wove a mysterious tale that will make readers beg for more.  Morton is able to lead the reader where she wants and thus remains an author in control of her story. I was able to figure out the mystery in The Forgotten Garden early on but Morton successfully led me off track.  Morton neatly ties up all the loose ends in the story and as you sit back and digest the book you realize, everything is connected.<br /><br />The Forgotten Garden is a perfect summer book, it has the power to take you to interesting places in your imagination.

B001W79MBI|4.0|I'm a big anime fan, and when I saw this one in my recommendations, I just had to try it. So I purchase it, put it in, grab me a Diet Coke, and sit down to see how it all turns out. After the movie is over, I sit there and think this out before I start to type here. The movie was fantastic, but there was just a few things that had me hanging my head throughout the entire movie.<br /><br />The first thing you'd notice in the movie is the absolutely beautiful animation. The art is all hand drawn, and it's definitely a throwback to before CG when you see the fighting scenes. Now, the fighting scenes are perhaps the absolute best part about this movie. I, personally, am not a pro fight scene guy if it sacrifices other aspects of the animation (we'll get to that later). The fight scenes however were just spectacular. The characters moved fluidly and the way the fights were well fleshed out is pure eye candy. The music fit perfectly and I found that it evoked the correct emotions for the scenes in which it played.<br /><br />The plot is special in many ways. Kotaro and his dog are on the run from the Mings who have come to sacrifice him at a certain time so they can make an elixir of immortality for their master, and to protect himself, Kotaro hires a nameless samurai to protect him. When this was revealed to me, I just hung my head and said to the movie, \\"Why?\\". To be frank, this plot is cliched and overdone. Some of the characters are not fully fleshed out, such as Kotaro and why he is being targeted. Most of the time, the scenes are downright predictable, and it has its rushed moments. Unfortunately the plot is where this movie falls short.<br /><br />BUT there is a shining light in there. The character development is so enthralling and fantastic that I believe viewers really should avoid the main plot and focus on how the characters develop throughout the movie and how they can relate to the themes. One major theme would have to be how evil can creep into everybody, no matter how high status, low status, rich, poor, moral, immoral, pure, or tainted you are. For the sake of keeping spoilers to a minimum, I will just say that each character shows this \\"evil\\" in some way, but it's only your main characters that can overcome this. In addition to the character development, the character relationships with one another are some of the most enticing I've seen, especially between the special trio (Tobimaru, Kotaro, and Nanashi). Each character helps the other grow and evolve in such a way to create compassion where none existed for others. The plot may have its problems, but the characters themselves outshine almost anything else in this movie, except for the fighting scenes mentioned earlier.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this movie may not be the best plot wise, but makes up for it in character development, character relations, and fighting scenes. The graphics are beyond the normal and can only be compared to the best. The music is perfectly inputted and fits with every scene its in.<br /><br />Overall: B+<br />Visuals: A+<br />Music: A<br />Plot: C+<br /><br />After I decided what to write for this review, I remembered that movies are made for the viewers enjoyment and fascination. They're meant for a date, relaxation, or for fans that just have fun while watching them. Don't let the problems of a movie keep you from watching it. Watch it and form your own opinion. Have fun watching, and good job for making it to the end of this review!

0393088774|2.0|This is a well-written book by a Nobel Prize winning economist.  It merits reading, but unfortunately provides a highly slanted view of the choices confronting Americans as their economy falls into a Second Great Depression.  The first stage of that Second Depression might be dated to the September 15, 2008 fall of Lehman Brothers.  A second stage is becoming apparent, as Greece teeters toward bankruptcy, threatening to destroy the euro.<br /><br />Krugman focuses on high unemployment as the major problem afflicting the US economy.  Following Keynes, he argues that inadequate aggregate demand causes high unemployment, and argues that austerity, as proposed by Republicans in the US, and practiced by political leaders in Europe, leads to a worsening of unemployment and an inability to keep deficits from exploding.<br /><br />Here is a simple explanation of how effective Keynesian stimulus works:  Suppose Obama had let the Bush tax cuts expire on incomes above $250K, and used the revenues to pay for government jobs, say for high school teachers and for workers constructing a new high-speed rail system.<br /><br />This would have redistributed income from the relatively wealthy, with a high propensity to save, to the relatively poor, who are forced to spend what they earn.  This would increase aggregate demand, and would have led to additional jobs through the so-called Keynesian multiplier.<br /><br />That is textbook economics, and many economists believe that it would work beautifully.  Note that it is revenue neutral, new taxes being offset by new expenditures.  Moreover the education imparted by the high school teachers and the new high speed rail system would make the US better able to service debt in the future.  Thus in the long run this redistribution scheme would more than pay for itself.<br /><br />But politicians have a tendency to garble the simple teachings of Keynes.  Thus Obama's stimulus was 40% tax cuts, and only $100 billion out of $787 billion was actually devoted to infrastructure jobs.  In a later stimulus installment, Obama argued for social security tax cuts.  Economists of the Chicago School point out that these are less effective as stimulus because of Ricardian Equivalence.  In simple terms, lower social security taxes might cause some workers to save for retirement instead of spend, since they see the income stream for future benefits threatened.<br /><br />But there is more to the story than Keynesian economics---macroeconomics is a complex subject with many feedback loops, and many unexpected and counterintuitive consequences.  Unfortunately, this complexity destroys many of Krugman's arguments, because he doesn't discuss all important variables.<br /><br />Consider the fact, for example, that the US population grew by 24% in the period 1990-2010, by 60 million people.<br /><br />Is it plausible that the increase in US population is sufficient in itself to explain a large component of current unemployment?  Indeed, it is.  The mechanism is simple.  The increase of 24% in the number of people was NOT offset by a 24% increase in water, in oil, in land for growing food.  So as the population increases these resources ultimately become scarce, causing living standards to drop.  at the same time, a higher supply of unskilled labor would be expected to lead to lower wages (supply and demand), and in the case of sticky wages would cause unemployment to rise.<br /><br />Such unemployment did not occur in earlier decades because the US had always invested in the future, finding new ways to increase productivity.  Thus the Green Revolution increased crop yields allowing more people to live with less land for growing food.  But particularly during the last decade, Americans stopped investing for the future.  Instead, they went on a borrowing binge that culminated in the housing bubble.<br /><br />Moreover, CPI figures show that during the last decade oil prices tripled while the overall CPI went up only 28%.  This is evidence that we have entered an era of increasingly scarce resources.  This is a key part of the economic picture and Krugman ignores it.<br /><br />Krugman gives precise recommendations in Chapter 12:  1. The Federal Government should give state and local governments $300 billion per year to reverse budget cuts which they have been forced to make as the current depression developed. 2. To stimulate aggregate demand, the Fed should adopt a 4% inflation target, instead of the current 2%.  3. The government needs a revamped HAMP program to make refinancing of mortgages easier for those underwater.<br /><br />Krugman's argument for 1 is indeed compelling, although as I mentioned, Obama's economic stimuli have been badly designed, so far.  As far as 3 goes, the devil is in the details, and the Obama administration has had an abysmal record in helping underwater homeowners.  (For many of these, a rescue is too late, since they have already lost their homes.)<br /><br />As far as 2 goes, Krugman does NOT explain how inflation produces jobs.  One can imagine that if incomes are not indexed to higher inflation, average incomes fall, so more workers can be employed at the lower income, which indirectly causes unemployment to drop.  But this hardly seems like a solution, particularly to those whose incomes fall.  And inflation carries costs.  Millions of Americans are afraid of retiring because their retirement savings would (if invested in treasuries) have a negative real rate of return, and the expropriation of their savings would occur even more rapidly with higher inflation targets..<br /><br />Krugman is entertaining and explains the Keynesian viewpoint well.  But he also does a disservice by downplaying the importance of getting the US deficit under control.  Moreover, he totally ignores an issue of growing importance: scarcity of resources.<br /><br />These are essential components of the current US economic crisis, but subjects for a different book.  If the depression continues to develop, let's hope that such a book gets written.

068485743X|4.0|\\" This is not a novel to be tossed aside lightly. It should be thrown with great force. \\"<br />- Dorothy Parker<br /><br />Having been doggedly customer reviewing for over a decade, I've received my fair share of solicitations to review terrible self-published novels.<br /><br />It takes unquestionable intellectual ability and focus to turn out 200 pages of uninterrupted prose (it is certainly beyond me: I've tried on many occasions and always given up, hence I stick to a length - book reviewing - I can cope with), and frequently these books are imaginative in scope. But from the first page, you just know they're no good, purely from the prose style.<br /><br />This book is one I would commend to all those authors: it addresses the most common categories of prose misjudgement that amateur writers make. Many of them are eminently correctable. Much boils down to \\"if in doubt, and frequently, even when not in doubt, leave it out\\". I have heard this expressed in the aphorism \\"murder your darlings\\". Amateur novels tend to be colossally over-written. A confident writer will not need to over-woo his audience, and is secure enough to leave the \\"world-building\\" to his reader.<br /><br />Lukeman does the great service of going, systematically and thoroughly, through the ways you might do weed out overwriting. He supposes (correctly) that you'll already have a manuscript, and that the job is thus one of editing rather that prospective composition.<br /><br />The first part of this book is first rate on why adverbs and adjectives should *generally* be avoided like the plague. First timers tend to ladle them on. (The need for a modifier implies weakness in the selection of a noun or verb. So choose better nouns and verbs).<br /><br />His discussion of dialogue, characterisation, and setting - and critically, their interaction with the plot - is also enlightening.<br /><br />The book does tail off in enthusiasm towards the end (despite discussing it Lukeman hasn't any practical advice for how to deal with pacing or tone, although it's hard to think what such advice might be) and his text is blighted by his own use of obviously made-up, exaggerated examples of \\"bad\\" writing: presumably Lukeman has waste-takers full of real examples, and these would ring more truly for his target audience and better emphasise his point.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this quick book really ought to be a compulsory read for an aspiring novelist, ideally before he seals and addresses his A4 envelopes.<br /><br />Olly Buxtondvice for how to deal with pacing or tone, although it's hard to think what such advice might be) and his text is blighted by his own use of obviously made-up, exaggerated examples of \\"bad\\" writing: presumably Lukeman has waste-takers full of real examples, and these would ring more truly for his target audience and better emphasise his point.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this quick book really ought to be a compulsory read for an aspiring novelist, ideally before he seals and addresses his A4 envelopes.<br /><br />Olly Buxton
B007K3JCAE|5.0|Many people are reviewing the product rather then the movie which at times can help but when their are several of the same reviews its useless. To keep this short and simple if you liked the first film you'll love the 2nd. Robert Downey Jr. plays Holmes even better the second time around and Jude Law's Watson is unforgettable. However the most amazing performance is that of Jared Harris as Professor James Moriarty who is SuperB. Noomi Rapace (The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo) also co-stars and does an admirable job. Overall its a slick, stylish, fun adventure. A Game Of Shadows is one of the best Holiday films we've seen in a long time. I highly recommend this film to anyone as well as the first. 5/5.

B007JM4CWY|3.0|As you can tell from the screenshots, it's pretty and polished. I like the subtle effect of how recently shaded in or erased squares aren't as dark or light as the others.<br /><br />However, on my 7\\" Nook, I have trouble selecting exactly the space I want; selecting ranges is also a bit hit-or-miss because sometimes it decides I started swiping on the opposite axis. It would be much better with a stylus (or on a larger device), but with just fingers, there's too much precision required. You can zoom, but then it's hard to keep track of numbers - if they always appeared and/or if there was a minimap, that would help. Finally, my personal preference is to toggle the input mode (always darken, always erase, always flag) vs. depending on the state of the cell.

B005JLN9Z8|3.0|I know this is a Parody band doing parody songs from the 80s. I have lots of Metal and rock bands from the 80s on CD and not one of them says the F Bomb it was only when Motley Crue's Decade of Decadence album came out in 91 I heard an F Bomb in a Song It was Anarchy In The UK. Another thing not all Metal songs in the 80s were about sex those type of songs were in the 90s Lita Fords Hungry For Your Sex as an example.The songs are way too Descriptive for even listening to out loud you would have to use headphones since a lot of people would be offended by these songs especially the ladies. The music is good but tone down on the language!
B0079IJ0R0|5.0|I have heard and seen many a CARMEN, but never has Carmen been portrayed in such a gloriously slutty way as by Elina Garanca in this Met production! This Latvian diva just oozes blatant sexuality, and I am totally smitten.  It doesn't hurt that her mezzo is to die for, and that she is absolutely beautiful to behold. And, as if that weren't enough, she can really dance. When I Googled her, it turns out she's a blonde, but in her black gypsy wig, she owns this role, and I'm having a hard time imagining her singing anything else. If you don't buy another opera this year, don't miss this one!<br /><br />Now to the rest of the cast:- Roberto Alagna sings Don Jose pretty well, although vocally his best days are behind him and he's getting a little pudgy. His native French helps his enunciation in this role, though. He has sung this part with Elina Garanca before, and they have an obvious rapport. Teddy Rhodes, a New Zealander, was thrust into the role of Escamillo on the morning of the performance, owing to the previous choice becoming unavailable. I found him quite believable, and he doesn't overdo the macho heroic stance, as some have done. Barbara Frittoli, as Micaela, the village girl ousted by Carmen for Don Jose's affection, stretches credibility a bit playing a 17 year old - she is over 40. Vocally, she is fine, and adds some interest to a usually boring subordinate role. But all these are in the shadow of Garanca's Carmen, quite simply the best portrayal of this role you have ever seen or are likely to see. This is really a cagey and nuanced performance.<br /><br />The Met orchestra responds wonderfully to  Yannick Nezet-Seguin's intuitive and rhythmic conducting. A couple of extra dances by the troupe are thrown in for good measure and are expertly performed.<br /><br />Sound and video in this Bluray are flawless. Between-act interviews with the four protagonists and Rene Fleming are quite enlightening.<br /><br />There has been a prior release of this productionon dvd by DGG, and there are other reviews of that disc which go into the musical aspects more than I am able to do. (I am not an across-the-board opera buff - just a handful of favorites that I have grown to love!).<br /><br />This is something special - Elina is now my #1 mezzo!

0307454568|5.0|As the final book in Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy, \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" packs an extremely satisfying punch, even if at times it seems like there is too much going on.  After leaving readers in a cliffhanger at the end of \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" Larsson picks up the story right where he left off.  As Lisbeth Salander recovers in a hospital doors down from the father she tried to kill, readers are left to wonder how justice could possibly be served or how such a complicated web of intrigue can be unravelled.  Larsson does so in spectacular fashion.<br /><br />Mikael Blomkvist has taken it upon himself to fight for Lisbeth Salander and to gather friends, like Armansky and Palmgren, who will fight for her to.  His sister takes the job as her attorney, even though she has never tried a criminal case before, and Salander is sure to face a variety of charges, including attempted murder.  While Blomkvist pours all his energy into uncovering the coverup about Salander's past, the Secret Police officers are making sure he doesn't uncover too much and take some drastic measure to cover up their actions.  New characters abound, as a police team instigates an investigation of Sapo to see if the constitution has been broken, while the real murderer from the previous book remains on the loose.  The book races along at breakneck speed - it is extremely hard to put down as the story races towards Lisbeth's trial and the defense that she must mount to prove her innocence and her betrayal by the Swedish government.  It is a thrilling comeuppance and then some.<br /><br />\\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" is a fitting conclusion to the trilogy.  At times, it seems as if Larsson was trying to do too much with the subplots; some fit better than others.  Larsson was a gifted writer with an uncanny eye for detail and making scenes come to life.  Some readers may be disappointed with what is left out of the story, like the jumps in time at the end of the novel.  They will be especially saddened to have to leave behind one of the most unique and interesting characters in contemporary fiction - Lisbeth Salander.  It might be enough to make them start the trilogy all over again.the novel.

B001POAVZE|4.0|Just listened to this album after not hearing it since it first came out, and after playing the first 2 albums first. IMO this is almost as good as their debut, just not quite. The songs are all good, but even the very best songs are still no match for anything off the first album. \\"You Could Have It So Much Better\\" was overstuffed, it felt like a collection of B-sides more than an album. You could tell too, the album had like 17-18 songs if you include the B-sides/extra songs. And there are literally like a handful of gems on the album, the rest is very forgettable. I read they wrote the songs for YCHISMB in a crazy songwriting blitz so its possible they just had editing issues. I also noticed an improvement in production immediately when I popped this album in. Though I admire the work Rich Costey did on the first 2 albums, they should make all their albums with Dan Carey, seems like a good fit.

(The nicely modified one that<br />took the place of the 'dustbuster' that was carried by Tasha Yar and the gang Back in the Day of<br />the pin-stripe uniforms.)

So heres to the Doctor and a vote for one of the best Star Trek Deaths:<br />Counter, Forearm, Strike, Side-kick, Lethal Phaser Blast to Hole in Chest, Vaporization. Nice...
0596805888|5.0|This book was even better than expected. It doesn't have an excess of recipes, but it has so many details and tips and charts that you can cook basically whatever you want without needing a recipe. The first page is packed with computer coding/hackers jokes, xkcd references, and anything else geeky you can imagine. I bought this for my boyfriend as a birthday present, and he absolutely loved it. I recommend this to anyone at any level of cooking who is looking for a book that actually teaches you how to cook, not just gives you specific recipes.

B0034G4P4O|3.0|Basically this is an action-adventure, animation film depiction of Herge's (belgian cartoonist) brilliant tintin comics which he did between the 30's and the 70's. It takes story lines from a number of different adventures and combines them to try and create relatively new elements to the main story of 'The Secret of the Unicorn'. Our young Journalist Tintin gets involved in an adventure that sees the bad guys trying to get hold of 2 different model tall ships as they contain parchments that reveal the secret. This results in Tintin being kidnapped, meeting his buddy-in-adventure, Captain Haddock, being stranded at sea, then in the desert and ending up in Morocco. There's also flash back sequences to stories of pirates and buccaneers that are integral to the plot. There's a lot of action on the way and some witty dialogue too but the strongest element lies in it's general mystery plot and globe trotting fun.<br /><br />Tintin the comics were one of the first pieces of writing I ever loved. The adventures were so exotic and he would find himself in countless countries and environments (including the moon), fighting drug dealers and gangsters, making friends with latin revolutionaries and arab sheiks. They were stories with great mystery, suspense and sometimes the super natural thrown in. Now, I know it's difficult to translate the detail of books to film but it can be done. This film, like most, once again does not deliver this well. I mean some of the new ideas and the idea of combining different books into this one story actually works ok but what let's it down is too many 'unrealistic elements' and cheesy moments. I know this is an animation movie but Tintin is also supposed to be a 'more realistic character and subsequently so should the movie. For example, how does he go through a chase sequence where his motorbike explodes, leaving him with the front wheel and handle bars (whilst he's in mid air) which he uses to zip line (the line also appearing convenientlyin front of him)? And in terms of cheese, for example, Haddock, having drunk the alcohol to use as emergency fuel, burps into the fuel tank once he's crawled outside the plane and sits on the engine. The fumes from his constant state of inebriation apparently helps fuel the plane just enough to get to land. Once the plane crashes, he then ends up in the still running blades of the plane which spins him comically (apparently) and flings him away, in a Tom and Jerry esk style. Clearly the target audience of this movie is pretty young but the tone of the rest of the film does not go with such a comic style and reduces it's enjoyment for those wanting the film to remain grounded. By all means, have comedy, but keep it witty and interesting like much of the pixar movies or one of my favourites, Rango. In recent years, Spielberg has really let the fans down because like George Lucas, he seems to favour over the top action and cheese instead of intellect and wit. Maybe if the mantle for director was handed to the pixar guys, things may have been a lot better.<br /><br />As I mentioned, the animation in this is stunning and it's a great medium between real actors and the usual computer graphic animation, which I think is perfect for Tintin.  Having turned Tintin and chums British, the casting hosts a lot of talented brits that i think are perfectly cast for their roles. In addition, the script is very adventurous and fun and on the whole the dialogue is good. The first half an hour in particular is enjoyable as you get immersed into the mystery and plot. However, the mindless, uninteresting, over the top and numerous action scenes, as well as the hurried pace, certainly detract from the quality of this film and left me feeling bored and uninterested the longer the film progressed. Ultimately, the best of the movie was, in general, where the script remained more true to the comics. That's why the general plot of the movie is really exciting but let down by the hollywood factor.<br /><br />Overall, think maybe viewers around 7-13 may enjoy it for the adventure and action but don't think it will hold the attention of older viewers. I would say it was still worth watching for the quality of animation and also if you're a fan of indiana jones type films but don't, at the same time, expect a great deal..you might enjoy it more that way. Old tintin fans, you're going to be annoyed but watch it anyway if you like to see Herge's golden boy brought to life.
B005HEQ8KA|5.0|Well...Another great episode that has a great conclusion yet here it does not.<br />Maybe if all fans of the series petition Ama zon to add part 2 of 2, then they<br />will be close to their claim of having \\"...all Star Trek TV episodes available for Prime Members...\\"<br />One down, One to go...

0345803485|1.0|This is the first time in my life when I feel an obligation to write a review only to warn people about an extremely overrated and overhyped piece of garbage. The success of this book is beyond me. I have to admit that I was brainwashed by the media, tons of positive reviews and made an impulse purchase. How is it possible that this \\"masterpiece\\" became a bestseller????? I am going to repeat other reviewers, but the writing is horrendous, characters are unrealistic, annoying, and impossible to relate to or feel empathetic about.  I wish I could just send it back based on inaccurate statements and misrepresentation. You've been warned!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Slow starting.  Gets better as continue reading.  Does belabor some points.  You can tell it's written from a female point of view.  Overall, ok.
B00563M11M|5.0|Loved it. excellent Pratchett showing the master of the genre has lost nothing despite the challenges he currently faces. Vimes is at his bewildered best fighting his own egalitarian ideals, the expectations of the downtrodden masses of the Noble class, and vicious thuggery of the worst high seas (or river) kind . Vintage Pratchett which challenges you own cosy class and racial views, and a worthy addition to the series.
B002RI9HUM|5.0|A fantastic book, loved it! Great insight into the life of a drug addict, highly recommend.Easy light reading, couldn't put it down.
B0076NAWWA|1.0|When I hear the words \\"power pop\\" I don't have a tendicy to run away...after all, I am familiar with some of the best out there and love it when DONE RIGHT. So when the comparisons to groups such as Yes, Ambrosia and Mr. Mister came along here I had to check these guys out. Not even close! I absolutely love some of the music and covers I've heard from the collaberations of a few in this group, but please don't distance your fan bases by \\"hyping\\" an album before its release again. The comparisons to any of the groups I just mentioned are unwarranted and I scratch my head wondering where they came from as a  connoisseur of great rock music. I dare anyone with this cd in their hand to go grab a copy of Mr. Misters \\"Welcome To The Real World\\" and tell me where the comparisons are???? Get real. I'm not even sure that Trevor Horn could have made this group work like he did  with one of the best power pop albums ever made with 90125.Seems to me that this \\"band\\" suffers from the members trying NOT to take center stage or outdoing one another. They don't gell here as compared to Transatlantic. Want to hear how a band of \\"matured\\" musicians come together and make good music? Grab a copy of The Mighty Jerimiahs [[ASIN:B000EO5IT0 Mighty Jeremiahs]].<br /><br />UPDATE: 11/20/12  After giving this thing constant rotation in summer driving I can honestly say this is a real disappointment and waste of money. Not only that, but upon further investigating some of the \\"reviewers\\" here and discovering that many of them have only reviewed this album and nothing else gives me complete confirmation of my first suspicions, that the album was hyped. Shame! So now I take away 2 stars and give it the lowest rating.
B0055V6EZE|4.0|Immediately following the departure of the greatest character ever depicted on television, I discovered a House sized hole in my heart.  In order to attempt to find succor and fill the vacancy, I thought it wise to google the actor whom for 8 years played the anti-hero, the titular character - House, M.D., and low and behold I found that he made a blues album!<br /><br />After the first run-through of the CD \\"Let Them Talk\\" admittedly, I wasn't impressed.  In fact I was more confounded than anything else.  I couldn't help but wonder how a brilliant, Cambridge educated, proper English gentleman actor could possibly sing the blues.  Then I listened again.  Then a third time, and finally light dawned on marble head.  Hugh loves the artform; he is clearly, hopelessly, passionately in love with the blues, and this is his tribute to the genre.  Now it makes sense, now I get it......time for another listen......................<br /><br />Is James Hugh Calum Laurie the epicenter of blues music?  Is he the greatest blues piano player that ever drew breath?  Is he to be counted among such luminaries as Howlin' Wolf, Blind Lemmon Jefferson, or Lady Day?  Oh, don't be silly, of course not.  That's not the point of the album.  This is a homage paid to those great artists, and its palpable innocence drips with a certain authenticity straight from the Mississippi delta that had me jonesing for some Jambalaya and an episode of \\"Swamp People.\\"  4 stars for the album.<br /><br />To the cast and crew of my favorite TV drama of all time, House, M.D.: Thank you for 8 great seasons; may the wind be at your back, and calm seas ahead.  Godspeed!
0345803493|5.0|Some of the remarks OMG. I guess everyone's taste in reading material is different, to each his own. All I can say is I am so glad I bought all 3 books at the same time. I would have been on pins and needles waiting for the next to arrive. I loved loved loved all three.<br /><br />It took me two days to read the first 2 books and a few more days to finish the 3rd. It wasn't because the last book wasn't as good but I had to return to work and had to get a little sleep.<br /><br />I would love to see these books made into a film and the Twilight lovers as the main characters. Would also love to read a 4th book of Christians life as a child and what he had to endure to make him the way he is now.
B00828HWJE|5.0|I was lucky enough to see this on the big screen and it didn't disappoint. Cung Le's presence and acting ability was much better than anticipated. Van Damme's role was  a small but important one, and the movie was action packed and very well made. Cung Le made for a much better action star than I thought he would, and his action sequences were impressive. He is well spoken in his acting ability and the fight scenes are second to none. GREAT MOVIE. IMPRESSED. Give it a chance, you will not be disappointed.
B0081X40HW|5.0|I didn't know what to expect.  The samples sounded good, so I bought the album.  I have listened to it every day since I purchased it.  Ms. Reinhart sounds so very happy that I always end up smiling all the way through.  It may be a turn-off for some listeners to hear her sing sad songs while smiling, but to me it's infectious.  Love the entire album.

0307592731|5.0|Twenty-six year old Cheryl Strayed took off on the Pacific Crest Trail in 1995, alone and poorly prepared for a lot but equipped with marvelous powers of observation and an open heart. All these years later, her memoir packs a sense of immediacy. It doesn't take a lot of imagination to see that another person in similar circumstances might have wound up on the street. Her account of losing her young mother to cancer is so raw I still can't get it out of my psyche, and her recollections of losing her father are almost as powerful. That the felt love of her mother permitted her to find herself is not an understatement.<br /><br />Rarely have I read a memoir in which the literary aspirations and skill of the writer so well-matched the story. This is not only a story of adventure, danger, beauty and courage, it's beautifully crafted in a way that makes it sing. Emotion is carefully tended, never cheap or overwrought but appropriate to the occasion large and small. Knopf is to be congratulated for bringing this to print.<br /><br />I'd recommend Wild to people who love the wilderness, adventurers of all stripes, anyone who has suffered loss, and sensitive souls everywhere.
B000R7GKQE|1.0|The DVD arrived on time as per shipping. When we played disc 1 there was a lot of problems getting the DVD to play without stopping. On examination there were several large scratches across the disc. This was a new DVD and therefore this was down to sheer bad quality control. The scratch could not possibly have been missed at the packaging stage. So someone thought they would try to slip this through. Very disapppointed.
0307730697|5.0|I just finished this book, in less than a day, and couldnt put it down. This book is absolutely AMAZING. Few people of such character have EVER graced this world. It is absolutely unreal what Adam overcame to reach the apex of military service- Drug Addiction, criminal charges, loss of an eye, having fingers severed. His devotion to God and Jesus, his love of family, and his NEVER QUIT attitude should be an inspiration to all. I am in awe of such a man. I couldnt endorse this book any more strongly. Get it, read it, re-read it.

1416955070|4.0|Admittedly, the only reason I initially decided to read City of Bones was the hype. It had the makings of the next Twilight, with its passionate fanbase and internet buzz. I couldn't go on tumblr without seeing a post about the `dream cast' (for the fortuitously uninitiated, a `dream cast' is a list of actors/actresses hand-picked by the fandom to play in the movie version of the book). I was looking forward particularly to tearing apart the shallow characters and sub-par plot, especially if the book didn't live up to the hype.<br /><br />Is City of Bones as good as its fans think it is? Yes and no.<br /><br />The story begins fairly stereotypically. The audience is introduced to the world of Shadowhunters and demons through the eyes of Clary Frey, the main female protagonist. Like the audience, she's new to the supernatural, a sceptic at first, but she quickly comes to terms with her new reality. She's almost obnoxiously normal, without anything special or interesting that sets her apart from the rest of the cast, and at first glance the Shadowhunters are a far more interesting group of teenagers.<br /><br />Clare cleverly sets the reader up to assume, and then turns the plot in a completely different direction. What made City of Bones worth the read was the twists. The plot and characters aren't as compelling as The Hunger Games, which is the young adult novel I now judge all others against, but it has its own merits. Clary's normality is refreshing, as is her practicality. She's not silly or a damsel-in-distress. Although she's significantly out-gunned by the Shadowhunters, she refuses to sit by on the sidelines and watch people die around her. She's definitely not Bella Swan, and Jace Wayland, the main male protagonist and charismatic Shadowhunter, isn't the typical romantic hero so many young adult novels are fond of. He's lacking in gentlemanly airs of any manner, and he's definitely walking the fine line between moral and immoral. Their relationship isn't very romantic either. Clary doesn't want Jace to rescue her while she stands around and wrings her hands. She's determined to handle all of her problems on her own. Their relationship is refreshingly awkward and almost normal (if one looks past the demon-fighting and potential war on the horizon).<br /><br />It's also surprisingly mature. Unlike Twilight, which strays from any relationship dynamics except Bella and her harem's, City of Bones explores the relationships between all the characters in depth. Clary is not the only one that has a personalty, history, and motivations, and therefore not the only one the reader cares about. Although Clary's growth and self-discovery are the backbone of the novel, Jace's relationship with Isabelle and Alec Lightwood are also explored. Alec's sexuality is an interesting detail, and I'm curious to see how that plays out in the sequels. Most mainstream YA novels balk at the exploration of more controversial subject matter, but I was pleased to see that Clare wasn't scared to unabashedly introduce a homosexual male character as one of the heroes.<br /><br />The book has its detractors. Clary's inability to realize how pretty she is, despite having a beautiful mother and several young men staring doe-eyed after her. It's a common young adult trope, but a tired one. She doesn't have to brag about her appearance, but she has access to mirrors. She's obviously not a troll. Occasionally a word is thrown into the prose that just doesn't seem to belong there, and it makes me wonder if Clare was simply exercising her extensive vocabulary (a trap we've all fallen into on more than one occasion). The world of the Shadowhunters could use more building, but I'm giving the novels the benefit of the doubt and assume more of that will happen in the sequels.<br /><br />Overall City of Bones is a solid young-adult novel. Violent and deeply rooted in fantasy, its action-scenes are gloriously detailed. Clare knows how to write an epic battle, and there are enough of those in the novel that I'm actually excited to see how it translates on screen.e are enough of those in the novel that I'm actually excited to see how it translates on screen.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|best game for the money.  works great on kindle fire.  hours of fun and makes you think. i highly recommend this game.
0307949486|4.0|Admittedly I put off reading this particular novel out of sheer stubbornness. If I hadn't been eleven when my grandmother gifted me with the first three Harry Potter books, I likely would have refused to read them for the same reason: they're too popular. I have this `too-cool for school' attitude regarding books, and the more popular they are, the less inclined I am to pick them up and give them a try.<br /><br />In the case of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, my curiosity won out over my disgust for conformity, and I'm extremely glad it did. The novel starts out slow, introducing the two main characters, Mikael Blomkvist, journalist and part-owner of the magazine Millennium, and Lisbeth Salander, an employee of Milton Security and a freelance researcher. Blomkvist is on trial for libel, having published false information on the billionaire industrialist Hans-Erik Wennerstr&ouml;m. Wennerstr&ouml;m is the type of businessman Blomkvist hates, who makes much of his money illegally, and has criminal contacts throughout the world. Someone set Blomkvist up, but because his sources really were falsified he has no defense, and instead of appealing his case he decides to take some time off.<br /><br />Lisbeth is introduced as an employee of Milton Security, their best researcher despite her more eccentric tendencies. She's carrying deep-seated personal issues, but she doesn't allow it to prevent her from doing her work, and she completes her jobs with an almost ruthless aggression.<br /><br />Blomkvist is hired to investigate the disappearance of Harriet Vanger, great-niece of Henrik Vanger, another industrialist. Unlike Wennerstr&ouml;m, Vanger is ethical, and in addition to a large sum of money he offers Blomkvist proof of Wennerstr&ouml;m's crimes, provided Blomkvist discovers what happened to Harriet.<br /><br />From this point on the story picks up, and Larsson weaves an intricate web of family feuds and photo-clues. Blomkvist and Lisbeth eventually team up to discover the truth behind Harriet's disappearance, and uncover much more than either of them ever bargained for. The most notable part of the novel is the mystery, so cleverly crafted that up until the last few chapters the truth is not at all evident. Unlike many crime novels Larsson's is not easily navigated, and its unpredictability is what makes it such an enjoyable read.<br /><br />It's not a novel for the faint of heart, the imagery graphic. Larsson does not hold anything back, and he's not afraid to go beyond the comfort zone of most. Lisbeth's past is horrific, and the truth behind Harriet's disappearance is both fascinating and grotesque. Despite the stomach-wrenching nature of many of the scenes, the novel is entirely worth a read.nd Harriet's disappearance, and uncover much more than either of them ever bargained for.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|This is a very steamy book in places the author has quite an imagination.Not a book for the teens in my opinion
B004MC8CA2|2.0|good for hearing bought talking snakes and racist ghosts. in the sky over all a good read to bad its fake
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Nice game. Won't save the gems I get on my tablet version but its still good and addictive. Definitely recommend to play this game.
B007X1EIIY|5.0|It is very rare when a book or movie completely lives up to every expectation you might have for it, but Skagboys hits the mark. As the prequel to Trainspotting, Welsh introduces all his familier characters in full stride-Renton,Spud,Sick Boy,Begbie with his characteristic humor,aplomb,cynicism and full on outrageousness. I do not wish to interject any spoilers, but I can say that many scense are written almost screen-play ready,and one can see the hilarity playing out in your mind's eye with ease. Unlike Trainspotting, Skagboys deals with the psychology of addiction much more directly-the entire crew winds up in a rehab together-and family backgrounds of Sick Boy and Renton. If you have been anticipating this release as much as I have, you will not be disappointed-this is Welsh delivering his fans a home run.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|The game is well-designed, haven't found any glitches (except those created by my fat fingers). The tutorial was very hard to understand, but I figured it out by playing a few games. Beware, if you go back to a puzzle, it restarts you...<br />And now I see grids everywhere!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is a real page turner about what went on in Germany during WW II from the unusual perceptive of  a young German girl. It is not your typical holocaust story.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I am a long time science fiction fan, starting with the juveniles by Robert Heinlein, which led me to a life long love of reading.The simple plot and strong characters are appealing and even an old guy like me enjoyed the book and the rest of the trilogy.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|As with a lot of folks, my Kindle cable started falling apart after only a couple of years.  The jacket material was cracking and falling off.  The really strange part is I had used it the prior day and it was fine.  However, the next day when I took it out to use it, the coating started falling off.<br /><br />After sending an e-mail to Amazon about this, their customer representative wrote back to let me know that they were sorry that I had a problem and they issued me a credit so that I could order a replacement cable.  They even supplied links to the correct cable!  I placed an order for the cable and the credit covered the entire thing!  My cost for the cable was covered completely.<br /><br />I received my cable quickly and used it to plug in my depleated Kindle to charge it back up.  The cable is the same length as the original, but it is of a smaller diameter and it is stiffer than the original.  The cable worked just fine and my Kindle is now back in my hands so that I can complete the book I was reading.<br /><br />Once again, Amazon has wowed me with their committment to customer satisfaction!  How many companies would replace a cable for free on a product that is two years old?<br /><br />If you need a replacement cable or an extra one for your Kindle, this cable works well.  Time will tell if the cable cracks, but I would not expect it to.  I think that whatever they added to the original to make it soft and pliable is what caused it to crack and fail.
0061438294|5.0|Navarro has a wealth of experience to draw from and creates a simple, easy to memorize flow to his instructions in the book with frequent case studies and pictures. I read the book in a day, and started applying it at work immediately, and it was very useful in helping me interpret my coworkers. I couldn't believe just how obvious and universal the body language signs were with people once I had become aware of them by reading this book. What I liked best about this book was that it's not trying to sell any gimmicks on how to prove someone's lying. It helps the reader appreciate how complex a person's responses are to a situation, and how snap judgments can lead to devastating results, like innocent people feeling compelled to confess to relieve the stress of interrogation.
B0063TX06I|1.0|How can this CD with a release date of \\"Original Release Date: 2011\\" have reviews from 2000?  If this is re-relese the reviews should be only from the new release date on.  This 'carry over' is done way too often on amazon not only with CD's, but also with DVD's and Blu-rays.  The Blu-ray will have the exact same reviews as the DVD.  One would think the Blu-ray would have its own review as the content (extras) and quality would be different than the DVD.

0345803485|1.0|Really, any of it. The characters are unrealistic and annoying, the writing is juvenile, the 'sex' is comical, and the story line is simply not compelling. There are better reviews on here, by people who are much more eloquent than I will ever be, but trust us - borrow a copy if you want to see for yourself. You may enjoy it, and want to put your money into it. I sure wish I'd done that first!
1597801585|3.0|I wanted to like this book. I really wanted to like this book. I knew that living in Bangkok I had to read it. I bought a copy in a second hand bookshop. Ok, I wasn't that obsessed by the promotion. But I had to like this book. It had won awards and was set in my home city. I began reading. Hmmmm. First chapter concerns fruit. Fruit is good. The author had even gone to the bother of finding out how to pronounce the names of fruit in Thai. Immpresive. First ten pages. Fruit. Great. Then the Megodont. Big elephant creatures who generate power. Nice. I would guess the Thai's would use the word Chang. Megochang. Hell, what do I know? Then we have some action.  A crazed Megodont breaches his restraints and goes, like, crazy, man. He attacks people that we haven't had time to care about yet. But we keep reading. Perhaps there is more stuff about fruit. No luck. A guy drinks mekong whiskey. Cool. Things improve by page 53 - 'Kammika drags her further back, bending her like willow, forcing her to thrust her breasts out to the crowd, to arch further still, to spread her thighs...' Now that grabs our attention. The problem is from then on the novel tends to drag it's feet. Yes the writing is skillful. The concept is creative. The author has researched the city. This is all great. But I couldn't get past page 53. I think this probably says more about my attention span than the author's work which is obviously great having won the Nebula. And yes, Bacigalupi does write very much like William Gibson. I sense that this is a great novel, but I just failed to 'get' it.
0345803485|5.0|I recently listen to this book on Audio; I loved it. This book opens up a whole new fantasy world for the reader or in my case the listener. I will say that this book is for<br />a person that is open about sex and the many types of form of it. If you are a shut in, DON'T READ IT. To each person there own. This book is all about escaping the norm, embracing<br />a new way to open themselves up and letting go just a little before the reader is plummeted back to the earth and their lives. I can't wait to listen to books two and three.
B002PD39HQ|4.0|These six tracks seem like a nice introduction to Kraftwerk. I'll probably buy more of their music in the future, but until then, I'm gonna rock out, stoically, to \\"The Robots\\" and \\"The Model.\\"
B00514HDNW|4.0|I Am legend is a classic science fiction/horror novel written in 1954 by Richard Matheson.  It is a story written in a post-apocalyptic setting.  The hero is what appears to be a lone survivor of the disaster and is having to deal with the results thereof.  I have read that this book has served as inspiration to many of the zombie books and movies from just after it was written through the modern era.  While I'm sure that many will have seen the Will Smith movie version of this book, please do not expect the book to be precisely like the movie.<br /><br />I was torn as how to rate this book.  From a classical perspective I would rate it a five, but when I compare it books that I have really enjoyed from the modern era I would rate it a three.  Neither is fair so I have compromised and given it a four.  It is a definite read if you are into reading the classics.  I would highly recommend to anyone who is into the science fiction/horror genres.<br /><br />I was always puzzled by the title of this book.  However, on the last page it becomes crystal clear.<br /><br />Happy reading to all!
B007R41E8O|3.0|its a great game,  but it takes forever to down load. poor kindle drained the battery &amp; took lots of Mb :(  if you have time go for it.

B00632HWOG|5.0|ive not had any of the problems mentioned by other reviewers....perhaps this version is intended for kindle fire/ e readers/ tablets  specifically?  just a guess
0671027344|4.0|4.5 stars, but, you know, that's not an option.<br /><br />When I read this book years ago I didn't enjoy it. So many people had told me they loved it, so maybe it was built up too much in my head, but remember thinking it really wasn't such a big deal. Upon re-reading it a second time, I was pleasantly surprised to find that I appreciated it a lot more this time around. It felt refreshingly real and I liked Charlie a lot. As some previous reviews have mentioned it is probable that his character has a mental disability, most likely somewhere along the lines of Aspergers, and that aspect was one of my favorites because Mr. Chbosky never says it straight out but rather lets those traits and qualities seep into the text and lets the reader make her own judgement call. So much of this book had similar moments of artful subtlety and letting the work speak for itself, which I just loved. I am glad I gave it another shot, and I am very excited to see the movie coming out later this year. It could translate to film beautifully.
B00785P2QC|4.0|The game is easy to learn and fun to play, even though it's a free to play pay to win kindnof thing. There werensoke glitches with the trucks, but it is engaging and fun.
B001B80EM4|5.0|I love how dark this movie is. The fact that the angels are also tempted by the evils of humanity is something that makes the movie unique. The movie is set in a time where the dark or \\"evil\\" has taken over and Gabriel is the last of the person, well angel, who can save the day. Finding out what happened to all the other previous archangels is also interesting and sad. The movie has a nice surprise at near the end. The acting is also great though one of the guess kind of sounds like a stereotypical Cali surfer. I wish the US film studios would put out movies like this that are not only visually entertaining and interesting, but also have good acting, and a new take on an old story. I highly recommend watching this film.
B0052VUNHC|1.0|I don't think I can finish this book. I wish I had read all the reviews, this was a waste of my money and time. Totally sappy, adolescent girl fantasy garbage.

B0083GQ2A0|3.0|I watched it pure and simply because Liam Neeson was in it.  I don't like flying so that should have been my first warning to not watch a plane crash.  I kept waiting and then it was the end.  Liam Neeson needs to stick with being a bad ass secret agent!!
0937381888|2.0|This book is full of great information, but is not put together very well. In first chapter he gives you a crash course to brewing which is very generalized and claims that you can brew a good batch of beer based solely on those few pages, which isn't really possible. He then delves into particulars about each ingredient hops, malt extract, etc. Again this information is awesome and can make a beginner a much better brewer. The problem with this book is after chapter 1, which again is very generalized there is no structure as to how to use the ingredients or equipment. He uses terminology that makes you search the book to try to figure out what he's talking about, many times, the word appears later in the book with a definition. I actually read the book twice because I thought I might just not have been paying attention, this wasn't the case, I was constantly looking through the book to see what a word was referring to. As I have said, this is a great book for information about the ingredients, equipment, and science behind brewing beer at home, but it is NOT for the novice or beginning brewer.
B000FC10MU|3.0|Good book, interesting idea, wasn't a huge fan of the ending. Wish the author would have explained his intentions for plots and motifs more directly. Curious as to why he picked certain god characters over others, what was the significance etc. Overall, I was disappointed and think this book was way too hyped up, possibly because people just coo over his work like Stephen Kings. If I had to directly speak to Gaiman, I would say \\"tie it all together more directly\\". Just give us some straight forward inner thoughts about what it all means to you.
B005HSL626|5.0|fruit ninjas is an awesome game.in fruit ninjas you cut as much fruit as you can it is some times tricky because you cant hit the bomb.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Meymoon is totally on point.  I, too, fell victim to the push over this book, bought it to see what all the hoopla was about and was totally disappointed and insulted as the author obviously thought throwing in S&M would equate to literary prominence.  If not for the erotica, this book would fall in the teeny-bopper category, but without the complexity of even the Harry Potter series!  Heck of a PR team, though!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book.  I could not put it down, and honestly, can not wait to read the other two books in the trilogy.  I would have bought the whole trilogy if I would have realized how exciting this book was going to be.  I will also say that I recently saw the movie, and was quite happy with it as well.  The author did a wonderful job telling the story from the main character's point of view.  Again, I can not wait to read the other two books.

B006GKHE6G|5.0|it is very cool game. and its almost. as cool as what ever you think.is cool it works great for kindle fire
B003IKMR0U|5.0|The basic idea of the game is you and the people you're playing with are zombies looking for dinner (or lunch depending on the time of day.... would a zombie care about the time of day???). The game itself is nothing but a cardboard cup and 13 multicolored dice: red, green and yellow. Each dice has Brains(drawn as brains) shotgun blast (blasts) and runners (footprints). As stated in other reviews you score points by eating the brains after you end your turn or lose your turn, and the brains you haven't eaten yet, by getting blasted three times.  The first person who achieves (or in zombie terms eats) 13 or more brains forces the final round then the other players have one last try to beat that score.<br /><br />It's a quick game, we got three games done in under a hour the first time we played it, so it good for that quick game fix before whatever you have to do: work, dinner, school, etc etc. Very recommended.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|When I viewed MIB, I thought it was very funny and highly entertaining. When I viewed MIB2, I felt as if something was missing and did not find it as enjoyable as MIB. I found MIB3 to be the Best of the 3 films, the most entertaining and the most enjoyable science fiction movie I've seen in a long time. The aliens are fascinating, and many credits go to creativity. The time jump will grab your interest as we wonder which future will occur? The acting performance of Brolin and Michael Stuhlburg is superb, they are indeed mesmerizing! The impression of Tommy Lee Jones is incredible and the creatures are visually appealing. Overall, the perfect movie to see with a huge bag of buttered-popcorn!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|very fun and entertaining game and goes in a good pace until ur ready to have a more challenging game play
B005LAIGPA|5.0|It's the kind of science fiction I like to see, entertaining, and enjoyable. Interesting, but not something that will frighten you every second. The first half of the movie introduced the three ordinary high school boys, and how they discovered something mysterious and not so ordinary. After touching and probing, the boys wind up with super-powers. At first, they had fun with harmless pranks, until their dark sides began to take over, then the laughter turned into danger. Their goofy fooling around was harmless at first, and that's where it should have ended. However, their superhuman activities became scary and destructive. The acting was excellent and the riveting story slowly became tense as danger began to lurk. All-in-all, enjoyable and a good science fiction flick.
0525478817|5.0|I first picked up this book the day it came out, not knowing anything about the plot, but knowing that John Green was supposed to be a pretty awesome guy and I would regret not getting it immediately.<br />I opened the book as soon as it was in my hands, and realised it was about cancer. I hadn't read any \\"cancer books\\" but I knew of their heart-wrenching, slightly overdone reputation, and was wary of continuing my reading, but I had just spent 18 dollars on a signed copy, so I didn't have a choice.<br />I couldn't set it down until page 214, which just the mere thought of brings tears to my eyes. I won't tell you why, you'll have to read it to find out. I am a fairly fast reader, finishing the book within six hours of buying it, and from forty minutes before the final page to an hour after finishing it, I sobbed so hard that my parents were worried for my health.<br />To those of you saying that Augustus and Hazel were contrived, metaphorical, unrealistic: I agree with you. They were unrealistic. But that is the beauty of books - they take us into a different world, where human beings can talk about \\"Existentially fraught free throws,\\" the ghettoization of scrambled eggs, and the faults in our stars.<br />It has been, what, four months? since this book was released, and I have read it five times. Each time I have cried and each time I have willed the world to have humans as excellent as Hazel and Gus. The first book I recommend to people when asked, no matter what age, is The Fault in Our Stars, followed by the rest of John Green's work.<br />This book is made of metaphors, many of his books are made of metaphors, but what you must remember is that this book is a work of fiction, as stated by the disclaimer at the beginning. Fiction can be anything you want, metaphor-obsessed teenagers, eloquent cancer victims, and true love that isn't creepy.<br />I highly suggest you read this book, it has changed my view of literature in this year, it was the last thing I read as a thirteen year old four days ago, and it will stay with me for a long time. Please read it, and DFTBAs a thirteen year old four days ago, and it will stay with me for a long time. Please read it, and DFTBA
B005LAIGN2|5.0|The first African-American combat unit to serve in World War II, based on the true story of the Tuskegee Airmen presents a thrilling movie about men who had to fight with honor and dignity against all odds. A remarkable tribute as good as any classic in the making shows through amazing Special Effects in an unforgettable historical adventure. Academy Award-Winner Cuba Gooding Junior delivers an excellent acting performance, the events are realistic, and this patriotic movie is entertaining from beginning to end. The engaging story, combined with high-speed action will hold your interest throughout. The drama becomes more intense as the fighting reaches its peak, and the courage and celebration of the human spirit was enlightening.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It's a must read!! I Couldn't put it down!!Absolutely LOVE this book/trilogy!! Best buy I've made on Amazon yet!! LoL ^_^
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Great game, fun for ALL ages, extremely addicting.  I would've paid more for it.  Love it,  love it,  LOVE IT!!!!!
B006M7JCC2|3.0|Book was OK but the story revolves around the author's near death experience which occurred spontaneously.  There is practically nothing in this book that the typical cancer patient could experiment with or attempt to duplicate unless they know how to trigger a near death experience.  Nonetheless any story where the patient does exhibit some control over their destiny does lift the spirits a bit.
B00005N6KG|2.0|The reason to have a headphone like this is to have something that stays on the head better than ear buds while doing physical activity.  These do not do a very good job at that.  The headset is too rigid, it does not conform well to the head. It does adjust for ear position, but that does not do much to keep the headset fit more snug on the head.  They WILL fall off when you are doing moderate physical activity.  And it doesn't take much force for something to swipe them off (like a strong wind). I can get that with ear buds, so in a way this product fails.<br /><br />The cord also needs at least another foot in length.  My height is as average as a guy can be at 6 feet.  But you cannot put your phone or ipod in your pant pocket without the cord tugging too much on the headset (and eventually pulling them off). The cord is just too short to extend from the head to the bottom of typical pant pockets without being to tight.  Plan on buying a separate arm strap, or having a shirt or top with a pocket closer to the head.<br /><br />Speaker sound is the only thing about this product that is passable.  It's not high fidelity, but good enough when on the go.<br /><br />The price is cheap. But that really means nothing if the headset can't stay on the head reliably when moving around.
B006VC3LES|5.0|I really like this movie.  I saw it originally in the theater.  But having time for breaks and the splendid color and definition of Blu-Ray was great.  This is film noir in color and harkens back to an earlier era of movie making.  I just love the movie.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|I like these puzzles and the app is well executed. But there just isn't enough room on my phone's 3.5&quot; screen for any but the smallest, easiest puzzles, unless I zoom out so far that it's impossible to accurately hit the squares.<br /><br />Seems like this would work great on a tablet, or maybe even a very large phone.
B007G5K066|4.0|I certainly liked this movie.  Having not seen the series with Sir Alec Guinness I have nothing to compare it to. But, it was a good mystery and I had pegged the mole quickly.  This may have deserved a more obscure cast.  That being said, Gary Oldman has cemented his position as one of the great actors currently making movies.  Just an excellent performance.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|I had heard this album before I purchased it, and loved the songs.  Every song on this CD could be released as a single and become a hit.  You really need to listen to the lyrics and you'll have to chuckle at some of them.  Great group and great music.
0525478817|5.0|The fault in our stars is easily one of my favorite books. Its beautifully written. Its sad, funny, and frustratingly perfect. It explores young love in its awkward, sad, heart warming and tragic states. All the characters in this book are so amazing, you can really relate to them and there emotions. And just the way John Green writes is fabulous. And Hazel Grace, she is just the most amazing character! You can really relate to her and her thoughts. Her love for Augustus is outstanding and vise versa. Oh, did I mention how freaking hilarious this book is? TFIOS has also taught me so much about life and love. Also next time I want to egg someones car, I know how(: I did not think a book could evoke so much emotion like this one did. I will love this book till the day I die. John Green is a true genius.

0061251305|5.0|Every once in a while you encounter an idea that acts like a new pair of glasses - suddenly you can see the world with clarity you didn't have a moment before.<br />The subject of today's book review holds that kind of concept. It is a refreshing and graceful addition to and departure from so much of what you find in the leadership section of your book purveyor.<br /><br />Tribal Leadership is one of these<br /><br />First, let's clarify what the authors' aren't talking about.<br /><br />When they use the word \\"tribe\\" or \\"tribal\\", they are not referring to \\"tribalism\\" - the brutal state of people killing one another on the basis of perceived differences in heritage or culture.<br /><br />Rather, they recast \\"tribe\\" as a verb with healthy overtones.<br />Fish school.<br />Birds flock.<br />People tribe.<br /><br />The authors contend (after ten years of studying 24,000 people) that people naturally form groups and that effective leaders pays special attention to the relationship between the leader and the tribe.<br /><br />As with many insights, this might not seem transformational at first glance, but it really is a profound look at the way people organize themselves and how to be an effective leader.<br /><br />Tribal Leadership describes five levels of tribes through which people can progress. An interesting and extraordinarily helpful aspect of the authors' work is that you can assess the level of a tribe by what people say.<br /><br />Behaviors can be more difficult to examine; it is only a matter of listening well to hear what people say.<br /><br />The levels and an abbreviated look at what people in that level tend to say:<br />Level 1 - \\"Life stinks.\\" (Think about a very rough prison where life is nasty and potentially short.)<br />Level 2 - \\"My life stinks.\\" (The person begins to realize not all of life stinks.)<br />Level 3 - \\"I'm great (others aren't).\\"<br />Level 4 - \\"We're great.\\"<br />Level 5 - \\"Life is great.\\"<br /><br />There are several profound insights in Tribal Leadership. One of them is that people almost always go through these stages in sequence. In other words, don't be frustrated and upset with people who are in stage two or three.<br /><br />Rather, recognize where they are and help coach them and the tribe to the next level.<br /><br />Stage 3 in particular, where many American business leaders find themselves, may not seem like a nice place to be. However, during the stage in life where you are building your expertise, it is natural.<br /><br />The good news is you don't have to stay there...<br /><br />Effective leaders serve their people. They know where they are and they are skillfully able to help them navigate to the next level. Great leaders build great tribes.<br /><br />The descriptions of tribes and how to identify yours are useful, but where Tribal Leadership really shines is in the \\"how to\\".<br /><br />At each level, the authors provide very practical advice on how a leader can make the step to the next level AND how they can help individuals and tribes make that transition.<br /><br />I'm intentionally not including any examples of this material - get the book!<br /><br />It's engaging, upbeat, and very helpful. While the research was significant, you won't struggle to wade through it - the research is contained in an appendix and the authors use effective story-telling, illustrations, and reflection questions to help you take the tribal leadership journey.<br /><br />I recommend this book for leaders at every level.<br /><br />If you're just beginning, you'll find a fabulous road map that will shorten your learning curve.<br /><br />If you're a veteran, you'll find confirmation of your experience along with practical help to more effective lead and serve your teams.<br /><br />Did I mention I really, really like this book?<br /><br />Happy Reading,<br /><br />David M.

B006R8GK2Q|4.0|It was nice to see a game that gave you clues and the items weren't too difficult to find. We need more games like this just a little more challenging. I wish we could get more games from big fish they have a lot of these games and they are great to play.

0345803485|5.0|i heard about the book before this media frenzy, this book is AMAZING. I hate to read however this story kept me on the edge of my bed, seat whatever my bum was sitting on. I love it, and just ordered the second book, can't hardly wait.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|It was the free app of the day when I got it, but if I had to pay for it, I most likely would. I love games like this and it's great for when you need to kill time and all you've got is a smart phone.

B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This was one of the best books I have read in a long time.  Just plain good fun reading, very entertaining.  The ending surprised me. Highly recommended for just \\"get away\\" reading.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Powerful message for anyone who wants to be a father.  Movie hits on many different themes, even destructive ones for male lives.  Watch with your kids if they will sit down long enough.
B004I8WD6E|2.0|The case was really good.  The screen protector was easy to put on, the case fit snugly and hasn't stretched at all.  It is thin enough to fit on my iHome charger.<br /><br />However, about 3 months into using the case, it started to yellow slightly.  I washed it thoroughly thinking it was grime on the outside.  Washing did nothing.  I can only assume that the heat from the phone is discoloring the case.  With a black phone, it might look okay, but with my white phone, it looks like my phone is yellowing.<br /><br />I might look to see if the same case is available in colors.
0345803485|5.0|good reading,diffrent and not what you expect.the book is not about the sex but about aventure of two diffrent people finding who they really are.on the second book.every man should read this book to find out what women really want.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|To understand the movie, I think you need to read the book where you learn to know the characters more deeply.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I am mad that I put off reading this book for so long. I absolutely loved the story, the characters, just everything about it. I couldn't put it down and was sad when it ended. The progression of Elizabeth's and Mr. Darcy's relationship and love was beautiful. The family dynamics of the Bennetts was so real. Amazing story, beautifully written.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I had to read this as it's all everyone is talking about. Book one is simply unbelievable. It edges seriously into \\"Harlequin land\\", which I detest. The story is certainly steamy in areas, but overall, I found it to be as poorly written as the Twilight series. Book two was a serious disappointment. I had to check that I really wasn't reading a Harlequin, it was so far fetched and insipid.  (There were so many dumb scenes, but the drink in the face near the end made me laugh, it was so dumb.)<br /><br />I have book three, and am hesitant to bother. Luckily, I got all three e-books from the library, or I'd be kicking myself for the purchase.
B006RUJST6|5.0|This was such a moving story! I couldn't put this down once I started reading.<br /><br />Eighteen year-old Layken, or Lake, has just moved to Michigan from Texas. Her father has just died six months earlier and her mother moves them there because she gets a good job offer and they can no longer afford their house. Immediately after pulling up with the moving van, Lake meets the neighbor across the street, Will, and his little brother Caulder. He's a few years older than Lake, and in her eyes, \\"hot.\\" Caulder and Lake's younger brother, Kel are fast friends, playing the minute Kel jumps out of the moving van. Lake is happy that at least this move won't suck for her little brother. Although things start looking up for Lake when Will asks her out on a date.<br /><br />Will is so different from most guys and so forward. It shocks Lake a little. Their first date is different and in my opinion, amazing! He takes her to a poetry slam which before reading this, I had no idea what it was. It's where people get up in front of an audience and perform a piece of poetry they've written. It's not typical poetry, more like a soul-bearing piece, written and then performed. She's is mesmerized by the first performance and then when Will gets up and performs his, she's a goner! She is taken by him and falls hard, and fast. And he's fallen hard for her, too. Here's a quote from that night that gives me shivers: \\"Patience.\\" he whispers. You don't think that's much? Wait until you read the scene! Lake discovers she has a lot in common with Will. Unfortunately straight after this date, they discover a block to their relationship and have to keep apart. Here's a heartbreaking quote for you:<br /><br />\\"God Layken. How do you do it?\\" she says. \\"How do I do what?\\" I sniff as I continue to wipe the tears from my eyes. \\"How do you not fall in love with him?\\" The tears begin flowing just as quickly as they had ceased.....\\"I don't not fall in love with him. I don't not fall in love with him a lot!\\"<br /><br />Add to this, Lake's mom is all of a sudden leaving often for unexplained errands. As suddenly as things seemed to be falling in place, everything has fallen apart.<br /><br />I can't tell you much I loved this story. I connected so deeply with Lake and Will. I adored the little brothers, Caulder and Kel, and Lake's mom too (even though I was a little angry with her for some things). My heart was pulled in lots of different directions. The reason Lake and Will must stay apart is not Will's fault, but you can't help but blame and get mad at him for his actions. Even when you know you shouldn't. Lake writes and recites a poem and you're right there cheering her on. I know I'm being vague, but I seriously don't want to spoil this for any who haven't read it. This story pulls on all your heart strings! There's also a fair amount of humor in this story that lifts the mood in just the right places.<br /><br />This was such a heartwarming story! I read the sequel straight after because I didn't want to let these character go! Don't let the fact that this is a self-published novel fool you. This was a truly amazing debut for Colleen Hoover. I'll definitely be reading whatever she writes next.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this is a pretty good game when you need to waste a few minutes here and there. play it. its good for a free game.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|fun game.  starts out easy but becoming challenging quickly.  hope I can finish the game without having to buy glu coins.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|I like it better than any match three game. That's for sure.  Probably better on a bigger screen like a tablet but it is easy to learn and does give a new type of challenge.
0345803493|3.0|Loved the first book but soon got sick of the descriptions.  In the second book I started skipping the smut just to find out what was going on in the story line. The story line is not that gripping. Wish I would have waited for my friend to finish her second and third to read instead of purchasing.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I really love this app..but I just wish it would also be available even without the use of the internet.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book was a complete eye opener to years of stomach upset, misdiagnosis as IBS, constant bloated belly, not losing weight when exercising and eating \\"Healthy Whole Grains\\" as we are trained to do. Infinite information that most of us are not privy to in today's world of subsidized, mass produced slop we are fed, then become sick and need medication for these illnesses the government created in the first place. Def a conspiracy. Dr. Davis cites interesting studies in this book, where wheat was eliminated and almost immediately, health was restored. Working in the field of mental health, I found the Schizophrenia study fascinating. It was a study where inpatient psych patients diagnosed Schizophrenic were taken off wheat and wheat products without their knowledge, and they had a reprieve from many of their symptoms. It didn't cure Schizophrenia, but it illustrated how inflammatory wheat ia to the body and mind. Def get this book. I got the Kindle edition for my droid and it worked well. Kudos Dr. Davis! Please keep the research going and write more books!!

B0046ECJBY|5.0|Any one with interest in China has to read this book. I had the opportunity to live and work for 20 years in China, and the book confirm many of my personal experiences with high-level Chinese authorities, as well as the common Chinese of the early \\"Open Door\\" times. A must.
0790734850|5.0|Between the two of you, you should bring along a photographer.    How do you make a great movie?  Make three movies but pull it into one.  In a way, that's the film noir classic formula, but usually it's two sides or one highly confused side.  Of course, there's always one overarching tale that gets wrapped up right there near the end before the hero is faced with a choice.  Three makes it highly risky for confusion, truncation, and easy outs.  But if you can be serpentine without being opaque, brief as in pith, and be willing to be bold, then you may have something.  L.A. Confidential (1997) had something, they had probably the best movie since The Godfather (1972) and it might be better.    Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) is an ambitious political animal of a police officer.  He's a little oily, but ultimately he's clean.  Like a hall monitor.  Bud White (Russell Crowe) is rougher around the edges...and the middle bits too...but he's on the side of justice with an eye out for anti-female activity.  Rough justice, obviously.  Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) is a jaded narcotics officer who's basically kept going for the fun and the glory of it all with gossip columnist, Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito), feeding him cash for collars.  When we met these guys, Mickey Cohen (Paul Guilfoyle), the L.A. mob boss, has just been put away and there's a power vacuum.  Things kick off and a dense drama of intrigue and mystery unfolds with our three heroes taking their separate threads through it all.    Cops in the 50's.  Film noir storytelling.  Can't go wrong.  Well, yes it can.  You just need overwrought dialogue, hammy acting, and a pathetically trivial underlying story.  But I can see how if you saw L.A. Confidential, you'd get the wrong idea.  It works and comes together so near flawlessly that it looks easy.    Don't get me wrong.  The dialogue might trip up (very little) here and there.  The acting does come off a little overdone--a little singed, maybe.  And the underlying story?  No,that's pretty much fantastic.    My measurement is really very simple and I'm sure you understand it.  The amount of troubles-and I use the term very gently-in a movie are counted off against the amount of great moments.  If an element is otherwise fine-not-great, it will sink the movie when things go badly.  Basic accounting, really.    The dialogue in L.A. Confidential has its most significant trip, in my opinion, when Exley meets up with Lana Turner look-alike Lynn Bracken (Kim Basinger).  I'm not sure whether it's two Aussies messing with each other's accents or what, but the words seem stilted and punchy.  On the assets side, you've got a dozen (at a guess) terrific lines with one or two that would go down in history if audiences didn't see a hundred movies a year.  It won for Best Adapted Screenplay, by the way.    It's got to be worth noting that three of the four main characters are Australian.  Points?  What's more amazing about that is that Pearce and Crowe hadn't made much before this.  I take this to be the main reason that many people haven't seen this movie.  (A perception that may be flawed due to the fact that I was 12 when it came out and didn't know anybody that saw it.)  Spacey was already known as a great actor, but really only in support-and he's basically just support in this too-but he always provides a lot of support.  Pearce and Crowe are very good and great, respectively, but Spacey is off the charts.  He nails every moment he's given.    Looking at the cover, though, you'd think Basinger is the crux of the mystery and Spacey's the main character with two menacing skin-heads chasing him.  Weird.  Basinger won for Best Supporting Actress that year.  Fair enough, but she is, at best ancillary and a dribbling font of information.    But what puts this movie into the Top Whatever of my favorite movies is the story.  This movie clocks in at 2:18 and I'm riveted the whole time.  Sure, I've got a pretty good attention span for movies, but I'm notjust staving off boredom, I'm living the dream.  That's not because of constant gun battles, either.  This is mystery done right with characters we're interested in.  I don't think anybody gets short changed and I wouldn't change a scene (other than to tweak some dialogue).    Curtis Hanson, who directed and co-wrote with Brian Helgeland, did a superb job.  He uses the music to perfection (Jerry Goldsmith), he obviously kept the story flowing, but there's also the pace on screen that tracks perfectly (editor, Peter Honess--ha, his Ho-ness.  Sorry Pete).  When the characters are in a hurry, the story moves quickly, when the characters are taking their time, the emotional nuance is on display.  Ultimately, with a great movie the director is going to get the credit, but it's a nice touch that Hanson probably deserves it as well.    I don't want to jinx it, but you've got to admire Hollywood's restraint.  Talk about a movie that screamed out for a sequel but never got one.  Without giving too much away, there's a dynamic duo that develops and still has the rest of the 50's and 60's to conquer.  If not a sequel, where's the TV series?  I never thought Hollywood had a conscience, but I may have to reconsider.    The term film noir is wildly over-used these days, but L.A. Confidential actually deserves the label.  We think of film noir as something good, or at least I do, and that means we have to limit the term to the right elements.  I can't distinguish the necessary from the sufficient just now, but let's say the police, crime, mystery, wit, moral ambiguity, and a sexy moll need to be in the discussion.  [....]

B003Y5H53S|5.0|It's a puzzle!  It's like a big ol' mammogram.<br /><br />That's what we call a malapropism and it's the backbone of Rango (2011).  I love a pun.  Preferably a pun that is as close to the \\"intended\\" word as possible-orange in \\"orange you glad I didn't say banana\\" sounds nothing like \\"aren't\\" while mammogram does sound like anagram.  Puns aren't all Rango has to offer, it does physical comedy, poop jokes, and much much more.  It's flat out hilarious.<br /><br />A chameleon (Johnny Depp) is without an identity.  He does some acting, has a one act play, and a musical he's working on, but still he can't quite answer that old existential quandry-who am I?  After \\"an ironic, unexpected event, propel[s] the hero\\" onto the highway and into the city of Dirt, an improvisational response to an awkward bar scene gives him a name, Rango, and a colorful history.  Soon, as is wont to happen, he's sheriff of this dusty old town with the tycoon turtle (Ned Beatty) as its mayor and he's got a mystery on his hands-there's a water shortage and we aren't sure what's causing it.  Beans (Isla Fisher) knows there's been some water being dumped in the desert, but she can't figure it.  Off they go to find the answer, but our villains are crafty and Rango has to find out who he really is.<br /><br />\\"Is this heaven?\\" asks Rango.  \\"If it were we'd be eating Pop Tarts with Kim Novak,\\" replies the Spirit of the West (Timothy Olyphant).<br /><br />The dialogue is great, but the soundtrack is wonderful.  Finally, a movie that has a pitch-perfect sense of music.  Perhaps this is in major part due to its magpie collection of the best sounds westerns have offered.  I flatter myself that I heard Once Upon a Time in the West (1968), The Magnificent Seven (1960), and obviously Ride of the Valkyries, to my infinite pleasure they played for longer than ten seconds.  But I almost cheered when they played Harmonica's Theme at the climax of the movie.  Chills, just thinking about it (well, thinking about itto the youtube link I just put there-DIE SOPA DIE!).  It's a travesty that the song Rango didn't get nominated for Best Original Song, but I imagine that particular category has seen more travesty than equity in its existence.<br /><br />Oh yeah, this is an animated movie.  Freaking amazing animation.  It's dry and realistic.  The sun burns into your eyes to show that it's pretty hot in the desert.  Rango, which they obviously put the time into, is a scalychameleon but he doesn't glisten like a dinosaur in Jurassic Park (1993)-after all, it's raining at the park, but it's dry in the desert.  This bad boy's getting all ten on IMDB.  At the climax, I did want some heavily repeated close-ups on the eyes of the duelists, but hey, you can't get everything.<br /><br />This movie was made (with others, I'm sure) by Gore Verbinski who is responsible for Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003) and the two pale imitations-but not the worst offender, at least.  He's also doing the Lone Ranger movie slated for 2013.  Not a devotee of the Ranger, I hadn't invested that much emotion into the idea of its success or failure, but whatever doubts I had have evaporated after seeing Rango.  Verbinski is well versed in the western-or at least its greatest incarnations-but should stop fooling around and bring John Logan in to rewrite the thing.  Looking at Logan's credits makes my jaw drop.  Some crap, to be sure, but a number of excellent films including the upcoming Bond movie, Skyfall.  Hehehehe.  That's how I feel right now.<br /><br />Drawbacks?  Hmm.  Let's see...  None.  Go see it, go buy it.  Now.  Go.

1612130283|5.0|I decided to read this one mainly because of all the hype (great marketing on their part). I was not dissappointed! It is a great read! But based on the reviews, only for certain people. It sucks you in and then gets a bit weird, but you have to continue at that point. It gets exciting and mysterious as you go. I got to the point where I was sick of reading through the sex scenes, but sometimes a clue to mystery is given during these scenes. This is a love story, and a mystery, with a little porn sex, which plays into a huge part of the mystery. For the ones that did not enjoy it, I'm sorry, but I would have to guess that you are a bit uptight!

0345803485|3.0|I wanted to like this book, and partly I do. I read it one day which is a good sign. I didn't want to put it down. However, it never really got there for me. In the end, I just don't really care that much. Let me say though, that the scathing reviews of this book are unfounded. While it was not the greatest novel I ever read, it was good erotica. The characters are real and fairly well-devoloped. The writing is good. It's just that, like most erotic fantasy, it's unrealistic. The young female main character is really stupid to get involved with Grey. I kept thinking about my twenty something daughters and feeling grateful they are not so stupid. Granted, I am not into sado-masochism, but no young woman should feel safe getting involved with a man who WANTS to hurt her. The author wants to create a strong character but fails because the concept is flawed. This character would not have gone back to his house. Plus, the character only plays his games for him. This makes her even weaker. If she wanted to be submissive, but wasn't comfortable with it because of societies expectations, that would make the story (and the character) stronger, but she does it for him. Yuck.<br /><br />The sex scenes are powerful fantasy. For a BDSM master, he's not very domineering. This makes the book more readable to the non-BDSMer. However, I found his sexual prowess unbelievable. Even at 27, he would not be able to keep up multiple nights of multiple encounters. Not realistic. And making him so physically attractive that waitresses swoon? Eh. I wasn't sold.<br /><br />That said, I did enjoy the erotica and didn't stop reading until I was done.

And recording the Big Hit of Ann Margaret , in the 70s , \\" Baby , It's Cold Outside \\" ! Her already known Hit \\" Creepin' In \\" , with Dolly Parton ! One that I did not know , is \\" Take Off Your Cool \\" ( Outkast ), it's beautiful and ...Cool !  So , you won't repent of buying this Album , really !
B007V2UGPE|5.0|hey all you people who say glitches in menu it just takes a bit of time to get it started so seriously don't give it a Ba review stop
B005UD67IQ|5.0|Just absolutely magnificent.  Somehow the intensity comes through. And the statements by Senna about God etc. are not superficial: it somehow shows that something so objectively insignificant (driving a damn car around a track) can be elevated to greatness.<br /><br />I cannot put my finger on how exactly the director made it such an excellent film.  But it is.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|this game is the best it is so fun and mysterious I think everyone should her and play it.<br /><br />FUN
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Awesome! I could play for hours & not get tired of it... I love puzzles that make to think on different levels. This game tests one's logic and creativity all at the same time... I love it & would recommend it to anyone who likes a challenge.
B0012Y22KO|5.0|I got introduced to Toto via an interview with Brett Detar of the now defunct The Juliana Theory. In a DVD interview, he mentioned how one of his band mates would not stop playing certain songs by some band called Toto. Who?<br /><br />Well, whoever they were, he played three short excerpts of the songs \\"Rosanna\\", \\"Hold The Line\\" and \\"Africa\\". O my days! About fifteen seconds of each song, and the brief melodies got stuck in my head!<br /><br />When, exactly, did I discover Toto? Um...about a week ago.<br /><br />I am 21 and only just starting to explore classic rock. So far, my favourite is Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. Amazing songwriter. Also, Fleetwood Mac (from 1975 onwards), Chris Rea, The Beatles and The Doors. Loads of research, loads of band searches. Loads of reviews and websites. I can honestly say, aside from one song on a rock compilation I never really play, I have never, ever heard of Toto until I watched my Juliana DVD (the Juliana Theory were one of the finest modern rock bands. Like Toto, they never truly got the respect they deserved).<br /><br />This is a real shame, for they are genuinely amazing!<br /><br />Straight after looking for Toto products on Amazon, I came across this box set. Amazing value! 7 albums plus 1 live DVD for £12.00 is a no brainer. I took the plunge, and about four or five days after hearing this for the first time, I can honestly say I am in love!<br /><br />This is amazingly played, tuneful and most of all memorable pop music. I say \\"pop\\" because its a bit hard to categorise. R'n'B, prog, rock even metal influences shine through the various performances, but the resounding feature of the songwriting is without a doubt the exuberant melodies: this is distinctly pop music, but without the narrow minded approach most artists make to stick to one specific genre. This is fun stuff!<br /><br />Quick reviews:<br /><br />Toto-<br />Ok, the debut: 5 stars<br /><br />Highlights? Pretty much all the tracks, but the opening gut-punch of \\"Child's Anthem\\", \\"I'll Supply The Love\\", \\"Georgie Porgy\\", and \\"Manuela Run\\" is astounding in its variety and catchiness! The big hit single \\"Hold The Line\\" is a real classic, and \\"Angela\\", the closing number, is one song that has stood the test of time very well: after all these years, the shift in dynamics half way through still sounds so fresh, and I was not expecting it. Nothing about this album sounds cliched, although it feels very much like a '70's album. I am 21. I wish I were 30 years older! Cannot find a single thing to complain about! All good songs here!<br /><br />Hydra-<br />Ok, not entirely into this one (as yet) 3 stars<br /><br />I love the opening, self-titled track. \\"99\\" is good too, but its not really been played properly yet (its only been a few days!). So far, my least favourite (but that may change!)<br /><br />Turn Back<br />Is this meant to be rubbish? 4 stars<br /><br />Ok, apparently this album is supposedly a poorer Toto effort, judging by its lack of commercial success and no hit singles. Why? There are at least 3 brilliant rock classic on this: \\"Gift With A Golden Gun\\", \\"English Eyes\\" and my favourite, \\"I Could Stand You Forever\\". This may just become my number one Toto album in time!<br /><br />Toto IV<br />The BIG one: 4.5 stars<br /><br />Not quite a rock classic like Born To Run or Rumours, but my goodness! The hooks! \\"Rosanna\\" is so addictive it should either be number one, or else banned! Seriously, amazing tune! \\"Africa\\" is a classic. Again, I know I should have, but until this week I had never, EVER heard a single song on this album. I haven't lived... Anything else? \\"Make Believe\\" is great, the rest simply blurring into a mass of heavenly goodness. Seriously, its been ages since pop music has had such an immense effect on my senses!<br /><br />Isolation<br />Played once- 3.5 stars<br /><br />Have yet to really get stuck into this one. My verdict? I liked it very much while it played, but I liked IV and Fahrenheit a lot more! Look forward to replaying it soon, however...<br /><br />Fahrenheit<br />Miles Davis? 5 stars<br /><br />Miles Davis? Ok...that simply blew my mind. I saw his name in the credits, and just knew I would have to really listen to this album. Also, the vocalist (Joseph Williams?) did the singing voice of adult Simba in The Lion King, a favourite of mine. That's a nice bit of trivia, but I wouldn't have guessed, as to me he sounds like a more sophisticated Michael Jackson, a lot of soul in his voice (I gather his vocal style may have reflected certain trends of the 1980's, but I love it!). \\"I'll Get Over You\\" is extraordinarily powerful. This is a pop song on the same high level as ABBA, Fleetwood Mac, and The Beatles. Simply spellbinding! The first 3 songs are terrific, especially \\"We Can Make It Tonight\\" and \\"Without Your Love\\". Its '80's pop at its finest! But the albums finest moment overall is the astoundingly beautiful instrumental \\"Don't Stop Me Now\\" featuring...Miles Davis. Ok, I love Kind Of Blue, a jazz classic. But I also love how he brings his distinct energy to this smooth number, whilst still keeping the flow of the rest of the album. I honestly cannot understand how its taken me 21 years to discover this pop gem. A masterpiece? Why not! Its a darn side better than Lady Gaga (although her \\"Marry The Night\\" would have sounded at home on this album). And a million miles better than Justin Bieber! Classic, I'm loving the energy of this one!<br /><br />The Seventh One<br />Toto IV pt. 2? 3 stars<br /><br />This one has yet to grab me, though at this point in the week I may simply be Toto-ed out. Is it going to grow on me? No doubt about it, \\"Stay Away\\" is so good. It strongly reminds me of Megadeth's and Lacuna Coil's Cristina Scabbia's powerful duet of \\"A Tout Le Monde\\" from 2007. I really dig this track. \\"Stop Loving You\\" is very good, as is \\"Rosanna Pt. 2\\", I mean \\"Pamela\\" and the very african (and \\"Africa\\"-lite) \\"Mushanga\\". Excellent drumworkon the last track! Not yet fully into this one, but I liked it a lot, and like Isolation, I'm looking forward to replaying it again!<br /><br />Greatest Hits Live<br />Decent DVD. Rubbish camerawork. 3 stars<br /><br />So, its been less than a week with this box set, but I am so impressed with this! I've never heard anything by this band before, so it has been refreshing to listen to an old-school band without any preconceived ideas. How Toto are not as highly esteemed as other bands of the era like Journey, Fleetwood Mac, Bon Jovi and Bruce Springsteen shall forever be a mystery to me, now that I've heard this. Also, how can a band of musicians so well renowned and talented as this go unnoticed by the 21st Century media? These are amazing songs, and the quality, and catchiness of a song like \\"I'll Get Over You\\" simply screams for karaoke meltdown on a Friday night, if only it were more well known!<br /><br />And finally, Toto are uncool? Um...how does that explain the love for '80's cheese-bombs like Wham!, A-ha and T'Pau? Toto are nothing but awesome!<br /><br />Either that, or I am just not cool. O well, who needs to fit in with the majority when you have a small box of immense treasure sitting on your shelf!<br /><br />(I may update this is a few months, but I can't see me changing my views too much (aside from perhaps an improved respect for Hydra and The Seventh One).)<br /><br />As a set, I give this a strong 4.5 out of 5. Small points lost due too slightly sub par artwork quality: I'm sure my printer could have done a better job!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved all the books it took me three days to read all. I didn't want the book to end I wanted more. I hope another book comes out soon.

0553582038|3.0|As much as I have loved this series so far, I just couldn't get into a Feast for Crows. I totally understand that Mr. Martin is building more character levels and setting the background for future plots (gotta love all those twists and turns); however, I really lost interest. It is possible that Crows was a \\"let-down\\" for me after all the action in the first 3 in the series, or maybe I was too disinterested to catch onto the subtleties of the plot. Regardless, I have found there to be at least one \\"weak\\" book in every multi-book series I've read, but I've also found it rewarding to Keep Reading! George RR Martin is still a brilliant and inventive writer in my humble opinion.
B0000E5NPZ|5.0|I just saw this movie on the screen at the Film Forum in NYC. I'm a Otto Preminger fan but this time I fell in love with Jean Seberg she is such a natural. So cute, sweet, talented, devious and yet innocent. Her hair style is how Emma Watson (Harry Potter) has now also!!
0451457994|5.0|If you've seen the movie you have the gist of this book, though the book  actually explains all of the screen imagery that might not have made much  sense by itself.  At least that was my experience with it.  Basically  aliens bootstrap intelligence around the Universe, and we are one example  of that.  Humans travel to Saturn to find out what the mystery of the black  obelisks are, and the ship's computer goes mad.  Don't want to give too  much away for those who haven't read Clarke's masterpiece, so get it and  read it.  And remember, any science advanced enough will seem like magic.  Characters take second place to setting and story, unlike most modern  books, but still a great read.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|a really good game that is fun to play I like it a lot a good starter game for young kids
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's game was Orson Scott Card's entry into the field of science  fiction.  He may have written things before, and has certainly written many  other works since, but this was his masterpiece.  Ender is a child raised  to be a warrior in an interstellar war, playing a game that he believes is  a simulation.  That is all I will say about that, since more would give too  much away.  Ender is a memorable character in a tense situation, a child  with the fate of his civilization unknowingly thrust upon his shoulders.  Another standard for anyone who wants to be an expert on science fiction.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Like sudoku but less mathy. The soundtrack is unobtrusive and defaults to a music player. Figuring out the images is highly satisfying.
B001F0WXY0|5.0|Herbert's masterpiece about a Galactic Empire and the one planet that  supplies spice, the substance that increases life span and allows  navigators of the guild to move ships safely across interstellar distances.  To rule Arrakis is to control the spice, but rule of the planet is a  double edged sword, painting a target on the back of the nobleman who  rules.  The Atriedes family is given control of the spice, and the Harkonen  family wants it.  Paul is the son of the Duke, and escapes the attack,  making it out into the sands of the desert planet, where the giant  sandworms live, and the Freeman congregate, ready to form the new Duke's  army.  Won't say anymore that gives the story away, but this was an unusual  setting for memorable characters to play in, and the start of a series that  still continues today with Herbert's sone writing the stories.  A great  read and a necessary one for anyone who wants to be considered an expert in  the field of science fiction.
B003Y5H5EW|3.0|Michael sits this one out for 99% of this episode.  Apparently Selene has given Michael a daughter, which neither of them gets to meet for twelve years due to being captured and cryogenically caged.  We aren't shown an intimate copulation scene, so it is possible gene splicing in a laboratory was done in vitro style.  This clearly is a stepping stone into what is hoped by the producers to be a very lucrative and long term franchise.  I may only be one fan, but I'm going to suggest that they don't make special FX more affordable by using foggy darkness and blurred camera shots.  Obviously vampires don't need a lot of light to git-r-done, and lycans aren't given to requiring light either; however, YOUR  VIEWERS DO ya morons.  This sequel is a pitiful example of reclining upon the laurels of past accomplishments, using similar themes and exploiting Kate Beckinsale's physical attraction so thoroughly I'm surprised she wasn't wrung out like she'd been through a juicer.  I'm losing interest in the \\"Underworld\\" series after seeing how the producers are short-sheeting their fans in this latest film.  When I started watching the series in 2003, I was very eager to get my hands on \\"Evolution,\\" and \\"Rise of the Lycans.\\"  I pre-ordered this 4th sequel, \\"Awakening\\" hoping it would continue to build on how intensely amazing the first three were.  Please don't spend all the budget on red epic 3-D camera gadgetry.  How can something that starts out so great end up so mediocre??  The producers are still over $177 million in the black, from the first four in this series, and need to re-invest some of it.  I will give them one more chance, but if \\"Underworld\\" sequel five sags from the first four like \\"Awakening\\" did from the first three, this fan is done, regardless of how tight Kate Beckinsale's latex cat suit gets.  FYI, the \\"R\\" rating is for language, violence and gore; not for nudity, not for sexual situations, and not for adult themes.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like playing all of the games but I don't like only starting with 10 games. it takes forever to unlock games.
B0043KFA8U|5.0|Here is an example of a talented artist who has earned the right to expand his parameters. Some are portraying him as falling back to his work with John Mayall. That ship doesn't sail. This offering is nothing like the Blues Breakers, except that it isn't Rock and Roll or pure blues. Actually it sounds closer to the tunes that that he recorded with J.J. Cale on the disc called The Road to Escondido, where Clapton commented, \\"I could do this sort of music until the cows come home.\\"  Of course there are some track that even more sounds will echo with this one, such as the horns on \\"When Somebody Thinks You're Wonderful,\\" which gives a Louisiana-New Orleans feel to this set.<br /><br />Diversity should be embraced!  I watched as Leon Russell's career took a swan dive ONLY because he wanted to do more and Rolling Stone slammed \\"Stop All That Jazz.\\" It made no sense? It was solid jazz all the way.  Then Russell really slapped \\"the stone\\" down with his infamous \\"Hank Wilson\\" releases. This should have never been surprising. I mean Leon at 17 years old was a key part of Phil Spectors \\"Wall of Sound,\\" playing on recordings such as Brabra Streisand, Frank Sinatra and the Beach Boys as well as dozens and dozens of other recording artists.<br /><br />Eric will never be pushed out of the spotlight, because he is loved and worshiped around the world. I own every CD that Eric has ever released, as a single celebrity or in the many groups that he has pushed to fame. My first time seeing him live was with Cream and the second was two years ago.  Anytime he comes near my home town, I'll be there again.
B005ZUR724|4.0|its awesome for a mobile app I enjoy playing it on my kindle so far not any bugs that weren't to be expected
B003INBNXO|5.0|Ok let me start my review this way. I'm a 49 year old black woman that grew up on Kung Fu Theater. I was a bit of a tomboy back then and I guess that part of me kinda stuck around because I still like \\"guy\\" movies-- everything from Spartacus, Platoon, Goodfellas, and of course, Kung Fu.  Over the years I've watched Bruce Lee to Ong-Bak and everything in between.  I'm in love with this movie. .seriously not only did it have a message, but the fights were like that-- and Ip Man was such a cool character while he was kicking butt. . awesome, absolutely awesome.  If you like this kinda movie, look no further you've arrived.

B007V2UGPE|2.0|This is an excellent game. I like the objective of the game. However, I gave it two stars for a reason. This game steals your money!! That is what I bate about this game and Glue Mobile. Every one of their games are free but you have to buy everything with real money if you want to get anywhere in the game. My advice: do NOT get the game.
0061564893|5.0|This book was the most interesting, mind boggling, history changing book I ever read.  Once I started reading I could not put the book down.  It has proof, in many forms, that we/I were not taught the correct history in school as put forth by the American school systems.  It comes under the heading of, \\"the winner of the war writes the history books\\".  The Europeans apparently did not know of the Chineese maritime world voyages and discoveries.  It is an excellent book and easy to read.<br />[[ASIN:0061564893 1421: The Year China Discovered America (P.S.)]]
B004QOB8SO|5.0|If you enjoyed the sheer creative quirkiness of Season 1 of SHERLOCK, the originality continues. There is no formula for these shows. The surprise continues to surprise. In Season 2, three classic Sherlock stories are updated and tweaked to fit modern times.<br /><br />1. A Scandal in Belgravia, 2. The Hounds of Baskerville and 3. The Reichenbach Fall are the three stories brought to life and color. In A Scandal in Belgravia, the dominatrix Irene Adler is introduced. Is she the perfect woman for Sherlock? Will her feminine wiles beguile him and make him lose his senses and mind? Loved the ending in this one. There is an adult theme, with the cracking of Adler's whip, so remove small children and animals from the room.<br /><br />In The Hounds of the Baskerville, Sherlock's most famous mystery, the plot is really toyed with. This one is the most terrifying of the three stories. It has a sci-fi cast to the plot, if you like that sort of thing. Finally, The Reichenbach Fall, Sherlock meets Moriarty head on in mind-to-mind combat. Who will triumph? The ending will have you brainstorming different hypotheses for what really happened, how did they do that, and what will happen next, making you wistful regarding having to wait a year to find out. I wonder if we'll see Moriarty in Season III...<br /><br />Really, the writers/producers need to produce more shows each season. Three are not enough. How about five or seven shows, as in DOWNTON ABBEY? You can still have a little quantity without sacrificing quality.<br /><br />This second series makes you like this enactment of Dr. Watson even more and Sherlock seems to be softening, becoming more vulnerable emotionally and humane, before your very eyes. Or is it an act? Season Three will tell. We can't wait!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Pretty cool game to waste time.  Not bad for free.  I don't like cash shops but it is not a big deal here.

B000P12LWY|5.0|This dvd series (this review referencers the complete series) is the Anne Bolyn/Henry The Eighth Royal Disaster story; the intellectual version of \\"Ann of a Thousand Days\\".  And speaking of a thousand days, a thousand ways, this particular Royal Caper was certainly designed to put Men of God on the Spot, without much \\"meaningful help from Above\\"  to guide them as they attempt to keep the Royal's carnal sins from sinking everybody's boat, especially their own.<br /><br />In a nutshell, because this story is too involved to be detailed successfully before viewing - you must decide whether or not you want to refresh history for yourself.  Henry The VIII, of roving eye and little Faith, has taken a Queen far older than he as a matter of Royal Convenience.  (Catherine of Aragon, widow of Prince Arthur who was also Henry VIII's brother)  A special Papal dispensation was obtained in this matter to keep the money, the politics, the control and the Religion in the family, even though it must  be tweaked by lawyers and Cardinals to keep it Sacred.  Catherine is too mature to be of interest to Henry anymore now that the duty required has been satisfied, but she is nobody's fool.  That fact complicates matters, as Henry needs an heir as well as a hoyden.  (He seems to be partial to Anne's and Catherines) There's no shortage of candidates, the stickler comes in the form of all those Red Robes - but in a pinch, even those are expendable.<br /><br />The story is a very old and very repeated one in every age leading up to present, of women of intelligence controlled by men who are in turn, controlled by something else; with these women finding ways to circumvent that control and triumph over it all if only for a short while.  ( This doesn't work for everybody; and sometimes, of course, this method has been proven to backfire more than once, as Anne Bolyn eventually finds out in Spades, quite probably quenching her youthful confidence as well as her misplaced, flaming desires permanently.)  Of course, even if they knew better, these women were merely pawns on the board - who must eventually do the bidding even if it hurt.<br /><br />This series is excellent, and if you are into historical tales of Merry Olde England, this is highly recommended.  It is amazingly complicated, intriguing, heartbreaking and downright foolish as it envelopes it's players in it's Royal Quagmire.  If anything will make you confused about all the Rules and Regulations of Structured Life anywhere, (and not strictly limited to the Royal blood among us), this should do it up brown.  It should also alleviate any wonder about why we fought the American Revolution to rid ourselves of such as this.
B004GYY714|5.0|This ap is the first one i ever did a review on since i got my kindle.  this is so cool to hear other music in other states.  I get so tired of hearing the same music over and over on my local stations.  this is priceless! !!!
0780619951|3.0|Every now and then, there's a tale so creepy you find it impossible to forget and also uneasily suspect it's not fiction at all - it may just be ahead of it's time, like the \\"Nautilus\\".  This particular laboratory is not \\"twenty thousand leagues under the sea\\", but out in the middle of it on dry land.<br /><br />\\"The Island of Dr. Moreau\\" was dreamed up and written in book form by H.G. Wells, the of master science fiction imagination - and he didn't hold back when he unleashed his pen on this one.  In most instances, the book that a movie is based on is much better than the film for some strange reason, mostly because license taken by filmmakers is something I don't understand - but in this case I make an exception until something better comes along.  Some things are worse in the flesh than in the written word and this idea must be seen to obtain the full monte.  It's one of those films we secretly want to watch no matter what because it's so outrageously interesting - and simply to be properly horrified when we have so few real opportunities that are worth doing.  I had seen the original, but the fledgling special effects available at the time of it's filming left a lot to be desired, and as a result, the visual concept went wanting.  This one employs the latest technology in special effects realism, and the results are truly gruesome and satisfying. There, I've said it, and revealed my shame!<br /><br />It's a story all too possible in the laboratories of today, and personally, I have little doubt that somewhere deep in a disgruntled lunatic's basement or maybe even in a locked room of a sanctioned biotech research center, a test tube bubbles over with a manipulated embryo or two - sporting furry tails and a fully functioning cranium, minus a few essentials therein just to keep it interesting for the fool tweaking the cells.  Science Fiction doesn't corner the market on weird -  there's also a real world out there.  It doesn't feel very comforting to suspect this,but it does make it titillating while watching a film.  (The only other story - IMO_  ((book form)) that comes close to the originality of this one is \\"The Most Dangerous Game\\" by Richard Connell.)<br /><br />The casting of Marlon Brando as weak-wristed Dr. Moreau, was then far past his prime but effective because of it .  He has found a secret island to cloak his secret scientific obsession; working nefarious magic with cells and insanity, aided by genius; a King in total control of his maimed subjects.  Val Kilmer as his teetering-on-the-edge assistant;  one can't help but feel Dr. Moreau has performed some covert practice procedure on him too, somewhere along the line to confirm such obedience.<br /><br />I feel this wild and crazy story possibly deserves a better film treatment, no doubt - because there's plenty of room to capture a myriad of periphery essentials. (Marlon Brando, with all due respect, didn't quite capture the essence of what H.G. Wells intended for someone like Dr. Moreau, in my opinion.)  But until that happens, this one is better than the old original that brought out the hairy gorilla suit brigade - Burt Lancaster aside, of course.
B007FY9ZWI|4.0|Seems to be a good player.  Very nice to have a working EQ, but it has a quirk/feature that when you plug in the headphones it automatically launches and plays where you left off.

B0023SDPS6|4.0|With the new Walt Longmire series starting up for summer television, I wanted to see what the character was about.  I'd been hearing about Craig Johnson and Longmire for a few years, and had even picked up books that I hadn't gotten around to reading.  I once saw him at a book signing and should have introduced myself, but didn't.  Now, after reading The Cold Dish, I think we might have had more to talk about than I'd at first assumed.<br /><br />Walt Longmire, the sheriff of Absaroka County, is a backwoods lawman with an easygoing manner and a no-nonsense way of dealing out justice.  He patrols the open wilds of Wyoming in a pickup truck he calls the bullet, is trying to get over losing his wife, and figuring out a reason to get up every morning in a house that's only half-built.<br /><br />Truthfully, during the first half of the novel, I felt like I'd read this particular story one time too many.  Over the years, I've met several detective protagonists like Longmire who have too many of the same problems.  Even the Vietnam War background, which has certainly grown long in the tooth and dates the hero perhaps more than the author intends (since Longmire was at the Tet Offensive, he's got to be in his mid-sixties now), didn't overly interest me.  That, too, has been done.<br /><br />I liked Henry Standing Bear and Deputy Victoria Moretti well enough, but again, I'd seen too many like them along the way.  The characters were rendered well enough, but - strangely - they didn't seem to be onstage enough during some of the action.<br /><br />The murders were fairly standard too, and I had the murderer pegged right out of the gate.  I was actually kind of disappointed that I had it right so early on, and that the motive wasn't actually revealed until the final act.  A lot of experienced mystery readers will probably feel the same way.<br /><br />However, I'm glad I stuck with the book.  Things really started coming together in the second half, but it's more the land and the history of the place that brings the edge to the story and the writing.  There are some really nice touches that echo the Old West and the supernatural without ever stepping over the line.  And there's enough action to finish out nicely.<br /><br />I've already ordered the second book and should get to it before the debut of the new Longmire series on A&E on June 3rd.  Looking forward to the show.  The trailers have been awesome.the history of the place that brings the edge to the story and the writing.

B005LAIHIQ|5.0|I have been an avid fan of Dark Shadows since it began in 1966 (pre-Barnabas).  I have also long been a fan of the talented Johnny Depp.  That said, I was delighted to hear he was finally filming a version of the show he so loved as a child.<br /><br />I really enjoyed his performance (and that of the superb supporting cast).  It was entertaining, enjoyable and  respectful, but certainly had it's own take on the original show.  I thought Johnny's nod to the late Jonathan Frid was as inspired as it was touching.<br /><br />Go see the film -- and enjoy it for what it is, not what it is not....

B00004RITP|4.0|Being sovereign in my domain, there is one composer who is persona non grata if not an outright brigand in the realm: Gustav Mahler - wanted dead or alive.<br /><br />I'm bewildered by this cult. Many a dear friend goes loopy at the mention of his name.  Here on Amazon, a Mahler Mafia is thoroughly entrenched and its hit-men zealously enforce the cartel. Perhaps - and I readily concede this - my lack of interest could be attributed more to the loose wires hanging out the back of my head than any shortcomings in the music itself; even so, I draw great satisfaction from the author of the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus:  &#34;Throughout (his) notebooks, the contrastive reading against Shakespeare runs parallel with a reflection on the brilliant but, to Wittgenstein, ultimately false, merely technical accomplishment of Mahler and the life-giving, transcendent truth of Bruckner.&#34;<br /><br />That makes two of us. For what my views are worth - near-zippo - I glean excellence in the outer movements of the Ninth and parts of the Tenth and that's about it. Hershey's Chocolate always comes to mind when I think of the Fourth. Truth to tell, I'd rather have some teeth extracted by &#34;Dr&#34; Quackenstein - a maestro with a bike-chain - than sit through a monstrosity such as the Eighth. One day, buttressed by Red Bull, I hope to encompass the Third Symphony with its faux Bruckner finale.  Likewise, I've never been able to make it through the Second; much like Shackleton, I chart my &#34;push on the pole&#34; to the final bar. And even the Mayor of Hiroshima, no stranger to horrors, says no to the finale of the Seventh.<br /><br />Re the Tenth: to my antipodean ears, the opening movement and the second Scherzo are fluff. The Purgatio is pleasant enough. The raison d'être of the symphony comes with the first Scherzo and the finale. In both instances, the rawness of Mahler's pain - yep, his consort was a strumpet - takes one into a realm that's far removed from those silly hammer blows of fate or the &#34;microwaved marches&#34;. Indeed if you're heartbroken yourself and on the verge of making a very silly decision - and I speak from experience here - the finale should be avoided like cat-stew. For once, the rhetoric rings true. It ends in desolation and dust. Aristotle would say that it's the definition of catharsis.<br /><br />To my mind, this is Rattle's greatest record by far. It's flawless. No fussiness is evident. Even if Herbie had turned his mind to the Tenth, I cannot imagine that Rattle would have much to fear. Here is music that he believes in, heart and soul, and mastery is resultant. Sir Simon evokes a primordial response from the Berliners - and yet paradoxically, the orchestra might be considered too cultivated in their palette - but what cultivation it is! The EMI recording is superlative. Five stars for the performance and recording - two stars for the music: so four stars overall.<br /><br />As always, I ask my Mahlerian friends to keep me in their prayers to St Gustav. But to those who are antithetical to this composer: you are not alone.mer blows of fate or the &#34;microwaved marches&#34;.

0525478817|4.0|I have to admit, even though I'd heard this book was really good, the thought of a young adult novel about teenagers with cancer didn't hugely appeal to me.  My initial reactions were also somewhat less than stellar - everyone talks in a razor-sharp, ultra witty way that feels straight out of an Aaron Sorkin or Diablo Cody movie and not even remotely how any 16 or 17 year old I know speaks.  I feared that it was going to be all style without substance, bouncing along until a requisite tearjearking conclusion.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />This is a book peopled with a group of characters that you really care about.  At its core are the star-crossed lovers, Hazel (with terminal cancer) and Augustus (a cancer survivor).  They meet at a cancer support group and become close, despite Hazel's desire to avoid becoming a \\"grenade\\" in anybody's life - by which she means someone who will unwittingly cause significant hurt through their passing.  They are fantastically loveable characters, who flit between deep conversations about the meaning of life and finding refuge in video games and reality TV shows.  I loved them both.  Still do.<br /><br />But the book is more than that.  It's about coming to terms with the fact that your life will almost certainly never rise above insignificance - yes, you will matter to your family and friends, hey maybe even write a few reviews that people like on Amazon, but ultimately you probably won't make any life changing impact on the world.  It's about the way we shrink from people with terminal disease only to laud them when they pass.  It's about the impact that terminal diseases have on the families of those left behind.  It's about teenagers growing up and learning to take responsibility for their own lives, defining themselves by who they are not what disease they may have.<br /><br />I don't know if there's anything life changing here, but it's definitely a moving, entertaining and thought provoking book.  Pretty hard combination to pull off.  Kudos to John Green.to pull off.  Kudos to John Green.

B003IKMR0U|5.0|This game is extremely simple so it's easy to explain the rules to your friends, grandma, and 6-year-old cousin. Also its simplicity makes it pretty quick and fun rather long and boring.<br />The game is nice for some friendly competition over things you normally wouldn't get competitive about (brains), though the cover of the container (the creepy zombie and blood) really doesn't set the tone for the style of the game; it's not scary or gross, just a creative point-based game system.<br /><br />The dice are pretty good quality and appealing in appearance, but the container is just thick cardboard so try not to get it wet and don't leave it around where it might get smashed or chewed on by a dog/baby.<br />Its container actually, being compact as it is, makes it easy to carry the game around whenever you're going somewhere where you might need to kill time or just to a friend or family's house to play it with good company. It only takes perhaps 5-8 minutes to reach 13 brains with two players, 8-12 for 3, and up to 15 for 4 (that's just been my experience).<br />Zombie Dice is a great, inexpensive investment.
0374275637|4.0|With all of the cognitive illusions and biases of the fast and intuitive system 1, one begins to think humans are just a bunch of zombies limping around aimlessly in search of satisfying nothing but their reptilian urges.  Mr. Kahneman's aim is \\"improve the ability to identify and understand the errors of judgment and choice\\" (pg. 4), but unfortunately this newfound knowledge will ill equip you to avoid the pitfalls of these errors.  \\"Little can be achieved without a considerable investment of effort.\\"  After decades of research and ground breaking work, Mr. Kahneman, by his own admission is \\"just as prone to overconfidence,  extreme predictions, and the planning fallacy...\\" (pg. 417).<br /><br />Mr. Kahneman spends much of the book arguing against the Chicago approach, which assumes humans are rational agents or Econs as Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein coined the term in [[ASIN:014311526X Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness]].  Econs are capable of evaluating options and picking the most logically sound choice.  If they pick poorly, e.g. choose not to wear a helmet while riding a motorcycle, they do so with knowledge of the risks.  They should, therefore, be left to their own devices to choose, and government should not assert control.  Behavioral economists reject this form of extreme rational model.  Humans are sometimes subservient to the subconscious mind, and our conscious (system 2) process is too lazy and slow to keep system 1 in check more often than we are aware of.  A compromise in the two schools of thought is libertarian paternalism.  Rather than force people to behave a certain way, help them act in a way that advances their long term interests, and protect them from their cognitive weaknesses.<br /><br />The \\"Slow\\" in \\"Thinking Fast and Slow\\" is the dominant mode of thinking required to slog through the comprehensive and rich material presented in this book.

B004EPYZUS|4.0|I am a big fan of the old TV series.  Who can forget Mr. Phelps and the self destructing reel to reel tape machine?  The series was done was class and sophistication.  But, audiences these days don't pay the big bucks to see those sorts of movies these days.  Instead, movie budgets climb toward the clouds with techno gadgets and scenes with big bangs.  Was this movie a five?  Nope, but it does rate a strong 4.  I give it credit because Cruise shares the scenes and the action with other stars; a strong female lead is allowed to play an expansive part (and does it well); the field agent turned analyst is well played; and the plots moves along without becoming too bogged down.  Ok, a nuclear missile almost nukes San Francisco and apparently no-one in the world knows that but the IMF team, even though the warhead actually strikes a building and would have been picked up by many radars the world over.  But, let's forget these sorts of details, sit back and enjoy what you paid to see:  a spy story with folks getting their butts kicked and the world is saved once again.

The best thing other than DT was Liquid Tension Experiment, this pop rock stuff just HAS TO GO. LOVE TO MIKE!! Your the best, this stuff isn't sorry.

B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I can't say that I am a big fan of any one of the stars in this movie, that is, I didn't buy this movie because Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman, etc, were in it.  But their interaction in this flick is enjoyable and entertaining.  Yes, things get a bit far-fetched at times.  But, overall the movie held my interest and for the price was a bargain.  The person who stole the show  was John Malkovich (Marvin).  Watch the movie and you'll understand what Marvin means when he utters the phrase \\"I'm getting the pig.\\"

B003M5AXN4|4.0|As I wrote, there are two types of people who will like this movie: people who watched Speed Racer (and, I suppose, liked it) and those (like me) who are curious because they liked \\"The Matrix\\" or follow the Wachowskis.<br /><br />I think the Wachowskis (Andy and Lana both co-wrote and directed this) are a unique pair of film makers, and are in their own way like Quentin Tarantino and the Coen Brothers: people who make movies for themselves and so be it.  This list is not exclusive--it might include, say, Christopher and Jonathan Nolan--nor does it have to consist of brothers (Tarantino, for example), but I think it takes an unusual and insular \\"team\\" to resist the pressures of others successfully.<br /><br />To get to my point, I think those who gave this film a negative review tend to see a movie like this without understanding the talents and ambitions of the particular film maker(s).  I don't intend to denigrate those viewers, who may spend their money and think of others as they wish, but I do think that those who DO appreciate, say, the Wachowskis can disregared the reviews of those who don't \\"get\\" them.<br /><br />For my part, \\"Speed Racer\\" is quite a movie.  I wasn't a fan of the TV show, as I was too old and too interested in what I felt were \\"hipper\\" things,  But I caught an episode here and there, so I knew how difficult is would be to recreate the spirit of the show in \\"live\\" format.  But I think the Wachowskis, and the actors, did a great job.<br /><br />For those considering seeing this movie, please watch the show--even one or two episodes--to better follow this movie.  The plot is not the object of this movie--Speed Racer's love for racing is central here, as he and his family resist the lure of big corporations even though it means those bigwigs will be gunning for him throughout the movie.  What matters when you see this movie is appreciating how successfully these film makers accomplished their transformation.<br /><br />\\"Speed Racer\\" is an imaginative tour de force, with so much going on in any one shot that it is almost too much to take in.  The crazy race tracks, the wild animations of light streaks and starbursts, the dizzying sense of motion, the evil and ever-constant machinations of Speed's fellow racers, the rainbow of colors of race cars (against Speed's dazzling white vehicle)--it's all in tandem, and I wouldn't recommend seeing it if you're prone to headaches.<br /><br />The acting is what you'd expect, but it's better than a lot of knock off films like \\"The Flinstones\\" or \\"The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle,\\" (though John Goodman is in all those, too).  Emile Hirsch, a young actor I tend to like a lot, is fine as Speed, and the rest of the cast is fine, too: Goodman, Susan Sarandon, Christina Ricci and Matthew Fox as Racer X.  You don't expect Oscar performances here, but they did their jobs credibly and were assets to the film.<br /><br />All in all, see \\"Speed Racer\\" if you were a fan of the show.  If not, I'm not sure you're going to like this very busy and, yes, ambitious movie.  But if you were a fan I think you will see how terrific the Wachowskis are as movie crafters--how technically perfect this movie is.  It's a shame it did not do better at the box office: its $90 milllion worldwide take did not match its $120 million budget.  Too bad--I hope they succeed at their next one (see below), because I want this creative team to keep making films that suit them.<br /><br />A note: the Wachowskis' next movie will adapt David Mitchell's \\"Cloud Atlas.\\" a very ambitious and imaginative novel itself, and will star Tom Hanks, Hugo Weaving, Hugh Grant, Halle Berry, Susan Sarandon and other greats.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|We're always taught that history is determined by the winners. We usually don't bother to find out what happened to the losing side, even though their story may be the more interesting one.  Firefly distinguishes itself from other TV shows by following Captain Malcolm Reynolds, a former soldier who fought on the losing side of a civil war.<br /><br />Earth's resources have been used up, and humans have colonized another galaxy.  A civil war was fought over whether the galaxy should be unified under one government, or if each planet should be independent.  The \\"Independents\\", including Malcolm Reynolds, lost this war, and now have to find a place for themselves in a universe that does not want them there.<br /><br />Firefly strikes the perfect balance between sci-fi and western; it has the exciting technology of a sci-fi classic, yet has the down-to-earth feel of a western, helping viewers to better connect with the characters.  While most sci-fi shows are about the action and the technology, Firefly circles around character development, following the outcasts of society: war veterans, fugitives, a preacher in a place where religion is not popular, etc.  While only 14 episodes, each character in Firefly will find a place in your heart, leading to you craving more.<br /><br />Although Firefly won't give you something to watch for an entire summer, it will give you a show you can watch in one weekend with a group of friends.  It's the type of show you can watch over and over again, and there are always connections to be made that you missed the first time.

B005CM9DX6|2.0|Opeth would leave us in our darkest hour, yet trust us with its life.<br /><br />I am just going to get that out of the way right now: this album is sub-par material for Opeth, and it has nothing to do with the style. I am not stuck inside Opeth's realm of progressive death metal. Damnation is my favorite Opeth album. This album is sub-par because the songwriting is sub-par.<br /><br />The album starts with the beautiful, folk sounding title track. If the entire album continued the trend started in this song, it would be a good album - great, even. Unfortunately for us, it doesn't...<br />\\"Heritage\\" continues into the only real progressive metal song here: \\"The Devil's Orchard.\\" By first listen, one can already tell this isn't up to par with previous Opeth songs. I will say it's a good song with some awesome riffs, but the overall delivery leaves a bit to be desired. It also shows signs of one of the album's biggest flaws: poor transitions. Opeth music, in the past, has usually had great transitions within each song. They flowed together seamlessly. The transitions in Heritage flow together horribly, ultimately leaving a bad impression. It's as if each part should've been a new song, but that would've left too many tracks (and ten tracks can already be considered too many for an Opeth album), so several were thrown into one song instead.<br /><br />It's not just transition problems that bring this album down, though. The album is completely cluttered with outright boring interludes that bridge together parts of each song (\\"Häxprocess\\" and \\"Famine\\" are full of these interludes). Where there isn't mind-numbing interludes (sleep music, maybe?) bridging different parts in the same song, there is often times bad songwriting (\\"The Lines in My Hand\\"). The riffs and melodies commonly sound like leftovers from Damnation that Mikael didn't get a chance to use, but he didn't want to let them go to waste.<br /><br />\\"I Feel the Dark\\" is one of the album's biggest offenders here. The track meanders off too much with multiple uninteresting ideas, showcased in the use of several unmemorable sections bridged together with unmemorable interludes. \\"Famine\\" is perhaps the worst song on the album, because it's eight minutes of boring ideas all thrown into one cluster of failure. When it's not being boring, it's being outright odd with wild flutes passages and what sounds to me like bongo beats (yes, ****ing bongos).<br /><br />Of course, not everything here is bad. \\"Nepenthe\\" is a very beautiful track - it's as mellow as the album gets, but the songwriting isn't completely terrible, unmemorable, or whatever you want to call it. Aside from a bit of guitar wankery for a small part of the song about half way through, it's completely relaxing, and very emotional. \\"Slither\\" as well uses fun riffs throughout the first 3/4 of the song, before it breaks off (poorly) into another slow section that continues until the track's end. The title track and the closing track \\"Marrow of the Earth\\" are fascinating, beautiful instrumentals. They're the kind of tracks I'd want to relax to on a cold, wintery day with a hot cup of tea.<br /><br />Likewise, throughout the \\"bad\\" tracks there are \\"good\\" parts. \\"The Lines in My Hand\\" is poor, boring material that picks up for the last ~50 seconds with some catchy vocal lines (and Opeth isn't exactly known for being \\"catchy\\"). The vocal lines of \\"Häxprocess\\" are great, but the instrumentation for the majority of the song is still uninteresting, largely because it carries on for way too long. If about half of the song was cut, it may be a highlight of the album.<br /><br />\\"Folklore\\" is an absolute mixed bag. While the first four minutes or so of the song has the same problems as the rest of the album, the last four minutes picks up with an instrumental bridge that's actually interesting, and sets a beautiful atmosphere for the rest of the song. I can't really put words to it, but the song finishes up brilliantly. The guitar finally kicks in and delivers an absolutely amazing hook that opens up Mikael singing a well crafted vocal passage, and finally ending with the best guitar riff in the entire album. Honestly, the last two and a half minutes of \\"Folklore\\" make listening to the rest of the album actually worth it. Like \\"Häxprocess,\\" if half of this song was cut, it'd be an absolutely excellent and memorable song that would make the most stubborn haters sigh in content. I've replayed the last two and a half minutes of this song more times than I can count.<br /><br />While the album suffers from several flaws, none of them prove to be more of a blockade to the listener's enjoyment than the sheer uninteresting songwriting. Most of it is so uninteresting, I had to actually listen to the entire album from beginning to end as I was writing this review, because I couldn't even remember most of it (despite having heard it a dozen times or more already). The album suffers mostly from disjointed transitions and simply boring instrumental sections. Almost every song on the album overstays its welcome, or delivers too many boring sections. Out of the ten tracks on the album, there are three good tracks, three good tracks with bad parts, and four bad tracks with good parts. This does not make for a particularly enjoyable listen, and it definitely falls far short of what I expect from Opeth. Mikael's vocals are definitely great when he has good lines to sing, but sadly Heritage does not offer nearly as much of those good lines as it should. The lyrics here are mostly hit (\\"Nepenthe\\") and miss (most of \\"Folklore\\"). This is perhaps an even greater shame, as Opeth has had some truly remarkable lyrics in the past.<br /><br />In the end, I'd recommend this album to a die-hard '70s progressive rock fan, because he'd probably love it. I'd also recommend any Opeth fan to check this out at least once, even if only to see how different it is. Anyone else should most likely stay away from this album. Ifyou're looking for an Opeth album to start with, then look at Damnation.

B007RXC3A8|4.0|Power metal is not exactly the most appreciated subgenre in metal. Actually, it seems quite the opposite. Few, if any, bands ever receive the kind of near-universal acceptance that bands such as Opeth, Primordial, Moonsorrow, and Sigh receive (even if some do not deserve it). Power metal, more often than not, is received as a \\"guilty pleasure,\\" it seems. Then comes Sonata Arctica and... well, gives complete justification to that response. Truly, they've always had a poppy, fluffy feel to them from which even a lot of standard power metal fans turn away. Yet, even so, their sound just has a certain magic that makes many like me fall in love with it. This is mostly led by Tony Kakko's excellent vocals; indeed, he's among the best vocalists in power metal (which is saying a lot, since power metal's trademark is excellent vocals).<br /><br />However, when Unia came, it seems everybody and their cats decided to turn in complete revolt. I'm still trying to figure out why, considering it incorporated a lot of progressive tendencies, and that's something almost everyone approves of. It is for that reason I am pointing this out: if you didn't like Unia, you will not like Stones Grow Her Name. Almost everything about it reminds of Unia. There is but one key difference... this album eschews much of the progressive tendencies established in Unia and perfectly evolved in The Days of Grays (which is their magnum opus, in my opinion), and instead opts for a sound even more poppy yet. One look at the tracklist, seeing titles such as \\"Shitload of Money\\" and \\"Don't Be Mean,\\" and you'll see that they are influenced by a more mainstream culture. I'd like to say this right now: I really have no clue what drug Tony was on when he decided this was a good idea, but I want him in ****ing rehab before it's time to start writing the eight album.<br /><br />That said, the sound is so similar to Unia that this seems far more like a natural progression from it than The Days of Grays does. I'll even go out on a limb here and say that none of the songs are bad. This album actually is more cohesive with a much better flow than Unia had, though there are no real standout tracks like the first four of Unia were for me.<br /><br />Of course, the Sonata Arctica traits are still here, with ballads (namely \\"Don't Be Mean\\"), fluffy anthems (\\"Only the Broken Hearts (Make You Beautiful)\\" and \\"I Have a Right\\"), and groovier, heavier tracks (\\"Losing My Insanity\\" being the best). They even threw me for a loop with Cinderblox, where there's a constant rhythm played on a banjo (yes, a banjo), and Tony occasionally puts a country accent to use. It's almost like he was sitting around thinking of a transitional song that will attract country music fans, then came up with this. Yet, despite every part of me wanting to hate it, everything about it works... and it may even be a highlight of the album. The progressive tendencies of the past two albums have not been completely abandoned, as well, with the biggest example also being the biggest highlight of the album: the two Wildfire tracks. Complete with non-linear songwriting and unexpected rhythm changes, these two easily could've been (and probably should've been) on Unia.<br /><br />I don't know if I've made it clear yet, but this album is in the same damn style as Unia. I have seen this album described as Unia + Reckoning Night; I can kind of see that, in that the majority songs sound like Unia, but feature dumbed down progressive qualities that are only semi-used like Reckoning Night. This results in lesser quality material for Sonata Arctica. While I still consider this a good album with some great moments (I do really like the Wildfire tracks), it is one that needs a lot of growing space to even be acceptable. My initial reaction to this was, \\"What the actual **** am I listening to?\\"<br /><br />Yeah, I really wish they would've evolved off the symphonic and, most importantly, sophisticated sound of The Days of Grays instead.<br /><br />While I give this 4 stars, it's more deserving of 3.5.

B005L3HKTU|4.0|Insomnium is pretty much \\"the\\" melodic death metal band these days, and for good reason. Ever since their 2002 debut, they've been churning out record after record of prime material. For those not in the know (which you should be, because these guys are like one of the most popular melodeath bands now, aren't they?), Insomnium is known for their brand of melancholic, mournful melodic death metal which they've been doing since 2004's Since the Day It All Came Down - their debut, In the Halls of Awaiting, was more in the style of old In Flames + Amorphis than what they're doing now. Something about the way they form their riffs produce a certain sorrowful quality that I've seen labeled as the \\"crying guitar\\" - and really, it's a fitting label. Few bands really evoke emotion with me the way they intend to, but Insomnium is definitely one of them. Tracks from their prior albums such as \\"Weighed Down with Sorrow\\" rank as some of the most emotively somber music I've ever heard. This newest album of theirs, One for Sorrow, is effectively the same thing.<br /><br />While these guys really do not have a mediocre record at all, I believe that their 2006 album Above the Weeping World, which happens to be one of my favorite albums from the 2000s, is the epitome of their sound hitherto this point. While all of their albums since Since the Day It All Came Down are really doing the same thing, Above the Weeping World did it the best. The mournful melodies climaxed perfectly in this album and created some of the most fantastic melodeath of the last decade. Since then, their albums have been going in a downward slope, however. Across the Dark was worse than it's predecessor, and so is One for Sorrow worse than its predecessor.<br /><br />This is not inherently the problem with this album though. This album offers solid tracks all throughout. From the opening acoustic \\"Inertia\\" to the heartbreaking finally title track, the album never loses its appeal. There are obvious high points -\\"One for Sorrow\\" is full of sorrowful melody that makes my heart weep, and \\"Lay the Ghost to Rest\\" has great progression, beautifully somber riffing, and a bone-chilling climax. Likewise, there are obvious lowpoints - opener \\"Inertia\\" is a far cry from the memorable beauties that opened their previous three albums (and some of the best introduction songs ever), and \\"Regain the Fire\\" just sounds to me like what an Insomnium cover band would be doing... You know, the Insomnium sound, but generically. Everything here though is good. I think one big problem that arose here with me though is that while everything is good, it's the same stuff they've been doing for four records now, and of slightly worse quality at that.<br /><br />But, again, this is not the problem with the record. The problem with the record is that... it's the same stuff they've been doing for four records now. At what point does their sound become tiring and droll? At what point do they fade into obscurity of the bands that have essentially re-released the same record half a dozen times? Insomnium's sound is fantastic, but it's not changing much between records. They've spiced this album up a bit by including more use of clean vocals, but that created another problem with me: the clean vocals (which do sound quite nice) often times make the songs they appear in sound happy... and that is not an adjective one should want to see describing an Insomnium song. But I digress; despite the clean vocals (which are still used sparingly, by the way), the instruments - which are still top notch - are doing the same thing they've been doing for four albums now. As long as they keep doing their sound well, really, I can't complain. There's going to come a point though where it sounds like they're recycling all of their old material, and I can already hear that just slightly here.<br /><br />Make no mistakes though - I'm giving this record four stars justifiably. It's still good, quality music, and when looking back on what was released in 2011, it's definitely an honorable mention. I'm just worried they're going to lose their appeal if they don't mix things up a bit more. Maybe add a bit more of that faster and ultimately less melancholic stuff that showed up in In the Halls of Awaiting.

B005IZLPKQ|4.0|Captain America stands as one of the most recognizable super heroes to come out of the golden age of comics. His red, white, and blue outfit has stood the test of decades, and his origin story is perhaps the most American of all superheroes ever conceived. Cap is also one if the primary members of the Avengers, which is the current destination of the Marvel movies, so it should surprise no one that the Captain America movie has a lot riding on its shoulders.<br /><br />So, how has the Super Soldier withstood the translation to the silver screen?<br /><br />In a word, well. Captain America: The First Avenger stays true not only to the origin of the character, but it also preserves the very distinct retro-futurist aesthetics and tongue-in-cheek humor of the golden age comics with remarkable accuracy. The use of Cap as a USO propaganda piece perfectly lampoons the whole star-spangled get-up and lets us get the Hitler-punching action long-time Cap readers were hoping for, and, for the attentive viewer, there are references to all levels of the Marvel universe throughout.<br /><br />Howard Stark, who plays a surprisingly large role in the movie, is the driving forced behind Cap's development into a proper superhero. He provides Rogers with the iconic round shield as well as the newly-designed suit. I'm not sure how I feel about the suit itself, but I like the helmet. It looks more high-tech than the classic dragon-scale armor that Captain America has worn for the last few decades, and a little less form fitting. It's angular, stiff, perhaps, and the colors are subdued, but it is unashamedly and undoubtedly Captain America. I think I like it, but from what's been shown of up-coming Avengers movie, the suit has actually changed substantially, so don't get used to it.<br /><br />I've noticed that there is a certain big-screen quality to the movie that is somewhat lost on my home TV. Steve Roger's wild sprint through 1940's Brooklyn as he chases a Nazi infiltrator, for example, seems much less thrilling than it did when I saw a super-sized Rogers charging down the street at the theater. This is also true of the USO propaganda pieces that have Cap dancing on stage, posing for baby photos, and reciting lines taped to the back of his original shield. On a smaller screen, the larger-than-life presentation is woefully reduced.<br /><br />Cap's origin is handled pretty well, though it does take up a good third of the movie. Within the Marvel Universe, there is often a certain blending of magic and science that makes the characters work. For example, the super soldier serum, in conjunction with the `vita-rays' \\"Amplifies what's inside,\\" meaning that the patriotic, humble Steve Rogers becomes Captain America, while the self-obsessed, power hungry Johann Schmidt becomes the Red Skull. Likewise, the Cosmic Cube, which serves as the catalyst of the story, has ties to Norse mythology, and thus to the character of Thor, who was also the star of a Marvel movie released earlier this year (to somewhat less critical and commercial success). These ties will hopefully lead to something more interesting in the Avengers movie, but we'll have to wait until next year to find out.<br /><br />I'm happy to report that the handling of the magic-science that drives the movie is tastefully done. It could easily have been awkward or confusing (as was the case in Thor), but the writers and actors present it as it is, and don't try to ham it up. When it doesn't make sense, the writers move on (as is the case with the \\"vibranium-alloy\\" shield), and that helps a lot in maintaining verisimilitude. The writers of Iron Man 2 might have learned something from The First Avenger's handling of silly pseudo-science.<br /><br />Speaking of the actors, those who rolled their eyes when Chris Evans (who was also the Human Torch in the ill-fated Fantastic Four movies) was selected to play the role. Despite his critics, Evans steals the show. Even as the skinny, gawky CG Steve Rogers, Evans is believable, and his enthusiasm for \\"doing his part\\" by joining the military is believable and inspiring. As the filled-out Super Soldier, he is funny, charming, and even romantic, but never over-the top. With a character that wears a flag to work, it might have been easy to fall into the camp, but Evans avoids both the too-dark tone of many of the recent superhero flicks and the campy, ho-hum of the old-school superhero movies. It has more in common with the first Spider Man movie than it does with most of the others released in the last year or two.<br /><br />The Red Skull, played by Hugo Weaving, does not translate so well to the silver screen, if only because he gets so little screen time. When he is allowed to show his face, it seems he can only threaten or bark evil things; we never really get a grasp for how evil he really is, and because of some story compression towards the end of the second act, first-time viewers may not even understand the Red Skull's actual mission with Hydra (who are, I'm sad to report, definitely over the top). The compression also turns what would have been really fun middle act starring Cap and the Howling Commandos is turned into what is essentially a montage... That was pretty disappointing.<br /><br />Despite my complaints, Weaving's casting as the Skull isn't bad at all. Indeed, he is quite creepy and intense, and his drawling German accent is enough to send chills up my spine, but the role was limited, perhaps out of necessity, because, well, this is a prequel.<br /><br />That, perhaps more than anything, is what holds this movie back from being really breath-taking. Despite awesome sets, incredible costume design, and all-around solid writing and acting, we can't help but invest ourselves in The First Avenger as anything more than a prelude. Everything feels like, and is, a set-up, from Cap's arctic plunge, the Cosmic Cube, Howard Stark, and even the super soldier serum itself.<br /><br />I'm hoping with my fingers crossed that it will be a hell of a payoff. Certain characters are left with uncertain fates, and that, I'm hoping, will make for some very interesting movies in the next few years. For now I'm happy with Captain America, even after a third viewing. It is a good solid superhero movie that bucks the modern-day trend of broody superfolks, and tells a well-rounded, brilliantly-acted story that has gunfights, Nazis, romance, car chases, and a surprisingly good sense of humor.<br /><br />Here's hoping The Avengers can follow Cap's charge.s, Evans is believable, and his enthusiasm for \\"doing his part\\" by joining the military is believable and inspiring.

0345535421|4.0|Despite a friend's pushing for years, I was turned onto A Song of Ice and Fire by IGN's incessantly excellent reviews of the HBO series. I procured a few episodes, and fell in love immediately. As soon as the TV series was done, I read A Game of Thrones, and couldn't help but chew into the second book right away.<br /><br />At its most basic, I think A Song of Ice and Fire as a series is about disappointment. I don't mean that in a bad way; I mean it very literally. Every character, even the most cynical, must come to grips with the disappointing reality they live in. From Tyrion Lannister, the Imp, to Sansa Stark, each character's trial is at its heard a massive, hopeless disappointment. Disenchantment with reality. That's what makes the first two books so damn interesting, too; every living human being, however wealthy, illustrious, or insignificant, is ultimately forced to deal with the same thing: the inevitable disappointment in the reality they find themselves in. If Tolkien could be characterized as having written about discovery, growth, and redemption, I think Martin could be characterized as writing about entropy, mourning, and reality.<br /><br />A Game of Thrones is nothing if not a brash, gutsy novel. Martin's first volume in the series dared characters to fall in love with characters like the icy-hearted Ned Stark, a stalwart sentry of honor, and the barbaric Kahl Drogo, and then took those characters to places where the reader would never have anticipated. He did it subtly, with the fine strokes of someone navigating a political sea, which is exactly what most of the characters must do in the first book.<br /><br />In the second book, that sea has become a maelstrom. There are four kings of Westeros now; Joffery the incestuous son of Queen Cersei, Stannis, the next-eldest in the line of the royal Baratheon line, and Renly, the beloved youngest of the Baratheon boys. And then there is Robb Stark, the King in the North, a young man of only 15 who was raised to his position not out of lust for power, but by the very men who served him. With so many people vying for regency, it's not a surprise that there are parts of this novel that are a mess of motivation, and that the lines between camps are indecisive at best.<br /><br />But for me, that mess is a part of the fun. Sifting through the dialogue and trying to read between the lines is a joy, not a chore, for the most part. That said, those characters which have a clear alliance are a mercy, because there are precious few of them. Characters like Roose Bolton, Littlefinger, Varys, and even Tyrion himself are nigh-impossible to predict, let alone understand, and their inconsistent loyalties may grow frustrating in the last act of the book.<br />Martin smartly keeps the reader outside of the four kings' heads, preventing them from feeling any particular loyalty (though it might be said that the events of the former book move the scale away from Joffery and in particular toward Robb) as to who should be a rightful king and who shouldn't. Thus it is left up the reader to draw their own allegiance, which is a very intelligent move on Martin's behalf. I don't know if it works so well in the long-play he has running (I'm two books into five so far, of seven), but I'll definitely comment on that when I review the next one.<br /><br />As to the question of who should be king? It's anyone's guess. I felt like the complex machinations of politicking within the novel actually got in the way, and I felt (though I know a few who disagree) that Martin wrote himself into a couple of corners. There are a few pitched points in the novel where it seemed that a \\"deus ex machina\\" is pulled out of thin air in order to forward the novel or create a situation that, moments before, was very implausible. Whether or not my feelings are valid, that's up to other readers to decide.<br /><br />Another consideration I must make in judging A Clash of Kings is the cliff-hanger endings. In Thrones,these were used smartly, and sparingly; there were many a chapter-end that had a resolution, or something like it. In Clash, there are many more cliff-hangers, especially among the more central characters. This can be frustrating for readers as they're forced to wait to see where a particular fevered thread is going, and when, on occasion, the hanger is revealed to be nothing more than a cheap shot, I invite the reader to kindly close the book, punt it out the window, and wait until their blood pressure lowers before continuing. Which you'll definitely want to do.<br /><br />Martin has become famous for the number of focal characters he retains. I believe Clash of Kings is told from 9 different viewpoints, which lends itself to very complex narrative, to say the least, and a thick volume. Of these characters, Martin favors some more than others in the book, but I suppose that is inevitable.<br /><br />I find Jon Snow particular interesting; there is something about the chaste knight storyline interests me, and I was sad to see that he isn't as robust a character this time around. Neither is Sansa Stark, or Catelyn, whose presence to me felt rather arbitrary. She basically exists to ride around and witness acts of atrocity and sadness, while lamenting about Ned and the others she's lost or losing. I feel sorry for her (and for Sansa), but they're not doing anything interesting enough to read about, mostly. However, I'm not so naïve as to believe that Martin is developing them for no reason. I'm sure he has a planned outcome, and I'm looking forward to seeing what it is.<br /><br />Still, it was a shame to see them languish, along with the very interesting Ser Davos the Onion Knight, while Tyrion was given, in my opinion, too much attention. I wonder how much of that was due to fan demand; Tyrion is a great, compelling character, but he is one that does better under the allure of mystique rather than constant scrutiny.<br /><br />Other characters have just the right amount of attention, though. Arya, for example, briefly Arry, then Weasel, then Nan through the course of the book, is given enough screen time to be compelling without drawing out to a bore. Her arc in the novel is rich and unexpected, and so is Theon Greyjoy's--who is now a focal character, and a damned interesting one at that.<br /><br />What struck me at about the 50% mark in the book is that every single character in A Song of Ice and Fire is interesting enough to have their own novel(s) within the milieu. Really, they are. Even Catelyn Stark, who I feel is a bit floppy this time, is still interesting enough within her own context that I find her a compelling character. If Jon Snow were to have his own novel, or Bran, why, I think they'd shine just as bright as they do in union.<br /><br />Speaking of milieu, a \\"mileu\\" is the world-within-a-story. You might consider it a franchise, although you'd be partly wrong. A milieu is everything contained within and without the context of a story; for example, Tolkien's \\"back-story\\" or \\"back-fiction\\" contained in the Silmarillion is as much a part of the milieu as the events in The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />Milieus are crucial for studying a series of books, but are always important, because they contain the histories and personalities that influence and motivate the characters you experience through the vehicle of the story, game, or film (or what have you). I think that Martin has made some excellent, intelligent choices regarding his milieu, and watching the world of Westeros and the Free Cities expand and become more fleshed out was one of the joys of the book.<br /><br />Orson Scott Card wrote in his book How to Write Science-fiction and Fantasy that he is a \\"map-drawer.\\" He likes to envision cities and towns and worlds, and build stories for them. If you're someone who likes that kind of thing, even if just the exploration part, then you must read Clash of Kings. Martin details whole new societies, governments, histories and even the effectiveness of magic.<br /><br />Oh yes, magic.<br /><br />Where A Game of Thrones was a relatively magic-less affair (with some characters even mocking magic), Martin brings the fantastic flare back in a very good way in Clash. That's something you need to know up-front, I suppose; some people are put off by magic, and others drawn in. If you're put off by it, I encourage you to check out how Martin is using his system. It reminds me of a much more subdued, and thankfully equally mysterious force as to that of Tolkien's. There are, as far as I can tell, no magic words or phrases, or gestures. In fact, the entire vehicle seems only to be explainable by, well..., that's a major plot point. So read the book.<br /><br />My Verdict?  Yes, it's a volume on par of scale with an encyclopedia, and yes, it does drag at times, but the battles are very cool and set up believably, and the characters are just as compelling and addicting as they were the first time around. Martin experimented with pulling heartstrings in A Game of Thrones, but he's mastered it this time around.<br /><br />If you're a fantasy fan, you've got no choice but to read A Clash of Kings. It reads almost like historical fiction, so real are the characters, settings, and descriptions. If you're new to the genre, go grab A Game of Thrones.

Oliver Nelson was another. Miles, of course. And Art Blakey. Blakey's group had a groove that was rock steady, yet swung like no one else. His Blues March moved from a tight military two-step into a cool swing, never losing that metronome like beat. And Moanin' is a call-and-response tune that sounds as fresh and hip today as it did in the 50s. Six stars, easy.

I put the blame squarely on Phyllida Lloyd - Director, Abi Morgan - Writer (screenplay), Damian Jones - Producer, Elliot Davis - Cinematographer, Thomas Newman - Composer, Simon Elliott - Production Designer, and Justine Wright - Editor.<br /><br />To keep you from having to guess what I'm talking about and actually watch snippets of this movie I'll tell you. As filler it shows a ditzy old Margret played by Meryl Streep who flashes back in time to have the real story \\"snippets of her life\\" displayed played by Alexandra Roach. Alexander does all the real parts in Meryl Streep gets the \\"Saturday Night Live parts.\\"
B001N8Q6V0|5.0|For some reason I cannot quite put a finger on, this movie is a must-see, and a valuable addition to \\"movies of depth and character\\" that should be on your list.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood, far from his very apparent physical limitations, yet just as strong as his spirited good will, as seen by his role in \\"Gran Torino\\", manages to grip us to his side and pray for a good outcome, in FireFox.<br /><br />The movie seems slow-going, yet...it has that magic that will make you watch it at LEAST 10 times, if not more...simply because the climax and \\"d&eacute;nouement\\" make it SO WORTH the while.<br /><br />You have to watch it through one time before you are hopelessly and helplessly hooked to watching it again, and again...and again.

1439153663|5.0|I read this book in a little over a day!  I could not put it down.  It has a great story filled with great characters, an interesting story, and so emotional I had to find out what happened around every turn.  Great pick for a book club.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I absolutely loved this series.  I just started reading while my baby was in the hospital, it helped pass the time.  Never did I think I would continue reading and love it this much after everything was fine.  This book was exciting, fun, hot and unable to put down.  Nothing but good things to say about these books!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This was a very interesting book, written from the viewpoint of a bright 5 year old, it causes an adult to think about many things.
B0077ATSZE|4.0|The film itself is not really a master piece nor is it boring. But it does seem to bring out that in the viewer. So there must be some underlying truth that it brings out for those with the propensity to see.<br /><br />The story is simple but the telling is complex and many of the people are intricate. I need to break here to say that I thought that Max von Sydow as &#34;The Renter&#34; added a great deal to the ambiance of the mystery. The story is of young Oskar Schell whom loses his father to the 9.11 events. His father always set Oskar off on missions to find things about life and history. So when Oskar finds a hidden key he assumes that it will tell him something about his father. So he embanks on a mission to find the lock that fits the key. His only clue is the word black written on the key's envelope. Following this clue Oscar begins to explore and grow. We explore and grow with him.<br /><br />If you like films about kids finding mysterious keys form dispatched father's then do not over look a similar film &#34;Hugo&#34; also derived from a book and not as well told as the book.
B005DNO7MQ|5.0|Ever since Steven Speilburg (sp?), it has been rare to find a movie that achieves what \\"Hollywood\\" stood for back in Charlie Chaplin's day, then Jimmy Stewart, Bogie and Becall, etc.<br /><br />Gladiator isn't a gently-tugging-at-your-soul's attention kind of movie.  It GRABS you from the very first, less than 5 minutes into the opening, and doesn't end until the movie is over.  Even then, I recall wandering out of the theatre, almost in a \\"fugue\\" state of mind.  THAT'S how powerful was the movie's moral is, not to mention plot, character development, protagonist vs antagonist, all the way from the gripping start to the ending.  Evil vs. Honor, the \\"parable\\" of the consequences of choosing to live the thrill of EXHILERATION, acheived ONLY via the absorbtion of selfish greed and power, compared to the everlasting courage of a principlied, moral, ethical, self-effacing life.<br /><br />Actually, Ridley Scott DID do another classic - Alien (the original.)  But with Gladiator, Russell Crowe, and Joaquin Phoenix could not have been better chosen for the roles played.<br /><br />This was a movie on a scale beyondf epic...hence, no chance of a sequel.  You cannot exceed 1000% in movie calibre.
6304779259|5.0|First off this is a great film. If you're getting it for the movie get the regular edition, it's cheaper anyway. If you're getting it JUST to see the alternate ending I'd say either wait for the Blu-ray later this year, which will contain the ending in color with all the missing effects, or find it on youtube. I can honestly only recommend this to collectors/movie buffs.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this game is very awesome I enjoy this game a lot thank you for sharing this fun game with me I hope there are more like this one.

B005HSL626|5.0|This game gets the adrenaline going, trying to slice and dice all the fast-falling fruit. Great activity.<br />Well-graphiced. Easy to get started
B007C4ZJ3K|3.0|At least that's what supposed to be. Of course after seeing dozens of these formula movies you can be pretty sure that you know who the bad guys are and even why. But go ahead and admit it that's not really why you buy these movies you like killer action in killer women in killer just about everything else. You know the smug person is going to be besmirched were dissensmugged. While you should enjoy this run-of-the-mill movie go for it.<br /><br />Independent operator and ex-Marine Mallory Kane played by Gina Carano has been double-crossed him set up. But who could've done it? A friend? Her employer? His employer? Or some other obscure character in the story?<br /><br />Time is running out all the authorities are after her and she must still be the goat on the stick until they find out who the bad guys are. Of course she's really the lion and no one's going to put her on a stick.<br /><br />I suggest that if you really do like these chemistries that you do not miss this vintage version titled \\"Three Days of the Condor\\" with Robert Redford.<br /><br />If you get the Blu-ray DVD and watch the extras there is a training film that says that they built the movie around Gina Carano after finding her in the MMA.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I find that this book was just as exciting as the first, you don't want to put it down.  It was fantastic writing and the author knew how to spin a tale.  It made me jumpy wanting to know what was next and with reading it that fast I want to read<br />it again because it was over to soon.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|There is something soothing in just moving a droplet around the puzzle.  The puzzles are engaging and sometimes frustrating,  but a small sense of accomplishment is gained when you can do the puzzle perfectly.  I try to reach perfection every time I play.
B00000BKI4|3.0|I tried. All the great reviews, and comparisons to other bands that I really liked ... and yet this album did nothing for me. Quite listenable, but ultimately nothing struck me or particularly impressed me. Music as an opiate? Not sure what these guys intended to do on this album, or what is supposed to be \\"genius\\" about this music, but it escapes me entirely. Maybe I should try it again. It's been nearly a full decade since I listened to this one. But I tried that \\"listen again with an open mind\\" tactic with Jeff Buckley too, and wasn't any more impressed with it the second time around, so I'm not sure if Mercury Rev CD will ultimately click with me or not. Meanwhile, I'll stick with my Neil Young albums.
B00785P2QC|3.0|i like this game alot but its hard to get i think they are contracts but other than that you don't get a lot of land to start off with
B006X415GK|4.0|Bought this doll for my BBF's daughter. She loved it. Its one of her favorites. The price is pretty cool also.
0345803485|1.0|This book is totally junk. Someone told me it has gone viral and thinking that is would be a good read, I bought it. What a waste of money. The author can't write, has no imagination, and plus, it's porn. Not soft porn either. I love to read. For me it's as important as breathing, but certainly not this book.<br />Jonnie Johnson
0385534639|4.0|While I was entertained visiting Erin Morgenstern's world in The Night Circus, the story never quite wrestled my imagination. It felt like the plot and tone were shadows of other popular books. (I was too often reminded of Harry Potter, Twilight and Water for Elephants.) Every now and then launching a new idea on the heels of other successes can work (here I'm thinking of the TV show Lost, which was developed from the then-recent popularity of Survivor and Cast Away), but much more frequently it falls flat and is forgotten.<br /><br />Morgenstern is an excellent writer and her debut novel hardly falls flat, but I do fear it will be forgotten. I look forward to her next work and I hope she's earned the freedom to pen something more risky and original.
B004LWZW8S|2.0|Half the movies scenes are on the same small sets which are suppose to be beautiful because they are on a cliff side? This movie took a wrong turn from the moment the narrator begins speaking. The storyline is unclear about what the Titans were doing in this. Its always about the Titans being the secret to everything, but these Titans were just something new and stupid. There isn't much character development and even fight scenes were pathetic. At one point the soldiers are smiling when Thesis is giving a horrible, typical speech about going to face the stronger enemy. This was as bad as bolly-woods attempts on war movies. I don't expect much from this director or producers next time.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|So I'm a smart kid and the one thing that drives me insane is brain inactivity. I can NOT stand boredom. So mind games like this are perfect for me. These puzzles get harder anytime I get too comfortable and as an artistic person I L-O-V-E having a picture as the product of my work. This is a great app that I can play for days on end. On top of that, the app was free! Can it get any better?
B006M7JCC2|5.0|this is an amazing book, loved it and will recommend it happily...thank you for writing this wonderful book...I read you on facebook also...
0345803493|4.0|Finally a story line with something more than just sex!!! Don't get me wrong there is still LOTS of sex but the storyline develops more too.  Definitely a fun summer read if you ask me!
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I wasn't aware of the fanfare surrounding this dreadful tome. My cousin told my aunt that she was reading a naughty book that she couldn't put down. My aunt told my mom; being a connoisseur of erotic fiction, I downloaded the book immediately upon returning home. I gave Ms. James the benefit of the first chapter stutter stop, which I snatched away in Chapter 2 and by Chapter 5 I was hate-reading - that thing avid readers do when they've stumble upon a book that's so poorly written that you continue to read for the joy of making fun of it. I stopped making fun of it by the end of the first \\"book\\" and started being truly angry. Angry that money stepped in where editors feared to tread. Because, my friends, this \\"book\\" is all about money. It's all about the bottom line.<br /><br />First, the book is written in first person which is difficult for the most talented writers among us; for bad writers it's napalm. First person erotic fiction = one-sided sex. I get a sense that Ms. James understands that first person isn't her strong suit, but instead of starting over; instead of researching; instead of reading other books in first person; she chooses to flesh out Christian through (gasp) e-mails; (triple-gasp) the contract, which we are forced to read twice; and through the conversations Ana has with Christian's family.<br /><br />Usually when reading bad erotic fiction, I flip past the prose to the sex. With these books I flipped past the sex to the prose (and past most of the prose - certainly past the e-mails and contracts). The sex is exactly the same all the way through, it's just in different (and usual) places. It's was boring to begin with and got completely nauseating as I trudged through.<br /><br />After hate-reading the entire trilogy, this is what I suspect. I suspect that there is no E.L. James. I suspect that the book was written by a computer program. I suspect that the publisher needed money and understanding that sex sells, they slapped this together, seeded some good reviews and we all followed suit. Remember, a book gets to the Best Seller's List because of how many it sells, not whether or not the book has literary merit.<br /><br />If you want to read excellent erotic fiction, I highly recommend Emma Holly. I challenge you to read \\"All U Can Eat\\" or \\"Strange Attractions\\" and then come back to the first five chapters of \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\". The difference will be apparent and you will be freed!

B007JM4CWY|5.0|Excellent on the Kindle Fire with no glitches yet.  I have completed 25 puzzles on the first two levels and all have solutions (including 1.6). Use only logic and no guessing to complete puzzles ; a mistake is often time -consuming to fix.  The tutorial was clear but additional help can be seen if you tap the upper right corner question mark.  If you like logic and number puzzles, CrossMe will be  appealing and challenging. If you just want to fill in the picture using visual clues, a coloring book is much more fun.
B004J1DBJI|3.0|when I saw this app, I was very excited. I had heard great things about it. I bought it but it won't download now...why wolfram? why?
B0054JZC6E|3.0|cool fun and so many games to play you buy the game so you can play it. have thu with it
0345803485|1.0|I would not have read this book had I not borrowed it from a friend. I'd downloaded the first two chapters and the writing was so bad that I knew there was no way I could buy it. However, the story seemed like it might be interesting. A friend loaned me the book and I took it on vacation.  The writing is bloated and repetitive (often repeating the same thing two sentences in a row, just in a slightly different way). The book should have been about half the length it was. Everyone I've talked to that read it said they basically skim read it because of the bloat.<br /><br />The characters are not likeable. Christian Grey is a controlling stalker type. He just happens to be really rich and hot. Ana is young and naive, a virgin. She finds that Christian is the first man she's really attracted to and because of this she's willing to do things that she would never do otherwise. She recognizes that he's controlling and a stalker (comments on it many times) yet she allows it to continue.  When she discovers his kinks, she's at first intrigued but then after being initiated into them via her first punishment, she's a wreck.<br /><br />The book gives a poor introduction to the BDSM lifestyle and will lead many to misconceptions of what it is about (and what the people who enjoy it are about). The idea that he fell into it because he was abused as a child and then introduced to it at 15 by an older woman.  That despite the fact that he's rick and controls a major corporation, he still NEEDS this kind of control over women and sex.  It's just sad.<br /><br />As for the sex scenes themselves, they are rather uninteresting. they are also few and far between. There were maybe 5 or 6 in the entire 500 page book. The first one is almost half way into the book, so if you are looking for erotica this is not it.
B007R3B4RG|5.0|A major travesty in life has been rectified.  Eleven years after the heartbreaking passing of the frontman of the greatest American rock and roll band, we are treated with fifteen lovingly completed works left behind by legend Joey Ramone.  Naturally I was over the moon with the news that there was to be a second Joey Ramone album, and I fought off skepticism that material released now would not live up to the quality work of the Ramones and Joey's brilliant and beautiful solo album [[ASIN:B00005V35H Don't Worry About Me]].  These feelings were more than blown away upon the first listen to this album.  Joey sounds incredible, the backing musicians sound wonderful, the production sounds very clean and modern.  From my previous experience hearing new tracks done with old vocals, I loved the Beatles recording \\"Free As A Bird\\" and \\"Real Love\\" with John Lennon's old track, but was unhappy with the fidelity, and I worried the same would befall these cuts.  Nothing doing, Joey sounds as alive as ever here!  And the mix is spot on, Joey is upfront and confident, all the instruments are crisp and can be pinpointed in the stereo mix.  I listened to the CD with over-ear headphones, I bet the vinyl's even better.<br /><br />You can really feel the love that was put into making this album honor Joey and his incredible love and respect for rock and roll.  From friends like Richie and Jean from Plasmatics, Joan Jett, Richie Ramone, Bun E Carlos, Ed Stasium, Andy Shernoff and Little Steven, the album sounds like a consistent album on a whole and not a collection of leftovers.  Most songs are mid-tempo power rock and roll (not exactly punk or hard rock), and very engaging.  It is a terrific follow-up to Don't Worry About Me and a great reminder of the talent Joey had.  All rock fans will enjoy this album.<br /><br />Tracks!<br />1. Rock and Roll Is the Answer- Great mid tempo rock groove with powerful guitars and backing vocals, co-written with Richie Stotts.  It's so wonderful to hear Joey again and his signature vocal inflections.  As with the whole album, it's a travesty these tracks have taken so long to surface, but not only am I thankful that they finally have, but that they sound SO killer.<br />2. Going Nowhere Fast- Cowritten with Daniel Rey, which brings back memories to their previous collaborations.  This could fit on Joey's previous solo album or [[ASIN:B00122MZAI Halfway To Sanity]].  Richie Ramone on drums, Ed Stasium does the rest.  Heavy hitting low end in the drums and guitars.<br />3. New York City- Pleathora of guest artists on this tribute to NYC, with a lot of backing vocals.  Fun mid-tempo rock.<br />4. Waiting For That Railroad-  Easy paced acoustic guitars had me concerned at first, until Joey's voice comes in and I just melt.  This has to be Joey's voice at his most beautiful, I can't believe this track was never before released.  The instrumentation picks up and the power and emotion build, and with Joey double tracked and doing his own call and response, it's just aural bliss.  This is my favorite track on the album easily.<br />5. I Couldn't Sleep- Upbeat fun poppy rock very reminiscent of All Screwed Up from [[ASIN:B00122MZ2G Brain Drain]].  Grab your hunny and dance on your coffeetable!<br />6.  What Did I Do To Deserve You?- Hard pop song, musicially sounds like a Glen Matlock hit acknowledging the great period of late 60's psychedelica to early 70's glitter rock.<br />7. Seven Days of Gloom- Great transition from the previous track, mid-feel rocker with some of Joey's almost-negative-but-actually-positive lyrics.  I found a lot of the charm of Joey's previous album was his positivity in the face of his ailments, such as I Get Knocked Down (But I'll Get Up), and this is in the same vein.<br />8. Eyes of Green- Mid tempo rock, keeps the fun and energy vibe going.<br />9. Party Line- Another highlight track, modernized 50's girl-group pop which highlights Joey's unique singing tone.  Reminds me of Dee Dee's beautiful \\"Baby Doll\\" track and the style of the most recent New York Dolls album, \\"Dancing Backwards In High Heels\\".<br />10. Merry Christmas- A slower, croony version of the classic Ramones track, with great jazzy drums and tremolo guitar.  Very pretty rendition for your next holiday.<br />11. 21st Century Girl- Featuring Joan Jett, good heavy guitars move this rock track along.<br />12. There's Got To Be More To Life- Jean Beauvoir performs all instrumentation on this track, which is another standout.  A bit new-wave, with a great pre-verse guitar hook with rock guitar and synthesizers.  Lyrics are simple, but sincere.<br />13. Make Me Tremble- a gentle acoustic beginning leads into a fun calypso track, which Joey performs well and throws in his signature vocal inflections again perfectly.  You feel Joey's happiness and feel good for having him, instead of bringing you down that he's gone.  The album stays upbeat and fun throughout, it's a great celebration of Joey and rock and roll.<br />14. Cabin Fever- Harder rock, the only time Joey's frustration comes out.  The dark tone and his vocals draw you in and you can feel his pain.<br />15. Life's A Gas- a short, pretty version of Joey with Ed on acoustic guitar.  Very happy and uplifting way to end out the album.<br /><br />I adore this record, and the people involved really put forth their love and energy to honor and share Joey with the world.  Great appreciation to those who made this album and brought us these wonderful gifts from Joey.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|you can easily get addicted to this game!  I have it on my phone and tablet... my whole family likes to play it
B007DIQC90|5.0|I had never heard of this band until I went on amazon, searched for bands I like and this was a suggestion based upon other bands I like such as Band of horses, iron and wine, the shins, coldplay, florence and the machine, brand new etc. I listened to a few songs and they are so good! I mean the whole album is fantastic. Its like a combination of indie/folk/irish...You know you have found a good band when you have never heard of them and you listen to the album and every song is awesome.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|not a single complain so far, very entertaining and even without spending real money the game is challenging but beatable. Fun.

B007IXWL2C|2.0|I was very bored by this book... The author repeated the same phrases and sentences so many times that I almost just stopped reading it. The book was not worth my $9.99 and I'm very disappointed. No imagination.
B005KELW26|5.0|I love Belkin brands. I love the swade black material insider. I am so in love with purple. I love how it fit my kindle. I would not ever take my kindle out of it because it protect my kindle so well.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is super cute. I love how you can get all the cute animals from the movie and make little families. however I have yet to determine the difference between visiting a neighbors village and liking a neighbors village. I also have trouble going to a neighbors village,  it sometimes tells me I need to update the game but when I do it doesn't update it just keeps saying I need to update.  overall its a great game though.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|The triolgy was greatt story telling. Book three was really good but not quite up to book 2 which was the best of all. Book 3 does not disappoint.
0758232225|5.0|Ms Davis has done it again!  As usual, I found it very difficult to put the book down for a single moment.  I truly appreciate how multiple characters refer you back to the scriptures, and not just Pastor Landris.  This book reminds us to stop judging people from what our natural eyes see. I loved the Marcus character, but was somewhat frustrated with him not being able to stand up to Sasha.  Angela's perseverance was remarkable; trust in God always. This was my 2nd time reading the book, and I learned something new about myself, thanks Ms Davis.  My library is almost complete with all of Ms Davis' literary work, she is a wonderful writer.  Thanks for blessing me.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|great game but it dosent have multiplayer. i play on an Ipad and the graffics r better the only reason I give it 4 star is because there is.no multiplayer
B005LAIGP0|4.0|For those jaded by haunted house movies and their typical jolt scares, this one serves.  The Woman in Black proves to be an important outing for Radcliffe as he assumes mature roles, and he delivers in this piece.  Well-directed, atmospheric and creepy with all the right elements, this film is worth repeat viewings.  Things you didn't notice earlier are apt to appear a second time if you look closely.  And it retains it's transition from big to small screen with little loss of intensity.  Great for a midnight distraction.
B007MJSQSK|5.0|I loved this movie!  It wasn't what I expected at all.  David Spielberg has done some great stuff, but a lot of it is very strange mash-ups with weird storylines.  This story was clear and straightforward.<br /><br />Yes, it was a touch frenetic, but it told an old-fashioned tale that is SO not modern movie!  There was no madman out to destroy the world, no evil corporation with military cohorts (or vice versa) - just that a blackhearted  villian has stolen a map and with his gang is trying to find a treasure.  They don't turn into skeletons and walk underwater, either.<br /><br />  We watched this for \\"movie night\\" in a room of ten adults (no kids) and everyone loved it. Knowing Spielberg I expected a) politically correct censuring and b) obnoxious kids and c) my son kept asking when the aliens were going to come through from the sky in their spaceship.  (If fact, all the adults kept saying, \\"NOW the aliens will come!\\" all through the movie.)<br /><br />None of that.  It really had the feel of an old-fashioned 1930's movie, despite the modern animation.  It was an excellent combination of the natural and fantasy -  I felt I could enjoy it without that strange disorientation I got from, say, \\"Polar Express\\".<br /><br />Now, if you have kids, there was fighting and the combo of fantasy animation and reality could be intense for younger ones.  Also, if you don't like movies for your kids with guns this will probably not be the one for you.  There is a touch of blood, too  - an assassinated agent marks a newspaper with a secret message with it.  So it's really not a \\"little ones\\" movie.  It's not a \\"G\\".  But for all us adults, it was great fun, and I'd say any kid but a young kid would like it.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised, and I'm buying a hard copy for my library.

If Amazon wants to attract clients to use their Kindle sales for selling their book which also makes a commission for Amazon then they should have a hard copy or pdf doc. for sale at a cheap cost.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I was disappointed with the final book of the Hunger Games trilogy. Seems like the author ran out of steam and was struggling to fill the pages.
B0000542D1|2.0|All the songs in this release sound as if they are playing too slow and too loud, with a booming, buzzy undertone. It's really distracting, even irritating. I sincerely hope they re-release this film in the near future with an improved soundtrack, as this one in my opinion is unacceptable, and does not do the Beatles credit.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|I found the WOOL Omnibus through reader reviews, and, having just finished the book, decided that I should continue the trend.<br />Hugh Howey is a very good writer. His characters are well-drawn, flawed, deep, and distinct.<br />The environment in WOOL, though, is what propels these novellas. You just have to know more, and, if you're like me, your mind will be trying to puzzle the whole thing out as you read.<br />I hope he does another series of WOOL, but regardless I'll be reading whatever he puts out. Good, consistent writers are hard to find. Howey is one of them.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I have read a lot of books in my life.  I have loved just about every one of them.  I started to read slammed about 2 weeks ago, however with all the stuff going on around my house I was only getting to read small pieces here and there.  I wasn't giving myself a chance to connect to the book.  After about 56% in I finally decided to just take a day and relax and finish it.  I truly just wanted to move onto the next book on my to be read list.  So, after my daycare kids left Thursday I sat down and turned on my kindle and started reading.  I didn't put the book down the entire day!  I sat in my bedroom and I cried...I didn't realize how much this book was going to hit home until it was too late.  I can't remember the last time I read a book where I literally had to stop, take a few deep breathes, wipe my eyes and blow my nose, just so I could continue on.  As the book came to a close I wanted more....I needed to know....I bought Point of Retreat.  I am OVER JOYED that I read Slammed...so much so I think I may need to read it again and again and again!!!  If you're even considering reading this book DO IT and don't stop until you're finished.
B00006RJ59|4.0|Action star Dolph Lundgren got his big break playing Russian Ivan Drago in [[ASIN:B0006GAOGI Rocky IV]] (1985), and he again plays a Russian in his fourth film Red Scorpion (1988), a military adventure set in Africa.  Lundgren is Lt. Nikolai Rachenko, a member of \\"Spetsnaz\\"(Russian special forces) who is sent undercover to locate and assassinate a resistance leader.  The action sequences are generally very well executed and often extreme, as the brute force of modern mechanized armies are unleashed on the native people.  The film doesn't dwell on tragedy, taking a mostly surreal approach to the mayhem, and stylizing the violence.  Red Scorpion also includes a \\"spiritual\\" element, as Rachenko comes to realize how the Soviets have been abusing the people, and becomes enlightened to their native ways.<br /><br />Events take place in an African nation where forces of the Soviet Union and Cuba, are involved in the subjugation of the native people.  Operating independently of the Cubans, the Soviets are after a rebel leader named Ango Sundata (Ruben Nthodi) who is in hiding somewhere in the bush.  Following orders from General Vortek (T.P. McKenna), Rachenko gets himself tossed in jail, where Sundata's close friend Kallunda Kintash (Al White) is being held.  When the opportunity presents itself, Rachenko, Kintash, and gutter-mouthed American reporter Dewey Nelson (M. Emmet Walsh), make a spectacular escape.<br /><br />The trio eventually meet up with Sundata`s group, but Nikolai fails in his attempt to kill him and is knocked out and captured by the Cubans.  Nikolai is abandoned by his commander, and suffers some cruel torture, before again escaping from captivity.  Out in the desert, Nikolai is rescued by a native tribesman (Regopstaan), who teaches him the ways of the desert, and how to survive.  For his accomplishments, Nikolai receives a scorpion shaped tattoo, and when he rejoins what remains of Sunadata's group, he finds acceptance, and becomes the leader of an assault force against the communists.  Where all the armed rebels came from is something of a mystery, as Dolph employs his trademark shotgun, before setting his sights on destroying his former commander<br /><br />Red Scorpion is mostly about featuring fighting and destruction, however there is only so much that can be blown up in a desert.  The film definitely has its yahoo moments, but also looks at the tragedy of war.  The scenes where a Hind gunship is featured in the destruction of a small village, while deploying chemical weapons may be a bit heavy handed, but are still quite striking.  There is a certain subtlety and poignancy during the transitional period that Rachenko spends with the native people.  It features almost no verbal communication, yet is still quite understandable.<br /><br />While Red Scorpion will never be mistaken for more than a big 80's action movie, the humanitarian elements do provide balance and some sense of realism, which kind of separates it from the pack.  Lundgren's performance isn't broad, but it has some depth, and familiar faces like Carmen Argenziano and Brion James, help give the opposition some personality.  M. Emmet Walsh's character is over the top and excessively noisy, but provides the film's only comic relief.  The pan and scan version will soon be replaced with a new Bluray/DVD combo edition, with lots of extras.ult force against the communists.

Otherwise, the app is perfect. I've tried a lot of similar apps, this is the only one I still play.

0316789720|4.0|Another great book by Ed Emberley.  My son and I created a wonderful circus scene using the instructions in this book. There are so many pictures illustrated and they are broken down into easy to follow directions.  My only issue with the book is that the pictures are small and it looks rather busy on the page.  However, I still love this book and love being able to draw pictures like I have never been able to draw before.
0345803485|5.0|gawd...whudda ride.  I don't care what anyone else says, this story of healing was phenomenal.  I loved Mr. Grey's angst and damaged soul...I love how he was tragically and inexplicably drawn to Miss Steele (much to his dismay and confusion)...I loved his confusion, his depression & fear...and finally his capitulation, healing and learning to trust.  Such an incredible story and exceptionally portrayed.<br /><br />Anastasia Steele is an almost 22 year old college student facing her final two weeks of school before graduation.  Ana is a good person...self-sacrificing, shy, slightly introverted and suffering low self-esteem.  She's also stubborn....and get her riled and she can show a temper to be proud of.  She's also a virgin.  She's the perfect strong, matching character to one such as Mr. Grey - - her innocent, pure, genuine self is the perfect choice for throwing one such as arrogant, experienced and worldly Mr. Grey into a tailspin.  And she does, much to her confusion...without trying.  Gawd...I loved it all...I couldn't put this book down.<br /><br />When Ana meets Christian Grey, she's intimidated merely by his presence (much like any female who meets him).  Christian Grey is a 27 year old powerful multi-billionaire bachelor from Seattle..  He's the epitome of confidence.  He's handsome, magnetic and supremely arrogant.  He's also a Dominant who is strongly attracted to Anastasia Steele.  Christian doesn't \\"do\\" girlfriends.  He's not a romantic.  He has short term D/s relationships and he's happy with that arrangement.  But he recognizes the electric attraction between him and Ana that he's never felt before.  He must have her!<br /><br />The bottom line is Christian Grey is intrigued by the purity and genuineness of Anastasia Steele...There is no facade.  He's intrigued and enamored of everything about her, which continually draws his interest of her.<br /><br />Because she's not his usual Submissive (and doesn't understand the \\"submissive rules\\"), Christian is constantly reiterating himself and trying to educate Ana on his rules and her \\"role\\"...which in turn forces him to reexamine himself and all the \\"why's\\" of his actions.  Her logical and intelligent legitimate questions..though innocently and sincerely asked, repeatedly forces Christian to inadvertently question and doubt himself...ie; who he is, why he lives the way he does etc.  ...nobody has ever asked these questions (or ANY questions of his lifestyle - - they simply submit and obey)... and nobody has ever questioned or doubted him! (they wouldn't dare!!)  But Ana wants desperately to understand the \\"why's\\" of Christians lifestyle, so she's constantly curious.  This ultimately begins Christians' healing process, while driving him to need and depend on her presence more and more for his peace of mind.<br /><br />This is a story of beginnings, discovery and healing.  Told in first person, this Author does a fabulous job of keeping both main characters personalities precise and free of confusion.  The reader knows explicitly what each character thinks and feels and why they react in certain ways.  Exceptional story...exceptionally told.

But I have to be honest, after almost years and the train wreck that was \\"Born Into This\\" I didn't thought The Cult still had a great record in them, they gladly surprised me. They continue the sound of the capsules but with Bob Rock aboard he takes it to another level. I'm not his biggest fan but he does know how to make a band sounds good. Ian voice it's as strong as ever and his lyrics deep, Billy's riffs are on point and Tempesta's drumming is tight. If you are a Cult fan just buy it. You wont regret it.

0345803485|4.0|I read Fifty Shades before all of the hype started, and, in many ways, I'm glad that I did.  I didn't have any high (or low) expectations of it.  As a matter of fact, I had none.  I arrived at Fifty Shades shortly after reading Gabriel's Inferno, and I didn't read into the book's description a whole lot - I just figured that Christian Grey was similar to all other \\"tortured soul\\" male leads that enjoy a little rougher vanilla sex on the side.  I could not have been more wrong.  If I had bothered pondering the cryptic remarks in the description surrounding Christian's tastes, I would not have read it.<br /><br />Because of my lack of preparation, I went on a roller coaster ride with this book.  Originally, when I found out about Christian's \\"hobby,\\" I was immediately disturbed and semi-disgusted, and I almost stopped reading.  I thought that Ana was an idiot for even bothering with him and, especially, having sex with him after she finds out the truth.  I mean, hello!  If he was just an average Joe (lacking the billionaire/playboy facade) from across the way, would she have bothered sticking around after he drops that bomb?  Probably not.  However, I trudged on.  The book, or, more specifically, Christian, began to grow on me.  I started to see E.L. James' attempts to make the two personalities work, and that, more than anything, got me through to the end.<br /><br />What I liked:<br />- Christian Grey.  I haven't found (in recent memory) a tortured hero quite like him.  He has the usual trials (rough family history, addictive personality, etc.), but there are some curve balls there too.  You aren't even going to find out his whole story until Fifty Shades Freed.  Despite the fact that I was initially disturbed by him, E.L. James gave enough of a hint that he was capable of redemption, and the more I found out, the more I started to feel sorry for him.  The more I hoped that he could work through all of it.  Christian was tortured, sexy, disturbing, heartfelt, and so much more.  I kept reading because I wanted to see how two completely opposing personalities could end up working together.<br />- Ana's inner sex goddess.  As you will see below, I didn't find Ana particularly interesting.  However, I enjoyed the comedic relief that her inner sex goddess afforded when she salsa danced or fist pumped at a victory Ana made.<br />- The incorporation of technology.  A lot of communication done by Ana and Christian is via email, which seems to be becoming more and more common these days in romance novels as we move forward in technological advancement.  As a fan of technology and having communicated a great deal with my own husband via email in the early days of our relationship, I felt a personal connection to that element and enjoyed its incorporation into the book.<br /><br />What I didn't like:<br />- The diction and syntax.  It's very unimaginative, repetitive, and adolescent.  It evoked the feeling, in my opinion, that this book was created for fun, without much thought put towards the nitty gritty details.  If you notice these types of details and put a great emphasis on them in your reading experience, you will probably be put off by Fifty Shades.<br />- The intense S & M scenes.  I understand that these scenes feed into the plot of the book and the personality of Fifty Shades, but they were hard for me to stomach.  Had only one or two small circumstances changed in some of the sex scenes, they would fit the profile of a rape scene, and that bothered me.  But, I guess, this is just my own personal preference in love scenes.<br />- Ana.  There wasn't anything particularly unique about her.  She was a virgin, she was clumsy, she was quiet, she had some self esteem issues, she was completely unaware that every other male character in her life had a thing for her, and she was into books - just like 20,350,923,530 other female characters I've read.  No weird quirks, no unusual fears, nothing to make her stand out from the crowd, except, perhaps, her addiction to Master Christian.<br /><br />A lot of the negative reviews seem to be giving Fifty Shades such a bad rating because of the writing and because of Ana, especially now that it is on the best seller list.  I noticed that many couldn't understand why such \\"crap\\" ended up getting so popular.  For me, as a fan, I didn't fall in love with it because of the way it was written or because of Ana.  As I said before, the writing style (and Ana, for that matter) is unimaginative, repetitive, and adolescent.  I became addicted because of Christian Grey, and the cloud of insanity surrounding him, and I believe a lot of other readers did as well.  No, I don't secretly enjoy pain in sex, as most people would assume when I say that I'm a fan of the Fifty Shades series.  I'm a fan of unique, seemingly opposite characters that work through a number of problems to arrive on the same level.  In that department, Fifty Shades delivered for me.<br /><br />My thoughts/suggestions to all potential readers would be:<br />- This book is most definitely NOT for younger or sheltered readers, who are not accustomed to harsh content.  There's a lot of hardcore sex, harsh language, and mature situations.<br />- The use of technology as one of the main sources of communication may be off-putting for some readers who prefer the more conventional methods, i.e. meeting in person, talking over the phone.<br />- The writing style is very bland and does not require a lot of brain power to understand.<br />- It is a bit obvious that E.L. James is from the U.K., and, while I wasn't bothered by it, there are some who would be annoyed that the characters sometimes didn't speak or act as if they were raised in the U.S.  If you are looking for a completely accurate experience of being in the northwestern U.S., it isn't in Fifty Shades.<br />- Fifty Shades is a very polarizing book.  You are either going to love it, or you are going to hate it.  A number of different factors will contribute to that, but I think a good portion of the decision will be related to its leading man and his vices.

B007LB0RXQ|1.0|To present a rather un-congested, and hopefully a Reader's Digest version compared to all the other opinions here, I'll suffice to say, that MDNA is neither inventive, exploratory, competitive, unique or exciting. It simply suffers creativity that even is close to being 'her'. In growing up and through the highlighted decades of MDNA, she is a performer's performer; she can deliver.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I think she's capitalized on the start of her decline. Lyrically unchallenging, poor use of curse words and nothing symbolic of her voice from the past; it's nearly all synthesized now.<br /><br />Sorry 'MDNA', loved your work in the past; I regret purchasing this one from you. Better luck next time.<br /><br />** Point learned: NEVER purchase an album right away; give it some play time and try some 'previews'. I learned my lesson yet again with this album!<br /><br />.. And YES, I am a fan... she just missed the mark here. There's no other way to say it...
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I have seen all of Downton Abbey so far and oh my, it's so good.  Love this show and highly recommend it.  The acting is fantatic.. the sets, the writing.. all great.  It is completely absorbing.  My husband and I watched it together.
0345803485|5.0|My expectation for this story was high and I was not disappointed.  I am an avid reader and this is by far the best book I have read in a long time.  The characters are still alive in my mind.  I am frustrated when I hear that this book is just about sex.  The story is so much more.  It is a story about love, people coming together and family.  To experience the changes in the main characters was impressive.  It is well worth reading!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love this book, all the reviews were right. It brought out a little of every emotion. I enjoyed the whole trilogy.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|this Bible app is def worth a download I first got it for my ipod touch and thought it was awesome I got everyone else in my family to get it as well the different versions like the niv and king James make this a 5 star app. also I love the reading feature great for those words that are kinda tough to otherwise pronounce.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|It's good.. not as good as the previous seasons.. but good.  I wasn't that fond of the ending but what were they really going to do?  The whole show .. all 6 seasons were such a romp with so many mysteries and interesting characters that I wanted it to go on forever!<br /><br />I had a crush on Sawyer and was disappointed that he ended up with the doctor.  I never liked her ... but other than that, it was all good. I'm happy I watched it even though I knew how it ended due to all the media coverage when the season actually ended.

0345803485|1.0|I give everyone and everything a fair shot, and I like to form my own opinions of things.  That being said, I should have followed my gut after reading the reviews and not spent the money on this.<br /><br />When the Twilight novels first came out, back when I was naive and not well read, I enjoyed the series a lot.  That led me to read some fan fiction here and there.  That is all this is.  It is a fanfic, and not even a well written one at that.  This is a typical \\"I want to live out my crazy sexual fantasies through Bella and Edward story.\\"  Trust me there are thousands out there.  I know it originated as a fanfic, and that is honestly how it should have stayed.  As I read the \\"novel\\" (I use this term loosely), it was easy to pick out who was who.  She changed the characters' names, obviously, and maybe one or two physical characteristics.  Other than that, it is canon pairings and all the characters pretty much have their same traits.  I literally replaced the character names as I read because that's how it was originally written, and sadly, it almost made more sense then.  You know it is a poorly written fanfic also when the author describes every room, outfit, car and feeling poorly in extreme detail.  Seriously, I am not an english major.  I hate writing.  Those who enjoy it more power to you, but just because you enjoy it doesn't mean you're good at it.  I know middle schoolers who write better than this woman.  Hell, maybe I'll print some of the sexless portions out and have them edit it.  I have nothing against this being a fanfic, honestly, I read some awesome stories on fanfiction.net that do deserve to be rewritten with different character names and descriptions and be published.  The main difference between those and this lies in the fact that if you changed everyone's hair color and name in a really well written all human fanfic, you probably wouldn't be able to tell it was based off of Twilight.  The other thing that irked me, which seems to annoy everyone, is the repetition.  I would go into it more, but so many reviewers already have.<br /><br />Essentially what I'm trying to say is that if you want a poorly written, \\"lemon\\" filled fanfic, I would honestly just go over to fanfiction.net.  You can find plenty of them, and the best part is, they don't cost a penny.<br /><br />Note: Lemon is the term for a sex scene in fanfics.  Just wanted to clarify that for those of you not acquainted with the topic.  Secondly, I was not able to finish the book.  I made it halfway through before I just couldn't stand Ana's \\"inner goddess\\" and the thousand ways to say grey eyes anymore.

They all now have their own copy b/c they loved what I had been reading to them so much. They, like I, are hanging on Hazel's every word. Thank you for a book that's getting teens who don't already love to read, loving this book.
0756405890|5.0|I read the first chapter and put this book down for a few weeks.  I'm a lot less patient than most readers.  Anyway,  I next decided to start reading the book about 1/2 of the way in -- this is after Kvothe has become a student.  (I have no problem starting in the middle of a story.)  I was quickly engrossed and couldn't put this down.<br /><br />At the end, I just had to know what was happening in that bar that was introduced at the beginning of the book. I went back and read the beginning and really enjoyed it.  I've read through it at least 2 times completely, and then read the next book in the series.<br /><br />In this book, Kvothe has a rags to not riches story, but at least a rags to \\"being able to get by\\" story.  Enough characters to fill the world, but not so many that you can't keep track.  I really wanted to know how he was going to find his next meal, the details of his work at Kilvin's workshop.  There is a larger story packaged around the smaller story of his university experience, and I was pulled into both of them.  Well written, not that embarrassing dreck you often see in fantasy books.

Darcy is dashing, Lizzie endearing, Cousin Collin is a perfect peacock, and so on. The music is exquisite, with many smooth, yet dramatic tunes, most of them played on the piano. Both of the dance scenes are incredibly well done. The music sets your feet to tapping, and the dances are beautifully choreographed. No matter how well you know the storyline, you will be enchanted once more as you watch this charming story of Pride and Prejudice.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Perfect game to kill time in a car ride. easy to learn, quick to play, and no ads in the way
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|this game is at an ok level. the reason i only gave it a 3 star is because most of the time when you hit the pigs they dont die. rovio needs to make the game a little more easier to play because half the time the oigs get hit and they dont go boom. it is a good free game but not worth buying

B005FLX2WC|5.0|This is a collaboration made in heaven. Beth has been around a while and Joe, well that's another story, the man was weaned on a guitar.<br /><br />I've read that, and I quote, \\"Beth started her career as far down as it gets... performing in the streets of L.A., sitting cross-legged with an acoustic guitar and singing her heart out.  And her first major gigs weren't in some concert hall or in some studio... she did the Chitlin' Circuit.  And, let me tell you, you don't blow people away in those venues if you can't deliver.  It's in this world that Beth's fuse got lit, and a few lucky people got to experience the heat.<br /><br />Fortunately for Beth, one of those people was David Wolff, who was instrumental in breaking Cyndi Lauper into superstardom. He heard it, he felt it... ¦and he got it.\\"<br /><br />From a Biography that I read,and I quote, \\"And maybe her greatest collaboration has happened in the last year.  She met Blues/Rock superstar guitarist, Joe Bonamassa, and they crafted a truly visionary album, \\"Don't Explain\\", produced by Kevin Shirley (producer for Led Zeppelin, Journey, Rush and Iron Maiden).<br /><br />And Beth really appreciates that something special has happened to her. \\"When I started making this record with Joe, I got a feeling I haven't had in a long time.  For Joe, it's all about the melody, and, as a singer, I feel so grateful to be working with someone who is so musically evolved.  And Kevin Shirley is a genius.  He gets you right to a place that makes you feel totally comfortable.  He really knows how to work with artists.\\" Beth and Joe plan to do another album together in 2013.<br /><br />Once again, thanks to \\"Don't Explain\\" and live gigs with Joe, the world has stood up and taken notice of Beth Hart.  It has been nominated at the 23rd Blues Music Awards for \\"Contemporary Blues Album Of The Year\\".  The Blues Rock Review has included the album in their \\"Top 20 Albums of 2011\\".  And maybe the London Times has said it best recently in their review of her concert at Dingwalls (and she is already sold out in Paris).  \\"Don't Explain\\" has lifted her to a new level of rock n' roll celebrity, and she was here to make the most of it.\\"<br /><br />I'm a big Joe Bonamassa fan and while following his career I came to a fork in the road, one of many forks that Joe seems to put forth to his fans, and when taking that fork in the road I was introduced to Beth Hart's music.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is an awesome game! that's why I rated it five stars. I haven't seen anybody else report this problem, so it may just be mine. but all of the sudden I cant do goals... when a person has an envelop over there head and I click on it, it says that I've already done this goal and it gives me the reward. I miss the goals because they were one of my favorite things about the game. :( please fix. (everyone please get this game! its a lot of fun and no one else has reported this so I think its just mine.)
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|This book is part biography, part advice and part humor book.  Tina Fey talks about handling show business, but in such a way you can apply to many professional environments.  She talks about growing up and life lessons learned along the way.

B006TVQTHW|5.0|This case is great. Almost near perfect. Big for huge gaming cards, lots of expansion slots and can fit 3 external drives. Supports USB 3.0 and has lots expansion for extra fans. The only con I have for this case is the standoffs. Most are very easily accessible but the one in the top left is a pain. Other than that one standoff, fantastic case.
B004WJREMW|5.0|Paul McCartney was facing 1980 much the same as he was 1970. First there was trouble,in this case a very public arrest in Japan for marijuana possession. And that spelled the end of Wings after the fiasco. In both cases,on the 1970 Beatles breakup and his 1980 arrest Paul was starting to seem like a bad luck charm when it came to ill timed public scandals. Basically he decided to do what he had done just after the Beatles dissolved: make an album DIY style at his home. Luckily Paul's financial security was on the opposite level it was when he made his first DIY album a decade earlier. Also music had changed. The Beatles broke up and punk,prog and disco had all come and gone. It was now the new wave era. Synthesizers,an experimental instrument the Beatles even embraced in towards the end of their career,were now becoming very vogue in popular music. So the instruments,now smaller and sleeker than they had been found their way into McCartney's one man band. There was always a little part of me that wondered if the unusual nature of this album would prevent it from being a candidate for a proper reissue. I couldn't be happier I was wrong.<br /><br />  As for the album itself it is very influenced by new wave production but on it's most quirky,Devo-type end. \\"Coming Up\\" was the hit. One of the funkiest songs Paul ever made with a bass/guitar interaction right out of the JB's. But it rocked too in a very clean sort of way. Which..I suppose what funk usually ends up being for most people. \\"Temporary Secretary\\" is built on a very odd melody and spastic,high pitched electronics. As for the lyric? Let's just say it can be taken more than one way. Very view tracks on this album are guitar based. Really only the hard core blues of \\"On The Way\\",the almost disco/rock style \\"Nobody Knows\\" and the echoey Elvis sendup \\"Bogey Music\\" actually qualify as being recognizable rock n roll. \\"Waterfalls\\",creating some haunting melodic synth washes is a ballad that is either directed at himself,environmental issues or both. One of McCartney's most compelling melodies. \\"Front Parlour\\",\\"Summer Day song\\" and the pounding dance track \\"Frozen Jap\\" are actually very innovative electronica/dance instrumentals all with convoluted Asian type melodies. \\"Darkroom\\" again takes off with a very electronic reggae/funk rhythm. The album closes with \\"One Of These Days\\",a good ballad but an fairly average tune on an otherwise innovative and challenging album.<br /><br />  Of the bonuses there's the live \\"hit\\" version of \\"Coming Up\\",actually slicker than the rough sounding album version. Also there's another reggae type funk groove with \\"Check My Machine\\" which showcases Paul's early interest in proto sampling found sound collaging again. \\"Secret Friend\\" is a dreamy,elongated and melodic jam that looks towards the latin/salsa electronica of recent years. On of my favorite McCartney numbers of this era. \\"Bogey Wobble\\" is an outtake from the album I never heard,actually more structured new wave pop,not dissimilar to Todd Rundgren's Utopia at this time. \\"Mr H.Atom/You Know What You'll Get Baby\\" starts out comparing male/female chromosomal differences and than goes into this proto electropop jam that would probably make Lady Gaga a bit envious. The album ends with another unrealesed ten+ minute epic in \\"Al You Horse Riders/Blue Say\\",a very complex and melodically interesting funky jazz/pop type extended number. By finding new ways to combine pop,synthesized electronic,funk,reggae,latin,funk and even jazz into this DIY/pop-rock setting Paul unintentionally innovated a few styles of modern music during these sessions and also created a few other as yet unused ones. This may be way it puzzled so many at that time. Most rock stars base themselves more in popularity,instrumental muscularity  and endurance than in creative innovation. That's why the Van Morrison's,the Todd Rundgren's and the Paul McCartney's tend to stand out a lot. Honestly if someone asked me what my favorite Paul McCartney albums were,this would easily rate within the top five.ul McCartney albums were,this would easily rate within the top five.
B001LF347E|5.0|I have to say I love this show, I'm addicted to Merlin! I remember the first time I watched the show I was hooked right away. The story starts out with Merlin coming to Camelot for his Mother sent him to stay with the court Physisian Giaus an old man who knows much of magic, which the king has forbidden. Upon meeting Arthur, Merlin talks back to the rude Prince who Merlin decides is a brat and the two end up dueling. As the story progesses Merlin learns he is destined to help Arthur become a King that will bring back magic and has to secretly use magic to save Arthur countless of times, allthewhile Arthur unaware. Merlin, who becomes Arthur's personal servent, begins to see a side to Arthur that is both loyal and kind and begins to see he is a Prince worthy to be King. So While the two started off hating one another, due to always being together their relationship begins to grow into a friendship so strong, I call it 'Bromance'.<br /><br />This is my favorite show, and I believe anyone who watches it will love it! The relationship between Merlin and Arthur alone makes this show, but for those who need more every episode is filled with excitment, adventure, magic and hummor!
B0081KTI0E|3.0|The costumes were great. The acting was mediocre. I gave it a three because the ending was good. There were some good parts and I was greatful for fast forward through the long drawn out, supposed to be suspensefilled, scenes of anticipation.
6305161992|5.0|Viewed: 5/12<br />Rate: 9<br /><br />5/12: Showdown in Little Tokyo is my kind of a film, and it is safe to say that it may be the best Dolph Lundgren's picture. Having Brandon Lee to partner up with him is an extra treat. What really happened to Tia Carrere after mid 90's? She was on a rise during the early 90's but had fallen off the map completely since then. Yes, Showdown in Little Tokyo is a stupid film with so many improbably impossible moments. I just ignore them and enjoy the fun. Of course, Kenner gets shot right above his heart yet he is fully functional and able to engage in a sword battle with an experience Japanese swordsman. So many bullets flying all over the place, not a single one of them save one hit any of the good guys. No matter how imminent death comes, they will always find a way to escape. Despite the fact that they are cops, the two don't really act like it and failed to follow the law by the book. As a matter of fact, they were thoroughly above the law the entire time and should have gotten their badges removed and sent to prison for a lifetime. So, why don't I care? Because it is an entertaining picture. I love Mark Lester's works, and Class of 1984 remains a very influential film. All in all, Showdown in Little Tokyo is a lot more action packed than either Rising Sun or Black Rain.

This kind of reminds me of an artist named Anjulie in terms of how the music captured my attention and demanded further listens. Get the Deluxe edition since the bonus cuts are great, too.

Reading the book straight through the night becuase I could not force myself to put it down. Travis and Abby keep you wanting more, wanting to know what emotional rollercoaster will ensue next. Taking an unsuspecting twist mid-way you certainly aren't disappointed with a predictable subtle love story. Thank you Jamie mcGuire for leaving me wanting more.
B005HSL626|4.0|I like this game.  I would have given it a 5/5 but the classic mode gets a bit old. the game is still addicting with acrade mode and zen mode.  it is still really fun and I can play it for hours. me and my sister compete to see who can get a better score.
B0000027RL|3.0|I believe Pearl Jam has evolved into a great band, and that Eddie Vedder is a fantastic artist and performer.  That said, this first album showed promise but is nowhere near the quality of what was soon to come.  To me, they really came into their own with Vitalogy and continue to make fantastic records to this day.  I loved this album at the time, and still enjoy much of it now, but it sounds like a band that hasn't quite figured out it out yet (both musically and artistically).

B003O86FMW|5.0|Incredible story, but what's even more amazing is that if you thought the first book was a page turner, this one will have you reeling, and not hesitating for more. Practically a cliff hanger at the end of each chapter, keeping you reading until your eyes hurt. :) In a good way.
B000O599XK|5.0|This is just about as close to perfection as a movie can get.  Everybody was at the top of their game making this one.  John Wayne is pitch perfect as Chance, his star power and powerful screen presence shine in every scene.  Dean Martin is a perfect contrast as Dude, delivering an understated, subtle performance as the tourtured drunk seeking redemption.  Angie Dickenson, as Feathers, suggests a warm sexuality with her every appearence on-screen.  Walter Brennen provides the comic relief as Stumpy, the crabby, mean sprited old man charactor at which he was so familar and so adept. Ward Bond provides additional western flavor in a small but effective role as a wagon master. Ricky Nelson sings.<br />This movie has received some critisism in the past for being a bit meandering in its storytelling. This only works in its favor as it gives the viewer a chance to get to know and like the charactors, which you most surley will as the film progresses.  The best movies create a world that the viewer might like to be a part of and anyone watching this one will want to pull on a pair of boots and strap on a six shooter about half the through its running time.<br />This was director Howard Hawks last great film in a career that included the original Scarface, Bringing up Baby and Red River. He would be recognized as a great film-maker on this one alone.<br />If you are a fan of westerns, a John Wayne fan, a Howard Hawks fan, hell, even a Dean Martin fan, or if you just appreciate damn good movies, get this one fast. It is truly an unrecognized classic of American film.
0316056863|1.0|Don't get me wrong I love Tina Fey however this book is all over the place. I guess I was spoiled by Chelsea Handler's books and I was king of expecting somewhat of the same format. This book was all over the place, I'm almost half way through and I have no idea what I am reading about. It's boring, it's drawn out, and it really follows no time line. Regret the purchase. :(
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It was driving me crazy. Angry Birds I want to play Angry Birds, do you have Angry Birds. I had to check it out and was sure it would be a waste of time. I got hooked sending those birds after those pigs. Birds flying in the air hitting the target, or missing the mark. Everyone wants to play. Colorful, action figures awsome target pratice. My husband, my daughter along with myself have all spent time relaxing (while keeping a quick response time , and a clear aim, all developed through pratice)/ It is a game that gets you hooked on having a good time. A must.
0060557818|4.0|I purchased this novel, 'Neverwhere', because I had truly enjoyed reading author Neil Gaiman's 2001 novel 'American Gods.' And to say the least, he has yet to disappoint me.<br /><br />The novel tells the story of an underground London, not to be confused with the London Underground. It is a magical place inhabited with people who can open doors anywhere (even when there are no doors), sewer dwellers, and angels. The main characters, Richard Mayhew and Door, meet by chance when Door appears before Richard and his Fiancee, bloodied and beaten. Richard, against the orders of his fiancee, takes the girl back to his flat, and from there the troubles arise.<br /><br />It is a fantastic book, both literally and figuratively. At 370 well-written pages, the novel is at a perfect length. Just long enough to be pleasing, and just short enough to not be preachy. Gaiman illustrates the novel with prose that brings the characters and locales to life. He truly is a gifted writer.<br /><br />It truly is great. I recommend it highly.

B006LQQ1GE|2.0|I can't believe the sales and hype of this mediocre album. Actually, I do believe it: Somebody that I Used to Know is a great song/youtube sensation (millions and millions of hits.) Unfortunately, the rest of the CD is as listless and bland as a middle-aged eighties cover band (wedding cake, not included.)<br /><br />There are a few bright spots: The Peter Gabriel lite of Eyes Wide Open, the blue eyed motown wannabe, I Feel Better and finally, the melancholy send-off Bronte (ethereal and moving.) Making Mirrors is a release that screams, \\"DOWNLOAD a few! Forget the rest...\\"<br /><br />For those of you who like this release, please do yourself a favor and check out Peter Gabriel's early releases and anything by the under-rated but vastly superior Elbow. These artists fully deliver with imagination and talent. Gotye is talented and he may get there, but for now he is making smoke and mirrors.

B001POX73C|3.0|Cotillion is a great romantic farce, with lots of witty banter & historical accuracy.  Unfortunately, the Kindle edition has messed up the line breaks so badly that it's hard to tell which character is speaking.

I knew what was happening since I'd read a physical edition before the Kindle edition, but for someone reading for the first time it's probably better to get a physical book.
0061726826|2.0|Amor deliria nervosa, most commonly known as Love, is the deadliest decease known. A procedure has been perfected to rid humans of the deliria, and Lena Haloway can't wait to have her procedure done. But one fateful meeting will change her perception of the world, as Lena discovers that everything she believed in is wrong.<br /><br />The prose is like insanely good. The way things are described especially emotions, feelings, and the like tugged at something in my heart. This description of Love is one example:<br /><br />  Love: a single word, a wispy thing, a word no bigger or longer than an edge. That's what it is: an edge; a razor. It draws up through the center of your life, cutting everything in two. Before and after. The rest of the world falls away on either side.<br />  Before and after--and during, a moment no bigger or longer than an edge.<br /><br />While I did enjoy the beautiful prose it sometimes dragged a little. Lena would talk--about her mom, about her decease, about the evaluations--for paragraphs unending. She spends more time talking about what she did, and what happened that there was little narrating of the present. I just wanted to get on with the story and the action but that never came.<br /><br />I found the premise of the story to be very interesting. I like the idea of love being a disease, and Oliver does a great job of convincing me with all the quotes of The Book of Shhh at the start of every chapter. The list of symptoms was a really nice touch. However, the rest of the dystopian idea didn't really work for me. It's supposed to be this super strict society yet Lena gets away with everything and not even in a clever way. The only thing she has going for her is that she lies like there's no tomorrow, and it's like in the movie The Invention of Lying where no one expects it so everyone believes the lies. Also, there are supposedly hundreds of Invalids (people without the procedure) who not only live happily in the Wilds but have infiltrated every government agency in the city. Really? What happened to the super tight security of the invincible and cruel government? Apparently they're easily duped.<br /><br />Another thing that left me sorely disappointed was the romance. The story completely revolves around the concept of love and I was expecting a thrilling, swoon-worthy, heart wrenching, and above all believable romance. I didn't find that. As Lena hasn't experienced love before, the relationship she develops with Alex is one that felt superficial. She incessantly babbles about everything she feels for this amazing and gorgeous boy, but all the time I'm very conscious of the fact that this she doesn't really know what she's talking about. She doesn't know the real meaning of love and sacrifice and dedication to another. Lena does get to some impressive conclusions, but again not believable. She doesn't know about love, yet she suddenly sees the light and understands, and we move right along with more babble about love.<br /><br />The story finally ends with an action packed chapter that's left in a cliffhanger. I've mentioned before how much I hate them, especially after the grueling experience that was reading this book.ted every government agency in the city. Really?

B0071XO8RA|5.0|As a scientist and hardcore sci-fi fan, an author must have the ability to write in a scientifically plausible manner to allow me to suspend my disbelieve that what I am reading is really possible. The story must be scientifically accurate (or at least plausible) in order for me to enjoy the book.  The writing style, character development, dialogue, style and pace of this book was excellent!

0545259088|2.0|Shiver and Linger made their way to my little pile of books last year, and while I was interested in the story I had trouble with the narrative because it didn't flow as easy for me as other books. However, once I got the hang of it and the constant POV shifts I thoroughly enjoyed every page. That's why this year I eagerly waited for the release of Forever.<br /><br />It's a conclusion to the tragic-sweet story of Grace and Sam, but it left me somewhat cold...and pissed. All this time I've been taken along for a fairy tale of love, loss, and dealing with things that are out of your control, and for this last book I expected to feel more. But, like the characters with their constant cool and stoic attitude towards the tragedy that was turning out to be their life, I kept feeling nothing. Even when Sam and Grace finally reunite after months apart there's almost no reaction whatsoever. None! Nada! After going through two heart wrenching novels about Sam and Grace's love and struggles to stay together, and the reaction is...<br /><br />I kept waiting for the parts with Isabel and Cole, because honestly their \\"relationship\\" outshone Grace and Sam's. It was like, Isabel and Cole had suddenly become main characters and left Grace and Sam to fade into the background. And if this was the third book of say a six book series that would be fine. But no, it's the last one.<br /><br />I also thought I would get some answers to some of the main issues like: the whole wolf dilemma and why they change with the cold, or why Beck turned Sam, or even if they could get a real cure...but again I was left wanting because we never get a clear answer to it and the book ends.<br /><br />The final part was all interesting and fast paced with them mentioning the time back and forth and the sunrise looming in the horizon, but the ending was almost a non-ending. It's one of those that I really hate, because it is neither good nor bad. Like...it's not black or white, it's freaking grey, and grey does not satisfy me. At all.<br /><br />My only recommendation is to read the book because it's the conclusion to a great series, but don't expect it to elicit strong emotions like the other two.does not satisfy me.

B007PT3QOQ|1.0|First of all, I have this game on my iphone and LOVE it!  I am Lvl 98 and have completed all available quests. The game runs like a dream on the iphone.  No such luck with the kindle fire version. I was never able to get the free cash button to show up/work correctly on this version. Because of this, you would be forced to spend cash to buy bucks to purchase the gun and ax upgrades (pretty much a neccesity in the higher levels). Also, at around level 28 all of my crops/houses reset to more than 200 hours. After waiting the 200 hours, I logged back in to the game and only completed 3 or 4 actions before it happened again, this time reseting everything to 350 hours. After downloading the latest update, I was hopeful for a fix to this annoying glitch. After more than 40 actions nothing has reset and the game appears to be working properly in that regard. However, all of the quests are now auto completing as soon as you click on someone to get a new one. I know this game is free, but save yourself some time and frustration - don't play it!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a very addictive game. i find that anyone who tries it doesn't want to put it down. I am having problems with the more complex levels just because I am not good at these sorts of games.
B0053O89JM|5.0|Having watched Series eight I am left with the feeling that the end of House MD is something of a turning point in my life. I loved the way the writers kept me agonising over Greg House's final act. They even had him holding a baby as though this is the cause of the failures in his life. Not so.<br /><br />It is his one true love who saves him. Wilson must deal with death. House kills himself. I will leave it to you to discover if a pulse remains. An obituary for the character of Greg House would consider his jerkdom having to take him to prison. Society's ultimate sanction. I would say being free brings an inner peace. Solving problems is his reason for living. A place for his wild spirit to anchor its creative talent. Sherlock Holmes indeed.<br /><br />That he has left me simmering over another motorcycle purchase may be a bad ass ending. For me. Now Wilson and House are pain free. The last word in hospital drama.
1595141979|5.0|Final year at St. Vladimir's Academy means novice guardians get their field trials, and for the next six weeks they'll dedicate themselves to protecting a fellow Moroi student. But for Rose Hathaway this is only one of the many troubles she has to deal with. Under lots of stress from the trials sudden fits of anger don't seem that rare for hot headed rose, but when she starts seeing things, Rose thinks the stress is really making her crazy.<br /><br />Keeping secrets to protect her best friend Lissa is also taking a toll on Rose (not that she'd ever admit it). But deep down, Rose knows she'll have to deal with that sooner or later, just as she needs to deal with her feelings for Dimitri. In the end, they can no longer deny what is true, and for once they stop thinking about what is right.<br /><br />I loved Rose in this book. She really is a tough girl! Having just recently lost her best friend has put a new perspective in her. Having her deal with all her issues, plus the on-going guardian trials at the same time I could see how Rose as a character had grown. This book also shows how deeply ingrained is the belief that guardians are expendable, and only the Moroi matter. It was really frustrating having Rose come back to that principle over and over again. At least she accepts that Moroi should fight along guardians, and we get to see some of that in action. I'll just say that Moroi + Guardian = badassness of epic proportions.<br /><br />The end was really heartbreaking. I won't say unexpected for me because idiotically I had gone searching for fanfics and read a spoiler that I didn't know was a spoiler until I finished the book. But if I hadn't read anything I would have been shocked at how things turned out. I think it's for the best though; it makes it all the more exciting for the next book.
0345803493|4.0|I have to say, I enjoyed the 50 shades trilogy but it really whet my appetite to go looking for more erotic fiction. So glad I discovered The Lone Star Lovers series by Delilah Devlin, the His Rules and Too Innocent series by Lyla Sinclair (way hotter than 50 Shades), and for historical erotica lovers - Behaving Badly and Bound and Determined by Debra Glass. Mari Carr, Desiree Holt, Naima Simone, Lora Leigh, Paisley Smith (OMG Nurse Lovette!!) Laurann Dohnner, and Adele Dubois were also authors who penned lush, erotic, steamy sex but with better and unique plots and more well-developed characters. So glad I discovered the world of erotic romance because of this book!!

B001CDD84Y|3.0|This movie could have been really great, but I think it was just too short. There was something missing from this movie.
B004DD3P48|4.0|Eddie Vedder's contribution to this film is huge. From the solo acoustic guitar of \\"Tuolumne\\", to the mandolin featured \\"Rise\\", to the haunting \\"Guaranteed\\", all beautiful. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that it is less than 30 minutes of music.
B002TQ3OBU|4.0|This is the third CD band and always good. This remastered and with bonus CD was quite enriched. There are songs with good to great variations between a more melodic and electronic sounds. There is an electronic boring or repetitive. The tracks \\"The Sky Moves Sideways\\" heads are cars on the CD, but there are two songs that \\"Moonloop\\" and \\"Stars Die\\" are very interesting. The whole set is very good. There are no ugly music in this album.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this is a great app I sometimes will sit there for a hours at a time and do this the one thing is you cant stop playing it. but I do think that it is a great app

B003062NG0|5.0|This CD for those who do not pay attention will find it a collection or former studio. However, the remains are of very good quality and is true even for those who wish to meet the band and indispensable for the fans. In addition, the finishes of the Kscope disks are of very good quality and value the work. It's a quieter album with great tracks. The concise vocal, integrating well with the guitar and keyboard. There is no bad track. So far, this band did not find anything that is bad, annoying, not audible. Excellent!

B0013URJTG|4.0|This CD is more a work of quality of this excellent band. Perhaps you have found a most annoying song of Porcupine Tree which is the second track on the disc, but does not hinder the work. The track \\"Lightbulb Sun\\", \\"The Rest Will Flow\\" and \\"Feel So Low\\" are my favorite songs on this album. The CD has songs with heavy guitars calmer and more variations within the ranges. A concise and mature work of the band. Very good for the fans and those who like a good rock, as well as for those who want to know the band's style.
B0025KVLTW|5.0|The Beatles' 1967 release MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR was the soundtrack to their television film of the same name. Though the television film was famously panned by critics (mostly because it was viewed in black and white, when it was shot in lavish colour), the soundtrack is a great success and contains some of the Beatles' most elegant songs. In \\"I Am the Walrus\\", John Lennon's LSD visions mix with the classic English tradition of nonsense verse. George Harrison's \\"Blue Jay Way\\" turns getting lost in foggy Los Angeles to more universal concerns. McCartney's \\"The Fool on the Hill\\" and \\"Your Mother Should Know\\" are some of the more tempered songs he wrote in the vein that Lennon called \\"Paul's grandmother &lt;expletive deleted>\\".<br /><br />To this CD release are added some earlier songs originally released as singles, \\"Strawberry Fields\\" and its B-side \\"Penny Lane\\" and \\"Baby You're a Rich Man\\". Finally, there's the fanastic live television performance \\"All You Need is Love\\" where a studio audience consisting of some prominent figures of 1960s youth cuture sing along with the Fab Four, who are augmented by piano and string quartet. This final track seems to capture a whole era; I find it especially poignant.<br /><br />After REVOLVER and SGT. PEPPER, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR caps a trilogy of albums that are occasionally overtly psychedelic. On their subsequent efforts, the Beatles would be an outstanding rock band and write many classic songs, but to me something was lost once you couldn't hear the drugs any more.
0525478817|5.0|When you decide to read this book you know you are going to be in for a good cry at some point of the story, but you don't expect the amount of humor and the realness of how the characters face their illness. This isn't your typical star crossed lovers/ sob story about a girl who has cancer and meets a boy, it is far more layered and profound than that.<br /><br />John Green is an amazing writer and this book is proof of his level of insight and the wittiness of his thoughts. I think you have to be very brave in order to write about the subject of cancer in such a realistic way! I've read my fair share of novels about people fighting cancer/ living with cancer, and for some reason most of those books tend to feel corny and unrealistic, maybe because their fight is a little idealized and clean. TFIOS doesn't hold anything back in terms of how people deal with terminal illness taking into account how dealing with death from an early aged changes and forces you to become more mature mixed with the typical thoughts and anxieties of the normal teenager.<br /><br />I really loved this book and recommend that you read with a box of tissues near by if you are as sensitive as I am about the fates of characters. This book will not only make you cry, it will also make you laugh.... You may even choke out a few laugh's in some of the most morose parts due to the spectacular wittiness of Hazel, Augustus and Issac!<br />I guess Dumbledore is always right and his advice can be applied in every literary reality and in the real world too: \\"happiness can be found in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light\\"<br />DFTBA
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Somehow I ended up buying the trilogy and after the first one, was regretting my waste of money. The books are juvenile (Holy cow!),predictable (Oh my!) and completely, totally repetitive. We get the same old sex scene over and over and over plus or minus a detail or two. If you feel compelled to read this book, just buy one - any one will do - and you'll have read it all. Better yet, don't bother.
078322740X|5.0|A cleverly written story that provides an excellent second opinion and overview concerning marriage.<br /><br />Goldie Hawn frames the enchantment that traps Steve Martin, a man already drawn into the concept of marriage by a failed attempt to marry Dana Delaney. Humorously written, the writers create a situation that opens the film with people and situations very far apart and brings it all smoothly together.<br /><br />An excellent comedy that only Goldie Hawn and Steve Martin could execute and a must for fans.
0345803485|1.0|I have heard good reviews about the book so I decided to give it a try. I will admit the first 1/2 of the book was pretty good - but then it started to go downhill... I just skimmed the rest of it - because of the multiple used phases - as previously mentioned in other posts.  The whole thing of role-playing is fine but when you start to physically hit someone - I got so mad that Ana didnt even say anything until a few days later.  Christian is a stupid, mean man, and I suggest anyone that knows a \\"Christian\\" to stay away.  Who cares if he has a gazillion dollars - treating me with respect and love counts for more. I stayed up late tonight to read this and I am bummed that I am not enjoying sleeping right now.  Don't buy it or spend your time with this book.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is one of the greatest games on the aneroid ever. reminds me of super Mario brothers games from when I was a kid
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|there really is nothing bad about this game I think that it will be better with more money to give to players
B007J4T2G8|2.0|First off, I don't believe Ana is a heroine that women should aspire to. She's a self-professed fan of classics like Austen, the Bronte sisters, yet she's this whiny weak woman who's always apologizing for doing what she wants because it makes her man mad. The best book of the whole series was the third one, Fifty Shades Freed because she redeems herself by saying she'd choose her child over him. But she still stayed with the guy do what does this say to young women? You can be opinionated, have your own beliefs and values and do what you, but don't make your man mad because then you'll need to apologize no matter what even if you were right. Not a good example for women at all in my opinion.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|its anpretty good app other that the fact that you have to shut down your kindle to get out of it. but unlike rhose other games there are things you can do without spending real &amp;
0670033693|1.0|So i bought this because of all the glowing reviews AND the television series they are about to make, i love the law and justice, i love mysteries and i love the expansive setting in which this takes place. This is literally more a book about being a bitter washed up old man, and thats it. More time is spent on his love interest and his family and friends than the actual murders and investigation.<br /><br />Where do i start? He is not Cormac Mccarthy so he cannot get away with jumping around and not telling you who is speaking at any given time.<br /><br />The first 100 pages, where the book is supposed to \\"hook\\" you, is the most boring 100 pages ive ever read, two pages are dedicated to the murder and then after that its \\"he went to the bar, he drove his truck, someone asked him about a hunting problem on his land, he is not happy with his relationship with his daughter, he has a native american friend who goes running with him\\" and thats IT. So stupid. The dialogue is not even entertaining or witty, just old man jokes you would expect to see on a 50+ tee shirt fishing trip, horrible book. And i read alot and im not very picky, but this so bad.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|There is absolutely nothing to complain about. It's easy to use. It has virtually every translation you would want available. And, it's free!
0307719219|5.0|\\"Why Nations Fail\\" by Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson (2012). Why I thought this book would be helpful was because I have been thinking these thoughts about my country....i.e. will my country fail?  It seems the entire world is in turmoil and lots of us would like some answers.<br /><br />What I found is a nicely summarized book into the institutional causes of economic success/failure at the national level.  The really cool thing is there are not all these charts and graphs that I remember from college Economics.  With the exception of a Supply and Demand chart, most charts and graphs just confuse me.  The authors attempt to tell their story in a narrative voice.  Quite interesting.  At times it is a little disjointed and there is some repetition, but I do not think it takes away from the overall point.<br /><br />Their point....Expose how governments create various monopolistic businesses to enrich those in favor with their government.  The authors answer the question of why nations fail as a problem of political policy.  All nation's political decisions create either economic institutions that are extractive or inclusive!  Extractive policies reign supreme in countries like North Korea or many of the former British colonies.  Inclusive policies are in place in United Kingdom, USA, South Korea, and Australia.  Extractive nations just take.  Inclusive nations create inclusive economic institutions that enforce property rights, create a level playing field, and encourage investments in new technologies and skills.<br /><br />The authors specifically challenge other theses.  1)  Geography is destiny.  Na.  2)  Culture is destiny.  Sorry no.  Both are explained with the Korea's....geography and culture.....the same.....the result.....one place is hell and the other is full of prosperity.  3) History is destiny.  Wrongo.  Australia was colonized by British convicts.....the dregs of their country.  Flash forward to a vibrant country.  4) Just plain ignorance.  Ha right!  The leaders simply don't know how to make their countries wealthy.  The party elite of most of Africa or say North Korea have lots of money.  Their people don't.  Those in power merely maintain a standard of living exclusively for themselves even at the cost of the extreme suffering of their people.<br /><br />I like the book.  I have a better feel for my country based on Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson's compelling ideas.  From the dawn of time man has moved forward towards a greater standard of living.  It seems the respect for the rights of the many is the key to move forward.........toward a total inclusiveness.  This book is cutting edge right now because there are some major decisions that need to be made.....soon.  The best economics and political science book I have read in 15 years.ight!

I think that any book that makes you feel some kind of emotion whether it makes me laugh or cry, as long as I feel something while reading then that book is a success and I definitely had alot of emotion while reading Dear John. Hope everyone else enjoys it as much as I did.

B007MAETA8|5.0|Well, John Mayer has done it again.  He has completely reimagined what he wants to be as a musician and artist.  Truely remarkable how he changes styles so fluently with each album.<br /><br />For me, this is John Mayer at his absolute best.  Tracks like 'Queen of California', 'Speak for Me', and 'Walt Grace's Submarine Test' will be on playlists for the next 20 years, for me.  They are career defining achievements in my mind.  But the rest of the tracks on the album each have something to hold my attention.  It's hard not to get a little head nod or foot tap going with 'Olivia.'  You'll be singing along to 'Born and Raised' in no time, and a genius move to add the reprise.<br /><br />Overall, each track holds something unique and genuine.  Listening to this album from start to finish will never be an issue for me.<br /><br />I am still holding out for something from the Trio, but if Mayer continues upon this success... well, I will have no problem with that.
B006CBSE86|5.0|I'll admit first and foremost, I had not even heard this band until the release of the single, \\"Nemo\\". So my lack of Tarja exposure may very well be my reason for being able to enjoy this album. I owned Once, skipped over Dark Passion Play, and this is my first album with Annette at vocals. I'll admit my first couple listens were slightly disappointing. At first listen the songs sounded forced, like they were just trying to fill an album, and Annette's vocals reminded me of a six year old girl, but when I actually sat myself down and listened to the album I had myself hooked. Two songs that really grabbed me right off the bat were, \\"I Want My Tears Back\\" with its out-of-the-box bagpipe lead, and \\"The Crow, The Owl, and the Dove\\" Which was just a completely new sound from the band, and really showed Marco's diversity as a vocalist. The more I listened to the album, the more other songs would grab me. Again with Marco, his vocals are a downright powerhouse on \\"Rest Calm\\" and fully loaded with emotion on \\"Ghost River\\" and \\"I Want My Tears Back\\". Annette's biggest highlights are the albums more mellows moments, \\"Slow Love, Slow\\" and \\"Turn Loose the Mermaids\\". The other heavier songs she solo's are ok, but she is really at her element when she duo's with Marco, and they share vocal duty. I guess the big highlight here is, in a word, Marco.
0143036742|5.0|I learned about this book when I was traveling through the Balkans and a fellow traveler was reading it. When I got home I tracked down a copy. Yes on one level its about a slightly mad old man that falls in love with a much younger Ukrainian Gold Digger and his 2 daughters that try keep her away from him.<br />But on another level its about the absurdities of life that a situation like this evolves into. The Ukrainian woman (her name is Valentina) has her own set of rules and names for things (like Crap car). Its all about the clash of cultures. The author uses this without abusing it. Its satire. Some people get it. Some don't. Pity on those that don't.<br />Heavy it ain't. A fun read it is.
0385737955|4.0|Thomas wakes up one day in the middle of a group of strangers.  He has no memories of where he's come from or who he is - just his name and some vague familiarities.  The Maze Runner by James Dashner begins with Thomas waking up in \\"the box\\" having just been delivered to a Glade in the middle of the Maze.  Here, Thomas joins a bunch of other boys, called Gladers, who all found themselves there in much the same way, all trying to survive, all trying to find a way out of the Maze.  While Thomas tries to get his bearings on his new world, he slowly finds out that he's a little different than everyone else.  Not only is he assimilating better, but people in The Glade recognize him, people who have been stung by The Grievers.  Those who are stung are able to retrieve some of the memories they had before coming to The Maze.  And what people remember about Thomas doesn't seem to be good.<br /><br />The Gladers seem to think that their only way out of this world they've been placed in is through solving the Maze.  Every day, boys called Runners go out into the Maze and map its walls, trying desperately to find an exit.  The Maze is filled with dangers, including the Grievers, grotesque monsters that roam the maze at night, and sometimes show up during the day.  And while the walls between the Glade and the Maze have historically closed every night to keep the Grievers out, things start to change after Thomas's arrival. Things change even more when the day after Thomas's arrival, the first ever girl is sent to the Glade in \\"the box.\\" The situation in the Glade deteriorates more and more every day, and somewhere deep inside, Thomas knows what he has to do to get them all out.  Thomas has to become a Runner and help solve the Maze.<br /><br />The book is written in first person from Thomas's point of view and it was really refreshing to read a book from a male perspective.  I loved the complexity given to Thomas's character, how he seems to act altruistically and heroically attimes, but many of the Gladers who were stung and have memories of the world before the Maze seem to think Thomas is the enemy.  It was great to follow Thomas's own self-exploration, questioning what and who he was before he entered the Maze.<br /><br />The plot of the book is expertly paced, creating new twists and turns seemingly at the end of every chapter, pushing the reader through the book at a break-neck speed.  I loved the mystery surrounding the Maze and really the mystery surrounding every character in the book, since most of them don't know who they are or what the world is like outside of the Maze.  The language of the book was also quite clever, as the Gladers have their own dialect and vocabulary which allowed the book to avoid profanity while still getting its point across and capture the realism of teenage boy interaction.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.  It was such an engrossing read, I burned through it in just a couple of days. I loved the characters in the book and the plot was full of suspense.  Much like The Hunger Games, The Maze Runner is full of survival and intensity.  I can't wait to read the sequel, The Scorch Trials!

B001AUAK3G|5.0|I bought the MP3 download of this collection (38 discs) because it was the only version that was remotely affordable ($45.)  I started with Lohengrin, which is just gorgeous, at least the first and third acts. The second is a bit heavy for my taste.<br /><br />I have only one complaint.  At the end of each song, it cuts off the singer's last note in a very unpleasant and startling way.  I have heard WQXR's Operavore do the same thing.  It's really quite disturbing to not hear the overtone of the last note fade naturally.  I don't know the reason for this, except that it seems to be an MP3 characteristic.  Can someone explain it?
B007HO392S|3.0|Hate it when they start dressing up like a prostitute to sell records. Carrie is such a pretty girl. She doesn't have to sell her body to sell records.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have many things to say about this book, and none of them are good.<br />First off, did this author read Twilight before she started writing this series? Average dark haired girl (Anabella(goes by Bella) meet Anastasia (goes by Ana)) living in Washington who is clumsy and finds herself uninteresting yet everyone seems to be in love with her; Flightly/carefree mom who lives in the south and remarries a jock; quiet dad who lives in Washinton and never remarried, but has an unspoken bond with daughter; super handsome/too good to be true man with a secret life falls for average girl and she just can't believe it- Trust me, I could go on with the similarities, but I'm getting tired....<br />Secondly, was this author trying to set a world record for using the same words every other paragraph? Seriously, how many times can you use the term \\"I flushed\\". Use a freaking thesarus. How many eye rolls and referals to \\"inner goddess\\" where there? Where was the editor for this novel?<br />There were many occassions where lack of originality shows in this novel. I am surprised that this series is a #1 seller. There must be some desperate and simple minded people out there to really think that this is anything but average. In fact, if I hadn't read the bio about the author, I would have thought that a teenage girl wrote it.<br />The only thing that this book DID DO for me was make me question the intelligence of my friends that have been raving about it.

B007H9B8FS|4.0|What I really admire about this album is the wide range of the mood and sound of the different songs.  For a hopping, pop song that will stick in your head, \\"Blood for Poppies\\" with its great guitar riffs and Shirley's chorus \\"Ooooh-ooh, oooooh-ooooooh-oooooooh-oooooooooooooooooooooh\\" with stick in your head.  \\"Sugar\\" is downright seductive and sultry.  But the funny thing is, with many of the songs, if you didn't know the words, you get one \\"feel\\", and if you go a level deeper, there's something else going on.  Like in \\"Blood for Poppies\\", where you might feel like dancing to it, if you read about what it's about, war and so forth--well, that's not so much fun.  And \\"Sugar\\" has some dark sentiments to it.  So you can enjoy (or ponder) these songs on multiple levels, just like the layered effect of the music itself.<br /><br />I really enjoy the sentiment of the song \\"Not Your Kind of People\\": for me, like Pink's \\"Raise Your Glass\\", it celebrates those who are not mainstream.  As one of the band members said, \\"celebrate your otherness.\\"<br /><br />Overall, I think this album is not as dark as their first album and is a must-buy for Garbage fans.  And for everyone else who is looking for something fresh beyond the other \\"stuff\\" out there.  I got more out of it by watching their mini-films which gave insight into the songs and also some of the interviews posted on their website and elsewhere.

0525478817|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! It was very well written and constructed. The characters were really real. With most books that I've read, all the characters are flat and boring. But this book is completely different. It felt like everything was real, and right in front of my face. I also NEVER cry with books, but with The Fault In Our Stars, I cried like a baby. John Green is my favorite author and as a young writer, (I'm 15) he makes me want to put more time and effort into my stories and finish them. Amazing read! :)
0345803485|4.0|Seems that everyone I know has this book.  I read it and found it to be very erotic and interesting.
0679409998|5.0|This is a beautiful hardbound edition of a true and timeless classic of Western Literature. A story with great depth, it can be read on several levels: as a tale of horror bred by science, or, at a deeper symbolic level, as an indictment of God the Creator for his abandonment of the Human Race. What is the nature of consciousness, of self-awareness or of life itself? What is the Soul? Does it even exist? What is the Knowledge of Right and Wrong? These are all questions addressed, either directly or obliquely, in the text. I differ with the publisher only in its selection of the dust jacket illustration (bid deal, right?). This is a novel which must be read in the context of its time, the very early 19th century and the dawn of modern science (generation and application of electricity). The dust jacket illustration might lead a reader to assume a much later time. Also, contrary to the impression left by the picture, the story is not about goofy anatomical mistakes. It's not comical, and it's not a farce. The Creature does not have his \\"head on backwards\\" - in any sense of the word. He is born an outcast and learns to hate a Society which hates him merely on sight alone. I made a present of this volume to my niece, a high school student aspiring to a career in fiction, but I judiciously removed the absurd dust jacket before sending it. Great reasons for purchasing this edition are the inclusion of a scholarly introduction, along with a detailed chronology of the author's life bringing attention to other achievements in the literature of the time juxtaposed with contemporaneous world and political events. Burn the dust cover but buy the book. No one's perfect.

B0083GR6Y6|2.0|To begin, the movie depicts wolves in the most sinister manner possible. You hardly see more than a furtive glance of what these animals really look like, instead you will come to believe that they are dark as night in bright daylight with dew dripping from the unseen edges of their faces. Really? Their portrayal is a cliche from some weird cross between Little Red Riding Hood and one of the Jason movies. The general stupidity of most of the characters in the movie rings true in terms of my personal experience with many human interactions, so much so that you might find yourself rooting for the shadowy uber beasts. This is a movie to shout at repeatedly since the characters evidence about as much common sense and intellect as you might expect from participants at a wheelchair race on sand. And the movie pretty much slogs along according to that logic. Only in the last 15 minutes of so (not worth the wait) do the characters rise to any recognizable level of humanity and then it's pretty much a catastrophic bust accompanied by whimpers.<br /><br />Some of the other reviewers seemed impressed by the underlying human struggles or the philosophical questions about life. Fair enough, but these themes are explored with greater depth and in a more rewarding manner in many, many other movies.<br /><br />I wish I had spent my time more productively.
B007RRFUHM|3.0|So, I just heard the US released version of her debut album, it contains several new songs and a couple of remixes. Of the new songs, only one, maybe two, were worth listening to. The remixes of songs from the original album not released int he US were horrible. The only reason I give this album a three star rating instead of a one star rating is because aside from all the 'New for the USA' crap on the album, the rest of the album is still amazing music from the first not released in the USA album. If you are going to spend some money on her music do yourself a favor and just buy on Amazon.com or your favorite importer the original album, save some space on your MP3 player and leave out the made for the USA crap.
B005FWO3QK|5.0|Update: This performance will be released in [[ASIN:B008VNIA32 the Blu-Ray format]] on 30 Oct 2012!<br /><br />---------------------------------<br />The previous reviews by Todd Kay and Joseph Ponessa have eloquently praised the performance and video/audio quality respectively. I am writing this mainly to provide a few additional pieces of information.<br /><br />0. First off, this review applies only to the Kultur release of Barenboim's Bayreuth Ring cycle [[ASIN:B005FWO3QK Wagner: Der Ring des Nibelungen (11 DVD)]]. Warner Classics had previously issued the same performance in [[ASIN:B000QFBW6K Der Ring Des Nibelungen (7 DVD)]] and [[ASIN:B002G1TSBI Ring Des Nibelungen (7 DVD)]].<br /><br />1. If my personal taste is any guide, this is by very far the best musical performance of the ring cycle ever recorded *in video* to date. Daniel Barenboim proves himself a true Wagner conductor (and a true disciple of Wilhelm Furtwängler) with this magnificently intense performance, probably the best in decades. He also picked many fresh voices over the established Wagnerian singers. For example neither Anne Evans nor John Tomlinson is your average Wagner singer. They however deliver their roles with fresh insight. (It's worth noting that Evans and many others in this production had been trained by Reginald Goodall in [[ASIN:B00005LZVY English National Opera's Ring production]] and it shows.) On the theatrical front, Harry Kupfer's probing production can probably share the pantheon with another [[ASIN:B0009F2EPU Bayreuth ring production by Patrice Chéreau]]. At least, these two are my favorite staging of the Ring, with [[ASIN:B0019LZ19O The Copenhagen Ring]] running a distant third. On the surface, Kupfer's unconventional characterization of the characters can seem extreme. However, the inner logic quickly reveals itself (especially on the repeated viewing) and the extremism becomes inevitability.<br /><br />2. This Kultur release has greatly improved the video and audio quality over the preceding ones. I have had mixed feeling about Kultur. On the one hand, I am thankful that the company keeps a lot of music films in print at affordable prices. On the other hand, their DVD post-production work is often subpar. Too often, the company chooses low bitrate processing/encoding to fit the film into less DVD discs. As a  result, grainy video with distorted colors and heavily compressed poor audio quality are almost synonymous to Kultur. Here, however, Kultur surprises us with this very high quality work. According to the booklet, both video and the audio are remastered from the original high definition master tapes. In order to maximize the video/audio quality of this new presentation Kultur decides to spread the opera into 11 discs, with highest bitrates. The improvements in both departments are nothing less than spectacular. Now the video is crystal clear and the sound has stunning depth, both in LPCM and in DTS 5.1 tracks. Even if you own the previous release, the upgrade is well worth it.<br /><br />3. This is an NTSC REGION 0 (ALL REGION) release, not region 1 only as claimed in other reviews. No matter where you are, as long as you own a modern NTSC compatible DVD/BD player you can enjoy the Kultur release of this magnificent performance at a stunning low price of $57.<br /><br />4. For those who don't know: Kultur goofed up in the first release. The LPCM sound track on the second half of Disc 8 was in mono. (That is, Siegfried Act III, Track 11 onward, right after Siegfried's \\"Das ist kein Mann!\\".) Fortunately, it owns up the mistake: Not only was the problem quickly fixed once the company was notified, they also sent out free replacement discs when contacted. (I got my replacement copy promptly.)<br /><br />For all these, my kudos to Kultur. Keep up the good work, Kultur, and don't let the quality slip again.<br /><br />Very highly recommended.
B005JLN9ZI|2.0|Music is great, but the entire track listing and all words on this CD show up in Chinese characters (on computer, xbox, etc). Totally sucks and thinking about returning this item.
0525478817|5.0|*No Spoilers*<br /><br />I preordered this book and went to John Green's signing, so I was left with two copies of the book. I'm so glad I was, though, because I have one to read over and over, and one to circulate between my friends. I really do love this book that much.<br /><br />For me, this book wasn't about dying and death. Don't get me wrong, there was a LOT of discussion about death, but I felt that was more in relation to life itself. And I loved the discussion about death as much as I loved Hazel talking about life--she wonders the same things that I do, and makes the wondering itself less taboo. I think Hazel is a beautiful character. She has quirks and problems and things she likes, and Hazel is consistent throughout the book, even when everything around her is changing.<br /><br />All in all, I thought this book was exciting, beautiful, and above all inspiring. I believe it is a must-read for everyone.<br /><br />DFTBA.

B0073U2F12|3.0|I bought this movie in 3D (not from Amazon) before having seen any reviews, but had second thoughts about it so also rented it from Redbox to watch just in case.  I've seen worse movies, but this one was pretty bad.  Stupid dialogue, overacting, and crap aliens.  I liked the kooky electrician, but he got dead.  (Oops, spoiler alert.)  I also didn't mind the guy with the vest made out of keys; he was interesting, but had stupid dialogue, too.
B000TGJ80S|5.0|This movie is the epitome of a gory chick flick!  It takes a little reality and mixes it in with the story of \\" Dracula\\".  Vlad \\" The Impaler\\" really did fight against the Turks and is still considered amongst some to be a hero rather than the villian that Dracula was extraordinarily loosely based on.  Plus it contains one small piece of the Christian faith, that for whatever was long ago written out of the Bible.<br />  On the outside this movie is about Vlad a.k.a. Dracula, a Christian Knight.  Elizabetha, Vlad's wife kills herself after receiving a false note that he is dead.  Elizabetha is refused a Christian burial because of that.  Vlad now has a serious grudge against god because he believes that god allowed Elizabetha to die.<br />  Centuries later, Jonathan Harker is sent to help Vlad with some work and has heard a little of and believes even less of the rumors circulating about Vlad and his castle.  Vlad takes one look at a picture of Mina, Jonathan's fiance and immediately recognizes her as Elizabetha, reincarnated.  Vlad has the vampires who serve him hold Jonathan hostage while he goes to England for Mina.<br />  Meanwhile in England Mina comes off as a mild and sweet woman who doesn't have a mean or outgoing bone in her body, which is in stark contrast to her best friend Lucy who is outgoing and is trying to choose between 3 different men.  Lucy chooses a lord.  in reality Mina is kind and sweet but definitely a no nonsense type woman who occasionally is prone to a sharp tongue, at least she is when she first meets Vlad who approaches her on the street, looking drastically different than he did in Romania.  Mina apologizes for her rude behavior and goes with Vlad to the movies.  Vlad starts wooing Mina.<br />  During this time Vlad starts to change Lucy in order to slowly get Mina to gratitate to him for comfort.  Soon it becomes evident that Mina is indeed Elizabetha reincarnated because she carries memories and knowledge that has clearly not been gained in her current lifetime.  Lucy starts showing the signs of becoming a vampire, deathly pale skin, etc.  Dr. Abraham Van Helsing is called in to take a look at her and diagnoses her as a vampire.  Lucy supposedly dies, after she is buried, she is staked and her head is cut off.<br />  Jonathan escapes and sends for Mina.  They get married and she sends Vlad a \\" Farewell\\" letter.  Ultimately Mina realizes how much she loves Vlad and goes to him.  Initially he tries to turn her but then refuses.  Mina insists, choosing him over everything else.  Just then Dr. Van Helsing arrives intent on killing Vlad.  He turns into a bunch of rats and escapes.  Vlad makes his trip back to Romania with Dr. Van Helsing, Jonathan, and many others hot on his tail.<br />  They use Mina as a guide through her connection to Vlad she is able to see his route.  Mina change starts to complete itself just as Vlad reaches his castle and the others reach him.  Vlad is stabbed.  Vlad is also willing to give his life to save Mina and in some way Vlad sees that god has indeed brought his true love back to him.  The others, including Dr. Van Helsing see that it is now Mina's task to finish Vlad off.  Vlad makes his peace with god. He and Mina say their goodbyes, for that moment.  The curse is lifted.  Mina becomes human but she doesn't mourn Vlad because she knows that they will be together again and perhaps in some way they were never parted to begin with.<br />  This movie on the outside is a gory horror movie but just underneath that it is a beautiful love story.  Movies like this that contain a lot of blood and guts but underneath are really beautiful love stories I refer to as gory chick flicks.<br />  Reincarnation was originally a part of the Christian faith but it has been edited out in the last 2000 years for whatever reason.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Easy to play yet challenging enough to keep me interested. You can set the game for more then one suit to make it more challenging.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|With this Blu-ray, I have no objection to the grain level, the darkness, the washed-out whites; they all add to the effect and most of these \\"flaws\\" were part of Coppola's and his cinematographer's vision.  I think the film is stunning on Blu-ray; it's like watching it again for the first time, so many details I never noticed before.<br /><br />However, the super-saturated yellows of the film, very much a part of the artistic vision (Willis showed it to Coppola in the dailies after a day of shooting and Coppola loved the colors) I am sad to say I find too much to take for the length of the film.  I do love the golden yellows for about a half hour.  It's beautiful.  But I gotta reluctantly join the crowd who eventually, at some point in the otherwise blissful viewing, have to say, \\"GOSH DAMN THIS IS SO ORANGE I'M GOING TO DIE!\\"<br /><br />The solution is easy.  It also may be seen by some as total heresy to be thumbsed down with all the power of God's own keystroke.  Go into your HD television's manual or advanced manual picture menu and turn down the color.  No, wait!  Don't kill me!  Hear me out.  I'm not saying to make it less yellow in relation to the other colors.  That, I admit, would be a sin.  But just turn all the colors down some.  And look at the result.  If you're like me, you won't want to love it.  It's too close to saying the film made a mistake in it's famous yellowness.  But frankly, with just a litlle desaturation, you can turn this near-radioactive yellowness into one of the most beautiful movies you ever saw.  The relief my eyes felt at the calmer colors relaxed me and I took in so much amazing detail.  After 50+ previous viewings of The Godfather, it was like I finally got to see it in all its glory.  The slightly desaturated, Blu-ray viewing of The Godfather is, in my opinion, the best home-viewing experience ever to be had.  Try it out.  If it doesn't make you feel too dirty, I believe you'll thank me.

B0072GPPNC|3.0|3.5 stars<br /><br />Spielberg makes a Disneyfied war film! That sums this one up. I loved many moments of War Horse; the horse is indeed magnificent, and some of the acting is very good. But holy cow is this overblown.<br /><br />Spielberg is so good at tugging heart strings by now that it often feels manipulative. The overuse of filters and fey lighting effects to evoke precisely the emotion he wants out of you is starting to feel more and more cheesy, never more so than in some scenes here. It's just way too in your face and obvious, without the subtleties that make a truly great film.<br /><br />And nothing is more overblown here than the music, which is by far Williams' most over the top, saccharine score. The man is a genius, no doubt, but you would never hear Herrman or Morricone stooping to such obvious cues as some of these. His music often telegraphs what we're supposed to feel way before the script and actors do, and I hate that sort of manipulation, even from a master. Or perhaps particularly from a master.<br /><br />And while most of the acting is at least solid, the only role that leaps to majestic life, besides the horse's, is Niestrup's. That guy can act! I really felt him, in the close way that Spielberg wants us to feel everyone here. But he's the only guy who underplays enough to compensate for SS's overblown everything else. Very nicely done, sir.<br /><br />All in all, War Horse is 20 or 30 minutes too long, and just too cheesy to be as great as it very clearly wants to be. But, I love its love for animals (though animal and especially horse lovers, be warned: there are more animals killed here than will be comfortable for most), and its heart is certainly in the right place.<br /><br />But while the blu-ray transfer is very fine, there are few extras, mainly a 20-minute interview bit with SS and longtime co-workers, wherein many of them look very uncomfortable and wondering why they have to sit there while Steve coaxes something quotable from them, and, failing that, speaks for them (as they wince mildly, reminding themselves that this is Spielberg after all, and future work with The Master means putting up with such cheese).<br /><br />But then as Monty Python reminds us, blessed are the cheesemakers, and<br />at this point in his career there are no directors of fine dairy cinema who can hold a tallow candle to Steven Spielberg, master manipulator and artisanal cheese purveyor.them, and, failing that, speaks for them (as they wince mildly, reminding themselves that this is Spielberg after all, and future work with The Master means putting up with such cheese).<br /><br />But then as Monty Python reminds us, blessed are the cheesemakers, and<br />at this point in his career there are no directors of fine dairy cinema who can hold a tallow candle to Steven Spielberg, master manipulator and artisanal cheese purveyor.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't write many reviews, but I want to take a moment to tell anyone who is considering buying this great book to just go ahead and do it.<br /><br />First, it's a great bargain, even if you're not going to love it as much as the hundreds of other people, it's still worth the price.<br /><br />Secondly, you know you want to support independent authors publishing on their own in the brave new world of ebooks, right? This is a great place to pitch in and be part of the revolution.<br /><br />Finally, it freaking rocks. Like many people, I couldn't put it down. I read it every spare moment for a week straight through, putting other entertainment on hold. It's a great, classic SF plot -- survivors of a terrestrial cataclysm live underground in giant \\"generation ship\\" silos, when some of them begin to believe they haven't been told the full story. It's told from multiple points of view with strong, believable characters. The chapters are PERFECTLY paced and the writing is crisp, clean and sharp.<br /><br />Just buy it already...

B007O3QC8K|4.0|At the risk of accumulating more \\"not helpful\\" points, I beg to differ about this business of a 'finale' to Bruckner's magnificent - and fully realized sans finale - 9th symphony.<br /><br />First off, let me say that I'm not at all squeamish about 'completions' in general. As some of you may know, I'm very much in favor of presenting Mahler's 10th symphony in pretty much any of the so-called 'performing versions' (Cooke is the safest and least controversial). But I have a huge problem with this proposed finale to Bruckner's 9th: it sounds more like the beginning of a 10th symphony than a finale to the 9th. I hold this opinion regardless of whether what's offered here was penned by Bruckner or not.<br /><br />Much of the material in this finale sounds distinctly more like the 4th and other earlier Bruckner symphonies, than what we hear in the previous three movements. The well recognized major, descending octave jump theme from the first movement doesn't even get hinted at - much less quoted - until a full 19 minutes into this ordeal. Even harmonically speaking, what we hear are a lot of spacy and - at times - dissonant dead ends that seem to have little to do with the previous movements. Worst of all is the coda: a sonic blast in major that sounds as though someone had simply grafted on the ending to the FIRST VERSION of the first movement of Bruckner's 8th symphony - the ending that got deleted in the composer's revision (and frankly, it belongs where it came from because it helps to make far more sense out the remaining movements of the 8th symphony). It's almost as though Bruckner were getting his revenge for having to delete that outburst to begin with.<br /><br />Others - maybe even most - are perfectly welcome to disagree with me. But I feel that Bruckner's 9th is a work of sheer perfection just as it exists. There's not a single superfluous note in those three, perfectly balanced movements. I personally feel that it's a greater work than Mahler's 9th and says pretty much the same thing in a far more succinct manner (and I'm saying that as a huge Mahler buff).<br /><br />What would be to the benefit of the majority would be to call this enterprise what it truly is: \\"Sketches for a Proposed and Possible Finale to the 9th Symphony\\" - that I could except. Better yet, borrow from Schumann by naming this: \\"Overture, Scherzo & Finale for orchestra\\". That would almost be a more accurate description. As a possible first movement to a 10th symphony: sure, no problem. As an alleged completion to the 9th: well, let's just say that it's not for me. My preference for a Brucknerian 'dream experience' would be to perform the \\"Te Deum\\" on the first half of a concert; intermission, and then the existing three movements of the 9th. How could that not be a satisfying and 'closing' experience?<br /><br />As far as the first three movements go, Rattle's Berlin performance is no better, but certainly not much worse, than the previous great recordings of the 9th offered by the Berlin Phil., specifically from jochum and Karajan (less so Barenboim, where his Chicago performances are generally preferred). That's to say nothing of the towering, recorded performances that exist from both the Vienna Phil. and Dresden Staatskapelle. In other words, Rattle's 9th - as a performance - is perfectly functional and in the best sense of the phrase, 'will do'. As usual, EMI's sound isn't the very best, but the Berlin Phil. now possesses a bit more heft in the low brass than in those glory days with Jochum and Karajan.<br /><br />OK advocates of this proposed finale, have a field day and let me have it.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|This date comes from Anchor Bay Entertainment as the official release date for season two both blu-ray and dvd as well as the super cool Zombie head case limited edition. Spoiler alert don't read if you have not seen season 2 can't wait to watch these episodes again from the opening episode when Sophia goes missing ending with Carl being shot, which leads Rick to Hershel's farm to save Carl several episodes in still no sign of Sophia. Finally mid-season the group uncovers the walkers in the barn and start offing them the last walker is Sophia everyone freezes up except Rick who puts her down. Sorry for the spoilers but just wanted to point out how great the writing on this show is and the acting is great also. On to Season 3 and hiding out in the prison on a sad note was a little disappointed to see Dale get taken out, but the Rick and Shane climax was worth the wait.

B007A2O3FO|5.0|I have just finished watching this movie and have thoroughly enjoyed it! If you relish grown-up \\"fairy tales\\" and amiable ghost stories, this movie is for you. The acting is superb and the settings, as in most English period movies, beautiful. I truly recommend it!!!
B007C4ZJ0S|5.0|Holy Smokes! Yahoo!<br /><br />I was somewhat familiar with Gina Carano prior to her film debut and it was already well known she had that unusual combination of being seriously hot in addition to being a serious badass. But this - this is something altogether new. Something amazing.<br /><br />What anorexic Angelina was attempting to capture in her film 'Salt' - Gina actually accomplished in 'Haywire'; profiling the life of a genuine female spec operator. No wires, no cinematic camera tricks, no politically correct faux-empowerment b.s. This is sheer power and a lifetime of martial arts training packaged into a stunning shell of female beauty. A full-on bleeping medieval babe. Hot damn! :-D<br /><br />I can remember when Cynthia Rothrock was the kickass-chick-du-jour of her time and she did an okay job of carrying the titular role of \\"Baddest Babe On The Planet\\". But Gina, whooboy, she's taken that to a completely new level!<br /><br />In this fun action-packed film, Gina plays former Marine and current independent contractor Molly Kane. A hardcore and disciplined warrior whose services are in demand for the same reason that real-life female operators are sought out - that very rare combination of brains, skills and sexuality. Her current assignment: Rescue a kidnapping victim.<br /><br />But is the job what it appears?<br /><br />A well-trod action/adventure made completely fresh by Ms. Carano and her exquisite confluence of bone crushing devastation and sensual lethality. Her wicked beauty and monster skills really drive this well beyond your typical action flick.<br /><br />Altogether fantastic and highly enjoyable - one that I have already purchased for repeat screenings.<br /><br />My fear is that she might have started in films too late. Not sure how long her looks can last in comparison to the types of roles she might take on. But I'm not betting against her.<br /><br />I'm also hoping that Soderbergh considers doing a trilogy - making up to us for his mishandling of the Ocean's trilogy. Would pay big bucks to see another Molly \\"Hatchet\\" Kane film.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is very minor. In the scene when Coblenz, played by Michael Douglas, meets Molly for the first time, he's accompanied by bodyguards that would better suited protecting some silly reality tv starlet. The lack of professionalism shown - they're standing by with their hands in their pockets - is disturbing to say the least and sincerely dangerous at the worst. It's a small mistake by Soderbergh, but one that irked considering how much effort he places toward accuracy in his films.ndling of the Ocean's trilogy.

B005LAIGN2|1.0|I have just rented this movie on cable. Here is the rundown- not a single scene in this \\"historically inspired\\" movie (other than the racism) is remotely accurate. This is Lucasfilm filming the Rebel Alliance fighting the evil Imperial TIE fighters again. the combat scenes aren't even remotely representative of reality: aircrews did not talk to each other the way they do in this movie (training takes over and pilots know what to do- they don't spend half a minute deciding to make a turn so that the wingman can take out the German because in that half a minute the fight will be over and the pilot who is busy thinking sand discussing tactics will be dead), fighter escorts did not abandon bomber formations until the \\"Red Tails\\" showed up.  (Until the P-51 Mustangs appeared on the scene, of course, fighters did not have the range to escort bombers all the way to their targets anyway.) German fighters did not attack bomber formations as a tight group of 10-20 fighters (a nice tight bunch to shoot at ensuring that at least some of the German fighters would be downed by bomber gunners on the pass). In the early part of the movie American P-40s down several ME-109s. This would only have happened if the ME-109s were piloted by the worst pilots in the Luftwaffe and the P-40s were flown by the best American pilots: the ME-109s were faster and more agile by far, and had far superior climbing rates (the P-40 was obsolete before the War began). There is a scene where the inchoate Red Tails destroy a Luftwaffe base. The base looked like something out of the 1960s, not like an aerodrome of WWII. Of course the German pilots are wooden, souless killers devoid of emotion. The Red Tails themselves do not act like officers or even enlistedmen- never do we lose the sense that they are actors as they are devoid of all military bearing. Individual B-17s turn out of formation and head for home with battle damage - not a surer way for the pilot of the B-17 to commit suicide or at least guarantee the loss of aircraft ( a lone B-17 would stand no chance as German fighters had cannon that could shoot at the bommbers beyond the range of the machine guns of the bombers- only by staying in formation and covering each other could the bombers hope to survive their missions).<br /><br />Why couldn't Lucasfilm have taken the truly inspiring story of the Tuskeegee airmen and filmed a movie that reflected the reality of air combat??  This movie makes a mockery of a very important chapter of race relations in America ( the begining of the end of a very sad and disgraceful chpater of American history) I would say it's conection to reality is about the same as Hogan's Heroe  and McHale's Navy- maybe worse because it pretends to be accurate.<br /><br />Advice- buy the DVd very used (under $5 at least) or watch in pay per view- if you really have two hours of your life that you want to waste watching this and feel strongly that you will not resent the fact that you will never get those two hours back!
0312641893|5.0|Cinder is a futuristic sci-fi fairy tale. This book makes you look at Cinderella in a way you never have before. Set in \\"New Beijing\\" the story has stronger ties to the original Chinese Cinderella then the European version. It is an amazing read that you will just love, and never want to put down. It's absolutely part of my personal library along with another incredible read [[ASIN:B007LLLEEC Uncharted]]
0439023521|5.0|The book was both exciting and disturbing. Right now we watch reality TV shows from the safety of our living rooms. In these programs nobody's really hurt. In this book it's a different story. The author takes it to a whole new level where the state sponsored bloodsport is for real.<br /><br />State sponsored bloodsport is not a new concept. In ancient Mayan civilization there was a state sponsored game called pitz, where the loosing team was sacrificed. Similarly in ancient Rome the gladiators participated in bloodsport cheered on by thousands of spectators.<br /><br />Even more recently in our own history in July 1861, during the Civil War, residents of Washington, D.C. picnicked at Bull Run stream at Manassas, Virginia and watched the bloody battle.<br /><br />What is it about our lives that makes us like bloodsport? The average person lives for about 28,000 days 672,000 hours. In that time there's lots of mindless routine, downtime and boredom. Books like this help us to relieve that boredom.<br /><br />If you think The Hunger Games is exciting try reading Writer Interruptus.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0066PQSJA Writer Interruptus and Other Stories]]

0812550706|3.0|With the coming release of the film adaptation in 2013 and all the hype surrounding this book I decided to read Ender's Game. While I found the book enjoyable and worth a read I am a bit surprised that it has such a strong following. Over 2400 5 star reviews for this book seems surprising to me. The book does have an interesting twist, and I really enjoyed the last few chapters in which Ender is trying to deal with the reality of what has happened, but I found the first half of the book to simply be Okay.<br /><br /> I didn't particularly care for the \\"training school angst\\" in part because all of the children (even at 6 years old) act just like adults. I never felt as if these children were children at all. I guess that's partly the point, but OTH they act so adult that it comes off as a bit unrealistic. (I can see them being teenagers, and I suspect that is how it will be adapted on film.)<br /><br />I also found Card's multiple and narration and use of tense very, very off putting. It goes from third person limited, to omniscient to first person and back again often times in just a few paragraphs. I think it even switched from past to present tense a few times -- though I could be wrong on that. Obviously Mr. Card has done this purposefully for a specific reason but I personally found that it tore me out of the story. Though I admit, about half way through the book I got used to it.<br /><br />With that said, I did enjoy the book. It's not a terrible read. I'm very glad I read one of the SF classics. I think Card is a great writer and a story teller but I'm just surprised that this book in particular is as popular as it is. It's a good read. It has some interesting ideas. The twist is very good, but IMO a bit over-hyped. I kind of suspected what was coming and and I was in the ball park, though still surprised. To be fair I did know ahead of time that there is a twist I didn't know what it was and didn't think it had the WOW factor that others felt. I'd give it 31/2 stars if I could which is a solid book, but not something that grabbed me the way other books have.

0307949508|4.0|3.5 stars. As with The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, this book takes quite a while to get going. More than 200 pages in, I was waiting for the action to start, and I got a little irritated with the tedium of the contents of Lisbeth Salander's grocery bags and the furnishings of her new apartment. The story picks up where TGWTDT left off, and once it got going, it was decent. I like Blomkvist and Salander's characters, even if Salander is a little unbelievable at times with regard to her self-preservation capabilities. The pace is not quick, and the mathematician stuff slowed it further (and bored me), but I enjoyed it overall. I'm undecided as to whether I'll read the third in the trilogy.
B007BVOF8E|2.0|Unless you were an aficionado of the spy vs. spy genre fiction routinely found on airport paperback racks in the 70s, I defy you to make sense of the narrative of the 2011 movie version of Tinker Tailor Solder Spy on the very simplest of whodunit levels. Reportedly the press at preview screenings were supplied with cheat sheets. Having seen neither the 1979 BBC mini-series [[ASIN:B005DXCO94 Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy]] nor read the 1974 John LeCarr&eacute; mega-bestseller, I was lost. After a second run through with the English subtitles turned on, I still had to look on Wikipedia for the plot outline, and this remake STILL adds up to a convoluted muddle.<br /><br />Remarkably, Tinker Tailor &c. was the top grossing film in the U.K. for its first three weeks in release. One can only imagine all those Brits had a leg up from the viewing the well-regarded BBC series, or that they intuitively resonate with 1970s Cold War cloak-and-dagger machinations literally hashed out over the tea table, or perhaps the English simply tend to read more spy novels. 21st Century American sensibilities, however, generally lack these advantages, which should not be an impossible feat of cinema to overcome. Period espionage films like The Third Man (1949) by British director Carol Reed continue to pack a powerful punch. This flick, however, is somewhat less thrilling than canned peas, which, appropriately, the cinematography's consistently muted tones closely resemble.<br /><br />The aptly named Hardy and Strong are the sole actors exhibiting any signs of testosterone in the bloodstream. Tinker Tailor comes alive during Tom Hardy's brief scenes wherein he radiates a palpable sense of the extreme jeopardy entailed in playing for high stakes. (In short: this guy has balls.  Hardy would make a really interesting Bond, come to think of it.) Mark Strong similarly emanates an aura of danger and consequence, yet both players are hamstrung by the script's failure to ever delineate neither the stakes nor the consequences.<br /><br />The remainder of the consistently saturnine, mostly male cast are not only as uniformly bland and boring as British cuisine of the period, but appear to be suffering authentic gastro-intestinal consequences, as well. Colin Firth fails to demonstrate a range stretching the full distance from A to B, while Gary Oldman never strays an inch off A. His is definitely a contender for the most everlastingly drab performance outside a Mike Leigh movie in the entire depressing history of the British cinema.the consequences.<br /><br />The remainder of the consistently saturnine, mostly male cast are not only as uniformly bland and boring as British cuisine of the period, but appear to be suffering authentic gastro-intestinal consequences, as well.

0307959856|1.0|This book fails on two levels: as a sequel to \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and as a murder mystery. As a sequel to \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", it fails because the most appealing character in the original, Elizabeth Bennett, is barely present. As a murder mystery, it fails because the clues are sparse and randomly presented.  The solution to the mystery is a deus ex machina that will probably infuriate most readers. The only satisfaction that the book's conclusion provides is the knowledge that Wickham and Lydia will never bother the Darcys or the Bingleys again.

0824835921|5.0|I have purchased this book a few months ago at the insistance of my brother to learn Japanese with him. The japanese culture has always fascinated me and I have always wanted to learn the language. However, a huge mass of people I know in person and through the internet have labeled japanese as a hard language to grasp, especially the kanji. If you are having trouble learning the language or you want to know where to start, then start with this book.<br /><br />It had only taken me 11 chapters to notice that this was the best way to learn kanji and start the japanese language. This book when used in junction with the website and the flash card system, makes learning kanji not only easy... but fun. Its a simple idea where you use your imagination and combine kanji to make new kanji. There are about 2200 kanji in the book, but if you dedicate your time to it, it won't even take 3 months to learn the kanji and 6 months to have them fully memorized to recall.<br /><br />When I say its easy, understand that it will take a little effort. You will have to study a bit and dedicate a lot of time to it. You are learning the meanings of the kanji and how to write them. You do not have to worry about gramnar or pronunciation yet. If you are wondering 'Why Buy This?', the answer is simple. It gets you over the huge and widely believed hugest hurdle of the japanese language. Start here and whevever you go from there is up to your own judgement. It is not an extremely easy process. It is however, not stressful or tedious at all. This is a 5 star product that everyone wishing to learn japanese should own. Whether for beginners or just for refrence, it is s must have in my opionion.<br /><br />-Adversity

B007ZT2Q88|5.0|At last, Iggy has fully realised his long-time intention to record a \\"crooner\\" album...that aspect to his work has been present ever since the debut Stooges album, when Mr Osterberg first deployed his rich, wracked baritone on the acid-rock ballad \\"Ann\\". Perhaps \\"The Idiot\\" was the first Iggy Pop album to really start exploring torch songs, albeit in an experimental, post-Kraftwerk setting.<br /><br />2009's Preliminaires was a very enjoyable first phase of Iggy's foray into French language songs, although that album was rather on the short side. I note that other reviewers feel that Apres could also have been longer, but to me, the length feels just right- most CDs nowadays are way too long, with much filler material. Iggy keeps \\"Apres\\" tight and focused and its length is similar to that of an old-school LP.<br /><br />This album is all about Iggy's voice, and the song order is intelligently sequenced so that the album moves from a breezy start through to a quietly intense finale, with some very fine singing framed by tasteful arrangements.<br /><br />All in all, this album is a triumph; it will upset those who would like Iggy to keep churning out raw rock albums ad infinitum, but for those who appreciate Iggy's more thoughtful, intense side, \\"Apres\\" is an absolute treat.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is such a great story to get lost in! I have a very stressful job and it is so nice to curl up with a wonderful book and get lost in another world! I can't wait for another book of hers, hopefull a 4th!!!!

B004EPZ03Y|5.0|Outstanding!! As a Family movie, it is great!! As a movie in general it is great!!<br /><br />So many subtle references (Barber shop quartet-Nirvana) to cross generational gaps as well as many cameos recognized by young and old (Jack Black, Whoopi Goldberg, Selena Gomez, Neil Patrick Harris). I'm in my mid-twenties and I loved it. Very well done.<br /><br />I also loved that there was Chinese in the movie. I was disappointed that Disney didn't include a complete translation on the blu-ray, considering it is coded for all regions, ABC. I really wish Studios would start including more language options. I know it gets translated into more than just French and Spanish, why not include those other languages? The Smurfs had like 14 different language choices, but I digress.<br /><br />The music is superb!! Sometimes you find songs in musicals that just slow things down, but The Muppets never lost my interest. The songs pulled me further into the movie. Especially loved Me Party and of course the brief Nirvana cover. I had read reviews of the soundtrack and now I see that it truly is a masterpiece.<br /><br />Reviews are right. Not just an awesome family film, but an awesome film. Outstanding movie.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|This movie was excellent, well thought out and well done. I have no idea why it didn't do well. Why is it that people only want explosions now and not good fashioned story?

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Everything else aside, this book is simply BORING! It made me fall asleep both evenings I was trying to read it, and that never happens with good book. It's so poorly written it made me wince. Later, I found out that it was originally a fanfiction. That made a lot of sense.  Now, how on earth did it get published?  I guess who you know is always more important than having real talent.  The only reason I continued turning the pages was because I kept waiting for it to get better.  But nope, I was about 80% in on my Kindle when I couldn't bare it anymore.  I always say you have to be able to find something positive in any situation.  Yes, I let my IQ drop a few points, and yes, I probably lost some brain cells while reading this piece of junk.  But now, to get rid of this bad taste in my mouth, I'm going to find a real book to read. So that next time someone asks me \\"What was the last book you've read?\\", I don't have to be embarrassed about my answer.    Some reviews I really liked are by:    DS from LA  [...]    GadgetChick : [...]    RiverinaRomantics: [...]
B007IX00ZC|5.0|My favorite band of the last ten years. This is an energetic third album from DSO with an even wider range of genre hopping/fusion than prior albums (if that's even possible), still with a strong metal undercurrent. This is the best produced of the three albums, a sonic wonderland from start to finish.<br /><br />If you're already a DSO fan, you will love this album as much as their prior releases. If you've never heard them, their first album is available free and legal on the Internet and gives an ample introduction to the wonderful craziness of this band's music. Their next two albums are absolutely as good or better, and I am guessing you will be coming back to purchase them!
0307730697|5.0|This book is also absolutely amazing. It follows one man (and his family) as he builds his life and himself into something amazing. It is also about war, will, and humanity. It follows Adam Brown from birth to death and tells the world what a great person Adam was - and will continue to be as he obviously lives on in these peoples lives forever. Because this book is about the Afghan war on terror, it is relevant to our lives and the people we know today. I highly recommend reading this novel if you enjoy biographies or war stories.

B0062KMDZ2|5.0|I purchased the 3D Blueray disc of \\"JTTCOTE\\" because I had read that the 3D effects were pretty good. Well, \\"pretty good\\" doesn't begin to describe the viewing experience. I was blown away! I had recently purchased a 70\\" Sharp Aquos 3D HDTV along with a 3D discs of \\"Hugo\\" and \\"Harold and Kumar Christmas\\", both which I saw in the theater and enjoyed. I had never seen \\"JTTCOTE\\" and bought it strictly on others' recommendations. It was a very wise decision. The 3D is nothing short of amazing. And the movie itself is a lot of fun too. It's an ideal family film. It's not too long, about 90 minutes, unlike \\"Hugo\\", which although is a great family film also, with a running time of about 2 hours, younger kids may get restless. Also, this 3D Blueray disc has a great surround sound, which adds to the thrills and excitement. All in all it is the definitive \\"fun\\" movie. Get the family together and have a great time. Or even if your single, like me, get some friends together for an awesome \\"journey\\".

0312576463|1.0|Clearly Franzen's Juvenalian form of satire isn't necessarily going to be to everyone's liking, including my own.  Indeed there's lots here to find faults with; the overlong descriptions of events and places that hold no relevance to the plot, the digressions that truly serve no purpose, the excessive descriptions of surroundings, and the cultural missteps that grated.  Overall I get the points Franzen attempts to make here; that 21st Century America is Balkanizing, that people who previously could relate to each other as neighbors, friends, and lovers now no longer can find any common bonds, and that the society we once understood is now fraying and disintegrating.  The problem is that his characters are so extreme that they border on grotesques, people so un-relatable, so unpleasant, and so hideous that we cannot find any sympathy for them or any relationship to ourselves.  Granted I prefer Horatian satire that is gentler such as Flannery O'Connor where at least I found the characters relatable and the points being made closer to home.  With Franzen there are no redeeming characteristics to the characters made me want to endure the turgid prose that screams out for a editing.  At so many points I could only endure ten to twenty pages at best before crying \\"uncle!\\"  The sheer narcissism of Chapter 3 \\"Free Markets Foster Fair Competition\\", \\"Patty's autobiography\\" is likely meant to be a thinly veiled slap to Boomer egoism, but at 150+ pages it SCREAMED of literary self-indulgence, even if Franzen was trying to make that very point.  In all Franzen comes off as trying too hard, attempting to appeal to literary critics, while at the same time winking to the mass market who largely fail to grasp the larger meaning of what he's attempting to say or, much like Richard Katz in the book, desperately trying to appear to be hip and relevant.<br /><br />In the end \\"Freedom\\" was a burden I felt glad to be relieved of, and perhaps that's Franzen's point.  We aren't really free.  We are tied to each other by bonds of family, love, devotion, desire, greed, and fear of loneliness.  None of us are truly free.  It is also about masks and how we desire to present ourselves to the world and how it is all an eminence front; inside we are nothing like the face we present to the world.  And now for some quibbling about some of Franzen's abject stupidity.  If you're not a cultural historian or aren't going to consult one, don't pretend to know what you're talking about when it comes to Scandinavian culture and societal norms of an earlier era.  Late in the book he speaks of Walter Berglund's grandfather Einer Berglund, and how as the first-born of the family he felt slighted by a younger born brother and left for America.  Clearly Franzen isn't at all familiar with Scandinavian culture and their almost rigid obedience to primogeniture well into the early 20th Century.  Primogeniture held that the oldest son automatically inherited everything and the younger sons were relegated to the military service, the ministry, or manual labor. After that howler of a mistake I had to remind myself to suspend disbelief, this was after all fiction, but that glaring error just kept ringing in my mind.  That coupled with ponderous nature of Franzen's prose made the effort even more tiresome.

I cannot in good faith recommend it to anyone for any reason.We are tied to each other by bonds of family, love, devotion, desire, greed, and fear of loneliness.  None of us are truly free.  It is also about masks and how we desire to present ourselves to the world and how it is all an eminence front; inside we are nothing like the face we present to the world.  And now for some quibbling about some of Franzen's abject stupidity.  If you're not a cultural historian or aren't going to consult one, don't pretend to know what you're talking about when it comes to Scandinavian culture and societal norms of an earlier era.  Late in the book he speaks of Walter Berglund's grandfather Einer Berglund, and how as the first-born of the family he felt slighted by a younger born brother and left for America.

0345803507|5.0|What  Awesome Books!!!! All 3 Of Them, I never read books but these books I could not put down..You have to get all 3 books one is as good as the other..I highly recommmend these books...
B0074VTHKM|5.0|I was first introduced to Theodore Boone when I purchased \\"Theodore Boone:  Kid Lawyer\\" by mistake.  I am a 52 year-old woman and typically do not read children's books. I purchased the book because I read everything written by John Grisham and did not realize it was written for kids.  I decided not return the book and read it instead.  I was so glad of my order error and purposely ordered the next two books in the series.  I immediately fell in love with Theo, his friends and his quirky family.  I love Judge the dog and how important he is to Theo and vice versa.<br /><br />The third installment in the series did not disappoint.  We find Theo is in the unique position of having to defend himself as he is the accused.  Many of the same characters from previous tales return, such as his uncle Ike.  They feel familiar and it is nice to catch up with them.  My favorite part of the book is when Theo defends Miss Petunia in Animal Court.  It's fun that the \\"judge\\" asks Theo what the laws are.  I was a tad disappointed that the mystery regarding a woman's murder has yet to be solved.<br /><br />I love the way Theo respects adults but his thoughts revel his intelligence in how he wants to respond to adults, but out of respects holds his tongue.  He is a very likable kid and it is nice that he doesn't have total disdain for all adults.  He has several role models and has parents who love him and allow him to be a kid while training him to be a good person and responsible adult.  I think this provides lessons for kids who read the books.  His exploits are fun for me and I know kids would enjoy them as well.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for kids and adults as well.  If I had children, I think if would be nice to read them together and have discussions about lessons learned from Theo's adventures.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|This is an excellent series for the fantasy fanatic.  A very complex and riveting world created by G.R.R. Martin. Very hard to put down.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like it but the controls sometimes drive me crazy. -_- fun though! its good for long distance drives and whatnot
B0009P5YXO|5.0|So, here's the low down: it's THE freakin' Sonic Screwdriver from Doctor Who! Same size, same likeness, same sounds; it's pretty awesome. It even retracts and has a light at the tip that glows just like in the show! That's all I wanted. A $20 toy replica of the tool my hero uses in one of my favorite shows. Done deal.<br />But there is one design flaw: it doesn't work as a pen, so throw that idea out of your head. It has pen \\"nubs\\" that are approx 1 inch long that pop into the bottom of the Sonic, but they pop right back out when you attempt to remove the pen cap, and it doesn't really matter anyway because there's zero ink in it. The pen was just an added bonus for me, so I was indifferent when it didn't work. You can also simply remove the pen portion to the toy and continue to play with it (if you're a concerned parent that doesn't want your kid running around with a pointed object), but then it's missing the total, overall, exact look from the TV show. That's why I got some gorilla glue, and just permanently attached the pen nub and cap together so I can have my Sonic Screwdriver from the show.<br />It might annoy some customers that the toy works on call batteries and that you'll have to unscrew a compartment in order to replace them, but guess what..if the toy used AA or AAA sized batteries you'd need a larger sized Sonic to house the batteries and therefore jeopardize the integrity of the toy making it bigger than it should be. There is also a larger button, or cap, disguising the part where the screw is, and it comes off too easily. Gravity wont do it, but whenever you touch it, it falls off. Just toss if it becomes annoying.<br /><br />So there you have it. I love it, even with it's minor flaws. It's not an expensive $100 exact replica made out of metal, it's a plastic $20 toy, but it can still make you feel like the Doctor or one of his companions when your holding it, if only for a fleeting moment.

0525478817|5.0|I love to write. There is no doubt about that. And I definetly wasn't thrilled when my friend gave me a \\"cancer book\\" to read. They are always so depressing. And there is no doubt that this was, but it wasn't the sad parts that inspired me. The beginning parts of Hazel and Augustas falling in love; that's what really got me. It just shows me that maybe one day I can write something half as decent as this. I would be happy with that. I will keep writing, and will always keep John Green's writing in my memory, in hope to be as good as him one day. I recommend \\"The Fault in Our Stars\\" without a doubt; this was most definetly one of the best books I have ever read and maybe the best book I will ever read. I am young, younger then the main characters, but I know an amazing book when I see it. ...an amazing read

0790729628|1.0|It's not my intent to anger anybody. I just want to understand. How did this movie become one of the top ten sci-fi films of all time, according to The Guardian and the American Film Institute?<br /><br />I saw Blade Runner quite recently, and I wanted to like it; I've spent my life writing dystopian sci-fi novels, and my favourite things include detective stories, action movies and Phillip K. Dick. (If you think it's unfair to describe Phil as a \\"thing\\" rather than a person, you might not know that he was turned into an android whose whereabouts are unknown. Seriously.) But the film struck me as superficial, pretentious and dull.<br /><br />You can't make statements like that without backing them up, so I will - but be warned, spoilers follow.<br /><br />There's no question that the filmmakers involved were talented. Ridley Scott directed Alien. David Peoples wrote Twelve Monkeys. Harrison Ford starred in Morning Glory. But evidence of their talents is absent from Blade Runner. The excruciating tension of Alien is missing in action. Ford, whose character arc in Morning Glory was surprisingly nuanced, flatlines here as a prosaic, alcoholic womaniser. (His kissing scenes look a lot like assault.) And the matryoshka-doll of plot twists from 12 Monkeys are nowhere to be found.<br /><br />You could argue that the simplistic plot is not the fault of the filmmakers, since the movie was based on Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep. But you would be wrong - an adaptation should outgrow the source material, not redact it. The plot of DADOES is as follows:<br /><br />\\"In a depopulated world where animals are so revered as to fund an industry of fakes, Rick Deckard is paid to hunt androids who, but for their lack of empathy and short life-span, are identical to humans. Gradually, he realises that humans often lack empathy too, including himself, and he wonders if there is a meaningful difference between his victims and their executioner.\\"<br /><br />Meanwhile, the plot of Blade Runner can be summarised thusly:<br /><br />\\"In futuristic Los Angeles (just like present-day LA, but with flying cars), Rick Deckard is paid to hunt androids who, but for their short life-span, are identical to humans. Later, it turns out he, too, is an android. Credits roll.\\"<br /><br />Opinions differ on how many twists constitutes a plot, but I'm pretty sure \\"one\\" doesn't quite cut it.<br /><br />Critics will argue that the story wasn't the point - Blade Runner was stylistically influential. That's true; The Fifth Element, for example, was probably inspired by it. But Blade Runner wasn't in TIME magazine's list of the 100 \\"most influential\\" movies of all time. It was listed as one the 100 \\"best\\". And there's a reason that \\"style over substance\\" is usually cited as a bad thing.<br /><br />Perhaps I'm not looking deep enough. Perhaps the movie has some symbolic or thematic importance that I'm missing. Is that right, Blade Runner?<br /><br />  Blade Runner: Yes! Like, at the beginning, there's a close-up of an eye, right?<br /><br />  Jack Heath: Uh-huh...<br /><br />  Blade Runner: And then, Deckard's machine focuses on the eyes to tell if someone's an android!<br /><br />  Jack Heath: And then?<br /><br />  Blade Runner: And then an android gouges someone's eyes out! See? Eyes!<br /><br />  Jack Heath: That's great, but it's not really a symbol or a theme. It's just a motif. The phrase \\"See? Eyes!\\" has just as much artistic merit as all that stuff in the movie.<br /><br />  Blade Runner: Okay, well, what about Roy Batty?<br /><br />  Jack Heath: What about him?<br /><br />  Blade Runner: He's Jesus.<br /><br />  Jack Heath: Because he dies at the end?<br /><br />  Blade Runner: Because he sacrifices himself for Deckard, despite being cartoonishly evil up to that point. And he sticks a nail through his hand.<br /><br />  Jack Heath: Why does he do that?<br /><br />  Blade Runner: Because he's Jesus!<br /><br />  Jack Heath: No, I get the symbolic reason, but whydid he think he was doing it? What was his motivation?<br /><br />  Blade Runner: I... uh... did I already mention the eyes?<br /><br />  Jack Heath: You did.<br /><br />  Blade Runner: Listen, I'm sick of your cheek. It doesn't matter if I have proper symbolism. I'm classy. I'm film noir.<br /><br />  Jack Heath: Oh, that genre which is notoriously difficult to define? How convenient.<br /><br />  Blade Runner: Every scene takes place at night. And there's a femme fatale.<br /><br />  Jack Heath: The first thing you said is a plot-hole, and the femme fatale stereotype is about sixty years out of date.<br /><br />  Blade Runner: Cut me some slack! I was made in 1982.<br /><br />  Jack Heath: Oh, sorry; thirty years out of date. You know what we call female villains these days?<br /><br />  Blade Runner: What?<br /><br />  Jack Heath: Villains.<br /><br />It could be that my standards are too high. I've definitely seen worse movies than Blade Runner. But in this instance, I felt betrayed, because Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep was a beautiful novel. It made me chuckle, it made me weep, and most of all, it made me think. There are few things as depressing as watching your favourite characters reduced to action figures, and seeing the philosophy of a book wiped out to make room for special effects.<br /><br />No doubt some readers are keen to inform me that Phillip K. Dick really liked Blade Runner, but in reality, he only saw the trailer. And do you know what else Dick liked? Amphetamines.did he think he was doing it?

B000CQO0WQ|5.0|The Gathering's third album Mandylion is the first with singer Anneke Van Giersbergen. The album does not retain the growls from the first album, nor the more nasal male voice along with the ethereal female voice from [[ASIN:B0011YSZ24 Almost A Dance]]. Instead we get consistent solid vocal work along with the already powerful instrumentation that was on the previous records. The music on this album works best as a whole, with the instruments taking a back seat allowing Anneke to be the focus. The guitars, bass, and drums are not overly difficult and they meld well with one another as well as Anneke. Mandylion was the first step in a long lasting relationship between the band and their new found siren. [[ASIN:B000WHFK6A Nighttime Birds (Deluxe Re-issue)]]continued this evolution of the band and built upon the foundation they created here. I highly recommend the album, The Gathering made powerful female fronted metal long ago that still holds up to this day.

0062068423|4.0|The Redbreast is a fine thriller. Its a quick read but Nesbo was able to develop some depth into his characters. The result is an exciting page-turner with a good dose of reality. Anyone that enjoyed Stieg Larsson's works or that enjoys a pocket thriller will likely enjoy this book.<br /><br />The story evolves around Detective Harry Hole's efforts to discover who is behind the assassinations of old Norwegian soldiers. Even though most of the action happens in present time, Nesbo effectively takes us back in time to the 40s, when these soldiers were fighting in WWII.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app is awesome! I love the 365 plan. If you miss a day in the 365 plan it helps you catch up. It also has a husband and wife bible study. I would give it more stars if that was an option.
0345529057|5.0|Like many I purchased these books after discovering the series through the popular HBO series Game of Thrones. I began reading the first title and was amazed with how well the show has portrayed the books to this point. The first season had little deviation from the books and made it rather difficult to get in to the story already knowing what would happen.<br /><br />The stories are still great though and a good solid read. The set is boxed in a nice little cardboard box that looks nice on a book shelf and are overall a great deal for the price the whole set is compared to individual copies.
B001PA0FFO|3.0|DOUBT is an excellent film taking place entirely in a Catholic school for boys and girls.  The storyline shares a remote similarity with FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF and with Fellini's AMARCORD, in that the viewer is treated to scenes showing innocuous wrong-doings by schoolchildren.  For example, the film DOUBT shows a boy in dance class doing steps to the Mashed Potatoes, when the actual school lesson is to learn the Bossa Nova.  Of course, dancing the Mashed Potatoes when the teacher wants you do dance the Bossa Nova is not much of a wrongdoing.  In another scene, a boy in class gets in trouble because the teacher catches him listening to a transistor radio during history lesson in the Catholic school.  But these things provide a nice counterpoint to the wrongdoing of Meryl Streep, described below.<br /><br />In other scenes, the viewer is treated to a couple of unusually articulate sermons, played by famed actor, Philip Hoffman. One of these sermons concerns the concept of \\"doubt.\\"  In the sermon, Mr. Hoffman takes the example of the assassination of President Kennedy, and he mentions the collective doubt, alienation, and anxiety, shared by most Americans at the time (November 22, 1963).  The sermon then cleverly continues with the concept of doubt, as it applies to personal (non-collective) tragedies, as when a person has contracted a terminal illness, or when a person has lost his best friend.  In a separate clever sermon, by Mr. Hoffman, the topic is rumor-mongering.  This sermon compares rumors to a pillow of feathers that is cut open, resulting in feathers being scattered to the wind. At this point, the viewer might expect the movie DOUBT to develop a positive spin regarding Catholicism and the Catholic church, for example, in the manner so elegantly developed in Mr. Clint Eastwood's movie from 2008, GRAN TORINO.  But in DOUBT, this does not come to pass. The positive spin never occurs.  Instead, what happens is a step-by-step account of a witch-hunt conductedby Meryl Streep against Philip Hoffman.<br /><br />The principal of the Catholic school, played by Meryl Streep, finds evidence that the priest (Philip Hoffman) is engaging in hanky-panky with one of the boys, a 12-year old.  But the \\"evidence\\" is, at best, minimal.  The Meryl Streep character is easy to hate, because she is a very stern nun.  Moreover, she is easy to hate because she uses rumors, innuendos, and self-righteous gossip, in attempt to ruin the career of Philip Hoffman.  Regarding Meryl Streep's willingness to perceive wrongdoing with minimal evidence, the viewer is treated to a scene where Meryl Streep demonstrates how she is able to detect bad behavior of classroom students by looking at their reflection, where the reflection is provided by the glass that covers a photograph of the Pope.  (An amusing aspect of this episode, is that Meryl Streep states that it does not matter that the photo is of a former Pope, as long as a reflection of the classroom students appears in the glass.)  The viewer is treated to further development of this technique, where Meryl Streep's protege, a young nun played by Amy Adams, uses this same reflection technique to catch misbehaving students. When taken out of context, this scene is amusing.  However, this scene is actually a demonstration of Meryl Streep's pernicious willingness to accuse other people based on minimal evidence.  At any rate, Meryl Streep assembles minimal evidence that Philip Hoffman is dilly-dallying with a 12-year old boy, she accuses Mr. Hoffman of dilly-dallying.  As a consequence, he resigns from the Catholic school.  (In this process, Mr. Hoffman accepts a better position at another Catholic school, but this is besides the point.)<br /><br />I only have one complaint about the script.  This is about the ending of the movie. At the end of the movie, the Meryl Streep character expresses self-doubt, feels guilty, and loses composure, because of her own behavior in conducting a witch-hunt against thepriest.  But this does not ring true.  In my opinion, it is not the case that people who conduct witch-hunts ever feel pangs of self-doubt or of guilt.  A better ending, and a more realistic ending, would have been for Meryl Streep to embark on a fresh witch-hunt (Joseph McCarthy-style) against another priest.<br /><br />Why only three stars?  First, the main theme of this movie is unpleasant, that is, innuendos, rumors, and gossip.  This topic does not make a pleasant film. Second, the film deals with a strict, dictatorial nun (Meryl Streep).  This is also not pleasant.  Third, I have a continuing issue with actor Meryl Streep.  I did not like what she did to Dustin Hoffman in KRAMER VERSUS KRAMER, a film from 1979.  She also did THE SAME THING to a farmer in the movie, BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTRY.  To conclude, although the script in DOUBT is flawless, and although the acting is first-rate, I found the movie to be a stinky film.  In my opinion, witch-hunts are stinky, and also, films about witch-hunts are stinky.  It is quite possible that another customer of Amazon.com will find enjoyment in watching 90 minutes of pernicious rumors, innuendos, and gossip.  However, I cannot.  THREE STARS at most.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|DRIVE!<br /><br />There is very little that is necessary to say about this film. It is a masterpiece and if it is not already sitting on your shelf you may very well need to order a copy right this moment to pout there... seriously.... I mean it.

B0061QD7ZM|5.0|What can you say about a Disney movie other then an excellent movie and well re-produced on both DVD & Blue Ray. Have it for many years on VHS but once you have gotten use to DVD it is hard to go back to VHS, for the DVD adds so much more to the color and quality of the movie. This movie is lovely and the music adds another nice dimension to it. You will not be sorry if you purchased this movie.
B001AYENBM|5.0|Really, this ending changes the movie. Without being a spoiler, this should have been the movie ending all along. I like both movie versions, but now I can not go back to the first version. This is one of the better zombie(if you can even really call it that) movies I have seen. If you liked the original version then you owe it to yourself to watch this version. There are subtle changes throughout and of cause the ending is different, it almost makes you feel like you have grown as a viewer or the movie has grown(like a new movie, but the same theme).

B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is a really fun app.  There are many puzzles, likely more than one hundred, which are grouped in levels ranging from simple to difficult.  It is a bit pricey for an app but I won't dock the developers a star for it, as some others have.  I think they will lose sales but that is their concern, not mine.  The game is excellent, both visually and functionally, and it's stable on both the Samsung Tab and the Droid Razer.  That is what I will base my rating on.<br /><br />There are only two shortfalls in the game, in my opinion.  One is beyond the developers control and that is the size of the puzzles.  Harder puzzles have more blocks and on a phone it is nearly impossible to accurately hit the block you want.  You can zoom but it makes the puzzle hard to visualize and I found it to be counter productive.  The second shortfall is a lack of proper instruction.  Play is covered but the shortcuts are not.  For instance, holding your finger on a block for a second will allow you to drag across an entire row.  This is a big deal when the othr option is single clicking every block in a 250 block puzzle.  While that is a common use of the swipe controls on Android it should be covered in the instructions.  If I could dock half a star for this oversight, I would.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Quite a challenging game. Kind of a clash between sudoku and paint by numbers. One of the best FAOTD to date in my opinion for value. Many puzzles take me over an hour to finish(depending on my attention span at the time) but are well worth it in the end. A strong 5/5 from me.

0547569653|4.0|I'm been running for about four years, and hope to complete at least 3 marathons this year.  It's not the runners with the faster marathon or half-marathon times I envy, however.  It is the ultramarathoners, and Scott Jurek has to be one of the best of all time.<br /><br />This book, Eat and Run: My Unlikely Journey to Ultramarathon Greatness, is interesting for a number of reasons.  One, Scott's story is interesting.  He (with Steve Friedman) writes well, albeit with a bit more self-assertion that I'd recommend (but when you are as good as Jurek...?).  Two, as a runner, I appreciate his insights and tips.  There weren't a lot, but I measured my stride length today, and perhaps I need to breath nasally more to conserve water.  And three, it is very interesting to hear his thoughts on nutrition and diet as an elite athlete.  He is vegan, and he shares his philosophy, his eating practices, and his recipes.  I'm ready to try some of these recipes given that I'm usually a vegetarian.<br /><br />I've already recommended this book to others.  If you enjoyed [[ASIN:0307279189 Born to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen]] (which also mentions Jurek), you should enjoy Eat And Run as well.<br /><br />And I'm thinking about a 50K race...

B007MDB71O|4.0|Let me begin by saying that I saw this film several times and I would give it 4 1/2 stars instead of just 4 if I had that option. It is no bomb. A bomb is a film that opens and no one goes to see it. Rather than a bomb, it was a financial disappointment. And that was not because it was a bad movie. It was a good movie, maybe not perfect, but keep in mind this is a film adapted from pulp fiction. It is what it is supposed be, a fun, exciting ride into a land of fierce creatures, cutthroat warriors, wondrous Martian landscapes and a beautiful Martian princess. By now most of you must know the story; a gallant officer, war weary from the Civil war, is mysteriously transported from prospecting in Arizona to the dying planet of mars where he is captured by 12 foot tall 4 armed green men. He eventually gains their trust and befriends their leader- Jedak. Then because of his sense of fairness and gallantry, he rescues and falls in love with a Martian princess. From this point on he is torn between this love and his misplaced desire to return home. This is a love story surrounded by action and adventure. Why it was not marketed this way is a mystery to me. It is also based on a classic novel penned 100 years ago by a revered, ground breaking author. Not much mention of that either in the marketing. Nor that this story inspired the creators of Flash Gordon, Superman, Star Wars, Avatar, and many others.<br />  Some of the critics have blasted the acting and dialog in this film. Ok, this is not Othello, but George Lucas wasn't William Shakespeare and Mark Hamill isn't Laurence Olivier. But we all loved Star Wars anyway. For my part I feel that Lynn Collins was quite good as Deja Thoris and Taylor Kitsch was more than adequate and fulfilled my vision of the John Carter of the books. The dialogue is a little sappy because the director/writer, I believe, tried to stay true to the spirit of Edgar Rice Burroughs writing. Actually, I was surprised at how faithful director, Stanton,was to Princess of Mars. There were changes to be sure. This is always true when Hollywood adapts a book to film. But, compared to many adaptations, this one retains the heart and sole of the original story. Some of the changes I didn't care for that much but others, I feel, were actually helpful. Especially when you consider that this is a century old story that had to be adapted for a 21st century audience.<br />  Back to the \\"bomb\\" label for a minute. This movie did nearly $300,000,000 world wide. (I think it is actually higher than reported because Mojo didn't update its stats internationally after the first 4 weeks or so) It is currently number 8 in world gross for 2012. It is doing extremely well in DVD pre-sales and it has the dubious distinction of being a leader in pirated DVDs. That hardly qualifies it to be labeled a bomb or flop.<br />  If you have not seen this film, you are missing out on a gem. Get it, sit back, relax and take a flyer to a magic world created a century ago by an incredibly imaginative mind. Watch a chivalrous hero fight for the love of a beautiful princess against giant, ferocious green warriors, huge white apes and an army of blood thirsty red martians. This is pulp fiction/syfi-fantasy at its best.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I really love this app! So far I haven't found any glitches! It's like a mix of the pioneers and a build your own vurtual city game. You can gather resorses by chopping down trees, growing plants, shooting animals, and fishing! And the requests are fun to compleat, too. ( :
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love all the games! there are enough different kinds to keep me playing for hours. I like that I can keep getting points by replaying games and that the point system seems appropraite for the difficulty of the game. will be playing for s long time to come
B007OAAK0O|4.0|Although I don't have a home theatre system I found nothing wrong with the video quality on the DVD aside from two very minor glitches that were obviously on the master tape. Other than that I was thrilled to finally have this legendary concert in such great quality.<br /><br />What's not so thrilling as another reviewer mentioned, are Diana's constant attempts to have the audience sing the chorus for her on song after song. It's as though she was getting them to do her job for her for nearly HALF the numbers in the set list. In past performances (think \\"Aquarius/\\"Let the Sunshine In\\" from the Supremes farewell concert) it was cute and endearing, but here it just becomes frustrating and annoying and ruined what probably would have been my favorite moment of the show (\\"Upside Down\\"). As it stands, I think \\"It's My House\\" came off best here, and I think Diana had the audience in the palm of her hand with the upbeat numbers such as this and \\"Mirror Mirror\\". You could tell they were getting restless during the Billie Holliday song and she even chastised them for it!<br /><br />Despite the complaints, for Dianaphiles this is a no-brainer as a MUST-SEE!<br /><br />FOUR STARS.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Pretty fun game.<br />Need a good amount of cash to move forward after initial town building. Otherwise it is a fun game.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it's alright<br />there's plenty of games to play but daring points to unlock them are difficult but I do recommend it because it comes in handy on boring days
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Very clean interface. Smooth transitions between pages and switching between feeds is no problem. And setup was a snap. Great reader.
1439192812|5.0|This book is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I read it two times and then my grandson who is eight years old took it home with<br />him and has read it and is passing it on to my other grandson who is seven years old.  This book is written in a very<br />understandable way that even those that know nothing of science can understand this.  I would recommend this book to<br />teachers of middle school for the kids to enjoy.  Really worth getting!!!!!!<br />Natalie
B004T2QZL8|5.0|great time killer but needs a better hint system and ending. worth at the least getting the lite version and seeing if u like it :)
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a great game.  It has action, makes you use your skills and keeps your interest.  It has many<br />levels.
B006GHA9QQ|1.0|In 2010 I had the privilege of seeing Love Never Dies on stage in London, with Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess.  IT WAS 10x BETTER.  In the australian version: 1) the phantom was not well: yes this man can sing well, but his voice is too baritone to be the phantom, the phantom should have a voice in between tenor and bass since the music has high and low notes.  2) christine sings well and the actress herself is very pretty, but all that make up and that wig make her look like an evil queen.  3) THE PHANTOM HAS NO SCAR! What! Why are they cutting corners?!?! You never see the scar and its not there!  4) I hate their version of The Beauty Underneath.  Not only do they change the music, but the set is made up the most stupid, weird things I've ever seen. 4-armed people in glass cases? Little aliens chasing a T-Rex skeleton? In what world would anyone especially the phantom like that?!?!?!?  5) in the scene after that, the phantom goes into some sort of 'pit of despair', but i won't ruin why, it was WAAAY over done.  6) the phantom should not have a giant picture of christine in his room. Seriously, too creepy.<br />I don't like the plot of the show in either version if you've seen it, you know why.  The music is quite beautiful, especially Til I Hear You Sing, but only if sung by Ramin Karimloo.  It's a pity the show is no longer in London, but believe me, it was much better there.  If you want a taste of that amazing cast I would suggest watching the Phantom Of The Opera 25th Anniversary at the Prince Albert Theater.  It has the same cast that performed in the first Love Never Dies.  I would also suggest buying the originally Love Never Dies CD, to hear a good version of the music.<br />I do appreciate that the Australians produced this musical, but feel it could be improved if casting, make up, and set design were better and more towards the original Phantom Of The Opera.<br />To anyone who reads this please note I am not bad mouthing any of the actors since I know it is not their fault.  All I can say blame-wise that Andrew Lloyd Webber should have gone to oversee this, but again that is not his fault.  I know things are open to interpretation, but this one is just plain off.
B007KDFWRG|4.0|I was really looking forward to this album but was let down as I was with TTB's first album Revelator.  I'm starting to really miss Derek Trucks Band.  Now that Susan has joined the group, it seems like Derek is no longer the band leader and her presence limits the group's versatility.  Because Derek is so talented, he should be the main focus of the band with everyone else supporting him like it was in DTB. Also, DTB played a wide variety of songs ranging from Maki Madni to My Favorite Things but now the songs are sounding very similar and are somewhat boring to me.<br /><br />One of the biggest problems that I have with TTB is that Mike Mattison can now only barely be heard in the backgound vocals. Mike to me is a better singer and is much more versatile than Susan.  I wouldn't mind if Susan's role in the band was more like it was in Already Free (she's good in small doses).<br /><br />Sorry if I'm harsh about Susan but I just miss DTB.
B007R41E8O|5.0|Great puzzle game. Not too short. Challenging puzzles as well as hidden object puzzles. Well worth the 99 cents! So many puzzles that I almost forget that I still have some to do.
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|Would have rated higher but can't turn off countdown mode.  Have never had this problem with Nevosoft games.  Countdowns bug me.  Please fix.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app I got it on my opossum and looker for it on kindle but I found not find it but I finally did
0061122416|4.0|I loved this book. A friend recommended it to me years ago and I finally got around to reading it. It applied to me so much, Personal Legends, etc. I realize that I couldn't start reading it back then because I wasn't ready to. But now my mind can wrap itself around the concepts of Personal Legends, the Soul of the World, etc. Everybody has to read this book at least once in their lifetime.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Great book! I couldn't put it down and I'm thoroughly into the second one now.  The only thing that annoys me is that there are certain words Americans just don't use. So, in my head, Anastasia has a slight British accent.
B004VRL4BM|1.0|Blu ray did not play back on any of my three blu ray players that all have been recently updated with latest firmware software.  Play back was repeated scrolling of copyright statement, no audio and no other video.  Not sure what region this disc was for, but didn't matter since no play back.  What a disappointment as I really love the Primeval series.
B000008HZB|4.0|Yeah, it's synth heavy in spots but imho, this is better than alot of late period ELO stuff. Some of it sounds like Traveling Wilburys type stuff (logically, since this was recorded around the same time as the famed supergroup that incl. lynne,beatle george harrison, bob dylan, tom petty and roy orbison). Synth stuff from the eighties usually seems thin, generic and outdated, however, this album doesn't suffer from that. Jeff is really one of the first pop artists to embrace the synth and utilize it so sucessfully in his compositions. Just loaded this into my mp3 player and can tell it's a keeper.
B0076UXKDG|1.0|It is a shame that this accessory will not be part of my nikon equipment!.. Other reviews are RIGHT to complain the ridiculous price of this grip. It looks like Nikon wants to \\"compensate\\" the competitive price of the D800... I would have paid more for the camera, but I refuse to pay the inflated price for this grip. For us who have been loyal costumers of Nikon this is a let down...
B004KBSQBA|5.0|Must have played this CD near 250 times over the last 25 years, certainly more than any other album by a wide margin. I play it so frequently because it gives me great joy, every time, start to finish. The tracks flow together as a unified whole, each one like a new day on a perfectly enchanting journey, full of complex rhythms, brilliant colors and timeless humanity. It's about as good as music gets.
B007G5O3K0|4.0|This is an about face for Morten Harket. This is the type of music you expected him to make back in 1993 when he first went solo, but he went in a more alternative rock direction instead. I agree with another reviewer here that \\"Out Of My Hands\\" sounds out of time because it is most closely related to 1985's \\"Hunting High And Low\\", 1986's \\"Scoundrel Days\\" and 1988's \\"Stay On These Roads\\". Everything here is layered with lush synthesizer swaths and Morten's angelic vocals--something that was sorely missing from his other four solo albums.<br /><br />\\"Out Of My Hands\\" sounds most like a-ha, and although he attempts to best his former band, what you get is just a nice set of 10 songs. From the soaring \\"Scared Of Heights\\" to the quiet balladry of \\"Quiet\\". Harket even does the Pet Shop Boys \\"Listening\\" justice. There are solids tracks here, but no one track stands out over the rest.<br /><br />In fact, this is what makes \\"Out Of My Hands\\" a bizarre listening experience. It is entertaining and nostalgic, but there is something missing from the proceedings. Many of the songs have melodic hooks, more so than his other four solo outings, but again, there is just something missing from making \\"Out Of My Hands\\" a five star experience.<br /><br />I have been a fan of a-ha since \\"Take On Me\\", and I own all of their albums plus all of Morten Harket's albums as well, and this is a good effort, but it feels a little stiff, a little uninspired, and a little stale. I'm hoping Harket will try again, but why not go with a more experimental producer like Brian Eno. I think that would make a better musical foil for Harket, or even Daniel Lanois. Of course he could always go with Gareth Jones or Stephen Lipson--but it's clear from listening to \\"Out Of My Hands\\" that Harket needs a more inspired producer at the helm. Someone who will push him artistically. That has been the problem with all of Harket's solo works--they all fall short of what he has done with a-ha, but he is such a great singer with a unique voice that you want him to do something really amazing.<br /><br />Here's how \\"Out Of My Hands\\" compares with Harket's former works:<br /><br />a-ha:<br /><br />1985 Hunting High And Low: Five Stars<br />1986 Scoundrel Days: Five Stars<br />1988 Stay On These Roads: Five Stars<br />1990 East Of The Sun West Of The Moon: Five Stars<br />1993 Memorial Beach: Three Stars<br />2000 Minor Earth Major Sky: Four Stars<br />2002 Lifelines: Three and a Half Stars<br />2005 Analogue: Three Stars<br />2009 Foot Of The Mountain: Three and a Half Stars<br /><br />Morten Harket:<br /><br />1993 Poentenes Evangelium: Two and a Half Stars<br />1995 Wild Seed: Four Stars<br />1996 Vogts Villa: Three Stars<br />2008 Letter From Egypt: Three and a Half Stars<br />2012 Out Of My Hands: Four Starsnger with a unique voice that you want him to do something really amazing.<br /><br />Here's how \\"Out Of My Hands\\" compares with Harket's former works:<br /><br />a-ha:<br /><br />1985 Hunting High And Low: Five Stars<br />1986 Scoundrel Days: Five Stars<br />1988 Stay On These Roads: Five Stars<br />1990 East Of The Sun West Of The Moon: Five Stars<br />1993 Memorial Beach: Three Stars<br />2000 Minor Earth Major Sky: Four Stars<br />2002 Lifelines: Three and a Half Stars<br />2005 Analogue: Three Stars<br />2009 Foot Of The Mountain: Three and a Half Stars<br /><br />Morten Harket:<br /><br />1993 Poentenes Evangelium: Two and a Half Stars<br />1995 Wild Seed: Four Stars<br />1996 Vogts Villa: Three Stars<br />2008 Letter From Egypt: Three and a Half Stars<br />2012 Out Of My Hands: Four Stars

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Yes, this review is not a review. Everyone knows now about the mega roller coaster called Hunger Games. And every girl has the dream and excuse now other people standing in her way in the hunger games.<br />Anyway, I am just in the mood of writing today while I hate writing. I just came here to pay my respects to one of the best books of all time.<br />If you haven't read, don't feel outdated, just go read it. It has a personal sense to it. I only read it once, and I like to read books alot. But certain scenes are unforgettably.<br /><br />May this Book be in your favor.
B0083GNOYW|5.0|I have been watching this show for so long, and I still love it. This episode had a nice twist to it, and shows that there are more twists and turns to come! I can't wait to see how it all works out!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I downloaded this book after all the hype and the SNL skit brought it to my attention. let me just say that this book is utter trash. Completey unreadable. The characters are all insufferable, shallow, bland, and just plain creepy. The writing sounds like a 14 year old just got ahold of a thesaurus. I have not found a single redeeming quality to this story. Stephanie Meyer writes better stories, and i hope to never have to type that again.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I downloaded the sample on my Kindle and was hooked. I downloaded all 3 books and read them in 4 days! The story to me is awesome. Maybe because I've never read this kind of erotica before, I don't know.<br /><br />She needs a thesaurus and a better editor. I fell for the storyline.  It wasn't until I read other reviews that I noticed the bad writing. By the third book, I was sick of seeing the word \\"flush \\".<br /><br />Maybe I'm a little pervy, but I loved the story line. That's all I was focused on. I was able to envision the book in my mind as I read. I love books like that! Sydney Sheldon's books do that for me all the time.<br /><br />This book is very sexual. If that's not what you want to read, bypass. If you are willing to look past the overly used descriptive words and the fact that British terminology comes out in a book based in the US,  but want a story that will make you want to jump your husbands bones, this is the book for you!!!! Lol
B0019EXZXU|5.0|Last night's bargain-rack movie was \\"The Bank Job\\" (2-Disc Special Edition) DVD. It was rather interesting and the story involved an actual bank robbery that took place in London in the 70s. The filming was good, as was the sound and the acting. The story was well written and well staged with only a few lapses here and there. I would not term it an action movie, as noted on the DVD cover, but the activity that there is holds your interest and attention.<br /><br />The movie is based on the story of a elaborately-planned bank robbery. The plan was to tunnel into the safe deposit vault of the bank from the basement of an adjacent building over the weekend when the businesses would be mostly closed down. Not all were closed and noise became a problem. The prime intent was the collecting of as much money as possible, but safe deposit boxes contain a lot of things other than money and some of them were documents incriminating the state police and were sought by a different level of city police, so not only was it cops against robbers but cops against cops. The whole thing was rather complicated, which held your interest. The crew involved about five men and a woman and an outside observer to keep a check on things around the exterior of the building. The  woman was a secret plant who was not primarily interested in the money, but was after the documents contained in one of the boxes. Well, a lot of things began to go wrong, as you could probably imagine on an operation of this magnitude. The whole thing became rather complicated after the police thwarted the robbery but were faced with suppressing and outing some of the various documents. Deals were made between the various robbers and the several police units to somehow get everyone out of the whole mess. Be sure to read the notes at the end of the movie as to the ultimate outcome to all the different facets of the story. Good movie. Well done. Thought provoking.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B007BVOEPI|5.0|The series became intoxicating after the first few episodes.  I am looking forward to the next season; I'll probably do a marathon over a weekend to watch Season 2.  By the way, the editing is pretty good meshing the different characters into a seamless presentation.
B00005Q66T|4.0|GHV2 is the second hits package of Madonna's that chronicles the second half of the Material Girl's 25 year plus music career, from the highly controversial Erotica record to 2000's Music. Being a casual fan who's only beginning to explore more of her work now, I'm not bothered by the inclusion of radio edits over the full originals. Although they could've used the video version of Human Nature that obscured the foul language with the sound of a fist hitting a wall rather than playing the first line of the chorus twice.<br /><br />Something that did bother me was the disorganized track listing. Rather than placing the songs in chronological order (like The Immaculate Collection), GHV2's songs are set on shuffle, jumping from one era to the next at random. It made a bit of sense placing the unapologetic answer song Human Nature after the controversial S&M themed Erotica, but not the others. And whose bright idea was it to include Don't Cry For Me Argentina? It doesn't fit with the rest of the tracks to me personally. Well, I guess you can't have it all.<br /><br />However, you will get most of Madonna's greatest highlights from the lush R&B singles from Bedtime Stories and the introspective electronic-based gems from Ray of Light and Music. Plus the 60's go-go flavored Beautiful Stranger from the Austin Powers soundtrack. Sounds great to me.
0307592731|1.0|I am only on page 67 of \\"Wild\\" by Cheryl Strayed and I'm already hoping this book is not a fabrication. Since the \\"Million Little Pieces\\" hoax I can't help wondering if this story is a wee bit exaggerated. Since there is no way to check out her story once she is alone on the PCT how do we really know if all that happened to her really happened? This is preventing me from totally enjoying this read. I'm sorry I bought the book.
B005JABSB6|4.0|I bought two pairs to go with my 60\\" sharp LED 3D TV.  They work fine.  I didn't try it but you can probably fit your prescription glasses underneath.  They're big and comfy and lightweight.  No problem syncing with the tv and buttons work fine.  Only complaint is how they only work if you're staring at the screen.  It's good if you're going to grab some food from the kitchen and dont want to trip in the dark but bad if you're trying to watch tv lying back.  I have to be careful not to lean too far back or the sensor doesn't work and turns off the 3D.<br /><br />P.S. I bought these 3mo ago for $72 and now it's drop under $50 =[  Sucks for me but now they're an even better deal.
0525478817|5.0|This is possibly the best book I have ever read in my life! It is certainly not just a \\"cancer kid book.\\" It is so much more than that! It talks to your soul (I know that sounds weird, but don't let my ineptitude with words stop you from reading this wonderful book!) and takes your heart on a journey that you have never been on before. I highly recommend this book to everyone!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This game is great. I got it as the F A O T D and I absolutely love it. If your a puzzle solver this is the app for you.
0345803485|1.0|This is simply terribly written trash. The content is not what I usually read, but is expected and appropriate. It's the horrid writing that compelled me to write this review (my first). Even for this genre, the writing is simply awful, something I would expect from a 12-year old with a very limited vocabulary.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good game.  Solid performance.  This is the best Solitaire App I've played.  It has a nice flow to the cards.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I had no idea what to expect when I ordered this book, I figured maybe a little naughty. I knew it was a wealthy, good looking older man and a young woman.Well to be exact, It is a young, good looking, very rich and twisted man, with a even  younger virgin woman.<br />That being said WOW. This book is very detailed, explicit,erotic,and then some. It goes there ! so not for everyone.Maybe it should have come with a rating like the movies. This is X for sure.But worth the read.
B002EXMYBY|5.0|Very good action thriller, streaming was excellent by Amazon. Good movie for the price will recommend. Amazon should include more like this in their choices.
B000JJJF4O|5.0|This was a great movie about taking life one day at a time i think and not worrying about rushing things.  I think a lot of people should see this, expecally those who seem to be busy buried in their work.<br /><br />I think this is the problem with so many familys today they are so busy with 100 things to do they lose time for each other and they say oooh if we only had more time, blah blah blah<br /><br />but truth is i think we make time for that which we really care about and thats what matters.  Its not about the big fancy job or how many tasks you can get done in a single day its about family and those you love and spending time with them that matters the most.<br /><br />Dont let life rush you buy take it one day at a time! :-) great creative movie :-).  and the angel of death is right.. that girl was hot :-)
B000PDYVVG|5.0|I'm an elderly lady - 94, and sometimes have insomnia. I ordered \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" on my Kindle reader for a preview, & decided it would be a worthwhile read.  So I ordered it &  read \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\"  in the middle of the nights when I couldn't sleep, and found it interesting & entertaining.  So glad it had a happy ending!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this is very fun and it makes time go by fast. plenty of levels and zombies to kill, I would suggest this all samurai and zombie lovers...
0345803485|2.0|Given all of the hype I expected more. It was neither erotic or compelling reading. It is likely just a well executed \\"rip-off\\" of the public for financial gain. I would recommend that readers NOT buy it. :(
B007G937CQ|5.0|wow  here  is  is,  a  holiday  weekend  in  2012  and  im  writing  a  review  of  the  new  double  live  saxon  audio  cd  set  from  the  fans  choice  setlist  from  the  infamous  wacken  festival  in  germany  saxon  headline  every  few  years,  this  set  is  from  2009  and  it  was  saxons  30th  ann  set  so  this  is  probably  and  just  might  be  the  BEST  LIVE  SAXON  ALBUM  EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,  i  must  admit  eagle  part  one  from  1982  is  hard  to  top  and  eagle  part  two  from  1996  is  another  top  notch  one  and  even  eagle  part  3  from  2006  is  another  monster  live  double  saxon  opus  but  this  show  is  very  special,  we  are  now  at  a  time  in  saxons  33  year  carrere  where  i  think  we  have  enough  live  saxon  albums  out,  there  are  others  like  the  10th  ann  show  from  nottingham  uk  in  1990,  rock  n  roll  gypseys  from  europe  1988  and  that  live  in  the  raw  cd  pete  gil  put  out  about  12  years  ago  wich  is  a  killer  soundboard  show  from  antwerp  belgium  in  1981,  also  dont  forget  the  great  live  dvds  of  the  past  10  years  like  the  chronicals  (  2003)  and  the  to  hell  and  back  again  dvd  (  2007)  wich  covers  a  lot  of  road  footage,  also  i  think  there  is  more  saxon  road  footage  from  the  past  10  years  then  there  ever  was  for  the  first  10,  anyway  yet  another  great  live  outing  saxon  has  released  is  the  donnington  1980  show,  id  love  the  donnington  1982  gig  if  that  was  recorded  as  well,  anyway  this  release  is  what  im  reviewing,  saxon  blow  out  some  of  the  best  classics  and  newer  songs  from  the  00s  and  90s  on  this  great  double  live  cd  set!!!!!!  this  is  pure  saxon  power  at  100%,  let  me  just  fire  off  how  great  songs  like  these  sound  live  on  here  let  me  feel  your  power, lionheart,unleash  the  beast,  ROCK  THE  NATIONS  (  i  am  thrilled  they  brought  that  back)  also  FOREVER  FREE  ( a  very  overlooked  saxon  album  from  1992)  and  still  hearing  hm  thunder  live  well  you  never  get  sick  of  it,  ive  seen  saxon  a  lot  of  times  here  in  new  york  over  the  past  30  years,  i  became  a  fan  in  1981  and  im  still  with  saxon  and  never  left  there  side  even  when  some  of  the  records  where  not  so  good,  this  double  disc  displays  how  around  2004  with  the  release  of  lionheart  saxon  came  back  to  there  oldschool  80s  sound  as  best  they  could!!!!  of  coarse  we  cant  recapture  that  great  80s  production  that  comes  from  analog  but  they  sure  do  there  best  on  there  more  recent  albums,  for  example  in  2011  i  thought call  to  arms  was  a  killer  saxon  album  and  the  best  since  maybe  1997s  unleash  the  beast,  there  was  a  5  dvd  set  of  this  released  only  through  saxons  fanclub  and  i  got  that  as  well  but  the  500  copies  made  are  sold  out  now,  still  if  you  get  the  dvd  of  this  you  will  get  footage  from  the  04,07  and  09  wacken  shows  all  mixed  in  one,  saxon  are  still  all  these  years  on  probably  about  the  best  oldschool  metal  band  out  there  next  to  priest,  maiden, accept,motorhead  and  ac/dc  most  of  the  bands  just  listed  never  tried  to  sell  out  once,  (  sadley  like  saxon  in  the  80s  priest  altered  there  sound  a  bit  and  so  did  accept  in  the  90s)  but  all  bands  are  back  where  they  belong  putting  new  music  out  that  goes  all  the  way  back  to  there  roots,  the  only  bad  thing  with  this  setlist  is  my  favorite  classics  like  to  hell  and  back  again,  sixth  form  girls  and  hungry  years  from  1980  are  not  on  this  setlist,  hey  i  guess  i  cant  have  everything  but  what  i  can  say  is  what  i  started  to  say  at  the  beggining  of  this  review,  i  think  this  may  be  saxons  best  live  album  yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!  weather  you  are  a  diehard  fan  like  me  of  31  years  or  a  newer  saxon  fan  it  does  not  matter,  YOU  WILL  LOVE  THIS  LIVE  OPUS  IF  YOU  LIKE  SAXON  period,  this  album  has  potential  to  become  a  classic  already  and  you  know  what????  i  bet  it  already  is  after  only  2  weeks  on  the  market,  PLAY  THIS  LOUD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B007BVOF8E|4.0|The new \\"Tinker Taylor...\\" is not a bad movie, although it strains to recapture the glory days of John LeCarre's spy genre and the grim gloaming of the Cold War. Gary Oldman is good as George Smiley if not quite as rolypoly as LeCarre's nerdy spy chief. I kind of preferred Alec Guiness in the older versions who actually DID nerdy and owlish very well. When I see Oldman I see an epicene Dracula with fake Korean nailshop glue-ons bemoaning his lost love, Winona Ryder as Lucy Westenra, but hey, that's just me.<br /><br />This Tinker Taylor does capture the intricacy of the LeCarre magnum opus and the sordid infighting of the Cold War, Allen Dulles, James Jesus Angleton, et al., and the characters, notably Colin Firth, give us credible human types. But the film loses continuity somewhere in the middle, failing to explain clearly enough HOW Smiley and Circus came to find there was a mole (Firth) in their midst, and how they ferreted said mole (ok, so now I'm lapsing into subterranean animal metaphors...)from within the Circus.<br /><br />A good movie, considering some of the crap being made these days (including most anything by Tarentino) but not the best homage to LeCarre's brilliance of yore.<br /><br />Rent the movie, but save time to go through it again to figure out what you didn't get the first time. And take lots of plonk as you watch...
B004SYP5WC|4.0|Excellent app. The only thing that annoys me is that I cannot change the notification tone to something more discreet, or even no sound at all. Other than that, it does what it says, and very well too.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Grabbed this as the Free App of the Day and I am really glad that I did. I've been playing almost nonstop since. Some of the puzzles are pretty challenging, so you won't get through them all right away.
0525478817|5.0|This book is one of my favorite books that I have read so far. It made me laugh and cry, and when I finally finished it I was extremely satisfied with how it ended. It is a sad book, but it is also very realistic. It's about two kids with cancer trying to deal with their diagnoses and still be teenagers. Obviously, when you have cancer, not everything ends happily, which is one of the main reasons why I love this book. It is an accurate portrayal of kids with cancer and it is very realistic. Overall, an amazing read, everyone should own and read a copy of this book.
B005HSL626|5.0|Hey for all the the people who gave this app one star or two star or even three, that wasn't very nice. it is a grate injustice for this wonderful app. I love this game so much and its so much fun. and for the people who complained about adds just buy the add free version, its not that hard. anyway, you should get this app trust me. if you don't mind add, if you cant stand adds you might just wanna get the add free one. Thanks I hope I helped you in your choice to get this.
B0054W4JQK|4.0|The start of the book was interesting, then half way through I began to think it was getting predictable and a little boring, but I kept going and the little twist at the end made it for me.
B0053O89JM|5.0|I thought the finale was good but the ending was the best. I was enthralled with the song<br />at the end but cannot find information on the name or who performed it.... I would love<br />to order the song as it sure \\"hits you where you live\\"! If anyone knows please respond.
0345803485|1.0|I tried reading the first book, but just couldn't get through it. I thought the subject matter was just fine, to be honest (having a fondness for erotic literature myself), but it was the writing that stopped me. At one point, i felt like I was reading a teenaged girl's diary...\\"Oh my god! He's SO hot\\" or \\"oh, gosh\\" or the other repetitive descriptions and adjectives. And, of course, referring to her vagina (or groin region) as \\"down there\\"...did not strike me as very sensuous or erotic in the least. It wasn't that the sex was bad in the book, or that it was \\"bad\\" sex (BDSM lifestyle isn't necessarily bad, just extremely kinky), but it was just badly written sex. I mean, there is a difference between describing the sweet, sensual progress of an orgasm, and just writing the word \\"orgasm\\".<br /><br />I actually love erotic and sensuous prose. One writer who does it well that comes to mind is Laurel K. Hamilton in her Anita blake and Meredith Gentry series. Those are very erotic and sensuous books, and the prose is incredibly sexy and evocative. Not so with this book, I'm afraid. And what I feel is ironic...is that the main character is supposed to be a college student who's primary research is the works of Thomas Hardy and Jane Austen, and yet her own writing or descriptions are so pedantic and resemble nothing like the authors she supposedly appreciates, nor even comes close. You would think she would have at least tried to write as good as her literary heroes, something that she would have enjoyed reading herself. But apparently not.<br /><br />I'm glad the author is enjoying tons of success, but I don't pretend to know what the foundation for that success is. Are people simply fascinated by BDSM, which has been around for what seems like forever (does anybody not read the Marquis de Sade anymore...?). Or is the Twilight-like romance/storyline taken to a highly sexualized level?<br /><br />I was trying to figure out why this book bothered me so much in terms of writing and characterization (I'm not bothered in the least by BDSM or sex in general, in fact I welcome it as a reader)...why Anastasia Steele was depicted as so naive and inarticulate. The book really did read like a lovesick teenaged girl's diary. Then I did a little digging on the internet and learned that this book actually began its life as Twilight Fan Fiction called \\"Master of the Universe\\", and the author seemed to just use a Find/Replace function to change Bella Swan into Anastasia Steele, and Edward Cullen into Christian Grey...then it actually started to make sense. Not in a good way, but you can then see how the protagonist really was written as a 16 year lovesick girl in love with an impossibly beautiful and powerful man-boy...and the writer simply changed her age from 16 to 21 to \\"make her legal\\", but never bothered to modify the character herself. Very sad.<br /><br />So I tried to like it (how could you not try with such rave reviews and millions sold, etc), but it did nothing for me except to make me think that I had wasted my money. Which is too bad, because this could have been a great opportunity to show the world what REAL erotic literature is like, and how great it can be. But a book as badly written as this (in my opinion) only makes the genre laughable to the general public (how many daytime shows have celebrity readers laughingly reading aloud from the book...?), which to me, is a real shame.ing and characterization (I'm not bothered in the least by BDSM or sex in general, in fact I welcome it as a reader)...why Anastasia Steele was depicted as so naive and inarticulate.

140053271X|1.0|Very excited to get the NOOK...until I couldn't get on the internet because it conflicted with my Verizon Router.  After hours on line with Verizon and on the phone with Verizon and NOOK support, no luck.  NOOK wanted to send me a new one...but they couldn't find the serial number from this re-seller.  The nightmare continues as NOOK suggested we call them back in 24 hours when a different technician would see the updated network and could probably help me.  ARGH!
B005FITIGO|1.0|As someone who has worked in the environment in which this film is set, I was looking forward to an exciting expose but it is very hard to understand how this film could have received such accolades.  The script is awful. The acting is atrocious in most cases (Jeremy Irons is pathetically mannered, Demi Moore has to be seen to be believed but Kevin Spacy is OK, in spite of the dreadful part), the editing often poor and the pace absolutely deadly. The simplification of the crisis is understandable, if only not to baffle the general public who are unfamiliar with the jargon of the milieu but it has been dummied down to moronic level. If the film making had been dynamic, it would not have been left to the actors to create the tension of this major crisis. Unfortunately, the exposition is so painstakingly and boringly rolled out that the actors are doomed to failure. It was an insurmountable task. Everything about this film says low budget but it starts with that shallow script, reportedly written in 4 days (it shows).<br /><br />The DVD has a few extras of minor interest and the print is good.
0345803485|5.0|I absolutely loved this series! I have never written a book review before, but felt compelled to do so with FSOG. I loved the Twilight Series, though the love story was very juvenile. Hunger Games was just okay for me. This series is very adult and yes very erotic, but again ADULT. It has an powerful love story behind it which is what offsets the intensity of the love scenes for me.<br /><br />I debated whether or not to read this searies because I am not into BDSm, but believe me the love story completely overshadows and will have you wrapped up!
B0077SGMXM|4.0|I find myself trying to get better scores. It has great replay value and I haven't got through the first level yet.
B000NDES9S|5.0|The Very Best of the Doors is a great compilation. I am glad I went for the Import version. The bonus songs on the Import version just add to an already strong collection. The sound is definitely enhanced by the remastered original multitrack recordings, giving greater depth to the songs. There are many best of compilations and box sets available covering the Doors legacy. However, this set is better than most. This set is a must for adoring fans and a great starting point for new ones.
0345803507|5.0|This book was terric it kept you on your toes and could not put it down .I have finished all three and want to read it again.
0385534639|5.0|The Night Circus is only open from dusk to dawn and visitors are enamored with its many tents filled with mysterious wonders, but behind the circus there is something greater going on - a competition between a young woman and a young man who do not know the rules, nor what happens when you win... or lose.<br /><br />I'm so, so glad I decided to read this book, it was absolutely fantastic and I cannot rave about it enough.  It may be of the fantasy genre, but I think there's something in here for everyone...<br /><br />Romance, for a start.  There is such a beautiful love story told in The Night Circus's pages that I'm sure it will be a classic in the future.  It's a romance people will reference like that of Romeo and Juliet, though the fate of our lovers was somewhat different.<br /><br />Magic, is another.  The book contains such a fantastical world filled with magic that you can't help but be sucked into the pages, wishing that this were a real world.  If The Night Circus existed, you would be there every night until it mysteriously vanished for its next destination.  I know I would.  The magical world Erin Morgenstern created within the pages is awe-inspiring.  What caught my attention the most was the ice forest - a tent in which everything is white and made from ice.  I would love to play there.  There were several parts of the book, particularly the descriptions of the rides at the Circus, that filled me with childlike-wonder.<br /><br />Morgenstern is a fabulous writer.  They way she wrote this book was utterly graceful.  The short chapters were so gorgeously written and filled with beautiful detail that I couldn't help turning the page and reading just one more chapter.  I really cannot rave about this book enough!<br /><br />Five stars!  What a glorious novel.  You must give The Night Circus a read; the child inside will thank you.
1932735410|4.0|The lessons format in the book is fantastic. Much easier to follow than what is presented in the pmbok. A lot of reading, but more engaging with this material and format. \\"Exam\\" questions more challenging than in other publications and tools I've used. I wish there were a couple of long practice exams at the end of the book. The only critique I'd pass along is that I disagree with some of the responses and justifications the author stated as correct for the end-of-chapter questions. The rationale for some of the \\"most correct\\" responses seem to be more subjective than objective. however, the book is well worth the money for the engaging material and format alone.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|great entertainment, fun and time killer, only if you have lots of time to give to this game, moonless time, killing time what more can you ask for
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I enjoy this app more than the average puzzle app because it requires more reasoning and logic. It is the kind of app that gives you a feeling of accomplishment to complete each puzzle.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I used this on my trip to France and it was not only accurate it allowed me to plan what to wear and my day trips. I love this and now use it at home to plan my week. This allows me to know what to expect or what the weather could be up to two weeks. Best of all it is updated regularly. And I love the radar what a nice bonus to see where the storms are! And one more thing, I don't have to wait for the stinking commercials to be over to get the weather! Kudos to the developer!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This app is a ton of fun. There are a ton of different puzzles, and they are real brain teasers.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game is ok since there is a twenty word minimum.I am randomly typing this to take up as much space as pssinle- not a word
B00005QF30|5.0|This album is really good. I bought this years ago and I was really busy listening to other albums. Shame on me cause the whole album is good.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|its an alrite game not too exciting and not extremely wake plus its free so no complaints. l.a.b. records squeeze!
B0073XORCY|2.0|Let's be real, the concept was a terrible idea from the beginning. The Gerald Bostock character didn't have anything to do with the actual concept of 'Thick as a Brick'. It was just a fictional character that Ian made up for the songwriting credits and the album's artwork. So this is really a sequel to the artwork of the record more than the actual music.<br /><br />  While Ian Anderson is a great artist, the music here doesn't sound very inspired. More than half of the record is comprised of small variations of the same slow and generic melodies, which turns into a quite boring experience after a while, especially when you make the unavoidable comparison with the 1972 masterpiece. Remember those cool \\"...See there! A Man Is Born, And We Pronounce Him Fit To Fight!...\\" parts, full of energy and creative melodies? Well, don't expect anything like that in this album because you will be very disappointed.<br /><br />  I didn't know if I should give it 2 or 3 stars, I'd give it 2 and a half if I could, because it has a couple of interesting pieces here and there, but not enough to make me want to listen to it again for a long time.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great game. Love to sit and play it when I just need to just have some me time.

I'm so glad it came FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!!! get it!

B005V20JKI|1.0|well if u can get 5 stars on the first level without screaming curse words and wanting to smash ur phone,  ur better than me.. mr experia play gamer.. but whatever.  lag with jumps, hold too long double triple jumps... whatever I cold go on.. random useless characters that don't share the same jumping heights or even close to the same power level. useless characters you wish they didn't put in!?? wtf ever. I hate the game now. can't imagne hating a game more! but like I said u got 5 stars on level 1 without hating it, way to go have fun! grrrr
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I give the Author one star for her effort.  The story was boring.  Using the same adjectives over and over becomes very annoying.  Unfortunitly, I purchased the second book before finishing the first - mistake.  I would recommend one not waste their time or money.
B007IE4DTU|5.0|I finally was able to view the Documentary after receiving the package a few weeks ago. I was simply glued to it. What a job Martin Scorsese and Olivia did with it. Very Nice package for a die-hard Beatles Fan. Some of the Best Music, photos of George and the other Beatles. Very Nice.<br /><br />My favorite line in the entire movie was the last scene when Olivia Harrison was talking about ... ????<br /><br />Thought I was going to give it away, didn't ya??<br /><br />Nope, Get the package and view the entire documentary to get the best, imho, part of the movie which puts George's whole life in perspective. A Masterpiece...
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Addicted from the start.  Love playing it.  Can play at your leisure or for hours.  I definitely recommend the game.
B007L96VCY|5.0|While dissed at the time for being too bubblegum, Macca seems to have had the last laugh.  Yes, some of it does appear childish, but you're talking about Paul the Hit Maker.  The lead song Too Many People is thought to be directed at John Lennon. \\"That was your first mistake/You took your lucky break and broke it in two.\\"  Lennon would reciprocate ten fold, but old friends fight, sometimes in public.  Until this release came out, I never noticed that TMP segues into 3 Legs.  Uncle Albert was the hit the critics hated, but is quickly followed by the Rocker Smile Away.  Other tracks of note on the original are the next 3 (side 2, tracks 1-3 for vinyl adherents).  Alot of sly sexual innuendo is laced throughout.<br /><br />The bonus material consists of 3 former singles, two songs that showed up elsewhere-I think Hey Diddle was on Wings Wild Life-2 instrumentals and an over extended gallop called Rode All Night.  NOTE:Although I bought the hard copy at Amazon, iTunes gives 2 additional tracks with this.  One is a nice live cut of Eat at Home/Smile Away, and the other is a throwaway of Uncle Albert.  If you were around when this came out, you remember the TV special Paul did with this release.  If you got your hands on the bootleg, you'll know that Paul intended this to be a story telling type of record with interjections of 'Now Hear This' between tracks, which thankfully, didn't materialize.  There were also snippets of Ram On with various instrumental backgrounds.<br /><br />All in All, a great mix of an old friend.
B00799L3OM|5.0|Yanni shines on his live CD, more personal than we've heard before.  He spends at least 50% or more of the time playing the piano which I love even more than the electronic keyboards. His band is full of world class musicians with thrilling solos imbedded in Yanni's music.  I was happy to hear again 3 of my favorites:  The End of August, Felitsa, and One Man's Dream.  I also bought the DVD which is excellent but it doesn't beat a live concert which I saw in Moline, Illinois.  Check out his 80-city North American concert schedule and see if Yanni is coming near you.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game I play it every day in the morning at night afternoon even when I cant sleep I really like this game and if I had to rate it out of 10 I would rate it a 20 that's how much tu. I have playing it
B004XVN1T4|2.0|The story is quite dull and predictable. It is clearly an early book and not as well written as later novels. Between 2 to 3 stars.
B00785P2QC|4.0|fun game. Just wish investment point were easier to get and more money at the beginning of the free edition.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I really love this game. its fast and fun with terrific graphics and sound effects. easy to understand and play for a long time
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't think I can say enough nice things about this book, but I'll try.<br /><br />I originally got the first book for free just to try it out and was immediately hooked. I devoured it in one sitting. I tried to borrow the Omnibus, but it was unavailable, so I sprang for the whopping $6 to own it. Best decision I made all week.<br /><br />I am a fan of dystopian fiction, primarily young adult. The story line is sort of dystopian, but it's not typical, and it's certainly not young adult. The characters are great, well-written... you actually *care* about these people.<br /><br />I think Wool will become a Science Fiction classic. I highly recommend it.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I have had a hard time putting this down.  I have really enjoyed seeing the images taking form. Very cool puzzles.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|BluntReview says: Brains are indeed the new sexy...and Sherlock Series Two delivers multiple, err, pleasures...In fact it's a trifecta for the brain endorphin-wise. You get a heaping helping of raw sexy, mystery and intrigue complete with scary bits, and the finale serves up a gut-wrenching thrill. And Sherlock Series Two's three new films dare to step forward into the Doyle Classics; Scandal in Bohemia, Hound of the Baskervilles and The Final Problem.<br /><br />Oh, yes, they went there, and the reworks work. Hell, they've even neatly managed to work in the infamous deerstalker! It's hard to top the phenom the whole production crew brought us in the first myth-shifting series. I mean they had to approach concisely the bromance, the modernization and of course nod to all us Holmesians - with our self-righteous eyes looking for any flaw; complete with the \\"Why I oughttas\\" awaiting. But, worldwide we were quietly awed then thunderously applauding.<br /><br />We are brought back in with, 'A Scandal in Belgravia.' Of course the title is obvious. And the \\"plot\\" is about royalty and scandalous pictures. Normally a yawn, ah, but not here there Johnny. Sherlock (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Watson (Martin Freeman) run around in gloriuos subplot land as the real focus is on one woman - The Woman - Irene Adler (Lara Pulver). All the series of films thus far has attempted to knock you upside the head with how not gay Watson is, but, have left Sherlock up to one's imagination.

B004EPYZSK|5.0|My son pre-ordered this movie and immediately upon recieving it came over and plugged it into my Blu Ray player. I had no idea what the movie was about. Turned out it was about any and everything one wants in an action/adventure/science fiction/western movie. A modern day old style quite simply outstanding thrill ride of a movie.<br />EVERYTHING was outstanding about it and I cannot think of a movie that can beat it as far as providing a visual thrill ride. Simply a great movie and if you havent seen it, dont bother renting it because you will MOST CERTAINLY want to enjoy it again.<br />I bought a copy myself......had to. I just hope that someone can come up with enough money to pay both Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig to make a sequel. I would be the first person to pre-order it AFTER seeing it at the theater.<br />May not be the most fun movie ever made but then again, it might very well be.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is trash.  The writing was terrible, the plot was terrible, don't even bother to read the next 2 books.  Save yourself the anguish.  All these woman out there(my age) in their 40\\"s and 50\\"s are reading this silly story and raving about.  The hardcore sex scenes are few and far between and it is unrealistic and stupid.  An insult to one's intelligence. Zero stars, but i had to rate it to post my review.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think it is a fun game. I think everyone should try it out. I even let my kids play it on my kindle fire.
0345803485|5.0|I purchased Fifty Shades of Grey because of all the hype about it.  Now I know why.  It's a great story between a young innocent woman and a very expierenced, wealthy man.  It is written in the woman's perspective.  She tells about her new feelings that she has never expierenced before, both emotional and physical.  I never read, but this book is great.

0525478817|5.0|John Green is easily my girlfriend and I's favorite author, so when our anniversary lined up almost perfectly with Tour De Nerdfighting I knew exactly what to get her (and why not grab a copy for myself at the same time). Anyway I read bits and pieces of the book when I could, but when I finally got some spare time I found myself up until 4am because I just couldn't put the book down. I have to say, as a 20 year old man, I haven't experienced something that gave me so many feels in a very, very long time. Thank you John Green for an amazing book.<br /><br />Also it looks like the book dropped in price a little bit. *Buys third copy*
B005EGXTEE|5.0|I love The Hunger Games books. It's such a good series, which I refuse to believe is just for teens!!
B007OAAK0O|5.0|Diana Ross proved that she is a supreme performer, no matter the circumstance. She is by far a very entertaining entertainer that knows how to put on a show, come rain or come shine. Central Park was the perfect venue for Ms. Ross and this performance showcased her ability to remain in complete control, even under adverse conditions.<br /><br />This concert DVD should serve as historical evidence, the power of how music can make this place a better place. Thank you Diana Ross for putting on, not one, but two very entertaining shows for everyone that was not lucky enough to be in New York's Central Park in July of 1983.

B007JM4CWY|5.0|I slightly prefer the implementation of griddlers once I got used to it, but this is more intuitive. Make sure you zoom in closely enough that you are touching the square you expect, otherwise this is about as simple as the interface could possibly be.

Very disappointed that they want to charge $4.99 for fonts to make the program useful.

B005LAIHIQ|5.0|First off I am not a fan of the original Dark Shadows, Johnny Depp, Tim Burton or the vampire genre. I would have never went to see this movie if it weren't for two things: 1. My wife begged me to go and 2. Alice Cooper is my Idol. Anywho, I went to this movie expecting nothing, and left very satisfied. Though I am not a fan of most of his movies, I cannot dispute that Johnny Depp (Barnabas Collins)is a fantastic actor. His supporting cast especially Michelle Pfeiffer (Elizabeth Collins Stoddard) , Helena Bonham Carter (Dr. Julia Hoffman) , Chloë Grace Moretz (Carolyn Stoddard) and Jackie Earle Haley (Willie Loomis) are all incredible in their own right. With the ensemble cast and the very good directing (again, though not a fan I cannot dispute Tim Burton's talents)the movie was still about Dark Shadows, something I never ever cared about. Enter Seth Grahame-Smith. The story was silly enough to make me laugh, but interesting enough to keep me engaged throughout the entire movie. Add the fact that I got to hear a couple of Alice Cooper classics and it was a very entertaining two hours. I actually thanked my wife for making me go. I will say I wasn't crazy with the entire final scenario, but all in all I really enjoyed a movie I was expecting to hate. I would highly recommend this movie and it has also peaked my interest in the original series.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is great. its addicting and appropriate for all age groups. granted it may have flaws but every game does.

B004O3YGMC|4.0|This app is a godsend if there is no computer around with which to remotely connect.  It's horribly slow with 3g connection, and next to impossible to use if you are in a moving vehicle, but that's not the fault of the app. You will need a wifi or 4g connection if you want to use this app without pulling your hair out. It does a great job for the price though.  If you own stock in gotomypc, be afraid. Be very afraid!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|The puzzles are fun and a good logic workout.<br /><br />I would like to be able to turn off the \\"x\\" blocks with an option. Turning a block on or off is enough to complete the puzzles if you know what you are doing.
B000SLP4SE|4.0|I watched two movies tonight, one a big budget actioner, and Shooter.  I far prefer Shooter.  This movie did something the other didn't - it made me care about the protagonist.  It also made me rail at human greed and avarice, but that's another story.  I liked this movie, and I think that Mark Wahlberg did an excellent job with the role.  I will definitely watch this one again.
0061928356|4.0|Canadian first-time author Shilpi Somaya Gowda has written a compelling story that had me from the beginning. Born in Toronto, Canada, to parents from Bombay, India, she had insight and good understanding of both cultures. She mostly told the story from the perspective of three women - the adopted daughter, the adoptive mother and the birth mother. It was involved and interesting and hard to put down once I started reading.<br /><br />I don't want to give away too much and spoil it for you, but for anyone who has adopted from another country, or is thinking about it, this book gives a different view of some of the things to take into consideration.<br /><br />The characters are well-developed, their life situations are convincing and detailed, and the reader gets to share in the story of their lives over a span of twenty-five years. It was easy to care about them. In fact, I experienced a range of emotions as I read this international bestseller.<br /><br />I liked how the author headed her chapters with not only the title, but also the location, date, and name of the person the reader was visiting in that chapter. Each chapter is only a few pages long which made it easy to read when having only a few minutes. It also helped the reader get oriented right from the start and occasionally helped the author step over a span of several years to move along in the story. It was well done.<br /><br />The only thing I did not like is the way the author chose to end this novel, although it is quite believable the way it happened. Obviously the ending did not interfere with the book's success. Even so, if you are one who likes to read the end of a book first ... in this case DON'T!  Please, do yourself the favour of not peeking. It is well worth the wait.<br /><br />There has been criticism that the author ignored or changed some things about the culture of India to fit her story, but I don't agree. In a couple of places I had questions, too, but since I have never studied their culture nor have I visited that country, I accepted that perhaps it was something that is changing there with the times. I believed the author would know that, so I didn't let my lack of information get in the way of a great read.ir culture nor have I visited that country, I accepted that perhaps it was something that is changing there with the times.

B004EPYZUS|2.0|I streamed the movie, looking for lots of action and minimal plot.  And that's exactly what I got.  However, I never came to care about any of the other characters, so I found the movie to be lacking.  I quite like Jeremy Renner, so I thought I would like this, but I could never really get involved or feel anything for any of the characters.  The one sequence that made me uncomfortable, involved my fear of heights.  But it really is a total Tom Cruise movie, and I mean that in the worst possible way.  I never felt like I was watching Ethan Hunt and his team.  I say 'his team', because even after watching the movie, I have no idea what anyone else's character was named (except Cobalt - don't ask me the character's actual name).  I felt like I was watching Tom Cruise stroke his ego. Granted, the plot wasn't exactly well-written or developed, going from one set-piece to another with nary a break to feel anything, but it wasn't like I was expecting intricate plotting. But I did want to feel some sort of tension or concern for the good guys, and that was strangely missing.
B008578PRK|5.0|Nice period piece. Good costumes. Steam punk horror. Nice build up of spooky. Overall a good horror movie. Don't think my wife will sleep for a week.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|Love the puzzles. Very original and fun. Lots of levels for a challenge. My only complaint is that its sometimes hard to get the right box clicked. A stylus might help.
0345803485|5.0|I loved these books.  I am not into BDSM, but I don't feel that is what these books are REALLY about anyway.  People have made such a big deal about the sexual aspect of the trilogy, but for me, it was much more about the characters, especially Christian.  I could not put the books down.  I read all 3 in as many days.
0446572993|4.0|Assassin with a soft side?!  Can he protect the young girl?  Makes for a great read.  Another Baldacci top-notch thriller.  You won't be disappointed.

B000FC13E0|5.0|This is a quick fun read, piquing your interest right from the start with  mysterious events.<br /><br />If you enjoy science, particularly the outer ambit of science, technology, and biology, this book is for you!  I was absolutely delighted by the author's descriptions of the nano-particles, how they developed self awareness, and ultimately evolved beyond their programming.
B001B2CPH2|3.0|This movie will definitely make you cry at the end. But honestly when Patrick Swayze goes into Whoopi Goldberg's body to dance with Demi Moore, I really really wish that Demi would have opened her eyes or we could have had some lesbian kissing with Demi and Whoopi, because really - how weird and awesome would that be?!
B007JM4CWY|4.0|I absolutely love this game! However I'm stuck on level 2.16. I don't know where to start. I've searched all over the Internet and cannot find any type of solution to the puzzle or any place that gives hints or walkthroughs. It'd be nice if there was a convenient place to find hints on where to start if your stuck. Not asking for a full solution, just a helpful push in the right direction.
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|This movie is great. It might not be what you expect, but if you're looking for Liam Neeson having fist fights with wolves, it's better than what you expect. If you're a lughead who only likes insipid action like in Transformers or some such trash, then you won't like this.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I downloaded the free version and it worked fine...got tired of the ads so I bought and downloaded the upgrade. it continually asks for my email password and when I enter it it doesn't recognize it.  no problem right? just email yourself the password RIGHT? WRONG!! I requested my password no less than 7 times and never received it.  now ive paid for a game I cant play.  don't bother with this...save your money and go elsewhere.
B001IF252M|5.0|I have a Dell XPS 15 L502X laptop which only has a Mini DisplayPort.  I often use my laptop for presentations and so I needed a Mini DisplayPort to VGA adapter to be able to connect to most overhead projectors.<br /><br />Initially, I made the terrible mistake of purchasing the lower cost Cables 99 [[ASIN:B002HU39BS Mini Displayport to VGA Cable Adapter for Apple Macbook, Macbook Pro, iMac, Macbook Air, and Mac Mini]].  The Cables 99 adapter cost less, but resulted in noisy images, regardless of the display device which was connected to my computer.  In contrast, this Apple adapter worked right out of the box and produced sharp images.<br /><br />I have been very pleased with the Apple Mini DisplayPort to VGA Adapter and highly recommend it despite the higher cost than the knock off adapters.  The images are sharp and it has worked flawlessly.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Great fun for<br />the kids and adults in all of us. This game is addictive.<br />My son has been  fighting with me for a chance to play the game eversince he suggested i down load the game. So far, i have been able to keep him from stealing it from me.

B0050DIWFC|3.0|While I enjoyed this book, there were some things that bothered me about it.  A young boy is killed and the district attorney's son is accused of the crime.  While mom seems to pick up on some of the clues that point to her son's guilt, dad is oblivious - going to any length to prove his innocence.  There were times when I thought I was reading a Jodi Piccoult novel.  There are lots of twists and turns in this book - some expected, some not. For the most part, it was a pretty good read.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|fun game just like Mario games. good graphics. good for little ones too. recommend for all ages. just like super Mario brothers
B003YFIUW8|3.0|Our book club was somewhat divided on this book.  While we all found it an interesting read and a good book for discussion, there were some things that bothered us about it.  While we understood the reaoning behind the way Jack spoke , it was hard to believe that with a tv and his mother to listen to that he would speak that way.  We found it sometimes hard to read because of this.  However I would not wish to discourage anyone from reading this book.  The author does a good job of creating a \\"world within a room\\" and makes readers think about what would happen when you are taken from the only environment you have ever known and thrown into the \\"real\\" world.
B005636HPS|3.0|These guys are fun and up lifting. Amazons exclusive is censored. Wishing I would have known that before purchasing. I believe in freedom of speech and censorship is over rated. I want to hear music in its true form.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This was the first book chosen by our newly organized book club.  While several of us were confused in the beginning with the shifting back and forth between characters and their stories, we soon learned the significance of the author's reasons for doing so.  While often this story seemed to be tragic, we felt that the book as a whole was more of a love story.  As former teachers, we gave it an \\"A\\" and highly recommend it to any one considering reading it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in recent years.  Its refreshing to see a villain who's motive is actually belivable, at the same time as having likable, and very human heroes.
0385344228|3.0|This courtroom drama was  well written for the first 4/5s of the book.  I found the ending a bit confusing and also uneven.  There were points toward the end I felt the author presented a multiple choice ending. Stop here? No, here?  I never, really, quite, \\"got\\" the characters.  The wife, Laurie, was very confusing to me as a woman.  Ex. Why would she not want her parents with her during such a harrowing time?  The writer did a very good job of explaining courtroom procedure, perhaps, a bit too pedantic. But I did learn a bit about DNA......But,  too many loose ends, red herrings and unanswered questions.  Too many endings, could have 2  or 3 books.<br /><br />Basically, I did enjoy the book and feel it makes for a good read for those who enjoy courtroom drama.<br /><br />A long time ago I saw a movie entitled, The Bad Seed, it seemed imaginary at the time.  This book made me think of it again
B006JTS5OO|3.0|This is a great movie. Beware however that the digital copy can only be downloaded in the USA or Canada. If you do not live in one of these countries you will not be able to download the digital copy, so just buy the regular DVD instead.
B007MAETA8|5.0|I gave John's last album \\"Battle Studies\\" a listen after watching him on the Ellen Show in Dec 2009. By the end of January 2010, I had purchased all of his albums and dvds. I consider myself now to be a Mayeraniac. Like the rest of his fans, I eagerly waited for new music from John. When \\"Shadow Days\\" was released, I think for me it was a bit of heaven. I feel I contacted a local radio station so much by email, that they began to play it and now they play it alot. When I got to listen to \\"Born and Raised\\" for free for days..well let's just say I really really listened to it. I can't remember the last album that I've listened to that I must hear the entire album every time. I'm a big Crosby Stills Nash fan, so when I heard the title track of this album..I went off into a \\"Southern Cross\\" daze. I'm amazed at a review that this album doesn't have guitar playing in it. I think the reviewer was listening to another album. Every song has John doing what he does best. I do have favorite songs from the album, but feel I have not listened to the others any less. I enjoyed all of John's release promotion interviews here & there. I love his sense of humor about things and how well he's dealing with his throat issue. I love the way his voice sounds on this album and if he felt pain putting it together, then his pain was not in vain. Thanks John.
015206396X|2.0|Rating: 2.5 stars<br /><br />One land. Seven kingdoms. Graced people.<br /><br />Not everyone is Graced and those who are, are feared by all no matter his or her particular ability. Most are innocent enough, Graced with cooking or something else benign. But Katsa is Graced with killing. She can kill with her bare hands and any weapon. People fear her and her uncle, the king of the Middluns, uses her to strong arm his subjects. Every time Katsa's conscience threatens to compromise a mission, she dismisses it because a killer like her can not feel or judge, but solely obey.<br /><br />That is, until she meets Prince Po of Leinid, who is Graced with superior fighting skills. Knowing Po changes Katsa and she ends up leading a rescue mission that also brings with it self-discovery and the knowledge of a dangerous secret that could destroy all of the kingdoms.<br /><br />I really do not have much to say about Graceling. I have very few notes on it. I was indifferent to it for the majority of the book. I liked Po and Raffin (Katsa's cousin) well enough, but Katsa was really hard to relate to (though to be fair, it was probably intended that way).<br /><br />I found the idea of Graces quite interesting. Graced people were physically marked by heterochromatic eyes and the various Graces were crosses between extreme talent and power. Some Graced people seemed to get the short end of the stick when it came to Graces though.<br /><br />Graceling became way more exciting for me during the last one hundred and fifty pages or so and I finally felt connected during those pages. I just with it had been like that for the whole book.<br /><br />Recommended for fantasy lovers fourteen and up who are patient enough to hold on until the good stuff happens.<br /><br />Google \\"The Musings of ALMYBNENR\\" to see this review in its original format and to follow my book review blog.<br /><br />Please note: Whatever I rate a book here, please check what the ratings mean on Goodreads, because those are what I go by.se are what I go by.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love the game. Im almost always disappointed with the games you get to crest a zoo or vilage but this totally rocks. my favorite part is to watch scratt in his movie. you don't half to buy money in the game to not be broke. I love it
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I don't usually read many books, but this one was pretty interesting for my taste. It has many details of what she sees and smell, which makes me also see it in my own mind. I wish the author can make more sequels about Katniss and Peeta together after the war. I like the romantic part. It will be interesting to know how their lives will be after the war. Katniss seems like she never realized that she loves Peeta. Like I said, they should be a small sequel about their personal lives. I love the way Peeta cares about her. Great book!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Absolutely the best TV show ever.  Cant wait for season 2 to end so i can buy it.  I loved it and highly recommend it.  If u only watch 1 show a year has to be this 1
B007C3TVEY|5.0|We Need to Talk About Kevin, based on the novel by Lionel Shriver, is more startling and horrifying than any modern horror film from any recent year, despite being categorized as a drama. I hope I'm not spoiling anything by saying that the story shares narrow similarities with another 2011 drama called Beautiful Boy, a film that showed parents dealing with grief and guilt after their son massacres his school. I expected the two films to be similar, but all similarities stop there. While Beautiful Boy was a gentle, powerful film, it doesn't hold a candle to the psychological trauma delivered by this; it's less glossy and almost immediately more affecting. This is the third film by Scottish film director Lynne Ramsay, who has met with acclaim for her previous films but has never made a film with this much impact on critics and audiences. We Need to Talk About Kevin is still far from being widely seen, but you'll gather from the reviews that those who have seen it have struggled to shake it from their mind. This is not an easy film to watch, but it's unforgettable once you have.<br /><br />Promotional materials, reviews, and synopses have made no secret that Kevin will ultimately commit a massacre at his school, yet this still feels like a minor spoiler. Even if you're aware of this, you won't be prepared for exactly what happens and I urge you to avoid anything that fully discloses the details. The film unfolds with a fragmented timeline, all over the place in terms of chronology. When we first meet Eva (Tilda Swinton), her home and car have been vandalized with red paint. Her neighbors and nearly everyone she encounters are cold to her, if not outright vitriolic. She's assaulted by a random woman on the street only minutes after getting a job at a small travel agency. As she tries to cope, we see her life in flashbacks, beginning with when she met Franklin (John C. Reilly) and became pregnant unexpectedly. When Kevin is born, there's a strong implication that Eva didn't want him and was indifferent to his birth. There's also the implication that Kevin may have been born evil, crying incessantly as a baby and exhibiting sociopathic tendencies and a distinct detachment from his mother as he grows older. Eva is disturbed by this, but unable to find someone to relate as Franklin is oblivious to Kevin's ways.<br /><br />Kevin is portrayed as a toddler, a young child, and a teenager by three different actors with the former two giving some of the best onscreen performances by a child I can readily recall. Rock Duer has little dialogue as the toddler Kevin, but his evil stare gives the film one of its most chilling moments. It's difficult for a child actor to give such a vacant stare without seeming laughable, but Duer just seethes evil in this scene. Jasper Newell as the younger Kevin has more screen time and makes Ezra Miller's eventual transition to teenager Kevin more easily believable. Both Duer and Newell deserve special recognition for how memorably creepy they inhabit these roles, making Kevin one of the most sinister children ever portrayed onscreen. More effective yet is that they're playing a human, where the typical sinister child of filmdom ends up being the antichrist or a victim of Satanic possession. We'll get to Ezra Miller later.<br /><br />Where Beautiful Boy was more linear, dealing with the parents more than the child in a more accessible fashion, We Need to Talk About Kevin is the more thought-provoking, haunting, and ultimately profound film in the way it deals with Eva and Kevin's relationship, tapping deeper into the psychology of both characters. In typical indie-fashion, it doesn't spoon-feed anything and the psychological nature is kept sufficiently ambiguous to provoke discussion. One of the most revealing conversations in the film comes when Eva tells Kevin that she's expecting another child. \\"You'll like it,\\" she assures him. \\"What if I don't like it?\\" he asks. \\"You'll get used to it.\\" \\"Getting used to it doesn't mean you'll like it. You're used to me.\\" This is heavy dialogue for such a young actor to deliver and Newell's naturalism makes it one of the most powerful moments in the film.<br /><br />Ezra Miller gives a powerful, genuinely scary performance as the teenaged Kevin. A relative newcomer with gorgeously sculpted features and piercing eyes, he'll be a household name if he continues choosing notable roles. This performance isn't filled with teenage angst, but pure apathy and evil, an uncommonly scary and pitch-perfect performance, especially for such a new actor. He deserves Academy recognition, as he makes Kevin one of the best onscreen psychopaths since Hannibal Lecter. Reilly takes a backseat to Swinton and Miller, but he's more potent than he was in Carnage, his other dramatic role of note in 2011. As for Swinton, they should've handed her the Academy Award as I didn't personally see a better performance by an actress last year. It's a soul-baring, yet understated and remarkably nuanced performance that covers a lot of emotional ground and provides us a thorough rendering of an emotionally complicated character. Swinton is already an Oscar winner (for Michael Clayton), but this blows that performance out of the water. There is no flamboyant \\"acting moment\\" that allows her to go for maximum emotional effect and get people to take notice. She handles this role with complete subtlety and grace, yet it's earth-shattering.<br /><br />Ramsay has a firm grasp on the film's tone. Along with Jonny Greenwood serving as the composer of the score, Ramsay incorporates some very innocent-sounding songs into a frightening context, a move which parallels the character of Kevin. This is only one of the impressive creative flourishes, with the color red serving as a nightmarish motif that's just as ambiguous as some of the motives of the characters. Ramsay pulls no punches as a filmmaker and We Need to Talk About Kevin is a harsh film that avoids sugarcoating or sensationalizing the subject matter. It also doesn't make it easy for us to choose a place to invest our empathy. It naturally draws our attention to the inherent evil within Kevin and thoroughly shows his lack of empathy from a young age, meanwhile showing Eva as a woman doing her best raising him despite not having strong maternal feelings. At the same time, the film forces us to consider that Kevin is a child and Eva is a rather selfish parent. The aftermath that she deals with evokes empathy certainly, but the film poses a lot of moral questions for the audience. Was Kevin born evil? Or did his mother's indifference towards his life cause him to develop an indifference towards the lives of others? Why is she the one who is ultimately punished, yet spared by Kevin?<br /><br />It's profoundly thought-provoking, going more in-depth showing possible scenarios that lead to the ultimate tragedy without giving a definitive answer that can't possibly exist. The final scene is a cinematic stranglehold that does the best job of any film on this subject illustrating the lack of conclusion anyone is able to come to about why this massacre occurred. It's this moment that really nails down what other films have tried and failed to explore; that ultimately, nothing can be said about it. It has more finality than the ambiguous way Gus San Sant tried to make this same statement in Elephant, but I think it ultimately leaves more questions for us.<br /><br />We Need to Talk About Kevin is a dark, absorbing film that is poetic, violent, moving, and horrifying. Ramsay is a brave director, able to provoke emotion by showing very little and then rocking our emotions when she chooses to show a little more. The entire massacre scene unfolds in a staggering way that is frightening and unexpected, but never exploitative. It's a difficult film, but it's one of the best, most memorable of 2011. Films don't get more powerful than this.<br /><br />GRADE: A-

B005LAIGWS|2.0|Nicolas Cage returns as Johnny Blaze in Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance, a sequel to the wretched 2007 movie Ghost Rider. I've never read a Ghost Rider comic and I despised the first film, but actually looked forward to this sequel for a number of reasons. First, this sequel boasts an entirely new creative team and delivered an impressive trailer. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, I've become a huge Nicolas Cage fan. Directed by Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, the creative minds behind the Crank films, the two are known for injecting their work with a lot of energy. It's with sadness that I report Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is an uneven, poorly written film only slightly better than its predecessor.<br /><br />Johnny Blaze is hiding out in Eastern Europe, struggling with the curse of being the Ghost Rider. He's approached by a monk named Moreau (Idris Elba) who wants Johnny to help protect Danny (Fergus Riordan), a young boy being hunted by the Devil (Ciarán Hinds). Initially reluctant, Moreau promises Johnny that his assistance will give him the one thing he wants back most in the world; his soul.<br /><br />Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is a complete departure from the first film in tone and style; much darker, yet somehow taking itself less seriously. While Mark Steven Johnson (a very hit & miss writer/director) wrote and directed the first film, the sequel has Scott Gimple, Seth Hoffman, and David S. Goyer handling writing duties. The latter had a hand in writing two terrific comic book-based sequels, Blade II and The Dark Knight. A deeper look into his filmography reveals he's quite the hit & miss writer himself, with films like Demonic Toys and The Crow: City of Angels under his belt. The script successfully strays from the tone of the first film, but is ultimately the film's greatest weakness. It's poorly conceived and ham-fisted, with a story that could serve as any run-of-the-mill, straight-to-video action flick.<br /><br />The manic direction of Neveldine/Taylor and the mania of the great Nicolas Cage keep the film watchable. Full disclosure; Neveldine/Taylor have never made a great film and some could argue they've never even made a good film. They've directed Crank, its sequel Crank: High Voltage, and Gamer. With the exception of the latter (unseen by me), these are fast-paced, over-the-top, mindless action movies that accomplish exactly what they intend to and are so ridiculously fast-paced and entertaining, I can harbor no ill-will towards them. Their last screenwriting credit was for Jonah Hex. Remember that movie? You don't need to. The Neveldine/Taylor name is not exactly synonymous with high-quality filmmaking, but they are high-energy filmmakers with talent. If they had a good script, they could pull off something spectacular. They do a better job on Ghost Rider than Mark Steven Johnson did, bringing their trademark \\"action-movie on amphetamines\\" style to it. The fun, animated sequences scattered throughout are a nice touch that I'm sure are entirely their creation.<br /><br />Then there's Nicolas Cage, a rare actor capable of elevating the worst material. It's easy to say that Cage's recent track record of bad movies is to blame for how ineffective this movie is, but this is likely the Ghost Rider film we'd get with or without him. With him, it's occasionally amusing trash. Without him, it would just be trash. Neveldine/Taylor can only do so much to make it trashy fun, but the amateurish script automatically relegates it to garbage-status. Cage, as usual, elevates it by going over-the-top and having fun with it. It's clear that Cage enjoyed making the film more than I enjoyed watching it, but his boyish, maniacal glee make passages of Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance worth watching. Even Cage can't turn water into wine, but he's an actor that never fails to amuse.<br /><br />The special effects, including the design of the Ghost Rider are much better; grittier and more appropriate to the character. Hinds is a great actor who does what he can as the Devil, but the main villain is Ray Carrigan (played by Johnny Whitworth), who later becomes Blackout. Blackout may be an interesting villain in comic book form, but on film he's just a moderately amusing, inept villain with the power to decay anything he touches. In its brief running time, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance races through mildly entertaining action sequences and an uninteresting, predictable plot to eventually reach a disappointing anti-climax. The Ghost Rider character lacks enough depth to ever be a part of a film as impressive as The Dark Knight, but there is potential there for a bad-ass movie. This sequel, while much better than its predecessor, not only fails to live up to that potential but fails to live up to a standard of mediocrity.

0307949508|5.0|This is the second book in the Millennium trilogy and like the first, it doesn't disappoint. This one is real page turner from the beginning and especially at the end. I'm not a huge one for books, but the ending approx 100 pages I read in one fair sitting, taking about 2.5 hours. Salander is accused of 3 murders and it is up to Mikael to clear her innocence even though she wants nothing to do with him. You get some really good information about Salander's past and how it relates to the story and the murders. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone 18+ that enjoys suspense/crime novels.

B000VSBX34|3.0|Giving it three stars for the music. I'm afraid the movie itself hasn't stood the test of time.  The story line is typical for a farce/spoof, but the script lets it down badly.I remember it being so much funnier - but then the last time I saw it was when it first came out.  Despite the disappointment with this aspect of the dvd, I must say it was worth every penny for the music.  Took me back to their glory days - and mine.  If you love their music, buy it and disregard the movie - you just can't get dvd's of their concerts, and if you could all you'd be able to hear would be screaming anyway.

B002T9H2LA|3.0|For many years, Tarantino had this film partly written, but never could think of way to finish it, as well as finding time to fit it into his schedule of projects. There were rumors of Sly Stallone and Arnold playing characters, before production, but Quentin shot those down.<br /><br />People were hoping \\"Inglorious Basterds\\" would be something on the scale of  \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", but sadly, that is not what this film is. In fact, this film is not historically, accurate. It follows a group of Jewish-American soldiers hunting Nazi's and ultimately, plotting a massive explosion in a cinema premiere, which has all the high-ranking German officers (including, Hitler). There is another story being told in the film of a young Jewish woman, who runs the cinema and plots her own revenge on the Nazis that killed her family.<br /><br />There many great actors and performances in the film, all elevated by Tarantio's witty dialouge and skilled direction. Christopher Waltz is fantastic (and deserved that Oscar), as well as Brad Pitt and Diane Kruger. Unfortunately, like many of Tarantino's films, there is A LOT of dialogue scenes, with small graphic violence thrown, in between. Not just dialogue, but subtitles all over the place. Expect a lot of reading, which is a shame, because this is a beautiful film to look at.<br /><br />There are some great moments in the film, especially, the intense opening scene, involving Christopher Waltz invading a farmhouse, as well as the bar shoot-out scene with Michael Fassbender.<br /><br />But like I warned, this a dialogue-heavy film. If you've seen Tarantino's other films, don't expect the pacing of \\"Kill Bill vol. 1\\", but more of \\"Kill Bill vol. 2\\". The pacing of \\"Basterds\\" feels slow. It's not as tedius, as \\"Death Proof\\" or \\"Jackie Brown\\", but at times, it almost feels that way.<br /><br />Tarantino has certainly, grown as a filmmaker, in the way he constructs and shoots scenes. The colors and the compositions he uses in his imagery have quite the impact.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of \\"Pulp Fiction\\" and the Kill Bill films and enjoyed, \\"Resevior Dogs\\" and there's no question that Quentin can write and direct, however he should be careful to not be so engrossed with his ability to do so. His love and knowledge of film, as well as his dialogue skills, are kind of impeding on story-telling. Also, there is a lack of balance of dialogue\action, which hurts the pacing.<br /><br />Yes, this is not the grand, WWII epic we thought Tarantino was going to make. What he did make, is still entertaining and worth watching, for the performances, alone.

B0040YFR1Y|3.0|\\"Predators\\" is a film that, obviously, tries to be the \\"Aliens\\" of the franchise. This was originally, thought-up and written by Robert Rodriguez (who is executive producer), but his script was rewritten by a couple of screenwriters, and instead of Rodriguez directing, \\"Armored\\"'s Nimrod Antal was chosen to direct. Thankfully, KNB (\\"Walking Dead\\") took-over, as creature effects, instead of ADI (who had worked on the AvP films).<br /><br /> In an attempt to be a \\"direct\\" sequel to the original film, a group of humans are mysteriously, kidnapped and then parachuted to a rainforest. However, we soon learn that this group is made-up of different types...murderers, assassins, mercs and soldiers, who soon find out that they're on another planet, within a game preserve.<br /><br />Basically, it's The Dangerous Game. I actually, really like this idea, but unfortunately, the idea is not as executed well, as hoped.<br /><br />Adrian Brody plays lead of the group, made-up of other actors, Walter Goggins, Alice Braga, Topher Grace and even, Danny Trejo, to name a few. Unfortunately, Trejo's character is barely developed and there's really nothing memorable of his role.<br />Topher Grace is certainly, an odd choice, but the reason of his selection by the Predators (while, pretty lame) isn't revealed, until much later in the film. Adrian Brody beefed-up for his role and he does an ok job with his performance, but he is no Arnold. There is a cameo by an actor, that I won't spoil, but they explain the reasons why the Predators are hunting them, as well as little backstory on the Predators.<br /><br />The film does take a while to get going and uses the time to try to develop the characters and establish the situation. The action scenes are quick, but fun to watch. The three hunting Predators have fantastic designs and look menacing, but unfortunately, only one shows their face and its definitely, not the face we expect.<br /><br />That being said, it needs to be pointed out that there are two different Predator species at war with each other. The three hunting Predators are one species, while the other species (the Predators we know, from the previous films) is represented by one warrior, who is also on this game preserve planet.<br /><br />As I mentioned, the action scenes are brief, especially, with the two out of the three Predator hunters being quickly, killed off, one after the other, near the end of the film. I must mention though that I love the battle with the \\"Falconer\\" Predator and the Yakuza character. There's also a short sequence, near the beginning, of Predator \\"dogs\\" chasing the humans around, as well as a scene of a  bipedal, insect creature that chases Topher Grace, until it's shot.<br /><br />You can see that there are clearly, both good and bad ideas in this film. There's a lot of homeages and mentions of the events of \\"Predator\\", but this film fails to stand on it's own as something, original and necessary for the franchise.<br /><br />Predator blood-feuds is an interesting concept, that's been brought-up in the comics, but it just complicates things, instead of adding something new.<br /><br />If Robert Rodriguez, Nimrod Antal and the writers, really just developed the characters better and came-up with more scenes of the Predators, this movie really couldve been great.<br /><br />Hopefully, the sequel to \\"Predators\\" will do just that...

B004QOB8SO|4.0|The first season of BBC TV's 'Sherlock' was easily my favorite show of 2010. The updating of the traditional characters created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was surprisingly effective in a modern-day setting and created some of the most fun and suspenseful episodes of TV I've ever seen.  This second season of 'Sherlock' has a lot of great moments (and one outstanding final episode) but is also a bit uneven and lacks some of the freshness of the starting season.<br /><br />The first episode of 'Sherlock: Season Two' picks up where the season one cliffhanger left off, with Holmes and Watson in a life-threatening stalemate with arch-villain Moriarty. After \\"escaping\\" Holmes and Watson are put onto a case involving blackmailing dominatrix Irene Adler (the con-artist from the Arthur Conan Doyle stories) in the fun but wildly inconsistant \\"A Scandal in Belgravia\\". The second episode, \\"The Hounds of Baskerville\\" is a more straight-forward mystery as the two detectives take on a modern variation of the famous novel ('Hound of Baskervilles' along with hints of the story 'Devil's Foot'). Then things finally come to a head with a showdown between Holmes and Moriarty in \\"The Reichenbach Fall\\".<br /><br />Like the first season of 'Sherlock', each episode has it's merits but not all are equal in quality. I liked Irene Adler at first thanks to Lara Pulver's performance and some clever writing: her being unclothed when meeting Holmes so he couldn't \\"read\\" or \\"deduce\\" anything about her was a nice touch and showed just how much smarter than Holmes she could be. Unfortunately the tone of the episode kept changing on the fly (with waaaaaay too many red-herrings) as did Irene's personality and it was hard to get a grasp on how we're supposed to feel about her character. 'Hounds of Baskerville' was much more consistant with some touching character development from Holmes, Watson and guest character Henry Knight (a terrific Russell Tovey) but also felt unconnected from the overall plot and didn't seem to really go anywhere. Much like the first season of 'Sherlock', it's the final episode that makes this season worthwhile and it's exciting seeing a vulnerable Holmes in a fight for his life against the schemes of Moriarty.<br /><br />As with the first season, 'Sherlock: Season Two' has engaging performances from it's actors. Benedict Cumberbatch is making the character of Holmes his own and is excellent when showing Holmes' more vulnerable side. Series creator Mark Gatiss is given more to do this season as Holmes' brother Mycroft as is Rupert Graves as Lestrade. Andrew Scott creates a creepy and dangerous villain in Moriarty and you feel the tension ratchet up whenever he's on-screen. As usual the best performance in 'Sherlock' comes from Martin Freeman: he was born to play John Watson and the conviction of his performance (and his humanity) keeps you anchored to every episode even as the stories spin out of control.<br /><br />This second series of 'Sherlock' may be a bit rocky and lacking in the freshness of season one, but it's engaging character development, clever mysteries and outstanding season finale make this a DVD set worth buying.didn't seem to really go anywhere.

B006CS7UXO|5.0|Although I've always loved the Pet Shop Boys and have all their albums, I've never been enough of a fan to buy all the singles so I appreciate these B-sides compilations.<br /><br />Seventeen years on, 'Format' is the follow-up to the brilliant 'Alternative' and although of comparable quality is a very different collection. What I enjoyed most about 'Alternative' was seeing how Neil and Chris progressed musically. It was almost like hearing them become the Pet Shop Boys, so by the time of the last track on the second CD they have arrived at their unique sound.<br /><br />There's less development in 'Format' because that sound has been established. To that extent this new collection is less of a journey than a series of forays from an established point, so there are some real oddities, tracks that sound more experimental than anything you'd get on an album, for example 'Disco Potential' or 'The Former Enfant Terrible' (great title even if the song doesn't quite work). There are also some ridiculously camp songs too, 'Between Two Islands' and some unexpected instrumentals.<br /><br />This means the album is a bit patchy and I can see certain songs being permanently skipped over. What remains (and it is the majority) is just wonderful and cover the complete soundscape of the PSB. There are the thumping dance numbers, 'Resurrectionist' or 'Blue on Blue' as well the quieter, more thoughtful and intimate tracks (the closest PSB come to ballads) such as 'The Calm before the Storm' a short, elegiac gem. There are also some unexpectedly rocky numbers, 'I didn't get where I am today', for example, and I was glad to see 7\\" versions of 'Discoteca' and 'No Time for Tears'.<br /><br />My only slight disappointment is a lack of true 'signature' PSB tracks, those songs that combine relentless disco beats with melancholic orchestral arrangements... but because this is a B-side collection (i.e. material that didn't make it on to the albums) that may not be a surprise.<br /><br />Finally no review could omit saying something about the packaging. As always with a PSB release it's as good as the music with a beautiful box, great cover design, two separate wallets for each CD and a fascinating booklet that adds more detail and explanation about the songs. (Shame there's no photo of 'The Boys'). Indeed so consistently good is PSB packaging I can never imagine buying one of their albums on digital download.<br /><br />Non-PSB fans probably won't be moved by this collection, but if you like them this is an essential purchase. It only goes up to 2009... so let's hope that means a third B-side collection will be released one day. I just hope we don't have to wait as long as we did after 'Alternative'.
B000HF0ISC|1.0|What a piece of crap!<br /><br />Crap. I couldn't have connected less with the characters. I had great sympathy for the young boys, whose story was told for the first 1/3 of the movie, and then suddenly they're men. What are their names again? And what are they doing? Why are they so secretive? And their accents--are you kidding me? Why am I watching this???
B004EPYZXU|4.0|'Cannibal Holocaust' has a lot to answer for. As the first of the 'found footage' films it has spawned more than three decades worth of movies, given a boost in the arm in the 90s with 'Blair Witch' and more recently 'Paranormal Activity', to which the success of both probably gave us Apollo 18.<br /><br />It's a clever premise and whereas normally these films can be done on the cheap ('Blair Witch' is effectively a bunch of kids running around a forest with a video camera), this surely had quite a substantial budget with all the sets and effects.<br /><br />The most impressive thing about 'Apollo 18' is the quality of the footage. It all looks authentically 1970s, even down to the colour saturation and the lines on the TV screens. Genius! Less impressive is its desire to capture the verisimilitude of a moon landing. To do this, it's necessary for minutes and minutes of unnecessary, eventless, one could even saying boring footage. That creates a degree of realism but costs the narrative dear. The result is a horror movie that is more clever than frightening. You experience it in the brain, not gut. That said there are some wonderfully creepy moments, especially when they first discover the Soviet lunar module.<br /><br />One final point (with an obvious spoiler). If this is supposed to be a found footage movie and a lot of that footage was done on hand cameras (so not broadcast back) and it all ends terribly for the crew... how could the recordings have ever got back to earth to be uploaded?
B007N0REX6|5.0|Slash fans listen up! As soon as this record was availible, I down loaded it from Amazon mp3. This record kicks butt! If anyone gives it less then 5 stares needs to listen to it more. Perhaps with head phones on and thier air guitar in hands. I have played it at least 10 times in a row and it sounds better each time. It is bound to be a rock classic. Some one tell me I am wrong.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|One of the best calculators available for the Kindle,  however it loses points for file size and lack of Landscape mode. Definitely worth the download though.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|After all the hype, I went ahead and ordered all three books. I'm sorry I did.  I simply cannot get through the first volume.  The story idea is great.  The execution (the writing) is deplorable.  I can't make myself finish-too many other good books out there!
B007ZCQJOM|5.0|I am on my second listen of the mp3 album (what a deal at $4.99!) and all I can say is that I'll be listening to this album a lot this summer.  As my title states, it has a bit more of a \\"dream pop\\" type sound to it.  I'm not a music review expert, and all I can say is go listen to a few of the songs on Youtube and if you like it, you won't find a better deal for the mp3 album than here at Amazon!
B007JWKLMO|5.0|Just finished watching the second half of \\"George Harrison - Living In The Material World\\" and all I can say is POWERFUL! The second half really was more about George's great spirituality as well as his many projects and solo endeavors from the time the Beatles broke up until he died, as well as his many friends and the effect George had on their lives. I think Martin Scorcesse did a phenominal job documenting George's life. Where the first disc documented his young life and his time with The Beatles, the second disc really was about the man that George had become. He was so humorous and really looked at the world in a very special way. He never took the material world too seriously because he had a great sense of what lies beyond this life. An excellent film! Absolutely beautiful!
B001J66RH4|5.0|I love Supernatural for many reasons. This is one of the episodes that displays the brilliant attention keeping story lines with many out loud laughs.
B007O3BGZE|5.0|I wasn't quite sure that they could create another effort on the level of \\"The Tall Ships\\", but after finally receiving a copy of the new It Bites CD \\"Map Of The Past\\" it is most positively so! You just don't hear much music these days of this high caliber. Guitarist/Lead Vocalist John Mitchell and keyboardist John Beck along with the phenominal rhythm section of Bob Dalton on drums and Lee Pomeroy on bass have delivered another masterpiece. It is a true \\"album\\" in that it is best listened to from beginning to end. This music is thoroughly enjoyable, interesting and quite powerful on an emotional level. I will for sure be listening to this one alot. Very recommended.
B0053O89RY|5.0|i first learned about this series when it won the emmy for best sitcom in its first season.  it has been a big emmy winner ever since.  if you are new to this show, it involves an extended family living in LA and their adventures in coping with modern life.  it is laugh out loud funny.  the escapades they get into on a weekly basis are something that are so everyday but played for maximum hilarity. a big winner often cannot keep up quality from season to season but this show is the exception.  the third season is every bit as good as the first. when i first started out watching, the gay couple made up my favorite characters.  although i still like them a lot, that has now been eclipsed by the very solid performance by ty burrell as phil the realtor married to claire.  he won the emmy for his performance last year and fully deserved it. in the season closer to season three we got to see phil react to his daughter's announcement to she was going to live with her boyfriend in an apartment.  utter mayhem ensued!  i can't recommend this show highly enough and i am sorry i cannot watch it again until fall.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B005CX53RU|5.0|I love my blutooth headphones.  Not the best thing out there for music but still very good.  They work great for phone calls, too.<br /><br />So, though the original battery last a long time, I wanted the convenience and security of having a spare battery that I could use while the other<br />is charging.  This has worked out great for me.  I can use the headset without the worry of not having a fully charged battery when I<br />go to use them.  This battery looks like the original and works perfect.  Highly recommend.
B003PBB4ME|4.0|It is what it promises to be and performs great. Convenient, well made and very practical. It makes your microphone and recording device a unit that can be used by it self or in a tripod.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been looking for this game and one day itsaid temple ruin I was about to buy it but I read the reviews and it said that there was a temple run for kindle fire I was like omg;)
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fills the need for solitaire card game play. Use it often as does my wife on her kindle fire. High recommendation.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I went into reading this thinking it was \\"just another teen drama\\", but thought I'd give it a try. I was hooked from the beginning. The author does an amazing job of creating characters that have qualities that make us fall in love with them, and the dystopian setting where the story takes place is imaginative, but still believable.<br /><br />While not a difficult read, I found myself glued to the pages, desperately wanting to know what the heroine, Katniss, was going to do next.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this to any reader, whether it be teen or adult, because there are human qualities portrayed that speak to all ages, and sometimes it forces us to look at ourselves and challenge our own beliefs, when faced with a dystopian future that pins it's children together in a fight to the death for the means of entertaining the wealthier class.
B002GU5V24|5.0|i have had fun listening to the live cds in the boxed set my fave cd is seconds out but all in all its a great boxed set and should be owed by any genesis fan
B006PHD0RW|5.0|awesome app. sooooooooooooo much fun 2 play!!!! only problem is it's kinda hard. I really like the aisle where u have 2 crush as many items as u can. hidden varriable studios have reallllllllllly done it!!!!

1439153663|4.0|This book is not a happy book, but it is an important book for those interested in the history of the old south.  We have come a long way in a couple of hundred years.  While the book is fictional, it reflects a composite of some of the things that occurred so many years ago.  The characters are believable, with a depth that causes the reader to feel a kinship with some while loathing the others.
B000SGSU58|5.0|On a scale of 1 to 10 I give this book a 6. I've read better from this author.<br />Not a nail bitter for me.
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|like I didn't see that coming... pahlease, and the wolf was terrible, unrealistic.  don't bother watching this movie or supporting the demonizing of wolves.  They don't act this - ever!
0345803485|1.0|Finally gave in to check this out when it stayed on the best seller lists so long... ugh, what a disappointment! I just do not get all the hype. This is such a boring and immaturely written book, it was painful to get through. I finally just started kind of scanning it to get through it (I refuse not to finish a book unless it is just horrible).<br /><br />I have to think anyone who finds this tantalizing must never have read anything remotely erotic before. The scenes just get cheesier as they go. More painful is the story & dialogue for the rest of the book... between a) pages and pages of their long, boring BDSM contract, b) pages and pages of silly emails that sound like they're between 2 teenagers & c) phone conversations that include \\"You hang up. \\"No, you hang up.\\" this was an irritating read.<br /><br />Other reviewers have covered better than I why this deserves 1 star, so I will leave it at that. Just beware, and consider finding a better book to spend your time with!
1416972242|5.0|I love this book so much! It came in super fast and was perfect! Will most likely buy the rest of the book in this series. Very happy.
B00628RVV0|5.0|A wonderfully made movie, it's all about the characters and story and being taken in. It is awfully heartbreaking though.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book does not live up to the hype...reads about the same as any Penthouse Forum letter...and some of the letters are much better.  Any teenage boy would do a better job writing erotica...you would be better served reading Anne Rice's \\"Beauty\\" trilogy
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I really enjoy this game! It is fun to play with friends. Great guessing and drawing game-- I would highly recommend to everyone!
0345803507|5.0|I love this book.  I love this series.  The product arrived on time, neatly wrapped in plastic.  Great quality, so glad to have bought it!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This game is a lot of fun! I would highly recommend this game for people of all ages! It has a lot of different things that you can do - you can create however you want! &lt;3 it!
B0083GPDBO|1.0|I have no idea why this movie was popular or why other reviewers liked it.  The story is predictable.  The acting is bad.  The special effects are lousy (very obvious wire work, blue screening, etc).
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Marvel really did it. This flick has everything in it that you want to see in a comic adaptation - which, admittedly, might not say a lot.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. gets all the good lines, in his Tony Stark/Iron Man role. The Hulk gets all the good physical moves, as well as some comedic action. Samuel L. Jackson swaggers as well as anyone, and a trenchcoat that probably cost more than any car I ever owned doesn't hurt a thing. But, best of all, Scarlett Johansson gets a really cool fight scene. Start with \\"Can I put you on hold?\\", then think \\"Ginger did everything Fred did, only backwards and in high heels.\\" It's that kid of fight scene.<br /><br />Totally popcorn-worthy and totally forgettable. I loved it.<br /><br />- wiredwierd
B0055SWM08|4.0|Fun,  thoughtful,  all around good game.  Easy to learn.  Easier still to lose a couple of hours.  It keeps me interested.
B0073ODRKG|5.0|This compilation of Madonna's music is totally awesome! If youare a Madonna freak like me you will Love this item!
B005LAIIRQ|4.0|Liam Neeson continues his string of action hits with THE GREY.  The story is fairly simple:  8 survivors of a horrifying plane crash in a hostile Alaskan wilderness must face Mother Nature--and a ferocious pack of hungry wolves.  Along the way, there are moments of male bonding and character expositions.<br />Director Joe Carnahan who assaulted us with the A-TEAM reboot helms the film, which boasts one of the most frightening and realistic plane crashes caught on film.  The film has a brutally beautiful canopy, and lends an air of desperation and loneliness.  Neeson is powerful as usual, a little more vulnerable than in TAKEN or UNKNOWN.  THE GATES' Frank Grillo makes good use of his first big movie role as the blustery macho man whose false bravado masks his true personality--a star-making performance.  Dermot Mulroney eschews his leading man persona in his laidback role and Dallas Roberts brings his usual \\"everybody's friend\\" image to fuller fruition.  The entire cast is good, but it's basically Neeson and Grillo's movie.<br />THE GREY is a dark survival film, flashing moments of painful optimism crushed by brutal reality.
0061438294|5.0|Learned a lot from this book, I never knew you could tell this much about someone's body movements. Great Book and easy reading!!!
0897500482|4.0|This book looks like it had been treated for a year by a community college kid that had not even broken it open but had rubbed the spine a bit in the process.<br /><br />I haven't read it, but the condition of the book is sort of deplorable.<br /><br />4/5 for being a weird standard of literature, 5/5 if it had been in good condition...
0345803485|5.0|I was compelled to read the book because of all the hype. People loved it and people hated it. Purported to be steaming hot (\\"mommy porn\\" - ugh) or over-the-top with dominant/submissive scenes. So I had low expectations, thought the writing would be so bad I'd have to put it down - or the sex would be too sado-masochistic that I'd have to put it down. Neither was the case. But, if people want classic literature, it's not fair to read this novel and then be mad when it's not Lady Chatterley's Lover, The Lover or Madame Bovary.<br /><br />It is a fairy-tale, a great read and a compelling novel. It's fun. Can't we have some fun? While there certainly was a BDSM (bondage and discipline, sadism and masochism) theme, the novel was more about getting out of it than getting into it. What made the theme so bearable and compelling was the protagonist's reaction to BDSM was much like so many women would have (myself included), \\"What the hell? This is scary!\\" And, like many women, it's all a completely foreign world. So we're taken through it all while having our own personal reactions validated throughout the experience. We are allowed to be curious about a form of erotica we know nothing about. Surely there are many women who do know about this lifestyle, but I think that's why this novel hit the mainstream so hard - because there are many of us who are not familiar with it.<br /><br />The fairy-tale element is also a big draw. It's not fairy-tale in the way of magic or vampires, the fairy-tale part is in the male character, Christian Grey, who is, in many ways, the knight in shining armor. (I recognize many will have trouble with this descriptor.) While he's not wholly so (making him more realistic actually), he is in the way that he is a strong man who knows what he wants and goes after it. He is uber-intelligent, obscenely wealthy, heartbreakingly handsome, extremely possessive and protective and wants to take care of his girl/woman. Over-the-top in all those ways, hence,the fairy-tale. Women want to be adored and want to be their own strong person - it's a huge struggle - and we get to live this struggle in the novel. That's what makes it a very satisfying read.<br /><br />Ninety-five percent of what I read is \\"respectable\\" literature - over the last year I have read Francoise Sagan, John Fowles, Alice Hoffman, Geraldine Brooks, Julian Barnes, Anne Patchett and Mary Karr. But Fifty Shades of Grey is like \\"The Darker Side of Thomas Crown\\" (referring to the film remake with Pierce Brosnan) - and I love that film as much as I loved \\"I Am Love.\\" Sometimes you're just in the mood for Thomas Crown.
B004UXUX4Q|4.0|Interesting premise. Turned it off when a ten year old is allowed to use words like \\"c**t\\", t**t\\", and \\"p**sy\\" without being marched to the bathroom and introduced to a bar of Ivory soap. NOT A MOVIE TO WATCH WITH YOUR DAUGHTERS. Headed to the CD shredder.
B005LAIIS0|4.0|Liam Neeson gives a riveting performance in a dark thriller set in the Alaskan wilderness. When a plane carrying Alaskan pipeline workers crashes in the middle of nowhere, the nine survivors find themselves in a struggle for survival; their plane has crashed in an area where a pack of grey wolves hunt and the seven survivors must face off against a brutal, fierce enemy that has every advantage except one--the human will to survive.<br /><br />Featuring a terrific supporting cast (Dermot Mulroney, Frank Grillo among others)and a strong script that manages to quickly sketch in the seven characters at the heart of the film.<br /><br />A bit of a left turn for director Joe Carnahan after the big studio productions he has directed of late (\\"The A-Team\\"), \\"The Grey\\" returns the director to the smaller ensemble based thrillers/dramas he began with--\\"Narc\\" and \\"Smokin' Aces\\" that help make his reputation- demonstrating that, as good as he is at big Hollywood productions, he's better with smaller, more intimate productions like \\"The Grey\\".<br /><br />The Blu-ray is a sharp, nicely detailed transfer. Audio sounds powerful and is VERY active putting you right there in the wilderness with our main characters.<br /><br />The special features are a bit limited--we get deleted scenes (some extended versions of some in the film) and a great, very frank commentary track from the director with editors Roger Barton and Jason Hellmann. It's a very informative and nicely done commentary track.<br /><br />Although a bit on the lite side when it comes to the special features what matters is the film itself. Although \\"The Grey\\" is very much a downbeat film, it's also a powerful film and well worth watching.
B005USZML4|5.0|Very good book a real page turner. The only thing I wish is that Amazon would group the book in the series to let the customers know which book in the series is first. I purchased both books and was able to figure it out but if I would have only been able to purchase one I would have been so lucky because I would have started with this one 1st.
0553582038|3.0|As the Publisher's Weekly review accurately points out the main flaw of A Feast For Crows is the fact that it's truly half a book-Feast and the follow up volume work best when read back-to-back with A Dance of Dragons and together earn four stars but this sprawling, often unfocused first half has its moments but fails to achieve the power of the first two volumes in the series.<br /><br />The good news is that if you want less Tyrion you get it-he's completely absent while Cersei,, Littlefinger,  Brianne and Ayra largely occupy center stage of this book. That's not to suggest that their story is uninteresting--to the contrary the characters that much of the book is given over to are interesting but without the contrast g stories of some of the other major characters this novel seems to replay the same note over and over again.<br /><br />My advice is to pick up this book and Dragons and read them back to back as they SHOULD be read and you'll find the story much more enjoyable.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I really like this app. I love how you can look 15 days ahead and for multiple locations. I highly recommend this.

B005O7PSRO|5.0|If season 4 is anything like the previous 3 this will be great. Looking forward to when season 4 available.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|this app deserves credit, i believe it is well worth the money. useful for every situation, the only thing i see wrong with it is it force closes if you type in Wolfram Alpha into the search bar (which personally i think is funny.)
0890090572|5.0|Absolutely gorgeous edition. I love how it is in the original print with the original dates and the original illusrations.
0345803485|1.0|It's obvious from the reviews, that you either love this book (over 1,900 reviews at a 5 star) or hate this book (over 1,700 reviews at the 1/2 star level).  If you want to read erotica, you may as well read Penthouse Letters - it's more believable.  The characters are so far out there that you don't know whether to laugh at the stupidness or cry since you already spent $9.99 on the kindle version.  I will never finish this nonsensical book.
B004DSX5B6|4.0|This is the second multitool I have owned.  The first was a Leatherman which I had for about twelve years before losing it. The Gerber may not be quite as sturdy as the Leatherman but has some features which make it much easier to use such as the ability to select a tool without opening up the pliers,  and the locking mechanism works much easier and safer as well. I also like the fact the pliers have a spring in them that keeps them open.  The scissors are ingenious, and actually work well. The phillips head screwdriver is not the greatest and I wouldn't trust it enough to put a lot of torque on it, but is okay for most simple fixes or tightening loose screws. For the money, it is a good quality tool.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Makes you want to continue reading. Loved it.  The two main characters you absolutely fall in love with both!
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Other one star reviewers have alreay covered the absolutely, ridiculously, embarrassingly bad writing and repetitive phrases that read like a teenager wrote them.  Amen to that!  Besides the fact this story could have been distilled down to one book, here's what got me: all the titillating press coverage would have you believe this series is erotic fiction. IT'S NOT: nothing ever moves beyond light bondage and spanking, which are fairly commonplace in your average bodice ripper. Despite lots of hints of \\"we'll do this later\\", the action in the play room is dull, dull, dull. Nothing more ever happens than what takes place in the first book. If you read the first book, don't look for any different sex scenes in the next two books. I'm not suggesting Ana should have been hurt more - I'm just saying if you like creative, erotic fiction there is a ton of variety the author hinted at but never used for what could have been very hot - but safe - sex scenes. She never delivered. And some libraries banned this series? You've got to be kidding me - this is tame stuff.<br /><br />I will give the author kudos for one thing though: she's laughing all the way to the bank. Gotta give her credit for whatever she did to get books published that would make any decent high school writing teacher vomit.
B007X15GRQ|5.0|This movie will not get an Oscar, but it's definitively a good movie, I enjoyed it and I think most people will too. As I said is not getting an Oscar or anything like that but it's good enough for an afternoon at home, spending some time, relaxing.
B0052VUNHC|1.0|I don't even know where to start, with the generally unlikable main characters, the lackluster writing, or the serious lack of editing. And yet: I finished it. Despite its many flaws, there was still something compelling enough about the story that I made it through to the end. The only comparison I could come up with is watching a disaster unfolding (appropriate, given the title); you don't want to see what's happening, and yet you can't seem to look away.<br /><br />The part when I realized how much I disliked Abby was, absurdly, was at a very insignificant plot point. Abby (the main character) and America (her best friend) are sitting in Abby's dorm room, listening to youtube videos and laughing while Abby's room mate is trying to study across the room. Said room mate is consistently called out for being a bitch due to her frequent use of sarcasm and general intolerance of Abby--but really, I can't blame her. More than once, Abby leaves Kara (room mate) to fend for herself when Abby's psycho maybe-boyfriend comes around pounding on her door in the middle of the night screaming. I wish Kara had been in the book more, because she seemed to be the sole voice of reason in a cast of Wonderland-derived characters. The more I read, the more I felt my brain trying and failing to grasp the twisted system of logic that rules the actions of Abby, Travis, America, & Co.<br /><br />Seriously, something is not right with these characters. I've heard of people running hot and cold, but every one of them is inconsistent, needy, callous, and impossible to relate to. Abby is clueless and completely okay with being controlled by Travis; it passed the point of ridiculous when he told her to go change her clothes before going out--on more than one occasion--and she's completely fine with it. America contradicts herself every couple pages, and seems to be a milder, perhaps a bit more sane half of a relationship modeled after the wild ride that is Abby and Travis. The only other female characters in the book aside from the best friend and room mate are all labeled as sluts, without exception. Although we meet Travis' and Abby's fathers, neither mother makes an entrance at all (one is dead, and I think the other is a drunk?). Um, okay.<br /><br />Maybe it's a trend now that e-books are being self-published, but I've noticed more and more often how lacking these stories are in terms of really simple proofreading. This book was missing words completely, misspelling words, and ignoring the basic rules of grammar entirely. I can understand a few typos, but come on, you're a published author--this read more like a fanfiction gone terribly wrong.characters in the book aside from the best friend and room mate are all labeled as sluts, without exception.

B003EVWDR0|4.0|I have refused to watch this movie for its over the top sensationalistic promotion and other such idealistic reasons.  Then I got roped into watching it, and was pleasantly surprised.  Well thought out, beautifully laid out scenes and cinematography.  Not a bad story line...though nothing real new either.<br />I wouldn't put this in my top ten or anything but the work that was put into this production was quite evident and this film deserves the four stars I have given it.....and I don't give those out lightly ;)
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I did a random match and the idiot starts cussing me out for mo reason and there's no delete player button other then that great game :)
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I have this game on my HTC Incredible 2 and it works amazingly, but on my transformer prime tablet it is constantly freezing up and I can barely make it past a level before I have to start all over again. it is an awesome game, but I would love it even, more if I could play it on my tablet, so please fix.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Fifty Shades of Grey<br /><br />I honestly didn't know what to expect when I first started reading Fifty Shades of Grey. It was a critically acclaimed book, with lots of accolades and glowing reviews in Entertainment Weekly and other venues, although the center of the topic hinged on sex and BDSM. So it gave me the impression the book might be very dark and moody. The Kindle Sample seemed innocuous enough, with Anastasia tripping and falling into Christian's office. By the end of the book, I wanted to read the second and third novels in the trilogy and felt that it wasn't very dark or disturbing. Sure there is a lot of sex and domination/submission going on, but Christian seems to have run a very tight ship regarding rules and regulations to prevent injury or harming one another with the exception of emotional scarring.<br /><br />I did have some complaints about the book. This should not come off as a surprise considering the sheer number of other reviewers that felt the same way. The writing is fairly juvenile. The author overuses the same verbs and phrases. If you made a drinking game where the reader takes a shot each time Anastasia flushes, blushes, or says \\"Holy ....\\", the reader would pass out probably within the first few chapters. Christian also cocks/tilts his head, as if there was no other gesture to make. I kept thinking of a pet dog that would cock his/her head to try and understand you. In any case, Anastasia often comments on Christian's long index finger, and how handsome he is. He's really handsome. She can't get over how handsome he is. Did you think that was annoying how I used the word handsome three sentences in a row? Expect much more of that in the book!<br /><br />There are some technical issues I have in the book. The author either knows something about cars and computers that I don't, or there are special versions reserved for insanely rich people. First is the Macbook Pro that Christian buys for Anastasia. The technician describes it as having 32 gigs (32GB) of RAM and a 1.5 terabyte (TB) hard drive. I can understand the 1.5 TB hard drive capacity, assuming the book was written around 2010-2011, it could have been an early release hard drive that fits internally into the laptop - regardless, that capacity is somewhat available although you generally see something like 250GB-500GB for laptop hard drives. My gripe is the 32GB of RAM. The Macbook Pro is just an overpriced Apple-branded Intel-based laptop, so it uses the same CPU, chipset, RAM, and hardware as a Dell, HP, Toshiba, etc... unless Christian Grey has a custom made laptop motherboard with 4 SO-DIMM slots, the laptop would have maxed out at 8GB or 16GB with the typical pair of SO-DIMM slots. Assuming Apple developed the specification for 4 DIMM slots on a special Mac Book Pro, the chipset would have to support 32GB of RAM. On a desktop, I would not question this because most motherboards worth their mettle will have at least 4 DIMM slots.<br /><br />I will give the author the benefit of the doubt, and chalk it up to creative licensing. So essentially Christian Grey bought Ana a Mac Book Pro with 32GB of RAM and a 1.5TB hard drive to browse BDSM porn and to educate herself using Wikipedia in the name of research. A netbook with a single-core Atom processor and 2GB of RAM would have been more than sufficient for that task, heck even an iPhone would do the trick. Speaking of IPhone, Christian buys Anastasia a *cough* BlackBerry so he can talk to her anywhere at anytime. Uhm, a BlackBerry? Excuse me? He buys her a top of the line laptop, and even buys her an Audi A3 (more on that later), but somehow cheaps out and buys her an antiquated smartphone? The BlackBerry was a dinosaur as soon as the iPhone was released, and especially with the heated competition between Android smartphones and the iPhone during 2009-2011.<br /><br />In the book, Christian buys Anastasia a 2-door compact hatchback Audi. This was the initial description and it got me thinking about exactly what car she got. I suppose the Audi TT would fit this category, but instead she eventually reveals that she was driving an A3. I've never seen a 2-door Audi A3 before, but sure enough they exist. They look almost exactly like a VW GTI, but the 4-door wagon A3's are far more common in the US.<br /><br />So I can understand the author's needs for showing the wealth and influence of Christian Grey, but his presents to Anastasia are inconsistent. The first edition books are consistent with gifts from someone wealthy (like a King). The Mac Book Pro fits that as well with its mythical 32GB of RAM and insanely large 1.5TB hard drive for email and web surfing (the overkill and extravagance fits the bill of a wealthy tycoon), but the BlackBerry and Audi A3 2-door are cheap things that common people can buy. It seems like the author ran out of ideas with these 2 gifts. I would have probably wrote that Grey gave something like a next-generation developmental iPhone and an Audi S5. I have a friend who has an Audi S5 and she drives it in high heels (just like Anastasia), and she also has an iPhone. Granted, my friend is not representative of the entire female reader demographic, but it shows that these products are more appealing than an antique BlackBerry or an Audi-branded VW GTI with an underpowered 2.0L FSI engine.<br /><br />Back to the book. I did enjoy the story, as long as I ignored the juvenile writing style. Christian and Anastasia's relationship is the centerpiece, and she slowly melts away Christian's emotional scars to reveal something deep inside of him. I suppose this is a way of showing how women always want to change their men, as if it were a weekend project. But that is also the charm of the story. I am anxious to start the next book. I liked the idea of Christian giving Anastasia an inflatable balloon of Charlie Tango (his helicopter, and no it's not innuendo) - that was actually kind of charming.<br /><br />Overall: 4/5 stars, very enjoyable read although poorly written. There is a lot of sex in the story, but there's nothing too dark or disturbing.<br /><br />I see a lot of people voting my review as not being helpful. In exactly what way was this review unhelpful? Please post your comments so I can improve the review. I plan to start the second book in a few days. It took me only about 2 weeks of short reading sessions to finish Fifty Shades of Grey.ing about exactly what car she got.

B007JM4CWY|5.0|i love this game! Probably wouldn't have considered it at full price but it was a steal as the free App Of The Day. Good way to stimulate the brain and it is fun to see the pictures take shape.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|not.bad.the games are a litttle expesinve in.points but not too bad<br />I guess I would reccomend this game to.my friends
B007N0REX6|2.0|Sorry but a singer generally makes a group, and this guy sounds the same on every song, making all the songs sound the same -- I wish Slash could team up with Ozzy - that could be interesting; I'll pass on this mess.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|The kindle for android app works great! I got it for my Samsung galaxy tab and no complaints so far.
B007R3AZNK|5.0|This is one of Joe's best releases yet. I stumbled on to Joe quite accidentally Jan 2011 on Palladia, with the RAH concert. Immediately, I knew I had stumbled onto greatness, the likes of which I had never seen nor heard for the past 20 odd years (same old, same old rock/blues of the 70s and 80s..). My first reaction was to go out and buy his entire CD/DVD catalog and listen to what I'd missed the past two decades. I've seen him live four times thus far and met him twice - you could not ask to meet a more grounded, humble, and down to earth bluesrock genius. Every performance by Joe and the band has been nothing short of professional, fun, and excellent. Joe has a talent that brings bluesrock into the modern age, and the productions by Kevin Shirley lately have been nothing short of perfect. Dislocated Boy, DTTD (title track), Heavenly Soul, and especially the impeccable, complex riffs and crybaby work on the last track (#11) with Jimmy Barnes, which is more or less a perfect rendition of anything I have ever heard - everything blends in perfectly. A home run, Joe, and hopefully, many accolades and radio time (finally!!). ONE JOE TO RULE THEM ALL! THE NEW GURU OF BLUESROCK.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I will admit up front that I am not usually a person that reads this type of book.  However, after all of the hype, I wanted to give it a try.  The first book was a little sluggish, and tough to get through...but book #2 and #3 were great!  It took me about 4 days to get through all three books.  Yes, the writing is not all that great, but it was not as bad as some other books that I have read.  I will say that I truly enjoyed this Trilogy!  I recommend these books to other adult readers.  Great for summer reading at the beach!
B001E45XT4|3.0|Comfort: The headset can feel tight in longer periods of use. The top of my ear is touching the inner cup other than this it has soft cushions, covers around your ears (at least mine)<br /><br />Sound quality: It dosn't really go loud and the lows arn't really there. highs and mids are okay.<br /><br />Mic quality: it dosn't really block out backround noises very well and people say my voice has a bit \\"static\\" to it. But it is not horrific.<br /><br />If you are looking for something to game or listen to music with don't buy it go for something a bit more expensive. but if you are going to surf the web, talk a bit on skype, get some work done. it is good for its price..
B004J1DBJI|1.0|Be forewarned. My recommendation to you about Wolfram/Alpha is to wait at least for Wolfram/Beta. This app has crashed on me every time I've tried to use it. It crashes on simple searches like \\"Miami weather.\\" This is the first Amazon app that causes me grief on the Kindle Fire. Question Anyone: Is there a way to get your money back from Amazon for flawed apps like this?
B007RAJVR4|4.0|Jason Mraz's fourth proper studio album [[ASIN:B007RAJVR4 Love Is A Four Letter Word (Deluxe) [Explicit] [+Video]]] is arguably his best. Mraz takes his affinity for blue-eyed soul to the next level without compromising his firm pop background.  The horns are fully intact in full fruition from 2008's excellent [[ASIN:B0013FNC38 We Sing, We Dance, We Steal Things]] and the songwriting is even stronger. If anything, Mraz sounds much more soulful than usual without being a `soul singer.'  Mraz co-writes the majority of the songs here and Joe Chiccarelli serves as the producer throughout.  The deluxe version of the album includes a demo version of \\"I Won't Give Up\\" as well as four live tracks.<br /><br />\\"The Freedom Song,\\" the only cut that Mraz does not co-write is a brilliant way to begin the album.  Guitar and percussion (performed by Victor Indrizzo) open up the effort in a restrained, though soul-folk manner.  The overall production, once reaching full fruition, is quite hip, including horns, drums, and sounds indigenous of 1970's pop/soul.  Mraz's tenor sounds as solid and nuanced as ever and C. C. White's harmonized background vocals only accentuate the superbness of the cut. \\"Living in the Moment\\" keeps things rolling, opening with acoustic guitar and kick drum thud; electric guitar is panned right.  Mraz's vocals remain clear and pitch-perfect throughout; his soulful grit achieved towards the end is quite desirable.  The structure of the overall songwriting is strong with a bridge to the chorus (pre-chorus) being one of the biggest highlights.  Mraz does not dare slow down on the tastefully produced \\"The Woman I Love,\\" which with the keyboard work of Jeff Babko adds a little taste of organ to sweeten the sound.<br /><br />\\"I Won't Give Up\\" comes by means of a fine segue from \\"The Woman I Love\\" with guitar leading the way.  Restrained, Mraz sells the 6/8 cut perfectly, supported by the background vocals of Arnold McCuller, Valerie Pinkston, and Amy Keys.  The bridge section is a high-point, employing strong vocal harmonizations.  \\"5/6,\\" which literally alternates between five beat and six beat measures is clever, musical, and well executed.  The strings, arranged by David Campbell are a nice touch, not to mention the fine keyboard work by Babko once again and Zac Rae. \\"Everything is Sound\\" concedes no momentum despite being more predictable than its predecessor.  Carlos Sosa's baritone sax adds some punch, alongside the rest of the horns, keyboards, and background vocals. `Sound' indeed, \\"Everything is Sound\\" is quite infectious, particularly given the catchy refrain: \\"La la la...everything is sound!\\"<br /><br />\\"93 Million Miles\\" continues to show Mraz's consistent, pure tenor while \\"Frank D. Fixer\\" finds Mraz playing around with words (remember \\"Wordplay\\" or anything on [[ASIN:B0009WJ3HU Mr. A-Z]]?) The results are rewarding, even if you question Mraz's wit sometimes.  \\"Who's Thinking About You Now\\" is solid with its lovely string arrangement and solid harmonic scheme, notably on the bridge.  \\"In Your Hands\\" may not be the album's most `exhilarating' cut, but is above par and as solid as anything else, stand-out or not.  \\"Be Honest,\\" featuring the background vocals of Inara George flows right along as does \\"The World As I See It,\\" in which Mraz sings \\"It's not hard for me to love you...\\" speaking so optimistically of life.  In the physical CD standard edition, the Hidden Track is part of \\"The World As I See It\\"; Digital versions split the hidden track into a separate track.  As mentioned earlier, the Deluxe edition contains bonus tracks.  The most notable of those worth mentioning might be \\"You Fckn Did It,\\" a catchy, quirky up-tempo cut.<br /><br />Overall,  [[ASIN:B007RAJVR4 Love Is A Four Letter Word (Deluxe) [Explicit] [+Video]]] is a solid, well-rounded album. There are no bad songs and ultimately few quibbles or rubs.  If you have to trivialize, you might question are there any definitive `standouts' amongst an album so consistent? Overall, highly recommended.bum so consistent? Overall, highly recommended.
B007SGM084|5.0|An enthralling read, reminds me of a new-age Wuthering Heights. I kind of expected to be revulsed by some of the more graphic parts of the book but it was so well written that I never got the feeling that it was \\"too much\\".
1401937519|5.0|I attended a Wayne Dyer lecture last year and he spent alot of time talking about Anita's story. I got home and watched her youtube interviews and couldn't wait to get the book. I purchased the Kindle edition and read it while waiting for an audiobook. I do not write reviews on books, but I feel this is some of the most important work to come out in a long time. Anyone wanting to understand and discover who and what we really are, and the root cause of our problems need to read this book. Anita simplifies a very complex concept, and masterfully tells of the pain and discovery she experienced in her life. Her explanation of parallel lives and the reason we think in successive lives is masterfully done. I have read this and now listened 3 times. This has become a staple of my collection.
B00783NWB6|3.0|The film is really good with non-stop action.  Unfortunately I cannot give it 5 stars because of this format - not as advertised, misleading/confusing no extra digital disc incl., flixter is an app only accessible by your phone and it wastes your battery just loading the film. not convenient at all.  Why do they not offer the second additional disc?  Everyone is going to be dissatisfied with this UV version.  The whole point of having movies or shows on your iphone or ipod (btw you cannot load onto your ipod just your phone) is that you can watch it while traveling, it completely drains your battery just loading, Amazon you need to get rid of this and go back to the other format, there are so many complaints about this.  I would not purchase this - go to another store and try to find the other format if you want the additional disc, that is what I am going to try to do.  I really hope Amazon does not implement this in all blu rays going forward - terrible decision whoever decided this....I was really looking forward to watching this on the plane sometime, so disappointing - oh well.
B002QBS9KE|5.0|Fast shipment and no defect.
