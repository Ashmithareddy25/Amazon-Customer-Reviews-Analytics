B00AKYRCNY|4.0|My son loves this game. The puzzles are pretty easy but he really enjoys it. :) It does keep him engaged.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This is fun, but I get tired of getting eaten by the monster.  Since I'm new to this, guess I'll figure it out.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Started out kind of slow but got very exciting and kept you on the edge of your seat. A good story line and would recommend seeing it.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Don't really see what the hyp is all about.  Guess it just didn't do it for me; got bored pretty quick.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved this book!! I couldn't put it down. Very well written and moves at a really fast pace. Thank you.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|61.5$  !!!! .... are you kidding me ???<br />This is really insane .... I got this platinum edition for 24.99$
B007REV4YI|4.0|This Bond is almost as good as the Sean Connery Bond, Daniel Craig is just what the series needed. He as believable looks for the part.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Works as described.  This small but mighty battery charges iPhones and iPads with ease. I would buy this again. Thanks Anker!
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Perfect literature to start your young female reader with.  A true classic in every aspect.  Heart warming and story that is sure to touch any heart.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|I bought this CD because I loved the movie! I could not be any happier!! Fantastic music, great for working out while cleaning the house and for long road trips :)  I would highly suggest buying it if you like musicals.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Flynn keeps you on the edge things change on every page enjoyed the many twists and turns the gone girl take.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|Another fantastic game from G5. I loved the story line. The kind of graphics I love. Best G5 game Ive played yet.<br />Lots of action without to many searches. Also loved that I could play the Mahjong John cards in place of searches.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book kept me spellbound by its insightful content.  It reaffirmed my true belief in the wonders of God and our creation.
B003QSPTAY|5.0|Watched with 10 year old,  She prefers the new one, but I like this one.  Quality is good, simple little story from the 60's
B0071XO8RA|5.0|one of the best storys ive ever read wish the series would keep going. cant stop reading it may even read it twice
B007GEMQ2I|5.0|This product is for a 10 year old.  She loves all of these town items and has built them all.  The directions are clear and she does them all herself.  It takes hours, but she loves it.  She will take them apart and build them again too, she loves lego.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|The characters in these two places (one a hamlet, the other a town) are wonderfully simple and yet so engaging.  Follow young Laura as she makes the transition from hamlet to working in the local post office for the families cousin, Dorcus (who played Lydia in the A&E version of Sense and Sensability).  Its really a lovely series and I would highly recommend giving it a try.  Sadly it's only 3 seasons in total.  I liken it to another wonderful short program: Cranford with Judi Dench.
B0050AV5MW|5.0|Well crafted characters, unexpected plots twists, and a story that makes you glad that the books are so long. Excellent!
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Many artists are producing a set of singles sold in a collection that they call an album; Heist is actually an album. If you have love Macklemore's work you have heard so far then you will enjoy the album!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great story!! Can't t wait to read the next one! Really invested in the story and how it will play out.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I wanted to keep reading about this couple...  excellent story, a must read for any 50 Shades of Grey fan!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I like zombies, mostly the ones without heads :) Great show and very entertaining, can't wait for the next epasode.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I hope every body can play this game its the best game ever I hope every body can play this game
B002MQYOFW|3.0|My granddaughters wanted me to read this book, but I wasn't as impressed with it as they were. I'm not sure that I will finish the series.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book is hands down in my top 10 favorite space novels. Andy Weir has a gift for writing about space only surpassed by Ben Bova. Mark Watney's harrowing journey will keep you at the edge of your seat. You read about the journey through Watney's electronic diary and it puts you right in the action.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|While parts of the story were depressing and, therefore, hard to read, the overall result was a good story line with some surprises.  I especially enjoyed learning about flowers expressing specific meanings and took time to review the dictionary at the end of the book.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|It is awesome i think it is the best game ever.  but the graphics are ok but i think it is ok i still like it i have not stop playing with it
B007HC3LHS|4.0|I loved going back and forth in time.  The book made me understand why a person would have a hard time leaving an abusive relationship.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This was the second game I purchased on same day (see my review of Crystal Portal). This is the type game I am used to and it was a lot of fun to play and quite challenging at times. I LOVED some of the puzzles like the Angel Heads on the Chapel Door, the sliding puzzles on the china cabinet doors in the Lonely House. Very entertaining game.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Good book, but short on details for obvious reasons. I bought this book because of the recent death of Chris Kyle and I'm glad I read it.  It would have been better if it had provided some statistics and more insight into the inner workings.  I did think the information from his wife was valuable to give the reader insight into her side of how the war and his deployments affected their lives, but once again it was short on substance and details.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Great movie.  Historic and entertaining at the same time.<br />Amazon made it easy and cheap to be able to watch this movie the same day of the Oscars!
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Always great action in the Bond movies with amazing stunts. Of course the dialog is super! I really loved it!
1616550414|5.0|Amazing book with details, pictures and Then Legend of Zelda official timeline. A most buy for nintendo and zelda fans.
B00632HWOG|5.0|okay product, has some uses, good piece if you are int the type of unit to help you along in decisions
B004W1GCQO|5.0|Loved the old Upstairs Downstairs and I love the new one, too. Too bad they ended it after only three seasons. Not quite the caliber of Downton Abbey, but great just the same!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Good reading material, would recommend it for anyone, you sure do get your money's worth went you buy it on this page
B006LSZECO|5.0|There were lots of surprises.  I really like the way it was told from two perspectives.  Just when you thought you had it all figured out the author changed who is telling the story and the real truth comes out
B00846TTDG|5.0|Good reading material, would recommend it for anyone, you sure do get your money's worth went you buy it on this page
B008YU0AOE|5.0|When I saw that this Calculator was free, I couldn't pass it up. I work as an accountant for a fur buyer in rural Alaska. I needed something I could easily transport with my hundreds of other files when I fly to rural villages to write checks. This fit right in with the rest of my 'hands free' devices. It's so much better than carrying around a gawky calculator (and sometimes losing it). Overall, I thought it was very easy to use. I used it mainly for basic addition as well as charges equations. It worked like a 'pro' which is nothing less than I would expect from a Calculator Pro. haha. Overall I didn't use too many of the extravegant settings, but for everything I needed it worked conveniently, easily, and with a simple format. It was easy to use, self-explanitory, and definitely worked as an asset to our traveling business. I'd highly recommend it for any accountant that works 'on the go'. I needed something I could easily transport with the rest of my technology and this calculator was the right choice. I'm not disappointed.
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|okay product, has some uses, good piece if you are int the type of unit to help you along in decisions
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Definitely a must have app. Soothing sounds to listen to while meditating &amp; rain showers to help me catch some much needed zzz's :-) Having an alarm clock is an extra added bonus!!!
B0027MJU00|3.0|Good reading material, would recommend it for anyone, you sure do get your money's worth went you buy it on this page
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Not really a feel good movie but we really enjoyed it. Denzel is amazing and it's well directed. It makes you wonder about the pilot industry!
B0083ZRAJS|3.0|Great book, couldn't stop reading it. A definite page turner. I've seen almost all movie adaptations of this book and reading it definitely made me look at it in a whole new light.
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|This is an amazing piece of music that I recommend to any sort of rock or alternative music listener.  Almost flawless.
B002OHB3CG|4.0|Considering themselves as a symphonic metal/rock band, their release of this material in a milder accoustic arrangement does provide for a different ambience when one listens to it.  I really liked the way they adapted their musical material.  The absence of electric guitars make the introspective qualities of the songs come forth with a deeper emotional vibe. Sharon den Adel's voice shines through the album. The song &#34;Somewhere&#34; where Sharon den Adel sings in duo with Anneke van Giersbergen is a small wonder that would warrant buying this album on its merit alone.  Overall, a very good album where most songs have been recorded live.
B008602KQI|5.0|Jennifer Lawrence nailed this one.  I understand what all the excitement was about when this movie first hit the theaters.  Can I give it 6 stars??
B007IXWL2C|3.0|This may sound odd but I like the emails the best. They show the lighter side.  There is also a plot beyond the sex that I enjoyed.
0062124293|1.0|Admittedly, I'm still working through it, but I'm very bored so far. As a young 30-something, I'm not getting anything original from what she's writing. Masturbation? I think it's a worthy discussion but do we need to picture her like some shagging shaggy dog? Why does feministic honesty have to be so base? Why can't honest feminism also be eloquent and dignified?<br /><br />There were so many details about blood, hair, body parts, etc., in what I've read so far, and I can get that from youtube, Showtime, and any ole google search.<br /><br />I was really hoping for more brilliance given the reviews and the NPR stint, but I'm trudging through it by self-will for one reason: I want to know what others are discussing, having read it myself.<br /><br />Good luck.
B003XMAD3G|5.0|I bought this 2GB SODIMM to put in my QNAP TS-269 Pro NAS and it works great.  I tried to other brands of the same speed ram and they never allowed my NAS to start up, it just sounded like it was running at 100% and it never booted up completely.
B007SSDBBM|3.0|I capped off a long Hugh-Jackman-Marathon-night with Kate & Leopold. May I get off track for a moment by saying just how much I miss Meg Ryan? What happened?! Sleepless in Seattle was one of the greatest movies (I think) in its time! Ok - back on subject. Hugh Jackman. Awesome. Loved his performance as a duke dragged forward in time.<br /><br />However.<br /><br />(HERE THERE BE SPOILERS)<br /><br />.<br /><br />.<br /><br /> .<br /><br />Can I just say that the thought that Kate dating what was technically her great, great grandson CREEPED ME THE &%^! OUT!<br /><br />That's just wrong on soooo many levels!<br /><br />Ok, done.<br /><br />Loved the movie - but that not-very-well-thought-out incest dropped the movie to a 3 star for me.  Just saying.
B0018J2QB8|5.0|Love the show and how easy it was to order it.  Will order again in the future.  Can't wait for season 7.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|Les Miserables was stunning. Hearing Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway, and Amanda Seyfried burst spontaneously into song surprised me and took a moment to get used to, but once I did...goose bumps.<br /><br />I would really be hard put to recall when last I saw such affecting performances. I cried for at least 90% of the movie. Now, admittedly, I am a softy when it comes to tear-jerking scenes - but that does absolutely nothing to negate just how wonderful their performances were. That movie deserved the accolades it received - I give it 4 stars only because I had a headache from crying so hard by the time it was through.
B002QNBRXS|5.0|Great show.  It was easy to order and the wife and I enjoy watching it online.  Can't wait for season 7.
B006VZS1EA|3.0|This movie was a heart-warmer. Watching Hugh Jackman play a dead-beat, irresponsible, impulsive loser was definitely a role I'm not used to seeing him in. I got my first taste of Hugh-Jackman-Awesomeness when I watched him play Wolverine in Xmen, and Gabriel Van Helsing in Van Helsing, (which BTW are both equally awesome movies). So his performance as Charlie Kenton in Real Steel caught me off guard. I enjoyed watching his transformation from a cowardly jerk who sells off his son for 50k - into a man who slowly changes into something more on a summer-long, robot-boxing, road-trip with that same son.<br /><br />I do have to say that the storyline was pretty predictable - nothing happened in the general plot that surprised me, but the ending was cheering and heart-warming and, really, what else could you ask for on a cold, snowy night? I give Real Steel 3.5 stars.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Talk about an amazing picture quality on a classic film? This is it...The Godfather Collection in Blu-ray. I noticed some of the older reviews (2008) mention a &#34;grainy&#34; picture. Not so on the blu-ray version. We have watched the discs several times each and are still as in love as the first day.<br /><br />If you're a lover of The Godfather, do yourself a favor and pick this up! Amazon always runs deals on this set. Heck, I managed to snag it one day for $17.99!!
B00BHMF578|5.0|Thought-provoking and entertaining, a rare combination in movies these days.  A movie you'll actually use the &#34;48-hr rental&#34; for what it's worth, because you'll want to watch and re-watch to catch what you missed.
B00B9366VO|5.0|Dave Grohl delivers in this look into an institution that delivered some of the best music albums made from 1970 through the 1990s, in addition to bringing some of these greats back together to create a new orignal album. A must watch movie for any fan of music, music history, or just documentaries in general!
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Very well produced and as convoluted as a Carre novel.  It was excellently acted, thoroughly over the top in the best Bond mode.  Lots of fun
B00377E5SG|5.0|Sabrina is a great movie to watch and the character in the movie make you really blieve them. Really enjoyable.

B00AQB2A3I|5.0|The Raven That Refused to Sing, the third solo album by Steven Wilson, is jazzy, proggy, and just plain awesome from the chaotic, King Crimsonesque opening of \\"Luminol\\" to the final notes of the brooding, atmospheric title track.<br /><br />This is also the first solo album from Steven Wilson that didn't immediately grab me and throw me into his usual world of awesomeness. On my first play through of the album, I felt myself enjoying it but never really thinking it of anything groundbreaking like Grace For Drowning was. I loved the parts where Wilson just rocked out. I wanted every track to have an awesome prog-metal riff like the one in \\"The Holy Drinker,\\" I wanted there to be a frantic jazz-guitar solo like in the first half of \\"The Watchmaker;\\" darn it, I just wanted to rock out!<br /><br />But the Raven isn't all about rocking out. That wasn't Wilson's intention. He wanted to create an atmosphere, then destroy it mid-song and create a totally different one in the same song, then take you to a completely different place with the next song. And when Raven does rock, it's all the more satisfying.<br /><br />The Raven That Refused to Sing is lyrically Wilson's best since his work with Porcupine Tree on Lightbulb Sun. I remember the hair standing on my arms when hearing the words to \\"How is Your Life Today?\\" on Lightbulb Sun. It was a song about death. The title track on the Raven is also about death, and the lyrics gave me the same chills. Steven Wilson sure has a knack for writing about death and anything remotely unhappy. Hell, if he can make music this good, good for him!<br /><br />Overall, the Raven That Refused to Sing is another great addition to Steven Wilson's amazing arsenal of works. I am continually amazed how each one of his albums is different from the last. It is slightly similar to Grace for Drowning, but has a personality all its own. It's radically different from any of his Porcupine Tree albums, though I can hear the slightest bit of an echo fromthe Lightbulb Sun era. The metal parts of Raven sound unlike anything from In Absentia, Deadwing, Fear of a Blank Planet, or the Incident. I think it's great Steven Wilson is an artist who is unafraid of trying new things and making new sounds. I wonder what he'll bring us next? My ears are eagerly awaiting.

159413586X|5.0|I had already read this book, after borrowing a friend's copy. I love having my own to read again & again. The large print is great, especially when reading before bed time & with low light.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This was a great book told from many different points of view. It takes the reader through a number of points of view and it will be interesting how the movie tells the story this summer.
1594135851|5.0|I had already read this book, having borrowed it from a friend. Now, I really enjoy having this copy of my own. The large print is really nice, especially when reading before going to sleep & with low light.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This is so richly made, with detailed costumes (tho how in the world they ever kept warm in places like this, I'd like to know).  The story line is riviting, and I look forward to each series.
B0083Z614S|5.0|A touching story of nature and the power of positive thinking on one's health. Not at all gloomy like Jane Eyre or Wuthering Heights.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|It's sleek, easy to use, fits in my purse or bag, looks nice, works perfectly.  I would definitely recommend this case to anyone.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Just too bad that only one season was made. This series has major potential to be a long time running &#34;Sci-fy&#34; classic.
B0037NVM1I|5.0|I had no idea there was a director cut of this film have not watch all of the director cut yet.
0765325950|5.0|The first thought I had after completing the book is of the slow clap that Robert Jordan must be sending Sanderson's way from whatever ethereal plane of existence he's on. Where Jordan's earlier works were a bit scattered, a bit disconnected and erratic (We'll give it to him, he was trying to build the world still!) - Sanderson cuts through it all like a hot knife through butter and gives you an epic ending full of direct hardcore action that will keep you on the edge of your seat till you finish turning the last page. After that, you will be pleasantly surprised at the way he tied up EVERY loose end (barring some very minor ones) and you will be at peace with all the time you dedicated over the last decade going through the series.<br /><br />Robert Jordan built it up; Brandon Sanderson completed it. It may be lengthy, but with this job on the ending, the series is a must read and has all the aspects of a great epic on par with LoTR (blasphemy? I know. Now, go read the book and see what I'm talking about!). At the end, you'll do what I did, what Robert Jordan probably did and end this chapter with a slow clap to the efforts of the writers.
B0091WAN3C|5.0|one of the greatest batman films of all time. every one of the actors protrayed their character greatly and what a great performance by the late Heath Ledger.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|All aspects of this production were GREAT! FFC belongs in the &#34;HALL OF FAME&#34; for his ORIGINAL and present HD BR version!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever! Get it you won't be disappointed!!!!!!!!! It never freezes. The makers of this game is smart because they know how to make a GREAT game. Make more games like subway surfers!!! It is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B002ZG97EC|5.0|My 4-year old and 7-year old really love this movie!  I cannot tell you how many times they've watched this movie since we purchased it.  Can't wait for 2!
B004I744AS|5.0|Seriously, I first picked this app because it was free, but now that I have been using it, I would buy it in a heartbeat!  It is easy to use and has everything I need in a dictionary/thesaurus.  Buy it!  You won't be disappointed!
B0042RJWTC|5.0|Arrived fast and pretty happy. Had a issue with one of the DVD's had to skip a good fifteen min. To get around it but the whole series was worth the price.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|This season's characters are well developed, interesting and fun. The episodes kept you guessing what was going to happen next.
B002I9Z8I0|3.0|the older movies were very boring and  very much like watching a extended show  from TV. Not what I thought!
6305754969|5.0|again,  you have a great selection of movies that my wife and i love  some old monster movies we love have not been available, but we hope in the future?  thanks
B009R5GR1K|5.0|I use this everyday in my studies for nursing school.  kicks butt!! It never lets me down and it gives me all kinds of resources.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This is a super fun game.  I love games that require you too think and this does that while have a ball.  Everyone in my family enjoys it for different reasons.  We would highly recommend.  ZeptoLab.....you've done it again!  Great Job!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I like watching movies about a family and history and their lives. It kept me on the edge of my seat!
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I had the original red model for a few yrs & decided to order the newer model directly from company.  BIG MISTAKE! After waiting over 2 wks & not receiving I called to learn it was on back order w/no idea when it would be avail.  I was supposed to get 2 for about $74. (The \\"buy one get one free, just pay additional s/h,\\" ad.) I cancelled the order, went to my wonderful Amazon & ordered the new one for a total of $22 w/shipping!  So I could have had the 2 for $44 vs the $74 from the company.  And I had it w/in a few days.  Ok, so the new gray model is basically the same thing & good news is older red battery works in the new grey model.  It does seems to pick up better on difficult surfaces, (indoor/outdoor ribbed mat), but basically the same thing which is a good thing.  It weighs nothing, swivels everywhere, anywhere you want, (this model does not fold in the middle like the red older one), but other than that, the same. I personally love this since it's so easy, great for kitchen & bath floors, & a good quickie on carpeting.  I live alone so not a lot of traffic but I would not be w/out this handy item!  It just does a great job for cheap money & doesn't weigh anything to speak of.  Easy to put together & if you have the older model, the battery will work in the newer model. But BUY it from Amazon!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I've enjoyed watching Downton Abbey. Ever since my friend told me about it. I started watching it in the second season.  Master Piece Theater is wonderful!
B0070XFNDE|5.0|Easy rear interesting--this is third in the series that I have read--good book club pick good for discussion can't wait for next one--this one leaves many questions
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game was so fun &amp; addictive, I hated to see it end. Beautiful scenes, great graphics, &amp; very engaging. I purchased the full game &amp; it was well worth it...I've spent alot more than this on things that didn't last as long &amp; weren't nearly as entertaining. You've got yourselves a repeat customer so keep these great games coming! Thank you!
B008MEM24S|5.0|My 11 year old loves Phineas and Ferb so we got this instead of the Swampy one. We love the running commentary by Doofenshmirtz. He's fun to listen to while figuring out the correct path.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an awesome game I had you guys made it because it's better than temple run. I hope you guys who make a better game like this!
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I just couldn't get into this game. I liked Temple run and this is similar, but this just didn't catch my attention
B0060AY6FO|3.0|PD James should stick to detective mysteries. Not a compelling read. Interesting spin to build upon Pride and Prejudice setting and stories but the intrigue of a mystery never builds
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Played for a while steadily then got bored. Tired of waiting and not really getting anywhere. Could be better. Oh well!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like this one because I win almost as many times as I loose.  It is a very good game to play when needing to relax or waiting on someone or something.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I enjoy this game. I game it a 4 because it takes up too much of my life (and my husband's) We both play, but it's getting old for me.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Low usage and smooth graphics. Recommend to all.<br />Great alerts. I only have to charge my battery every 3days.<br />Awesome!
0783240287|5.0|My mom told be to buy a copy for her and her friend. The items shipped really fast. Its also a great movie!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|.the book was really really good . I did not expect link to be bitten. I think this book was better than the first but the first book was still really good
B003YL4LYI|5.0|At the beginning it was difficult to follow because of all the new characters he was introducing. But eventually I got into it. The detail that Martin uses to describe someone's outfit paints an excellent picture.<br /><br />I also enjoy his description of a meal, whether a rather simple meal or a 7-course meal. Especially since most of what we are dealing with is not something you find in a local 5-star restaurant, get my mouth starts watering.<br /><br />When reading a couple books at the same time, I usually can't wait to get back to Martin because his writing is head-and-shoulder above whatever else I am reading.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I might not normally buy a book like this, but I was turned on by the HBO series.<br /><br />I enjoyed the way he breaks chapters down - for the most part - by characters. He usually ends the chapter with a cliffhanger, which makes you want to cheat and skip ahead.<br /><br />I was not ready for him killing off characters I enjoyed. It actually depressed me when I realized I wouldn't be reading about them again.<br /><br />I also enjoy the way he seems to find something good in the villains and something dark in the heroes.<br /><br />The detail that Martin uses to describe someone's outfit paints an excellent picture.

B0091REZMW|4.0|good time sucker.. good graphics. the only thing is energy wears down fast. don't like having to pay to keep playing. but over all its fun.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Each character is so well developed that I had sympathy for and understood their respective viewpoints.  A real gem!
B00008PX8P|5.0|Excellent footage and sound.  Highly recommended for fans.  I have a projection theatre at home, and this rocks.  Amazing to see the band in their youth.
B00A2LFXVI|5.0|I loved the comic book. I loved the first movie. They did such a good job at staying true to the story. This is one of the best batman stories ever.<br /><br />*Note- This is not a kids movie, it is rated PG-13 for a reason, it's pretty graphic.
B003ITZBVS|4.0|I watched this without hearing anything about it before hand and it blew me away right from the beginning. It was full of action, suspense, and everything else Batman always brings to the table. An excellent addition to my collection of Batman movies.
B006MW3V6U|2.0|I love this show and started watching it on Amazon Prime since Netflix doesn't carry season 2. Unfortunately, the streaming stalled 4 separate times during the show and I had to refresh my browser each time to reset it. It was extremely disappointing and disruptive. I'm thinking twice about keeping my Amazon Prime subscription going...
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|This is the best James Bond - so far - looking forward to more of the same.  Lots of action and interaction.  Sorry to see one of the Bond family leave.  I have seen on the web that Daniel Craig has signed up for two more Bond movies - yeah!  Enjoy this one greatly!
B006M4F67A|4.0|This is a good timewaster, but I dislike the pyramid format because it is not clear which tiles are blocked.
1589949811|5.0|The game is amazing! Can't stop playing. There are so many ways you can play each quest, so it's always exciting. Can't wait to get some expansions.
B000I186FW|5.0|I have seen this movie about 5 times and I love it......very very moving.<br />It gives you something to think about.
1451648537|5.0|I knew a lot about Steve Jobs character from a friend who had worked at Apple. I loved the Apple products from the first Apple II. I was glad to read more about his nature. He truly seemed to have his finger on the pulse of both good design and well made products. What a combination! The author has been thorough in his exploration of a true entrepreneur and visionary. I cried when he died because of my appreciation for his devotion to quality and the loss of his huge talent. Highly recommend reading.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is fantastic. It's easy to use and does all the mathematical operations i ever need. Very highly recommended
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Great cover for the price. I love the color it is really easy to put on and take off. Great buy!
1423140605|4.0|The culmination of demigods from both Greek and Roman backgrounds finally unite in the third installment of the Heroes of Olympus series. Riordan has been building up to this for quite some time, with the first book telling the story of Jason and why he has no memory of ending up in Camp Half-Blood, the Greek camp for demigods. The second book was similar in that it told the events of the first book from Percy's perspective, who has somehow ended up at the Roman camp, Camp Jupiter.<br /><br />This book finally joins the two groups together as they attempt to thwart Gaea's plan to destroy Rome and wreak havoc on the mortal world. Riordan continues his trend of combining mythological people and events with modern-day characters that's both interesting and fun to read. If you enjoyed his Percy Jackson, the Kane Chronicles, or the previous Heroes books, you're sure to enjoy this one as well.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|in my opinion this is the best of the trilogy... hopeless romantic and the ending was fantastic!! after reading the first book was hesitant on reading the next two, but this book made it worth it!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I like it but the third is my favorite but of course to get the story you must read the first two!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|great book... I loved it all couldn't put it down!! I love how everything just unravels in a great and stunning way!
B009O2XY12|5.0|I absolutely love this game.  It is so very addictive!  Extra lives are quick to accumulate.  Would definitely tell others to get it!
B0093FNZT6|5.0|I loved this book so well writen I dont have a fear about dying sounds like it is a great place to go
B008JF8O9M|1.0|Free version did not work on Kindle Fire.<br />Found my Brother wifi printer type but would not even print test page.
B003YL4L0W|5.0|Jodi Picoult does another great job of dealing with a controversial issue. Beautifully written.  Both sides presented dealing with homosexuality.  The reader can make their own conclusions.  Highly recommend.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|I played the vinyl HUNDREDS and HUNDREDS of times in the 80s.<br /><br />Then did the cassette also in the 80s.<br /><br />Upgraded to CD in the 90s.<br /><br />Got the upgraded expanded version in the 2000s.<br /><br />I don't even know what to say.  I've been listening to this recording for 33 years.<br /><br />My top 5 CDS of all-time.  I might have listened to this recording 1,000 times total in all versions.<br /><br />I won't even give stand-out tracks because this is an absolute complete masterpiece.<br /><br />Just mind-boggling.<br /><br />Amazon is giving this away for $2.99 for the MP3?  HELLOOOOOOOO<br /><br />THAT is mind-boggling.<br /><br />This is a must in any serious collection.  No-brainer.
B001O54NKS|5.0|Beats their debut by a little. This CD Rocks. 80's style.<br /><br />The songs on here are amazing.<br /><br />Saw them live supporting Aerosmith in the late 80s and they were awesome live.<br /><br />Don Dokken's voice fits the songs perfectly and George Lynch's playing is incredible.<br /><br />Top 3 tracks:<br />It's Not Love (worth the price of the CD)<br />In My Dreams<br />Unchain the Night<br /><br />I love the whole CD but those 3 are the cream.
B004QX07G4|2.0|I like Ellen and hoped this book would be a funny read. Instead, I paid good money to read Ellen's rejected jokes file.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|I did not read the book so this was a surprising tale! Worth watching! A survival of the fittest story.
B009JZPH32|5.0|Of course Oliver Stone pulls out all the stops and this wild and deadly story is made credible with a great cast and narration by Blake Lively. It is a California story for sure!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that subway surf is an amazing game it is very addictive but fun!I recommend getting this game it is also good for when you are bored
B00A85EMVK|5.0|Considering that this movie was produced without 3D in mind, it's 3D effects were great. The movie is one of the best classics without 3D but it was even better with. I can't understand the problem a few people had with this edition of the movie, the 3D effect was very good with the system we have.. Great job. It definitely joins the other classics such as the Irobots and the Titanic.  Well worth the price..
B000IDEQTK|4.0|This was a pleasant movie.  Helen Hunt and Tom Wilkinson were very enjoyable to watch.  I wish they had been given more scenes together.  Tom Wilkinson's character Tuppy was delightful.  The dialogue was quite fun at times.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It is a cute story, It was sent promptly to my Kindle. I Liked the price, it met my expectations.
0765325950|5.0|Robert Jordan is sorely missed. However Brandon, does a remarkable job of finishing the series. I hope to read more from him.
B0026QC0YU|3.0|&#60;Contains spoilers&#62;.I did not like MI when it first was released, and still am disheartened by it today. It's a great spy movie, with imaginative scenes and stunts, and a fair amount of action. But what disturbs me, and has for some time now, is that Hollywood is always messing about with the legends and can't leave well enough alone. In this movie, the character Jim Phelps - for decades the &#34;brains&#34; behind the IMF - is made out to be the bad guy. You see similar treatments in other movies where the legends are changed from what we grew up with. For example, the newest Star Trek is replete with changes that alter the traditional timeline and kill off characters that weren't in the original series or movies. I guess my issue is with Hollywood, and not specifically this movie - this movie is just an example of Hollywood's attempt to corrupt us into thinking that there cannot be any distinctive Right or Wrongs in the World, just huge overlapping gray areas where Good Guys maybe aren't really Good, but Uncommitted. I awarded three stars for production value and the movie's overall slick presentation. If one were not aware of the storied history of the IMF, this would have been a great movie.
B000HL09SA|5.0|Very heart warming and wonderful movie for all ages...especially if you have ever know the love of a dog :)
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|My cell phone's built in alarm clock is much easier to use and understand, so I uninstalled it this Alarm Clock from my device.
0525953728|4.0|I wanted to learn more about the killing of bin Laden and what the SEALS had to deal with.  The title of the book tells it like it is.  I do not like that Mr. Obama has seemed to take credit for this assignment.  The SEALS are the cream of the crop.  Had it been just normal ops I don't think the outcome would have been the same.  There is a lot more to the store we have all been given.  I would recommend this read if you want to know all that went into this operation.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|I got this movie for my family and for my son (who had never seen it). It's very cute and we enjoyed the adult humor.
B00123B0L2|4.0|To begin, this is a very rare album I found out.  I don't know why because it's REALLY good, but sometimes good albums are often pushed aside especially because it was from 1989 when Elfman changed his career from band to film composer.  Yet he really utilizes strings and the waltz mode very well!  Although most of the songs are relatively short they are well-worth listening to and as a full album combine for a powerful score.  In my opinion, this is a great album and worth picking up because anyone who has watched the movie will almost be able to remember the parts especially if you're a fan like me.  Plus, it's only 5 dollars so you're not really breaking the bank here to get it!
0785163174|1.0|Unless you like your characters to look like ken and barbie dolls, you won't like John Romita Jr's art in this series and he does the majority of the issues in this collection. Olivier Coipel's art is great but is only present for three issues. As others said too, the story wasn't great either.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Disturbingly addictive. If you like logic puzzles you won't be able to put this down. A fantastic buy at twice the price of free.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I find the first very first year as interesting and you can see how Castle and Becket start jelling!!  I really enjoy watching their relationship grow!!
1616550414|1.0|The only reason to buy this is for the 'official chronology' section, which Nintendo only released because the internet figured it out already.  Go look around online and you can find out everything in this book without spending your money.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love this app. The ease of use is great. I can use it on my laptop, my cell phone and on my Nextbook. It gives me access to many many books from many sources. I recommend it to all of my friends and family.
B002GJT4Y6|5.0|This is a great version of this movie, and I would say it is needed for any collection. The new movie pack is coming out so if you want to buy THAT one I would wait, but if you buy all these saparatly then it is cheeper by like $50, but I think you end up getting less extra things that are in the big pack
B00992HA4Y|5.0|I hate Kristen Stewart! but Everyone else in this movie make it worth seeing! and this is just a cool version!
B002S0OBMS|5.0|I saw the recorded version and thought it was entertaining!<br />Just make sure you dont let it reuin the original Phantom for you! The music is good and the story &#34;OK&#34; but it is worth having if you like Ramin, and Sierra... which you better!
B00005JPD0|5.0|For how cheep this movie is on Amazon and Half, how can you NOT own it! Denzel is great and the movie really makes you think, make sure you see it more than once! It makes more sense that way too!
B001DHXT20|5.0|Its a good movie and that's what I was looking for. So I bought it mmmmmmmmmm nnnnnnnnnnnnn bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb cccccccccc fr
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|I loved this movie. gggggggggg hhhhhhhhhh fffffffffff sd aaaaaaaaaaaaa a GGGGGGGG HHHHHHHHHHHH JJJ JJJJ HHHHHHHHH TTTTTT FF VVVV V V
B003UYV08E|5.0|Great movie here I loved the first Iron Man, part wasn't as good but it was still really good. awesome
B005S9EKCW|4.0|Ok. So I thought this movie was actually pretty good. Was it the best? No. I think Lincoln was a much better-made movie. But given the scope of what Les Miz is, I think Tom Hooper did a really god job transitioning this iconic musical from stage to screen. Some of the issues I have are the same as others. But my question to those who gave one-star reviews, could you have done better? Let me know when you become an Academy Award-winning director. Or actor. Or Tony winning actor. This is the most decorated cast I have seen in a film in a long time. Until we have the experience or the privilege of being like the cast and crew of this movie, we can't really say that they were horrible. Well, I guess we can because everyone's entitled to their own opinion. But in my opinion, people who think they know better than the one's who made the film are pretty presumptuous. This movie had flaws, as every movie does. But it was way better than other movie-musicals like Hairspray and Mamma Mia. Chicago was a lot slicker and flashier, and the actors got to lip-synch to their recorded voices which might have all been auto-tuned. So for these actors to sing live and do it for months and months without having done that before, kudos to them. Overall, a very entertaining movie and I loved it. I am a Les Miz fan. I won't say I am the biggest. But I think this is a great adaptation of the musical and the novel. So four stars for me because it was well made and it made me feel like I was experiencing what the characters were experiencing. Bravo Tom Hooper and the cast of Les Miserables.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Invited another couple over, made popcorn and loved watching the great movie. Sat on the edge of my chair at the end even though I knew they made it out.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|It's a great series and keeps you in suspense. I never saw it when it aired and I love the prime membership.
B0027GGL6W|5.0|I injoyed the movie. I really did not like what happened to Little Walter that really broke my heart. I never really knew anything about Etta James, except for what my parents talk about. (they really loved her)  so I went on the internet to become familiar with her. She was just an absolutely Beautiful Woman.  (regardless of chemical addiction)  I read about her life and it was very heart breaking to me. All and All she made it through and as painful as it was for her. She was a total success...
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is my savior at work! Seriously, it passes so much time when I'm sitting at my desk. There are different trophies and little icons to win in each city you play in.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Don't start to watch unless you have lots of time - I was obsessed!!!  Loved every minute!  thank you for having season 2222
B0019M068O|5.0|What can I say.  I am an<br />ABBA fan.  Powerful, uplifting music.  Makes you want to get up and go!
B007SGM084|3.0|The trilogy is entertaining in terms of passing some time, but doesn't remotely hold a candle to the Story of O and similar works of that genre. I'm about three quarters of the way through and am getting bored. Hearing over and over how Ana is overawed by the wealth of her husband is really getting tiresome. I'll probably finish the book as maybe the last part of it is an improvement.
B002SR3T10|5.0|My husband wanted this for christmas and he just loves it . He can't figure out how he never saw this before.
B004LWZWGK|2.0|I'm not a hard-core Batman fan(atic), but the Dark Knight series had a grittier feel that the earlier Batman series did not -- and I like that.<br />This movie's plot seemed poorly organized, but maybe that is because of what I think is its major flaw -- PATHETIC AUDIO MIXING!<br />I have a true 5.1 digital surround, yet at low or high volume I could barely understand the dialogue. The background music was finely done, but completely out of balance with the voices.<br />As a person who dabbled in amateur audio mixing for about 5 years, I can say that it is despicable that a major studio release would allow such poor audio work.<br />Possibly the mix worked better in the theater than on the Blu-Ray -- I don't know to what extent they re-mix for Blu-Ray in this digital age.<br />Either the actors were mic'd poorly, or nobody bothered to work with the mic signals in post-production, or both, but there are many things that can be easily done that weren't,<br />both with the mic signals and with their balance with the music and effects signals in the final mix.<br />So maybe if I had not needed subtitles to know what was being said, the movie would have been less disappointing.<br />Anne Hathaway was the best thing about it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|At first I was def not to sue about this game, it's pretty difficult,  the faster you go the more your like, I can make it further. Great game
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it starts out easy, but the levels get progressively harder. children will love it and will find out something else that can be done each time they play it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a very easy and fun application. Young children to adults will enjoy this. I definately reccomend this game there are no graphic issues or glitches whatsoever and is definately worth taking the time to download because it does take a few moments.....totally worth it.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|a lot of fast action which makes a child think faster. remember what does different things and what to stay away from.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is way better than the first one.  I am so glad they came out with this one. Everyone should get this game. It is easy yet adicting and so much fun. GET THIS GAME NOW.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I was hooked by the first episode. Love that this period piece includes both the aristoctats and their servants. Great story, compelling characters.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The acting and setting in  this turn-of-the-century family drama is superb. I find it quite addicting and eagerly await the next episodes.
B00005JL96|5.0|Product as described, and most of all loved the price! A great great deal! Such a classic movie, thank you!
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Don't expect to get a triple A tittle on a tablet. With that said, this is a great game for someone with some time to kill once and again. Great graphics and good gameplay (if a bit repetitive).
B0000C9ZBW|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my son and he says it is very comfortable. The mesh strap is very smooth, a very handsome watch, not huge like many men's watches, very slim profile. Was delivered on time, quickly.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Good app to get.....It was free so I tried it and love it. Keeps you informed on how your battery is doing....how much time you have left to watch a movie...music....etc.
B007BRJYF2|4.0|This was a very cute game. I really enjoyed the graphics and the original Alice illustrations being used for jigsaw puzzles (although I really wish these were broken into more pieces). There was also a good amount of variety. There were hidden objects, point and shoot, bejeweled style games, slide puzzles and jigsaw puzzles.  Overall the game was pretty easy, but I still found it fun. I knocked off one star for the ease and shortness of the game. Only about an hour, maybe an hour and a half play time.
B001P1MZNI|5.0|This recording is perhaps the most desirable of Sinatra's live performances, one listen and you'll understand why.  Not only is is vocals tight but you'll hear his humor shine through with the dialog.  Couple this with Count Basie's Orchestra and you've got a 5 star winner and a must have for anyone who enjoys Sinatra or that big band sound.
B0012FHGCW|5.0|I don't normally like stories like this. But the directing really made me put some deeper thought into the story line. The way that it is pieced together adds to the enjoyment of the final product. A bit too much nudity for me though. Dont watch it with kids or your parents. There is alot of hippie interactions if you like those dayz.
B0042XA2U4|5.0|Holly Kennedy is a young Irish woman married to the love of her life, Gerry. Just getting ready to turn 30, they're planning children and a whole life that stretches out beyond the horizon. They're the envy of their circle of marrying or still single friends. Holly is the center of a warm, enveloping Irish family with loving mother and father and feuding brothers and sisters. A typical loving family.<br />  And then the unthinkable happens and an alien invades Gerry's brain. A loving, vital husband is made into a sick invalid and in a short time, he's buried. And Holly Kennedy is left alive when she doesn't want to be anymore.<br />  There is absolutely nothing new about this scenario - except one thing. Because people die every day. They leave behind husbands and wives and children. And no matter how loving and supporting friends and family are, one day they are going to go home. They are going to leave the survivor alone with ghosts and memories and regrets that can never be made right and questions that can never be answered.<br />  Except the gimmick in this story that makes it stand out is that Gerry was a moving and wise husband. He knew he wouldn't be around to help Holly make a new life without him. So he leaves her a series of letters with challenges, assignments and final words of encouragement. He has no way of knowing what will happen, but he leaves them with the faith that Holly will be able finally to move on.<br />  Death affects not only the next of kin. Gerry's parents,Holly's family and her friends and their spouses and loved ones. All of them react to Gerry's death and Holly's struggles. In the process she learns things she never knew about her family and her friends. She has adventures.She has to face the truth that some part of her wants to be with another man eventually, no matter how much it feels like she is betraying Gerry.<br />  And perhaps the hardest lesson she has to learn is something everyone knows deep down, which is that life goes on. People fall in love, and divorce, and get pregnant and find new careers and new lives and after awhile it's almost as if Gerry had never lived. He lives only in memories, and memories fade.<br />  This is a sad, funny, moving novel of death - and life. It would be easy to dismiss this as Irish  Chick-Lit about a trio of pretty young Irish lasses, partying, getting drunk, falling in love, having adventures and dealing with love and guys. But it's better than that - a whole lot better.n. People fall in love, and divorce, and get pregnant and find new careers and new lives and after awhile it's almost as if Gerry had never lived.

B005H9B44A|3.0|It was very predictable. There were a few funny spots though. Atleast the love story part of it was not drawn out. I watched the whole thing, hoping that it would get better....na, I just wanted to see Natalie Portman in a role other than in star wars. Don't waste your time unless you have a thing for Natalie Portman and brainless action with not too indepth plot.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|In my younger days JRPG's is all I would play but as the \\"multiplayer craze\\" took hold I found myself lose interest in games of this genre. Fast forward 10 years and I needed a killer game for my Vita which had been more of a media player for me than anything else. When I heard about persona 4 golden I had to give it a try I missed out on the first release for the ps2 and let me just say I am amazed. I have only had the game for a few days and will update this as I go but I've never lost 10 hours of time so quickly in my life. Think you can skip though and resuce NPC from the start slow down buddy you must actually work to lvl, build social experiences all the while being pushed by the story. Such a balance of spare time and story progression has not been seen imo since [[ASIN:B00005MANB Dark Cloud]] ; I havent even started on the amount of personas/fusion/skills etc.  Honestly buy this game download it however you must get a copy It is a must have for the VITA!
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I haven't finished reading it but it the book is anyway as good as the movie I will finish it as usual Nicholas Sparks make us laugh and cry
0446554995|5.0|Preston and Child have succeeded again in moving forward with panache the continuing, gothic saga of Agent Pendergast and his foils.  The novel immerses the reader in a world filled with offbeat characters, a Nazi cult, human genetic experimentation, murder, and bizarre mayhem.  It is a romp that keeps the reader engaged until the last page which promises yet another story will be told.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|I have not fully read the whole book when I get to I will let you know but right now I am hooked on James Patterson's books
B00B5HQL50|5.0|Bond appears a bit more vulnerable than in previous Daniel Craig versions. Fortunately, the skills he's acquired over the many years of training (and experience) display an image similar to a Navy Seal. While he does survive a rifle shot to the chest, causing him to plunge off a bridge a couple hundred feet into a river below, his new and numerous previous wounds show a battered body with many battle scars. His age and damaged physical condition display a vulnerable side. Though ultimately, this image is reflected only in those around him. The remaining half of this 2.5hr movie, Bond displays his somewhat diminished  athletic skills and even more tenacity to quiet any doubters.<br />Craig overcomes his wounds in typical James Bond fashion, employing an old-school flare. With few (if any) futuristic secret weapon toys from &#34;Q&#34;, Bond shows age and battle scars haven't slowed him down. Craig acts out a classic version of James Bond by overcoming over-whelming odds while beating the crap out of the bad guys, yet again.<br /><br />In my opinion, this is one of the best! Daniel Craig is a fantastic &#34;James Bond&#34;.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A true modern day hero.  Interesting read into the mind of a professional soldier.  How any politician thinks they should be paid more and have better benefits than the least of one of our military is beyond reason.
B006FTC6ZC|3.0|This is a movie to watch when your in the mood for slap-stick humor. My son thought it was hysterical. I don't think my 20 year old daughter would enjoy it though. Definitely not a chick-flick. Its male humor, all the way through.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much and I like how the train inspector is wearing a bunny suit and how you have to find all the eggs.
0792163710|5.0|Americans love Westerns.  The Winning of the West, especially the rough and tumble settlement of the Great Plains following the Civil War provides a common backdrop for many movies.  Most of these Westerns are only good for easy Saturday morning entertainment but this Western, this story is so interesting that it can take its place alongside the truly great movies of all time.<br /><br />On the surface, Shane is a classic tale of good vs. evil.  The \\"good\\" gunfighter, Shane (Alan Ladd) wears a white hat while the \\"bad\\" gunfighter, Wilson (Jack Palance) wears a black hat.  Shane fights for the Homesteaders who see themselves as a civilizing force, Wilson fights for the Ranchers-a wild west crew if there ever was one.  However, as the movie plays out the moral ambiguity of the situation becomes clear.<br /><br />In any conflict that leads to violence, there is always moral ambiguity.<br /><br />This ambiguity is emphasized through several means, chiefly is Alan Ladd as the title character.  If Shane was played by John Wayne it would be all too natural for Shane to knock out cowboy toughs and shoot down the antagonists, but with Ladd, Shane is a none too imposing figure.  The strength of Shane is masked by the very look of Alan Ladd.  Additionally, the moral ambiguity is emphasized by the continuous attempts by the Rykers to reason with the homesteaders.  The cattle baron's hard work is about to pay off with a \\"beef contract for the Reservation\\" and the interloping homesteaders have cut off his supply of water.  With his livelihood under threat, Ryker has no choice but to fight.<br /><br />Shane himself adds to the sense of ambiguity.  He simply shows up on the lead Homesteader Joe Starrett's farm and interjects himself into the conflict.  Indeed, Shane's presence is the catalyst for the escalating violence.  Shane himself is a further mystery.  He is an experienced gunfighter that says he wants to leave behind his violent past but instead joins in the conflict.

B004DSX5B6|5.0|This lived up to my expectations.  I bought it as a Christmas gift for my husband and he really likes it a lot.  It has many uses and many available choices of tools.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great show...can't stand Thomas but love the show and the rest of the cast.  Glad to see Matthew and Mary finally get together.
B007I1QUYE|4.0|Packaging is Ok but not great.  Blu-Ray transfers are more than adequate.  Fast shipping. There are a few different Blu-Ray collections out there and I am happy I went with this one.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|I normally don't care much for the Mission Impossible franchise. I watched this because I saw it was directed by Brad Bird, of Pixar fame. The story is easy to follow, and the movie is of course a lot of eye candy. I think Tom Cruise looks a little more mature than in the past, which is nice.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|This was by far the best of these DC one-shot releases.  Goes great with the Dark Knight Returns Part 1.  You absolutely need to own this.  The special features are much more expanded than part 1.  I highly recommend this.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I love that I was able to order this directly to my phone. No complaints and loving the music! Vive Les Miserables!
159562015X|1.0|This book was great and was in great condition.  The only problem is that the access code to do the evaluation to determine my strengths was ripped out of the book!  That was the whole reason I bought the book, thus the bad rating.
1439181780|5.0|Thank you Rhonda! I've been practicing and now giving love to what I want is becoming more habitual which has massively positively impacted my life.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie, but the book was better.  I think reading the book after seeing the movie brings the characters more to life.
0307591549|5.0|This book is brilliant. I've applied it all over my life and am constantly using the ideas in this book when I work with my clients! Thanks Shawn!  Also google Shawn Achor TEDx Bloomington and watch the video - he's an amazing speaker.
B0059XTUVI|5.0|This movie starts with the sight of a very old person hobbling along the streets to buy a pint of milk. From there we get a mix of an imagined(?) husband and flashbacks to glory, yet the movie compels the viewer along with a powerful story line that surpasses the confusion.<br />The impersonation by Meryl Streep is completely believable; and, in the flashbacks, matches in beauty the pictures of the real Margaret in power. This director is a genius, and Meryl Streep as well. And Prime Minister Thatcher herself---she's one for the ages.
B00008QSA5|5.0|The mix of songs and talent on this album really makes it unique.  Obviously, a tremendous group of musicians working different styles and arrangements
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The calculator fills the entire screen of my 7&#34; Kindle Fire HD which makes it very easy to use.<br />The display shows all the steps you have made in your calculation so far in small font underneath the current calculation step.<br />IT'S FREE!
B0091QS88K|5.0|my two year old loves this game! it is easy to understand and play! only had two items to make
B00992CF6W|5.0|I'll try to be as honest as I can without pissing people off...<br /><br />First, I have to admit, the game is HIGHLY addictive, the amount of creativity that the user has on her/his hands is incredible, even for a \\"pocket version\\". I know two 9yr olds whom are currently trying to build a train station (on the console version), based on our local train system, that's how much you can create with Minecraft, if not, visit youtube and see for yourself.....<br /><br />But, and this is where I run the risk of pitch forks and stones...this game is NOT for those whom like gaming eye candy. As good as it is, the game lacks the polished graphics of high end budget tittles, but for good reason, it is after all an indie game. It looks like an 8-bit game, even with massive projects such as the recreation of Bioshock's Rapture city.<br />So, having said that, if you are looking for eye candy, stay away and very far from this game, because no matter how much you \\"try\\" to like it, you may not after all and will end up writting an unfair review.<br /><br />If you on the other hand, like a challenge, have lots of imagination and don't care about graphics, then by all means, get some tiger balm for your thumbs, because they'll be sore from playing MineCraft so much.<br /><br />Here come the stones..... :)~
B002APU580|5.0|Austen lovers will take to this version of a beloved novel.  Kiera Knightley is an excellent Lizzie Bennett and the cinematograhpy is georgous.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I've played OMGPOP's games through Gaia before, as well as this game via PC and mouse. And I have to say this is definitely addicting on my kindle, a significant difference with finger than mouse. It makes the game a lot more fun.<br /><br />To quickly cover the game, you are given three choices of words to draw and your opponent tries to guess it and vice versa. You earn coins with correct guesses that you can spend on bombs (which take away the wrong letters or give you new words) or different colors too draw with. You can connect with Facebook to pay against friends or find random opponents to play.<br /><br />Overall, this is an addicting game that I highly recommend you get. Internet connection is required.
B008AX1HD8|4.0|Good to finally find out what happened to Harry in Australia after the constant references in the later books. You can see that Nesbo has developed Harry's character over the last few books. A good read all the same.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|There are quite a few different games that will definitely keep you occupied, and with getting points for winning games to buy more games, it won't bore. Some of the games include air hockey and snake. I really like this game.
B0076DELIG|5.0|In true spirit, Harry Bosch comes through.  I had a hard time putting the mystery down.  Love the Harry Bosch series by Michael Connelly.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This is a Facebook app, so I'm pretty sure it's self explanatory.<br /><br />This came preloaded into my kindle fire and works fine. The only issue I have is downloading times, but I think I can account that to my internet speed. However, messaging works really fast, as well as updating my status, regardless of the strength of my internet connection. But it works a lot better than trying Facebook through Silk.
B0047WJ12K|4.0|This was a real thriller--kept you riveted to the story all the way through it. It takes you deeper and deeper into a dangerous level of the dream world--a level from which you may never return. What's real...and what isn't?
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Outstanding, exciting, and entertaining.  It follows book 1 of the same title fairly closely.  Very good intertwined story line.  It makes for high anticipation for season 2.
B0094K1PW4|4.0|Super 8 is a very enjoyable and entertaining movie. Get your popcorn and soda before the movie starts because you won't want to miss a thing. It is an engaging and riveting story line, with lots of action, great special effects, thrills and chills. It's a fun movie to watch for families with older children. So, sit down, put your feet up, and enjoy!
B0000028M7|1.0|I bought this cd by Alice In Chains as a gift. They loved it but I didn't. Not my kind of music.
B001OGWY1W|4.0|This was an outstanding Batman movie. I had been told by some that it was very dark, and I agree. The Joker was truly a dark and evil foe. Well done--lots of action and great special effects. My family really enjoyed it.
B009ZE27US|1.0|it is a fun toy for a while but it is just that a toy, i am tired of it now
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|My family really enjoyed this movie.  It was a good Disney movie, lots of action, good story line and special effects. The ending left us waiting eagerly to see the sequel that surely would be coming to theaters soon. I presumed the sequel was about ready to release as the DVD came out in 2011. So I googled it and discovered that the project has been shelved--no sequel is planned. So, be aware that this movie ends as a bit of a cliff-hanger. For those desiring to know what happens next, I discovered that this is part one of a book series called the Lorien Legacies written by Pittacus Lore. The sequel is called \\"The Power of Six.\\" You can buy the complete book series here on Amazon.

B000FC12Z0|5.0|Ms. Christie does her usual magnificent job of building the suspense until the final gathering of the suspects. Poirot, once again shows his humanity in letting M.

B007HACDLK|5.0|The twists and turns in the book kept me reading. Once again Flynn has made a book that is hard to stop reading.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|My whole family, watches this movie every Christmas when we all get together from different places.  Unfortunately, this past Christmas we had trouble finding it playing on T.V. so I decided to buy it.  I'm so glad I did.  The colorized version is the best colorization I have ever seen, and my grandchildren will like it much more in color.
B00993FEUK|5.0|Great movie...for older kids and adults. My 3 year old loves the movie Coraline, but I think this movie would be a bit too scary. But, my husband and I liked it!

B000SEIK2S|5.0|Really enjoyed this book! I love sci fi and I am glad I read this book before The Human Division 1,2,3 etc. (although this is not necessary to appreciate the rest of the books). Good idea and interesting characters. Looking for more from John Scalzi.
B003XQG0JI|4.0|This wasn't the easiest CD to find, but well worth the hunt. Hate websites that require minimum characters to submit
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Well live by the gun die by the gun. I had many mixed feelings about chris and the book. I liked the training deployments battles and honesty. They did a lot of stupid. Things outside o<br />battle in their personal lives.

0802473156|5.0|I am so happy this book came into our lives. It changed the way I listened to what made my son feel loved and to honor that so that I could fill up his love tank easily. It took the guessing out of the equation and stopped me from feeling hurt when he didn't want to exchange hugs with me. In addition, as I filled up his love tank with small acts of service (his love language), he naturally gave me more hugs (my love language). We started when my son was about 10 years old and have continued throughout his life. I love this book. April Shoemaker, Empowering Parenting Coach, [...]
B0096PAA6E|4.0|Gary Clark, Jr. has already acquired the title of \\"Savior of the Blues\\". Some might say it's an untimely bravura but listening to Blak And Blu and his music in general it's expedient to say Gary Clark, Jr. is capable of changing Blues direction.<br /><br />This young guy already has his own sound and the sound is different, unique, and genuine.<br /><br />To give this work a color, it's black, the mood is sad, pop elements present, not an easy listening for callow fans, not a Blues album in its entirety but leaves impression of the Blues, the new Blues.<br /><br />This work could be referred as multiple genres album with strong Blues influence or otherwise defined, as a desire to stay within the boundaries of Blues influenced by the commercial interest.<br /><br />pastblues.com

B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I started the word and the dictionary gave me the closest options (in the case where you are not sure how to spell-this is great).
B00AFROVQC|2.0|It was an okay read, but very predictable with one dimensional charaters. I found myself skimming to get through it only to discover that it had a cliffhanger ending with no resolution to any of the story lines. I prefer book series where each book tells a story that builds on the previous ones but also can stand on its own.
B008XCJ03K|5.0|If this album only had the first two songs it would be worth buying, but you get 16 tracks total, each one possessing something special.
B0010V4TZU|2.0|Bought the CD based on one song that I heard on radio.  Note to self - do not do that again!  Rest of the CD just wasn't that interesting to me.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|After seeing this, it's hard to believe we thought the Batman movies from the 90s were good. Great visuals and good story with an unexpected twist. Definitely worth watching.
B0068FYZIO|5.0|amazing movie, first time i watched Schindler's List I was 10 years old; I actually thought it was real; like a documentary.
0307887960|3.0|Dr. Dukan makes a compelling case for the diet plan. I even went to his website and read all the exciting experiences of his followers and patients. I managed to stay on this diet for five weeks. I lost 6 lbs within the first 3 weeks and then plateaued. Thats approximately the same amount of weight I would have lost on an average diet plan. I am not a big meat eater, which you have to be to enjoy and follow this diet. Also, I can not begin to describe how uncomfortable I felt due to the low amount of fiber you are afforded at the beginning of the diet. I think you get the point. I attempted this diet at the beginning of the summer. I realized that I would never be able to stick to this diet plan since I would not be able to enjoy fruit, especially in season mangos and pineapples.  I never recommended this diet to anyone.
B004LROUNG|2.0|Disappointing narration from John... Hero of the story is a hero only for the last 10+ chapters...<br /><br />I continued reading with the hope things will get better or pacier, but was wrong.

B009CPJHY4|4.0|This one was worth watching. It kept you interested without having the violence and vulgarity. It was a good movie.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I bought this book because of all the interest in the story.  The plot and characters are stupid.  No offense to the millions that have enjoyed the entire series.  I suggest you just purchase or rent porn, less time consuming.
B005LAII12|1.0|I thought it was a dumb, vulgar and a waste of money and time.<br />I am a Mark Wahlberg fan, but was very disappointed that he would stoop to doing such a dumb movie.

B00B4Z5J92|4.0|The stories behind the music (and the music industry) are what music lovers crave.  It's not enough to hear the music, we want to memorize the words to every song - including the obscure &#34;B-side&#34; cuts.  (Remember when singles had a B-side?  Then you're the right age to appreciate this documentary!)  The story of the sound board at Sound City and musicians NEEDING to record there because of it is a part of rock history.<br /><br />The only knock on the film - get this - is the sound editing.  Whaaaat?  Set the volume for hearing the dialogue and when the music cuts in you'll get the &#34;head in the speakers&#34; effect.
0062082353|5.0|this was a very good book it is ashamed we lost him at a young age  thank goodness for men like him
0812982622|5.0|I've tried to write a review for this book several times, but every time I start thinking about it, my brain starts spinning off in a million directions.  Should I tell readers that this is one of those rare novels that manages to affect you more viscerally than a great non-fiction book on the same topic can?  Because it does.  Should I tell them that the story, while imaginative and clearly fictional, is based on a massive amount of research, and uses the storyline to illuminate the various ways that the people of North Korea are controlled?  Should I mention that the contrasting norms between America and North Korea, as highlighted in the diplomatic mission chapters, really made me look around and take stock of what is right and wrong in the US? How about the lengths characters went to, just to survive in horrific gulags, and the way that made me wonder about my own will to live if I were somehow forced into such unrelenting misery?  Should I talk about the great interest in North Korea that this book has sparked in me, and the other books and articles I've read since, to learn more about this reclusive nation?<br /><br />Or maybe the one thing that really kept me up at night:  knowing how imaginative the author is, and how much research he put into this book, after each new tidbit of insight into life in North Korea was thrown my way, I always had to wonder - is this based on reaseach or imagination?  Is this really a nation where no husband or wife can trust each other enough to say that maybe, just maybe, North Korea isn't the envy of all other nations? Is this really a place where mass suicide is better than imprisonment?  Is this really a place where people are scooped up off the city streets to \\"volunteer\\" at harvest time?  Do people really wake up in the morning to such blatant propaganda being piped directly into their apartments, warning them of the ever-imminent attack from America?  Is this really a place where a grown adult and army veteran might never once have seen a doctor?<br /><br />Having had the pleasure of hearing the author speak, I'm afraid the answer to most of those questions (and many more) is:  yes, there is such a place.  The laughable images of Kim Jong-Il and the impressive shows of military might that we usually see in the news, which inform our understanding of this hermit nation, will now be supplemented in my mind by my new understanding of just what life is like for the average North Korean.  This is not a book for the faint-of-heart, but it is a great and enlightening book that made me think more than just about any other book I can recall.once have seen a doctor?<br /><br />Having had the pleasure of hearing the author speak, I'm afraid the answer to most of those questions (and many more) is:  yes, there is such a place.

B005LRWRZ8|4.0|Sure, Megadeth might be getting up there in age. After all, they formed after Dave Mustaine (who is now fifty whole years old) was fired from Metallica in 1983, and debuted two years later in '85. So, that's twenty-six years and counting of existence for the mighty Megadeth. But they continue to prove time and time again, with album after solid album, that they are still as dangerous as ever. Indeed, groups like Megadeth, Slayer, Testament, and the aforementioned Metallica (and even groups that are older than that -- i.e. Motorhead, Anvil, Heaven & Hell, Iron Maiden, etc.) can still shred the pants off you -- and most new heavy metal bands for that matter. `Deth's thirteenth studio full-length, 2011's very appropriately entitled \\"Thirt3en,\\" is but one more piece of irrefutable evidence of this fact.<br /><br />Following a brief lineup hiccup after \\"Endgame\\" was released in 2009, the current collection of musicians -- which includes Mustaine, rhythm guitarist Chris Broderick, drummer Shawn Drover, and bassist Dave Ellefson -- just might be Megadeth's best lineup in quite some time. Together, they traffic in truckloads of great riffs, technically-proficient leads, and amazing solos.<br /><br />Opener \\"Sudden Death\\" begins with well-over fifty seconds of epic, wailing soloing and guitar harmonies. A strong, grumbling bass line and galloping drum beat kick in, as do Dave's classic vocals. But still, this song is mostly about phenomenal guitar work, as the six-stringers are heard trading-off blistering, screaming, and technically-impressive solos off and on throughout. \\"Public Enemy No. 1\\" serves as a suitably strong follow-up, though, because its hooky, crunch-filled gallop and memorably stirring, sing-songy choruses that remind of Megadeth's \\"Rust In Peace\\" days. The guitar work is also reminiscent of that 1990 album, as the axe-duo takes turns uncorking one excellent, and very ripping solo after another. \\"Whose Life (Is It Anyways)?,\\" then, is a fairly blistering cut of old-school-esque thrash/speed metal that boasts exceptional bass work (including a thundering bass intro, and a steady, flowing bass groove), and a bunch of shredding solos.<br /><br />\\"We The People\\" is, as its title implies, a political jab whose epic, wailing solo work almost overshadows its interesting, pissed-off, right winged lyricism. The subsequent \\"Guns, Drugs, & Money\\" is like the above-described \\"Public Enemy\\" in that it evokes \\"Rust In Peace\\" very much, what with its catchy, galloping rhythm, really memorable choruses, and exceptional, dazzling solo work. \\"Never Dead\\" also has an old-school thrash vibe about it on account of it being filled with blistering speedster riffing, and some surprisingly hefty double bass thudding that gives the song some extra pop, punch, and heaviness. It finds Mustaine ripping out another excellent, sweeping, shredding-yet-simultaneously technical solo (which lasts upwards of twenty seconds), too.<br /><br />\\"New World Order\\" is a more restrained chugger with nice, Iron Maiden-stylized twin-guitar harmonies, a catchy, call-and-response vocal refrain, and more piercing melodic soloing. \\"Fast Lane\\" ties a crunchy, galloping riff slice together with a pair of shredding, dive-bombing solos. And \\"Black Swan\\" feels almost like an extension of \\"Fast Lane,\\" as plenty of soaring, wailing, epic-sounding solo flights come screaming in throughout the song, a near power metal-worthy anthem. \\"Wrecker,\\" though, is a more fiery thrasher that boasts a hooky, headbanging thrash groove. This tune is also of note on a lyrical front, as its subject matter centers around a former Dave Mustaine girlfriend (who, as \\"Wrecker\\" leads you to believe, was a complete homewrecker).<br /><br />\\"Millennium Of The Blind\\" is a more restrained piece that trades off heavy, chunky riff crunch with spectral harmonies and clean, soaring solo flights. A strong, propulsive bass line is heard grumbling away beneath the rhythm throughout \\"Deadly Nightshade,\\" a songthat is heavier and speedier than most, and one that plenty more great and fiery melodic soloing. The album then concludes on a much more subdued note, as \\"13\\" is a nicely textured and colorful set closer with pretty acoustic flourishes. The song eventually picks up speed and heaviness, but at the same time, it remains a concertedly more restrained piece.

B004LROUW2|5.0|1Q84 does not fall into any one genre other than epic tale that will stand the test of time. The book is beautiful and deceptively simple. The characters are like the different instruments in an orchestra. I don't often remember a book 10 minutes after I finish reading it but it has been 2 years and thinking of the story makes me feel like I have fallen back into a great adventure.
B00005AR3G|5.0|It came in a new package without scratches. My girls watched it over and over until it finally gave out. But it kept them occupied and out of things for a good week!
B007UW9WOQ|3.0|Reviewing a documentary movie is a tricky thing. Sometimes we are not sure which we should be reviewing, the film itself or the subject it deals with. My review is strictly about the way the film presents the subject matter, an octogenarian sushi mater Jiro Ono and his sons, Yoshikazu Ono and Takashi Ono. To fully understand the film, however, I think to know a few things about the director would be helpful.<br /><br />David Gelb's film has an interesting title \\"Jiro Dreams of Sushi,\\" but you will not learn much about sushi itself. One sushi restaurant is not enough to introduce the long and rich history of sushi. The light-weight film is most effective when showing the conflict between the father/master and the son/pupil. No wonder director David Gelb, son of Peter Gelb - general manager of the Metropolitan Opera in New York City - is interested in this aspect of their relationship.<br /><br />So far, the film is good. But the director seems too busy making beautiful images of sushi (accompanied by beautiful soundtrack including Philip Glass), avoiding asking pointed questions. Hasn't the name of \\"Jiro\\" become too much for his sons, especially the elder one Yoshikazu-san, who will succeed the flagship Ginza restaurant? One interviewee predicts difficulties the restaurant will have to face, but that is not enough.<br /><br />Some may naturally think: Is Jiro's sushi (30,000 yen a course) is worth the price? If so, what makes it so? Food writer Masushiro Yamamoto talks about Jiro. Unlike Anton Ego of \\"Ratatouille,\\" who is ready to \\"thrive on negative criticism,\\" Yamamoto continues to praise Jiro's sushi. Maybe he does it too much. But he does not make much attempt to convince with more detailed descriptions. (In 2003 Yamamoto wrote a book about Jiro Ono, and it seems that the food critic have been a regular customer.)<br /><br />After all, instead of looking beyond it, \\"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\\" only embraces the widely-accepted image of sushi master, or any master, as someone who has been dedicated his life to the art. The words of Jiro-san and his sons, guarded and at times evasive, sound more like tatemae than honne. \\"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\\" certainly serves as a sort of guidebook to the sushi culture and the masters, but not as an in-depth look into the world they live in.
0425263908|5.0|I was weary about reading this series since it was compared to 50 Shades. I thought \\"I doubt it could come close\\". I was wrong! It's so much rawer and emotional...I highly recommend this series!!
B009UX2YAC|2.0|As mentioned in other reviews, it is not uncommon that some of the pictures have nothing to do with the word you are guessing. Be aware that this is essentially a demo; once the words get difficult, you will need to purchase the full version to have access to hints (and you will need them at times if you play much beyond the 20th level or so).
0425263916|5.0|I Loved this book, I cried, I laughed and I was on the edge of my seat!! If you loved 50 Shades this series is right there but rawer!! I recommend BIG time!!

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved this book!!! Couldn't put it down. Probably my favorite Sparks book, although I seem to say that after many of his books, this one is very good. Highly recommend it to all Sparks fans.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Great story full of drama and suspense with a touching love story. I especially liked the way Sparks tells the story from multiple view points, especially that of the violent husband. A good read, but not as good as some of Sparks best work like the Notebook.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Enough said with the above, please accept my approval of product as stated and consider me a fan of this film.
B00AHTYGRW|4.0|I don't usually go out of my way to see political thrillers. If I catch them on a lazy Sunday afternoon, I'll end up liking most of the ones I watch. &#34;Argo&#34; is one of those movies I would have passed up watching had it not been for one catch. The idea of the government using the making of a fake space / fantasy film to free hostages from Iran intrigued me. Once again, I'm very glad I listened to my instincts and took it in.<br /><br />In 1979, six Americans are put in hiding by the Canadian Embassy when the U.S. Embassy is raided in Iran by militants. Everyone else in the building is taken hostage. The U.S. government decides to take the unconventional advice of CIA operative Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) to get the six diplomats out of the country. He will enter Iran and smuggle them out as a group of filmmakers scouting for shooting locations for a fake science fiction / fantasy film entitled &#34;Argo.&#34;<br /><br />Ben Affleck continues to surprise me. He's always done his own thing in Hollywood. He'll do smaller films playing less conventional characters like &#34;Dazed and Confused,&#34; &#34;Mallrats,&#34; and &#34;Chasing Amy.&#34; The next thing you know he's taking the lead in blockbusters and popcorn flicks such as &#34;Armageddon,&#34; &#34;Daredevil,&#34; &#34;Pearl Harbor,&#34; and &#34;The Sum of All Fears.&#34; Affleck's had his share of stinkers and received some unwanted attention in the tabloids as well. What actor hasn't?<br /><br />One thing Affleck has done is prove he's a versatile talent in Tinseltown and isn't going away any time soon. He won an Oscar for his &#34;Good Will Hunting&#34; script and continues to collect awards for &#34;Argo.&#34; The movie is nominated for an Oscar for &#34;Best Picture&#34; and it deserves the honor.<br /><br />&#34;Argo&#34; appealed to me in so many ways. I was born in 1972 and was completely caught up in &#34;Star Wars,&#34; &#34;Star Trek,&#34; and &#34;Planet of the Apes&#34; fevers. A movie based in that time period about people making a fake sci-fi movie as a front to save hostages is captivating.<br /><br />Add to that the fact that award-winning &#34;Planet of the Apes&#34; makeup artist John Chambers helped the government get the hostages out of Iran. I remember seeing the news broadcasts about the hostage situation as a boy, but I didn't understand what was going on at the time. The whole event is interesting to learn about.<br /><br />The audio and video transfer for the Blu-ray version of &#34;Argo&#34; will please consumers. The picture is clean with well-balanced color. The 5.1 surround sound mix immerses the viewer in the atmosphere of each scene.<br /><br />There are quite a few interesting bonus features included. Audio commentary for the feature is provided by director Ben Affleck and writer Chris Terrio. &#34;Picture in Picture: Eyewitness Account&#34; contains interviews with the survivors of the Iran hostage crisis, President Jimmy Carter, Tony Mendez, Mark Lijek, Bob Anders, Cora Lijek, Kathy Stafford, Lee Schatz, USMC hostage Al Golacinski, and others involved in the events. Four featurettes entitled &#34;Rescued from Tehran: We Were There,&#34; &#34;Absolute Authenticity,&#34; &#34;The CIA and Hollywood Connection,&#34; and &#34;Escape from Iran: The Hollywood Option&#34; are included as well.<br /><br />&#34;Argo&#34; is an exciting political thriller which will have you white-knuckled and gripping the edge of your seat. Director Ben Affleck did a great job keeping up the suspense and pacing in the film. Even though you know how it's going to end, you are still nervous for the characters as you watch. That's just good filmmaking in my book.in that time period about people making a fake sci-fi movie as a front to save hostages is captivating.<br /><br />Add to that the fact that award-winning &#34;Planet of the Apes&#34; makeup artist John Chambers helped the government get the hostages out of Iran.

1846556007|5.0|Another great Nesbo writing (which explained a few things since I had already read all of his others) but now that I'm caught up, I can't wait for more.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Love this show.  Best on TV.  Would recommend to anyone.  Not for kids.  Too much gore.  Can't wait to see what season 4 brings.
B002M2N9JI|5.0|If you are not a shallow Hank, then you'll know that Elly (La Roux) is a great singer and makes great music.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love it! Fun simple game for a 3 yr old on up! It is something fun and simple and doesn't frustrate my kids or take hours to play.
B004SIP8W0|4.0|Loved the storyline.  The cinematography definitely showed it was an old move.  I ordered for my teenage son who view it in school and loved it.
B00003CXA6|1.0|Got this to show my students and after 20 minutes of straight dialogue, no action, I was so bored I decided against it.  I am sure there is value but I didn't have the patience to find it so I was sure my 13-year-olds wouldn't either!

B004EPZ03O|5.0|Got this for my 3-year-old as a big-brother gift to watch while I was in the hospital giving birth.  He loves it and it is nice to have a video that I don't hate after watching 300 times :).
B000NY12LO|1.0|Did not enjoy this book at all.  It drug out so bad, too simplistic and the &#34;twist&#34; waited to reveal itself until the very end and then it just ended.  For what the story was about, it was written poorly.  Usually I like Jodi Piccoult, this was one of her weaker books.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|I absolutely loved Flight.  I began watching it thinking it would be 'ok' and ready for the usual Hollywood action movie.  What it was instead was a deeply moving introspective into the mind of a very complex character played perfectly by Denzel Washington.  An EXCELLENT film.
B003TQKVGU|1.0|This book started off good, but then went into some very CHEESY details and accounts of people who tried the subconscious mind tricks.  (for example - numerous examples of people thinking hard about winning the lottery and waking up with Ed McMahon at their door... or overcoming cancer by thinking about it hard enough).  Not convincing at ALL.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am so hooked on this series. At first I had doubts but now I can't stop reading, even keeping me up till 2am.
B00003JRCQ|4.0|You can pretty much guess what I'm going to write here based on the title I've provided. Persuasion, in some respects Austen's best novel, receives a refined but honest treatment here, with none of the superficial glamor that has afflicted others. The acting is strong, the costuming believable, and the grime and disheveled look of the people a nice contrast to Stately Georgian Manors.<br /><br />I have only one negative to note: the out of place, easy listening piano noodling that occurs at intimate moments throughout. It's as though somebody read that this was supposed to be an autumnal novel (and it is), and thought this had to be italicized, underscored, and boldfaced. At the very least, if that's what the director and producer wanted, they could have gotten some Mozart or at least pseudo-Mozart to reflect this; instead, they chose something that breaks the carefully crafted period sense of the visuals and sounds.<br /><br />I can't say everyone is going to be as sensitive as I am to the music in a film--and that's good. Everybody should be different, and approach such things with their own preferences. I can only state how I feel about this. It's still a damn fine adaptation, and I would recommend it to anyone. Just keep my reservation in mind, if you're the kind who consciously listens to the background music when taking in a movie.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|made mom very happy. its great to sit down and enjoy a classic like this with family or friends. the story is still gripping even years later. recommend to anyone wanting to watch a good clean classic family type movie.
B001P1MZNI|1.0|I'm not a big fan of Sinatra but I like a few of his songs and it was an opportunity to hear him with Count Basie.  I found his onstage persona kind of offensive and annoying and it really detracted from his performance.  The whole Las Vegas lounge atmosphere was also a minus.  Overall, not something I'm going to be listening to but it only cost a couple of bucks and I may keep a cut or two where he's not talking.  I'd probably prefer one of his studio albums.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I got this application for my son because he's a horse living child. I recommend this application for animal lovers of all kinds.
B0080MPUUK|5.0|I enjoyed watching this Woody Allen film from the 1980s very much. It was a slice of the past I had forgotten about.
B009KHCT94|3.0|I didn't realize Netflix had this for free so I used up some Instant Video Credits I had, not a complete waste but kind of an odd movie.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|I love old RPGs like Final Fantasy 3, Secret of the Stars, Chrono Trigger. This doesn't quite match up to those (well maybe Secret of the Stars, but that game is classic), but it is definitely a fun RPG with a turn by turn battle system and plenty of stats strategies. It even has a &#34;job system&#34; which is awesome.<br /><br />One of the downside is that anyone familiar with these types of RPG will likely find the game a bit too easy.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I'd never heard of this show and thanks to some Amazon instant video credit watch an episode and I'm hooked!<br /><br />Very interesting characters a break from the traditional super hero shows.

B00B2166BS|5.0|I was wondering what the port on my Nexus 10 was for.  I got my answer when they came out with this charging cable. It clings to the tablet with a magnet. Fast and easy. I bet there will be more charging stations using this port in the future. I'll be watching for them.
B008WCP2PG|3.0|I purchased this movie because I found it for $3 dollars and I thought it would be good but I was very disappointed. Although some parts were interesting overall I would give this movie a 4/10 because of the storyline. t has great actors but the storyline was not well developed and interesting at some points within the movie.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good bond movie and a rush of action/adventure! This was a great movie because it keeps you on your feet, the audio and video playback are excellent. The bad guy in this movie was played to perfection, he is really creepy and scary. I personally thought the bad guy in the last bond movie (Quantum of Solace) wasn't scary at all, so that was a good little addition. Check it out!
B00AYLTMMM|4.0|I have to preface this by saying I saw the documentary about Mark before watching this. It was done with him telling his own life's story and it compelled me to watch this film.<br /><br />This movie is very touching and also disturbing. It's hard to watch how one person has to bear their soul to people who just don't get what it's like to have to depend on others for everything, whether they want to or not.<br /><br />However, the film gets quite detailed in showing how Mark goes forward trying to overcome the barriers put in place by able-bodied society. He is also portrayed as a man who knows he has been infantalized and has to some extent internalized this, making himself doubt whether he is ready for carnal knowledge.<br /><br />Although Helen Hunt does well as the sex surrogate, this whole line is a fabrication...it never happened this way, as those who know Mark will attest. She supposedly is very professional in what she does until she works with a man who has disability, so now she magically has inappropriate feelings!?<br /><br />The most troubling thought I have about this film deals with a problem I find with many films that portray persons living with disability: WHERE are the actors who are living with disability??? Why must we watch a whole parade of actors receive awards for the &#34;courageous&#34; way they played the part of a person living with disability????????<br /><br />Now that I've gotten that out of my system, I am glad the topic of this movie is put out there. There are many people living with disability through no choice of their own are kept from experiencing the act of having sex or making love because the puritans in charge of them would say they have no need for that. (Working with people who have disability for many years, I can vouch for this one.) Time will tell if anything beyond this Hollywood romanticism of disability film will actually happen. For Mark's memory, I hope it does.

Responsive controls, crisp graphics, qwirky sound effects and a consistent theme makes this a 5 star game!<br /><br />I'll be sure to play the sequel once I finish this game! Best of all, it's free! :o
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I can not wait for the 3rd book to come out.  I really like all the characters in the book and hopefully it won't get all mushy in book three like 50 shades did.
B003G8Y4QO|4.0|I was an avid fan of David Tenant so I was very sad when he left, but Matt Smith is wonderful. He is very funny as the Doctor and completely adorable, and there is a wonderful plot line for this season. There are hints to the overall conflict of the season in many episodes and it wraps most of them up in the season finale, well done.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Not again?  But yes, there is another game that is addictive as well as \\"cute \\".

It'll hold your \\"fun attention \\" for sure!

0762445262|5.0|Love it! It's just right! Both my son and my friend (big time fans) think this is the coolest thing ever to keep on their nightstand.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|The book is a very simple read with very straight forward writing, not a lot of fluff.  Chris wrote a very detailed, concise and honest account of some of the more important aspects of his life including childhood, early adulthood and the desire to be involved in the protection of forces in the conflict in the middle east.  He is very matter of fact about those experiences and I think that is why it is so important that every person in America should read this book.  It does not matter if you believe in the conflict or not, Chris's approach to writing this book is very non apologetic about his feelings, dedication to the troops and hate for the groups of people who want to kill Americans and destroy our way of life.  I think it should be required reading for all secondary age school children in American to show what a true patriot is and how he believes in his country, God and his family.  It is very sad that Chris will not be around to lend his wisdom and courage to others who could benefit from it.
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|Trailer looked fun, but it's about a minute laugh. Movie is plain boring. Mark Wahlberg is f @ss, why would he play in such lame movie?

B00A8LYYI0|3.0|... well, the first SH movie at least recreated the atmosphere and feel of the original games... so i thought this would at least be that good. The 3D doesn't add much but it's not bad, basically like the Resident Evil movies they throw in everything and the kitchen sink to remind you it's Silent Hill, all the locations, parts are present but none of is felt real, not even in the unreal surreal sense of the alternate hell world that is Silent Hill, everything looked like sets/props and the cinematography was too clean. The story is a mishmash of Silent Hill 3 basically with chunks of SH 2 tossed in... the acting is laughable, the girl playing Heather was ok, but nothing special and everybody else around her was pitiful which just doesn't work in any movie, you need a strong all around cast directed well and this movie just didn't achieve much other than cheap predictable almost scares. I reluctantly give it 3 stars.<br /><br />SPOILER*******************************************<br />SPOILER*******************************************<br /><br />Near the end of the movie i though, there's got to be more, but no... basically the climax of the movie is Pyramid head coming to Heather's defense and slaying the demon lady in her alternate blade wielding form, that's it... after that rather cool moment it's all but over.

Unfortunately Jamie's signature looks like 3 year scribble about 1/2 inch by 1/2 inch in total size.. You can tell she signed these in bulk. I realize that's the name of the game, I'm just disappointed. Was hoping at least for a larger signature where you can at least make out her name. Oh well.

1419705849|5.0|I work at a bookstore and normally would have just picked it up from us but Amazon's lightning sales are amazing. Anyhoo I got this for my baby sister because she likes them better than the girl ones (Dork Diaries) and it was cheaper than the ipod she wanted (kids these days). I have teachers that come in and hate these along with most of the popular kids books because of the grammar, subject matter and whatever else, so if that's a peeve of yours I'd stick to the classics. For us however, anything she is willing to read that isn't either way below her level or too gross(captain underpants I'm talking to you) I'm willing to get her. Conclusion: get em a book, it won't break, they can't put it on their ears and pretend they can't hear you ask them to clean, and when your done with it you can pass it along or trade it into my bookstore.

B0063GORYU|4.0|In this age of changes, I have sometimes gotten to a game that is so different from what I knew it to be, that I can't play it. This is so user friendly and is the basic game I learned MANY years ago. I would recommend it to anyone.
B000JJRIN4|3.0|It doesn't stand up to the test of time.  I like &#34;Yummy&#34; &#34;4 in the morning&#34; and &#34;Wind it Up.&#34; The rest is pretty much trash.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|It's a fun game to play and keeps you into it. I would get an upgrade if they come out with one.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|Probably one of the best films to ever come out in the last 30 or so years. If you want to see a good film, with a great cast, storyline, and one heck of an ending, than The Shawshank Redemption should certainly be on your list. Came exactly as described, and fast shipping to boot as well.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|I was going to that house on the road I turned around he was there and I had 7 papers!!!!!!!!
B00AHXIC50|4.0|Bought it because of the Amazon deal and loved almost every song in the album.  Just 3 didn't really care about it.
B00AMBH70S|1.0|This movie was utterly and completely horrible, not even worth the price to rent it. It's the exact same as all the other movies, just with a different person. He runs from the government and successfully gets a way, just like every other Bourne movie. It also leaves a lot of questions unanswered.
1451695195|4.0|Dr. Alexanders's story is  thought provoking, fascinating and wondrous.  It's a story of hope for all who still wonder.  I found it somewhat difficult to wade through much of the medical terminology.
B0063IH60K|5.0|so much fun to play when you are bored or waiting for class to start. I love it. Such a great game on the kindle
B00B2166BS|5.0|This charges my nexus 10 more than 20% faster than the stock charger. Definitely recommend this product. The magnetic clip is another plus if you have kids.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This game is a great time waster. The grafics are good and i like the peaceful music that plays in the background.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is truly incredible! I was hooked from the very beginning and could not put it down. I felt like the end didn't sum the book completely up, but other than that it was great!
B005JABN8Y|4.0|Was a gift to my son who is great fan of one piece.<br />It was easier to paint de pieces if they were white instead of beije.<br />The final result was great. It was easy to put toghether.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is extremely awesome. It has great prizes and characters. I like how every so often the scenery changes. I just wished it changed more often.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book was a great read it's erotic, romantic and heart breaking at the same time. I would recommend this book to any adult that's a hopeless romantic. It's a thumbs up for me. Book two here I come.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have been playing this game nonstop. It is soo much fun! you should get it for yourself its free you know?
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This is a beautifully written story of an abandoned girl and her search for giving and receiving love. The intertwined substory about the language and meaning of flowers supports the story beautifully. I gave it 4 stars as I found parts of the book, particularly in the second half, somewhat predictable. I do highly recommend it for its deep dive into the aspects of love, courage and reconciliation.
0446547573|1.0|This reads like all of his novels.  Boring and predictable. This version includes violence against women, have we had enough of that already. You can figure the ending by reading the first chapter.  Same plot as all the rest of his books. Enough!!!  Write something worth reading!!  I ordered this by mistake, I forgot how boring the other Sparks book was when I read it a couple of years ago.
B002UBRFDC|4.0|This is one of my all time favorite books, having read it many years ago. I elected to purchase the digital version for portability and while it is one of the longest books ever it offers a captivating narrative a some great history along with terrific characters you easily relate to.
B00AF46Q5Y|3.0|Seems like Archer has taken a leaf out of Dickens’s strategy, writing a series of stories about strong characters in a rich/poor scenario.  The overall structure is good, the places exciting and the characters interesting. The problem is implausibility.  In the USA, no one could pass themselves off as an American with an English accent, gait and attitudes.  Archer himself is guilty of this in his writing.  When Emma meets Mrs Tibbet in NYC, she is asked if she would like her coffee, black or white!  A trip to Starbucks would get you asked, ‘Room for cream?’<br />It is good that Archer includes the Barrington and Clifton Family trees in the front of the book.  You clearly know the characters in the complex story.  I guess I am hooked on buying the next Chronicle.  But the parallel stories are not quite up to snuff.  When Archer writes about what he knows, he is great.  The Clifton Chronicles pale in comparison with ‘A Prisoner of Birth’ (2008).<br />If I was not a Brit with ties to Bristol, living in America, I would pass on this book.
B001NHNG64|3.0|This series is an easy read and somewhat addictive. Okay the hero can do things previously limited to people wearing capes but it is just plain old fun. I finished this book in under three days and immediately ordered another in the series.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This is probably one of my favorite books. I cant give the story away, but if you liked the divergent series, youll love this book.
0060849827|4.0|This thing is awesome.  It's great to thumb through every once and a while and filled with useful information.  Glad I bought it!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome sauce I have nothing bad to say about subway serfers I would definitely recommend this game lolz enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was a great book in regard to the life of a Navy SEAL. It showed the sacrifices a SEAL makes for their country, and the dedication one must have to be successful as a SEAL. Highly recommend!!!
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This is the the best watch I've ever owned! Its simple and dressy I don't believe that if your considering this watch you'll be disappointed.
B000QI2ZWW|5.0|Great movie for any age! Has a message that we are responsible for the environment around the world. The other message is that we are special and unique individuals with much to offer to others and the world.
B008L1F91A|5.0|Im a big Superman fan and this is definitely a buy for any fan. Great detail and the pose represents the icon superman beautifully. Its a great addition to any collection.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Since I don't text, this is the next best thing to keeping in touch. I cannot say enough great things about this app.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|The Phantom done very well! Excellent cast giving a remarkable performance. The Royal Albert is grand setting and the dancers and costumes are grand. But, the centerpiece is the grand music and the voices of the singers. Wonderful!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Best record ive heard all year! You can hear all his musical influences,  from reggae to rock! Treasure is the best!
0316228532|5.0|J.K. Rowling's first novel for adults is realism at it's best. It's magic can be found in her uncanny ear for dialogue, her wonderful wit, and her mastery of the details of everyday life. She presents her characters with great satire but no malice -- even those who are rather unlikeable are treated with sympathy. The first few chapters touch on the rather mundane topic of a vacancy of the parish (i.e., town) council. I wondered how on earth she was going to sustain this premise for an entire novel. However, I became so involved in the tragi-comic lives of the characters (who are NOT difficult to keep track of) that I wished the book would go on for many more chapters. I also wished for much happier endings for the teenagers. (Despite knowing that if Crystal had lived in my town I would have judged, feared, and loathed her, halfway through the novel I was rooting for her and hoping she could turn her life around.) For the most part, the adults received their just desserts.<br />Rowling has a wonderful ear, which was most evident and enjoyable in the audio version of the book. As I listened I often laughed out loud--until the end, when I realized how much these characters had touched me.<br />If you are looking for Harry Potter, continue your search. If you appreciate smart, funny, warm, spot-on writing, stick with A Casual Vacancy. It is well worth your time.
B008J34466|5.0|I am a huge fan of Pink. I listen to this all the time, with my favorite being &#34;Try&#34;. I don't think there's a bad song on this.
1608955702|5.0|When I was growing up, I recall how my father, a medical professional relied heavily on his 'Physician's Desk Reference' as a quintessential tome to diagnose, prescribe and demystify ailments. Van Niekerk's book is a glorious analogy here. What ails you about light?<br /><br />Just as in any profession, there is a quintessential bible for the craft, Neil Van Niekerk's \\"Direction and Quality of Light\\" could easily become the desk reference for photographers!<br /><br />Based on the popularity of his last two bestselling books on wedding lighting, on- and off- camera flash techniques and a widely popular blog Tangents, I was intrigued to read his latest work, \\"Direction & Quality of Light\\". Defining light as the most vital element to mastering photography, Van Niekerk demonstrates interplay between the essentials like depth of field, shutter speed, composition, timing and more ...using directional light as one's starting point. After all, that is what photography IS supposed to be!  This book teaches one to recognize, diagnose, modify and prescribe solutions to lighting challenges. I found the Rx to my lighting ailments. YES!... it is that good.<br /><br />As a portrait photographer, I am always on a journey to improve my technical and artistic mastery. However, I do not embrace my inner tech geek by any means. It's true that Direction & Quality of Light truly focuses on the technical elements. However, it is as delightfully eloquent and elegant as Van Niekerk himself, a renowned workshop leader known to demystify flash and studio photography.  He evades the exasperating \\"ivory tower\\" lingo, making it an easy, enjoyable read. In each lighting setup, Van Niekerk not only explains the challenges he faced in each of the lighting situations, but the practical solutions, meta data, equipment, and he shows visual \\"pull backs\\" to demonstrate the full scene to reveal how he accomplished the end result. He maintains a voice throughout the book that is product-agnostic, so I did not feel like I was reading an endorsement for any single brand, or feel the pressure to \\"make the switch\\", as often the case in today's instructional guides.<br /><br />I feel that his techniques are sophisticated enough to keep the experienced photographer incredibly enthused, while practical enough to educate a novice/emerging light master. In either case, it could easily become the desk reference for a photographer of any level. It's a timeless education from a foremost authority whose passion education on \\"all things light\\".... and is simply wonderful.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I liked the adventure--it was super packed with action.  I had to be forced to take a break from reading, and every time I took one of those breaks I was super bummed.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I stand in admiration of this accomplished physician. To defy the science he was mentored by and explain his rationale for his experience as unexplainable. I am in awe. Certainly, his purpose of accomplishment in this life has been fulfilled. I thank him for the comfort he will bring to many thru his writings.
B00AECDDYY|3.0|Force closes at the beginning of every stage. Very basic game. Gameplay depends more on how fast you tap than actual strategy.Not worth the price.
B00ANGSSWS|5.0|The last album was a little flat, but this one was better. I still miss the screams they used to throw in, but this album definitely catches attention since its a really good rock album. Very catchy, easy to rock out to. That's what I prefer. I'd say buy it.
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|I liked the upbeat, patriotic message of the film and the unabashed way that star Chris Evans pulled it off.
0142501123|5.0|Room on a Broom is a new classic for children. It is beautifully illustrated and is witty, warm and charming.<br /><br />The BBC animated version is a real treat too if you can find it.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
0143039431|5.0|This book is the tits. I'm totally a Joadie (roadie for the Joad's) after reading this Steinbeck ca-lasssic. Bravo sir!
B000002HJD|4.0|I bought this cd because I haven't heard it since I bought the album on it's release. It's great to listen to when I'm driving down the highway and hearing &#34;Riders on the Storm&#34; or the Wasp. Jim's poetry mixed with Ray's hypnotic organ playing and Robbie's mystical riffs and John's rythmic beats sounds so special to me and puts me in a relaxed mood.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book!! Keeps you hooked the whole time. I can't wait to read the next ones. Hope she writes more books.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The third book-essential to wrap up the games,express the ending and the lessons learned for the characters and the reader was violently portrayed but in the end--hope.

B007BVOEPI|4.0|This is an excellent show. Rather a lot of violence and nudity, but for all that the plot is thick, the drama exciting, and the characters convincing. The quality of this video is relatively high.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|God I get tried if writing reviews, I just want to buy a product and go on with my life<br />Sorry<br />David
B00846REIS|4.0|I wanted to like this more. I really did. I think if the characters would have been a little older, especially Gideon, it wouldn't have been so maddening. Eva frustrated me with her little girl inner dialog. Not sure if I will continue the series.
B001UAX56A|5.0|I bought the CD many years ago but misplaced it. I really forgot how good this is and I'm glad I purchased it.
B0090SI3ZW|1.0|The worst Tarantino movie ever. The actors are all good, Liu, Crow, Yune, just about everyone except RZA, what a poser.  But the movie itself, was just dreadful,  from the bad writing to the overly absurd fighting scenes and ridiculous special effects.  Kill Bill was over the top comic book fighting and blood fountains, but at leaste it was entertaining. The movie was also riddled with rap music (garbage) which has never seemed more out of place in a movie. Save yourself the time and torture,  go for a walk, avoid this travesty of another pointless Hollywood bomb.
B004C3DLJS|5.0|Gets me every time. It's amazing how fast time flies. I'm almost 30 but still enjoy these cartoons! Of course I recommend this to young and not so young anymore, alike.
B001P1MZNI|4.0|Like being at a concert. Only complaint is the long series of jokes. No doubt they were funnier for the people who were there.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|This DVD was ordered for my Granddaughter because she is<br />a big fan of the series.  If it makes her happy, it makes me happy.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|It lived up to the hype and well beyond that. can't wait for the second to come out. Mark Ruffalo gets two thumbs up for his performance of the Hulk
B007REV4YI|5.0|Good movie.  Watched it before the Oscar awards and it<br />was a winner.  So I am partially up to date on the recent<br />good movies.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Finally, a great work of that artists, an incredible experince for the eye & knowledge, all the family realle enjoy it.
B00AFEY354|5.0|Perks of being a Wallflower is one of my favorite books, and the movie exceeded my expectations in portraying the story.
B00008S7KC|5.0|In this work you can enjoy the real PINK FLOYD, something that the fans most keep in their collection.Thank you.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|This has to be the very best, uplifting and humerous moving story of a horse that will never be beat!
B005IQZB14|4.0|I read this book in advance of my own long trek which I hope to take on the Camino de Santiago this coming September. I guess we are all driven to our own pilgrimages in or way or another by the vagaries of life and hopefully we all get to sort our lives out in some measure along the way. This story is a testament to the resiliency of the human spirit.
B000P12LWY|5.0|I love history and this is a great show.  The actors are great choices and it keeps your interest.  I would check it out!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The best series in television history continues. We don't have to love the outcome to appreciate how wonderful this show truly is.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I was hesitant to watch zombie movies and do not watch while eating, but I love this show!  I totally want to be an extra as a zombie.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|In addition to the &#34;best in class&#34; acting, casting, direction and story line, the cinematography is masterful. The HD version is better than 3D.
B001NZEHMS|5.0|The original:  Beastie Boys unleashed totally new fusion of rap and rock with this &#34;new&#34; Brooklyn sound from the '80's.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This CD was exactly like what you find in retail stores.  Perfectly happy with the quality of the product - and, who doesn't love Adele?
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I love this movie. If you like a good sing along and a little silly fun, then this is for you!!
0316743003|5.0|I work in computers (software engineering) and recommend this book to just about all my friends at work. Not only is it appealing to watch engineers tackle these huge problems and beat them, but there are a lot of lessons to be learned from watching Ben Rich's own progress from a line engineer into management, and the shift he must undergo from solving technical problems to solving whole-program problems. Anyone who has had a career of length in any engineering field will recognize the fundamental forces at work - they're just amplified to incredible scale here by the literally global stakes and superpower pressures involved. I've had lots of books about aerospace, black budget programs, military history, and engineering come and go in my life but this one will always remain handy on my bookshelf nearby.
B001EBWING|5.0|What can I say? This is a classic movie that I just cannot but watch it from time to time. Sure it is in black and white, but that just adds to the nostalgia.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|A must read!  I loved how this was told through the eyes of the little boy.  I started out thinking &#34;where is this going&#34;, and was hooked from page 1!  Slightly disturbing content, so maybe not for everyone.  This book will make you think!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Greatly enjoyed this mini series.Outstanding acting. This mini series really gives you a good idea of what life was like in Colonial times.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I waited some time to write this review because quite frankly, I couldn't fathom getting a quality product like it for such a low price. I thought that it would take a long time to ship, that it would work initially for a few weeks and quickly start becoming dysfunctional, and that I would have to order another one within a month or two. Even if this was actually the case, it would still be a better bang for your buck than most other gaming mouses out there. Fortunately, amazingly, none of my assumptions were true and I stumbled upon probably the single best gaming peripheral I've ever purchased. It arrived within days of my order (3, I think). It had attractive and functional packaging that was not impossible to access. Most importantly though, it is an amazingly accurate, durable product! I've been hammering away on this mouse for months now and every single button on it still functions perfectly, even in some severe mashing situations. Some people would argue that there are not enough extra buttons to qualify it as a 'professional' gaming mouse, but they would be wrong. It has the perfect number of buttons, arranged in an excellent layout. Please realize, when you are debating your Razer Naga and SteelSeries Cata mice, that PLACEMENT (read:quality) is more important that quantity. Nobody operates a number pad with their thumb, and that is what Anker's competitors offer you on their mice! I continue to be blown away by this mouse based on a usefulness and quality standpoint, but when you factor in the fact that the cost is less than half of the closest competitor it makes me want to shout the praise in the street. Really though, whenever I'm at the local big box store and I see people looking at PC games or peripherals, I stop to tell them about this awesome find. Thank you Anker! Please continue this product! And hire a marketing director, this company name should be known!
B0053JJLLC|5.0|I loved this novel. l couldn't stop reading it. every twist in the story kept me interested and I wanted to read more. Michael Crichton at his best.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|very gun game. enjoy playing. have hard time stopping Lol. I love the gem feature. makes for a better game. did I say that this game was addicting...
B008VPC9WS|5.0|I am an English teacher and I have prepared students for this exam for a while, using this book the students have gotten over 100 points in the TOEFL iBT. the exercises are as realistic as you can get them. amazing results
1591840562|5.0|Great book. It should give quite a bit of encouragement to a person with just a great idea, a lot of energy, a willingness to work hard but not a ton of financial resources. I found it to be filled with the kind of advice that is surprisingly obvious (once you hear it); it makes you want to roll up your sleeves and get to work. I especially appreciated the dissection of what constitutes a great idea and how you cannot mask a mediocre idea with pizzaz and hope to get anywhere with it. It doesn't hurt that Guy also has a great sense of humor.
1616550414|5.0|Ordered this as a Valentines gift for my girlfriend.  She played the games a lot more than I did but it's an awesome read. Very detailed on everything.  All my friends are jealous that they dont have it. haha
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Could not put this down.  It provides so much to think about as you consider the choices that people with severe physical limitations may want to make for themselves.  Who gets to determine whether life is worth living?
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Only dislike is that I have to buy the games as I go, not with real money but still. I thought I would be able to just play all.132 games.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this app is amazing and addicting. barely any pop ups what so ever awesome graphics and best of all its free!! its all one package. it is probably not for everyone but its for most people. I love this game and I encourage everyone to try it and trust me its a gurrenty that u will love it!!! :):)
0316228532|4.0|The Casual Vacancy is an adult novel that explores major themes of racism, social class and poverty, and abuse. These are just a few of the themes found in the book. Because it's an adult novel, it's going to be hard to read at times and also brutally honest about human nature. Rowling's characters are all flawed and that's okay. She works with them to expose human nature. Her character development is incredible. It's difficult to stay with as she switches from character to character, but she ties them all together at the end. The novel is very well written, although complex.<br /><br />The plot is also quickly developed at the beginning and moves just as quickly through the story. The plot gives the novel a feel of sincere honesty and it is both comic and tragic. Rowling said in an interview that she prefers to think of the novel as a comic tragedy - and that it is.<br /><br />I don't understand the comparison to the Potter series - that series and this novel are vastly different and were not meant to be compared.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|As far as Zombie books go, World War Z was an easy read with different, and interesting, points of view.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Creepy at times but it is a great show so far!  If you are a science fan this is a show you must see!
B00000G3I2|5.0|I just flat out love this movie, I've must have watched at least 100 times and it still so good. This movie holds up really well through the years. What a wonderful cast the blend together really well. They have all gone on to play great roles in there lives yet to me this is some of their best I think this is because the movie doesn't lean on a single person but the collective whole group. It must have wonderful to be a part of a group of friends like this. The writing is wonderful the directing great and the acting incredible. I can't that there maybe people out there who have not seen this film but if there are you really need to change that pick this one up and watch it. After that pick up Grand Canyon and my Darling Companion two more great movies by Lawrence Kasdan.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|The 3-D movie Avatar was a great deal.  The quality of the dvd is excellent, and all ages can enjoy this product!
B000I9WWJA|5.0|To many great actors for this not to be good!  Foster was great as a bad girl, Owen was great as a &#34;bad guy&#34;, and Denzel was Denzel!
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|The 3-D movie Lion King was a great deal.  The quality of the dvd is excellent, and all ages can enjoy this product!
B00BHMF578|5.0|Very good film, well written, well acted, well done.  The clothes, and the costumes were spot on, and the &#34;house guests&#34; even looked like the real people.  The only part I disliked was the opening about the rise of the Shaw, and all the evil he and we did to Iran.  I have lots of friends from Iran who came before and some after that time and their stories about the times and the country were much different. I know lots of Americans who lived and worked there during the 60s and 70s, and Iran was a great place, with mostly happy people and lots of business and commerce.  But overall this part of the story was told and acted well.  Carter at the end behind the credits was a joke, but what do you expect from him.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|What a great book with interesting twist however I was hoping for a better ending. I truly enjoyed this book

B008ULRY78|4.0|This was an exciting movie from about 5 minutes into the movie. I like action flicks. This was a hell of a ride.<br />Must see.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|It was a pager turner and you can lose you can lose track if time with this book. Cannot wait until next one.
0765325950|4.0|I loved this book.  I wish it had not ended.  It caps a twenty year journey for me through Randland!
B00846REIS|5.0|It was a book you cannot put down. If you like fifty shades of grey you will love this series .

B001AQO3QA|4.0|Great collection of the Alien movies and comes in a nice case. The only thing missing from the set now is the introduction of the the new Alien movie installment Prometheus.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love the show.  Wish there were more shows like this on TV now-a-days.  Season two picks up where season one left off.  Still strong writing, acting, and the story is still engaging...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this beats the original addictive version.  once u start to play u cant stop....should have a warning label on it for its addictiveness
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I have really become a fan of Fringe. It has good characters that you understand well enough to care about. It also has fun, innovative story lines.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I really like this game. It is a great stress reliever. This game is fun,  addictive and entertaining. Five star rating.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this series! Great characters and acting. I love seeing the interplay between the family and their servants. Just a very well done series.
0316227706|5.0|I gave this book as a gift and the recipient loved it! Lots of fun pictures for dog lovers.  Mission accomplished.
B00A6SZRJ0|5.0|I have never paid much attention to the manufactured theme music you would find in movies simply because I feel the score keeps you locked to the movie. Here, the epic score was made for the pure musical enjoyment and it is breathtaking. The music is as strong as it is diverse and will leave you wanting more. The first time I heard the album SkyWorld I felt that hungry feeling rise in me similar to the feeling of when you are reading an amazing story, you know you need to put the book down but keep telling yourself, ‘just one more chapter’. The many themes of the music are well fit to touch many culture and age groups. Four tracks in and I am a true fan.<br /><br />To the creators and everyone who was involved with making this wonderful music, THANK YOU!
0345529057|5.0|Love this series. I have seen the show but the books are so much better. Nothing compares to a good book
1616550414|4.0|I got this as a gift for a fellow nerd friend for his birthday. It wasn't bad, it's a huge book. I don't think I would get it for me. It says it's the Hyrule Historia, but it mostly covered Skyward Sword. It would've been nicer if it was more like an encylopedia, and if it showed more artwork from the earlier games. The artwork they put in there was basically just artwork from the old game manuals that came with the games, and some of them were in black and white to make it look like pencil, or it was pencil image, but never showed the color image e.g. from the first Legend of Zelda for N.E.S. with Link helping the old woman. So it would've been cooler to see concept/in development artwork, scenery art (not a lot of castle or dungeon art if at all), and more about the other games instead of just Skyward Sword. Even Ocarina of Time had a relatively small section, and Twilight Princess had the second largest bit of information (but it did show more concept art on Skyward Sword and Twilight Princess).<br />So easy go to list of what I wanted:<br />More concept art work<br />More information on other games (esp. the older ones since it'd be harder to find)<br />More in depth history for the characters<br />How all the games intertwine if they do at all<br />A map of the grand scheme of Hyrule that interlaced all the games.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Really enjoy the game.  Challenging and keeps you on your toes. Good game for kids and old folks both. A game the whole family can enjoy.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I like the idea of the story and I would like to see the movie but there is bit of a fictional element in the story in which I do not like
B002N44XSG|5.0|this book is a great way to exercise your Percy Jackson love while waiting for the next book. recommended for all middle school kids.
B009O07NDY|1.0|The theme from the song the dwarves sing is beautiful and haunting, but there is not enough of it, and way too much that is not enjoyable listening.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Totally frigging awesome, to all who are fans....... May the farce be with you, with a side of bacon.<br />Great game
B00A77II0U|5.0|I absolutely love this game, it is so different, weird and dark. Definitely worth the money and time. Had a lot of fun playing it. Super creepy.

B005FRF6PC|4.0|I chose this rating because I taught me to never give up on anything you do. And how to believe in yourself

B000000WCV|5.0|This product was exactly what I was looking for. The CD was brand new and still in the plastic wrap.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Amazing casting and story line backed by fantastic acting and visuals. Not so much a story about zombies as it is a story about people dealing with a horrific situation that happens to feature zombies.<br />I feel confident stating that this is the finest work ever put to film.
B001MW0J2Y|5.0|This product was exactly what I was looking for. The CD was brand new and still in the plastic wrap.

B007VUCAVO|5.0|Gives you  all the power info you need, with an unobtrusive, yet slick interface. Well worth the $2 price. This is an app Amazon should have provided with the Kindle.

1401938906|5.0|E-Squared by Pam Grout is provides nine powerful experiments that you can do to create what you want out of your reality. She claims that they work, but it is up to you to try them and prove it for yourself. Are you willing to try to see if it works for you, too?<br /><br />E-Squared is a book that can truly change the way that you look at the world, and also change what happens in your world. Pam Grout gives examples of experiments that you can try to see if it will work for you, and prove to yourself that by doing some simple steps and changing how you view the world, will in fact work with you to create what you want!<br /><br />I found this to be a fun and uplifting read, and I am going to try the experiments myself later this week. If you are someone who wants to change their life for the better, or know someone who does, this is a great guidebook to get you there!<br /><br />* Thank you to the publisher of E-Squared, Hay House, for providing me with a copy of this book for review.

0061992860|5.0|This is the best survival guide I've seen in a long time. You won't believe how much is included in such a tiny package. We have one in the ditch bag on our sailboat and have one in the glove compartment of our car. Also, I just enjoy reading it. It's very informative and full of interesting suggestions. Take it on your next backpacking trip - survival tips and a good read all in one!
1401941893|5.0|Treasure Yourself by Miranda Kerr is aimed to help you become empowered by who you are as a person. The tips and resources included in the book are great starters for anyone who needs a little extra help to uncover their unique gifts.<br /><br />Treasure Yourself is a book that reads like it was actually written by the celebrity author, which I like. I know that some celebrity books (on a variety of topics) read like their editor red-penned everything and completely changed what they wrote. This one doesn't do that, and if they did, well, I can't tell, sorry! BUT - that is what I like about it. Miranda Kerr wrote this book that does focus on learning how to actually treasure yourself for who you are as a person, and reading it, does sound like it is coming from her own voice.<br /><br />This is a truly inspiring book that leaves me feeling uplifted each time I read it. The quotes and insight in the book are great, and I couldn't ask for more with what the book is. If you need some self-treasuring tips, this is the book for you!<br /><br />* Thank you to the publisher of Treasure Yourself, Hay House, for providing me with a copy of this book for review.

B005Q1W10A|5.0|I had not watched this series when it was on TV. Once I started it, I could not stop. Cannot wait for the rest.
B005N1E8A4|3.0|Like her music was looking forward to seeing her live via BluRay. Video = 10 Audio = 10 lots of pre-recorded bits but if she was lip syncing I could not tell. Sets were incredible some with water features. Some themes were already done by Destiny's Child but who's counting. What ruined the show was the presence of male anatomy, guys touching guys, butch women, very odd costumes. Some have posted she really knows her audience well and judging from the show her target audience is gay males. Not family or straight friendly.
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|Listened to this for probably the 6th or 7th time while doing chores around the house but found myself doing more rocking to the music than getting anything done.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|The movie was decent. Seemed to drag at a couple parts but overall it was watchable but not my favorite bond.
B007KQI1NA|2.0|Out of the box experience is poor. No manual. Online documentation is scattered and poorly organized. I did have to find and install a driver from the web; then, the GSP would work with old-style desktop apps. Never could get it to work with modern Windows 8 Metro/Store Apps. Sending it back for a refund.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|good fun for a horse person when your not in the barn !!! :) though ive not quite sorted it out yet :)
B0091Q82L8|4.0|The Hull recording is superior to &#34;Live at Leeds&#34; in some respects and definitely worth a listen.  Their true sheer power and majesty are captured on this magnificent recording.  You will not be disappointed.
0871164566|5.0|Great book. This book has easy to follow directions for making unique bead pendants. This is a great way to use up all those left over beads from other projects.
B0043GAZYS|1.0|This is a great movie, nothing further needs to be said that hasn't been already. However, the studios manufacturing these, and including digital copies that are not usable by the time you buy the disc is ridiculous. This is the third of three movies that arrived today that include digital copy codes, all of which are useless due to expiration dates on the codes.<br /><br />Since it's illegal to make a legitimate digital copy to put on my home theater PC, this is an ******* move. Hollywood needs an enema. Of those three, ONE actually included the Amazon copy, which was a very kind nod from Amazon, that I'm sure they had to fight to get. This was not, however, that movie. And they wonder why piracy is so rampant when they do things that punish people who legitimately buy the movie (See that tag? Yah, purchased, not pirated, yet I cannot use my movie the way I want).
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Rated it at 5 stars because it is easy to learn, fun to play, and is great when traveling or at home.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I wouldn't say this is great literature, but certainly a great read. I started reading the third installment the night I finished the second. Need I say more?
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved safe haven. It was the best I've ever read so far in my life. For definitely surely I am going to continue reading books by Nicholas sparks.

B007IXWL2C|4.0|Love the trilogy!  I enjoyed all three books and recommend all of them especially if you love romance novels! Can't wait to see what comes next for E L James
B005HSL626|5.0|my daughter loved this game...it was really fun and not boring in the least..the 3D graphics were amazing..thank you very much!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I just hate. The fact that u need to pay real money to get gems but that's my opinion .
B001P1MZNI|4.0|Sinatra at possibly his best. I'm an old classic rock listener but the Count's music is right at the top. Sinatra's talking between songs and his monolog only add more to an already great album.
055357342X|5.0|I really loved this book and was surprised to find it didn't even looked used when I got it! I'm definitely looking forward to getting the next book and recommend this series to anyone who enjoys reading!
B00821OX98|5.0|well done show, acting was superb too bad it only made it 2 seasons, wish it would get picked up again
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|What an awesome book. Highly recommend to anyone who loves a good fascinating read. I found myself visualizing the scenes, and feeling the passion of the characters.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Absolutely amazing and very very enjoyable could not get any better and its free as well a great buy and tones of addictive fun.
B007ZH9P0C|5.0|For the years that I have listened to Madonna and many remixes that I have enjoyed listening to could be the best one yet
6305754969|1.0|El Dorado is one of my favorite John Wayne movies. The listing stated good condition. In reality I would not even rate it fair. I have thrown away DVD~S in better condition.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|Not only was the loss of two main characters devastating, but the pace of the show was off. I will be very hard for the series to redeem  itself.
B00AHXDECG|5.0|Bruno has outdone himself.  This is just as good as his first, if not better.  I hum the songs all day long.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is a very fascinating alarm clock yet simple and very user friendly. I love that the big bold digital display turns my kindle into a make believe bedside clock. I usually cant be bothered to write reviews for apps but I really had to this time.
B0094K1JPC|5.0|A fun, cute, happy movie with an interesting plot. I need to type ten more words so here they are.
1419704400|5.0|The cover itself sold this for me.  Everything inside is well photographed.<br /><br />This cover is a masterpiece.  Vogue is and has been in the forefront of fashion photography.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I've tested several alarm clocks for my Kindle Fire HD but this is the best.<br />It's packed with features and comes with a lot of preloaded sounds.<br />Some are named after constellations which I like as a stargazer.<br />And they are loud enough to wake the dead.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Characters were well written and likable.  The tough subject material was handled with care but was still believable.  Love, love Holder...all men should be that smart, strong, and beautiful!
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|It reminds me a lot of the old Sims game. I'm having a lot of fun playing with it and my kids are liking it too.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|CD all the songs that Christina & Char sing in the movie. Since I have bought, I've had 3 friends borrower since you can't find an any of the stores where I leave.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this is a great app. It is so much fun and very addicting! I also love the different themes and that you can play with your facebook friends. The only thing I would change is that on the 4th generation iPod the app is very slow so that would be good if that could speed up but other than that this app is amazing!!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this app!! it has better grapics than Temple Run 1 although i do like both. i honestly like this one better though for some reason i think it is more fun. definetly worth getting!!
B007W1BLN0|4.0|While this movie seemed to drag a bit I was intrigued to watch until the end.  GLAD I did. Take the time to watch.
B000FC2OHA|5.0|I originally bought the big bulky print version of this book many years ago and have now added it to my kindle.  I love being able to bookmark the parts I like back and having it with me to refer to whenever I want to.  This book never gets old.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|this is awesome ive had no problems yet. but I cant take pics with my kindle to post and I cant figure out how to download them but that's on me.
B009WJ14FA|5.0|I saw Vintage Trouble last week when they openned for The Who(the concert was amazing by the way). At the beginning they got the same respect which a lot of opening bands get...which is none but once they started playing they had all of Nassau Colieseum clapping and screaming. Their frontman moves like he's James Brown/David Ruffin and sings soulfully like them and Little Richard combined. The rest of the band brought the rock element to the performance and man let me tell you it meshed together like peanut butter and jelly. It was just an amazing atmosphere and performance that the second I got home I had to purchase their album and it was just as amazing. The mix of hard rocking songs and soulfully chilled songs was a perfect combination. I really hope they make it big and I personally think they would've been famous if they formed in the 50s or 60s but I think Vintage Trouble, as evindenced by their live performance and album, will make it and gain the fame they deserve. Please check these guys out. If you like the Who or any of the hard rocking bands of the late 60s/70s and you love the soul artists of the 50s and 60s like James Brown and the Tempetations then you will love Vintage Trouble.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Good portrait of bootlegging in Virginia, and the violence associated with the trade.  Rated &#34;R&#34;, mostly for profanity, but overall, it was a good movie.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|The book is very good and I enjoyed it very much characters were good and story line was nice<br />A must read!!!
B00A80SHFM|5.0|This is a great CD and every time I play it I want to see the movie again!  And every time I play it, it is like I AM watching the movie all over again!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good company, easy to play anytime and anywhere you go, just for a while or hours of good entertainment, you will feel the relax and joy and never feel<br />loneliness , just enjoy it.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This one is really cool visually. Everything you'd expect gamewise from angry bird. addictive as usual but that's why you want it, right?
1400082773|4.0|LOVED THIS BOOK. MAKES YOU REALIZE THAT THE PRESIDENT IS /WAS A &#34;REGULAR&#34; GUY , GOING THROUGH THE SAME UPS AND DOWN AS EVERYBODY ELSE. HE LIVED A REAL LIFE AMOUNG REAL PEOPLE.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|My kindergarten age son loves the rio birds! his favorite part is knocking off the monkeys. He just laughs and laughs. Terrific for fine motor skills.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|None better - John Wayne has Never been in a movie of this caliber, glad he wasn't casted.  Best westen EVER!!
B009VB7P6G|5.0|My kindergarten aged son loved this movie. Tinkerbell's adventures are action packed proving these fairies are not just for the girls!
B00002ND77|5.0|This movie was so well made, the sorty is true and demonstrates how the turn of events in this country actuall transpired.  LOVE Bro Malcolm!  He should be honored as well.  Nothing much has changed!!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I think my son and husband are officially addicted to this fun game. I have been able to use this as a reward to get my six year to clean up his playroom. Brilliant!
B00008G8LG|5.0|This rendition of the King and I, entitled, Anna and the King is sooooo wonderful that I have watched it with many  guests and I have thoroughly enjoyed it each time.  Genuine affection between the characters comes through, and Anna and the King do seem to be real people as the movie progresses!!!  Highly recommend this movie.  There is one scene where little children might be better off not watching where a fatal punishment is meted out, otherwise it is fine fare for all.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Love the movie!! It was shipped on time and was in very good quality when i got it . .
B002XTBEDI|5.0|Well, the ladies are back and they experience as enjoyable antics and lives as in the first Cranford.  People have aged and lives have changed, but even so, this continuation of the original Cranford does wonderful credit to author Elizabeth Gaskill as well as all involved in the making of this movie.  Be sure to see both Cranford and Return To Cranford.
B007RI56NY|5.0|This band is simply amazing. They touch in in so many ways through their music, and they love their fans!
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I was disappointed with this second book- sure wasn't worth $20!!  The first in the series was way more interesting but this one got bogged down in technical atom bomb jargon, silly coincidences, gratuitous sex scenes and I quickly got bored and had to skip paragraphs<br />It's a pity that the trend to these so-called trilogies usually end up with the 2nd or 3rd book being a waste of money - I won't buy the next book- my advice is when you are on a good thing just leave it! Don't just pour out another volume of verbiage.
B0000CFW87|4.0|His voice has the amazing ability to make me relax. If I'm stressed, I just pop him in to my radio.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The book is highly recommended ! The language is extremely simple and the point of view is very consistent . The book moves at a relaxing pace and is extremely absorbing without being dull or loose. Plot points are tight and the other characters are complex and completely fleshed out thus adding to the well crafted feel of the book.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I have a new respect for Ben Affleck having done a great job in developing this story on-screen. I never knew there were six missing Embassy staff members that were able to escape from Iran. Even though the film has been \\"Hollywoodized\\" it is none the less pretty accurate and daring even more so than the \\"Entebbe raid\\". It's interesting to note that the \\"Military Option\\" by the US failed in a rescue attempt but this succeeded.<br /><br />Jeff
B008F5YDRI|4.0|I've seen reviews on this film, and decided to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised much I liked this film, the storyline being so unusual, the beautiful sceneries, the unusual love story, and all the actors performances were great!<br />It was a pleasure watching this film!<br />I did recommend this film to all my friends, and my end statement is that it was time well spent!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Fun game to waste time without thinking! Reminds me of old mario days! Please always add more levels!  Great game.
B005HSL626|5.0|this game can get addicting wen you have nothing better to do and you are trying to kill some time
B004EBT5CU|5.0|her voice is so lovely and pure, strong and sure, words are timeless, like this album more than than the first
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Such am interesting show! It's so interesting seeing how the class system in England wa before ww1, and how it all changed after the war.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I downloaded this app because I love horses and when my son is sleeping or napping and I did everything I had to do, it's fun to play.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|We love this show. Now on season two. A favorite for our whole family. In fact, we subsribed to Amazon Prime recently - one of the reasons was because we could watch this show on here and it's not yet a available on N****ix!! :D
B006MW3V6U|5.0|So glad I got to watch this on Amazon!!! It was great that I didn't have to rent it or buy it on DVD! Thanks Amazon!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Nice writing with surprises throughout, nicely written!! Great ending!! would recommend to people that do not read what everyone else reads!
B004J4WN0I|4.0|Found this to be a nice, light, and enjoyable read.  A good fit for fans of Dresden, the Hallows, and others of that vein.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|It works perfectly.  The other ones we have tend to separate from the wire - we're hoping this one will be a little sturdier.
B005LAIHU4|5.0|One day my mom said she wanted to see this.  So we went and saw it.  It starts out with some mystery.  A girl seems to be hiding.  From what or whom you are unsure.  Then, she finds a place to feel safe and starts to enjoy her new dwellings.  Throughout the movie you will learn about what she is afraid of and what happened to finally free her and make her run.  Then, there may just be something in the movie that will happen that makes you have this weird feeling in your gut.  I will not say anything though.<br /><br />The chemistry between the actor that plays the father and the actress that plays the girl is amazing.  They are so good at playing nervous, anxious people who are falling for one another.  You will come to like both of them and hope for good things to happen.  There is someone else in the movie as well.  A detective/cop.  His role in the movie is important.<br /><br />The kids that play the mans kids are great.  They are such good actors.  I am proud of them.  They never get in the way of anything that is going on.  You see them for the perfect amount of time.  In the time you see them you will understand their pain and their reasons for doing what they do.<br /><br />Another thing that I liked about this movie is the location.  It seems to have a small town feeling.  Some movies go all over the place.  But this movies was really in one place.  It let you feel safe.  Like you were at home and nothing could happen.  Very well done.<br /><br />This is a great movie for a man, women, or both to watch.  It really makes you thankful for those you have that you can love and who love you.  As soon as this comes out, I am buying it.  One of those movies that is great to watch on a rainy night.  A great movie!!!!<br /><br />Oh, and if you were wondering I am a 28 year old guy.  I have had a lot of pain in my life.  I enjoy love stories.  Just makes you feel good.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Wow. Ditto the other reviewers'  \\"hilarious and heartbreaking\\" comments. One of the best books I've read this year. And I read A LOT.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|While I wouldn't put it quite up with Sherlock (BBC), I really enjoy this American adaptation.  I wasn't sure about Lucy Liu as Watson, but in retrospect, I really like the idea.  She is a strong actor and does an excellent job in this slight twist on the part.  Johnny Lee Miller is a great Holmes, and although I think Cumberbatch has really defined the role, Miller has his own contribution that is definitely worth watching.  As a big fan of the mystery genre, I can definitely recommend this show.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is this: Why can't American television come up with their own shows?  As an American, I get a little tired of us stealing all the best shows from the BBC and adapting them.  Can't we come up with anything original?  That's my burden and probably not something I should hold against this show, but I did.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I find it hard to do annything with this app.It wont let me post anything,go to my home page,or see the compleat post that my friends put up.I have realy bin disapointed with this app and would not recamend it to my friends
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This book kept me entranced right from the start!  The sadness of the orphans who suffered in heartless institutions, interwoven with those of hope by a boy who was blessed to have been adopted by a loving couple.  There were humorous moments and others where I needed a kleenex.<br /><br />The writing of Christina McKenna reminded me of Mary Jane Holmes' &#34;The English Orphans&#34;, which I read every summer I visited my grandmother.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really loved this series, these books come very close to being my favorite next to 50 shades of grey.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|This is a wonderful Disney movie that I have watched at least five times by now. The music is great, the characters are lovable and entertaining and the animation is superb. After watching this movie and listening to its soundtrack, I can totally imagine it coming to life on Broadway (which I wish would happen!). Do yourself a favor and watch it if you haven't already!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Best series I have read in this type of erotic books. It's completely sexy and romantic, if you don't fall in love with Christian Grey then there's probably something wrong with you !!!
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|For the most part, I really enjoyed this movie. The character designs and personalities were great and the story was new and refreshing. There were many parts that had me laughing out loud. The only con is that I felt the middle dragged somewhat, but this is just a personal opinion. Other than that, I would recommend people to at least give it a try!

B00BEU6JVY|5.0|I love the Nashville influence. I am a little confused about &#34;Rising&#34;...what's the story behind that? I'm sure there is a reason for the the abrupt ending. I got this as a digital download and maybe there was a problem with the download. Anyway, I would buy anything Justin was selling out of respect and appreciation for all his work!
B00846REIS|5.0|I really loved this series, these books come very close to being my favorite next to 50 shades of grey. Can't wait for the last book to come out
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I absolutely live this album. Bruno Mars Has truly put done himself. It is one of those albums you can just turn on and never have to touch the skip button. I can't wait to see him live
0761169253|5.0|Overall  - excellent!  Enough said.  I will be ordering this book for each of my family members.  i can relate!!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I thought this book was a really interesting way to look at cancer - it was hard that the main characters were teenagers suffering but I liked the perspective it brought. It was easy to fall in love with the characters and be on their sides.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|I bought this to watch with my young sons.  I'd forgotten how great the music is--we've all been singing songs from it for weeks.
B0037QGS0A|5.0|This movie was everything I hoped it would be. It had romance, suspense, adventure, and best of all the actors in this movie were actors I enjoy watching.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Very well written and produced series and the acting was very good and realistic. Provides a nice glimpse of the 19 th century
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I've been trying to download this game on my device since I bought my tablet. I' ve seen many people playing this game and I couldn't play. Now I updated my phone I can play temple run2 I'm excited, OMG. LOVE THE GAME!
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Excellent quality and customer service It arrived on time and we were very pleased with the quality. Thanks so much
B00992CF6W|5.0|Do you like games that you can't stop playing? Then get minecraft. I also recomemd minecraft world editor it is cool too. Minecraft is always getting updates so the game just keeps getting better and better. If you had a choice between minecraft PE(pocket addition) and minecraft computer version. Then get the computer version it is better because thats what minecraft is suppose to go on. The version i am on is 0.6.1 you will most likely be reading this some time in the future. Of any one has something bad to say about minecraft then you should see you-tube videos about the awesome things people do with it. I hope you enjoy minecraft.
B005PK1G76|5.0|So much less expensive than the rest and just as effective.  My stroller didn't come with a cup holder so I needed something for my walks around the block with my baby. This item did exactly what I needed and didn't break the bank.
0783117523|5.0|I loved this movie!  The format is wonderful, the acting is superb, and the story is both haunting and beautiful.
B004NOH9LC|5.0|i thought this was a really cute movie and worth watching. girl movie. great lazy day movieathon! Love Rachel McAdams
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I love it! Some parts I couldn't understand because of the language but The Adventures of Tom Sawyer will always be an all time favorite of mine!!
B008XX6J4C|4.0|If you like this sort of music buy the disk, you'll not be disappointed.<br /><br />So, I need three more words... ok, done.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway sufers its a great game. After u play it a while u want to play it all day.I love the jetpack a ? box. but I don't know how to get rome
B007KOLNXC|5.0|I love this series I hope it never ends. It's so fun to watch and remember what it was like for me in that time. Also, to see what my parents were upto.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is a game I never get tired of. I play it all the time and never tire of it
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this game! a little easy for me but good story line and kept me interested. i would recommend to anyone who enjoys ho games. played on kf hd.
0321701763|5.0|There are easy-to-follow tutorials that guide you through every lesson. An entire CD filled with examples you work from, along with 2 hours of video lessons. This is really a great book to learn Photoshop.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Ah so ssh ssh ssh ssh ghost ssh ssh ssh ssh ghoul flying flak to ssh ssh ssh ssh to to th then
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Pretty Hot And Tempting. Stumbled on these books by sheer accident. I'm not a \\"romance novel\\"  reader by no means. So if it were described to me as such I would have never read them. Didn't know I was a fan of erotica though. :) Its not a literary work of art. But if you just want to get lost in a book for a few moments a night while you significant other is away up it's a good outlet.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|It was full of action and the other side of the story is yet to come out soon. I liked it so much I would read it again
B001HN6EF4|5.0|I ordered this item after seeing it at a friend's house.  I had to have them as my kids and I, as well as friends at work, enjoy playing UNO.  They are slippery . . .understandably, but other than that, they have been great.  Much easier to shuffle for some, due to their elasticity.  They have a great look and just fun to play with.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Outstanding appealing events to the true nature of soldiers in combat. Down to earth reading which put you in the conflict overseas.
B005C7SXMS|4.0|Quirky and fun coming of age story with likeable main character.<br /><br />Oliver Tate is a too smart, somewhat peculiar fourteen year old in love with class mate, Jordana. His parents are having marital problems, and his mother's old flame has happened to move into the house next door.<br /><br />I didn't find all the characters likeable, but did find them unique and interesting. Oliver's dad is a dorky intellect, his mother screams internally for attention, so of course falls for the old flame when he gives it to her. The old flame is a pretentious new age guru.<br /><br />The only character I truly disliked was Jordana. She was a very unsympathetic character. She was a bully, which bothered me, as she got Oliver to bully at the beginning as well, which is the only thing I found troublesome about his character as he only did it to gain her affections. He did at least feel remorse for it. She treated him horribly but then expected him to be at her every beck and call.<br /><br />In the end there was a sort of happy ending like most movies about dysfunction. All in all, I really liked this movie. I think fans of dysfunctional family movies like Little Miss Sunshine and The Royal Tannenbaums will like this. I would have given it five stars had I not loathed Jordana so much.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|Didn't think the fourth Mission Impossible could possibly be as good as previous ones, but this one was.  Great action, decent plot.  Definitely entertaining.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|love a tv show that makes you think....this show does that....action, suspense. great show. cant wait till get season 2
0765325950|5.0|I was glad to finally read the end of this series after 20 some years. The book went over things so they were brought back to my memory and everything was tied in at last. It was a very good series and I enjoyed every book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy this free app.  It's very user friendly.  Amazon, keep giving us free games please.  I will continue to use them.
0786955570|5.0|I will list the reasons I recommend buying this game, but before the list I wanted to tell that I have had a great time with my two boys, 5 and 6 years old respectively. We have played every day since we bought it, and they keep asking for more. The game does not require a Dungeon Master, we all 3 play as Heroes, but since they are so young I still have a Dungeon Master role during the gameplay, just to keep thing fair and challenging, and not frustrating.<br /><br />It's easier than standard Role Playing books:<br /><br />1) You can read all rules in one hour, for sure you will need to read again some parts, but you will understand the whole game completely after just the first adventure.<br />2) There is only one dice, a 20 sided one.<br />3) Magic and Spells is supported by cards, which make them very easy to use and you will know when you cannot use the spell anymore.<br />4) All monsters and villains have a card, so its easy to access AC (Armour Class), HP (Hit Points) and Attacks (Hit chance modifier and damage)<br />5) Using tiles and 3D figures make it easier to follow the action, take turns and know the distance required for each ability.<br />6) A lot of provided tokens help on counting damage, tracking time, and even temporary effects of spells.<br /><br />It's faster to setup and finish<br /><br />1) You are not longer required to spend 4 hours creating the characters and 12 weekends to complete an adventure with your nerdy friends, you can setup an adventure in 5 minutes and have fun right away. You can finish it in around one hour, so the reward comes quicker.<br />2) I find the provided Adventure Book very simple yet very original and fun. I will tech you creatives ways to take advantage of the board game, so you can create your own adventures lates.<br />3) The Random dungeon creation is great, saves time, and no longer requires a Dungeon Master. So everybody can play as Hero, there is no more Nerdy Dungeon Master.<br /><br />Leaves Room for Imagination<br /><br />1) Even though rules are very basic, I find it to be very open to real role play, improvisation and storytelling.<br />2) My younger child, which is only 5 years old, wanted to play as a Werewolf instead of using one the Heros that came. I found that this was 100% possible, I just gave him the Werewolf card and the Werewolf 3D figure and he was super happy.<br />3) My older kid, 6 years old, wanted to have a wolf pet, and to share Hit Points between his Wizard and his pet, just as a \\"Familiar\\" on the classic D&D. I said, why not? As long as it's fun you can incorporate any Advanced D&D rule in this game.ion<br /><br />1) Even though rules are very basic, I find it to be very open to real role play, improvisation and storytelling.<br />2) My younger child, which is only 5 years old, wanted to play as a Werewolf instead of using one the Heros that came.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was a great find my friend recommended.  What head cases.  Love to watch how lives unfold between two characters.  Look forward to future installments of a train wreck we love watching, thanking our lucky stars it wasn't us.
0439023491|5.0|This one picks up right where you left off in Hunger Games and continues the wild ride.  The twists and turns keep your head turning.  You get to know the characters even more and feel their struggle.  So glad I could roll right into the final book because the ending of this one really leaves you hanging!
B00A3VLJCE|3.0|Great app, but it only gets 3 stars, because most of my photos go straight to dropbox, and when I use this app, there is no way to retrieve my photos from dropbox. If they add this feature, I will give 5 stars.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Even though I am all grown up I still loved this series.  I thought the writing was excellent and really painted a complete picture of this world.  I am glad I read the series back to back as I think the suspense between books might have killed me.  That said I was disappointed in the ultimate end to the book.  After all that Katniss and the other have been through I expected a more powerful statement ending but I thought it kind of ended with a whimper.  I guess after all they had been through Katniss and Peeta were too damaged for statements.  Still really enjoyed the series and highly recommend.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|James Bond as &#34;007&#34; ... just one of the best heroes ever in the movies. This genre is always a top choice for an evening of movie watching.
0439023521|5.0|I felt compelled to read this series after experiencing all the hype surrounding the movie.  I was not disappointed.  Although billed as YA it speaks to all audiences.  What a fascinating world Ms Collins has created, I felt for Katniss and all her friends as they struggled for survival.  In a story that could easily be depressing the book never took you there.  I am glad I was reading them back to back because I wanted to keep going after I finished this one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is one pf the best apps in the appstore if not the best.ive heard good things about the Pc version and my friend has the xbox version,and it was awesome!!.but I didn't think this one was any good,until I tried it.boy was I wrong!I tell you creative mode is the best ive made so much.I play this for at least 2 hours every day.in survival mode I do wish it had villages and villagers.it doesn't have ghasts or the nether world (as far as I know).but it is still worth the money.I do admit it is a bit steep but is great!!believe me don't try these rip offs like block story and mooncraft.learned that the hard way.and it doesn't require wi-fi if you don't do online.witch is another perk.it is so worth the 7 bucks.the only other thing I wish it could do is to play world wide play instead of havin to be side my side.buy you'll love it,trust me!!!!! :D
B00846F1YW|4.0|corny story but fun.<br />they will bug you for a review until you finally write one, well hopefully all the rating pop ups go away now.
B007LE2VDM|4.0|Not every song is a run away single, but there are some powerful and well executed songs on this album. Because it is so rare to find an album with so many great hits, I think this is an exceptional album. &#34;Distance&#34; is on the album in two great versions and is certainly the key draw. I also found Jar of Hearts, Arms, and Penguin to be phenomenal. None of the songs are bad, but these are ones I will be listening to consistently. There is one track, &#34;Interlude,&#34; that is only 51-seconds long. It could have been a great instrumental but it is ... just too short.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I ordered this book shortly after hearing that Chris Kyle (author) was killed. I recognized him from the &#34;Stars Earn Stripes&#34; reality show. His book is blunt, straight-forward and at times very funny. I believe it's a true reflection of who he was as a person and soldier.<br /><br />American Sniper takes the reader through Chris' life as a cowboy and SEAL sniper. His writing is so good, I could picture everything and felt like I was right there with him. He also provides brief historical references such as how SEALs came to be a military force. It's just enough information to keep non-military readers from saying, &#34;Huh?&#34; Chris' recounting of his wedding/honeymoon is both hilarious and somewhat sad, as it's a reminder of how difficult military marriages can be for the entire the family.<br /><br />It would have been a huge honor to meet him and his families (home and SEALs). I would highly recommend this book to anyone!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Could not put it down.  Great story about a true Texan Hero.  He tells it like it was.  He went thru tough times, but handled it and went on with his life.
B00009NQQO|4.0|I like this toy for my toddlers in the bath tub. They enjoy playing &#34;basketball&#34; in the water. The net does NOT have a hole in the bottom for the balls to fall all the way thru, which isn't a big deal cause it stores the balls for you when the kids are done playing with them. Suction works just fine as well. I'd recommend this as a good bath toy.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Better than most hidden object games, as the hidden objects are actually sporadic and the rest of the game consists of puzzles.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Cheryl has told an epic story of a heroine lost and found, a modern Odysseus struggling to find purpose in the downward spiral of her life. I immediately related to her experience losing her mom to cancer, having lost mine to ovarian cancer in 2005. I cheered for her every step, felt every blister, winced each time<br /> struggled to put Monster on... Great read!!
1451695195|5.0|The writing is complicated in his explanations.  Requires some background in science.  I don't think the skeptics will accept his explanation either, but I find it very deep.
1609611543|5.0|Really an eyeopener.  Knew something had been amiss for the last 50 yrs.  Now I understand why.  Great if you are a Celiac person.  After reading this I don't want to eat wheat anymore.
B001974DG0|5.0|No matter how many times I read this book it always gets me. I will always think that dogs are smarter than we know. Dean Koonts best novel ever.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|This is a very addictive little dice game.  Very fast game, so it's easy to pick up and play a few games quickly.  Enjoyed by the kids and adults in our family.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|My first Nicholas Sparks book and I loved it.  Cant wait to see the movie.  Plan on reading all of his books now.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Good &#34;pick-up put-down&#34; read. Author has the right idea about bad guys. a a a a a a a a
0761169253|5.0|This book is truly amazing. It inspires you to get out there are experiment, explore. Though it is under 200 pages, it is jam-packed with countless ideas that most definitely help you be creative. It is simply an inspiriting book, but must be not only read but also interpreted. Simply amazing. Changes everything.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Great DVD and one of the best James Bond Movies!<br />Great picture and color.  The sound is unreal!<br />Yes it was worth the money and I would recommend it for others.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I really liked this one. It starts with a boy who is unappreciated and unloved by his own father and three bothers. When he meets a sorcerer in a most unlikely place and then the boy decides to try to follow his dream and...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE YOU SUBWAY SURFERS!!!! This is so awesome and this game really occupies my time<br /> And this is also like the best game ever
B004USRLRS|5.0|This album is one of my all time favorites. It's full of songs in which you can understand the words to, tunes you can sing along with! In my lifetime I've owned it on vinal, 8-track, (2) cassettes, and now (2) CD's. If you don't know the album, give it a listen you just might love it!
B002RI9M2U|4.0|It was a very creative plot line that made you empathise with both Clay and Hannah as they told their stories. It was so sad to hear the 13th reason- that one made me realise to always look for the signs, just in case I don't see it.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|fun game. great way to spend some time. you can make it hard or easy. I like that. a little pricey though. but I guess it did keep me occupied for awhile.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|oops! could not get this thing to run on my device :(. I love the original this game but it didnt work on my phone I only get to play it on my friends phone i was hoping this version would work but still i cannot play on my version phone. ill borrow my friends here and there
B007FEFLTO|3.0|&#34;What is it, Boy?&#34;<br />&#34;You can marry the bitch now,&#34;<br />Then he died.<br /><br />The death of Boy was not exactly a literary master piece.
B0027MJU00|3.0|Good story..dark. Read it right on the heels of Gone Girl, though so it paled in comparison.  Overall I like her style of writing...psychologically smart and insightful.  Good quick read:)
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I love this album.  Every song is absolutely fabulous and the mix of songs, styles and musicians is fantastic.  Buy it.  I doubt you will be sorry.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|READ THIS BOOK!<br />Please! READ THIS BOOK! Have your husband read this book! You will not regret it and your marriage will improve!
B000SGGUWS|5.0|The book kept my attention and sometimes got my heart racing to see what was going to happen! Very well written
0785162348|5.0|This is a really cool compilation.  The artwork is awesome and overall it's quite informative.  This was a perfect gift idea for someone who loves everything comic book!
B001NHNG64|3.0|This is the second in the Jack Reacher series and already the author is following a rather rigid formula to telling his story: disengaged anti-hero, has to fight both the good-guys (police, FBI, etc.) and the bad guys.  Most of the time it is difficult to tell who is worse, good or bad guys.  The character has a mandatory fleeting afffair with a female character and moves on after he kills the required number of evil doers.  But once again it is mildly enjoyable.
0679809015|5.0|I gave this book to a little boy for his first birthday.  He loves books, so this small book is great for his little hands.
0545265355|5.0|I read this series previously and knew I just had to have them. I got this hardback set at a great price and have no complaints about the product, packaging or the seller.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|being 75 year of age I did not play this game but my grandkids love it. i don't play games.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|If you pick it up, you won't be able to put it down.  It is a very good read, sucks you right in to the story line.
1583334386|5.0|The book is based on scientific research and is very readable.  I love the practice exercises  throughout the book - they help you strengthen your willpower and bring greater awareness to your actions.  It is so helpful to know when your brain is working with you and when it is working against you.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I enjoy this sort of game.  This one is challenging, even in the easy mode. It keeps you moving back and forth between screens to find hidden pieces.  It runs very well on my kindle fire hd ,  and nearly as well on our xoom.  No complaints.
B008PU8SR4|5.0|Excellent story and a great read. Some great laughs too, and what an adventure this child had. Read it, it is fun and fact rolled into one.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Don't buy from this one.  I bought my mom the pink LifeProof case and it was cracked and not waterproof.  I emailed the company and no response. Have to try and contact amazon now.
0679805273|5.0|Can't believe how quickly this arrived. This is a great book. Nice hardback edition that I plan on having all of my daughters teachers' from K-12 sign and write a note and then I'll give it to her as a graduation gift.
1449410243|5.0|This soft-cover book captures the \\"cat attitude\\" perfectly!  Full of cartoons and quips, I very much enjoyed this book.  It would be a perfect gift for all cat-lovers everywhere!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|You won't be able to get the songs out of your head for weeks!!!! Addicting!!! Have already recommended to several friends :)
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love this game. The first time you play you may feel like giving up. Don't give up.  The urge to beat your own time is always there and you can tweet your times,too.
B00004X10B|5.0|I got this bag because my old Tamrac 8 was just out of room and I have to say, this bag is pretty big and fits everything I want in it and more.<br /><br />Pro's<br />Large size, many separate compartments, adjustable dividers inside, hard bottom and comfortable handle<br /><br />Con's<br />No rain cover<br /><br />If you have a lot in your bag or you have two bodies you need to carry this is the perfect bag for you, I have a lot in my bag, triggers, flashes, batteries, two bodies and 4-6 lens's, remotes, chargers, cables and so much more. everything fits and I still have room to add more goodies.<br /><br />I did a youtube video on it as well, search for Tamrac 5612 Pro 12 Camera Bag and I am Techrunnr Wesley
B008JIFJ4W|5.0|This is an amazing collection of music.  It has an 80's sound updated for today.  I like the emotional pull of the music and I like running to this recording!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Awesome game! My 8 year old daughter loves it!!!! She definately has me beat! I got a bit bored with the first Temple Run, but this one is amazing and literally hours of fun!
B009G8GRX6|5.0|Rock music is back in a big way!  This is rock music for our decade.  it is most certainly going to be a classic.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|I enjoyed the book and story, though didn't find it to be compelling. The story was touching, yet I found that I &#34;could&#34; put the book down,
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Hard to put down, in my car on my lunch break reading,mixed with immersion listening app to sleep.  Worth the time.  It's so funny I kept trying to turn the page on my kindle.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|I have been reading this book to my grand kids, and my kindergarten classes for over 20 years, have bought it a half a dozen times.  At least now on my kindle I won't have to pay for it again.  :O)
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Wonderful!! Great resolution, audio and service from Amazon.  Ended up buying season 3. This series is engaging and appropriate for varying ages.
B00881VLCE|3.0|The interface to scroll the puzzle pieces could be better.  It's easy to confuse between trying to pick up a piece or to scroll the list.  Also, there should be indication of when you are at the end of the list.  Also needs padding at the end of the scroll because the piece nearest the edge may look partially cut off (e.g., edges/corners pieces that line up with the side).
B009G78EE2|5.0|had a lot of people recommend me this CD, especially since Thrift Shop was in it.<br /><br />some of the lyrics are a bit hard to rhyhm with but that's a minor complaint.<br /><br />seems like macklemore and ryan actually put some effort into the songs.  No 'goin to the club' type stuff in here.  greatness :)
B002Y4Z4UQ|5.0|The Jackson 5 really had it together back then. Love them. Can't get enough of them. Great addition to my collection.
B009178OQA|4.0|The movie is a little long but overall good Mooovie, makes you want to go out for sushi. Yum, Yum...
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|EDIT: The mouse I originally reviewed ended up being defective. The double clicking per one click became an every click type of thing. The laser was constantly going into crazy mode (would jump everywhere). I contacted Anker, and they sent me a pre paid return slip and a new mouse with almost no questions asked. They were very kind and quick to the draw. I received my new mouse very quickly and sent the old one back to them. The new mouse had none of the issues I mentioned below about the feet and tracking. The laser on the new one is and always has been spot on, and the feet on this new one (while still probably being cheap) were attached properly and gave me no issues. No double clicking problem yet, and I've been using the new one for many many months. (I exchanged my old one after about a month or two)<br /><br />Let me start by saying that for the price, this mouse is absolutely sublime. While it did take me awhile to figure out my preferences, the software it uses is very easy to use and once properly configured, this mouse tracks very accurately on my Razer Goloiathus Control mousepad.<br /><br />Now, to be a bit more in depth<br />On a design front; this mouse is very aesthetically pleasing excluding the anchor logo. now this is just my opinion. it doesn't look bad at all but an anchor is not the type of design that I personally would like on my mouse. I understand why it is there though. the company is called Anker. it makes sense.<br /><br />Note however that you can change the color of the anchor and I must say the colors look very nice. It would be nice if you could change the other colors on the mouse but the anchor is the only light color you can.<br /><br />The weights are a nice touch and although they are a bit of a pain to get out of the mouse once they are in, they can give it a very nice feel.<br /><br />My MAIN gripe with the design is the cheap feet. They seem to be held on by rather cheap adhesive that was already falling off when I got the mouse. They kept catching my mouse pad. I was able to reattach them with little effort however and they haven't given me trouble since. The other thing is they aren't made out of rubber like most other mouse's so they did not slide around very nicely. Although after some use I got accustomed to it and I quite like it now.<br /><br />Control:(8/10)I'll start off by saying that when I first plugged this mouse in, I was NOT impressed. Compared to my TRON, it felt terrible. Even after I had installed the software, it didn't feel quite right. but after I spent a bit of time actually figuring out the buttons and configuring the profiles I ended up really enjoying it. Keep in mind I am VERY picky about controls though. I like to play games and I'm a bit competitive so control is very important to me.<br /><br />A slight gripe is that after about a month of use the double click seems a bit too easy to trigger. A couple times I've accidentally double clicked by only pressing the button once. Hopefully this issue doesn't get worse.<br /><br />Software: The software is pretty nice. You can remap the mouse buttons and set up DPI profiles. All in all good software and gets the job done.<br /><br />I really think this mouse is absolutely FANTASTIC for the price. I had a few gripes but foe this price the few gripes I had were very minor. Also the customer service seemed very courteous. I've received two emails asking how I enjoyed the product but I haven't actually contacted them.<br /><br />if you're looking for a cheap good gaming mouse or are wanting to transition to a gaming mouse without spending much I couldn't recommend this mouse more. Just give yourself some time to adapt to it.

B009JBZH54|5.0|Firstly, I am a Batman fan.  He is my second favorite superhero character (behind Dick Grayson actually), so when I write this review, I may be a little bias in my support of these three films.  My review is more topical and complete so I won’t go into a lot details, thus if for some reason you have not seen any of these films, this review will not spoil anything for you.<br />  The Dark Knight trilogy is fantastic, my second favorite trilogy (behind The Lord of the Rings).  I love how each film stands on its own and it is only the third which makes references to the previous films, but give you enough in case you missed either one.  In Batman Begins, we have, in my opinion, the greatest Batman film origin story you could possibly tell.  There are other Batman origin stories out there which are wonderful (like Batman: Year One) but Batman Begins has the more cinematic qualities to a big budget super hero film along with a very grounded, very personal starting place for both Bruce Wayne and Batman.  If Warner Bros. decided to re-boot Batman (as I feel they should in order to have a character which fits into a world with other superheroes and one who is more detective focused) I would strongly urge to just not create an origin story.  Just kick off with Batman as Batman, maybe from flashbacks to his parents’ murder, but do not try to compete with Batman Begins because, as origin stories for this hero go, you will not find a more perfect one.<br />  The Dark Knight is the best superhero film made to date.  It has every element of not only a great superhero film, but a great film in general.  You have a conflicted hero trying to separate himself from his alter ego, but you ultimately cannot.  There is a sort of hubris story where the very act of good is turned evil.  And a perfect villain, written and acted exceptionally to tear everything down.  The scope is epic and yet the characters make it feel like a small movie at times.  The Joker is the villain he is always supposed to be.  He is chaotic, psychotic, mischievous, murderous and always one step ahead of the great detective.  The character is played beautifully by Heath Ledger who give the character real life and depth while, at the end of the film, we really know very little about him which only adds to the terror that the Joker is meant to inspire.<br />  The trilogy wraps up with The Dark Knight Rises, which, once I realized this is not intended to be a traditional superhero film, I was able to appreciate the movie for what it was.  It is the end of a legend, but not the one you think.  This ends the legend of Bruce Wayne and established the true legend of Batman.  The acting in this third film is all-around the best of the series with greater performances by all the veterans and the new comers.  It is a broad scoped plot all fit wonderfully together and held their by Bane.  Traditionally not a primary villain, Bane become more in this film and the link to the League of Shadows (primary villains in Batman Begins) was a wonderful way to bring Bane on equal ground with Batman.  The story has everything you want as a fan and moves along at a very quick pace to the war-like finale in Gotham City.  It was a very fitting end to the Christopher Nolan Batman era.<br />  While I would have liked to see certain elements in the trilogy, namely the inclusion of Dick Grayson (not Robin) in the final chapter (Dick provides a father-son relationship with Bruce which links him back to his father) I was very happy with the end results.  Some characters die that you don’t expect to and the overall history of Batman is altered which, in the end, I was okay with.  If you are familiar with the comics or other films, what is important to realize is that this Batman is in another universe that the other stories.  It is a more realistic universe where villains like Clayface or Killer Croc would not be able to exist, along with superheroes like Superman or Wonder Woman.  In this universe, this trilogy tells the complete legend of Bruce Wayne and the first chapters in the legend of the Batman.<br />  Overall, I give the trilogy a 5 out of 5 putting up on par with the trilogy The Lord of the Rings, and very much like the Greek legends told in poems like The Odyssey and The Iliad.is trilogy tells the complete legend of Bruce Wayne and the first chapters in the legend of the Batman.<br />  Overall, I give the trilogy a 5 out of 5 putting up on par with the trilogy The Lord of the Rings, and very much like the Greek legends told in poems like The Odyssey and The Iliad.

B0041KVZ1I|1.0|Although I have the remastered CD of Abbey Road, I decided to treat myself and buy the vinyl version.  Big mistake.  Commencing on the first side starting with the third song, the high ends are distorted.  I first thought it was my equipment.  However, when I played the White album I just received, it sounded great.  It was clearly the album. I am returning it since I know I will never listen to it again.  I am dissapointed. The Beatles are my favorite band and I was looking forward to owning this on vinyl.  Save your money and buy the remastered CD of this album, which sounds amazing.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|This movie just covers the time period just prior to making Psycho through the premier.  The story telling draws you in and if you watch carefully, cinematographer plays homage to Hitchcocks filming techniques at just the right moments.<br /><br />Anthony Hopkins was completely believable as Alfred and should really have had a nomination for this role in my opinion, but even in Death, Hitch gets snubbed by the Oscars.<br />Helen Mirren was fabulous as always<br />Scarlet Johansson was...eh ok<br />and all the other supporting actresses played their parts well.<br /><br />Great fun movie to watch.
B000QUCNOK|5.0|Arrived promptly and in good conditions. Bought used so i knew case was cracked. plays very well. I really love this movie. It had me at the edge of my seat. The story is based on the gift of smell. And the drive to retain a certain one. The main character does a good job at making you sad and mad at the same time ...for doing what he does to women which is to murder just to retain the one smell that captured his attention and he can no longer have. Its a psychological and emotional movie. Would highly recommended this for the mature audience. I would probably use that kind of gift for making me the best in the business of perfume making.
B008I6ZX1E|5.0|Excellent version of this hard cover publication. Better than other hard cover existing in the market. Very happy with this purchase.

B005S9EKCW|4.0|Christmas day, 11am, I was there.  I am a big fan of musicals, so I loved watching a movie with \\"live\\" singing.  I wasn't that familiar with the story going in, and fortunately it was very understandable on the big screen.  I instantly became enthralled.  The first scene with the prisoners dragging the massive ship was incredible.  Fantine was excellent, and she did have a significant role.  I felt she did have an adequate amount of screen time and her her scenes were packed with evocative acting.<br /><br />The singing was top notch, Eddie Redmayne in particular.  Some of the notes he hit were so high, pure and perfect.  Russell Crowe has gotten a bad rap for his singing, but I really thought it was fine given that he plays a character you're not supposed to like anyway.  Hugh Jackman was so handsome with his curly hair.  I didn't like the revolution part so much, but it was obviously part of the story and the second time I saw the movie it wasn't as long as it seemed on my first viewing.  Not to give anything away, there was a scene when there were tears galore.  Go and see it, see it, see it.
B004WGIXX4|4.0|It's a strong film given that there are many others out there with similar story lines. It's rather predictable, although the role reversal (female lead is the hesitant one, in this case) gives it a nice twist. The cast makes the film worth the watch.
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|We did not hate the first episode, rather slower than what we anticipated.<br />Expecting some new surprises and twists.<br />We still love the show.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|When my Galaxy SIII was updated, the new Samsung keyboard would no longer auto-correct.  This presented obvious issues which eventually led me to install SwiftKey.  Since it auto-corrects, it was immediately a better choice than the Samsung keyboard but I had some initial growing pains.  I had become accustomed to hitting the space bar twice to add a period.  I also like to put two spaces after my periods.  Due to SwiftKey's predictive typing, I can no longer do this.  This was annoying at first, however, the time savings from taking advantage of SwiftKey predicting what I am going to type next made (and continues to make) the sacrifice worth it.  I also really like the fact that it will auto-correct with spaces in the middle of words.  For instance if I type, &#34;onebday&#34; it recognizes that I probably meant to hit space instead of the letter b and offers &#34;one day&#34; as the likely word I was trying to type.  I have been wanting this feature in auto-correcting from the very beginning.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Highest rating available.<br />We love storyline. I like romance, husband likings fighting scences.<br />We love epic stories. Looking forward to season two.
B001P1MZNI|5.0|When I was in high school in the 1960s, music was about the only thing my dad and I had in common. HIS music, not MINE! (My r&r was too much for him and he hated it all.) Because of him and my mom, I grew up with an appreciation of the Great American Songbook and The Rat Pack in particular.<br /><br />This concert in Las Vegas is Sinatra as I remember him and the glamorous ring-a-ding days! I was lucky enough to see Sinatra perform in NYC in 1975 with Basie (and special guest Ella Fitzgerald); Sinatra at the Sands is as good a representation of his music as any I've heard. Great sound mixing and a terrific selection of Sinatra in the 70s!
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|I was a fanatic of SG1, but never bothered to watch SG Atlantis until I subscribed to Amazon Prime.  It is a great series and every bit as action-packed as SG1.
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|Not Hunt for Red October or Cardinal in the Kremlin. He seems to be trying to shoehorn 'news of the day' into many of his latest books. It's fast light reading but I miss the old style he used to have. OK buy it if you're board otherwise pass on this series.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Dear people;<br />  Subway surfer is my life, I play it everyday because I know that if I try and try finally I will get a score that will be able to unlock all of the characters even the limited time one and all of the board also the limited time one and still have a few coins to get Hoover boards and more. What I am trying to say is that subway surfer is a great challenge and I know there is people out there that dislike subway surfer but I don't I love it you should try before you say you never want to play it again!!!
B001EC2IXK|5.0|OMG! I love this movie so much and Paul Newman is my favorite actor! I didn't realize that Dennis Hopper is in this movie too - as Babgulatz or some crazy name! Anyway, this is a great old movie and I really enjoyed it on my iPad!
0740797719|5.0|I will never regret this purchase. The book is incredibly comprehensive  and is written in simple and very easy to understand manner. It's like each word used in the book has been carefully chosen to explain the concept in the most effective way. And the approach is scientific.<br /><br />The glossary is really helpful.<br /><br />Highly recommended to students, professionals, hobbyists, and those who are trying to self-teach.

B007SGM084|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed these books.. many readers will see things that they couldn't envision… but it really all boils down to limits & trust, even in matters of the heart.<br />I did find many similar events to the movie \\"Pretty Woman\\" … were they intentional, that I don't know. Overall, this book is a Must Read!!!
B00A85EMVK|3.0|Well I was a little disappointed in the 3-D. It does seem a little crisper but nothing to write home about. Still a good movie just don't plan on being wowed by the 3-D part of it.

0061726834|4.0|I have very mixed feelings about this book. On one hand I absolutely loved it and could hardly stop myself from reading the entire book in one sitting, on the other hand - I was a little bit underwhelmed by some aspects of it. Delirium is definitely a very unique and memorable book. It's categorized as a dystopian novel, but it reads more like a very dramatic and beautiful love story. It's slow moving, but evenly paced and with a great build-up to a heart-pounding cliff-hanger ending. It's also meaningful, reflective, emotionally affecting (though - I must admit - not as much as I expected it to be), and intensely readable.<br /><br />  Lauren Oliver created a world that is both intriguing and very creepy. Cold, emotionless, cruel, violent and built almost entirely on lies. World where love is considered a deadly disease and people need to be &#34;cured&#34; of it. And if they can't or refuse to be &#34;cured&#34;, they're either forced to have the procedure (which is something like lobotomy), or they end up imprisoned in the Crypts or dead. The &#34;cureds&#34;, as well as the children waiting to be &#34;cured&#34;, live in a city surrounded by walls and electric fence, guarded day and night by the police. Outside the fence are the Wilds, where the Invalids are rumored to live like animals. The government controls everything, terrorizing people with violent raids and brainwashing them with carefully prepared propaganda. It's one crazy town I would never want to live in...<br /><br />  Lena is almost 18. When we meet her, it's exactly 95 days from when she's scheduled to have her procedure. And she is looking forward to that day. Growing up she witnessed what amor deliria nervosa does to people. She has seen it first hand. First her mother killed herself, then her sister had to be forced to have the procedure because she wasn't careful enough and got infected. Lena knows exactly how dangerous deliria is, and she can't wait to finally be safe from it; cured. But things are not what they seem to be and Lena is about to discover the truth about the world she lives in and the people she trusts. She's about to meet someone who will shatter all her illusions to pieces and flip her world inside out.<br /><br />  Let me start by saying how much I enjoyed Oliver's writing style. Her prose was beautiful, almost poetic, but not overwhelmingly so. I enjoyed her reflective and descriptive passages, intelligent observations and the slow pace of the story. She did a remarkably great job depicting Lena's thoughts and emotions, bringing her character to life, and while I personally didn't connect with Lena as much as I hoped I would, I most certainly thought her to be believable and convincing. There was something about her though, that prevented me from being fully involved with her story. I didn't necessarily dislike her, I just didn't feel any strong connection with her as a lead heroine. I found myself connecting more with Alex and Hana for sure. Lena seemed too withdrawn and uncertain most of the time, too insistent on hiding inside her protective shell, living in denial. She was too eager to believe in all the lies that people around her have been spoon-feeding her. I know why she was like that, I understand what made her like that, but I just can't help feeling distant from her. Thankfully, towards the end of Delirium she morphs into someone entirely different, someone I felt comfortable rooting for and caring about, and I'm really looking forward to seeing more of her character growth in the next books.<br /><br />  The world building in Delirium, while very thorough and creative, has left me asking many questions. I wasn't entirely sold on the idea behind this book, I just couldn't understand why love of all things has been identified as the most dangerous thing for the human kind. But that is the premise here and so we roll with it. For me, the only reasonable explanation is that the government used deliria as an excuse to create theoppressive system and gain full control over the society (which makes it so much more scary!). I'm very excited to learn more about this world of Delirium, explore the Wilds and see what other lies will be uncovered in the next instalments.<br /><br />  There are some truly heart-breaking / terrifying moments in this book (the scene with the neighbors' dog, things Lena sees in the Crypts, everything that happens in the last chapter) and I was definitely emotionally affected by all that, but at the same time there are other things in this book that were meant to be scary, too, and I did not perceive them to be so. I'm talking about the government itself. Perhaps it's because there is no evil villain in this book, no single person/group of people to blame and fear. The enemy is the entire system, and though we have raiders and regulators, and we know there is someone out there pulling all the strings, it's just too vague an idea for me. On top of that, I couldn't help but question the government's intelligence. Am I the only one who thought all the government people seemed very unintelligent? They were sloppy, their actions often seemed primitive and random and all I could really picture in my head was a mindless mob blindly following orders that came from God knows where. A bunch of simple-minded people with guns, beating people with sticks, torturing them in the Crypts and making sure the rest of the society is scared into obedience. Yes, that alone is pretty terrifying, but not as much as having someone clever and ruthless (someone like President Coriolanus Snow from the Hunger Games) after you.<br /><br />  Some plot developments were a tad predictable (Lena falling in love with a boy not long before her procedure, etc), others caught me totally off guard (pretty much everything that happened in the last 6-7 chapters). The cliffhanger ending left me utterly speechless. I knew this would happen, and yet the way Oliver wrote those final scenes had me sweating and frantically turning pages. I don't know how many more cliff-hangers like that my poor heart can take. It was pounding like crazy!<br /><br />  Overall, I really loved this book. Maybe not as much as I thought I would based on all the hype surrounding it, but it still made a huge impression on me. Lauren Oliver is undoubtedly a very talented writer and I see myself pre-ordering every single one of her upcoming books in the future.

B004I2K4E8|5.0|We've been fans for a couple decades. However , not a big fan of Nick Jonas in this lineup and he was overly promoted. Jonas sounds a bit nasally but gives an OK performance. The rest of the cast is superb and delivers excellent emotion. Stellar encore performance with multiple historic casts coming up on stage to perform, worth every penny!<br />Picture and sound quality are awesome, blow our DVD versions away.

B002RI9TB4|5.0|An absolutely amazing book. I never really understood anything about the Biafran war untill I read this book. The charactures were so easy to related to and so easy to love. I never wanted the book to end. My son of 20 recommended the book to me as he was reading it at UCT. So sad and so brilliant.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|THOROUGHLY ENJOYABLE WITH AN OBVIOUS MESSAGE FOR THOSE OF US ARE EXPERIENCING CHANGE OF LIFE DECISIONS. ALSO IT MAY PROVIDE THOUGHTFUL INCITE TO YOUNGER VIEWERS. EVEN IF  YOU DO NOT SEE THE MESSAGE, WELL THE MOVIE IS STILL HIGHLY ENTERTAINING!
B007FJFDXS|3.0|In this game you move a cube around on the level picking up glowing dots and moving to the finish. It is basically Super Monkey Ball but with squares and without monkeys (which is never a good thing.) The levels are well designed, the graphics look great and the game has a great polished feel to it. I just didn't find it that much fun. And I thought that moving the cube around, which is done by sliding your finger in the direction you want it to roll, harder for a full roll, softer for a slight tip or roll, wasn't intuitive and blocked the screen. This is a good game, but not my thing.
B00AJLHUAS|4.0|If you're a Bryan Ferry / R.M. fan you probably know about this record.<br />If you don't, or if you're a casual browser, this isn't really a Bryan Ferry record.<br /><br />Know this straight away: there are no vocals on this recording.<br /><br />It's Bryan Ferry and Roxy Music songs rearranged in a 20's jazz style. He doesn't play on this at all, merely producing.<br />I suppose you could consider this sort of a companion piece to \\"As Time Goes By\\", the record from a few years back of pop standards.<br /><br />If you like early Duke Ellington or Louis Armstrong's Hot Fives / Sevens, you'll get a kick out of this - it's an interesting and reasonably faithful tribute.<br /><br />Perhaps the real value of this is that it has the potential to introduce some of the greatest music in history to a new audience.<br /><br />Hardcore Ferry fans have probably bought this already, so if you're casual or wondering, it's a retro-treat that's a blast, so pour yourself some giggle water, grab your sheba or your shiek and throw this on your orthophonic - it's ducky!!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|You start with a small bacteria (virus) in a single country. As it spreads, you get points to mutate its DNA to make it more lethal, more contageous, or more hard to cure. Your goal is to kill every human on the planet. As far as goals go, that kinda sucks for us. But the point here is well made: life is fragile and the right virus could be devastating. The good news is that killing all the humans is very tough.<br /><br />As you play through you unlock different types of Viruses as well. (You can also buy to unlock them and also the add-on, which is a blast and changes up the whole game.) The difficulty gets harder as you go. This is a very well made, tough strategy game. Worth the money.
B00A85EMVK|5.0|I will never forget seeing Top Gun in the summer of '86.<br /><br />The movie blew my 10 year old mind.<br /><br />But if you had told me then that within 30 years I would sit down and watch Top Gun in 3-D... that would have just sent me over the top.<br /><br />Many years ago I had a VHS copy of this movie that I darn near wore out.  I have seen it many, many times.<br /><br />This 3-D edition took me back to the summer of '86.  It was like seeing Top Gun again for the first time.<br /><br />The 3-D is excellent.  It adds a sense of space and danger.  When Maverick goes head to head with a mig you feel the closeness of the flyby.<br /><br />I was hesitant to buy a movie that I have already seen so many times, but as a 3-d demo and as a refreshing new way to see an old favorite I quite enjoyed this.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Classic Nicholas sparks. Just wish it was a series would love to know what happens after the end.  Can't wait to see the movie now!
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is very easy to use. No bells and whistles. Just straight to the point. I highly recommend to anyone with a kindle fire hd.
B00181JGI2|1.0|A waste of time. I imagine that stoners liked this movie. Some Jeff Bridges worst and that is really saying something.
0913866156|3.0|I bought these as a gift for someone and I'm going to be honest, the artwork is beautiful but beyond that I don't see what was so great about these.  There are several, more reasonably prices Tarot decks out there that are even more beautiful than this one.
B00881VLCE|4.0|VERY nice. Using only the free puzzles it works well. I like the option of being able to pick the number of pieces you want to work with.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|&#34;Elementary&#34; is all excellent police drama which needs to be watched from the beginning in order to truly appreciate the character development.  Contains excellent writing and cast.  The story-line is engaging and the characters are believable.  The concept is fresh with absolutely no internal historical references to Conan-Doyle anywhere.  I cannot imagine anyone who watches this NOT becoming a fan!
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|This book will not be the same every time you read it.  Remember to red read every day. This book is awesome and cool
B003274QH6|5.0|What can you say about this series? It is interesting exciting and thought provoking. Would you go as far as Walt to save and support your family. And how in the world did he choose Jesse as his partner. Great series, highty recommend.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|What a read.  I never realized how amazing this story was. Upset I waited until now to read it. Rich detail and intense characters. The development of their stories were great. Onto Clash of Kings!
B00B8ESWAM|1.0|This movie is crap. Period. What a waste of my time! Do not waste your money. Watching this move is like watching paint dry.
0307895475|4.0|I would have given it a 5 star but the print is so small that my old eyes have trouble reading the index. It is over all well organized and fairly easy yo find information in. Even though I don't have the DLC expansions yet I am glad they were included in the manual.
B000L53D4O|5.0|Because the baby likes it plays with it all the timeIts a very safe toy to walk & play with
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|in this movie they you find out how old he is.  intense fight scenes and you run in to some new people like gambit and dead pool.
B009O2XY12|4.0|I really enjoy these types of games.  My 1 year old daughter loves to watch me play, I think she really likes to see the animals get freed.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I like this movie a lot and have been a fan of the past Bourne movies.  I missed Matt Damon in this series but I thought Jeremy Renner did a fantastic job in the movie.  I wish there was more action and fighting scene but it was nice that it wasn't identical to the other 3 movies.
B009VB97EY|3.0|The men were nice to look at however the story line did not keep my attention.  I liked the music.
B0049VVE7Y|4.0|What can I say, I'm guilty of loving Sci-Fi. This first season is good, but not great. Most of the scenes pretty cool. I have to admit if I where alone at night watching this I would jump and run for the people several times. HD is great, I'm hooked. Thanks Amazon for a good watch and season.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|Despite the reviews I previously read for this book, I found it dull, long, and boring. Despite this,I managed to read my way to the end.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|The blue rays are great.  They were a gift for a friend that was very surprise<br />d to get them.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Awesome. Kids love this game. Even my two year old son can play it. Hopefully you come out with another one.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I use this with my Nexus 7 and it is tastefully wonderful.  Fits like a charm, adds style, and provides protection!  Unfortunately, I paid almost twice as much for mine at a local retailer.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|love all the puzzles!!! were tough enough to keep me interested! ! would recommend. this game to anyone that loves to work their brain
B009G8GRX6|5.0|Muse is a great band, and this album is their best one yet.  It is theatrical and dramatic, it reminds me of if Queen had done a soundtrack with danny elfman for a tim burton film.
B004K58GSO|4.0|A wonderful show to watch that you and the kids can enjoy.  John Wayne and others a good wholesome western
B00AHXIC50|4.0|Right at about half the songs on this album are amazing, then their are a couple that just sound too 80's or not Bruno Mars' style.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|What a great way to stay in touch with family and friends...try it and I am sure you will enjoy this application
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book makes you feel good knowing that there are people who still believe in America and are willing to sacrifice everything for us so we can feel safe.... God bless the men and women who serve in the military for giving us that feeling.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|The dreams have stayed a bit and after watching this a light hearted one took hold.The children in your lives will enjoy it. Ages (1)to (???) like I said enjoy and Dream a littel Dream.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|It was a good movie. Denzel Washington is a great actor. The movie would have been just as good without the nudity at the beginning.
1616550414|5.0|The package came earlier than expected and came at a reasonable price. It's a great collector's item if you didn't get the other limited edition.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I love this show!!! Jessica Lange was Amazing as well as the rest of the cast. Dark, totally disturbing and just brilliant!!!

B00BESM14U|5.0|This movie is one of the best I've seen in a long time. It's not one of those that seems made just for the box office, but that's kind of a good thing. It's all about the story and the delivery of it, which is refreshing. I highly recommend you give this one a shot. Enjoy.
0140177396|5.0|My youngest daughter is an avid reader and loves re-reading books she was assigned in English class. In fact, she is a collector of these required assigned readings such as Of Mice and Men.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Enjoyed this, but it seemed less exciting then #1 and #2.  Of course one has to read the entire trilogy, but this last one seems a bit tedious and tended to go on longer than I thought it should.
B00821OX98|4.0|I don't usually write comments about movies, even when they bring tears to my eyes. But this was unusually good and deserves some praise. Good time spent watching series.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Loved it. I was surprised the ruby red slippers were actually sparkly and silver. I wanted to read these before the new movie.
B0096PYUE2|1.0|I open it up and it's full of empty files with names on them all empty what the hell.<br />I down load a videos and guess were it went.
B000EYK4KI|4.0|I was interested in seeing how different this would be from the version I usually watch.  It is extended indeed, and a scene or too can drag on. Love it nevertheless!
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I  am a twihard fan. i watched the movie over and over.  i love the movie. u should watch it.
B00A89ITZG|4.0|An excellent training guide. Does a great job of explaining some of the more complex exercises. Absolutely would recommend it
0060751967|5.0|I love the book. I choose this becasue read book 10 before read this  book and I want how it starts.  if u like vampire book u should read this book. i like this book. I do not think the name ok the book, do not do it justice. I wish it did end, but it did. I ready like the book and I hope book two will be so good. I wish the sex see were a little longer.  The two main charters were funny. I like the chamcey between them.  They never marry, but the end of the book they said they will get marry.  I wish the book was little longer and the acutely got marry. The guy is the vampire and he is so so remcoic. In other vampire book, they decade vampire sex as they are in tube and the vampire bite the human and lick the human wombs, they are naked. In this book, vampire sex mean, they are not in the same room. The vampire mind controls the human. Vampire make the human think he have sex and touching her everyone with has many army and hand has he wants.  But the vampire does not know what she look like at the moment and can't take clost off the human.  Vampire sex only do if the human open her mind to him. The main charters keep do vampire sex. I like vampire sex in this book. They finally do human sex at the end of the book. I like it when the vampire loses his a fig and the human was trying it fix it and the vampire was not staying put. The human said do u want fix it or do u want to have oral sex?  I was shack the vampire was a virgin. He said the only  had vampire sex as long as I was vampire(and 150years) and when I was I was a monk and I made vows.  I wish the ending was more detail. But it was not. You should read this book. I give it A+++++.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|Packaging for a used movie was mint. Exceeded my expectations and arrived promptly. Will seek out business for next purchase.

B0063IH60K|5.0|I'm having such a great time with this game.  i usually play on my home computer.  I've recently downloaded the<br />ebook format.  It's sooooo much fun. I'm constantly trying to beat my previous time.  Loads of fun.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I pop this movie in when ever I need a bit of a pick me up which odd considering the ending.  I think the story is great & the songs are really well done and I adore that they made a musical commentary & included fan videos.  I loved the music & commentary musical so much that I bought the soundtracks for both of them as well and I STILL listen to them in the mornings at work on a regular basis because they make me happy.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|I have had this headset for 3 months now. They work great i use them with pc because they were very affordable. Great bass and mic quality and sound quality. Use these if you are a moderate to casual gamer and don't be to rough with them.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|I didn’t read the series when I started watching, but I have heard a lot about the HBO series so I decided to check it out. From the very first episode I was hook and decided to read the books. It is more than a fantasy story. It is about human nature as all good stories are. There are good characters and there are bad characters, but good and evil have never been as black and white as more shallow stories have portrayed. This is what I like about it. The good guys have bad, even disgusting aspects to their nature. The bad guys have good and even honorable values. They only difference between many of the characters is simply the side fate has landed them on. This makes the story very real to life. Of course, I also like the depth of the plot, which cannot really be told fully in the TV series, the richness of the world with all of its history, and the terror of the white walkers. All of these elements combine to create a story that is intriguing and immense.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This app is very good, not just you can dowload videos from youtube really fast but you can also convert it mp3 so you have two useful things in only one app

B00AFEYUVG|2.0|I was eagar to see this movie, as Emma Watson being in it, I felt it must be good...Sad to say..I was very disappointed...The story lacks luster...it is a bit dull & boring. I could barely watch the whole movie without falling asleep.<br />  I did find the concept nice of the boy who had noone, as so many of us do when in school..aquired 2 new friends..who introduced him to other people....
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a game that keeps u thinking. We love it.<br />You have to use that part of your brain for reasoning.
B005MMYBXI|5.0|Great mini series that was put together while the health of the star actor was in question (he died and was replaced)
B009EEFTMC|5.0|There is nothing to dislike about this game other than I spend too much time playing.  As my heading says, the pretty colors of the block got me to look at it and then.......all was lost, I purchased it and have been playing ever since.  Also hooked my son-in-law on the game.  Buy it, if you have the time to be lost in the colors and all the many ways to move the block around to find matches!!!
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Must I write a review, if you love James Bond movies you will definitely love this one. Its a must see.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Loved this movie! The singing is great and story is very satisfying and funny. I enjoy this movie so much I keep rewatching it.
B004H4XDBI|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! If I Stay is my favorite book of all time. Actually. This book was a great summation of the two. However, I still like the first one more.
159420411X|4.0|Mr Silver does an excellent job of explaining how we can use statistics to describe uncertainty, and uses several relevant examples. Hurricane and weather prediction; poker; economic and political forecasting; climate change: these are well-analyzed and cogently explained.<br /><br />My only minor quibble is with his description of noise in one chapter. He includes both random noise and competing signals in his noise definition: I would have placed the undesired signals in the category of interference, not noise, which is consistent with communications engineering.<br /><br />Overall, the book is great read and a well written primer on critical thinking. It should be required reading for every high school senior in the country.
B0001Z37HM|4.0|The midieval stories are always great.  They offer action, adventure and some violence.  I like this movie because it brings a world that is so different from the one we live on.  Dangerous, it is but no of what happens is real.  The movie gets us into another realm that we can jump in and come out of it for two magical hours of entertaiment.
B0083GOPSG|3.0|This movie started out great and was going along great. Not happy with how things were resolved at the end. Too predictable
B002SS8S7E|5.0|cool to see where it all began. Saw this one last, but it tied everything together, more with the last movie than second.
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|I'm a big fan of the games and loved most of the movies. This one probably didn't need to get made as it added nothing new to the story.
B001CEE1YE|1.0|Ordered this expecting The Complete Matrix Trilogy box set. After opening I realized it was the British import version. Description didn't say it was a import. Who wants another countries movie ratings and cases that don't match rest in your collection. 5 stars for amazon sending a call tag and refunding purchase after it was opened
B008J34466|5.0|One of my favorite artists. Love the album. I don't think there is much more I  can say about this.
B0035JRVBO|2.0|The movie was great, the problem was with the instant streaming service.  It was terrible.  The video stopped and started and was jumpy so the audio did not match the video. Very annoying to watch.  Next time will make the drive to the video store instead of renting from Amazon
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I love Robert Downey Jr. This movie is great - not as great as the first one, but great nonetheless.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was so sweet and I loved every page! The characters were so easy to love and I recommend I to people who love a good romance!

0307361012|4.0|Seven Harry Hole mysteries have appeared in English, and now the first in the series has been published in that language.  In it are the seeds of the future installments about the Norwegian detective, apparently the only one in the country with experience of having solved a case of serial murder.  It begins in this debut novel when Harry is sent to Australia after a young Norwegian woman was found raped and murdered.  His instructions:  to observe and not get in too deep.<br /><br />Of course, Harry can't resist when it becomes obvious that any number of unsolved rapes and murders with a similar MO have occurred Down Under and the police are unaware of the fact and have no clues.  And in his inimitable manner, Harry jumps in with both feet.  Along the way, he learns about Australia, its culture, and its people, both white and indigenous.<br /><br />\\"The Bat\\" is the foundation of the Harry Hole series, from which future novels evolved.  It has all the excellent attributes of the books already published, and Harry's character is defined.  However, was is a first effort, and, as such, might have used rewriting and editing to a greater extent.  There are long tracts and descriptions that read like a travelogue which add little to the over-all story.  Nevertheless, it reads well and is a welcome addition to the series.  Now, all that remains to hope for is an English translation of \\"The Cockroaches,\\" the second novel in the series, and a new Harry Hole book as well.<br /><br />Recommended.
B000002UZU|5.0|This a great blues album. \\"Hooker N Heat\\" is a double disc collection, the first disc is John Lee Hooker accompanying himself on electric guitar. On the second disc he is tastefully accompanied by the west coast blues rock band Canned Heat. On so many of Hookers early studio recordings \\"The Boogie Man\\" was forced to work with studio musicians who didn't recognize the genius of his groove based, somewhat unpredictable, and idiosyncratic style. Often you would hear the band play chord changes that they thought should be there rather than following what John Lee was actually playing. This match up, with a popular white blues rock band of the time, may have begun as marketing ploy but turned out to be a match made in blues heaven. The talented young musicians in Canned Heat, accomplished bluesmen in their own right, obviously respected John Lee Hooker and recognized the value of his unique style. Likewise Hooker seems to genuinely enjoy playing with these young bluesmen, especially the late great harp man Alan \\"Blind Owl\\" Wilson. This album captures the essence of what happened when two generations of American blues musicians got together for a jam in 1970.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is fast to open, easy to use and understand,  but do not let the simplicity fool you, there is a lot of power behind the advanced features. I would recommend this to anyone in the market for a good calculator.
B008TT7CXW|5.0|First off, I didn't expect to use this. It was one of the few things I ordered having gotten into SD cards and I was just looking for ways to safely store them. Out of the three other things I tried, this one is awesome. It's easy to insert and remove the cards (unlike the little booklets) and takes up almost no space (unlike the &#34;heavy duty&#34; boxes with foam inserts). The only concern I have about this is losing it, but I'm getting some phone straps (and this product has a hole for them) and I'll tether it to my USB drive.<br /><br />Another suggestions: put masking tape over the spots to label the card slots, as it doesn't look easy to wipe permanent marker off the labels in case you change your mind on what goes where.<br /><br />Love it, simple and excellent. Ordering a second.
B008M87GJK|4.0|Good honest broadcasting without all the hype.  Since I get this on my PBS station, I haven't really used it much on my Kindle.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I chose this book because a friend if mine had recommended it to me. I started reading it and couldn't put it down. I absolutely loved it and can't wait to see the movie!
B0063GORYU|3.0|Simple to Play card game.  Another way to pass time when there's nothing else to do.  The screen could be larger.
B007N31ZLA|5.0|Amazing movie and great deal. Paul Newman and Robert Redford are outstanding and the picture quality of the discs is great. Highly recommend to any movie lovers.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I will never get the hang of this thing.  Guess I'm just not exciting enough or have friends who enjoy doing all the posting of pictures, etc.

B0042TV4IW|5.0|and as soon as I began watching it I discovered it had been cancelled. Now, that makes sense, several lovey stories that could have continued on for quite a while, a supremely successful BBC series and they cancelled it because it had been on a while? Seriously? Devoted followers are usually courted as long as they can possibly be, until all the flavor is gone. How many series do I own that are 10 seasons long? That I watched devotedly and then bought on DVD?<br /><br />This is one of them. BBC, you screwed up on this one.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A very neat device, always handy to have. I urge everyone to download this item, go, go, go, go, download. Thank you.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This does a good job of conveying the lifestyle of career military folks in the special forces.  I can't say if it's factual, but it was entertaining.
1401201911|5.0|Much like Flashpoint, you want to know more about this alternate universe. You want to see more characters and explore the different attitudes and ideals our heroes have being giving a different upbringing. Great writing and great artwork, a must read for any superman/DC fan. And yes, the Dark Knight makes an apperance, among others.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I had seen the movie before reading this, so I already had preconceived notions about what I would like. While somewhat similar to the film, there were some glaring differences that allowed me to appreciate this in a totally different way. The author creates a likable-though-flawed protagonist. You really root for Pat. He is complex and enigmatic, but boy do you root for him. Some characters receive less fleshing out in the novel than in the movie--Pat's dad, for example. But overall, this is worth a read. Told from a unique perspective, there are a lot of smiles and tears here

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Being able to see the equation entered it a very nice function. That alone would make it worth while to me but it also has superior style and is easy to read on small screens. It works flawlessly and is all you could ask for in a calculator. The price is better than great!

0743243153|1.0|A CLASSIC?<br />I was a kid when this book was released, and now as an adult in the mental health profession I thought I'd see why it was so popular. Honestly, I couldn't get very far because he went on personal rants about his own opinions and personal experiences, similar to other stuffy psychs I know who can't get enough of hearing themselves talk.<br /><br />OUTDATED<br />He proffers that many people are mentally ill due to factors such as the inability to delay gratification, which is associated with discipline. Maybe if I'd have read further in the book, he would have clarified that many severely mentally ill people are not simply unable to delay gratification, but their basic functioning in life is impacted by severe trauma or genetic problems showing as complex PTSD or schizophrenia, for example. (My bad if so, I just could not carry on.)<br /><br />When I consider particular people I know who suffer from severe and persistent mental illness, I find his attitude annoying. I am glad this book has resounded with people over the years; however, over 25 years later there's still an abundance of ill and dysfunctional people --and, our economy depends/thrives upon instant gratification as the norm. So I can agree that some people who are not successful in life lack discipline, don't take responsibility, and are not \\"dedicated to the truth\\". Just my opinion, but his view of the world doesn't inspire me.

B009GQ57ES|5.0|This genre of music has never been &#34;my type&#34;, but after hearing the song &#34;My Oh My&#34; written for Dave Niehaus I decided to check out the other songs. Turns out I've loved every sing song! Each one is well written, and has some form of moral or story that is relatable. This album has a song for everyone, and I encourage those who do not listen to rap to give it a try.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This game was really fun but I'm not sure it was worth $5. By the time you get past the free parts there's not a lot left. Then again this could just be because I'm kind of a cheapskate:)

B008AK8FHM|2.0|The story could have been told in less pages with fewer references that helped was a doctor /scientist ....the point was made without it being  repeated at a frequency that seemed like every page.<br />I would not wildly recommend it for the above reason but do believe his point about NDE

B0095ZMMCK|3.0|Its a &#34;typical&#34; Tom Clancy.  Lots of background and filler, he obviously does excellent research, but far too long between any action activity.
0345525558|5.0|We got this book for a book club selection. I expect it tp be good.  I had good reviews, but to be honest I have not opened it yet,
B004I744AS|5.0|A quality app like this is as good as dictionary.com and is good for homework. I'd just like to say Thanks!
B00AU15HPC|3.0|I think Justin rushed this album to get it out. It does tend to get a bit boring on some parts. He really didn't bother to work on it more and it could have been made better. The musical interlude, 'Rising' is definitely lacking and wasting the track with 'silence' it just doesn't have that kick. With View From the Hill, he worked on it more and the end result was better. The bluegrass tracks I could easily do without as it doesn't suit him. As for the comments about it being his last CD or 'swan song' not a chance! It won't be his last there will be more to come because he signed with Eagle Rock.
B004ZN9YNC|5.0|I am a Pink Floyd collector so I had to add this to my collection. I always buy brand new and still sealed. I'd say the songs on here are awesome.
B00AHXIC50|4.0|Great album. I did not skip one song, Bruno Mars knows how to make good music, that catchy, and thoughtful.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book is very good.  The author made me care about the characters immediately.  It is a sweet love story.
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|This is a classic album in so many ways. The different songs and there messages. Bruno is a thoughtful songwriter. Great album I listened to without skipping a song.

B00005RDSM|1.0|When I wrote my first review it was on the shipping.  When I gave it to my grandson we found out it wasn't a legal dvd and it was made of something that wouldn't even play.  My grandson was so disappointed. I purchase two other dvds' fom different sellers and they were fine.  I should have realized from the cover it was real.  Really unhappy.
B009FZFONO|4.0|I was concerned the Zombie element would make it cheesy but it doesn't.  There are many plots and subplots and just when you think a character is a natural addition to the group...bam!

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is way fun and hard to put down. My 3 year old nephew loves this game and usually spends all his coins on carrots to give to the horse.
B00340ESIS|5.0|This book might not help you write an Academy Award winner, but it is full of specific examples on story plotting. Though written for a screen writer, I am using some of the concepts in writing a book. The author offers good explanations of breaking down a story into concrete parts, which helps create a detailed outline from which to write. Plus, his breezy writing style makes it interesting to read even if you're not a writer (helps if you like and are familiar with movies though).
B008QTVNUI|4.0|I always enjoy Doctor Who episodes.  The series is interesting as science fiction, and the special effects are always excellent.  Keep up the good work.
B0064BWDRW|4.0|Not one of the best novels by Jo Nesbo, but really worth reading, and he keeps one<br />excited, as we don't really know weather or not Harry Hole is dead.
1594744769|3.0|I bought this book for my daughter for Christmas and, after seeing the photos and the vague description, decided it might be too creepy for her.  I realized, a few pages in, that it was written squarely for her demographic and not the strangely packaged adult horror I had half hoped for.<br /><br />I had to finish it or it would nag me.  It is not a long read.  The photos here, at least, are a treat, and the way the book used them to drive the words, was an interesting idea and a good mixture of media.<br /><br />Probably if your 13-15 year old reads fantasy themes, mysteries and supernatural characters, this would be okay.  I would have enjoyed it more at that age.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|Just for &#34;lovesick&#34; teenage girls, at least not for a lady over 50  !!!<br />I would not recommend this book to anyone.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|Expensive but worth it.  Don't waste money on cheap stylus with rubber tips that fall apart.  My roommate loves hers too.
B000FA5SMK|2.0|my problem was that, for me, the story line was not credible.<br /><br />The writing was good.  The humour was there, mostly in the first half.<br /><br />But I just could not accept the basic premises of the story.  A true-blue-blood lawyer goes into an insane midlife crisis for no apparent reason.  A mafia don moves into the most waspish upscale neighborhood in the country.  Lawyer chucks away his life to serve the don.  Wife chucks her life to have an affair with the don.  I mean - really?
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I originally had the free version of this app and really liked it... but I wanted to be able to have this app running while I read, and that option only comes with the paid version. So, I bit the bullet and bought the paid version. I love it!! Not only can you have this app run while doing other apps, you can mix different sounds to create the perfect relaxing sound for you! You can also set a timer so you can fall asleep to whichever sound you like but not have to have the app run all night. This is perfect and better than I expected!! Well worth the money!
0425263916|5.0|I liked this one as well as the first and I can't wait for the last on to come out.  Great romance, with enough adventure to keep my interest.  What a great story teller, this is the first of her books that I have read and she will be on my list of authors in the future.

B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|Mark O'Brien was a normal healthy child until he was striken with polio at age 6 and doomed to a lifetime or relying on others for his basic needs and his life-saving iron lung. The story could end there but O'Brien's brilliant mind and joy of living overcame all obstacles. O'Brien is not exactly paralyzed, he explains. It's his muscles that don't work. He can't move his body below his nexk yet he becomes a writer. He has feeling throughout his body but can't touch a person or object. He has a wonderful mind trapped in a body that has abandoned him.<br /><br />THE SESSIONS delves into one aspect of O'Brien's incredible life and the movie takes us on an incredible journey of life, love and hope. At age 38, O'Brien, with much guilty and anxiety, decides to hire a sex surrogate just to finally experience sex and physical closeness. He later wrote an article about this experience which became the basis of this book.<br /><br />We can look at Mark O'Brien with pity or revulsion, as many people did, or we can see him as an inspiration and a joyous creation from God. O'Brien lived an exceptionally long life, despite his condition, and touched the hearts of many. His was a true story of overcoming or at least accepting the worst obstacles life could give anyone.<br /><br />John Hawkes gives tremendous heart and depth to his portrayal of O'Brien. Hawkes went beyond the norm and refused doubles or special effects and turned his own body into the twisted posture of a polio-stricken O'Brien. Helen Hunt was nominated for an Academy Award for her role as Cheryl Cohen-Greene, the real-life sex surrogate that changed O'Brien's life for ever. Hunt shows her remarkable acting talents as the surrogate baring not only her heart and soul for the role but her body in very tasteful but somewhat explicit nude and sex scenes. Both Hawkes and Hunt became their roles and the connection between the actors and the real-life characters is clear.<br /><br />Hawkes endearing speech pattern and smile and humor endears us the O'Brien he portrays. We just want to give Hawkes and O'Brien a loving hug and to relish his delightful humorous take on life and his tragic situation. O'Brien's moral dilema is strengthed by scenes with his parrish priest placed by William H. Macy. Macy's role is important as the Catholic priest helping O'Brien wrestle with his shame and embarassment along with his strong desire to experience sex for the first time. Macy's role could have been much more and somehow the priest seems one-dimensional as he listens to O'Brien's stories about the surrogate. Obviously, there is the connection between the two as far as not having sex, except the priest has made a decision to be celibate. O'Brien is trapped in a body that is not fully functional and any chance of a normal loving relationship with a woman seems impossible.<br /><br />THE SESSIONS will break your heart and inspire you at the same time. There is a sweet sadness to the story that is peppered with hopelessness yet the story is full of hope and joy. It is a remarkable story that the actors and writers brought to the big screen. This fine independent film will keep you thinking and wondering. The priest says God will give O'Brien a \\"pass\\" on breaking the rules against pre-martital sex because of O'Brien's predicament. The moral dilemma is heartbreaking since there is no one to blame or judge here.<br /><br />The writers treat the story with gentle humor. Hawkes's take on O'Brien is so lively and full of joy. There is an inspirational tone to the entire film that leaves the viewer curious about O'Brien's lifem along with a bittersweet sense of hope. It is a truly wonderful film.<br /><br />The extras on the film are rather limited and involve Helen Hunt and John Hawkes getting into their roles. There is an interview with the real Cheryl Cohen-Greene who talks very briefly about her career as a sexy surrogate. She never mentiones O'Brien and what relationship that had and how their sessions affected her emotionally. The movie leads us to believe they had a spiritual and emotional connection in their few sessions. Cohen-Greene certainly had an immense effect on O'Brien. A brief feature on the real Mark O'Brien would have been an added plus. We're led to believe he found love the last few years of his life, but did he? THE SESSIONS touches the viewer so deeply that we only want more information on Mark O'Brien and his life. The movie opens with scenes of O'Brien \\"driving\\" his bed around Berkeley but there is no mention if this is actual footage or not. Truly a remarkable film that leaves so many questions unanswered and has the viewer wanting more.

B00881VLCE|4.0|Good app for kids or adults who enjoy puzzles.  You can set it for 50, over 100, or over 200 pieces depending on your aptitude.  It's not terribly exciting but it's exactly what it is advertised to be.
B0025UHKNS|3.0|If I knew this watch had problems with the battery dying after 30 mins after you charge it fully, I probably would not have bought it. If you exceeded your 1 yr warranty, Garmin will send a refurbished one for $110. I dont think that is worth it. I also, did not like the sensitive bazel. It was hard to manuever through the menus.

B00BHMF578|1.0|My review is not with the movie but Amazon's service for the rental.<br />I purchased from my PC hoping to watch in HD with subtitles, but after purchase, it wont play the movie in HD, and it required to play from my PS3 to play in HD, of course that's not the end, they had to make you download app in PS3, setup account, codes here, pin codes there... I just want my movie in HD and subtitle!<br /><br />bottom lne, I cant watch it without the subtitle! please refund!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|We watched it the night we got it.  It was as if we were part of the whole show, we wanted to know if the family was feeling about the possibility of loosing Downton and how the servants  were starting to become more of a family themselves.  We have talked about a trip to England in a few years and we would like to go and see where Downton Abby was made.
B005LAIIPS|4.0|Looking forward to more from Jeremy Renner ! He had a tough act to follow, and did great, considering the increased science aspect shared with viewers, etc.  Liked Joan Allen's (actor) and Marta S. (character) as additional characters in this one, as well. Super job all around. Pam Lindy (Joan Allen) 's boss: Martin was a 'stand-out' well-done part played, also.

B0055MBQOM|5.0|I have always been a user of Datacolor's spyder line for screen hardware calibration, but this product is above and beyond better. With far more options to tweak to having the ability to even calibrate projectors, this is just the better product overall.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|Loved it. the entire series made me cry! It was wonderful, it's beyond me how the author managed to make me cry so much!The only other time I cried while reading a book was when Dumbledore died in the Harry Potter series. I DIDN'T cry at all when I read \\"The Fault in Our Stars\\".
B005L38QK2|4.0|I purchased this mouse for as you can imagine playing Diablo 3, on my laptop. Can't play an action rpg with a trackpad too efficiently. I was very pleased with the quality of the hardware but its biggest downfall in my opinion was the software end. The steelseries engine still needs some work on the OSX in order to not feel so bloated. It was responsible for some odd bugs with my system which ultimately made me remove it as just use it without. This unfortunately caused the nice Diablo 3 lights on the mouse to not work without the engine, but that's something I'm ok without as long as it didn't hinder my system.

0307592731|5.0|I am a hiker so I really enjoyed this book. Sheryl shares so many good stories and &#34;tells it like it is&#34; about life on the trail as a long distance hiker.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|This is a good movie, one that I watched on DVD. My kids are too old to watch Disney movies now, but I'm not. My wife watched it with me, and we were captivated by the story, the brave, bold young woman who makes a foolish choice, then pays for it, makes amends, and… well I won't ruin the story. It was well done, with a strong story line, good, believable characters, an adventure that will keep you watching, a struggle between good and evil, both internal and external.<br /><br />There are lots of sly jokes for the adults, which were truly funny. All the males in the film are treated like bumbling simpletons, which is a pernicious but officially sanctioned form of sexism today. I was willing to overlook it here, because the story was such a good one. The true story of the making of this film is a cautionary tale, because Brenda Chapman, the person who conceived this story based on her relationship with her daughter, started as the director of the film, but was shut out from the final product. Doesn't seem fair, but that is the way they do business in the movies. The final product is a good one, no matter how many bodies lie beneath the parking lot at the studio.

Michael Pollans book is wonderfully researched and written in a way that holds the readers grip even when the subject is not really inherently interesting.<br /><br />I would actually recommend you read all of Michael Pollan's books, except for &#34;Food Rules&#34; which after his other books seemed overly simplistic.<br /><br />Happy reading.

B00003CXDD|5.0|If you're teaching high schoolers about the journey of &#34;the unwilling hero&#34; in Joseph Campbell's mythic story structure, this PG film has it all.  &#34;Willow&#34; is a plucky little Nelwyn who has the task of rescuing a baby from the evil Queen Bavmorda.  The film is cleverly written and beautifully shot.  It is a mystery to me why it didn't do better at the box office.  Maybe we as an audience needed to learn to appreciate film fantasies and the messages they deliver.
B00005N6KG|1.0|When I received the product the ear buds were big and an awkward shape and uncomfortable when placed in your ear. My real problem was that one side of the earphones didn't work.

B004VYYA2K|5.0|This is a lightweight storage for Barbies and accessories.  The sides unzip to form the floor plan of a house and the lid becomes a pool.  It's not a monstrous, pink, Barbie Dream House; rather, it's a portable, much more practical item that allows a little girl to use her imagination.  We added a few pieces of furniture that fit inside the bin and the gift was a big hit.<br /><br />Shipping was fast and the product was exactly as advertised.
B00340LM8C|5.0|I love everything by Alfred Hitchcock! This is a marvelously suspenseful tale in a beautiful location! I never knew what to expect from one moment to the next, including Mr. Hitchcock's appearance on the back of the bus! The theme of empowered women is there in the housekeeper with her resistance background, the old woman florist who held onto Robie for destroying her stand until the police came, the girlfriend with her daring independence , her mother who wore jewelry for which she had no sentimental attachment, for her daughter and laughed at the Robie's casino &#34;joke&#34;, and in the cat (burgler) herself. Women are complex, they are bold drivers of cars and boats and they climb roofs to be jewel thieves! Grace Kelly is gorgeous as well as talented and Edith Head's magnificient wardrobe still inspires me. This film is a great and fun classic!
630469654X|5.0|When teaching Joseph Campbell's Journey of the Hero, I have used this PG film to illustrate mythic story structure.  While some parts of the Alan Parsons soundtrack are very dated, the orchestration soars.  The film's images are beautiful.  Much is shot in low light, and the video tape couldn't deliver the clarity the DVD can.

Then we watched season 2 which was really difficult to separate as a different story.... which it was.  Watch this first.  Then read...is always a good rule. Was happy to have it though.
B0095P29EG|4.0|Thor is definitely a visual dessert with great special effects and almost non-stop action. Great casting with an interesting story line.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent production with outstanding performances, beautiful staging, costumes and a knock-out cast.

B0045LSIRM|4.0|Very good CD that mirrored the actual concert. There were a couple of songs i was hoping we be on there - Rescue and When You Love Someone.
B007MC0IAG|3.0|Dawkin's book is more an explanation of the universe and everything in it due to science rather than any attempt to appreciate that not everything could possibly be because of science. A solid read if you believe that everything you're aware of is all because of atoms.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Lots of color values to choose from. Tints and intensities. Also has a very bright led flashlight. Great all the way around
B004LROUNG|2.0|If it didn't have Grisham's name on the cover, I would have stopped reading it after about 20 pages.  Superficial treatment of everything, but somehow I kept reading it, maybe because it's such a fast read, and hey, it's Grisham.  While the fundamental story is fine, it reads like an abridged novel.  For those of you who like abridged books and are thinking of moving into complete reads, this might be a good transition for you.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|i love it. i use it for school and at home for homework. the only part that i wish was different was... i wish we could do fractions on it.
B00005BKZJ|5.0|GERMANS can appear to be weird and queer at many times... especially when their native bavarian  behaviour takes over...<br />but they can also be caring and full of emotions.<br /><br />Watch the movie and be open to that fact... you'll love it.
B00B8ESWAM|1.0|That's right. I have just wasted 2 hours and 17 minutes enduring possibly the most boring, disjointed and incoherent \\"thing\\" that has ever passed itself off as a movie. Let me break the silence, Academy voters, this picture was completely pointless and an awful waste of resources...right down to the oxygen the editor was breathing as s/he struggled to figure out how to create a logical story sequence while wondering whether they could ever list this project on a resume and still be taken seriously. The biggest shame, however, was the amount of effort expended by the production designer, set decorators, artists and costume designers who beautifully recreated the 1940's settings. I would insist that the producers and director send them all an apology for abusing and shamelessly wasting their time. Then they'll need to do the same for me.....
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie was comedic, dramatic, and intense all at once. The fact that it paralelled a true story was great because it was a successful mission in real life and in the movie!
B006MPKE9O|5.0|Intriguing from the get go !<br />I could read it over and over.  Historical and completely keeps you turning the page !
B009RWRIKM|5.0|Excellent film, beautifully done.  It is highly recommended to anyone interested in Contemporary Dance, and in Pina Bausch. Very fine.
B00881VLCE|4.0|VERY SATISFIED WITH THIS APP. ONLY THING WAS WHEN I HAD TROUBLE WITH MY KINDLE AND NEEDED TO UPDATE IT, I LOST THE PUZZLES I HAD PAID FOR, THIS IS KIND OF UNFAIR, THIS IS A KINK THAT SHOULD BE WORKED ON.....
B007REV4T8|5.0|This movie was a lot of fun to watch.  The writing was great, and the story line was even better.  The people behind this movie weren't afraid to take risks and shake things up which added so much to this film. Javier Bardem is the best Bond villain in quite some time and Daniel Craig brings to this film his best performance ever as James Bond .  I loved Skyfall, and I know you will too.  So buy it, you won't be disappointed.
076115678X|5.0|Thank god I found it here. I lost someones hair book on the train but this showed up quickly and in perfect condition. They were none the wiser...
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|its easy. simple. not too many extras.  what you need it for and that's that. big screen to see.  awesome.e for being a free app!  no complications so far. no  complaining here . easy to use . big buttons helps a lot,  no squinting of the eyes or anything.  thank you for a great and simple yet very handy app.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|cant get enough of the game. My daughter and I play it all the time and laugh about how they cry and the pigs make the noises. Even with the free items in the game we get a good time playing. There is nothing else more to say but, angry birds rule.
B00AGKH6D8|1.0|Not like any Bonamassa I have heard. Disappointing I wish I could return it and get my money back. Live and learn.
B008B92U32|2.0|Installed on my Nexus 4 and have been trying to make it work. Does not work at all! You can select a picture and then nothing happens!
B00B0NDF26|4.0|Cruiseable tunes.<br />Not too poppy and not weird. Heard of them and their music, but never bought an album until now.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Less grittier than the first two Daniel Craig Bond movies, but still earns 4 stars for being a good movie.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|What a great love story. Very surprised at the end. I just couldn't put the book down. I can't wait to see the movie...
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Very good app and the best 2 dollars you can buy. Works great on the KF HD. Seriously handy application.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Thought this was a great book.  Easy reading with a good story line.  I have not seen the movie, because generally Nicholas Sparks books don't transfer well to movie form.  I think any one who loves love and excitement will love this book.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The best series I have have ever had the pleasure of viewing! A pleasure to watch, phenomenal writing, great cast!
B0063IH60K|5.0|challenging; keeps your mind moving; never a repeat game; great for all age groups;  easy to learn and use on any device
B0017SWPXY|5.0|My daughter and her friend do this type of racing.  A friend recommended the book to me as a dog lover.  What a great blend of both of my major interests !
B00AHXIC50|4.0|Bought it for &#34;Locked Out Of Heaven&#34; but was suprised that I liked all the tracks on this Bruno Mars CD.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Awesome game recommend to those that like strategy fun fir all. Come play with us. You will have endless hours of enjoyment .
B008JF8O9M|2.0|This may be great for someone, but I couldn't get it to work with my kindle fire. I may try again however. Maybe it was just me.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Everything about this show is great.  Storyline, set, costumes,  I am saddened to see certain people die off but other than that, great show.  Keep it coming.
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|I can't find anything to knock on this app.  It keeps me up to date on the market.  Recommend it.
B008J34466|5.0|Yes that was corny! But, this is a great CD! I have trouble deciding what track is my favorite!  Her collaborations are greatness and her songs are just rock out fun.  The one soft song almost drives me to tears every time I hear it.  This is one CD I would love to see her perform, because I could see her just having fun performing it.  This is definitely a good buy!!
B0034G4OXQ|5.0|I'm a big Matt Damon fan (who isn't?) and he shines in this with such an understated but strong portrayal of a reluctant psychic who can see into the &#34;hereafter&#34; and receive messages for people.  The lovely French actress, Cecile de France is excellent, too.  Well, actually all the acting was very good.  The scenes of the Indonesian Tsunami are amazing.  You feel as if you are there.  I watch this movie, over and over, and every time I see it I see something new and it leaves me with such positive feelings.  Very well done, Mr. Eastwood.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I got only a short way into the story and stopped reading it. I thought it was poorly and silly written.<br />But the hype over this series is so high and few of my friends here on goodreads gave it really high praise and 5 stars so i thought maybe i should give it an other try..they say it is like twilight just without the vampire stuff,and i am a twilight fan so...<br />Here it goes..first scene,second time...<br />...................................<br /><br />After reading to 20% of the book  :<br /><br />I am now definitely sure this book is not for me.I mean common..she i so happy because he wants him to make her his slave?? I am a Twilight fun but who said this is like twilight,probably didn't even read the books! Awful writing style ,shallow conversations,totally unbelievable characters..i am sorry Fifty Shades of Grey fans but this is so not working for me.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I loved to follow the same families and their destiny. What will happen to them in volume three??<br />Hope it will be available on kindle soon
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|If you like Rothfuss or Sandersen you should know that Anthony Ryan has similar qualities and talents and therefor i highly recommend it to all of you!<br /><br />Blood Song, certainly has it all: great coming of age tale, compelling character, and a fast-paced plot.You can find here all of the action, tragedy, love, and depth you want in a great fantasy novel.<br />It is a story of the main character growing and becoming a man of legend, it doesn't have the feeling of a repeating story told many times in the genre where a young boy with good heart becomes most powerful hero inn the realm and wins over all evil. The story was very mature and dealt with subject matter that makes the reader think. There are many well built, complex characters and the world building is fantastic.<br /><br />This is definitely my first favorite book of year 2013!
B005EIS5IW|5.0|Love this humor! As the eccentric cat lady (I only have 5, so I'm not crazy yet) I loved this ebook. It is too funny and a cat lover and relate!
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|Having read the book prior to seeing this movie I have concluded that while people may view this Adventure as a &#34;Extremely hard movie to follow&#34; and may come out of it confused and rather dazed, you first have to look at how this movie was conceived.<br /><br />This is an adaptation of a VERY well written book that is a piece of art. It tells the tales of 6 very different and similar stories throughout time and weaves them together into this spectacular web of Bliss where you cant help yourself but get lost in each of their lives like it was your own and feel what they feel as this masterpiece continues.<br /><br />The Book itself is the Crown Jewel, and those who have read it prior to the movie understand why, the way it is written is so daring and unique to anything in print today. The author uses many different styles and really defines each story to the fullest.<br /><br />Now the movie does a fantastic job adapting the book to the big screen but as we all know it cannot do every single line and page of the book, or the movie would be 5 hours long (Which I would sit through Gladly).<br /><br />It is a very intricate task to follow each story and look for the connection lying deep within the next but that is what this movie is all about, challenging the mind and imagination to move beyond the obvious and to look for the hidden gem beneath.<br /><br />I invite you to buy this MASTERPIECE and watch it more than once, I have seen this movie three times in theaters and each time was better than than the last.<br /><br />Last the Actors do a tremendous job, they are forced to be at most 6 different people with all unique mannerisms and the way they make it work is just amazing. I found myself not realizing that it was them playing some of these roles until the very end when they rattle off credits, it was an absolute treat to be apart of the this book and movie !!<br /><br />Cloud Atlas is a ONCE IN A LIFETIME MOVIE and should not be missed for the world !
B009U9S6FI|5.0|in some ways, hard to read, in other ways very inspirational.  His ability to persevere in such circumstances is remarkable.
B001J1O83E|3.0|I ordered the DVD  I did not realize  Region (2)  Would Not  operate  on US  DVD Players  I ended up sending it  back for I could not play  it in US  Player  I think  when a DVD  Says a Region next to it  that  it should be labeled what that Region  means  to be able to play or operste in  what DVD  Players  The  DVD  Might of been fine  if I could of played it to see if it was.  I wish I was WARNED  Of the Region  and what it means before I purchased it  That Region  1 thru  6 Is all new to me  but I learned by asking questions  Amazon Customer  Service was nice enough to explain  . I only wish I was aware  of that before I puchased  it  Thank you.
B00933JL0A|5.0|Best ever I am going to buy the full version you should to<br />O and its endless so the full version is only a few more buildings
B009E3EY4M|5.0|Better than imagined.  If you're a Led Zep fan - buy it.  Very good video and audio quality.  A historic event.
B00000JXVK|5.0|is on any sunday the greatest movie of all time? when I was growing up I thought so! well I think it still is. If you havent seen it you must!
B009FZFONO|5.0|I was so much in love with the TV Show \\"Lost\\" few years ago and I finished it in a marathon session on Netflix. I watched The Walking Dead first two seasons on Netflix and I couldn't wait them to be available on Netflix, so purchased this and like it so far. I wish the whole season becomes available at once. Waiting for a week between episodes kills the joy and the shows get a little lost in memory.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Awesome second book. I love how it fills in so many gaps and you enjoy the love story. I can read this book over and over. My favorite book out of all three books.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|From start to finish this book is riveting. A page turner but one with a delightful imaginative setting that never fails to surprise and intrigue.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|The characters were interesting and provided an easy escape for the reader. I thoroughly enjoyed it! I would recommend this to anyone who liked romance books.
B0043XX7VE|5.0|Cute movie. Get it. I didn't even realize it was Steve Carrell as the main character. Now I know why I love it so much.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It is good but the price needs to go down but it is AWESOME!!!! I like creative and I like that you can join games I love to mess you my sister's would.
B00936A0RU|5.0|Loved the movie so much I bought it twice - one for me to keep at home, one to lend to my friends so we can talk about it!
B0047GNCSU|4.0|Let's be clear right now, I'm a huge fan of The Hills and Lauren Conrad so that may impair my judgement just a tad bit, but I'm trying my best to be completely impartial and give an honest review of the book.<br /><br />For the first half I really didn't know how I felt about L.A. Candy. By the end I was completely hooked and almost skipped everything else I had scheduled to read the sequel.  This was an addicting read that I flew through in just a few hours.<br /><br />The main character, Jane, is very likeable. You want everything to work out for her. Yet somethings that happen to her are very undeserved and I totally felt for her. And of course there are spoiled mean girls at play who deserve a good kick.<br /><br />Yes, the writing is a bit more simplistic than a lot of other books out there, but honestly, it's realistic of the demographic that is portrayed in the novel. This is definitely a YA \\"chicklit\\" and perfect for a reader looking for something very light. Maybe as a refresher after a heavier read? Beach reading material for sure. Lots of drama, fashion, and parties; a very girly novel.<br />Anyway, this is a must-read for fans of Lauren Conrad, MTV, or reality TV in general. I don't know how much of it is actually true, but it could provide a lot of insight of what goes in behind-the-scenes of so-called \\"reality\\" shows.<br /><br />Oh, and heads up for anyway planning to read L.A. Candy, we're left with a total cliffhanger, guaranteeing you'll want to read the next installment.<br /><br />[...]
B006LSZECO|4.0|this book was so unpredictable! i thought i had the story figured out at least 3 times and then i kept getting rocked by the twists in the story! GREAT!!!
0802798225|4.0|I really enjoyed this one. I held off reading it for the longest time thinking that it probably wasn't my type of thing, but it was.<br /><br />The use of short, dual-perspective chapters made it a very quick read that consistently held my attention. I loved reading about both Brittany's and Alex's back stories. They come from very different backgrounds but when they come together they find they aren't so different after all. They both find themselves trying to portray a certain image to the world; images that don't exactly match who they really are. Together though, they don't have to hide or pretend.<br /><br />This was a very sweet, but roller coaster of a story and I was rooting for them the whole time. I'll definitely find time to read the next two in the series. Sorry for such a short review, but some time has passed since finishing this one. Just one to put it out there that it is an enjoyable story and perfect for those readers who enjoy a good contemporary love story.<br /><br />More reviews at [...]
B00992CF6W|3.0|It's a really fun game in all, but it would be nice to play with my friends. I have this game on my kindle and if i start a game with my friends (who have it on thier iPods) they can't find my game. I can join them just fine but it would be nice if they could join in a game where I know the territory. Other then that a fun game, (besides the spiders!!!!!)
B0096C7QF0|5.0|Love the live recordings.  Technically perfect CD, a very good live mix.  A good CD for any Bonamassa fan and he's a guitar players player.
B000FC2L1E|4.0|Diana Gabaldon continues to most excellent tale with twists, turns and surprises that make this series one of the gems of fictional series. Time travel, 18th century warfare, science regarded as witchcraft (and possibly vice versa) surrounded by a committed, complicated love affair would each be a theme, but this series combines them all.<br /><br />Thanks, Diana!
B000KBCHRS|5.0|A true adaptation of Jane Eyre. Enjoyed it very much. Timothy Dalton was the perfect Mr. Rochester. I would recommend this to any Jane Austin fan.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Joseph Gordon Levitt was disconcerting with his makeup and prosthetics but I liked him in this movie.  The story line drags a bit and I had a hard time caring about anyone but Joseph.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|THis does a great job portraying the events of the novel. All the characters come back with a swing in this second season. The new characters add another element to this fantastic series
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Believable acting, very interesting story.  I loved Adam Arkin, Ben Affleck and John Goodman!  Not action packed but an interesting two hours.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks strikes again. This novel is a different take from his other ones and the writing is spot on as usual. The characters all all really complex and the plot twist left me in awe even after I was done reading
B003VANOFY|5.0|I purchased this headset for work thinking it would be a good way to cancel out some noise from the surrounding cubicles. I now want to take it home and bring my SoundBlaster headset to work instead. This thing is amazing! The G keys are beautiful! The sound is stunning...especially on 7.1! Also...as a former DJ...the fact that I have an advanced equalizer is a seller. Every option from 32 to 16K is available, plus Bass and Treble. I love the volume scroll rather than mashing a button several times to get my volume to go down. The wireless feature lets me get up and go grab a coffee without ending my call with a client. I dropped it right after I opened the box...smart me...but it seems to have done no damage. Logitech...you've done it again for me! Every single time I go to buy \\"high end\\" peripherals like Razer or SteelSeries, they always let me down. Logitech has yet to disappoint me.<br /><br />Great for gamers! Great for the office! Great for anything to do with a computer to be honest! A recommended buy...and at the price, a steal!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I really loved this book. I'm half way done with clash of kings and I can't recommend this series any more highly! The show is great too! I. Glad I read the book first
B00007LTIL|5.0|All that I have to say is if you like the Dead, you will like this disc. Gotta love the Dead!
