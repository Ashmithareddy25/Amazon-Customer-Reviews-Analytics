B00BBQXQFI|5.0|I love this movie the story is beautiful, it's a most see. This movie is for all ages, pure details.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Love the series and really enjoy having friends over to view.  Can't wait for season 3.  UK version is wonderful.
B008WOULPK|4.0|If you love sophisticated fashion and have been a dedicated Vogue fan like me you will enjoy this book.  Grace Coddington lived the life many of us dreamed of from 1960's through all those beautiful eras since.
B00B80ZG6O|5.0|Melchior, Windgassen, Vickers, and now Kaufmann, rich and darkly hued glorious tone, artistic subtlety and stunning onstage presence. Great Wagner singers are a rare breed. Gorgeous singing combined with great acting on the opera stage are even rarer.  Jonas is truly the full package, we are fortunate to live in these times, and thanks to the Met HD we can all see his magnificent performances. I'm still glowing from the amazing Parsifal last week (a really moving and smart production as well). And I will always remember his definitive interpretation of Siegmund last year (despite the awful production). I think we're in for many great treats from Jonas in the next decade. This recording is a glimpse into some of those treats to come, (Siegfried?? maybe Tristan??). The Wesendonk lieder are amazing, They sound great in his tenor, the most beautiful interpretation of those since Flagstad.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|great movie! my sister in 10th grade told me about this movie her teacher showed in one of her classes and thus the reason i bought! i think anyone and everyone should watch this movie and educate yourselves on what your eating and where your food comes because if not you'll pay for it later on with your health
B00873GRU4|5.0|With both wonderful imagination plus insight into the human psyche, this book kept me gripped from start to finish. One of the best science fantasy/fiction I've read in my 60+ years of being an avid fan of this genre of writing. I am going straight to down load the rest of this brilliant trilogy as soon as I'm done here!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love it it is a very fun game. Very addicting play everyday. Mad props yto all the designers graphics r nice
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Don't want to give away anything from the book for those who haven't read the series, however, it is a read you cannot put down. Be sure to read \\"Fifty Shades of Gray\\" the first book in the trilogy, before buying \\"Fifty Shades of Darker\\" Book two.  It is amazing the effect Anastatia has on Christian.  Christian is the Fifty Shades of Gray.  I would have named book two, Fifty Shades of lighter gray - read it for yourself to discover why.  Looking forward to book 3 and I have increased my four star rating for the author herself, to five stars..., she is an excellent writer in all aspects.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|Excellent sound and picture quality. Nice remake, but not necessary. The original movies were very good, so this did not really add much, but still nice to watch.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I loved the story, even though it was difficult and painful to re-live such an ugly part of American history.  If you enjoy historical fiction, you will love the book.
B001BANK32|5.0|I read this novel years ago.  I just felt the urge to return to the adventures of Danny and the shining horror. This book certainly keeps you on the edge of your seat and you might even throw the book into the air if someone walks up to you while reading.  It has happened to me with many of Stephen King's novels.  :)
B001QOGYFO|4.0|It was recommended by Netflix as a \\"horror\\" movie but it isn't although there are some uneasy scenes.  All in all, it's simply a murder mystery set at the South Pole with the investigating marshal working against time as a white-out sets in, keeping everyone inside for six months unless they evacuate.  An unnerving scene of a patient having fingers amputated while still conscious though the hand has no feeling, a good fight scene with two men tethered to a rope while 100 MPH winds batter them and the temp is minus 65.  Alex O'Loughlin in a very un-McGarrett role as an Australian. An entertaining crime thriller set in an unusual location.
B008LSVL6U|5.0|I have watched through this blu-ray at least 4 times since I got it recently.  It is easily at the top of my list for production quality.  Crank up a song like postcard and you will be amazed at the beauty.  If you like progressive rock, I highly recommend this blu-ray.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|If you want straight answers then this is the book to read. It takes you through the publishing process step-by-step. And it's free and downloadable. If you would rather battle with the Amazon support team that insists in repeating what you say in an email and then provides grammatically incorrect, unstructured instructions, which needlessly raise more questions, then feel free not to refer to this book.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|amazing show and if youre not watching it, you better start, it will be life changing, and you wont regret it
1400052181|5.0|My wife bought this book and raved about it. I picked it up and could not put it down. A fascinating book based in my adopted home of Baltimore, in a hospital where Henrietta &#34;shared herself&#34; quite likely we have walked the same halls. I visited the locations and can tell you they are accurately depicted in the book.<br /><br />This would be a terrific movie - are you listening Oprah!<br /><br />I have the entire set of characters already cast, down to the neighbors in Turner Station.<br /><br />Read it... I double dog dare you! You won't be sorry! You will be entertained and educated.
B0081336FO|5.0|I was so loving the second season! The first season was amazing and I didn't think it could get better but it did! I so recommend this. I enjoyed it! I hope you do too!
B0000024SI|5.0|Wow!@ it's like every damn song is a classic! Peak period 'electric dylan'. frankly, i enjoy this period more than his previous 'folkie' period.<br /><br />1. \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\"  6:13 -one of Dylan's best known songs. covered also by the Stones and Hendrix.<br />2. \\"Tombstone Blues\\"  5:58 -love this high octane Dylan jewel<br />3. \\"It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry\\"  4:09 -another classic in the Dylan cannon<br />4. \\"From a Buick 6\\"  3:19<br />5. \\"Ballad of a Thin Man\\"  5:58 -aka 'Mister Jones'. rumored to have been written about late Rolling Stone, Brian Jones, who'd recently met with Dylan.<br />Side two<br /><br />6. \\"Queen Jane Approximately\\"  5:31 -another of Dylan's best loved tunes. I also love the version on the Dylan/Grateful Dead collaboration, Dylan & The Dead<br />7. \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\"  3:30 -What's that whistle sound in da song? lol, love this tune.<br />8. \\"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues\\"  5:31 -Beastie Boys sampled \\"I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough\\" on their tune Finger Lickin Good. Great tune and lyric<br />9. \\"Desolation Row\\" -What a sad state of affairs. Dylan's lyrics place you right there. U almost feel like you in the scene painted by his lyric. The Dead also played this Dylan chestnut in their live reportoire. the original is a classic.
B00633W614|5.0|I love Jeffrey Archer and really like this series of books. Looking forward to reading the next installment. Great seller, and great series of books.
6304712936|5.0|Wow, what a great performance by F Murray Abraham as Mozart's rival Salieri. What a quantum leap from playing Omar, the drug dealer in the movie Scarface! This movie also piqued my interest in the music and life of it's subject Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Highly recommended!
B00846F1YW|4.0|I like this game.  The objects are not too hard or too easy to find.  I like the other puzzles too.  It was kind of confusing at first.  You couldn't see one of the objects unless you pinched the screen.  Once I figured that out it was great!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My 5 year old &amp; myself love this game. It's so much fun. Don't know how to get more gems yet......... great game for a horse lover!
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I loved it, don't watch while you eat but it really gives lots of information I did not know about our food system here in teh USA....we are making ourselves sick and its disgusting, opened my eyes
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this game is great just like having your own horse! However I do think when you are  earning Jems by doing surveys it's ridiculous as your jems never come through
B008Y6QZ56|4.0|I liked the movie every minute up to the ending where it just cut off and we all have no idea what happened. Only reasons its not getting 5 stars.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My husband and I love this show. I rarely write reviews but had to take the time to give this series an A+. Wonderful character development and intriguing story line with plenty of accompanying twists and turns!
B003V1WXKU|5.0|I knew nothing about Feynman the colorful character when I first leaved the first (digital) page of this delightful book. I closed it being enriched by this Physics professor's tale of his escapades not only in the scientific realm, but even in those realms far away: art, music, education, travel, dating, gambling, nude dancing, and safe cracking.<br /><br />The common threads of late Dr. Feynman's autobiography is his social fearlessness, his hyperactive mind, his uncanny persistence and diligence, and for the most part, his humility. Each of these traits existing on its own in one individual would have already yielded a wonderful persona worthy of knowing, all taken together compound my regret of not knowing him sooner, and resulted in a renewed vigor to develop similar characteristics in my own life journey to a desiredly full, accomplished life.
B009AMANBA|1.0|ITS TOO BAD SOMEONE DIDNT SHOOT LINCOLN SHORTLY AFTER HE WAS ELECTED AND THIS COUNTRY COULD HAVE BEEN SPARED FROM THE MASSACRE THAT WAS TO ENSUE. BLOODY TYRANT.
6304712944|5.0|This special edition is a joy to watch, including the special features. So glad I had the chance to add it to my video library!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|easy to use and a great android app. I love it. An app that is with me on my kindle fire.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I have listened to and watched this over and over again! It is an amazing production! The added pleasure of the ending is truly special! Looking forward to enjoying this for a long while.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I liked the book.<br />A lot.<br />You should read it sometime.<br />When you're not busy with life.<br />Have a great day.
B0027MJU00|5.0|My third book by Gillian Flynn. Never a disappointment. The characters, as always, come to life.  Really enjoyed this one.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved this series;) I was so upset every time I had to place the kindle down. It is well worth the read trust me.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this game and all the interaction with the horse.  The competitions are a great way to increase your skills. Sending and getting gifts from friends always makes my day.
0307278255|4.0|After reading The Namesake and Interpreter of Maladies, this collection of short stories seems to me an old hat for Lahiri.  For that reason, a star has been deducted.  Her shoes are too small and I can feel the struggle for new material in her writing.  However, that is no reason to deduct more than that.  In fact, if I could do half stars here, I would.  Four and a half would be my rationale. For, and it's become a fact, Lahiri is an exceptional writer who draws you in with a few short sentences and spits you out a couple dozen pages later quivering for the human condition and wanting more.<br /><br />As with all of her work, Lahiri focuses on the culture tears between Indian immigrants and the rest of the world.  Most of the time, she focuses on the characters of the children that have grown up in the other countries.  More often than not, she turns to the condition of love and marriage to exemplify the conditions these individuals have to face when making life decisions on a grand scale that is so against their original Indian culture and tradition.<br /><br />Several short stories serve as a precursor to a three part short story at the end of the book focusing on two Indian-American children living their lives on the outskirts of each other.  The entire book can stand as a whole describing the &#34;unaccustomed earth&#34; the parental immigrants and then their children face.  One story even goes so far as to demand a garden of growth in the backyard of a northwestern American home.<br /><br />Each story is captivating and sheds as much light as possible onto not only the Indian tradition forced into an (oftentimes) American box, but also helps the sociologist and anthropologist in us to view similar cultural clashes within other ethnic backgrounds.
B00908DDZM|5.0|It was what I expected and was happy to purchase to support an unsigned artist.  I hate the RIAA and hope they run out of money.
B008CRC506|4.0|I really am happy to have season one of Smash. But warning to moms with younger children.  Much of the content is not family friendly. Very sexually suggestive at times, homosexuality is a topic, alcohol and drugs are both a part of it as well. I don't share this with my younger kids. More for an adult audience.  But great stuff!
B0033AI4PM|5.0|I loved the music and the story and I would recomend this movie to any one.  This one of the movies I like to watch on a snowy day.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The action and humor in this book are so evened out. This book is by far a good tie passer.
0545265355|5.0|Wife has read the first book and is well on her way to finishing the 2nd one.  It takes a pretty good book to get my wife interested.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Very surprising! Changed point of view once or twice, easy to read and makes you keep reading it until its over
B002BWP49M|5.0|Wife is a huge Twilight fan.  This can only be personal preference.  I watched the movie and it was ok, but would not watch again.
1616550414|5.0|This is a very complete book. If you are a fan of the Zelda games, you will not be disappointed. It contains lots of previously unreleased artwork from early stages of development of the games, plus a lot of very interesting facts, like notes on characters, ideas and changes from the developers and designers themselves. I just loved seeing how many of the characters in the games came to be, and the way the might have been!<br /><br />The book itself is huge, made with quality materials that give it a beautiful and elegant look. I would recommend buying it before reading all the spoilers on the internet!
B008HT4FUW|5.0|It is an excellent series and I had missed the first two.  Love the extras put on the CDs showing the actors, comments and other interesting facts.
B008VBYN80|1.0|Disappointed, success in gaming should have more to do with strategy, and less to do with what your mom's limit is on her credit card. Wish Amazon could cut a deal with Google play so we could have access to legitimate games, and not these bait & scam traps. Other than that it's great!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Another classic from Mitch Albom! Loved the way we are reminded to appreciate what we have and enjoy each precious moment we are given. Highly recommend this book!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I bought this for a coworker when he had to put his dog down. I thought I'd read it first. Ended up buying it for my tablet so I could keep a copy. It was just what he needed, me too.
B0083Z614S|4.0|Great book. I am loving it, reading this version on a kindle. The story has something to offer many different readers.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|A good yarn, with a strong mastery of language and an intriguing world. The only thing that really bothered me was how little I still know even at the end of the 2nd day and I really hope the 3rd day wraps everything up well.
0449011917|5.0|I listen to the book while commuting.  The actor/reader does his best to make each voice a little different, but this is the 3rd book in the series I've listened to and I think he's getting tired of changing his voice because he uses the same accent and tone for most of the characters and changes the accents and voices of the main characters.  That said, the story moves on ..
B0015YIGJC|5.0|This CD is good and it was in great condition (used). The show was a great with good sound quality and the songs came out perfect.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Especially since S Gr8t has led to an early renewal for S9!  :)  Supernatural is the best show on television.  J2 are the best actors in TV right now.  My only plea:  BRING BACK BOBBY SINGER!!!!!!
B003ZJ0ZX0|2.0|All but the first song was scratched. I purchased this item and had it sent to my daughter in Texas. I was sad to find out that she could only listen to the first song without interruption.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I fall asleep to this movie every single night.  If I am stressed, I put this movie in and feel my stress melt away.  This is THE version of Pride and Prejudice to see!
B00581BQG8|5.0|Really no complaints, a good laugh if you're into immature comedy.  If you're a prude you might skip it for something more refined.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Sound and picture quality great! Awesome menu and special features! Bluray holds your place in season for next viewing- sweet!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game! I play with my grandson Anthony all the time. I collect coins for him. And when he comes over he lobes to spend them! Highly addictive with fast paced action!
0061692034|5.0|Loved his writing style......kinda slow, but lovely.  I felt I could picture the characters and scenery perfectly.  Thanks for writing such a great book!
B002GYI9C4|2.0|I don't get the hub-bub about Brandon Sanderson. I disliked Elantris and Mistborn is just as bad. I know he's finishing the Wheel of Time series, but that's no reason to canonize this guy as a great fantasy writer. His writing is as predictable as Goodkind. If you want higher-quality fantasy written by better authors, try Tad Williams, David B. Coe, Scott Lynch, or Patrick Rothfuss.  This is about as pedestrian and formulaic as it gets unfortunately.  I won't be wasting my time with the other 2 books in the series.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|This is my all time favorite new show, and I love the new music they churn out every week.  They will have to have a Nashville 2 album soon!!
B002VHI8FE|5.0|This review is for the entire First Law trilogy.  While George RR Martin has been slumping with the last two books of the Song of Ice and Fire series and playing footsie with HBO, Joe Abercrombie is writing fantasy the way it should be written.  Unapologetic, edgy, filled with intrigue and amazing battle scenes.  I can't express just how good these books were, you'll just have to read them for yourselves.  Frankly, i'm jealous that you are going to get to experience them for the first time.  Joe Abercrombie has quickly vaulted to my #1 author position.  I look forward to reading his stand-alone novels Best Served Cold, The Heroes, and Red Country.  If they are even half as good as this series, I will be a very happy reader.  Buy these books without hesitation.  Nobody is writing better right now than Joe Abercrombie.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|So many of my friends love this cd I will have all I can do to hold onto it myself lol,
B002KYHZLQ|2.0|First off, let me say that I know I'm in the minority when it comes to not liking this book. This series has received so many accolades and I was as surprised as anyone that I was a little underwhelmed upon completing this the first book of the Malazan Book of the Fallen cycle. I have two major problems with the book. The first (and this is a huge pet peeve) is the enormous cast of characters. It got to the point where I had to keep flipping back to the front of the book every 4 or 5 pages to see who was speaking and why they were important. The second is that it was so incredibly difficult to follow what was going on at any given point in the story. I hate books that feel like research papers. I'm by no means a dumb person and I like an involved plot as much as the next guy, but this was to the point of excess and distraction. Sorry Mr. Erikson, I just don't want to have to work that hard to fully enjoy a book. I will not be continuing on with this series.(less)

B0001GF2DS|4.0|THE GOOD THE BAD THE UGLY is an absolute masterpiece and one of the best, if not the best, film in the Spaghetti Western genre. The film helped cement Clint Eastwood's remarkable career and breathed life into actor Lee Van Cleef's failing star. Add in the always great Eli Wallach and you have one mighty cast.<br /><br />Spaghetti Westerns can sometimes seem comic in nature and conception. The recipe is simple. Take an Italian director and crew, add in Spain to substitute for the American Old West. Throw in a mostly Italian and Spanish cast. Then, to spice it all up hire an up and coming American actor or a well-known actor on the slide downward to be your low-cost main stars and you have a spaghetti western. The Italian directors and crew took their westerns very seriously and tried to recreate classic American westerns but with their special Italian touch. Sergio Leone was the king of the Spaghetti Westerns, which were wildly popular in Europe at the time, and for the most part only Leone's westerns made it to the American screen.<br /><br />One could fill pages writing about THE GOOD THE BAD THE UGLY--the quirks, the masterwork of artistic talent, the cast, the crew, the location, the story and so on. This film stands above the others for so many reason. Ennio Morricone's jarring and haunting score is unlike anything before since. Hear the theme to THE GOOD THE BAD THE UGLY and it will stay with you a lifetime. It never leaves you.<br /><br />Leone set out to create his vision of a western and tried to recreate an authentic setting in the Spanish desert. Leone is very visual in his films. He lingers on long shots and extreme, very extreme close-ups of his actors. The extreme close-ups of Eastwood's, Van Cleef's and Wallach's eyes create a sense of forboding unlike no others. In a scene where the three are about to have a shootout--the camera focuses on their eyes and the their nervous fingers on their guns and back to the eyes and then a return to the hands. The camera lingers and makes a scene even longer.<br /><br />Speaking of lingering, the Italian premiere version went on for 177 minutes. United Artists had Leone trim 25 minutes for the American version. The DVD version I watched had scenes re-inserted but nowhere does it say the length of the film and that leads to a big Leone problem. THE GOOD THE BAD THE UGLY drags on and on. The three stars are always trying to outwit and out fight each other. Each is on the search for money buried in a cemetery. Their paths cross and separate and cross again and then there are the union and confederate soldiers doing battle. Leone throws everything into one story and much of it is unnecessary in a tale of three men and their greedy quest.<br /><br />Van Cleef as \\"Angel Eyes\\" is \\"The Bad\\" in the story. He's a man of pure evil. Eli Wallach throws a more comic tinge to his portayal of Mexican bandito Tuco \\"The Ugly.\\" Here is a Mexican bandito as in THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. He has his role down perfectly. Finally, Clint Easwtood is simply known as \\"Blondie.\\" He THE GOOD in the story but he really is not that much better than the other two--less cutthroat but still devious and prone to violence yet he is also portrayed with occasional heart as he comforts a dying confederate soldier.<br /><br />Leone's film is sprawling. If Blondie rolls down a hill, we see him roll down the entire hill. If a dog is walking across a street, we see the entire walk in long shot. It appears Leone did not like to edit anything out and could have told his story in half the time.<br /><br />It should also be noted that Leone is fascinated by faces. Eastwood is the only \\"pretty\\" star in the cast, although Van Cleef has some allure. The rest of the cast is full less conventionally attractive faces and some rather odd and quirky faces. It is all about the faces and especially the eyes for Leone.<br /><br />In this cast of faces, there are actors speaking English, Italian, Spanish and no doubt other languages. THEGOOD THE BAD THE UGLY is an odd film to watch closely since it's clear that most of the voices are dubbed. Yes, Wallach and Eastwood are speaking in their own voices but even Van Cleef seemed to be dubbed (and from the bonus features, they do say his voice was dubbed in scenes that were re-inserted). That brings us to the pure gem of the movie. The American actors spoke their lines in English to actors who might be speaking their dialogue in Italian. Depending on the market, certain voices were dubbed. The American voices were dubbed for the Italian market. The American voices stayed for the English language market. It really is amazing to imagine this Tower of Babel production.<br /><br />THE GOOD THE BAD THE UGLY is a masterpiece. There will never be another movie like it nor another director like Sergio Leone or a magical score from the likes of Ennio Morricone. It is a one in a million film. It is a literal epic in length and in production. It is not to be missed.
B008EKON56|5.0|This adapter works great in my mazda cx7 Car. You can totally notice the difference between using just an aux cable. Would buy again and of course i recommend it. Professional packaging, fast delivery, no issues with the product at all.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|This is a unique story told in a fascinating manner.  The filming is beyond outstanding and keeps you glued to the screen.  This is a visual masterwork
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|Simply brilliant!  Very funny dialog, voices and the animation was stunning. Someone should have shown this to GW Bush after 9/11!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Love the first season of this show!  Definitely worth the buy.  Seasons 2 and 3 aren't really worth watching in my opinion, if you love season one, go pick up the graphic novel and continue the story there.
B000T46O52|5.0|describes his journey toward death hooked to an IV as opera plays and Denzel Washington looks at this and changes his perspective that love is love whatever flavor.<br />The bookend music<br /> beginning with Streets of Philadelphia (rough life, childhood)<br />Ending Neil Young Philadelphia (We were just boys and girls . . .)<br />Well, done, heartbreaking. Woodward, Banderas background--perfectly placed.
B005LAJ22Q|3.0|The story really goes downhill in this season.  I understand that AMC had to make some key decisions to move away from certain aspects of the graphic novel's story to appeal to a larger television audience, I just feel like those decisions were very poorly made.  I'm not opposed to them changing the story, but they definitely picked the wrong things to change.  Overall this season starts to slip and turn into a very boring and tame show compared to the first season.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|Today's bluetooth headsets are too expensive to just let fly around your vehicle. This case is a must have. The headset fits well and snug. The case protects it from damage and makes it easier to carry. Well worth it for the money.
B000CNFC76|5.0|How do you rate a story such as this, that goes directly to your heart.  One that you will recall for years to come and share with your children and grandchildren.  Thank you for the opportunity to witness such a great story.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Overall the movie was cute and sassy. Tommy Lee Jones, who is one of my favorites, does a masterful job of portraying this faithful husband with his underlying anger. I liked meryl Streep but  found her performance a bit too pollyana-ish.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is a very informative book.  I enjoyed it up until the kill.  I thought it dropped off after that.

B008Y6TD5A|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Russell Crowe played the lead character well. This action/mystery/suspense movie had great acting and kept me guessing as to who was guilty of murder.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I have heard the gamut of comments on this book. It is not a great work if literature, yet it is not the worst I have ever read. The ending certainly took me by surprise, so I will be looking for the next in the trilogy!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much because my friend told me to play it on her kindle and now I have it on my kindle.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|So I paid, downloaded (I think) and I have no idea how to get to this app. Not in the app section, not where the regular old c a m us, no where to be found. Am I missing something ?? HELP please lol
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game, love the graphics, and the realistic motion. Also think it's pretty awesome that zebra and unicorns are offered for sale ^_^
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I liked this book. It is hard to get me into a book but this one i couldnt put it down.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|with this music in the movie. The happy \\"I',m happy living in paradise while they are stealing my land from me\\" music just provides a bounce and energy to the day.<br /><br />The only thing I'd didn't like was you have to go on-line to find out what the lyrics say. I was hoping for liner notes with Hawaiian and English side by side, but you have to go to [...] and then translate them yourself. What a pain.
B0014DW3OS|5.0|Love this movie. Very entertaining. And apparently there is a minimum word expectation so I have to type some more words.
0062014536|4.0|The book starts off really well, and has a good fast pace.  About three quarters through the book though it kinda felt like she just wanted to end the book off.  The ending to me was not very good because I didn't really feel any real heart racing momentum or climax as in the first two books.  She picks the guy I wanted her to pick, but there was no real closure.  I think if she would have just added at least one more chapter at the end the series would have been concluded much more smoothly.  Overall it was pretty solid, hence the four stars instead of three.  I am sure I will re-read the book but I feel it could have ended better.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is a very fun game that is easy to use. It works great on my Kindle Fire. I would recommend it to anyone.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Big Fan of Moody Blues. Now I am a fan of Justin Hayward and will be adding more of his solo work to my collection. The last two songs on the CD are better in the original format. Not too much into the modern techno style. Every other song is fantastic.
B000KI6286|5.0|This movie is pure AWESOME.  Not only does it have some of the most intelligent and funny writing around, it has a phenomenal cast that will keep you laughing all night.  William H. Macy who refuses to apologize for the great state of Vermont's cheddar is just one of the many highlights.
159448385X|5.0|I've been wanting to reach this book for a while, and recommended it as our next book club reading. I thought that it was quite a step up from Kite Runner, but maybe that's just because I could empathize with women more than Hosseini's male perspective. I'm sad that we don't have a man in our book club to hear he's perspective.<br /><br />A Thousand Splendid Suns had me on edge the whole time. There were points where I did not want to continue reading: my stomach turned with sickness. And other times when I couldn't wait to see what was coming next; praying that there would be something good that came their way, something fair. When I wasn't reading, I was thinking about the characters - I had such a strong commitment to them... a kinship for fellow women.<br /><br />After reading this, I am more grateful for what the freedoms we have, for my husband, my daughter's future... Not that I wasn't aware of oppression before, however, Hosseini's very raw portrait of Afghan women will not leave me for a long time to come.
B009DQQE16|5.0|Her songs is still amazing.<br />A whole generation of boys fell in love with her her as teenagers.<br />This mature album has a quality unsurpassed.<br />Thank you Francoise Hardy.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This book was excellent.  I will look for more of her work too.  I haven't been this engaged with a book in some time, and loved the premise.  Thanks Kate Morton for making such a beautiful piece of work!  The historical / modern days toggling are done really well and the overall approach is great.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game has great realism with movement!  Very fun with competitions and specialized tasks.  The support is very efficient and detailed.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|very enjoyable to play. for me it is both relaxing and challenging to play. great game to pass the time away.
B001U3ZMHW|4.0|My 6 year old loves the Ewoks and with his birthday coming up we splashed out on this set.  To me this is a $100 set, not $150, but there is typical Lego quality and some nice Ewoks (3) in the set as well as the glider.  It would be nice to get an &#34;Ewoks village&#34; set (anyone from Lego reading?) but this is a nice rendition of the story to destroy the Death Star shields.  We thought a long time before buying this and if you can find it for $100 go for it but there is better value for money out there in the world of Lego to spend $150 on.  Of course our son thought it was worth it.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|This is an incredibly sweet, heart-tugging love story that took me back to being a lonely, frustrated teen and falling in love for the first time.  This is one of the best books to come along in a long, long time, and if you're on the fence about reading it, please click that buy button or you will be missing out on greatness!  You will not be sorry--this book is just too amazing for words and I want the whole world to read it, love it and never forget it too.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I went gluten free at the advice of my natural health care practitioner about 4 months ago.  I was extremely skeptical and confident I would not experience any positive health benefits, but since doing so I have 1) lost 10 lbs without trying, 2) no longer have muscle aches that I had for half my life, 3) am sleeping much better, 4) have much more energy, 5) my peri-menopausal hot flashes are greatly reduced, and 6) I have been able to eliminate the daily nasal allergy medication that I have taken for the past 23 years.  I am one of those people who exercises 5 times per week and eats a healthy diet but always struggled to lose the 10-15 lb. spare tire around my waist.  I also had a terrible sweet tooth all of my life and could never have imagined that I could walk past a dessert tray and &#34;take it or leave it&#34; but I can honestly say that I've lost my cravings for sweets and wheat products in general.  I do not have Celiac's disease and can consume small amounts of wheat without dire consequences but I feel so much better without it.  For those who doubt the claims of this book I'd encourage them to try it for one month.
B002N1AEN2|5.0|This was the first time since high school I sat down and listened to every song on an album while staring at the Mac visualizer (which I had streaming onto my plasma screen - pretty cool). The songs are ethereal, but also pack a bass punch here and there that reminds you you're not listening to Hearts of Space on NPR (despite how awesome that program is). This album also represents one of the rare times a guy and a girl can share vocal responsibilities and I don't hate one of them because of it. Perfect blend of post-modern pop and instrumental ambient music.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|This game is awesome, except that of you stay on the beach for midnight , three wolves will attack you. Without shelter at midnight, you're dead meat.  Otherwise, this game is cool!!
B009G8GRX6|5.0|Soooo I never got into Muse.  Everyone said they were great but I just kinda went &#34;meh,&#34; and then went back to listening to Tool, Ours, and the Dresden Dolls.<br /><br />Then I saw this album on sale and thought to myself, &#34;self, it is only $4.  You have spent $4 in many worse ways than in checking out some music that should at least be decent.&#34;  I downloaded the album and then promptly forgot about it without listening to it.<br /><br />Then came today.  While transferring some songs over to my iPod I decided to give &#34;Supremacy&#34; a listen.<br /><br />*blink*<br /><br />&#34;Madness.&#34;<br /><br />*blink blink*<br /><br />Every...single...song on this album is amazing.  &#34;The 2nd Law: Isolated System&#34; is currently finishing up and I think I have to go back to the beginning and experience the journey again...immediately.  I...it makes me want to sing.  It makes me want to create.  It makes my chest feel expansive with the joy that I only feel when I find something truly amazing...something that is worth its space in the world.  I really can not say any more than that; I do not know of higher praise that I can give art.
B008HK3TXK|5.0|I have had other Timbuk2 products and they have always been good quality and long-lasting, so I was excited to try this case.  I loved the design on the oustide of the case.  However, in the picture it looks like fabric , but in person has a more plastic feel, which I guess will be better for keeping it clean.  I had trouble getting the Kindle into the case (it shouldn't be too hard right?).  It looks like the inner part will stretch to fit the Kindle, but it does not.  Soon after I noticed the small hidden velcro on the top.  Once you open that, the Kindle can slide right in.  The case adds a little bulk, but not too much in my opinion.  I love the grippy edges and how it can stand up at different angles.  Overall, I am very happy with this Timbuk2 case!
B007EECSFA|5.0|I absolutely loved this story -it is vividly and beautifully written with unexpected twists and turns, up through the very end. A must read!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a cute game for kids.  However, there are a lot of pop up adds and that can be frustrating.  Overall, a good game.  It can be played offline so that is a plus
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I had to reboot my Kindle and when I opened up the game, my character was gone, scores down to zero, and here's the really weird part: I'm on my own friends list, as in, the new character is unnamed, but my name (along w/my high score) shows up as a competing player. Why is this happening? Plus, my character is spraypainting my OLD high score, as if it still recognizes it but doesn't let me PLAY with my original character. How do I recover my original progress and high score? Help please.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Great price and DVD with alot of extras / bonus material.  Can not wait till 6th Season comes out on DVD.
1616550414|5.0|Anyone who has an interest in the Legend of Zelda should get the Hyrule Hystoria. There are so many details about the Zelda universe I wouldn't have known otherwise... and the concept art is great!
1594135851|4.0|Not quite as good as the first book, but still a very good read.  Actually bought this on my Nook and then here, for some reason.  I expected much of what happened in this book.  It will make a pretty good movie when its released.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is so good I am speechless. I can feel as Ender feels. What he went through was a spectacular read! This is a great read but has some concepts about the world that may not be for young readers. But then again the narrator starts out as 6! But don't be put down by the age! He is wise and kind for his age! I love this book and will read it again!
B000J4QWM2|5.0|Fantastic lost first copy glad to have this movie back in my collection! Great movie loved the actors Jamie and Colin work great together
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So I tried it and it is soooooo fun! You should try it too! I think if you like temple run then you'll like this game!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|After hearing time and time again how awesome this movie was I was eager to see it myself.  It did not dissappoint!  A great movie in itself, but when you consider this is based on actual events it boggles the mind!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I read the first book, and they just keep getting better!! Eager to read the third!!! Great and easy read!!
B00B49L7JY|5.0|After hearing a recommendation for this movie on the radio I was curious to see how good this documentary actually was.  The story behind this documentary is almost too silly even for Hollywood standards.  It is the story of a selfless person finally getting rewarded for this hard work after many years of not believing his work was even appreciated.  Highly recommended!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE this game,but you should not have put little corners around the trains because someone people die faster and you should put out more eggs. My brother,sister,mom,dad,cousins,and I love the ways you created this game. It expires young children discover what they want to be when they grow up. I hope i can do that one day. =)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Like Temple Run,except better!!!!! Love this game! I can't stop playing it!!!I`m addicted!!!! Most everyone in my house who has a hand-hand-held device plays this game!!!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Enjoyed this book. Could not stop reading. I found this series to be more of a twilight type geared more towards adults.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Great app one of the the few games I've played where you don't have to spend real money. You just have to make sure you get neighbors.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book is an excellent read.  Interesting point of view and the characters click. Look forward to this writer's next work.
B005VGMYZM|5.0|I love Andre Rieu, he is the king od waltz, the music is beautiful, he brings life even to old bones!
B00AKO93JK|4.0|I purchased this App as an on-the-road replacement for a more sophisticated home-based exercise system on the Nintendo Wii.  It does a good job for this purpose.  It has wide variety of excercises that can target a specific area or automatically be combined to a full body workout of whatever length you select (up to 30 min.)  I would have like to see it go longer than 30 min., but all you have to do is re-start another routine for the duration you want. Overall, I am please with this purchase.
B009A87Z6U|5.0|It's Daniel Craig as James Bond how can this not be great! I pull it out and watch it with Casino Royal and will buy Sky Fall next!
0811875555|5.0|This is a huge book! Amazing! with lots of concept arts, sketches, storyboards... I'm stunned.<br /><br />I can't find any &#34;screenshots&#34; from the movie itself, and I say this as a good thing, I have the movie, no need for that.<br /><br />Looking at the book you will forget that it is about a 3d animation movie, thanks to the amazing artwork that is in it!<br /><br />A must have. Really worth it.
B008C1O8CA|4.0|A bit too much cussing but it's like classic Green Day.. Not political. But more into \\"don't give a eff\\" style.
1616550414|4.0|Although the book is huge, with lots of information and beautiful artwok, I think I expected more concept arts from the environments and the creating process of the characters (for example, like the art of tangled, now that's something).<br /><br />Maybe less pictures per page too.<br /><br />But overall, it was a great acquisition.
B007XHWROK|1.0|#operationcutforbieber? Mooning instagram? Drugs? Vomiting on stage?10-Year-Old Girls making pages called Sex with Bieber? These are some example why this kid isn't a good example to YOUR kids.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game really really fun hum I don't know wat else to say just get the game its free its fun there's nothing more to say
B005NKGEP2|5.0|Lots of twists and turns!  Kept me glued till the last page!  I Am going to see what other books this author has written.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love this series if you get past the raunchy first book you will fall in love with the characters and the love story! I finished reading and was sad that I wouldn't be able to read in on Christian and Ana's lives! Can't wait to see it portrayed on the big screen!
B008U85TV4|5.0|Party hard is what this album is about, and it it is great. Each song is a knock down party anthem.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Has everything on there u might be looking for. Nice to share thoughts and ideas with others and see what they like.
B009OYSFDM|3.0|Fun, enjoyable, nice plot evolution, but there is no way for the show to escape being cheesy.  No lawyer nontheless one working in a low income clinic wears 4 inch heels. Come on! On the other hand, I have to admit, I turn this show on in no small measure becasue of Arrow and his mahvelous physique. But he is supposed to be fit. A hard working attorney is not likely to wear a size 2 dress and 4 inch heels.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Could not put this down! Had to immediately go to the sequel/prequel Shift, which was just as compelling. Fantastic story!
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|That should say it all. Do one or the other. Having read all the books first, the show is now unbearable to watch. But beautiful. And, extremely wll done.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is a good game if you want to know when the updates come it is usually Late next month or the month after that early
B009JZTOG8|5.0|What an incredibly imaginative show. I find myself believing it all makes perfect sense, even though I know it does not. I was incredibly, wonderfully surprised. This is one good show. It will steal your heart. Literally.So beware.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|This case is a kind of a nothing, but it works. Looks good; fits perfectly. No complaints. Not sure what the little black strap adds, but it's not in the way.
B0030F5W5K|5.0|This is by far my favorite movie. I love watching old movies n this is definitely one of them. A must see
B001ANSS5K|3.0|This book has great, multi-faceted characters. The first few chapters are alive with great conversations and dramatic, fast-paced action.The story is intriguing, although the end is a little weak and talky.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This App makes my Samsung Galaxy Note II an awesome e-reader!  I plan to use it to download inexpensive ebooks to sample new authors.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|this book has a very different approach toward exploring a couple of awful pathologies.  very well written and moves the reader beautifully.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Not a book that I would have chosen to read, but my book club chose it, and I throughtly enjoyed it. Great read.  Makes you think.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It is a great game .. but I've had to install it twice because once you reach a certain point (around level 8) it stops working and will not load .. so you have to uninstall it and reinstall it again and start all over .. great game but it sucks having to start all over
B0042J6VUS|1.0|I took the risk and got it to use with my nokia 808, and well, it doesnt fit well, the top part gets in the way and presses buttons, and the tripod legs are always weak, after some time the tripod legs are just dancing below the ballhead.
078324228X|5.0|Every time I see a Denzel movie, I dream about this good looking sweet man.  As the Hurricane he did a fantastic job of portraying the real fighter who ended up in prison for a crime he didn't commit. I love it when he plays real people because it's like a history lesson and this one made me truly involved in the story.  A must see!
B005H9B44A|5.0|Awesome movie with exciting ups and downs....Even on a small screen, streaming, THOR was a really cool movie to watch again!
B002CPMB9O|4.0|I'm a Denzel fan but I don't like to see him playing such violent parts.  Not that he didn't do a fantastic job because as always he did. His portrayal of a mobster was a very believable of a man who lived a violent life but you get the feeling that he's not happy and that he does it because he feels he has to.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This book is full of twists and turns. As soon as I thought I knew what was going to happen, it would change and blow my mind. I started reading the series after watching the show on HBO. I couldn't wait until the third season but now I would much rather read the books. On to the next book for me!
630471193X|5.0|I enjoyed the VHS version so much that I just upgraded to DVD as the tape version was encountering sound distortion.
B00AA0TZTW|2.0|I love Jimi, but I don't love anything released in his name. Many of these songs were already released in much better forms on vinyl records I have. I don't understand the details, but I know many of the posthumously records were stopped by the Hendrix estate because, I believe, many parts were added later and not of Jimi's doing, including guitars. I say who cares. The songs are much better and people like Alan Douglas deserve a lot of credit for taking the pieces that Jimi left behind and making them into good music. Yes, it is true that he even dumped tracks and added new musicians. Again, I say so what. The songs are much better and the initial creative vision that Jimi laid down cannot be denied or usurped by extra tracks added or changed by Douglas. This album has out of tune guitars on it for chrissake. It just sounds weak and crummy. If you are a Jimi fanatic, of course you will like this. You would probably like a record of Jimi practicing into a cassette recorder. But the music on this record simply isn't that good as presented. If you are not a fanatic, I would pass on this and look for some of those earlier records. Releasing records just to do it, whether it is for money or altruistic reasons, does not serve Jimi's legacy in a positive way. Don't release this kind of stuff. Give license to release those other albums that were stopped and then add liner notes that explains how they were made and what is Jimi and what isn't. This would be fair and the end result would be much better versions of songs that more people would be inclined to enjoy rather than any old stuff you can get your hands on. I like all those earlier posthumously released records by Kramer (Yes, I know he did this one too), Mitchell, Douglas, and Jansen. I don't much care for this.<br /><br />To amend my review after being urged to listen to the album again I would like to include the following: \\"Hey Gypsy Boy\\" is so far out of tune that it is unlistenable. How anyone would dare to release this is beyond me. \\"Mojo Man\\" is purely meh. \\"Villanova Junction\\" sounds like what it is - a completely chopped piece of music. Tunes such as \\"Earth Blues,\\" \\"Somewhere,\\" \\"Bleeding Heart,\\" \\"Izabella,\\" \\"Easy Blues,\\" \\"Crash Landing,\\" \\"Inside Out,\\" and \\"Hey Gypsy Boy\\" were already released in other forms that were reworked and, as a result, sound 100% better than what we have here. All the excellent work that went into making these tunes sound great, while maintaining Jimi's original spirit and vision, have been sucked out of them in this release, making them sound like rehearsal, board tapes. Albums such as Cry of Love, Crash Landing, Rainbow Bridge, and Midnight Lightning need to be re-released in their original mixes. If those other albums had never been released, I would give this album a much higher rating, but I am giving it the rating I am based on the fact that already great versions of most of these tunes exist, making these versions inferior. Jimi's playing is great, but I am not reviewing Jimi's guitar playing here. I am reviewing the quality of the release and so my rating stands. Re-release the old albums!
1452113432|5.0|This cookbook is my favorite...and I have over 100. I love her television show and this has all of her great recipes from there in it. The food is as fantastic as she shows it on tv....love her!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I chose 5 stars because the  book had me totally captivated and spellbound! The beginning was so not where the book ended. Christian Grey is so captivating that I would love to meet him just to try to figure him out. Of course the ending was sad, so I have to get the next book in the series to see what happens next.  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes suspense and romance.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is pretty good, I hope I get free coins fir writing this if not then this game  is poo so don't download it.
B00AJLHUAS|4.0|The CD is fun to listen to.  It has all the feel of the 20s and 30s jazz age - wonderful!
B00008J2PG|5.0|They don't make movies like this any more. I loved it and will watch it again and again! I'm glad I have it in my movie library.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I really like this game. It has great graphics and a good storyline. I also like how many kinds of animals there are to choose from. And you can cross breed for mythical creatures. I recently got the update on this game and I am very excited to reach lvl 50 AND GET THE NARWHAL!! But lately, it has been very lagging and it comes to me with error messages. Also please note that a lot of stuff you can get on here costs real money to buy the peanuts (the premium game currency) And sometimes the rescuing part gets a little UN realistic because who pays 4580 coins for a 50 percent chance...? Apparently I do... overall I really like this game.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|my doter is in love with peter pan so she went nuts over this dvd and waches it all the time
B004XGN8W4|5.0|This so helpful I can bring my xbox or ps3 to places that don't have screen or other sort of screen. I just pack, leave to my destination and plug in
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was amazing! I think better than the first one! I can't wait to start the next one and see how it ends!
B005COO1X6|3.0|Not as intense or suspenseful as other work that's been written.  All in all it was a good read, better than most short stories.
6304068549|1.0|This was clearly a very used product. It not only had showed wear and tear during viewing but lines kept rolling thru the film. Was going to ship back because I did want DVD but by the time I would have shipped it back it would have cost as much as the purchase.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love this game! it entertains me 24/7.the game is fun and it will be very fun for little kids as well!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Hi I have found this app fun , a great game for anyone but especially for horse lovers of all ages, you can do loads of tasks to earn coins.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Good little app, does all that it says it does.  Wish it would go a bit darker since it is still quite bright at night.
B003YUQ71E|5.0|I am addicted to crocs every since my son got me a pair with the cozy liner. I have since bought multiple pair and decided I wanted some knock around, tennis shoe type crocs and these fit the bill. I went with my normal size and didn't size up or down, and these fit just fine. Don't expect a lot of cushion in the sole because it's not there; but is comfortable enough to wear all day and not have tired feet.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|I love this movie and bought it before it came out on Prime, just because I wanted to watch it over and over! Cruise's Ethan Hunt is a more sympathetic character, in my opinion, in this MI movie.  Enjoyed the conflict with Jeremy Renner. Great/terrifying climbing stunt!
B004V71CYQ|4.0|I had never seen the movie. It took me back to the 80's  and the gaming craze that was.  The  two dollar charge was very reasonable in my opinion.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|I have seen this twice now. The character of the villain played by Javier Bardem is worth the price of admission alone.  They work at making Bond seem worn out and haggard...you feel it shift when he shaves and suits up again. Lots of 007 backstory. Lots of boom! ;D
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's good but the dog should be dressed up too. You should add more stuff in the game yo make it good and it seems like you got the idea from temple run but over all it was good and you should lower the charaters to law price that is ok with you guys but that's it bye
B00BESIKWM|3.0|It wasn't the greatest scary movie, but it had great effects and CGI.  The story was good and followed Silent Hill 1, but if you did not watch the first one, you will not get lost.
B008NAFU9A|4.0|Whoa!  I am intrigued with this prequel and I want more!  This is a short read, Kittens so I am not going to go full description.  Ophelia is hiding in a noble home looking for her mother.  When Ethan explains to her that her destiny is greater than herself, her family or even him, Ophelia is reluctant (understatement) to listen to what he has to say.<br />How can a simple girl be something greater than what she appears to be?  When Ophelia realizes that the stories her mother told her as a child were actually lessons, she begins to understand that she is meant for more.<br />When she discovers that the only way to continue on her path is to sacrifice Ethan she makes a choice that may come back to haunt her.<br /><br />[...]<br />I was given a copy by the author in return for my honest review.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Obviously jiggered out of recognition by the Hollywood eyes. Good art direction in terms of period details but lackluster direction and performances make this another case of the Oscar going not to the best movie(Life of Pi, hands down) but the one that upholds the America that is a figment of the national imagination...Made for tv movie quality.
B00796E7CA|5.0|This is another of Tolkien's works that should be made into a movie, which I would be the first to see.
030758836X|2.0|I have a sort of like/dislike opinion of this book.  I read it as a selection for my book club discussion, otherwise I likely would not have finished it.<br /><br />The writing is good, draws the reader in, but the plot was just plain weird.  Further, the plot takes a total complete turn around midway through the book.  I thought at first it was a mystery style, only to find out it was not a mystery at all.  This is not a who-done-it book, even though it seems to start off that way.  If you are expecting a mystery, skip this one.  Its basically a very sad story about the marriage and life of a very deviant personality. If that is your thing you might like this book.<br /><br />Because of the total change in direction the plot took after the first part of the book, I felt very cheated, like the author had wasted a lot of my time having me read through the first part of the book.  This along with the just plain weirdness of the plot and characters made me feel that this book was a total waste of my time.<br /><br />I am reluctant to say too much regarding why I didn't like the book much for fear of giving away too much for any prospective readers.  I don't want to spoil it for you. I will say that the characters are not likeable, in fact one character is just maddeningly unlikeable and frustrating.  I find it hard to read and enjoy a book in which I dislike the majority of people in the book.
1451696191|3.0|I didn't love this book, but I didn't dislike it either.  I picked this book up with very high expectations because of all the raving reviews.  The problem with high expectations is that there is bound to be disappointment.  There were some touching moments and a few memorable quotes that I have seen floating around Tumblr sites, but for the most part it was just \\"ok\\" to me.<br /><br />The book was realistic, touching on many relevant issues - drugs, sex, dating, friendship, etc. I loved the awkwardness and the naïve charm that graced the pages.<br /><br />Charlie was awfully emotional for a teenage boy.  Growing up with two brothers, I don't ever remember seeing them cry.  I read some reviews after I finished the book that mentioned that Charlie was autistic.  I never picked up on that, perhaps I wasn't reading closely enough.<br /><br />The book only spans Charlie's freshman year of high school.  I want to see growth and change in Charlie.  I want to see Charlie find happiness and grow out of his awkwardness.  I guess I just wish there was more of the book.
B00338QENI|4.0|I like non fiction, so this was a great book for me. Interesting story line. My Kindle worked great!!! Fast delivery ..within seconds
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|One of those books you just can't stop reading even if it keeps you up all night. Fantastic from start to finish. The Hunger Games is riveting, thought provoking, and a must read series. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for the next great book
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Just read it. If you like the first one this one is just as good or better. Now how many years will I have to wait for the next book. Booooo
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book keeps you hooked.  Its a great read up until the end---I wasnt real happy with the ending--But overall the book was well done.
B0015DROBO|2.0|Mildly entertaining. too much back story but you can really connect with the characters. I wish I read the book first.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Clint Eastwood still has it!!  Totally enjoyable. I would see it again.  Will recommend to my friends and family members
B008OOYALE|4.0|love the game the graphics and the dragons are worth giving the game a try.only complaint I have so far is small options for what you can grow as dragon food it would nice to have more options. other than that really like the game.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Such a heart warming story.  I've watched it numerous times so I decided to buy a copy. Great, great movie.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This was a delightful read.  The Irish humour was reminiscent of my Newfoundland roots.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It would make for a lovely movie.
B0015AARJI|5.0|el articulo lo recibi en excelentes condiciones, recomiendo a un 100% al vendedor muchas gracias, espero mas adelante<br />seguir comprando
B0034DGPEU|3.0|Too much of a one-sided view on life during this time period in the so-called South.  In most parts, I found it boring.  It was not what I had heard it to be.
030758836X|2.0|Once I started reading this book I could not put it down.  I actually read till 4:30 in the morning because the chapters alternated between those concerning Nick and Amy and I had to keep reading to see what happened next.  About 2/3 of the way into the story, the author seemed to lose her way and the book got more and more implausible. The actual ending was ridiculous. If any book deserved a re-write, it was this one. What a shame as it could have actually deserved a place on the best seller list instead of just selling a lot of copies.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I am a Stephen King fan. I want to say that up front.<br /><br />I was curious bout this book for many reasons.  It seemed a bit different than Mr. King 's usual genre, and I was a bit unsure how he would write a book about time travel and attempting to save President Kennedy.  I can assure you that Stephen King filled this story with all the elements that he is known for - twists and turns, and strange characters.<br /><br />The book begins with Jake Epping,  an English teacher in a high school in a small town in Maine who is asked by the owner of the local diner to do the impossible - go back in time and stop the assassination of President Kennedy.  Jake does not believe his friend's request or story except for one thing; the diner owner who was healthy the day before has aged for years and is suddenly on the verge of dying from cancer.  A short trip \\"down the rabbit hole\\" and the information gathered by his friend make Jake think it  might be possible to do what his friend is suggesting.<br /><br />What Jake encounters in the past often surprises him.  He soon learns that the past doesn't like to change, and that even the smallest changes may have far reaching consequences.<br /><br />This book was a real page-turner for me.  I found the story fast-  paced and interesting. King did a lot of research for this novel and his attention to detail makes it easy to lose yourself in the story, as if you were right there in Texas.  The plot twists and turns are pure Stephen King.  Certainly this is far less macabre than most of King 's books, but it is just as creative and perhaps a bit more thought-provoking.  I highly recommend this novel.
B001BZRUR4|5.0|Started with The Book Thief by this author.  Really enjoyed it, so found other books for my Kindle.  I read this book in one evening.  Couldn't put it down.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Sixto Rodriguez is a great poet and it is a delight to watch the director's cut. which is awesome with scene by scene descriptions.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Simply - a really good read.  Finished this one, and immediately downloaded another book by this author onto my Kindle.  The Messenger.  It was good too!
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|If you have a kindle fire don't even bother trying to download I uninstalled and reinstalled this app 6 times and it still doesn't work I was really looking forward to playing this game too guess ill never get to see if its actually any good or not.
034580404X|5.0|I was amazed what I got for the money I paid. I paid so little and got the books in excellent condition. I will never buy my books from a book store again!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is the best series ever produced on television. I can't wait for Season 4 in January, 2014. I am just disappointed that my favorite character, Matthew, was killed off.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I didn't think this one was as good as the others. There were things that I wish had not happen and things that would have happened to make it better.
B00BDRJ3Z2|2.0|Mostly listen to Texas country, but Luke Bryan isn't bad as far as mainstream country goes.  I typically look forward to the Spring Break albums as they are generally filed with upbeat pleases-everyone summer beer drinking tunes.  If you don't have the previous four releases, by all means, pick this up.  If you do, I suggest passing.  You are forewarned that the two new songs are perhaps the weakest of those that have been included on any of the previous Spring Break albums.  Sadly, this compilation doesn't even have 'I'm Hungover' which is probably the best song...<br /><br />The new songs are 1-star, the included old ones are a 3.  2-Star Average.  I'd bump it to a 3/4 if it included 'I'm Hungover' and 'All My Friends Say', but you'll have to pick those up separately.
B007HC3LHS|3.0|I enjoyed this book, until the ending. It felt rushed at the end, like the author used up too many pages in the beginning and had to hurry on with it at the end.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|While I am not pleased with the dying off of key characters, the show continues to provide outstanding entertainment with mystery, humor and insight into early 1900s British lifestyle. The casting director has deservedly won awards for their work on Downton Abbey. It seems the will continue to be challenged, replacing those entering and exiting the show on a seemingly episode by episode basis. This is not a criticism as much as an observation on the dynamics of a fantastic series. Well done to you all!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's really fun and very addictive. You never stop playing :) the graphics are great and the characters are fun to play with! Great game
B004LROUNG|4.0|I read this book in about 5 days, but I could have read it in one if I had the time to read it all. Each time I put it down I wanted to pick it right back up again. It was your typical John Grisham courtroom tale, but it has a different twist to it. The book was not a story of the plucky lawyer winning a case against a big corporation, instead it was a story of the lawyer losing the case but finding himself. I would recommend it to anyone who likes John Grisham and people who like to read good stories.
B0092ZEIN4|4.0|Well build quality. design not bad.<br /><br />i dislike the led color xD<br />blue or green would be better...<br />too bad does not support iOS (gameloft game)

B00B1OWEVC|1.0|Firstly, I have to say that I have lot of respect for Reznor and Ross and I have nothing against Mariqueen. This is nothing personal, just a review of this particular album, so if you're one of those people who looks at the rating and then feels it necessary to comment with a bunch of immature nonsense, don't bother. Also, I want to note that I would like to give this album a 1.5/5 review, but Amazon won't let me.<br /><br />I can't believe how many people have been referring to this album and the EP preceding it as \\"improvement\\". With the exception of a few musical elements on no more than three tracks, there is nothing on this record that stands out or conveys any point at all (at least in my opinion).<br /><br />I thought the last EP was \\"average\\". Never felt it was good, never felt it was bad, and almost all of it was weighed down by one track. It is incredible how much your opinion can change with the rest of the album. For starters, musically this is hit and miss - mostly miss. Some of the percussion on \\"And The Sky Began To Scream\\" is appealing and pretty much all of Ige Age sounds nice. Pads towards the end of \\"How Long?\\" are interesting. It's not up to Reznor or Ross standards but it's not bad...on those tracks. This record will have a pattern where there's a track that's real nicely layered, with detailed sample work and a nice atmosphere, and then the next track has percussion that sounds like it was made in FL Studio out of stock samples taken from an old drum machine. Same goes for melody, you'll get some really nice leads and backing pads, and then the next track will be something that sounds utterly broken. Not broken in a good way like an old Skinny Puppy album or the like, broken like sine waves being randomly thrown in at intervals of the beat, completely dissonant, with no structure or build ahead of that dissonance to give it any context at all. Both the intro and outro are excruciatingly weak, especially the outro. It's 7 or so minutes of a repeating, uninteresting beat, with some piano notes, as a \\"The Frail\\"-esque ambient background comes in along with a few other backing sounds-and that's it. Nothing we've not heard before, in much better form from Reznor. That's what's so funny about all the people going \\"if you're looking for an NIN sound, you won't find it here\\". The album actually retains TOO MUCH of an NIN sound and because of that it comes off musically as a combination of Year Zero, Ghosts and the first HTDA EP, except being weaker than all three.<br /><br />Now, let's get on to the biggest issue of this album: the lyrics (and I mean the lyrics themselves, many people will complain about the sound of Mariqueen's vocals but honestly that bothers me much less than what she's actually saying). Jesus Christ, they sound like they were written by a 12 year old. He's not by any means an amazing lyricist but there's no way Reznor wrote these. Lines like \\"the more we change, everything stays the same\\", \\"the beginning is the end\\" and \\"how long can we keep holding on\\" frequent the album. The former is expressed more than once, another example is Ice Age - \\"I find it looks the same but everything has changed\\"...except now they totally contradict each other. Here's some more:<br /><br />\\"Worn the skin off both my knees<br />Waited oh so patiently<br />Staring straight into the sun<br />Never thought you would've come<br /><br />No, no<br />No, no<br />No, no<br /><br />Somewhere sits an empty throne<br />Like we've always kind of known<br />Variations on a theme<br />And the sky began to scream\\"<br /><br />It's seriously hard to even get through the tracks without cringing. It almost seems like they were written with literally the most vague of ideas, with word choice adhering to the most basic rhyme schemes possible, without being revised even once.<br /><br />Take all of these issues and wrap them up in an album complete with that pretentious \\"Hey Look we're choosing to puNctuate this HOW we want to_____\\" stylization on the titles (WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN THE ID3 TAGS!) and you have Welcome Oblivion.<br /><br />I had a lot of hope for this band. A lot. I've listened to this thing many times since it was first available on Pitchfork's Advance service and now in lossless quality. It has not grown on me. I have appreciated, to some degree, all of Ross and Reznor's work in NIN, the soundtracks and HTDA's EPs to some degree, but I just can't appreciate this. If it were completely instrumental it would be better, but even still just average at that. There's a lot of things they could have done to make HTDA its own thing and not have it sound like NIN. They could have dabbled into IDM territory. They could have aimed for a more organic sound. Hell, they could have gone Throbbing Gristle style and decided to make some actual industrial music since NIN gets so much flak for being called inappropriately called industrial. What they did was none of these things, and I honestly would say that this sits fairly below \\"Things Falling Apart\\" quality in the scope of Reznor's work. I tried to enjoy it, but I just have to be honest. I hope that whatever he works on in the future will not be in this sort of style again.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|While the actors are not as well known or accomplished as those in the classic Masterpiece series, \\"I, Claudius\\", this series on the fall of the Roman republic and the rise of Julius Caesar is a very worthy effort.  The producers tried to be very historically accurate with even the smallest details, which I found very enjoyable, as I really hate it when historical dramas take too much license with the history and it ends up uninteresting and inaccurate.  They also did a good job with their portrayals of 'background' characters- people who existed at the same time as the historical events in the story, but their roles are fictionalized- these people made the whole thing more human, so that the main characters didn't seem like statues in their own story.  If you like historical dramas, or you are a Roman history buff, this one will surely not disappoint.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this keeps my daughter busy and virtually allows her to care for a horse. overall, a great game to let kids play!
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Great story lines, visuals and characters -- even if seeing everyone smoke 24/7 skeeves you out.  Well worth the purchase.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|This is a really good story, It is the tender story of a professional relationship that becomes more from the perspective of one of the characters but is doomed from the start to end sadly.. This an entirely different role for Helen Hunt. She pulls it off remarkably.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|How to win was a very easy read, it was more like a pamphlet than novel. It is a culmination of blog posts, which are extremely germane to the entrepreneurial journey we all choose to travel if that is your field. I found the plain spoken tenure of the book to be refreshing and truly enjoyed the outright intimacy of his journey. There is no guaranteed path to success that budding entrepreneurs can travel, but Mark provides a practical perspective in the raw honesty documented in this book. I found myself echoing some of the same values and I believe this book is a must read for all entrepreneurs.<br /><br />Jay Pendarvis<br />President<br />Cerebral Solutions Inc
B00APUQRPC|5.0|A good story about the development of understanding and respect between a father and his daughter. i found the characters to be well portrayed and very believable. it is a &#34;feel good&#34; movie but not at all sappy.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|It doesn't matter how many times I have watched this movie in the past , I still enjoy it the same now! So glad it's back! A must see movie :)
B0014BC3C2|4.0|This is a very entertaining movie involving a mistaken identity. It is fictional but raises the question, &#34;What if this could happen.?&#34;
B0036EH3XE|4.0|The price was right and it arrived the next day.  Loved this series and was excited to see the bonus features.  I'd give them an 85%.  There was one interesting scene with Ben at the mainland warehouse that would send the supplies to the island.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I loved this move. Without trying to give to much away it's about a girl trying to be her own person in a kingdom that demands she does exactly what she is supposed to.<br /><br />I love all of the characters, and think that this was an extremely well written and animated movie.<br /><br />I watched it 3 times within 24 hours :)
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Great price on a used cover. Seems to protect well. Does what it should and is not bulky at all
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was an easy and enjoyable read. A nice story to lose yourself in for an afternoon. I would recommend this book.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this book a lot.<br />It really tells you the story of christian and Anastasia. And the love for each other.
B000FCKIFU|5.0|If you're new to David Baldacci, this is a good place to start. &#34;The Camel Club&#34; is the first book in a four part series detailing the adventures of John Carr alias Oliver Stone and his circle of friends: The Camel Club. Follow their attempts to uncover Washington's political intrigue and redeem the powers that be. Once you get into the story line you'll find the book hard to put down and won't stop until you reach the end. Each of the characters is well developed and the story lines are infectious... by the time you finish this one you'll eagerly move to the next book: &#34;The Collectors&#34;. Good read!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Thought this was gonna be another typical &#34;young adult&#34; love story but was pleasantly surprised.  The story moved pretty smoothly and there were a lot of twists I didn't see coming.  Loved the main characters and the author's style of writing.  Read it in about 2 days!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This was a fantastic book.  Loved it from start to finish.  It gave really good insight into how fostered children feel.

B00BB8SKPW|3.0|The acting was great, but the storyline was not credible.  It's really a dark movie.  I would not recommed this too readily, even though I like Denzel Washington.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I absolutely love how this book was. Everything in this book kept u on reading was never a dull moment. That's how I like reading books. Love love love this one!
B001P9KR8U|4.0|The product was received well in advAnce of the effected date and the product exceeded my expectations.  Good quality and the packaging was in good quality as well.

B004LWZWGA|3.0|Must love Batty-man and &#34;Gothic&#34; crap.  Great special effects and wild cars.  Bad guy is good actor, but it only goes so far.  Guess it is a good thing that this is suppose to be the last Batty-man movie.
B0019IB0II|4.0|My drummer had a massive stroke 071212. I knew nothing about strokes. This gives information<br />on what someone who had a stroke experienced. She was a brain scientist, no less and regardless of having the stroke, she<br />remembered everything.
B005MMY4SU|3.0|This show wasn't bad, and it's a shame that it was canceled so early because it had potential. The cast in this show was pretty good, with the exception of the main character. Jamie Campbell Bower doesn't cut it as Arthur. I thought his acting was weak and he seemed like a child, this might have been somewhat a result of the writing, but that doesn't make the show any better.<br /><br />The writing in much of the show was your usual recycled concepts throughout much of the series, but towards the end it got a bit better.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that when you play an app, you love it for like five seconds then you just say&quot; I am soo bored of this game.&quot; we can all relate to that, right? well there never is really a game that you think will be so great for so long, but then subway surfers came along. at first I saw the game and thought it was Boring, but when I played it I was amazied! the parkor and free runing made me feel like I can do all those stuff but I really can't. and since I am part of the next generation, this game will stay on our phones and tablets for a very long time. I hope you enjoy this game as much I did. oh and by the way, the cast of colorful charecters makes me want to buy the coins so badlly. I rate this game the best one ever!  :) :) :):) :)
B000YJ85BI|5.0|I've enjoyed the entire series, and this one did not disappoint. The characters, story, and environments are always great. Stayed up way to late in order to finish it. No regrets though.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Really enjoyed hearing from the dogs perspective.  The happy ending didn't hurt either.  Would encourage others to read for a good time.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|It was fun until we stopped receiving shards of magic, and new challenges. We have bought all the ponies we can with coins and now get a fake welcome screen.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Really enjoyed this book - hard to put down.  Sky and Holder have a great emotional connection that makes her feel like they've known each other longer than they have.  I won't bore you with details as there are thousands of reviews here, but the story does unfold to reveal that they have indeed been reunited.<br /><br />I will say that I thought it was well written for a self-published novel.  I have read my share of such publications and this one is by far among the best when it comes to editing/grammar, etc.  It does annoy me to read reviews of haters who clearly are reading books that are not for them.  If you can't get past a few typos and grammatical errors than stay away from self-pulished titles. No this is not a YA book for 12 year olds and just because the parents do not play a siginificant role in this story doesn't mean it's an unplausible premise.  As for comments that Sky and Holder are solving her trauma of sexual abuse as a child by jumping into bed is ridiculous.  This story does not deal with the aftermath of the situation, it's a revelation and a beginning.  It shows victims reclaiming themselves and finding a connection with a person who loves them. It's reclaiming an act that was meant for showing love rather than the hate it has been associated with. I do agree the \\"resolution\\" with her father was a little to easy but I don't think it takes away from the bigger storyline.  One of the last passages has Holder telling Sky \\"We both have so much to work through...there will be days that I don't think we'll know how to survive.  But we will...because we have each other.\\"<br /><br />I am a forty-something mother who really enjoys a great romance, the idea of finding a soulmate.  It's a relationship story and for me, nothing compares to the intensity of first love. The love scenes are tastefully written and quite honestly the hottest passages are early in the story where he wants to draw out the anticipation of their first kiss. This book demonstratesthat you don't need endless pages of explicit sex to be sexy.  I highly recommend Hoover's YA novel - Slammed, Tammara Webber's Easy and Jamie McGuire's Beautiful Disaster.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Just what I needed&hellip;a simple calculator for everyday use.  Plus it is free.  In these tough economic times when the price of everything seems to be rising...it is nice to see the there are people out there that give what they develop for free!
B006LSZECO|2.0|Initially, I didn't like the style of writing but as I got into it, I liked it.  The antagonist's character flaws (borderline personality disorder) became more apparent in time but you kept hoping the &#34;hero&#34; would grow a pair and stand up but no, he caves and the book drops you off a cliff at the end leaving the reader with a feeling of &#34;bookus interruptus&#34;, totally unsatisfied.
1250006341|5.0|So glad season three is available while it's still being aired on PBS!  Very very much worth the price tag.
B0046A9MRW|4.0|Expect a great deal of surprise from the ending of this book. As the story unfolds it becomes increasingly difficult to put together all the pieces. As usual in Agatha Christie's short stories, characters' psychology is thoroughly described and the first-perosn narrative gives you a very capturing portrait of Poirot in its quest for the truth. Just a couple of typos in the kindle edition. Overall, this is one of those books that you can't put down.
B009JZVT70|5.0|We started watching this show as a family, kids ages 11 & 9, and now we can't stop! There's something for all of us! Great show!!!
B00AFROVQC|4.0|Easy read and short book. Caught me very fast. I like the book, but the plot and the stories seems to bee too simple/fast/easy at times. Could have been better if more though had gone into the numerous smaller story-lines in the book. Some of them end abruptly without a proper closure. Need a spell check also

In a whole category of music full of consumerism, lies, fairy tale thugs and garbage lyrics comes some dude out of Seattle talking the truth without a record label?  Love it.  I don't listen to hip hop anymore.  This has finally given me a reason to and hasnt left my playlist for weeks.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|it is ok but it is really easy so if you want challenging  game this is not for you. this is really fun and is always fifteenth.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thought the book was very well written. Kelly my attention going and going and when it was done my attention never let go. Great book
B00834FP5A|5.0|It is hard not to play with it!! It's so awesome at first couldn't stop hugging & kissing it, jumping with just pure joy!! You need an extra one for your Monster Hunter collection. At first I thought it was pricey. Having it my hand changed my thoughts.
B0053O89IS|5.0|So glad when the season DVDs come out, because inevitably I'm missed some, and I enjoy watching &#34;beginning to end&#34; without ads or interruptions. This is one of the best-conceived series out there IMHO, so I wouldn't miss keeping my collection up for anything. Well worth it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I originally steered away from this game as I thought it was a knock-off of Temple Run. But a friend showed me the game and I instantly had to have it. The in-game challenges as well as seeing the scores of your friends keep it engaging. I also enjoy that since I got this app not too long ago, it has changed from NYC to Rio and now to Rome which provide an interesting change of pace at no cost to you.<br /><br />tl;dr - fun game, fun challenges
B00AF7Z44K|4.0|Just keeping my collection complete re Merlin. It was so well-conceived, although it did have slumpy spots. But on the plus side: HERE BE DRAGONS!!! So I can't complain at all!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Suzanne Collins,you did an excellent job on all the hunger games books. it was amazing!good books!very good story to the books.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Upon first seeing Temple Run 2 in the App Store, I was concerned about that it wouldn't live up to the first. I was wrong. I still play the original, but this one is just as good, if not better. I like riding in the mining cart, and the ziplines are cool. I also thought it was funny that the cronies are gone and its just one big a** on your heels... Great hand-eye coordination and a great way to burn through a hour or so....
030758836X|4.0|Gone Girl is one of the most suspenseful books I've read in ages.  It keeps you glued to your seat or up all night...Imagine my disappointment when there was no plot resolution, in the manner of the Twilight Zone.  Amazing to read but very unsatisfying.  I don't know if I could recommend it in good conscience.  Definitely about the journey.
B0051T46XM|5.0|Great quality. I don't use my blu-ray often but when I popped this movie in is was clear as real life! great flick!!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This is a really good mouse.  Just got it today and have customized 3 profiles already, Dota 2, Battlefield 3, and normal use and browsing.  all of the profile work perfectly, and mouse accuracy is amazing.  Great gaming mouse.  I highly recommend buying this.  The feel is really good for people like me, who have medium - larger sized hands, but can be good for people with smaller hands too.  Great customization options, and the mouse worked perfectly right out of the box.  the drivers only took a minute to find, download, and install.<br /><br />Pros: everything about the mouse so far i really like<br /><br />Cons: cant find any yet<br /><br />Overall: get this mouse.  it is a great beginner and even experienced gaming mouse user
1455502626|5.0|Plum Island is a fun read and the start of a really great series...lots of detail but worth the concentration...
1608871045|5.0|Love how they tied all three movies together. This is the casebook Alfred threw in the incinerator in &#34;The Dark Knight.&#34;
B000ULQV0W|5.0|When this movie came out I was obsessed with the Story, I researched Chris McCandles and hislife  The music was great.  Eddie Vedder, job well done
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It was a little glichy but was fine in the endhi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi
B003INBNXO|5.0|The story of Bruce Lee's teacher that takes place during the Japanese Invasion of China.  My wife is Chinese and really enjoyed this one.
B000NGTJTY|4.0|This was a little slow the second time watching it, but still very good. Caught a lot more on the replay :)
B004S3MB2U|4.0|I normally use RealCalc and I like it a lot. I tried NeoCal and thought I might be switching because I like the way Neo has multiple screens for its different modes (financial, statistical, etc) it makes for a very clean and uncluttered look. I also like the way unit conversions and constants are done. It saves a few button presses. Then I noticed that it doesn't appear to have fractions which RealCalc has. That's the deal breaker for me. If it does do fractions, I can't find it and it doesn't seem to be covered in the user guide.
B004478AS4|4.0|I had to read this book for my AP world class. It was better than I expected it to be!
B00AA0TZTW|3.0|Everything released after Jimi died is suspect... They, obviously didn't meet Jimi's standards and were placed on the back burner. Admittedly, many items sitting around, in the recording vaults, had and still have merit. But to treat their release with extreme fanfare is pure BS. These albums tend to be of lesser quality and do a dis-service to the occasional Jimi listener... that's why the standard albums still exist. AYE, Axis:, Electric Ladyland, Smash Hits, First Rays Of The Rising Sun & Band Of Gypsys are the core... everything else is secondary... granted, not bad to most listeners ears, but secondary.<br /><br />Alan Douglas did not treat Jimi's legendary career as lovingly as he would have you think. Warner/Reprise wanted product and later Capitol & Ryko got involved. Mix in a bit of Polydor and you have a mess of people that want to wring out more money out of lesser quality cuts.<br /><br />That Jimi's family got control of his catalog and unreleased recordings and attempted to straighten out the mess was a mixed blessing. They could only do so much. Deletions in the library were expected... alternate versions, alternate takes, alternate mixes is what we have been purchasing for the last 18 years. Dagger Records (ran by Jimi's family) did the best by eliminating the hype of \\"new\\" releases and dishing out some tasty albums... not perfect but well worth finding and owning. The MCA contract in 1995 seemed like a wonderful fit and many were caught off-guard when Sony/Legend offered a new contract. It was accepted by the family and here we are today. Listening to Jimi... but not the way he could have ever imagined. I'll, somewhere along the way, purchase People, Hell And Angels, like I did with Valleys Of Neptune. I will enjoy what I can of the album but will feel that the legendary artist has had his patina scuffed up with a power-sander.<br /><br />It has just come to my attention that Experience Hendrix/Eddie Kramer have stated that People, Hell And Angels will be the LAST STUDIO ALBUM issued by them. From now on, all we will hear is live concert recordings. Guess someone realizes that they may have scraped the bottom of the barrel a bit too much.
B0063IH60K|3.0|works fine. ya ya ya ya y ay ay ay ayyay yay yaibzy ay a y a y  ya  ha
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Detective John Corey combines a refreshingly irreverent sense of humor and extremely good detective/anti terrorist capabilities.  When reading The Panther, I laughed throughout the book at his zingers while at the same time being engrossed in a compelling plot with plent of surprising twists.
1451648537|5.0|Regardless of how you feel about Steve Jobs or Apple products you cannot deny the influence he and they have had on our lives. Knowing their story is a must, imo. I think that this book did a great job of giving an insight as to what Steve Jobs was like and the life he lived. He was strange and difficult to deal with but a part of that is also what made him so brilliant. If I were to complain about this book I think that some of the information seemed to be repeated. Also, I thought that there were some events in his life that was missing such as the deaths of his parents or maybe I just totally skipped that part? Overall it was a great book and worth your time to read it.
B0000YEEGM|5.0|Story of a selfish man comes to know and love is autistic brother who at first only meant money to him.
0062014536|3.0|I was SOOOOO disappointed in the ending! I loved the 1st 2 books and I even liked this book until the ending!  I just couldn't believe that was it.
B00001W9G0|5.0|The story line takes place from college days up thru retirement.  WWII is in between.  What fame can lead us to.
B007N31ZKQ|5.0|If you have not yet watched this film then you have missed-out on one funny movie! John Goodman IS perfect and Jeff Bridges is flawless!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I hope I like it it must be a fun channel because it looks fun so I hope I like the weather channel love you.
B0024HH32A|5.0|This, in my opinion, is one of the ten best movies of all time AND NOW in BluRay, so you can REALLY find out for yourself if Hot Lips is a real blonde!  BUY IT TODAY!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Lots of extreme and intense moments.  Great characters and awesome cast.  I love it!  I can't wait to see more.
B001P1MZNI|4.0|There's always an occasion when listening to Frank's greatest is relaxing.  The price was the motivating factor - it'll not be in my queue - but I'll know it's there when the mood is right.
B000F7CMRM|5.0|I feel he was better in Michael Clayton, but still, an exceptional job of acting by Clooney.  The other actors, the writing, the direction are all first rate.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This book is amazing! I love how the author incorporated so many forms of technology and the written word into this book. I had difficulty putting it down to take breaks! I read it for a local library book club and never would've picked it up otherwise. I'm so glad that I did. The prose is very sharp, concise and lyrical. Highly recommend it!
B0018QCXH8|5.0|like george c. scott in Patton; or marlon brando in streetcar named desire and on the waterfront--a magnificent performance and acting in its most glorious form.  he owned the character and it showed.  his finest performance, better than Lincoln or My Left Foot.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow!! I couldn't put this book down for a moment! The twists and turns were great.... and you can really relate with Sky to the point you bale your eyes out during moments when she is dealing with her past. Definitely recommended....
B007REV4YI|5.0|Best 007 Movie yet, can't wait for the next one!! You won't be diaasapointed in this movie. It's a must have!
006088732X|5.0|My daughter loved it and asked me to get her the other books in the collection of which I will.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Excellent - pity it had to have the 'Hollywood scene' with police cars travelling at the same speed as a 747 taking off !!!
B007I2BZIE|4.0|They have lost their way in the past couple of albums, but this one is getting alittle closer to their sound and ideals of doing their kind of music. I liked it!
B004PGO25O|4.0|If you are in business, own a business, or in some type of self motivated industry get the book. The book is very straight forward, no bull, no long winded crap. Just straight forward. This will go on my reread shelf for sure.
B006ZCWU5K|4.0|Bruce is always entertaining, but this one is a little closer to his norm. I think he is finally showing us back to the guy that is driving his kid in his lap... through his hometown...
B004XN3FHA|5.0|I have the TK45 and fell in love with it. Well built, feels good, and energy efficient. This one is the same. The throw on this is great.  You can see where the light is but to far for the eye to really make out what is out there. Precise threads, good O rings, and well sealed. Fenix also did a great job of heat distribution. The head gets warm but never hot. I use eneloop rechargeable batteries.
B00723NWJE|4.0|This is a little more like what she started doing. Sometimes, and artist takes a turn in their material that we don't like. Sometimes they realize it. I think Nora has. She is mixing it up a little more here. worth the money if you're a fan.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game it is like having and raising your own horse with out all the expenses. I would recommend this game to anyone.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|Wreck it Ralph is a gorgeous, fun, and entertaining movie! Disney has put out some great titles recently and although this one lacks the usual musical flare of the classics and Brave... It's very well done.
B00BHMF578|4.0|I liked the movie. However, Amazon does not support 5.1 Sound. I had to use Stereo to hear what was said. Amazon should fix this problem.
B004S3MB2U|4.0|So, I bought this as the free app of the day. I thought it would be a crappy $10.00 app you know cheap, a rip off.Nope I was wrong! You can even add liters and kilograms.We are learning about the metric system in class. I would've loved it to be able to add fractions. As a fifth grader,I understand those other symbols mean much more things,but I love the fact it was free.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|ive played for weeks on my kindle fire now it will not open anymore... smh I cant figure out why its not opening.. ive tried everything..
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|it's a simple calculator, limited features, and doesn't get order of operations, there are many better options out there ...
B00004Z4WR|5.0|i like nicolas cage. ive got most of his movies. he is a good actor.i would recommend this movie to everyone i know
B004S3MB2U|4.0|This is definitely a good calculator, it even understands order of operations. however, I personally prefer to enter the whole formula at once before it tries to solve, and see previous results TI style, so I will stick with panecal (free).
B000N6U0E2|4.0|i like this movie .i love this movies story line .  i would recommend this movie to anyone i know
B005GFPZYK|4.0|For a non American (and non military) reader, it is quite incredible what modern soldiers endure during war time. Chris gave more than most for his country, and sadly ultimately now has given his life.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|i was so proud to watch this movie for so many reasons.  the cause, success, history and Ben Affleck's terrific work.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|Between Breaking bad and The Walking Dead, AMC has my hubby and I hooked on their programing. WOW! That's all I gotta say about these shows!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This show is crazy and yet I am so intrigued I cannot stop watching! Makes you just want to keep watching!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another great Mitch Rapp book by Mr. Flynn! I thoroughly enjoyed it!  I would recommend this and all of Vince Flynn's books.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The third season of Downtonw Abbey has it all, and more!  For fans of the show, you will not be dissappointed.  Dame Maggie Smith is perhaps at her best every, and that is saying something!  Her quips will kee you rolling in laughter, and all the other actors portray their charaters with amazing depth and finesse.  Worth every penny!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm not much for horror / gore but this character driven show is the exception.  I turn my  head through the really gory parts so I can watch the development of these complicated characters. Great show!
0385335997|5.0|\\"It has always been forever, for me, Sassenach\\"<br /><br />Voyager is the third installment in the Outlander series.  After the roller coaster ride that was Dragonfly in Amber, I was excited/nervous/happy to get to this one.  Diana Gabaldon didn't let me down!  I am so attached to these characters that I actually got sick to my stomach while reading.  We have such a long way to go (book 8 is coming out this fall) that I know any \\"Happily Ever After\\" is far down the road.<br /><br />No plot summary - it would be impossible without spoilers.  We get to spend more time with our major characters (Jamie, Claire, Brianna, Roger and so on.)  Plus, we learn more about some minor players (Lord John Grey, Laoghaire-yuck, Jenny, Ian, Fergus).  And we meet new people (William, Marsali).<br /><br />I'm loving Lord John Grey and have already picked up two of his books to read later.  I could have done without Laoghaire (honestly, couldn't it have been anyone but her?)  Anger doesn't describe the emotion this caused for me.  Claire is much more forgiving than I would be.  Let's just leave it at that.  Interested yet?  YOU HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK!!<br /><br />While I loved Voyager and am patiently waiting to get to the next book, I do have some concerns about the series going forward:<br /><br />  - As I mentioned above, we have a long way to go.  It seems that Claire, Jamie and the others get themselves into one predicament after another.  I'm worried this could become old if it continues for 5+ more books.  Hopefully DG will find other ways to advance the story.<br /><br />  - Coincidence upon coincidence.  Claire and Jamie seem to run into people that they know all the time and all over the world.  In 2013, the world is a rather small place and I can see this happening but in the mid-1700's?  I'm not sure it really makes sense for Jamie to meet up with a person he met in Europe while in the West Indies.  And, Claire meets the ancestor of her friend from the 1960's.  If this happened occasionally, it wouldn't stand out but it happens ALOT and I don't want the story to become hokey.<br /><br />  - Is anyone ever really dead?  There are times when I was reminded of watching 'the stories' with my grandmother.  Noone ever really dies on a soap opera and apparently not in the Outlander world either.<br /><br />None of these concerns kept me from enjoying the book but were in the back of my mind.  Honestly, no matter what happens, I will be there with this series until the end.  Jamie and Claire are a part of me now and I have to see them through.  I hope they do finally receive their proper ending.<br /><br />5/5 stars for a great book!!
B005LAIIPS|4.0|This movie came in good shape just like was promised the only thing it didnt say was that it would say Renal on the cover and dvd so i you dont care about how that looks, good product
0618680004|5.0|The product was a gift that my boyfriend had been wanting for some time.  He was delighted by the gift, and was not expecting tickets or a signature of Richard Dawkins.  The seller was kind enough to email me that there were some slight discrepencies with the product.  This didn't matter, but it was still awesome of him to let me know this.  Very satisfied with my purchase.
1449410243|1.0|Got this book for my birthday from a well-intentioned relative. Not only is it not funny, but its \\"humor\\" isn't even vaguely cat-based. More like \\"frat boy watches The Office, imagines his insights are hilarious.\\" Ugh. Don't waste your time.
B00940XIGU|5.0|It was easy to work with this shipper. I have no complaints about them. Everything was great and without problem.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome! Super addictive! It's really fun and entertaining. You will stay on playing it for hours. Love it! :) Everyone should try it. If you like temple run, you will for sure like this.
1401937519|5.0|Great book that gives you a whole different way of looking at how what you want is so important to your life.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I can't say 5 stars only because it isn't GREAT literature.  I mean, not Epic, life changing.<br />But what a story!  Just pure pleasure.  And, mind you, I do not consider myself a \\"dog lover\\" by a long shot!  When my husband described the book to me, my interest was luke-warm.  But as he read more, something must have piqued my interest, because I did pick it up and started reading.<br />And in no time, I was caught up in the book.  Yes, as one review said, I guess (looking back) that much bad luck could not happen to one guy.  Yes, I guess he made some mistakes in judgement decisions.  But somehow I didn't see any of that while reading the story.  I was just there with him all the way.<br />And oh my!  The dog won me over with his wry observations and his wit and wisdom.  I just loved it when he grabbed the paper and flew through the window.  I was cheering!<br />But the best part?  I found my self re-living the book, re-writing some chapters, and definitely writing a sequel in my mind.  For days on end!  For me that means it's a great book (or movie).  I love to \\"continue\\" the story in my head.<br />And if you ARE a dog-lover, then this might even be a 5-star for you!
B007W1BLN0|3.0|I think the lead character of this movie is a self centered selfish and ridiculous young man who is rebelling against society for the sole purpose of making a point that he can do it.  In reality, at the end it was shown he really can not do it and the revelation of what was truly important came to light.  It was well shot and acted which is why I gave it three stars not because I liked the subject matter or premise.  There are many others who deserve to be chronicled who have truly done something meaningful in their lives.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This book is highly acclaimed for good reason. It is s thoroughly researched, readable, picture of our probably greatest president.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|You get lost in a time and place that is so different from today and yet shares so many common denominators.  You really feel and understand the purpose of place and will be amazed at the production teams attention to detail.  How can you go wrong with the team of actors including Maggie Smith and now Shirley MacLaine.  If you love history, intrigue, romance and understanding the human condition you will love Downton Abbey.
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|enjoyable, easy tweens read.  lots of fun. lots of magic. 6 books in the series- all read like one long fun, easy-to-read fantasy fling!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Wonderful writing. Was so depressed when the book ended. Can't wait for the third one to come out. Want to see what happens to all of them.
B000UX6TRK|5.0|I have always been a fan of Lionel and I could watchy this over and over again! He is the best!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was so good! I cant wait to read what else Mira Lyn Kelly has to offer!!! I would gladly recommend this book to anyone!
B005NJFSZK|5.0|I bought htis for my nephew in England as it was so expensive over there. He loved it as he is an avid racing fan - especially Lewis Hamilton!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Good to have an instant source for local and national weather. Very important app and glad to have it on Kindle.
B005IS565S|5.0|This is the greatest cd i have ever gotten, and its the best one hey have ever written, and it has amazing sound quality.
B00AA0U046|5.0|I am very impressed with the vinyl release of this album. they did a great job and chose a great manufacturer.Probably one of the nicer I have seen rivaling MFSL. It's beautifull, shimmering, thick, quality, numberd edition gatefold with 200 gram double LP and has a nice LP sized book with some great photos and lyrics. The LP's sound great to me.<br /><br />Music is my religion.<br /> Jimi Hendrix
B008QTVNUI|5.0|It is really great to finally have a series that is both entertaining and intelligent.  For those who may have enjoyed programs like &#34;The West Wing&#34;, this is an ideal series for you.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I love this show!!! I love the twists and turns that the show takes! Kevin Bacon is awesome! This is now my favorite show!
1616550414|5.0|The Hyrule Historia is an excellent source for Legend of Zelda Lore and information. The concept art is amazing and having the Chronology/Time Line is awesome. This has inspired me to get the few LoZ games I have yet to get. My only compliant (Minor) is that there wasn't a whole lot mentioned on the musical score of the series, would have loved to have seen more.
B003YFIUW8|1.0|The voice of this novel--a child's is far too embelished with silliness and seems inauthentic--thus a real bore to read.  I did not like this novel and found the concept ridiculous.
B003OUXECE|5.0|It was a great read. Gives a lot of backstory into rapture and the little sisters/ big daddies in general
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|This is the best new album in many years.<br />I received it yesterday and I'm on my third time through it.<br />There is really not a weak track on the entire album.<br />Joe's lyrics are engaging and his playing is as good or better than ever.<br />You can immediately recognize Jeff Lynn's influence and it's all good.<br />I had this blaring on my very fine home stereo and the audio quality is top notch.<br />The booklet that comes with the cd has some interesting info and I'm definitely looking forward to watching the dvd, which has 3 live performances and some other stuff.<br />I just got tickets to see Joe in April and I'm super excited after listening to this.<br />Go and pick this one up!
B00B2JOJIM|5.0|Track 4 is the best of the maxi single. I can't hardly wait for the CD to drop later this month.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Main character was annoying, needy, and inexperienced. I prefer a more powerful woman in control of her destiny. Not a little girl lost in her fairytale. She had everything material things and sex but she always want more. I hate sad endings. I'm sure there would have been a better ending with a more powerful woman.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I have played a lot of HOG games some better then others...I was reluctant to buy this game after the last G5 game I got kept making me start over halfway through but this one worked fine! good story line and nice graphics.
B0090CVJZ4|5.0|The AmazonBasics Banana Plugs are a perfect solution for making quick wired connections for speakers and other electronic projects. The 24k gold plated plugs make positive low resistance connection. The rear of the plug is pre-drilled to make piggyback connections. The internal screw threads make a secure connection for common speaker wire gauges. The barrel of the connector has a color coded plastic band for ease in tracking polarity.<br /><br />When I recently upgraded both of our home theater setups to accommodate the digital audio outputs from our LED HDTVs, I was stunned at how many banana plugs we ended up utilizing and temporarily ran short during the project.<br />To determine how many you will need, keep in mind both positive and negative wires each need their own connector and both ends of each wire run may need a pair depending on your equipment and the application being utilized.  So in a typical Dolby 5.1 setup may require up to 10 pairs for the \\"5\\" speakers and possibly 1 pair total for a powered subwoofer or two pairs for a non-powered subwoofer.  In a Dolby 7.2 system (as I was installing), for example, would require up to 14 pairs for the 7 speakers (depending on the equipment) plus up to an additional 2-4 pairs for the pair of sub-woofers so in my projects I quickly used up over 30 pairs of banana plugs.<br /><br />I have used the [[ASIN:B003BKW2K2 Ocelot Banana Plugs, 24k Gold Plated Connectors, Open Screw Type, 12 Pair By Sewell]] as well as the plastic housing [[ASIN:B0001XGQSG Belkin PureAV Gold Banana Plugs (4-Pack)]] type of Banana plugs.  I much prefer the metal housing banana plugs. Between the Ocelet and these AmazonBasics I would lean towards the AmazonBasics ONLY due to the AmazonBasic plugs may be slightly less frustrating.  A couple of times as we were hanging speakers the Ocelet plugs banana tip swiveled enough to come loose - we had to ensure each was tightened snug.  The AmazonBasics are attached so no concerns of a loose connection affecting audio quality.affecting audio quality.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book. The only thing i  dont like about this book is how peeta is captured by the capitol
B0041KVZ0Y|5.0|I'm not going to go on a ramble about the musical impact of this album, as that is stated elsewhere. I remember when it came out originally, and remember how it struck me.<br /> I'm a mastering engineer and have mastered for LP many times, have been involved in all facets of the process for the last 30 years, and I'm a lifelong audiophile and musician beginning in the early/mid 60's that has learned a thing or two.<br />There has been a lot of controversy in regards to the pressing quality of these remastered LP's, mostly from those that bought the box set.  Rainbo, who is doing the pressing, does not have the best reputation for quality or consistency. If you get a bad pressing, just exchange it and chances are you'll get a good one.<br />I'm using a Technics SP15 broadcast/archivists table, with the Audio Technica AT12 tonearm, loaded with an Audio Technica AT13E cartridge with a hyper-elliptical stylus. This combination is very neutral and uncolored.<br />The first play had the occasional very light pops, but this was mostly due to static discharge. On the second play two days later, after hitting the record with the anti-stat gun and applying the carbon fiber brush, the disc had settled down and was dead quiet and definition improved greatly.<br /> As most audiophiles know (at least the old school variety), an LP won't sound it's best until after a few plays. But this record came to life on the second play!<br />The sound quality is quite lush, very warm, and it becomes very apparent to a trained ear that no limiting was used in the mastering process.<br /> For audiophiles; here is something that will outperform your old MFSL copies and Parlophone pressings.<br /> For none-audiophile record buyers; this will be a total waste for you just to play it on something like an ION, Crosley, or other cheesy record player. If this is what you use, go look for used copies of originals on ebay.<br /> For those that are mid-way between these extremes; if you have a decent stereo system, vintage or otherwise, you will definitely get some benefit.<br /> How does it compare to the remastered CD? The only honest difference is that some light limiting was used on the CD version (I don't know why, really) that actually is of benefit to the material, and it's absence on the LP version is marginally noticeable to the average person. The real difference will depend on how much your turntable or record player colors the sound.<br /> I had intended to buy Revolver first, (the first Beatle album I ever bought in the 60's, on a Capitol open reel tape no less) but it was out of stock. I have no regrets with this purchase and I am considering buying the box set, or I may just pick them up one at a time...Revolver would be next for me in that case.<br /> My final advice; don't get wrapped up in the whole digital vs. vinyl debacle. It is largely argued by non-engineers, and spleen venting know-nothings that have a belief system on both sides.<br /> These LP's were mastered from the remastered digital files. Not the same ones for the CD. The masters used were 44.1 kHz 24 bit. The purists argue that this is not the same as coming from the original flat master tapes. They're right; it isn't....it's better! Look to interviews with Sean Magee if you really want all the technical poop on this.<br /><br />UPDATE 4/24: I did do some analysis on the the LP vs. the CD. Many have accused the engineers of compressing the audio on the CD's. This is untrue. This point, or accusation, being made mostly by amateur engineers or audiophiles using a flawed methodology and incorrectly analyzing wave forms. EQ has more to do with densely packed wave forms than does compression. Your ear is the best compression detector, provided you do know what it sounds like. Many do not.<br />I recorded the album at 96 kHz 24 bit, and re-adjusted the EQ to match that of the CD, without any added processes, and the only difference in the wave forms was that the CD had about 1 db of limiting on some tracks. Just enough to take care of some pesky transients that would have been inaudible in any case.<br />Audibly, the LP is just a fraction more open.<br />Just an aside; I am amazed at the pitch accuracy of the old Neumann lathe at Abbey Road, not to mention that of my own SP15, as I could sync the tracks recorded from the LP to the CD tracks without any lag! A dead match in pitch, not to mention the awesome recorded quality. I can literally lay the files on top of each other without any mis-match in pitch.<br /> While it wasn't apparent at first, it appears that side A is a touch off center. I noticed the 'wow' when I began dubbing the album. A simple matter of adding a second platter mat to raise the LP above the spindle to allow centering, and an adjustment to my tonearm's VTA. An off-center pressing is not the end of the world, as it happens, (or used to) quite frequently.<br /> Bottom line; great music on LP or CD, and the best version of The Beatles catalog to date.<br />UPDATE 5/14/14<br />The lack of QC from Rainbo comes through again. After I had this for a few weeks, and it had only been played perhaps 6 times, there have been bubble ruptures in the vinyl! The first one happened to What Goes On, the first track on side two. I was playing it and suddenly there was a horrendous repeating pop for a few seconds. I stopped the turntable and examined the surface to find what looked like a gouge! My records are properly stored and handled and the only way one of my records would get scratched or gouge is if I fell while handling it! After a few minutes of fuming, I realized there had been a bubble near the surface that had burst.<br />OK, one defect. Then about two weeks later. another one burst in the middle of Nowhere Man!<br />When i fork over 25.00 for an LP, that is supposedly audiophile grade I shouldn't have to deal with manufacturing defects like this. I doubt I have any recourse at this point, but i am reconsidering spending anymore money on any of the LP reissues.<br />UPDATE June 22, 2015; I went ahead and bought the USB stick instead and have no regrets! (see my review). The 24 bit files on the Apple USB stick are essentially the same files used to cut the LP's, but for the LP, Sean Magee had to do some surgical processing in order to prevent over sibilant distortion in the inner bands. This is called 'de-essing', and on this album, i could hear it. Most notably on Run For Your Life.  On the files there is no processing of any kind.<br />The USB version is getting a bit scarce and going up in price, and i would strongly suggest investing in that over the stereo LP's.ing on some tracks.

B004YM6JLO|5.0|Why spend the money to see a really bad movie about teen vampires and werewolves when you can watch a much better acted, not to mention better looking cast in Vampire Diaries. In each episode of Vampire Dairies, you get 44 minutes of quality acting and action. In that bad movies series, you may get 10 minutes of a watchable movie.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I thought it was a good story. The acting was very well done and realistic, alcoholism is a touchy subject and I thought the movie was very true to the problems an alcoholic has with honesty.
B004LWZWGA|3.0|This movie was just okay...nothing great. Not worth the money to buy it. Acting was okay, Gary Oldman was the one bright spot as he is in most movies that he is in.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Really a good story.  It kept me hooked from beginning to end and I love that it wasn't predictable. A must read!
B0053O89IS|5.0|I have always liked Boreanaz since he played Angel. He shows wit and humor but also displays a real caring tough guy in his portrayal of Booth. Add to that the rest of the characters in the show and it is a pleasure to watch every week.
B005PK57NU|5.0|I'm totally hooked! I was introduced to this show when it was already deep into the second season.  I got caught up and can't believe I've been missing this. Now my husband is hooked.  You'll get hooked too! :)
0452257743|5.0|I wanted to read Rage, and this was as advertised.  All of the stories are very good, particularly considering that they are King's early work.
B005GI0NWQ|5.0|This is just such a fine collection of music that everybody should have it. It is uniquely american via africa and the british isles primarily, but a stew of influences that drives this roots music. Just so glad they wrapped a movie around this, both the old and the new recordings are stunning, you just can't go wrong with this. Loved the film too and the &#34;Soggy Bottom Mountain Boys&#34; are particularly charming, but Gillian Welch, John Hartford (RIP), and others are most welcome. Excellent production.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Historical fiction at its best Ken Follett is one of the greatest writer's of his time looking foward to book two.
B00B769XB8|4.0|Hansel & Gretel is a story about 2 young witch hunters who have grown into adulthood. The action was really good during this movie. For Hansel & Gretel to be big time witch hunters, they spent a great deal of time getting their butts kicked. The storyline is interesting especially when you find out how they began their journey of witch hunting. Once they start hunting one of the most notorious witches known to man, soon they find out more about their own past and how close they really are to the witches.<br /><br />This movie is very entertaining and the storyline keeps your attention. There is also some humor to the movie so you get a good laugh as well. Fun film to watch!

B000L53D4O|5.0|I bought this for my nephew to help him start walking. He loves it. It definitely helps him out a lot!
B008476HBM|5.0|If you never read it...read it. If you did read it...'re-read it because it will be twice as good. Men and women need time to explore each other like Elizabeth and Mr Darcy. Courting is a wonderful way of the past.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This app is much better than the first one I tried. It actually work and the game is fun. Graphics are good and game-play is addictive.This one is worth the effort.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game rules! At first it may seem boring but then u get new people and then u get better and WOW it's just awesome! :)
B0082RHRHC|4.0|I thought this story to be a romance before I read it, however it is more a story of the journey of an orphan and a commitment to God.
1616550414|5.0|This book is the pinnacle of Zelda books. It is a must have for any true Legend of Zelda fan.
B007PBKG5G|4.0|Alabama Shakes is the best thing ever to come from the great state of Alabama. Brittany is such an amazing singer and has the same incredible vocal talents as the late great Otis Redding...I don't invoke his name easily or lightly...The music is new old school and fierce and soulful!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|There is nothing I dislike about this show.  The storylines are creative and keep me interested.  It doesn't hurt that Anna Torv is easy on the eyes either.
B00280LYIC|5.0|It was an easy read and fun! The story really made you wonder... If the gods were around... Is this how It would be? And how great to make someone that we as a society consider unworthy into a hero!

B000W7JWUA|5.0|this game is so much fun. It requires interaction for trade and can make even the best of friends turn on each other for the sake of winning! great for college age!
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|The movie was suspenseful overall and the acting was ok, but the plot and sound effects were a bit contrived. I just couldn't believe the main protagonist in the film.
B007REV4YI|5.0|and in blu ray it doesnt get much better than this. I think these last three bonds have been what the world expected bond films to be like with modern film technology.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|This cord is very nice this is actually the second one of these I've had...the first broke within a month but I have young children who like to do crazy things with cords....I. love the length of the cord and the versatility of the cord I use it for my kindle touch and my cellphone..... This cord was the right price for a replacement.......
B00BETX5PS|5.0|This is definitely my favorite Bond movie....ever. I know, I know, Sean Connery was fantastic; for his time, definitely. Daniel Craig has definitely taken up the mantle and taken this role over the top. His 007 is exactly what I would expect of a British secret agent: impeccably dressed, rugged yet good looking, perpetually stony-faced, but with perfect wit and dry humor.<br /><br />M (Dame Judy Densch) is fabulous, holding her head up in spite of all the crap falling around her, and the suggestions of early retirement. Her relationship with Bond is so painfully evident in this movie, the sweet ending scene...sorry, all I can say without spoilers.<br /><br />Skyfall begins as most every Bond film does: the impossible car chase from which all but the good guys are dispatched. But it continues with more depth and a better, simpler story than previous movies. For me it had more overall feeling, revealing a bit more depth to the elusive Mr Bond. The beautiful girls are present and accounted for, as is the almost appealing villain, played creepily well by Javier Bardem. You can actually see his point, however skewed it may be, and almost empathize with him; how he might be right, how MI6 could be seen as immoral.<br /><br />Yes I enjoyed it, and I will see it again. Yes, there will be folks who will absolutely hate it, for reasons which could include the deviation from Bonds of old. But aren't movies just for fun anyway? If nothing else, you can look at attractive people, places you'll likely never visit, and some gorgeous cars :)
B00AZLBIAA|1.0|I don't like it. it doesn't work. Gives you the wrong codes so you can't ever lift on.... I don't know why I got it
B0091VGAXK|5.0|very very awesome movie  i have watched it 3 times alr4eady  love hearing  the good old music again  and the action  was very moving
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|I haven't had a chance to try it out yet, I'm still waiting for my camera to come in. But it looks awesome, it arrived promptly, and I can't wait to use it!.
B0063IH60K|5.0|easy to win. love love love this game.  able to pass the time.<br />this game is a lot of fun.
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|This is a good remake of a classic movie. I am going to buy.  Rent it. It is well worth it
B0091REZMW|3.0|I guess I don't really get the game.  I don't understand what the point of collecting coins is.  Probably won't stay on my Kindle for very long.
B009B8YZKS|4.0|Compliments the whole series of games and so impressed with the look and feel of the movie.  Definitely recommend for fans.
B0086700CM|4.0|It'll keep you entertained for quite a time.  Great graphics.  The kids love playing it, and I don't mind it myself.

B000SGGUWS|4.0|Not going to lie. I'm a little to old to be reading this but it was surprisingly good. Would recommend
B00APUQH0W|5.0|Loved it. Another feel good story about how sometimes the thing you're least looking for is staring you in the face.. all you have to do is reach out and grab it.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|This movie fired on all cylinders for me from start to finish. I really empathized with Ralph and his tribulations and all of the characters were fun to watch as they interacted. A great, great movie. Maybe not for everyone, but the right people will love it.
B004WGIXX4|3.0|Although this story has been told many times before, the chemistry between Ashton and Natalie was humorous and likable.<br /><br />I would recommend this for anyone looking for an easy going movie with laughter and a happy ending. :-)
0788859544|3.0|Great movie!  My favorite Disney. Unfortunately the disc were scratched and had to return. Return was quick and easy. Will try again and buy another DVD again soon.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Well done psychological thriller.  Kept me awake past my bedtime!  The perfect man is not what he seems.  Recommend it.

B0050PLT8W|5.0|Don't play the disk while attending your weekly National Organization of Women meeting unless you want to get to know real pain; on any U.S. college campus; or if you are employed by the Federal government.
B000B5XOY8|5.0|Love it, always a great classic.  This was a movie that my youngest son wanted as he is a huge batman fan and had to have this one to make his collection.  He of course loved it and watched in 3 times that day.... Thank you!

B004XQYBA2|5.0|I play sudoku a lot.  This one is a lot more intuitive than the 'free' games that are out there.  This will keep me entertained for hours and hours.  Thanks!
B004TJ1GVK|5.0|\\"Showgirls\\" is the most unintentionally hilarious movie ever made. Every single scene is a expensive, colorful, hilarious disaster of epic camp. Not everyone is going to get it, some people are just going to see the bad, and some see the bad and can't get enough of it. This is the most successful failure you'll ever see. The bluray looks wonderful, and the commentary is hilarious. Nothing brings friends together like a viewing of \\"Showgirls\\"!
B0094KTBT8|5.0|This was such a wonderful movie.  Classic Spielberg excellence.  Moving story.  Beautifully directed.  Worth every penny.  War Horse is truly awesome.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|A wonderful book to get lost in.  I felt like I was there the whole time. The best way to travel.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing is you know what I mean. I had to beg my mom for this game. go out today and buy is.
B005HEJ2DK|5.0|Capt. Archer faces tough moral questions in an epic battle to save mankind. Great special effects and lots of battles highlight the season. The season closely mirrors America's response to 9/11 attacks including bloodlust and torture, after a seemingly unprovoked attack by the Xindi on Earth.

0811874192|5.0|I have purchased 12 of these books and keep giving my own away when I see the need.  You can open this book and have a centerpiece for your table because the<br />elastic strap connected to the book holds your selection in place.  A variety of 3D floral arrangements pop up to delight young and old alike.  I gave Papaer Blossoms<br />to a friend in a rest home who did not have room to keep a lot of plants.  They are there to enjoy then close the book and hide them out of site. I have a collection of pop up book that are spectacular and this is one of my top two favorites.  It is fun to let children pick the bouquet of the day in the class room or at home. You can even<br />have students make drawings looking at these arrangements when fresh flowers are not available.
B008133MDK|5.0|Love the series!  I like them even better than the CBS tv series Elementary,  or the Mentalist, and can't wait to finish the season 2 shows...
1596434252|5.0|If I want to get the attention of every student in my class, I pull out my ABC 3D book and love watching the responses. There is so  much good design and ingenious creativity packed into each page.  Often I have one in the class and give out tickets when students are on time and on task  or work well in teams. At the end of the month, we'll  have a drawing for this book. It is amazing how the possibility of winning this unique book motivates students to do their best.  ABC 3D and Paper Blossoms are my two favorite Pop Up Books which please adults as well as children.

I saw this game and the reveiws were good and from my experience they were correct! This game is good for all ages but younger ages it would be kind of challenging. Its free so just check it out and rate it like i did. Hope this is helpful. :)

B004J4WKTW|5.0|The way Erin writes is simply elegant, I have for a long time relied on my own imagination to fill in the blanks for an author.  With The Night Circus,  unnecessary!  She needs no help when it comes to descriptions yet she doesn't weigh down the reader with unneeded fluff!The clock passage is A-mazing! I have a voracious appetite for books but none has made me feel the gambit of emotions like this book. I will add this to the top of my list for my favorite three books of all times!!

0142001104|4.0|I trust Seth Godin. Therefore, when he listed The Art of Possibility as one of ten must reads in 2013, I ordered a copy and was not disappointed.<br /><br />After recently reading Yes to the Mess, a book that promotes the use of jazz prinicples to innovate a business, The Art of Possibility uses classical music as a reference point for many of the principles and practices the authors recommend.<br /><br />My top 3 AHA's from the book are:<br />1. The authors performed a successful experiment I plan to use with staff. They told students at the beginning of the semester \\"To get an 'A' in the class, you (student) must write a letter postdated one year from the day written stating in detail what they accomplished during that year to get an 'A'.\\" I'm going to ask employees to do the same but telling me what they're going to do to deserve an top performance rating and raise.<br /><br />2. Ben asked an uninterested orchestra member \\"Can you conduct the orchestra for me so that I can stand in the back of the room to listen how it sounds?\\" It was a terrific, inspiring method of involving the person in a positive manner.<br /><br />3. If you define yourself as the gameboard instead of a chess piece, you can turn all your attention to what you want to see happen instead of what you need to do to win, fight or fix. Sounds like a useful perspective for our leaders in Washington, DC.<br /><br />Authors Roz and Ben Zander, influenced by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., make a powerful statement on page 163 that is so true in 2013: \\"This leader calls upon our passion rather than our fear.\\" I wish we had more leaders that did that, starting with me.

B004NOH9LC|3.0|What I liked was the absurdity of making the &#34;news&#34; more and more trivial and absurd to attract viewers and, of course, Diane Keaton and Harrison Ford were fun to watch.  What I didn't like was the predictable script  (Spoiler alert: the guy gets the gal and it DOES pay off to give your whole life to your work and to pretend to be positive in the face of impending catastrophe).
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game! I play it all day and I love it! Plus it doesn't require internet to play.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|At first you think it is just another teen love story between an unlikely pair but it turns in to an unexpected story of why they are destined to be together!  Cleverly done and I could never have guessed the plot...surprises at every chapter!
B007EECSFA|4.0|Warm and interesting story of love and life during  WW2.  Maybe you will be surprised by the resolution of the plot, I was not, but still enjoyed it very much.
B008JFUUQ2|1.0|Came used and completely scratched, one DVD was completely unusable. Totally disappointed! No way to send back, no phone number to call.
B0027REDK2|5.0|the extras are a nice touch, but i'm just happy to have all the mixes in one place. the hardbound cover is sleek, and the book has tons of pictures and graphics from malcom garrett. listening to the UK version of the album next to the carnival re-ixes is so interesting for longitime fans. you can hear the aspects that made the band more marketable in the US: louder guitars, more prominent drums. slicker vocals.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|Needs to end the story, it has gotten a little ridiculous. It really looks like nothing, but an effort to sell more books.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Fast suspense with international intrigue.  great movie!  I dont think most Americans know a lot about that time in history. It gave good historical info and was exciting
B007712XAU|5.0|I will add my cudo's to the millions who have made this series such a favorite. There's not much to add. I couldn't stop watching. It's so beautifully presented, and Dame Maggie Smith is an absolute delight. Holding my breath to Season 4.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|My opinion is that this is a great read. Is it a perfect book? No. But I really enjoyed it.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|My daughter told me this was a &#34;chick flick&#34; and a &#34;teeny bopper&#34; movie, so I wasn't anxious to watch it.  When I did finally watch it I felt that this is the best movie I've seen in a long time.  I got up at 5AM the next morning to order the Blu-ray and the book trilogy.  So far I've watched the movie twice and read the books twice, gaining new insights each time.  I highly recommend both.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|Recently, with much care and apparent guidance, the Spielberg film catalog is coming out on Blu-Ray. In the past few months we've really enjoyed how fantastic films like ET and Raiders look on Blu-Ray, and Schindler's List is no exception.<br /><br />The film restoration looks gorgeous, and even though the film is largely in black and white, the enhancements accentuate Kaminski's gorgeous cinematography. The Blu-Ray has sufficient grain to remind us of film but resolution that shows in the contrast of the blacks and the details of expression that we usually can see only on the big screen. I did have one pixelated moment with a movement of Embeth Davidtz' hand in one scene, but that was it.<br /><br />The performances stand out as fresh as they did 20 years ago - Fiennes is a revelation, Ben Kingsley is perfect, and Liam Neeson gives a performance of a lifetime. His final scene as he leaves the factory will reduce the most stoic among you to tears.<br /><br />When I first saw the film, like many I was overwhelmed by the story and imagery. On seeing it again, I was moved by the gentle humor, and the touches of beauty scattered throughout the film, courtesy of Zaillian's script and  Spielberg's heart.<br /><br />While Saving Private Ryan is a remarkable achievement in film-making, the story line always felt a bit cartoonish to me. Schindler's List is both masterful and moving,  intimate and complete.<br /><br />Absolutely worth owning as a Blu-Ray disc.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|Love this movie and the animation, colorful scenes and characters make it such a great family film! We well definitely be enjoying this one for a long time.
B0002NIRIC|4.0|I'm a stickler about clean strings. It's almost an obsession. I don't use coated strings and as we know, non-coated tend to tarnish and loose their sound quicker.<br />I actually have a clam-shell string cleaning device that clamps around the strings allowing for total surface access. I put this product into a small spray bottle, then a couple of shots on the clam-shell thingy = totally clean strings.<br />I've been using the Dunlop 65825 string care for over a year and while I don't apply it after every session, I'm yet to have any string corrosion.<br />It claims to: Extend playing life of strings, shield against tarnish and corrosion, deliver a silky smooth conditioning and eliminate finger squeaks.<br />I feel that it does all of that, but struggles a bit in the finger squeak area. Although it does suppress some of the squeaking.<br />When I run out (or shortly before) I will buy some more.
B0063M22QO|3.0|Love the game, but is not as challenging as the Windows version. Needs to have more tiles in layouts as well as tile choices.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|I'm really happy with this camera backpack.  It provides very simple, organized, and durable storage for my expensive camera, and the price was much less than others I considered.  Inside the main storage compartment are several customizable compartments that fit my EOS T4i, two lenses, and accessories with plenty of room to grow.  Time will tell how durable this backpack is, but I have no doubts it will last me for several years.  Great job with this backpack.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book was such great story! Very emotional and passionate! Amazing love story! A little too intense to be realistic though!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I liked that the personalities of the characters were able to pull together and become the &#34;team&#34; but still be quite individual. It's just fun and I like fun. I loved it when The Hulk got to &#34;smash&#34; and I could watch Thor all day.

B007CI81IQ|5.0|This wonderfully written book offers hope for those who want to make a tangible difference. Rather than relying on gut instincts and previously held beliefs, the authors take advantage of rigorous data collection and analysis to see what really works--and what doesn't--in fighting poverty.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It's the acting, acting, acting stupid. I have never seen such a finer example of the power of great acting. The effects are awsome, it is not lacking in that department, but what makes this work is the acting. And of couse the writing, which is always forgotten, I tip my hat. But what makes this exceptional series work is that most ancient of arts, acting. Only an actor can suspend reality and transport us to fantasy without a seam. I look at the simple scenes with a camera and two actors, and I understand the art. My God are they good in this series. The Gods have aligned for this one folks, It might just be better than the Soprano's or Breaking Bad. I'm not quite ready to commit to that statement, but to be honest I think I already have.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|It's an easy, quick read, but so far-fetched and contrived. Albom's other works are so much better. It is entertaining, but as I was reading it, I just kept rolling my eyes and thinking, &#34;seriously?! This is unreal.&#34;
B00127RAJY|3.0|I like this but my knees are not so great and this DVD is definitely harder on my knees than others. I prefer Zumba because of this. However, if you have normal knees and want a quick, easy-to-follow work out with results, then I would recommend it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I got season one for Christmas 2012.  After watching those 6 episodes i couldnt wait to watch the rest.  I got myself completely caught up in a month and now get to watch it weekly on tv.  I can't wait until Sunday nights now!  this show is amazing.
B00B3HJMLM|3.0|First things first - this is NOT a ‘brand new’ album from popular country singer Luke Bryan.  2013’s Spring Break: Here To Party is a compilation of a previous series of EP’s by Bryan (the Spring Break series).  Given the fact that many fans maybe/were unaware of the material from those EP’s, it seems logical for a album housing the material to be released.  Ultimately, it’s sound marketing, particularly following the major success of 2011‘s Tailgates & Tanlines. Spring Break is more guilty pleasure than substance, playing up the irresponsibility of college/youthfulness and often referencing beer and girls.<br /><br />Bryan shows his hipness on opener “Suntan City”, in which he sings such memorable lyrics like “Speakers were a bumpin’ / little hip-hop somethin’ / I was stirrin’ up a coke and crown…”  On the chorus, he goes on to reference his spring break itinerary on the beach, which involves sitting out in the sun, “watchin’ coconut-covered girls”, and having “a cold one in my hand”.  On the equally alluring sophomore cut “Just A Sip”, the energy remains high as Bryan urges his girl to “take a sip, just a sip / beer or whiskey if you’re with me, wet your lips...”  On the mid-tempo, humorous “Buzzkill”, Bryan complains of his party being crashed (“those beers might as well have been poured out…”) Neither of the first three cuts are filled with great substance - save for references to alcohol in all three - but they all are ‘guilty pleasures’.<br /><br />“If You Ain’t Here To Party” and “Little Bit Later On” continue to showcase Bryan’s goof-ball, care-free personality and humor.  On “If You Ain’t Here To Party”, Bryan suggests “knock a shot out / and get yourself in the zone” while on “Little Bit Later On” he isn’t shy that “we’re gonna drink up a lotta beer a little later on..”  Neither cut shows much range similar to its predecessors, but does fall short of earlier trio.<br /><br />Bryan atones with three notable cuts in “In Love With The Girl”, “Shore Thing”, and “Sorority Girl”.  “In Love With The Girl” benefits from its production - solid guitar riffs - as well as toning down the drinking.  He returns to his old ways on “Shore Things”, but aided by a lazy, bluesy countrified sound. “But it’s a shore thing / the sun will be shining / on my cold drink / and I’ll be lying / on a Miller Lite towel / havin’ happy hour / all day long in the sand / We may never sleep…cause it’s a shore thing / we’re getting tore down tonight,” he sings on the chorus.  “Sorority Girl” pays ode, going as far as to name every sorority Bryan can think of on the catchy and clever hook. Personality and charm truly make this trio of cuts successful.<br /><br />The remainder of the album has its ups and downs.  “Shake The Sand” proves less dynamic (a little too long/too similar), while “Love In A College Town” finely details the social scope of the collegiate experience (“I’m gonna fail this test / thinkin’ ‘bout your dress…”).  “Wild Weekend” raises eyebrows with memorable line “...Long as the keg don’t float and the ice don’t melt / we’ll loosen up a notch on the Bible Belt” while “Cold Beer Drinker” is just plumb simplistic. “Spring Break-Up” is also epitomizes youthful simplicity, dealing with a relationship built on the excesses of Spring Break.  The home-run might be the closing demo “Take My Drunk *** Home”.  Thoughtful or cerebral it isn’t, but it is fun, has some dirty words, and finds Bryan at his best contextually-speaking.<br /><br />The Verdict? Spring Break: Here To Party can be likened to dessert; it supplements the main course (Tailgates & Tanlines).  It is not an album for the intellectuals, but sure to play well to the base of which it focuses on - the collegiate/twenty-somethings (not that they’re not intellectual of course).  The question then is,will this care-free affair be remembered for years to come? It’s a rhetorically resounding NO.  Fun may not last for ever and likely neither will the tales of excess on Spring Break unless their the real life experience of college kids of course. But for now - at least temporarily, it’s a ‘shore thing’. 3 stars.will this care-free affair be remembered for years to come? It’s a rhetorically resounding NO.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I really like this game. I just got it a few hours ago and am on level 19. Have not bought any coins and will not. I am sure I don't know all about it yet but love it so far.
B00B7HQ1DA|5.0|I am an avid Boz fan and this album blows me away; smooth and bluesy. There are few white blues singers that get it right like he does. There are some songs that I'm familiar with and he just gives them a whole new feel. I'm just sorry I didn't realize when I purchased it yesterday that there is a deluxe version with a digital booklet and 2 more songs.
B008220DGE|1.0|I had such high hopes for this film. After just reading GOING CLEAR by Lawrence Wright, I knew the appeal of the cult of Scientology was tailor-made to be explored on film. But this film was a golden opportunity and an excellent cast wasted.<br /><br />This movie had no plot. None. It's a series of loosely connected vignettes. No one thinks, grows, changes, causes the audience to grow, think, or change. It's simply a mentally ill person shuffling around making a nuisance of himself and speaking in barely audible sentences.<br /><br />It demands nothing of the audience. Freddie is so pathetic and unsympathetic that we don't care if he lives, dies, or starts making out with The Master. Scientology attracts the strong, talented, and intelligent. Why not have a character like that as our protagonist and show him being seduced by The Master? Freddie would latch onto anyone who gave him a meal and some attention. This movie might as well have been set in a homeless shelter for all it addresses the appeal of cults and cult-leaders.<br /><br />Such a waste. Bad writing. Over-lit scenes. Slow pace with no payoff at the end for enduring the drudgery of a sad man being sad for two hours.<br /><br />Don't waste your time. Don't waste your money.
B002ZG98UA|5.0|I've heard about this movie being a good movie so I thought I might check it out and it is a good price
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|While I initially enjoyed playing this game, i found that that as the game progressed it began to lag. if you're going to create a game for a platform such as a kindle fire, be sure that your game can fit within the capabilities. I am so sick of delayed responses to my screen hits and dinosaur animations bogging down the whole game just so I can collect up some coins, especially since coin collecting is a routine part of the game.

B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie has enough happening to keep your interest during a long flight.  Well worth the rental.  The only issue was the long time it took to download, but that isn't the movie's fault!
B00013UTUM|1.0|I have purchased this cd three times from two different vendors. The fourth one is on the way. None of the cd's will play. The only thing that can be heard is a rythmic pulse that sounds like a brief note from the song. I've tried them on different computers. Everyone hears the same thing as me. Does anyone know if there was a bad production run on this cd? I'm dying to hear it. I've loved everything Muse has released. Help!
B00BHMF578|5.0|Great movie acting awesome!!!  The title threw me off but once you sit down and watch you are drawn to all the activity and drama
0062014536|2.0|Ouch!  It's tough to write this review, because Delirium and Pandemonium were such great books.  Requiem is disappointing.  Delirium and Pandemonium were built around great love stories set in a harsh society.  We still have a harsh society in Requiem, but the great love story is missing.  I'm not sure how that happened.  Coming into Requiem, we're set up with Lena, Alex and Julian.  How can you miss?  I don't like spoilers, but [*spoiler alert*] before you invest your money and time in this book you need to know that the great love triangle is not resolved at all.  We end up exactly where we began on page 1 of the book.  That's disappointing and kind of a cop out.  Had I known this was how it would end, I'm not sure I would have read the book.  The book tries to shift the main focus of the story from Lena and love to rebellion and freedom, but those themes were never the winning formula in Delirium and Pandemonium and they're not enough to carry the day in Requiem either.  However, having vented, the book is very well written and Lena's character is still compelling.  Similar to Pandemonium, the story alternates between two story lines.  As always, Lena narrates one, and the other is a separate story narrated by Hana.  The Hana story arc  is about half the book and I found it to be just okay and it kind of fizzles in the end, another victim of an unsatisfactory ending.
B00BHNR1KQ|1.0|This movie is terrible so predictable and boring.  The movie took place in 2 houses at least those are the only scenes in the movie.

B001BKG9SK|5.0|This is by far my favority solo album by any Pink Floyd member.  The DVD is a bonus.  I'm glad I bought the version with the concert.
B0089LOKHG|2.0|As many other reviewers have complained, I too was left so unsatisfied by the ending of this book. I thought it started out great, and the switching between Lena and Hanas perspective was interesting. But then, it just felt like she had to hurry and finish writing at the end. I felt she did not resolve the love triangle, what happened with Hana, or what the results were of the resistance storming Portland. I felt like the story ended a chapter or two prematurely, and that's disappointing because the first two books were so great.
B005K2LNZ4|1.0|Unfortunately I can only confirm earlier reviews that the music is stunning but the quality is horrible.<br />I also bought 'Lauging Stock' and it's just the same.<br />It sometimes sounds like the needle is full of dirt.<br />The Mark Hollis album sometimes sounds like recording equipment is clipping.<br /><br />I have a CD of both record so I know that the initial record quality is excellent.<br /><br />Very disappointing indeed.
B00030590I|5.0|I have seen numerous martial art films over the years and this one (Hero) is one of the better ones out on DVD.  As a lifetime student of numerous martial arts (Judo, Jujitsu, Karate, Kobudo, etc), I have loved seeing good Asian and other martial art films that also have a good story with the action.  This one (Hero) has a somewhat complex plot which actually makes it interesting to watch the story unfold.  If you are not used to seeing these Asian martial art movies, you could become confused in some parts of this video; nevertheless, it is a compelling and enchanting movie to watch.  Like many well-made Asian films, this one has many dazzling colorful scenes which makes this movie a pure visual joy to the senses.<br /><br />The story centers around a famous warrior and his desire to seek revenge against a dictatorial emperor, but as the story unfolds we discover the tale becomes much more complex.  The emperor and the no name warrior (Jet Li) play a cat and mouse game as the warrior relates his experience in killing the emperor's enemies.  The martial arts action is nothing short of fantastic and the story moves along quickly in each scene.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you like Asian martial arts films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, or the American made Kill Bill, you will enjoy this film.<br /><br />Rating:  5 Stars.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|4 stars are what it deserves , I liked the twist in the end ,not every one lives happily ever after
B007REV4T8|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed Daniel Craig as the sexy 'blonde Bond'! Though I grew up with Mr Moore as 007, he doesn't hold a candle to Craig! The 3rd installment in the new Bond saga have been as good as any made since Connery took his martini shaken not stirred. The action is spectacular and emotionally it is super charged with James being taken back to his home where his parents met their demise. The villain is played superbly by Javier Bardem and just thinking of his cold eyes gives me chills even now.<br />If you are a die hard fan then the choice is obvious. Buy this movie and enjoy the new Mr Bond and remember some of the old times as well. You won't be disappointed.<br />Also the song is the best since Carly Simon's \\"Nobody Does It Better\\" in 1977. Kudos to Adele for making a theme song cool again!

B00AB55BS0|5.0|At first I was skeptical about the show but the more I started to watch the more I enjoyed it. Each character is very unique and portrayed perfectly by the actors/actresses. The story is extremely compelling and there are no real main protagonist as the story is basically told from many different perspectives.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray itself.. at first it was stuck on the menu screen with no options to start the episodes. My Blu-ray player is pretty old but after resetting the software on the player it worked fine.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This was a great read. It's fun to get a first hand account. Kudos to the audience the author for his courage both in his service and in decision to write this book.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This has to be one of the best shows I've ever seen. It is well written, the acting is superb, the directing is magnificent and the story is compelling. I've recommended it to all of my friends and they've all enjoyed it.<br /><br />If you are having trouble watching the Blu-ray on your Blu-ray player, try resetting the software on your Blu-ray player to factory settings.

The multiple pockets gives me extra added room. The cushioned straps are also a plus when carrying all my gear. This is definitely a must buy!! I had a few friends look through my bag, they were so surprised how spacious the bag was containing all my camera gear. The AMAZON logo on the zippers is a good marketing gimmick for you guys, way to go!!<br />5 stars from me!!!

B008BM0IUG|3.0|The topic of sub-atomic particles is fascinating, especially the mysterious Higgs Boson, of which we have heard so much about in past years. Coming across this book, especially in light of recent verification of the Higgs' existence, seemed like an opportunity not to be missed. Sean Carroll has performed a great service to laymen such as myself, in helping to grasp some of what is going on under our very noses. Even though he does his best to put things in laymen terms, I still found myself becoming lost in particle soup, and had to put it aside about halfway through because it just became too much like cramming for an exam. I will pick it up later and resume, but a switch to some lighter fare is needed right now. Anyway, aside from helping the lay reader to grasp some of the more difficult concepts, Mr. Carroll provides a very interesting description of what goes on in the world of particle accelerators and colliders. For instance, who would have thought that it would require several tons of concrete and steel to arrest the travel of a few miniscule particles whizzing around in the HADRON accelerator? There's lots of good information waiting for those who can wade through the \\"ups,\\" the \\"downs,\\" the \\"strange\\" and the \\"Higgs\\". I can definitely recommend this book to the layman seeking to know what is going on at the sub-atomic level of our universe. My only other criticism is to wonder why so many physicists seem unable to acknowledge a greater intelligence at work in putting together the universe around us; some of which we can see, but most of it that we can not - or even envision. After all, there's so much that even these clever \\"reverse engineers\\" do not know, so why the arrogance in denying the existence of a Creator. After all, eternity is a fact, whether a Greater Intelligence exists or not.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|I liked this blue ray version of les miserables.<br />The earlier version was not blu-ray.<br />Great DVD at a very reasonable price.
0953104907|5.0|I sought out this book after having heard about it while lurking in the (pretty great) projectguitar.com forums; this book was touted as &#34;the Holy Grail of (electric) guitar building&#34;, and that seems pretty accurate, at least from the perspective of a beginner like me. I haven't read any other similar books, but after having read this one cover-to-cover before starting my first project guitar, I don't imagine I'll need another book...at least not yet.<br />Pros: easy to read; pretty funny; includes charts with standard measurements for many aspects of guitar building!; covers nearly every step of building an electric guitar; gives a very complete list of woodworking tools and specialty tools you will probably need<br />Cons: none that are obvious - the book doesn't go into as much detail for certain aspects of guitar building (finish/painting, for instance), but that's a whole process in-and-of-itself, isn't it?
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved it.  Couldn't put it down.  Choose this over James Patterson and I am happy I did.  Great book and wonderful characters.

If any of you readers out there are thinking about reading this book, but are having the same thoughts as I did...STOP THINKING. This book is so far fetched from a cliché teen romance. I have read every and I mean EVERY popular teen book out today (being a teenager and all) and no other book has moved me like this. Not even the end of the Hunger Games trilogy. I have never felt so strongly for any single book. I cried so hard for so long with this book that I had to put it down because I couldn't keep reading through the sting of my tears. Not only did I cry, but I LAUGHED and not just a chuckle. Books have never EVER made me cry so trust me when I say The Fault in Our Stars has taken me on an emotional rollercoaster that I will never stop riding.
037571457X|4.0|Easy read, emotional and leaves you hanging at the end. Looking forward to read the 2nd piece and learning more about this time in history.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It has almost every word that I would use. I use the dictionary a lot , so this really helps.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|While it is true that this is a great film for younger children, allow me to speak on behalf of the older generation.<br /><br />I'm a theatre major in college who has done many a script and character analysis. The biggest thing that sticks out for me is Jack's story.<br /><br />The way it is told is not the cheesy kid's movie cliche of, \\"Oh, woe is me! I must find where I belong even though it seems to the audience  that I already know who I am for the most part. But I'll act sad and longing anyway because that's what's needed for this plot line to carry forward.\\"<br /><br />This poor kid woke up out of the blue knowing NOTHING about himself and had to make up the rules as he went along for 400 years.  He had to live 400 years as a lonely soul who no one knew existed. And although he managed to make the most of it during that time, there was always a part of him that wondered why he got stuck in his situation in the first place. Only later, does he realize that the answer was always there to not only HOW he got where he was, but to his life before that he ever even knew existed! But just when he realizes he had a childhood, the answer gets taken away. OF COURSE he wants the truth! OF COURSE he'll be willing to fight for it. And then to finally be recognized by that little boy for the good he does in the world? Goddammit, that's gotta feel good.<br /><br />Pretty complex stuff for a kids movie.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|So suspenseful with a lot of twist and turns. Can't wait to read another one of her books. Must read.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Love the introduction to the Castor world and all the flashbacks weaved in to the civil war period.  This book far exceeded my expectations for young adult!
B004X2M9VY|3.0|The teaser is cute, but I thought I was going to view the episode. I guess a Dr. Who newbie might find the preview useful, but it wasn't clear from what I saw on my TV that this was a preview. So, I too watched it.

B00533NQLE|5.0|This is such an outstanding album in every way - some of the best singers,musicians,songwriting,arrangements- it is very special music that you can't describe, just labeling it symphonic metal,melodic metal or progressive metal - it should never be labeled, it is just great, I can't believe that anyone would hear this, no matter what genre of music they like and not see how great it is
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved this book I could not put it down. Truly shows how love conquerors all no matter what obstacles are in the way.
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|Just sorry we missed it in the theater.  Hopkins and Mirren are both exceptional actors and this movie is well worth your time
B004W1GCNC|5.0|love it! a great way to pass the time until the new season of downton abbey. very well done and much better than the original in the 1970's.
0345803485|3.0|I read the entire trilogy in about a week. I want to start by saying that the plot is actually pretty good; however, the \\"sex scenes\\" are too repetitive and boring. Anastasia peeks up at Christian through long lashes entirely too much while he strokes his chin with long fingers way more than the average person as he cocks his head to the side. Reading sentences like that over and over again are a bit irritating. It's almost as if she couldn't thing of anything else to bring to the reader's imagination. Enjoy!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is a wonderful true story of humanity, sacrifice, courage, and heroism on both sides of the conflict.  The interesting lesson for me is the distinction between the Nazi party member and nonparty German combatant.  We often assume they are all one-in-the-same.  Also the book explores the dilemna many German's had as the atrocities of the Nazis became known during the war.  Keep fighting for the Motherland despite this, or abandon the fight in protest, taking the risk of being shot as a traitor.  The chapters regarding the end of the war and subsequent years are also well-done.  Do you keep fighting for a hopeless cause and become a meaningless sacrifice or lay down you arms and go home?  It occurs to me that some of these same issues were prevalent in the Confederacy in 1865.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|This is the nth time I've read this book. It only gets better.  If you can read, you must read this book.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|I enjoyed this book for its unique look at demystifying how success occurs. I found the analysis of our education system as compared to others intriguing enough to somehow get involved as a change agent.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I liked this book and the characters.  The subject is serious but there is some nice humor in it.  The personalities are nicely drawn so you know just who they are.  You will find yourself trying to decide the end as you read it.  I would recommend it to my friends.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Somewhat interesting if not really introspective or challenging. But the war stories get a bit old about halfway through. But I guess that's what is to be expected.
B001ANSSDC|2.0|I  was very disappointed in this book.  It was such a big hit as a movie I expected so much more than it was.  I found it to be boring.
0547366205|5.0|This is one of the books I can recite from memory from reading it so often with my toddler. He loves the looking at the babies on each page and at the end he waits for the &#34;three little kisses on the tip of its nose&#34; every time. As he gets older, he will take from this book that all kids are pretty much the same no matter what they look like or where they are born. We will keep this one around for a long time, love it!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book,  alittle different I think than the movie...Both excellent,love stories. Heart warming. A good love story  for any age group.
B000MD9UJC|4.0|The shipper sent it fast. The item works as described but my only complaint is the switch button<br />stays a bit loose even after pressing on or off. It seems like it might need a better spring to keep it firm in place.<br />It beats always having to twist the head on or off for which you need two hands, but with the button its a one handed operation.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book  really helped me grow comfortable in my own skin. The way it outlines introversion and the strengths that are seen through it was helpful for me.  I  have since used some of the tactics in this book and them worked.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The is an awesome game and the best game I have ever played!I really recommend you getting this game get subway surfers now
B0055PGUYU|4.0|I really enjoyed the way this book was outlined. It didn't have the stereotypical body language information. It had some valuable information on studies.
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|Bruce Willis revives the role of NYC cop John McClane. He is missing his estranged son Jack (Jai Courtney). A report shows he is in a Moscow prison. John takes off to Moscow, only to find out his son works for the CIA and is trying to extract Yuri Komarov (Sebastian Koch) a Russian billionaire with a dossier on a fellow countryman everyone wants.<br /><br />The extraction fails, and John offers his unwanted assistance as a gear jammer, destroying nearly every vehicle that dared the streets of Moscow. At one point the carnage becomes too much, with a drive off an overpass scene that still has me scratching my head only to be topped by later improbable scenes. The humor in the film was hit and miss, with the miss being a cheap shot at Newark. Father and son are forced to work together which leads to the formulaic ending after a few twists.<br /><br />This is not the best film of the franchise. At one point I started singing \\"Cat's in the Cradle\\" as I realized this is supposed to be a transition film as Bruce Willis passes the baton off to an unconvincing Jai Courtney. Lots of action, if that is what you crave.<br /><br />Parental Guide: f-bomb, no sex or nudity.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|I really wanted to play this! But when I started to load it  it takes FOREVER to load then shuts down.... Kindle Fire users beware!!!!!!
B006XBSAP2|5.0|I am a huge Katy Perry fan and this cd has all of her hits on it and some...it has remixes and it has the new song &#34;wide awake&#34; on it.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I enjoyed this game and the story. I gave 4 stars because it was kinda pricey. I can't wait for a sequel.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|This book is amazing, I got this book from the library and loved it, the whole idea of this book is great and James Dashner made it work well. I read this book after I read the main series, it answers ally of the questions I had about the Maze Runner series. I wouldn't recommend reading this book until after you read the Maze Runner. I loved how James Dashner used the characters ans the prompt how he did I recommend this book to anyone who loved the Hunger Games.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|love the game. great fun,  graphics. look great.  the little girls voice in the backround adds to the the mystery of the game
B00881VLCE|4.0|I really enjoy this app quite a bit, as does my three year-old daughter. I really like the different piece sizes and the option to rotate the pieces or leave them right way around. This app has gotten my daughter interested in physical jigsaw puzzles as well!<br /><br />The option to display only edge pieces is wonderful. I don't have to sort manually! Although, that doesn't mean the puzzles are not challenging. With so many different packages from which to choose, one can load up on a great variety of puzzles. I like that the same Amazon account can use different puzzles packs between devices. This makes it a truly unique experience for each user.<br /><br />One downside that I find quite annoying, though. The pieces don't always slide when they are &quot;grabbed.&quot; The tray seems to have a &quot;dead zone&quot; where the app deesn't respond to any touch--sliding or grabbing.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Not enough non-gem purchases. Too many things have to be purchased with real money. Could be more fun too. Run out of energy way too quickly.

B003K16P3M|4.0|It is easy to follow and you really grow to like the characters. I enjoyed the book and look forward to reading the next two.
B008220DGE|5.0|For those of you looking for Boogie Nights 2, zero character study, and elementary rising action/climax/conclusion...don't waste your time.  This is a film that takes some thought and admiration for actors, directors and producers who are adventurous enough to create a picture that is a cut above mundane Hollywood drama.  I will proudly be placing this one next to There Will Be Blood on my movie shelf.  Five stars all the way.
B00846F1YW|2.0|First the good - hidden objects scenes were decent. The bad - story was jumbled, disjointed, and inconsistent. I like games that have at least some story and this was not one of them.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Very addictive! But great so far! The only thing that would make it better would be if it didn't continually tell me I have already updated so I won't have to update for a while...
B00BGDF1FO|5.0|This game is awesome. The music is awesome. If you want to listen to the music without playing the game, then buy this product.
B00BDRJ3Z2|2.0|I was excited for this, but it's terrible. There is not really a song on here I want to hear again. The last album I loved. So disappointing.
B0006N2EZ0|4.0|I Saw the movie years ago and ordered several CD's  upon Whitney's passing..so I ordered this along with the CD's...
B005IQZB14|5.0|Stark, beautiful depiction of the author's use of an arduous physical journey to construct a sense of self. Well worth the read.
B0002WZTOI|5.0|The adults in the family seemed to enjoy it a lot.  Not really geared for children, but I'm sure you already knew that.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Wow! What a great website for everyone.  I like the links for each idea or product.  Greatly reccomended for teachers.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|I bought this as a gift for a family member because they really liked it.  Once I sat down to watch it with them and I was plesantly surprised.  It's really pretty good.
B004PR71JC|4.0|This album is a good mix of the songs from the movie. It would have been nice if they had included some of the scores, but it is a good album.
B001TH16DI|5.0|I am not a Star Trek fan, but my husband is.  He loves it  and things that come in the whole set are always so much nicer.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|The book was great. Well defined characters, good descriptions about the past and present. Loved the suspense and the way it wrapped up to intrigue the reader to move on to the next book
B004Q7IAQE|1.0|My grandaughter loves hello kitty, but not this one.  I figured with it being so colorful it would be a huge hit.  We've had it over a year and she still hasn't taken it out of the bag.  Needless to say, we will be donating it soon in the hopes that some other kid will like it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy playing this game. I enjoy playing all kinds of card games. If you enjoy playing card games, you will like this game. :)
B000DWMYQ8|5.0|The movie is pretty good and the characters are adorable.  I was surprised by just how much everyone does like the movie.
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|I love getting the 3-1 package. It allows you to keep a copy at home with the blu ray. Travel with a copy with the DVD & download a digital copy which we put in iTunes & are able to let the kids pic what goes on their tablet before flying.
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|Everyone in the family from age 5 to 55, loved it.  I still haven't seen it, but I could hear the rest of them laughing at it while I was working on a project.
B00B3HJMLM|2.0|Luke I am sorry not a fan of the new CD. Hell every song is about getting screwed up drunk or about some 20 something.... There are fans who aren't 20 and in college... Maybe the next CD will be a little more appealing to anyone over 29 years old...
B005BGBPBG|5.0|Good movie. Good quality dvd. Arrive in a timely fashion. Packaged well including the cover. I was glad that this movie was made available via mp3 amazon.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It's was suspenseful and constantly kept me thinking.  I would highly recommend it and plan on reading the next Jack Reacher book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Rich characters and wonderful storytelling adorn this sci-fi masterpiece.  I'm &#34;hooked on Howey&#34;. The next series is waiting for me right now, so there is no more time for this.  If you're reading this review, stop now and start reading WOOL!!!
B004KAB5QO|5.0|A lovely gothic-style novella.  I enjoyed the story very much.  Susan Hill is a fine author and I enjoy her stories very much.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|As good as season 1 if not better. I love every single character. I cannot stop watching it over and over.
B000YAA68C|3.0|The gift of love even after death....recieved 2 discs...one widescreen and the other full-screen...nice to have the two options...one disc skipped....
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like having this game on my Kindle.  Have always liked Solitaire.  I would recommend this for the Kindle to others.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|Love all the books in this trilogy. The characters are great and it's hard to put the book down, would recommend to anyone who enjoyed the Hunger Games! Not particularly thrilled with how it ended but you can imagine how everyone ends up and I am glad I chose to read these books!
0307454568|3.0|This book is in the final one in the 'Millenium' series. The story continues on, straight after the explosive events, at the end of the earlier book, The Girl Who Played With Fire. However, like the previous book, I felt the story was a bit drawn out, and there were periods in the story were there was not much happening. The story could have been trimmed down. Overall, the series is quite good, though. The first book was my favourite.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|This game annoyed the living hell out of me. it never let me win, and when I did it froze up. took my keys and stupid bongo coins..and tried to kill my kindle. uninstalled. &gt;_&lt;
B002PGO7X8|5.0|KiD CuDi Does his thing on this album. Its been on repeat since being purchases over a month ago .
B001TCHDPS|5.0|His work reminds me a bit of Dylan and I am a big fan now of both of them.  Great.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|But I guess it's worth finding out what happens to them both... I just got pretty bored with it...and what should have taken me a week to finish took my 2 months because I literally had to force myself to read it.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Laugh out loud funny, just what I needed as a new working mom!  It was very entertaining and a quick read. Thanks Tina!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|My husband and I read this book years ago, and just recently I downloaded it to my Kindle, after seeing Dr. Chapman on the Oprah Network. I couldn't believe so many people had not heard of it! It's nice to read over and over. It helps to be reminded about what's important in a relationship. I not only know my husband's love languages, but my children's as well. And I give this book as wedding gifts to couples now. It's priceless!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book is like a risqué harlequin romance novel.<br /><br />The characters are predictable, and there is just enough of a story line to keep you reading.  It's a good book to take to the beach!
B00004XQ83|5.0|Ever since I saw the movie years ago, I have wanted this soundtrack, but never bought it. Well, at Christmas time, my co-worker gave me an Amazon online gift card, and there was my opportunity. I love riding around, listening to this old-timey music! It's great!
B00005QGAT|5.0|how can you go wrong with Michael Jackson. I had to replace old-skool albums in order to copy on computer and flash-drives
B004AP9W46|5.0|still reading it! Awesome book, and it has my favorite vampire as the main character ( Lestat) ! :)  I am trying to read all of her Vampire chronicles again in order.
B008LC8TJI|3.0|I heard the first three songs on the radio and really liked them so I bought the album.  Be warned......the rest of the songs are really not very good. They are short, all sound the same, and lack any sort of catchy beat and meaning.
B0087OXDDC|5.0|I loved Peter Gray book. It is the best source to learn about phrasal verbs I have found so far!
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Gameloft has amazed me once again this is a must have for your kindle. This is definitely five stars. Hey
B00AU15HPC|5.0|This album sounds exactly like what it is -- the product of five decades of brilliant songwriting. There's so much wonderful music here I can`t decide on a favorite track. Every melodic nuance, every ingenious chord modulation, every lyric, arrangement, and vocal inflection is so meticulously conceived and performed it's like looking through a window into the soul of a great artist.<br /><br />Way back in the earliest days of the Moody Blues, Justin Hayward called his music \\"a diary of my life\\". That description still applies, and as always, his chronicles somehow reflect our lives too. He charms us into his musical visions with that captivating voice and an artistic sensibility that's impossible to pigeonhole. Hayward is his own genre, flowing in and around all the musical impressions that fill his life. The rearranged Broken Dreams sounds just as haunting and plaintive with bluegrass musicians as without, simply because it's a brilliantly haunting and plaintive song. It's Cold Outside of Your Heart always had a country feel, and on this album, it came home to Nashville.<br /><br />The last two tracks on the album, the explosive, techno, dance crazed tunes called Out there Somewhere, aren't so much Hayward, as an homage to Hayward, composed by other, younger generation musicians who were inspired by Justin's Moody Blues masterpiece, I Know You're Out There Somewhere.<br /><br />All this rearranging and genre flexing is a lovely bonus. The nine new songs are the core of the album and one song in particular, Lazy Afternoon, should have come with a warning label. If you've ever found true love and lost it, this song will wring you dry. Lazy Afternoon has to be one of the most beautiful sad songs ever written. The rest of the tracks are just as satisfying in their own distinctive ways. Everything Hayward fans have been craving all these years. Personally, I'll happily wait fifteen years for another album of this quality. Because let's face it. Justin Hayward could pulllyrics from a phone book, sing the names down the chromatic scale, and still make it sound like a sonic orgasm. So, what the hell, I'll wait twenty years and play the album through my hearing aid. A few million other fans will join me. We all hope that Justin Hayward creates music to the very end, strumming the Lost Chord on his way to the other side.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|GOOD MOVIE , IT,S CHEARPER IN THE STORE, IF YOU WAIT FOR IT TO COME OUT, YOU GET BLUE RAY / DVD
B008220C38|1.0|I was so excited that when I heard that there was a new version of Anna Karenina. And I love Kira Knightley. So I bought this movie with out seeing it first. Which I should have. It was so disappointing! Rather than filming the movie on location they tried to get clever and film it as if you are watching a play .This might work with other story's but not with this one. It makes no sense and is extremely confusing and distracting. If I were someone who had never seen or read Anna Karenina then I would probably have no clue what was going on. I Only made it about fifteen minutes before I was so annoyed it turned it off. I think they were so focus on trying to make it different than the other Anna Karenina's that they missed the point and totally dropped the ball. So Disappointing.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Love this series, Howey gives us an alternative to the who, what, where and when of the future. The Silo series is wonderfully written and believable!
B005PK56TA|5.0|Best season Ever, good quality, HD without waiting. Is the first time I used Amazon vido to catch up with one Show, it worked perfectly.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Does what it says it does, keeps up with my charge and is super easy to read. Recommended for the Kindle Fire HD as you do not have to go though so many steps to check your charge.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best season Ever, good quality, HD without waiting. Is the Second time I used Amazon vido to catch up with one Show, it worked perfectly.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Love the connection but the app needs a bit of work. It is slow at times and does not just show a running list of who is doing what like on a regular computer. Back to the drawing boards for a little while guys. Needs a bit more, works keeps me in touch for most things but not realistic for day to day connecting. Need my laptop still for that.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|muy buen producto<br />todos debirian de comprar esto<br />se los recomiendo, es completamente excelente en tama&ntilde;o y calidad<br />envi&oacute; r&aacute;pido....
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the only game on my Kindle Fire HD at the current time and I play to pass the time whenever I drive someone to meetings or appointments. It makes waiting for family and friends to take care of their business less a chore and a much needed rest from a busy life!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|this game looked really amazing. I love the graphics, etc... but you have to wait so long to actually do anything and its hard to move up. it kinda hurts my feelings because id love to be able to play it more..!
1932735410|5.0|This is a great book that will help prepare you for your PMP certification.  It is the most recommended of all the PMP prep materials.  I am currently using it now to prepare for my test.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I can't tell you how much I love this game. I download other games play them for a little while but always come back to this game. There is one issue that drives me nuts. I first for this game from them google play store one my phone. Then I downloaded it from them amazon app store for my tablet . I would have thought they would be Then same but it is obvious they are not. Then one from google has a much smarter one touch play. For instance, say I am moving a nine and I have a row that is jack ten and a row that is king queen jack ten. Googles app will move it to the longer row everytime. With the app from amazon I never know. So I find myself doing it manually which is just more of a pain.
B001O1O71C|5.0|This book was nothing short of fantastic. I have not even seen the movie yet, but the book kept me entranced all day. I couldn't put it down.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is a good game, everyone sound play it! I fun playing it, and I hope that other people will.
B00005N6KG|5.0|We buy these for exercising. Once they are damaged, get out a new pair. The bass is good and I like the overall sound. I find in-ear headphones uncomfortable and tend to fall out easily.
B005ES0YKO|5.0|Love this product. Have always used croc, but first time with this type. Perfect for my need. I would highly recommended it to my friends.
B003O86FMW|2.0|I read all three of The Hunger Games books.  I realized while reading this one where we were headed.  One of my largest complaints about an author is that sometimes they seem to have a clever and innovative idea, but they lack the ability to &#34;finish&#34; a story properly.  For me, Stephen King fits that description.  Here again I think we have a wonderful author who writes a compelling story based on an exciting and controversial premise, but in the end just does not know where to go with it.  This book essentially copies the first book almost exactly, with the exception of a different twist ending.  After that, it becomes some sort of existential statement about &#34;fighting monsters&#34; and not becoming one, etc.  Sorry, but didn't like it.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I can only assume its going to get better, it has so far. Asking for the review so soon can be a bad thing.
B0067EKY7M|5.0|My wife and I loved this movie and wanted it in our collection.  Emily Blunt is lovely and my wife found the sheik (or whatever) quite attractive.  (Which is fine with me since I'm of Middle Eastern descent.  We have seen it in the theater and once so far on DVD.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My six year old loves this game. He treats the horse like it's a real pet. He makes sure it has lots of food and is healthy. Any one who loves horses will be sure to enjoy this game.
B0053O89U6|4.0|Modern Family is so funny, even the second or third, or fourth time around. You catch more jokes the more you watch it !
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think this app is really fun to play with it it a very helpful game to me that's what I think
B002Q7JYPC|1.0|For years I had suspected that the Frey/Henley combination was one that at it's best required inspiration and a catalyst from the outside; it appears that this collection proves my point. At first the catalyst was Leadon, then it was Felder, and lastly it was Walsh and Felder... but without the added fire (Joe's fire also seems to be but a flicker of its original flame) from any outside forces, the best these guys can produce is pablum. Save your money and buy the greatest hits. At least you can tap your foot to that.
B0012GMUSQ|5.0|I have loved AIC since they emerged in the early 90's. I have a friend who had the SAP album on cd. I could never find it to get a copy of my own and I finally just went where I knew I could get it....AMAZON.com!!!!!!
B008C20TDG|5.0|Great book, they seem to breakdown everything in regards to food, supplements and the avoid items. The science was great and informative.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|Our 2 1/2 year old thoroughly enjoys this puzzle game as well as its sister app with animal-themed puzzles. Perfectly suited to his interest, attention span, and ability at this stage. Wish there were more like this one!
B00000IZOR|5.0|I bought this for my grandson and he just luves it...Plays with it every day and it brought back many memories of the one I had for my children back in the 80&#34;s.......
B00AL1ONN8|3.0|I like T.I. I like all his previous albums, and this one is no different. And considering I got it at a discount, money well spent.
B004JN1CW4|4.0|It's one of the bests trilogy ever! I laughed, cried and got worry with all the characters.... at any situation...... I really recommend this story. Can't wait to seeing Hollywood make it into the screen.
B00ADYYY50|3.0|&#34;Let it Go&#34; is dope. The album over all is ok. I like it, but I like Wiz's music. I don't like this album as much as his previous work, but it's good.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I'll say all the expected things - couldn't put it down, stayed up til 3 am to finish it. Can't wait to read her next book.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Few books have brought me to tears...this is one. I particularly enjoyed not knowing where the story was going to take me. I truly had no idea what way it would turn out. I have to say that I am satisfied.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app its so fun and cool le best app ever. I love that they did Rio because that's my favorite movie and now they are doing Rome which is where the plot is in the mark of Athena Percy Jackson book and they now have Easter eggs and I love Easter so its like they made the app just for me! this is the best app ever please get it its the beet ever you wont regret getting it seriously. you go around jumping side to side trying to avoid trains its sort of like temple run but subway suffers is better even better then temple run 2. the developers are beet because they update it monthly in different places that I all like and I like to travel! anyways its so cool there's different powerups except the power ups in temple run are worse but these power ups are the best ever because u can have s chance of the jetpack that shoots rainbows that is really awesome and u get to skip part of the track and the more u upgrade that powerhouse the longer it goes for (like any other power up u upgrade) and there's super jump boots and it makes u jump high and there's 2x power up which means double coins and there's skateboard but its actually a hoverboard like in back to the future and I also like back to the future so like they made it for me! thanx so much because I love this app EVERYONE GET IT ITS SOOOO AWESOME!!!!
B002FE5XVK|5.0|Well if you are Talking Heads fan the I absolutely have to say that this is a must see dvd.  David Byrne's energy is off the charts.  I used to wonder how it was that they ever opened up for the Dead Kennedy's but now I understand.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Nothing at all what I expected. JK keeps you entertained and for me was a much better read then Harry Potter.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|This has to be one of the best show on tv.  Definitely worth the purchase price and adding to your collection.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I would have liked it better if I were still in high school. Young love. I did recommend it to my 20 year old niece. She'll love it.
B009PAETCG|5.0|the only reason why I put a five star is because it says if u give this a five star rating more updates will come also I would give a four or three in a half star rating if it wasn't for that the reason why is because in the game the only way you can have more fun than what it gives you is if u spend way to much money for what is worth. besides this I think its a fun game that you can play anywhere
B009ANP4F4|4.0|The storyline is not as bad as you'd think. Haven't seen the other movies in the series, but my daughter loves the flic. Adding Peter Gallagher was a master stroke - and regardless of what your cup of tea is regarding dance - there are so amazing dance scenes (the business suits)!!!
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Bond movie, great as always, preferred this one to the last two, streaming on Amazon instant video was flawless, quality great!
B001OMJGD0|1.0|I tried to watch using Airplay on my iPad to watch Superman Returns my home enterainment system. But I can only can watch on iPad because Amazon doesn't support airplay on iPhone, iPads and iPods.
B001HQZJPM|5.0|This is really the story of two people who meet and fall in love in the Mummy.  They marry and have a precocious child in the Mummy Returns.  Their son follows in their archaeological footsteps as a adult in the Dragon Emperor.<br /><br />So mummies impact this family's dynamics.  The parents are eventually estranged from their son, but reconcile in the Dragon Emperor.<br /><br />Mummies and what they do are horrible, but they also enable these three people to become a &#34;family&#34;.<br /><br />Each of these movies also has a 'behind the scenes' disc which explain how the special affects were made and how the actors interacted with things that did not exist.  Just watching them is worthwhile in themselves.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is a very fun app with very realistic graphics! i havent been able to stop playing this game as it better than some computer games i own!
B001NLKT60|4.0|Some of the coincidences in this one were a little harder to believe than in the first book (Girl with the Dragon Tatto), but still an action-packed mystery that definitely held my interest.

B000SEGUDE|5.0|Beautiful book, the stories are amasing, I enjoyed the change of times and charancters, I spend 4 days to read it all, I f you enjoy science fiction you will love this book
B00008J2PG|5.0|When this started, I didn't think it was going to be so great.  HOWEVER, I was mistaken!  This is a super great movie, and Greg Peck and Sir John Gilguid (as Pope) very terrific in their roles.  Also, the thin Italian Cardinal or whoever he was, Really ticked me off with his attitude, but it was as it Should have Been!  Ha.  In any event, this is next in place as a favorite of mine to the Shoes of the Fisherman, Shoes being best in my opinion, but this one next.  Especially great were the plots where the Irish Priest (Peck) outwitted the German Gestapo.  All in all, I would recommend this movie to anyone.  It certainly carries a potent message.<br />Cecy Ivie
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Cute, fun game. Can be a little glitchy at times especially when using the &quot;free gems&quot; options. Would also be good if users handcuffs ability to friend users they don't personally know.
B00AL1ONN8|5.0|TI did a great job on this album! You can put this album in and let it play! Glad he went back to the old Tl!
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|This is a must see for anyone who has an interest or knowledge of politics. It is probably cheeper to watch it on netflix tho.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|Great actors but a dull, plodding story line.  I was sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for it to end.
B000065DWH|5.0|This is the album that first got pre-Hollywood Randy Newman widely noticed. Only for those capable of understanding irony and reflection. \\"Rednecks\\" is the most famous cut here and is one of the sharpest critiques of racism ever recorded. He skewers Southern attitudes then turns it around to the rest of the country and holds up a mirror so they can see their own hypocrasy. Often simple musically but always hits just the right note.<br /><br />I highly recommend getting the deluxe edition which includes \\"Johnny Cutler's Birthday\\", the original themed demo that \\"Good Old Boys\\" evolved from.
B009BJAZBA|5.0|I loved&#34; Downton Abbey&#34; so I watched the first 2 seasons of the 1971 &#34;Upstairs Downstairs&#34; when this caught my eye and I tried it - NOT disappointed. I love that they use some of the original cast to carry on the story of 165 Eaton Place. My big disappointment is that there are only 3 episodes and Season 2 isn't available for free at this time.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|In keeping with the series of books, this rendition of a book to screen is pretty well done.  I like Tommy Lee Jones in just about everything, because it isn't pretentious.  His acting is from the gut, not from the head like some.  Enjoyable who-dunnit.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I don't think I have ever enjoyed non-fiction so much.  While I thought I had a general understanding of Lincoln from school, I didn't begin to appreciate what an incredible human being he was.  This book has helped me to better understand the man, his place in history, and the pivotal time in our nation's history in which he lived and served.

B00A7OIXW6|5.0|This is the most enjoyable animated movie Disney has made since they switched from traditional 2D animation to CGI. As a long time gamer and a dad, there is a lot to like about Wreck-It Ralph. There are references and in-jokes galore that will delight gamers, and plenty of colorful and fun characters that will delight children of all ages. The story itself is very well done, too. I genuinely liked and cared about all the characters. The animation is some of the best I've seen from Disney, and I really like that each character and world has it's own look and style. Characters from an 8-bit game move and act differently than characters from a next-gen HD game. Every moment in Wreck-It Ralph is filled with the kind of attention to detail that comes from a genuine love of your work, and it's clear this crew loved making this movie.    The thing that surprised me about Wreck-It Ralph is that the story is so engaging, and there were a few twists and surprises that I didn't see coming. The movie has heart, and it doesn't feel shoehorned in. I was also happy to see that the nerdy game references were accurate. As a gamer, it's annoying to see movies that attempt to make references to video games, but fail. Even if you're not a gamer, the movie is still great, and the story is solid enough that anyone can enjoy it, gamer or not. The music is perfect, with a mix of chip-tunes, orchestral, techno, and generally video game appropriate music. The voice acting is also great, with all the actors fitting the roles well. Sometimes celebrity voices sound out of place (like Adam Sandler in Hotel Transylvania), but that's not the case here.    The Blu-ray looks fantastic. The images are crisp, the details sharp. The color is vivid without feeling over-saturated. Of all the Blu-rays I've seen, Disney Blu-rays have always looked the best. The sound is in 7.1 HD Master audio, and although I don't have a 7.1 system, I do have a nice external 2.0 stereo system, and it sounds great. Everything is clear, and all the dialogue is audible. One thing I don't like is Blu-rays that have a really wide mix, where music and loud sound effects are 100x louder than the dialogue. Here, the mix is fantastic, and the quiet parts are never too quiet, and the loud parts are never deafeningly loud. I'd give the audio/video of this Blu-ray an A+.    One thing I would have liked to see is more special features. There is a short \\"making of\\" feature where they talk about the challenges of creating distinct world for each of the games in the movie, and a little bit about designing the characters, but there is no mention of the voice cast, and no coverage of the fantastic music. If you pause the movie, an \\"intermission\\" features starts that tells you about little hidden \\"easter eggs\\" in the movie, hosted by gaming nerd Chris Hardwick. This is probably my favorite, as I am a fan of Hardwick's. There's also the short film \\"Paperman\\", which is beautiful, and won an Oscar. Beyond that, there's just the usual trailers and crap. I would have liked to see more in-depth features covering more aspects of making the movie, but maybe I'm just being greedy. Overall, what is here, the movie and the special features, is solid and is well worth your money.    In short, go buy this movie. It is fantastic, and I can't think of a single reason you won't like it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I thought is was a good book and I did not think there were any boring parts.  I  would recommend it to any reader.

B003L77G06|5.0|MODERN FAMILY's second season is as delightful as it's first.  All the endearing family members become more 'real' as they show the heart and soul of today's blended family in often bizzare, but relateable situations.  The DVD set itself arrived on time, factory sealed and at a great price.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|One if the best books I have read in years...simply a classic novel that 30 years from now will still be talked about.  Bravo.
B009LDCZDC|5.0|The second season of the critically-acclaimed \\"Homeland\\" had a lot to live up to. The first season had a raw and frenetic intensity that was missing from television and delivered outstanding performances from it's lead cast. I know I, for one, was worried about what the second season would bring, simply because the first season was so good. I'm happy to report that my worries were unwarranted and so should anyone else's.<br /><br />The thing I love about this show so much is that it keeps me guessing. Most shows on TV today follow a similar formula in which the audience can see what's going to happen long before it ever does. Any big reveals or surprises turn into moments that you wish had been presented earlier so the show could bring you something new. \\"Homeland\\" turns this idea upside down and throws it out the window. Like the season before it, this second season contains multiple big surprises and I mean QUICK. You won't have to wade through various episodes of filler for things to start happening; it starts out with a bang and doesn't let up.<br /><br />Claire Danes and Damian Lewis are sensational in this show and are more than deserving of the recognition they've receives for their roles. Carrie, played by Danes, is slowly transitioning back into a life of normalcy when a familiar threat rears it's ugly head and drags her back into the world of terrorism and espionage. Brody, played flawlessly by Lewis, has a much larger role this season as he's forced to face the consequences of the decisions he's made since being rescued as a POW for eight years. Another high note from the season is Mandy Patinkin in his continued role as veteran CIA analyst Saul Berenson. I really felt like he deserved more screen time in the first season and was ecstatic that he get's just that here. Honestly the entire cast is great and it would take a much longer review to point out what I loved about each member of it. Suffice to say the characters, and the actors that play them, are as good as ever.<br /><br />If you're like me and you have reservations about how this show can continue it's run as one of the finest on television, heed my words and trust me when I say that this season delivers. It may not be as great as it's predecessor, simply because the first season took everyone by surprise, but it comes pretty close.as good as ever.<br /><br />If you're like me and you have reservations about how this show can continue it's run as one of the finest on television, heed my words and trust me when I say that this season delivers.

0812992784|4.0|The book is way too long, full of anecdotes that could easily be dropped without loss. But, then I think that for Salman Rushdie these small seemingly insignificant portraits of his life had taken on an importance because of the cloud under which he lived. So, I recommend you excuse the excess and instead relish his story, the fight against freedom of speech, the support of his literary and protector community, and the insight into a writer's thinking and the evolution of the ideas into a published work. I copied whole paragraphs to share with friends. I reread descriptions. I made a list of books by authors Rushdie introduced me to through his life story. I plan to purchase my own copy and that of his three other most prominent works because, although known for the fatwa, his legacy should be his phenomenal writing talent.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This product is very fun but also educational because kids will understand that if you do something bad like graffiti, you can run but the police will eventually get you and you will be arrested and charged for ruining property. I recommend you get this game to give your child education and discipline or simply just to enjoy running away from the cops.

B007R3AZNK|5.0|I am a relatively new fan of Joe and this is the second CD of his that I have. I enjoy it tremendously, especially when he rips into a solo that is both vicious and sexy at the same time. Well worth the purchase. I am a big blues fan, specially electric guitar blues like Stevie Ray, Tinsley Ellis, Jimmy Thackery & the Drivers, Buddy Guy, and others like them. Joe fits right into my wheelhouse. I especially feel the title of the CD is appropriate for me because I am quite ill and on the mend, and am 'Driving Towards The Daylight'. myself. This CD is played a lot on my i-Phone!

B004S3MB2U|5.0|This is the most powerful calculator app I have ever seen. It offers so many modes of operation that it is mind boggling when you consider all of the applications that you can do with it. It features calculators for the following functions:<br /><br />* General<br />* Scientific<br />* Financial<br />* Statistical<br />* Date and Time<br />* Programmer<br />* Length, Area, Speed<br />* Volume, Weight, Temperature<br /><br />This is a fantastic tool for those who require these types of calculations and it is ideal for a college student in one of the many fields that would require these types of mathematical operations. As an engineer I had to work with trigonometry and logarithms daily this type of calculator would have been invaluable.<br /><br />This calculator fits the needs of an engineer, financial advisor, programmer and it also does conversions for length, area, speed, volume, weight and temperature from English to metric units. It works in binary, octal, hexadecimal and decimal math and even has Boolean logic functions.<br /><br />If you are in the need for a good and powerful calculator then this is a good one to look at. The only two downsides that I can see are that even the Simple screen may to too confusing for some people and it probably should have gone into the really simple mode for easier use and larger keys. The other is that the price is $9.99 which may turn some people off. That seems high but in reality it is not for all of this functionality. My first scientific calculator was over $250 and it didn't do 1/10 of what this calculator app does.<br /><br />This is a good app and deserves 5 stars. If you are going to college then grab this app up while it is a free app of the day. Even if you have to pay for it then it is still a good deal. It also does not feature any ads built in.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|This is probably one of my favorites because of how they worked this with so little dialog. Some found that part irritating but not me.

Some ages may have a number of questions as to what is going on but otherwise good clean family fun.

This one has the actor that us to be in the &#34;Mac and PC&#34; commercials &#34;Justin Long&#34;. He and Bruce Willis make an excellent team.  Not many movies can make one jump in surprise.

Catching Fire!

B00942Y6WI|5.0|This movie is set in 1960s Jackson, Mississippi and tells the story of an aspiring young Southern journalist who wants to tell what it is like to work as a housemaid/domestic helper from the black woman's perspective. Skeeter, whose friends are busy spending their days in a privileged world of playing bridge, serving in the Junior League, and entertaining, wants nothing more than to gain experience as a writer so she can go to New York and work for a large publishing company. Skeeter's friends are married and living in their perfect world of owning the right house, in the right neighborhood, having babies, and depending on their black maids to do the work of raising their children, cleaning their homes, doing their shopping and cooking their meals. Skeeter doesn't date or have a boyfriend; her goal is to become a writer, which is an embarrassment to her mother, and scandalous to her friends. Despite the times, Skeeter has a deep sense of how wrong the blacks are treated and she is both liked and respected by those who work for her own family as well as those who work for her friends. This is not the case with the snobby Miss Hilly and Miss Elizabeth, who both view their maids as less than human because they are black. Miss Hilly draws up an initiative to require all households who employ black help to build a special toilet for them because \\"they carry different diseases from us\\". This was a time when blacks were prohibited from using the same public toilets as whites, and were also forbidden from drinking from the same water fountain, as well as many other discriminatory practices that made Mississippi such a shameful bastion of racial segregation and discrimination.<br /><br />Aibileen and Minnie are the two maids that work for Miss Elizabeth and Miss Hilly, and are best friends who share their personal sorrows with each other. After Miss Hilly catches Minnie in her bathroom during a violent thunderstorm that prevents her from going outside to use the toilet, she fires Minnie and spreads lies that will insure Minnie is unable to find employment anywhere else in town. Aibileen tells Minnie that Celia Foote, an outcast from Hilly's social circle, and the woman who is married to Hilly's past boyfriend, is looking for help. Minnie, desperate for a job to support her children, swallows her pride and goes to work for Celia. It turns out Celia lives in a huge old mansion that her husband's family have owned for generations. She is a simple and sweet girl raised on the wrong side of the tracks who wants nothing more than to find a place in the world her husband was born into. She accepts Minnie as an equal, something that immediately raises Minnie's suspicions because of the prevailing racial prejudices in the Deep South against blacks. Both of them being outcasts from the circle of the Miss Hilly's world, and with reputations that are tarnished by Miss Hilly, they forge a bond slowly that will benefit them both in unique ways.<br /><br />Aibileen is approached by Skeeter to tell what it is like to work as a maid and, although at first resistant to the idea, she reluctantly begins to open up about the things she has experienced over many years working in the homes of white women and raising their children. It is a dangerous thing for both Skeeter and Aibileen in the climate of racial prejudice that exists, and they must keep their project secret. Skeeter has promised that she will never use Aibileen's real name, nor her own as the writer, and encourages Aibileen to see if Minnie might be willing to also tell of her perspective as to what it has been like to work as a maid for white families. Minnie is bitter over what she has suffered at the hands of the cruel Hilly, and grudgingly agrees to share as long as her name isn't used. Before long their trust in Skeeter and the years of resentment they have felt over their treatment leads Aibileen and Minnie to give up the secrets of the white women of Jackson as Skeeter sympathetically listens and pens their stories for a book titled \\"The Help\\".<br /><br />Minnie's desire to get revenge on Hilly leads her to carry out an act she calls \\"the terrible awful\\", something that is so outrageous that she is ashamed to ever tell anyone what she has done. It also is hilarious, and Hilly's slightly senile and forgetful mother witnesses it and laughs uproariously at Minnie's revenge, but this leads Hilly to put her mother in a nursing home because she is afraid she will tell everyone in town what happened and make her the laughing stock of Jackson. Eventually when racial tensions and injustices, including the murder of Medgar Evers, lead to the brutal treatment of one of the maids in Jackson, it serves as the catalyst that encourages the other maids of Jackson to open up to Skeeter about the way they have been treated over the years while working for white families, and they agree to spill their secrets, some of which are terribly sad, some of which are bittersweet, some of which are hilarious, and some of which are damning for the white families. Minnie tells Aibileen about \\"the terrible awful\\" she did to Miss Hilly and each maid knows that they have \\"insurance\\" to protect them since Miss Hilly would never let anyone believe the stories are set in Jackson once they are published, because Minnie's story of \\"the terrible awful\\", which is included in the many stories that will come to be told in \\"The Help\\", would make Hilly the joke of Jackson if anyone ever knew what Minnie did to her. As their stories are written, Skeeter prepares to include her own story of Constantine, the black maid who raised her from infancy, and how Skeeter's mother betrayed the loyalty and love Constantine had for the Phelan family, especially for Skeeter.<br /><br />Once finished and sent off to the publishing house in New York, the manuscript is hastily published to coincide with Dr. Martin Luther King's march on Washington, something that will bring the civil rights movement to the forefront of America as the struggle for racial equality tears at the fabric of the Old South, revealing the humiliating treatment of blacks which has been kept largely untold in other parts of the country.<br /><br />Skeeter's book comes at a time ripe for the telling. Once it hits stores in Jackson, everyone is buying it and wondering where the stories were originated because they seem to divulge things that fit with events among Jackson's white families although no mention is made of the author (simply \\"anonymous\\") or the town where the stories took place. As more and more interest in the book develops, Hilly buys it and when she reads about \\"the terrible awful\\" she knows Skeeter has written the book, but she tells everyone the book can't possibly be about Jackson. She confronts Skeeter about the book but Skeeter stands her ground and tells Hilly she can't prove anything, and Hilly can't - unless she wants to make herself and every other white family in her social circle look bad and expose the secrets which they had assumed would always be safe in the climate of white superiority, where the lives of their black maids could be ruined for the slightest reason. Now everything has changed and the tables have turned!<br /><br />Finally, Celia Foote decides to make an appearance at the annual Christmas Junior League gala so she can tell Miss Hilly that she never stole away her old boyfriend, because she believes this is why Miss Hilly hates her and has deliberately excluded her from being in the Junior League and the circle of wealthy white women that form Hilly and Elizabeth's coterie of friends. Little does she realize that she is about to make herself look like a fool among the snobby women of Jackson, even though she is married to the influential son of an old monied family. She is also about to discover that she will never be accepted, even if she tries to tell Hilly of her innocence in Hilly's breakup with Johnny. Although it makes for a sad and yet funny scene, the wheels are set in motion for everything to change as the The Help's stories circulate among Jackson's citizens and expose the terrible secrets and the injustices toward blacks that have been buried in secrecy for so long<br /><br />Throughout the movie are moments of extreme hilarity and moments of great sadness as the story unfolds, but the ending is one that provides redemption for Skeeter, Aibileen, Minnie, and even Celia Foote. The strength and empowerment that comes to those who have never known anything but powerlessness is the redemption, and the beginning of hope for a better life in the changing times of the civil rights movement.<br /><br />Having grown up as a white child in the South during the time this story takes place, I remember so vividly how racial segregation was - the signs that separated the use of public facilities for blacks and whites, as well as a time when blacks were not allowed to ride anywhere except the back of buses. It is a time that is burned into my mind and makes me deeply ashamed of the degrading treatment blacks suffered at the hands of whites. Even as a child, I remember the downcast eyes and the role of subservience that defined how blacks were expected to behave in the presence of whites. There is no exaggeration in this book as to the black experience in the Deep South. The ending of the movie was so uplifting as I'm The Living Proof is sung by Mary J. Blige! It is simply a marvelous movie.

B009A9BFBK|4.0|Linkin Park returns to the tecniques that made them great with this album.  The sound seemsmature and sophisticated, as is usual for this band.  I do nto hear the same level of energy as in their eaelier albums, and it would be difficult for anything to top Meteora, but at the same time I do perceive a new level of comfort with their sound and their message.  I was skeptical at first, thinking that this album's return to a more familiar sound style was just the band printing money, but they continue to create great music.<br /><br />The LP is white, which is eye catching but has no impact on the sound.  I was disappointed to find only a small amount of art - the same crumpled paper graphic you see on the website in 9x9 form.  There was no digital download, so if you want the good sound for your home system and the digits for your car/iPod you'll have to pay twice.
B00AO2P3GA|2.0|Decent for mobile platform I suppose... A lot of super speed hacks in multiplayer and people can kill with melee way too easily. Many pay for credits to buy better weapons, but it takes way too long to save up playing legit. ex: 250 credits per game and decent guns cost 40,000. Its not like PC or platform games, controls are difficult and unnatural. Can be laggy in single player on Kindle Fire.

1609611543|5.0|I was constantly getting sick, ear infections, skin break outs,  colds, allergies and my weight kept creeping further up, something had to give.  So I bought this book, and I have to say something clicked.  My skin has cleared up, it really is glowing.  My ear infections....gone.  When others came down with the flu in my house, NOT ME!  I dropped 10 pounds in the first month after cutting out gluten, and I never counted one calorie.  The second month,  another 10 pounds melted off, once again I never counted calories,  and I also realized  I did not get cravings either!  I had to remind myself at lunch time to stop and eat, my normal hunger pangs during lunch time just go not happen any more.  I did not realize  I had been dropping weight, until my daughter told me my face was thinner.  I tried on a pair of pants that two month months earlier I could not even button,  the gap was about 3 fingers wide, but when I put them on that day.....they buttoned easily.. So I have transform.ed my kitchen and pantry, and my whole family has dropped weight.  At first my girls fussed, but not any more, and yes they have dropped weight as well. The one thing my youngest daughter mentioned to me the other day was her homework was easier to do, no more struggling !!!.  I too have noticed the brain fog has gone away.  We have more energy as well.<br />I also have recommended this book to family and friends, it would make a great gift to anyone you care about.
B004HYDM0A|4.0|Just like many others I'm sure I was slowly drawn in to this story about young love (not).  It's a fascinating look at the power of social networking, young love and deception, boys becoming men, the loneliness of housebound women, and the  power of the imagination.  A low budget production but that doesn't deter from the story telling but rather enhances it.

B007LB2B3K|5.0|I had heard a few Volbeat songs on the radio and I loved all of them. However, I was fearful of buying the full album, as I often am, because it seems to be the trend for their to be three or four absolutely amazing songs on an album which make it on the radio, while the remainder of the album is mediocre and dull. I was overjoyed to find that this was not the case for this album. I love every song, though admittedly some more than others. The best (or worst) part of this amazing album is that it is hard to pick a favorite song. I love the unique sound of Michael's vocals, which really steal the show in just about every song.<br /><br />Every song on the album is different enough to stand out from the rest, while still being undeniably Volbeat. Some songs are slow and relaxed (Heaven nor Hell), some are calm and serious (Fallen), some are hardcore rock anthems that make you want to get up and fight (Warrior's Call). Because of the power and the rock 'n roll soul of the music, I can work out to every song. Yet because of the beauty of Michael's voice, and the powerful, steady rhythms, I can easily fall asleep to every song (and I love to!).<br /><br />This really was a perfect album to me. But that being said, don't expect to much from your music, or take it too seriously, as that will detract from your own enjoyment. As long as it's good, it works for me. And it's really good.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|I read this book in a day, it was easy reading and very light, but I had to keep reading to find out what happened.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and although it was light, it really had a good meaning behind it I feel, don't judge a book by the cover and don't take people at face value.<br /><br />all in all a really good read.
0375869026|3.0|There I was, honestly appreciating how deftly the author had handled all the myriad emotions a group of children and adults in this situation might feel. And then she let Spielberg write the second half!
6305313687|4.0|I've got to tell you that it was hard for me to sit through the violence and hatred that goes on in most of the movie. I watched this shortly after it came out and remember being very moved by it, but waited another decade to see it again because it is just so hard to watch. If you are affected by ugliness like I am, give it a chance. There is a point to it all.<br /><br />The settings are all great. Even if you've never been in the types of places that are filmed, you get a complete sense of what the neighborhood, school, prison, and party is like. The costumes, hair, and overall look of people is right on.<br /><br />The writing is pretty good. There are times, like at the dinner table scene with the mom's Jewish boyfriend, that the conversation seems contrived, but those moments are few. Usually the dialog moves the story along without ever seeming preachy or fake.<br /><br />The story is unique and fresh. It's not your typical Hollywood movie. It is a biography of a skinhead. It shows the development of his hatred, how his hate contaminated his thinking, his family and his life. Fortunately it ends with his redemption, but it does not come without cost. I wouldn't say all's well that ends well because it doesn't exactly end well, but the ending is what made it watchable for me.

B008DVW7DQ|5.0|I have seen and listened to most of the video clips on this DVD on YouTube and was positively enraptured by Jaroussky's performances. He is one of the few artists whom I find it fascinating to watch as well as listen to, since his emotive gestures and fantastic jaw control add to the expressiveness and drama of the arias he sings.<br /><br />One of my favorite clips is Porpora's Alto Giove, which is a sublime, slow aria that Jaroussky sings so touchingly that I have to be mopped up from the floor and put in a bucket to revert back from a puddle to a solid state (NB Jaroussky omits the arias fast B section).<br /><br />And then there are the videos with L'Arpeggiata from the Ambronnay Festival. The anonymous Ciaccona di Paradiso e dell'inferno, a typical \\"morality\\" piece from the Roman school around 1650, it is a dialogue between devils who try to tempt a soul into sin. But the soul resists, preferring eternal bliss in heaven to some devilish fun. It is a short piece, playing about 3:30'. Jaroussky enters to sing the first strophe in the role of the virtuous soul. When he is finished, one sees, much to one's surprise, L'Arpeggiata's fabulous chalumeau player and their violinist don sunglasses and sing the next strophe together, which describes the bright light cast by the fires of hell. During the next strophe, again sung by the soul, Jaroussky acts dismissively with the devils. These exchanges continue until the last strophe, when Jaroussky sings that he prefers the light in heaven and dons a pair of sunglasses himself.<br /><br />Monteverdi's Ohime ch'io cado is a solo chamber cantata on a passacaglia bass sequence. L'Arpeggiata and Jaroussky start the piece in a way that corresponds completely with how one would expect to hear this composition. Then, suddenly, things change, and the ensemble starts to \\"jazz up\\" Monteverdi in an unexpectedly entertaining and fun manner. Jaroussky even reverts to his natural baritone voice for a few seconds, before putting his hand on his mouth in an as-if-surprised manner at what he just did. He quickly reverts back to his counter tenor voice, but by then, with the jokes - even Christine Pluhar has difficulty maintaining a straight face - the jazzed-up version of Monteverdi, and the fabulous singing by Jaroussky accompanied perfectly by freely ornamented passages in the chalumeau, violin and consort musicians drive the audience to wild enthusiasm. This is simply a video which one must see before dying.<br /><br />The majority of the rest of the abundant video clips are arias from Handel and Vivaldi, accompanied by the excellent Ensemble Matheus under Spinosi's baton, Ensemble Artaserse and Le Concert d'Astree conducted by Emanuelle Haim. They mostly do not take the same liberties as L'Arpeggiata in the two pieces described above. They are \\"just\\" beautiful, though Jaroussky jokes around discreetly with Nouriel Rial in Monteverdi's Puro ti miro from L'Incoronazione di Poppea. The discrete fun the two singers have with the piece is fun to watch, and the singing is again fantastic. Jaroussky also sings Handel's Son nato a lagrimar (which Handel lifted from his own Brockes Passion twice over) from Giulio Cesare with Anne Sophie von Otter. This duet couldn't possibly sung better.<br /><br />Jaroussky ventures into more modern repertoire too, notably the Trejo from Piazzolla's Los pajaros perdidos which he singes wonderfully, as well as some art songs, like Hahn's glorious pasticcio in baroque style, A Chloris, Lekeu's Sur une tombe and Salvador's  Linda. These art songs do not suit Jaroussky's style like they did David Daniels, and one gets a feeling that he is nervous singing them. They are certainly the weakest videos on the DVD. But there are only 3 chansons like that on the DVD, so one can easily skip them.<br /><br />The only person who deserves some criticism for their performance is Emanuelle Haim. Watch her in, e.g., Vivaldi's Venti, turbini. When she conducts, she looks like she's halfwaybetween cramps and a seizure. Her shoulders are totally stiff and she barely conducts the L'Astree musicians. The best compliment I can give Ms. Haim is that she looks like Stephen Hawking.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the result is stil very good, but I now know why Haim prefers to only work with her own ensemble, who seem to understand her spastic jerks and don't mind endless rehearsals to get things right, because the grapevine says that Haim primarily conducts by talking a lot. One can understand that in January 2010 she was fired from the Paris Op&eacute;ra production of Mozart's Idomeneo after the orchestra complained of aesthetic and stylistic differences. It is simply impossible to follow her gestures, which is what most likely bothered the musicians at the Paris Opera. She was reinstated for a new production of Rameau's Hippolyte et Aricie, but with her own Concert d'Astr&eacute;e in the pit. Since Concert d'Astree is an ensemble used to her idiosyncracies she needed them in the orchestra pit to get through the performances of Rameau because they're presumably the only musicians who can follow her (or who are so good that they can just ignore her and still play together).<br /><br />This DVD is highly recommended for the generous selection of music, which runs for 161 minutes, and for the singing of the incomparable Philippe Jaroussky, who is one of the best singers in the world today in any category.between cramps and a seizure.

1574214276|5.0|I've purchased several Zentangle® books, and this is by far the most comprehensive: the Zentangle® method; lots of cool patterns with clear instructions; decent explanation of shading; advice about using color; and inspiring ZIAs, zendalas, etc. Lavishly and beautifully illustrated. Of course, this book has the same problem all the Zentangle® books have: many of the patterns are apparently copyright protected, which is QUITE alarming since anyone who's a decent doodler will have come up with them on their own, probably since grade school! Rather bemusing, I must say. But on the whole, Zentangle® is wonderful and this book conveys it splendidly.

B004132HZS|5.0|Make no mistake, this is a freaking brilliant TV series. It's amazing, fantastic, mind blowing, impressive and other synonyms that express how utterly brilliant the TV show is.<br /><br />BBC did a modern take on Jekyll and Hyde as well, which is intense and well done, but I prefer Sherlock. Sherlock in 21st century in itself as a concept, is fantastic. But the writers, producer and actors make Holmes and Watson come alive. I am in awe of this show. It's intense, funny at times, emotional, captivating, beautifully executed.<br /><br />People complain that it only has 3 episodes (1.5 hours each) per series but as the producer explained, this is because they're essentially films. Each structured and executed artfully. I would love more episodes per series but that would inevitably interfere with the quality of production and brilliance. It is absolutely worth 25 or whatever they charge per series. It's something you'll watch again and again, captivated and studying the subtleties in a new way at every viewing.<br /><br />Each episode Sherlock and Watson are presented with a new type of challenge, a different type of killer/enemy. Sherlock is an eccentric arrogant genius, and Watson is an intelligent, down to earth doctor (used to be doctor in war), side-kick. Their back and forth bantering is hilarious. The relationship is one for the ages.<br /><br />Steve Moffat is a genius too. His genius, and the amazing cast--they're responsible for this amazing TV show. I can't get over it--the show is a masterpiece. This is a unique kind of show, it's special and very impressive.<br /><br />Please give this show a try. Those on Amazon who dislike it, they don't have a clue what they're talking about. I promise you'll be SHERlocked (reference from series 2).
B000FC13MM|5.0|This was one of the first series I ever read. Definitely still one of my favorites even 10 years later
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This was a very good story. I had a hard time putting it down. Highly recommend every one to read.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This is my 2nd time reading this book because I loved it sooo much, if you love fantasy adventure and Greek mythology you will love this book!
B0089LOKHG|3.0|I think anyone who reads this final book will be slightly disappointed that we never know who Lena ends up with (Julian or Alex)... or what happens to Hana... or the rest of the U.S. resistance fighters and do on. Don't get me wrong I like the series but there are so many blanks, unanswered questions, and unsolved mysteries. It is a poor way to finish the series, it leaves reader feeling unfulfilled.  Such a shame because this was a decent series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very similar to temple run and surprisingly it doesn't get old its easier and more appealing concept. Cute graphics and I def recommend 5 stars!
B002JVWR4U|4.0|The epitaph episodes (last episodes of both seasons take place in the future, past the second season) honestly spoil some of the magic of the second season, and some of the twists border on very predictable. Characters kind of do interesting things, but they aren't as strong as the first season.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|really enjoyed this book...not was i was expecting! I loved Amy's side of the story even though she is nuts! Nick was an interesting character as I was mixed in my opinion of him...
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I loved it until the last episode.  Killing off Mathew was not accetable and made me angry,  If the actor did not renew his contract, they could have replaced him next season. Also the maner in which they killed him was not believable.  He would have heard<br />that enormous old machine coming from 1/2 mile away.
B004YD1KTO|5.0|I read this book after reading sister which i totally loved. Although this book kept me engaged i did nto love it as much as sister...Thought provoking also however and worth a read
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|its really a great game
B003PPDBQ2|5.0|I loved this book.Quite a dark theme and very thoguht provoking. I totally idenified with both characters and the book was very well written.A page turner and an emotional journey of sisterhood and love
0062082353|5.0|Best read lately true American hero who will be truly missed. Inside look at what these elite warriors go through to protect our freedoms.
B003X27L9U|5.0|My mother advised me not to read this as the subject matter was too dark. However i did so and this book totally changed the way I thought of someone beng held captive for a long time...the feelings and emotions expressed by the author in this book blew me away.Simple.Brilliant.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Need a release from reality?  This is it. Jessica Lange steals every scene she's in.  Truly, the ultimate great escape.
B005HSGB6W|5.0|The book was just like the movie, which was great! I did enjoy the last chapter. It seemed that there was something missing in the movie. Alex grew up.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I have a standalone sound machine that I've used for three years.  This app has more sound choices than any standalone unit. Plus the sounds loop seamlessly.  I like and now use this so much that I am giving my machine to one of the kids.
B0030U1TLQ|5.0|I bought this CD from Amazon/ Movie Mars and it was delivered quickly and in perfect condition. This CD is worth owning just for the full Live Concert of the Disintergration Album.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I thought it was a great riveting  story til the end  it lacked satisfaction and promise of away back or the possibility of a happy life
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Continued intrigue with the story, characters, costuming. The story is played with passion, humor, wit and sweetness. Can't wait for season 4!
B00009RDGA|5.0|As much as I hate to admit it, I was routing, &#34;Atta girl, atta boy!&#34; the entire time I watched the movie.
015603008X|5.0|Loved it as a teenager, love it even more as an adult after just re-reading it. Moving protrayal of a man as he moves from one stage to another and then regresses. Perception is reality to some extent, as his perception and recognition of his surroundings changes, his reality changes. Also in my opinion, at times, medicine goes a bit far, more than it should - as Charlie's quality of life reduced overall. Classic writing, this book is one of the reasons I can't do Kindle. Something about reading a well written piece and have the story develop as you turn the pages.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love love love this game I just can't. gt enough.!!!!!!!!! I like the daily challenge thing cuz it is a real challenge and most games take just a few mins to complete.
B00632HWOG|5.0|It works very well and I did need the access to my email.  If I have any complaints, it will have to wait until I use it more often as I just set it up.
B000068TPN|5.0|Product was perfect, like I bought it brand new. Never knew it was used. I am very satisfied. Once again great movie
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Quite impressive programming when it comes to prediction. Flow makes one handed operation a breeze. Would highly recommend to anyone.
B0000524E5|5.0|Disk in great condition. I love this movie because a woman followed her dreams to get out of her boring life, did what she had to do to help her father out and on top of that learned how to dance and enjoy it.
0385344333|5.0|I have read all of Lee Child's Jack reacher novels.  I read my first one, Gone Tomorrow, a few years ago out of curiosity, never having heard of Lee Child.  After that I gradually read all the others.  As with all writers, some books are better than ever.  I bought his previous book, The Affair, in hardback, soon after it was published.<br /><br />When A Wanted Man was published, the reader reviews on Amazon were less than good.  Such as I can't believe Lee Child really wrote this book.  So I decided to wait for the book in paperback.  Then at my local used bookstore, I found a copy of A Wanted Man and bought it.  Finished it just last night.  It is a very good book.  Maybe not the best Reacher, but entertaining and in the fast-paced style of Lee Child.<br /><br />Toward the end, Reacher makes some tactical decisions in the plot that I did not feel were characteristic of him, but then this is fiction.  The story opens with Reacher having a bandaged broken nose.  He refers to it off and on throughout the book.  He never does reveal how it really happened.  I would give this book a four-star rating.  Good, better than good.  Maybe a five-star since it entertained me all the way through.  Five it is.
B000FBJAOG|5.0|It was a good book it was realistic that it could possibly happen... jk it was gay as hell. Dont read it
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I've fallen prey to one of history's classic blunders!  The first is never get involved in a land war in Asia.  The second is not to spend your whole snow day off work building a virtual theme park!  What's the harm?  The game is free...I can just walk away at any time...FOUR HOURS LATER...ach!  I just sent my triceratops off to the research lab to &quot;evolve,&quot; only to find out the game is actually holding him hostage trying to get me to PAY REAL MONEY to try and get him back!  I should've never done it!  It asked me if I was sure and I said I was but I really wasn't because I had no idea what was going to happen.  Oh pity me, miserable wretch that I am!  He was my pride and joy; a level 10 coin-generating machine!  And now his exhibit, standing smack in the center of my park, is a vacant eyesore, mocking me for my lack of app savvy.  I've been snookered, I say!  Even if the spell check keeps turning in to snickered.  Anyway, I was loving the game until the whole extortion thing started.  So very sad.
B000001FXV|5.0|All the best of BOB Marley on one CD.  Great men die young. Great RG Band ever. RIP BOB we love ya
B004LROUNG|5.0|Liked all the legal ins and outs of  lawsuits.  Loved the characters, didn't want it to end.  Glad the epilogue was included
B008K8X0IS|5.0|I'm glad I ventured into this magnificent world! I cannot wait to see all the future seaons in the future!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Excellent tool to use for studying the Word of God. Easy to use and daily scripture reading to get your day started.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I bought this along with season 1, can't wait for the third season to come out in a couple of weeks.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like Doctor Who, I remembered episodes from my childhood unfavorably.  My wife and I have been watching one episode at a time.  We are drawing out our pleasure.  We own many DVDs from BBC and will watch them many times.  BBC America is much more appealing to us than the low quality of American TV.  I was sorry to see the price of the second season is $99.00, that is more than we can afford so I guess no more Doctor who until the price is more reasonable.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I have read most all of Ken Follett's books and have loved them all !  This new trilogy of which Winter of World is the second novel continues to follow the historical epic of the 20th century  is fantastic.  As in the first novel of this trilogy (Fall of Giants) we can visulize the history of that time along with the characters that are followed from each generation of the same families throughout both novels. You become part of each of those families with the struggles that are endured during the good and the bad times.  The book is hard to put down and you don't want it to ever end.  I can hardly wait to read the 3rd novel of this trilogy when it is published.
0143116177|4.0|This is a superbly written book, but it is only good as a general overview of the history of finance and is not deep. I've read a fair bit about the history of finance and economics as well as general history, and I did not find any big new ideas in this book, not even many facts that I hadn't read at some time before in my life. But I strongly recommend this book to anyone who hasn't read about financial history. Ferguson has a smooth writing style and takes time to mention delightful curious things that, while they aren't relevant to money, keep up the reader's enthusiasm. I will now remember forever that ghetto comes from an Italian word for metal castings (Jews lived in an area of Venice that used to be an iron foundry).<br /><br />I remember giving a speech in grade one in elementary school about money. I don't remember any of what I put together to say, but I remember the idea being that money a useful tool to let us buy or sell things without having to barter. But that's not where money comes from; money didn't originate in some agreement to have a handy method of exchange, but rather it was found that certificates of debt were useful to exchange.<br /><br />There are imperfections with the book. In the introduction Ferguson seems to suggest that he will explain to the reader why some CEOs are paid tens of millions dollars a year, but I don't think this topic is ever dealt with in the book. (I think that the best answers to this question will come from psychology and behavioral finance.) And saying that the total notional value of derivatives is $50 trillion could lead the leader to wrong conclusions. Derivatives being worth this much does not mean that the financial world someone dwarfs the real economy. I can make an agreement with you to pay you $50 trillion next month if you give me $50 trillion next month and we're even. (We could work this so I give you a dollar that I actually have, you give me a dollar that you actually have, and then we promise eachother the dollar we will get, etc., so we can construct a series of covered trades.) Perhaps you could say there are now $100 trillion of derivatives contracts. A better conclusion is that it could be difficult to unravel the derivatives contracts, or just to understand how much you owe and how much people owe you.<br /><br />But although there are imperfections in the book and although it does not offer much that is new to someone who has read about the topic before, I can't think of a better book for someone who would like to start learning about the history of finance.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I give this book five stars because there was not a ten star rating. This book is wonderful and is really helpful to someone who might be going through the same stuff. I loved everything about this book. I even had parts where I just sat and cried while I read it. I would recommend this book to everyone I know who loves to read.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|The quality of this game us more than I ever expected from a free game. Love this game! I love the graphics, and the game play. Such a great story.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Wonderful book gives truth about growing up although he is different you can generalize the situation s he goes through
B0054JZC6E|5.0|my daughter and I each love to play the vast amount of games this offers! we challenge each other and its great fun! lots of different focus areas for girls and boys.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This story is set in England.  I really enjoy the quirky English humor.  The premise of the story is imaginative and interesting.  I felt very engaged with the characters.  I will definitely look for more by the same author.
1616550414|5.0|I have waited a lot for this book and it's above my every expectation. I grew up with Zelda, and I can honestly say that a purchase such as this I would normally consider a waste of money, considering my economical status, but I certainly don't regret it. Money should not be only about necessity. It should also be for things you love, and boy, do I love it!
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|This DVD was a fair judgement of the materials. It showed how America fell out of favor with the Iran and it's people. Unlike Syriana the information contained does not take sides. Syriana showed the Islamic side and being an American I was offended by George Clooney's film. Yes, America made diplomatic mistakes and this is brought out in the movie. I hope knowing the truths will lead to a peaceful diplomatic solution to America and the Mid East nations
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Good game and really fun to play an  keep me from doing mischief . Also I like the graphics an  the characters because  it makes the fan  seem very interesting to play
B008MEM24S|5.0|Ok, I understand the marketing nonsense that would allow i-users to get a long anticipated update in advance of android users, but 2 WEEKS???  Heck, even the Google Play Store has had it available for a couple days now... Way to punish your customers for their loyalty (or for having bought a Kindle) Amazon...
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|I would give this five stars if it didn't keep giving me internal server errors. otherwise, pretty damn entertaining for a free app!
B001DJLD1M|4.0|All 4 films for $9, great price.  DVDs came stacked upon each other on one prong within the case vs individual section for each, never seen that before in multi DVD collections.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I just finished this great book and wish I had read it15 years ago. No 2 people are alike and almost have the people in the world are introverts. Yet we live in a Culture of Personality where being a showman is more important than depth or character. Just look at political campaigns in this country and you will see the point  v
B0093X80VQ|5.0|I wish there was more to it. It leaves you in suspense and there's no book after it. Over all it was great.
B0007MWZEK|4.0|I do like this sweeper.  I had owned a shark previously (that I loved) and it eventually died out on me.  This sweeper picks up just as good - but it not as heavy duty as the shark - but for the price difference that is fine.  The only thing I noticed is that you have to use a 'mopping motion' while going over throw rugs...or it the sweeper head will flip up and out spilling the contents of what it has swept up (because it is soo lightweight). I love having something like this (ESPECIALLY for cat hair!) to tidy up between regular vacuuming with my rainbow.
B005LAIGLO|5.0|CAME BEFORE ESTIMATED DATE, WRAPPED UP VERY WELL,PLAYS WELL,MY HUSBAND AND FATHER IN LAW HAS BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS MOVIE, GREAT PRICE THANKS
B0083H6AQA|5.0|Typical Don Juan movie but had a great ending.  I loved all of the movie, Pattinson did an excellent job of being the Don Juan and the scenery was amusing as well.  I would recommend this one.
B00BP2OO40|5.0|NOTE: Despite what's stated in the editorial review, this IS a box set - 7 discs in one case, plus another set for the 2 bonus features. Also, they are Region-Free (R0). I haven't seen these movies in years and what a joy to watch them again, and what a bargain! All that I've watched so far are excellent quality. The \\"25 Years\\" set is quite a bonus as well. Case and disc artwork aren't the greatest but the discs play well, and for this price I can't complain.<br /><br />Also, kudos for not including #3, which has nothing to do with the Halloween franchise and is just a waste of money.
B002SF9YUM|4.0|The only thing I didnt like was that it was almost borderline Italian film with the accent, etc.  Some of the language was hard to understand otherwise it was good.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|A retired Batman has let Gotham wallow for ten years in crime.  Finally stirred to fight back, will a middle aged Dark Knight be a able to defeat the Mutants?
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|She doesn't seem like the type to get in such trouble or do such damage, but from the insights on how her life developed from the previous 2 volumes you can understand and still marvel.<br />Lisbeth is one tough cookie!! Yet unlike those evil people who ruined her youth (and set her on a course to be such a spectacular person) she ultimately shows restraint and punishes those who caused her so much pain with justice and payment in kind.<br />I would like her as a friend, but be terrified of her as an enemy!<br />The 3rd and last of the series. Worth reading just to see how it comes out, but great reading anyway.
0060558121|4.0|Unexpected.  Our wednesday book group read it.  It was recommended by our priest.  She had read it. I like the part about Easter.
B001FB5634|5.0|This video is just great. The subject is horrible but so accurate you feel part of the adventure. The most horrible is that you continually hope that an event that destroys humanity like this will never happen, but the best is seeing the ultimate goodness of those who survive as human beings as the flame they each carry in their heart. This is what civilization means without all the gadgets and gizmos. If you've never thought about it, an important lesson, that also serves as a stern warning not to take this world of ease and convenience for granted, but to protect the Earth we all share.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I enjoy this app. There are a lot of good free puzzles to choose from and the puzzle is challenging enough to keep me interested.
0545265355|5.0|Great books i wont spoil or anything but seriously really good books to read. i dont read much and i really didnt think i read these but the first one was my fav. There well wrote and i love the ending. It opens up to crazy adventure and with traggic outcome. Nothings fair at all in the books but thats life. The booksare great read
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Lovely lovely script and characters, and the costumes have made a 20's Fashion trend for us!! A must see -
B009IEXKXI|5.0|A book I had trouble putting down.  I loved the way each challenge was met and resolved and the story line is very believable.  Some people may find it a bit drawn out with the technical descriptions of the problems and solutions but for me it was great.
0765325950|5.0|I finished this series with a great sense of satisfaction, even though there are loose ends which only Jordan could have put in place.
B006ZAZ31U|3.0|It started off ok but did not manage to hold my interest beyond the 5th chapter.  I persevered but would not recommend it as a good read.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Yes - there is preparation and work required with this case, but that's the point. That's what makes it the best.<br /><br />Take the time and read the directions, watch the YouTube videos, and you'll be fine.
B0095P33IW|2.0|It started slow and I keep waiting for it to take off and it never did.  Very slow movie and calling this an action adventure is inaccurate.  Basically no action nor adventure.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|Great app to turn your pictures into paper format.<br /><br />My friends kept asking how did I edit photos to look like paper and I told them about this great app!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I love the graphics. They are clear and easy to read. It is very helpful to know battery strength especially before long flights. I would recommend this to others.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is my son's favorite game and just loves it!!  It is just a great game for kids to have on a tablet!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|good graphics fun to play helps pass the time when yourr board itdoes take a lot of time to download but once you are in it is not too bad it is pretty mundane something just to pass the time when you are board the app is funi do like to play but i just downloaded the app so i am not sure how i feel about the game yet i do like the graphics that is probably the best feature.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Love the convenience of using amazon to download instantly to my electronic devices.  The book was ok - typical Nicholas Sparks.  Kind of predictable - but still a good story.
B006X08FDA|4.0|I continue to enjoy the musicianship and vocals of The Carolina Chocolate Drops!  Very soulful.  Leaving Eden did not disappoint!
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Not at all bad series. J.J.Abrams can't disappoint you too much, he just can't. Anyways, definitely recommend to all sci-fi lovers.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|Back in 1962, a movie called 'Dr. No' came out, with the main character being played by Sean Connery. This film was based on a book about a spy named James Bond (maybe you've heard of him). Most people define their image of James Bond as Sean Connery. The two are inseperable. Sean was NOT the choice of author Ian Fleming, however. He described Bond as looking more like David Niven (the literary Bond also has a scar on his face). Ever since then (and probably even before that) films have been made from the source material of novels, with casting that might not quite match up. This is nothing new. A few years back (once again with 007) everyone ranted and complained that Daniel Craig couldn't possibly play the part because he had blond hair. At first I was included in this bunch. But you know what? Daniel Craig gave 110% and knocked it out of the park with 'Casino Royale', and people loved it, myself included. Even more recently, 'Drive' was adapted with great success, with large stylistic changes from the book.<br /><br />So now, people are complaining because Tom Cruise isn't a 6' 5\\" blond guy like Jack Reacher is. I don't know for sure, but my guess is that the casting doesn't happen the way a lot of people think. My guess is that Tom Cruise was made aware of the project somehow, and had a key role in getting it off the ground. Thats only my guess. But here's the deal, for fans of the novels, what else do you want? An actor (a good one, I might add) has put everything into making a good, engaging, fun, and visually appealing movie. This is FILM, and the truth is that it has to differentiate itself from the source material. But even so, this movie is as close to the 450+ page novel as one would hope to get. And in my humble opinion, the movie improves upon the source material.<br /><br />The film adds a style that doesn't come accross in the book. Maybe thats what some fans want, but fans of the books didn't make the movie. I've heard some people complain that JackReacher only walks to places and rides buses in the books. This is true. But its also true in the film. He does borrow a car in the movie, but guess what?... HE ALSO BORROWS A CAR IN THE NOVEL. It makes me think that people saw the trailer and just assumed the car belongs to Reacher. It doesn't. He isn't driving everywhere in his personal set of wheels. He does plenty of walking and bus riding.<br /><br />Enough with the critics. This film harkens back to action movies of the 60's and early 70's. As I was watching it, 'Bullitt' came to mind. The pace is refreshing, and when the action happens, it makes sense and is delivered with the highest attention to quality and detail. Smart decisions were made in adding things (the car chase, an extra fight scene or two, tension between Jack and Helen) and taking away things (boat shoes, unnecessary characters, and Sheryl Crow), depending on what works for the film, itself.<br /><br />Regardless of what you think about the books, the film was very very well made, with mystery, action, and well-placed humor. Lee Child is alright with Cruise playing the character, so why shouldn't everyone else be? Those passing on this because of nit-picking should try to regroup and accept whatever deviations from the book, and be glad that a movie got made. It looks like it might be the only one.<br /><br />5 stars for standing out among an ocean of mediocre movie making.
B001O1O71C|5.0|Such a sad but good book! It's better than the movie and definitely worth your time!! I am so glad a read this!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I really really loved the scene where all the dwarves streamed in bit by bit for dinner with Bilbo.  I can imagine Tolkien's big smile if he would have seen this scene in this movie.  I do not want to wait until Christmas for an extended version and this blu-ray will suffice more than enough. And anyways, when the longer version comes out I will buy it too!  This is the best Tolkien book to movie done yet.<br /><br />I would like to mention that the story was expanded a bit and an evil character introduced that is not in the Hobbit book.  But I do not care.  It adds to the story and gives a bit more depth and intrigue.<br /><br />I saw this film in 3D and I hope the 3D is good on blu-ray but I have not had a good experience yet with Under The Sea IMAX, the first blu-ray 3D I watched on my plasma Panasonic TV that supposedly is 3D.  I will update this review to comment on the 3D.<br /><br />I am extremely eager to see the next movie and the final one too.  I bought my son The Hobbit in hardcover book format.  I hope he keeps it as a heirloom and passes it on to his child someday.<br /><br />To all my fellow Amazonians and Tolkien-lovers I wish you a GOOD JOURNEY !
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a good game. It keeps me busy and not bored. It's very fun. It teaches responsibility to kids..It's a sort of learning tool. I have a 2 yr. Old niece and she loves this game.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Huge fan of the books, and the HBO series.  Great set of blu-rays, fantastic picture quality.  Excited for season 3.

B007DIQC90|5.0|I hadn't heard much of their music before purchase, just caught them on one of the late night shows.<br />I really like their infectious energy and the songs sound great. I'm trying to expand my acquaintance with Icelandic and Scandinavian music.
B009EEFTMC|3.0|The constant turning of the block to find matches is a bit tedious and not very challenging.  Okay way to pass the time.
B0089LOKHG|2.0|I loved this series especially the first book.  My one dissapointment was that the author didnt wrap up the romance.  Who does Lena end up with and why?!!!  This would have been so easy to end...her and Alex as soul-mates, kind of damaged, but still in love.  Then Julian could end up with the new girl - less damaged, both alone and need eachother.  Aargh!
B009D0KER2|5.0|Very pleased with this app. Loads up fast. I usually check the international section where I get a broader view than just on U.S. news apps.<br />The different perspective that a European newspaper gives on American news is appreciated. The various regions of the world are much better covered than on a US newspaper app such as USA Today (which by the way is also a great app).<br />One more thing I like about Le Monde is that breaking news around the world including the US quickly show up. It helps me to have a more balanced view on news by getting a foreign perspective.<br />One thing I didn't like as much is that the front page typically will have French sport news especially on soccer and soccer teams ... I just go to the section I want to read.<br />All in all this is a great news app.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Hi amazon I know its weird but subway surfer I think its a pretty fun game I just think y'all should make a grand theft auto for free on kindle like this other than that I love subway surfed actually my godfather made me download it but now I see why its awesome I love it espicially in Rome. Thanks a lot for coming up with amazon.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This app is very fun. Just like the original, it has all the right mechanics without too many unnecessary ads. I really like it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I require my friend to make an effort to read this book. It us the most popular book out there right now. So please try to read it.
B003Z49LYO|5.0|Nice story set against great setting backdrop ... stunning in HD. We are in love with this period of stories ... keep them coming in HD.

B001P9KR8U|4.0|Not a film to enjoy with pleasure but not a film to miss. This movie really hits at the seedy side of life that infests most large cities of the world.
B004OZZ624|4.0|It was a great movie and it definitely kept me interested. I only give my favorite movies 5s, but this is the second time I have watched it and it was still great.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|Reminds me a lot of the old Super Mario game.  I think I will be playing this one a lot.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|Johnny Depp, at it again, he always makes a movie something different. This is definitely not a movie that you can only watch one time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game but I keep missing the eggs<br />But still cool game but I keep running into a sign of a pole like no I was about to brake this thing
B0052RDHTM|2.0|Certainly NOT up to his usual writings. Seemed to wandr around and have no particular idea of where he was headed. could NOT get past the 120th page.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play this game all day long. This is my favorite runner game.I got all my friends posing this game..
B004TMPJP6|5.0|Despite the name Wunderlist is more a task/to do app than a list/note app, although you can certainly use it to track your notes too. It offers GTD type functionality and includes Inbox, Starred, Today, Week, All, and Completed categories, although these are all hidden by default when you first install the app and you have to go into Edit to make them visilble instead of being on \\"automatic.\\"<br /><br />Wunderlist offers cloud syncing across all your devices and collaboration with friends and family, or whoever you want to invite. I read a lot of the reviews and people consistently report the syncing across multiple devices is easy and problem free, which has been my experience also. This is not always the case if you research and read the reviews on the other To Do and Note apps. The interface is pleasing and uncluttered and puts an emphasis on simplicity and useability rather than on detail and clutter, which I like. It doesn't do everything some of the other more complex apps do (such as iNotebox or Evernote) that I looked at but it's easier on the eye and easier to use. Wunderlist also offers the capability to use graphics and photos besides text. I hardly every use that but it's there if you need it. Wunderlist consistently rates four stars or higher on the Apple Store and Amazon websites. I'd like the ability to manually sort, sort by date (which many to do apps offer) and drag and drop (which most don't) but as another reviewer said these are not show-stoppers. Overall, Wunderlist is one of the top offerings in a crowded field and offers a lot for the money.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I lOVE this game! It is addicting and fun to play. My favorite part of the game is how challenging it is. Why not take a chance and try it? After all, it is free!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Very touchy subject handled beautifully.  I loved the characters and the emotion.  There were a few  parts that felt a bit disconnected, but that is simply opinion.  Still a great read.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|Well if you have good imagination get this game the thing is everything needs gems when you get to level 20 to 30 so you need to save up your gems for stuff like tht cuz you'll need them. Trust me.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a very good book to read. It kept your interest through the whole book. I would definitely recommend this book to any who likes to read.<br />Yourdestiny
6304504012|5.0|Evita appeals to my inner survival of the fittest interest.  Others may criticize the movie as film, but I believe in movies as personally entertaining.  This is entertaining, even the singing (I belong to the nation of tone deaf so I am not an expert there).  The sharp social commentary embedded in the movie makes it a good satire and echoes the \\"wisdom\\" of those who step on people going up the ladder usually end up going down...for whatever reason.  Evita's climb was a spectacle, her style over the top:  it's escapist, satirical, slyly humorous and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I bought the used VHS  and found it in excellent condition, as described on the website.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|Very weird movie.  Very little plot development, very little character development.  It just kind of plugs along and leaves you with many unanswered questions.  Not sure why the reviews were so good. . .
B00BHU9BV6|4.0|Fantastic cast .Excellent adaptation of a great classic novel. Kiera Knightly was fantastic and beautiful as always the suprise for me is the star of Kickass (Aaron Taylor Johnson) he was great.A must see if you like a good period piece.
0553801473|2.0|Blah, blah, blah...<br />\\"Words are wind\\" the author says repeatedly throughout this tome. Much wind gets blown in this installment. If only he had heeded his own advice.<br />There is so much unnecessary descriptive verbiage in this book it easily could have been 500 pages shorter and thus a better read.<br />I really don't need detailed descriptions of every person's raiment or armor, every room's decor, or every brick's color, shape and condition. A sigil or a name tells me what I need to know, and a descriptive pronoun plus my imagination can work wonders.<br />I really don't care for what George R.R. Martin is doing or has done with his characters or plot, but hey, they are his characters.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed the first four books in this series.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|I HAVE TRIED TO GET THE MP3DOWNLOADER TO WORK WITH MY NEW MP3 PURCHASES OM MY MAC. IT FAILS EVERY TIIME. I HAVE GOT EMAIL, TELEPHONE, ALL KINDS OF ADVICE FROM AMAZON, NONE OF IT HELPS.<br />SONGS ARE IN THE CLOUD, BUT WILL NOT DOWNLOAD TO MY COMPUTER.<br />I AM JUST GOING TO STOP BUYING MP3'S FROM AMAZON.<br />MAYBE SOMEBODY OUT THERE CAN HELP ME, AMAZON DOES NOT.
B0045XICB2|4.0|In Eclipse, there are several parts of the movie that coincide with the book and most of the changes were either necessary or just made sense to change in order to keep the flow and time of the movie what it needed to be.
B0049VZ222|5.0|I had no desire to watch this series but my 'kids' talked me into it. It appears I am now hooked!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|My husband and I both really loved this movie!  It is suspenseful, interesting, and well-made; definitely deserved the best picture award.
B005DF2QMC|1.0|I returned it.. it wasn't any good.  Warbled when it played a tape. And the recording included poor reproduction and a steady hum. I didn't have time or expertise to trouble shoot it. I need a plug and play device.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun. It is my favorite game. I like it even more than minecraft. I wish I could play it all the time.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I find that this application has been helpful in many ways. It has a good system and I find nothing wrong with it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|If you are a fan of the series... you are going to love season 3. A lot happens (without giving anything away) and a lot begins to change... make sure you sit with a box of tissues for a few episodes...
B008K8X0IS|4.0|Love the series. Really glad to have got my own copy in blue ray. However, the packaging is excessive. I don't need an oversize box that won't fit with other DVDs in my collection (so it either sits all by itself, or the nice big box needs to be discarded so the smaller packaging of the DVDs themselves, held within the large box can be stored with other DVDs. Also, I reallyl could care less about having my own &#34;dragon's egg.&#34; I would have much preferred no fancy packaging, no dragon's egg, and lower price.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A story such as this is difficult for me to write about since I wouldn't want to divulge the ending. I enjoyed the story immensely.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I loved the story, but already seeing the movie takes out a little of the mystery. Potty, still deserves a 5 star rating
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is good and i also like othe games but  guess this game is ok as well cool deal man.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|fun game if you like horses. easy to use and addicting. and it is completely free to use. you should try it
B00881VLCE|2.0|I have tried a few different games like this and it just wasn't want I was expecting so I got rid of it.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The price for this was outstanding when I purchased it. Great value, perfect condition, many bonus features, and a great movie!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This was a great book about the struggles of war and what I believe is true American spirit. Thanks for your service.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|Being a huge fan of the harry potter movies and books, this movie is everything I ever dreamed of, containing lots of special features and such. the only thing I didn't like was that the special features can only be viewed on blu ray, so i have to find someone else's player to borrow, since they are too expensive for me to purchase
B0017HEX76|5.0|My grandkids LOVE Fantasia, but somehow, we've lost the CD (still have the case).  I ordered a new copy because I think this is a great way to introduce kids to classical music.<br /><br />Besides, I like it!
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|Perfect condition, movie plays like it should, no scratches, and good sound/video quality. The movie is just as awesome as I remembered!
1451695195|1.0|I find these types of books interesting. But this story was one of the least interesting of the genre. Of the sparse details offered I found many suspect. For example, why did the author label locations of his experience The Core, The Worm's Eye-view, and The Gateway? These seemingly arbitrary terms smack of confabulation because they describe a preconception, or construct, of what he was experiencing while claiming he had no preconception. I found it odd that his labels were more descriptive than his written descriptions of his experience. The term he learned for god (Om) seems odd, too. It is a vocalization used in HIndu meditation and is a mystical Sanskrit sound that is sacred in various Dharmic religions. Perhaps the author heard it previous to his experience and co-opted it as a means to connect with various new age traditions.<br /><br />Near death experiences are often uniquely strange. Strangeness doesn't discount testimony. But if he is a scientist as he claims why does he give such flimsy proof while insinuating his proof is irrefutable? That is the most damaging part of his narrative. If I were a scientist that had such an experience I wouldn't advance my experience as proof that it was real. If he really is a scientist he is not a very imaginative one because he can't envision why anyone would doubt his testimony or imagine alternative explanations.<br /><br />His realization that the Butterfly girl was his deceased sister struck me as suspect. At the very least he has tweaked the story for dramatic impact. Why did it take so long for him to realize that she was his sister? Since it wasn't obvious isn't it possible he projected this desire onto his memory as his memory reformed itself? You either recognize someone or you don't. You don't slowly realize someone is your sister.<br /><br />There are several factors that suggest the author is positioning himself as a guru. His mention that his memories are slowly coming back to him suggests he has a sequel in mind.<br /><br />I'm reluctant to discount his experience. But if he wants to be believed he needs to communicate a more creditable story with more facts pointing to its veracity. Being a neurosurgeon with a unique story is not evidence.in mind.<br /><br />I'm reluctant to discount his experience. But if he wants to be believed he needs to communicate a more creditable story with more facts pointing to its veracity. Being a neurosurgeon with a unique story is not evidence.
B00BHMF578|2.0|I thought there would be a lot of drama and action in the story.  However, the story reminded me of a TV program mini series and it could pass for one.  I didn't like the cursing in the story, either.  I'm glad I didn't have to spend the full amount when watching in a theatre.  Sorry...
0307730697|5.0|This is a great and interesting book. Tells the story of one of our great heroes. The only downside is if you aren't into the SEALS, then you won't appreciate this excellent book.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|The Bourne movies are some of the best smart action movies around. If the Bourne Legacy doesn't match them, its not by much. I felt compelled to watch without pause for the entire movie, just like the earlier Matt Damon movies. There is also a great supporting cast. What's not to like?
B003EI2EH2|5.0|I enjoyed reading the book.  The diet works well for me but not so much for my wife.  Thanks Tim, great work
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't wait to see how they manage creating this arena....the books have so much more detail, but I will still watch and buy the movie
B0017K8X5Q|4.0|This is replacing the fan on my CPU cooler. It works great. The only problem is I have had vibration issues after installing this new fan. Probably user error. I fixed it by taking the fan off again and wrapping the bottom edge with electrical tape for padding. Now it is silent!
B000ZHS3E8|5.0|I have never downloaded a movie before, but I am sure glad I did. The story, the story is great! The film gives you a visual landscape to satisfy your sense's. It is a great sleeper sci-fi movie. A must see...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game for people who love to take care of animals and is very realistic.  My daughter loves this game and ask me all of the time when we are going to get to buy more horses!  Great graphics also!
B009NCM248|5.0|Too many times music gets stuck in a genre, and people never give it a chance, because its not their style. Do yourself a favor, and listen to this album. Its great! I'm 49, and listen to just about everything except country, and I'm here to tell you, that in 20 years, they will be playing this on the classic stations of the time. Corey Taylor is a real talent. A great vocalist, and the lyrics actually say something.<br />  The opening track, Gone Sovereign is worth the price alone. It has one of the greatest riffs ever! And trust me, I've heard em all. The music itself is extremely well done. Nothing self serving here. Meaning no 15 minute solos, or a drummer trying to make the next great sound by drumming off beat.<br />  After listening to music for so many years, its very difficult to find music that can move you any more. I grew up on Sabbath, and thats a hard act to follow. If these guys stay in the vein they're in now, they may be what todays youth are comparing everything else to for the next 40 years or so....ITS THAT GOOD!!!
B0000TLA9G|5.0|It was the cd that I ordered. My last order of this cd was the wrong cd.<br /><br />I received Against Me Reinventing Axl Rose and I would like to send it back and get credit for the error but I do not know how to go about doing this.<br />Thank you, Lisa Segal
B006X5L6VS|1.0|This app would not work on my kindle fire. Perhaps the kindle fire does not have a built in GPS.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This is a great way to keep in touch with family and friends and old classmates. I also go on there daily to play several games.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the next best thing to having a real horse.  The horse looks and acts and sounds so real.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I got this to put on my tablet to play when I'm not near the computer. Lots of fun and has different levels of play.
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|It does what it says, good for jotting notes to yourself. However, I experienced a lot of lag in syncing. It syncs in good time when I'm using my computer, but there is a huge lag when I try to sync with the app when I am using my mobile devices (phone and tablet). When I open the app it would be nice to have everything synced already and ready to go, but it's not, even for notes that are several days old. I have to manually sync and even then sometimes the notes that come up are not the most recent version. Very frustrating, so I hardly ever use Evernote anymore.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Leaves you in awe of what our military is doing for our country!<br />An exciting read that was hard to put down after the first page.
B004BSFC46|2.0|I was rather disappointed with these; the rattles are very faint and the sizing is small, so if you have a robust child then they will probably not fit. My son does like to suck on these (although to be honest he sucks on everything within reach) but other than that there's not much to them. I would have liked a stronger rattle, which is the reason why I got them.<br /><br />I currently use them to attach other toys to the handle of his car seat since the velcro is good for that and strong enough that he can't yank the toys down on himself.
B007GE2H3G|4.0|Very enjoyable movie for the whole family. TinTin's adventures were very entertaining. His dog was an adorable sidekick. I would recommend TinTin for all ages.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|This works just fine on my Kindle Fire, and the interface is MUCH better than Kindle's default. The Kindle default program interface is a bit strange, as it makes you first scroll down and then tap over to go to the next page. Adobe Reader, on the other hand, does smooth scrolling all the way down.<br /><br />However, I took off a star as Adobe Reader runs a bit slow on the Kindle Fire and it can freeze/crash if the pdf is especially large. Use the Kindle default program for large pdfs! Also the pagination scrolling is a bit obnoxious as the buttons are very small and not particularly sensitive.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I can not tell you in words how much I LOVED this book!  It is for sure one of my favorite ever books to read.  It is such a heartfelt book, I could not put it down.  I felt every emotion while reading.  Read this book you will love it!
B0043GAZYS|2.0|The main reason I bought this Blu Ray is that I love the movie and want to download it on my Ipad, but the digital copy had expired.  If I would've known that, I would've just bought it thru ITunes instead of the disc.  Very dissapointed
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|So I have to say that even though I seem to be the minority here this was not my favorite Colleen Hoover book.  I do think it was good and I would recommend it to my friends but, I am up in the air about it.  I thought it was kinda slow at first but I got into it eventually.  There were a few things I totally saw coming and a few HUGE surprises!  All in all I would say you should definitely give it a try!
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|We are lucky to have more stuff to listen to.  Very few people put some much down on tape and thankfully it was the master himself.  Its not equal to his first 3 albums, but then again...didnt expect it to be.<br /><br />this album is terrific.  it is well put together and fun to listen to.  I dont get the negative reviews.  buy it, you wont be disappointed.
B0013ND30M|5.0|A Christmas gift for my granddaughter, she loves all the disney classic's so we try to make sure she gets them all.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|My kids love this game!! This morning it &quot;updated&quot; and now all we have is a blank screen! Please fix!
B0089LOKHG|5.0|Requiem is an amazing book that makes you cry, laugh, and never want to put the book down. I recommend this book to people who enjoy action and love story's. It is probably my favorite book that I have read. I also enjoyed the books Delirium and Pandemonium by Lauren Oliver. I'm also hoping Lauren Oliver will write another book to go off of Requiem. I mainly enjoyed this book because of the suspense it builds up inside of you that urges you to keep reading and allows you to see what the world would be like without love.
0547884591|5.0|Not all the subjects for everybody, but something good for all.  Great sequel to other 4-Hour books.  Buy it now.
0307279189|5.0|Terrific, well written, captivating, inspirational...<br />It'll make you want to run your first ultra! ... or at least attempt your first marathon.<br />A must read for all skiddish runners and life-longers alike.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game. I have always wanted to play it but couldn't until I got an android. now I have an android and now I can play.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|My kids and all the adults who have watched it with us love this movie !  We laughed ! Cute movie with a good story!
B009POCG0Y|2.0|The ONLY highlight of this movie was looking at Matthew Mcconaughey...the story line was ridiculous, it has twists and turns but all and all it's stupid...rent it if you &#34;have&#34; to see it but don't buy.
B004T4KQJS|5.0|Physics is a hobby of mine. This one is challenging but worth it.  I originally started with a library copy, but I wanted to underline, so I bought a Kindle copy for my iPad.
1452101248|5.0|The recipes are creative, straighforward, and produce the most wonderful vegetable flavors and visuals.  Food for the soul, as well as the body.  This is, hands down, the best cookbook I've ever had.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Very heart warming and so like it is! A good book to be a guide for all of us whether we personally need it or not
B0042L78MG|5.0|I got this C.D. for my husband because he absolutely loved the song she sings, &#34;That Man&#34; in the movie, &#34;Chimpanzees&#34;. This song is on this C.D. and the whole C.D. turned out to be fabulous.
B000P0J0A6|5.0|A must have for anyone who collects movies.  My little one loves the \\"scary\\" aspects of the movie while I enjoy the special effects.  For the time, this movie had some cutting edge effects in it.  Great story line too!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This movie is going to appeal mainly to the older set. It is sweet, real and soul-searching. It's funny and sad and uplifting all at the same time. We rented it first and liked it so much that we bought it.<br /><br />If you like this movie, you will probably also like Frank and The Robot.
B0068RHSCW|4.0|This thriller was a little transparent when I came to plot, but the production quality and talent made the time investment worth it.  Craig is definitely not James Bond in this film, but his ability to keep the viewer glued to the film with his rustic and dark approach works.
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|Enjoyed the casting for several of the characters but sometimes the directing was silly. Also lots of unnecessary exposition for characters who really don't add to the plot. However despite these few criticisms it was beautifully shot, the design was incredible, and the dialogue was not half bad.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|I have truly grown to love Adam Sandler.  He pulls this kids movie off with style.  My three-year-old digs it and so do I.  Some humor is a little crude for a toddler, but the overall story and production is well worth the investment.  Well done Sandler!
B0011X95UQ|5.0|Played on my vintage 80's stereo gear, this album created a sonic 3-D image for me and emotionally transported me back to the days when I first heard this album (an absolutely welcome remembrance).  The album arrived well protected and in good condition.  I would be ready and waiting for the opportunity to do business with these people again.
B004BJMEO6|5.0|New love discovery by two very different women. And talk about the longest kiss, well they definitely took their time... :)
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|I had nothing but trouble attempting to view this film on my Kindle Fire.  It froze constantly,  would not start where I directed it to start after freezing,  and sound and picture had trouble matching up.  I only saw about half an hour of the film before giving up.  Lost the 3.99 it cost to rent and could not find the help or complaint box. Horrible and won't get burned again!
B00827OWO8|5.0|What can I say, Jennifer and Gina are awesome in this movie and they really create a world for the two of them in the most dangerous situations.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.<br />You have to read this book
B003FBMS4W|4.0|I rewatched this film from years ago and truly enjoyed it. The cast of characters was enjoyable, and the scenery was beautiful.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|After reading [[ASIN:B00BKAEPM8 60 Minutes To Motivation: Live Your Dreams and Lead A Powerful Life (The Boundless Growth Series)]] and a book by Stephen R. Covey, I decided i would read this book. I found it to be extremely insightful, the agreements are extremely clear and really made a huge impact on my self awareness. I recommend this book at anyone seeking a relatively quick read with tremendous value inside of it. I can see why this book has been a best seller for over 7 YEARS!! thanks!!
B00A0SJWQU|1.0|I don't even know where to start, so I will make this short and to the point.  The way I see it is that if you are going to remake a movie either follow the old movie and make it better, OR, you can do a remake with a new twist.<br />This movie followed the original and it was garbage.  Don't waste your time, REALLY!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Interesting details of a dictatorial regime, with the personal lives and actions of the main characters driving the story line.
0385751532|5.0|Second copy-- my students devoured (literally...it's in pieces) my first copy. Although, this is one of the few stories I prefer the film to, it is still an excellent read!!
1400069807|5.0|I've just bought the book and have read the introduction and the first chapter. What I have gathered so far is that the major food companies have figured out how to make their products irresistible(using salt, sugar and fat), sell more product and make more money. The problem is that what makes the product irresistible makes people sick as a side effect. To combat bad press, the companies are making an effort to reduce the bad effects (but not eliminate them, because people would buy less if the excess salt, sugar and fat were eliminated). This is an intriguing book that I think many others should read, too.
1609611543|1.0|This book is insane. It is so restrictive, you can only eat few pieces of fruit? You cannot eat legumes? Basically most food is off limits on this diet. How can anyone buy such hog wash? This will only lead to more eating disorders. Only a fraction of the population actually has gluten allergies. This is just the newest fad. And it sounds a lot like the Atkins diet.
B000SVZIDA|5.0|I love this bollywood feel to this movie! Lots of musical numbers, the cinematography is cool. Great job is choosing the leading cast. I may not of thought of nicole kidman and ewan mcgregor but they were amazing in this.<br /><br />Watch this if you are looking for a fun film with great music. Pure entertainment value. If you are looking for something more historical or with a more traditional storyline you may not enjoy baz luhrman's style. Consider viewing this with an open mind anyway.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|The game is something like jewelquest and is fast playing.  I don't really understand the meaning of all the stars, etc.  The instructions seem to be translated poorly from another language.
B000TDGGVU|4.0|This book shed light on current trends in an age of excess. Dissatisfaction with a choice is an interesting phenomenon. I thought this book was informative and well written. It concluded abruptly.
1250027624|5.0|I love the series.  The book just added to the richness of the characters as well as the mores of the time.  Comparing the time to today.....my, how things have changed.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Bond was at his best in this film and it is great to see Daniel Craig as Bond.  I think I like him the best of all the Bonds!
B0026IPAJA|3.0|Not HD but its a good movie.  Funny how we get used to HD so very fast these days. Kids like it for all the animals and don't mind
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|The whole plot of this book was amazing! I couldn't put thus book down! Plus Dawson sounds very handsome, along with the town.
B00005JKDR|4.0|Good for fearful 2 year olds. Monsters seems to calm her when she remembers that they need her to laugh and not scream. Kids love the voices, bright colors and the baby 98 months) loves round animated green Mike. Not scarey!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Very captivating show, want season two now !!! Lot's of action, romance, love the set and the characters very well written show !!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have always wanted my own horse,  but didn't have a farm or a big enough yard. With this app it is easy and fun to have my own horse.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show, very interesting, not the same old thing you always see. Hopefully it stays on tv for awhile!!!
B00AFEXRME|1.0|IT WAS LIKE GOING TO A &#34;AA&#34; MEETING. GOOD MESSAGE IN A ROUND ABOUT WAY. SHOULD HELP SOME ONE OUT THERE. FIR ME I AM NOTREADYTO GET ON A PLANE!
B00A3XWAU2|5.0|Not for many a year have I heard a rock album as good as this. You only have to take a look at the musicians who play on this album to know that you have just bought into rock royalty. Thank you guys for the best music this decade!

B00AYF5SHQ|4.0|It is easy to slap a \\"Five Star\\" to every CD and write a boiler-plate review, but what is the point?<br /><br />Thus if I got everyone to agree with me, then I should stop writing because the reviews will all be the same. However, am I better off by doing that, is there a point to get everyone to agree with me? Do I care?<br /><br />So you can call me names if you do not like my honest review and you can stop reading this trash!<br /><br />.......................................<br /><br />We didn't have Julia Fischer for a while due to her new extended family. We missed her music a lot.<br /><br />Have waited a couple of months for this recording and it was a little disappointing.<br /><br />The Dvorak concerto is beautifully played with a loud orchestra. The last movement is what most listeners are familiar with and is nice.<br /><br />The Bruch's concerto is also a well known concerto, and I can compare Julia's performance with the other greats easily. Being biased towards her, I like the Julia Fischer style better than the rest. This concerto includes a lot of sadness undertone yet with fire. Bruch did not have a rich comfortable life and the frustration is at times expressed through out the concerto.<br /><br />Julia, maybe after her maternal leave, has matured even more. There are more depth and understanding than before. Except these two concertos are not her favorite music though.<br /><br />The orchestra for me is loud but muffled, otherwise fine.<br /><br />I have ALL of Julia's recordings, but if I do not have this one, I won't be missing it.<br /><br />The recording is what I am unhappy about, quite poorly put together, making this CD sounds like it has been recorded forty years ago. I listened to the CD in a home theater audio system environment, and then I also listened to the same CD on a regular two-channel to compare the sound quality, there are no significant difference.<br /><br />Maybe Decca has lost their touch on this one. Decca has been a very careful and consistent recording company. However, Julia is also very pickyaudiophile and care very much about the audio playback. That's why she was one of the first major artists to record with Penta Tone until people who do not have surround sound keep complaining...<br /><br />For all of Ms Julia Fischer's fans out there, please note that I am not implying anything negative about Julia, I am criticizing the recording company.<br /><br />Welcome back Julia!careful and consistent recording company.

B004JRVQX0|1.0|I don't care how well it works. There is something inherently insidious about buying a product and not knowing you have to purchase another product for $50.00. Sorry ilok, nothing personal, but if I had to do it over again knowing what I now know, I would never buy another product that required ilok. Never, ever, ever!<br /><br />![[ASIN:B004JRVQX0 PACE iLok 2nd Generation]]
B00AFEXRME|2.0|So, he saves the plane and then proceeds to drink and snort through the rest of the movie.  Meanwhile, a heroin junkie recovers from and overdose and is reformed.  As a side note, John Goodman is a drug dealer.  This movie is difficult to watch and the ending defies the &#34;logic&#34; build up during the rest of the movie.
B005ETA5K2|1.0|I cannot recommend buying these until the bugs are ironed out.<br /><br />The comments below are based on windows XP operation - I haven't tried any of the Alfas on my Win 7 machines.<br /><br />I bought two units for my home network upgrade to 802.11n because I was so pleased with the performance of the old Alfa/Realtek AWUS036H's with my old 'g' router through lots of walls.<br /><br />The 036NHR units I got were at least a factor of four down in both received signal strength and in broadband speed (Ookla).  Some users report good performance, but I sure didn't see it - along with a number of other people.<br /><br />If you hit the forums, you find that there's a 'bad batch' of these floating around, and they'll send you a new good one if you get a bad one.<br /><br />Why fool around? Instead, I bought a couple of Netgear N300's at Walmart, and right out of the box I got > 50 Mbps in my most difficult location, no messing around with arcane drivers, just RTM and go.<br /><br />Maybe in a few months the 'bad batch' will have vaporized.  Until then, unless you're lucky, I wouldn't buy these.

B009RI4FRU|5.0|Mr. Anderson is possibly the greatest film maker of our time.  Not some cookie cutter carry-on of the Hollywood genre; a genuine story teller.  Yes, he seems quirky, but isn't life quirky?  He gets great performances out of great performers and tells a story that seems simple and beautiful, but....Wait, that's all you need.  It is simple and beautiful.  Rock on Mr. Anderson.  I've loved every one of em.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|We liked this okay, but it wasn't our favourite and compared to Season 1 it didn't have nearly as much of the creepiness factor. Perhaps it's that I'm just more scared by ghosts than mad men, but this didn't keep me awake at night, and with the crazy twists and turns in the plot it mostly just left me confused.

Skype works fine on my computer...I have tried talking to my granddaughter on my computer with Skype, and it works fine. Then we sign out and sign back in again and I try using Skype on my Kindle Fire to talk with her, and it won't show her at all...I can only see my face on the entire screen. I can hear her. I called Kindle customer support, but they weren't any help at all. I even re-downloaded the Skype application. Nothing helped. Very frustrating!<br />**Update** Okay, it does work now...at least I can see the other person. It wasn't very clear, but maybe that is their (or my) wifi speed.

B00B2TUKI0|5.0|I love the voice of Madeleine Peyroux.  My favorite track  on this album is&#34;You Don't Know Me&#34;.  This is one of four songs by Ray Charles on this album.  He recorded this song  51 years ago for a country album.  Madeleine Peyroux makes this song her own with her unique musical arrangements.  This song features beautiful trumpet playing.  I have never this song with trumpet playing.  It only plays for about thirty seconds, but it is sounds very special.  Peyroux also covers the song &#34;Bye Bye Love&#34;. I love her jazz rendition of this song.  It sounds smooth and cool.  I am surprised to learn that Ray Charles also recorded this song.<br /><br />I also love the song &#34;Bird On A Wire&#34;.  I love the lyrics of the song. I think this song is about the need to forgive myself of the mistakes I have made in my life. This song really speaks to me.  &#34;Changing All Those Changes&#34; is probably the only Buddy Holly song that I have never heard before.  This song is about making a change in attitude and moving on after a relationship does not work out.  This is a pleasant song.  I will never get tired of listening to this song.  It puts me in a good mood.  Madeleine Peyroux transforms the country classic love song &#34;I Can't Stop Loving You&#34; into a bluesy love song.  I love her rendition of this song.  She makes me forget the original and makes me love her version more.  Larry Goldings plays the organ on this track.  I think his playing gives this track a romantic uplifting tone.  &#34;Desperadoes Under the Eaves&#34;  and &#34;Guilty&#34; are two songs about people struggling with addictions to alcohol and drugs.  In &#34;Desperadoes Under the Eaves&#34;,  the  person still seem to struggle with booze.  In the song &#34;Guilty&#34;, the person is trying to overcome  addiction and return to a loved one.  Both of these songs are very moving lyrically.  &#34;The Blue Room&#34; is  Madelene Peyroux's best album since &#34;Careless Love&#34;.  Peyroux proves with this album that a great song is timeless. She also proves that a great song can also rise above one genre of music.oves with this album that a great song is timeless. She also proves that a great song can also rise above one genre of music.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I really like how this functions with google reader and being able to pin photos I like on blogs. I haven't noticed any bugs or glitches with it.
0439023491|5.0|I don't care if they say this is a book for teenagers.  I thought the story, the details, and the premise were excellent and kept my interest throughout all three books.
B004J4WLPU|5.0|A little hard to put together at first but once I got past the first few chapters it really grabbed my attention and I couldn't put it down. I related to this book because I too have a younger sister around Tess's age and we share the same bond as most sisters do. I would like to think that I too would have taken the same courageous actions that Bee took to get to the bottom of what really happened.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|I should preface this by saying that this was a rough read from a subject matter perspective (domestic abuse), there were times that it actually made my stomach turn either with anxiety or disgust so clearly not something to pick up if you're looking for lighter fare. That said, it was an absolute page turner that I stayed up until 2:30 AM to finish. I know that some people felt that it was a bit predictable and that may be true but that's not what kept me turning the pages. The look into the life of someone with a severe OCD was done so well that at times it exhausted me just to read about her rituals. I also was really rooting for the main character, Cathy. Yes, she's a mess but with good reason and I found myself mentally cheering every small victory she had. This was book that totally engaged me even as it horrified me and that's a pretty significant accomplishment
B005MMJ84K|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book! Hated the end though. Hope i like Reqium better! It should be absolutely amazing! Yes!
B0063M22QO|5.0|So many of the manning versions I looked at or tested had either too small of tiles or the layout went off the screen but this one is good.  It's easy to use, offers a good variety (so far anyway) and was inexpensive.  What more can you ask for in a game app?!
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|This app functions well on my kindle. I haven't noticed any bugs or issues. It is nice to have this app on my kindle for easily viewing connections.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|If you haven't watched the &#34;Castle&#34; TV series then you have no idea what you have been missing.  I've been a big fan of Nathan Fillion since &#34;Firefly&#34;/&#34;Serenity&#34; (and I still wish for more of that series/movie line!) but his playful chemisty with Stana Katic and her strong portrayal of a NYPD detective (Aren't they all beautiful in every TV series?  I'm waiting for them all to run into each other solving some crime in Central Park!).  I highly recommend all the &#34;Castle&#34; DVDs.

B004SH40BQ|4.0|Nifty device that allows me to use bluetooth headset with iPod classic (6th gen / 160gb)<br /><br />Pairing was quick and fairly painless.<br /><br />Only issue is the rapid battery drain caused by this device.  My usually long-lasting iPod ~(8 hours between charges) now shows a low battery after 3-4 hours of payback.<br /><br />One request for future versions would be a way to charge the iPod without having to remove this Bluetooth device (like a pass though); it's small (good thing) but as such, easier to lose.  Given how many people will be using this 'on the go', this wolud be very solid added functionality worth the cost of upgrading.<br /><br />Overall- recommended if you want to retro-actively add bluetooth capability to your older iPod device.
B0090X4GJE|5.0|When i first picked up this CD, I was so excited because I had been waiting for its release for months. As a massive fan of her first album, 'Lights', I was fully expecting to immediately love this CD and was looking forward to more of the same sound.<br />That wasn't what I got.<br />Whilst I liked this new CD immediately, I didn't fall in love with it straight off the bat (probably because I had been expecting a more electronic-folk sound like her debut album).<br />After a few listens however, I am borderline obsessed with this album and have it on almost constant repeat in my car. I can barely have it out of the CD player for more than 1 trip before I need to replace it to replay my favourite tracks.<br />Highlights of the CD for me are multiple;<br /><br />'Figure 8', 'My Blood' and 'I Need Your love' are perfect when I need a heavy beat song, and these are the tracks I can easily throw into a playlist at parties.<br /><br />For a subtler sound, which I use when winding down, before bed etc. 'I Know You Care' (which about breaks my heart) and 'JOY'. These both have a much lighter, breathier sound with sparse background instrumentals (its these tracks where ellie's voice really shines)<br />'Explosions' gets a special mention for its (haha) 'explosive' chorus which REALLY grabs attention, and I personally find extremely emotive.<br /><br />Finally, my absolute favourite song on the album, and probably of the whole year is the title track 'Halcyon'. Its the song that has absolutely everything a song needs for me; A great melody hook from the first bar of sound, delicate vocals with sparse instrumentals, awesome lyrics and a BIG beat pick up at the halfway point. It's this song that I start and end every car ride with, go to sleep with, wake myself up with, dance to parties at! its just so darn versatile!<br /><br />This album is my favourite record of the year. It sounds very authentic, not over-produced in my opinion (they haven't 'overgroomed' her voice, thankgoodness!), The lyrics are utterly stunning (particularly halcyon and i know you care), and its got such variety that theres something to suit any mood you're in.<br />Buy it!! :)
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Having writers from my top hit pick \\"24\\" working on the script is brilliant!  Claire Danes, Damien Lewis and Mandy Patinkin (he should have won an award too!) hit it out of the park every single episode both seasons 1 & 2.  Can't wait for Season 3.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great read.  This book really defines the sacrifices our men in uniform make for this country. Would highly recommend it.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|LOVED IT and cant wait to see the movie.  Hope it doesn't disappoint as some movies do after reading an incredible book.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A simple but beautifully written book with characters that are as believable as they are lovable. The dialogue is sharp, witty and truthful. The spine of the book, though difficult and one that could easily drift into a smarmy delivery, is handled with  wisdom, courage, and great humanity. This is a great book, not just a great youth book.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|This series has beautiful scenery, realistic characters and believable conflicts which retain the viewer's attention from episode to episode.  The dialogue is rich and almost poetic. It's a thoroughly enjoyable series to watch.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I liked it better than the first book and I thought it was truly a page turner.  I couldn't put it down.  Great read and I can't wait to get my hands on the next book.

B0028MBKVG|5.0|just a great story. well written and easy to read, but hard to put down. the book should be required reading in high school.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|Totally different than the american version! I lost my copy =[ so I bought this one, and I thought it was going to be the same (I know the american version by heart) so when I put this in I had to sit and watch, in amazement. it's amazing. it's violent. it's perfect!! must buy for any FF fan!!!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This Facebook is a better edition then the one that actually comes with the Kindle Fire!!  I recommend getting this one instead!!
B007BVT5N4|5.0|Best book I have ever read. I loved this book and will be reading it again.<br />Justin bieber I love you.
B00A7OJ0DC|3.0|I loved the movie, but if you are buying this combo pack for the digital copy, don't do it. The digital copy is on a disc that can only be transferred to a computer once and only plays on Windows Media Player-compatible devices. Therefore, if you are on an Android platform, sorry Disney sucks and doesn't want your business. Why can't this just be an UltraViolet copy like rest of the world? I will NEVER buy another Disney DVD that doesn't have UltraViolet digital copy. There is little wonder why people turn to piracy when the studios pull stunts like this one; what else can I do if I want my kid to sit and watch on an Android tablet? Waste of money... /rant

B00AA0TZTW|3.0|Although I'm always grateful to hear ANY \\"new\\" Jimi Hendrix material, the recordings on \\"People, Hell and Angels\\" really stretch the definition of \\"new\\" considering that this is simply a collection of variations on and alternate takes of songs we've all heard before.<br /><br />Most of the tracks on PHAA sound like casual jams that Jimi would never have wanted released, giving the whole thing a patched-together vibe that never really seems like a cohesive album.<br /><br />After listening to the entire disc, I was left feeling slightly sad because the album definitely produces a sense of the Hendrix estate \\"scraping the bottom of the barrel\\" with this release.  Indeed, Jimi's longtime producer Eddie Kramer reportedly said recently that PHAA \\"is probably the last of the good studio material.\\"  So Jimi's 42-year posthumous studio discography now seemingly comes to an end.  It was a glorious run that allowed fans to enjoy a lot of excellent music -- much, much more than we could ever have expected from such a brief career.  Thank God that Jimi always liked to have tape recorders running!  I just wish that PHAA could've been a better coda for his studio work.<br /><br />One piece of advice, though.  If you're going to purchase PHAA, get it from your local Target store.  They're selling an exclusive version of the album with a 20-minute(!) bonus track, \\"Ezy Ryder / MLK Jam (Captain Coconut)\\" which is actually more musically interesting than most of the other tracks!
